Abstract
Clostridium difficile is the most common hospital acquired pathogen in the United States, and 
infection is in many cases fatal. Toxins A and B are its major virulence factors, but increasingly a 
third toxin may be present, known as C. difficile transferase (CDT). An ADP-ribosyltransferase 
that causes actin cytoskeletal disruption, CDT is typically produced by the major, hypervirulent 
strains and has been associated with more severe disease. Here we show that CDT enhances the 
virulence of two PCR-ribotype 027 strains in mice. The toxin induces pathogenic host 
inflammation via a Toll-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) dependent pathway, resulting in the suppression 
of a protective host eosinophilic response. Finally, we show that restoration of TLR2 deficient 
eosinophils is sufficient for protection from a strain producing CDT. These findings offer an 
explanation for the enhanced virulence of CDT-expressing C. difficile and demonstrate a 
mechanism by which this binary toxin subverts the host immune response.

 The Gram positive anaerobe C. difficile causes mild to severe antibiotic associated diarrhea, 
pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon and death 1–2. The Rho-glucosylating Toxins A 
and B (TcdA and TcdB) cause host cell death and profound inflammation and are required 
for symptomatic infection 3–7. Production of the binary toxin CDT in addition to Toxins A 
and B by C. difficile is associated with higher mortality, increased peripheral white blood 
cell count, and elevated risk of recurrence in clinical studies 8–10. CDT expressing strains 
have also become increasingly common over the last ten years, paralleling the overall 
increase in incidence and severity of CDI, and now account for up to 20% of isolates in the 
hospital setting 11–14
CDT consists of two components which act cooperatively to intoxicate cells 14,15. CDTb, the 
binding component of CDT, is produced as a precursor protein and requires proteolytic 
cleavage prior to intoxication. Following cleavage, CDTb forms a heptamer and associates 
with the lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor, or LSR 16,17. This receptor is highly 
expressed within the liver, small intestine, colon and various other tissues, and is thought to 
be involved in the uptake and removal of lipoproteins and in the formation of tricellular tight 
junctions 18,19. Following formation of the CDTb heptamer and LSR binding, CDTa, the 
enzymatic component of CDT, binds the CDTb heptamer. This complex is endocytosed, and 
endosomal acidification triggers insertion of the CDTb heptamer into the endosomal 
membrane, through which CDTa is released into the cytoplasm 20. CDTa then transfers an 
ADP-ribose moiety to globular actin, which subsequently acts as a capping protein to 
prevent actin filament elongation. This results in collapse of the actin cytoskeleton, allowing 
the formation of microtubule protrusions on the surface of host cells which are thought to 
increase C. difficile adherence 21,22.
Although CDT production is associated with more severe disease, the role of CDT during 
infection is not well understood. In a hamster model of CDI, CDT was shown to enhance 
virulence in the presence of Toxin A, but not Toxin B. In humans, the intensity of the host 
inflammatory response is critical in determining disease outcome, and in murine models, 
innate IL-23 production is detrimental during infection 23–26. Toxins A and B shift the 
immune response towards this pathogenic inflammatory state by inducing IL-1β secretion 
via activation of the inflammasome 26,27. Therefore, we hypothesized that CDT may play an 
additional role during infection by influencing host inflammatory signaling.
In order to investigate the role of CDT during disease, here we have utilized isogenic CDT 
mutants of two distinct PCR-ribotype 027 strains in a mouse model of C. difficile colitis 
(R20291 and M7404). While both strains are human isolates that express Toxins A and B as 
well as CDT, R20291 was originally isolated from an outbreak in the United Kingdom while 
M7404 originated in Canada 28,29. In this system, we have shown that CDT is a true 
virulence factor capable of enhancing disease severity in conjunction with Toxins A and B. 
We report that CDT increased pathogenic host inflammation via a novel Toll-like Receptor 2 
dependent pathway, which was required for suppression of a protective host eosinophilic 
response during infection.

 CDT production enhances the virulence of PCR-ribotype 027 C. difficile
In order to test the role of CDT during disease, we infected mice with the PCR-ribotype 027 
strain R20291 or one of the isogenic mutants R20291 CdtB- (lacking the binding component 
of CDT) or R20291 CdtA- (lacking the enzymatic component of CDT) 28,30. Infection with 
R20291 led to significantly greater mortality and weight loss than infection with an 
equivalent dose of R20291 CdtA- or CdtB- (60% survival vs 100% survival, n = 14, p = 
0.001, Figure 1A–B, Supplementary Figure 1A–C). By day 3 of infection, mice infected 
with the CDT mutant strains began to recover weight and showed decreased clinical signs. 
At the same time point, groups infected with R20291 displayed increased weight loss and a 
high mortality rate. Thus, we concluded that the mutants lacking CDT were significantly 
attenuated at this dose.
We confirmed this phenotype in a second PCR-ribotype 027 strain, M7404, using an 
isogenic mutant lacking CdtA (M7404 CdtA-) as well as a third, CdtA complemented strain 
(M7404 CdtAComp) 29. Although we initially utilized a wide range of infectious doses 
(1×105 – 1×107 CFU/mouse) in an attempt to determine an LD50 inoculum, infection with 
M7404 did not result in significant mortality in our model. However, we did observe 
differences in weight loss and clinical scores between the groups. We found that M7404 
CdtA- caused significantly less weight loss and lower disease severity scores on days 2 and 
3 of infection than either the wild type or CDT complemented strains (Figure 1C–1D). 
These data suggest that although M7404 and R20291 may inherently differ in virulence in 
this model, CDT was able to enhance disease severity in both strains.
To further characterize the differences in disease manifestation in the presence or absence of 
CDT, we focused on strain R20291 as a model of severe C. difficile infection due to its 
significant mortality. The R20291 CdtB- mutant was chosen as a comparison to eliminate 
any potential effects of the known pore forming ability of CdtB alone 18. We examined 
haematoxylin and eosin stained histopathological sections of the ceca from both groups 
(Figure 1E–F). Sections taken from mice infected with R20291 displayed significantly more 
overall tissue damage in the form of epithelial barrier disruption (characterized by 
disorganization and sloughing of epithelial cells), submucosal edema, and lumenal exudate 
than those infected with R20291 CdtB- (Supplementary Figure 1D). We next measured the 
production of Toxins A and B in these mice on day 3 of infection, as differential expression 
of these major virulence factors could explain the differences observed in tissue pathology. 
However, we did not observe differences in production of Toxins A and B (Supplementary 
Figure 1E), suggesting that the difference in mortality rates was driven by other factors. We 
also assessed C. difficile burden in cecal contents on day 3 of infection, but did not observe a 
difference at this time point (Supplementary Figure 1F). We next assessed translocation of 
commensals from the gut to other organs as a possible consequence of epithelial damage. 
This process has been suggested to drive mortality in some models of CDI 25. However, we 
did not observe differences in translocation of commensals to the liver or spleen 
(Supplementary Figure 1G). We conclude that tissue pathology due to CDT may influence 
disease outcome independent of Toxin A and B production, C. difficile burden, or liver 
commensal burden.

 CDT causes increased inflammation
Based on clinical data demonstrating a correlation between the host inflammatory response 
and disease severity, we hypothesized that a systemic inflammatory response could result 
from increased tissue pathology and contribute to mortality during infection with R20291. 
To investigate this possibility, we quantified the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 
within cecal tissue of C57BL6 mice infected with R20291 or R20291 CdtB- on day 3 post 
infection. Both IL-1β and IL-6 are known to be highly upregulated during CDI and to 
influence the type of immune response which develops. We found that R20291 induced 
significantly more cecal IL-1β and IL-6 than R20291 CdtB- (Figure 2A–B). Similarly, we 
observed significantly elevated serum IL-6 in R20291 infected mice (Figure 2C). These 
results suggest that CDT production by R20291 results in a stronger local and systemic 
inflammatory response within the murine host.
We next sought to determine how CDT signaling directly influences inflammatory cytokine 
production. To investigate this, we exposed bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) 
generated from C57BL6 mice to purified CDT in the presence or absence of 2 ng/mL Toxins 
A and B, and measured the amount of IL-1β secreted into the culture medium as a readout 
of inflammatory cytokine production (Figure 2D). As we and other groups have shown 
previously, Toxins A and B are sufficient to activate the inflammasome at this concentration, 
but a prior “priming” signal is required for robust IL-1β secretion 27. We found that CDT 
alone did not induce IL-1β secretion at this relatively long time point, even at a much higher 
concentration than Toxins A and B (200 ng/mL). However, CDT did enhance IL-1β release 
in the presence of Toxins A and B. These data suggest that CDT acts as a priming signal 
prior to inflammasome activation by Toxins A and B. To investigate this further, we 
examined the ability of CDT to activate NFκB in a RAW macrophage reporter cell line. 
CDT alone was able to significantly activate NFκB over mock treated cells (Figure 2E). 
Additionally, CDT alone induced significant pro-IL-1β gene expression in C57BL6 BMDCs 
as measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 2F). In order to determine whether this phenotype was 
specific to CDT activity, we utilized anti-CDT targeted nanobodies which have previously 
been demonstrated to block CDT intoxication 31. At concentrations of 200 ng/mL (12 nM) 
and 20 ng/mL (1.2 nM), the anti-CDTa and anti-CDTb nanobodies both significantly 
decreased the amount of IL-1β secreted by BMDCs (Figure 2G). Thus, we conclude that 
exposure to CDT is sufficient to activate NFκB and enhance inflammatory cytokine 
production.
CDT suppresses protective colonic eosinophilia
Because cytokine production shapes the immune response by influencing cell development, 
recruitment, proliferation and survival, we next utilized flow cytometry to examine the 
composition of effector cells in the colon during murine infection with R20291 and R20291 
CdtB-. As expected, neutrophils (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6G+ Ly6C+) dominated the innate 
compartment of both infected groups, representing roughly 20% of live cells in the colon 
(Figure 3A–C). Monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6Chi Ly6G−) were also significantly elevated 
in the colon of both infected groups compared to uninfected, antibiotic treated controls. 
However, no difference was observed between neutrophils and monocytes in R20291 versus

 R20291 CdtB- infected groups, either as a percentage of live cells or by total cell number, 
suggesting that differences in neutrophil and monocyte recruitment were not responsible for 
infection outcome. In contrast, eosinophils were significantly elevated in R20291 CdtB- 
infected mice compared to R20291 infected animals (Figure 3A–C). As with neutrophils and 
monocytes, eosinophils were significantly increased in both groups compared to uninfected, 
antibiotic treated controls.
Studies from our lab demonstrated a protective role for eosinophils after recombinant IL-25 
administration 32. Because the protected, R20291 CdtB- infected group showed increased 
eosinophils compared to R20291, we hypothesized that high eosinophil numbers may 
correlate with protection from mortality. To examine this more closely, we used weight loss 
as a measure of disease severity and found a significant correlation between increased 
weight loss and lower eosinophil percentages, suggesting that eosinophils were associated 
with protection from disease (Figure 3D).
We next sought to determine whether eosinophils were causative in protection or merely 
associated with better outcome. To address this question, we depleted eosinophils in mice 
infected with R20291 or R20291 CdtB- using an anti-SiglecF targeted antibody which 
results in eosinophil apoptosis 33 (Figure 3E, Supplementary Figure 2). As expected, animals 
infected with R20291 CdtB- and treated with an isotype control antibody were relatively 
protected from mortality. In contrast, depletion of eosinophils with anti-SiglecF prior to and 
during infection with R20291 CdtB- significantly enhanced mortality. In R20291 infected 
mice, depletion of eosinophils did not significantly enhance mortality, perhaps because 
eosinophil counts are already relatively low in this group. Overall, these results demonstrate 
that an eosinophilic response is protective during CDI and that CDT production by a PCR-
ribotype 027 strain has a suppressive effect on eosinophils in the colon, likely contributing to 
the enhanced virulence of this strain.
CDT induces apoptosis of blood eosinophils during infection
Next, we investigated the cause of the decrease in eosinophils observed in R20291 infected 
mice. We hypothesized that eosinophil recruitment signals or growth factors would be 
decreased in mice infected with the CDT producing strain. However, R20291 and R20291 
CdtB- infected animals demonstrated equivalent levels of the eosinophil-specific 
chemokines eotaxin-1 and eotaxin-2 (Figure 4A). Eosinophil-promoting growth factors, 
such as IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-13, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), were 
similar or elevated in R20291 infected mice, suggesting these factors were not responsible 
for the observed decrease in eosinophils (Supplementary Figure 3A–B) 34–36.
Because the expression of CCR3, the cognate receptor for the eotaxins, has been shown to 
influence eosinophil recruitment 37, we hypothesized that different levels of this receptor 
could influence responsiveness to equivalent signals. We evaluated eosinophil surface 
expression of CCR3 during infection with R20291 and R20291 CdtB- (Figure 4B) by gating 
on CD45+ CD11c− CD11b+ SiglecF+ cells and assessing CCR3 staining. We observed a 
significant decrease in the number of CCR3+ eosinophils in the colon of R20291 infected 
mice compared to R20291 CdtB- infected animals. These results could indicate that

 eosinophils in R20291 infected mice are less responsive to eotaxins, thereby impacting 
recruitment to the gut. However, CCR3 upregulation is also associated with eosinophil 
maturity and egress from the bone marrow 38. Additionally, both CCR3+ and CCR3− 
eosinophils have been identified within the colon, suggesting that this receptor not 
absolutely required for colonic eosinophil recruitment 33. Therefore, we hypothesized that a 
decrease in colonic CCR3+ eosinophils could also result from other causes, such as a 
decrease in the number of mature eosinophils in the colon due to cell death.
To further investigate this possibility, we sought to determine where the eosinophil defect 
began. Eosinophils develop within the bone marrow from eosinophil progenitors (EoPs), 
defined as Lineage−, CD34+, Sca-1−, IL-5Rα+, cKitint cells 33,39–41 (Supplementary Figure 
3C). We did not observe a significant difference in the number of bone marrow EoPs in 
R20291 or R20291 CdtB- infected mice (Figure 4C), consistent with the similar levels of 
eosinophil-promoting growth factors in these groups. When we examined mature bone 
marrow eosinophils, we noted that both infected groups had significantly more eosinophils 
than antibiotic treated controls (Figure 4D). However, there was no significant difference in 
the number of mature eosinophils between the two infected groups. In contrast, when we 
examined eosinophil numbers in the peripheral blood of infected mice, we noted a 
significantly decreased percentage of live eosinophils in R20291 infected mice (Figure 4E). 
This mirrored the phenotype observed in the colon and indicated that the eosinophil defect 
was systemic, but did not originate in the bone marrow, suggesting that a recruitment defect 
was not responsible for the observed decrease in colonic eosinophils.
We also observed that a higher percentage of blood eosinophils in mice infected with 
R20291 stained positive for Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis, which could contribute to the 
observed defect in mature eosinophils (Figure 4F). Taken together, these data suggest that 
eosinopoiesis functions similarly within both groups of infected mice, but that mature 
eosinophils which exit the bone marrow in R20291 infected mice undergo increased rates of 
apoptosis, resulting in the observed decrease in live eosinophils in both the blood and colon 
of these animals.
CDT recognition by TLR2 mediates pathogenic eosinophil suppression
Because activation of NFκB is classically associated with Pattern Recognition Receptor 
(PRR) signaling, we next asked whether these signaling pathways were involved in 
recognition of CDT to mediate eosinophil apoptosis. We analyzed the ability of BMDCs 
generated from whole bone marrow of TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and TLR5−/− mice to secrete 
IL-1β following exposure to CDT and Toxins A and B. We found that TLR2−/− BMDCs 
were essentially unable to respond to CDT, suggesting that this pathway may be involved in 
CDT recognition (Figure 5A). To corroborate the role of TLR2, we treated wild type 
C57BL6 BMDCs with CDT and Toxins A and B following pre-treatment with an anti-TLR2 
neutralizing antibody or an isotype control. The anti-TLR2 antibody significantly reduced 
the release of IL-1β (Figure 5B). To determine whether this interaction occurs in vivo, we 
next infected TLR2−/− mice alongside C57BL/6 wild-type controls with R20291 as well as 
R20291 CdtB-. Neither TLR2−/− nor C57BL/6 mice experienced significant mortality after 
infection with R20291 CdtB- (Figure 5C). However, TLR2−/− mice were significantly

 protected from mortality after infection with CDT-producing R20291, suggesting that TLR2 
signaling enhances C. difficile virulence in the presence of CDT (Figure 5C).
We next asked whether TLR2 may be involved in the marked decrease in colonic eosinophils 
observed during infection with R20291. We assessed eosinophilia in the colonic lamina 
propria via flow cytometry, and found that TLR2−/− mice displayed significantly higher 
numbers of colonic eosinophils than wild-type mice after infection with R20291. In contrast, 
no significant difference was noted after infection with R20291 CdtB-, suggesting that the 
increase in colonic eosinophils in TLR2−/− mice specifically occurred in the presence of 
CDT (Figure 5D). These results suggest that recognition of CDT via TLR2 leads to 
suppression of eosinophilia in the colon and enhanced mortality.
Restoration of TLR2−/− eosinophils protects against CDT+ C. difficile
To determine whether preventing TLR2 signaling on a subset of eosinophils was sufficient to 
provide protection from R20291, we performed an adoptive transfer of bone marrow derived 
eosinophils (BM Eos) generated from either C57BL/6 or TLR2−/− mice. BM Eo cultures 
routinely consisted of greater than 75% CD45+ CD11b+ SiglecF+ SSChi mature eosinophils 
(Supplementary Figure 4A). Mice that received TLR2−/− BM Eos were significantly 
protected from R20291-mediated mortality compared to mice that received C57BL/6 BM 
Eos and to wild type controls (Figure 5E), suggesting that restoration of eosinophils is 
protective only when the eosinophils are unable to signal via TLR2. We next investigated the 
possibility that this could be due to direct killing of eosinophils by CDT. We incubated BM 
Eos with CDT in vitro and assessed cell death by Live/dead and Annexin V staining 
measured by flow cytometry. Treatment with CDT did not significantly enhance the number 
of apoptotic (Figure 5F) or dead eosinophils detected (Supplementary Figure 4B). CDT 
likewise did not enhance apoptosis or death of eosinophils when added in conjunction with 
Toxins A and B (Supplementary Figure 4C–D). Therefore, we conclude that direct killing of 
eosinophils by CDT is unlikely, suggesting that TLR2 signaling on eosinophils influences 
host survival by another mechanism, perhaps by modifying the protective function of these 
cells or their recruitment capability.
Discussion
Despite understanding the enzymatic function of CDT, the role of this toxin in enhancing C. 
difficile virulence remains incompletely characterized, and the influence of CDT on the host 
immune response has not been examined. We found that CDT was able to enhance the 
virulence of two PCR-ribotype 027 C. difficile strains, resulting in increased tissue 
pathology. CDT skewed the host inflammatory response by suppressing protective 
eosinophils within the colon and blood via the indirect induction of eosinophil apoptosis. 
Additionally, purified CDT was able to activate NFκB and to induce inflammatory IL-1β 
production in conjunction with Toxins A and B. This required TLR2 signaling, and TLR2-
deficient mice were protected against the CDT-producing strain R20291, correlating with 
increased colonic eosinophils compared to wild type mice. Finally, adoptive transfer of 
TLR2 deficient eosinophils was sufficient to protect mice against CDT+ R20291, confirming 
an unexpected role for eosinophils in protection from CDI.

 Although we demonstrated that CDT is able to activate NFκB and enhance inflammatory 
cytokine production, it is unclear where this signaling occurs in vivo. CDT may intoxicate 
epithelial cells to promote recruitment of immune cells, which may in turn enhance the 
inflammatory response. Alternatively, CDT may act directly on immune cells to enhance 
NFκB activation. The role of the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor in mediating an 
immune response is also unknown. It is conceivable that LSR and TLR2 mediate separate 
pathways in response to CDT. Alternatively, these receptors may cooperate to permit CDT 
recognition and intoxication.
Another major question concerns the mechanism of eosinophil killing by CDT. Although 
our data suggest that CDT does not directly kill eosinophils, intoxication by CDT and the 
subsequent increase in inflammatory cytokine production by innate cells may shape the 
inflammatory environment to support eosinophil apoptosis. Indeed, innate inflammation has 
long been known to suppress eosinophilia by unknown mechanisms 42,43. TLR2-dependent 
eosinophil suppression is also not unprecedented, as multiple groups have reported in 
different murine models of allergic inflammation 44–46. Administration of a TLR2 agonist 
has been shown to reduce eosinophilia by inducing T cell apoptosis in a model of allergic 
conjunctivitis, as well as by enhancing T regulatory cells and inducing Th1 cytokines in 
murine asthma models. It remains to be investigated whether these mechanisms underlie 
eosinophil suppression during CDI. The protective role of eosinophils is likewise unknown, 
and clarifying how TLR2 signaling impacts the function of these cells may provide clues to 
their activity during infection.
Understanding the mechanism by which CDT enhances C. difficile virulence is essential to 
understanding the virulence of PCR-ribotype 027 strains, and of other hypervirulent strains 
which express CDT. These isolates are increasingly common and their spread likely 
contributes to the overall increase in CDI incidence and severity. Our data clarify the 
protective role eosinophils play during CDI and suggest that targeting CDT in the 
development of vaccines and therapeutic inhibitors is essential to successfully treating 
infection with these strains. Our knowledge of C. difficile virulence factors which result in 
pathogenic immune responses during CDI continues to evolve, presenting new potential 
drug targets for treating this common and life threatening infection.
Methods
Bacterial Strains and Culture
C. difficile strains R20291 CdtA- and R20291 CdtB- was generated using the ClosTron 
system and functional inactivation of the targeted genes confirmed by Western blot as 
previously described 28. Strains M7404 CdtA- and M7404 CdtComp were generated using 
the targetron system as previously described 29. To prepare the infection inoculum, strains 
were inoculated onto BHI agar supplemented with the appropriate selective antibiotic from 
frozen stocks and incubated at 37°C overnight in an anaerobic work station (Shel Labs). 
Single colonies were inoculated into BHI medium supplemented with cycloserine and 
cefoxitin (C. difficile supplement, Sigma) and grown anaerobically overnight at 37°C. The 
next day, cultures were spun for 1 minute at 6,000 × g and washed twice in anaerobic PBS. 
The optical density of the cultures were measured and culture density adjusted to 1×108

 CFU/mL (R20291 strains) or 2×106 CFU/mL (M7404 strains) in sterile, anaerobic PBS. 
Syringes were loaded with the inoculum and sealed in airtight bags before and during 
transport to the infection facility. Mice received 100 μl of inoculum each by oral gavage. To 
enumerate C. difficile in cecal samples, cecal contents were resuspended by weight in pre-
reduced PBS. Resuspended cecal contents were serially diluted in PBS and plated on BHI 
agar supplemented with 1% Sodium Taurocholate and 1 mg/mL D-cycloserine and 0.032 
mg/mL cefoxitin (Sigma) before incubating overnight anaerobically at 37°C. Liver bacterial 
burden was determined by homogenizing whole liver samples in sterile, aerobic PBS. Liver 
homogenate was serially diluted and plated on non-selective BHI agar before incubating 
aerobically overnight at 37°C. Liver CFU are reported according to liver sample weight.
CDT Complementation
The recombinant plasmid used for complementation of the cdtA mutant was pJIR3107, 
described previously 47. C. difficile strains were grown in TY broth (3.0% tryptone, 2.0% 
yeast extract and 0.1% sodium thioglycollate) at 37°C in a Don Whitley A35 Anaerobic 
Workstation in an atmosphere of 10% (v/v) H2, 10% (v/v) CO2 and 80% (v/v) N2. Toxins 
were partially purified and concentrated eight-fold from 72 hour C. difficile culture 
supernatants by methanol-chloroform precipitation 48. Protein concentrations were 
determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Concentrated supernatant proteins (10 μg) were separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and 
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). Membranes were detected as 
previously described 29. CDTa and CDTb were detected using a CDTa-specific antibody and 
C. perfringens Ib-specific antibody that is cross reactive with CDTb 49, respectively. CDTa 
and CDTb antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit 
goat antibodies (Millipore) The Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent kit (Perkin-
Elmer) was used to detect the blots, following the manufacturer’s instructions and blots were 
recorded by exposure to X-ray film (Fujifilm).
Cell culture
Murine BMDC were generated as previously described with minor modifications 50. Briefly, 
femurs and tibia were removed and bone marrow flushed with PBS. Cells were counted and 
viability assessed by Trypan Blue staining and resuspended in RPMI 1640 media (Life 
Technologies) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/ml 
Penicillin and 100 U/ml Streptomycin. Media was supplemented with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF 
(Peprotech) and 55 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), and 3×106 cells were seeded into a T75 
vent cap tissue culture flask. Cells were cultured for 7 days, and supplemented with fresh 
media on days 2 and 4. On day 7 cells were harvested for stimulation. For stimulation, 
BMDCs were detached with a cell scraper and resuspended to 1.1×106 cells/mL in fresh 
media. 180 ul of cell suspension was added per well of a 96 well plate. Cells were stimulated 
with the indicated concentrations of CDT or Toxins A and B in a total volume of 20 ul 
complete media. After the indicated incubation time, cells were spun down and supernatant 
removed and frozen at −80 °C for later analysis. For cell stimulation, TLR-ligand tested 
lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Anti-TLR2 antibody and IgG 
isotype control were obtained from Invivogen and eBioscience, respectively. Anti-CDT 
nanobodies were generated as previously described 31.

 Raw Blue NFκB reporter cell were obtained from Invivogen and grown in DMEM 
supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% FBS. Cell responsiveness to TLR stimulation 
and mycoplasma status was assessed by Invivogen. For stimulation, cells were detached 
using a cell scraper and resuspended to a density of 5.5 × 105 cells/mL in fresh media. 180 
ul of cell suspension was added per well of a 96 well plate, and cells were stimulated with 
CDT as indicated. Secreted Embryonic Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) secretion was 
quantified by spinning down cells, removing the culture supernatant, and incubating 50 ul of 
supernatant with 150 ul of Quanti-Blue detection media (Invivogen) for 30 minutes at 37°C 
prior to reading in a spectrophotometer. For treatment of BM Eos with CDT, cells were 
harvested from culture on day 10 and plated in 96 well plates in fresh media before addition 
of CDT and neutralizing antibodies. Cells were harvested at 8 hours and stained for flow 
cytometry to assess eosinophil viability.
Toxins
Purified CdtA and CdtB were expressed in Bacillus megaterium as previously reported 22. 
CdtB was previously activated by protease cleavage (0.2 μg of trypsin/μg of protein for 30 
minutes at 37°C) prior to addition of trypsin inhibitor. Mock buffer used contained identical 
concentrations of trypsin and trypsin inhibitor to mimic the purified proteins. Purified Toxins 
A and B were purified from C. difficile strain VPI 10463 and were obtained as a kind gift 
from Techlab, Inc. (Blacksburg, VA). Toxins were detected within cecal contents using the 
C. difficile TOXA/B ELISA according to manufacturer instructions, also kindly donated by 
Techlab, Inc.
Cytokine detection
IL-1β and IL-6 were detected in protein supernatants from BMDCs, serum and tissue lysates 
using the Mouse IL-1β and IL-6 Ready-Set-Go! ELISA kit (eBioscience) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. Eotaxin-1 and Eotaxin-2 were detected in cecal lysates using 
R&D Systems DuoSet ELISA kits according to manufacturer’s instructions. BMDC pro-
IL-1β production was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RNA was isolated 
using the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). Contaminating genomic DNA was digested using 
the Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion) and RNA reverse transcribed with the Tetro cDNA 
synthesis kit (Bioline) according to manufacturer instructions. The resulting cDNA was 
purified using Qiagen’s PCR purification kit. IL-1b gene expression was quantified by 
Quantitect Primer assay (Qiagen) using Sensifast SYBR & Fluorescein Mix (Bioline) using 
the Quantitect 2-step amplification protocol. Gene expression was normalized to the S14 
housekeeping gene (forward primer - TGGTGTCTGCCACATCTTTGCATC, reverse primer 
– AGTCACTCGGCAGATGGTTTCCTT).
Mice and infection
Experiments were carried out using sex matched 8–12 week old C57BL6, TLR2−/−, 
TLR4−/−, and TLR5−/− mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Experiments contained no fewer 
than 4 mice, with a goal of 8 mice, per experimental group. Based on an expected protection 
from 50% to 0% mortality, 6 mice per group will have > 90% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference in mortality. All animals were housed under specific pathogen free 
conditions at the University of Virginia’s animal facility and procedures were approved by 
Cowardin et al.

 the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Virginia. No animals 
were excluded from the study, and sample harvesting was randomized between groups. 
Blinded scoring of animals was not possible due to separate equipment used to prevent 
contamination between C. difficile strains. Prior to infection, bedding was exchanged every 
two days between TLR2−/− and C57BL6 mice for a minimum of two weeks to equilibrate 
microbiota between strains. Mice were infected using a modified version of a previously 
published model for CDI 30. Briefly, mice were given an antibiotic cocktail consisting of 45 
mg/L Vancomycin (Mylan), 35 mg/L Colistin (Sigma), 35 mg/L Gentamicin (Sigma), 215 
mg/L Metronidazole (Hospira) ad libitum for 3 days (Days −6 to −4). Mice were then 
switched back to regular drinking water for two days (Days −3 onward), followed by an IP 
injection (0.032 mg/g) of Clindamycin (Hospira) on Day −1. On Day 0, mice were gavaged 
with C. difficile. Mice were monitored twice daily throughout the course of the infection and 
immediately euthanized if severe illness developed according to clinical scoring parameters. 
Scores were based on weight loss, coat condition, activity level, diarrhea, posture and eye 
condition for a cumulative clinical score between 1 and 20.
Tissue Protein and Histology
Mice were humanely euthanized and tissue was immediately removed for analysis. Total 
cecal lysate was generated by removing the ceca and rinsing gently with PBS. Tissue was 
bead beaten for 1 minute in 400 ul of Lysis Buffer I (1× HALT Protease Inhibitor (Pierce), 5 
mM HEPES). 400 ul of Lysis Buffer II was added (1× HALT Protease Inhibitor (Pierce), 5 
mM HEPES, 2% Triton X-100) and tubes inverted gently. Tissue samples were incubated on 
ice for 30 minutes, followed by a 5 minute spin at 13,000 × g at 4°C. Supernatant was 
removed to a fresh tube, and total protein concentration was assessed by BCA assay 
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). Cytokine concentration is shown relative 
to total protein concentration. To generate histological sections, cecal samples were placed 
in Bouin’s Solution (Sigma) for 18 hours. Tissue samples were moved to 70% Ethanol 
before paraffin embedding and sectioning. Sections were mounted on slides and stained with 
haemotoxylin and eosin prior to microscopic examination. Slides were scored blinded, with 
a score from 0 to 3 assigned based on 5 parameters: epithelial disruption, submucosal 
edema, inflammatory infiltrate, mucosal thickening and luminal exudate as previously 
reported 51. Scores were averaged between 3 independent, blinded observers. Image 
manipulation was limited to movement of scale bars to bottom left corner.
Eosinophil Depletion
Eosinophils were depleted using an anti-mouse SiglecF monoclonal antibody (R&D 
Systems) as previously shown 33. Control groups received Rag IgG2A isotype control 
antibody (R&D Systems). Both groups were given 40 ug of antibody per mouse on day −1 
and day +1 of infection (80 ug total per mouse) via intraperitoneal injection. Eosinophil 
depletion was evaluated by flow cytometry, which showed an 82% average reduction in 
colonic eosinophils.
Eosinophil adoptive transfer
Bone marrow derived eosinophils were generated as previously described and examined on 
day 10 for eosinophil markers and viability via flow cytometry 52,53. Cultures routinely

 consisted of >75% live CD45+ CD11b+ SiglecF+ SSChi eosinophils. For adoptive transfer, 
cultures were synchronized such that each injection occurred on day 10 of culture. Cultures 
were collecting using a cell scraper and washed 2× in sterile PBS. 4×105 eosinophils were 
given intraperitoneally per mouse. Mice received 4 total injections of eosinophils, starting 
the day prior to infection and for 3 subsequent days.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was calculated and significance determined (p< 0.05) using Mann-
Whitney test or other suitable analysis, including Welch’s t-test for unequal variance. All 
statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software.
Flow Cytometry
Colonic lamina propria was prepared for flow cytometry by thoroughly rinsing the tissue in 
Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 5% FBS and 25 mM HEPES. 
Epithelial cells were removed by gentle shaking for 40 minutes at 37°C in HBSS with 15 
mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 10% FBS and 1 mM DTT. Halfway through the incubation, 
colon samples were transferred to fresh buffer. Next, colon samples were thoroughly 
chopped using scissors and digested in RPMI 1640 containing 0.17 mg/mL Liberase TL 
(Roche) and 30 ug/mL DNase (Sigma). Samples were digested for 40 minutes at 37°C with 
gentle shaking. Samples were then spun down at 300 × g and resuspended in HBSS with 5% 
FBS and 25 mM HEPES before passage through a 100 uM cell strainer followed by a 40 uM 
cell strainer (both Fisher Scientific). Cells were counted and density adjusted to 1×107 
cells/mL. 100 ul of cell suspension were aliquoted per well of a 96 well plate for antibody 
staining. For staining, cells were initially blocked with TruStain fcX (anti-mouse CD16/32 
antibody, BioLegend) for ten minutes at room temperature. Cells were spun down and 
resuspended in LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua (Life Technologies) for 20 minutes at room 
temperature. Cells were washed twice and stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies. 
Flow cytometry was performed on an LSR Fortessa cytometer (BD Biosciences) and all data 
analysis performed via FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.). See Supplementary Table S1 for antibodies 
used.

 Figure 3. CDT production suppresses protective colonic eosinophilia
(A) Mice infected with the indicated strain, or uninfected and treated with antibiotics only 
(Abx) were sacrificed on day 3. Colon tissue was isolated and processed to a single cell 
suspension and stained for flow cytometry. Representative flow plots depicting neutrophils 
and eosinophils are shown (two independent experiments, n=10). (B–C) Eosinophils 
(CD45+ CD11b+ SiglecF+), monocytes (CD45+ CD11b+ Ly6Chi) and neutrophils (CD45+ 
CD11b+ Ly6G+) were quantified. All three cell types are significantly elevated in both 
infected groups compared to Abx treated controls (data shown combined from two 
independent experiments, n=10). (D) Weight loss and percentage live colon eosinophils were 
compared using data combined from four independent experiments (n=17). (E) Colonic 
eosinophils were depleted using 40 ug of an anti-SiglecF targeted antibody or an isotype 
control antibody one day prior and one day following infection with C. difficile. Animals 
were monitored for clinical symptoms and humanely euthanized when required. Data shown 
combined from two independent experiments (n = 13). * = p value < 0.05, ** = p value < 
0.01, *** = p value < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney test (B–C), linear regression (D) or Kaplan-
Meier curve (E). NS = not significant. Error bars shown represent S.E.M.

 Figure 4. CDT production by C. difficile promotes eosinophil apoptosis
(A) Mice infected with the indicated strain, or uninfected and treated with antibiotics (Abx) 
were sacrificed on day 3. Cecal eotaxin levels were assessed by lysing whole cecal sections 
and quantifying protein via ELISA (data combined from two independent experiments, 
shown normalized to total protein concentration, n=16). (B) Colon tissue was isolated and 
processed to a single cell suspension and stained for flow cytometry. CCR3 staining on 
eosinophils was assessed by first gating on total eosinophils (identified as CD45+ CD11b+ 
SiglecF+ SSChi cells) (data shown are representative of 2 independent experiments, n=8). 
(C–D) Mice were sacrificed on day 3 and bone marrow harvested for flow cytometry. 
Eosinophil progenitors were identified as Lin- CD34+ Sca-1− IL-5Rα+ cKitint cells by flow 
cytometry. Mature bone marrow eosinophils were quantified as CD45+ CD11b+ SiglecF+ 
SSChi cells (data shown combined from 2 independent experiments, n=6). (E–F) Blood 
eosinophils were assessed on day 3 of infection by flow cytometry following cardiac 
puncture, red blood cell lysis, and staining. Live eosinophils were identified at CD45+ 
CD11b+ SiglecF+ Live deadneg and apoptotic eosinophils identified as CD45+ CD11b+ 
SiglecF+ Annexin V+ Live deadneg cells. Data shown combined from two independent 
experiments. (n=7) * = p value < 0.05, ** = p value < 0.01, *** = p value < 0.001 by Mann-
Whitney test (A, C–D, F) or Welch’s unequal variance t-test (B, E). NS = not significant. 
Error bars shown represent S.E.M.

 Figure 5. TLR2 mediates CDT recognition and is required for eosinophil suppression
(A) BMDCs were generated from TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and TLR5−/− mice before treatment 
with 200 ng/mL CDTa and 200 ng/mL CDTb (CDT) and 2 ng/mL Toxin A and 2 ng/mL 
Toxin B (TcdA/B) for 24 hours. IL-1β secretion was assessed by ELISA. (B) BMDCs were 
treated with 200 ng/mL CDTa and 200 ng/mL CDTb (CDT) and 2 ng/mL Toxin A and 2 
ng/mL Toxin B (TcdA/B) for 24 hours in the presence of a TLR2 neutralizing antibody or an 
isotype control. IL-1β was assessed by ELISA. Data shown combined from three 
independent experiments of 3 replicates each (A–B). (C) 8 week old TLR2 knockout mice 
or C57BL/6J mice were infected with R20291 or R20291 CdtB- and monitored for survival 
(data combined from two independent experiments, n=14). (D) Mice were sacrificed on day 
3 of infection and colonic eosinophils (CD45+ CD11b+ SiglecF+ SSChi) were measured by 
flow cytometry following tissue processing and staining (data combined from two 
independent experiments, n=8). (E) C57BL/6 mice received 4×105 TLR2−/− or B6 bone 
marrow-derived eosinophils (TLR2−/− Eo or B6 Eo) via IP injection one day prior and for 3

 subsequent days following infection with R20291 or R20291 CdtB-. Mice were monitored 
daily for survival (data combined from two independent experiments, n=13). (F) BM Eos 
were incubated for 8 hours with 200 ng/mL CDTa and 200 ng/mL CDTb in the presence or 
absence of anti-TLR2 neutralizing antibody (aTLR2) or anti-CDT neutralizing nanobody 
(aCDT). Eosinophils were stained with Live dead or Annexin V and cell death was assessed 
by flow cytometry, data shown are representative of 3 independent experiments assayed in 
duplicate. * = p value < 0.05, ** = p value < 0.01, *** = p value < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney 
test (A), Welch’s unequal variance t-test (B, D, F) or Kaplan-Meier Analysis (C, E). NS = 
not significant. Error bars shown represent S.E.M.
