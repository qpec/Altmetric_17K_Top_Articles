Abstract
Background: physical activity promotes healthy aging. However, little is known about the relationship between physical
activity levels and healthy and chronic disease-free life expectancy (LE). The study aim was to examine healthy and chronic
disease-free LE between ages 50 and 75 and across various levels of physical activity by sex and different occupational
statuses.
Methods: overall, 34,379 women (mean age 53.2 (SD 2.9) years) and 8,381 men (53.6 (SD 3.2) years) from the Finnish
Public Sector study were categorized into five physical activity levels (inactive to vigorously active) according to self-
reported physical activity and into three occupational statuses at the first observation point. Partial LE between ages 50 and
75 based on discrete-time multistate life table models was defined using two health indicators: healthy LE based on self-
rated health and chronic disease-free LE based on chronic diseases. The average follow-up time for health indicators was
6.8 (SD 5.2) years.
Results: a clear dose–response relationship between higher physical activity levels and increased healthy and chronic
disease-free LE in men and women, and within occupational statuses was found. On average, vigorously active men and
women lived 6.3 years longer in good health and 2.9 years longer without chronic diseases between ages 50 and 75 com-
pared to inactive individuals. The difference in years in good health between vigorously active and inactive individuals was
the largest in individuals with low occupation status (6.7 years).
Conclusion: higher levels of physical activity increase healthy and chronic disease-free years similarly in men and women,
but more among persons with low than with high occupational status.
Keywords: health expectancy, physical activity, occupational status, chronic diseases, older people
Introduction
Physical inactivity is recognized as one of the leading modifi-
able risk factors for global disease [1, 2] and economic [3]
burden. It is thus evident that by being physically active the
risk of several chronic diseases [4–6], functional limitations
[7], and premature death [8] can be reduced. As people live
longer than ever, the ultimate goal is to increase healthy years
of life [9]. Health expectancy is a useful summary measure of
a population’s health that expresses the average number of
years that a person can expect to live in ‘full health’ by taking
into account years lived less than full health due to disease
and/or disability. As health expectancy captures both the
‘quantity’ and the ‘quality’ of lived years by considering simul-
taneously both health and mortality [10], it is more inform-
ative than life expectancy (LE) alone and allows comparing
proportion of life spent in good health across different popu-
lation groups.

 Characteristics of healthy lifestyle, including physical
activity, have been shown to contribute to longer LE and
more years in good health [11–15]. However, only few
studies have examined the association between physical
activity levels and health expectancy. Studies to date, based
on various physical activity assessment methods and health
expectancy indicators in different adult cohorts, have shown
that the recommended physical activity level is associated
with more years with good self-rated health [16], and more
years without disabilities [17], cardiovascular disease [11, 18],
and diabetes [19] compared to low physical activity level.
However, a steep gradient between leisure-time physical activ-
ity and socioeconomic status has been observed so that
leisure-time physical activity, specifically vigorous leisure-time
physical activity, is less prevalent among people with lower
socioeconomic position [20]. Because there are major inequal-
ities in health expectancy by socioeconomic position [10],
there is a need to examine the extent to which the association
between physical activity levels and health expectancy varies
by socioeconomic status.
The objective of this study was to examine health
expectancies between ages 50 and 75 across inactivity to
vigorous physical activity in men and women, and in vari-
ous occupational statuses in a large prospective occupa-
tional cohort from Finland. Health expectancy was defined
using two different health indicators: healthy LE based on
self-rated health and chronic disease-free LE based on
chronic diseases.
Methods
Participants
The data is derived from five study waves of the Finnish
Public Sector study (FPS). The FPS study, established in
1997/1998, comprises all 151,901 employees with ≥6 month
job contract in any year from 1991/2000 to 2005 in 10 towns
and 5 hospital districts in Finland. Survey data have been col-
lected by repeated surveys in 4-year intervals on all 103,866
cohort members, who were at work in the participating orga-
nizations during the surveys in the years 1997/1998 (wave 1,
response rate 70%), 2000/2001 (wave 2, 68%), 2004 (wave 3,
66%), 2008 (wave 4, 71%) and 2012 (wave 5, 69%). Follow-
up survey data of the respondents who had retired or left the
organizations were collected in 2005 (wave 3, response rate
68%), 2009 (wave 4, 64%) and 2013 (wave 5, 65%). The FPS
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital
District of Helsinki and Uusimaa.
Overall, 84,848 participants responded to the survey ques-
tionnaire at least once (response rate 82%). For the analysis,
we used data from 42,760 participants who were aged 50–75
years at the first observation point for which also a valid data
on physical activity and occupational status was available. The
first observation point, in which a participant was aged 50–75
years, was the study wave 1 for 5,175 participants, study wave
2 for 13,003 participants, study wave 3 for 9,182 participants,
study wave 4 for 8,085 participants, and study wave 5 for
7,315 participants. Overall 74% of the participants (n = 31,810)
had health indicator data from > 1 study waves. On average,
participants provided health indicator data from 2.5 (SD 1.2)
study waves with the average of 6.8 (SD 5.2) years between
the first and last observation point. Participants mortality was
followed via linked register data until 31 December 2013 or
until they reached the age of 76 years.
Demographic characteristics
Age, sex, and occupational title of the participants at the
first observation point were obtained from the employers’
registers.
Occupational
status,
an
indicator
of
socio-
economic position, was derived from occupational titles
according to the Classification of Occupations by Statistics
Finland and categorized to high (e.g. physicians, teachers),
intermediate (e.g. registered nurses, technicians) and low
(e.g. maintenance workers, cleaners).
Measurement of physical activity
Physical activity was assessed with a questionnaire at the first
observation point. The responders were asked to estimate their
average weekly hours of physical activity/exercise (including
both leisure-time and commuting activity) within the previous
year in walking, brisk walking, jogging, and running, or activ-
ities of equivalent intensities [21]. Each intensity level had five
response alternatives of which the class mid-points were used
for the calculation of time spent in physical activity: no activity,
less than 0.5 h (15 min used for calculation), ~1 h (45 min),
2–3 h (2.5 h) and ≥4 h/week (5 h). The time spent on activity
at each intensity level in hours per week was multiplied by the
average energy expenditure of each activity, expressed in meta-
bolic equivalent (MET). For example, walking, brisk walking,
jogging and running corresponded to 3.5, 5, 8 and 11 METs,
respectively [22]. The volume of physical activity was quantified
as MET-hours per week.
The participants were categorized into five physical
activity levels according to their volume of physical activ-
ity at the first observation point: inactive participants
(physical activity < 7 MET-h/week), and participants hav-
ing low (≥7 to < 14 MET-h/week), moderate (≥14 to < 30
MET-h/week), high (≥30 to < 60 MET-h/week) and vigor-
ous (≥60 MET-h/week) activity levels.
Outcome measures
Self-rated health
The participants were asked to rate their general health sta-
tus at each observation point. The response alternatives
were very good, good, average, fair and poor, from 1 to 5,
respectively. Responses were dichotomized by categorizing
response scores 1–2 as good health and scores 3–5 as sub-
optimal health. Health expectancy indicator based on self-
rated health is named as healthy LE.

 Chronic diseases
Presence of the following chronic diseases was ascertained
at each observation point by asking ‘has a doctor ever told
you that you have …’: heart disease (heart attack, coronary
heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure or other heart
problems); stroke (stroke or transient ischemic attack);
chronic lung disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema or
asthma); cancer (cancer or a malignant tumor of any kind
except skin cancer); and diabetes (diabetes or high blood
sugar). Individuals were defined as having a chronic disease
if they reported ‘yes’ to one or more of these conditions.
The presence of chronic diseases the first observation point
included any chronic diseases reported before the age of 50
from available information on respondents. Health expect-
ancy indicator based on chronic diseases is named as
chronic disease-free LE.
Mortality was ascertained from linked register data from
the Finnish Population Register Center with a follow-up
censored on 31 December 2013, i.e. the year in which data
collection last took place.
Statistical analyses
We applied multistate models to longitudinal data to obtain
transition probabilities between health states. Discrete-time
multistate life table models were used to estimate partial LE
and health expectancies between ages 50 and 75 (period of
26 years). The analyses were conducted for both indicators
of health expectancy. For healthy LE, there were four pos-
sible transitions between the health states, namely: healthy
to sub-optimal health (onset), sub-optimal health to healthy
(recovery), healthy to dead, and sub-optimal health to dead.
For chronic disease-free LE, there were only three possible
transitions as, by definition, recovery was not possible.
The age-specific transition probabilities by sex, occupa-
tional status and physical activity levels were estimated from
multinomial logistic models with age (in years), sex and
occupational status as covariates. Partial LE, healthy LE
and chronic disease-free LE between ages 50 and 75 were
then calculated based on these estimated transition prob-
abilities using a stochastic (microsimulation) approach [23].
Individual trajectories for a simulated cohort of 100,000
persons were generated with distributions of covariates at
the starting point based on the observed prevalence by 5
years age group, sex, occupational status and level of phys-
ical activity. Partial LE, healthy LE and chronic disease-free
LE between ages 50 and 75 were then calculated as the
average from these trajectories for men and women and for
different occupational statuses by physical activity levels.
Computation of 95% confidence intervals (CI) (from 2.5th
and 97.5th percentiles) for these multistate life table esti-
mates was performed using a bootstrap method with 500
replicates for the whole analysis process (multinomial ana-
lysis and simulation steps).
All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.2 using the SPACE
(Stochastic Population Analysis of Complex Events) program
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/space.htm) [23]. This
program uses the stochastic (i.e. microsimulation) approach
to estimate health expectancy as opposed to another well-
known program, IMaCh (Interpolation of Markov Chains)
which uses a deterministic approach [24].
Results
Characteristics for men and women at the time of the first
observation are shown in Table 1. Overall 42% of men and
27% of women were categorized with high occupational sta-
tus, and 34 and 17% with low occupational status, respect-
ively. At the first observation point every third men and
women rated their health sub-optimal and a quarter had at
least one chronic disease. A fifth of men and 17% of women
were categorized as being inactive, and 10 and 6% for vigor-
ous activity levels, respectively. There was no difference in
high and vigorous activity levels by occupational status, but
physical inactivity was more common among low (24%) than
high occupational group (15%). Also the mean level of phys-
ical activity was lower in the low occupational group (24.8
(SD 24.9) MET-h/week) compared to high occupational
group (25.6 (SD 21.7) MET-h/week) (P = 0.005).
Table 2 shows the estimates for partial LE, healthy LE
and, for the difference between partial LE and health LE,
that is, sub-optimal LE between ages 50 and 75 by sex,
occupational status and physical activity levels. There was a
clear dose–response relationship between higher physical
activity level and increased healthy years for both men and
women; the vigorously active men lived 6.7 years and vigor-
ously active women 5.8 years longer in good health com-
pared to inactive men and women. The proportion of years
in good health was 79% among men and 78% among
women who engaged in vigorous activity, whereas inactive
men spent only 54% and inactive women 56% of years in
good health (Appendix 1A available in Age and Aging
online). Within all occupational statuses, there was a dose–

 response relationship between physical activity levels and
proportion of healthy life. The higher the status, the larger
proportion of life was spent in good health at each level of
activity (Appendix 1B available in Age and Aging online).
The difference in years in good health between vigorously
active and inactive individuals was smallest for individuals
with high occupational status (4.4 years) and largest for
individuals with low occupational status (6.7 years).
Results for the estimated partial LE, chronic disease-free
LE, and LE with chronic diseases between ages 50 and 75
by sex, occupational status and physical activity levels are
shown in Table 3. A graded relationship of more years
without chronic diseases with higher physical activity levels
was observed for both men and women. Vigorously active
men lived 3.3 years and vigorously active women 2.7 years
longer without chronic diseases compared to inactive men
and women. Increase in physical activity level from inactiv-
ity to vigorous extended the proportion of life spent with-
out chronic diseases from 46 to 57% among men and from
48 to 57% among women, respectively (Appendix 2A avail-
able in Age and Aging online). The difference in chronic
disease-free LE between vigorously active and inactive
individuals
was
similar
within
occupational
statuses
(Appendix 2B available in Age and Aging online).
Discussion
This study examined how physical activity level was asso-
ciated with healthy and chronic disease-free LE between
ages 50 and 75. We found a clear dose–response relation-
ship between higher physical activity levels and longer
healthy and chronic disease-free LE. The vigorously active
individuals (men and women) lived 6.3 years longer in good
health and 2.9 years longer without chronic diseases than
inactive individuals between ages 50 and 75 although the
difference in partial LE between vigorously active and
inactive individuals was only one year. Our findings are in
line with the previous studies showing that high physical
activity levels extend years in good health compared to low
activity levels [11, 16–19]. In contrast to earlier studies,
physical activity was quantified as MET-h/week and then
categorized according to the limits and multiplies of the
current physical activity recommendations [25]. This group-
ing enabled us to include also inactive individuals far below

 the current physical activity recommendations to the ana-
lysis and thus examine more detailed dose–response rela-
tionship between physical activity levels and healthy and
chronic disease-free LE in a very large cohort of middle-
aged and older individuals.
Other novelties of our study include the estimation of
health expectancy by physical activity levels in individuals hav-
ing different occupational statuses. We found a clear dose–
response relationship between higher levels of physical activity
and healthy and chronic disease-free LE within occupational
statuses. In concordance with earlier research [10], at each
level of activity, healthy LE was the shorter the lower the sta-
tus was. However, our findings showed that the additional
benefit of higher levels of physical activity on healthy LE was
most notable in the low status jobs (e.g. maintenance workers,
cleaners), 6.7 years, and least notable in high status jobs (e.g.
physicians, teachers), 4.4 years. Low occupational status associ-
ates with high occupational physical activity [20], but unlike
leisure-time physical activity occupational physical activity
often consists of monotonous movements and prolonged
activity without sufficient recovery breaks and has been shown
to result with reduced cardiovascular health and more muscu-
loskeletal problems [26]. Therefore, according to our findings
people with low occupational status would particularly gain
more healthy life years by increasing leisure and/or commut-
ing physical activity. Compared to healthy LE, the differences
between vigorously active and inactive individuals for chronic
disease-free LE were smaller and more similar within and
between occupational statuses. The smaller differences for
chronic disease-free LE than for healthy LE could be due to
fact that self-reported health is a more holistic measure of
health than presence of chronic diseases.
The present study extends the findings which have shown
that physical activity associates with reduced prevalence of
chronic diseases [6] and lowered mortality risk [8] in a dose–
response manner. As physical activity improves endurance
and strength [27], prevents falls [28] and reduces disability
[29], and cognitive decline and dementia [30] among older
people, engagement to physical activity and avoidance of sed-
entary time are the key tools to promote healthy aging.
Major strength of this study is that it is based on a large
prospective cohort study with high response rate and multiple
measurements of self-rated health and chronic diseases over a
long follow-up period. The use of microsimulation to estimate
healthy LE and chronic disease-free LE provides internally
consistent results. However, the study also has some

Physical activity level as a predictor of healthy and chronic disease-free life expectancy

 limitations that should be acknowledged. The use of self-
reported data on (combined leisure and commuting) physical
activity and for the outcome measures may lead to both
reporting and classification bias. However, self-reported phys-
ical activity data are frequently used to study prevalence of dif-
ferent physical activity levels in large populations [31]. We
could not exclude the possibility of reverse causality that low
physical activity at the first observational point was a result of
chronic disease(s). Also we did not measure physical job
exposure or occupational physical activity, thus we were not
able to examine the role of occupational physical activity on
the health expectancy outcomes. Another limitation is the use
of only five chronic health conditions, namely, heart disease,
stroke, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes, to estimate
chronic disease-free LE, leaving, e.g. musculoskeletal disorders
out of the analysis. In addition to self-rated health and dis-
eases, functional status is an important outcome among older
adults, thus, there is call for further studies examining the asso-
ciation between physical activity levels and disability-free LE.
The results of this study are based on microsimulation and
transition probabilities and not direct observation of LE or
transitions. Also due to the chosen statistical approach other
lifestyle factors (such as obesity, diet or smoking) which could
confound the relationships shown were not controlled for in
the analysis. Finally, in our study the LE analyses were limited
to ages between 50 and 75. Therefore, more studies in older
age groups are needed to conclude of the relationship between
physical activity levels and health expectancy in older people.
Conclusion
Higher physical activity levels are associated with longer
healthy and chronic disease-free LE between ages 50 and
75 in a dose–response manner. On average, vigorously
active men and women lived 6.3 years longer in good health
and 2.9 years longer without chronic diseases than inactive
individuals. Increased healthy and chronic disease-free years
by physical activity levels was seen within occupational sta-
tuses. The difference in years lived healthy between vigor-
ously active and inactive individuals was most remarkable in
persons with low occupation status.
Key points
• Because people live longer than ever, the ultimate goal is
to increase healthy years of life.
• Higher physical activity levels associate with longer healthy and
chronic disease-free life expectancy between ages 50 and 75.
• The benefit of higher levels of physical activity on healthy life
expectancy was most notable in people with low status jobs.
