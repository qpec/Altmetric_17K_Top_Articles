abstract
CONTEXT: Learning problems are common, affecting up to 1 in 10 children. Refugee children 
may have cumulative risk for educational disadvantage, but there is limited information on 
learning in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on educational outcomes and learning problems in refugee 
children and to describe their major risk and resource factors.
DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language articles addressing the prevalence and determinants of 
learning problems in refugee children.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and analyzed according to Arksey and O’Malley’s 
descriptive analytical method for scoping studies.
RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included. Refugee youth had similar secondary school 
outcomes to their native-born peers; there were no data on preschool or primary school 
outcomes. There were limited prevalence data on learning problems, with single studies 
informing most estimates and no studies examining specific language disorders or 
autism spectrum disorders. Major risk factors for learning problems included parental 
misunderstandings about educational styles and expectations, teacher stereotyping and low 
expectations, bullying and racial discrimination, premigration and postmigration trauma, 
and forced detention. Major resource factors for success included high academic and life 
ambition, “gift-and-sacrifice” motivational narratives, parental involvement in education, 
family cohesion and supportive home environment, accurate educational assessment and 
grade placement, teacher understanding of linguistic and cultural heritage, culturally 
appropriate school transition, supportive peer relationships, and successful acculturation.
LIMITATIONS: Studies are not generalizable to other cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a summary of published prevalence estimates for learning 
problems in resettled refugee children, highlights key risk and resource factors, and 
identifies gaps in research.

BACKGROUND
Conceptual Framework and 
Terminology
Learning problems are common, 
affecting up to 1 in 10 children.1 
They may reflect impairments in 
intellect, difficulties in a specific 
learning domain, behavioral 
problems, or difficulties in social 
interaction; comorbidities are 
common.1 Bioecological system 
theory recognizes that a child’s 
development occurs in the context of 
interactions between different layers 
of their “ecology” (eg, individual 
attributes, caregivers, family, school, 
community, society).2 Integrating 
this bioecological perspective 
with neurocognitive research 
provides an understanding that 
learning problems arise from the 
interaction of neurodevelopmental 
predispositions with environmental 
factors and life experience in a 
dynamic process.3 This perspective 
acknowledges both risk factors 
for failure and resource factors 
that contribute to developmental 
resilience, 
1, 
3 and it recognizes that 
the expression (and experience) of 
learning problems will vary across 
the life span and between individuals, 
communities, and societies.1, 
3
For clarity of reporting, we use 
contemporary clinical categories 
from developmental pediatrics to 
describe the prevalence of learning 
problems and broad categories to 
describe their determinants (negative 
risk factors and positive resource 
factors). We use the term refugee-
background to describe children 
granted humanitarian protection or 
seeking asylum and children from 
refugee-like backgrounds who have 
migrated through other channels 
(eg, family reunion).
Refugee Children and Learning
In 2015, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
reported the highest numbers of 
forcibly displaced people ever 
recorded.4 Globally, there are 
currently almost 60 million displaced 
people, including 13.9 million people 
newly displaced in the past year, 
19.5 million refugees, and 1.8 million 
people who have lodged claims for 
asylum.4 More than half of refugees 
are children, and the number 
of unaccompanied or separated 
children seeking asylum is the 
highest since records began 
(34 300 in 2014).4
Learning and development are 
particular concerns for children of 
refugee background.5 Displacement 
has long-lasting effects on children 
and caregivers, often involving 
exposure to trauma and disruption 
of family structures.6 Relocation 
brings additional stressors, as 
families negotiate their needs 
within foreign social structures and 
with limited supports.6 Within this 
complex dynamic, a child enters a 
new educational environment and 
must negotiate multiple transitions, 
including transitions in family, 
friendships, schooling, community, 
language, culture, and identity.6 
Although educational success is 
critical to overall well-being in 
refugee children, 
6 there are limited 
data on educational outcomes or 
learning problems in this group. 
Understanding learning problems 
and educational needs is essential 
to respond to the increasing 
populations of forcibly displaced 
children and families.
The aim of this study was to review 
evidence on educational outcomes 
and learning problems among 
refugee children, to describe major 
risk and resource factors, and 
to highlight areas for additional 
investigation.
METHODS
We completed a systematic review 
by using the search, selection, 
extraction, analysis, and reporting 
methods described by Arksey and 
O’Malley’s framework for scoping 
studies.7, 
8
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were broad, in keeping with the 
study question and scoping review 
methods. We included studies 
if they involved interventional, 
observational, or qualitative studies 
relating to the prevalence or 
determinants of learning problems 
in children of refugee background, 
available in English. We defined 
“determinants” as any demographic, 
individual, family, school, or other 
factors reported to be associated with 
learning problems or educational 
outcomes. We excluded single case 
reports and non–peer-reviewed 
papers.
Data Sources
We completed searches of Medline, 
Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
and Education Resources Information 
Center (ERIC) in January 2015 (see 
Supplemental Information), with the 
support of a research librarian for 
the time period 1996 through 2015 
(Table 1). In addition, we searched 
key websites, reviewed reference 
lists, and contacted people through 
refugee health networks in Canada 
and Australia.

Data Extraction and Synthesis
We systematically extracted data 
using a standardized data charting 
form, which included information 
on study type, location, population, 
research methods, outcome 
measures, and key findings.
We adopted Arksey and O’Malley’s 
descriptive analytical method 
for data analysis and reporting, 
7 including numerical summary of 
included studies to describe the 
current state of the literature and 
narrative synthesis of findings 
using broad categories to describe 
educational outcomes, learning 
problems, and important risk and 
resource factors.
RESULTS
Database searches retrieved 2454 
results: Medline 365, Embase 
511, CINAHL 278, PsycINFO 543, 
ERIC 601, and PubMed 156. After 
exclusion of duplicates and addition 
of 49 records from other sources, 
2021 articles were identified for 
screening. Two investigators (H.R.G., 
R.S.M.) independently screened all 
titles and abstracts according to 
predefined inclusion criteria, then 
reviewed 98 full-text papers for 
inclusion. Thirty-four articles were 
included in the final analysis (Fig 1, 
Table 2).
Summary of Included Studies
Overall, 34 studies reported on 
learning problems in 29 cohorts of 
refugee children; half (17/34) were 
published since 2010 (Table 3, Fig 2). 
The majority (25/34, 74%) reported 
results from cohorts in Australia 
(11 studies), the United States (7 
studies), or Canada (7 studies), with 
only 1 study from a low- or middle-
income country (Thailand). Studies 
included participants from diverse 
regions of origin, and 14 (41%) 
included mixed cohorts of children 
from multiple regions. Most studies 
(30/34, 88%) reported on adolescent 
refugees, with 13 studies including 
primary school–age children and a 
single study on preschool children. 
Twenty (59%) studies used 
quantitative (or mixed) methods and 
reported on educational outcomes 
(n = 8), prevalence of learning 
problems (n = 14), and risk and 
resource factors (n = 9); the 
remaining 14 (41%) studies used 
qualitative methods and reported on 
risk and resource factors.
Educational Outcomes
Eight studies reported educational 
out 
comes for refugee children, 
all at secondary school 
level10, 
18, 
23, 
28, 
30, 
33, 
35, 
40 (Table 4). 
Six studies from North America 
and Europe reporting on 1197 
refugee-background youth from Sub-
Saharan and North Africa, Eastern 
Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Latin 
America found they had similar 
educational outcomes to their peers, 
including similar rates of high school 
completion (although often at an 
older age).10, 
18, 
30, 
33, 
35, 
40 One study 
of 19 unaccompanied minors who 
migrated to the United States from 
Sudan reported superior performance 
to peers, with 100% high school 
completion and 79% progression 
to college.28 Conversely, a study 
involving 102 youth who migrated 
from North Korea to South Korea 
reported lower academic performance 
relative to native-born peers.23
Prevalence of Learning Problems
Fourteen studies provided prevalence 
data on developmental or learning 
problems in children of refugee back-

language impairment, dyscalculia, or 
dyslexia.

A single Australian study reported 
on the prevalence of sensory 
impairment (vision, hearing) and 
developmental delay in a mixed 
cohort of 332 children attending 
a refugee health clinic: 7.5% had 
a visual impairment, 3.3% had a 
hearing impairment, and 6.9% 
had developmental delay, most 
commonly language (5.7%) or gross 
motor (2.1%).24
Two studies from the United States20 
and Sweden14 provided information 
on intellectual impairment, using 
cognitive testing to investigate the 
impact of trauma on intelligence. 
These studies reported that among 
more than 400 Iraqi-background 
and African American adolescents, 
half (49.4%–56.3%) had low or 
borderline IQ scores on the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scales for Children 
(WISC). Mean IQ for the US cohort 
was 84 points (WISC, Fourth Edition 
[WISC-IV]), 
20 consistent with 
WISC-IV results for African American 
and other minority populations in the 
United States.20

identified through behavioral 
profiles (especially “externalizing 
problems”) and adverse educational 
outcomes;31 however, this 
association was not found in a 
similar adolescent cohort (n =

“Internalizing problems” (ie, anxious, 
depressive, and overcontrolled 
behavior) were more common 
than “externalizing problems” 
(ie, aggressive, hyperactive, 
noncompliant, and undercontrolled 
behavior).16, 
17, 
23, 
25, 
34, 
39, 
 However, 
there is considerable variation in 
prevalence estimates, with some 
studies reporting no difference to 
peers29, 
30, 
41 and multiple studies 
finding marked variation between 
self-report, teacher report, and 
parent report.16, 
25, 
29,

41
One study examined the prevalence 
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), involving 80 
Middle Eastern refugee children 
and adolescents in Sweden.14 There 
was high prevalence of ADHD 
in students whose parents had 
experienced trauma (65% male, 
30% female) but low prevalence 
in those whose parents had not 
(5% male, 10% female).14 Most 
(90%) children with ADHD also met 
criteria for posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD); and lower IQ was 
a risk factor for both ADHD and 
PTSD.14
Two studies reported on the 
prevalence of oppositional defiant 
disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/
CD).10, 
14 In the Swedish cohort 
of adolescent Iraqi refugees, the 
prevalence of ODD/CD was 7.5% 
in those whose parents had been 
exposed to trauma and 0% in 
those whose parents did not have 
trauma exposure.14 A US study of 
144 Khmer adolescents found 30% 
had been reported at school for 
misconduct (eg, carrying a weapon, 
physical assault, swearing, stealing) 
and that misconduct was associated 
with higher exposure to trauma, 
male gender, and lower academic 
outcomes.10 The Khmer cohort had 
high levels of premigration trauma 
(99%), clinical depression (63%), 
and PTSD (33%).10

Risk and Resource Factors
Twenty-five of the 34 studies (73.5%) 
provided qualitative information on 
determinants of learning in refugee 
children. We describe major risk 
and resource factors by using broad 
categories: individual child and home 
environment, school environment, 
migration and trauma experience, and 
sociocultural environment (Table 6).

Two of the 7 studies reporting 
secondary school outcomes in refugee 
youth found girls achieved higher 
results than boys.10, 
35 However, 
female academic advantage among 
refugee youth was less pronounced 
than among their nonrefugee peers 
and was limited to language subjects 
only.10, 
35 A Canadian study of 91 
refugee youth from 9 countries found 
that younger age at migration, greater 
length of time since resettlement, and 
urban residence were associated with 
better secondary school outcomes.40 
This study found no association 
between self-reported English 
language proficiency and secondary 
school outcomes, 
40 despite Sudanese 
youth reporting English language 
difficulties as a common barrier to 
success.13, 
19, 
36
Three studies reported ethnic 
differences in educational 
outcomes.30, 
31, 
40 A Canadian study 
of 156 refugee children in primary 
school found that children from 
Central America had more severe 
learning difficulties reported by 
teachers than their peers from 
Cambodia and Vietnam, despite 
similar objective academic 
outcomes.31 Qualitative data from 
this study suggested teachers were 
influenced by cultural stereotypes, 
leading them to identify Latino 
children more readily as having 
problems.31 Two studies in 
Canadian secondary schools 
reported lower school failure rates 
for Cambodian-background youth 
(compared with Central American 
youth) (n = 158)30 and superior 
outcomes for Yugoslav compared 
with other refugee-background youth 
(n = 91).40
Six studies reported that Sudanese-
background refugee youth generally 
had high academic aspirations and life 
ambition and that this was an effective 
motivation for success.13, 
19, 
28, 
32, 
36, 
37 
Indeed, their desires to advance their 
education, support relatives and 
8
friends left behind, and help rebuild 
their country were major motivators 
for migration and life.19, 
28, 
32,

Seven studies examined parental 
involvement in the education of 
refugee children.9, 
11, 
12,

Parental support for education was 
identified as a protective factor for 
refugee adolescents.28 However, 
although they valued education 
strongly, parental involvement in

education was limited, with parents 
having little contact with school and 
providing minimal homework help.11, 
12 
Parents and teachers perceived 
learning problems differently, with 
teachers emphasizing language and 
family dynamics whereas parents 
emphasized the cultural gap of 
educational styles and expectations.31 
Parents and teachers both recognized 
the importance of parent–teacher 
communication, 
31 but there were 
frequent misunderstandings about 
education styles, rules, and pathways, 
attributed to different cultural 
expectations and a lack of familiarity 
with education systems.9, 
11, 
12 Three 
studies described the positive effect 
of “gift-and-sacrifice” motivational 
narratives, whereby parents linked 
their struggle with poverty and 
migration to the value of educational 
opportunity.28, 
32, 
37
One large US study found a positive 
association between parental 
education and secondary school 
outcomes.35 However, 2 similar-sized 
Canadian studies found parental 
proficiency in the host country 
language to be more important 
than parental education per se.30, 
40 
These Canadian studies also found 
no association between household 
income and secondary school 
outcomes, suggesting that education 
was prioritized regardless of the 
family’s socioeconomic status.30, 
40 
However, financial stress was 
reported as a major risk factor 
for secondary school dropout by 
unaccompanied minors, who cited 
unique challenges such as obligations 
to earn and send money back to 
family.28
Three studies reported that family 
cohesion and supportive home 
environment were associated with 
better secondary school outcomes 
(particularly for girls).6, 
24, 
30 Two 
studies reported on the association 
between parental physical and 
mental health and secondary school 
outcomes, with 1 finding a positive 
association40 and the other finding no 
association.30
School Environment
Eleven studies reported on 
school transition for refugee 
children.28,

Accurate educational assessment 
and grade placement were major 
determinants of educational 
success11, 
32, 
40 but were often 
inaccurate.31, 
38 Inadequate 
appreciation of a child’s educational 
experience was reported to result 
in inappropriate grade placement 
and expectations13, 
28, 
32, 
36, 
37, 
40 and to 
impair remedial educational efforts.38 
This discrepancy resulted from either 
expectations that were too high (ie, 
failing to account for the impact of 
interrupted education)13, 
36, 
40 
or too low (ie, failing to recognize 
previous learning).28, 
37 Teacher 
ignorance of linguistic heritage 
has resulted in misunderstandings 
(eg, misinterpreting respectful 
whispering as being shy, unsure, 
inattentive, or disrespectful), 
misdiagnosis, and counterproductive 
remediation attempts (eg, group 
reading and public correction creating 
a feeling of inadequacy and reinforced 
withdrawal).11, 
38 Conversely, 
teachers’ understanding of a child’s 
cultural heritage was associated with 
enhanced learning at both primary38 
and secondary11 school level.
Low teacher expectations of refugee-
background children were reported 
to be common in both primary and

secondary schools,

37, 
38 with the 
risk that such expectations would 
become a self-fulfilling prophecy.38 
Refugee-background youth reported 
demotivation from low teacher 
expectations and appreciated 
teachers who believed in them 
and encouraged them to pursue 
challenging academic programs.11, 
28, 
37 
Cultural stereotyping of refugee-
background children by 
teachers was associated with 
prejudiced assessments, 
relationships, expectations, and 
behavior.28, 
31, 
 32, 
37, 
38
Three studies reported on school-
based interventions to facilitate 
school transition for refugee 
children.26, 
27, 
38 These studies support 
the use of intentional transition 
programs, culturally relevant 
classroom techniques (eg, student-
driven gender segregation, student–
student interaction and assistance) 
and explicit attention directed to low 
teacher expectations.26, 
27, 
38 One study 
involving a teacher-as-tutor program 
reported benefits for both students 
(accelerated academic progression) 
and teachers (informed beliefs and 
attitudes), who became allies in 
helping students overcome broader 
educational barriers and challenges.26
Five studies reported on the school 
social environment in relation to 
school success.6, 
11, 
13, 
28, 
37, 
 Refugee 
youth consistently report that 
supportive peer relationships are 
academically protective6, 
11, 
13, 
28, 
37; 
however, difficulty forming such 
relationships is the norm, resulting 
in significant loneliness and 
emotional stress.6, 
13, 
28, 
37 Sport is a 
common locus for successful peer 
relationships, especially for boys, but 
can both encourage and distract from 
academic endeavor.13, 
28, 
37 Cultural 
stereotypes strongly influence 
social relationships, to the academic 
advantage of some and detriment 
of others (eg, African boys may be 
expected to play sports but 
not expected to succeed 
academically).6, 
11, 
28, 
37
Six studies found that overt 
personal racism, bullying, and 
abuse were common, and more 
subtle discrimination was the 
norm for refugee children and 
adolescents, and this discrimination 
negatively affected their educational 
experience.6, 
9, 
11, 
19, 
28, 
32, 
37 Adolescents 
reported feeling identified primarily 
by their appearance (especially skin 
color) and having to come to terms 
with “embodying difference, 
” often 
experiencing this “otherness” for the 
first time when arriving at school.37 
Parents of preschool children 
reported differential treatment and 
derogatory race-based language from 
teachers, whereas teachers reported 
exclusion by other children.9
Migration and Trauma Experience
Ten studies reported on 
the impact of trauma on 
learning.10, 
15, 
20–22, 
24, 
30, 
33, 
35, 
41 Three 
studies involving 793 refugee-
background youth from multiple 
countries reported that PTSD 
and exposure to war trauma had 
negligible10, 
35 or positive33 impact on 
school outcomes. Canadian students 
from war zone countries had similar 
academic outcomes to those from 
non–war zone countries, and they 
had higher academic expectations, 
lower truancy, and greater high school 
completion rates than their Canadian 
peers (although often finishing at older 
ages).35 Adolescents from Bosnia–
Herzegovina in Slovenia with greater 
trauma exposure and symptoms of 
PTSD tended to have higher academic 
performance compared with matched 
Slovenian-born peers.33
Conversely, 4 studies involving a 
total of 319 traumatized children and 
adolescents from Cambodia, Iraq, and 
the Middle East found that cognitive 
function was detrimentally affected 
by trauma.15, 
20–22 Daud et al15 
described intergenerational effects 
of trauma on Swedish refugees 
from the Middle East, with children 
of traumatized parents scoring 
lower on cognitive tests despite no 
direct experience of trauma (and 
independent of whether they had 
PTSD). Three studies involving the 
same cohort of 200 Iraqi refugee 
adolescents in the United States 
reported that different types of 
trauma had different effects on 
cognitive testing (WISC-IV).20–22 
“Abandonment trauma” had the 
largest impact on all domains (equal 
for either maternal or paternal 
abandonment), whereas “personal 
identity trauma” (eg, personal 
assault or rape) affected working 
memory, and “survival trauma” 
(eg, life-threatening accident) 
affected processing speed. “Collective 
identity trauma” (eg, genocide or 
discrimination) had no impact on 
cognitive test results, whereas 
“secondary trauma” (eg, parental war 
experience) improved reasoning, 
processing speed, and working 
memory21. “Bullying victimization” 
was associated with lower test scores 
over and above other traumas.22
Two studies involving 302 refugee 
youth from a variety of countries 
reported that parental experience 
in a refugee camp and parental 
separation had no association with 
secondary school outcomes.30, 
40 
Qualitative data from resettled 
Sudanese-background refugee youth 
demonstrated that thoughts of war 
continued to disturb their daily lives, 
including their ability to concentrate 
and learn.19
Although premigration trauma 
is common, there is increasing 
recognition that postmigration 
trauma is also common and may 
have greater impact on both 
learning10, 
30, 
35, 
41 and cognitive 
function.15, 
20–22 Postmigration 
trauma exposure was a significant 
predictor for behavior problems 
and academic failure in a cohort of 
Khmer adolescents in the United 
States, whereas premigration 
trauma exposure did not correlate 
with behavioral or educational 
outcomes.10 The Australian refugee 
health clinic study found that current

or past mandatory immigration 
detention was a significant predictor 
for learning and psychological 
difficulties among newly arrived 
children.24
Sociocultural Environment
Three studies reported better 
primary and secondary school 
outcomes among refugee children 
with greater levels of successful 
acculturation (whereby there is 
selective adoption of new country 
culture while maintaining a strong 
connection with culture and country 
of origin).28, 
30, 
31
DISCUSSION
Our review of educational outcomes 
and learning problems in refugee-
background children highlights the 
complexity of examining learning 
in refugee children and identifies 
important gaps in the literature. 
Overall, there are limited data 
on the prevalence of learning 
problems in refugee children, with 
single studies informing most of 
the estimates. There are almost no 
studies describing children resettled 
in developing countries, despite 
the fact that 86% of refugees live in 
developing countries.4
Most studies examined outcomes 
in adolescent cohorts, there were 
few studies on primary school 
aged children and only a single 
study involving preschool children, 
which is concerning given the 
importance of early identification for 
effective intervention.43 Notably, no 
studies reported the prevalence of 
autism spectrum disorder, despite 
higher rates in other immigrant 
populations44–47 and a postulated 
association with low vitamin D 
levels, 
48 which is well described 
in resettled refugee populations.49 
Similarly, there were no studies on 
language impairment, dyscalculia, or 
dyslexia, and only 1 study examined 
any contribution from sensory 
impairment. Only 1 study examined 
the prevalence of ADHD, although 
these authors highlighted the overlap 
in ADHD and PTSD symptoms, which 
is an area of particular diagnostic and 
therapeutic uncertainty. The majority 
of studies were cross-sectional; 
the lack of longitudinal data is 
a significant limitation, because 
learning outcomes and contributing 
factors may change over time (both 
positively and negatively).
Implications for Practice
Despite significant data gaps, our 
review has important implications 
for health professionals, educators, 
refugee support agencies, and 
policymakers.
First, children of refugee background 
should be expected and supported to 
achieve school outcomes comparable 
to those of their peers. Despite 
limited data on the preschool or 
primary school population, evidence 
suggests refugee-background youth 
have similar pass rates, completion 
rates, and grade point averages to 
their peers.10, 
18, 
28, 
30, 
33, 
35, 
40
Population data from other 
immigrant populations have often 
shown an academic advantage for 
migrants compared with native-born 
peers after adjusting for variables 
such as socioeconomic status, the 
so-called immigrant paradox.50, 
51 
Although the data on refugee-
background children are insufficient 
to draw similar conclusions, many 
of the same resource factors apply: 
strong family ties (although a 
significant minority experience 
family loss or dislocation), 
prioritization of education, “gift-and-
sacrifice” motivational narratives, 
52 
isolation from negative peer and 
social influences, bilingual advantage, 
and possible migration bias toward 
healthier, wealthier, and more 
educated parents.53 This finding 
of academic resilience is echoed in 
reviews on mental health of refugee 
children, 
42, 
54–59 particularly the 
examples of “positive deviance, 
” 
where children have better mental 
health than would be predicted from 
their life experiences and social 
situation.
Evidence on the impact of trauma 
on cognition and school outcomes is 
mixed, with several studies indicating 
that premigration trauma (and 
symptoms of PTSD) has negligible (or 
positive) effects on school outcomes. 
Possible explanations for this effect 
might be survival of past traumatic 
experiences contributing to greater 
resilience (eg, past trauma becoming 
part of individual motivational 
narratives), teachers being more 
supportive to students who display 
signs of PTSD, or survival bias (where 
only the most resilient successfully 
migrate).
Our review identified substantial 
data on educational risk and resource 
factors for refugee-background 
children (Table 6). Major risk 
factors included experience of 
trauma, racism, and bullying; 
parental misunderstandings about 
educational styles and expectations; 
and teacher stereotyping, low 
teacher expectations, and poor 
awareness of linguistic heritage. 
Resource factors included high 
academic and life ambition, parental 
motivational narratives and 
involvement in education, family 
cohesion and supportive home 
environment, accurate educational 
assessment and grade placement,

and resource factors identified in 
our review share commonality to 
those reported in previous reviews 
on resilience in refugee children58 
and the educational needs of refugee 
students.60 It is clear that, although 
premigration experiences do 
influence refugee children’s learning, 
the most important determinants 
of success are located in the 
postmigration context, and many of

Recommendations
Health professionals, educators, 
social support agencies, and 
policymakers all have important 
roles in providing the individual, 
family, community, and structural 
support necessary for refugee-
background children to succeed.
Health professionals must identify 
potential learning problems early 
and work with schools to support 
vulnerable children throughout their 
educational and social transitions. 
Pediatricians have a particular role 
in these areas and should tailor their 
developmental and educational 
assessments to address particular 
risk and resource factors. Alongside 
health screening and medical 
care, this support may include 
contributing to accurate grade 
placement (including age assessment 
where needed), acknowledging 
cultural and linguistic heritage, 
valuing past educational and life 
experience, affirming educational 
aspirations, encouraging parental 
involvement in school, reassuring 
and educating families about 
additional language acquisition, 
encouraging maintenance of 
the families’ first language, and 
explicitly inquiring about learning 
difficulties, racism experience, and 
bullying. Given that some problems 
become apparent only after time 
in mainstream schooling (and 
the dynamic nature of risk and 
resource factors), longitudinal care is 
important. Clinicians need to revisit 
serial screening for school-related 
problems as children and families 
move through their social and 
developmental transitions.6
Educators and schools must provide 
inclusive and culturally safe school 
environments and be aware that 
school represents a major transition 
for refugee-background students 
and their families.60–62 Positive 
supports include dedicated transition 
programs, enhancing teacher 
linguistic and cultural understanding, 
proactively addressing bullying and 
racial discrimination, encouraging 
parental involvement in school, 
incorporating past educational and 
life experiences for appropriate 
grade placement and individualized 
learning plans, and promoting 
appropriately high academic 
expectations. The finding that 
refugee-background students 
experience high levels of school- 
and peer-based racial abuse and 
discrimination is disturbing, and 
this will affect not only learning, but 
health, well-being, and acculturation 
more broadly.6, 
49
Support agencies and policymakers 
must recognize the importance 
of migration transition supports, 
including linguistic and educational 
transition programs. In the early 
postsettlement period, supporting 
access to health professionals and 
educators who are experienced in 
working with refugee-background 
children and families is likely to be 
of benefit, alongside education and 
support for parents to engage with 
their children’s schools.
Researchers also have a role in 
advancing our understanding of 
learning and educational outcomes 
in refugee-background students. Key 
evidence gaps include longitudinal 
assessments of educational and 
vocational outcomes and the 
influence of risk and resource factors 
over time, evaluation of learning in 
preschool and primary school–age 
populations, directed research 
with new population groups, and 
comparative evaluations of resettled 
populations in different countries 
and contexts. Research is also needed 
into the validity of assessment tools 
in refugee-background populations. 
The tools we use to assess 
intelligence, behavior, and social and 
emotional well-being are culturally 
bound, having been developed and 
validated in certain population and 
language groups (usually European 
or North American) and cannot 
be assumed to be valid in other 
populations.63 Although some of 
these tests have been adapted for 
use in other specific populations (eg, 
WISC tests), they are not validated 
for most of the population groups 
who become refugees63 or for use 
with interpreters. Despite these 
obvious limitations, such testing 
may be mandated by education 
systems when learning problems or 
intellectual disability is suspected. 
Clinicians working with refugee 
children often grapple with 
understanding the meaning and 
application of cognitive, behavioral, 
or language assessments and 
deciding which diagnostic labels 
most accurately describe clinical 
presentations. These clinical 
dilemmas highlight the role of 
the developmental history and 
longitudinal care in supporting 
refugee-background students with 
learning problems. Additional 
research is needed to develop 
culturally appropriate assessment 
tools, address language difficulties 
in assessments, and develop a 
nuanced understanding of behavioral 
phenotypes in children of refugee 
background.
Our review has several limitations. 
Although our search strategy 
involved multiple databases, we 
excluded studies that were not 
published in peer-reviewed journals 
and studies that were not available 
in the English language. Inclusion 
criteria required a defined refugee-
background population and excluded 
studies that may have included this 
population but did not identify them 
explicitly (eg, Latino immigrants to 
the United States). This criterion 
was intended to ensure that the data 
better represent forced migration 
rather than immigrant populations 
more generally. Although included 
studies involved children from 
various backgrounds, many findings 
cannot be generalized to other 
refugee-background populations.

Many studies used convenience 
sampling rather than more robust 
selection methods. This limitation is 
due largely to the methodological, 
ethical, and practical challenges of 
working with vulnerable populations 
and remains an ongoing challenge to 
researchers in this field.
CONCLUSIONS
Success at school is critical to well-
being for refugee-background children. 
Published data on educational 
outcomes and learning problems in 
this population are limited, particularly 
for younger children and children 
in low- or middle-income countries. 
Overall, refugee-background children 
should be expected (and encouraged) 
to achieve comparably to their peers. 
Clinicians and educators have an 
important role in identifying risk 
factors and also acknowledging 
the positive resources that refugee 
children and families bring to their 
education and countries of settlement. 
These findings provide practical 
guidance to clinicians and educators 
working with refugee children and 
families, highlight areas for future 
research, and inform interventions and 
policy to support refugee children to 
achieve their developmental potential.
