 Phase 3 Trial of Transplantation
of Human Islets in Type 1 Diabetes
Complicated by Severe
Hypoglycemia
Diabetes Care 2016;39:1230–1240 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-1988
OBJECTIVE
Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and severe hypoglycemic events
(SHEs) cause substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes
(T1D). Current therapies are effective in preventing SHEs in 50–80% of patients
with IAH and SHEs, leaving a substantial number of patients at risk. We evaluated
the effectiveness and safety of a standardized human pancreatic islet product in
subjects in whom IAH and SHEs persisted despite medical treatment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This multicenter, single-arm, phase 3 study of the investigational product purified
human pancreatic islets (PHPI) was conducted at eight centers in North America. Forty-
eight adults with T1D for >5 years, absent stimulated C-peptide, and documented IAH
and SHEs despite expert care were enrolled. Each received immunosuppression and
one or more transplants of PHPI, manufactured on-site under good manufacturing
practice conditions using a common batch record and standardized lot release criteria
and test methods. The primary end point was the achievement of HbA1c <7.0% (53
mmol/mol) at day 365 and freedom from SHEs from day 28 to day 365 after the first
transplant.
RESULTS
The primary end point was successfully met by 87.5% of subjects at 1 year and by
71% at 2 years. The median HbA1c level was 5.6% (38 mmol/mol) at both 1 and 2
years. Hypoglycemia awareness was restored, with highly significant improve-
ments in Clarke and HYPO scores (P > 0.0001). No study-related deaths or disabil-
ities occurred. Five of the enrollees (10.4%) experienced bleeds requiring
transfusions (corresponding to 5 of 75 procedures), and two enrollees (4.1%)
had infections attributed to immunosuppression. Glomerular filtration rate de-
creased significantly on immunosuppression, and donor-specific antibodies de-
veloped in two patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Transplanted PHPI provided glycemic control, restoration of hypoglycemia aware-
ness, and protection from SHEs in subjects with intractable IAH and SHEs. Safety
events occurred related to the infusion procedure and immunosuppression, in-
cluding bleeding and decreased renal function. Islet transplantation should be
considered for patients with T1D and IAH in whom other, less invasive current
treatments have been ineffective in preventing SHEs.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 Hypoglycemia remains a critical limiting
factor in the glycemic management of
patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (1).
Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes im-
pair counterregulatory responses and
hypoglycemia awareness, creating a cy-
cle of more frequent, severe, and some-
times fatal hypoglycemia (1,2). Impaired
awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH), which
is present in 30–40% of patients with
T1D (3,4), confers a threefold to sixfold
increased risk of severe hypoglycemic
events (SHEs) (3,4). One of three Amer-
icans with T1D experiences at least one
SHE each year (5). Recurrent severe hy-
poglycemia interferes with adherence
to strict glycemic control (1) and con-
tributes to substantial morbidity (6).
Structured education, insulin analogs,
and technological interventions, such as
continuous subcutaneous insulin infu-
sion (CSII), real-time continuous glucose
monitoring systems (CGMSs), and sensor-
augmentedinsulinpumpswithlow-glucose
suspend features, can reduce the fre-
quency, severity, and duration of hypogly-
cemia, and are the first-line therapies for
patients with IAH and SHEs (7,8). However,
despite acceptance of an elevated HbA1c
target of ,8.0% (64 mmol/mol) (9), these
interventions are not successful in all pa-
tients (4,10–13). In a recently reported
cohort at a specialist hypoglycemia ser-
vice (10), 50% of patients with T1D and
recurrent SHEs experienced resolution of
SHEs, and 30% subsequently underwent
pancreas or islet transplantation for per-
sistent severe hypoglycemia. Thus, SHEs
persist in some patients despite having
access to all medical interventions and
accepting an elevated HbA1c level of
,8.0% (64 mmol/mol) (as recommended
by the American Diabetes Association
[ADA] in 2012) (9). Even higher glycemic
targets are less effective in preventing
SHEs (11).
The National Institutes of Health estab-
lished the Clinical Islet Transplantation
(CIT) Consortium to evaluate more rigor-
ously the risks and benefits associated
with islet transplantation in T1D (12–
14). Previous trials of islet transplantation
(15), while providing preliminary evi-
dence of benefit, were not considered
adequate for licensure of an islet product.
TheCIT-07trialwasdesignedtobealicense-
enabling multicenter phase 3 clinical
trial of a standardized, well-defined is-
let product, using a stringently defined,
clinically relevant primary end point.
Study participants had T1D of .5 years
duration, and had persistent IAH and
SHEs despite expert management by a di-
abetologist or endocrinologist for at least
1 year prior to study enrollment. In con-
sultation with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (16), this trial was
designed as an uncontrolled, nonrandom-
ized study to avoid randomization of par-
ticipants with a life-threatening condition
to a treatment that had previously been
ineffective in preventing SHEs. Here we
report the primary outcome of the CIT-
07 trial. The full details of the clinical pro-
tocolandthecommonisletmanufacturing

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Oversight
This independently monitored study was
performed in accordance with U.S. FDA
regulations and Good Clinical Practice
Guidelines under a U.S. Investigational
New Drug application for purified human
pancreatic islets (PHPI). Clinical and
manufacturing protocols, end points,
and the statistical analysis plan were de-
veloped by the CIT Consortium with
guidance from the FDA, to serve as a
license-enabling study. The study was
approved by local institutional review
boards and was overseen by an indepen-
dent National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases–sponsored
Data Safety Monitoring Board. Serious
adverse events (SAEs) were reviewed by
site physicians, the Data Coordinating
Center at the University of Iowa, and
the National Institute of Allergy and In-
fectious Diseases medical monitors, who
made the final determination of serious-
ness and attribution. All authors vouch for
the completeness and accuracy of the data
and fidelity to the study protocol.
Study Design and Outcome Measures
This phase 3, prospective, open-label,
single-arm study was conducted at eight
centers in North America. The decision
to design a single-arm trial derived from
ethical concerns about randomizing pa-
tients who had already failed expert
management to continued medical
therapy, during which time they would
be prevented from seeking an islet or
pancreas transplant elsewhere or avail-
ing themselves of any new therapies
that might become available during
the course of the trial; the extremely
low likelihood that individuals meeting
the study entry criteria could spontane-
ously achieve the primary end point
(defined below); and the FDA guidance
that a single-arm trial would be ac-
ceptable as a license-enabling study
(16). The primary end point was the
achievement of an HbA1c level of ,7.0%
(53 mmol/mol), the glycemic goal then
recommended by the ADA (17), at day
365 and freedom from SHEs from day 28
today 365 after the first islet transplant.
This end point was chosen to reflect
the effectiveness of this therapy specif-
ically for the treatment of intractable
IAH and associated SHEs. Key secondary
end points included the achievement of
an HbA1c level of #6.5% (48 mmol/mol),
the target recommended by the Amer-
ican Association of Clinical Endocri-
nologists (18), at 1 year and freedom
from SHEs from day 28 to day 365, in-
dividual components of the composite
end points, and insulin independence
(confirmed by meeting the follow-
ing criteria during a 7-day period with-
out exogenous insulin: HbA1c ,7.0%
[53 mmol/mol], fasting capillary glucose
levels .140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol] three or
fewer times, fasting serum glucose
,126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol], a mixed meal
tolerance test [MMTT] showing serum
glucose ,180 mg/dL [10 mmol] at 90 min,
and at least one serum C-peptide level
[fasting or stimulated] $0.5 ng/mL).
Other efficacy outcomes included
glycemic lability index (LI) (19), hypogly-
cemia score (19), and 72-h glucose pro-
files by use of a CGMS (Medtronic

 Minimed). Safety outcomes included the
incidence of SAEs related to the islet
transplant procedure or immunosup-
pression and the incidence of de novo
anti-HLA antibodies. All aspects of the
study design are consistent with the
FDA guidance document Considerations
for Allogeneic Pancreatic Islet Cell
Products (16).
The first subject consented on 10
October 2008. All subjects reached the
primary end point by 24 September
2012 and the secondary end points by
13 May 2014. We report the primary
and secondary end points, assessed at
day 365, and the results at 2 years after
the initial transplant.
Recipient Selection
Inclusion criteria included the following:
age 18–65 years, T1D for $5 years, ab-
sent stimulated C-peptide, IAH and/
or marked glycemic lability (19,20),
and a history of SHEs in the prior 12
months despite medical care provided
by an endocrinologist or diabetologist,
who asserted that the candidate had
been adherent with respect to office
visits (three or more in the preceding
12 months), self-monitoring of blood
glucose levels (three or more times
daily), and the use of an insulin pump
or administration of three or more in-
jections of insulin daily as prescribed.
Among those subjects deemed eligible,
37 had used CSII, and 21 had used
CGMS. Each patient’s diabetes specialist
confirmed that the patient was unable
to achieve glycemic control without hy-
poglycemic episodes, even when the
HbA1c level was allowed to rise above
7% (53 mmol/mol), and that, in the year
preceding enrollment, each had experi-
enced one or more SHEs, defined as
events with memory loss, confusion, un-
controllable behavior, irrational behavior,
unusual difficulty in awakening, suspected
seizure, seizure, loss of consciousness, or
visual symptoms, during which the sub-
ject was unable to treat himself/herself
and which were associated with either a
blood glucose level of ,54 mg/dL (3.0
mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral
carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or
glucagon administration (2). Exclusion
criteria included the following: BMI
.30kg/m2,weight#50kg,insulinrequire-
ment .1.0 units/kg/day or ,15 units/day,
HbA1c level .10% (86 mmol/mol), mea-
sured glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
,80 mL/min/1.73 m2, history of panel-
reactive anti-HLA antibodies by flow
cytometry, and significant comorbid
conditions.
Donor Selection, Islet Manufacture,
and Islet Transplantation
PHPI were manufactured at the trans-
plant site. The CIT-defined good man-
ufacturing practice process included
standardized lot release criteria and
test methods (21). Pancreata from de-
ceased donors 15–65 years of age were
processed within 12 h of procurement.
Donor exclusion criteria included his-
tory of diabetes, HbA1c level .6% (42
mmol/mol), and donation after cardiac
death status.
Each PHPI lot (dose), containing
.5,000 islet equivalents (IEQ)/kg for
the first dose and $4,000 IEQ/kg for
subsequent doses (if any), was prepared
from a single pancreas (14) and was
transplanted by portal vein infusion.
Access to the portal vein was achieved
percutaneously or by minilaparotomy.
Subjects who were not insulin indepen-
dent at 75 days after the first dose, or
30 days after a second dose, were eli-
gible for a subsequent infusion until

 8 months after the initial transplant. This
left a 4-month interval for stabilization
prior to assessment of the primary end
point.
Other Study Treatments
Induction immunosuppression con-
sisted of rabbit anti–thymocyte globulin
and etanercept (13) for the first trans-
plant, with basiliximab replacing rabbit
anti–thymocyte globulin at subsequent
transplants. Sirolimus and low-dose
tacrolimus were used for maintenance
immunosuppression (12).
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of the primary end point was
based on estimating the true rate of suc-
cess, which was defined as the propor-
tion of subjects in the intention-to-treat
population achieving the primary end
point successfully. An exact one-sided
95% lower confidence bound was com-
puted. The prespecified criterion for effi-
cacy requires that the lower bound
exceed 50%. With 48 transplanted sub-
jects, and if the true rate is at least 70%,
then the power to declare islet transplan-
tation effective is at least 84%. Outcomes
for the intention-to-treat analysis in-
cluded three imputed failures for subjects
who withdrew prior to being evaluated
for the primary end point. Results for
the primary and secondary end points
and 2-year follow-up are presented in
graphical form. Separate pairwise com-
parisons are presented for days 75, 365,
and 730 versus baseline. Signed rank
tests are used for continuous outcomes
and McNemar tests for binary outcomes.
Two-sided P values are adjusted for mul-
tiple comparisons using the Bonferroni
method. Details of study definitions, sub-
ject outcomes, study treatment regimen,
PHPI product, and adverse events can be
found in appendices in the Supplementary
Data. Study data sets are available at
https://www.itntrialshare.org, a public
website managed by the Immune Tol-
erance Network.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the subjects, donors,
donor pancreata, and PHPI doses are
presented in Table 1. The 48 subjects
received 75 PHPI infusions, as follows:
22 subjects (45.8%) received one infu-
sion, 25 (52.1%) received two infusions,
and 1 subject (2.0%) received three in-
fusions. The median total dose was
820,286 IEQ/subject (range 286,565–
1,562,425), with a median of 11,972 IEQ/kg
recipient body weight (range 5,227–
25,553).
Efficacy
Primary and key secondary end point re-
sults are presented in Fig. 1. Forty-two of
48 subjects (87.5% [lower confidence in-
terval boundary 76.8%]) achieved a suc-
cessful primary end point (eradication of
SHEs with excellent glycemic control;
HbA1c level #7% [53 mmol/mol]) (Fig.
1A). Based on the a priori minimum
threshold of 50%, this supports the con-
clusion that islet transplantation is effec-
tive. Similar results were observed for the
key secondary end point, which required
an HbA1c level of #6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
(Fig. 1B).
The proportion of subjects with an
HbA1c level ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol) (Fig.
1C) increased from 40% at baseline to
87.5% at 75 days (P , 0.0003) and to
87.5% at 365 days after the first islet
transplant (P , 0.0003). Median HbA1c
levelsdecreasedfrom7.2%(55mmol/mol)
at baseline to 5.9% (41 mmol/mol) and
5.6% (38 mmol/mol) at days 75 and 365,
respectively (Fig. 1D) (P , 0.0003). All sub-
jects had experienced at least one SHE in
the year prior to enrollment; only 2 of 45
evaluable subjects reported SHEs in the
year after islet transplantation (Fig. 1E
and F) (P , 0.0003). These two subjects
had a total of four SHEs. At the time of the
events, both subjects had evidence of graft
function and were receiving exogenous in-
sulin. In both cases, hypoglycemia aware-
ness had been restored, as evidenced by a
drop in Clarke score from 7 at baseline to 1
at day 365. Both subjects, however, were
documented to be medically nonadherent.
This suggests that these episodes of hypo-
glycemia were due to excessive doses of
exogenous insulin and were not related
to IAH.
Insulin independence was achieved
by 23% of subjects at day 75 and by
52.1% at day 365 (Fig. 2A). Among 25
subjects who were insulin independent
at 1 year, 13 received one islet infusion,
and 12 received two islet infusions. As of
day 730, the median interval without
exogenous insulin among the 25 sub-
jects was 684 consecutive days (range
210–720); 20 of the 48 enrolled subjects
(42%) remained insulin independent
at day 730.
The median insulin use dropped from
0.49 units/kg at baseline to 0.13 units/kg
at day 75 and 0.00 units/kg at day 365
(range 0.00–0.43) (Fig. 2B) (P , 0.0003).
C-peptide levels increased and glucose
levels decreased in response to a MMTT
(Fig. 2C and D) (P , 0.0003). The propor-
tions of subjects with a functioning islet
graft, defined as a basal or stimulated se-
rum C-peptide level .0.3 ng/mL, were
95% and 94% at days 75 and 365, respec-
tively. Measures of hypoglycemia aware-
ness, hypoglycemic events, and glycemic
lability and variability, specifically using
the Clarke score (Fig. 3A), HYPO score
(Fig. 3B), LI (Fig. 3C), and mean amplitude
of glycemic excursions (MAGEs) (Fig. 3D),
all improved significantly (P , 0.0002).
The CGMS demonstrated significant
improvements in mean glucose level,
time within glucose target range of
54–180 mg/dL (3.1–10 mmol/L), time
with glucose ,54 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L),
and other measures of glycemic control
(Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. 1).
At 2 years, 34 of 48 subjects (71%)
successfully achieved the criteria set
for the 1-year primary end point, includ-
ing one subject who failed at year 1 be-
cause of an HbA1c level of 7.3% (56
mmol/mol). Among the nine subjects
who were successful at year 1 but not
transplant and from day 28 to day 365 and day 730 inclusive, after the first islet transplant. Based on diabetologist’s medical report, a McNemar test for
paired binomial outcomes was used to compare the proportion of subjects with at least one severe episode of hypoglycemia at baseline (N = 48) to the
proportion at day 365 (N = 45) and to the proportion at day 730 (N = 42). The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for both
comparisons in order to preserve the overall type I error rate of 0.05. The adjusted P values for both tests are ,0.0002. F: Box plots of the number of

to compare the median number of severe episodes of hypoglycemia between baseline (N = 48) and day 365 (N = 45) and between baseline and day
730 (N = 42). The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for both comparisons in order to preserve the overall type I error rate of

77 mmol/mol). One of the nine subjects
experienced an SHE in year 2. The
estimated probability ofSHE-freesurvival
among evaluable subjects at 2 years
after the initial islet transplant was 93%
(Fig. 3F).
Three subjects (6%) were nonevalu-
able for the primary end point (year 1),
and an additional five subjects were
nonevaluable at 2 years (17% of original
cohort). All were imputed failures in the
study analysis. Two subjects were lost to
follow-up despite repeated attempts at
contact; the loss of one was due to the
failure of the site to renew consent after
1 year; three subjects withdrew consent,

(N = 48). At day 75, insulin independence could not be evaluated for 11 subjects because of insufficient data; these subjects were imputed as failures.
At day 365, insulin independence could not be evaluated for 10 subjects, 8 of whom provided insufficient data and 2 of whom were no longer
enrolled in the study; all of these were imputed as failures. At day 730, insulin independence could not be evaluated for 28 subjects, 22 of whom
provided insufficient data, and 6 of whom were no longer enrolled in the study; all of these were imputed as failures. B: Box plots of daily insulin
usage (units/kilogram/day) at baseline, day 75, day 365, and day 730. The Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired outcomes was used to compare
the median insulin use (measured in units per kilogram of body weight) between baseline (N = 48) and day 75 (N = 45), between baseline and day 365
(N = 44), and between baseline and day 730 (N = 34). The Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for these three comparisons
in order to preserve the overall type I error rate of 0.05 The adjusted P values for these three tests are ,0.0003. C: Box plots of serum C-peptide levels
before (zero minutes) and 60 and 90 min after MMTT was performed at baseline, day 75, day 365, and day 730 after the first islet infusion. The
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the zero minute C-peptide level between baseline (N = 47) and day 75 (N = 46), between baseline and
day 365 (N = 45), and between baseline and day 730 (N = 39). Comparisons between baseline and day 75 and between baseline and day 365 were
performed in a similar manner for the 60-min C-peptide levels as well as the 90-min C-peptide levels. Within each set of three readings, the
Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for the three comparisons made between baseline and day 75, between baseline and
day 365, and between baseline and day 730. The three adjusted P values for each set of readings are ,0.0003. D: Box plots of serum glucose levels
before (zero minutes) and 60 and 90 min after MMTTs performed at baseline, day 75, day 365, and day 730 after the first islet infusion. The Wilcoxon
signed rank test was used to compare the zero minute serum glucose level between baseline (N = 47) and day 75 (N = 46), between baseline and day
365 (N = 45), and between baseline and day 730 (N = 39). Comparisons between baseline and day 75 and between baseline and day 365 were
performed in a similar manner for the 60-min serum glucose levels as well as the 90-min serum glucose levels. Within each set of three readings, the
Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for the three comparisons made between baseline and day 75, between baseline and

col; and one subject wished to take a

Adverse Events
SAEsarereported frominitiationofinduc-
tion immunosuppression to day 365, and
from day 366 to day 730. A complete de-
scription of all SAEs is included in appen-
dices in the Supplementary Data. There
were 30 SAEs in 21 subjects in year 1,
with 22 attributed to the transplant pro-
cedure and/or immunosuppression, and
8 to nonstudy causes. Procedure-related
bleeding events occurred in 5 of 56 per-
cutaneous cannulations of a portal vein,
requiring transfusion and/or surgical in-
tervention. There were no SAEs related
to access by minilaparotomy (19 proce-
dures). Immunosuppression-related
events included cytopenias, abdominal
pain with or without vomiting, toxic
drug levels, adverse drug reactions (ur-
ticaria, serum sickness, cytokine release),
infection, and renal dysfunction. Eight
SAEs occurred in year 2, of which two
were infections attributed to immuno-
suppression, while the remaining
six were not study related. No SAE
resulted in death or disability, and
none required expedited reporting to
the FDA.
The median GFR decreased from
102 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 80–130)
at baseline to 98 mL/min/1.73 m2
at day 75 (P = 0.09, range 42–140),
and to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 at day 365
(P = 0.0008 vs. baseline, range 59–129).
The median GFR for the last available
observation (.2 years, n = 35) was 82
mL/min/1.73 m2 (P , 0.0001 vs. base-
line, range 54–123).
At the 2-year follow up, six subjects
had positive calculated panel reactive
antibody levels of 2%, 14%, 29%, 64%,
74%, and 98%, respectively; the last two
subjects had donor-specific antibodies
(DSAs).
CONCLUSIONS
Despite medical management provided
by a diabetes specialist, none of the par-
ticipating subjects with long-standing
T1D and IAH had maintained HbA1c lev-
els ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol) with the ab-
sence of SHEs in the year prior to study
enrollment. In contrast, 87.5% of study
subjects had an HbA1c level of ,7.0%
(53 mmol/mol) at day 365 and were
free of SHEs from day 28 to day 365 after
their first islet transplant, thus meeting
the composite primary end point of the
study (Fig. 1A). The median HbA1c level
decreased from 7.2% (55 mmol/mol)
pretransplant to 5.6% (38 mmol/mol)
at 1 year post-transplant (Fig. 1B). In
addition, recipients of PHPI showed
highly significant improvements in all
other measures of glycemic control
(e.g., glycemic LI, MAGEs, time within
glucose target range) and also experi-
enced the restoration of hypoglycemia
awareness, as demonstrated by mark-
edly reduced Clarke and HYPO scores
(Fig. 3A and B). Insulin independence,
measured stringently across multiple
parameters, was achieved in 52% of
subjects and with fewer transplants
per subject and smaller doses of islets
than in previous multicenter trials
(14,22,23); it persisted at 2 years in
at least 80% of those who achieved
it by year 1. Subjects experienced 22
study-related SAEs in year 1 and 2
study-related SAEs in year 2. An episode
of acute kidney injury of unclear etiol-
ogy resolved with a substantial de-
crease in the subject’s GFR; no other
study-related SAE resulted in death or
permanent injury. Postprocedural
bleeding occurred in 8.9% of trans-
plants performed by percutaneous
access of the portal vein but in none
of the transplants performed by
minilaparotomy. Immunosuppression-
related events accounted for 43% of
all study SAEs. There was a significant
drop in median iohexol-measured
GFR from study entry to day 75 after
the first islet transplant, followed by
further decreases at days 365 and
730. DSAs developed in few subjects
(2 of 48 subjects [4%]) compared with
other islet and organ transplant studies
(24,25).
These findings demonstrate that
transplantation of human islets was ef-
fective in treating IAH and SHEs in pa-
tients with T1D in whom SHEs had
persisted while under the care of a di-
abetes specialist, using then available
modalities and treatment guidelines ac-
cording to their best judgment. This trial
also shows, in contrast to prior studies
(1), that protection from SHEs can be
achieved without accepting an elevated
HbA1c target. Vascularized pancreas
transplantation, which is generally re-
served for patients needing a simul-
taneous kidney transplant (26), is the
only other intervention capable of
achieving similar results (27,28), but is
uncommonly used in nonuremic T1D pa-
tients (26).
Severe hypoglycemia is a debilitating,
life-threatening complication of T1D
(1,2,6,29) that, in some patients, is re-
fractory to medical treatment (7,8,10).
CSII, real-time CGMSs, and sensor-
augmented insulin pumps with auto-
mated low-glucose insulin suspension
can reduce the incidence of major hy-
poglycemic events (30–32) but do not
restore hypoglycemia awareness or nor-
mal hormonal counterregulation of hy-
poglycemia or eliminate SHEs (7,8).
Meticulous prevention of hypoglyce-
mia (33–35) and structured education
and/or behavioral therapies aimed at
hypoglycemia awareness restoration
(4,36,37) improve the awareness of hypo-
glycemia, hormonal counterregulation
to hypoglycemia, and protection from
SHEs, but 20–30% of patients so treat-
ed have persistent SHEs and IAH, as evi-
denced by elevated Clarke or Gold
scores (4,10,36,37). In addition, their
HbA1c levels remain elevated at 7.8%
(62 mmol/mol) to 8.4% (68 mmol/mol)
(4,10,36,37). Thus, this trial is the first
phase 3 trial to show effectiveness of
Bonferroni method was used to adjust the level of significance for these three comparisons in order to preserve the overall type I error rate of
0.05. The adjusted P value for the comparison between baseline and day 75 is 0.0003. The adjusted P value for the comparison between baseline
and day 365 is 0.0258. The adjusted P value for the comparison between baseline and day 730 is 0.0015. F: Time to first severe hypoglycemic
episode. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function for the time to first severe hypoglycemic episode is shown. Three subjects
experienced SHEs. The first two subjects experienced events beginning prior to day 365 after the initial transplant, and a third subject had
two SHEs between days 365 and 730 after the initial transplant. The time to censoring for subjects who did not experience a SHE was the number
of days between the initial transplant and the date of the last blood sugar diary reading. The median SHE-free survival time is .730 days after the
initial transplant.

 any therapy in restoring both sustained
normoglycemia and protection from SHEs
in patients with long-standing T1D compli-
cated by IAH and recent SHEs. Emerging
diabetes technologies such as next-
generation insulin pumps with predictive
low-glucose management technology
(38) and closed-loop pumps with glucose-
responsive insulin or insulin and glucagon
delivery (39) have not yet been tested in
patients with T1D and problematic hypo-
glycemia; further testing is needed to de-
termine how these interventions compare
with islet transplantation (40).
The clear benefits of islet transplan-
tation must be evaluated in the context
of the associated risks. Serious proce-
dural bleeding occurred in 5 of the 48
subjects (5 of the 75 islet infusions)
performed in this study. The islet prod-
uct stimulated the development of
DSAs in two subjects; this rate of DSA
is low, but these antibodies will pre-
sent a barrier to subsequent transplants
in those affected. All of the other study-
relatedSAEswererelatedto,andexpected
from, the use of immunosuppression.
Of those, the most concerning is the
decrement in renal function, which is
attributable to the use of calcineurin-
inhibiting drugs (36). The drop in GFR
over 2 years was both clinically and
statistically significant. Evaluation of
renal function and of a patient’s ability
to tolerate a decrease in renal func-
tion will be critical in the evaluation
of candidates for islet transplantation.
The immunosuppression-related ad-
verse events in this trial highlight the
need for more specific or tolerogenic
immunomodulatory regimens for trans-
plant recipients. Until such regimens are
developed, islet transplantation will not
be a suitable treatment for the majority
of individuals with T1D. Those who have
IAH and intractable SHEs need to be in-
formed of these risks and, with their phy-
sician, decide whether they wish to accept
them in order to achieve eradication of
SHEs with stable and near-normal glyce-
mic control.
Despite the rigor of many aspects of
this study, it has limitations. The stan-
dards and modalities for treating pa-
tients with IAH and SHEs have evolved
since this study was designed. The ADA
Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes
specified for the first time in 2012 that
less stringent glycemic goals, such as
HbA1c ,8% (64 mmol/mol), may be
appropriate for patients with a history
of SHEs (17). Structured diabetes educa-
tion on flexible insulin therapy and di-
abetes technologies have improved.
Currently, the majority of patients pre-
senting with problematic hypoglycemia
are expected to experience resolution
of severe hypoglycemia with optimal
medical therapy that includes access to
these interventions in a stepped-care
approach (7,8,10). Accordingly, some
of the 48 subjects who were considered
treatment failures at the time of enroll-
ment in this trial, including the 11 who
had not used CSII and the 27 who had
not used a CGMS prior to enrollment,
might well haverespondedtothe medical
and technological interventions now
available. Only patients who continue
to experience SHEs after having com-
pletedastepped-careapproachtopreven-
tion of SHEs, as is currently recommended
(7,8), preferably under the supervision
of a specialist hypoglycemia service or
as part of a clinical trial, should be deemed
unresponsive to medical therapy and thus
be considered for evaluation for islet
transplantation. On the other hand, as dis-
cussed above, even with thebest available
nontransplant interventions ofthecurrent
era, 20–50% of patients with SHEs fail to
achieve the eradication of SHEs (7,10);
thus, islet transplantation is a relevant op-
tion for these patients. We report out-
comes at 1 and 2 years; longer follow-up
of transplanted patients will be needed to
determine whether the benefits associated
with restoration of near-normoglycemia
and protection from SHEs will outweigh
the risks associated with chronic immuno-
suppression. To this end, all study subjects
were offered participation in a long-term
follow-up study.
Some readers may find a single-arm
trial unconvincing. In our view, all avail-
able medical approaches should be
exhausted in treating patients with IAH
and SHEs before resorting to islet
transplantation; a patient who continues
to have SHEs despite having the benefit of
thosetherapiesshouldnotberandomized
to them for the sake of research. Finally,
while the number of unevaluable subjects
(three [6%] at year 1, and a total of eight
[17%] at year 2) did not limit our ability to
evaluate the effectiveness of islet trans-
plantation using prespecified criteria, it
may have led to an underestimation of
the effectiveness of PHPI and/or under-
reporting of adverse events.
This is the first license-enabling trial
of a cellular product for treatment of
T1D demonstrating multisite compliance
with common manufacturing processes
and release criteria. The manufacturing
and clinical data generated in this study
may be cross-referenced for the purpose
of filing a Biologics License Application
with the FDA for PHPI. Product licensure
is important for many reasons, as follows:
first, and most important, it will ensure
the purity, potency, identity, consis-
tency, and safety of the islet product;
second, licensure will provide patient
access (with third-party coverage) to
islet transplantation; and third, con-
tinued research in this area will be
accelerated if third-party coverage is
available to defray the clinical costs.
The standardized procedures estab-
lished in this trial will likely also inform
the development of stem cell–derived
and xenogeneic islet cell therapeutics in
the future (40).
In conclusion, this trial demon-
strates that transplantation of human
islets is an effective treatment for
T1D complicated by IAH and SHEs,
resulting in the restoration of hypo-
glycemia awareness, elimination of
SHEs, and normal or near-normal gly-
cemic control in 87.5% of participants.
Islet transplantation should be consi-
dered for patients with T1D and IAH
in whom a stepped-care approach, in-
cluding current educational, pharmaco-
logical, and technological interventions,
has failed to prevent life-threatening
SHEs.
