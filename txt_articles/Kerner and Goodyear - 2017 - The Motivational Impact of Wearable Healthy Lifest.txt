 Abstract 
Background: Considerable amounts of young people are not meeting physical activity 
guidelines. Wearable fitness devices can provide opportunities for physical activity 
promotion. Purpose: The aim of the study was to explore if wearable healthy lifestyle 
technologies impacted on adolescents (13-14 year) motivation for physical activity. 
Methods: The study was a mixed method sequential design. Participants were 84 adolescents 
(44 girls, 40 boys) from six physical education classes. Pupils were issued with a Fitbit to 
wear for eight weeks and completed pre-post-test questionnaires that assessed motivational 
regulation and psychological need satisfaction. Adolescents also engaged in focus group 
interviews after wearing the Fitbit for eight weeks. Quantitative data was analysed using a 
repeated measures MANOVA to explore differences between gender and time. Qualitative 
data analysis was conducted deductively using self-determination theory. Results: The 
quantitative findings identified significant reductions in need satisfaction and autonomous 
motivation and significant increases in amotivation after eight weeks. Qualitative evidence 
suggested short term increases in motivation through feelings of competition, guilt and 
internal pressure.  Discussion: Findings suggest that wearable technology may have negative 
motivational consequences Translation to Health Education Practice: Educators should 
support young people to personalise health targets in order to critically engage with 
normalised health targets.

 Background 
Studies show that considerable proportions of young people do not meet their national 
physical activity guidelines for daily physical activity1, 2. Approximately 50% of young 
people engage in sufficient physical activity to achieve positive health benefits3. Echoing 
calls of international health and physical activity organisations4 the United Nations, 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization5 recently stressed that substantial action 
was required to address rising levels of youth physical inactivity and the substantial increase 
in associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Health interventions are particularly 
important as they provide the foundation for an active lifestyle6, 7.Schools are suitably 
positioned as a site to promote physical activity, given the staff, equipment, facilities and the 
duration of time young people spend there. Yet, over a number of decades’ physical activity 
interventions targeting young people in schools have only produced modest effects8. Finding 
new ways to motivate young people to be active is, therefore, vital.   
 
Although technology has been associated with physical inactivity9, healthy lifestyle 
technologies, such as wearable ‘fitness’ devices (e.g., Fitbits) and mobile health applications 
(apps) (e.g., Fitbit app or MyFitnessPal) are suggested to provide new and exciting 
opportunities for physical activity  promotion10, 11, 12, 13. It is suggested that access to 
personalised data on physical activity behaviours, and, the ability to track, compare, and 
monitor behaviour has huge potential for impacting on cognitions and emotions, and in turn, 
increasing levels of physical activity14 ,15 ,16 ,17. Given that young people are becoming 
increasingly ‘tethered’ to their mobile devices18, alongside reports that they are increasingly 
turning to technology for health information19, healthy lifestyle technologies should be 
considered as tools to address physical inactivity in young people20, 21.  
 
 While most empirical evidence on healthy lifestyle technologies is based on assessing quality 
and validity22 an emerging evidence-base in young adults demonstrates that commercial 
wearable ‘fitness’ trackers and their associated apps increase physical activity levels and 
impact on motivational constructs of enjoyment, challenge, affiliation and positive health 
motivation23. Young people (age 11-12) have also reported finding features of real-time 
feedback and competition from the commercial Fitbit one wearable device motivating24, 
suggesting that promotion of self-monitoring and goal setting behaviours can increase 
physical activity levels25, 26. Yet the evidence-base on the health-related impact of young 
people’s (age 13-14) uses of healthy lifestyle technologies is limited14, 20, 21. A recent 
systematic review on adolescents and young adults (age 12-25 years) identified only two 
empirical studies that measured the health-related effects of using nutritional or physical 
activity apps21. Further, the limited evidence-base is inconclusive. For example, while a non-
commercial app used with obese patients (age 11-15) resulted in weight reduction and 
improvements to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation27, other nonrandomized interventions (age 
12-25) report no significant differences in diet/nutrition or physical activity behaviours21. In 
an account of young girls (age 11-15) experiences of commercial health apps and wearable 
devices (for example, Popsugar Active or Strava), heightened levels of body dissatisfaction 
were reported14 - a known variable evidenced to impact negatively on physical activity 
behaviours28. Research that determines the health-related impacts of wearable devices and 
apps would contribute to an emerging evidence-base on the role of digital technologies in the 
health of young people. 
 
Self-determination theory  
Self-determination theory is a widely applied theoretical framework in the study of youth 
physical activity29 and has been used to guide understandings on the motivational impact of 
 digital technologies on youth physical activity behaviours30, 31. Self-determination theory 
provides understanding on the initiation and maintenance of physical activity32. The theory 
proposes that in order for individuals to be optimally motivated, behaviours should be self-
determined, or in other words, volitional. Individuals display more self-determined forms of 
motivation as they internalise to a greater degree, reasons for engaging in behaviour, thus 
engage in a behaviour out of interest or for their own sake as oppose to the outcomes of the 
activity. In contrast, behaviours are less self-determined when an activity is undertaken as a 
means to an end that lies outside participation in the activity itself.  More self-determined 
forms of motivation are associated with physical activity adoption and adherence33. 
 
Six different types of motivation are proposed to exist along a continuum ranging from lower 
to higher levels of self-determination34, which can further be divided into autonomous 
motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation35. Autonomous motivation is the most 
self-determined and is a combination of intrinsic motivation (undertaking an activity for the 
inherent pleasure) integrated regulation (undertaking an activity through choice to obtain a 
personal goal) and identified regulation (when the outcome of the behaviour is valued such as 
the health benefits of physical activity).  Thus, autonomous motivation is based on the values 
or personal interests of the individual. In contrast, controlled motivation is less self-
determined and based on demands that are externally or internally posed29, 32. Controlled 
motivation is a combination of introjected regulation (an individual engages in a behaviour to 
avoid guilt or obtain social approval) and external regulation (an individual engages in a 
behaviour to avoid punishment or obtain a reward32. Finally, amotivated is at the end of the 
continuum and is evident when an individual is neither intrinsically nor extrinsically 
motivated, thus, lacks motivation and volition with respect to a particular behaviour36. More 
self-determined forms of motivation lead to positive physical activity outcomes37, thus, youth 
 physical activity programmes should that promote autonomous motivation are 
recommended38.  
 
It is argued that social factors influence self-determined motivation through the satisfaction of 
three psychological needs39.  The three antecedents of competence, autonomy and relatedness 
are proposed to influence an individual’s motivational state.  In order for optimal 
motivational functioning to occur and subsequent positive outcomes, these three 
psychological needs should be satisfied40. The need for autonomy relates to an individual’s 
perception of choice in their behaviour.  This can be expressed as an individual’s need to feel 
like the ‘origin’ and not the pawn’ of their behaviours41.  The need for competence relates to 
a desire to feel capable and confident when executing behaviours42. Finally, a need for 
relatedness is associated with an experience of connectedness with others43.  Experience of 
autonomous or controlled forms of motivation within a particular context is dependent upon 
the extent to which these fundamental needs are satisfied44.  If wearable technology is to 
promote optimal motivational functioning then the basic psychological needs of competence, 
autonomy and relatedness should be satisfied through the Fitbit features. Examples of some 
specific Fitbit features include elements within the app such as goal setting, feedback on 
performance and the messaging features. 
 
Need supportive environments have three main characteristics: autonomy supportive, 
competence facilitating (or well structured) and relatedness supportive42. Autonomy 
supportive contexts involve providing a clear rationale for an activity, offering 
encouragements, hints and feedback on performance45. Competence facilitating environments 
provide positive feedback on performance46 and also clear guidelines and expectations47. 
Relatedness supportive environments allow individuals to feel socially connected with and 
 accepted by others48. The benefits of physical activity environments that are need supportive 
have been well established in young people49.  
 
Wearable technology and self-determination theory 
The wearable technology explored within this paper is the Fitbit device, specifically, the 
Fitbit Charge physical activity wristband and the associated app. The wristband has a visual 
display which assesses steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned, floors climbed and 
distance travelled. Data can be synchronised with the Fitbit app that can be downloaded onto 
a mobile device. The Fitbit app allows users to monitor physical activity progress, tailor 
physical activity goals, record workouts, share and compete with friends, earn badges, log 
food and track sleep patterns. In reference to self-determination theory, these functions 
demonstrate clear potential for positive impact on competence, autonomy and relatedness.  
 
 
Competence could be positively satisfied by the Fitbit providing feedback on physical 
activity performance through badges, alerts and prompts. For example, when an individual 
achieves 10,000 daily steps – a pre-determined physical activity level of the Fitbit - his/her 
Fitbit will vibrate and flash to signify that this physical activity goal has been achieved. 
Further, the individual can gain certain badges – that are displayed on the app - for meeting 
different types of physical activity targets, such as walking the accumulated distance of the 
Serengeti. In relation to self-determination theory, positive feedback on physical activity 
behaviours can increase perceptions of competence and impact positively on self-determined 
motivation46, 50.  
 
Autonomy can be satisfied by the Fitbit device and app by the potential to personalise 
physical activity targets. Individuals may alter the pre-determined daily step goal, distance 
 travelled and active minutes to suit their individual physical activity needs. In addition, the 
Fitbit device and app does not prescribe the activities through which these goals should be 
achieved. Research consistently suggests that autonomy supportive environments, in which 
young people have a sense of choice over their physical activity behaviours, leads to higher 
levels of physical activity51. 
 
Relatedness could be satisfied through the social features on the app. For example, the app 
allows individuals to form Fitbit friends (which may be within or outside of peer groups), 
communicate with these friends (via emjois or text) and challenge their friends to physical 
activity competitions. Evidence suggests that relatedness can be satisfied through both face to 
face interactions and online communications52, demonstrating potential for this Fitbit app to 
address this motivational construct. This is a powerful feature, given that when young people 
perceive a high sense of relatedness they are more likely to exhibit higher engagement in 
physical activity behaviours53. In terms of the competitive element offered through the app, 
when individuals willingly engage in competition, intrinsic motivation is enhanced through 
feelings of relatedness54.  
 
Purpose 
The relationship between the constructs of self-determination theory (i.e., competence, 
autonomy, and relatedness) and the features and functions of the Fitbit device and app, 
highlight clear potential for healthy lifestyle technologies to positively influence young 
people’s motivation for physical activity. New research that provides evidence-based insights 
on the motivational impact of healthy lifestyle technologies will provide urgently needed 
understandings on the role of technology in health and physical activity promotion in young 
people. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether wearable healthy lifestyle 
 technologies influence adolescents’ motivation for physical activity. Data is presented from 
an exploratory mixed method sequential research design. The primary objective of the study 
is to examine if adolescents (age 13-14) motivation for physical activity and basic 
psychological need satisfaction changes over an 8-week period, while they wore a Fitbit 
device and used the associated Fitbit app. Using self-determination theory as a guiding 
theoretical framework it was hypothesised that, in this study, after wearing the Fitbit 
participants would experience greater need satisfaction, greater self-determined forms of 
motivation and less amotivation 
 
Methods 
The study was a mixed method sequential intervention design. The study applied pre-post-
test quantitative questionnaires, followed by qualitative focus group interviews at the end of 
the 8-week period. Through this design, the methods sought to measure impact on motivation 
and capture details of context, alongside user perceptions. Given that most empirical insights 
into healthy lifestyle technologies lack qualitative insights into how users engage and use 
apps and devices21, this research design serves to provide nuanced and broader 
understandings on the role of healthy lifestyle technologies in physical activity promotion in 
young people, by considering both objective and subjective insights. Prior to data collection, 
university ethical approval was granted and informed consent or assent was obtained from 
participants. A detailed account of the ethical procedures followed can be accessed in 
[removed for blind review]. FitBits terms and conditions were also consulted and followed 
during this study. 
 
Participants  
 One hundred 13-14 year olds (53 females, 47 males) were invited to participate in the study. 
Participants were recruited from six randomly selected physical education classes within two 
schools. Class sizes ranged from 10-16, with an average class size of 14. The schools were 
selected based on a convenience approach. One school was based in the South-East of the 
United Kingdom and the other school was based in the North-West of the United Kingdom. 
The two schools differed in their socio-economic demographics; school one was a non-
selective private school and school two was a comprehensive state school. The physical 
education class size ranged from 10-16 pupils, with a mean class size of 14. Due to 16 pupils 
being absent at the post-test assessment the final sample consisted of 84 pupils (44 girls, 40 
boys). Parental consent and pupil ascent were obtained for all participants.  
 
Intervention 
Participants were provided with a Fitbit Charge to wear for an 8-week duration. An 8-week 
duration was selected because this period allows for the identification of behaviour change in 
step based programmes55. The Fitbit Charge was used as the object of the intervention. Fitbit 
profiles were provided to participants using personalised email addresses and passwords. 
Instructions were provided on the functional capabilities and operational features of the 
device and the app. Participants were instructed to wear the Fitbit for the eight-week period.  
Data Generation 
Motivational Regulation  
Prior to being issued with the Fitbit device (PRE) and at week 8 (POST) pupils completed the 
Behavioural Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire II56. The questionnaire was adapted to 
replace the term exercise with physical activity in order to assess motivation towards physical 
activity. The BREQ II consists of 19 items that represent five different subscales that include 
amotivation (e.g. I don’t see why I should have to do physical activity), external regulation 
 (e.g. I feel under pressure from my friends/family to do physical activity), introjected 
regulation (e.g. I feel guilty when I don’t do physical activity), identified regulation (e.g. I 
value the benefits of physical activity) and intrinsic regulation (e.g. I do physical activity 
because it’s fun). Participants were asked to respond to each item on a 5-point scale ranging 
from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me). For data analysis mean scores for 
autonomous motivation, controlled motivation and amotivation were calculated. Scores for 
autonomous motivation were calculated by calculating the mean scores of intrinsic and 
identified items. Scores for controlled motivation were calculated using the mean scores of 
introjected and external regulation items.  
 
Need Satisfaction  
Pupils also completed the Psychological Need Satisfaction in Exercise scale, modified to the 
physical activity context57 pre- and post- intervention. This measure consists of a 16 item 
scale that assesses the basic psychological needs of competence (e.g. I feel I am able to 
complete physical activities that are personally challenging), autonomy (e.g. I feel free to do 
physical activity in my own way) and relatedness (e.g. I feel attached to my physical activity 
companions because they accept me for who I am) in a physical activity context. Participants 
were asked to respond to statements on a 6 item scale of 1 (false) to 6 (true).  
 
Context and User Perceptions 
To generate contextual understandings on how pupils used the Fitbit device and app, and 
their perceptions on the role of this technology in physical activity promotion, data were 
generated from 9 focus group interviews (4-6 members) in week 8 (POST). Groups for 
interviews were selected by the class teacher to be representative of different pupil interests 
and variations in physical activity abilities across the respective classes. Interviews were 
 conducted by the researchers using an adapted version of the nominal group technique58 in a 
semi-structured format. Each individual pupil was asked to respond to ten statements that 
related to their experiences of using the Fitbit. For example, “I would recommend using the 
Fitbit to other people my age because…” and “I would not recommend using a Fitbit to 
people my age because…”  Following the individual responses to each statement, the group 
were then prompted to share their thoughts and perceptions on the responses until they 
reached a level of agreement. This process was repeated for all ten statements. 
 
Data Analysis  
Data from the need satisfaction and motivational regulation questionnaires were analysed 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Descriptive statistics 
were calculated for all dependent variables using mean and standard deviations. In order to 
assess the motivational differences pre and post Fitbit, the differences between sex and 
interactions between sex and time a repeated measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance 
(MANOVA) was conducted. Sex was included in the MANOVA model due to the 
differences in physical activity levels of boys and girls49.  The MANOVA was used to 
explore the two independent variables of sex and time and the the multiple dependent 
variables (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, amotivation, competence, 
autonomy and relatedness). Statistical significance was determined by p<0.05. Cronbach alpa 
levels for all subscales at pre and post-test exceeded 0.70, meeting acceptable criteria (table 
1). 
 
Concepts from the framework of self-determination theory were used to analyse the focus 
group data. The process was therefore deductive and encompassed two aims: (i) identifying 
how the constructs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness existed in the qualitative data, 
 and (ii) locating the form of self-determination that was experienced by the participants i.e. 
lower to higher levels of self-determination. These two aims ensured that the authors 
remained focused on the overarching objective of the paper: to examine if adolescents (age 
13-14) motivation for physical activity and basic psychological need satisfaction changes 
over an 8-week period, while they wore a Fitbit device and used the associated Fitbit app.  
 
The first step involved both authors reading the interview transcripts to identify important 
segments that related to competence, autonomy, and relatedness and lower or high levels of 
self-determination. In the second step, the authors identified appropriate analytical questions 
related to the self-determination framework to analyse the segments of data: 
 How does the FitBit and app support or hinder competence? 
 How does the FitBit and app support or hinder autonomy? 
 How does the FitBit and app support or hinder relatedness? 
 What type of self-determined forms of motivation does the FitBit and app support or 
hinder? 
After the questions were identified the authors coded the data related to these questions. In 
keeping with the deductive approach, the data sets were reorganized into separate documents 
in relation to the different analytical questions. Data that was not related to the analytical 
questions, but was deemed as important by the authors was placed in an additional document. 
The third step involved a peer-examination strategy where the authors discussed and shared 
their independent analysis and their answers to the analytical questions from the data. In this 
process, the data was moved into different categories and sub-categories and the authors 
described their justifications to each other on the placement of data. No strong disagreements 
between the authors occurred during this process.  
 While a level of author bias is acknowledged as a limitation of the analytical process, the 
qualitative analysis revealed themes related to: (i) competence, (ii) relatedness, (iii) 
controlled motivation, and (iv) short-term motivation. The qualitative data did not reveal 
detailed insights into the concept of autonomy. Short-term motivation was not a key focus of 
the analytical questions, but was identified by both authors as important in relation to the 
overarching objective of the paper. The importance of presenting short-term motivation as a 
theme was further cross-referenced with the quantitative data. The authors agreed that this 
theme should be included due to the added value of offering an explanation to the 
quantitative data. Other important segments of the data were identified, such as calories and 
definitions of health as fitness. This data, however, did not relate to the objective of the paper 
and/or the constructs of motivation, and was disregarded.  
 
A relativist approach was used to guide the validity of this mixed methods design and the 
analytical processes59. Similar to previous work60, a relativist approach involved identifying 
criteria for validity based on an on-going list of characterising traits that related to the context 
of the research and methods. In this study, the list included the following criteria: the 
worthiness of the topic that occurred through reviewing contemporary literature in qualitative 
and quantitative research designs; the significant contribution of the work, that was 
understood through identified gaps in the evidence-base on the effects of healthy lifestyle 
technologies on young people (age 13-14); width, that is, the comprehensiveness of the 
evidence that was achieved through qualitative and quantitative sources of data, and data 
generation and analysis guided by an established theoretical framework; credibility, that 
occurred through the process of peer-examination, that opened up dialogue between the 
authors about the fairness, appropriateness, and believability of the data, and the use of 
previously validated questionnaires and procedures; and transparency that occurred through 
 on-going dialogue between the authors. This study also aimed for coherence. In other words, 
how the study hangs together in terms of purpose, methods, and results59.  
 
Results  
Pre-post changes in motivational regulation and need satisfaction 
Descriptive statistics for need satisfaction and motivational regulation scores for boys and 
girls, pre and post Fitbit can be found in table 1. This table shows declines in competence, 
autonomy, relatedness and autonomous motivation and increases in amotivation for boys, 
girls and all pupils after wearing the Fitbit. A repeated measures MANOVA test was 
conducted to test the impact of the Fitbit on need satisfaction and motivational regulation. 
The results showed a significant difference in motivational outcomes across time, F (6, 77) 
=8.72, p=0.00, η2= 0.41 and sex, F (6, 77) =2.47, p=0.03, η2= 0.16. For all participants, after 
wearing the Fitbit competence decreased by 0.17, autonomy decreased by 0.40, relatedness 
decreased by 0.27 and autonomy decreased by 0.22. For all participants, fter wearing the 
Fitbit amotivation increased by 0.35 and controlled motivation increased by 0.04. In relation 
to sex, autonomy was 0.13 higher in boys pre-Fitbit but 0.11 higher in girls post-Fitbit. In 
relation to sex, competence was 0.10 higher in boys pre-Fitbit but 0.13 higher in girls post-
Fitbit. Amotivation was higher in boys by 0.07 pre-Fitbit and 0.32 pos-Fitbit. Relatedness, 
controlled motivation and autonomous was higher in girls pre Fitbit by 0.49, 0.15 and 0.14, 
respectively. Relatedness, controlled motivation and autonomous motivation were also higher 
in girls post Fitbit by 0.48, 0.19 and 0.45, respectively. There was no significant interaction 
between sex and time, F (6, 77) =1.99, p=0.07, η2= 0.13.  
 
In relation to need satisfaction univariate, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests revealed non-
significant interaction effects between sex and time for competence, F (1, 82) = 5.49, p 
 =0.06, η2= 0.02, autonomy, F (1, 82) = 2.04, p =0.16, η2= 0.24 and relatedness, F (1, 82) = 
0.00, p =0.93, η2= 0.00. Univariate tests indicated there were no significant difference in 
competence F (1, 82) = 0.02, p =0.88, η2= 0.00 and autonomy F (1, 82) = 0.09, p =0.93, η2= 
0.00 between boys and girls, however, girls had significantly higher relatedness scores 
compared to boys F (1, 82) = 4.72, p =0.03, η2= 0.05. Univariate tests identified significantly 
lower competence scores, F (1, 82) = 8.5, p =0.005, η2= 0.91, autonomy scores, F (1, 82) = 
13.49, p =0.00, η2= 0.14 and relatedness scores, F (1, 82) = 5.81, p =0.02, η2= 0.07 post 
intervention.  
 
In relation to motivational regulation univariate tests revealed significant interaction effects 
between sex and time for amotivation, F (1, 82) = 4.98, p =0.03, η2= 0.06 and autonomous 
motivation F (1, 82) = 7.24, p =0.01, η2= 0.08. There was no significant interaction effect 
between sex and time for controlled motivation, F (1, 82) = 0.36, p =0.55, η2= 0.00. 
Univariate tests indicated girls had significantly higher autonomous motivation scores 
compared to boys, F (1, 82) = 7.24, p =0.01, η2= 0.08 and girls had significantly lower 
amotivation scores compared to boys, F (1, 82) = 5.73, p =0.02, η2= 0.65. Between boys and 
girls non-significant differences in controlled motivation scores were apparent, F (1, 82) = 
0.11, p =0.74, η2= 0.02. Univariate tests identified significantly higher amotivation scores, F 
(1, 82) = 38.00, p =0.00, η2= 0.32 and significantly lower autonomous motivation scores, F 
(1, 82) = 17.00, p =0.00, η2= 0.17 post intervention. There was no significant difference in 
controlled motivation scores post intervention, F (1, 82) = 0.36, p =0.55, η2= 0.00. 
Competence  
Data suggested that non-personalised targets of, for example, 10,000 steps were undermining 
the pupils sense of competence. Pupils commented that the standardised target of 10,000 
steps was unfair especially if you lacked the ability to achieve those targets: “You can feel 
 under pressure to do a certain amount of steps or to be better than what you're maybe 
capable of” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 3). The pupils also reported that while they 
strived to achieve this externally prescribed target, they were often unable to achieve this 
goal: “I did less than you're meant to, but more than I thought I would” (School 2, Focus 
Group Interview 3). The pressure of not obtaining the steps also negatively impacted how the 
participants viewed themselves: “Then you sit there and you realise it's seven o'clock and 
you've got, like, ten steps, you feel really bad” (School 1, Focus Group Interview 2). The 
pupils uses of the Fitbit and the Fitbit app, therefore, had a negative influence on their 
perceptions of competence due to pre-determined targets that were not relevant to their 
individual needs.  
Relatedness  
Competition with peers emerged as a key component function of the app that promoted social 
relationships. Pupils reported that they set up competitions in their peer groups and that these 
competitions encouraged them to engage in more physical activity: “I learnt that I was 
encouraged to do a lot more sports when I was wearing the Fitbit and I wanted to try and 
beat my friend's record, like” (School 1, Focus Group Interview 1). The pupils also 
commented on how the Fitbit was a social device that promoted a sense of connection with 
peers that also had a Fitbit and who engaged with physical activity: “I normally went to one 
of my friends’ houses because he had a Fitbit already and I was like, "Oh, how many steps 
have you done in a day?" and how to get more steps and, "What do you do?" and that.” 
(School 1, Focus Group Interview 1).  In this sense, the Fitbit allowed the pupils to engage 
with discussions about physical activity and develop common understandings and 
behaviours. However, the pupils also acknowledged that competition did not always have 
positive implications: “it became a competition between people, which is sometimes good but 
sometimes bad” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 4). The competitive element resulted in 
 peer pressure to achieve goals: “Some people maybe feel peer pressure to do fitness, to keep 
their steps and stuff up” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 2) and, in some cases, induced a 
sense of guilt: “You can sometimes feel guilty.  Like when I first got this Fitbit, if I hadn't 
done 10,000 steps before I went to bed, I used to just walk up and down the corridor because 
I couldn't let someone else beat me.” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 4).  Competition was 
therefore a central feature of the Fitbit device and app that pupils attended to. For some, the 
competitive element encouraged more physical activity, whereas for others, striving to beat 
their peers resulted in negative feelings of self. 
 
Controlled motivation 
The competition element was an external pressure to engage in physical activity. Pupils 
reported on how the competition encouraged them to be more active: “It makes you do a lot 
more walking because you want to try and beat your friends on it as well.” (School 1, Focus 
Group Interview 3). However, none of the pupils reported engaging in physical activity for 
fun during the 8-week period and strongly communicated that they were driven to engage in 
physical activity through competition: “If we had a competition, you're gaining exercise, 
doing more exercise to beat the other person.” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 5).  It also 
emerged that the externally prescribed physical activity target of 10,000 steps was acting as a 
source of controlled motivation: “when you look at your steps, sometimes you think it's not 
high enough, so you do that or something, just to try and get your steps up.  That's what quite 
a lot of people did.” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 1). The pupils commented on the 
external pressure of achieving the prescribed 10,000 steps: “it's good for features for walking 
and finding out what you do, but no as in it sets limits.  It says you should do this and it 
pressurises you” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 3).  This evidence suggests that pupils 
were motivated to engage in physical activity through feelings that were not self-determined 
 and that competition may act as a form of introjected regulation in which pupils engaged in 
physical activity through feelings of pressure or guilt.  
 
Short Term Motivation  
The novelty effect was a key component to the Fitbit raised by pupils. It was consistently 
reported that after about four weeks pupils became bored of the Fitbit: “I used it for the first 
four weeks, then just gave up” (School 1, Focus Group Interview 2) and “after about, like, 
four to five weeks, some weekends I'd just leave it on the table, like all day” (School 1, Focus 
Group Interview 1).  While this novelty period made some pupils more physically active, 
following the first four weeks their reported physical activity levels declined; “It did for the 
first four weeks, and then the last couple of weeks I just sat at home all day.” (School 1, 
Focus Group Interview 2).  Some pupils discussed how after the initial novelty period they 
were discouraged to engage in physical activity “I feel like, in the first few weeks, I was 
motivated more, but then by the end I was just sort of discouraged by—  It's not like I didn't 
do exercises, just—  I don't know.” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 5). Overall, there was a 
strong sense that after this novelty period pupils were less motivated to engage in physical 
activity: “It's like you've got something new and use it for ages, and then just, like, it doesn't 
bother you anymore.” (School 2, Focus Group Interview 5).  This evidence suggests that 
while the Fitbit serves to promote physical activity, for the pupils in this study, the Fitbit may 
have only produced modest and short-term effects.  
 
Discussion  
The purpose of this study was to examine if healthy lifestyle technologies impact on young 
people’s motivation for physical activity. In using self-determination theory as a guiding 
 theoretical framework, it was hypothesised that after an eight-week period of wearing the 
Fitbit and using the Fitbit app participants would experience greater need satisfaction, greater 
self-determined forms of motivation and less amotivation. The results, however, identified 
significant declines in competence, autonomy, and relatedness, alongside reduced levels of 
autonomous motivation. Furthermore, following the eight-week period significant increases 
in amotivation were observed. In contrast to previous literature suggesting that healthy 
lifestyle technologies can impact on young people’s motivation for physical activity24, 25, 26, 
data demonstrates that healthy lifestyle technologies may impact negatively on students’ 
motivation for physical activity.  
In examining the relationship between the Fitbit and young people in further detail, data 
suggested that peer-comparison was a key factor in undermining levels of competence, 
autonomy and relatedness. For example, it is reported that when individuals lose in 
competitions perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation decreases61. The 
competitive element provided the participants with competence/incompetence information 
through the social comparison of performance. Due to the leader board nature of the 
competitions offered on the Fitbit, inevitably, more young people are likely to receive 
incompetence information as only one person can be top of the leader board. Similarly, the 
predetermined 10,000 step goal may actually lead pupils to feel less competent when they 
don’t achieve the daily goal, as was supported through the focus groups.  
Although it was previously argued that feelings of autonomy could be increased through the 
tailoring of physical activity goals on the Fitbit app, the decreased feelings of autonomy 
experienced may have been a result of the predefined targets within the device e.g. 10,000 
steps. This was reflected in the qualitative evidence in which pupils focused on achieving this 
goal and there was little acknowledgement towards adjusting their physical activity targets. 
Furthermore, it is argued54 that competition may undermine self-determined motivation 
 through the impact on perceived autonomy and competence. Specifically, in this study pupils 
engaged in step count competitions with their peers, both informally through discussions and 
formally through the ‘7 Day Steps’ leaderboard on the Fitbit app that allows you to compare 
you performance with your Fitbit ‘friends’. If individuals feel pressured into competition or 
engagement, then a loss autonomy will ensure and self-determined motivation will be 
reduced. The qualitative evidence supports the proposed mechanism that pressure and guilt 
may been the process through which autonomy was undermined.  
 Although previous research has highlighted how both face-to-face interactions and online 
communications can promote relatedness52, it may have been the unique features of the 
online communications offered through the Fitbit app that lead to reductions in need 
satisfaction. The competitive elements may create isolation from peers and thus undermine 
relatedness. Although the qualitative evidence suggested that some pupils found the 
competitive element engaging, there was also an awareness from some individuals that the 
competition element could also be detrimental and that engagement in physical activity could 
be the result of external pressure from peers.  
Theoretically the role of competition can be explained by the compromising of the basic 
psychological needs that could have resulted in the evidenced reductions to autonomous 
motivation and increases in amotivation. Although increases in controlled motivation were 
not significant, data indicates that the Fitbit acted as a source of external pressure (through 
the achievement of goals) and internal pressure (guilt). Indeed, when individuals engage in 
behaviours through feelings of guilt or social approval their behaviour is controlled through 
introjected regulation44. In turn, when behaviours are regulated by controlled motivation 
individuals are less likely to engage in long term maintenance of behaviours44, 62. From this 
perspective, the observed short-term motivational effects can be attributed to the competitive 
element that promoted controlled rather than autonomous form of motivation.  
 Future directions 
The study has several limitations that could be developed in future research. Firstly, although 
the Fitbit resulted in negative motivational outcomes the study did not include an objective 
assessment of physical activity, thus, the implications for actual physical activity levels 
cannot be established. While data was gathered from the Fitbit as part of the wider study, data 
capture was inconsistent among participants and data reporting was limited due to ethical 
procedures adopted as part of the institutional ethical review process.  Data from the Fitbit, 
therefore, did not yield robust and credible insight that could be reported on in this paper. 
Future research should use a pre and post-test assessment of physical activity in a randomised 
control trial design in order to identify how healthy lifestyle technologies influence 
behavioural outcomes. Empirical investigations should also consider identifying the period at 
which the ‘novelty effect’ becomes apparent – i.e. 4 weeks – and engage with weekly 
assessments of motivational regulation and objective physical activity assessments. Future 
research should also consider sampling strategies that recruit schools from a diverse range of 
sociodemographic backgrounds. Furthermore, multiple intervention groups could be used in 
future studies, in order to assess the effectiveness of different levels of educational support. 
For example, a comparison across of no educational support with educational support of 
different frequencies e.g. weekly vs fortnightly goal setting and feedback activities. 
Translation to Health Education Practice 
Finding new ways to motivate young people to be active is a clear international agenda5. 
Healthy lifestyle technologies have been presented as one solution, given the increased 
availability and accessibility of wearable devices and health apps, alongside young people’s 
widespread use of, and engagement with, ‘mobile’ technologies20, 12. Despite this, few 
insights have been provided on the impact of healthy lifestyle technologies on young people’s 
 motivation for physical activity. Data from this study demonstrated that, while clear potential 
exists, healthy lifestyle technologies impact negatively on young people’s motivation for 
physical activity. Competition, peer-comparison and social-comparison to normative pre-
determined targets result in only short-term motivational effects. In order to promote 
autonomy in young people practioners should support children to personalise their physical 
activity goals and encourage self-referenced comparisons of performance, as oppose to 
engaging in normative comparisons with peers or established public health discourses. This 
evidence suggests that young people negatively relate to dominant public health discourses 
of, for example, 10,000 steps, that are promoted through consumer-orientated technologies. It 
also highlights that peer influence through digital technologies may play a negative role in 
physical activity promotion in young people. This research provides evidence for 
practitioners to support and educate young people regarding the personalisation aspect of 
these devices. Finally, evidence is required from a wider sample to be able to make more 
substantive claims about the role of healthy lifestyle technologies in young people’s physical 
activity behaviour.
