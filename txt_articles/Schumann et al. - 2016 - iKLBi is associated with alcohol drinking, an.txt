Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health problem
worldwide. Although drinking habits are known to be inherited, few
genes have been identified that are robustly linked to alcohol
drinking. We conducted a genome-wide association metaanalysis
and replication study among >105,000 individuals of European an-
cestry and identified β-Klotho (KLB) as a locus associated with alcohol
consumption (rs11940694; P = 9.2 × 10−12). β-Klotho is an obligate
coreceptor for the hormone FGF21, which is secreted from the liver
and implicated in macronutrient preference in humans. We show that
brain-specific β-Klotho KO mice have an increased alcohol preference
and that FGF21 inhibits alcohol drinking by acting on the brain. These
data suggest that a liver–brain endocrine axis may play an important
role in the regulation of alcohol drinking behavior and provide a
unique pharmacologic target for reducing alcohol consumption.

E
xcessive alcohol consumption is a major public health prob-
lem worldwide, causing an estimated 3.3 million deaths in
2012 (1). Much of the behavioral research associated with al-
cohol has focused on alcohol-dependent patients. However, the
burden of alcohol-associated disease largely reflects the amount
of alcohol consumption in a population, not alcohol dependence
(2). It has long been recognized that small shifts in the mean of a
continuously distributed behavior, such as alcohol drinking, can
have major public health benefits (3). For example, a shift from
heavy to moderate drinking could have beneficial effects on
cardiovascular disease risk (4).
Alcohol drinking is a heritable complex trait (5). Genetic vari-
ants in the alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene family can
result in alcohol intolerance caused by altering peripheral alcohol
metabolism and may thus influence alcohol consumption and de-
pendence (6). However, genetic influences on brain functions
affecting drinking behavior have been more difficult to detect,
because as for many complex traits, the effect of individual genes is
small, and therefore, large sample sizes are required to detect the
genetic signal (7).

 Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and
replication study of over 100,000 individuals of European de-
scent. We identify a gene variant in β-Klotho (KLB) that as-
sociates with alcohol consumption. β-Klotho is a single-pass
transmembrane protein that complexes with FGF receptors to
form cell surface receptors for the hormones FGF19 and FGF21
(8, 9). FGF19 is induced by bile acids in the small intestine to
regulate bile acid homeostasis and metabolism in the liver (9).
FGF21 is induced in liver and released into the blood in response
to various metabolic stresses, including high-carbohydrate diets
and alcohol (10–12). Notably, FGF21 was recently associated in
a human GWAS study with macronutrient preference, including
changes in carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake (13). Moreover,
FGF21 was shown to suppress sweet and alcohol preference in
mice (14, 15). Our findings suggest that the FGF21-β-Klotho
signaling pathway regulates alcohol consumption in humans.
Results
Association of KLB Gene SNP rs11940694 with Alcohol Drinking in
Humans. We carried out a GWAS of quantitative data on alco-
hol intake in 70,460 individuals (60.9% women) of European
descent from 30 cohorts. We followed up the most significantly
associated SNPs (six sentinel SNPs; P < 1.0 × 10−6 from in-
dependent regions) among up to 35,438 individuals from 14
additional cohorts (SI Appendix and Dataset S1). We analyzed
both continuous data on daily alcohol intake in drinkers (as
grams per day; log transformed) and a dichotomous variable of
heavy vs. light or no drinking (Dataset S1). Average alcohol in-
take in drinkers across the samples was 14.0 g/d in men and 6.0 g/d
in women. We performed per-cohort sex-specific and combined
sex single-SNP regression analyses under an additive genetic
model and conducted metaanalyses across the sex-specific strata
and cohorts using an inverse variance weighted fixed effects model.
Results of the primary GWAS for log grams per day alcohol
are shown in Fig. 1, Dataset S2, and Fig. S1. We identified five
SNPs for replication at P < 1 × 10−6: rs11940694 in the KLB
gene, rs197273 in TRAF family member-associated NF-κB
(TANK), rs780094 in GCKR, rs350721 in ASB3, and rs10950202
in AUTS2 (Table 1 and Dataset S2). In addition to rs10950202 in
AUTS2 (P = 2.9 × 10−7), we took forward SNP rs6943555 in
AUTS2 (P = 1.4 × 10−4), which was previously reported in re-
lation to alcohol drinking (7). In both men and women, the SNPs
were all significantly associated with log grams per day alcohol at
P < 0.005 (Table S1). When combining discovery and replication
data, we observed genome-wide significance for SNP rs11940694
(A/G) in KLB (P = 9.2 × 10−12) (Table 1 and Fig. S1), for which
the minor allele A was associated with reduced drinking. KLB
is localized on human chromosome 4p14 and encodes a trans-
membrane protein, β-Klotho, which is an essential component
of receptors for FGF19 and FGF21 (8, 9). rs197273 in the
TANK gene narrowly missed reaching genome-wide signifi-
cance in the combined sample (Table 1) (P = 7.4 × 10−8). In the
dichotomous analysis of the primary GWAS, SNP rs12599112 in
the Cadherin 13 gene and rs10927848 in the Transmembrane
protein 82 gene were significant at P = 2.3 × 10−8 and P = 2.6 × 10−7,
respectively (Dataset S2, Fig. S2, and Table S2), but they did
not reach genome-wide significance in the combined analysis
(Table S2).
SNP rs11940694 is localized in intron 1 of the KLB gene. The
local linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the KLB gene is
shown in Fig. S3. The minor allele frequencies of this SNP were
generally high (between 0.37 and 0.44) in different ethnic groups
(Table S3). We found no significant association of rs11940694
with gene expression in peripheral blood of 5,236 participants of
the Framingham Heart Study (Tables S4 and S5) (16).
β-Klotho in the Brain Controls Alcohol Drinking in Mice. To examine
whether β-Klotho affects alcohol drinking in mice and whether it
does so through actions in the brain, we measured alcohol intake
and the alcohol preference ratio of brain-specific β-Klotho KO
(KlbCamk2a) mice and control floxed Klb (Klbfl/fl) mice. We used a
voluntary two-bottle drinking assay performed with water and
alcohol. Because we previously showed that FGF21-transgenic
mice, which express FGF21 at pharmacologic levels, have a re-
duced alcohol preference (14), we performed these studies while
administering either recombinant FGF21 or vehicle by osmotic
minipump. Alcohol preference vs. water was significantly in-
creased in vehicle-treated KlbCamk2a compared with Klbfl/fl mice
at 16 vol % alcohol (Fig. 2A). FGF21 suppressed alcohol pref-
erence in Klbfl/fl mice but not in KlbCamk2a mice, showing that
the effect of FGF21 on alcohol drinking depends on β-Klotho
expressed in the brain (Fig. 2A). There was a corresponding
decrease in plasma alcohol levels immediately after 16 vol %
alcohol drinking, which reflects the modulation of the drinking
behavior (Fig. 2B). However, plasma FGF21 levels were com-
parable in Klbfl/fl and KlbCamk2a mice administered recombinant
FGF21 at the end of the experiment (Fig. 2C). Alcohol bio-
availability was not different between FGF21-treated Klbfl/fl and
KlbCamk2a mice (Fig. 2D). We have previously shown that FGF21
decreases the sucrose and saccharin preference ratio in Klbfl/fl but
not KlbCamk2a mice and has no effect on the quinine preference
ratio (14). To rule out a potential perturbation of our findings as
a result of the experimental procedure, we independently mea-
sured preference and consumption of 16 vol % alcohol in Klbfl/fl
and KlbCamk2a mice without osmotic minipump implantation.
Again, KlbCamk2a mice showed significantly greater alcohol con-
sumption and increased alcohol preference compared with Klbfl/fl
mice (Fig. 2 E and F), thus replicating our findings above. Alcohol
bioavailability after an i.p. injection was not different between Klbfl/fl
and KlbCamk2a mice after 1 and 3 h (Fig. 2G).
β-Klotho in Brain Does Not Regulate Emotional Behavior in Mice.
Increased alcohol drinking in humans and mice may be moti-
vated by its reward properties or as a means to relieve anxiety
and stress (17). In mice, FGF21 increases corticotropin-releasing
hormone expression in hypothalamus, circulating glucocorti-
coid concentrations, and sympathetic outflow (18–20), which are
linked to heightened anxiety. We, therefore, tested Klbfl/fl and
KlbCamk2a mice in behavioral paradigms measuring anxiety, in-
cluding novelty suppressed feeding (Fig. 3A), elevated plus maze
(Fig. 3B), and open-field activity tests (Fig. 3C). However, we did
not find differences between Klbfl/fl and KlbCamk2a mice in any of
these anxiety measures or general locomotor activity. Our find-
ing of increased alcohol preference in KlbCamk2a mice may thus
be caused by alteration of alcohol-associated reward mechanisms.
Although this notion is consistent with our previous results show-
ing Klb expression in areas important for alcohol reinforcement,
Significance
Alcohol is a widely consumed drug in western societies that
can lead to addiction. A small shift in consumption can have
dramatic consequences on public health. We performed the
largest genome-wide association metaanalysis and replication
study to date (>105,000 individuals) and identified a genetic
basis for alcohol consumption during nonaddictive drinking.
We found that a locus in the gene encoding β-Klotho is asso-
ciated with alcohol consumption. β-Klotho is an essential re-
ceptor component for the endocrine FGFs, FGF19 and FGF21.
Using mouse models and pharmacologic administration of
FGF21, we show that β-Klotho in the brain controls alcohol
drinking. These findings reveal a mechanism regulating alcohol
consumption in humans that may be pharmacologically trac-
table for reducing alcohol intake.

 specifically the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area
(14), additional studies will be required to determine precisely
where in the brain and how β-Klotho affects alcohol drinking.
Discussion
Here, we report that, in a GWAS performed in over 100,000
individuals, SNP rs11940694 in KLB associates with alcohol
consumption in nonaddicts. We further show that mice lacking
β-Klotho in the brain have increased alcohol consumption
and are refractory to the inhibitory effect of FGF21 on alco-
hol consumption. These findings reveal a previously unrecog-
nized brain pathway regulating alcohol consumption in humans
that may prove pharmacologically tractable for suppressing
alcohol drinking.
FGF21 is induced in liver by simple sugars through a mecha-
nism involving the transcription factor carbohydrate response
element binding protein (10, 11, 15, 21, 22). FGF21, in turn, acts
on brain to suppress sweet preference (14, 15). Thus, FGF21 is
part of a liver–brain feedback loop that limits the consumption
of simple sugars. Notably, FGF21 is also strongly induced in liver
by alcohol and contributes to alcohol-induced adipose tissue
lipolysis in a mouse model of chronic binge alcohol consumption
(12). Our data suggest the existence of an analogous feedback
loop, wherein liver-derived FGF21 acts on brain to limit the
consumption of alcohol. However, additional studies will be re-
quired to establish the existence of this FGF21 pathway in vivo.
In murine brain, there is evidence that FGF21 suppresses
sweet preference through effects on the paraventricular nucleus in
the hypothalamus (15). Among its actions in the hypothalamus,
FGF21 induces corticotropin-releasing hormone (18, 19), which is
a strong modulator of alcohol consumption (23). Notably, β-Klo-
tho is also present in mesolimbic regions of the brain that regulate
reward behavior, including the ventral tegmental area and nucleus
accumbens, and FGF21 administration reduced tissue levels of
dopamine and its metabolites in the nucleus accumbens (14).
Thus, FGF21 may act coordinately on multiple brain regions to
regulate the consumption of both simple sugars and alcohol.
In closing, our data linking β-Klotho to alcohol consump-
tion together with previous GWAS data linking FGF21 to
macronutrient preference raise the intriguing possibility of a
liver–brain endocrine axis that plays an important role in the
regulation of complex adaptive behaviors, including alcohol
drinking. Although our findings support an important role for
the KLB gene in the regulation of alcohol drinking, we cannot
rule out the possibility that KLB rs11940694 acts by affecting
neighboring genes. Therefore, additional genetic and mecha-
nistic studies are warranted. Finally, it will be important to
follow-up on our findings in more severe forms of alcohol
drinking, because our results suggest that this pathway could
be targeted pharmacologically for reducing the desire for
alcohol.
Methods
Alcohol Phenotypes. Alcohol intake in grams of alcohol per day was estimated
by each cohort based on information about drinking frequency and type of
alcohol consumed. For cohorts that collected data in drinks per week,
standard ethanol contents in different types of alcohol drinks were provided
as guidance to convert the data to grams per week, which was further divided

 by seven to give intake as grams per day. Adjustment was made if cohort-
specific drink sizes differed from the standard. For cohorts that collected
alcohol use in grams of ethanol per week, the numbers were divided by seven
directly into grams per day. Cohorts with only a categorical response to the
question for drinks per week used midpoints of each category for the cal-
culation. All nondrinkers (individuals reporting zero drinks per week) were
removed from the analysis. The grams per day variable was then log10
transformed before the analysis. Sex-specific residuals were derived by
regressing alcohol in log10 (grams per day) in a linear model on age, age2,
weight, and if applicable, study site and principal components to account for
population structure. The sex-specific residuals were pooled and used as the
main phenotype for subsequent analyses.
Dichotomous alcohol phenotype was created based on categorization of
the drinks per week variable. Heavy drinking was defined as ≥21 drinks per
week in men or ≥14 drinks per week in women. Light (or zero) drinking was
defined if male participants had ≤14 drinks per week or female participants
had ≤7 drinks per week. Drinkers having >14 to <21 drinks for men or >7 to
<14 drinks for women were excluded. Where information was available,
current nondrinkers who were former drinkers of >14 drinks per week in
men and >7 drinks per week in women as well as current nondrinkers who
were former drinkers of unknown amount were excluded, whereas current
nondrinkers who were former drinkers of ≤14 for men or ≤7 for women
were included. Additional exclusion was made if there were missing data on
alcohol consumption or the covariates.
The analyses only included participants of European origin and were performed
in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Each
cohort’s study protocol was reviewed and approved by their respective institutional
review board, and informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.

allele frequency (MAF) was <1%; imputation information score was <0.5; re-
sults were only available from two or fewer cohorts; or total n was <10,000.
Population structure was accounted for within cohorts via principal compo-
nents analysis. LD score regression (24) was conducted on the GWAS summary
results to examine the degree of inflation in test statistics, and genomic control
correction was considered unnecessary (λGC = 1.06 and intercept = 1.00; λ=0.99–
1.06 for individual cohorts) (Dataset S1 B and C). SNPs were taken forward for
replication from discovery GWASs if they passed the above criteria and had P <
1 × 10−6 [one SNP with the smallest P taken forward in each region, except for
AUTS2, for which two SNPs were taken forward based on previous results (7)].
Metaanalyses were performed by METAL (25) or R (v3.2.2).
Gene Expression Profiling in the Framingham Heart Study. In the Framingham

 examination 8 and the third generation cohort (n = 3,180) at examination 2.
Fasting peripheral whole-blood samples (2.5 mL) were collected in PAXgene
Tubes (PreAnalytiX). RNA expression profiling was conducted using the
Affymetrix Human Exon Array ST 1.0 (Affymetrix, Inc.) for samples that
passed RNA quality control. The expression values for ∼18,000 transcripts
were obtained from the total 1.2 million core probe sets. Quality control
procedures for transcripts have been described previously.
The cis-Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Analysis in the Framingham Heart
Study. To investigate possible effects of rs11940694 in KLB on gene expres-
sion, we performed cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. The SNP
in KLB was used as the independent variable in association analysis with the
transcript of KLB measured using whole-blood samples in the Framingham Heart
Study (n = 5,236). Affymetrix Probe 2724308 was used to represent the KLB
overall transcript levels. Age, sex, body mass index, batch effects, and blood cell
differentials were included as covariates in the association analysis. Linear mixed
model was used to account for familial correlation in association analysis.
Mouse Studies. All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee of the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center. Male littermates (2–4 mo old) maintained on a
12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to chow diet (Harlan Teklad
TD2916) were used for all experiments. The Klb gene was deleted from brain
by crossing Klbfl/fl mice with Camk2a-Cre mice on a mixed C57BL/6J;129/Sv
background as described (26).
Alcohol Drinking in Mice. For voluntary two-bottle preference experiments,
male mice (n = 9–13 per group) were given access to two bottles: one con-
taining water and the other containing 2–16% (vol/vol) ethanol in water.
After acclimation to the two-bottle paradigm, mice were exposed to each
concentration of ethanol for 4 d. Total fluid intake (water and ethanol-
containing water), food intake, and body weight were measured each day.
Alcohol consumption (grams) was calculated based on EtOH density (0.789 g/mL).
To obtain accurate alcohol intake that corrected for individual differences in
littermate size, alcohol consumption was normalized by body weight per
day for each mouse. As a measure of relative alcohol preference, the pref-
erence ratio was calculated at each alcohol concentration by dividing total
consumed alcohol solution (milliliters) by total fluid volume. Two-bottle
preference assays were also performed with sucrose [0.5 and 5% (wt/vol)]
and quinine (2 and 20 mg/dL) solutions. For all experiments, the positions of
the two bottles were changed every 2 d to exclude position effects.
Mouse Experiments with FGF21. For FGF21 administration studies, recombi-
nant human FGF21 protein provided by Novo Nordisk was administered at a
dose of 0.7 mg/kg per day by s.c. osmotic minipumps (Alzet 1004). Mice were
single caged after minipump surgery, which was conducted under isoflurane
anesthesia and 24 h of buprenorphine analgesia. Mice were allowed to re-
cover from minipump surgery for 4 d before alcohol drinking tests. After
experiments, mice were killed by decapitation, and plasma was collected
using EDTA or heparin after centrifugation for 15 min at 4,697 × g. Plasma
FGF21 concentrations were measured using the Biovendor FGF21 ELISA Kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Plasma Ethanol Concentration and Clearance. For alcohol bioavailability tests,
mice (n = 4–5 per group) were injected i.p. with alcohol (2.0 g/kg; 20%
wt/vol) in saline, and tail vein blood was collected after 1 and 3 h. Plasma
alcohol concentrations were measured using the EnzyChrom Ethanol
Assay Kit.
Emotional Behavior in Mice. For open-field activity assays, naïve mice were
placed in an open arena (44 × 44 cm, with the center defined as the middle
14 × 14 cm and the periphery defined as the area 5 cm from the wall), and
the amount of time spent in the center vs. along the walls and total distance
traveled were measured. For elevated plus maze activity assays, mice were
placed in the center of a plus maze with two dark enclosed arms and two
open arms. Mice were allowed to move freely around the maze, and the
total duration of time in each arm and the frequencies of entering both the
closed and open arms were measured. For novelty suppression of feeding
assays, mice fasted for 12 h were placed in a novel environment, and the
time to approach and eat a known food was measured.
Statistical Analysis. All data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis
between the two groups was performed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t
test using Excel or GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For multiple
comparisons, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey was done using SPSS.
