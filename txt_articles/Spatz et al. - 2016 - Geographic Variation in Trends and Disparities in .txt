Myocardial Infarction Hospitalization and Mortality
by Income Levels, 1999-2013

IMPORTANCE During the past decade, the incidence and mortality associated with acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) in the United States have decreased substantially. However, it is
unknown whether these improvements were consistent across communities of different
economic status and geographic regions since efforts to improve cardiovascular disease
prevention and management may have had variable impact.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether trends in US county-level, risk-standardized AMI
hospitalization and mortality rates varied by county-based median income level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this observational study, county-level
risk-standardized (age, sex, and race) hospitalization and 1-year mortality rates for AMI from
January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013, were measured for Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or
older. Data analysis was performed from June 2 through December 1, 2015. Counties were
stratified by median income percentile using 1999 US Census Bureau data adjusted for
inflation: low- (<25th), average- (25th-75th), or high- (>75th) income groups.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The effect of income on the slope of AMI hospitalizations
and mortality, measured as differences in the rate of change in AMI hospitalizations and
mortality by county income and by the 4 US geographic regions, and a possible lag effect
among low-income counties.
RESULTS In the 15-year study period, AMI risk-standardized hospitalization and mortality
rates decreased significantly for all 3 county income groups. Mean hospitalization rates were
significantly higher among low-income counties compared with high-income counties in 1999
(1353 vs 1123 per 100 000 person-years, respectively) and in 2013 (853 vs 648 per 100 000
person-years, respectively). One-year mortality rates after hospitalization for AMI were
similar across county income groups, decreasing from 1999 (31.5%, 31.4%, and 31.1%, for
high-, average-, and low-income counties, respectively) to 2013 (26.2%, 26.1%, and 25.4%,
respectively). Income was associated with county-level, risk-standardized AMI hospitalization
rates but not mortality rates. Increasing 1 interquartile range of median county consumer
price index–adjusted income ($12 000) was associated with a decline in 46 and 37
hospitalizations per 100 000 person-years for 1999 and 2013, respectively; interaction
between income and time was 0.56. The rate of decline in AMI hospitalizations was similar for
all county income groups; however, low-income counties lagged behind high-income
counties by 4.3 (95% CI, 3.1-5.9) years. There were no significant differences in trends across
geographic regions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hospitalization and mortality rates of AMI declined among
counties of all income levels, although hospitalization rates among low-income counties lag
behind those of the higher income groups. These findings lend support for a more targeted,
community-based approach to AMI prevention.

T
here are long-standing disparities in cardiovascular dis-
ease prevalence and outcomes based on a neighbor-
hood’
s or region’
s income.1-6 In many low-income areas,
there are several challenges to improving cardiovascular
outcomes, including inadequate physician supply,7-9 poor
health care quality,10-12 and limited resources to implement
policies and programs designed to prevent and manage car-
diovascular disease.13-16 Concurrently, populations living in
these communities tend to have fewer opportunities to en-
gage in healthy behaviors, greater exposure to stress, and
higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, it is gener-
ally accepted that living in a disadvantaged area puts people
at higher risk for cardiovascular events.17,18
However, during the past 15 years, there have been sig-
nificant population health initiatives to improve cardiovascu-
lar health and reduce health disparities.19 Campaigns such as
Healthy People 2010,20 the American Heart Association’
s 2010
and 2020 Impact Goal,21 and Million Hearts22 set forth na-
tional agendas of policy- and system-level reforms to affect
community and clinical care environments. There has been
greater attention to ambulatory care access, evidence-based
practice, quality measurement and reporting, and imple-
mentation of policies and programs to support healthy life-
style behaviors. During this period (1999-2011), the national
hospitalization rate for acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
declined by 38% and the 1-year mortality rate for AMI
decreased by 23%.23 Nevertheless, it is unknown whether
these trends were consistent across communities of differ-
ent economic status and geographic regions in which efforts
to improve cardiovascular disease prevention and manage-
ment may have had variable penetration and impact. Spe-
cifically, we lack data on trends in AMI incidence and out-
comes among low-income communities compared with
high-income communities; such data are important for
reducing health disparities.
Accordingly, we examined disparities in trends in AMI
hospitalization and 1-year mortality rates among US counties
of low, average, and high income. The median income was se-
lected as an indicator of a county’
s socioeconomic status be-
cause it is sensitive to economic trends24 and may serve as a
proxy of unmeasured environmental contextual factors asso-
ciated with geographic communities.25-27 Our aims were to de-
scribe the association between county-level median income
and AMI hospitalization and mortality rates, assess trends in
AMI hospitalization and mortality rates by county-level me-
dian income and across geographic regions, and perform a lag
analysis to determine the additional years needed, if any, for
low-income counties to achieve outcomes similar to those of
high-income communities. We hypothesized that low-
income counties would follow different trends than high-
income counties, with greater hospitalization and mortality
rates for AMI at all time periods; we also hypothesized that
these effects would be most pronounced in the South, a re-
gion with the highest county-level rates of cardiovascular risk
factors and disease as well as the deepest socioeconomic
challenges.28,29 This national perspective on trends in AMI
incidence and mortality by county-level income can help to
interpret the effectiveness of past campaigns to improve
cardiovascular health and can inform whether future efforts
should target the most vulnerable communities.
Methods
Study Population
We used the Medicare denominator files to identify Medicare
beneficiaries 65 years or older who were enrolled in the fee-
for-service plan for at least 1 month from January 1, 1999, to
December 31, 2013. To account for new enrollment, disenroll-
ment, and death, we calculated the person-years contributed
by each beneficiary during the study period. We linked the per-
son-yearsbeneficiarydatatotheMedicareinpatientclaimsdata
and identified beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hos-
pital with a principal discharge diagnosis of 410.xx based on
theInternationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,Clini-
cal Modification codes. We assessed demographic character-
isticsofpatientshospitalizedwithAMI,includingage,sex,race
(white, black, or other), and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibil-
ityfromthedenominatorfile.Clinicalcomorbiditieswereiden-
tified by using secondary diagnoses of inpatient claims data
from the incident hospitalization and the primary and sec-
ondary diagnoses from hospitalizations that occurred in the
preceding 12 months.30 We assigned beneficiaries to counties
based on the zip code of their residence at the time of hospi-
talization for AMI. The Yale University Human Investigation
Committee approved the study and waived the requirement
for informed consent.
County Characteristics
Using data from the US Census Bureau,31 we determined the
median income and percentage of people living below the fed-
eral poverty level by county for each year from 1999 through
2013.Wecomparedcounty-levelincomewithcounty-levelpov-
erty rates and found a high correlation (eTable 1 and eTable 2
in the Supplement). Thus, consistent with prior studies,32-37

Key Points
Question Amid US national declines in acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) hospitalizations and mortality, are there
disparities in trends between communities of different income
levels?
Findings In this study, similar rates of decline in AMI
hospitalizations and mortality among Medicare beneficiaries
residing in high-, average-, and low-income counties between
1999 and 2013 were found. However, low-income counties still
had persistently higher hospitalization rates compared with
high-income counties, although similar mortality rates, throughout
the study period.
Meaning Successes in decreasing AMI hospitalizations and
mortality have reached communities of different income levels,
yet disparities persist, suggesting the need for more targeted
research and investment in low-income counties.

indexyear,toaccountforinflation.38Westratifiedcountiesinto
3 mutually exclusive categories based on each county’
s an-
nual median income level: low income if the median income
was less than the 25th percentile of the national level, high in-
come if greater than the 75th percentile, and average income
if otherwise. We obtained county-level covariates from the US
Census Bureau, including the estimated population size, pro-
portion of residents 65 years or older, percent female, and per-
cent white/non-Hispanic, black/non-Hispanic, other race/non-
Hispanic,andHispanic.Foreachcounty,wealsocalculatedthe
proportion of Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligible individuals
based on Medicare data.
Outcomes
Our primary outcomes were risk-standardized AMI hospital-
izations and 1-year mortality following AMI. We calculated the
observed AMI hospitalization rates by dividing the total num-
bers of AMI hospitalizations in each year by the correspond-
ing person-years of fee-for-service beneficiaries for that year
foreachcountybyeachagegroup(65-74,75-84,and≥85years),
race group (white, black, and other), and sex group (male and
female). For hospitalizations, if a beneficiary had more than 1
AMI hospitalization in a given year, we counted them all. We
determined 1-year mortality following AMI by using the death
information in the denominator files regardless of the cause
of death. The 2014 denominator file was used to obtain mor-
tality information for beneficiaries discharged in 2013. We cal-
culated the mortality by dividing the total number of all-
cause deaths following AMI in each year by the corresponding
total number of fee-for-service beneficiaries who were hospi-
talized for AMI for that year. For mortality, if a beneficiary had
more than 1 AMI hospitalization in a given year, we randomly
selected 1 of those. This decision was based on the rationale
ofminimizingsampleselectionbias,inwhichselectingthefirst
hospitalization would result in a relatively low mortality rate
and selecting the last hospitalization would result in a rela-
tively high mortality rate.
To obtain the risk-standardized AMI hospitalization rate
for each county or county equivalent and for each year from
1999 to 2013, we extended the Centers for Medicare & Medic-
aid Services hierarchical model29 used for profiling hospital
performance on outcomes with a Poisson link function and
county-specificrandominterceptstomodelthenumberofAMI
hospitalizationsasafunctionofbeneficiaries’age,sex,andrace
and accounting for spatial differences between counties. We
repeated this hierarchical model with a logit link function, ad-
justing for patient comorbidities, to calculate the risk-
standardized, 1-year, all-cause mortality following AMI.
Statistical Analysis
We examined trends in patient characteristics, hospitaliza-
tion rates, and 1-year mortality rates for each county during the
study period, stratified by the 3 income categories. Hospital-
ization estimates were expressed as the number of events
per 100 000 person-years, and 1-year mortality rates were
expressed as percentages. We evaluated the association be-
tween income and county-level, risk-standardized AMI
hospitalizations by fitting a mixed-effects model with the
county-specific, risk-standardized AMI hospitalization rate as
a function of change in median income, defined as 1 interquar-
tile range of median income, adjusted for county-specific co-
variates described above. Time was modeled as a continuous
variable corresponding to years 1999 (time, 0) to 2013 (time,
14); an interaction term between time and change in median
income was included in the model. We repeated the model for
the 1-year mortality outcome.
To assess the difference in the rates of change in AMI hos-
pitalization rates among the 3 county income groups during
the study period, we fitted a random intercept (county) and
coefficient (time) model with the risk-standardized AMI hos-
pitalization rate as a function of 2 binary income group indi-
cators(lowincomeandaverageincome,withhighincomeserv-
ing as the reference group), a time variable, and interaction
termsbetweenincomegroupandtime,adjustedforthecounty-
specific proportion of residents 65 years or older and percent-
age of women. We repeated this model for the 1-year AMI
mortality rate. We estimated the lag effects by using the
method described in the eAppendix in the Supplement to
obtain the number of additional years needed for low- and av-
erage-income counties to achieve the hospitalization rates of
high-income counties in 2013.
To assess geographic differences in changes of AMI hos-
pitalization and mortality rates, we mapped county-specific,
risk-standardized AMI hospitalization separately for 1999 and
2013byusingthe1999distributionofAMIhospitalizationrates
as the gradient reference. We also divided counties into 4 re-
gions: Northeast, West, Midwest, and South based on US cen-
sus regional definitions. For each region, we reclassified coun-
ties into region-specific income categories based on regional
distributions of median income. As a result, the thresholds for
defining low-, average-, and high-income counties vary by re-
gion, which considers regional differences in cost of living and
standardizes comparisons among and between regions. Analy-
ses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3, 64-bit (SAS Insti-
tute Inc). Data analysis was performed from June 2 through
December 1, 2015.
Results
Study Population
We identified 60 056 069 unique Medicare beneficiaries aged
65 years or older who were enrolled in the Medicare fee-for-
serviceprogramfor1monthorlongerfrom1999to2013(Table),
contributing 416 667 038 person-years. There were a total of
4 290 784 hospitalizations for AMI contributed by 3 294 700
unique patients during this period. After excluding 13 coun-
ties or county equivalents with invalid or incomplete data for
income during the study period, 3131 counties or county
equivalents were included in the analysis. Between 1999 and
2013, the consumer price index–adjusted median (interquar-
tile range) incomes decreased among all county income groups
from $37 271 ($4912) to $34 593 ($4329), $46 344 ($6230) to
$43 966 ($6253), and $60 495 ($11 455) to $57 559 ($11 948) for

78.3% of average-income, and 76.6% of high-income coun-
ties remained unchanged in their income classification (eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement). In 1999, there were 2 512 262 person-
years of fee-for-service beneficiaries in 783 low-income
counties, 9 812 513 person-years of beneficiaries in 1565 aver-
age-income counties, and 14 248 657 person-years of benefi-
ciaries in 783 high-income counties. Comparison of counties
by income status across 3 time periods (1999, 2006, and 2013)
revealed that, for all years, low-income counties had smaller
populations and more residents 65 years or older compared
with high-income counties (Table). The greatest proportion of
white residents lived in high-income counties, although this
decreased over time, offset by increasing proportions of His-
panic residents living in high-income counties. The greatest
proportion of black residents lived in low-income communi-
ties, and this proportion did not change over time. The preva-
lence of comorbidities among Medicare beneficiaries did not
differ substantially among county income groups (Table).
Association Between Income and AMI Hospitalization
and Mortality Rates
Income was associated with county-level, risk-standardized
AMI hospitalization rates but not mortality rates; this associa-
tion persisted during the study period (Figure 1 and eFigure 3
and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Increasing 1 interquartile
range of median county consumer price index–adjusted in-
come ($12 000) was associated with a decline in 46 and 37 hos-
pitalizations per 100 000 person-years for 1999 and 2013, re-
spectively. Although there was an interaction between income
andtimeforthehospitalizationrate,theeffectwassmall(0.56).
The association between income and AMI hospitalizations var-
ied by income groups. For low-, average-, and high-income
groups, each interquartile range increase was associated with
a decrease in hospitalization rates of 74, 47, and 32 per 100 000
person-years, respectively.
Trends in Hospitalizations and Mortality
by County Income Groups
County-level, risk-standardized AMI hospitalization rates de-
creasedsignificantlyfrom1999to2013forallcounties(eFigure
5 in the Supplement). However, hospitalization rates varied by
incomegroups(Figure2).Themeanhospitalizationratesamong
low-income counties compared with high-income counties in
1999 were 1353 vs 1123 per 100 000 person-years, respectively,
and in 2013 were 853 vs 648 per 100 000 person-years, respec-
tively.ThegreatestnumberofAMIhospitalizationsoccurredin
low-income counties (140 922 in 1999, 119 125 in 2006, and
89 893in2013),andthelowestnumberofAMIhospitalizations
occurred in high-income counties (28 756 in 1999, 22 289 in
2006,and21502in2013).Therateofdeclineinhospitalizations

dicating that the slope of decline in the low-income group was

Discussion
In this national study assessing trends in AMI hospitalization
rates and outcomes by county-level income, we found signifi-
cant declines among low-, average-, and high-income commu-
nities in all regions of the United States. The rate of decline was
similar across low-, average-, and high-income county groups;
however,low-incomecountieshadpersistentlyhigherAMIhos-
pitalizations, although not mortality, compared with high-
income counties. For example, AMI hospitalization rates in
low-income counties in 2013 were similar to the rates for high-
income counties in 2008. This estimated 4-year lag time was
observed across the entire study period, suggesting that ef-
forts to reduce AMI burden have reached diverse income areas
throughout the United States, although disparities persist.
Previous work23 conducted at the individual level demon-
strated significant nationwide declines in AMI hospitalization
and mortality rates that were consistent across demographic
groups of age, sex, and race. We expand on this work, showing
that trends in AMI were similar across communities of differ-
ent income levels. This finding is important since differences
in the physical and social environment can affect cardiovascu-
lar outcomes of a population, leading to health disparities.39-41
Areas with poor access to healthy foods, recreational activi-
ties, and health care are limited in their capacity to promote
healthy lifestyle behaviors as well as primary and secondary
prevention.26 Also in these areas, exposure to stress, unem-
ployment, and inadequate social support may attenuate the ef-
fects of efforts to improve cardiovascular health.42-44
However, during the past 2 decades, there have been
several broad cardiovascular health initiatives aimed to
improve outcomes among all communities. These initiatives
include nationwide quality improvement campaigns for
better cardiovascular risk factor screening, prevention, and
control16,45,46; smoking bans47; and process and outcome
measures assessing adherence to guideline-based risk
factor modification48-50 and cardiovascular events and
mortality.30,49,51,52 The Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality developed prevention quality indicators intended
for use by communities as a screening tool to assess quality
of care outside of the hospital.53 The emphasis on measure-
ment and transparency of outcomes, as well as the use of
evidence-based practices, may have affected communities
of different economic status. In addition, secular (ie, not
specific to AMI prevention) trends in the health care system
may have contributed to declines, such as greater integra-
tion, coordination, and access to care during this period.
Thus, a national assessment of AMI trends across
communities of different income levels is important for
understanding whether these efforts had similar reach.
Our study focused on income level as a means of assess-
ing health disparities across diverse communities. Low-
income communities tend to be chronically underresourced,
as demonstrated by the stagnant income levels we observed
among most counties across the United States.54,55 Median in-
come can serve as a proxy for other socioeconomic indicators
(eg, poverty, educational levels, and employment), which have
been associated with health outcomes.2,17,25,43 In the present
study,wefoundhighlysignificantcorrelationsbetweencounty-
level median income, poverty rates, and eligibility for Medic-
aid.Inaddition,incomelevelcanbeassociatedwithothercom-
munity-level factors (eg, health behaviors, health care access
and quality, and the physical environment) that can contrib-
ute to higher AMI event rates.1,34 These contextual factors may
mediate the association between area income and popula-
tion rates of AMI or may have independent effects. Under-
standing these associations is critical for identifying strate-
gies to reduce disparities in AMI and is an important area for
future research.
The higher hospitalization rates among low-income com-
munities, along with the lagged decline in hospitalization rates
compared with high-income counties, have several explana-
tions. High-income counties may have a greater capacity to
quickly adopt new models of care delivery, join campaigns to
reduce AMI, and implement evidence-based primary and sec-
ondary treatment recommendations.37 In addition, high-
income communities may have greater resources to invest in

the physical and social health environment.56-58 Conversely,
low-income communities may face unique challenges (eg, clo-
sure of health centers during economic depression) or disor-
ganizedhealthservicesthatcouldattenuatethesuccessofnew
primary and secondary prevention efforts to reduce AMI.59,60
The AMI hospitalization and mortality rates declined at a simi-
lar pace across low- and high-income communities, suggest-
ing that a single factor or intervention was not responsible for
the decline. If so, one might have expected admission rates in
low-income counties to drop more rapidly since they started
with higher rates. In the present study, we found that income
had a greater effect on AMI hospitalizations in low-income
counties in later years compared with earlier years, suggest-
ing that AMI rates among low-income counties may be par-
ticularly vulnerable to economic trends, mitigating efforts to
eliminate disparities.
The lack of association of county income with AMI mor-
tality is compelling. We hypothesized that the community fac-
tors contributing to AMI incidence would also affect AMI re-
covery. Prior studies1,25,61 of coronary heart disease mortality
from1990to1999showed2-foldand3-folddifferencesbystate
and county, respectively. One explanation for the difference
in findings is that having an AMI today activates a robust medi-
cal system that may be comparably responsive in different so-
cioeconomic settings. Another explanation for the difference
is that county-level income becomes less important follow-
ing a major life-threatening event. Future studies should ex-
amine whether other recovery outcomes, such as recurrent
AMI, rehospitalization, patient-reported symptoms and health
status, and long-term life expectancy following AMI, are as-
sociated with county-level income.
Although more low-income counties were clustered in the
South, we did not find a difference in the rate of decline be-
tween regions. Aggregating counties into 4 regions may have
obscured differences, highlighting the importance of analy-
ses of smaller population units.62
Our study has some limitations. First, median county
household income is only 1 marker for socioeconomic status,
and an index of other variables (eg, educational level,
employment, and household crowding) may provide a more

holistic indicator of socioeconomic status.63 In prior
studies,63,64 median income, when combined with other
socioeconomic variables, was the principal component
explaining the greatest variance. Moreover, median income
is strongly associated with health outcomes, and small dif-
ferences in income have been associated with large changes
in health status, especially among poor communities.24,65
Second, this study describes AMI risk-standardized hospital-
ization rates among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries
who may not be representative of the entire population.
Younger uninsured/underinsured populations with AMI may
be more affected by county-level income; thus, we suspect
that focusing on the Medicare population would have biased
our results to the null. Third, heterogeneity in annual house-
hold income is present within each county. However, we
chose to study counties rather than a smaller geographic
area (eg, 5-digit zip code or US census tracts or blocks)
because the area is more relevant to policy action steps.
County-level data on the contextual environment are
increasingly available through the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation40 and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention66 and can help to identify gaps in opportunities
for cardiovascular health between counties. Moreover,
county-level data on the contextual environment can drive
leaders in government, health care, business, and commu-
nity organizations to consider community efforts to improve
cardiovascular health. As the final limitation, this study
focused on hospitalization and mortality rates associated
with a single condition: AMI. These rates do not take into
account prehospital sudden cardiac death due to AMI. Fur-
ther studies are needed to determine whether trends by
county-level income are consistent for sudden cardiac death
due to AMI, as well as for non-AMI conditions.
In 1999, the National Conference on Cardiovascular Dis-
ease Prevention, convened by the US Congress, was charged
to “enhance efforts to remove differences in risk behaviors,
preventive care, and morbidity and mortality in the
disadvantaged.”1(p3145) The findings of the present study
indicate that the cardiovascular health of people residing in
high-, average-, and low-income communities has improved
since that time. However, disparities continue to persist.
Although significant improvements have been achieved,
low-income communities continue to lag behind. Future
policies, programs, and nationwide campaigns should con-
sider more focused efforts in low-income communities,
potentially targeting health factors in the community that
may contribute to the differences in outcomes.
Conclusions
In this national study of disparities and trends in AMI be-
tween 1999 and 2013, we observed similar rates of decline in
AMI hospitalizations and 1-year mortality between commu-
nities of different income levels. However, low-income coun-
tieshadpersistentlyhigherhospitalizations,althoughnotmor-
tality, than high-income counties in all years of the study, with
an estimated 4-year lag time for low-income counties. The de-
clines in AMI hospitalization and mortality rates across socio-
economic groups is commendable, although disparities per-
sist in AMI event rates; these disparities present a topic for
future research and action.
