ABSTRACT  
 
Purpose: To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect of latanoprostene 
bunod (LBN) 0.024% with timolol maleate 0.5% in subjects with open-angle glaucoma 
(OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
Design: Prospective, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, noninferiority 
clinical trial. 
Methods: Adults with OAG or OHT from 46 clinical sites (United States and European 
Union) were randomized 2:1 to LBN instilled once daily (QD) in the evening and 
vehicle in the morning or timolol instilled BID for 3 months. IOP was measured at 
Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3 (8AM, 12PM and 4PM each visit).  
Results: A total of 387 subjects (LBN, n=259; timolol, n=128) completed the study. 
Analysis of covariance showed mean IOP reduction with LBN was not only noninferior 
to timolol but significantly greater (P≤0.025) to timolol at all but the first time point in 
this study (Week 2, 8AM). Of LBN- and timolol-treated subjects, respectively, 31.0% 
and 18.5% (P=0.007) had their IOP reduced ≥25% from baseline, and 17.7% and 
11.1% (P=0.084) had their IOP reduced to ≤18 mm Hg over all timepoints/visits in this 
study. Ocular treatment-emergent adverse events, while uncommon, appeared more 
frequently in the LBN group (all mild-moderate except one case of severe hyperemia). 
Conclusions: LBN 0.024% QD in the evening was noninferior to timolol 0.5% BID 
over 3 months of treatment with significantly greater IOP lowering in subjects with 
OAG or OHT at all but the earliest timepoint evaluated and demonstrated a good 
safety profile.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Latanoprostene bunod (LBN; BOL-303259-X; Bausch + Lomb) is a novel nitric-oxide-
donating prostaglandin F2α analog. The compound is rapidly metabolized into 
latanoprost acid, a prostaglandin analog, and butanediol mononitrate, a nitric oxide 
(NO)-donating moiety, following exposure to esterases in the ocular environment.1 
Prostaglandin analogs and NO donors have both demonstrated intraocular pressure 
(IOP)-lowering effects in animals and humans.2-13 Latanoprost (Xalatan®, Pfizer Inc., 
NY, NY) which is hydrolyzed in the cornea to latanoprost acid, is indicated for the 
reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular 
hypertension (OHT).14 Data indicates that the effects of LBN on IOP are mediated via 
actions on both nonconventional and conventional aqueous outflow pathways. Whereas 
latanoprost reduces IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid primarily through the 
uveoscleral pathway (nonconventional route),15-22 NO donors are reported to induce 
relaxation of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal, which increases aqueous 
humor outflow through the conventional pathway.2,4,5,12,13,23-28  
 
In three preclinical models of ocular hypertension (laser-induced ocular hypertensive 
non-human primate, glaucomatous dog, and transiently ocular hypertensive rabbit), 
topical administration of LBN rapidly lowered IOP.1 The rabbit model was insensitive to 
equimolar latanoprost, suggesting that the effects of LBN in this model were solely 
mediated by NO. Further, the IOP-lowering effects of LBN were greater than those of 
equimolar doses of latanoprost in both glaucomatous dogs and ocular hypertensive 
primates, presumably due to the action of NO. In a randomized, investigator-masked, 
parallel-group, dose-ranging, phase 2 clinical study in 413 patients with OAG or OHT, 
LBN ophthalmic solution 0.024% reduced mean diurnal IOP to a significantly greater 
extent than latanoprost 0.005% (Xalatan) over 28 days of treatment.29 This 
improvement in IOP reduction with LBN 0.024% relative to latanoprost 0.005% in 
human subjects with OAG or OHT confirmed pre-clinical findings, providing additional 
support for a pharmacologic effect of NO released from the NO-donating portion of the 
LBN molecule.  
 
The objective of this phase 3 study was to compare the IOP-lowering effect of LBN 
0.024% instilled once daily (QD) in the evening with timolol maleate 0.5% (hereafter 
referred to as timolol 0.5%) instilled twice daily (BID) in subjects with OAG or OHT. 
Another recent phase 3 trial with a similar design (the APOLLO study),30 found that LBN 
QD in the evening was significantly better than timolol 0.5% BID with regard to IOP 
lowering throughout the day.

METHODS 
 
Study design 
The LUNAR study (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01749930) was a randomized, 
multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, clinical study conducted at 46 
investigational sites in the United States (40), the United Kingdom (3), Germany (2), and 
Italy (1). The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (as 
described in the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), the ethical 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Code of Federal Regulations, and 
applicable local regulations. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approval 
was obtained at each participating site, and all study subjects provided written informed 
consent prior to participation. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the 
non-inferiority of the mean IOP-lowering effect of LBN 0.024% over 3 months of 
treatment with that of timolol 0.5%. If noninferiority of LBN 0.024% was achieved, the 
secondary objective was to evaluate the statistical superiority of LBN 0.024% to timolol 
0.5%. The study was comprised of two phases: a 3-month active controlled efficacy 
phase followed by a 3-month open-label safety extension phase, the results of which 
will be published separately.  
 
Subjects 
The study enrolled male and female subjects ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of OAG 
(including pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative) or OHT in 1 or both eyes. Intraocular 
pressure was assessed once at Visit 1 (Screening) and at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM during 
Visit 3 (Eligibility, Day 0) to establish baseline and eligibility values. Subjects who were 
already receiving treatment with an IOP-lowering medication were required to undergo a 
washout period prior to Visit 3, the duration of which varied depending on the type of 
IOP-lowering medication used (maximum washout period, 28 + 5 days). At Visit 3, and 
following washout, if required, study participants were required to have an IOP ≥ 26 mm 
Hg at a minimum of 1 of 3 timepoints (8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM), ≥ 24 mm Hg at a 
minimum of 1 timepoint, and ≥ 22 mm Hg at 1 timepoint, all in the same eye, and IOP ≤ 
36 mm Hg at all 3 measurement timepoints in both eyes. Potential subjects undergoing 
washout were excluded from participation in the study if IOP exceeded 36 mm Hg in 
either eye at any point during the washout period. Eligible subjects also had a best-
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of + 0.7 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 
(logMAR) units (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/100) or better in either eye.  
 
Subjects were ineligible for study participation if they were involved in another clinical 
trial during this study, or were involved in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to 
Visit 1 (Screening), for subjects requiring a washout period, or 30 days prior to Visit 3 
(Eligibility, Day 0) for subjects not requiring a washout period. Subjects were also 
excluded if they had known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the active or inactive 
ingredients of the study treatments; were unable to discontinue contact lens use or 
other eye drop medications (e.g., artificial tears) during and for 15 minutes after 
instillation of study drug and during study visits; had a central corneal thickness >600 
µm in either eye; had any condition that prevented reliable applanation tonometry (e.g.,

significant corneal surface abnormalities) in either eye; or had advanced glaucoma (cup 
to disk ratio >0.8 or split fixation) or other significant ophthalmic disease. The study also 
excluded subjects who required treatment with ocular or systemic corticosteroids, 
subjects in need of or expected to require additional topical or systemic treatment for 
OAG or OHT, or subjects with an anticipated need to initiate or modify medication 
known to affect IOP (e.g., β-adrenergic antagonists, α-adrenergic agonists, calcium 
channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzymeA inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor 
blockers) during the study. 
 
Study Treatments and Assessments 
The investigational product LBN 0.024%, its vehicle, and the comparator timolol 0.5% 
were manufactured by Bausch & Lomb Inc., Tampa, Fl. Baseline demographic and 
clinical data (i.e. relevant medical and ocular history, concomitant medications, ocular 
assessments) were recorded at Visit 1 (Screening). The study eye was defined as the 
eye that qualified per inclusion criteria at Visit 3 (Eligibility, Day 0). If both eyes qualified, 
the study eye was the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP value (defined as average 
of IOPs recorded at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM) at Visit 3, or the right eye if both eyes had 
the same mean diurnal IOP value. If both eyes of a subject had a diagnosis of OAG or 
OHT, then both eyes were treated for the duration of the study, even if only 1 eye met 
study inclusion criteria at Visit 3. 
 
Eligible subjects were randomized at Visit 3 in a 2:1 ratio to receive 3 months of 
treatment with LBN 0.024% QD in the evening (approximately 8 PM) and vehicle QD in 
the morning (approximately 8 AM) or timolol 0.5% BID. Each subject received study kits 
containing 4 eye drop bottles with computer-generated investigational labels (i.e., void 
of commercial labeling) and was instructed to instill 1 drop of study drug from the "Night" 
dosing bottle into the affected eye(s) at approximately 8 PM each evening and 1 drop 
from the "Day" dosing bottle at approximately 8 AM each morning. A randomization 
schedule was created prior to any study enrollment by a statistician not otherwise 
involved in the study using SAS® (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, Version 9.2). 
Allocation of study drug was completed through the use of IRT (Interactive Response 
Technology) that determined which kit to assign to each subject. Subjects and study site 
personnel were fully masked to treatment assignments. Compliance was determined as 
actual number of instillations, as recorded on a patient diary, divided by number of 
expected instillations. 
 
Subjects completed 3 study visits (Visit 4 [Week 2 ± 2 days]; Visit 5 [Week 6 ± 3 days]; 
Visit 6 [Month 3 ± 10 days]) following randomization. Intraocular pressure was assessed 
at each visit in both eyes at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM using a Goldman applanation 
tonometer. On these days, the AM dose of study drug was instilled after the first IOP 
assessment of the day. Intraocular pressure was measured twice consecutively and the 
mean IOP was recorded for consecutive measurements within 2 mm Hg. In cases of 
consecutive measurements differing by > 2 mm Hg, a third measurement was taken and 
the median IOP was recorded. Whenever possible, IOP was measured by the same 
operator using the same tonometer at each visit for a given subject.

Safety assessments recorded at each visit included ocular and systemic treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital sign measurements, BCVA (measured using 
the ETDRS standard protocol), and slit-lamp examination, in addition, ophthalmoscopy 
and specular microscopy were performed at Day 0 and Month 3. Conjunctival 
hyperemia was graded by the investigator on a 1-4 photographic reference (none, mild, 
moderate, severe) scale prior to IOP assessment at each timepoint/study visit.  
 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the IOP in the study eye measured at the specified 
timepoints of 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at each post-randomization visit (Week 2, Week 6, 
and Month 3). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of eyes with IOP 
≤18 mm Hg, the proportion with IOP reduction ≥25% from baseline consistently across 
all 9 post-randomization assessments, change from baseline in IOP at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 
4 PM, and the change from baseline in diurnal IOP at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. 
Safety endpoints included the incidence of ocular and systemic adverse events (AEs), 
vital signs, BCVA, and conjunctival hyperemia assessments. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
A sample size of 300 subjects in the per-protocol (PP) population was calculated as 
providing adequate power (90%) to detect an IOP difference (non-inferiority margin) of 
1.5 mm Hg, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 3.75 mm Hg and a 2-sided α = 0.05. 
The SD was obtained by pooling the SD from a LBN 0.024% phase 2b study29 and the 
timolol arm of a phase 3 study.31 A total of 393 subjects were to be randomized in a 2:1 
ratio to the LBN 0.024% and timolol 0.5% treatment groups respectively to account for 
potential protocol violations and dropouts. 
 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (i.e. all randomized subjects who instilled at least 1 
dose of study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 post-randomization IOP), with 
randomized treatment group as a classification variable and time-matched mean IOP as 
a covariate. Missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) method for the IOP in the study eye measured at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at each 
post-randomization visit. The 2 treatments, LBN 0.024% and timolol 0.5% were 
compared for each timepoint at each visit by determining the least squares (LS) mean 
of each treatment group, the difference in the LS mean (LBN 0.024%–timolol 0.5%), 
and the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference. Noninferiority was to be 
established if the upper limit of the CIs for the difference did not exceed 1.5 mm Hg at 
all 9 IOP assessments and did not exceed 1.0 mm Hg for at least 5 out of the 9 time 
points. If noninferiority was determined, superiority was concluded if the upper limit of 
the 95% CI did not exceed 0 mm Hg at any of the 9 IOP measurement timepoints. 
These analyses were repeated in the PP population in order to supplement the primary 
analyses.  
 
Analyses of the secondary endpoints were performed following demonstration of 
noninferiority of LBN 0.024% to timolol 0.5%. The proportion of subjects with IOP ≤18 
mm Hg at all 9 post-randomization IOP measurement timepoints and the proportion with

IOP reduction ≥ 25% at all 9 timepoints were summarized categorically. The percentage 
reduction from baseline in IOP was calculated as 100*(baseline mean IOP – post 
baseline mean IOP)/baseline mean IOP. For each secondary endpoint, the 2-sided 95% 
CI around the difference in proportions (LBN 0.024%–timolol 0.5%) and the P-value 
from Pearson's Chi-squared test were presented. An ANCOVA of change from baseline 
in IOP was performed with fixed-effect terms for treatment and baseline for the 3 post-
randomization timepoints (8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM) at Visit 4/Week 2, Visit 5/Week 6, and 
Visit 6/Month 3. An ANCOVA of change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP was also 
performed with fixed-effect terms for treatment and diurnal baseline IOP at each post-
randomization visit.  
 
Safety analyses were performed on the safety population, which included all 
randomized subjects who instilled at least 1 dose of study drug. All AEs were coded 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary version 13.0. 
Ocular TEAEs were summarized for study eyes and treated fellow eyes separately by 
treatment group. Nonocular TEAEs were summarized for each treatment group using 
discrete summaries at the subject and event level by system organ class and preferred 
term. Ocular and nonocular TEAEs were summarized by relationship to study drug and 
severity. Data on BCVA, conjunctival hyperemia, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and 
ophthalmoscopy were presented separately for study eyes and treated fellow eyes and 
summarized using descriptive statistics (BCVA) or categorically (conjunctival 
hyperemia, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy). Conjunctival hyperemia was 
classified as none, mild, moderate, or severe through the use of photographic 
standards.  
 
All CIs, statistical tests, and resulting P-values were reported as 2-sided and were 
evaluated at the 5% significance level. Continuous data were summarized with 
descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Statistical 
analyses were conducted using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, 
USA) version 9.2 or higher. 
 
RESULTS 
 
Subjects 
The LUNAR study was conducted between January 2013 and November 2014. Of 756 
subjects screened, 420 were enrolled and randomized to LBN 0.024% (n=283) or 
timolol 0.5% (n=137), and 387 (92.1%) completed the 3 months of study treatment 
(Figure 1). Overall, 415 subjects received at least 1 instillation of study drug and 
comprised the safety population. The ITT population included 414 subjects (LBN 
0.024%, n=278; timolol 0.5%, n=136). The proportion of subjects in the ITT population 
who completed the study was similar in the LBN 0.024% (259/278; 93.2%) and timolol 
0.5% (128/136; 94.1%) groups.   
 
In the ITT population, subjects were on average 64.7 years of age (range, 23-88 y) and 
were predominantly female (58.2%), white (70.8%), and non-Hispanic/non-Latino 
(86.7%; Table 1). Black/African American subjects comprised 27.8% of the overall

population. Demographic and baseline eye characteristics (mean corneal thickness, 
refraction sphere, and refraction cylinder) were comparable between treatment groups. 
The majority of subjects (72%) had been treated with IOP-lowering medications within 
30 days prior to enrollment. Nonocular medical history was similar between the 
treatment groups. Baseline mean (SD) diurnal IOP (average of IOP at 8 AM, 12 PM and 
4 PM) was 26.6 (2.4) mm Hg for subjects randomized to LBN 0.024% and 26.4 (2.3) mm 
Hg for subjects randomized to timolol 0.5%.  
 
Efficacy 
Primary endpoint 
The mean IOP in the study eye was significantly lower in the LBN 0.024% group than in 
the timolol 0.5% group at the majority of timepoints measured (12 PM, 4 PM at Week 2, 8 
AM, 12 PM, 4 PM at Week 6 and Month 3) (Figure 2 and Table 2). Noninferiority of LBN 
0.024% to timolol 0.5% was demonstrated based on ANCOVA results (upper limit of the 
95% CIs did not exceed 1.0 mm Hg at any of the 9 timepoints) (Table 2). LBN 0.024% 
also met the criteria for statistical superiority over timolol 0.5% at all timepoints except 
the 8 AM timepoint at Week 2 (upper limit of the 95% CI exceeded 0 mm Hg at this 
single assessment point) (Table 2). Results in the PP population were consistent with 
these findings (data not shown). Further exploratory analysis indicated that the primary 
endpoint results did not differ based on prior IOP-lowering medication treatment status 
at enrollment or whether or not subjects on concurrent systemic β-blockers (15.1% of 
LBN and 13.2% of timolol subjects) were included in the analysis (data not shown).  
 
Secondary endpoints 
The percentage of subjects with an IOP reduction ≥25% consistently at all 9 timepoints 
was significantly higher in the LBN group (31.0%) compared with the timolol group 
(18.5%; difference of proportions 12.5%; 95% CI of the difference: 4.0%, 21.1%; 
P=0.007) (Figure 3). The percentage of subjects with mean IOP ≤18 mm Hg 
consistently at all 9 timepoints did not differ in the LBN group compared to the timolol 
group (17.7% vs. 11.1%, respectively; difference of proportions, 6.6%; 95% CI: −0.4%, 
13.5%; P = 0.084) (Figure 3).  
 
Further, ANCOVA showed that the treatment difference for the change from baseline in 
IOP was significantly greater in the LBN 0.024% group than in the timolol 0.05% group 
at all timepoints (IOP range -7.5 to -8.8 mm Hg for LBN 0.024%; -6.6 to -7. 9 mm Hg for 
timolol 0.5%; P≤0.025) except for the 8 AM measurement at Week 2 (-8.3 mm Hg for 
LBN 0.024% vs -7.9 mm Hg for timolol 0.5%; P=0.216).  These changes corresponded 
to a reduction from baseline ranging from 29.1% to 32.1% in the LBN 0.024% group and 
ranging from 25.2% to 28.7% in the timolol treatment group (Supplemental Table 1). 
 
Mean diurnal IOP was significantly lower in the LBN 0.024% group compared to the 
timolol 0.5% group at each visit (18.6 mm Hg vs 19.2 mm Hg at week 2, 18.2 mm Hg vs 
19.1 mm Hg at week 6, and 18.1 mm Hg vs 19.3 mm Hg at Month 3; P≤0.034 for all). 
Similar to the change from baseline at individual time points, the mean change from 
baseline in mean diurnal IOP was significantly greater in the LBN 0.024% group than in 
the timolol 0.5% group at each post-randomization study visit (Week 2, difference, -0.6

Safety 
In the safety population, the mean (SD) days of exposure to study drug was 88.8 (17.6) 
days in the LBN 0.024% group and 91.4 (14.9) days in the timolol 0.5% group. 
 
The percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 ocular TEAE in the study eye 
appeared greater in the LBN 0.024% group than in the timolol 0.5% group (Table 3). 
The most frequently reported ocular TEAEs in LBN treated study eyes were conjunctival 
hyperemia, eye irritation, and eye pain. Only 2 subjects in the LBN 0.024% group 
experienced ocular TEAEs in the study eye that were considered unrelated to study 
drug; all other TEAEs were considered treatment related. With the exception of 1 
incident of severe conjunctival hyperemia in the LBN 0.024% group that was considered 
possibly related to study drug, all ocular TEAEs in the study eye were mild or moderate 
in severity. 
 
At least 1 ocular TEAE in the treated fellow eye was experienced by 24.8% of subjects 
in the LBN 0.024% group and 13.4% of those in the timolol 0.5% group. As with the 
study eye, the most commonly reported ocular TEAEs in the treated fellow eye were 
conjunctival hyperemia (9.3% LBN 0.024%, 0.7% timolol 0.5%), eye irritation (7.0% LBN 
0.024%, 4.5% timolol 0.5%), and eye pain (6.7% LBN 0.024%, 3.0% timolol 0.5%). The 
percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 treatment-related ocular TEAE in the 
treated fellow eye appeared greater in the LBN 0.024% group (23.3%) than in the 
timolol 0.5% group (12.7%). One subject in the LBN 0.024% group experienced severe 
conjunctival hyperemia that was possibly related to study drug; all other ocular TEAEs 
in the treated fellow eye were mild or moderate in severity. 
 
Nonocular TEAEs were reported for 36 (12.9%) LBN subjects and 18 (13.2%) timolol 
0.5% subjects, none of which were considered related to study treatment except for 6 
events in 5 (1.8%) LBN subjects (madarosis, chest discomfort, dysgeusia, headache, 
insomnia, and dyspnea) and 4 events in 2 (1.5%) timolol subjects (headache [2 events], 
dizziness, somnolence). In the LBN group, 15 severe nonocular TEAEs were reported 
(coronary artery disease, cholelithiasis, fall in 2 subjects, head injury, joint dislocation in 
2 subjects, scapular fracture, skin laceration, subdural hemorrhage, ulna fracture, 
arthralgia, convulsion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pulmonary embolism) and were 
considered unrelated or unlikely related to study drug. One severe nonocular TEAE 
(headache) occurred in the timolol 0.5% group and was considered possibly related to 
study drug. All other nonocular TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.  
 
Overall, 4 serious TEAEs were reported by 4 subjects (left shoulder 
subluxation/scapular fracture/fall, coronary artery disease, hepatobiliary disorders and 
head injury in the LBN 0.024%); none were considered related to the study drug. No 
deaths occurred during the 3 month efficacy phase.

There were 4 study discontinuations secondary to AEs in the LBN 0.024% group; 1 was 
deemed definitely related to the study drug (ocular hyperemia), while 3 were deemed 
probably related to the study drug (increased insomnia/respiratory disorder, blurred 
vision/instillation site pain, periocular rash). There was 1 AE-associated study 
discontinuation in the timolol 0.5% group (dizziness/headache which was deemed 
possibly related to study drug).  
 
Vital sign measurements were similar between treatment groups with no treatment-
related trends observed. LogMAR BCVA did not vary during the study. Study eye mean 
(SD) logMAR BCVA in LBN and timolol treatment groups was 0.09 (0.14) and 0.07 
(0.12) at baseline and 0.08 (0.12) and 0.07 (0.13) at 3 months, respectively.  
 
At baseline, 36.8% of subjects in the LBN group and 40.7% of subjects in the timolol 
group were found to have hyperemia in the study eye, mostly mild as evaluated by the 
investigator. At each post-treatment visit, the percentage of subjects with investigator-
assessed conjunctival hyperemia was slightly higher in the LBN treatment group 
compared to the timolol treatment group (Week 2, 47.8% vs. 36.6%; Week 6, 47.8% vs. 
34.1%; Month 3, 48.3% vs. 31.5%) as was the percentage of subjects with conjunctival 
hyperemia considered moderate or severe (Week 2, 6.2% vs. 0.7%; Week 6, 7.5% vs. 
3.0%; Month 3, 6.5% vs. 3.1%). Similar results were found for the treated fellow eye 
(data not shown).  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
The findings from this randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, clinical 
study demonstrate that LBN ophthalmic solution 0.024% QD in the evening effectively 
lowered IOP over 3 months of treatment in subjects with OAG or OHT. Noninferiority to 
timolol 0.5% BID was established by analysis of covariance for the comparison of mean 
IOP. Treatment with LBN also resulted in significantly greater IOP-lowering compared to 
timolol at all assessed timepoints except for the first post-baseline assessment at 8 AM/ 
Week 2 of treatment. As another measure of efficacy, IOP reduction responses were 
evaluated by the number of eyes demonstrating an IOP reduction that was ≥25% lower 
than the baseline value, and nearly twice as many subjects achieved this level of 
reduction across all 9 timepoints in the LBN group compared with the timolol group. 
Likewise, the percentage of subjects with IOP decreased to ≤18 mm Hg across all 9 
timepoints was numerically higher in the LBN group compared to the timolol group, 
although the difference was not statistically significant. 
 
Both LBN and timolol were well tolerated during the 3-month efficacy phase of this 
study. Although low overall, ocular AEs appeared more frequently in the LBN group and 
were mainly attributable to reports of conjunctival hyperemia and ocular irritation. 
Conjunctival hyperemia and ocular irritation were also the most commonly noted AEs 
reported with LBN use in another similarly designed 3-month,  
phase 3 comparison of LBN and timolol in 387 subjects with OAG or OHT.30 Rates of 
hyperemia reported as an adverse event  with LBN in the latter study30 (2.8%-3.6%) 
were generally similar to those observed with timolol (1.5%-2.2%) and were lower than

reported in the current study. According to investigator assessments, conjunctival 
hyperemia was present at baseline in about 40% of subjects in both the current and 
prior study30 and showed slight variations in prevalence over 3 months of treatment with 
LBN use associated with slightly higher rates compared with timolol. Conjunctival 
hyperemia is commonly encountered with the use of ocular antihypertensive therapy32 
including latanoprost,33,34 and was therefore not unexpected whether reported as an AE 
or through prospective investigator evaluation. Other ocular AEs were infrequent and 
observed among similar proportions of patients in both study groups. Other safety 
outcomes were unremarkable.  
 
Landmark studies such as the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS),35 the 
Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT),36,37 the Canadian Glaucoma Study,38 and the 
United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study (UKGTS),11 have demonstrated that in 
glaucoma suspects or patients with manifest glaucoma, the onset and/or progression of 
visual field loss and optic disc deterioration can be delayed by lowering IOP.  Further, 
estimates based on some of these studies suggest that each 1 mm Hg reduction in IOP 
is associated with an approximate 10% to 19% reduction in the risk for glaucoma 
progression.37-39 In both the current study and the previously reported phase 3 trial with 
similar design30 there was an additional 1.2 mm Hg reduction in diurnal IOP with LBN as 
compared to timolol at 3 months. Further, IOP lowering observed with LBN 0.024% in 
these Phase 3 studies30 ranged from 7.5 to 9.1 mm Hg reductions from baseline over 3 
months of treatment. The IOP reductions in the current study corresponded to percent 
decreases from baseline for LBN 0.024% ranging from 29% to 32%. 
 
While phase 3 studies did not evaluate IOP-lowering of LBN against the most commonly 
used glaucoma medication, latanoprost, a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials evaluating the IOP-lowering efficacy of prostaglandin 
analogs found an additional mean IOP lowering of 1.0 mm Hg for latanoprost over 
timolol after 3 months of treatment.40 However, the ability to compare the current data 
with this meta-analysis is limited by multiple factors including differences in baseline 
IOP and study design. Of note, a recent head-to-head phase 2 clinical trial compared 
the IOP lowering efficacy of LBN to latanoprost in patients with POAG and OAG. A 
statistically significant additional IOP lowering of 1.2 mm Hg was observed for LBN over 
latanoprost at 28 days.29 
 
In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that LBN 0.024% once daily in the 
evening is noninferior to timolol 0.5% administered twice daily and results in significantly 
greater IOP lowering over 3 months of treatment in subjects with OAG or OHT. In 
addition, LBN 0.024% treatment resulted in a significantly greater reduction in mean 
diurnal IOP than timolol 0.5% over the course of the study. LBN was well tolerated 
overall and exhibited a safety profile typical of topical prostaglandin analog therapy.
