Vaccines to protect against tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. We performed a
case–control analysis to identify immune correlates of TB disease risk in Bacille
Calmette–Guerin (BCG) immunized infants from the MVA85A efficacy trial. Among 53 TB
case infants and 205 matched controls, the frequency of activated HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells
associates with increased TB disease risk (OR ¼ 1.828, 95% CI ¼ 1.25–2.68, P ¼ 0.002,
FDR ¼ 0.04, conditional logistic regression). In an independent study of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-infected adolescents, activated HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells also associate with
increased TB disease risk (OR ¼ 1.387, 95% CI ¼ 1.068–1.801, P ¼ 0.014, conditional logistic
regression). In infants, BCG-specific T cells secreting IFN-g associate with reduced risk of TB
(OR ¼ 0.502, 95% CI ¼ 0.29–0.86, P ¼ 0.013, FDR ¼ 0.14). The causes and impact of T-cell
activation on disease risk should be considered when designing and testing TB vaccine
candidates for these populations.

 T
uberculosis (TB) causes higher mortality than any other
infectious disease globally and there is an urgent need for
improved vaccines if we are to control the epidemic.
The incidence of TB disease in children under 2 years of age in
the Western Cape of South Africa is estimated to be 1.5% per
annum1. Despite the widespread use of Bacille Calmette–Gue
´rin
(BCG), we do not have an immune correlate of TB risk following
immunization. Defects in cytokine signalling pathways for
interferon (IFN)-g and interleukin (IL)-12 increase susceptibility
to mycobacterial infection in humans2–6, suggesting a role for
these cytokines in protection. HIV infection is also a risk factor,
with TB risk increasing as CD4 T-cell counts decline7. Animal
studies have confirmed the importance of CD4 T cells and IFN-g
in
protection
from
TB
disease8,9
and
have
guided
the
development of new candidate TB vaccines, which increase
immunity against M. tuberculosis through boosting of a Th1 type
cellular immune response10. However, results from an immune
correlates study in BCG-vaccinated infants from the Western
Cape of South Africa did not find BCG antigen-specific Th1
cytokine-secreting T cells to be associated with reduced TB
disease risk11, and the Th1 boosting candidate TB vaccine
MVA85A (Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara expressing Ag85A
from M. tuberculosis) did not improve protection in BCG-
vaccinated infants12. To aid the development of more effective TB
vaccines, there is an urgent need to identify immune correlates of
TB disease risk. Although MVA85A did not protect against TB
disease beyond that conferred by BCG alone, all infants were
vaccinated with BCG at birth and analysis of samples collected
from infants subsequently diagnosed as TB cases in the trial
provided an opportunity to identify correlates of TB risk12. We
performed a case–control study on cryopreserved blood samples
using immune assays, that measured both BCG-specific and
non-specific immune responses with the aim of identifying
immune
variables,
which
correlate
with
disease
risk
in
BCG-vaccinated infants. In BCG-vaccinated infants, activated
HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells associate with increased risk of TB and
BCG-specific T cells secreting IFN-g associate with reduced risk
of TB disease over the next 3 years of life. The causes and impact
of T-cell activation should be considered when designing and
testing candidate TB vaccines.
Results
Primary analysis. Blood samples for immunologic assessment
were obtained from all infants within 7 days before vaccination
with either MVA85A or placebo (D0) and 28 days (D28) fol-
lowing vaccination (Fig. 1). We performed ex vivo IFN-g ELI-
SPOT and mycobacterial growth inhibition assays (MGIAs) to
assess antigen-specific T-cell responses, performed ELISA to
assess antibody responses and characterized cells using flow-
cytometry with cell surface staining for Live/Dead cells followed
by staining with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD25,
CD127 and HLA-DR.
Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the
association between D0 immune response and risk of TB disease.
To adjust for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate
(FDR) was calculated for each variable using the method of
Benjamini and Hochberg13. Of the 22 pre-specified immune
response variables evaluated, the frequency of D0 activated
HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells was associated with increased risk of
TB disease (estimated odds ratio (OR) 1.12 per 1 unit increase,
P ¼ 0.002, FDR ¼ 0.047; Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The
frequency of D0 CD4 þ T cells (estimated OR 0.95 per 1 unit
increase, P ¼ 0.027, FDR ¼ 0.198) and the magnitude of D0
BCG-specific T cells secreting IFN-g (estimated OR 0.46 per 1
log10 unit increase, P ¼ 0.03, FDR ¼ 0.198) were associated with
reduced risk of TB disease (Fig. 2a,c). For subsequent assessment
of linearity of the immune parameters, we classified immune
responses into low, medium and high categories based on tertiles
of the data (Fig. 2).
In a whole blood intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay,
performed on a subset of infants, it was found that the response
to BCG was predominantly a CD4 þ T-cell-mediated polyfunc-
tional response characterized by the production of IFN-g,
tumour-necrosis factor-a and IL-2 (Fig. 3).
Exploratory analysis suggested that D28 post-boost vaccination
Ag85A-specific IgG antibodies were also associated with reduced
TB disease risk (estimated OR ¼ 0.62 per 1 log10 unit increase,
P ¼ 0.019). None of the immune variables were able to predict TB
disease risk with an area under the receiver operating character-
istic (AUROC) above 0.8. The box-plot of each immune response
variable, stratified by case–control status is shown in Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 2. Variables that did not associate with TB
disease risk included D0 purified protein derivative (PPD) IFN-g
ELISpot (estimated OR ¼ 0.72, P ¼ 0.453) and D28 Ag85A
peptide IFN-g ELISpot (estimated OR ¼ 0.69, P ¼ 0.183) and
the D0 MGIA (estimated OR ¼ 0.31, P ¼ 0.318; Table 1). The
magnitude of the IFN-g ELISpot response to mycobacterial
antigens was low. However, cells were functionally able to secrete
IFN-g as B25% of infants responded to cytomegalovirus (CMV)
stimulation with responses ranging to 41,000 spot-forming cells
(SFCs) per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Activated HLA-DR þ CD4 þ and CD8 þ
T cells were highly correlated with each other (R ¼ 0.53
Po0.0001) and both populations were inversely correlated with
total CD4 þ
T cells (R ¼ � 0.427
Po0.0001, R ¼ � 0.391
Po0.0001, respectively; Supplementary Table 1). There was a
positive correlation between CMV IFN-g ELISpot and the
magnitude of HLA-DR þ CD8 þ T cells (R ¼ 0.301 Po0.0001;
Supplementary Table 1).
Impact of MVA85A vaccination on immune correlates. There
was no significant difference by MVA85A or placebo groups at
either D0 or D28 when treatment group (MVA85A or placebo)
was included as an interaction term in the analysis. Results for
HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells including treatment group (MVA85A
or placebo) as an interaction term in the analysis are shown in
Supplementary Table 2.
The day 28 analysis is potentially confounded as Ag85A
antibodies are induced by MVA85A immunization and for
8 case infants the matched controls were all from the placebo
arm and for 3 placebo infants the matching controls were all
from the MVA85A arm. To explore the possibility of any
confounding effect of mixed control infants from MVA85A and
placebo arms the D28 conditional logistic regression analysis was
performed separately on infants only from the MVA85A group
and
only
the
placebo
group.
Results
are
presented
in
Supplementary Table 3. There is no statistical significance for
any immune variable when infants are analysed separately by
study group (likely due to the reduced sample size only B25 case
infants in each analysis). However, the OR for each immune
variable remains in the same direction as reported for the primary
analysis.
Relative contribution to disease risk. To compare the relative
effect size of the different immune response variables, we used
z-score transformation to scale each variable to a standard
deviation of 1 and performed conditional logistic regression on
z-score transformed data (Supplementary Table 4). The OR for
Ag85A IgG adjusted from 0.62 to 0.74, for CD4 þ T cells from
0.95 to 0.65, for BCG ELISpot from 0.46 to 0.502 and for HLA-
DR þ CD4 þ from 1.12 to 1.83.

 The relative effect of TB disease risk is therefore smallest for
Ag85A IgG followed by CD4 þ T cells, BCG ELISpot and greatest
for HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells.
HLA-DRþ CD4þ T cells in M. tuberculosis-infected adolescents.
We retrieved cryopreserved PBMC from healthy, South African,
M. tuberculosis-infected adolescents previously enrolled into the
Adolescent Cohort Study (ACS)14, to determine if frequencies
of HLA-DR- expressing CD4 þ T cells were also associated with
risk of progression to TB disease in this independent cohort.
HLA-DR-expressing CD4 þ T cells were measured in 61 samples
from
30
adolescents
who
progressed
to
microbiologically
confirmed incident TB and in 132 samples from 59 matched
controls
who
remained
healthy.
Overall,
frequencies
of
HLA-DR-expressing CD4 þ T cells were higher in adolescents
who progressed to TB disease compared with matched controls
who did not progress to disease OR ¼ 1.387, 95% confidence
interval (CI) ¼ 1.068–1.801, P ¼ 0.014 (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Using
conditional logistic regression, the difference between controls
and progressors was significant at all time points before diagnosis
of TB disease (Table 2). However, the OR increased at times
closer to TB diagnosis (Table 2).
Risk of TB disease by category of immune response. To assess
the linearity assumption of the conditional logistic regression
based on a continuous immune response variable, we classified
immune responses into low, medium and high categories based
on tertiles of the data (Fig. 2). Conditional logistic regression was
then used to analyse the association between immune response
category and risk of TB disease (Supplementary Table 5). For
HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells, the risk was greatest for higher
responders (OR ¼ 1.97, 95% CI ¼ 0.86–4.46), and for BCG
ELISpot (OR ¼ 0.2, 95% CI ¼ 0.009–0.91) and CD4 þ T cells
(OR ¼ 0.41, 95% CI ¼ 0.17–1.01), the risk was lowest for higher
responders, confirming the linearity of response. For Ag85A IgG,
medium responders were at lowest risk at D0 (OR ¼ 0.28,
95% CI ¼ 0.0098–0.79) but at D28 the response was linear,
with the lowest risk in the higher responders (OR ¼ 0.29,
95% CI ¼ 0.12–0.72).

Figure 1 | Cohort of infants from the MVA85A efficacy trial included in this immune correlates case–control study. At 4–6 months of age, blood was
collected from HIV-negative, HIV unexposed BCG-vaccinated infants with no active or chronic illnesses (including suspected TB), and with no household
exposure to an adult who had active TB disease. Infants were then randomized to receive either MVA85A or placebo and followed for 2–3 years. TB cases
(n ¼ 71) were defined by a positive culture for M. tuberculosis or the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA using a certified molecular diagnostic assay; or a
stringent composite end point, which included symptoms, radiological signs and an exposure history. Control infants (n ¼ 213) had no evidence of TB
exposure, no evidence of TB infection on interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and were matched (3 controls to 1 case) on age, race, time on study and
CDC weight percentile.

 To determine if there were any time-dependent effects of
immune correlates on risk of TB disease, we examined TB disease
risk by time for case infants. The risk of TB disease by time for
each tertile of immune response category for D0 HLA-DR þ
CD4 þ T cells, BCG-specific IFN-g ELISpot response, CD4 þ
T cells and Ag85A-specific IgG are shown in Fig. 5. The main
effect of BCG ELISpot appears to be early in the first 6–12 months
of the follow-up period, whereas the effect is more evenly
distributed by time for the other immune variables (Fig. 5).

The
Mann–Whitney test was used to assess the effect of time and
vaccination status on Ag85A-specific IgG for the infant cases and
corresponding controls with antibody data at either D0 or D28.
The median optical density (OD; 405 nm) at D0 was 1.477 (inter
quartile range (IQR) ¼ 0.815–2.173) and did not differ by vacci-
nation status (P ¼ 0.51). MVA85A-vaccinated infants experi-
enced a median increase of 1.226 OD by D28 (Po0.0001),
whereas control infants experienced a mean increase of 0.425

 (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 6). The difference between the vaccine and control
group at D28 is highly significant (Po0.0001). However, the
exact quantity of antibody in the MVA85A group is unknown as
the upper limit of detection of the ELISA is B3 OD and many
infants in the MVA85A group were near the upper limit of
detection at D28.
Discussion
In this primary correlates of risk analysis, we have demonstrated
that activated HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells were associated with
subsequent risk of TB disease. This finding was replicated in an
independent cohort of M. tuberculosis-infected adolescents who
either progressed to active TB disease, or who remained healthy
over 2 years of follow-up. We have also shown that BCG-specific
IFN-g-secreting T cells
measured
by ELISpot assay
were
associated with a reduced risk of TB disease in infants.
BCG-specific IFN-g-secreting T cells were not measured in the
adolescent cohort. The effect of BCG-specific IFN-g-secreting T
cells in infants was linear with higher numbers of IFN-g-secreting
T cells associated with a greater reduction in risk of TB disease.
The main effect of IFN-g-secreting T cells appeared to be in the
first 6–12 months of follow-up, suggesting an early protective
effect of BCG-specific IFN-g-secreting T cells in infancy.

 progression but this is the first report of an association between
T-cell activation and TB disease risk15–18. Although BCG
immunization has been shown to drive early BCG-specific
CD4 þ T-cell activation in this infant population, we do not
know if BCG immunization is driving T-cell activation or if other
factors such as immunization with extended programme of
immunisation (EPI) vaccines or infection with pathogens is
contributing to T-cell activation19. Infection with CMV has been
shown to drive T-cell activation in HIV-positive patients and we
did observe a correlation between T-cell activation and CMV
ELISpot response in this study20,21. In an immune phenotyping
study, differences in T-cell activation were largely associated with
environmental and not genetic factors, with CMV identified as
the major microbial driver of immune variation22. The factors
that drive variation in BCG efficacy include previous exposure to
mycobacteria, age and proximity to the equator23; these factors
have all been associated with increased T-cell activation24–30. The
elevated CD4 T-cell activation observed in M. tuberculosis-
infected
progressors
coincides
with
an
elevated
type
I/II
interferon signature, which is suggestive of incipient or sub-
clinical TB (Zak et al.,31 in the press), suggesting a possible link
between bacterial replication and T-cell activation. Primary CMV
infection typically peaks at birth and again in adolescence32,33
and may also be contributing to T-cell activation in this
adolescent cohort. However, it is likely that there are other,
unknown factors driving immune activation in the adolescents,
and that these may be different to those driving CD4 T-cell
activation in infants. Ultimately, multiple mechanisms of CD4
T-cell activation may be associated with risk of TB.
The cellular immune response to BCG administered at birth in
South African infants peaks at 6–10 weeks19. The samples
collected here were 16–20 weeks post BCG immunization and we
see an association between BCG-specific IFN-g ELISpot response
and reduced TB disease risk. The importance of an intact
Th1 type cellular immune response in protective immunity has
been demonstrated in human genetic studies and murine
M. tuberculosis challenge experiments2–6,8–9, however, this is
the first time a role has been demonstrated for magnitude of
vaccine-induced IFN-g-secreting T cells and reduced TB disease
risk in a human immune correlates study11. A previous study in
this infant population found no association of IFN-g with TB
disease risk11. Our study differs in several aspects, which could
explain the contrasting results including the time point (age) at
which the response was measured (at peak or post-peak), IFN-g
assay used (ELISpot versus intracellular cytokine assay), sample
type (PBMC versus whole blood), statistical design, more
stringent TB case definition and different control definition. In
infants, the magnitude of the MVA85A-boosted Ag85A, PPD and
BCG-specific IFN-g ELISpot response is lower than that of UK
adults, children or adolescents12,34–36. It is possible that the lack
of efficacy with MVA85A was due to insufficient boosting of a
Th1 type immune response in infants.
An unexpected finding was the association of Ag85A-specific
IgG measured at D28 (5–7 months of age) with reduced risk of
TB. Ag85A-specific IgG increased from D0 to D28 in both
treatment groups in this study. Antibody response are likely
primed by BCG vaccination at birth. However, they could also be
rising due to exposure to environmental mycobacteria. In a
cohort of 66 BCG-vaccinated infants in Turkey, PPD-specific IgG
levels began to rise at 4 months of age and progressively increased
through to the end of the study at 15 months of age37. Although
there are no published studies describing BCG-specific antibody
responses in South African infants, it is possible that Ag85A IgG
would have a similar kinetic and would be rising in this infant
cohort at the time of randomization.

 Although the Ag85A IgG response was boosted after vaccina-
tion with MVA85A, there was no significant effect of vaccination
status when included as a main effect in our D28 analysis. It is
possible that the infant Ag85A antibody response induced by
MVA85A was short-lived or that the protective effect of induced
antibodies was masked as Ag85A IgG antibodies were also rising
in the placebo group in this study. It is also possible that in BCG-
vaccinated infants Ag85A IgG is not directly linked with reduced
risk but is correlated with an alternative protective immune
mechanism induced by BCG. We did not see any significant
differences using a MGIA between case and control infants. The
lack of difference could be due to sample size or lack of sensitivity
of the assay; however, we did not use autologous serum in the
MGIA assay and would not therefore have measured any
potential effect of antibodies on the control of mycobacterial
growth in infant PBMC.
The immune correlates identified in this study would ideally be
confirmed in independent clinical studies in BCG-vaccinated
infants. However, the infant population in the Western Cape in
South Africa has the highest incidence of non-HIV-associated TB
recorded in the world at a rate of 1.39 per hundred person
years12. With such a low incidence rate, the MVA85A trial had to
enrol 2,797 infants who were followed up for a median of 24.6
months at a total cost of B30 million US dollars to gain sufficient
power to determine differences between the placebo and
MVA85A arms. The finding that T-cell immunogenicity is
reduced in infants compared with adults with MVA85A and
other subunit vaccines in development, together with the
realization that an adolescent vaccine would have a greater
impact on transmission, has led to a refocusing within the field on
adolescents as the most important target population38. However,
the TB incidence rate in adolescents and adults is even lower than
in infants and a TB vaccine efficacy trial will therefore be more
costly and lengthy in these populations than it was in infants14.
Nonetheless, we have identified CD4 þ T-cell activation as a
potential correlate of TB disease risk in BCG-vaccinated infants
and have confirmed this finding in an independent adolescent
cohort. Moreover, we have identified BCG-specific IFN-g T cells
as a correlate of reduced risk in infants, supporting the concept
of Th1 boosting in TB vaccine design. We also identified
Ag85A-specific IgG as a potential novel immune correlate of
TB disease risk in BCG-vaccinated infants, suggesting a possible

 role for both Ag85A antibodies and BCG-specific IFN-g T cells in
protection from TB disease. However, these responses may be
impaired by T-cell activation and the impact of T-cell activation
on disease risk should be considered when designing and testing
TB vaccine candidates for these populations.
Methods
Case–control design. Infants who were BCG vaccinated within 7 days of birth and
enrolled in an efficacy trial of the candidate TB vaccine MVA85A were included
in this case–control study, ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00953927 (Fig. 1).
HIV-negative infants testing negative with QuantiFERON TB Gold In-tube test
(QuantiFERON), and without known TB exposure were randomized at 4–6
months of age to receive a single intradermal dose of MVA85A or placebo (Candin,
a candida skin test antigen)12. The trial was approved by the University of Cape
Town Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee, Oxford
University Tropical Research Ethics Committee and the Medicines Control Council
of South Africa. Informed consent was obtained from the mothers of all infants.
The case definition for TB disease was isolation of M. tuberculosis by culture or
identification of M. tuberculosis by Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) plus evidence
of mycobacterial infection defined as two acid-fast-positive smears or
QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test conversion from negative to positive or
tuberculin skin test Z15 mm plus radiographic findings compatible with TB and
clinical manifestations compatible with TB. Infants who met the primary case
definition for TB were included as cases. For each case, three control infants were
randomly selected from a pool of control infants. Infants from both the placebo
and MVA85A-immunized groups were combined into one control pool for
selection. Infants were included in the control pool if they did not convert to latent
TB infection based on the QuantiFERON TB Gold In-tube test, had not received
TB treatment and had not received TB preventative therapy during study
follow-up. Matching was based on gender, ethnic group, Centre for Disease
Control (CDC) weight-for-age percentile (±10 points) and time on study (±9
months). Infant PBMC samples stored in liquid nitrogen were available for 55 of 71
TB case infants and for 205 of 213 matched controls (Fig. 1). Viability of thawed
PBMC was assessed using flow cytometry with Live/Dead Violet stain (Invitrogen)
and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was included as a positive control for cell viability
on ELISpot plates. For the majority of case infants, controls were from both the
placebo and MVA85A arms of the study. However, for eight case infants, the
matched controls were all from the placebo arm, and for three placebo infants, the
matching controls were all from the MVA85A arm. Controls for whom the case is
missing a blood sample are excluded from the analysis.
Immune response variables. A series of pilot experiments using cellular samples
from the MVA85A efficacy trial were performed to select immune response
variables for this study39. Infants selected for these pilot studies were non-case,
non-control infants receiving either MVA85A or placebo39. Results are described
by Harris et al., and methods are summarized in Supplementary Table 6 (ref. 39).
As cell number was limited and the magnitude of the antigen-specific immune
response was low12,39, we selected assays that measured different components of
the immune response, and those assays which did not correlate with each other.
Immune assays that were initially reviewed for inclusion in this correlates analysis
and ultimately selected are listed in Supplementary Tables 6 and 7.
ELISpot responses were log10-transformed and where the response was zero,
a value of 0.3 log10 was used. For analysis of IFN-g, samples were only included if
PHAZ1,000 SFCs per million PBMCs. For all other analyses, samples were
included if the percentage of live T cells was Z50% or if flow cytometry was
not performed on that sample then PHAZ1,000 SFCs per million PBMCs.
Ag85A-specific IgG in the plasma was measured as an exploratory analysis by
ELISA. The laboratory staff performing the assays were blinded to case–control and
vaccine group status of infant samples.
Ex vivo IFN-c ELISpot assay. The ex vivo IFN-g ELISpot assay was performed
using a human IFN-g ELISpot kit (capture mAb -D1K; Mabtech). Duplicate wells
containing 3 � 105 PBMC were stimulated for 18 h with antigen, PHA as a positive
control or media alone as a negative control. Antigens were: a single pool of Ag85A
peptides, consisting of 66 15-mer peptides, overlapping by 10 amino acids
(2 mg ml � 1 per peptide; Peptide Protein Research); BCG from pooled SSI vaccine
vials (2 � 105 colony-forming units (CFUs) per ml); PPD from M. tuberculosis
(20 mg ml � 1; Statens Serum Institute (SSI)); pools of peptides with knows CD8
T-cell epitopes from flu, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and CMV peptides (10 mg ml � 1
per peptide; Peptide Protein Research); and combined TB10.3 and TB10.4 peptides
(10 mg ml � 1 per peptide; Peptide Protein Research). Results are reported as SFCs
per million PBMCs, calculated by subtracting the mean of the unstimulated wells
from the mean of antigen wells and correcting for the numbers of PBMC in the
wells. A response was considered positive if the mean number of spots in the
antigen well was at least twice the mean of the unstimulated wells and at least five
spots greater.
Cell surface flow cytometry. PBMC were washed and stained with 5 ml Live/Dead
Violet (Invitrogen) followed by surface staining with the following titrated
antibodies: 0.5 ml CD3-AF700 (clone UCHT1, Ebioscience), 2 ml CD4-APC
(clone RPA-T4, BioLegend), 2 ml CD8-Efluor605 (clone RPA-T8, Ebioscience),
2 ml CD14-PE/Cy7 (clone HCD14, BioLegend), 2 ml CD16-AF488 (clone 3G8,
BioLegend), 1 ml CD19-PE/Cy5 (clone HIB19, BioLegend), 2 ml CD25-APC/Cy7
(clone BC96, BioLegend), 2 ml CD127-NC650 (clone eBioRDR5, Ebioscience),
15 ml HLA-DR-PE (clone L243 BioLegend). Fluorescence minus one controls were
used to set gates for CD25, CD127 and HLA-DR. Samples were acquired on a BD
LSR II flow cytometer. Results are presented as percentages of cells after gating out
of dead cells and doublets. CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells were identified as CD3 þ cells,
whereas CD14 þ / � and CD16 þ / � cells were identified as CD3 � and CD19 �
populations. CD25 þ CD27 � populations were gated on the CD4 þ cells.
Mycobacterial growth inhibition assay. Duplicate 2-ml screw-cap tubes
containing 1 � 106 PBMCs in 600 ml of medium were rotated at 37 �C with
B600 CFUs of BCG Pasteur stock for 4 days. The PBMCs were then lysed with
sterile water, and the lysate transferred to a Bactec MGIT supplemented with
PANTA antibiotics and OADC enrichment broth. The tube was placed in a Bactec
MGIT 960 and incubated until growth was detected (time to positivity).
Ag85A IgG ELISA. Nunc immunoplates were coated overnight at 4 �C with 50 ml
sodium carbonate buffer containing 1.5 mg ml � 1 recombinant antigen 85A protein.
Plates and reagents were brought to room temperature and the plate washed
three times with PBS, 5% Tween-20 (v/v). Plates were blocked for 1 h at room
temperature with 100 ml blocking buffer (PBS, 5% Milk Blocking (w/v). All serum
samples were diluted 1/100 with PBS, 5% Milk Blocking (w/v) and 50 ml of each
diluted sample was plated in triplicate. Controls and plate blanks consisting of
assay diluent alone with no serum were added in triplicate. Plates were sealed and
incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing 50 ml of a 1:500 dilution of
goat anti-human (KPL) detection antibody was added to each well for 1 h at room
temperature. For colour development, 50 ml TMB (BD) was added to each well.
Plates were incubated for 15 min in the dark before the reaction was stopped by
adding 50 ml of 2 M Sulfuric Acid (Sigma) to each well. Absorbance was measured
using a microplate reader at 450 nm.
Statistical analysis. Prior to data analysis, a statistical analysis plan was prepared
in which primary and secondary analyses were defined and the methods of analysis
were specified (available on request). Briefly, 22 primary immune variables were
selected for inclusion in the case–control study (Supplementary Table 7). For each
variable, a conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association
between D0 immune response and risk of TB disease. To adjust for multiple
comparisons, the FDR was calculated for each variable using the method of
Benjamini and Hochberg13. FDR values less than or equal to 0.2 were considered
significant. To assess the predictive value of an immune variable, the AUROC curve
was computed. Immune variables with AUROC values above 0.80 were considered
good predictors of TB disease risk.
Secondary analyses included conditional logistic regression analysis of D28
immune responses for each of the primary variables. Regression models with and
without vaccination status (MVA85A or placebo) included as a main effect were
examined. In addition to the primary variables, D0 and D28 Ag85A-specific IgG
antibody levels were analysed by conditional logistic regression.
Immune response variables that were significant at D0 or D28, were categorized
as low, medium or high based on tertiles and conditional logistic regression was
performed to assess linearity. To explore any time-dependent effect of immune
correlates, plots of the cumulative hazard function (Breslow estimator) for immune
response variables (by tertile of immune response) were plotted for case
infants only.
The change in antibody from D0 to D28 was assessed using generalized
estimating equations as described in Yang and Tsiatis40. For our setting, the cluster
variable was limited to participant ID and ignored the matching. However, only
controls for whom the case had data were included. We also used an unstructured
covariance matrix to describe the variance in antibody titres over time.
Outliers as defined by Tukey’s rule were excluded from the primary analysis.
Outliers were identified via a review of the distribution of the variables. Tukey’s
rule, which provides a distribution-free method for identification of outliers, was be
used to set upper and lower limits for preliminary review and identification of
outliers. After determining the 25th and 75th percentiles, the upper limit is set as
P75 þ 3 times the interquartile range, or P75-P25. Likewise, the lower limit is
P25—3(P75-P25). Following this review, only outliers which were identified and
determined to be the result of contamination, operator error or mechanical failure
were excluded from the primary analyses. For the day 0 primary analysis, out of
3,918 total measurements across 22 immune variables, 19 data points were
identified as statistical outliers (Supplementary Table 8). Following investigation of
the raw data, 12 out of 19 data points were retained and 7 data points excluded.
Exclusions were due to high background in the ELISpot assay or PHA response
o1,000 SFCs per million PBMCs.

 The ACS. We used samples from the ACS for validation of the finding that
elevated HLA-DR þ CD4 þ T cells correlated with risk of TB. The ACS was a
prospective epidemiological cohort study of M. tuberculosis infection and TB
disease in adolescents, aged 12–18 years, from the Western Cape of South Africa14.
A total of 6,363 adolescents were recruited at high schools and followed for
2 years. Latent M. tuberculosis infection was diagnosed by tuberculin skin test or
QuantiFERON Gold in Tube assay and PBMCs were collected at enrolment and
end of study (24 months) in all, and in an active follow-up group also at 6, 12 and
18 months31. Participants suspected of having TB were investigated through
sputum smears, culture and chest X-ray. A protocol-defined incident case of TB
was any case confirmed by two or more sputum smears positive for acid-fast bacilli
and/or one positive sputum culture for M. tuberculosis. After excluding individuals
with a previous history of TB disease, we examined the frequency of HLA-DR-
expressing CD4 þ T cells in 61 progressor samples (from 30 progressor
adolescents) and 132 control samples (from 59 matched control adolescents). All
available PBMC samples from progressors and matched controls were included in
the analysis. Controls were matched on age, gender, ethnicity and high school.
HLA-DR-expressing CD4 þ T cells were measured in PBMC by first gating on
singlet cells, then selecting cells with consistent fluorescence during acquisition
(time gate), followed by a side scatter/CD45 gate to select lymphocytes. Thereafter
CD14 � CD3 þ T cells and then CD4 þ CD8 � cells were selected. Frequencies of
HLA-DR-expressing CD4 þ T cells are reported as a proportion of total live CD4 þ
T cells. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression as described above
comparing progressors to matched controls.
