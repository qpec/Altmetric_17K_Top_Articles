T
hienopyridines including clopidogrel, prasugrel, and 
ticlopidine are antiplatelet medications that inhibit 
P2Y12 adenosine phosphate receptor on platelets and impair 
its activation.1 These are prodrugs that require conversion 
to active forms with cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, mainly 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.2 Because of their favorable profile 
(especially clopidogrel and prasugrel) and efficacy for plate-
let inhibition, thienopyridines have been increasingly used 
for secondary prevention of cardiovascular,3 peripheral vas-
cular,4 and cerebrovascular diseases.1 Proton pump inhibi-
tors (PPI) are often used concomitantly with thienopyridines 
in these patients as gastroprotective agents to prevent gas-
trointestinal bleeding.5,6 However, as PPIs are competitive 
inhibitors of cytochrome P450 pathway, pharmacodynamic 
data suggests significant interaction between PPIs and thi-
enopyridines,1 predisposing to major adverse cardiovascular 
events including stroke.
Majority of the studies on PPI and thienopyridine inter-
action have focused over cardiovascular outcomes, whereas 
only few studies have reported adverse cerebrovascular out-
comes.7–14 Individual studies have been unable to ascertain the 
risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in patients with concomitant use 
of clopidogrel and PPIs.15 Furthermore, absence of evidence-
based guidelines and lack of clear consensus poses a clini-
cal conundrum for PPI used along with thienopyridines.8,16,17 
Because of insufficient data, we aimed to synthesize the 
Background and Purpose—Pharmacokinetic and prior studies on thienopyridine and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) 
coadministration provide conflicting data for cardiovascular outcomes, whereas there is no established evidence on the 
association of concomitant use of PPI and thienopyridines with adverse cerebrovascular outcomes.
Methods—We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies from 
inception to July 2017, reporting following outcomes among patients treated with thienopyridine and PPI versus 
thienopyridine alone (1) ischemic stroke, (2) combined ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, (3) composite outcome of stroke, 
myocardial infarction (MI), and cardiovascular death, (4) MI, (5) all-cause mortality, and (6) major or minor bleeding 
events. After the unadjusted analyses of risk ratios, we performed additional analyses of studies reporting hazard ratios 
adjusted for potential confounders.
Results—We identified 22 studies (12 randomized controlled trials and 10 cohort studies) comprising 131 714 patients. 
Concomitant use of PPI with thienopyridines was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (risk ratio, 1.74; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41–2.16; P<0.001), composite stroke/MI/cardiovascular death (risk ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 
1.01–1.29; P=0.04), and MI (risk ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.40; P=0.05). Likewise, in adjusted analyses concomitant 
use of PPI with thienopyridines was again associated with increased risk of stroke (hazard ratios adjusted, 1.30; 95% 
CI, 1.04–1.61; P=0.02), composite stroke/MI/cardiovascular death (hazard ratios adjusted, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03–1.47; 
P=0.02), but not with MI (hazard ratios adjusted, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93–1.52; P=0.16).
Conclusions—Co-prescription of PPI and thienopyridines increases the risk of incident ischemic strokes and composite stroke/
MI/cardiovascular death. Our findings corroborate the current guidelines for PPI deprescription and pharmacovigilance, 
especially in patients treated with thienopyridines.

evidence of co-prescription of PPIs with thienopyridines on 
adverse cerebrovascular outcomes.
Methods
The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the 
article (and its online supplementary files). Our meta-analysis adopted 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines18 and is reported in accordance with the meta-analysis of 
observational studies in epidemiology proposal.19 We used publicly 
available published studies, and our study was exempt for approval 
from Institutional Review Board.
Data Sources and Database Searches
We identified all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
cohort studies that investigated the association of PPI with thi-
enopyridines. Systematic search was performed in PubMed, Ovid 
MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase databases from the inception to July 
20, 2017. Our literature was restricted to involve human participants 
and articles in English language. Keywords used to query all the 
databases included stroke, PPI, clopidogrel, prasugrel hydrochloride, 
and ticlopidine. The complete search algorithm used in MEDLINE 
is available in the online-only Data Supplement. Additional manual 
search included conference abstracts and bibliographies of candidate 
studies and recent systematic reviews for a comprehensive literature 
search.
Study Selection
We identified studies that investigated cerebrovascular outcomes in 
patients on thienopyridines treated with or without PPIs. The inclu-
sion criteria for our study were (1) studies including patients treated 
with thienopyridine and PPI versus thienopyridine alone as the pri-
mary inclusion criteria; (2) studies with documented adverse cere-
brovascular outcomes as either primary or secondary end points; (3) 
studies with a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months; and (4) adult 
patients (>18 years old).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two authors (Drs Malhotra and Bilal) independently screened all the 
titles or abstracts, and later evaluated all the relevant articles based 
on the full-text reviews. From the articles meeting our selection cri-
teria, all unadjusted and adjusted data for potential confounders was 
extracted and disagreements, if any, were resolved with mutual con-
sensus. Studies published as post hoc analysis of RCTs that compared 
different class of thienopyridines were considered as separate studies. 
Following data were extracted author, publication year, trial name, 
total number and type of study participants, prevalence of cerebro-
vascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes 
mellitus, alcohol intake, smoking, prior histories of stroke or transient 
ischemic attack and myocardial infarction (MI), primary and second-
ary end points, and follow-up duration.
Cochrane risk of bias assessment was used to evaluate the potential 
sources of bias in the included RCTs,20 whereas the quality of cohort 
studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale.21 Quality 
control and bias identification were performed independently by 2 
reviewers, and disagreements if any, were resolved by a third tie-
breaking evaluator.
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis
We calculated corresponding relative risk ratios (RR) and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) to measure the effect size while comparing 
the thienopyridines use with and without PPIs. We additionally per-
formed adjusted analyses on the effect of coadministration of thieno-
pyridines with PPIs by including only those studies reporting hazard 
ratios (HRs). We also performed subgroup analyses according to the 
thienopyridine type for the outcomes of all stroke and the composite 
outcome of stroke, MI, and cardiovascular death (CVD). Finally, we 
conducted additional analyses of studies on the subgroup of patients 
with history of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. As 
per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,22 
we assessed for heterogeneity using Cochran Q and I2 statistics. For 
the qualitative interpretation of heterogeneity, I2>50% and I2>75% 
indicated substantial and considerable heterogeneity, respectively. 
Publication bias across individual studies was graphically evaluated 
using a funnel plot,23 whereas funnel plot asymmetry was assessed 
using Egger linear regression test with P<0.10 significance level. A 
random-effects model (DerSimonian Laird) was used to calculate the 
pooled RRs and HRs in both the overall and subgroup analyses. We 
performed equivalent z test for each pooled RR or HR, and a 2-tailed 
P values of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.24

Results
Study Selection and Study Characteristics
We screened 5584 titles and abstracts from which 47 eligi-
ble studies were retained for full-text evaluation. After care-
ful evaluation and no disagreements among the 2 reviewers, 
25 studies were excluded (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement) and 22 studies were selected that met the inclu-
sion criteria (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
One study by Kimura et al25 was excluded as 90% of patients 
were treated with ticlopidine, whereas neither of the included 
studies evaluated ticlopidine likely because of its unfavorable 
adverse effect profile.
We included 22 studies (131 714 participants; median 
follow-up of 12 months) with 12 RCTs (n=68 296 partici-
pants)8,26–32 and 10 observational studies (n=63 418; Table 1).7,9–
14,33–35 The baseline characteristics of the included patients are 
presented in Table II in the online-only Data Supplement. 
Sixteen trials included patients with acute coronary syndrome, 
2 trials involved high cardiovascular risk patients with previ-
ous history of stroke, MI, or peripheral artery disease, 2 stud-
ies involved patients with peptic ulcer disease, and 2 studies 
involved patients with IS. Five cohort studies were prospec-
tively and 7 studies were retrospectively conducted, whereas 
remaining 10 studies were post hoc analysis of major RCTs. 
Seven studies were conducted in North America, 6 studies 
in Europe, 4 studies in Asia, whereas remaining were mul-
tinational studies. Cerebrovascular outcomes were reported 
as IS,8–10,12,26,33 stroke,7,11,13,14,31,33,34 and composite stroke/MI/
CVD.8,11,26–32
Study Quality and Publication Bias
The majority of RCTs had high risk of selection, performance 
and detection bias, as the majority of the studies were post hoc 
or subgroup analysis of RCTs. All or majority of the included 
RCTs had low risk of reporting bias, attrition bias, and other 
biases (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Risk of bias among the cohort studies was assessed using 
Newcastle–Ottawa scale (Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The risk of selection and comparability bias 
was considered low in all the studies except one,34 as the study 
did not adjust for potential confounders. Outcome bias was 
counted as moderate for studies that did not report the data on 
patients lost to follow-up,11,12,14,35 or the follow-up period was

inadequate.33 The overall score of Newcastle–Ottawa scale 
was 80/90 (88.8%), which is considered to represent an over-
all high quality.
Funnel plot inspection and Egger statistical test revealed 
no evidence of asymmetry in both studies reporting the out-
come of stroke (6 studies; P=0.43; Figure II in the online-only 
Data Supplement) and composite stroke/MI/CVD (P=0.873; 
Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). We also did 
not observe evidence of publication bias among studies report-
ing all strokes (Egger test P value=0.25), MI (P=0.69), cardio-
vascular mortality (P=0.94), and all-cause mortality (P=0.39).
Association Between PPI and Thienopyridines
Table 2 presents an overview on the overall unadjusted and 
adjusted for potential confounders analyses on the association 
of the concomitant administration of PPIs and thienopyridines 
with cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and safety outcomes.
Primary Outcomes
Concomitant use of PPI with thienopyridine was associated with 
increased risk of IS (6 studies; RR, 1.74; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 1.41–2.16; P<0.001; Figure 1) and composite stroke/
MI/CVD (14 studies; RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.29; P=0.04; 
Figure 2A). No evidence of heterogeneity was observed for 
IS (I2=0%, P for Cochran Q statistic=0.46), whereas substan-
tial heterogeneity was evident for composite stroke/MI/CVD 
(I2=75%, P for Cochran Q statistic<0.001). Use of PPI was not 
associated with the risk of stroke (7 studies; RR, 1.12; 95% 
CI, 0.94–1.35; P=0.22) with no evidence of heterogeneity 
(I2=42%, P for Cochran Q statistic=0.11; Figure 3A).
Cardiovascular Outcomes
Use of PPI with thienopyridine was associated with increased 
risk of MI (15 studies; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00–1.40; 
P=0.050), however, considerable heterogeneity (I2=80%, P 
for Cochran Q statistic<0.001; Figure IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement) was observed. Concomitant use of PPI was 
not associated with the risk of CVD (10 studies; RR, 1.04; 
95% CI, 0.93–1.17; P=0.49). No evidence of heterogeneity 
was observed (I2=18%, P for Cochran Q statistic=0.28; Figure 
V in the online-only Data Supplement).
Safety Outcomes
Concomitant use of PPI was not associated with the all-cause 
mortality (10 studies; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.89–1.64; P=0.23)

and substantial (major or minor bleeding, I2=59%, P for 
Cochran Q statistic=0.09; Figure VII in the online-only Data

Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted additional analyses of trials reporting incidence 
of stroke and composite stroke/MI/CVD among patients with 
prior history of acute ischemic stroke. Concomitant use of thi-
enopyridine and PPIs was not associated with increased risk 
of recurrent strokes (2 studies; RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.75–2.05; 
P=0.39; P for Cochran Q statistic=0.52, I2=0%; Figure VIII 
in the online-only Data Supplement) and composite stroke/
MI/CVD among patients with prior history of acute ischemic 
stroke/ transient ischemic attack (2 studies; RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 
0.81–2.19; P=0.26; P for Cochran Q statistic=0.21, I2=37%; 
Figure IX in the online-only Data Supplement).
Adjusted Analyses
After adjusting for potential confounders, the association 
of concomitant use of PPIs and thienopyridines showed 
increased risk of composite stroke/MI/CVD (8 studies; HR, 
1.23; 95% CI, 1.03–1.47; P=0.02; P for Cochran Q statis-
tic<0.001, I2=82%; Figure 2B) and all strokes retained the sta-
tistical significance (4 studies; HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04–1.61; 
P=0.02; P for Cochran Q statistic=0.53, I2=0%; Figure 3B). 
No evidence of increased risk was observed for MI (7 stud-
ies; HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93–1.52; P=0.16; P for Cochran 
Q statistic<0.001, I2=83%; Figure X in the online-only Data 
Supplement), CVD (6 studies; HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82–1.39; 
P=0.64; P for Cochran Q statistic=0.09, I2=47%; Figure XI in 
the online-only Data Supplement), and all-cause mortality (8 
studies; HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.81–1.53; P=0.51; P for Cochran 
Q statistic<0.001, I2=82%; Figure XII in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Subgroup Analyses
To confirm the robustness of our study findings, individual 
subtypes of thienopyridines were assessed for clinical out-
comes. No significant differences were found (P=0.21) on 
the concomitant use of clopidogrel with PPIs (11 studies; 
RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01–1.38) or prasugrel with PPIs (3 stud-
ies; RR, 1.04, 95% CI, 0.93–1.17) with the composite stroke/
MI/CVD (Figure XIII in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Considerable heterogeneity was documented in the subgroup 
of patients receiving clopidogrel (I2=79%, P for Cochran Q

Discussion
In our systematic review and meta-analysis involving 131 714 
patients on thienopyridine treatment with or without PPI, we 
documented that concomitant use of PPI was associated with 
increased risk of IS, composite stroke/MI/CVD, and MI in 
crude analyses. This association persisted for stroke and com-
posite stroke/MI/CVD in adjusted analyses. In addition, the 
subgroup analysis demonstrated increased risk of both cere-
brovascular and cardiovascular outcomes among patients on 
thienopyridines treated with PPIs.
Previous studies have been unable to demonstrate clini-
cal significance with concomitant use of PPI and thienopyri-
dines on adverse cerebrovascular outcomes. Recent analyses 
suggests positive association of PPI and thienopyridine with 
increased stroke risk, however, the association was not con-
sistent in sensitivity analyses.16,36 Leonard et al15 performed 
a propensity score-matched analysis using Medicaid claims 
database and demonstrated no additional increased IS risk

with concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPIs. Similarly, no 
association was observed for stroke recurrence or mortality 
from large case–control study involving stroke patients on 
concomitant clopidogrel and PPI use.17 Our study highlights 
an increased association of concomitant use of PPI and thi-
enopyridines for incident IS, even after adjustment for poten-
tial confounders. Although only 2 studies were included in 
the subgroup analysis to assess for secondary prevention of 
stroke and composite stroke/MI/CVD, our findings corrobo-
rates previously published findings of PPI and thienopyridine 
coadministration on stroke recurrence.17 These considerations 
underscore the need for future RCTs to assess the safety of 
PPIs in patients with IS.
The interaction between PPI and thienopyridines has sev-
eral public health implications. Thienopyridines are similar 
in efficacy to aspirin in preventing serious vascular events, 
including fatal and nonfatal IS.1 However, several patients 
are frequently coprescribed PPIs for stress ulcer prophy-
laxis and prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Over 
decades, PPIs have transformed from benign acid suppres-
sants and have been associated with adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes,37 all-cause mortality,38 and adverse cerebrovas-
cular outcomes including IS.39 To reduce inadvertent PPI 
usage, recent guidelines provide evidence-based recom-
mendations for PPI deprescription, that is, dose reduction 
and stoppage after the minimum intended duration of use.40 
Despite these practice updates, the real-world medicine and 
decision-making continues to ignore the PPI deprescrip-
tion because of scarcity of data and conflicting results. Our 
results underscore the need for pharmacovigilance with 
PPIs and restrict their use to appropriate indications to curb 
the healthcare costs.
Our study has certain limitations. First, the majority of 
included patients comprised of acute coronary syndrome. 
Second, the majority of the studies did not clearly define their 
end points, especially stroke subtype, composite stroke/MI/
CVD and cardiovascular outcomes. We selected studies that 
reported composite of fatal or nonfatal stroke/MI/CVD as 
either primary or secondary end points. Although limiting the 
eligibility criteria could inhere the risk of missing or exclud-
ing data from studies not reporting the aforementioned out-
comes of interest as their primary or secondary end points, 
this decision was made a priori during the meta-analysis pro-
tocol to include only studies succinctly reporting outcomes of 
interest as per protocol predefined end points and not as post 
hoc analyses to avoid the possibility of reporting bias (selec-
tive outcome reporting).41
Third, majority of the included RCTs comprised of post hoc 
analysis with prespecified study protocols, whereas cohort 
studies could have introduced additional biases. However, we 
additionally performed adjusted analyses using correspond-
ing HRs to ascertain any disparities existent between quality 
assessment and analysis presentation. Fourth, potential inher-
ent limitations among included studies were differences in fol-
low-up times, varied study cohorts, use of different PPIs, and 
the lack of data on stroke subtypes; that could have led to the 
observed heterogeneity. Fifth, we acknowledge that many of 
the reported secondary analyses could have been underpow-
ered to detect significant differences among groups, and thus 
these nonsignificant findings do not necessarily signify lack of 
association. Finally, the evaluation of publication bias using 
funnel plot inspection and Egger test was weak because of the 
small number of studies.
In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis 
suggests an increased risk of IS, stroke, composite stroke/MI/
CVD and cardiovascular outcomes with concomitant use of 
PPIs and thienopyridines. Our findings corroborate the cur-
rent guidelines for PPI deprescription, and further underscore 
the need for pharmacovigilance, especially in patients treated 
with thienopyridines.
