Abstract
Background and Aims: Safety and efficacy of budesonide multimatrix, an oral extended-release 
second-generation corticosteroid designed for targeted delivery throughout the colon, were 
examined for induction of remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis refractory 
to baseline mesalamine therapy.
Methods: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial evaluated efficacy 
and safety of budesonide multimatrix for induction of remission [ulcerative colitis disease activity 
index score ≥ 4 and ≤ 10] in 510 adults randomised to once-daily oral budesonide multimatrix 9 mg 
or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients continued baseline treatment with oral mesalamine ≥ 2.4 g/day.
Results: Combined clinical and endoscopic remission at Week 8 was achieved by 13.0% and 7
.5% 
of patients receiving budesonide multimatrix [n = 230] or placebo [n = 228], respectively, in the 
modified intention-to-treat population [p = 0.049]. Clinical remission [ulcerative colitis disease 
activity index rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscale scores of 0] was similar in both groups 
[p = 0.70]. More patients receiving budesonide multimatrix vs placebo achieved endoscopic 
remission [ulcerative colitis disease activity index mucosal appearance subscale score of 0; 20.0% 
vs 12.3%; p = 0.02] and histological healing [27
.0% vs 17
.5%; p = 0.02]. Adverse event rates were 
similar [budesonide multimatrix, 31.8%; placebo, 27
.1%]. Mean morning cortisol concentrations 
decreased at 
Weeks 2, 4, and 8 with budesonide multimatrix but remained within the normal range.
Conclusion: Budesonide multimatrix was safe and efficacious for inducing clinical and endoscopic 
remission for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis refractory to oral mesalamine therapy.

 1. Introduction
Ulcerative colitis [UC] is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that 
affects the colonic mucosa, extending proximally from the rectum.1 
Clinical symptoms of UC include rectal bleeding, diarrhoea, urgency, 
tenesmus, and abdominal pain.1 Current treatment guidelines recom-
mend that patients with active, mild to moderate UC receive either 
rectal mesalamine for more distal forms of UC, or oral mesalamine 
for more extensive forms of the disease.2,3 Systemic corticosteroids 
are usually prescribed after patients fail to respond to mesalamine 
therapy,2,3 but are associated with potentially serious adverse events 
[AEs] including infections, ophthalmological complications, and 
cushingoid features.2 Budesonide is a second-generation corticoster-
oid that undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism due to 
its low systemic bioavailability [~ 10%].4,5 Budesonide multimatrix 
[MMX] extended-release tablets were developed to pass through the 
stomach intact and release active drug throughout the length of the 
colon.6,7
Results of two phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled studies [colonic release budesonide (CORE) I8 and CORE 
II9] of patients with active, mild to moderate UC demonstrated that 
budesonide MMX 9 mg induced combined clinical and endoscopic 
remission in a significantly greater percentage of patients compared 
with placebo [CORE I, 17.9% vs 7.4%, respectively, p = 0.0143; 
CORE II, 17.4% vs 4.5%, respectively, p = 0.005] and had a favour-
able safety profile comparable with placebo. Concomitant use of 
other UC therapies was not permitted in these studies.8,9 Potential 
glucocorticoid-related adverse effects [eg, moon face, fluid reten-
tion, sleep changes] occurred infrequently in both groups, and mean 
morning plasma cortisol concentrations decreased with budesonide 
MMX but remained within normal levels during both studies.
A small phase 2 study consisting of a 4-week randomised, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a 4-week open-label 
extension phase, demonstrated that clinical improvement or remis-
sion was achieved by 47.1% and 33.3% of patients who received 
budesonide MMX 9 mg or placebo, respectively, for treatment of 
UC, despite concomitant oral mesalamine use.10 Budesonide MMX 
9 mg had a favourable safety profile; mean cortisol concentrations 
decreased after 4 weeks with budesonide MMX 9 mg, but remained 
within normal range for the duration of the study.
These findings suggest that budesonide MMX may be included 
in treatment algorithms after mesalamine has failed, but before sys-
temic corticosteroid use.11 The current study evaluated budesonide 
MMX 9 mg administered once daily for 8 weeks for the induction 
of remission of mild to moderate UC not adequately controlled by 
stable, oral mesalamine therapy.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patients
Patients aged 18 to 75 years with active UC [ulcerative colitis dis-
ease activity index [UCDAI] mucosal appearance subscale score ≥ 1] 
by flexible sigmoidoscopy at screening, as well as mild to moderate 
UC [baseline UCDAI score ≥ 4 and ≤ 10, mucosal appearance sub-
score ≥ 1, and physician’s rating of disease activity score of 1 or 2, 
despite receiving oral mesalamine ≥ 2.4 g/day (or equivalent) for ≥ 6 
weeks before randomisation] were included. Previously randomised 
patients without histological evidence of active UC [as determined 
by central histopathological reading] continued the study but were 
not included in the primary efficacy analysis population.
Exclusion criteria included: evidence of limited distal proctitis 
[extending from the anal verge up to 15 cm above the pectineal line]; 
Crohn’s disease or indeterminate colitis; microbiologically confirmed 
infectious colitis or a history of infectious colitis within 30 days of 
screening; history of pancolitis [disease extending to the hepatic flex-
ure or beyond] for ≥ 8 years or left-sided colitis [disease distal to the 
splenic flexure] for ≥ 15 years without surveillance colonoscopy for 
dysplasia/colorectal cancer screening within the past year; or liver 
cirrhosis, hepatic or renal disease or insufficiency, or ≥ 2.5 times the 
upper limit of normal [ULN] for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, or ≥ 2 times ULN for 
creatinine. Patients could not have received previous treatment with: 
budesonide MMX; oral corticosteroids, including other formula-
tions of budesonide, during the previous 4 weeks; any rectal mesa-
lamine or corticosteroid formulation during the previous 2 weeks; 
immunosuppressive agents during the previous 8 weeks; or biologic 
therapies during the previous 3 months. Systemic or rectal steroids, 
any mesalamine other than the existing oral mesalamine at the same 
dose a patient was receiving at study initiation, anti-tumour necrosis 
factor-α agents and other biologics, and immunosuppressants were 
prohibited.
The protocol was approved by institutional review boards and 
ethics committees. All patients provided written informed consent. 
All authors had full access to the study data and reviewed and 
approved the final manuscript.
2.2. Study design
This phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled study [NCT01532648] was conducted in the USA, Canada, 
and Europe between December 2011 and December 2012. Patients 
were randomised 1:1 to receive budesonide MMX 9 mg or pla-
cebo once daily after breakfast for 8 weeks in an outpatient set-
ting. Patients were assigned to treatment groups via an interactive 
voice response system [IVRS] using computer-generated randomi-
sation and stratification by study centre. Patients continued treat-
ment with the same preparation and dosage of oral mesalamine [or 
equivalent] reported at study entry. Minimum required doses were 
≥ 2.4 g/day for mesalamine, ≥ 4.0 g/day for sulphasalazine, ≥ 2.0 g/
day for olsalazine, or ≥ 6.75 g/day for balsalazide. The study con-
sisted of a 2-week screening phase, an 8-week treatment phase, and 
a 4-week posttreatment phase [Supplementary Figure 1, available as 
Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].
2.3. Assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients achiev-
ing combined clinical and endoscopic remission [total UCDAI score, 
according to Sutherland,12 of ≤ 1, with subscale scores of 0 for rec-
tal bleeding, stool frequency, and mucosal appearance] at Week 8. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes included the percentage of patients 
achieving clinical remission [UCDAI subscale scores of 0 for rectal 
bleeding and stool frequency] and the percentage of patients achiev-
ing endoscopic remission [UCDAI subscale score of 0 for mucosal 
appearance] at Week 8. An exploratory endpoint included the per-
centage of patients achieving histological healing [histological activ-
ity grade of 0] at Week 8. For this endpoint, three mucosal biopsies 
were taken from the most severely affected colonic region[s] during 
endoscopy procedures performed at screening and Week 8; biopsies 
were analysed and scored by a blinded, independent histopathologist 
at a central laboratory using the Geboes system.13 Additional explor-
atory endpoints included the percentage of patients with clinical 
improvement [≥ 3-point improvement from baseline in UCDAI score 
and a rectal bleeding score ≤ 1] at Week 8, and serum C-reactive pro-
tein [CRP] and faecal calprotectin concentrations at Week 8. Quality

 of life [QOL] was evaluated at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 using the inflamma-
tory bowel disease quality of life [IBD-QOL] instrument, a 32-item 
questionnaire comprising bowel function, emotional function, sys-
temic symptoms, and social function dimensions, with higher scores 
indicating improved QOL. Safety assessments included AE monitor-
ing, potential predefined glucocorticoid-related adverse effects [ie, 
moon face, striae rubrae, flushing, fluid retention, mood changes, 
sleep changes, insomnia, acne, hirsutism], clinical laboratory tests 
[including morning cortisol concentrations and adrenocortico-
trophic hormone (ACTH) challenge tests], physical examinations, 
and vital sign measurements. A normal response to the ACTH chal-
lenge test was defined as an increase from baseline in plasma cortisol 
concentration > 7 µg/dl, or a plasma cortisol concentration > 18 µg/
dl 30 min post-ACTH challenge.14
2.4. Statistical analyses
The intention-to-treat [ITT] population included all randomised 
patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug and had active UC at 
study entry as a cause of symptoms [based on photographic mucosal 
evidence]; the safety population included all patients who received ≥ 1 
dose of study drug. The modified ITT [mITT] population included all 
patients in the ITT population with histological evidence of active UC 
and no evidence of enteric infection. Based on an assumption of remis-
sion rates of 15% for placebo and 27% for budesonide MMX, a total 
of 250 patients per group would be expected to provide 90% power 
to detect a significant difference between the two groups with a two-
sided α = 0.05. Compliance with budesonide MMX was determined 
by daily self-report of study drug administration through the IVRS, as 
well as by subtracting the amount of drug returned at Weeks 4 and 8 
from the amount of drug dispensed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was 
used for tests of continuous variables, and the chi-square method was 
used for tests of binomial proportions, unless the expected cell fre-
quency was less than five for more than one cell in a two x two table; 
in that case, Fisher’s exact test was used. Missing data for patients 
in the mITT population were handled using a worst-case imputation 
scheme, where patients with missing data were considered nonre-
sponders; clinical improvement, IBD-QOL, and serum CRP data were 
analysed using the last observation carried forward method.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition and demographics
Of the 510 randomised patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug 
[ITT population], 52 were excluded from efficacy analyses due to 
normal histology based on central laboratory reading [n = 51] or 
infectious colitis [n = 1]; the mITT population included 230 and 228 
patients receiving budesonide MMX or placebo, respectively. For the 
mITT population, 85.2% and 93.0% of patients receiving budeso-
nide MMX or placebo, respectively, completed the study [Figure 1]. 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally 
comparable between treatment groups [Table 1]. The majority of 
patients received concomitant treatment with mesalamine at doses 
 
≥ 2.4 g/day but < 4.8 g/day.
3.2. Efficacy
A significantly greater percentage of patients receiving budesonide 
MMX 9 mg achieved combined clinical and endoscopic remis-
sion after 8 weeks [primary efficacy endpoint] compared with pla-
cebo [13% vs 7.5%, respectively; p = 0.049; worst-case analysis; 
Figure 2]. The UCDAI mucosal appearance score was the primary 
driver for this effect, with 20.0% and 12.3% of patients in the bude-
sonide MMX or placebo groups, respectively, achieving a mucosal 
appearance subscore of 0 [p = 0.02].
A comparable percentage of patients receiving budesonide MMX 
9 mg and placebo achieved clinical remission [ie, UCDAI rectal 
bleeding and stool frequency subscale scores of 0; 24.3% vs 22.8%, 
respectively; p = 0.70]. A greater percentage of patients receiv-
ing budesonide MMX 9 mg achieved endoscopic remission com-
pared with placebo after 8 weeks [20.0% vs 12.3%, respectively; 
p = 0.025; Figure 2]. The percentage of patients with a UCDAI rectal 
bleeding subscore of 0 was comparable between groups [budesonide 
MMX, 48.7%, vs placebo, 47.8%]; a similar percentage of patients 
in each group achieved a UCDAI stool frequency score of 0 [bude-
sonide MMX, 34.3%, vs placebo, 31.1%]. Histological healing was 
achieved by a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving 
budesonide MMX 9 mg compared with placebo [27% vs 17.5%, 
respectively; p = 0.016]. No significant differences were noted 
between budesonide MMX [47.0%] and placebo [39.0%; p = 0.09] 
for the exploratory endpoint of percentage of patients with clinical 
improvement at Week 8. Serum CRP concentrations decreased from 
baseline to Week 8 with only placebo, whereas faecal calprotectin 
concentrations decreased from baseline in both groups; for both bio-
markers, the change from baseline was comparable between groups 
[Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-
JCC online]. Total and subscale scores of the IBD-QOL instrument 
were improved from baseline with both budesonide MMX and pla-
cebo by Week 2, and maintained through Week 8 [Supplementary 
Table 2, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].

 3.3. Safety
Budesonide MMX 9 mg was well tolerated when adminis-
tered in combination with oral mesalamine, as the majority of 
AEs [28.7%] with budesonide MMX were mild to moderate in 
intensity. Overall, 31.8% and 27.1% of patients receiving bude-
sonide MMX or placebo, respectively, reported AEs, with the 
most common AE in both groups being UC [Table 2]. Serious 
AEs occurred in a small percentage of patients receiving budeso-
nide MMX [UC (2.4%), pancreatitis (0.4%), bronchitis (0.4%), 
anaemia (0.4%), hypokalaemia (0.4%)] or receiving placebo [UC 
(0.4%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (0.4%)]. Study discontinuation 
due to AEs occurred in 4.7% and 3.5% of patients receiving 
budesonide MMX or placebo, respectively. Potential glucocorti-
coid-related AEs occurred in 9.0% and 5.9% of patients receiving 
budesonide MMX or placebo, respectively, with moon face [3.1% 
vs 2.0%, respectively], sleep changes [2.0% vs 1.6%], fluid reten-
tion [1.6% vs 2.0%], and mood changes [0.4% vs 2.0%] reported 
by at least 2% of patients in either treatment group.
Mean morning plasma cortisol concentrations were within nor-
mal levels in both treatment groups at baseline, Week 2, Week 4, and 
Week 8 [Figure 3; Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary 
data at ECCO-JCC online]. Mean cortisol concentrations after 
ACTH stimulation were comparable at baseline in patients receiving 
budesonide MMX and placebo [22.3 µg/dl and 21.7 µg/dl, respec-
tively]. However, mean cortisol concentrations after ACTH stimu-
lation were below normal with budesonide MMX after 8 weeks 
[15.6 µg/dl]; patients receiving placebo had cortisol concentrations 
comparable with baseline after 8 weeks [22.3 µg/dl]. The majority 
of patients maintained normal total concentrations and had normal 
response to ACTH challenge during the study [Table 3].
4. Discussion
The results of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study demonstrated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once-
daily, oral budesonide MMX 9 mg for the induction of remission of 
patients with mild to moderate UC unresponsive to oral  
mesalamine 
monotherapy. All patients in this study continued treatment with a 
stable dose of oral mesalamine in addition to the study drug, in con-
trast with the CORE I and CORE II studies, which prohibited con-
comitant oral mesalamine.8,9 However, more than 50% of patients 
in the CORE I and CORE II studies reported previous use of mesa-
lamine, with 54.5% of patients in CORE I reporting mesal 
amine 
exposure within 14 days of randomisation.
The percentage of patients receiving budesonide MMX or pla-
cebo who achieved combined clinical and endoscopic remission was 
comparable between this study and the CORE I and CORE II stud-
ies.8,9 The results of the primary endpoint of the current study were 
primarily driven by the UCDAI mucosal appearance score, with a sig-
nificantly greater percentage of patients achieving endoscopic remis-
sion with budesonide MMX after 8 weeks compared with placebo. 
The percentage of patients achieving a stool frequency score of 0 was 
comparable between groups; however, budesonide MMX may not 
have a large effect on this component of the UCDAI, as 20% to 43% 
of patients with active UC may have formed stools.15 Clinical remis-
sion [ie, rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscale scores of 0], 
a subjective secondary outcome measure based on patient-reported 
outcomes, was not statistically significant for budesonide MMX 
compared with placebo. However, the objective secondary endpoints 
of endoscopic remission and histological healing were significant for 
budesonide MMX vs placebo in this study. Histological and endo-
scopic scores have been shown to be positively correlated,16 but it is 
unclear why the percentage of patients with histological healing was 
greater than the percentage of patients with combined clinical and 
endoscopic remission, as many patients with UC in clinical remission

 also have histological evidence of inflammation.16 Rectal bleed-
ing and stool frequency are components of the definition of clini-
cal remission that may not be caused by inflammation, which may 
account for the finding of histological healing in this study. Serum 
CRP concentrations, a biomarker of inflammation, were unchanged 
from baseline with budesonide MMX and decreased with placebo at 
Week 8; it is unclear why decreased serum CRP concentrations were 
only observed in patients receiving placebo, but it may be due to 
poor assay sensitivity.17 The decrease from baseline in faecal calpro-
tectin concentrations was comparable between groups at Week 8. Of 
note, these biomarkers are currently not recommended for assessing 
therapeutic response.17
A limitation of this study was the stringent definition of remis-
sion, which may have limited the number of patients who achieved 
the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. However, more strin-
gent definitions of remission help decrease the incidence of false-
positives in a study.18 Combined clinical and endoscopic remission 
is considered an appropriate therapeutic endpoint in clinical studies 
of UC.19 Clinical remission is an important endpoint for patients, 
as the rectal bleeding and stool frequency components of the Mayo 
score have performed well as indicators of patient perception of 
clinical response to therapy.18 However, although sigmoidoscopy 
and colonoscopy are invasive procedures not viewed favourably by 
most patients,18 mucosal healing, shown by the absence of mucosal 
ulceration and erosions, has been suggested as the ultimate goal of 
treatment in patients with UC.20 Treatment with corticosteroids or 
oral mesalamine has been associated with an increased likelihood 
for mucosal healing within 1 year in patients with UC.21 Histological 
healing has not been historically evaluated as a therapeutic endpoint 
in clinical studies of patients with UC and, when evaluated, has been 
limited by lack of validation and standardisation of how histological 
endpoints are scored, reported, and defined.19,22 Thus, the percent-
age of patients who achieved the primary and secondary efficacy 
outcomes in the current study was most likely limited by the rigor-

published studies of mild to moderate UC may not apply.
This study did not confirm endoscopic scoring using indepen-
dent, central readers, which may have affected endoscopic outcomes. 
Feagan et al.23 previously noted that site readers overestimated 
outcomes only with placebo treatment in a study of mesalamine, 
resulting in greater treatment differences vs active drug; however, 
the statistical significance between treatments remained unchanged. 
Further, use of flexible sigmoidoscopy, rather than colonoscopy, may

 not be as informative in patients with more extensive UC. Another 
limitation of this study was the absence of safety and efficacy 
data beyond 8 weeks. To date, data regarding the safety and effi-
cacy of budesonide MMX for maintenance of remission have not 
been published. Long-term follow-up data regarding duration of 
remission and relief of clinical symptoms in patients who achieved 
clinical and/or endoscopic remission in this study are not available. 
Additional clinical studies are warranted to examine these unan-
swered questions.
The safety profile of budesonide MMX was favourable and 
comparable with that of other studies examining similar doses of 
budesonide MMX in patients with active, mild to moderate UC.8,9 
Thus, concomitant treatment with oral mesalamine had no appar-
ent effect on the incidence of AEs with budesonide MMX, although 
some serious AEs occurred in patients receiving budesonide MMX 
and not in those receiving placebo [ie, pancreatitis, bronchitis, anae-
mia, hypokalaemia: all 0.4% each]. The incidence of potential gluco-
corticoid-related effects was low and comparable with reports from 
previous clinical studies of budesonide MMX.8,9 Importantly, mean 
morning plasma cortisol concentrations remained within normal 
range during the 8-week study. In conclusion, once-daily oral bude-
sonide MMX is a well-tolerated, efficacious therapeutic option for 
induction of combined endoscopic and clinical remission in mild to 
moderate UC, including in patients with UC not adequately con-
trolled with oral mesalamine therapy alone.
