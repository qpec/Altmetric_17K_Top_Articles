Abstract
Aim Previous studies reported conflicting evidence on
the effects of obesity on outcomes after gastrointestinal
surgery. The aims of this study were to explore the rela-
tionship of obesity with major postoperative complica-
tions in an international cohort and to present a meta-
analysis of all available prospective data.
Methods This prospective, multicentre study included
adults
undergoing
both
elective
and
emergency
gastrointestinal resection, reversal of stoma or formation
of stoma. The primary end-point was 30-day major
complications (Clavien–Dindo Grades III–V). A system-
atic search was undertaken for studies assessing the rela-
tionship between obesity and major complications after
gastrointestinal surgery. Individual patient meta-analysis
was used to analyse pooled results.
Results This study included 2519 patients across 127 cen-
tres, of whom 560 (22.2%) were obese. Unadjusted major
complication rates were lower in obese vs normal weight
patients (13.0% vs 16.2%, respectively), but this did not
reach statistical significance (P = 0.863) on multivariate
analysis for patients having surgery for either malignant or
benign
conditions.
Individual
patient
meta-analysis
demonstrated that obese patients undergoing surgery for
malignancy were at increased risk of major complications
(OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.49–2.96, P < 0.001), whereas obese
patients undergoing surgery for benign indications were at
decreased risk (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46–0.75, P < 0.001)
compared to normal weight patients.
Conclusions In our international data, obesity was not
found to be associated with major complications follow-
ing gastrointestinal surgery. Meta-analysis of available
prospective data made a novel finding of obesity being
associated
with
different
outcomes
depending
on
whether patients were undergoing surgery for benign or
malignant disease.

What does this paper add to the literature?
There is conflicting evidence regarding the impact of
obesity after gastrointestinal surgery. Our international
data did not identify obesity as an independent risk fac-
tor for postoperative complications. Individual patient
meta-analysis with previous data identified obesity to be
associated with increased risk in cancer surgery but
decreased risk in benign surgery.
Introduction
Obesity has reached epidemic levels in high income
countries, with its prevalence expected to increase fur-
ther over the coming decades [1]. With one-third of
patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery in the UK
being obese [2], an understanding of the relationship
between obesity and surgical outcomes is needed to
optimize preoperative assessment and perioperative care.
Whilst obesity is a recognized risk factor for cardiovas-
cular and metabolic disease, there is conflicting evidence
on its impact on postoperative complications after gas-
trointestinal surgery [3].
There is wide variation on the impact of obesity after
gastrointestinal surgery in published reports. In some
patient
groups,
no
association
[4,5]
is
identified
between obesity and postoperative complications, whereas
other studies have identified obesity as a risk factor for
increased postoperative complications [6,7]. An ‘obesity
paradox’ has been proposed suggesting that obese patients

 may be at decreased risk of complications in some settings
[8]. Most previous evidence relies on retrospective analy-
ses of registry data, which are limited by a high risk of
bias. Inconsistent and selective outcome reporting are also
key challenges in interpreting these results.
The primary aim of this study was to explore
prospectively
the
relationship
between
obesity
and
major postoperative complications after gastrointestinal
surgery in an international cohort, with a secondary aim
to identify and meta-analyse all available prospective
data regarding the relationship between obesity and
major postoperative complications.
Method
Study design
This was a prospective, multicentre, observational study
delivered by an established network of students and
trainees [9]. A systematic search for previous evidence,
followed by individual patient meta-analysis of pooled
data, was also performed. The results are reported with
consideration to the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) and
Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) statements [10,11].
EuroSurg Collaborative
The EuroSurg Collaborative is a medical-student- and
surgical-trainee-led research network. The collaborative
was established in September 2015 at the tenth meeting
of the European Society of Coloproctology, by dele-
gates representing six European countries [9]. Inspired
by the medical student collaborative model developed
by the Student Audit and Research in Surgery (STAR-
Surg) network in the UK [12], the group sought to
engage students and trainees across Europe in multicen-
tre surgical research.
Protocol development and dissemination
The pre-specified protocol for this prospective, multi-
centre observational study was developed based on the
STARSurg DISCOVER protocol [13]. Medical students
and surgical trainees were invited to work together in
their local surgical units, under supervision from a
senior surgeon, to collect data over a maximum of three
predefined 14-day data collection periods in February–
May 2016. Any hospital offering emergency or elective
gastrointestinal resection in the Czech Republic, Repub-
lic of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and
the UK was eligible.
Ethics and study approval
Across the seven participating countries, local collabora-
tors and their supervisors registered the study according
to national and institutional regulations. In some coun-
tries, this required formal research ethics approval with
written patient consent. In the UK, this observational
study was registered as a re-audit of DISCOVER [2].
At all centres, approval was gained to collect anon-
ymized patient data using a secure online Research
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system [14].
Inclusion criteria
Adult patients aged 18 years or older undergoing gas-
trointestinal resection, reversal of ileostomy or colost-
omy, or creation of a stoma as a primary procedure
were included. Both elective and emergency procedures
using
open,
laparoscopic
or
robotic
operative
approaches were eligible. Patients undergoing appen-
dicectomy alone were excluded. As the primary aim was
to assess the effect of being overweight or obese, under-
weight patients [body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/
m2] were excluded.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the 30-day major
adverse event rate, defined as Clavien–Dindo Grade III–
V complications [15]. These include the need for
unplanned surgical, endoscopic or radiological proce-
dures under local or general anaesthetic (Grade III), the
need for organ support in an intensive care setting or
stroke (Grade IV) and death (Grade V). The secondary
outcome was 30-day mortality.
Explanatory variables
The main explanatory variable was preoperative BMI,
calculated as weight divided by the square of height.
Patients were stratified by BMI into three groups: nor-
mal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI
25.0–29.9 kg/m2)
and
obese
(BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2).
Preoperative variables were collected to risk adjust clini-
cal outcomes. These included demographic parameters
such as age and sex as well as American Society of Anes-
thesiologists (ASA) and Revised Cardiac Risk Index
scores [16].
Data validation
A selection of participating hospitals identified indepen-
dent data validators who had not been involved in the

 original data collection. These validators assessed their
site’s case ascertainment by independent review of the-
atre logbooks and operating lists. The case ascertain-
ment rate was the proportion of all eligible patients
who had been included in the original data collection.
Validators also reviewed the data submitted from their
site to determine data accuracy. This was based on vali-
dation of the primary outcome (30-day major adverse
events) and 11 other predefined data fields (age; gen-
der; ASA grade; history of ischaemic heart disease, con-
gestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, insulin
dependent diabetes or chronic kidney disease; urgency
of operation; pathology; operation performed). The
data accuracy rate was the proportion of validated data
fields that had been correctly completed by the original
data collection team.
Systematic review
A
systematic
search
of
bibliographical
databases
(PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) was undertaken
on 30 September 2017 by two independent reviewers
to identify previous studies investigating the relationship
between BMI and major postoperative complications
after gastrointestinal surgery (Table S1). Eligible studies
involved adult patients undergoing oesophagogastric,
colorectal or liver surgery using any surgical approach.
Case–control studies, cohort studies and randomized
controlled trials whose primary aim was to compare
outcomes between normal weight vs overweight and
obese patients using the standardized Clavien–Dindo
classification for complications were included. Study
abstracts were initially screened for suitability followed
by inspection of full text papers. Additional studies, not
included in the database search, were identified by
searching the reference lists of retained articles.
Statistical analysis
Simple summary statistics were used to summarize char-
acteristics and outcomes across BMI categories, with
categorical variables expressed as percentages and con-
tinuous variables as mean averages alongside the corre-
sponding standard deviation (SD). Differences between
categorical demographic groups were tested using the
Kruskal–Wallis test, Welch’s t test was used for continu-
ous data, and the chi-squared test for proportions.
Two-sided
statistical
significance
was
defined
as
P < 0.05 a priori. To account for centre level variation,
multilevel models were constructed using clinically plau-
sible explanatory variables [11], with patient level fac-
tors considered as a level 1 fixed effects and hospital as
a level 2 random effect. First order interactions were
explored
within
the
model,
including
interactions
between indication (malignant or benign) and BMI
which have been previously described [2]. Effect esti-
mates are presented as odds ratios with 95% confi-
dence intervals and P values to indicate statistical
significance.
To assess the results of this study in relation to previ-
ous work, meta-analysis was pre-planned for all prospec-
tive studies identified in the systematic review; an
individual patient level meta-analysis was performed.
Only the DISCOVER study met the criteria to be
included in the meta-analysis. Individual data from the
DISCOVER study for patients matching the EuroSurg
study’s inclusion criteria were pooled with the EuroSurg
dataset. Briefly, a mixed-effects model was fitted with
patient level explanatory variables as level 1 fixed effects,
hospital as level 2 random effects and study as a level 3
random effect. Models were fitted and interactions
checked as above. All statistical analyses were performed
using R 3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).
Results
Data were collected across 35 hospitals in the Nether-
lands, 30 hospitals in Spain, 23 hospitals in Italy, 20
hospitals in Turkey, 14 hospitals in the UK, four hospi-
tals in the Republic of Ireland and one hospital in the
Czech
Republic.
Following
exclusion
of
ineligible
patients, a total of 2519 patients were included in the
analysis (Fig. 1).
Data validation
Independent data validation was performed in 74 cen-
tres across six countries. The case ascertainment rate
was 96.6% (1508/1561). Amongst the 17 052 data
fields that were validated, the overall data accuracy rate
was 99.2%.
Demographics
Overall, 41.4% (1044/2519) patients had a normal
BMI, 36.3% (915/2519) were overweight and 22.2%
(560/2519) were obese. In the six countries that
entered more than 50 patients into the study, rates of
obesity varied from 17.7% to 30.9% (Table 1). Overall,
overweight and obese patients were older than normal
weight patients (Table 2). Overweight patients were
more likely to be men, whereas obese patients were
more likely to have Grade III–V ASA. There was no dif-
ference between the groups in the Revised Cardiac Risk
Index scores. Malignancy was most commonly the

patients underwent surgery for inflammatory bowel dis-
ease. Whilst there was no difference between groups in
the proportion of procedures completed on an emer-
gency basis, overweight patients were more likely to
undergo open surgery than either normal weight or
obese patients. Overweight and obese patients more fre-
quently underwent gastrointestinal resection than nor-
mal weight patients (Table 3).
Postoperative major complications
The overall unadjusted 30-day major complication rate
was 14.5% (365/2519). This varied from 13.0% (73/
560) for obese patients to 16.2% (169/1044) for nor-
mal weight patients (Table 4). Overall unadjusted 30-
day mortality was 2.4%. Univariate analysis (Table 5)
identified that overweight (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–
1.03, P = 0.089) and obese (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57–

were

modelling found that amongst patients undergoing sur-
gery for malignancy neither overweight (OR 0.73, 95%
CI 0.43–1.25, P = 0.257) nor obese (OR 1.06, 95% CI
0.56–1.99, P = 0.863) patients were at increased risk of
serious complications.

BMI and surgical complications
EuroSurg Collaborative
 Systematic review
A total of six studies [2,17–21] were identified in the
systematic review that presented primary data compar-
ing major postoperative complications between healthy
weight vs overweight and obese patients following gas-
trointestinal surgery (Fig. 2). Five studies were retro-
spective, single centre studies that only included elective
patients, leaving one prospective multicentre study, the
DISCOVER
study
(Table 6).
Of
the
four
studies
reporting outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for
malignancy
(Table 7),
only
the
DISCOVER
study
found obesity to be an independent risk factor on mul-
tivariate analysis for major complications [2], with the
other three studies finding no association [19–21].
Only the DISCOVER study reported outcomes in the
sub-group of patients undergoing surgery for benign
indications, finding no relationship between obesity and
major
complications.
Two
studies
did
not
stratify
patient outcomes according to whether the indication
for surgery was benign or malignant; one found obesity
to be independently associated with major complica-
tions [17], whilst the other study found no such associ-
ation [18].
Individual patient data meta-analysis

 predictors for increased major postoperative complica-
tions included male gender, ASA Grades III–V and
emergency timing of surgery. In the overall dataset,
being
overweight
(OR
0.81,
95%
CI
0.64–1.02,
P = 0.070) was not associated with any change to risk of
major postoperative complications compared to normal
weight patients, whereas being obese (OR 0.59, 95% CI
0.46–0.75, P < 0.001) was overall associated with a
reduced likelihood of complications. Amongst patients
undergoing surgery for malignancy, being overweight
(OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.95–1.79, P = 0.102) was not asso-
ciated with a higher risk of major postoperative complica-
tions, but obese patients were at increased risk (OR
2.10,
95%
CI
1.49–2.96,

Overweight
patients undergoing surgery for benign indications had
no change in their risk of major complications (OR 0.81,
95% CI 0.64–1.02, P = 0.070), whereas obese patients
were at decreased risk of complications compared to nor-
mal weight patients (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46–0.75,

BMI and surgical complications
 stages visceral fat surrounding diseased non-malignant
bowel, such as in Crohn’s disease patients, has been
shown to contain localized inflammation [23–25]. These
complex relationships between obesity and inflammation
may explain the different associations in patients under-
going cancer surgery and those having surgery for
benign conditions. Distinct preoperative patient pathways
for benign and malignant disease may also contribute to
these differences. For example, cancer patients’ risk of
complications may be increased by neoadjuvant chemora-
diotherapy, whereas inflammatory bowel disease patients
may be at higher risk if immunosuppressant drugs have
been administered in the preoperative and perioperative
periods. Although the exclusion of these factors from
our models may be a limitation, this ensured we followed
a predefined statistical plan based on the model previ-
ously developed in the DISCOVER study.
Of the studies identified in our systematic review,
five focused on well-defined groups of elective patients
[17–21], limiting their generalizability. Only the DIS-
COVER study reported prospective data, finding in a

BMI and surgical complications
 complications whereas obese patients undergoing sur-
gery for benign indications are at decreased risk com-
pared to normal weight patients.
The differential relationships identified in patients
with malignancy and benign disease may also be partly
related to selection biases. Surgery in high risk patients
with benign conditions may be delayed or avoided alto-
gether, whereas most cancer patients require timely sur-
gical intervention, regardless of comorbid status. Whilst
preoperative weight loss and pre-habilitation might offer
a means of improving obese patients’ outcomes, imple-
mentation of these programmes is complicated by the
strict targets set by some health services for commenc-
ing definitive cancer treatment.
A limitation of this study was the reliance on the
snapshot of BMI taken at the time of surgery, with no
data collected on preoperative weight loss for example.
Unintentional preoperative weight loss is associated
with increased cardiac complications, ventilator depen-
dency and mortality [26]. Inclusion of preoperative
weight loss may have enhanced our models, but it was
not feasible to collect these data within the constraints
of this observational, student-driven study. Further-
more, whilst BMI is in routine clinical use because it is
based on readily available non-invasive measurements,
a meta-analysis of 32 000 patients across 32 studies
found a pooled sensitivity of 0.42 for the commonly
applied BMI cut-off of ≥ 30 kg/m2 for obesity [27],
suggesting that BMI might fail to identify more than
half of patients with high body fat. Moreover, an
inverse relation has been observed between BMI per-
formance and age, with BMI being less reliable in
older individuals [28], who may exhibit ‘sarcopenic
obesity’ whereby lean mass is lost, with increased
inter/intramuscular fat [29]. A further limitation of
BMI is that it does not account for the relative distri-
bution of visceral and subcutaneous fat. Although
some studies have identified that only patients with
high visceral fat are at significantly increased risk of
complications, there is conflicting evidence regarding
the significance of the visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio
[30,31].
In the UK, the STARSurg model of student-driven
research increases students’ understanding and confi-
dence in clinical research [12], but in many countries
research opportunities for medical students are limited
[32]. The EuroSurg Collaborative was founded with
the aim of engaging students across Europe in high
quality research [9]; it has already catalysed the founda-
tion by Italian
trainees of an independent trainee
research network in Italy [33]. The next EuroSurg
study [34] will stimulate the development of further
research networks across Europe.
Conclusion
Although in our international cohort study there was
no association between obesity and postoperative com-
plications following gastrointestinal surgery, we made a
novel finding of obesity being associated with different
outcomes
depending
on
underlying
pathology.
In
patients undergoing cancer surgery obesity was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of major complications,
whereas in patients undergoing surgery for benign indi-
cations it was associated with decreased risk. Further
research
is
required
to
understand
the
underlying
pathophysiology of this effect, in order to inform
improved management and preoperative optimization of
patients undergoing surgery.
