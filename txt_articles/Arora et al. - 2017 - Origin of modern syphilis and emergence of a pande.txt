The abrupt onslaught of the syphilis pandemic that started in
the late fifteenth century established this devastating infec-
tious disease as one of the most feared in human history1.
Surprisingly, despite the availability of effective antibiotic
treatment since the mid-twentieth century, this bacterial infec-
tion, which is caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum
(TPA), has been re-emerging globally in the last few decades
with an estimated 10.6 million cases in 2008 (ref. 2).
Although resistance to penicillin has not yet been identified,
an increasing number of strains fail to respond to the second-
line antibiotic azithromycin3. Little is known about the genetic
patterns in current infections or the evolutionary origins of
the disease due to the low quantities of treponemal DNA in
clinical samples and difficulties in cultivating the pathogen4.
Here, we used DNA capture and whole-genome sequencing to
successfully interrogate genome-wide variation from syphilis
patient specimens, combined with laboratory samples of TPA
and two other subspecies. Phylogenetic comparisons based
on the sequenced genomes indicate that the TPA strains exam-
ined share a common ancestor after the fifteenth century,
within the early modern era. Moreover, most contemporary
strains are azithromycin-resistant and are members of a glob-
ally dominant cluster, named here as SS14-Ω. The cluster diver-
sified from a common ancestor in the mid-twentieth century
subsequent to the discovery of antibiotics. Its recent phyloge-
netic divergence and global presence point to the emergence
of a pandemic strain cluster.
The first reported syphilis outbreaks in Europe occurred during
the War of Naples in 1495 (ref. 5), prompting unresolved theories
on a post-Columbian introduction6,7. Subsequently, the epidemic
spread to other continents, remaining a severe health burden until
treatment with penicillin five centuries later enabled incidence
reduction. The striking present-day resurgence is poorly under-
stood, particularly the underlying patterns of genetic diversity.
Much of our molecular understanding of treponemes comes from
the propagation of strains in laboratory animals to obtain sufficient
DNA. The few published whole genomes were obtained after ampli-
fication through rabbit passage4,8–10 and represent limited diversity
for phylogenetic analyses. These sequences suggest that the TPA
genome of 1.14 Mb is genetically monomorphic. Its potential
genetic diversity remains unexplored because clinical samples are
mostly typed by PCR amplification of only 1–5 loci11,12. These epi-
demiological strain typing studies are motivated by the limitations
of serological or microscopic tests to distinguish among TPA
strains or among the subspecies Treponema pallidum subsp.
pertenue (TPE) and Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN),
which cause the diseases yaws and bejel, respectively. All three diseases
are transmitted through skin contact and show an overlap in their
clinical manifestations, but syphilis is geographically more widespread
and generally transmitted sexually. The precise relationships among
the bacteria are still debated, particularly regarding the evolutionary
origin of syphilis.
The paucity of molecular studies and the focus on typing of a few
genes means that we have limited information regarding the

 evolution and spread of epidemic TPA. In this study, we interro-
gated genome-wide variation across geographically widespread iso-
lates. In total, we obtained 70 samples from 13 countries, including
52 syphilis swabs collected directly from patients between 2012 and
2013, and 18 syphilis, yaws and bejel samples collected from 1912
onwards and propagated in laboratory rabbits (Supplementary
Table 1). Through comparative genome analyses and phylogenetic
reconstruction, we shed light on the evolutionary history of TPA
and identify epidemiologically relevant haplotypes.
Due to the large background of host DNA, samples were
enriched for treponemal DNA prior to Illumina sequencing13,14.
The resultant reads were mapped to the Nichols TPA reference
genome
(RefSeq
NC_021490;
Supplementary
Table
3)4,15.
Genomic coverage ranged from 0.13-fold to over 1,000-fold. As
expected, the highest mean coverage was found in strains propa-
gated in rabbits, while high variation in mean coverage was observed
in samples collected directly from patients (0.13-fold to 223-fold)
(Supplementary Table 2). This heterogeneity could potentially
affect our inferences. We therefore restricted the genome-wide ana-
lyses to the 28 samples where at least 80% of the genome was
covered
by
a
minimum
of
three
reads
(highlighted
in
Supplementary Table 2). Across the 28 samples, the average pro-
portions of genome coverage with at least 3-fold or 10-fold depth
were 97% and 82%, respectively (Supplementary Table 4).
De novo assemblies for the four highest covered syphilis swab
samples (NE17, NE20, CZ27 and AU15) and one Indonesian yaws
isolate (IND1) show no significant structural changes in the five
genomes (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 5), except for the deletion
in IND1 of gene TP1030, which potentially encodes a virulence-
factor16. The deletion was shared across all the yaws infection isolates
(Supplementary Methods), consistent with other studies17.
Before phylogenetic reconstruction we checked for signatures of
recombination. T. pallidum is considered to be a clonal species18, but
previous studies suggest recombinant genes in a Mexican syphilis
and a Bosnian bejel strain10,19. We screened for putative recombi-
nants across the 978 annotated genes in our 28 sequenced
genomes and the 11 publicly available genomes from laboratory
strains (Supplementary Table 3). Genes were selected as candidates
if they had unexpectedly high single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) densities, incongruent topologies with the genome-wide
tree and more than four homoplasies in a pair of branches
(Supplementary Methods). We identified four genes coding for
outer membrane proteins (Supplementary Table 6), one of which
(TP0136) is used in typing studies8.
After excluding the four putative recombinant genes, the genome
alignment for all 39 genomes contained 2,235 variable positions. We
used the Bayesian framework implemented in BEAST20 to recon-
struct a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1b). The tree topology revealed a
marked separation between TPA and TPE/TEN (100% Bayesian
posterior support), with TPA forming a monophyletic lineage.
The distinction of the two lineages was robust, even with the
inclusion of putative recombinant genes (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Analyses of divergence between the two lineages yielded an
average mean distance of 1,225 nucleotide differences. By contrast,
within each of the lineages we found considerably less diversity
(124.6 average pairwise mutations within the TPA lineage and
200.2 within TPE/TEN). A heat map (Supplementary Fig. 3) to
show shared variation for pairs of samples with respect to the
Nichols reference genome confirms the divergence between the
lineages. The underlying SNP matrix yielded 443 SNPs specific to
TPA genomes and 1,703 to TPE/TEN genomes. Previous studies
have found cross-subspecies groupings when relying on a limited
set of markers21. Our results, incorporating genome-wide data
from clinical samples, not only establish a clear separation
between the two lineages, in agreement with studies examining
genomic data from rabbit propagated samples10,17, but also illustrate
the need for a careful choice of taxonomic markers when genome-
wide data are not available.
Using the sample isolation dates as tip calibration and applying
the Birth Death Serial Skyline model22, we obtained a mean evol-
utionary rate of 3.6 × 10−4 (rate variance 3.8 × 10−8; 95% highest
posterior density (HPD) of 1.86 × 10−4 to 5.73 × 10−4). This estimate
is equivalent to a scaled mean rate of 6.6 × 10−7 substitutions per
site per year for the whole genome, in line with estimates for
other clonal human pathogens such as Shigella sonnei (6.0 × 10−7)
and Vibrio cholerae (O1 lineage; 8.0 × 10−7)23,24. Our divergence
analyses for TPA samples provide a time to the most recent
common ancestor (TMRCA) of less than 500 years ago (mean
calendar year 1744, 95% HPD 1611–1859; Fig. 1b).
Within the TPA lineage the samples group in two clades named
after the SS14 and Nichols reference genomes (with 100% and 82%
posterior probability values, respectively). The Nichols clade consists
almost exclusively of samples collected from patients in North America
from 1912 to 1986 and passaged in rabbits before sequencing, with
the exception of one patient sample from 2013 (NE20). In contrast,
the SS14 clade has a geographically widespread distribution, encom-
passing European, North American and South American samples
collected from infections between 1951 and 2013. We investigated
the TPA clades further by generating a median-joining (MJ) network
to illustrate the mutational differences among the TPA samples
(Fig. 2a). As underscored by distances in the network, greater nucleo-
tide diversity is found within the Nichols clade (π = 0.05) than in
the SS14 clade (π = 0.01). Three closely related sequences derive
from the original Nichols sample isolated from the cerebrospinal
fluid of a patient in 1912 and propagated in laboratories in sub-
sequent decades: NIC_REF, the reference genome re-sequenced by
Pětrošová et al.15, and NIC-1 and NIC-2, which we sequenced follow-
ing independent propagation of the strains in Houston and Seattle,
respectively, during different time periods (Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Table 3). These three group together with
another three laboratory-propagated strains in a cluster labelled
Nichols-α (Fig. 2a), with a TMRCA in the mid-twentieth century
(Fig. 1a). The less diversified SS14 clade contains a dominant
central haplotype (labelled SS14-Ω) from which the other sequences
radiate (Fig. 2a). Critically, the cluster associated with the SS14-Ω
haplotype contains all but one of the recent patient samples from
2012 to 2013 (n = 17) that were captured and sequenced directly, in
addition to samples from 1977 (n = 1) and 2004 (n = 2). The
genetic variation within the SS14-Ω cluster is found primarily as sin-
gleton mutations (95.5%), with no evidence here for geographical
structuring. Bayesian analyses estimate coalescence for the SS14-Ω
cluster in 1964 (mean calendar year; 95% HPD 1950–1975;
Fig. 1b), at a time when incidence was reduced due to the introduc-
tion of antibiotics. The star-like topology of this cluster observed in
both the tree and the network is suggestive of a recent and rapid
clonal expansion.
To determine whether the dominance of SS14 clade sequences
applies across other countries for which genetic data are available,
we examined sequences from the widely typed TP0548 gene in
worldwide epidemiological studies11. Phylogenies for the TP0548
typing regions separate the SS14 from the Nichols clade for the
TPA samples, but do not distinguish the TPA and TPE/TEN
lineages (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Across 1,354 worldwide TP0548 sequences from clinical samples,
including the 78 from patients in this study, we found that 94% of
them grouped in the SS14 clade (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9
and Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with a probable recent
spread of the epidemic cluster. The wide geographical distribution
of the SS14 clade establishes it as representative of the present
worldwide epidemic. Studies so far have focused on the Nichols
strain25,26, but our results indicate that further work on the SS14
clade is warranted.

 Critically, typing of samples over multiple years in the
Czech Republic, San Francisco, British Columbia and Seattle
indicate that macrolide antibiotic resistance has increased over
time3,12,27–29. We queried the presence of the two mutations
(A2058G and A2059G) in the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes
associated with azithromycin resistance3,30,31. As observed in the
MJ network, the resistance marker is a dominant characteristic of
the SS14-Ω cluster (Fig. 2a), although it is also found in a recent
patient sample (NE20) of the Nichols clade. Extending our analyses
of the 23S rRNA gene to all sequenced samples from our study,
including the 42 with lower coverage, revealed the mutations in
90% of the SS14 (n = 51) and 25% of the Nichols (n = 12)
samples, indicating that neither resistance nor sensitivity is clade-
specific (Supplementary Table 8). A likely scenario is that the
extensive usage of azithromycin to treat syphilis and a wide range
of bacterial infections, including co-infections with other sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, has played an important
role in the selection and subsequent spread of resistance32,33.
The results here represent the first reported set of whole-genome
sequences successfully obtained directly from syphilis patients,
enabling us to disentangle evolutionary relationships at high resol-
ution and paving the way for further clinical sequencing from
current epidemics. Given our identification of putative recombinant
genes in Treponema and previous reports on genes involved in
homologous recombination4,34, further detailed analyses on the
potential mechanisms of recombination will be necessary. Our
phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that all TPA samples examined
to date share a common ancestor that was infecting populations in
the 1700s, within the early centuries of the modern era, and that
was successful in leaving descendants until today. This date is post-
erior to the colonization of the Americas and therefore potentially
compatible with the post-Columbian model for the emergence of
syphilis in Europe. Nonetheless, our work does not exclude the
possibility that older TPA lineages had previously existed in
Europe but went extinct. Obtaining more patient sample genomes
with high coverage could refine our detection of putative recombi-
nants and our phylogenetic inferences. In addition, sequencing
from ancient skeletal material would help to further ascertain the
history of syphilis. Interestingly, we observed a time difference
between the first reported syphilis outbreak in 1495 and the last
common ancestor of modern strains dated to the 1700s. Although
this difference could stem from imprecision in the divergence
estimates, an alternative scenario is the eventual establishment of a
specific lineage due to selection. For instance, it has been hypothesized
that the symptoms of syphilis became less severe after the first reported
outbreaks in Europe because of the evolution of strains with lower viru-
lence and higher transmission rates35. In this scenario, the eighteenth
century provided the context for the origin and propagation of a
lineage that successfully outcompeted other lineages.
Critical to our epidemiological understanding of contemporary
syphilis is our observation of an epidemic cluster (SS14-Ω) that
emerged after the discovery of antibiotics. The relatively recent
phylogenetic divergence of the SS14-Ω cluster and its global pres-
ence point to the emergence of a pandemic azithromycin-resistant
cluster. The genome-wide data in this study will be useful to deter-
mine a suitable set of typing loci, because typing remains a more
accessible method for most laboratories. Further characterization
of the genomic diversity of TPA across the globe can prove

Methods
Sample collection, DNA extraction and library preparation. Samples from 64
syphilis infections, 5 yaws infections and 1 bejel infection were collected from
numerous countries across the globe (Supplementary Table 1). Syphilis infection
samples were classified as either clinical if obtained from patients directly, or as
laboratory strains if passaged in rabbits after isolation from patients. Clinical samples
were obtained after swabbing lesions from patients at sexual health clinics,
dermatological clinics or hospitals. Flocked swabs (from Copan Diagnostics) or
nylon swabs were used according to local laboratory instructions. Laboratory strains
were obtained as DNA extracts from Masaryk University (Brno, Czech Republic)
and the University of Washington (Seattle, USA). DNA extractions were carried out
in the participating laboratories using in-house protocols. At the University of
Zurich the QIAmp DNA mini kit and QIAmp DNA blood min kit (Qiagen) were
used following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Library preparation was conducted following a modified Illumina protocol for
ancient DNA14,36, at the University of Tübingen (Supplementary Methods).
Libraries were barcoded with double indices.
Genome-wide enrichment and sequencing. Target enrichment for Treponema pallidum
subsp. pallidum was carried out through two rounds of capture hybridization on a
1 million Agilent SureSelect array following the protocol detailed by Hodges and
co-authors13. The probes on the array were based on two reference genomes
(Nichols, here abbreviated as NIC_REF, GenBank ID CP004010.2/RefSeq ID
NC_021490.2 and SS14, GenBank ID CP000805.1/RefSeq ID NC_010741.1).
High-throughput sequencing of the enriched libraries was performed on an
Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform.
Sequencing analyses and genome reconstruction. We applied EAGER37, our own
developed pipeline for read preprocessing (adapter clipping, merging of
corresponding paired-end reads in the overlapping regions and quality trimming),
mapping, variant identification and genome reconstruction, to all sequenced
samples (for full details see Supplementary Methods). All reads (merged and
unmerged) were treated as single-end reads and mapping was performed using the
BWA-MEM algorithm38 with default parameters, using the Nichols genome as
reference. Subsequently, we selected the samples that had at least 80% coverage of the
Nichols genome and a minimum of three reads (n = 28 samples, Supplementary
Table 2). For each of these samples, we used the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)39
to generate a mapping assembly, applying the UnifiedGenotyper module of GATK
to call reference bases and variants from the mapping. The reference base was called
if the position was covered by at least three reads, the Phred-scaled genotype quality
score of the call was at least 30, and at least 90% of the reads agreed with the
reference. A variant position (SNP) was called if the position was covered by at least
three reads, the genotype quality of the call was at least 30, and the minimum SNP
allele frequency was 90% (detailed in the Supplementary Methods). If neither of the
requirements for a reference base call nor the requirements for a variant call were
met, the character ‘N’ was inserted at the respective position. For the generation of
draft genome sequences we used an in-house tool (VCF2Genome), which reads a
VCF file such as that produced by the GATK UnifiedGenotyper and incorporates—
for each row and thus for each call—one nucleotide into the new draft sequence.
To apply our analysis pipeline also to those samples for which complete genomic
sequences are available in GenBank (Supplementary Table 3), we produced artificial
reads in these cases using an in-house tool (Genome2Reads) and then applied the
same mapping, SNP calling and genome reconstruction procedure as for the
sequenced samples to obtain consistent and comparable results.
To investigate conservation of structure and gene order in the genomes, in
addition to the mapping assembly we also performed a de novo assembly for the five
samples with highest coverage (Supplementary Table 5). Our de novo assembly
pipeline started with the merged reads, and in a first step used the short read
assembler software SOAPdenovo2 using ten different k-mer sizes (k = 37 + 10i,
where i = {0,…,9}). Different k-mer sizes were used because merging of read pairs
into one single read results in very different lengths (between 30 and 190 bases).
Next, all input reads were mapped back against the resulting contigs using

 BWA-MEM (ref. 38). Contigs that were not supported by any reads (no read mapped
against these contigs) were removed. To assemble the contigs resulting from the
different k-mers, the remaining contigs were subject to the overlap-based String
Graph Assembler (SGA)40. Finally, contigs smaller than 1,000 bp were removed
before these contigs were mapped against the Nichols reference genome for
comparison of genome architectures.
Analyses to detect recombinants and reconstruct evolutionary relationships
using genome-wide variation were conducted for the 28 sequenced samples meeting
our genome-wide coverage criteria (highlighted in Supplementary Table 2) as well as
the 11 published genomes (Supplementary Table 3). Across the 39 whole genomes
and draft genomes, 31 were TPA, 8 TPE and 1 TEN.
Recombination detection. Tests for the non-vertical transmission of genes were
carried out on the TPA, TPE and TEN genomes (n = 39) by identifying those genes
that (1) had an unexpectedly high number of SNPs and (2) displayed patterns of
transmission (that is, phylogenies) incongruent with most other genes. First, an
expected substitution rate was computed by dividing the total number of observed
SNPs in the 978 annotated genes (n = 2,098) by the total length of these genes
(1,046,421 bp). This rate was then used to calculate the expected number of
polymorphisms per gene according to its length. A total of 87 genes displayed at least
twice the expected number of polymorphisms. Second, for each of these 87 genes the
gene sequence alignment and the gene tree topology were tested against the
maximum likelihood tree topology of the draft genome in TREE-PUZZLE v5.2
(refs 41,42). Genes for which both the expected likelihood weight43 and the
Shimodaira–Hasegawa44 test rejected the genome tree (P < 0.05) were examined
more closely. Third, genes within which we identified a minimum of five
homoplasies (identical mutations in separate lineages) in at least two branches of
the tree were marked as putative recombinants (Supplementary Table 6).
Genome-wide variation and phylogenetic analyses. We investigated genome-wide
patterns of polymorphism and divergence using MEGA 6.0 (ref. 45) and DnaSP v.5.10
(ref. 46) to compute various measures of diversity including the average pairwise
nucleotide differences, Nei’s pi (π) and the number of singletons in each group.
We also estimated the number of SNPs private to particular groups. A comparison of
the TPA and TPE/TEN genomes revealed between 1 (NIC1) and 339 (AR2) SNPs
observed in the TPA samples and between 1,091 (GHA1) and 1,443 (Bosnia A)
SNPs in the TPE/TEN strains (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, we produced a
heat map to display the number of SNPs (with respect to the Nichols reference
genome) that any two genomes share (Supplementary Fig. 3).
The molecular clock hypothesis was tested with maximum likelihood analysis in
MEGA 6.0 (ref. 45). Tests were conducted for all TPA, TPE and TEN genomes
(39 samples) using (1) multiple whole genome alignments and (2) alignments with
only the variable positions, in both cases excluding the four putative recombinant
genes. The molecular clock hypothesis was rejected at the 5% significance level.
Bayesian phylogenetic trees were produced in BEAST 2.3 (ref. 20) for the
28 sequenced samples and the 11 published samples. We compared the trees
generated with the alignment of all variable positions in the TPA, TPE and TEN
genomes (2,506 positions) and the tree generated with the set of variable
positions after excluding the four putative recombinant genes (2,235 positions).
Additionally, rooted trees were generated with maximum parsimony by including
Treponema paraluiscuniculi (NC_015714) as the outgroup.
As a calibration for the BEAST (Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees)
trees we used tip dates, that is, the isolation years of all samples. When not known
with precision, we provided a range (for NIC_REF, NIC1, NIC2, and GAU). The two
demographic models (coalescent tree prior under Constant Size and the Birth-Death
Serial Skyline model (BDSS)) resulted in consistent parameter estimates. The relaxed
clock model was chosen over the strict clock model based on marginal likelihood
estimates obtained with PathSampler20,47. We report estimates for the five combined
BDSS model runs, each with the following specifications: uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed clock model, generalized time reversible plus gamma substitution model,
and 100 million generations with parameter sampling every 10,000 generations.
We used Tracer 1.6 (ref. 48) to assess convergence and suitable burn-in periods (see
Supplementary Methods for full details). The annotated maximum clade credibility
tree was visualized and edited using Figtree v1.4.2 (ref. 49). Because TPA samples are
the focus of this study and therefore more extensively sampled, we report mean branch
rate and divergence estimates for the TPA lineage. The mean branch rate estimate
obtained is in line with the number of mutations that differed between the samples
NIC_REF and NIC 2 (n = 15), which were isolated 15–20 years apart following
continuous rabbit propagation. We also checked that a run with the same specifications
but with only TPA samples (n = 31) produced consistent results.
The phylogenetic relationships among the closely related TPA samples (n = 31)
were examined and visualized through an MJ network analysis in Network 4.6 and
Network Publisher (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com)50 using all variable
positions after excluding the putative recombinant loci and sites with missing data
(resulting in a total of 628 variable positions).
Clade classification
Samples from this study. From the 70 TPA, TPE and TEN samples sequenced in this
study, 28 fulfilled our criteria for genome-wide analyses (minimum 80% genome
covered with at least 3 reads). For the remaining 42 samples, we implemented two
classification strategies (for full details, see Supplementary Methods). First, we
generated a new clade prediction strategy based on NGS reads to classify the
genomes according to lineage (TPA or TPE/TEN) and within the TPA lineage, as
part of the SS14 or the Nichols clade. Second, we used a classification scheme based
on the TP0548 gene. For the TP0548 classification scheme we carried out PCR and
Sanger sequencing of the TP0548 gene region following the protocols and primers of
ref. 30. SNPs in the TP0548 typing regions enable the distinction of an SS14 clade
versus a Nichols clade. Indels enable the classification of TPE and TEN. Our NGS
prediction strategy was congruent with the TP0548 classification scheme wherever
prediction strength was above 0.4, with the exception of one TEN sample (detailed in
the Supplementary Methods).
Samples from typing studies. We put together all publicly available TP0548 sequences
obtained in typing studies of syphilis infections around the world12,51–58. We also
incorporated TP0548 sequences obtained for 36 Argentinian clinical samples by
LGV at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina (Supplementary Table 9). All
TP0548 sequences were classified as part of the SS14 clade or part of the Nichols
clade based on an ML tree (Supplementary Fig. 5). Subtypes were distinguished
through visual inspection (Supplementary Table 9).
Antibiotic resistance. The two mutations associated with resistance to the
macrolide azithromycin, A2058G and A2059G on the 23S ribosomal RNA operon
(with positions referring to coordinates in the 23S ribosomal RNA gene of
Escherichia coli), were investigated in separate analyses. Because the operon contains
two copies of the gene, mapping of reads with BWA was carried out independently
for each of the genes, including a flanking region of 200 bases on both the 5′ and 3′
end of each genes. Following variant calling, the presence/absence of each of the two
mutations was recorded for each sample. The two operons could not, however,
be distinguished.
In addition, we used primers specific for each of the two operons to carry out
PCR amplifications as well as Sanger sequencing on the samples, following the
protocol in ref. 30. Details on the samples sequenced, as well as resistance or
sensitivity to the macrolide as determined by the presence or absence of the
associated mutations, are provided in Supplementary Table 8.
Data availability. All samples sequenced in this study are available in an NCBI
Bioproject under accession code PRJNA313497. Raw sequencing reads in FASTQ
format were uploaded to the Short Read Archive (SRA). All accession codes are listed
in Supplementary Table 2. Codes for the in-house scripts developed for some of the
analyses are available upon request from the authors. All raw read files have been
deposited in the trace archive of the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession
code SRP072086.
