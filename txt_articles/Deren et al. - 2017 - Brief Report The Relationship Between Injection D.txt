Abstract
High levels of immune activation are reported for people who inject drugs (PWID). Studies of the 
relationship between injection behaviors and immune activation have yielded mixed results, in part 
due to lack of control for HCV in analyses. This study, of 48 HIV-seronegative PWID, examines 
this relationship controlling for HCV viremia. Frequency of injection was positively related to 
markers of immune activation (sCD14, %CD8+CD38+HLADR+T cells), as was duration of 
injection (hs-CRP and D-dimer). Sharing injection equipment was not related to markers studied. 
Findings suggest that efforts to encourage injection cessation or reduction in frequency can have 
positive health benefits through reducing immune activation.

Introduction
Use of heroin and other illicit drugs has been shown to trigger an immunological response1,2 
and high levels of immune activation have been reported for people who inject drugs 
(PWID).3,4 Increasing our understanding of the factors contributing to this heightened 
immune activation, which has been associated with progression of chronic disease and 
disability,5,6 can lead to better health outcomes for PWID.
Studies of the relationship between injection-related behaviors and immune function have 
focused primarily on people who were HIV-infected, and have not yielded consistent results. 
For example, while a lower rate of HIV-1 related disease progression was found among 
those who frequently borrowed injection equipment,7 others have found no relationship

 between sharing injection equipment and the rate of CD4+ cell decline,8 and no relationship 
between frequency of injection and CD4+ cell decline.9 A review of studies on the role of 
substance abuse in HIV disease progression noted that the mixed results pointed to the need 
for further research, and that both laboratory and epidemiological studies are needed.1 
Adding further to the mixed results regarding the influence of injection behaviors on 
immune activation, a recent study conducted with HIV seronegative PWID reported 
heightened immune activation related to needle sharing.3
One contributing factor to these mixed results may be the lack of attention to Hepatitis C 
virus, hyperendemic worldwide among PWID10 and recently found to be related to immune 
activation.11 This paper will examine the relationship between injection drug use behaviors, 
including frequency of injection and sharing injection equipment, and immune activation in 
a sample of HIV seronegative PWID. The analysis will control for the presence of HCV 
viremia.
Methods
Participants and Recruitment
As part of a study exploring the relationship between injection drug use, HCV infection and 
immune activation, 48 HV seronegative PWID were recruited in NYC in 2012–14.11 
Recruitment occurred at needle exchange programs, other harm reduction programs, and 
locations where PWID might be found (e.g., near drug treatment programs, NGOs serving 
PWID and through NYC-based research projects). Presentations and distribution of printed 
recruitment materials and face-to-face interactions with project recruiters at the various 
venues were conducted with the assistance of referrals by program staff. Criteria for 
participation of PWID included: current heroin injection (at least 3 times/week), HIV-
uninfected and aged 18–55.
Procedures
At the first contact, usually in a program or on the street, the project was briefly described to 
potential participants, including incentives and information about the procedures involved 
(interview, blood draws, and sigmoidoscopy). Two experienced recruiters verified current 
injection through examination of track marks and question probes. Those meeting the initial 
criteria were scheduled for an appointment at the research hospital setting where the 
informed consent was administered, including a detailed discussion to ensure the participant 
understood the project procedures before agreeing to participate. After consent was 
obtained, a brief computer-assisted interview was administered, collecting data on (a) 
sociodemographic characteristics, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, residential status; (b) 
injection drug use behaviors: age first injected and current injection behavior, including 
types of drugs, frequency, syringe sharing, injection equipment sharing (cookers, cottons, 
rinse water); and (c) non-injection drug use (alcohol and other substances).
After the interview was completed, a medical history and physical exam were conducted to 
verify eligibility for the study and identify any exclusionary medical conditions. A urine 
screen positive for opiates was required and HIV-seronegative status was confirmed by rapid

 point-of-care serologic testing and a determination of HIV-1 RNA in plasma to rule out 
acute HIV-1 infection. The sigmoidoscopy was scheduled at this time, and was conducted 
approximately two weeks after screening. After results of phlebotomy and urine collection 
were reviewed, inclusion criteria (HIV seronegative, positive heroin toxicology) and 
exclusion criteria (e.g., severe liver disease) were assessed. Those who did not meet the 
criteria for the procedure were contacted and the results and the reason they did not qualify 
were explained and if indicated, a referral for follow up care was provided. Those who met 
the criteria were telephoned the night before their appointment as a reminder. At the 
scheduled date they came to the research hospital setting where a flexible sigmoidoscopy 
with biopsy was performed after phlebotomy for immunologic evaluations (see Mehandru et 
al.4 for description of procedure). Cash incentives were provided for both the screening visit 
and the sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. All protocols were initially reviewed and approved by 
the Rockefeller University IRB, with subsequent approvals obtained from the IRBs of the 
NYU School of Medicine and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. This paper uses baseline 
data for all the active PWIDs who completed the study.
Measures
Immune activation was quantified using cell-associated markers (the expression of HLA-DR 
and CD38 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), soluble markers (soluble CD14 [sCD14] and Tissue 
Necrosis Factor- α [TNF- α]), and select acute phase reactants (high specificity-C reactive 
protein [hs-CRP] (see detail of procedures in Markowitz et al.11) and D-dimer [a fibrin 
degradation product]) measured by enzyme immunoassay (Asserachrome D-DI). HCV viral 
load was determined commercially using a PCR-based assay (LabCorp).
Three types of injection risk behavior were analyzed: (a) a summary measure of sharing 
injection equipment (included sharing needles/syringes, backloading [i.e., having others 
squirt drugs from their syringes into the participant’s syringe] or sharing injection 
paraphernalia [i.e., cookers, cotton, or rinse water]). Participants were asked the number of 
times they engaged in these behaviors in the prior 30 days; (b) duration of injection 
frequency in years; and (c) recent injection frequency, as indicated by the number of days 
injecting in the prior 30 days.
Data analysis
Associations between markers of immune activation and injection behaviors were estimated 
in linear regression models. The model for each biomarker included age (known to be 
related to immune activation markers),12 years injecting, days injecting in the prior 30 days, 
and HCV viremia.
Injection risk sharing behaviors were considered for addition to each linear regression model 
if adding one or more of those variables would increase significantly the proportion of 
variance in the biomarker accounted for by age, years injecting, days injecting in the prior 
30 days, and HCV viremia. Risk behavior variables were transformed (base-10 logarithm) 
before analysis to reduce positive skew in those variables.
Pearson correlations were used to estimate bivariate associations between markers of 
immune activation and injection behaviors separately for HCV viremic and aviremic

 participants. They were also used to estimate bivariate associations between markers of 
immune activation and frequency and duration of injection drug use.
All analysis was conducted in the R statistical computing environment.13 The R effects 
package14 was used to plot linear model predictions of biomarkers of immune activation, 
along with confidence intervals.
Results
Sample Characteristics
A total of 201 potential PWID participants were scheduled for the screening appointment 
and half (100) kept their appointment. Close to half (43) failed screening, with primary 
reasons being negative toxicology (51%) (positive urines for heroin were required), and 
inability to draw venous blood (23%). Of those eligible for study, almost 90% (48) 
successfully completed the procedure and comprised the sample analyzed for this paper.
Table 1 provides sociodemographic and injection risk behavior information for the 
participants. Almost three-quarters (77%) were male, the mean age was 42.5, and 90% were 
minority (African-American and Hispanic). The majority of participants were HCV positive 
(81.3%), and half were viremic. Since participants for this study were recruited prior to 
availability of directly acting agents to treat HCV infection, aviremia among those who were 
HCV-infected was due to spontaneous control and not treatment.
Drug-related behaviors are summarized in Table 1. The average number of years of injection 
was 16.4 (sd=10.3), and number of injections in the prior 30 days, was 158.4 (sd=200.6). 
About 21% reported sharing needles, 4% reported backloading, 29.2% shared other 
paraphernalia and 35% reported any sharing behaviors.
Relationship between injection behaviors and immune activation
As noted, all analyses were conducted controlling for age, years injecting, days injecting in 
the past month, and HCV viremia. More days injecting in the prior 30 days was associated 
with higher sCD14 (B=18.4; 95% CI: 0.7 – 36.1, p=0.042) (Figure 1A) and higher levels of 
%CD8+CD38+HLADR+ T cells, but with only marginal significance (B=0.05, 95% CI: 
0.00 – 0.11, p=0.057) (Figure 1B). More years injecting was associated with higher levels of 
hs-CRP (B=0.03; 95% CI: 0.01 – 0.05, p=0.008). (Figure 1C) and higher levels of D-dimer 
(B=0.01; 95% CI: 0.002 – 0.026, p=0.024) (Figure 1D). Bivariate, unadjusted correlational 
analyses were also conducted, and the results were similar to those in regression models, i.e., 
days injecting was related to sCD14 (r= .25, p=.08) and %CD8+CD38+HLADR+T cells (r=.
31, p=.03), and years injecting was related to hs-CRP (r=.31, p=.03) and D-dimer (r=.36, p=.
01).
None of the variables summarizing the number of times sharing occurred were related to any 
of the markers of immune activation. Correlational analyses were conducted between 
sharing and the immune activation markers studied, separately for HCV viremic and non-
viremic participants. For those who were aviremic, there was a significant correlation 
between sharing and CD4+CD38+HLA DR+T (r=.44, p=.03), and no significant

 associations were found for those who were viremic. In addition, none of the injection-
related variables examined were related to TNF-α or to CD4+CD38+HLA DR+T cells.
In sensitivity analysis, number of days injecting in the prior 30 days was replaced with total 
number of times injecting in the prior 30 days. Number of times injecting was associated 
with higher sCD14, but with only marginal significance (p=0.098). Number of years 
injecting (p=0.033) and number of times injecting (p=0.032) were each associated with 
higher hs-CRP. Years injecting was associated with higher D-dimer, but with only marginal 
significance (p=0.058). Number of times injecting was not related to mean level of 
%CD8+CD38+HLADR+ T cells.
Discussion
Our findings indicate that duration of injection (as measured by the total number of years 
injected) and recent injection frequency (assessed by the number of days injected in the prior 
30 days) were positively correlated with select markers of immune activation. Sharing of 
injection equipment (needles and paraphernalia) was not significantly related to the immune 
activation markers studied. While this differs from the results reported by Tomescu et al.3 
this discrepancy may be attributed to the many differences between the studies. For example, 
Tomescu looked at NK cells, while our analysis used T cells; our analysis controlled for 
HCV viremia; and there were differences in the characteristics of the participants recruited 
(e.g., frequency of injection was lower in the Tomescu study- about once per day compared 
with an average of over 5 times per day in our sample). Furthermore, frequency of needle 
sharing appeared to be higher in the Tomescu study, however, since the time periods studied 
differed (6 months vs 30 days), this was not directly comparable.
The relationship between the number of injection exposures (length of time injecting and 
frequency) and immune activation found in the current study may be attributable to 
contaminants in the injection materials themselves, and more detailed study of the causal 
chain is needed. We have shown the relationship between HCV viremia and immune 
activation, and that cessation of injection among PWID who are HCV aviremic can result in 
normalization of select markers of immune activation.11 These results together indicate that 
while cessation of injection has positive effects on immune activation, harm reduction efforts 
that reduce injection frequency (even if not leading to cessation) can also have salutary 
effects by reducing immune activation.
Importantly, several studies of HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) PWID have reported 
higher levels of immunological activation. For example, Tran et al studied a cohort of 
Vietnamese HESN and observed heightened levels of immune activation parameters (as 
defined by CD38, HLA-DR and CD25) in HESN than in the controls, similar to the data 
reported in the present study.15 Recent data by Kallas et al also show a similar increase in 
immune activation parameters (as defined by the expression of HLA-DR and CCR5 on 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) in PWID who were seronegative for HIV-1, HCV and HBV, 
when compared to non-IDU controls.16 Higher immune activation among other HESN has 
also been reported among other groups,17 including sex workers18 and infants born to HIV-
infected women.19 Heightened levels of immune activation in PWID may be associated with

 anti-HIV-1 activity as proposed by Tran et al.15 Alternatively, activated immune cells may 
enhance HIV-1 susceptibility. This supports the need for further study of the relationships 
between injection risk behaviors, immune activation, and HIV transmission. We are 
currently pursuing research strategies to better understand the complex interplay between 
immune activation and the risk of HIV-1 acquisition using systems-based approaches as 
previously reported by Burgener et al.20
Another important conclusion from this study was the demonstration that active PWID can 
be recruited to participate in studies of immune activation, even those involving biomedical 
procedures such as a sigmoidoscopy.21 While the loss of participants from recruitment to 
screening was substantial, at approximately 50%, this is not surprising given the unstable life 
styles of many PWID. Importantly, close to 90% of those who were screened and found 
eligible for the study completed all components.
Further research on the relationship between injection-related behaviors and immune 
activation is needed. The disparate findings in studies of the relationship between injection 
behaviors and markers of immune activation highlight the need for undertaking studies 
based on larger samples, with variability in duration of injection, injection frequency and 
injection related sharing behaviors, to disentangle the role of specific injection-related 
behaviors and of other influences on immune activation. We have demonstrated the 
importance of considering HCV viremia in studies of immune activation among PWID.11 
Thus, studies also must examine the impact of HCV viremia. Our results showing a 
significant correlation for sharing behaviors and an immune activation marker for HCV 
aviremic participants indicate that separate analyses by HCV viremia status, rather than 
simply controlling for HCV viremia as a main effect, may be indicated. In addition to 
injection-related behaviors, age-related comorbidities as well as life style factors22 must be 
considered in studies of immune activation among PWID.
