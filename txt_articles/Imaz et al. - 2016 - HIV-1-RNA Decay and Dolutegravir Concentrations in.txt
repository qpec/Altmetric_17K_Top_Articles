Background.
The objective of this study was to quantify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNA decay and dolute-
gravir (DTG) concentrations in the semen of HIV-infected patients receiving DTG-based first-line therapy.
Methods.
This was a prospective, single-arm, open-label study including 15 HIV-1–infected, antiretroviral therapy–naive men
starting once-daily treatment with DTG (50 mg) plus abacavir-lamivudine (600/300 mg). HIV-1 RNA was measured in seminal plas-
ma (SP) and blood plasma (BP) at baseline, on days 3, 7, and 14, and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. The HIV-1 RNA decay rate was assessed
using nonlinear mixed-effects models. Total and free DTG concentrations were quantified 24 hours after the dose at weeks 4 and 24
by means of a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method.
Results.
Viral decay was faster in BP than in SP in the first decay phase (half-life, 4.5 vs 8.6 days; P = .001) with no statistically
significant differences in the second phase. HIV-1 RNA suppression (<40 copies/mL) was reached earlier in SP (4 vs 12 weeks;
P = .008) due to lower baseline HIV-1 RNA levels. The median total DTG 24 hours after the dose in SP was 119.1 ng/mL (range,
27.2–377 ng/mL), which represents 7.8% of BP exposure. The median DTG free-fraction in SP was 48% of the total drug. Seminal
protein-unbound DTG concentrations exceeded the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (0.21 ng/mL) by a median of 214-fold.
Conclusions.
DTG concentrations in SP are sufficient to contribute to rapid seminal HIV-1 RNA suppression.

Sexual transmission is the most common route of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition in most regions of
the world [1],and semen of HIV-infected men is a major vector
for new HIV infections. Treatment of HIV-infected patients
with currently available combined antiretroviral (ARV) therapy
(ART) reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by their sexual
partners [2, 3]. HIV transmission during unprotected sexual
intercourse is associated with the presence of HIV in genital
fluids, and the efficacy of ART in preventing new infection is
based on the ability to reduce HIV viral load in these fluids
[4]. In addition, the male genital tract is a separate reservoir
for HIV [5] and may contribute to HIV shedding in seminal
fluid, even in patients receiving ART [6, 7]. Thus, the ability
of ARV drugs to penetrate into the male genital tract is a key
factor for achieving HIV suppression in seminal fluid and pre-
venting sexual transmission of the virus [8].
Dolutegravir (DTG) is a new integrase inhibitor (INI) with
high antiviral potency and a high genetic barrier to resistance
[9]. The pharmacokinetic profile of this drug allows once-daily
administration in INI-naive patients. In large phase III-a ran-
domized clinical trials, DTG (50 mg once daily) in combination
with 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) has
shown noninferiority compared with raltegravir and superiority
to efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted darunavir as first-line therapy
in treatment-naive HIV-1–infected patients [10–12].
However, DTG is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%,
mainly albumin and α acid glycoprotein) [13] and is a substrate
for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resis-
tance protein (BCRP) [14], which might limit its penetration
into viral reservoirs, such as the genital tract. A recent study
in healthy volunteers showed that DTG penetration in seminal
fluid was <7% of DTG exposure in blood plasma (BP), and
the median seminal concentration at the end of the dosing in-
terval (C24h) was lower than the in vitro protein-adjusted (PA)
90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) for wild-type HIV-1 [15].
There is no information regarding DTG concentrations in the
semen of HIV-1–infected patients or the antiviral activity of a
DTG-based ARV combination in this compartment. The aim
of the current study was to compare viral decay kinetics and
DTG concentrations (total drug and unbound fraction) in the

 seminal plasma (SP) and BP in a group of treatment-naive HIV-
1–infected patients starting DTG plus abacavir (ABC) and lam-
ivudine (3TC) once daily.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
A prospective, single-arm, open-label, 24-week pilot study
including 15 HIV-1–infected patients was conducted at the
HIV outpatient clinic of the Bellvitge University Hospital
in Barcelona, Spain, between February and September 2014.
Eligible participants were male adults (≥18 years old) with
chronic HIV-1 infection who had not been previously exposed
to ART and had a screening plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA)
>5000 copies/mL, and negative status for the HLA-B*5701
allele. The exclusion criteria were evidence of primary viral
resistance to the study drugs, concomitant sexually transmitted
infection, hepatitis B, hepatitis C that might need treatment
during the study, moderate or severe hepatic impairment,
estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min, active oppor-
tunistic infections, or active malignant conditions. All partici-
pants received ART with DTG (50 mg) together with the
NRTI combination of ABC (600 mg( plus 3TC (300 mg) in a
fixed-dose tablet (Kivexa; ViiV Healthcare), all taken once daily.
The study protocol was approved by the ethics review com-
mittee of the Bellvitge University Hospital, in accordance with
the principles of the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki and the
Spanish regulatory authorities. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants before any study procedures
were performed. This study was registered at the EU Clinical
Trials Registry (EudraCT 2013-003243-36).
Procedures and Assessments
Study visits were scheduled at baseline, on days 3, 7, and 14, and at
weeks 4, 12, and 24. At each study visit, paired blood and semen
samples were obtained through peripheral venous puncture and
self-masturbation, respectively, to assess HIV-1 RNA. At weeks
4 and 24, an additional set of blood and semen samples were col-
lected 3 days apart for the analysis of DTG concentrations. These
additional samples were planned in the study protocol to ensure
that the quantity of seminal fluid would be enough to analyze
both HIV-1 RNA and drug concentrations. Participants were ad-
vised to take ABC/3TC and DTG every day at same time in the
morning. After confirmation that the last doses of ABC/3TC and
DTG were taken correctly and on time, blood and semen samples
were obtained at the end of the dosing interval (23–25 hours after
the last dose and before the next). Participants were recommended
to abstain from sexual activity for at least 72 hours before each
semen sample was obtained.
In addition, CD4+ lymphocyte count, hematology, and chemis-
try (liver function, renal function, electrolytes and lipids) tests were
performed at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. Clinical events
and ART-related adverse events were recorded at each study visit.
Laboratory Methods
Sexually transmitted infections were ruled out in all participants
before ART was started. Urinary leukocytes were measured by
flow cytometry (negative at <6/µL), Chlamydia trachomatis and
Neisseria gonorrhoeae were tested by polymerase chain reaction
in urine samples (Xpert CT/NG; Cepheid), and syphilis was
screened for by serologic testing in plasma.
Semen samples (collected at home or in a private room at
hospital) were transported in sterile sample collection contain-
ers. Both blood and semen samples were processed within 2
hours after collection. Specimens were centrifuged to obtain
BP and SP. HIV-1 RNA levels in BP and SP were measured
using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (Abbott
RealTime HIV-1) with a quantification limit of 40 copies/mL.
The BP and SP samples used to measure DTG concentration
were transferred to microvials and frozen at −80°C until
analysis.
DTG concentrations were measured at the University of
North Carolina Center for AIDS Research Clinical Pharmacol-
ogy and Analytical Chemistry Core, using a validated liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
method, as described elsewhere [15]. The calibration range
was 20–20 000 ng/mL for BP and 1–1000 ng/mL for SP. All
calibrators and quality control samples were within 15% of
the nominal value for both within-day and between-day runs.
Within-day and between-day analytical precision was <15%.
Recovery of DTG and its internal standard with this method
was approximately 100%. Protein-unbound DTG concentra-
tions were analyzed in plasma and semen from 13 subjects
using a modification of a method developed by Weller et al
[16], with rapid equilibrium dialysis (Thermo Scientific) and
LC/MS/MS analysis. To quantify both bound and unbound
DTG concentrations, the extraction was slightly modified to
allow for a calibration range of 0.25–5000 ng/mL. The removal
of the final dilution step before analysis with an increased injec-
tion volume allowed for the new lower limit of quantification.
Statistical Methods
Nonparametric statistical tests were used in the between- and
within-group comparisons (Mann–Whitney U and signed-
rank tests, respectively) and to determine associations between
variables (Spearman test). A log rank test and Cox regression
model were used to assess the time to achieve HIV-1 RNA
below the limit of detection. The ratio between log10 HIV
RNA variances in BP and SP was evaluated using a paired ver-
sion of the Levene test. Mean longitudinal changes in log10 HIV
RNA in the paired samples were analyzed using nonlinear
mixed-effects models, based on the equations suggested by
Perelson et al [17] and Wu and Ding [18]. Each parameter
was assumed to have a fixed effect, and, given the study design,
2-level nested random effects (individual|time point|compart-
ment). Akaike and Bayesian information criteria were used

 for model selection. All analyses were carried out using the R
(version 3.1.2) statistical package [19].
RESULTS
Of 16 patients screened, 15 who were eligible according to the
study entry criteria were enrolled and completed the study. The
participants’ characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The me-
dian age (range) was 35 (22–60) years, the median CD4+ T-cell
count at baseline was 504 (60–782) cells/µL, and the median BP
and SP HIV-1 RNA levels were 5.03 (4.02–5.76) and 3.91 (2.97–
4.82) log10 copies/mL, respectively. There were no differences in
median BP or SP HIV-1 RNA levels according to B or non-B
HIV-1 subtype (data not shown).
A significant correlation between HIV-1 RNA levels in BP and
SP was observed at baseline (Spearman ρ = 0.575; P = .03). The
HIV-1 RNA decrease at each study time point is shown in Figure 1
and Table 2. The median HIV-1 RNA decrease from baseline was
significantly smaller in SP than in BP samples at all time points.
Furthermore, the Levene test showed higher heterogeneity of var-
iance in SP than in BP samples (data not shown). These findings
are consistent with differing decay dynamics in the 2 compart-
ments. To further evaluate the dynamics of viral decay after
ART initiation based on HIV-1 RNA decreases in BP and SP sam-
ples, the model that best fit our data was 2-phase decay kinetics
followed by a plateau (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table).
Viral decay was significantly faster in BP than in SP in the first
decay phase (half-life, 4.5 vs 8.6 days; P = .001). Although decay
in the second phase was also faster in BP, the difference was not
statistically significant (half-life, 54 vs 156 days; P = .43).
The median time to HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL was signifi-
cantly shorter in SP than in BP samples (4 vs 12 weeks;
P = .008). However, in a Cox regression model adjusted by
HIV-1 RNA higher or lower than 5 log at baseline, no differenc-
es were found between the 2 compartments (P = .88). HIV-1
RNA suppression at week 4 occurred in SP in 11 individuals
and in BP in 7. BP and SP viral loads at baseline did not differ
significantly between patients with seminal HIV-1 RNA persis-
tence or suppression at week 4 (4.39 vs 4.25 and 3.96 vs 3.66
log10 copies/mL, respectively; P = .24 and P = .79).
Two patients had detectable HIV-1 RNA in BP at week 24 (60
and 41 copies/mL, respectively), whereas HIV-1 RNA in SP of
these patients had already fallen to <40 copies/mL at weeks 2
and 4, respectively. Both patients achieved BP HIV-1 RNA
<40 copies/mL 8 weeks later. One other patient had detectable
seminal HIV-1 RNA (441 copies/mL) at week 24, whereas the
BP viral load had been <40 copies/mL since week 2. This pa-
tient, who remained on the same ART regimen, consented to
provide a new semen sample 19 weeks after completion of the
study, when the HIV-1 RNA level was <40 copies/mL.
A significant correlation was observed between DTG concen-
trations in the paired BP and SP samples (Spearman P < .001).
The median (range) total DTG concentrations in BP at the end
of the dosing interval (C24h) at weeks 4 and 24 were 1200 (124–
2290) and 1420 (353–3100) ng/mL (Table 3), which exceed 18.7-
and 22.2-fold, respectively, the in vitro PA-IC90 for wild-type
HIV-1 (64 ng/mL). The median total DTG concentrations in
SP at weeks 4 and 24 were 92.2 (15.7–331) and 129 (38.8–423)
ng/mL, respectively (Table 3). Overall, the median SP-to-BP
ratio was 7.83% (3.65%–20.54%). The total DTG C24h was
below the in vitro PA-IC90 in 5 patients at week 4 and also at
week 24 in 2. Those with the lowest seminal DTG C24h also
had the lowest BP DTG C24h.
Unbound DTG concentrations in paired BP and SP samples
could be analyzed in 13 of the 15 participants (including those
with the lowest total DTG concentrations). The median (range)
unbound DTG fractions in BP and SP were 0.45% (0.39%–
0.56%) and 48% (34.2%–59.7%) of total drug concentration,
respectively (Table 3). Extrapolating these percentages of
DTG free concentrations to the total concentrations measured
at weeks 4 and 24, the estimated median (range) unbound
DTG concentrations in BP were 5.17 (3.11–10.01) and 6.23
(3.02–12.42) ng/mL, respectively. The estimated unbound
DTG concentrations in SP were 34 (5.4–158.8) and 56 (13.4–
203) ng/mL, which exceed 170- and 280-fold the in vitro
unbound 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for wild type
HIV-1 (0.21 ng/mL). Thus, the estimated average free DTG
C24h in SP (45.05 ng/mL) was 214-fold higher than the in
vitro unbound IC50, and the patient with the lowest total
DTG C24h observed in SP would have free seminal DTG C24h
26-fold the in vitro unbound IC50 (Table 3).
The patients with detectable HIV-1 RNA in BP or SP samples
at week 24 had total DTG concentrations above the in vitro PA-
IC90 in both compartments. Interestingly, the patient with de-
tectable seminal HIV-1 RNA at week 24 had the highest seminal
DTG concentrations at both 4 and 24 weeks. No significant cor-
relations were found between DTG concentrations at day 28
and time to HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL (Spearman P = .84).

 DISCUSSION
HIV-1 RNA suppression in seminal fluid might be limited by
ARV penetration into the male genital tract and compartmen-
talized infection in this HIV reservoir. The antiviral activity of a
DTG-based ARV regimen in the genital tract of HIV-1–infected
male patients has not been assessed to date. Furthermore, determi-
nation of HIV-1 decay kinetics in seminal fluid might help to bet-
ter understand the role of DTG-based regimens for preventing

 HIV-1 transmission. In the current study, we found that HIV-1
RNA decay dynamics in HIV-1–infected patients starting DTG
plus ABC/3TC as first-line ART differ in the 2 compartments,
being faster in BP than in SP, although statistically significant
differences were observed only in the first decay phase.
We also found that the DTG concentration in SP was 7.8%
that seen in BP, similar to the findings reported in healthy vol-
unteers [15], with the DTG C24h lower than the in vitro PA-IC90
in some patients. Nevertheless, all except 1 of the 15 patients
studied achieved rapid HIV-1 RNA suppression in SP, with
an even shorter median time to suppression than in BP.
In addition to other physicochemical properties, such as mo-
lecular weight or lipophilicity, ARV penetration into the genital
tract is thought to be determined mainly by BP protein binding
[20]. Thus, the low penetration of DTG into the male genital
tract may be explained mainly by the drug’s high BP protein
binding (>99%). However, total DTG seminal exposure was
higher than the free drug concentration in BP, suggesting that
drug uptake transporters in addition to passive diffusion of
unbound drug may be implicated in DTG penetration in the
male genital tract [21].
Because of lower drug binding protein concentrations in SP
than in BP [20, 22], protein binding of certain ARV drugs has
been found to be lower in SP [23]. Unbound DTG C24h was
measured in 13 of 15 participants. The median free DTG frac-
tion in BP was 0.45% of the total drug, concordant with previ-
ously published data [13], whereas the median free DTG
fraction in SP was 48% of the total drug. Therefore, we could
estimate that the seminal unbound DTG C24h was a median
of 214-fold higher than the in vitro unbound IC50 (0.21 ng/mL).
The subject with the lowest observed total DTG C24h in SP had an
unbound SP concentration 26-fold above the in vitro unbound
IC50. Of note, 4 of the 5 patients with the lowest total DTG con-
centrations experienced rapid suppression of seminal HIV-1 RNA,
even before that of BP.
Although ABC and 3TC achieve high seminal concentrations
[20, 24, 25] and the activity of this NRTI backbone must also be
taken also into account, the high free DTG concentrations in SP
supports the contribution of DTG to HIV-1 suppression in this
compartment. The only patient with detectable HIV-1 RNA at
week 24 had the highest seminal DTG concentrations and the
highest DTG SP/BP ratio. Resistance-associated mutations to
INIs or NRTI were not observed with baseline BP genotypic
resistance testing. We attempted to perform this testing on a
stored baseline seminal remnant sample, but it was not techni-
cally possible. Further testing showed that this patient achieved
HIV-1 RNA suppression after the study period. In this case,
compartmentalized HIV replication in the genital tract might
have been the obstacle preventing earlier HIV suppression rath-
er than insufficient ARV levels in this reservoir.
Consistent with these findings, no significant correlation was
observed between DTG concentrations and the time to achieve
HIV-1 RNA below the detection limit in each compartment. In-
terestingly, a good correlation between BP DTG concentration
and HIV-1 RNA decline after 10 days of DTG monotherapy has
been observed in a previous phase IIa trial [26]. This differing
pharmacodynamic behavior highlights the multiple factors that
can influence HIV suppression in seminal fluid, including drug
penetration, compartmentalized and autonomous HIV replica-
tion, and the possible interindividual variability related to these
aspects.
A significant correlation between HIV-1 RNA in BP and SP
was observed at baseline. Median HIV-1 RNA in SP at baseline
was 1 log lower compared to median HIV-1 RNA in BP that is
concordant with other previously published studies [4].At week
24, all but 2 patients had HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL in BP al-
though it is worthy of note that these 2 patients had a favorable
HIV-1 RNA decrease (41 and 60 copies/mL). Only 1 patient did
not have a favorable virologic response in SP, with the HIV-1
RNA level remaining at 441 copies/mL while undetectable in
BP; that finding is concordant with compartmentalized HIV-
1 RNA dynamics in the genital tract, as has also been previously
described [5–7].
Significantly smaller decreases in HIV-1 RNA in SP com-
pared with BP were observed at each time point, as well as
greater heterogeneity in HIV-1 RNA decline over time. This
heterogeneity is also concordant with the compartmentalized
dynamics of HIV infection in the genital tract and the role of
different organs within the male genital tract as the source of
virions and/or infected cells for semen, such as the epididymis,
seminal vesicles, prostate, and urethra [27].
We observed a faster HIV-1 RNA decay in BP than in SP,
although statistically significant differences were only observed
in the first decay phase. Although the absence of significant
differences in the second decay phase could be explained by
the limited sample size and the low HIV-1 RNA values in this
second phase, a similar pattern of initially slower HIV-1 RNA
decay in seminal fluid than in plasma, but no difference in
the second-phase decay rate has been also observed in patients
receiving efavirenz-based ART [28].
However, the median time to HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL
was significantly shorter in SP than in BP samples, that can
be explained by the lower seminal viral load at baseline. DTG
and other INIs have shown earlier plasma HIV-1 suppression
than either efavirenz or protease inhibitors [11, 12, 29, 30].
Although patients starting ART have a significantly lower risk
of HIV transmission than untreated patients [3], a very rapid
HIV-RNA decline and suppression in seminal fluid might result
in an even lower probability of transmission immediately after
starting therapy, which could be of interest in certain high-risk
individuals. Interestingly, a recent study in serodiscordant
couples has demonstrated high efficacy in preventing HIV
transmission when preexposure prophylaxis is used by the
HIV-negative partners of HIV-1–infected patients before and

 during the first 6 months after starting ART [31]. The early
seminal HIV-1 suppression achieved by DTG-based regimens,
and perhaps other INIs, could reduce the time needed for pre-
exposure prophylaxis in serodiscordant couples with a high risk
of HIV transmission.
Our study has some limitations. As in other studies assessing
pharmacokinetics in these viral reservoirs, our sample size is
small, which makes the results more susceptible to influence
by interindividual and intraindividual variability. Nevertheless,
we performed 2 separate determinations of seminal and BP
DTG concentrations in each patient, and our results are similar
to those observed in healthy volunteers. On the other hand, we
only measured HIV-1 RNA in SP; therefore, the role of ongoing
HIV-1 RNA production from long-lived infected cells in semen
was not considered in our model.
In summary, this study showed that despite an initially slower
HIV-1 RNA decline in SP than in BP samples, rapid HIV-1
RNA suppression in seminal fluid is achieved in most patients
starting first-line ART with DTG plus ABC/3TC. These findings
could be of interest for reducing the HIV transmission risk after
ART initiation. Although the seminal DTG concentration is
only 7.8% of the concentration in BP, it is sufficient to contrib-
ute to suppress HIV-1 replication in this compartment.
