Intranasal administration of 
resveratrol successfully prevents 
lung cancer in A/J mice
Aymeric Monteillier, Aymone Voisin, Pascal Furrer, Eric Allémann & Muriel Cuendet  
Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer in the world. About 80% of lung cancer deaths are linked 
to tobacco use. As a complement to tobacco control, efficient chemoprevention strategies are 
needed to tackle lung cancer epidemic. Resveratrol is one of the most studied natural products, 
notably for its cancer chemoprevention properties. However, its low oral bioavailability has often 
limited the translation of in vitro activities to in vivo effects. While oral administration of resveratrol 
effectively inhibited colorectal carcinogenesis, it failed to protect mice from chemically-induced lung 
carcinogenesis. Therefore, non-invasive parenteral routes must be considered to bring resveratrol 
to the lungs. In the present study, intranasal administration of a concentrated formulation proved 
to be a valid method to expose the lungs to a sufficient amount of resveratrol. This formulation was 
administered three times a week for 25 weeks to A/J mice having 4-[methyl(nitroso)amino]-1-(3-
pyridinyl)-1-butanone-induced lung carcinogenesis. Resveratrol-treated mice showed a 27% decrease 
in tumour multiplicity, with smaller tumours, resulting in 45% decrease in tumour volume/mouse. In 
vitro investigations highlighted apoptosis as a potential mechanism of action. This study presents an 
effective way to overcome resveratrol low oral bioavailability, encouraging a reevaluation of its use in 
future clinical trials.
Lung cancer is the worldwide leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 1.69 of the 8.8 million global cancer 
deaths in 2015. Behind these striking numbers, tobacco smoke stands as the major risk factor and is responsible 
for about 80% of those deaths1, highlighting the preventability of most lung cancers. Despite the general decrease 
in smoking prevalence due to growing tobacco control strategies2, the global number of smokers continues to 
rise every year and is estimated to reach about 1.1 billion in 20253,4. Although efficient tobacco control strategies, 
such as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, are essential to fight the tobacco smoke epidemic 
and the associated lung cancer deaths, their implementation takes time and will probably mainly benefit future 
generations. A complementary approach is therefore needed to prevent those deaths, involving the development 
of both early cancer diagnosis and chemoprevention strategies. While considerable advances have been made in 
early diagnosis, mainly through low dose computed tomographic screening, which was able to reduce the mor-
tality from lung cancer by 20%5, lung cancer chemoprevention strategies are still under development and none 
are yet validated for clinical use6. Considering that a chemopreventive drug would be administered to persons at 
risk during a long period for a disease they are not sure to develop, it should have a limited impact on their daily 
life. This implies a very good toxicity profile with none or minor adverse effects, as well as a convenient phar-
maceutical form and administration route. Up to now, most of the 12 FDA approved cancer chemopreventive 
agents do not totally fulfill these requirements in terms of toxicity, therefore restricting their use to a small part 
of the population for whom the high cancer risk justifies the drug adverse effects. A good example is the use of 
tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator that, despite its ability to decrease up to 50% the probability of 
developing breast cancer, is limited to women at high risk due to increased probability of developing endometrial 
cancer or thrombotic events7. Another example is the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 
colorectal cancer prevention, which is limited by the gastrointestinal bleeding that they promote. Finding agents 
with a better toxicology profile could extend their use to a greater number of patients, hence increasing the cov-
erage and the preventive efficacy.

An important target in lung cancer chemoprevention is tobacco-induced inflammation. Among the 12 
FDA approved drugs for cancer chemoprevention, three are NSAIDs (aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac sodium)6. 
Inflammation is widely recognized as a tumour promoter, mainly through an overactivation of the nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-κ
B) pathway. This was observed in both preclinical models and in human patients, and resulted in 
the expression of genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, mobility and angiogenesis8–11. NF-κ
B was nec-
essary for the development of lung adenocarcinoma in mice, and its inhibition induced tumour regression12,13. 
Among the natural compounds that combine anti-inflammatory properties through NF-κ
B inhibition and a 
safe toxicology profile, resveratrol (3,5,4′
-trihydroxystilbene, RES) is probably the most extensively studied. This 
phytoalexin, produced by a great variety of plants and present in numerous food products such as grapes, peanuts 
and berries, has generated a huge interest since the discovery of its cancer chemopreventive activity 20 years 
ago14. While the amount of in vitro data generated since then confirmed its activity in various types of cancers, in 
vivo studies have often been damped down by the poor pharmacokinetic profile of RES15,16. When taken orally, 
RES is indeed highly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract but quickly and extensively metabolized in the 
liver and then excreted in the urine. Therefore, only a minor fraction of the absorbed RES will eventually reach 
the internal organs, making its activity dependent on the administration route17. Several studies showed that oral 
administration of RES effectively inhibited carcinogenesis in the digestive tract, but failed to protect mice from 
chemically-induced lung carcinogenesis18–21. In this context, other administration routes must be considered to 
bring sufficient doses of RES to the lung tissue and the pulmonary route seems the most indicated. Moreover, 
a local administration presents the advantage of limiting a possible systemic toxicity, therefore improving the 
safety profile6. The present study proposes an effective way to overcome RES low oral bioavailability and there-
fore to reveal its potential for lung cancer chemoprevention in vivo. The efficacy of RES was assessed in the 
well-established 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung carcinogenesis model 
in A/J mice, mimicking the tobacco-induced lung carcinogenesis in humans22. Further in vitro investigations 
provided insights on RES mechanism of action.
Results and Discussion
Design of a pharmaceutical formulation for lung delivery and pharmacokinetic study. 
In an 
attempt to achieve local administration of RES, a major obstacle resided in its very poor water solubility (0.03 mg/
ml). This problem being shared with many other bioactive natural compounds, several strategies have been devel-
oped to increase the water solubility of such molecules, going from simple co-solvation with organic solvents 
(e.g. DMSO) to the use of lipid nanoparticles. Among those strategies, hydroxypropyl-β
-cyclodextrin (HPCD), 
a FDA-approved non-toxic excipient notably used in injectable formulations, led to a huge increase in RES water 
solubility, reaching up to 38 mg/ml23. This excipient was therefore chosen to design the pharmacological formu-
lation for lung administration of RES. A sterile 200 mM hydroxypropyl-β
-cyclodextrin (HPCD) saline solution 
was used to solubilize 24 mg/ml (105 mM) of RES, allowing the administration of a high amount of RES (1.2 mg/
mouse) in a limited volume (50 μ
l) through intranasal instillation. Among the several methods existing to admin-
ister a solution to mice lungs, intranasal instillation is probably the easiest and was shown efficient in lung cancer 
chemoprevention studies24. Quantification of RES content in both lung tissues and the blood stream at differ-
ent time-points showed a peak concentration at 5 min and a substantially decreased concentration at 15 min 
for both compartments (Fig. 1a,b). Compared to previously published results using the oral route25, pulmonary 
administration was 22.5 times more efficient to bring RES to the lungs, and 2.5 times more efficient to bring RES 
to the blood stream, reaching a 20 µM blood concentration (Table 1). The shape of the distribution curves dis-
played however the same quick absorption and clearance of RES from the lungs after pulmonary administration, 
partly through systemic absorption. Nonetheless, the combination of the formulation with an intranasal mode of 
Figure 1. RES content over time in lung tissue (a) and in the blood (b) after a single intranasal administration 
of 1.2 mg/mouse RES (n = 3 for each time point).

administration allowed the exposure of lung tissues to a high amount of RES and could therefore be used for the 
lung carcinogenesis study.
RES successfully prevented NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis. 
The well-established NNK-induced 
lung carcinogenesis model in A/J mice was used to evaluate RES effect on lung carcinogenesis (Fig. 2a). Two 
intraperitoneal injections of NNK resulted in 100% lung cancer incidence after 25 weeks, with up to 27 tumours/
mouse. RES treatment significantly reduced both tumour multiplicity (P = 0.0472) and size (P = 0.0324 for 
tumours of 0.5–1 mm in diameter, P = 0.0128 for tumours bigger than 1 mm) in NNK-induced groups, without 
however impacting incidence (Fig. 2b–d,f). In non NNK-induced groups, RES treatment decreased spontane-
ous tumour incidence by 57% (Fig. 2e). No adverse effect was observed in either group as indicated by the body 
weight curves (Fig. 2g) and the absence of behavioural changes during the study. Therefore, despite its quick clear-
ance, pulmonary administration proved to be an efficient way to administer a high amount of RES to the lungs 
and revealed its lung cancer chemopreventive properties in a chemically-induced lung carcinogenesis model, in 
which oral administration has failed.
RES acted independently of the NF-κ
B pathway. 
To better understand the mechanisms involved in 
the observed in vivo lung cancer chemopreventive activity, RES effect on the NF-κ
B pathway was first evaluated 
by looking at the nuclear translocation of p65, a subunit of the transcription factor that translocates upon activa-
tion. Surprisingly, immunohistochemical analysis of lung samples from both groups treated with NNK (with and 
without RES) revealed no p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 3). A possible explanation is that all observed tumours 
were adenomas, which are early stage tumours while NF-κ
B activation was shown in late stage tumours11. 
Therefore, the mechanism of action responsible for the in vivo effects of RES is probably independent of its NF-κ
B 
inhibitory properties.
RES increased NNK-induced γ
-H2AX phenotype. 
The apparent NF-κ
B independence of RES mecha-
nism of action led to the investigation of other plausible aspects of NNK-induced carcinogenesis that could have 
been affected by the treatment. A hypothesis was that RES could act by limiting NNK-induced DNA damage, 
as such genoprotection was observed in vitro against benzo[a]pyrene DNA toxicity26. NNK is a procarcinogen 
that becomes genotoxic after bioactivation by CYP2A6 and CYP2A13, two extrahepatic cytochromes expressed 
in the lungs27. Inhibition of CYP2A6 efficiently protected A/J mice from NNK-induced lung carcinogenesis28, 
highlighting the interest of CYP inhibitors in lung cancer chemoprevention. Interestingly, RES is known to inhibit 
multiple CYPs including CYP2A629, but its activity on CYP2A13, the most important in NNK bioactivation, is 
not known. The potential of RES to protect A549 cells from NNK-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) was 
therefore investigated using γ
-H2AX as a biomarker. Surprisingly, both western blot and immunocytochemistry 
results showed that RES promoted NNK-induced γ
-H2AX phenotype, suggesting an induction of NNK genotox-
icity instead of the expected protection (Fig. 4). Although unexpected, the observed γ
-H2AX induction following 
RES treatment was consistent with recent data from Luo et al.30. Induction of γ
-H2AX being also involved in the 
apoptosis process31, the present observations could be caused by RES proapoptotic activity in A549 cells rather 
than a real genotoxic effect.
RES induced apoptosis in A549 cells. 
Apoptosis induction by RES in A549 cells was evaluated to investi-
gate the link between γ
-H2AX expression and apoptosis. Both apoptosis and γ
-H2AX induction were observed at 
the same RES concentrations, suggesting that those two responses to RES treatment were part of a same biological 
process (Fig. 5). To further understand if RES-induced apoptosis was linked to the NNK-induced DNA damage, 
apoptosis was measured without NNK treatment. Similar results were obtained with and without NNK treatment, 
supporting an NNK independent mechanism. These in vitro results point at apoptosis induction in lung cancer 
cells as a potential mechanism of action involved in RES chemopreventive activity. Both γ
-H2AX and apoptosis 
induction occurred at 40 μ
M, an applicable in vivo concentration for the lung compartment, considering that 
5 min after administration, the blood concentration was of 20 μ
M. Because of its involvement in the apoptosis 
process, the use of γ
-H2AX induction as a biomarker of DSB was unfortunately not able to provide clear informa-
tion about RES effect on NNK-induced genotoxicity. It remains possible that part of the chemopreventive activity 
of RES was due to CYP2A6 and/or CYP2A13 inhibition, preventing NNK bioactivation. However, the difference 
in tumour incidence between both groups that did not receive NNK (with and without RES, Fig. 2e), therefore 
representing spontaneous carcinogenesis, suggests an NNK-independent mechanism, such as the one observed 
with apoptosis induction. Unfortunately, the design of this study did not allow to observe the proapoptotic effect 
of RES on lung slices, nor its effect on cell proliferation (analysed using TUNEL and Ki-67 staining, respectively; 
data not shown). A possible explanation may be that the sacrifice, which happened three days after the last RES 
treatment, was too late for observing any direct effect of RES.

Overall, these results tend to support the hypothesis that the low oral bioavailability of RES was at least partly 
responsible for the lack of activity observed in former studies, pointing at other routes of administration as potent 
ways to overcome it. Even though pulmonary administration may not be the most convenient parenteral route to 
administer low bioavailability drugs compared to transdermal or sublingual routes, it offers the obvious advan-
tage of reaching the appropriate location. Other parenteral routes should however be investigated in the search 
for the best activity/convenience ratio that will ensure a satisfactory observance. The transdermal administration 
could offer the advantage of a continuous drug delivery, allowing long term systemic exposure to the drug instead 
of the peak shaped pharmacokinetic profile observed with both oral and lung delivery32. An improvement of this 
pharmacokinetic profile through pharmaceutical or chemical engineering to allow a longer exposure to unme-
tabolized RES could be an interesting way to optimize the in vivo activity.
As presented earlier, a major advantage of RES resides in its well-established low toxicity, as it is a food sup-
plement in many countries. This should facilitate the implementation of clinical trials aiming at confirming its 
effect on lung carcinogenesis. For example, intranasal administration of a RES-carboxymethyl-β
-glucan solution 
was tested in children with allergic rhinitis thrice daily during two month without adverse events33. A quick 
implementation of lung cancer chemoprevention clinical trials seems therefore possible, and should ideally be 
led on both current and ex-smokers. Indeed, the apparent carcinogen-independent apoptosis induction in cancer 
cells observed in the present study tends to support RES use in ex-smokers that are no longer exposed to smoke 
carcinogens, while the described NF-κ
B and cytochrome inhibitory properties supports its use in current smok-
ers. For ex-smokers, one could easily imagine a nebulizer similar to those used for beta-2-sympathomimetic

administration in asthma, as HPCD solutions were shown able to undergo aerosolization with droplet size com-
patible with lung deposition34. While the same device could be used in current smokers, an interesting alternative 
option could be the administration of RES through electronic cigarette smoking, RES being highly soluble (94 g/l) 
in propylene glycol35, the main constituent of electronic cigarette fluid. A RES containing electronic cigarette 
could combine the advantage of pharmacological cancer chemopreventive activity with promotion of the transi-
tion from conventional tobacco products to electronic cigarettes, potentially safer, although this point remains to 
be consistently clinically established36.
Methods
Chemicals and reagents. 
Hydroxypropyl-β
-cyclodextrin was kindly provided by Roquette Frères (Lestrem, 
France). RES (3,5,4′
-trihydroxystilbene) was purchased from APIChem Technology (Hangzhou, China). NNK 
was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Mouse anti-γ
-H2AX (Ser139) antibody 
and FluorSave reagent were purchased from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Rabbit anti-p65 antibody, 
Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, HRP-linked anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were pur-
chased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-
mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA). Normal goat serum was 
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Histo-clear was purchased from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA, 
USA). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Louis, MO, USA), and used without further 
purification.
Formulation. 
A 24 mg/ml (105 mM) RES solution was prepared in a sterile 200 mM hydroxypropyl-β
- 
cyclodextrin (HPCD) saline solution (0.9% NaCl) as described elsewhere23. In order to facilitate RES inclusion in 
cyclodextrin, RES powder was added to the HPCD solution, vortexed for 5 min at maximal settings, sonicated for 
1 h in an ice bath, and finally vortexed at 1200 rpm for 24 h at room temperature. All experimental steps involving 
RES were protected from light. The formulation was kept at −
20 °C and prepared freshly every week.
Animals. 
Animals were treated in accordance with the Swiss federal law on the protection of animals with a 
protocol approved by the Canton of Geneva (Direction Générale de la Santé, authorization number GE/169/14). 
A total of 56 female A/J mice of 5–6 weeks old were obtained from Envigo (Huntingdon, UK), randomized upon 
arrival and kept in the conventional animal facility of the School of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of 
Geneva.
Pharmacokinetic study. 
A total of 12 mice were randomized into 4 different groups. Each isoflurane- 
anesthetized mouse of each group received 50 μ
l of a 24 mg/ml RES solution (1.2 mg/mouse, ~60 mg/kg) through 
intranasal instillation as described elsewhere37. Mice from groups 1–4 were sacrificed after 5, 15, 30, or 60 min, 
respectively. Blood was collected upon sacrifice and lungs were harvested. Samples were snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and kept at −
80 °C until sample preparation for UHPLC-UV analysis. To extract RES from the lung 
tissue, samples were put in liquid nitrogen, grinded in a nitrogen-cooled mortar to obtain a fine powder, and 
weighed. Then, the powder was mixed in an Eppendorf tube with 1 ml of extraction solution (80% methanol, 
17.5% distilled water, 2.5% acetic acid) supplemented with 15 μ
l of a 15% ascorbic acid solution. The mixture was 
vortexed for 3 min at maximum settings and centrifuged for 15 min at 17 000 g at 4 °C to recover the supernatant. 
This solid-liquid extraction was repeated three times, and the total supernatant was evaporated under nitrogen 
flux. The extract was then solubilized in 400 μ
l of a methanol/water 1:1 solution and analyzed by UHPLC-UV. To 
extract RES from blood samples, 250 μ
l of blood were acidified with 7.5 μ
l acetic acid and mixed with 1.25 ml ethyl 
acetate. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min at maximal settings and centrifuged for 15 min at 17 000 g at 4 °C. The

supernatant was recovered and evaporated under nitrogen. The extract was solubilized in 100 μ
l of methanol and 
analyzed by UHPLC-UV. RES quantifications were performed using an Acquity UPLC System (Waters, Milford, 
MA, USA) equipped with an Acquity PDA detector for both lung and blood samples. Samples were injected 
(3 μ
l) into a C18 Kinetex column (50 mm ×
 2.1 mm, 2.6 μ
m, Phenomenex) and eluted (0.5 ml/min, 30 °C) with a 
mixture of MeOH and H2O both containing 0.1% formic acid. A gradient of 10 to 98% MeOH in 3 min was used, 
followed by a washing step with 98% MeOH for 1 min 50 s. After the washing step, the column was equilibrated 
with 10% MeOH during 1 min 50 s before the next injection. PDA absorption spectra were recorded between 210 
and 490 nm (1.2 nm steps). RES was identified by comparing its retention time (1.67 min) and UV spectra (max-
imum absorbance at 306 nm) using a standard. Seven RES solutions of concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 25 µg/
ml, prepared in both lung and blood matrixes, were analyzed to build calibration curves. Integration of the peak 
corresponding to RES provided the area under the curve value that was used for quantification. Linearity of the 
calibration curves was confirmed by their R2 of 0.997 and 0.999, respectively.
Lung cancer chemoprevention study. 
NNK was used to induce lung carcinogenesis in A/J mice. A total 
of 44 mice were randomized into 4 groups, receiving the following treatments: no NNK/no RES (group 1, 8 mice), 
NNK/no RES (group 2, 14 mice), NNK/RES (group 3, 14 mice), no NNK/RES (group 4, 8 mice). An intraperi-
toneal injection of either 50 mg/kg of NNK (groups 2 and 3) or saline solution (groups 1 and 4) was adminis-
tered once on weeks 1 and 2. Mice received either 1.2 mg RES (groups 3 and 4) or vehicle control (groups 1 and 
2) through intranasal instillation (50 μ
l) three times a week starting one week before the first NNK (or saline) 
injection, and for 26 weeks. At the end of the study, mice were sacrificed, and blood and lungs were harvested 
for further analysis. Lungs were fixed in 10% formalin, while plasma was separated from whole blood and stored 
at −
80 °C. The lung tumours present at the surface were counted and measured under a dissecting microscope.

Histology and p65 immunohistochemistry. 
The lungs of one mouse from groups 2 and 3 were 
paraffin-embedded and tissue sections were prepared. A section of the lung of each mouse containing several 
tumours was stained with hematoxylin and eosin for tumour characterization38. For p65 immunodetection, a 
slice of the lung of each mouse was deparaffinized in Histo-clear and antigen retrieved by incubating the slides 
in 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 at 98 °C for 20 min. Slides were then cooled on the bench for 30 min, washed twice with 
PBS for 3 min, and incubated for 5 min with 200 μ
l of a 3% H2O2 solution to block endogenous peroxidase. After 
washing with PBS, the slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the blocking solution (0.1% TBST 
with 5% normal goat serum), followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with rabbit mon-
oclonal anti-p65 antibody (1:100 in blocking solution). Slides were then rinsed three times for 5 min with TBST, 
incubated with the fluorescent anti-rabbit antibody (1:100 in blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature in the 
dark, counterstained with 0.1 µg/ml DAPI and mounted using 1–2 drops of FluorSave reagent. Fluorescent images 
were taken on a Nikon A1r spectral confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan).
Cell culture. 
A549 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Kaighn’s modification of Ham’s F-12 
(F-12K) medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/ml 
streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Nuaillé, France), at 37 °C in a 
5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were authenticated by ATCC using short tandem repeat analysis in 2007. The cells 
have been passaged in the user’s laboratory for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation. Absence of mycoplasma 
contamination was assessed regularly using a MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).

A549 cells were seeded in clear bottom black 96-well plates (Corning, 
Corning, NY, USA) (104 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then 
treated with either DMSO, 300 µM NNK, or 300 µM NNK + RES at increasing concentrations during 4 h at 37 °C. 
After incubation, cells were rinsed with DPBS (Thermo Fisher scientific) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 20 min. Fixed cells were then permeabilized for 5 min with a 0.1% Triton X-100 solution in DPBS (DPBST), 
blocked during 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumine in DPBST (blocking solution), and incubated overnight 
at 4 °C with the mouse monoclonal anti-γ
-H2AX antibody (1:400 in blocking solution). Cells were then washed 3 
times with DPBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with the FITC conjugated anti-mouse anti-
body (1:200 in blocking solution), and counterstained with 0.1 µg/ml DAPI for 1 min. Fluorescent pictures were 
taken on a Nikon A1r spectral confocal microscope and a Cytation 3 imaging multimode plate reader (Biotek, 
Winooski, VT, USA). Induction of γ
-H2AX was quantified in three independent experiments by measuring the 
fluorescence intensity of the secondary antibody in the nuclear zones defined by the DAPI staining, using the 
Gen5 3.0 software (Biotek).
Immunoblot analyses. 
A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (20 ×
 104 cells/well) and incubated over-
night at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then treated with either DMSO, 300 µM NNK, or 300 µM 
NNK + RES at increasing concentrations for 4 h at 37 °C, rinsed with 2 ml of PBS containing 2 mM sodium 
butyrate and scrapped in 500 µl of the same solution. Detached cells were centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min at 4 °C, 
and the supernatant was removed. An acidic extraction was performed to obtain cell lysates concentrated in 
histones. Cell pellets were mixed in 5-fold their volume of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 
10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT and 1.5 mM PMSF) and acidified with HCl (0.2 M final) to selectively solubilize basic

proteins such as histones. After 30 min incubation at 4 °C, the lysates were centrifuged at 11 000 g for 10 min 
at 4 °C. The supernatants containing the histones were collected and their protein content was quantified on a 
Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher scientific). Fifteen μ
g of proteins were loaded on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels 
and run for 1.5 h at 100 V. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for 
40 min at 20 V in a pH 10, MeOH free transfer buffer (5.82% tris-base, 2.93% glycine). Membranes were blocked 
for 1 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the mouse monoclonal 
anti-γ
-H2AX antibody (1:1000 in 1% non-fat milk). Membranes were then washed three times for 10 min with 
TBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the HRP-linked anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 in 1% non-fat 
milk), and revealed through chemiluminescent immunodetection with Pierce ECL western blotting substrate 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The experiment was repeated two times and similar results were obtained.
Apoptosis assay. 
Induction of apoptosis was determined using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher scientific). A549 
cells were seeded in 12-well plates (105 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells 
were then treated with DMSO, 300 µM NNK, RES at increasing concentrations with or without 300 µM NNK dur-
ing 48 h at 37 °C. All the cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and stained with 5 µl of annexin V-FITC and 
1 µl of PI (100 µg/ml) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Percentage of apoptotic cells was determined in 
three independent experiments by counting the number of annexin V-FITC positive cells using an Attune NxT 
flow cytometer and the dedicated Attune NxT software (Thermo Fisher scientific).
Statistical analyses. 
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Tumour multiplicity in all four groups were 
compared through a one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Size group comparison 
for groups 2 and 3 were carried out through two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test. 
Comparison of total tumour volume/mouse was carried out through unpaired t-test. Percentage of γ
-H2AX 
marked cells as well as apoptotic cells after the different treatments were compared using a one-way ANOVA 
followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. P-values ≤
 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 6.05.
