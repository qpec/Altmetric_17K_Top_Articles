background Quantifying relative harm caused by 
inhaling the aerosol emissions of vapourised nicotine 
products compared with smoking combustible tobacco is 
an important issue for public health.
Methods The cancer potencies of various nicotine-
delivering aerosols are modelled using published 
chemical analyses of emissions and their associated 
inhalation unit risks. Potencies are compared using 
a conversion procedure for expressing smoke and 
e-cigarette vapours in common units. Lifetime cancer 
risks are calculated from potencies using daily 
consumption estimates.
results The aerosols form a spectrum of cancer 
potencies spanning five orders of magnitude from 
uncontaminated air to tobacco smoke. E-cigarette 
emissions span most of this range with the 
preponderance of products having potencies<1% 
of tobacco smoke and falling within two orders of 
magnitude of a medicinal nicotine inhaler; however, 
a small minority have much higher potencies. These 
high-risk results tend to be associated with high 
levels of carbonyls generated when excessive power is 
delivered to the atomiser coil. Samples of a prototype 
heat-not-burn device have lower cancer potencies than 
tobacco smoke by at least one order of magnitude, 
but higher potencies than most e-cigarettes. Mean 
lifetime risks decline in the sequence: combustible 
cigarettes >> heat-not-burn >> e-cigarettes (normal 
power)≥nicotine inhaler.
conclusions Optimal combinations of device settings, 
liquid formulation and vaping behaviour normally result 
in e-cigarette emissions with much less carcinogenic 
potency than tobacco smoke, notwithstanding there are 
circumstances in which the cancer risks of e-cigarette 
emissions can escalate, sometimes substantially. These 
circumstances are usually avoidable when the causes are 
known.
IntroductIon
Opinion is divided about vapourised nicotine prod-
ucts (VNPs), such as e-cigarettes (ECs) which heat a 
nicotine-containing liquid and heat-not-burn (HnB) 
products which heat tobacco.1 2 The general public 
tends to view ‘vaping’ ECs as equally or more 
harmful than smoking tobacco.3 4 More scientific 
evidence addressing the factors that lead to harm 
and, where possible, quantification of their effects 
is needed to inform scientific debates and address 
public uncertainty.5
Both cigarette smoke and VNP emissions (or 
‘vapour’) are aerosol mixtures of particulates and 
droplets in gaseous matrices, but each is generated 
by a different process from different precursors 
within different temperature ranges. Nicotine is not 
a carcinogen but VNPs transfer a burden of known 
carcinogens in the aerosol. Assessing the relative 
harmfulness of different VNPs requires mean-
ingful indicators of harm. Common approaches 
include the analysis of biomarkers in bodily fluids, 
in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies, and evaluating 
the numbers of individual chemicals that exceed a 
specified threshold of safety.6–10 The health risks 
of smoking were established half a century ago by 
epidemiological evidence of associated morbidity 
and mortality but it may be several years before 
such approaches can definitively assess the harm 
of VNPs.11 Meanwhile, public health advice 
depends on quantitative chemical and toxicological 
approaches to model VNP risks.
This study aims to (1) derive a procedure that 
overcomes the problem of incompatible emissions 
data sets, (2) reduce the information on carcinogenic 
risk represented by multiple individual compounds 
to a single latent variable (potency) that reflects 
the cancer risk and (3) calculate cancer potencies 
from published emissions data and compare various 
nicotine product risks by factoring in exposure 
estimates.
Methodology
smoke and vapour emissions
Compounds from mainstream smoke analyses 
are typically reported in mass units (mg, µg, ng 
as appropriate) per cigarette. Fewer analyses of 
hazardous compounds in VNPs have been published 
and the units reported vary widely, usually as mass 
of compound per volume of vapour (often as µg per 
N puffs where N ranges from 1 to several hundred 
puffs of fixed volume). A few studies report mass 
units of toxicant/volume of precursor e-liquid but 
these are not included in this study.
Different machine smoking protocols purported 
to simulate human smoking add another compli-
cation. The ISO (International Organization for 
Standardisation) protocol draws 35 
mL per puff of 
smoke, whereas the Massachusetts Department of 
Public Health (MDPH) protocol draws 45 
mL and 
the Health Canada Intense (HCI) (intense) protocol 
draws 55 
mL (see online supplementary file).12 Only 
volume is considered here, not the withdrawal rate 
or interval between puffs. The ISO protocol leaves 
cigarette filter ventilation holes unblocked, whereas 
MDPH blocks 50% by taping over half the filter 
circumference, and HCI blocks these holes entirely.

vapourised nicotine products including e-cigarettes

Ventilation blocking reduces dilution by air and increases emis-
sions, thus smoking protocol and filter ventilation are funda-
mental considerations when comparing toxicant concentrations 
in tobacco smoke with vapour.13
smoke toxicants conversion
Taking N  to be the number of puffs in a smoking experiment, S 
the puff volume and D the filter ventilation (ie, fraction of air 
flow through filter vents), then
 
V∗
k,i = Nk,iSk(1 − Dk) 
(1)
where V∗
k,i represents the undiluted smoke volume and k is the 
machine smoking protocol for the ith sample (cigarette). For the 
ISO protocol S =35 
mL and D ranges from 0 to 1, for MDPH 
S =45 
mL and D is half the filter ventilation, and for the HCI 
protocol S =55 
mL and D =0.
The usefulness of the V* parameter is illustrated in online 
supplementary figure S1 in which nicotine concentrations 
from the various smoking machine experiments are plotted 
against V∗
k,i.14 The graph shows strong correlation between 
undiluted smoke volume V* and nicotine concentration per ciga-
rette (r2=0.93, p<0.01) with a linear regression intercept close 
to the origin. Similar co-linearity of  V* over the major carcino-
gens under consideration provides a means of expressing smoke 
carcinogens as concentrations in a form independent of machine 
smoking protocol.

where Ctob
k,i,j (µg/cigarette) is the mass per cigarette of the jth 
carcinogen in the ith product that has been machine-smoked 
using protocol k. Ek,i,j is the carcinogen concentration in units 
of µg/mL in undiluted smoke. This transformation expresses 
tobacco smoke toxicants as concentrations in the product, in 
common with ECs. Furthermore, the denominator V* is a good 
proxy for nicotine (see online supplementary figure S1). HnB 
emissions are treated in the same way as tobacco smoke. Toxi-
cants in EC vapours (Cvap
k,i,j), usually reported as mass/volume 
concentrations, only need conversion to µg/mL, as appropriate.
Aerosol cancer potency
Environmental protection agencies assess toxicological, epidemi-
ological and other data relevant to the long-term risks of inhaling 
chemicals.15 Unit risk values for cancer have been published 
where data are deemed adequate.16 The inhalation unit risk (Uj) 
for the jth carcinogen is defined as the excess lifetime cancer risk 
from continuous inhalation exposure to 1 
µg of the carcinogen 
per m3 of air and is expressed in (µg/m3)−1.15
The cancer potency from the mixture of carcinogens in 
tobacco smoke may be estimated using an aggregate model that 
weights each inhalation unit risk by its concentration in undi-
luted smoke

is the cancer potency of smoke or vapour relative to average 
tobacco smoke and is the dimensionless parameter used to 
discuss relative potency below.
Modelling exposure and risk
Metrics of exposure that reflect human use patterns are needed 
to translate potencies into risk estimates for each nicotine 
product.17 Studies of smoking usually report the number of 
cigarettes per day. Analogous reports of EC vaping topographies 
include estimates of vapour volume inhaled per day. Vaping is 
associated with greater volumes than tobacco smoking, possibly 
resulting in greater relative risks than implicit in the potency 
spectrum.17
The lifetime cancer risk (Ltob
i
) for the ith cigarette based on 
daily smoke exposure (assuming HCI conditions) takes into 
account the mean daily cigarettes in stick units (d) and the daily 
breathing rate of air (b), typically 20

The mean daily number of cigarettes smoked was 13 in 22 
countries during 2008–2014.18 In 2016, the average daily 
consumption in the UK was 12 cigarettes, whereas in the USA in 
2015 the comparable figure was 14.19 20 For this study, cigarettes 
per day were rounded to 15, reflecting the low daily smoking in 
these countries. The same number is applied to HnB modelling, 
consistent with exposure studies in Japan (average 10 sticks/day) 
and Poland (average 17).21 22
The average daily volume of EC vapour inhaled (¯
Vvap
day) has 
been reported as 29.7 
L/day based on measurements using 22 
subjects over a 24-hour period, but this result is associated with 
considerable variability (SD 29.6).23 A daily volume of 30 
L is 
used here for risk modelling while recognising the large uncer-
tainty involved. It has also been estimated that about four times 
greater volume of vapour is inhaled than tobacco smoke and this 
is broadly consistent with the adopted values.24 This volume falls 
within the range of daily nicotine inhaler use.25
Data sources
Eleven compounds commonly reported in tobacco smoke are 
classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) as human carcinogens (type 1) and a further seven as 
possible human carcinogens (type 2B). The inhalation unit risks 
for 14 of these carcinogens were obtained from the Office of 
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment database (OEHHA, 
California, USA) supplemented with a recommended value for 
the carcinogenic nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyr-
idyl)-1-butanone (NNK) (table 1).26
Concentrations of several major carcinogens in cigarette 
smoke and in VNP vapour were obtained from studies of ciga-
rettes,14 27 28 a prototype HnB device29 and EC products, ranging 
from early-generation disposables through second-generation 
clearomisers and cartomisers to third-generation mods and 
tanks.7 30–37 EC coil resistance and battery voltage were collated 
where reported. This compilation has many gaps where some 
carcinogens were not analysed. After removing duplicates across 
studies and omitting non-steady-state emissions (where stated),

the resulting data set contained 93 analyses divided into three 
subsets.34 The Goniewicz subset is the benchmark with 12 EC 
samples analysed for seven carcinogens including carbonyls, 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrosamines and metals.7 
The remaining 81 analyses include concentrations for some 
organic compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and occasion-
ally VOCs) and thus yield minimum estimates of potency, of 
which 32 involved coil heating experiments applying multiple 
powers to the same liquid in the same device (variable power 
subset). The remainder (n=48) are termed the organics-only 
subset.
Carcinogen emissions from an unheated nicotine inhaler 
represent a device accepted for medical use.7 Ambient air 
is represented by a suite of analyses that establish a relatively 
uncontaminated reference baseline for studies of smoke and 
vapour exposure.38
results
distribution of cancer potencies
Cancer potencies were computed for the data sets using equa-
tions 3 and 4 following conversion into compatible units of 
concentrations (equations 1 and 2) and matched with unit 
risks for cancer. The calculation sequence is summarised in 
online supplementary table S1. Average concentrations, unit risks 
and cancer potencies for various nicotine products are given in 
table 1, and the potencies of individual samples are graphically 
presented in figure 1. All results are normalised to the average 
value for tobacco smoke and plotting the results on a logarithmic 
axis creates a relative cancer potency spectrum for the various 
nicotine-bearing aerosols.
Smoke collected under the ISO protocol and converted to 
undiluted smoke volume V* has essentially the same potency as 
that collected under HCI (figure 1). Without factoring for filter 
ventilation, the ISO samples would be widely dispersed ranging 
down to much lower apparent cancer potencies for the most 
ventilated brands. HCI and ISO tobacco smoke have the same 
distributions after applying the V* conversion (figure 1) which 
indicates that raw undiluted tobacco smoke occupies a narrow 
band on the potency spectrum regardless of protocol and defines 
the upper boundary of cancer potencies among common nico-
tine products in high-income countries.
Ambient air, essentially a non-hazardous aerosol, defines the 
lower end of the cancer potency spectrum, clustering around a 
carcinogenic potency of slightly less than 10-5 that of tobacco 
smoke. The potency of the nicotine inhaler is about 10−4 that of 
tobacco smoke (figure 1), with metals contributing >70% of its 
carcinogenic potency.
The cancer potencies of EC are more difficult to define and 
are highly dispersed compared with cigarettes. The Goniewicz 
subset, which analyses the majority of anticipated carcino-
gens in EC vapour, clusters around ~10−3 of the potency of 
tobacco smoke (figure 1). The preponderance of potencies 
in the organics-only and variable power subsets also falls in 
this range, although higher levels of carbonyls found in these 
two subsets extend the range as far as the potency of tobacco 
smoke.

The cancer potencies of the HnB prototype device that heated 
various tobacco blends lie between one and two orders of magni-
tude less than tobacco smoke but higher than the preponderance 
of EC emissions (figure 1).
lifetime cancer risk
Equations 6 and 7 estimate the lifetime cancer risks from daily 
exposure (table 1). The values for ECs in this table are based on 
a compilation of first-generation and second-generation devices 
because most third-generation tanks and mods were used for 
variable voltage experiments. The average for EC includes the 
Goniewicz subset supplemented by carbonyl analyses from those 
members of the organic-only subset for which the device gener-
ation could be identified. The potency ratio relative to tobacco 
smoke for the average of these ECs is 1.8×10–3 while HnB had 
an order of magnitude higher relative potency at 2.1×10−2. The 
excess cancer risk for a lifetime of smoking 15 cigarettes a day 
is 2.4×10−2, 5.7×10−4 for inhaling 15 HnB sticks, 9.5×10–5 
for vaping 30 
L from ECs at normal power and 8.9×10–6 for 
inhaling 30 
L from the nicotine inhaler (table 1). Compared with 
a nicotine inhaler, the relative risks are 11 for EC, 64 for HnB 
and ~2700 for cigarettes, whereas compared with cigarettes the 
relative risks are 0.024 for HnB, 0.004 for EC and 0.0004 for 
the nicotine inhaler (table 1).
ranking carcinogens
The highest-ranking carcinogens in table 1 for cigarettes are 
1,3-butadiene and acrylonitrile, accounting for more than 
three-quarters of the cancer potency, whereas for HnB, acet-
aldehyde is the dominant carcinogen, which, along with 
1,3-butadiene, accounts for almost three-quarters of the aero-
sol’s potency. For ECs, only the Goniewicz subset includes 
nitrosamines and metals as well as carbonyls and VOCs. The 
highest ranked carcinogens in this subset are cadmium and 
formaldehyde. Even very small levels of cadmium can have 
a major effect given its extremely high unit risk (table 1) but 
cadmium is not detected in all samples and in others it is 
present in concentrations very close to blank level.7 Formalde-
hyde and acetaldehyde account for >95% of the contributions 
of organic compounds to cancer potencies in this EC subset.
role of carbonyls in the cancer potency of ec vapour
Given the importance of the carbonyls as carcinogens in EC 
vapour, the relationship between battery voltage and carbonyl 
generation is explored further in figure 2. Several studies 
have addressed this issue by measuring carbonyl concentra-
tions under various experimental conditions.31 32 34 37 39 These 
were omitted from the modelling of potency and risk of 
table 1 because they often involve applying voltages beyond 
the normal range of use. This figure shows that the partial 
cancer potencies attributable to both formaldehyde and acet-
aldehyde are highly variable. The Goniewicz subset and some 
other samples from both of the other subsets represent the 
lower range of potencies attributable to carbonyls. Other data 
indicate considerably higher potencies due to both carbo-
nyls, sometimes approaching and, for formaldehyde, even 
exceeding the partial potencies of carbonyls in tobacco smoke 
(figure 2). Most of the high-potency data points in figure 2 
were from studies investigating carbonyl formation by varying 
the atomiser coil heat within the same device while varying the 
power (watts) at the fluid–coil interface. Solid lines in figure 2 
connect the various powers achieved in the same experiment 
with the direction of increasing power indicated by an arrow. 
The highest cancer potencies are commonly associated with 
coils subjected to the highest applied voltages in any partic-
ular experiment; however, there is no consistent relationship 
between devices for carbonyl potency and the rate of heat 
energy transfer (watts) at the coil. It has been suggested that 
such high-power operating conditions produce ‘dry puffs’, 
that is, when the supply of e-liquid to the heating coil is inad-
equate producing an aerosol which is unpleasant to inhale 
although an exclusive causal relationship between dry puffs 
and high aldehyde concentrations has been questioned.40 41
dIscussIon
strengths and limitations of emissions modelling
The accuracy of emissions modelling can be evaluated by 
comparing the lifetime risk model for tobacco smoking with 
epidemiological data for smoking-related mortality. An early 
application of this model to tobacco smoke predicted an excess 
risk of 1.6×10−2 for a daily consumption of 20 cigarettes 
measured with the ISO protocol.26 This differed from the esti-
mated excess cancer risk of 7.9×10−2 derived from mortality 
data for smokers in the USA in 1995.14 Applying the same model 
to the Centers for Disease Control tobacco smoke data set

3 and 4 and normalised to average tobacco smoke with cancer risk

literature. In all, emissions from 14 peer-reviewed studies are

measured with the HCI protocol weighted by current OEHHA 
unit risk values doubles the estimated risk to 3.3×10−2 averaged 
over 48 cigarette products (SD 3.5×10−3) for the same daily 
consumption rate. This closer agreement is largely due to the use 
of the HCI machine smoking protocol for emissions, suggesting 
that these independent estimates reflect the same fundamental 
causes of mortality.
Using emissions can underestimate and overestimate risk. 
Aggregation of risks for individual carcinogens assumes that 
each inhaled carcinogen is wholly absorbed and no account is 
taken of differential mechanisms and rates of clearance. Unit 
risks are upper bound toxicological estimates that may overes-
timate true potency.42 If large volumes of carbonyls are gener-
ated by EC use under circumstances not normally tolerated 
by humans (eg, ‘dry puffs’), then the apparent high-risk levels 
may not be reached.40
A simple aggregation does not account for enhancement by 
synergystic interactions between components (but there may 
also be antagonistic interactions). A few synergystic effects are 
well known, often between tobacco smoke and particles such 
as asbestos and silica, but these are largely restricted to indus-
trial exposure (although silica particles have been recognised in 
EC vapour).43 44 Unit risk values are not available for all known 
carcinogens and are thus not involved in the aggregation leading 
to underestimation. Furthermore, only carcinogens formally clas-
sified by the IARC are included. Although cigarette smoke has 
been thoroughly investigated for toxicants over several decades, 
EC have not received the same level of scrutiny and some carcin-
ogens are possibly yet to be identified, although these ‘missing 
carcinogens’ would need to be present in high concentrations 
and/or have high unit risks to make a noticeable difference to EC 
potency and risk. Other sources of uncertainties are differences 
in unit risks between environmental protection authorities, and 
the assumption that risk is linearly proportional to dose with no 
threshold.
Another limitation is the absence of carcinogen analyses in 
most published studies of EC vapours. Only the Goniewicz 
subset presents data for most of the relevant carcinogens, 
and these indicate very important roles for metals (especially 
cadmium) and formaldehyde. The importance of cadmium as 
a carcinogen in vapour needs further investigation as it has not 
been detected at hazardous levels in other studies of vapour.44–46 
Also missing from most studies are analyses of the nitrosamine 
carcinogens, notably NNK and N′-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 
although potencies calculated from the Goniewicz subset suggest 
these are minor contributors to the risk (table 1). Indeed missing 
data for carcinogens at low concentrations or with low unit risks 
may have little or no significant effect on modelled potency and 
risk. Note that particle size effects have not been taken into 
account in this or previous chemical studies of this type but are 
potentially significant.47 48
Figure 2 Relative cancer potencies of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in vapour from e-cigarettes compared with tobacco smoke, heat-not-burn 
devices, a nicotine inhaler and ambient air. Values are normalised to the mean potency of the same carcinogens in tobacco smoke. Data sources for 
e-cigarettes are identified with different symbols (see key for sources). The variable power subset includes all devices used in experiments to create 
vapour at more than one atomiser power (watts). Solid red lines connect the potencies of emissions for the same device run at different powers with 
arrows indicating the direction of increasing power. The lines show that the cancer potencies from the same device can vary by more than two orders 
of magnitude for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.

research paper
VNP and cigarette emissions have been compared in this study 
using carcinogen concentrations, whereas normalisation to unit 
nicotine levels is sometimes preferred as an estimate of human 
exposure.49 Nicotine has an unprotonated (free-base) and two 
protonated forms, unprotonated nicotine being of greatest 
concern in terms of blood transfer. The fraction of total nicotine 
in free-base form varies widely in both tobacco smoke and EC 
vapour largely as a function of pH.50 51 Whether free-base nico-
tine could be a useful proxy for exposure in tobacco-based aero-
sols requires further research as does the relationship between 
the concentrations of the various nicotine forms and exposure to 
toxicants in EC emissions.
Biomarkers for 1,3-butadiene and acrylonitrile in urine 
samples from EC-only users indicate levels similar to nicotine 
replacement therapy users, in contrast to the high levels found 
in smokers.10 Biomarkers for the same compounds declined 
rapidly in smokers switching to ECs at rates similar to absti-
nence from smoking over 5 days.52 Neither compound is 
normally detectable in EC vapour yet both have been shown 
above to account collectively for more than three-quarters of 
the cancer potency of tobacco smoke.53 This close correlation 
between reduced emissions in EC vapours and their associ-
ated biomarkers for two of the most important carcinogens 
in tobacco smoke supports the use of emissions in estimating 
potency and risk.
carbonyl generation
The preponderance of EC analyses conducted at fixed or recom-
mended voltages indicates relatively low risks of exposure related 
to carbonyls (figure 2 and table 1), notwithstanding, additional 
carbonyl generation at higher powers has a major influence on 
cancer potency (figure 2). While factors such as the propylene 
glycol/glycerol balance and other e-liquid ingredients as well as 
puff number may influence aldehyde formation, overheating 
appears to dominate.34 54–56 Indeed, the connected arrows on 
figure 2 indicate that up to half the cancer potency range for 
ECs can be generated from the same liquid in a single device by 
varying only the power. This implies that the way a device is used 
might be more important than the device itself. The unpleasant 
sensory experience of a ‘dry puff’ may mean that these labora-
tory-derived data points are replicated less frequently in normal 
human exposure than implied by the machine smoking data 
presented in figure 2.40
heat-not-burn devices
Data from experiments on one HnB device indicate cancer 
potencies and risks lower than tobacco smoke by more than one 
order of magnitude greater than the preponderance of ECs oper-
ating under normal conditions (table 1). This finding is provi-
sional as it is based on a single prototype design from a single 
manufacturer.
caveats
Unit risk values (table 1) indicate a potentially major role for 
metals even at low concentrations. ECs are typically metallic 
devices, not least the atomiser which is normally a metallic coil 
usually made of nichrome (NiCr alloy) or kanthal (FeCrAl alloy). 
Other metallic components can include electrical conductors, 
crimps, connectors, solder, cartridges and structural features 
of the device, many of which show some evidence of corrosion 
over time in prefilled devices. Several papers document elevated 
levels of metals in liquids and occasionally the aerosol but no 
consistency is yet evident in emissions.7 44 45 57 The lack of metals 
data for samples other than the Goniewicz subset means that 
some cancer potency values for ECs in this study may be under-
estimated. Even less is known about the speciation of metals in 
EC vapour despite the importance of different valence states 
and molecular speciation in tobacco smoke toxicity.58 59 More 
detailed study of metals, especially Ni, Cr and Pb and their 
speciation in a wider of range of products, may lead to new 
perspectives on the cancer potential of metals in EC vapours.
The presence of fine and nanosize particulates in EC vapour 
was recently demonstrated.48 Given the greater surface area 
and potential reactivity of nanoparticles, if their presence in 
VNP vapours is confirmed as substantial then safety estimates 
for these products may require re-evaluation, especially in rela-
tion to cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases including 
stroke.60
The cancer potency of secondhand vapour was not specifi-
cally addressed in this study. The few published experiments of 
secondhand vaping suggest low cancer potencies, although none 
appeared to involve products that emitted relatively high levels 
of carbonyls in the mainstream vapour.61 62
Implications for policy and practice
The data imply a considerable range of cancer risks. Many EC 
emissions have cancer potencies within an order of magnitude 
of a nicotine inhaler, a product generally regarded as safe. 
Notwithstanding, some EC emissions tended towards much 
higher cancer potencies and risks, a few possibly approaching 
those of tobacco smoke. Indeed, the cancer potency of formal-
dehyde, the most important EC carcinogen, can exceed that of 
tobacco smoke especially in the highest power settings of some 
multipower experiments but the full range of relative potency 
spans nearly four orders of magnitude with the vast majority 
of potencies being much lower than combustible cigarettes. It 
is likely that third-fourth-generation EC devices with adjustable 
coil power are implicated in these higher risks. With regard to 
involuntary exposure, better understanding of potential effects 
of secondhand EC exposure is needed to determine if their use 
in indoor public spaces should be banned, as is currently the case 
in 25 countries.63
The conclusions of this study refer only to the chemical risks 
of cancer and do not account for any other carcinogenic effects 
such as those attributable to small particle sizes. There is some 
evidence that the large differentials found here between the 
cancer potencies of most ECs and those of tobacco smoke may 
be less for other medical conditions involving the cardiovascular 
and respiratory systems.37 Future research should address these 
gaps.
The cancer potency calculation for VNPs was applied to a 
range of devices covering different generations purchased in 
different countries but no claim is made that these samples are 
representative of all products in the current marketplace. As 
the VNP market continues to expand and diversify, a better 
understanding of the origins and aerosol transfer of carbonyls 
and metals is required to achieve EC emissions with consis-
tently low carcinogenic potency. Such understanding may 
prompt calls for constraints on device design and e-liquid 
formulations but it is likely that significant reduction in cancer 
risk could also be achieved by effective advice to EC users on 
generic aspects of devices, coil selection and refill liquids as 
well as vaping behaviour and product manipulation.

What this paper adds
 
► Emissions from vapourised nicotine products (VNP) including 
e-cigarettes contain carcinogens but generally in lower 
concentrations than tobacco smoke.
 
► Each carcinogen contributes quantifiably to the overall 
cancer potency and risk.
 
► Users and policymakers need quantitative evidence on the 
relative risks of cancer from the use of VNPs compared with 
smoking tobacco.
 
► Previous studies considered the individual carcinogens in 
an emission; here a method is developed that models the 
aggregate cancer potencies of all measured carcinogens and 
overcomes incompatibilities in data reporting conventions 
enabling direct comparison of the potencies and risks of 
tobacco smoke with VNP emissions.
 
► Cancer potencies span five orders of magnitude creating a 
spectrum ranging from uncontaminated air through VNPs to 
tobacco smoke.
 
► Most e-cigarette analyses indicate cancer potencies <1% 
that of tobacco smoke and <10% that of a heat-not-burn 
prototype, although a minority of analyses indicate higher 
potencies.
 
► Highly carcinogenic emissions from e-cigarettes are 
avoidable, being due largely to user choice of device setting, 
liquid formulation and vaping behaviour, highlighting a need 
for increased user awareness and personal involvement in 
reducing risk.
