In March and October 2015, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) and CDC issued nationwide alerts 
identifying fentanyl, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl 
(IMF), as a threat to public health and safety (1,2). IMF is 
pharmacologically similar to pharmaceutical fentanyl (PF), but 
is unlawfully produced in clandestine laboratories, obtained via 
illicit drug markets, and includes fentanyl analogs. Fentanyl is a 
synthetic opioid 50–100 times more potent than morphine and 
approved for the management of surgical/postoperative pain, 
severe chronic pain, and breakthrough cancer pain.* DEA’s 
National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) 
collects drug identification results from drug cases analyzed by 
federal, state, and local forensic laboratories throughout the 
United States.† In 2014, 80% of fentanyl submissions (i.e., 
drug products obtained by law enforcement that tested positive 
for fentanyl) in NFLIS were identified from 10 states, including 
Florida and Ohio (2), and seven of these 10 states reported 
sharp increases in fentanyl-related overdose deaths (fentanyl 
deaths) (3). This report presents findings of increased fentanyl 
deaths during 2013–2015 from investigations conducted by 
the University of Florida and the Ohio Department of Public 
Health, in collaboration with CDC. Analyses examined the 
association between trends in fentanyl-related law enforce-
ment submissions and fentanyl deaths and describes groups 
at risk for fentanyl death using medical examiner and coroner 
reports. The marked increases in fentanyl death in Florida and 
Ohio during 2013–2015 were closely associated with parallel 
increases in fentanyl submissions, with the largest impact on 
persons who use heroin, consistent with reports that IMF is 
commonly mixed with or sold as heroin (1,4). In Ohio, cir-
cumstances associated with fentanyl deaths included a current 
diagnosed mental health disorder§ and recent release from an 
institution such as a jail, rehabilitation facility, or hospital.
Three different analyses are reported. The first analysis 
compared trends in fentanyl deaths, fentanyl submissions, 
and fentanyl prescribing during January 2013–June 2015, 
using 1) medical examiner and coroner reports in Florida and 
death certificates in Ohio, 2) NFLIS data in both states, and 
3) prescription drug monitoring program data (E-FORCSE 
in Florida¶ and OARRS in Ohio**) that track the prescrib-
ing and dispensing of controlled substances (schedules II, III, 
and IV drugs). Data on overdose deaths involving fentanyl 
analogs were also available for the first half of 2015 in Florida. 
The second analysis used medical examiner data to compare 
demographic and toxicologic characteristics of fentanyl deaths 
in Florida before (2010–2012) and during (2013–2014) the 
marked increase in fentanyl submissions. For the third analy-
sis, the Ohio Department of Health conducted an in-depth 
review of medical examiner and coroner reports of fentanyl 
deaths, including toxicology panel findings, medical history, 
drug abuse history, and overdose scene characteristics occur-
ring in 14 high-burden counties (Butler, Clark, Clermont, 
Cuyahoga, Fayette, Hamilton, Lucas, Miami, Montgomery, 
Ross, Scioto, Stark, Summit, and Warren) in 2014. These 
counties were selected based on a high number and/or rate of 
fentanyl deaths and geographic diversity (urban versus rural) 
and accounted for 73% of Ohio’s fentanyl deaths reported on 
death certificates during January–December 2014. Data from 
Ohio’s medical examiners and coroners were abstracted from 
the Ohio Violent Death Reporting System.
During 2013–2014, fentanyl submissions increased 494% 
in Florida (from 33 to 196) and 1,043% in Ohio (from 109 to 
1,246), concurrent with a 115% increase in fentanyl deaths in 
Florida (from 185 to 397) and a 526% increase in Ohio (from 
84 to 526) (Figure). In Florida, fentanyl submissions and fen-
tanyl deaths gradually increased during May–November 2014, 
with a sharp increase during December 2014–February 2015, 
before returning to levels consistent with July–November 2014 
during March–June 2015. Ohio’s fentanyl deaths and fentanyl 
submissions spiked during November 2013–March 2014, 
followed by a sharp decline in April–May 2014, and then a 
gradual and continuous rise during June 2014–May 2015. In 
contrast, fentanyl prescription rates for the full year increased 
only 5% in Florida (from 19.3 in 2013 to 20.3 in 2014 per 
1,000 population) and declined 7% in Ohio over the same 
period (from 21.6 to 20.1) (Figure).
Florida’s fentanyl death rates increased approximately 
250% among persons aged 14–34 years from 2010–2012

In Florida, from 2010–2012 to 2013–2014, the percentage 
of fentanyl deaths testing positive for other illicit substances 
increased significantly; in particular, fentanyl deaths testing 
positive for cocaine increased from 17% to 33%, and fentanyl 
deaths testing positive for heroin increased from 0% to 19%. 
This trend continued into the first half of 2015, with 55% 
of fentanyl decedents testing positive for heroin or cocaine 
compared with 42% during 2013–2014. The percentage 
of fentanyl deaths testing positive for morphine in Florida 
increased significantly from 2010–2012 (7%) to 2013–2014 
(28%) (Table 1). Finally, fentanyl analogs were implicated in 
49 fatal drug overdoses in Florida during January–June 2015,

naloxone. Although toxicologic panels cannot distinguish IMF 
from PF, the findings suggest that the surges in fentanyl deaths 
in Florida and Ohio during 2013–2015 were closely related to 
increases in the IMF supply, as opposed to diverted PF. This 
is supported by multiple factors including 1) the stability in 
prescribing and dispensing of PF in Florida and Ohio, even as 
fentanyl deaths sharply increased; 2) the implication of acetyl 
fentanyl and beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, both illicitly produced 
fentanyl analogs, in a significant number of fentanyl deaths 
in Florida; 3) recent DEA reports linking most U.S. fentanyl 
deaths to IMF (4); 4) demographic characteristics of fentanyl 
decedents in Ohio and changes in the demographic character-
istics of fentanyl decedents from 2010–2012 to 2013–2014 
in Florida were similar to heroin decedents nationally; and 
5) interviews with persons using illicit drugs in Ohio indicat-
ing that fentanyl appears to be mixed with or sold as heroin.†† 
DEA reports have noted that IMF is often mixed with heroin, 
and then sold as a heroin product on the illicit market (1,4). 
In Ohio and Florida, a substantial proportion of fentanyl dece-
dents tested positive for heroin (39% and 19%, respectively); 
it is likely that this represents an underascertainment, because 
heroin is quickly metabolized to morphine, thus morphine-
positive fentanyl deaths can indicate prescription morphine or 
metabolism of heroin (5).
The changing demographics of fentanyl decedents in Florida 
from 2010–2012 to 2013–2014 and the demographics of 
fentanyl decedents in Ohio in 2014 mirror the evolving demo-
graphics of persons who use heroin in the United States.§§ Risk 
profiles changed notably during the current epidemic, with 
fentanyl deaths in Florida increasing almost 2.5 times faster 
among men (163%) than women (68%), with the most rapidly 
increasing rate among persons aged 14–34 years. In contrast, 
U.S. death rates involving prescription opioids are highest 
among persons aged 45–54 years, a slightly older group than 
this cohort of fentanyl decedents (6). In addition, the demo-
graphic of fentanyl decedents in Ohio closely matched those 
of heroin overdose decedents, but diverged from prescription 
opioid overdose decedents.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, since toxicologic panels cannot distinguish between 
PF and IMF, this study does not provide precise counts of over-
doses involving IMF compared with PF. Second, the numbers 
and rates of fentanyl deaths are underestimated because not all 
overdose deaths were tested for fentanyl and testing for fen-
tanyl analogs is not systematic statewide in either state. Third, 
NFLIS data might vary over time and geography because of 
differences or changes in law enforcement testing practices

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Agency and CDC issued nation-
wide alerts identifying increases in fentanyl-related overdose 
deaths (fentanyl deaths) in multiple states. Although prescrip-
tion fentanyl can be diverted for misuse, most fentanyl over-
doses and deaths have been linked to illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl (IMF), including fentanyl analogs. Multiple states that 
experienced increases in law enforcement submissions to labo-
ratories of drug products that tested positive for fentanyl during 
2013–2014 also reported sharp increases in fentanyl deaths.
What is added by this report?
Analyses of 2013–2015 data from Florida and Ohio indicated that 
sharp increases in fentanyl deaths were associated with signifi-
cant increases in the supply of IMF in these states, with fentanyl 
analogs detected in the Florida illicit market. Novel circumstances 
surrounding fentanyl mortality included current diagnosed men-
tal health disorder and release from an institutional facility (e.g., 
a jail, treatment facility, or hospital) within the preceding 30 days. 
The risk profiles of fentanyl overdose decedents were similar to 
those of persons dying from heroin overdose.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The rapid increases in fentanyl deaths in Florida and Ohio 
illustrate the need to intensify efforts to expand use of nalox-
one. Increased naloxone access, particularly among community 
members, is critical given fentanyl’s potency and the possibil-
ity of causing rapid death. The relationship between fentanyl 
deaths and increases in the supply of IMF suggests that law 
enforcement testing data on drug cases could serve as an early 
warning system to detect variations in overdose risk related 
to changes in the drug supply. Multidisciplinary strategies 
from public health agencies, harm reduction communities, 
emergency medical services, law enforcement, and treatment 
services for substance use disorders might have the greatest 
impact on public health, given the close relationship between 
fentanyl mortality and confiscation of IMF.
and enforcement activity. Fourth, part of this investigation 
was limited to abstraction of information collected during 
the medical examiner and coroner death investigation, and 
information collected might vary among counties within both 
states. Finally, analysis of medical examiner and coroner records 
was limited to high-burden counties in Ohio, and findings 
might not be generalizable to the entire state.
The rapid increase in fentanyl deaths indicates the need for 
timely surveillance and response. The relationship between 
fentanyl deaths and fentanyl submissions in both Florida and 
Ohio suggests that fentanyl submissions data could act as an 
early warning system to identify changes in the illicit drug 
supply. Distinguishing whether an overdose involves IMF 
or PF is critical for targeted interventions because overdose 
risk profiles differ. Additional work is needed to determine 
the extent to which medical examiners and coroners can use 
decedents’ substance use history, scene evidence (e.g., white 
powder consistent with IMF or patches consistent with PF), 
toxicology (e.g., presence of heroin or cocaine), and prescrip-
tion drug monitoring program data to distinguish IMF from 
PF overdoses. Similar to national NFLIS data, Florida began 
detecting increases in fentanyl analog submissions in 2015. 
Because the lethality of fentanyl analogs vary, increased testing 
for analogs in areas experiencing large numbers of fentanyl 
deaths or increases in overdose deaths might be needed.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has 
launched an initiative to reduce opioid misuse and overdose 
by expanding medication-assisted treatment, increasing the 
availability and use of naloxone, and promoting safer opi-
oid prescribing.¶¶ Past misuse of prescription opioids is the 
strongest risk factor for heroin initiation and use, particularly 
among persons who report past-year dependence or abuse (7).
The rapid increase in fentanyl deaths in Florida and Ohio 
illustrates the high potency of fentanyl, with the possibility 
of rapid death (8), highlighting the importance of quickly 
recognizing an overdose, calling 9-1-1 promptly, facilitating 
rapid administration of ≥1 naloxone doses, and the need to 
expand naloxone availability. The presence of bystanders in 
Ohio suggests the opportunity to improve overdose response 
including increasing support for community naloxone distribu-
tion programs. In Ohio, naloxone was administered in four of 
10 cases. Multiple doses of naloxone and/or emergency medi-
cal treatment might be needed to reverse a fentanyl overdose. 
Community members might want to have several naloxone 
doses available and should be instructed to call 9-1-1 imme-
diately, even when administering naloxone (2).***
Linkage and access to treatment and to naloxone are needed 
for persons at high risk. In Ohio, a significant percentage of 
fentanyl deaths involved persons recently released from an 
institution and persons with a current diagnosed mental health 
disorder, placing both groups at increased risk for overdose. 
Persons recently released from an institution are at particularly 
high risk for opioid overdose because of lowered opioid toler-
ance resulting from abstinence during residential treatment or 
incarceration (9). Interventions such as provision of naloxone 
and continuation of medication-assisted treatment after release 
have been shown to be effective for this group (10).
