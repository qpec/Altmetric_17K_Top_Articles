ABSTRACT
Bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most commonly used medications for osteoporosis. This ASBMR report provides guidance on BP
therapy duration with a risk-benefit perspective. Two trials provided evidence for long-term BP use. In the Fracture Intervention Trial
Long-term Extension (FLEX), postmenopausal women receiving alendronate for 10 years had fewer clinical vertebral fractures than
those switched to placebo after 5 years. In the HORIZON extension, women who received 6 annual infusions of zoledronic acid had
fewer morphometric vertebral fractures compared with those switched to placebo after 3 years. Low hip T-score, between –2 and
–2.5 in FLEX and below –2.5 in HORIZON extension, predicted a beneficial response to continued therapy. Hence, the Task Force
suggests that after 5 years of oral BP or 3 years of intravenous BP, reassessment of risk should be considered. In women at high risk,
for example, older women, those with a low hip T-score or high fracture risk score, those with previous major osteoporotic fracture, or
who fracture on therapy, continuation of treatment for up to 10 years (oral) or 6 years (intravenous), with periodic evaluation, should
be considered. The risk of atypical femoral fracture, but not osteonecrosis of the jaw, clearly increases with BP therapy duration, but
such rare events are outweighed by vertebral fracture risk reduction in high-risk patients. For women not at high fracture risk after 3
to 5 years of BP treatment, a drug holiday of 2 to 3 years can be considered. The suggested approach for long-term BP use is based on
limited evidence, only for vertebral fracture reduction, in mostly white postmenopausal women, and does not replace the need for
clinical judgment. It may be applicable to men and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, with some adaptations. It is
unlikely that future trials will provide data for formulating definitive recommendations. © 2015 American Society for Bone and

Introduction
A
fracture owing to osteoporosis occurs every 3 seconds
around the world, with the hallmark fractures at the spine
and hip leading to substantial mortality, morbidity, and huge
societal costs worldwide.(1,2) One in three older women and one
in five older men will experience a fragility fracture(2) after age
50 years. Solid evidence from randomized placebo-controlled
trials of 3 to 4 years’ duration supports the efficacy of amino-
bisphosphonates (BPs) in decreasing the risk of vertebral

 fractures (by 40% to 70%), hip fractures (by 20% to 50%), and
nonvertebral fractures (by 15% to 39%), depending on the drug,
skeletal site, and individual risk profile. These drugs have,
therefore, dominated the landscape of osteoporosis therapies
for the last two decades. They are approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) for the treatment of postmenopausal, glucocorticoid-
induced, and male osteoporosis. Between 2005 and 2009,
approximately 150 million prescriptions were dispensed in the
United States (US) for the oral BPs alendronate (ALN),
risedronate (RIS), or ibandronate (IBN), and 5.1 million patients
over the age of 55 years received a prescription for these drugs
in 2008.(3) Extension trials have suggested efficacy of prolonged
BP therapy in maintaining bone density for up to 10 years with
ALN,(4,5) 7 years with RIS,(6) and 6 years with zoledronic acid
(ZOL),(7) but evidence regarding fracture risk reduction with
prolonged therapy is less convincing.
However, less than a decade after the publication of the first
pivotal clinical trial with ALN in 1995, reports regarding serious
complications, potentially related to the cumulative intake of
such drugs, began to appear in the literature. The most alarming
to dentists and patients are osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), first
reported by dentists and oral surgeons in 2003, occurring much
more commonly in cancer patients receiving higher cumulative
doses of BPs than in patients with osteoporosis treated with
lower doses, and atypical femoral fractures (AFFs), first reported
in 2005. Many subsequent publications have appeared on both
conditions, including three major reports from American Society
for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Task Forces.(8–10)
Although ONJ was first described more than 160 years ago,
its association with the intake of BPs was new, and it was
observed to occur more commonly in the setting of cancer
treatment in which high doses of intravenous BPs are used. AFFs
can occur in patients not receiving any antifracture medications;
they account for about 1% of all femoral fractures(11,12) and
about 3% of all femoral shaft fractures.(13) The incidence of AFFs
seems to increase in patients taking long-term BPs for
osteoporosis. This led the FDA to request information from all
BP drug manufacturers regarding this potential safety signal and
to assess long-term efficacy.(14) On October 13, 2010, the FDA
reviewed all available data, including data summarized in the
ASBMR Task Force initial report on Atypical Subtrochanteric and
Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures,(10) and determined that new
“Warnings and Precautions” information regarding the risk of
AFFs should be added to the labels of all BP products approved
for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. In Septem-
ber 2011, the FDA held a hearing to review the long-term safety
and efficacy of BPs, and subsequently recommended that
physicians reassess the indication for continued BP therapy
beyond 3 to 5 years,(14,15) but noted that in high-risk patients,
drug discontinuation may not be advisable. Currently, all FDA
approvals of BPs for the treatment of osteoporosis contain the
following “Important Limitation of Use” statement: “The optimal
duration of use has not been determined. All patients on
BP therapy should have the need for continued therapy
re-evaluated on a periodic basis.”(16)
With additional reports, the association between BPs and AFFs
has become more compelling. In its second report on Atypical
Subtrochanteric and
Diaphyseal
Femoral Fractures,(9)
the
ASBMR Task Force revised the original case definition of AFFs,
summarized the updated relevant literature, and underscored
the significant association with BP use, although with differing
strengths and magnitude. Although the relative risk for BP use
varied widely (between 2- and 128-fold), the absolute risk was
consistently low, ranging between 3.2 to 50 cases/100,000
person-years, an estimate that appeared to double with
prolonged duration of BP use (>3 years, median duration 7
years), and seemed to decline with discontinuation. The
incidence of ONJ in patients with osteoporosis is estimated to
be between 1/10,000 and 1/100,000, and is only slightly higher
than the ONJ incidence
in the general
population.(8,17)
Collectively, however, these rare yet serious harmful events
have received wide coverage in the media and have resulted in
perceived risks by the public that may be out of proportion to
the absolute risks, leading patients to not fill or refill
prescriptions for these drugs. Such behavior is likely to result
in fractures that could have been prevented, given that patients
need to take at least 75% of doses in order to prevent
fractures.(18)
The persistent effect of BPs on bone, albeit with differing
temporal resolution upon discontinuation because of differen-
tial avidity to bone,(19) coupled with concerns regarding
perceived harms from such therapy, led to the concept of a
drug holiday. The drug holiday is designed to minimize side
effects and maximize benefits and is an approach that has been
successfully applied in other chronic disease states, such as
rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson’s disease.(20,21) Organizations
have provided guidance regarding the risks and benefit of BP
drug holidays in individuals who have received BPs for 3 to
5 years. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists
(AACE) guideline suggests a drug holiday after 4 to 5 years of BP
treatment in patients at moderate risk of fractures and after
10 years for high-risk patients, but the terms high and moderate
risk were not defined.(22) The National Osteoporosis Guideline
Group (NOGG) in the UK developed a care path algorithm that
suggests a drug holiday in individuals who have no history of
fracture, whose FRAX risk falls below the NOGG intervention
threshold, and whose hip bone mineral density (BMD) T-score is
above –2.5; in such patients, repeating FRAX with BMD in 1.5 to
3 years was recommended.(23)
In 2013, in response to increasing concerns about prolonged
BP therapy in osteoporosis patients, ASBMR leadership con-
vened a multidisciplinary international task force on Managing
Osteoporosis Patients after Long-Term Bisphosphonate Treat-
ment. Experts in osteoporosis management, epidemiology,
endocrinology, geriatrics, and drug surveillance were appointed
to the Task Force. A bone scientist not in the osteoporosis field
and an ethicist were also members of the Task Force. Task Force
members were vetted by the ASBMR Ethics Committee and
approved by the ASBMR Executive Committee.(24) Task Force
member conflicts of interest are listed in the Disclosures section.
Charges to the Task Force
The main charges were determined by the ASBMR Professional
Practice Committee, approved by Council, and subsequently
modified by Task Force members to follow complementary
themes and facilitate work amongst members. These were to:
�
Provide guidance on duration of BP therapy in patients with
postmenopausal osteoporosis, developing an algorithm
that incorporates risk assessment (efficacy).
�
Determine how potential harms may affect duration of
therapy (safety), with a risk/benefit perspective.
�
Discuss how the algorithm may apply to men and to
individuals with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

 Additional relevant points, namely risk factors for harms,
resolution of benefits and harms upon BP discontinuation,
monitoring on and off therapy, differential effects and costs of
BPs, and alternative therapies, were also to be reviewed. In light
of the limited evidence available, the task force developed a
suggested approach, rather than an algorithm. Case studies
were also included to illustrate the applicability of the suggested
approach to challenging clinical cases, where available evidence
falls short of providing strong guidance and recommendations,
and are discussed in Supplemental Appendix S1.
Details regarding the original and modified charges can be
found in Supplemental Appendix S2.
Materials and Methods
Methodology for the literature search
Three parallel systematic literature searches were implemented
on the following terms: randomized controlled trials with long-
term bisphosphonates, bisphosphonates and drug holidays, and
bisphosphonates and guidelines. The databases searched
included Ovid Medline, EmBASE, Cochrane, and PubMed. The
three searches were constructed, conducted with input and
oversight from an expert medical librarian, and implemented by
a research assistant at the American University of Beirut under
supervision of one of the Task Force co-chairs (GE-HF). A detailed
description of the search strategy and its yield is found in
Supplemental Appendix 3.
Task Force process
The Task Force met by multiple teleconferences and emails, in
addition to two face-to-face meetings. Two subgroups were
formed, one charged with assessing BP effectiveness over time
and the other BP safety. By consensus, the first subgroup
constructed a figure illustrating the essential findings and
recommendations of the Task Force. The second subgroup
addressed side effects of BP therapy, constructing a figure
relating the probability of serious adverse outcomes with
osteoporotic fracture risk and other serious life events. It also
reviewed risks of alternative therapies to BPs. The Task Force co-
chairs wrote the first and subsequent drafts of the manuscript
with input from all members, who provided sections to address
specific questions raised during the teleconferences. The figure
and text underwent multiple revisions based on e-mails and
discussions and were circulated to all Task Force members. The
entire Task Force unanimously approved the final report.
Evidence for Long-Term BP Treatment of
Osteoporosis Extension Studies Using BPs
Pivotal registration trials have unequivocally demonstrated the
antifracture efficacy of commonly used BPs, namely ALN, RIS,
ZOL, and IBN.(6,25–31) Fracture reduction for vertebral, non-
vertebral, and hip fractures has been established for the first
three, and hip fracture was a primary outcome only for the RIS
and ZOL trials.(26,30) The long-term efficacy of these BPs in
extension studies is primarily based on trials conducted in a
subset of trial participants and focused primarily on bone
density changes. In these studies, subjects were rerandomized
(after a 1- to 2-year period of open-label ALN in FLEX), and
fracture reduction was evaluated as an exploratory outcome. IBN
was not studied beyond 5 years,(32) and the extension study for
RIS had no placebo group and only included a small number of
subjects followed for up to 7 years (N ¼ 74).(6) Additional details
on currently used BPs are provided under the section below
entitled
“Differences
among
bisphosphonates.”
Therefore,
evidence supporting long-term BP therapy beyond 5 years is
derived from two randomized, double-blind discontinuation
trials conducted in the US and Europe, with ALN (FLEX study)
and ZOL (HORIZON extension study).
The FLEX study was an extension of the ALN Fracture
Intervention Trial (FIT), including both of its substudies, the
Vertebral Fracture Arm(25) and the Clinical Fracture Arm.(33) The
extension study randomized 1099 postmenopausal women who
had already received 4 to 5 years of oral ALN, 5 to 10 mg/d,
including up to 1 year open-label ALN (10 mg/d), to either
continue ALN 5 mg (n ¼ 321), 10 mg (n ¼ 322), or switch to
placebo (n ¼ 428),(4,34) (Supplemental Appendix S4A-McNabb
2013 Fig. 1 for study flow). All women also received 500 mg of
calcium and 250 IU of vitamin D3 daily.
At entry into the extension study, the mean age was 73
(�5.7) years, and more than 96% were white. The mean total hip
T-score was –1.9 and the mean femoral neck T-score was –2.2.
Importantly, women with a total hip BMD T-score <–3.5 or
whose total hip BMD was lower than at FIT baseline were
excluded from the extension. Sixty percent of women had a
history of clinical fracture after age 45 years, and one-third had
already suffered a vertebral fracture. The primary endpoint was
the change in femoral neck BMD; secondary measures were
BMD at other sites and bone turnover markers. Fracture
incidence was an exploratory objective, captured as adjudicated
vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, as done in FIT. Morpho-
metric vertebral fractures were ascertained through lateral
radiographs, obtained at entry and after 36 and 60 months of the
extension. A semiquantitative method was used, and mild
fractures (20% height loss) were included.
After an additional 5 years of follow-up, those who continued
on ALN (5 or 10 mg, N ¼ 662) had significantly less bone loss at
all skeletal sites (for example, femoral neck BMD change by dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was 0.46% in combined ALN
versus –1.48% in placebo, p < 0.001), and fewer clinical vertebral
fractures (RR ¼ 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.85)
compared with those who were switched to placebo, N ¼ 437(4)
(see Supplemental Appendix S4A, Black 2006, Table 3). However,
nonspine fracture risk was similar among those who continued
ALN for approximately 10 years compared with women who
received 5 years of ALN followed by 5 years of placebo
(RR ¼ 1.00, 95% CI 0.76–1.32), but the study did not have
adequate statistical power to detect differences in nonvertebral
fractures. There was no significant reduction in morphometric
vertebral fractures with continued therapy beyond 5 years
(RR ¼ 0.86, 95% CI 0.60–1.22).(4) (Supplemental Appendix S4A,
Black 2006, Table 3 provides details regarding number of
subjects and fractures in each arm, by fracture type). Further
analyses for risk stratification in the FLEX trial are discussed in the
section below entitled “Risk stratification from the alendronate
and zoledronic acid extension studies,” and illustrated in the rest
of Supplemental Appendix S4A.
In the HORIZON study extension, 1233 postmenopausal
women who had already received three annual iv infusions of
ZOL 5 mg were randomized to either continue yearly ZOL (Z6) for
an additional 3 years or switch to placebo (Z3P3) in a blinded
manner. All women received 1000 to 1500 mg of oral calcium and
400 to 1200 IU of vitamin D daily. The mean age was 75.5 (�5)

 years, more than 95% were from primarily Western populations,
and 5% were Asians. The subjects had a mean total femoral neck
T-score of –2.6 (�0.6); women over age 93 years or on other bone
active drugs were excluded. Approximately 60% of the women
had at least one prevalent vertebral fracture at entry into the
extension.(7)Theprimaryendpointwaspercentchangeinfemoral
neck BMD between the two arms; secondary endpoints included
BMD at other sites, fractures, bone turnover markers, and safety.
Clinical fractures were identified similarly to the core study, self-
reported with central adjudication. The incidence of morpho-
metric fractures was assessed by comparison of radiographs at
3 years and 6 years.(7)
Subjects randomized to the Z3P3 arm had significantly greater
femoralneckboneloss(–0.80versus0.24%;p ¼ 0.0009),andthose
in the Z6 arm had fewer morphometric spine fractures (RR ¼ 0.51,
95% CI 0.26–0.95; p ¼ 0.035(7) (Supplemental Appendix S4B, Black
JBMR 2012, Fig. 4). However, nonspine fracture risk did not differ
amongthosewhodidanddidnotcontinueZOL(RR¼ 0.99,95%CI
0.7–1.5), and the same applied to hip fractures. This may be
explained by low statistical power as shown in Supplemental
Appendix S4B, Black JBMR 2012,(7) where Fig. 4 provides details
regarding number of subjects and fractures in each arm, by
fracture type. Further analyses for risk stratification in this trial
extension are discussed in the section below entitled “Risk
stratification from the alendronate and zoledronic acid extension
studies,”andillustratedintherestofSupplementalAppendixS4B.
Differences Among Bisphosphonates
Persistence of beneficial effects of BPs
Elevated bone turnover markers (BTMs) have been associated
with low BMD and increased fracture risk in untreated
postmenopausal women.(35) In pivotal studies of BPs, a
significant
decrease
in
BTMs
has
been
demon-
strated.(25–28,31,33,36) Persistence of low BTMs may be a potential
indication of continued beneficial effects after discontinuation
of long-term BP use.(37) Withdrawal of BP treatment is associated
with decreases in BMD and increases in BTMs, changes that differ
among BPs. Based on these criteria, residual effects on BMD from
ALN persist for 2 to 3 years and possibly 1 to 2 years for IBN and
RIS.(4,37–39) In the case of 3 years of ZOL therapy, they extend for
at least another 3 years.(7) These findings are consistent with the
relative binding affinities of BPs for hydroxyapatite and human
bone tissue.(19,40–43)
Cost and convenience
Oral BPs are most frequently prescribed in part because of their
low cost and convenience, and the costs of ALN, RIS, and IBN
were found to be similar in a 2011 study.(44) Generic ALN, RIS,
and IBN are now available in many countries worldwide. The
availability of generic BPs may alter total health care costs. ZOL
may also be a cost-effective first-line option compared with
other branded BPs and, in some cases, even in comparison with
generic ALN; however, these comparisons are limited by a
paucity of compliance and persistence data, as well as by
incomplete country-specific data.(45) Generic ZOL became
available in the US in 2013 and in the UK in 2014, which may
also change previous cost-effective analyses. Cost and availabil-
ity of generic BPs vary among countries.
Adherence
Adherence to osteoporosis therapies is essential to treatment
efficacy, even with BPs, despite their long bone retention. Better
Fig. 1. Risks associated with bisphosphonate use and other health outcomes. The likelihood of suffering fractures and other adverse events in adults is
shown. For fractures, the risk of fractures on BP therapy and for stroke on aspirin therapy is illustrated. Fracture incidence rates are age-standardized,
whereas for others they represent crude rates in the US. For atypical femoral fracture, the risks represent those reported while on BP therapy for 5 and
10 years. For osteonecrosis of the jaw, a single risk estimate is reported because of the paucity of evidence for a duration effect.

MANAGING OSTEOPOROSIS PATIENTS ON LONG TERM BPs
19
 adherence to BP therapy is associated with larger increases in
BMD,(46) and—when exceeding 75%—with lower rates of
fracture.(18) A meta-analysis of 171,063 subjects followed for 1
to 2.5 years revealed a 46% increased fracture risk in
noncompliant subjects versus compliant ones.(47) However,
adherence is a major problem with currently available oral anti-
osteoporosis therapies, with less than 50% of those starting oral
BPs continuing them for more than 1 year. Major determinants
of adherence to oral BPs are comorbidities and health plan costs.
Reasons for discontinuation include side effects, concern about
side effects, poor understanding of benefits, inconvenience, and
use of multiple medications.(48–54) Persistence with intravenous
BPs is not far superior to oral drugs, including the once yearly
regimen. In a random sample of 5% of new users of IV ZOL in the
Medicare database (N ¼ 846), 30% did not receive a second
infusion.(55) Older age and receiving the infusion in a separate
outpatient infusion center as opposed to a physician office
predicted low adherence.(55) To date, evidence to establish
superiority of intravenous versus oral BP is scarce and limited to
short follow-up.(56) Patients with poorer adherence are expected
to experience fewer serious adverse events such as ONJ and AFF.
Adherence is an equally important consideration in patients
being switched from one osteoporosis therapy to another (see
below).
Risk Stratification From the Alendronate and
Zoledronic Acid Extension Studies
In an attempt to identify subgroups of subjects who may benefit
most from longer-term therapy, investigators from both
extension trials performed additional post hoc analyses.
Potential risk stratification by BMD and prevalent or
incident fractures
In the FLEX study, there was no significant effect of low BMD
(stratified into three categories), nor of prevalent fractures, on
the reduction in nonvertebral and clinical vertebral fracture with
continued ALN versus placebo (N ¼ 10 subgroup comparisons),
the only exception being a reduction in clinical vertebral
fractures in subjects with femoral neck T-score between -2 and
-2.5 (RR ¼ 0.22, 95% CI 0.05–0.74)(4) (Supplemental Appendix
S4A, Black 2006, Table 4). However, in these analyses, the
subgroups categorized by T-scores may have had prevalent
vertebral fractures. Similarly, those with prevalent fractures may
have had a wide range of BMD. Therefore, additional analyses
were conducted to evaluate the effect of continued ALN for
10 years in FLEX women with or without previous vertebral
fractures at entry into FLEX, stratified by BMD categories, on
morphometric and nonspine fractures.(5) Of a total of 12
subgroup analyses, the only significant finding was a reduction
in nonspine fractures in women who did not have vertebral
fractures and with femoral neck T-score �–2.5 at FLEX baseline,
who continued ALN for an additional 5 years compared with
women who were switched to placebo (RR ¼ 0.50; 95% CI 0.26–
0.96)(5) (see Supplemental Appendix S4A, Schwartz 2010,
Table 2). Finally, in the most recent post hoc analyses from
FLEX, both femoral neck and total hip T-scores, entered as
tertiles at study extension, predicted the occurrence of any
clinical fracture after ALN discontinuation in subjects random-
ized to placebo in extension, proportions increasing from less
than 10% to 30% from highest to lowest tertile(57) (Supplemental
Appendix S4A, Bauer 2014, Fig. 2). Similarly, age (as a continuous
variable) and hip BMD T-score (lowest versus other two tertiles),
at time of ALN discontinuation, predicted clinical vertebral
fractures during the subsequent 5 years(57) (Supplemental
Appendix S4A, Bauer JAMA Int Med 2014, Table 3).
In
the
HORIZON
extension,
additional
analyses
were
performed to identify predictors of fractures in subjects who
were randomized to placebo at 3 years.(58) By univariate analysis,
the incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in the Z3P3
group was predicted by femoral neck and total hip T-score
�–2.5(58) (Supplemental Appendix S4B, Cosman 2014, Fig. 1).
The odds ratio (OR) for femoral neck T-score �–2.5 was 3.3
(CI 1.4–8), for total hip T-score �–2.5, 4.0 (CI 1.8–8.9), and for
incident morphometric fractures during the core study, 4.8
(CI 1.4–16.8)(58) (Supplemental Appendix S4B, Cosman 2014,
Table 2). Similarly, the incidence of nonvertebral fractures was
predicted by total hip T-score as a continuous but not
categorical variable, prevalent vertebral fracture (hazard ratio
[HR] ¼ 3.0 [CI 1.4–6.3]), and incident nonvertebral fractures
during the core study (HR ¼ 2.5 [CI 1.2–5.3](58) (Supplemental
Appendix S4B, Cosman 2014, Table 3). Finally, neither age
�75 years, nor weight �60 kg, when entered as single
categorical variables, was predictive of new morphometric or
nonvertebral fractures in the Z3P3 subjects. The absolute risk of
morphometric vertebral fracture in subgroups defined by single
or combined risk factors is shown in Supplemental Appendix
S4B, Cosman 2014 Table 4.(58) The absolute risk of such fracture
remained low (3.1%) in women who only had one risk factor, eg,
only a femoral neck BMD T-score �–2.5.
In a second extension of the HORIZON trial, 190 women who
had received six prior annual infusions of ZOL were rerandom-
ized to three more infusions or three placebo infusions. There
was no significant difference in the rate of bone loss between
the women who received 9 years of ZOL compared with those
who received six annual infusions followed by 3 years of
placebo. There were few fractures during the second extension,
and there was no difference in fracture rates between the two
groups.(59)
In summary, the extension studies reveal that 10 years of
therapy with ALN and 6 years with ZOL prevented bone loss at
multiple skeletal sites and a reduction in vertebral fractures
compared with stopping ALN after 5 years or ZOL after 3 years.
Subjects who seemed to benefit most from long-term ALN or
ZOL therapy are those categorized as high risk, best captured by
a persistent low T-score at hip (�–2.5 in HORIZON for total hip or
femoral neck T-score and above –2.5 but �–2 for femoral neck in
FLEX), or incident fracture during the core study in HORIZON.
However, the benefit in terms of fracture reduction was not
entirely consistent across the two studies. Continued ALN
resulted in a lower risk of clinical vertebral fractures, whereas
ZOL resulted in a lower risk of morphometric vertebral fractures.
The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but possible factors
include different baseline characteristics at entry into the
extensions and in fracture incidence after treatment discontin-
uation. These data must be viewed with caution because of
potential selection bias, small sample sizes, low numbers of
fractures, the post hoc exploratory nature of many analyses, and
lack of correction for multiple comparisons.
Based on these findings, continued BP therapy beyond 3 years
with ZOL and beyond 5 years with ALN may be an option in high-
risk individuals, based on evidence for reductions in the risk of
vertebral fractures only. In lower-risk patients and in light of lack
of evidence for fracture reduction with long-term therapy,
discontinuation of treatment beyond 3 to 5 years, with
20

 monitoring, may be considered with periodic reassessment of
fracture risk.
Potential risk stratification by bone turnover markers
BTMs are affected by BP therapy and are potentially useful in
determining
fracture
risk
before
and
after
therapy
has
commenced. The 2010 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline stated
that BTMs may be used at baseline to identify patients with high
bone turnover and can be used to follow the response to
therapy, although this was supported only by Grade C level
evidence.(22) Recently, the International Osteoporosis Founda-
tion (IOF) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) recommended serum procolla-
gen type I N-terminal peptide (P1NP) to assess bone formation
and serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide (CTX) to assess
bone resorption.(60)
Although the IOF and IFCC recommended the use of specific
BTMs, it remains unclear how such BTMs should be used in
clinical practice. Clinical studies have suggested their use as a
primary fracture prediction tool, but many clinicians use BTMs to
monitor osteoporosis treatment. A post hoc analyses of the
Fracture Intervention Trial reported that greater reduction of
serum P1NP, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and
CTX in ALN-treated subjects was positively associated with fewer
vertebral fractures.(61) Similar data were reported with RIS when
reduction of markers was assessed by changes exceeding the
least significant change,(62) but not for ZOL when a discrete cut-
off above or below the lower limit of premenopausal age was
used.(63)
The bone turnover markers CTX, PINP, and BSAP, measured in
76 women who took part in the FLEX trial, did not predict bone
loss at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck over a 5-year
treatment-free period in women who discontinued ALN after a
mean of 5 years.(34) Similarly, a change in BSAP or urinary NTX/Cr
was not associated with fracture risk when measured 1 year after
drug discontinuation in 437 study subjects.(57) Fasting serum
PINP, measured in 1140 women at entry in the HORIZON
extension, was not a predictor of morphometric or nonvertebral
fractures in the Z3P3 group.(58) BTM changes reported in large
groups of patients may not be observed in individuals because
of the variability in BTM tests.
At this time, based on the limited evidence from FLEX and
HORIZON extension studies, there is no evidence to support the
measurement of BTMs to assess fracture risk after long-term BP
use or in offset periods. However, some experts use BTMs to
determine whether a discontinued BP is still exerting its effects
and resume therapy when they exceed the lower half of the
Fig. 2. Approach to the management of postmenopausal women on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. (1) From the registration trials, the benefits of
5 years of therapy clearly outweigh the risks. For treatment up to 10 years with oral bisphosphonates (FLEX extension) and 6 years with intravenous
bisphosphonates (HORIZON extension), estimates of benefits and risks are based on much weaker data. For patients who fracture on therapy, assess
adherence and rule out secondary causes of osteoporosis. Management of high risk patients is discussed in the text. (2) The benefits of switching to an
alternative anti-fracture therapy after prolonged bisphosphonate treatment have not been adequately studied. (3) Based on FLEX and Horizon extension
study (Caucasian women), may not applyto other populations. (4) High fracture risk: defined by older age(70–75 years),other strong risk factors for fracture,
or FRAX fracture risk score that is above country specific thresholds. The use of FRAX in patients on therapy was only assessed in the Manitoba observational
cohort.(66) (5) Reassessment includes clinical evaluation, risk assessment including risk factors, and may include bone density measurement by DXA. The
monitoring interval with DXA should be based upon changes that are detectable and clinically significant. Reassessment may be necessary at less than
2 years in patients with a new fracture, or in light of anticipated accelerated bone loss (e.g. institution of aromatase inhibitor or glucocorticoid therapy).

 premenopausal range. This approach is based on the evidence
that maintenance of BTMs in the lower range is associated with
lower risk of fracture and the rationale that such observations
can be extended to patients who discontinue BPs after long-
term therapy.(60)
Potential risk stratification by fracture risk calculators,
age, and weight
For untreated patients, fracture risk calculators have been
developed to identify individuals who may not have osteoporo-
sis by DXA but are at high fracture risk nonetheless. The
algorithm-based calculators that have been validated in at least
one independent cohort from the original derivation cohort are
the World Health Organization FRAX tool, the Garvan Risk
Calculator, and the QResearch Database Qfracture.(64) To date,
FRAX has been incorporated in some national osteoporosis
guidelines and care pathways, but the evidence for its
usefulness in treated patients is limited. In one study using
the Manitoba database,(65) Leslie and colleagues demonstrated
that FRAX scores in patients on osteoporosis therapies predicted
10-year risk of major osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures,
except for the subgroup of adherent patients at highest risk,
where hip fracture risk was overestimated by 30%.(66) The same
authors also demonstrated in a subsequent publication that
FRAX scores slowly increased over time. This increase was
attenuated but not prevented by treatment, and a change in
FRAX score on therapy did not independently predict incident
fracture.(65) This is not surprising because FRAX includes both
age and femoral neck BMD, which will likely affect the FRAX
calculation in opposite directions over time in the treated
patient.
Age and body mass index (BMI) are two of the most powerful
predictors of fractures in general and play a key role in FRAX.
These factors were independently evaluated in the FLEX study,
and although older age and low BMI were associated with bone
loss at the spine and hip after discontinuation of ALN therapy in
univariate analyses, no model based on these risk factors was
able to predict bone loss rate in the adjusted analyses.(34)
However, age and hip BMD at discontinuation predicted clinical
fracture in the 5 years after discontinuation.(57) In contrast, in the
HORIZON extension study,(58) neither age (�75 years) nor
weight (�60 kg) at entry into the extension or weight loss during
the core trial was a predictor for the occurrence of morphomet-
ric vertebral or nonvertebral fractures in the group that
discontinued ZOL after 3 years.
Stopping Bisphoshonates and Restarting
Therapy
As described above, after 3 years of intravenous ZOL and 5 years
of oral ALN treatment, high-risk postmenopausal white women,
such as those with recent incident fracture in the HORIZON
extension, or with low hip T-scores in both studies appeared to
benefit the most from continued BP treatment. The evidence for
this benefit is limited to reducing the risk of vertebral fractures,
and data for other BPs are lacking. Furthermore, tools to identify
subjects who will fracture when therapy is discontinued are
limited. History and physical examination can provide informa-
tion about additional clinical risk factors that may further
increase fracture risk, such as older age, low BMI, weight loss, fall
history, or the intake of drugs that have adverse effects on bone.
Attention to causes of secondary osteoporosis, calcium intake,
and vitamin D levels may also affect response to therapy. Two
observational studies suggest that the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D level should be 30 ng/mL or more to ensure an adequate
response to BPs.(67–69) However, vitamin D status did not affect
the bone density response to ALN in FIT.(67)
After treatment for 5 years with ALN and 3 years with ZOL, in
postmenopausal women who have a low fracture risk with a hip
T-score higher than –2.5, discontinuation of BP therapy may be
considered with reassessment at 2 to 3 years after discontinua-
tion to determine risk. Patients treated with RIS may need earlier
reassessment because of the shorter biologic half-life of this
BP.(70) Repeat DXA or BTM measurements may be considered
during this “holiday,” but there are no data to guide the clinician
regarding reinstitution of therapy because neither 1-year
change in BMD nor 1 year change in BTMs predicted fractures
post-BP discontinuation.(57) It would be reasonable to consider
withholding therapy as long as BMD is stable and to restart BP
therapy (or an alternate osteoporosis medication) if the BMD
T-score is �–2.5, or if other new/additional risk factors for
fractures emerge. However, this approach is based on expert
opinion. Furthermore, the use of a T-score cut-off of –2.5 for risk
stratification and decision-making regarding therapy discontin-
uation is based on studies conducted almost exclusively in
community-dwelling, postmenopausal white women. Although
the relative risk for fracture/standard deviation decrease in BMD
is best described by an inverse exponential relation that is similar
across populations worldwide, the absolute fracture risk
incurred by the same BMD T-score may be higher in more frail
postmenopausal
women
and
lower
in
some
non-white
populations than in white women.
Safety of Bisphosphonates and Effect of
Discontinuation on Adverse Events
Although some side effects of BPs, such as gastroesophageal
irritation and nephrotoxicity (see below), were recognized early
as potential adverse effects, subsequent reports indicate that BP
use may be associated with clinically serious but rare safety
concerns, including osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical
femoral fractures (AFFs). These are not unique to BPs and have
been reported with denosumab, another potent antiresorptive
agent, and also occur in people who have not been treated with
any of these agents.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)
ONJ was first associated with bisphosphonate therapy in a
report in 2003, in patients with metastatic cancer receiving high-
dose intravenous BP therapy. ONJ is characterized by 1) exposed
necrotic bone in the maxillofacial region that has been present
for at least 8 weeks of appropriate therapy; 2) exposure to potent
antiresorptive agents (BPs or denosumab) or anti-angiogenic
agents; and 3) no history of radiation therapy to the jaw.(71) In
one study,(72) the incidence in patients not on BPs was 1/3000
patient-years. The pathogenesis of ONJ remains unclear,(17,73)
but several potential mechanisms, which are not necessarily
mutually exclusive, have been proposed. These include over-
suppression of bone remodeling, infection, inhibition of
angiogenesis, soft tissue toxicity, and immune dysfunction. In
patients receiving BP therapy for osteoporosis, current estimates
of the incidence of ONJ range from approximately 1/10,000 to
1/100,000 patient treatment years.(8) Potential factors increasing
the risk for BP-treated patients to develop ONJ include poor oral
22

 hygiene, smoking, diabetes mellitus, concomitant glucocorti-
coid and/or chemotherapy use, and invasive dental procedures,
such as dental extractions or implants. The incidence may be
higher in Asian populations, pointing to a genetic predisposi-
tion, as recently reported in Taiwanese subjects.(74) For the vast
majority of patients with osteoporosis treated with BPs who
develop ONJ, the clinical course is mild and self-limited, and the
condition can be treated conservatively.(8,17,75) Preventive
practices that may reduce the incidence of ONJ include
prophylactic dental care and avoidance of invasive dental
procedures. Detailed recommendations for management have
been provided by the ASBMR,(8) the American Dental Associa-
tion,(75) the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial
Surgeons,(76) and the recently updated report of an International
Task Force.(17) Although there appears to be a trend for an
increased risk of ONJ with duration of BP use, the quality of the
evidence for such association is poor.(17) A Drug Safety Update
was just released by the Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency regarding the risk of ONJ with intravenous
BPs and denosumab.(77) Risk factors for ONJ may be included in
the periodic reassessment of benefits and risks of BP therapy.(78)
Atypical femur fractures (AFFs)
The relationship between AFFs and BPs was first reported in
2005 in patients receiving oral BPs for osteoporosis.(10) In a large
retrospective analyses of >1.8 million adults, including approxi-
mately 10% who had been treated with BPs, 142 AFFs were
identified, including 128 in subjects with prior BP exposure.(11)
These fractures usually occur with little or no antecedent
trauma, are often preceded by thigh or groin pain, and may
occur bilaterally.(10,79) Updated diagnostic criteria were pub-
lished in 2014.(9) The diagnosis of AFF is based on subtrochan-
teric or femoral shaft location and the presence of at least 4 of 5
major criteria: minimal trauma, fracture originating at the lateral
cortex and being substantially transverse, complete fractures
extending through both cortices, localized periosteal or
endosteal cortical thickening, and minimal comminution at
most. Minor criteria are not required for the diagnosis but
include increased cortical thickness of the femoral diaphysis,
bilaterality, a prodrome of thigh or groin pain, and delayed
fracture healing. In terms of incidence rates, some but not all
studies suggest a duration response relationship, with a rise in
age-adjusted incidence rates from 1.8/100,000 per year with a 2-
year exposure to 113/100,000 per year with exposure from 8 to
9.9 years.(11) Such results strongly suggest that although a rare
potential complication of BP use, AFF risk increases with
prolonged duration of BP treatment and that this should be
taken into consideration when continuing BPs beyond 5 years.
However, it is important to note that for most patients treated
for osteoporosis, the BP-associated benefit of reduced fracture
risk beyond 5 years, albeit with evidence for vertebral fracture
only, is greater than the risk of developing either ONJ or an AFF
(Fig. 1). Based on the information provided in Fig. 1, it is possible
to estimate benefits and risks for BP therapy for the first 5 years
of therapy. For up to 5 years of BP therapy, approximately
175 hip fractures, 1470 vertebral fractures, and 945 wrist
fractures would be averted (2590 total/100,000) for 16 AFFs/
100,000 associated with treatment, for a total of 162 fractures of
the spine, hip, or forearm prevented/AFF potentially caused. For
years 5 to 10 of BP therapy, there are insufficient data to estimate
the number of fractures averted by BPs because the only studies
available were underpowered for fracture endpoints.
Other risk factors for AFF
Limited data exist regarding AFF risk factors other than BPs.
Recently it has been postulated that a smaller femoral neck-shaft
angle predisposes to AFF.(80) In addition, bowing of the femur
may be associated with increased AFF risk.(81) Whether these or
other patient characteristics can help determine the risk/benefit
ratio for BP therapy duration is not established. Documented
AFFs have also been described among individuals treated with
denosumab, and the impact of duration of denosumab use on
the risk of AFF remains unknown to date, in view of the rather
limited data with long-term denosumab use.(82,83) An increased
risk of AFF has been postulated in glucocorticoid and proton
pump inhibitor users, individuals with diabetes and rheumatoid
arthritis, and individuals of Asian ancestry. In one study, many of
the patients with AFF were younger, active women with
osteopenia; it is possible that many were not at high risk for
typical fracture.(84)
Reports of AFF with denosumab therapy should be kept in
mind when considering switching from BP to denosumab
therapy, and a careful scrutiny of the relevant risk factors for AFF
should be performed.(85) Importantly, documented AFFs have
also occurred in individuals without any history of antiresorptive
therapy.
Other adverse events associated with BP therapy
Other potential adverse events have been reported to be
increased in patients receiving BP therapy but are not included
in this review because they are neither clearly related to BP
use nor to therapy duration. These include esophageal
cancer, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, acute phase
reaction (mostly noted after the first administration of an
intravenous BP), musculoskeletal pain, and gastrointestinal
intolerance. The strength of the association between BP use
and atrial fibrillation and with esophageal carcinoma is weak
at best,(86) and the FDA has not ordered warnings for either
atrial fibrillation or esophageal carcinoma in package inserts
for oral BPs. It is usually possible to avoid renal injury by only
using BPs in patients with a creatinine clearance > 30-35 ml/
min.(87) Intravenous BPs can be used in those patients
with gastrointestinal intolerance or contraindications to oral
BPs.
Side-Effect Risks after Stopping Bisphosphonate
Treatment
Effect of bisphosphonate discontinuation (holiday) on
AFF risk
There are few data estimating the risk of AFF after stopping BPs.
Of the 3 large cohort studies, only the Swedish study by
Schilcher included information about the risk of AFF after
stopping treatment.(12) The risk fell by 70%/year since last BP use
(odds ratio [OR] ¼ 0.28, 95% CI 0.21–0.38), and the most
dramatic reduction in risk occurred after the first year of
discontinuation. Specifically, compared with those without BP
exposure, the relative risk of confirmed AFF was 43 in the first
year after discontinuation and 3.5 after the first year, but these
analyses were based upon a total of 46 AFF events and only 4
AFFs occurred >1 year after discontinuation of BP. The derived
estimates may have been overestimated in view of short-term
follow-up in this cohort.(13)
Journal of Bone and Mineral Research
MANAGING OSTEOPOROSIS PATIENTS ON LONG TERM BPs
23
 Effect of bisphosphonate discontinuation on ONJ risk
Because of the long-terminal half-life of BPs, the American
Dental Association(75) and the American Association of Oral and
Maxillofacial Surgeons(76) do not recommend routine discontin-
uation of BP treatment for osteoporosis in most patients about
to undergo invasive dental procedures. There are no studies of
the incidence of ONJ in patients at different times after
discontinuation of BP treatment for osteoporosis.
Potential use of BTMs to determine safety risks
The value of BTMs to predict which patients on long-term BPs
are at risk for AFFs is unclear. Markedly suppressed bone
turnover leading to an inability to repair skeletal microfractures,
followed by propagation of these small fractures, has been
proposed as the mechanism underlying AFFs.(9,10,88,89) The
second report of a task force convened by the ASBMR
to examine atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femur
fractures identified published reports in which AFFs had
been confirmed by radiologic review.(9) Two small case series
examined the association of BTMs with AFFs.(90,91) Odvina and
colleagues reported 9 patients with “spontaneous nonspinal
fractures” on long-term (range 3 to 8 years) BPs. By dynamic
histomorphometry, all had suppressed bone formation and
8 of 9 had low resorption. The correlation of bone histomor-
phometric parameters with BTMs was poor. Urine NTX
was low to mid normal in 7 subjects, and although serum
BSAP levels ranged widely, serum osteocalcin was low or
at lower limit of the reference range at the time of bone
biopsy.(90) Visekruna and colleagues reported on 3 subjects
who experienced spontaneous “minimal-trauma chalk-stick
type metadiaphyseal femoral fractures” while on long-term
BPs. Serum NTX was low in only one of the subjects.(91) Similarly,
both the American Dental Association recommendations(75)
and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial
Surgeons(76) conclude that measurement of BTMs does not
help in the assessment of risk of ONJ in patients on BPs for
osteoporosis.
Bisphosphonate safety concerns in perspective with
other medical and nonmedical safety issues
To provide a perspective of the safety concerns associated with
BP therapy, Fig. 1 illustrates the incidence of ONJ and AFF and
that of typical osteoporotic fractures in various countries, as well
as some other important outcomes and serious events. The age-
standardized incidence rate of hip fractures (after age 50 years) is
elevated across all continents.(92) Among women in the US, the
age-adjusted annualized rates for fracture greatly exceeds that
of other diseases in the elderly, such as heart attack (2-fold),
breast cancer (4.7-fold), and stroke (8.5-fold). (93) For other health
outcomes, CDC outcome data are expressed as crude rates for
pedestrian injuries and murder.(94,95) The risk of fractures is
substantially decreased by BPs and remains much higher than
that of developing risk of ONJ or AFF (Fig. 1).(11,72) As a
comparison, the risk of stroke is decreased by aspirin therapy,
but the risk of intracerebral bleed is increased to a comparable
degree.(96)
Management of adverse events related to
bisphosphonates
When ONJ or an AFF occurs in a patient on chronic BPs for
osteoporosis, discontinuation of the BP is recommended.
The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons
recommends treatments based on the stage of ONJ.(76) Such
treatment may include antibacterial mouth rinse, oral anti-
biotics, and surgical debridement. Good dental hygiene and
patient education are emphasized for all patients on anti-
resorptive drugs.(75) Specific recommendations for prevention,
operative, and medical management of ONJ have been
reviewed recently.(75,76)
In the past few years, numerous case reports and small
prospective studies have reported healing of AFF or ONJ,
typically occurring within a few months of starting teriparatide
therapy.(97–100)
In addition, a few reports have demonstrated a beneficial
effect of strontium ranelate in AFF.(97–99) Based on available
reports, a limited course of teriparatide may be considered to
accelerate healing of BP-related AFFs or ONJ, consistent with the
recommendations of the ASBMR Task Force on Atypical Femoral
Fractures and the International Consensus report on ONJ.(9,17)
Efficacy and Safety of Alternative Drugs
A summary of efficacy of alternative therapies is provided in
Table 1 and an overview is provided in Supplemental Appendix
5. For detailed reviews on alternative osteoporosis therapies, the
reader is directed to published reviews.(100,101) In women
previously treated with oral BPs, switching to denosumab was
associated with greater increases in BMD and reduction of
turnover markers than continued intake of ALN,(102) RIS,(103) and
IBN,(104) and comparison with ZOL is still ongoing.(105) However,
no information on fracture occurrence after changing therapy is
available.(102,106)
Potential additional benefits of bisphosphonate
treatment
Side effects of BPs may include beneficial effects, although most
evidence is from observational studies. For example, previous
studies have reported that some types of cancer may be found
less commonly in BP users, such as breast cancer,(107) colon
cancer,(108) and gastric cancer.(109) A recent review of osteopo-
rosis registration trials, however, did not show reduced
incidence of breast cancer in patients treated with ALN or
ZOL,(110) although there may be potential positive effects of BPs
in women with established breast cancer.(111) In addition, there
is some evidence that vascular disease may be decreased in
patients treated with BPs, as manifested by lower risk of
stroke(112)
and
myocardial
infarction.(113)
There
are
also
some reports that mortality is reduced in patients treated
with BPs, although not all studies are positive.(54,114–119) The
mechanisms underlying such putative beneficial effects are
unclear. Finally, there is some evidence that a decreased
incidence of pneumonia and arrhythmia after hip fracture may
play a role in the reduced mortality noted in patients treated
with ZOL.(120)

MANAGING OSTEOPOROSIS PATIENTS ON LONG TERM BPs
25
 Because registration trials that demonstrated the antifracture
efficacy of BPs(25,26,28–31) and their corresponding extension
studies with continuation or discontinuation of therapy
thereafter(4,7,58) have been exclusively conducted in postmen-
opausal women, the approach pertains to the management of
this specific patient population. Based on these trials and post
hoc analyses of data from trials that exclusively used ALN and
ZOL,(4,5,57,58) the Task Force determined that for postmeno-
pausal women who have been on oral BP therapy for 5 years
or intravenous ZOL for 3 years, but less than 10 years, a major
consideration was whether the particular patient had experi-
enced a hip, spine (including asymptomatic vertebral com-
pression fractures found by serial height measurements and/or
images before therapy discontinuation), or multiple other
osteoporotic fractures before therapy, or experienced a major
osteoporotic fracture (spine, hip, humerus, or forearm) while
on therapy. Because such fractures, especially when recent (ie,
experienced within 3 to 5 years), increase future fracture
risk,(58,121–125) the Task Force suggests that providers discuss
with patients about the option of continuing oral BP therapy
for up to a total of 10 years. For IV BP use, the approach
pertains to <6 years of ZOL. Patients who sustain a major
osteoporotic fracture while on therapy should also undergo
evaluation for causes of secondary osteoporosis, new risk
factors, and assessment of adherence with medication. In
addition, switching to alternative therapies may be consid-
ered, although there have not been adequate studies to
evaluate the efficacy of such an approach. The optimal length
of therapy for the patient who suffers a fracture while on
treatment has not been established, and clinical judgment will
be needed to determine each patient’s specific fracture risk. In
addition, the potential contributions of poor compliance or
adherence to therapy, inadequate vitamin D status, high fall
risk, or new risk factors should be taken into consideration.
In addition to recent fracture, other potential variables that
may signal increased fracture risk and that could be used for the
decision on whether to continue therapy include older age (for
example, >70 to 75 years), medication use (eg, aromatase
inhibitors, glucocorticoid therapy), or new diagnosis of a
disorder associated with secondary osteoporosis. If the clinician
determines that the patient remains at elevated fracture risk,
based on femoral neck T-score, age, or other risk factors, the Task
Force suggests that the provider discuss with the patient the
option of continuing BP treatment for another 2 to 3 years with
reassessment at that time. For those women who are not
considered to be at high fracture risk by these limited tools, a
drug holiday may be considered with reassessment at 2 to
3 years, perhaps with earlier assessment for those women
treated with RIS. Alternative antifracture therapy could also be
considered for those patients remaining at high risk for fracture.
Alternative treatments would include the agents described in
Supplemental Appendix S5: teriparatide and denosumab as first
options, then raloxifene and, depending on the patient risk
profile. Strontium ranelate could be considered in patients who
cannot tolerate any of the above alternative therapies provided
the patient is not at high risk for cardiovascular disease.
In view of the lack of definitive evidence to support a clinical
pathway, although the Task Force–suggested approach can be
regarded as an aid to making management decisions, it does not
replace the need for clinical judgment in the care of individual
patients. The approach was developed to reflect the data from
two large clinical trials in which the majority of subjects were
white American and European women. The limitations of the
suggested approach, risk stratification, and applicability to other
groups are outlined in section below. Country-specific thresh-
olds and those for non-white women for initial treatment vary,
and so may thresholds for continuation or reinstitution of
therapy.
Limitations of the Proposed Approach
Risk stratification by prevalent fractures
Risk stratification determined by history of fractures is based on
evidence that this subgroup represents a high-risk category
and one in which benefit may be derived from continued
therapy for up to 10 years using ALN and 6 years with ZOL. This
conclusion is derived from the HORIZON extension study
only.(58) However, many patients with a history of major
osteoporotic fractures are older, have experienced multiple
osteoporotic fractures, and may have received BPs for more
than 10 years. Although such patients remain at high risk for
future fractures as they continue to age, with a consistent
increase in fracture risk even when on treatment,(65) there is no
evidence to guide clinicians on the best therapeutic option
beyond 10 years. Such scenarios, therefore, could not be
adequately addressed in the suggested approach (see illustra-
tive cases in Supplemental Appendix S1).
Risk stratification in patients without a history of fracture
In untreated patients, increasing age and decreasing bone
density T-scores at the hip are well-established independent risk
factors for fractures and predictive of response to therapy. The
evidence for continued BP treatment efficacy based on a hip T-
score �–2.5 is limited to the FLEX and HORIZON extension trials
that
were
conducted
in
older
postmenopausal
white
women.(4,5,58) The evidence for age, BMI, and other risk factors
from these studies is also quite limited. Age, entered as a
continuous variable at entry into FLEX extension, was predictive
of future clinical fractures(57) after discontinuation of ALN
therapy.
To date, there are no trials that have tested the antifracture
efficacy of switching therapies after 3 to 5 years of BP
treatment, nor have any trials extended beyond 10 years, or
assessed the utility of reinitiation of treatment after a drug
holiday. The lack of good evidence for continued drug efficacy
for prolonged periods is not unique to the field of osteoporosis
and stems from the fact that most drug registration trials for
chronic diseases last only 3 to 5 years, whereas approved
therapies for such diseases are used for many more years.
However, in the case of BPs, the increase in the risk of harms
constitutes an additional challenge in the management of
high-risk patients. The suggested approach, therefore, only
constitutes a framework for decision making in patients on BP
therapy for less than 10 years. This lack of solid evidence is
unlikely to change and implies that a tailored approach, which
includes assessment of each patient’s individual risk profile,
must be adopted. A thoughtful risk-benefit analysis, shared
decision making with the patient, and careful follow-up are
strongly recommended. Referral of the most challenging
patients, such as those who are considered high risk and have
been on BPs for more than 10 years or who fracture after
several years of BP therapy, to an osteoporosis expert should
also
be
considered.

 addressed by the suggested approach, and illustrate how
clinical decisions may be reached. Lastly, the data available do
not allow for a similar assessment for men with osteoporosis or
for subjects with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, topics
discussed in the following section.
Application of the Approach to Patients on
Glucocorticoid Therapy or Men
Long-term bisphosphonate therapy in individuals taking
continuous oral glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a common cause of
secondary osteoporosis and often requires long-term bone-
protective therapy. Although bone loss and low BMD contribute
to fracture in individuals treated with glucocorticoids, the
increased fracture risk is partially independent of BMD, and
fractures occur at a higher BMD than in other forms of
osteoporosis.(126) As a consequence, most guidelines recom-
mend that treatment be started at a higher T-score in women
receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy than in those not
receiving glucocorticoids.(127,128)
The efficacy of BP therapy in women and men taking
glucocorticoids has mostly been studied for only 1 to 2 years,
with the exception of the comparator study of teriparatide
versus ALN, for which 3-year data are available.(129–135)
Furthermore, fracture has not been a primary endpoint of any
of the treatment studies in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
Post hoc or safety analyses have shown a reduction in
morphometric vertebral fracture for ALN, etidronate, and RIS;
in the comparator study of teriparatide versus ALN, teriparatide
treatment was significantly more effective than ALN in reducing
both morphometric and clinical vertebral fractures.(134) There is
no evidence from any of the studies for a reduction in
nonvertebral or hip fractures, but the number of subjects
studied was small. See Table for approved BPs in glucocorticoid-
induced osteoporosis.
Long-term safety data for BP therapy in women treated with
oral glucocorticoids are also lacking. However, the increased
prevalence of comorbidities and comedications in women
treated with glucocorticoids might be expected to increase the
risk of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal side effects. In
addition, there is evidence from some studies that glucocorti-
coid therapy may increase the risk of BP-associated AFF and ONJ,
although this has not been a consistent finding.(86)
There is evidence that after cessation of glucocorticoid
therapy, fracture risk decreases, although it is unclear whether it
returns to baseline values.(136) If glucocorticoid therapy is
withdrawn, cessation of BP therapy can, therefore, be consid-
ered, depending on BMD, fracture history, and other risk factors.
If fracture risk remains high based on these factors, the Task
Force suggests that treatment be continued. In women who
continue to take glucocorticoids long term in a dose >5 mg/d of
oral prednisolone or equivalent, continuation of bone-protec-
tive therapy is generally indicated.(128)
Current guidelines on the management of glucocorticoid-
induced osteoporosis do not specifically address the issue of
duration of therapy in patients treated with BPs.(127,128)
However, in those women who require continued bone-
protective therapy and who have received BPs for more than
5 years, switching to teriparatide may be considered. The ability
of BMD measurements and/or fracture risk algorithms such as
FRAX to predict fracture in individuals taking glucocorticoids
and treated with bone-protective therapy has not been
tested. However, higher T-score thresholds than those used
in postmenopausal
osteoporosis,
including
the –2.5 hip
T-score cut-off used in the proposed approach, may be
appropriate in such patients, given the higher BMD at which
fractures occur.
Most BP trials in patients on glucocorticoids were conducted
in women and men. Thus, men older than 50 years who are
treated with long-term glucocorticoids >5 mg/d are also at
increased risk of fracture and may benefit from continuation of
therapy.(127)
Long-term bisphosphonate therapy in men
The efficacy of BP therapy in men has mostly been studied for
2 to 3 years, with extension studies proceeding for as long as
4 years.(137–142) ALN, RIS, and ZOL have been approved for
treatment of osteoporosis in men but not IBN (Table). The
optimal duration of therapy in men has not been determined.
Unlike for postmenopausal women, fractures have not been
the primary endpoint for any of the BP treatment studies in
men except for a single ZOL trial.(143) There is no evidence
from any of the studies for a reduction in nonvertebral or hip
fractures in men (Table), although men were included in the
ZOL post-hip fracture trial(118) in which a reduced fracture risk
was demonstrated in the overall study population. Long-term
safety data for BP therapies in men are also lacking. The
prevalence of comorbidities and comedications in men might
be expected to lead to similar risk of adverse events as in
women. There is no evidence from studies that long-term BP
therapy increases the risk of BP-associated AFF and ONJ more
in men than in women. In one recent observational study,(144)
AFF incidence was not related to BP treatment duration. There
is no evidence that cessation of BP therapy in men leads to
greater or more rapid increase in fracture risk than in women.
It remains unclear how long it takes in men for fracture risk to
return to baseline values before treatment, but presumably
this is similar to postmenopausal women. If fracture risk
remains high based on post-treatment BMD or other risk
factors as suggested for postmenopausal women, continued
treatment
should
be
considered.
In
men
who
require
continued bone-protective therapy and who have received
BPs for more than 5 years, switching to teriparatide may be
considered.
In light of these considerations, the approach developed by
the ASBMR Task Force on Long-Term Bisphosphonates can be
considered generally applicable to older men, although
evidence in men is much scarcer than in postmenopausal
women. Men on long-term BP therapy presumably have similar
safety issues as postmenopausal women, with no greater risks
identified in men. It would be reasonable to continue treatment
in men on long-term therapy with a history of hip, spine, or
multiple other osteoporotic fractures or major osteoporotic
fracture while on therapy. For other men who have hip BMD T-
scores above –2.5 and who are not considered high risk because
of age or other risk factors such as androgen-deprivation
therapy for prostate cancer, consideration of a drug holiday is
reasonable for 2 to 3 years. Again, those men on RIS may need
earlier reassessment. On the other hand, for men who have
these types of fractures or have a hip BMD T-score at or below
–2.5 or who are high risk, it is reasonable to continue treatment,
with reassessment for possible drug holiday in 2 to 3 years. This
conclusion is based on the evidence that changes in surrogates

27
 for fracture (BMD) in response to BPs are similar in men and
women. The IOF and ISCD recommend that a white female
database be used for calculation of the T-score in men, as does
the FRAX online calculator, whereas the NOF and Endocrine
Society recommend the use of a white male database. The
former approach would decrease the number of men who
would be considered eligible for continued treatment after 3 to
5 years of BP. The impact of database selection in men on
fracture prediction and actual fracture incidence was investi-
gated by Ensrud and colleagues in treatment naive men
from the MrOs cohort in the US.(145) The authors demonstrated
that in the subgroup of men with osteoporosis exclusively
defined by T-score using a female reference database, the
proportion of subjects who actually experienced osteoporotic
fractures (major or hip) were highest compared with those in the
subgroup identified by the use of a male database or other
subgroups.
Conclusions
It is obvious that there is relatively little evidence on which the
Task Force can base recommendations, and indeed we have
presented management suggestions based on limited data
and clinical experience. Risk stratification is an important
consideration to guide therapy continuation in patients on
long-term BPs, as it also should be in treatment naive
individuals.
The risk of AFF is low, with an incidence of up to 50/100,000
during the first 5 years of BP, resulting in a clear positive benefit/
risk ratio within this time frame. However, although the risk of
AFF increases further with prolonged BP use, reaching up to 113/
100,000 after 8 to 9 years, there is much less certainty about
these estimates, thus rendering an assessment for a sustained
positive benefit/risk ratio with more prolonged BP use quite
challenging. Furthermore, sustained fracture efficacy with
prolonged BP use has been shown for vertebral fracture only.
The sample size of the extension studies was too small to enable
detection of nonvertebral fracture risk reduction. Thus, the
ultimate decision for a patient to continue long-term BP therapy
beyond 5 years should take into consideration the limitations of
the efficacy and safety studies. Patients’ values and preferences
should be integrated with the limited data available to enable
individualized shared decision making.
The cases presented in Supplemental Appendix S1 demon-
strate how individualization of management is achieved. For
many of the challenges raised, studies do not exist to guide our
practice, such as in the use of BPs beyond 10 years and long-term
BP use in men or in patients on long-term glucocorticoid
therapy. They also show that even if there were multiple
randomized controlled studies on which the approach could be
based, clinical judgment would still play an important role in
taking care of patients with osteoporosis. As has been discussed
in a series of papers on guidelines,(146) basing guidelines on
randomized trials does not address the impact of coexisting
conditions in many patients with a given disorder. This is
particularly true for osteoporosis because most patients are
older and very often have many comorbidities.
It is unlikely that there will ever be randomized controlled
trials of osteoporosis patients of sufficient size and duration to
provide clear evidence that a given strategy for long-term
management leads to fewer osteoporotic fractures. Observa-
tional studies may provide some information, but they are
always affected by potential unmeasured confounders and by
the fact that many patients are not adherent to osteoporosis
therapy. With new medications in development, it may be
possible to treat patients with a sequence of therapeutic agents
in the hope that such a strategy will lead to fewer adverse events
but improved fracture risk reduction. Nonetheless, the new
drugs will likely be approved based on registration trials similar
to the ones for existing approved drugs, and no trials are
anticipated to address sequential therapies over extended
periods of times. The clinician caring for the patient with the
chronic disorder of osteoporosis will need to use the art in
addition to the science of medicine. The approach created by
the Task Force will be only one tool to help in clinical decision-
making.
Research needs and future directions
It is unlikely that additional evidence from the FLEX and
HORIZON extension studies will result in major changes to the
suggested approach in the near future. However, there is a
pressing need to validate the use of FRAX or other fracture risk
calculators in individuals on BP therapy. Similarly, investigations
of additional tools or different approaches to use bone turnover
or other markers to apply a personalized approach and identify
high-risk individuals while on or off therapy, to detect those at
higher risk for AFF or ONJ, and to monitor individuals off therapy
are also needed. Studies of sequential therapy may identify new
long-term strategies for fracture risk reduction. Finally, lessons
learned from the prolonged BP therapy experience should be
taken into account when developing protocols for extension
studies for current and future therapies.
Disclosures
The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) is
well served by the fact that many of those responsible for policy
development and implementation have diverse interests and
are involved in a variety of activities outside of the Society.
Accordingly, the ASBMR requires all ASBMR Officers, Councilors,
Committee Chairs, Editors-in-Chief, Associate Editors, and
certain other appointed representatives to disclose any real or
apparent conflicts of interest (including investments or positions
in companies involved in the bone and mineral metabolism
field), as well as any duality of interests (including affiliations,
organizational interests, and/or positions held in entities
relevant to the bone and mineral metabolism field and/or the
American Society for Bone and Mineral Research).
The committees, task forces, and editorial boards of the
ASBMR and its publications carry out the work of the Society on
behalf of the membership. The distinct functions of the
committees, task forces, and editorial boards are intended to
address the broad mission of the ASBMR: to promote excellence
in research and education, to integrate basic and clinical science
in the field of bone and mineral metabolism, and to facilitate the
translation of research into clinical practice and the betterment
of human health. Chairs and members of committees, task
forces, and editorial boards must assure that they act in
these roles in a manner free from commercial bias and that
they resolve any conflict or duality of interest or disclose them
and then recuse themselves from related deliberations and
voting. Below is a summary of disclosures from each task force
member.
