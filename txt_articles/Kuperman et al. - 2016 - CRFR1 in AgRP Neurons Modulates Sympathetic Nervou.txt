In Brief
Kuperman et al. reveal a critical role for
the stress-induced CRF receptor
expressed in a subset of AgRP neurons in

following challenge reduces AgRP
neuronal excitability and enables

SUMMARY
Signaling by the corticotropin-releasing factor re-
ceptor type 1 (CRFR1) plays an important role in
mediating the autonomic response to stressful
challenges. Multiple hypothalamic nuclei regulate
sympathetic outflow. Although CRFR1 is highly ex-
pressed in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothal-
amus, the identity of these neurons and the role of
CRFR1 here are presently unknown. Our studies
show that nearly half of Arc-CRFR1 neurons coex-
press agouti-related peptide (AgRP), half of which
originate from POMC precursors. Arc-CRFR1 neu-
rons are innervated by CRF neurons in the hypotha-
lamic paraventricular nucleus, and CRF application
decreases
AgRP+CRFR1+
neurons’
excitability.
Despite similar anatomy in both sexes, only female
mice selectively lacking CRFR1 in AgRP neurons
showed a maladaptive thermogenic response to
cold and reduced hepatic glucose production during
fasting. Thus, CRFR1, in a subset of AgRP neurons,
plays a regulatory role that enables appropriate
sympathetic nervous system activation and conse-
quently protects the organism from hypothermia
and hypoglycemia.
INTRODUCTION
The well-being of an organism necessitates appropriate physio-
logical responses to homeostatic challenges. The hypothalamus
integrates neural circuits for control of survival behaviors,
including feeding, drinking, defense, and reproduction (Stern-
son, 2013). These circuits often intertwine and overlap and are
regulated by various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Hy-
pothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF; also known as
corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH]), secreted from the par-
vocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), has a
prominent role in initiating the cascade of biological events dur-
ing the stress response and represents a neuropeptide that af-
fects a vast repertoire of the aforementioned behaviors. CRF’s
physiological actions are mediated primarily by activating the
CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1/CRHR1), which is required for
appropriate behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress
(Mu
¨ ller et al., 2003; Smith et al., 1998; Timpl et al., 1998). CRFR1
is widely expressed in the mammalian brain with high expression
levels in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory
bulb, and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) (Van Pett et al.,
2000). Early upon CRF isolation (Vale et al., 1981), it was shown
that in addition to its hypophysiotrophic role, CRF acts within the
brain to stimulate sympathetic outflow. This was manifested by
elevated heart rate and mean arterial pressure (Fisher et al.,
1982) as well as increases in blood glucose, norepinephrine,
epinephrine, and glucagon levels (Brown et al., 1982). These hor-
monal changes were associated with increases in motor activity
and oxygen consumption and were attributed to the central ac-
tion of CRF, as they were not prevented by adrenalectomy
(Brown et al., 1982). Later studies using selective antagonists
were able to confirm that stress-induced norepinephrine release
is mediated by CRFR1 activation (Griebel et al., 2002). Consis-
tent with this, CRF involvement in adaptive thermogenesis was
also demonstrated. Intracerebroventricular administration of
CRF stimulates sympathetic outflow to brown adipose tissue
(BAT) (Arase et al., 1988). This action was suggested to be medi-
ated through CRF receptors in the dorsomedial hypothalamus
(DMH) as well as the preoptic area (Cerri and Morrison, 2006),
whereas the effect through PVN-CRFR was questionable (Cerri
and Morrison, 2006; LeFeuvre et al., 1987).
Several hypothalamic nuclei were shown to regulate auto-
nomic responses to stressors (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009),
of which the PVN is prominent. Within the PVN, distinct sympa-
thetic premotor neurons project to either the sympathetic inter-
mediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord or the parasympathetic
dorsal vagal motor nucleus (Swanson and Sawchenko, 1980;
Vin
˜ uela and Larsen, 2001). Retrograde tracing showed forebrain
neurons innervating the BAT, which arise mainly from the PVN
and the medial preoptic region (mPO) and to a lesser extent
from the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the lateral

 hypothalamus (LH) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
(Bamshad et al., 1999). Likewise, retrograde tracing from the
liver labeled second-order neurons in several regions, including
the PVN, LH, zona incerta, and retrochiasmatic area (la Fleur
et al., 2000).
The PVN is heavily innervated by GABAergic inputs, which
deliver substantial inhibitory tone important for regulating sympa-
thetic outflow. Antagonizing PVN GABAergic receptors increases
sympathetic nerve activity (Cole and Sawchenko, 2002; Kannan
et al., 1989; Madden and Morrison, 2009). Intra-hypothalamic
sources for GABAergic input to the PVN include the mPO,
DMH, LH, SCN, and Arc (Cone, 2005; Herman et al., 2005; Kals-
beek et al., 2004), as well as GABAergic interneurons in the halo
zone surrounding the PVN, including the anterior hypothalamic
and perifornical regions (Roland and Sawchenko, 1993).
The Arc is composed of two main populations of neurons,
neuroendocrine neurons that have nerve endings in the median
eminence and neurons regulating energy homeostasis (Lehman
et al., 2013). The appetite-regulatory network in the Arc includes
two major distinct populations with opposing actions on food
intake and metabolic rate: the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocor-
tin (POMC) neurons and the orexigenic agouti-related peptide
(AgRP) neurons, which coexpress neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and
g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Cone, 2005).
Despite the high expression level, the identity of Arc-CRFR1
neurons and the role of CRFR1 in this brain region are presently
unknown. Here, we show that CRFR1 marks a unique subpopu-
lation of AgRP neurons, half of which originate from POMC pre-
cursor. This subpopulation projects predominantly to regions
associated with regulation of food intake and autonomic outflow.
We show that CRF decreases the excitability of neurons immu-
nopositive for both AgRP and CRFR1 (AgRP+CRFR1+) and that
under challenge, CRFR1 signaling in these neurons helps the or-
ganism transition from an anabolic to a catabolic state in order to
promote survival.
RESULTS
CRFR1 Marks a Subpopulation of AgRP Neurons, Some
of which Originate from POMC Precursors
To characterize CRFR1-expressing neurons in the Arc, we used
the well-validated CRFR1-GFP reporter mouse (Justice et al.,
2008). This mouse line is based on a bacterial artificial chromo-
some that contains the entire CRFR1 genomic locus and has
GFP cellular expression that closely matches that of Crfr1
mRNA (Justice et al., 2008). We further examined the Arc of
these mice, validating that the Gfp expression matches that of
Crfr1 by double in situ hybridization (Figure 1A). To explore the
colocalization of CRFR1 with AgRP-expressing neurons, we
crossed the CRFR1-GFP mouse with an AgRP reporter mouse,
which expresses Cre recombinase under control of the AgRP
promoter (AgRP-IRES-Cre; Tong et al., 2008) and a reporter
allele encoding tdTomato red fluorescent protein upon Cre-
mediated recombination (Rosa26-CAG-lsl-tdtomato, Ai9; Madi-
sen et al., 2010). Analysis of Arc sections obtained from these
mice (CRFR1-GFP-AgRPTOM) showed that half of Arc-CRFR1
neurons colocalize with AgRP-expressing neurons (males,
46.7 ± 5.7%; females, 50.4 ± 5.0%), defining half of AgRP neu-
rons (males 52.6 ± 9.9%; females 50.4 ± 8.5%) (Figures 1B
and 1H). We found that the numbers of CRFR1 and AgRP neu-
rons are similar and do not significantly differ between males
and females (Figure S1A). In addition, we found that the expres-
sion levels of Agrp and Crfr1in the mediobasal hypothalamus
(MBH) of wild-type (WT) mice does not differ between males
and females (Figure S1B). We further assessed whether
CRFR1 colocalizes with POMC-expressing neurons by crossing
the CRFR1-GFP with mice expressing Cre recombinase spe-
cifically in POMC-expressing neurons or cells (POMC-Cre;
Balthasar et al., 2004) and the Tomato reporter (CRFR1-GFP-
POMCTOM mice). Analysis of Arc slices obtained from these
mice revealed that about a third of Arc-CRFR1 neurons colocal-
ize with POMC-Cre-expressing neurons (31.7 ± 3.15%; Figures
1C and 1H). Given that POMC-Cre marks not only adult
POMC-expressing neurons but also POMC neurons that trans-
differentiated from a POMC precursor during early develop-
mental stages (Padilla et al., 2010, 2012), we further used
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH), which is processed from the POMC precursor and
therefore marks neurons currently expressing POMC. ACTH im-
munostaining showed that in adult mice, CRFR1 and ACTH do
not colocalize (Figure 1D).
We further explored the colocalization of CRFR1 with rat insu-
lin promoter (RIP)-Cre-, dopamine-, and somatostatin (SST)-ex-
pressing neurons. We found that 36 ± 1.9% and 17.1 ± 1.3% of
Arc CRFR1 neurons colocalize with RIP-Cre- and SST-express-
ing neurons, respectively (Figures 1E and 1F), whereas no coloc-
alization was observed with dopaminergic neurons (Figure 1G).
The finding that in adult mice, CRFR1 and ACTH are ex-
pressed in a mutually exclusive manner suggests that CRFR1
marks a subpopulation of POMC neurons that adopt a non-
POMC fate (Figure 2A). Because about a quarter of the Arc-
NPY population originates from a POMC progenitor (Padilla
et al., 2010) we further assessed whether POMC-Cre+CRFR1+
neurons adopted an AgRP fate by using IHC for AgRP on slices
obtained from CRFR1-GFP-POMCTOM mice. This indicated that
the majority of POMC-Cre+CRFR1+ neurons express AgRP,
signifying that CRFR1 marks POMC neurons that adopt an
AgRP fate (Figure 2B, white arrows). Importantly, POMC-Cre+
AgRP+CRFR1� neurons were rarely found (Figure 2B, gray
arrow).
To rule out the possibility that absence of CRFR1 affects the
early embryonic shift of POMC cells, we measured POMC and
AgRP expression levels in hypothalami obtained from develop-
mental CRFR1 knockout (KO) mice. CRFR1 KO mice are gluco-
corticoid (GC) deficient (Smith et al., 1998); therefore, in order to
avoid effects mediated by the absence of circulating GC, we
collected hypothalami of CRFR1 KO and their WT littermates
at postnatal day 4, while the pups receive GC from their mother’s
milk. No differences in Agrp or Pomc mRNA expression levels
were observed in CRFR1 KO (Figure 2C).
In summary, Arc-CRFR1 is expressed by at least three
neuronal populations (SST, AgRP, and RIP), which share inhibi-
tory properties (Bluet-Pajot et al., 1998; Kong et al., 2012; Wu
et al., 2009) (Figure 1D). Most of Arc-CRFR1 is expressed by
orexigenic neurons, the major population being AgRP-express-
ing neurons. Because not all AgRP+CRFR1+ express the
POMC-Cre lineage marker, we suggest that AgRP+CRFR1+ neu-
rons arise from at least two ontological lineages.

 AgRP-CRFR1 Neurons Respond to Known AgRP
Stimulants
To deepen the characterization of AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons, we
checked their responsiveness to different physiological and hor-
monal signaling. Using the CRFR1-GFP-AgRPTOM reporter mice
we verified that as reported for AgRP neurons, AgRP+CRFR1+
neurons are activated by fasting and by ghrelin, measured by
the expression of the early mediated gene, c-fos (Liu et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2002). Indeed, c-fos expression was upregu-
lated in AgRP neurons following a 24 hr fast or following ghrelin
injection compared with fed mice or saline-injected mice,
respectively, regardless of CRFR1 expression (Figures S1C
and S1D).
About one third of AgRP neurons were reported to respond to
leptin injection as marked by phosphorylation of signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; van de Wall
et al., 2008).
IHC with pSTAT3 antibody on slices obtained from the
double-reporter mice injected with leptin revealed that a third
of CRFR1 neurons respond to leptin in both males and females
(Figures 2D and 2E). Leptin-responsive AgRP neurons were
evenly distributed in AgRP+CRFR1+ and in AgRP+CRFR1�

 neurons. AgRP leptin responsiveness tended to be higher in
females compared with males (females, 46.2% ± 1.2%; males,
32.4% ± 10.2%; p = 0.08; Figure 2F and Figure S1E), supporting
the suggested increased leptin signaling in the Arc of females
(Clegg et al., 2003). The percentage of AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons
that were responsive to leptin was similar to that of total
AgRP. This suggests that within each sex, leptin-responsive
AgRP neurons were evenly distributed in AgRP+CRFR1+ and
in AgRP+CRFR1� neurons. This was supported by a similarly
responsive
population
within
POMC-Cre+CRFR1+
neurons
(Figures 2D and 2E and Figure S1E).
AgRP-CRFR1 Neurons Project Mainly to the LH and the
PVN and Are Innervated by PVN-CRF Neurons
AgRP neurons project to a number of brain areas covering both
rostral and caudal regions (Broberger et al., 1998). AgRP projec-
tions to different brain regions were shown to originate from
separate, distinct subpopulations of AgRP neurons (Betley
et al., 2013). Because CRFR1 marks a subset of AgRP neurons,
we wondered whether this population has a distinct projection
profile. For this purpose, we used the double-reporter mice
and characterized the projections of AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons.
Nine AgRP projection fields were analyzed, and the proportion
of AgRP+CRFR1+ projections out of total AgRP projections to
each region was quantified using IMMARIS software. AgRP+
CRFR1+ neurons were found to project mainly to the LH, the
PVN, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis (BNST) (Figure 3A). Weaker projections
were observed at the DMH, the mPO, the paraventricular
thalamic nucleus (PVT), the central amygdala (CeA), and the par-
abrachial nucleus (PBN) (Figure S2). Overall, AgRP+CRFR1+ pro-
jections were found to constitute between 2% and 14% of AgRP
projections to the inspected regions (Figure 3B, left y axis).
Importantly, this analysis underestimates the overlapping pro-
jections because of strict analysis criteria that were used in order
to distinguish regional CRFR1 projections from AgRP+CRFR1+
projections. The intensity of AgRP projection varies in different
brain regions (Wang et al., 2015). Therefore, the proportion of
AgRP+CRFR1+ projections was calculated according to the rela-
tive portion of AgRP neurons projection to a specific site (raw
data taken from experiment 46554676-Arc, Allen Mouse Brain
Connectivity Atlas [Oh et al., 2014]; Figures 3B, right y axis,
and 3C). Interestingly, within the PVN, and in agreement with
AgRP inhibitory action on sympathetic outflow, we could detect
AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons innervating PVN-TH+ neurons (Fig-
ure 3D, white arrows).

 Another intriguing question regarding the connectivity of
AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons is the origin and identity of the CRFR1
ligand. From the mammalian CRF peptide family (Lewis et al.,
2001; Reyes et al., 2001; Vaughan et al., 1995), both CRF
and urocortin 1 (Ucn1) are potential nominees for innervating
Arc-CRFR1 neurons. In order to check whether CRF inner-
vates AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons, we searched for CRF positive
synapses, marked by post-synaptic density 95 (PSD95) in
AgRP reporter mice. Confocal analysis verified that endogenous
CRF innervates AgRP neurons (Figures 3D and 3E, white arrow).
CRF is expressed in diverse brain regions, including the cortex,
hippocampus, and CeA (Swanson et al., 1983). Yet the immedi-
ate candidate for Arc-CRFR1 neurons innervations is CRF
arising from the PVN, either directly or as collaterals of CRF neu-
rons projecting to the median eminence (Niimi et al., 1988). To
examine this hypothesis, we injected a viral vector encoding a
Cre-dependent mCherry reporter fused to synaptophysin into
the PVN of CRF-Cre mice (Taniguchi et al., 2011), which were
crossed with CRFR1-GFP mice. In these mice, red synapses
represent synapses in which the pre-synaptic neurons are
PVN-CRF-expressing neurons. Confocal analysis confirmed
that Arc-CRFR1 neurons are innervated by CRF neurons arising
from the PVN (Figure 3F). We do not rule out the possibility that
Arc-CRFR1 neurons could also be innervated by Ucn1 or by CRF
arising from other brain regions.
CRF Application Decreases AgRP Neurons’ Excitability
To determine the significance of CRFR1 signaling in AgRP neu-
rons in regulating energy homeostasis, we generated mice
lacking CRFR1 specifically in AgRP neurons (AgRPDCRFR1;
Figure 4A). CRFR1 deletion was confirmed by quantitative real-
time PCR analysis showing, as expected, a 40% reduction in
Crfr1 expression levels in the MBH of AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Fig-
ure 4B). The reduction in Crfr1 expression is consistent with
the confocal analysis showing that 50% of CRFR1 neurons co-
localize with AgRP neurons (Figure 1B). To ensure the restricted
CRFR1 deletion in the Arc of AgRPDCRFR1 mice, we verified
that Crfr1 expression was unchanged in several brain regions
with high Crfr1 expression (Figure S3A). Crfr1 mRNA level was
also similar in peripheral tissues that were described for develop-
mental AgRP expression (Figure S3A). In addition, we confirmed
that pituitary Crfr1 expression level and both basal and stress-
induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function
was intact in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figures S3B and S3C). This
is in line with mice lacking CRFR1 from GABAergic neurons
that exhibit intact HPA function and no changes in anxiety-like
behavior (Refojo et al., 2011).
We crossed AgRPDCRFR1 mice with CRFR1-GFP-AgRPTOM
mice to generate mice in which AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons are
labeled but do not express CRFR1. Then, to define whether
and how the electrophysiological properties of AgRP neurons
are modulated by CRF, we visually identified AgRP+CRFR1+
neurons in acute Arc brain slices (Figure S3D) and performed
patch-clamp recordings in these cells in slices obtained from
both female and male double-reporter mice with (control) or
without (AgRPDCRFR1) CRFR1 expression.
Acute activation of the stress response and AgRP stimula-
tion has opposing effects regarding food intake and autonomic
activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that, similar to leptin (van
den Top et al., 2004), CRF action on AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons
will have an inhibitory effect, negating the typical nature of
AgRP neurons. Firing of action potentials (APs) was evoked in
AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons by current injection under control con-
ditions and after bath application of CRF (125 nM). Remarkably,
CRF application strongly decreased evoked neuronal firing
(Figure 4C, left). This effect was mediated by CRFR1 activation,
as it was completely abolished in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Fig-
ure 4C, right). Concomitant with the decrease in neuronal excit-
ability, the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) was increased by CRF
application (Figure 4D, left). This increase in AHP amplitude
could explain the CRF-mediated decrease in firing rate, impli-
cating that AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons require a longer time to
repolarize after generating an AP, thus delaying the appearance
of another AP. However, this effect cannot explain the total
absence of APs in the presence of CRF, which was observed
in some cells (Figure 4C, left). Consistently, we revealed that
CRF additionally reduced the input resistance (Rin) of AgRP
neurons (Figure 4E, left). This effect and the increase in AHP
amplitude were absent in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figures 4D
and 4E, right).
Notably, CRF application had no effect on AgRP-positive neu-
rons (tdTomato positive), which do not express CRFR1 (GFP
negative; Figures S3E and S3F). This further supports the
observed effects as direct and specific for AgRP+CRFR1+
neurons.
CRFR1 Signaling in AgRP Neurons Regulates Heat
Production
Given the inhibitory tone CRF poses on AgRP neurons and the
projection profile of AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons, we postulated
that in the absence of CRFR1, AgRP neurons will have higher ac-
tivity, leading to stronger suppression of the target regions. This
could result in increased food intake and reduced energy expen-
diture. We followed the body weight and growth rates of both
male and female AgRPDCRFR1 mice and found them similar
to that of their control littermates (Figure 5A). In line with the
similar body weight, AgRPDCRFR1 mice did not differ in their
body composition and had similar percentages of fat and lean
masses (Figures S4A and S4B). Glucose and insulin tolerance
tests revealed no disturbance in glucose homeostasis or insulin
sensitivity in AgRPDCRFR1 mice on standard diet (Figures S4C–
S4F). Food intake of AgRPDCRFR1 mice was equivalent to their
control littermates, and their feeding response to ghrelin injection
was intact (Figures S5A and S5B). This suggests that despite
projecting to brain regions associated with the orexigenic action
of AgRP, CRFR1 signaling in AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons does not
modulate feeding directly.
Interestingly, although they have similar food intake and loco-
motor activity (Figures S5A and S5C), AgRPDCRFR1 female
mice exhibited reduced heat production during the dark phase
of the day cycle (Figure 5B). The reduced heat production was
reflected in lower body temperature in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Fig-
ure 5C). In addition, hypothalamic expression of Pomc and Mc4r
were found to be lower in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figure 5D). This
points toward a reduced melanocortinergic tone that is corre-
lated with diminished energy expenditure in both humans and ro-
dents (Huszar et al., 1997). Overall, these findings suggest that
under basal conditions, deletion of CRFR1 in AgRP neurons

 slightly alters energy balance and to some extent mimics AgRP
activation as in an energy-deficit state.
Given the role of CRFR1 signaling in integrating the autonomic,
metabolic, and behavioral responses to stressors (Brown et al.,
1982; Sutton et al., 1982) and the inhibitory action of CRF on
AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons, we examined whether the differences
in heat production could be augmented under a challenge. We
exposed the mice to a cold temperature that activates the sym-
pathetic nervous system, resulting in the stimulation of b-adren-
ergic receptors on brown adipocytes and induces activation and
expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This
adaptive thermogenic process involves heat dissipation by
BAT and induces browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) (Harms
and Seale, 2013). Shortly following exposure to 5�C, body tem-
perature dropped significantly more in AgRPDCRFR1 mice,
and their temperature remained lower throughout the experi-
ment (Figure 5E). BAT gene expression analysis showed that
Ucp1
transcription
was
induced
to
a
lesser
extent
in
AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figure 5F). Reduced Ucp1 expression
was also demonstrated by IHC with UCP1 antibody (Figure 5G),
while expression of Adrb3, Pgc1, Dio2, and Fgf21 were similar
(Figure S5D). In addition, examination of inguinal WAT, which is
known to undergo browning following cold exposure, revealed
that several browning-related genes, including Ucp1, Pgc1,
Dio2, and Cidea, are strongly induced in control compared
with AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figure 5H). These data show impair-
ment in autonomic activation necessary for cold-induced ther-
mogenesis in AgRPDCRFR1 mice. They further suggest that
CRFR1 inhibitory action in AgRP neurons is required for allowing
appropriate cold-induced
thermogenesis. Interestingly,
the
described differences were not observed in males. Although
Pomc mRNA levels were mildly but significantly lower in male
AgRPDCRFR1 mice, they had similar food intake, heat produc-
tion, body temperature, and response to cold stress as controls
(Figures S6A–S6F).
CRFR1 in AgRP Neurons Regulates Hepatic Glucose
Production during Fasting
Since AgRP neurons are activated by fasting and have a role
in regulating hepatic glucose production (HGP) (Ko
¨ nner et al.,
2007), we checked whether the absence of CRFR1 from AgRP
neurons affects various functions under fasting. First, we chal-
lenged the mice with food deprivation while in the metabolic
cages. Soon after fast initiation, AgRPDCRFR1 mice showed a
quicker drop of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) than controls,
but once refed, they had a similar rebound RER (Figure 6A).
This indicates that upon fasting, AgRPDCRFR1 mice have an
earlier transit from carbohydrates to fatty acids as an energy
source, meaning that CRFR1 action in AgRP neurons is required
for a balanced transition to fat oxidation. Interestingly, this alter-
ation in energy partitioning during fasting is similar to the one
observed in mice lacking Foxo1 in AgRP neurons (Ren et al.,
2012).
To check if fat oxidation was preferred because of a reduction
in HGP, the hepatic capacity to produce glucose was assessed
by a pyruvate challenge after an overnight fast. As suspected,
AgRPDCRFR1 mice had a significantly lower increase in glucose
levels (Figure 6B), showing that their adaptation to fasting was
probably due to reduced hepatic ability to produce glucose. To
study possible mechanisms of decreased gluconeogenesis,
we measured hepatic gene expression under basal and fasting
state. Although G6pc and Pgc1 expression levels were similar
at basal state, fasting induced their expression to a lower extent
in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figures 6C and 6D). Pck expression was
generally lower in AgRPDCRFR1 mice (main genotype effect) but
was not statistically different in the fed or fasted state (Figure 6E),
whereas hepatic expression of Foxo1 and Fgf21 was similar at
basal level and were similarly induced by fasting (Figures S5E
and S5F). Interestingly, hypothalamic Crf is upregulated during
fasting in both genotypes, and corticosterone levels were simi-
larly elevated in the fasting state (Figures 6F and S5G), further
supporting the relevance of the CRF circuit under these condi-
tions. The altered kinetics of the RER as well as the differences
in HGP observed using pyruvate tolerance test were not
observed in male AgRPDCRFR1 mice (Figures S6G and S6H).
Taken together, these data suggest that CRFR1 inhibitory action
in AgRP neurons is required for appropriate energy partitioning
and maintenance of blood glucose levels during periods of
limited energy resources.
DISCUSSION
Classification of Arc-CRFR1-Expressing Neurons
In this work, we have classified the previously uncharacterized
population of Arc-CRFR1-expressing neurons. We have found
that CRFR1 in this nucleus is composed of several inhibitory
subpopulations (AgRP, RIP, and SST neurons). This implies a
role for CRFR1 in regulating both energy balance and growth
under stressful circumstances in order to promote survival
(Figure 6G).
At first, it appeared that a smaller portion of CRFR1 neurons
colocalizes with anorexigenic POMC-expressing neurons (using
POMC-Cre mice; Figure 1C). However, a deeper examination re-
vealed that the colocalization is only with embryonically labeled
POMC neurons that adopt a non-POMC fate during develop-
ment. It was elegantly shown a few years ago that about a
quarter of AgRP neurons arise from POMC progenitors (Padilla
et al., 2010). We were able to show that most of POMC-Cre+
CRFR1+ neurons are AgRP-expressing neurons and therefore
suggest that AgRP-CRFR1 neurons can be defined by their
embryonic origin, half of which originate from an anorexigenic
progenitor marked by POMC-cre. This expression pattern is

 supported by a recent study that found that Crfr1 expression is
largely enriched in AgRP compared with POMC isolated neurons
(Henry et al., 2015). It is exciting to think that prenatal stressful
events may influence the proportion of POMC differentiation
through CRFR1. However, the sequentially of embryonic expres-
sion suggests that this is not the case. The differentiation of
POMC to AgRP occurs at embryonic day (ED) 14.5 (Padilla
et al., 2010). Although hypothalamic CRF is already expressed
at ED 13.5 (Keegan et al., 1994), CRFR1 expression is observed
only at later gestational stages and was shown at ED 17 in rats
(Insel et al., 1988) and by ED 18 but not by ED 15 in mice (Allen
Brain Atlas), signifying the importance of this circuit for postnatal
stages.
Connectivity Mapping of AgRP-CRFR1-Expressing
Neurons
Given the vital role of AgRP neurons in controlling hunger, and
their exclusive expression pattern, their connectivity was exten-
sively studied (Atasoy et al., 2012; Betley et al., 2013; Dietrich
et al., 2012; Krashes et al., 2014). Interestingly, although
CRFR1 marks half of AgRP neurons, we found AgRP+CRFR1+
projections in all the inspected terminal fields. The highest pro-
portion of AgRP+CRFR1+/AgRP projections was found in the
PVN and the LH, two regions which receive the densest AgRP
projections and that were shown to be sufficient for initiating a
feeding response by optogenetic stimuli (Betley et al., 2013).
Relatively intense projections were found in the BNST, an area
implicated in integrating and processing responses to stressful
challenges (Sparta et al., 2013). Interestingly, we observed
AgRP-CRFR1 fibers in the fusiform and parastrial parts of the
BNST, regions that were demonstrated to project to the
GABAergic neurons in the LH to evoke feeding (Jennings et al.,
2013). Given the PVN’s role in regulating food intake and auto-
nomic outflow, its reciprocal connections with AgRP neurons
are of special interest. AgRP neurons receive rich inhibitory
and excitatory synaptic input, where 70% of the excitatory inputs
originate within the hypothalamus, mainly from the PVN, DMH,
and VMH (Wang et al., 2015). Excitatory input was shown to
affect both basal and fasting-induced feeding (Liu et al., 2012).
PVN originating glutamatergic input arises from thyrotropin-
releasing hormone- and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide-expressing neurons (Krashes et al., 2014). Here
we add the observation that AgRP neurons are also innervated
by CRF neurons, suggesting that various stressors may affect
the AgRP+CRFR1+ pathway.
Role of CRF Signaling in AgRP Neurons
The storing promoting signal transmitted by AgRP neurons con-
flicts with immediate catabolic requirements needed during
stress. In this light, the inhibitory action of CRF on AgRP+CRFR1+
neurons is perhaps not surprising. However, this inhibitory action
is exceptional in the CRF field, as it differs from well-known CRF
excitatory effects observed in different brain regions (Aldenhoff

 et al., 1983) such as the locus coeruleus (Valentino et al., 1983),
the dorsal raphe (Lowry et al., 2000), hypothalamic orexin neu-
rons (Winsky-Sommerer et al., 2004), and the ventral tegmental
area (VTA) (Wanat et al., 2008). To date, only one study has re-
ported a similar inhibitory effect of CRF. In that instance, CRF
decreased the Rin of neurons in the CeA (Rainnie et al., 1992).
Interestingly, a recent study showed that optogenetic activation
of PVN-CRF neurons failed to evoke excitatory post-synaptic
potentials in AgRP neurons (Krashes et al., 2014), ruling out a
functional innervation of AgRP neurons by glutamatergic PVN-
CRF neurons. The differences between this and our findings
may be reconciled by the neuromodulating nature of CRF, which
changes the excitability of neurons but does not directly activate
ionotropic receptors.
Our electrophysiological results further expand the repertoire
of CRF effects showing that CRF decreases AgRP neurons’
excitability by increasing the amplitude of the AHP. This effect re-
sembles that of AgRP neurons lacking O-GlcNAc transferase
(OGT), where AgRP neuronal excitability was inhibited through
modulation of voltage-dependent potassium channels (Ruan
et al., 2014).
Given the inhibitory effect of CRF on AgRP neurons, we spec-
ulated that the absence of CRF receptors in these neurons would
mimic an over-activated state that could alter energy homeosta-
sis because of increased intake or reduced energy expenditure.
With regard to food intake, it is important to note that although
AgRP neurons are both mandatory and sufficient for feeding
(Aponte et al., 2011; Luquet et al., 2005), several transgenic

 mice with alterations in key components of the melanocortin sys-
tem displayed similar food intake. For example, energy homeo-
stasis was altered in neither POMC- nor AgRP-specific insulin
receptor KO mice (Ko
¨ nner et al., 2007). Similarly, ablation of lep-
tin receptor from POMC neurons did not alter energy intake
(Balthasar et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2008). Additionally, overexpres-
sion of constitutive activated STAT3 in AgRP neurons led to lean-
ness, but not as a result of decreased food intake (Mesaros et al.,
2008). Also in the present study, the absence of an inhibitory ac-
tion on AgRP neurons did not affect the consummatory behavior
of the mice. This could be attributed to the regulatory nature of
the CRF system with effects not necessarily reflected under
basal conditions. Furthermore, deletion of CRFR1 occurs in
part of AgRP neurons and thus its effects may be masked by
the unmanipulated AgRP neuronal population.
Nevertheless, as expected, females lacking CRFR1 in AgRP
neurons exhibited a small but significant reduction in heat pro-
duction. This resembles mice lacking leptin receptor in AgRP
neurons, which had lower body temperature with unaltered
food intake (van de Wall et al., 2008). The unaltered body weight
in light of reduced heat production is puzzling and in the long
term is probably balanced by increased physical activity or
altered food intake, which was not captured during the measure-
ment window in the metabolic cages.

thermogenesis and HGP under cold or fasting conditions, respectively.

Cell Metabolism 23, 1185–1199, June 14, 2016
 The anabolic role of AgRP/NPY neurons goes beyond food
intake, as was effectively shown by hyperinsulinemia and
adiposity in paired fed NPY administered animals (Zarjevski
et al., 1993). The inhibitory effect NPY neurons pose on BAT ther-
mogenesis was demonstrated pharmacologically more than
20 years ago by central (Billington et al., 1991) or PVN-NPY
administration (Billington et al., 1994). Consistent with this,
mice in which NPY is expressed only in the Arc have reduced en-
ergy expenditure with lower BAT temperature mediated by
reduced expression of PVN-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Shi
et al., 2013). The higher sensitivity of mice lacking CRFR1 in
AgRP neurons to a cold environment and the reduced induction
of browning-related genes in the inguinal WAT supports the idea
of mimicking activated AgRP neurons. This is in line with studies
showing that AgRP administration decreases BAT temperature
(Brito et al., 2007) and that AgRP neuronal activation leads to
reduced browning of WAT (Ruan et al., 2014).
It was suggested that under cold conditions, FGF21, acting
through b-Klotho in the SCN, stimulates PVN-CRF neurons to
induce sympathetic activation (Owen et al., 2014). FGF21 plays
a critical role in BAT thermogenesis and in the recruitment of
brown-like adipocytes in WAT (Fisher et al., 2012). Our results
may be incorporated and add the CRF action on AgRP+CRFR1+
neurons, which concurrently reduces AgRP-derived inhibitory
tone to allow appropriate sympathetic activation.
Remarkably, we revealed a role of CRFR1 in AgRP neurons in
regulating fasting glucose levels by influencing HGP. Endoge-
nous glucose production, primarily by the liver, is an important
mechanism for maintaining fasting serum glucose levels (Saltiel,
2001). The PVN plays a key regulatory role in HGP induced by
sympathetic activation. Triiodothyronine administration to the
PVN increased HGP via sympathetic projections to the liver,
independently of circulating glucoregulatory hormones (Klieverik
et al., 2009). Furthermore, activation of NMDA receptors or
blockade of GABA receptors in the PVN induces HGP due pri-
marily to activation of the sympathetic input to the liver. This in-
duction was shown to depend on removal of GABAergic input to
the PVN (Kalsbeek et al., 2004). The GABAergic input was sug-
gested to originate from the SCN. Here we suggest that AgRP
neurons contribute further to this phenomenon by delivering
GABAergic input to sympathetic preautonomic neurons in the
PVN, resulting in an increased HGP. This effect of Arc-CRFR1
is complementary to the counter-regulatory enhancing effect
described for VMH-CRFR1 during acute hypoglycemia (Cheng
et al., 2007). Overall, activation of the CRFR1 system acts
through several mechanisms in different hypothalamic nuclei
and aims to defend blood glucose levels.
Interestingly, although the CRF action on electrophysiological
properties of AgRP+CRFR1+ neurons was similar in males and
females, the main differences we found between AgRPDCRFR1
and control mice were observed only in females. The Arc and
AgRP neurons in particular were not associated previously
with sexual dimorphism. However, several studies specifically
manipulating AgRP neurons provided results obtained from
conditional female mice only. For example, ablation of AgRP-
VTA pathway increased the development of drug-associated
preference in females (Dietrich et al., 2012). Similarly, O-GlcNAc
signaling in AgRP neurons was shown to be required for the
regulation of WAT browning by fasting and ghrelin, but only re-
sults from female mice lacking OGT in AgRP neurons were
presented (Ruan et al., 2014). Interestingly, a sex-specific
phenotype was observed in females lacking leptin receptor in
POMC neurons, which, as in AgRPDCRFR1 mice, exhibited
reduced heat production with unaltered food intake (Shi et al.,
2008). Likewise, females lacking STAT3 from POMC neurons
have a stronger phenotype with a larger reduction in Pomc
expression (Xu et al., 2007). These phenotypes could also
stem from POMC-originated AgRP neurons that were manipu-
lated (i.e., the same neurons we manipulated in this study).
Moreover, in the present study, the sex-specific phenotype
could also be attributed to sexual differences in the stress
response. Estrogen receptor a is not expressed by AgRP neu-
rons (Olofsson et al., 2009); still, estrogen directly stimulates the
CRF promoter and potentiates norepinephrine actions (Vamva-
kopoulos and Chrousos, 1993, 1994). In this context, it is
important to note that within each sex, the differences are
independent of HPA function and of GC action, which were
unaltered.
Stress-related pathologies might be alleviated by CRFR1 an-
tagonists. Hypoglycemia and reduced thermogenesis, which
may lead to obesity, are potential side effects that emerge
from the present study because of blockage of Arc-CRFR1.
The capacity to block Arc-CRFR1 should also be examined for
compounds designed to antagonize peripheral CRF action
because of the close proximity to the median eminence lacking
an intact blood-brain barrier. This should be considered particu-
larly in women.
From an evolutionary point of view, an organism should have
a stronger signal favoring food consumption than satiation in
order to survive times with limited access to food. This notion
is supported by the observation that a portion of AgRP neurons
evolved from neurons with an opposite action. The higher
proportion of orexigenic neurons requires governing mecha-
nisms to ensure that other needs will be fulfilled as well.
CRFR1 presence in a subpopulation of AgRP neurons provides
the organism with such a regulatory tool, acting as a gatekeeper,
which assists the organism in recruiting its resources for survival
purposes.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal Care
Mice were housed and handled in a pathogen-free, temperature-controlled
(22�C ± 1�C) mouse facility on a reverse 12/12 hr light/dark cycle, with lights
switched on at 10 p.m. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
The Weizmann Institute of Science approved all procedures. Animals were
fed a regular chow diet (2018 Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet). Animals
were given ad libitum access to food and water. Food was withdrawn only if
required for an experiment.
Immunohistological Analysis
Animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA). Brains were post-fixated with 30% sucrose solution in 4% PFA.
Fixed brains were serially sectioned (30 mm) and divided into three sets. For
quantification, at least two mice were used, and from each mouse a complete
set was immunostained and analyzed. Briefly, sections were incubated in
blocking solution (20% horse serum, 0.3% Triton in PBS) for 1 hr to prevent
nonspecific binding of the antibody. Next, sections were incubated overnight
at room temperature with the primary antibody in PBS containing 2% horse
serum and 0.3% Triton. Following PBS washes, sections were incubated for
Cell Metabolism 23, 1185–1199, June 14, 2016

 1 hr at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories). Sections were washed with PBS and then
mounted on slides.
The following antibodies were used: GFP, PSD95, and mCherry (1:250,
1:500, and 1:1,000, respectively; Abcam); ACTH (1:1,000; DAKO); AgRP
(1:200; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals); Tyrosin Hydroxylase (1:1,000; Millipore);
CRF and SST (both 1:1,000; kindly provided by the late Professor Wylie
Vale); pSTAT3 (1:250; Cell Signaling Technology); and c-fos (1:1,000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology).
The M.O.M. staining kit (Vector Laboratories) was used when the primary
antibody was of mouse origin.
Immunohistochemical staining for UCP1 on BAT was carried out using
paraffin sections with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase (avidin biotin complex
method; Vector Laboratories) using the rabbit anti-Ucp1 Ab (Abcam). Sections
were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin.
Image Analysis
Images were captured using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510 and
LSM700). For quantification of AgRP-CRFR1 colocalization, and for assessing
pSTAT3, a complete set from each mouse was imaged at 2 mm intervals. For
the projections analysis, images were captured at 633 magnification in Z sec-
tions of 1 mm intervals. For each terminal field two to six images were analyzed
from at least two males and two females. A researcher blind to the slice origin
performed quantification of the projections as well as of leptin-responsive neu-
rons using IMMARIS software.
Metabolic Studies
Indirect calorimetry, food and water intake, and locomotor activity were
measured using
the Labmaster
system
(TSE-Systems),
as previously
described (Kuperman et al., 2010). Food deprivation was initiated 3 hr after
the beginning of the dark phase, and the refeeding period started at the begin-
ning of the subsequent dark phase.
Body Temperature Measurements
Mice were implanted with an Implantable Programmable Temperature and
Identification Transponder (IPTT-300; Bio Medic Data Systems) under isoflur-
ane anesthesia. Body temperature data were obtained using a SP-6005 reader
(Bio Medic Data Systems).
Statistical Analyses
Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed us-
ing repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc t tests or
Student’s t tests as appropriate, using Prism software (GraphPad Software).
