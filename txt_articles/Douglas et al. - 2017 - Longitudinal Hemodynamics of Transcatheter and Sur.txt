IMPORTANCE Use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis
is growing rapidly. However, to our knowledge, the durability of these prostheses is
incompletely defined.
OBJECTIVE To determine the midterm hemodynamic performance of balloon-expandable
transcatheter heart valves.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this study, we analyzed core laboratory–generated
data from echocardiograms of all patients enrolled in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter
Valves (PARTNER) 1 Trial with successful TAVR or surgical AVR (SAVR) obtained
preimplantation and at 7 days, 1 and 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years postimplantation.
Patients from continued access observational studies were included for comparison.
INTERVENTIONS Successful implantation after randomization to TAVR vs SAVR (PARTNER 1A;
TAVR, n = 321; SAVR, n = 313), TAVR vs medical treatment (PARTNER 1B; TAVR, n = 165), and
continued access (TAVR, n = 1996). Five-year echocardiogram data were available for 424
patients after TAVR and 49 after SAVR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Death or reintervention for aortic valve structural
indications, measured using aortic valve mean gradient, effective orifice area, Doppler
velocity index, and evidence of hemodynamic deterioration by reintervention, adverse
hemodynamics, or transvalvular regurgitation.
RESULTS Of 2795 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 84.5 (7.1) years, and 1313 (47.0%)
were female. Population hemodynamic trends derived from nonlinear mixed-effects models
showed small early favorable changes in the first few months post-TAVR, with a decrease of
−2.9 mm Hg in aortic valve mean gradient, an increase of 0.028 in Doppler velocity index, and
an increase of 0.09 cm2 in effective orifice area. There was relative stability at a median
follow-up of 3.1 (maximum, 5) years. Moderate/severe transvalvular regurgitation was noted
in 89 patients (3.7%) after TAVR and increased over time. Patients with SAVR showed no
significant changes. In TAVR, death/reintervention was associated with lower ejection
fraction, stroke volume index, and aortic valve mean gradient up to 3 years, with no
association with Doppler velocity index or valve area. Reintervention occurred in 20 patients
(0.8%) after TAVR and in 1 (0.3%) after SAVR and became less frequent over time.
Reintervention was caused by structural deterioration of transcatheter heart valves in only 5
patients. Severely abnormal hemodynamics on echocardiograms were also infrequent and
not associated with excess death or reintervention for either TAVR or SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This large, core laboratory–based study of transcatheter heart
valves revealed excellent durability of the transcatheter heart valves and SAVR. Abnormal
findings in individual patients, suggestive of valve thrombosis or structural deterioration,
were rare in this protocol-driven database and require further investigation.

ranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe
and effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis.1-3
However, given the relatively recent introduction of
transcatheter heart valves (THV), to our knowledge, data on
their durability are sparse. Late deterioration of surgically im-
planted bioprosthetic valves is well described, with the re-
duced need for anticoagulation compared with mechanical
valves seen as an acceptable tradeoff for potential
reintervention.4,5 While this risk vs benefit equation may be
especially appealing in the elderly population currently re-
ceiving TAVRs,6 reports of early leaflet thickening and pos-
sible valve thrombosis demand further investigation.7-9

alsoperformedinpatientswithsurgicalbioprostheticaorticvalve
replacement (SAVR) in the PARTNER 1 Trial.
Methods
The PARTNER 1 Trial consisted of 3 cohorts: PARTNER 1A, or
high risk, which randomized patients to either TAVR or SAVR
(TAVR, n = 348; SAVR, n = 351); 1B, or inoperable, which ran-
domized to either medical treatment or TAVR (n = 179); and
continued access (TAVR, n = 2040). The trial protocol
(Supplement 1) was approved by all participating institu-
tional review boards, and all patients provided written in-
formed consent (eAppendix in Supplement 2). Patients re-
ceived the first-generation SAPIEN THV device. Trial details
have been previously published.1,2,10-13
ThisreportincludesallsuccessfulTAVRs(deviceimplanta-
tion as randomized/assigned) in all 3 groups (n = 2482) and all
successfulSAVRs(n = 313)(eFigure1inSupplement2).Protocol-
specified echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and post-
implantationintervalsofapproximately7days,1and6months,
and1,2,3,4,and5years.Patientswithoutanypostimplantation

up(Figure1).Allechocardiogramdatawereanalyzedbyasingle
corelaboratoryfollowingbestpracticesforrandomizedtrials,14
with demonstrated excellent reproducibility in this data set.15
Echocardiograms were analyzed according to standard
practices as previously described14 and included peak and
mean aortic valve gradients, effective orifice area (EOA), and
Doppler velocity index (DVI) to evaluate valve systolic hemo-
dynamics and transvalvular aortic regurgitation (AR). The rel-
evant clinical end points are all-cause death and aortic valve
reintervention due to structural deterioration.
Statistical Analysis
Averagetemporaltrendsinpostprocedureandfollow-uptrans-
thoracic echocardiograms were analyzed longitudinally, ac-
counting for both the temporal pattern and the variability both
among patients and within each patient’
s sequence of mea-
surements. A temporal decomposition nonlinear mixed-
effects model16 was used to resolve a number of time phases
on mean response and to estimate shaping parameters for each
phase. We assumed that there was no informative censoring
(ie, missing data were missing at random). Longitudinal non-
linearregression17forrepeatedmeasurements18(SASPROCNL-
MIXED;SASInstitute)wasusedtoimplementthetemporalde-
composition model. We used bootstrap method19 to estimate
the SE of the estimate of the mean response at selected times.
Estimates at different points were then compared using z test.
To descriptively assess the association between echocar-
diogram measures and composite event (death or reinterven-
tion), we considered average observed echocardiogram mea-
surementsstratifiedbypresenceorabsenceofcompositeevent
within 6-month intervals. Because not all patients had echo-
cardiogram measurements just before an event within a given
interval, for this analysis, only the last echocardiogram obser-
vation was carried forward to the end of each 6-month inter-
val. This is similar to the last observation carried forward ap-
proach generally applied when one encounters missing
longitudinal observations in longitudinal data analyses,20
which assumes that the hemodynamic measurements would
have been stable during this period.
Continuous variables are summarized as mean (SD). Com-
parisons were made using Wilcoxon rank sum nonparametric
test. Categorical data are described using frequencies and per-
centages. Comparisons were made using χ2 test or Fisher ex-
act test when frequency was less than 5. Patient-specific echo-
cardiogram profiles are graphed with straight lines connecting
observed contiguous echocardiographic estimates (eFigure 2
in Supplement 2). Asymmetric 95% CIs of the estimated tem-
poraltrendoflongitudinalresponseswereobtainedusingboot-
strap percentile method.19 All analyses were performed using
SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R soft-
ware version 3.2.3 (The R Foundation). All P values were
2-tailed, and statistical significance was set at P < .05.
Key Points
Question What is the durability of transcatheter heart valves and
is this similar to surgical bioprostheses?
Findings In this analysis of data from the PARTNER Trial,
population hemodynamic trends showed early favorable
hemodynamic changes after transcatheter aortic valve
replacement implantation, with midterm stability at a median
follow-up of 3.1 (maximum, 5) years, and no significant changes in
surgical aortic valve replacement. Reintervention and severely
abnormal hemodynamics on echocardiograms were infrequent
and not associated with excess death in patients after either
transcatheter aortic valve replacement or surgical aortic valve
replacement.
Meaning There is longitudinal durability of both transcatheter and
surgical aortic valve replacements, with rare findings of adverse
hemodynamics or valve deterioration.

 Results
Among the 2482 patients who received TAVR, 2404 patients
(96.9%) had at least 1 postimplantation aortic valve mean gra-
dient recorded, with a total of 10 746 echocardiograms. Their
mean (SD) age was 84.5 (7.2) years, and 1179 (47.5%) were fe-
male (Table 1). Comorbidities were common, and all patients
had severe aortic stenosis, with a mean (SD) aortic valve peak
gradient of 71.3 (22.4) mm Hg, an aortic valve mean gradient
of44.0(14.3)mmHg,andanaorticvalveareaof0.65(0.19)cm2.
A total of 1277 of 2449 patients (52.1%) received a 23-mm di-
ameter THV and 1172 (47.9%) received a 26-mm diameter THV;
the implantation technique was transapical in 1056 of 2482 pa-
tients (42.5%) and transfemoral in 1426 (57.5%). Baseline char-
acteristicsweresimilarintheSAVRcohort(Table1).Medianfol-
low-up in the TAVR cohort was 3.1 years, and the mean (SD)
follow-upwas2.9(1.8)years.Overallsurvivalandfreedomfrom
reintervention in the TAVR cohort at 5 years was 34% by non-
adjusted parametric analysis. Median follow-up in SAVR was
3.2years,andthemean(SD)follow-upwas2.9(1.9)years.Over-
all survival and freedom from reintervention in SAVR at 5 years
was 37% by nonadjusted parametric analysis.
Five-yearechocardiographicdatawereavailablein424pa-
tients who received TAVR. Comparison of paired, serial echo-
cardiogram data in 399 patients showed favorable changes
compared with baseline on first postimplantation study, with
slight adverse changes at 5 years (Table 2). Paired baseline and
lateechocardiographicdatainthe49patientswith5-yearecho-
cardiograms in the SAVR cohort (serial echocardiogram data
in 42 patients) are shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Modeled Population Hemodynamic Trends
The overall TAVR population trend in aortic valve mean gra-
dient revealed small changes, including a reduction from 12.1
(95% CI, 11.6-12.5) to 9.2 (95% CI, 9.06-9.41) mm Hg (P < .001)
in the first few months postimplantation with a slight in-
crease thereafter to 10.1 (95% CI, 9.80-10.5) mm Hg (P < .001)

 at 5 years (Figure 2A) (Table 3). Similar changes were noted in
EOA and DVI (Figure 2B and C) (Tables 3). Patients with 23-mm
diameter and 26-mm diameter prostheses displayed similar
patterns (albeit with higher gradients and smaller DVIs and
EOAs in the smaller THVs), as did those with transapical vs
transfemoral implantation routes (Table 3). The SAVR popu-
lationdidnotshowanysignificanthemodynamicchangesover
time (Table 3) (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).
To address the possible clinical significance of these he-
modynamic trends in TAVR, we assessed vital status and free-
dom from reintervention at each 6-month period throughout
follow-upandthencomparedhemodynamicdatafromlasttrial
echocardiogram (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). The relation-
ship between the last mean gradient and event-free survival
changed over time, such that mean gradients were higher
among survivors for up to 3 years of follow-up but similar in
survivors and nonsurvivors thereafter. In contrast, there was
notime-varyingassociationbetweeneitherlastEOAorDVIand
event-free survival. Because these findings suggested a rela-
tionship between adverse events and low-flow/low-output
states, we also compared ejection fraction and stroke volume
indexbyevent-freesurvival.Ejectionfractionshowedthesame
time-varying relationship as mean gradient, while stroke vol-
ume index was uniformly higher in event-free survivors than
in those with either death or aortic valve reintervention. The
SAVR cohort was too small to perform a similar analysis.
Transvalvular Aortic Regurgitation
Eighty-nine patients (3.6%) in the TAVR cohort had moderate
transvalvular AR and 6 patients (0.2%) had severe transvalvu-
lar AR on at least 1 echocardiogram during the trial, for a total
of 89 patients (3.7%) with moderate or severe AR. Of the 6 with
severeAR,4died(3ofnoncardiovascularcausesand1ofanun-
known cause), including the 3 patients included in the abnor-
mal hemodynamics count. Of those with echocardiograms at
postimplantation and 5 years, 16 patients had moderate or se-
vere AR at 5 years compared with 3 at postimplantation. No pa-
tients in the SAVR cohort had severe transvalvular AR during
follow-up (2 patients had moderate AR).

larly, severely abnormal hemodynamic data in individual pa-
tients, which might be suggestive of valve thrombosis or ste-
nosis, were rare in this protocol-driven database. However,
echocardiogram data suggest a slight hemodynamic deterio-
rationandincreasingARprevalence.Nevertheless,anearlysig-
nal for deterioration also noted in prior reports22 does not ap-

after SAVR. Together, these data demonstrate excellent dura-
bility of THV, comparable with surgical prostheses and con-
sistent with reports in smaller cohorts (including a small sub-
set of the current patients23) or those with shorter follow-up.
Because of the very large population, we were able to cre-
ate statistically robust models of longitudinal hemodynamic
trends in the TAVR cohort. The early favorable changes have
been reported previously in patients after SAVRs24 and were
also seen in this study. These changes suggest the possibility
of early remodeling of the valves and/or postprocedural
changes in loading conditions or physiology, such as left ven-
tricular function. The possibility of very early valve thrombo-
sis within days of implantation, as has been reported,7-9 fol-
lowed by short-term resolution, cannot be excluded given our
data’
s limited temporal resolution. The observation of rela-
tivestabilityto5yearsisreassuring.Nonetheless,furtherevalu-
ation for a longer follow-up period is warranted, as most re-
ports suggest that bioprosthetic dysfunction is minimal until
8 to 10 years after implantation.4,5
An important word of caution arises from the Valve-
in-Valve International Data Registry,22 which reported a time
to intervention for bioprosthetic valve failure of only 9 (inter-
quartile range, 6-12) years. Structural valve deterioration is not
typically an acute process, and the development of stenosis
(40% of patients), transvalvular regurgitation (30% of pa-
tients), or both stenosis and regurgitation (30% of patients)
would presumably begin well before the need for interven-
tion. Thus, the small but significant changes in EOA and DVI
as well as the increase in the incidence of moderate/severe
transvalvular AR between discharge and 5 years is important,
albeitprobablyexpectedforanytissuebioprosthesis,andman-
dates continued surveillance.
Although the patients in the SAVR cohort in the
PARTNER Trial cannot be compared directly with the
pooled TAVR data because these groups were not random-
ized, the not-dissimilar findings are reassuring, especially
given the differences between the procedures (retention of
leaflets in TAVR) and the devices (presence of sewing rings
in SAVR). Further, the longitudinal changes we observed are
similar in magnitude and direction to that reported in 2 of
the few other core laboratory–based studies of surgical bio-
prostheses, both conducted in elderly populations with a
high prevalence of comorbid conditions.25,26
Much attention has focused on recent reports of valve
thrombosis and leaflet thickening, with incidence estimates
varying greatly depending on the timing and type of
assessments.7-9 While this appears to occur early after
implantation, it may be associated with later leaflet degen-
eration and/or pannus ingrowth, leading to structural
failure.27 Our finding of infrequent hemodynamic deteriora-
tion is reassuring, as it minimizes concerns regarding pos-
sible longer-term consequences of valve thrombosis. In con-
trast, the increasing incidence of transvalvular regurgitation
in TAVR is of concern.

 Finding associations between clinical events and preced-
ing adverse hemodynamic changes is difficult, given the
periodic nature of clinical trial surveillance assessments.
Although causal hemodynamic changes must precede an
event, they may occur nearly simultaneously or at least dur-
ing the same interval between assessments, making such
changes difficult to discern when comparing surveillance
hemodynamic data and subsequent events. To minimize this
problem, we compared the last hemodynamic measures
obtained in an event-free cohort vs one with death or rein-
tervention, finding that event-free survival was associated
with higher mean gradient and ejection fraction up to 3
years, but there was no relationship between DVI and EOA
and events at any point during follow-up. If events were
caused by valve dysfunction, mean gradients would be
lower in survivors and DVI and EOA higher, relationships
which were not observed. Instead, the constant association
between events and lower stroke volume index suggests that
low-flow/low-output states may be more closely associated
with morbidity than adverse valve hemodynamics. The
association of these distinct hemodynamic patterns with
death/reintervention cannot be proven but likely reflects a

 primary causative role for underlying or concomitant dis-
ease rather than valve deterioration.
Reintervention was quite rare in this TAVR cohort,
became less frequent over time, and was usually not due to
structural deterioration of THV. Unfortunately, protocol-
driven echocardiogram data were temporally distant and
uninformative, highlighting the critical importance of real-
time clinical data. Collection of such information in future
studies could aid considerably in finding associations
between hemodynamic changes and events.
Valve durability is an important and ongoing question,
and consensus guidelines have been developed to aid in its
detection. To our knowledge, the current VARC-2 cut points
for time-varying safety and mild aortic stenosis21 have not
been previously applied in a large patient cohort. We found
that they were commonly met by patients in both the TAVR
and SAVR cohorts, suggesting that they may not adequately
discriminate adverse changes. This is especially true for
decreases in EOA noted on subsequent echocardiograms,
which were found in one-third to one-half of patients. While
the known difficulty in accurately measuring left ventricu-
lar outflow track diameter (required for calculation of valve
area using the continuity equation) may introduce substan-
tial variability, the use of DVI, a dimensionless ratio of the
integral of flow velocities above and below the valve that
avoids the need for outflow tract measurement and controls
for high flow states such as regurgitation, offered only slight
improvement. While other investigators have offered vary-
ing cut points, including greater than 50% or a 10–mm Hg
increase in mean gradient,8, 27 variability in echo-
cardiogram data may be hard to distinguish from true
hemodynamic changes; either or both can arise from
physiologic changes (eg, anemia or reduced ventricular
function), deficiencies in image acquisition, and/or
inaccurate analysis (which should have been minimized in
this core laboratory–based study with excellent
reproducibility15). Future proposed parameters assessing
valvular dysfunction should be tested empirically in the
PARTNER Trial or other large data sets to ensure that they
provide the desired discrimination.
The VARC-2 criteria for severe stenosis were rarely met
by patients in either the TAVR or SAVR cohorts and were not
associated with an excess incidence of death or reinterven-
tion compared with the overall trial results. Importantly,
these criteria were designed to detect mild AS (from any
cause) during postimplantation surveillance and not to
define early structural valve deterioration. In this respect,
large changes in hemodynamics between echocardiograms
were infrequent and of unclear clinical significance.
Whether this is caused by inherent variability in echocardio-
gram findings, the temporal distance of adverse hemody-
namics from clinical events, absent hemodynamic changes
in patients with valve dysfunction (as has been reported
with valve thrombosis),7,9 or some other reason, our find-
ings suggest that annual surveillance echocardiography
after TAVR may not always provide the expected early
warning for valve deterioration in the first 5 years after
implantation.
Limitations
The PARTNER 1 Trial represents a unique and carefully
curated large data set, which, despite low event-free sur-
vival (34% at 5 years), yielded a robust patient cohort at 5
years, representing the entire trial rather than a substudy
population. Nevertheless, this is a small proportion of those
enrolled, largely owing to high mortality in this aged cohort.
Although survivorship bias may have affected our results,
with some deaths perhaps due to undetected valve deterio-
ration, the lack of adverse population trends in valve hemo-
dynamics or excess events in those individuals with outlier
echocardiogram findings mitigates these concerns. As TAVR
use broadens to younger and less comorbid populations,
long-term durability becomes increasingly important. To
this end, the timely collection and reporting of data estab-
lishing long-term durability beyond the 5 years reported in
this article is still needed.
As noted above, the protocol-mandated surveillance
echocardiograms were performed only at infrequent times
that were not necessarily related to clinical events. While
not ideal, this would be true in any prospective study design
and can be mitigated by rigorous clinical data collected at
the time of adverse events. The hemodynamic trend data
were extrapolated from the actual dates of echocardiogram
performance, which varied by patient regardless of the
protocol-specified duration postimplantation. Further, early
changes from implantation to 3 months were modeled on
population trends over this interval, as only 30-day and
6-month echocardiograms were mandated.
Although all echocardiograms were interpreted centrally
with strict quality controls, our results may still be limited by
poor image quality and/or completeness, as late follow-up
echocardiogramswereoftenobtainedinthecommunityrather
than at the certified enrolling sites. The small number of pa-
tients with hemodynamic deterioration precluded modeling
of predictors or associated factors. Additionally, paravalvular
leak is a significant complication of TAVR, especially in the first
generationofvalves,withsignificantprognosticimplications.28
Finally, these data apply only to the first-generation SAPIEN
prostheses and not to later, more current iterations of this de-
vice or to other THV designs. In addition, only 23-mm- and 26-
mm-diameter valves were available, and device choice was
made based on single-plane linear systolic annular dimen-
sions; thus, the effect of sizing parameters cannot be as-
sessed accurately given the current methods of sizing the THV.
Conclusions
This large, core laboratory evaluation of 2482 patients
receiving TAVR and 313 receiving SAVR in the PARTNER 1
Trial demonstrates excellent longitudinal durability of the
SAPIEN THV using both population hemodynamic trends as
well as case reviews of reintervention and patients with
large adverse changes between echocardiograms. Abnormal
findings in individual patients suggestive of valve thrombo-
sis or structural deterioration were rare in this protocol-
driven database and require further investigation.

Will Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Echo Surgical
Aortic Valve Replacement Durability?
Stephen H. Little, MD; Michael J. Reardon, MD
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolu-
tionized the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis
worldwide. This has largely been propelled by data from land-
mark randomized studies.1-6
These studies have shown
thatTAVRissuperiortomedi-
cal therapy for the treatment
of symptomatic severe aortic
stenosis in patients at ex-
treme risk in whom surgery is not an option.1,2 Compared with
surgery, TAVR is noninferior or superior in high-risk patients
and noninferior in intermediate-risk patients.3-6 Random-
ized trials are now enrolling low-risk patients.
For TAVR to be an acceptable alternative to surgery as we
move down the risk and age scale, it must be at least as good
as surgery for mortality, morbidity, quality of life, patient ac-
ceptance, achieved valve hemodynamics, and durability. Ran-
domized data have demonstrated that for mortality, hemody-
namics, and quality of life, TAVR is noninferior or superior to
surgery.3-6 Although we have only experiential data, most
would agree that patient acceptance of TAVR is superior to that
of surgery. That leaves us with morbidity and durability to ad-
dress. The initial randomized trial of high-risk patients,
PARTNER IA,3 found TAVR to have twice the neurologic in-
jury rate compared with surgery and was a cause of signifi-
cant concern. All the subsequent landmark randomized trials
collected severity of neurologic injury prospectively, and all
show TAVR to be noninferior or superior to surgery.4-6 Stroke
remains a devastating complication in patients after TAVR and
SAVR but is not more common in TAVR. Paravalvular regur-
gitation and pacemakers remain a problem with a varied in-
cidence between different valves but show steady improve-
ment with design and implantation improvements. Thus,
durability remains our biggest unknown and is a major con-
cern as we move to younger, healthier patients who may also
be appropriate candidates for surgery and who clearly have a
longer predicted life span than the patients enrolled in the ex-
treme-, high-, and intermediate-risk trials.
There has been a steady shift over the last 2 decades in sur-
gery toward the use of biologic valves as opposed to mechani-
cal valves for AVR. This is based on improving longevity of tis-
sue surgical valves and patients’desire to avoid long-term an-
ticoagulation. Surgical data, both from propensity matched
studiesandmeta-analyses,suggestthatthereisnosurvivaldif-
ference after age 50 years between mechanical and tissue
valves.7,8 The trade-off has been increased bleeding with me-
chanical valves vs structural valve deterioration (SVD) and the
potential need for reintervention with biologic valves. The sur-
