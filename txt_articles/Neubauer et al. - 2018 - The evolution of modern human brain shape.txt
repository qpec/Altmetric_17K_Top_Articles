The evolution of modern human brain shape
Simon Neubauer,* Jean-Jacques Hublin, Philipp Gunz
Modern humans have large and globular brains that distinguish them from their extinct Homo relatives. The
characteristic globularity develops during a prenatal and early postnatal period of rapid brain growth critical for neural
wiring and cognitive development. However, it remains unknown when and how brain globularity evolved and how it
relates to evolutionary brain size increase. On the basis of computed tomographic scans and geometric morphometric
analyses, we analyzed endocranial casts of Homo sapiens fossils (N = 20) from different time periods. Our data show
that, 300,000 years ago, brain size in early H. sapiens already fell within the range of present-day humans. Brain shape,
however, evolved gradually within the H. sapiens lineage, reaching present-day human variation between about
100,000 and 35,000 years ago. This process started only after other key features of craniofacial morphology appeared
modern and paralleled the emergence of behavioral modernity as seen from the archeological record. Our findings are
consistent with important genetic changes affecting early brain development within the H. sapiens lineage since the
origin of the species and before the transition to the Later Stone Age and the Upper Paleolithic that mark full behav-
ioral modernity.
INTRODUCTION
Our ancestors’ cognitive and behavioral abilities and the underlying
brain morphology and function are critical for understanding the evo-
lution of modern humans. Multiple lines of evidence from paleoanthro-
pology, archeology, and genetics are informative about the evolution of
brain and behavior in the Homo sapiens lineage, but there is no consen-
sus about the tempo and mode of these biological and behavioral
changes. In the absence of fossilized brains, we can study internal casts
of the bony braincase. These endocasts approximate outer brain mor-
phology because the brain, meninges, and cranial bones interact in an
integrated and highly coordinated way during early development (1).
Present-day modern humans have globular brains and globular endo-
casts with steep frontal, bulging parietal, and enlarged, rounded cerebel-
lar areas. Together with small and retracted faces, this globularity
characterizes the modern human skull (Fig. 1) (2, 3). In contrast, Nean-
dertals and other archaic Homo individuals have anterior-posteriorly
elongated endocasts (4).
Ontogenetic data show that the adult endocranial shape differences
between H. sapiens and Neandertals develop prenatally or during a peri-
natal globularization phase found only in the former group (5–8). De-
velopmental globularization therefore occurs in a period of high brain
growth rates and is largely driven by the brain (1). A large body of lit-
erature including clinical evidence shows that the tempo and mode of
brain growth during this period are related to neural wiring underlying
brain function and behavioral capabilities (6, 7, 9–11). Developmental
globularization leading to more globular brains in modern humans
(6, 7) and differences in early brain growth rates leading to slightly larger
adult brains in Neandertals (12) are consequently interesting in the dis-
cussion of brain evolution and related behavioral changes. Endocranial
shape changes during later ontogeny (that is, after the eruption of the
deciduous dentition) are similar among present-day humans, Neander-
tals, and great apes with only some adjustments in the amount of shape
changes (5–8, 13, 14). This shared segment of the ontogenetic pattern is
thought to reflect interactions between the brain and the face, because
the latter continues to grow after adult brain size has been achieved
(5, 13–16).
Hominin fossils from Jebel Irhoud (Morocco) that are associated
with Middle Stone Age artifacts dated to around 300,000 years ago
(17) display key features of modern human craniodental morphology
including facial, mandibular, and dental characters comparable to later
H. sapiens fossils or even present-day humans (18–20) as well as mod-
ern timing of dental development that suggests a human-like paced life
history (21). Given these craniodental similarities, the Jebel Irhoud fos-
sils are either interpreted as the currently earliest known members of the
H. sapiens lineage (3, 20, 22) or as part of an ancestral population related
to the origin of H. sapiens (23). However, the braincases of the Jebel
Irhoud fossils are not globular (19, 20, 24). This demonstrates some in-
dependence of facial and neurocranial evolution in spite of important
integration between these cranial modules via the cranial base (14–16).
Together with other African fossils such as Omo Kibish [dated to
around 195,000 years ago (25)], the Jebel Irhoud specimens force us
to rethink the evolution of our species. Here, we therefore (i) investigate
when and how the endocranial globularity typical of present-day mod-
ern humans emerged, (ii) analyze how this process is related to evolu-
tionary brain size increase (4), and (iii) explore potential links between
the evolution of the brain and genetic as well as behavioral changes.
Contrasting interpretations of the archeological record either see a
rapid emergence of behavioral modernity at the transition to the Upper
Paleolithic in Europe and the Later Stone Age in Africa possibly related
to a mutation and consequently to neural changes (“human revolution”
model) (26), or a gradual emergence as documented by the African
Middle Stone Age without a specific biological correlate triggered by
factors such as environmental changes or demographic developments
(27). Features used to mark behavioral modernity range from worked
bone, ornaments, pigments, and complex multicomponent lithic tech-
nologies to materialindicatorsof manipulations of symbols and abstract
thought such as unequivocal art. Some of those features are not exclu-
sively known from modern human sites, and others are documented sys-
tematically only since the Upper Paleolithic (28).
Ancient DNA of archaicHomo representativesand H. sapiensfossils
revealed derived genetic features that were fixed in H. sapiens after the
population split from the clade including Neandertals and Denisovans
more than 500,000 years ago (29–33). These genetic data suggest
positive selection within our lineage on genes important for brain
function and behavior and, especially, the development of the nervous
system [for example, genes involved in axonal and dendritic growth or

 synaptic transmission including NOVA1, SLITRK1, KATNA1,
LUZP1, ARHGAP32, ADSL, HTR2B, and CNTNAP2 (30)]. Another
example is FOXP2, a gene that is important for normal development of
speech and language. Although amino acid substitutions specific to
modern humans were also found in Neandertals, one substitution in
an intron of this gene that affects a binding site for a transcription factor
and likely alters the regulation of FOXP2 expression and associated be-
haviors is absent or polymorphic in Neandertals (31). On the other
hand, a recent analysis showed that Neandertal genetic material that
introgressed in the modern human lineage affects cranial and brain
morphology of present-day humans (34).
Here, we analyzed endocasts of H. sapiens fossils from different ge-
ologic time periods. Previous quantitative analyses used smaller samples
and were based on the endocranial midsagittal plane only (20), external
landmarks only on the posterior neurocranium (19), or a set of some
endocraniallandmarks (4, 24). Here, we used geometric morphometrics
based on three-dimensional coordinates of endocranial landmarks and
hundreds of curve and surface semilandmarks (5, 35–37) measured on
computed tomographic (CT) scans (fig. S1). We obtained landmark
data for 20 H. sapiens fossils (Table 1) that can be divided into three
groups according to geologic ages: (i) early H. sapiens from North
and East Africa that lived about 300,000 to 200,000 years ago and there-
fore document the morphology of the currently earliest known repre-
sentatives of our clade since the population split with Neandertals,
(ii) Levantine and East African individuals that lived about 130,000 to
100,000 years ago, and (iii) Upper Paleolithic and geologically younger
individuals that are about 35,000 to 10,000 years old. We compiled the
same data for comparative samples of cranially diverse present-day
humans from all over the world and archaic Homo representatives
(Neandertals, Middle Pleistocene H. heidelbergensis sensu lato, and
H. erectus sensu lato, as listed in Table 1) and computed Procrustes
shape variables (see Materials and Methods). Incomplete and distorted
fossils were reconstructed using established methods of computer-
assisted paleoanthropology [see Materials and Methods and previous
studies (36, 38, 39)].
RESULTS
Variation of endocranial shape
To exploreendocranialshape variation of theH. sapiensfossils, we com-
puted a between-group principal components analysis (bgPCA) of Pro-
crustes shape variables. This space spans from the ancestral H. erectus
shape to the derived shapesof Neandertals on the one handandpresent-
day humans on the other (Fig. 2 and fig. S2), according to the differ-
ences in species average endocranial shapes (fig. S3). The fuzzy borders
of group convex hulls illustrate the uncertainty introduced by the recon-
structions of incomplete fossils (see Materials and Methods). This re-
construction uncertainty does not alter the conclusions of our study.
A multivariate shape regression on geologic age within archaic Homo
individualsrevealsatemporaltrendfromAfricanH. erectus(H.ergaster)
via Asian H. erectus to Neandertals (explained shape variance: 29.2%;
P < 0.01). The Middle Pleistocene H. heidelbergensis sensu lato speci-
mens Kabwe and Petralona plot along this temporal trend.
The earliest members of the H. sapiens clade (geologic age group 1)
have endocranial shapes intermediate between H. erectus and Neandertals
and seem to be part of the archaic temporal trend. Individuals of geo-
logic age group 2 plot at the fringe of present-day humans, whereas the
Upper Paleolithic and younger specimens (geologic age group 3)
overlap with present-day human variation. Given the geologic age spans
of age groups 2 and 3, the range of today’s shape variation is therefore
reached approximately between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago. H. sapiens
fossils from different geologic time periods therefore capture evolutionary
shape changes leading to the globular endocranial shape of present-day
humans. A multivariate regression of endocranial shape on geologic age
explains 21.9% of shape variance (P < 0.01) and corresponds to a change
fromanelongatedtoaglobularshape:Fromgeologicallyoldertoyounger
H.sapiens,the frontalareabecomestaller,theparietalareasbulge,theside
walls become parallel, and the occipital area becomes rounder and less
overhanging. Moreover, the cerebellum becomes relatively larger and
more bulging, the cranial base more flexed, and the temporal poles nar-
rower and oriented anterior-medially (Fig. 3 and movies S1 to S3). Color-
coding areas of size increase reveals that parietal bulging is not associated
with an increase of the parietal surface but that cerebellar bulging is
(Fig.3andfig.S4A).Bothprocessescontributetoincreasedglobularity.In
addition to the PCA and regression analysis, we also visualized evolution-
ary globularization in H. sapiens as changes between the mean shapes of
geologic age groups (fig. S4, B and C). Endocranial shape changes from
geologic age group 1 to geologic age group 2 are associated with size in-
crease in cerebellar and lateral parietotemporal areas. In the second step
(geologicagegroup2to3),shapechangesareassociatedwithsizeincrease
primarily in cerebellar and occipital areas. The shape changes associated
with both steps contribute to globularization in H. sapiens. The trajectory
from H. erectus to Neandertals reveals a contrasting pattern: The cere-
brum increases in size in relationship to the cranial base (fig. S4, D and E).
Notably, the overarching pattern of globularization in H. sapiens is
not related to geographic variation but represents a general temporal
trend:TheNorthandEastAfricanspecimensofgeologicagegroup1have
similar endocranial shapes, the East African specimen Laetoli Hominid
(L.H.) 18 clusters with the contemporaneous Levantine individuals
(geologic age group2),theHofmeyrendocastfromSouthAfrica,andthe
Levantine individual Ohalo II H2 group with the European specimens
of comparable ages (geologic age group 3) (fig. S2).
Relationship of endocranial shape and size
To explore whether globularization helped overcome constraints on en-
cephalization, we computed a bgPCA in form space that allows inter-
preting allometric relationships. The first PC of form space (Fig. 4 and
fig. S5) is highly correlated to size variation (R = 0.98) and, as expected,
separates H. erectus from Neandertals and present-day humans. Al-
though endocranial form of H. sapiens fossils demonstrates a temporal
trend toward present-day human variation, their size variation overlaps
among all geologic age groups of H. sapiens fossils, as well as with the
size variation in present-day humans and Neandertals (Fig. 4 and fig. S5).
This finding is mirrored by endocranial volume estimates of our fossil

and a Neandertal from La Chapelle-aux-Saints (right, in red). Endocasts are shown

 reconstructions (Table 1). The endocranial volumes of early H. sapiens
individuals (Jebel Irhoud 1, 1375 ± 6 ml; Jebel Irhoud 2, 1467 ± 6 ml;
Omo 2, 1491 ± 4 ml) fall within the range of our samples of present-day
humans (mean, 1328 ml; SD, 164 ml) and Neandertals (mean, 1450 ml;
SD, 189 ml) and are considerably larger than those of our H. erectus
sample (mean, 919 ml; SD, 108 ml).
In archaic Homo individuals, endocranial size and geologic age are
negatively correlated (R = −0.84), and size explains a similar amount of
variance as geologic age (multivariate shape regression on the logarithm
of centroid size; explained shape variance: 24.4%; P < 0.01). Visualiza-
tions of this allometric regression (figs. S4, D and E, and S6, and movies
S4 to S6) reveal shape changes that differ from the temporal trend with-
in H. sapiens in an important way: Overall, archaic Homo individuals
maintain an elongated endocast along the allometric regression. With
increases in endocranial size, the cerebrum gets enlarged on top of the
brain stem and cerebellum.
In contrast to archaic Homo, geologic age and size are not correlated
in H. sapiens fossils (R = −0.02), and size does not account for endo-
cranial shape variation (multivariate shape regression on the logarithm
of centroid size; explained shape variance: 4.8%; P = 0.99). This finding
is also expressed by nearly orthogonal regression lines of the temporal
and the allometric trend in the first two PCs of form space (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
The brain of early H. sapiens
In line with genetic data (32) that suggest a population split between
modern humans on the one hand and Neandertals and Denisovans
on the other more than 500,000 years ago, we view H. sapiens as an
evolving lineage with deep African roots. Our results, in combination
with evidence from craniofacial morphology (18–20, 22) and dental de-
velopment (21), suggest that modern human brain shape was not
established at the origin of our species together with other key features
of craniodental morphology: Our analyses confirm that early H. sapiens
[geologic age group 1, that is, not only Jebel Irhoud individuals but also
the geologically younger, presumably 195,000-year-old (25) specimen
Omo 2] did not have globular brains (19, 20, 24). Instead, they had
shapes intermediate between H. erectus and Neandertals. Yet, the size
of their brain was already substantially larger than that in H. erectus

 (at the upper boundary of H. heidelbergensis sensu lato) and in the range
of geologically younger H. sapiens fossils and present-day humans (40).
We therefore suggest that early members of the H. sapiens lineage ini-
tially attained large brains via the archaic allometric pathway (4) and
only subsequently diverged from this pattern to evolve the globular brain
characteristic of present-day humans. Some authors have challenged the
interpretation of the Jebel Irhoud hominins as early H. sapiens (20) and
view them instead as ancestral to H. sapiens (23). However, we note that
our interpretation is robust against the species label attached to the Jebel
Irhoud fossils (and by extension also to Omo 2) and that later H. sapiens
individuals from geologic age group 2 still do not exhibit present-day
human-like brain globularity(see Discussion below).Two fossilsalso related
to the origin of our species [Omo 1 and the approximately 260,000-year-old
Florisbadspecimen(41)]areunfortunatelytoo fragmentary to be included
in the analysis.
Gradual globularization within H. sapiens
Indisputable H. sapiens individuals from about 130,000 to 100,000 years
ago (geologic age group 2) have more globular brains than the earliest
H.sapiensfossilsandaremoresimilarto,butstilldifferentfrom,present-day
humans. H. sapiens individualsthat are youngerthan about 35,000years
(geologic age group3) overlapwiththe range of variation in present-day
humans.Ouranalysesthereforedemonstratethattheevolutionofmodern
human brain shape is characterized by directional and gradual changes
resulting in the typical globular modern human shape established
at some point after about 100,000 years ago and probably before
35,000 years ago. We expect that future analyses based on additional
fossil specimens filling the temporal gaps between our geologic age
groups will further elucidate the mode of evolutionary shape change
and help to pinpoint the exact time when present-day human brain
shape was established. Unfortunately, no CT data of the Herto skull
(BOU-VP-16/1) dated to about 160,000 years old (42) were available
for this study. If this specimen exhibits an endocranial shape
intermediate between the mean shapes of geologic age groups 1 and 2
(fig. S4, B and C), then this will further strengthen our hypothesis of a
gradual emergence of present-day human globularity.
Investigating brain shape changes as a two-step process between our
three geologic age groups suggests some variation in the overarching
gradual pattern of globularization. Although both steps include parietal
and cerebellar bulging, it is interesting to note that the first step (from
geologic age group 1 to geologic age group 2) includes only subtle shape
changes of brain regions associated with the anterior and middle cranial
fossae. Because this part of the cranial base acts as the interface between
the brain and the face, this suggests that the initial globularization was
driven by changes in brain organization and not by changes in facial size
and shape. The second step of globularization (from geologic age group
2 to 3) also comprises shape changes in these regions, suggesting that
integration of the endocranium with the face might have contributed to
endocranial globularization (14) but only in later phases of H. sapiens
evolution.
Implications of evolutionary globularization
Evolutionary brain globularization in H. sapiens corresponds to the
shape changes during the developmental globularization phase found
in present-day humans (5, 43). In light of the documented differences
between the ontogenetic patterns in present-day humans, Neandertals,
and great apes (5–8, 13, 14, 43), we suggest that this evolutionary glo-
bularization is linked to a gradual evolution of the developmental glo-
bularization phase and therefore caused by changes to perinatal brain
development.
Two features of this process stand out: parietal and cerebellar bul-
ging. Parietal areas are involved in orientation, attention, perception of
stimuli, sensorimotor transformations underlying planning, visuospa-
tialintegration,imagery,self-awareness,workingandlong-termmemory,
numerical processing, and tool use (44–49). Because parietal bulging is
not associated with an increase of outer parietal surface area [mirroring

 ontogeny (43)], it is likely that a size increase of regions that are not visible
on the external surface of the brain is responsible for parietal bulging. For
example,theprecuneusishidden in the interhemispheric fissure and was
shown to be larger in humans than in chimpanzees (49). Furthermore,
parietal bulging in present-day humans has been linked to large shape
variation in the precuneus (50, 51). The precuneus is a central node of
the default-mode network and an important hub of brain organization.
Bruner et al. (49) therefore concluded that precuneus expansion in
H. sapiens is related to cognitive specializations.
The cerebellum is associated not only with motor-related functions
like the coordination of movements and balance but also with spatial
processing, working memory, language, social cognition, and affective
processing (52–55). The developmentaland evolutionary shape changes
of the posterior cranial fossa are linked to the rapid cerebellar expansion
during perinatal brain growth. Clinical neuroimaging data from mod-
ern humans show that in the first 3 months of life, the cerebellum grows
at the highest rate of all brain parts (more than doubling in 90 days)
(56). The cerebellum is frequently implied in childhood onset disorders
and known to be vulnerable to environmental influences during early
childhood (57).
ItisintriguingthattheevolutionarybrainglobularizationinH.sapiens
parallels the emergence of behavioral modernity documented by the ar-
cheological record. First, the emergence of the Middle Stone Age is close
in time to the currently earliest known fossils of early H. sapiens (17)
that had large brains but did not exhibit any major changes to (outer)
brain morphology (20). Second, as the H. sapiens brain gradually
became more globular, features of behavioral modernity accumulated
gradually with time (27). Third, at the time when brain globularity of
our ancestors fell within the range of variation of present-day humans,
the full set of features of behavioral modernity had accumulated at
the transition from the Middle to the Later Stone Age in Africa and
from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic in Europe around 50,000 to
40,000 years ago (26). In this context, the “human revolution” just marks
the point in time when gradual changes reach full modern behavior and
morphology and does not represent a rapid evolutionary event related
to only one important genetic change that leads to a rapid emergence
of modern human brain morphology and behavioral modernity.

 Gene drift theoretically could have caused the morphological
changes in the H. sapiens lineage in a lengthy process of modern human
origins (58), but genetic data based on ancient DNA suggest positive
selection of several genes important for nervous system development,
brain function, and behavior in our lineage including genes involved
inaxonalanddendriticgrowthorsynaptictransmission(29–33).According
to the parallels between the emergence of anatomical and behavioral
modernity, some of these genes were selected and fixed at different
times since the origin of our species and before the transition to the
Upper Paleolithic. Any changes of brain-related genes at the origin of
our species did not affect outer brain morphology and are therefore not
recorded in the shape of the endocranium. Neandertals and their ances-
tors might have acquired some, but not all, modern behaviors (28) with
a brain that became large via the archaic allometric pathway (4).
CONCLUSIONS
Our data suggest that the evolution of modern human brain shape was
characterized by a directional, gradual change. The gradual emergence
of both behavioral modernity in the archeological record (27) and brain
globularity in H. sapiens fossils suggests that evolutionary changes to
early brain development (6, 7, 9–11) were critical for the evolution of
morphology and behavior of our species. Our findings are consistent
with the fixation of genes related to brain development (29–33) within
the H. sapiens lineage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample, CT scans, and landmark data
Our sample consisted of 20 H. sapiens fossils with various geologic
ages from about 300,000 to 10,000 years ago, 8 H. erectus individuals,
8 Neandertals, 2 other Middle Pleistocene Homo individuals (Kabwe
and Petralona), and 89 cranially diverse present-day humans from all
over the world (Table 1). All individuals were CT-scanned to get non-
destructive access to the endocranium. All measurementswere collected
from the digital data.
We generated digital endocasts on the basis of the CT scans and
measured 935 endocranial landmarks and sliding semilandmarks on
endocranial curves and the endocranial surface to capture the overall
shape of the endocasts (Fig. 1 and fig. S1). Semilandmarks were allowed
to slide along tangents to the curves and the surface so as to minimize
bending energy. Thereby, semilandmarks can be treated as geometrical-
ly homologous within this sample (35, 59). Data preparation and the
measurement protocol are detailed in previous studies of Neubauer
and co-workers (5, 43).
Landmark configurations were symmetrized using the mean of the
original and reflected relabeled version (36, 37) and then superimposed
the symmetrized data using generalized least-squares Procrustes analysis
to remove nonshape information aboutlocation andorientationfromthe
raw coordinates and to scale each individual to unit centroid size. The
remaining Procrustes shape variables and centroid sizes were analyzed.
Fossil reconstruction
Incomplete and/or distorted fossil individuals were reconstructed in the
following well-established way: (i) Where possible,bony fragmentswere
realigned according to smoothness criteria and anatomical knowledge
and fragments preserved on only one side were mirror-imaged to the
other side; (ii) partial digital endocasts were generated; (iii) coordinates
of preserved endocranial landmarks and semilandmarks were obtained;
(iv)missinglandmarksandsemilandmarkswereestimatedonthebasisofa
thin-plate spline interpolation of a reference individual (35, 36, 38, 39).
Instead of using only one reference individual, we used the entire
sample of present-day humans and fossil individuals, resulting in
126 reconstructions for every incomplete fossil. For Hofmeyr, we used
only reconstructions based on present-day humans because, given for
the missing regions of this individual, other reconstructions were not
reasonable. For Cro-Magnon 3 and Feldhofer 1, which lack very large,
connected areas (the entire endocranial base), the validity of thin-plate
spline reconstructions was questionable. We therefore used multiple
multivariate regressions to estimate the missing regions (36). For all other
individuals with missing data, this alternative means of reconstruction
largely conforms to the thin-plate spline reconstructions.
Statistical analysis
We computed a bgPCA in shape space on the basis of the mean shapes
of H. erectus, Neandertals, and present-day humans. bgPCA is an ordi-
nation technique that highlights differences between groups and, at the
same time, is not biased by differences in sample sizes among groups
and preserves the real, undistorted shape distances between groups. We
then projected all individuals into this space including the H. sapiens
fossils and explored their shape in this morphospace that spans from
the ancestral H. erectus shape to the derived shapes of Neandertals
and present-day humans. Geologic ages of the fossils are not part of
the data to compute this morphospace, but geologic age information
attached to the fossils allows interpreting possible temporal trends with-
in H. sapiens fossils. Convex hulls were used to delineate group varia-
tion. We randomly sampled one of the 126 reconstructions for each
fossil of a given group, plotted transparent convex hulls, and repeated this
100 times. The resulting lighter, fuzzy borders of convex hulls illustrate
that reconstruction uncertainties of the fossils affect group variation on-
ly to a low extent and that reconstruction uncertainties do not affect the
interpretation of the results.
Furthermore, we computed a bgPCA in form space to investigate
allometric relationships during evolution. To further analyze temporal
trends within H. sapiens fossils and among the archaic fossils (not in-
cluding Kabwe and Petralona for which geologic ages are highly un-
certain), we computed multivariate shape regressions on geologic age
and the percentage of shape variance explained by geologic age. Geolog-
ic age information was extracted from published estimates and, if re-
quired for 14C data, was calibrated according to CALIB 7.1. We
tested the significance of this regression by permuting the geologic
ages of H. sapiens fossils, recalculating the regression, and repeating this
for 1000 times. We did the same to investigate relationships between en-
docranial size and shape within H. sapiens fossils and among the archaic
fossils. Geologic ages and centroid sizes were logged for these computa-
tions. Furthermore, we visualized shape differences and shape changes
along regression slopes as triangulations of the landmarks and semiland-
marks. It is important to emphasize here that we did not compute re-
gressions of single PCs on endocranial size or geologic age but
multivariate regressions based on all shape variables (the Procrustes
shape variables are the dependent variables, whereas age and size are
the independent variables). These regressions were visualized as shape
changes (Fig. 3, fig. S6, and movies S1 to S6) in real space and visualized
in shape space (Fig. 2) and form space (Fig. 4) as arrows. To investigate
endocranial shape changes independently from PCA and regression
analysis, we visualized evolutionary shape changes as a two-step pro-
cess: the shape differences between geologic age groups 1 and 2 and the
differences between geologic age groups 2 and 3). We also color-coded

 regions ofsurface area difference to highlightwhichof the shape changes
are associated to an increase in size (43).
To obtain endocranial volume estimates for reconstructed fossils, we
computed the volume of the triangulated symmetrized landmark set for
each of the multiple reconstructions and computed a mean and SD. For
Cro-Magnon 3 and Feldhofer 1, volume estimates were 1790 and 1269
ml, respectively, when based on a multivariate regression, whereas
values listed in Table 1 were based on multiple reconstructions. Varia-
tion among multiple reconstructions can be interpreted as uncertainty
of the endocranial volume estimate. Because a triangulation of 935
(semi)landmarks only approximates the endocranial surface and there-
fore underestimates the endocranial volume as measured from the CT
scans or the actual individual, we added a correction scalar of 23 ml,
which is the mean residual of a regression of measured versus computed
endocranial volumes in the present-day human sample without missing
dataforwhichboth, avolume computedasdescribedhere and avolume
as measured from a segmented endocast, were available.
