in clinical samples

Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is urgently needed for informing treatment decisions and preventing
the spread of antimicrobial resistance resulting from the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. To date, no phenotypic
AST exists that can be performed within a single patient visit (30 min) directly from clinical samples. We show that
AST results can be obtained by using digital nucleic acid quantification to measure the phenotypic response of
Escherichia coli present within clinical urine samples exposed to an antibiotic for 15 min. We performed this rapid
AST using our ultrafast (~7 min) digital real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP) assay [area under
the curve (AUC), 0.96] and compared the results to a commercial (~2 hours) digital polymerase chain reaction assay
(AUC, 0.98). The rapid dLAMP assay can be used with SlipChip microfluidic devices to determine the phenotypic
antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli directly from clinical urine samples in less than 30 min. With further development
for additional pathogens, antibiotics, and sample types, rapid digital AST (dAST) could enable rapid clinical decision-
making, improve management of infectious diseases, and facilitate antimicrobial stewardship.
INTRODUCTION
The emergence of antibiotic resistance is an impending threat to
global health. It is projected to cause 10 million deaths and more
than $1 trillion in total economic impact by 2050 if left unchecked
(1, 2). To combat antimicrobial resistance, facilitate stewardship, and
improve patient outcomes, health care providers need to be able to
determine antibiotic susceptibility rapidly and ideally at the point of
care (POC) (3–6). The need for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing
(AST) to guide antibiotic treatment is recognized by all major health
organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and the World Health Organization (7–11).
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacte-
rial infections, accounting for ~8 million primary care visits annually,
and are almost always treated with antibiotics (12, 13). In the absence
of a rapid AST, UTIs are among the many infections that are treated
with second-line antibiotics, such as the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin
(cip), instead of first-line antibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin (nit) (14). This
increased use of fluoroquinolones is accompanied by the emergence of
fluoroquinolone resistance, limiting treatment options, which is espe-
cially critical in life-threatening cases, such as when UTIs progress to
sepsis. Thus, UTIs are a specific clinical scenario where an inexpensive
and rapid (within the ~30-min duration of a patient visit) AST would
notably improve patient outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship.
No such AST diagnostic currently exists. Phenotypic AST methods
based on culture of the target pathogen are the current gold standard
but are too slow to support immediate treatment decisions or to be im-
plemented at the POC (15). Genotypic methods, which detect known
resistance genes, are faster because they do not require a culturing step
(16–18). Genotypic methods have shown promise in select clinical set-
tings where the presence of a single gene yields high predictive value,
such as testing for mecA to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (19–21). However, genotypic tests have not been implemented
more broadly because they are not generalizable to different pathogens
or mechanisms of resistance, especially in the case of Gram-negative
bacteria, for which more than 800 resistance genes are known for
b-lactam class antibiotics alone (22).
An ideal AST would test the phenotypic response of a pathogen to
antibiotics in a pathogen-specific manner and provide an AST answer
(susceptible or resistant) in less than 30 min (23, 24). This is a critical bar
to meet because if the AST result can be obtained within the time span
of a patient visit, then the information can be used to inform treatment
and facilitate antimicrobial stewardship at the POC. Additionally, in
some infections, such as sepsis, accelerated time to treatment is
correlated with improved patient outcome (25). To achieve this speed,
the AST method needs to work directly from a clinical sample. Several
methods, including our previous work (26), have improved the speed
of individual steps of the phenotypic AST workflow (such as pathogen
isolation and identification, antibiotic exposure time, sample prepa-
ration, and readout), but few of these papers report performing the
entire workflow from start to finish using a clinical sample.
To date, no phenotypic AST has achieved a sample-to-answer result
in less than 30 min directly from a clinical sample. Most of the
methods under development were validated with clinical isolates of
pathogens, which before the assay were grown in culture to a high density
and not directly with clinical samples. Among the rapid phenotypic AST
methods used with clinical samples, one microscopy-based method
could differentiate susceptible and resistant isolates after only 10 min of
antibiotic exposure but did not test clinicalsamples(27). A similarly rapid
microscopy-based method could detect differences in bacterial growth
during antibiotic treatment after as short as 6 min of antibiotic exposure
using isolates, but the total assay time for a clinical sample was 155 min
(28). As discussed in (28), clinical sample matrices, such as urine, pre-
sent a challenge for rapid microscopy-based ASTs, affecting the speed
and sensitivities (required cell concentrations) of these assays.
Furthermore, identification and differentiation of target pathogens
from commensal organisms can be challenging if these steps rely only

 on imaging, without the molecular specificity offered by other meth-
ods. A microfluidic-based microscopy method using isolates reported
AST in ~3 to 4 hours without an identification step and estimated that
the total assay time from a clinical sample would be 52 hours (29).
Another microscopy-based method in clinical testing performs iden-
tification and AST from a positive culture in 5 to 6 hours, with addi-
tional overnight or longer time required to first grow the culture from
a clinical sample (30, 31). An electrochemical method was used to de-
termine susceptibility in as short as 25 min using nonspecific redox
markers for reference strains (32), but the workflow lacked a pathogen
identification step and the AST was not pathogen-specific. Other
electrochemical methods are pathogen-specific but require at least
45 min of assay time when using isolates (33). Pathogen-specific elec-
trochemical methods have also been used to determine susceptibility
from clinical samples, but assay times were on the order of hours (34).
Methods that perform phenotypic AST by quantifying nucleic acids
(NAs) are promising because they provide molecular specificity, but
so far, most have required long antibiotic exposures (~2 hours or more)
in addition to the time required for measurement, which was as fast as
1.5 hours using isothermal amplification (35–37). This promise of an
NA-based AST was highlighted in a study that used RNA gene expres-
sion markers and demonstrated antibiotic exposure times as short
as 10 min for isolates and as short as 30 min for clinical samples,
although in that landmark study, the total assay time was more than
23 hours as a result of using slow quantification technology (38).
We have shown previously that the antibiotic exposure time in a
phenotypic AST can be shortened to 15 min by measuring DNA con-
centrations in a digital format (26). That work was performed with
bacterial UTI isolates and required a 2-hour measurement step using
commercial droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR). The
transition from cultures of clinical isolates to clinical samples is in-
variably challenging for phenotypic AST methods, and previous works
have highlighted these challenges (28, 38, 39).
Here, we asked and answered two salient questions: For clinical
samples, (i) can digital single-molecule counting of pathogen DNA
enable phenotypic AST after a short (15 min) antibiotic exposure,
and (ii) is there a quantification strategy faster than PCR that can be
used in a digital format to achieve a pathogen-specific, sample-to-
answer phenotypic AST within 30 min directly from a clinical sample?
To answer these questions, we developed an ultrafast digital isothermal
amplification assay to shorten the readout step and demonstrated that
the entire contiguous sample-to-answer workflow could enable an AST
result in less than 30 min from a clinical UTI urine sample. We tested
the rapid digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP) as-
say we developed with 51 clinical UTI urine samples and compared
the results to commercial dPCR analysis.
RESULTS
Key processes and operational space of digital AST
A phenotypic AST consists of two key processes: antibiotic exposure
and measurement of the AST marker. To meet the demands of a rapid
AST, these two processes, plus sample handling, must occur within
30 min. The workflow of the digital AST (dAST) method involved the
following steps: aliquoting and diluting a clinical urine sample into two
equal volumes of media—one with an antibiotic and a control without
antibiotic; incubation at 37°C for 15 min; quantification of a target NA
sequence (AST marker) in each sample; and calculation of the ratio of
the markerconcentrations in the controlandantibiotic-treated samples,
defined as the control/treated (CT) ratio (Fig. 1A).
Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by comparing a CT ratio
to a previously determined threshold value (susceptibility threshold).
Sample pairs that yield a CT ratio that falls above this threshold are
called susceptible, and samples with a ratio below this threshold
are called resistant. A CT ratio that is higher than the susceptibility
threshold shows that DNA replication continued in the control
(−ABX) sample but was slowed or halted in the antibiotic-treated
(+ABX) sample, indicating that the sample was susceptible to that
antibiotic. CT ratios lower than the susceptibility threshold indicate that
DNA replication continued in both the control (−ABX) and antibiotic-
treated (+ABX) samples at the same rate, indicating that the sample was
resistant to that antibiotic (Fig. 1A, step 4).
The time period of the antibiotic exposure step affects the resolu-
tion requirements for the quantification step: A shorter antibiotic ex-
posure results in a smaller difference in the concentration of the target
AST marker between the antibiotic-treated and control samples. Thus,
at shorter exposure periods, quantification with higher resolution is
required to reliably quantify an AST marker. To illustrate the interplay
of antibiotic exposure time and required measurement resolution, we ex-
plored the trade-off of these three parameters (exposure time, required

 resolution, and DNA replication rate) computationally and made pre-
dictions about the resolution needed to detect susceptibility. We defined
this combination of parameters as the operational space (Fig. 1B). For
simplicity, we assumed that for an antibiotic-susceptible pathogen,
DNA replication halts upon exposure to the antibiotic. Under this as-
sumption, the DNA replication rate (which differs for different patho-
gens) directly determines the CT ratio at a given antibiotic exposure time.
We also assumed that there was no lag phase upon transitioning from
urine to liquid media; if there is a lag phase, then the requirements for
resolution become even more stringent, further emphasizing the
need for high-precision digital measurements. For example, if the
measurement method is limited to twofold resolution, such as in quan-
titative PCR (qPCR), and the pathogen’s DNA doubles every 30 min, then
the minimum exposure time necessary to achieve a CT ratio of 2 is
30 min. If the measurement method can instead resolve a 1.2-fold differ-
enceinconcentrations,thentheminimumexposuretimedecreasesto8min.
Measuring changes in DNA concentration with high resolution therefore
allowsthedetectionofapathogen’sresponsetoantibioticevenfasterthan
cell division time (26). Compared with bulk methods (such as qPCR or
isothermal amplification), digital quantification can resolve the differ-
ence between the two concentrations with greater precision (26, 40, 41),
which in turn enables shorter antibiotic exposure times (26).
Digital quantification achieves higher resolution by partitioning
target molecules into thousands of compartments such that each com-
partment contains a single molecule. Amplifying each partitioned
molecule to a detectable concentration and counting the number of
positive compartments at the end point yield precise quantification.
Resolution can be increased, and antibiotic exposure time reduced, by
increasing the number of digital compartments. However, the benefit of
adding more digital compartments decreases beyond ~1000 compart-
ments, and additional compartments are better used for multiplexing of
multiple markers or antibiotics. For example, at UTI-relevant concen-
trations of DNA (106 copies/ml), 1000 digital compartments with 1-nl
volume each provides 1.23-fold resolution. Increasing the number of
these compartments to 10,000 or 100,000 while correspondingly re-
ducing their volumes to 0.1 and 0.01 nl each, to maintain the same sam-
ple volume and total number of target molecules, provides 1.18- and
1.17-fold resolution, respectively (fig. S1). With 10,000 1-nl compart-
ments, the resolution is 1.08, whereas 2000 1-nl compartments provide
a resolution of 1.16 each, enabling a fourplex dAST (one control and
four antibiotic-treated samples) to be performed with the same number
of wells (fig. S1C).
We have previously demonstrated that a 15-min exposure step is
sufficient to generate detectable differences in DNA concentrations be-
tween the control and antibiotic-treated samples using UTI isolates
and four antibiotics commonly prescribed for UTIs (26). For a 15-min
exposure period, which is shorter than the fastest reported uropatho-
genic Escherichia coli doubling time of 16 min (42), we predicted the
DNA concentration in the control sample to increase 1.4× to 1.6× (Fig.
1B, green star). Other uropathogenic organisms have doubling times of
13 min (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 25 min (Proteus mirabilis), and 29 min
(Staphylococcus saprophyticus) (43, 44). Therefore, theoretical estimates
suggested that a 15-min exposure should provide a 1.4- to 2.2-fold
change,whichiswithintheresolutionofdigitalmeasurements.Historically,
such measurements have required 90 min or more (45, 46). For the total
assay time to remain less than 30 min, digital NA quantification must be
performed in less than 10 min, assuming sample handling (including NA
extraction) of at least 5 min and an antibiotic exposure of 15 min. On the
basis of these theoretical calculations, we developed a method of digital NA
quantification that could be performed in less than 10 min.
dAST in the presence of commensal organisms
A factor that may challenge phenotypic ASTs that are run directly on
clinical samples is that commensal or contaminating organisms present
in the sample may respond differently to a given antibiotic than the
target pathogen. If the measurement method cannot differentiate be-
tween the response of the target pathogen and commensals, then
susceptibility cannot be determined accurately. NA amplification
can be designed to target a sequence specific to a potential pathogen
species or families of interest. Therefore, we hypothesized that when
using a pathogen-specific NA target, the CT ratio (and, therefore, the
determination of the pathogen as susceptible or resistant by the AST)
would not be affected by varying amounts of commensal bacteria.
dAST was performed in the presence of Lactobacillus jensenii (Lj), a
common commensal bacterium found in urine. An E. coli culture
[~106 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml] was mixed with each of the three
concentrations of Lj (0.1×, 1×, and 10× the optical density of the target
pathogen) and exposed to cip for 15 min. The response was measured
using droplet dPCR, and susceptibility of E. coli was determined cor-
rectly at all concentrations of the commensal organism (Fig. 2).

 Optimization of isothermal amplification (LAMP)
We next focused on shortening the measurement time from 2 hours
(time of amplification using dPCR) to <10 min. We investigated dLAMP
first because it has been demonstrated previously by us and others
(40, 47–50). However, these dLAMP assays previously took >45 min
and were not shown to resolve small differences (~1.5×) in NA concen-
trations. Fast LAMP reactions often show background amplification in
negative control experiments, so we aimed to also solve this problem.
We designed primers and optimized real-time LAMP in bulk solu-
tions to maximize amplification speed while eliminating background
amplification. At very high NA concentrations, real-time bulk LAMP
assays have been reported to be as fast as 5 min (18, 51), but at the
lower concentrations of a single target molecule present in a single
digital partition (~1 copy/nl = 106 copies/ml), amplification takes 10 min
or more (52–55). To mimic the concentration of a template in a single
digital partition, we performed our bulk optimization experiments
at ~106 copies/ml. We selected the E. coli 23S ribosomal DNA gene
as the pathogen-specific NA sequence (dAST marker) and as the tar-
get for primer design because we showed previously that this was a
reliable marker for DNA replication in the context of AST (26). Pan-
Enterobacteriaceae primers would be useful for targeting other UTI
pathogens. Although we did not pur-
posefully design our primers to exclude
other Enterobacteriaceae pathogens,
we were able to detect K. pneumoniae
and P. mirabilis in pilot experiments
using the same primers. Sensitivity and
specificity of these primers remain to be
further validated for additional path-
ogens and commensals.
The LAMP optimization process
(Fig. 3A) consisted of four steps: (1)
screening multiple LAMP primer sets
for speed and lack of background am-
plification, (2) screening multiple loop
primer pairs with the selected primer
set from step 1 for speed and lack of
background amplification, (3) testing
the selected LAMP and loop primers
with a range of magnesium ion (Mg)
concentrations, and (4) selecting the
optimal amplification temperature from
the data obtained in step 3. Each pa-
rameter was tested using a temperature
gradient, which proved to be critical to
minimizing the time to positive (TTP),
the reaction time to detect a positive
sample. Of the four tested LAMP primer
sets, we selected set B because it showed
the fastest amplification and no back-
ground amplification (Fig. 3A, step 1).
No loop primer pair showed much ear-
lier TTPs than any other pair, and no
pair showed theoretical or experimental
evidence of primer-dimers, so we arbi-
trarily chose the loop A set (Fig. 3A,
step 2). Four concentrations of Mg were
tested using the DNA polymerase Bst
3.0. The resulting TTPs varied by as
much as 11 min depending on the amplification temperature. This
optimization process resulted in TTPs as fast as ~4 to 5 min for ~700
target copies in a 6-ml amplification volume, with the fastest TTP
(4.4 min) obtained using 6 mM Mg at 71°C.
Once LAMP primers and protocols had been optimized, we fur-
ther tested their specificity for the dAST marker. No positive signals
were obtained when we ran real-time LAMP using Lj genomic DNA
(gDNA), human gDNA, or urine from healthy donors without any
symptoms of UTI (Fig. 3B). When testing clinical UTI samples, a
positive signal was only obtained when E. coli DNA was present. TTPs
ranged from 4 to 5 min for clinical UTI samples (Fig. 3C). However,
using this LAMP method in a standard well-plate format to resolve a
1.5× difference in concentration would require detecting a difference
in TTP of ~8 s, which is difficult in practice to perform robustly (40).
dAST using ultrafast single-molecule counting (dLAMP)
Ournext goalwas to test whether using this optimizedLAMP chemistry
in a digital format would yield an accurate determination of antibiotic
susceptibility while preserving the speed observed in bulk solutions.
This would require the ability to resolve small changes in NA concen-
trations that occur after a 15-min exposure to antibiotic, despite any

 heterogeneity in TTPs (the difference in amplification kinetics of in-
dividual molecules), which has been observed previously (50, 56). Be-
cause sample matrices might increase the heterogeneity in TTPs and
thus decrease the resolution, we tested clinical urine samples, which
can contain urea, proteins, blood (including heme as a potent PCR in-
hibitor), and other cellular components that can interfere with assay de-
tection. To eliminate extracellular DNA present in clinical urine as a
potential source of error, we modified the dAST procedure that we
previously developed for isolates (26) to include deoxyribonuclease
(DNase) during the exposure step to digest any extracellular DNA
(see the Supplementary Materials). We used the optimized LAMP
assay (Fig. 3) with SlipChip microfluidic devices in a digital format
(57). The SlipChip partitioned the samples into 1280 digital compart-
ments. In eachcompartment, single moleculeswere amplifiedif present,
and the totalnumber of positive compartments wascounted in realtime
(56). In a clinical setting, decisions are typically made from single assay
runs, and thus, we tested whether differences in NA concentrations be-
tween the control and antibiotic-treated samples could be resolved reli-
ably using a single 1280-well SlipChip for each measurement.
Using dLAMP (Fig. 4), most (>80%) single molecules amplified
between 4 and 10 min, as shown by the fluorescence curves plotted
in Fig. 4 (A and F). As expected, heterogeneity in TTP was observed,
likely as a result of the stochasticity of single-molecule amplification
(50, 58). Despite heterogeneity and matrix effects of clinical urine, we
detected a significant difference in NA concentration (P = 6.1 × 10−4)
after only 5 min of amplification time for the cip-susceptible clinical
urine sample (Fig. 4C). For the cip-resistant sample, no significant
difference in concentration was detected during the dLAMP assay
(P > 0.05) (Fig. 4H). In both samples, the CT ratios were stable after
6 min and 40 s (6.7 min) of amplification (Fig. 4, D and I), were con-
sistent with the ratios obtained by dPCR (Fig. 4, E and J), and yielded
the correct AST call (susceptible or resistant). We then repeated this
dLAMP assay for one nit-susceptible and one nit-resistant clinical
urine sample. After 6.7 min of dLAMP amplification time, the CT ratios
for both samples were stable, and the correct antibiotic-susceptibility
call was determined (fig. S2). This demonstrates that the optimized
dLAMP assay yields correct AST calls in only 6.7 min, below the 10-min
limit necessary to achieve a 30-min dAST. Further, individual DNA
target molecules were detected, and the DNA concentration was ac-
curately quantified even after dilution during antibiotic exposure and
sample preparation (table S1).
Thirty-minute sample-to-answer dAST directly from clinical
urine samples
Next, we tested whether the entire dAST workflow (antibiotic exposure,
sample preparation, measurement, and data analysis) could be per-
formedinlessthan 30min (Fig.5). To accomplishthisgoal, we shortened
the sample preparation time from 10 to 2 min while maintaining com-
patibility with dLAMP. In parallel with antibiotic exposure of a clinical
sample, rapid real-time LAMP was used to confirm the presence of
E. coli and to measure the approximate NA concentration of the dAST
marker in the sample (Fig. 5B). This step provided the identification
of the pathogen and could be used to select the amount of NAs loaded
on the chip to maximize the performance of the digital assay without
adding time to the workflow; it also avoided the AST quantification step
for the samples lacking the pathogen or containing subclinical amounts.

 We also modified the real-time image analysis software we developed
previously (56) to calculate the concentrations of the dAST marker in
real time from each image, instead of after completion of amplification.
After these modifications, we calculated that all steps could be per-
formed within ~24 min [15 min (exposure) + 2 min (sample prepa-
ration) + 6.7 min (readout)]. We tested whether these steps could be
performed in succession to provide a full sample-to-answer workflow,
including all fluid transfer steps and data analysis, within 30 min. We
startedatimerwhenaninfectedclinicalurine sample wasaddedto media
with and without cip. After 29.8 min of total elapsed time (6.7 min of
dLAMP amplification time), the software reported the control and
treated concentrations for the cip-susceptible sample to be significantly
different (P = 7.4 × 10−10), with a CT ratio of 1.59. For the cip-resistant
sample, no significant difference in concentration was reported through
the entire dLAMP assay (P > 0.05). At 29.2 min (6.7 min of dLAMP
amplification time), the CT ratio for the cip-resistant sample was 1.08
(Fig. 5D). This result shows how a combination of rapid partitioning,
fast isothermal amplification, and high-resolution digital measurements
enabled antibiotic susceptibility to be determined in less than 30 min.
dAST using a set of 51 clinical samples
Having established that the dAST method could be performed, sample-
to-answer, in less than 30 min, we next tested dAST with 51 clinical
samples using both dPCR and dLAMP readouts. Samples were ex-
posed to antibiotic for 15 min, and NA extraction was performed
on a total of 51 clinical UTI samples containing ≥5 × 104 CFU/ml
E. coli (17 cip-susceptible, 14 cip-resistant, 18 nit-susceptible, and
5 nit-resistant). Three clinical samples were tested separately with
cip and nit, for a total of 54 tests. We focused on categorical agreement
of our binary susceptibility determination (susceptible or resistant) and
did not test intermediate samples due to the variability in minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of gold standard AST
methods (59, 60). It is common to only challenge new AST methods
against susceptible and resistant samples (34, 35, 61), which excludes
a small fraction of samples for cip (62). To ensure that there were no
special issues with bacteria with intermediate MICs, we used the dAST
method on a small set of cip-intermediate isolates to better understand
its performance (fig. S3).
We quantified the DNA AST marker of the control and treated
extractions on all 54 samples with both dPCR and dLAMP. For each
sample, the CT ratio was calculated and compared to a susceptibility
threshold [1.10; determined in (26)] to classify the samples as resistant
or susceptible (Fig. 6A). Discordant CT ratios were observed for five
samples when compared with the gold standard broth microdilution
method. To resolve the discrepancy, we reran three of these five discor-
dant samples, averaging the second CT ratio with the CT ratio from the
firstruntoobtainaconsensusvalueoftheCTratio(tableS2,samples#28,
#29, and #36). As a control, we also reran one sample that was not
discordant (table S2, sample #122). To ensure clinical samples yielded
reproducible CT ratios, we used the dAST method to test a small set of
cip-susceptible isolates in triplicate (fig. S4).
With 1.10 as the susceptibility threshold for dPCR measurements,
the dAST method returned 51 correct calls (94.4% categorical agree-
ment), 2 very major errors for 19 resistant samples (10.5%), and 1 major
error for 35 susceptible samples (2.9%). Because 1.10 was a thresh-
old based on experiments with isolates (26), we generated a receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve to inform the optimal thresh-
old for clinical UTI samples (Fig. 6B). ROC curves show the ability
of a diagnostic test to discriminate positives and negatives based on

 a threshold: Values below the threshold are called negative (resistant),
and values above the threshold are called positive (susceptible). The
area under the curve (AUC) for the generated ROC was 0.98. Using
the optimal threshold given by the ROC curve (1.14), 53 of 54 dAST
calls matched the gold standard AST call (98.1% categorical agree-
ment) with 1 very major error (5.3%) and 0 major errors (0%).
We also used dLAMP to quantify the same 54 samples. The CT
ratios at 6.7 min were calculated and plotted in Fig. 6C, along with the
ROC curve for dLAMP (Fig. 6D). With 1.10 as the susceptibility
threshold for dLAMP measurements at 6.7 min, the dAST method
returned 51 correct calls (94.4% categorical agreement), 2 very major
errors for 19 resistant samples (10.5%), and 1 major error for 35 sus-
ceptible samples (2.6%). The AUC for the generated ROC curve was
0.96. Using the optimal threshold given by the ROC curve (1.11), 52 of
54 dAST calls matched the gold standard AST call (96.3% categorical
agreement) with 1 very major error (5.3%) and 1 major error (2.9%).
These data show that although the optimal thresholds derived from
the ROC curves (1.14 for dPCR and 1.11 for dLAMP) slightly improve
the categorical agreement, they are consistent with the threshold
established for isolates [1.10 (26)] and are consistent with each other.
Quantifying DNA with dLAMP at 6.7 min produces similar CT ratios
and susceptibility calls as dPCR.
DISCUSSION
Here, we solved three problems to determine phenotypic antibiotic
susceptibility in clinical samples within 30 min. First, we used digital
quantification of a DNA marker to reduce the antibiotic exposure
time to 15 min. Second, we showed that dAST is robust to the pres-
ence of commensal bacteria and clinical urine matrices. Third, we de-
veloped and optimized a rapid, high-resolution measurement method
for quantifying NA targets that shortens the measurement step to less
than 10 min.
The dLAMP assay developed here was capable of amplifying single
target DNA molecules in less than 5 min. Despite the heterogeneity of
single-molecule amplification times, high-resolution measurements
were obtained even before all partitions with a target DNA molecule
had amplified (~6.7 min). This makes dLAMP a strong tool for real-time,
high-resolution, rapid measurements of NAs. Rapid, high-resolution
measurements increase the information gained in shorter times
and will be invaluable for other assays, such as viral load measure-
ments and genotyping (50, 63, 64). LAMP was chosen for trans-
lation to a digital format because it is a well-established amplification
chemistry (51, 65, 66) with several readout methods (67–70). If necessary,
other amplification chemistries—including NASBA (NA sequence-
based amplification), RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification),
NEAR (nicking enzyme amplification
reaction), and HDA (helicase-dependent
amplification)—could be tested and opti-
mized for a digital format and used to mea-
sure a marker of interest. Additionally, we
show that the LAMP assay is compatible
with a rapid, one-step extraction method,
which considerably reduces the sample
preparation time. Because of the speed
of extraction and amplification, the same
LAMP assay can be used in a real-time
bulk format for rapid pathogen identifica-
tion in parallel with the 15-min antibiotic
exposure step. This step, completed in
<10 min including sample preparation,
did not extend the total assay time but
provided two critical pieces of information
before digital quantification: (i) whether
a sample was infected with the pathogen
of interest and (ii) whether a sample con-
tained clinically relevant concentrations
of the pathogen. UTI-positive samples gave
TTP values of 4 to 5 min (corresponding
to ~105 to 106 DNA copies/ml, n = 7) (Fig.
3C), whereas healthy urine samples re-
mained negative for at least 20 min (n =
5) (Fig. 3B). This specificity is critical in
working with clinical samples because it
enables the dAST to provide information
specific to the pathogens of interest rather
than commensals, contaminating organ-
isms, or mixtures of pathogens. Addi-
tionally, using dLAMP to calculate the
CT ratios and determine susceptibility
was informative for estimating pathogen
concentration in the urine sample (see
table S1).

 Most of the previous rapid AST methods used cultures of clinical
isolates instead of clinical samples (see table S3 for a quantitative sum-
mary of the published state of the art). The introduction of commensal
or contaminating organisms and clinical sample matrices to diag-
nostic workflows can cause major challenges in the development and
translation of laboratory methods. It is therefore critical to prove
that AST methods are compatible with clinical samples. Here, we have
shown that the dAST method is compatible with a wide range of urine
samples. Urine color of the samples included colorless, yellow, dark
yellow, and red; pH ranged from <5.0 to 8.0; and protein concentra-
tions ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 mg/ml (71). Additionally, red and white
blood cell counts were as high as >106 cells/ml each in separate sam-
ples, and several samples demonstrated elevated glucose. One sam-
ple contained a lactose-positive Gram-negative rod bacterium (3 ×
104 CFU/ml) in addition to the infecting E. coli. Although this study
warrants more extensive follow-up investigation into more detailed
correlations between urine composition and dAST speed and does
not establish whether this method would work in a more complex
matrix like whole blood, our results indicate that dAST is com-
patible with a wide range of urine matrices and contaminants in clin-
ical samples.
The dAST method described herein was demonstrated with a spe-
cific scenario, and thus, there are inherent limitations to the extrapola-
tions we can make to other pathogens and antibiotics. These limitations
will guide future work in this area. We demonstrated dAST using a
single clinical sample set of UTI urine samples infected with E. coli,
which causes 80% of UTIs, using a threshold of 1.10 previously es-
tablished with isolates. This is similar to other studies at this stage of
technology development (72–74); multiple clinical sets should be run
in the future.
Cip was chosen because it has become one of the most com-
monly prescribed antibiotics for UTIs, despite being a second-line
therapy that should be preserved for more severe cases (12, 13, 75).
Nit was chosen because it is the recommended treatment for acute
uncomplicated cystitis (6). Nit is a highly effective first-line anti-
biotic that is often overlooked because of a lack of susceptibility data.
The lack of AST data becomes especially important because nit is
sometimes used as a prophylactic treatment for recurrent UTIs and,
despite its effectiveness, is not used to treat acute cases due to suscep-
tibility concerns (12). Multiplexing with more pathogens and anti-
biotics in a blinded study is an important next step that, if successful,
would further validate and prove the clinical utility of this rapid dAST
assay.
Other UTI pathogens may have slower growth rates and smaller
differences in control and treated concentrations (Fig. 1B); however,
these differences are theoretically resolvable with digital NA quantifi-
cation. Furthermore, alternative dAST markers might yield larger CT
ratios after shorter antibiotic exposure times. In particular, changes
in RNA in response to antibiotic exposure have been shown to be
both large and fast (38) and should be rapidly discernable with digital
methods such as the ones described here. For example, we have dem-
onstrated quantification of viral RNA on digital SlipChips (64, 76),
including a 5-plex chip for multiplexed measurements. With chip de-
signs properly adjusted for appropriate multiplexing and desired reso-
lution (fig. S1), multiplexed measurements could be useful for analyzing
combinations of RNA markers (38). Additionally, RNA markers (38)
and alternative DNA markers may be required for antibiotics with
different mechanisms of action, such as b-lactams (26), to achieve a
30-min sample-to-answer dAST.
Pathogen concentration is also considered when working with
clinical samples. Quantifying NAs with high resolution is challeng-
ing if the NA concentration drops below the optimal dynamic range
of the system. For example, in sepsis, the concentration of pathogens
in blood can be as low as ~1 to 10 CFU/ml (77). Although blood cul-
tures, which require overnight or longer incubations, are currently
used to increase the concentration of pathogens, they are too slow
to inform the initial treatment because each additional hour of delayed
treatment in sepsis results in a 7.6% increase in mortality (25), empha-
sizing the need for rapid AST. This major challenge of low concentra-
tions of pathogens must be overcome to perform dAST in cases of
sepsis and will require alterations to the methodology, such as the ad-
dition of a pathogen-concentrating step before antibiotic exposure.
Last, we have not tested dAST against heteroresistant microbial popu-
lations, which have been documented in Gram-positive organisms
(78) but are not common in Gram-negative organisms.
We have streamlined many aspects of the workflow for the dAST
demonstration and believe this workflow can be performed by trained
personnel in diagnostic laboratories. However, because this process
requires several pipetting and handling steps, operator error is pos-
sible. We anticipate that dAST would have the greatest impact on
antibiotic stewardship if it could be performed by minimally trained
personnel at the POC. This would require integration of the dAST
workflow into an inexpensive, simple-to-use device operated with
inexpensive equipment. An integrated dAST device would increase
throughput and reduce the potential biohazard risks associated with
open pipetting steps, which are a limitation of our current protocol.
Although not demonstrated here, an integrated device should be fea-
sible due to the straightforward nature of the dAST workflow. Isother-
mal digital quantification can be performed using a range of technologies
and amplification chemistries (40, 47, 49, 63, 79), including SlipChips,
which are compatible with untrained users (80) and can be read with
inexpensive optics such as a camera phone (40, 70). Whereas reusable
glass SlipChips require cleaning (76), disposable injection-molded
SlipChips further simplify the workflow. Furthermore, the SlipChip
platform supports multiplexed digital measurements (45), which is
desired to perform AST on multiple antibiotics and/or pathogens simul-
taneously. Finally, the robustness of isothermal digital amplification
to temperature, imaging conditions, reaction time (40), sample prep-
aration methods (81, 82), and inhibitors (83–85) could further simplify
the instrument requirements. This rapid dAST, if fully developed and
validated for additional microorganisms, antibiotics, and sample types
and transitioned to a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–
waived POC device approved by the regulatory bodies, would enable
rapid clinical decision-making, improve management of infectious
diseases, and increase antimicrobial stewardship.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to develop a rapid phenotypic AST
using digital NA quantification. The two key hypotheses of this work
were as follows: (i) 15 min of antibiotic exposure can cause sufficient
differences in pathogen-specific DNA concentrations between control
and antibiotic-treated samples such that a high-resolution digital quan-
tification measurement method such as dPCR can reliably detect a dif-
ference in NA concentrations for a susceptible sample and (ii) a rapid
dLAMP assay can resolve these small differences in NA concentration
in less than 10 min. To test the first hypothesis, 51 clinical human

 urine samples were tested using the dAST method (three samples
run with both antibiotics for a total of 54 antibiotic-susceptibility
calls), and the results were compared to the gold standard broth micro-
dilution. Clinical UTI samples with E. coli as the pathogen of interest
were chosen as a test case for the dAST method using one first-line
antibiotic (nit) and one second-line antibiotic (cip). To test the second
hypothesis, the rapid dLAMP assay was compared with a commercial
dPCR system for calculating the CT ratios and determining antibiotic
susceptibility from clinical UTI samples.
To calculate the sample size, the methods and Equation 5 from
(86) were used. We define the true-positive rate (sensitivity) as the
proportion of gold standard–susceptible samples that are correctly
identified as susceptible by the dAST method and the true-negative
rate (specificity) as the proportion of gold standard–resistant samples
that are correctly identified as resistant by the dAST method. We sus-
pected that the specificity and sensitivity of the dAST method would
be 95% with a desired margin of error of ±10%. Under these condi-
tions, 18.2 (or 19) samples must be tested with the dAST method and
compared to the gold standard. We tested 19 resistant samples and 35
susceptible samples. Experimental details of LAMP primer design, op-
timization, and specificity and the rapid dLAMP assay are described in
the Supplementary Materials.
dAST in the presence of commensal organisms
Antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant isolates of E. coli
from patients diagnosed with UTIs were obtained from the Univer-
sity of California, Los Angeles, Clinical Microbiology Laboratory
(UCLA CML). These isolates were treated separately with and without
antibiotics (±ABXs) in the presence of varying concentrations of Lj
(also isolated from a clinical UTI urine sample by the UCLA CML).
Lj was spiked into clinical urine samples at varying concentrations rel-
ative to the concentration of E. coli. Concentrations were determined
by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. Samples were exposed
to cip (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min (26). A 10-ml aliquot of
the sample was removed after 0, 15, and 30 min of exposure and
added to 90 ml of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Epicentre).
Target DNA was quantified using droplet dPCR (26). The fold
change in the concentration of target DNA after 15 min of antibiotic
exposure relative to time 0 in the control and antibiotic-treated samples
was compared (Fig. 2, A and B), measuring the significance of this
difference by P value as described previously (26). The CT ratios at
15 min (Fig. 2C) were calculated as the ratios of the marker concentra-
tions in the control and antibiotic-treated samples.
The primers used for all dPCR amplification experiments target the
23S gene of the Enterobacteriaceae family (26). The concentrations of
the components in the dPCR mix used for these experiments and all
subsequent dPCR experiments were as follows: 1× QX200 ddPCR
EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad), 500 nM forward primer, and 500 nM
reverse primer. The NA extraction comprised 10% of the final volume in
the dPCR mix. The remaining volume was nuclease-free water (NF-H2O).
dAST using clinical UTI samples
Clinical urine samples were obtained under an approved institutional
review board (IRB) protocol at the UCLA CML (#15-001189) and
analyzed at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) under
an approved protocol (IRB #15-0566). Samples were deidentified
before being transported to Caltech. Samples were stored in Vacutainer
Plus C&S Boric Acid Sodium Borate/Formate tubes (Becton Dickinson),
transported at ambient temperature, and stored at 4°C once received
at Caltech. Urine samples were from otherwise healthy patients
suspected of having a UTI (based on urinalysis results). The presence
of E. coli was confirmed by the UCLA CML, and MICs were deter-
mined as described previously (26). Urine samples were selected for
dAST analysis based on the determined MIC of the infecting E. coli.
Samples were considered cip-susceptible if the determined MIC was
≤0.25 mg/ml and considered cip-resistant if the MIC was ≥4 mg/ml.
Samples were considered nit-susceptible if the MIC was ≤16 mg/ml
and considered nit-resistant if the MIC was ≥128 mg/ml. Viable
bacteria are a requirement of phenotypic ASTs. Nonviable samples
were excluded if a decrease in DNA concentration was observed (in-
dicating digestion of DNA from nonviable cells). If the change in
DNA concentration was not easily discernible by dPCR after 15 min
of growth in media, then the DNA concentration at 30 min was
measured to determine whether the sample was viable (DNA con-
centration increased at 30 min) or nonviable (DNA concentration de-
creased at 30 min).
Before the start of each experiment, urine as received, still contain-
ing boric acid, was warmed to 37°C over 30 min to mimic the tem-
perature of fresh urine samples. At the start of each dAST experiment
(t = 0), warmed urine was added to media (prewarmed to 37°C) with
or without antibiotics (±ABXs) to initiate DNA replication and be-
gin exposure. This addition to media dilutes the boric acid in the
transport media, allowing bacterial replication to proceed. The final
500-ml sample mixture in the control and treated tubes contained
250 ml of brain heart infusion media (Becton Dickinson), 25 ml of
DNase I (New England Biolabs), 5 ml of DNase buffer (100 mM tris-
HCl, 25 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM CaCl2), and an aliquot of the urine, with
the remaining volume of NF-H2O. Eithercip(1mg/ml) ornit(16mg/ml)
was added to the +ABX sample, with an equal volume of NF-H2O (in
the case of cip) or dimethylformamide (in the case of nit) added to the
control sample (−ABX). Antibiotic concentrations were chosen on the
basis of our previous work with isolates (26) and are near the Clinical
and Laboratory Standards Institute and European Committee on Anti-
microbial Susceptibility Testing breakpoints. A 10-ml aliquot of urine
was added to control and treated tubes in the cip treatments, and a
25-ml aliquot was added in the nit treatments. Samples were shaken at
750 rpm at 37°C for 30 min. After 0, 15, and 30 min of exposure, 10-ml
aliquots of the control and treated samples were removed and added to
90 ml of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution. The extracted samples
were heated according to a modified version of the manufacturer’s
protocol (65°C for 6 min, 95°C for 4 min, and chilled on ice), vortexed,
and centrifuged. Next, 5 ml of each extraction was added to 45 ml of
ddPCR mix and quantified using dPCR. If the DNA concentration of
the sample was too high, then the template was diluted in NF-H2O
and dPCR was rerun. The CT ratios were calculated; if the dAST call
did not match the gold standard AST call, then the sample was rerun sev-
eral hours later on the same day. For the four samples that were rerun,
only the second set of NA extractions were quantified by dLAMP.
Sample-to-answer dAST in less than 30 min
Clinical urine samples were treated with (“treated”) and without
(“control”) cip (1 mg/ml) for 15 min as described above. A timer was
started as soon as urine was added to the media with and without cip.
After 0 and 15 min, a 20-ml aliquot of each sample was added to 80 ml
of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Epicentre). The two samples
were then heated at 65°C for 1 min followed by 98°C for 1 min, after
which they were chilled by incubation on an ice block for 30 s, vortexed,
and centrifuged.

 In parallel with the 15-min antibiotic exposure step, we used the
semiquantitative ability of quantitative LAMP to predict the appropri-
ate dilution factor for our 1280-well digital SlipChips. A 2-ml ali-
quot from each of the control and treated DNA extractions from
time 0 was added to 8 ml of LAMP mix. The samples, along with two
standards with known DNA concentrations (S1, 128.5 copies/ml; S2,
766.0 copies/ml), were then incubated at 72°C for 5 min on a Roche
LightCycler 96, and fluorescent traces were monitored in real time. If
the TTP of the average of the samples was earlier than the TTP of S1,
then 3 ml of the NA aliquot extracted at 15 min was added to 24 ml of
dLAMP mix, along with 3 ml of NF-H2O. If the TTP of the sample was
between the TTPs of S1 and S2, then 6 ml of the 15-min NA extraction
was added to 24 ml of dLAMP mix, with no additional NF-H2O added.
This step was completed within the 15 min of antibiotic exposure. In the
experiments with both antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible
samples (Fig. 5), the TTP was earlier than the TTP of S1.
After semiquantification and mixture of the dLAMP mix with the
template, the dLAMP solutions were pipette-mixed, loaded into
SlipChips, partitioned into 1280 compartments, and placed on the
thermal cycler of a digital real-time imaging instrument at 72°C.
Images were taken every 26 s, and concentrations were calcu-
lated on the basis of the number of positive and negative wells [as
described in Rapid digital LAMP (dLAMP) in the Supplementary
Materials]. Software developed in (56) was modified to enable real-
time image processing and concentration calculations as each im-
age was taken instead of after the assay completed. The CT ratios were
also calculated for each time point; the value of the CT ratio after
6.7 min of amplification time is plotted in Fig. 5D and was compared
to a threshold of 1.10 to determine susceptibility or resistance. The
timer was stopped at this time point; 29.8 min had elapsed when
running dAST with the susceptible sample, and 29.2 min had elapsed
with the resistant sample.
Statistical analysis
Poisson statistics was used to calculate the 95 or 98% confidence
interval of the NA concentration for each digital measurement (45).
To calculate the error in fold change, we used standard error propa-
gation methods (87). With l as a concentration and s as the SD, the
equation is

Kreutz et al. (45) demonstrated that results from a Z test (assuming
a normal distribution) and a permutation test are in very good agree-
ment for various SlipChip designs; therefore, it is appropriate to cal-
culate P values comparing digital NA concentrations with a one-sided
Z test. This Z test asks whether the control NA concentration (lcontrol)
is 1.10× higher than the treated NA concentration (lABX) (26, 45)

Concentration (l) and SD (s) for each digital NA measurement
were calculated from the number of positive and negative compart-
ments with Poisson statistics as described in (45) for single-volume
digital NA quantification. A significance level of 0.05 was used.
