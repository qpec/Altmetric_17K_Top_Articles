Abstract
Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are universal and associated with multiple
negative outcomes. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effect of using the WeCareAdvisor, an
innovative web-based tool developed to enable family caregivers to assess, manage, and track BPSD.
Methods: This RCT enrolled 57 dementia family caregivers from community and clinical settings in Ann Arbor, Michigan
and Baltimore, Maryland. Participants were randomly assigned to immediate use of the WeCareAdvisor tool (WCA, n = 27)
or a Waitlist control group (n = 30) that received the tool after a one-month waiting period. Outcomes for the caregiver
and the person they were caring for were assessed at baseline (T0) and one-month followup for both the WCA (T1) and
Waitlist control (T2) groups.
Results: Caregiver mean age was 65.9 ± 14.0 years old. About half (49%) were spouses. Baseline characteristics were
comparable between groups except for mean caregiver confidence which was higher in the control group (WCA 35.0
± 10.0 vs. Waitlist control 39.7 ± 6.9, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences between the WCA and control groups
in characteristics of the person with dementia. After their one-month of tool use (T1), WCA caregivers showed significant
within group improvement in caregiver distress (− 6.08 ± 6.31 points, t = − 4.82, p < 0.0001) and behavioral frequency
(− 3.60 ± 5.05, t = − 3.56, p = 0.002), severity (− 3.24 ± 3.87, t = − 4.19, p = 0.0003) and total behavioral score (− 6.80 ± 10.73,
t = − 3.17, p = 004). In the same timeframe, Waitlist control caregivers showed a significant decrease in confidence
(− 6.40 ± 10.30, t = − 3.40, p = 0.002). The WCA group showed greater improvement in distress compared to the Waitlist
group (T0-T1; t = − 2.49, p = 0.02), which remained significant after adjusting for site and baseline distress. There were no
significant between-group differences in caregiver confidence or other secondary outcomes. After their one month of tool
use (T2), the Waitlist group also showed significant improvement in caregiver distress (− 3.72 ± 7.53, t = − 2.66, p = 0.013),
stress (− 0.41 ± 1.02, t = − 2.19, p = 0.037), confidence (4.38 ± 5.17, t = 4.56, p < 0.0001), burden (− 2.76 ± 7.26, t = − 2.05,
p = 0.05), negative communication (− 1.48 ± 2.96, t = − 2.70, p = 0.012) and behavioral frequency (− 1.86 ± 4.58, t = − 2.19,
p = 0.037); distress remained significant after adjustment.
Conclusions: In this pilot RCT, WCA use resulted in a significant decrease in caregiver distress. Future research will identify
whether longer use of WCA can impact other caregiver and behavioral outcomes.

 Background
Dementia currently affects over 5 million people in the
US, and with the aging of the population is projected to
affect 16 million people by 2050. While cognitive impair-
ment is the clinical hallmark of dementia, non-cognitive
behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are
nearly universal (affecting 98% of individuals at some
point in the illness course) and often overshadow cogni-
tive symptoms in the disease course [1].
BPSD occur in dementias of all types and include de-
pression, psychosis, psychomotor agitation, aggression,
apathy, sleep disturbances, and inappropriate behaviors
[2]. While BPSD can be thought of as the consequence
of the neurodegeneration associated with dementia, they
are triggered by multiple interacting factors internal and
external to the person with dementia. These include pa-
tient (e.g. undiagnosed medical conditions and untreated
pain), caregiver (e.g. ineffective communication style)
and environmental (e.g. overstimulation or lack of activ-
ity/structure) factors [3]. Importantly, many of these
triggers are modifiable.
There are 15 million family caregivers of people with
dementia in the US. Clinicians depend on caregivers to
assess and manage BPSD in the community including
reporting on symptoms, carrying out recommendations,
and evaluating the effect of treatment. As opposed to
core cognitive symptoms, managing BPSD is one of the
most challenging aspects of care, causing intense care-
giver burden and upset [4]. Caregivers of individuals
with BPSD are more distressed and depressed than those
not managing behaviors [5]. There is emerging evidence
that caregiver distress associated with BPSD is a more
important predictor of institutionalization and inpatient
and emergency department use than the frequency and
severity of the BPSD themselves [6–9]. Thus, it is not
surprising that BPSD are associated with a multitude of
negative outcomes such as hospital stays, injuries, care-
giver stress and depression, reduced caregiver employ-
ment income, earlier nursing home placement as well as
higher patient mortality [3]. BPSD are also costly, with
BPSD management accounting for 30% of the cost of
caring for community-dwelling people living with de-
mentia (PLWD) [10]. Recent research suggests that
managing BPSD can lower costs of dementia care for
families.
Unfortunately, few treatment options are currently
available to family caregivers for BPSD. Typically, if a
caregiver expresses concern about a BPSD to a phys-
ician, a psychiatric medication is prescribed to control
the symptom. However, this is an ineffective and poten-
tially dangerous strategy for several reasons: 1) the risk/
benefit profiles of psychiatric medications for dementia
are poor [11, 12]; and 2) BPSD are a “moving target”
with
different
symptoms
appearing
over
time
and
caregivers often managing multiple BPSD simultan-
eously. Unpredictability and complexity make a simple
“magic bullet” medication solution impossible [13].
In contrast, nonpharmacologic strategies are recom-
mended by multiple medical organizations and expert
groups as the preferred first-line treatment approach to
BPSD, except in emergency situations when behaviors
could lead to imminent danger [14–16]. With an emer-
ging evidence base, nonpharmacologic behavioral man-
agement strategies are increasingly recognized as a critical
part of comprehensive, state of the art dementia care [15],
with the common goals of symptom relief and reduction
of caregiver distress. Currently, the best evidence base for
non-pharmacologic approaches appears to rest with inter-
ventions for family caregivers [3] including Resources for
Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health (REACH II) [17],
the Tailored Activity Program (TAP) [18] and the Care of
Persons with Dementia in their Environments (COPE)
[19], and the Advancing Caregiver Training (ACT) study
[20]. In this type of approach, problem solving with a fam-
ily caregiver to identify triggers or modifiable underlying
causes of BPSD is combined with the use of selected non-
pharmacologic strategies.
However, such approaches have largely not been trans-
lated to real-world care and clinical settings likely because
they are “hands-on” staff- and training-intensive interven-
tions. Such approaches have effectiveness, but require
training and are time-consuming. Therefore, it is not sur-
prising that: 1) few have been translated into a widely de-
liverable
and
sustainable
approach,
and
2)
family
caregivers continue to be underserved or receive services
that are not evidence-based. Further, as families need as-
sistance managing BPSD in real time, technologies and
online platforms may be better able to deliver ‘on demand’
support [21]. While a number of prior studies have incor-
porated technology components [22–25], we know of no
web-based, easy to use, comprehensive interactive tools to
help family caregivers manage BPSD and track their modi-
fiable underlying causes such as pain, infection, communi-
cation
problems
or
environmental
overstimulation
including which strategies were effective.
We sought to overcome this research-practice gap by
creating a web-based tool for family caregivers that would
guide them through a clinical reasoning process to iden-
tify, monitor and manage behaviors while simultaneously
addressing their motivation, self-efficacy and problem-
solving skills. This approach has previously been applied
to the management of complex health conditions such as
cancer and asthma, or to assist with smoking cessation
and weight management [26, 27].
The bedrock of the tool is the “DICE” approach to BPSD
that was developed from a US national multidisciplinary ex-
pert consensus panel [28]. DICE™ (hereafter abbreviated as
DICE)
is
an
algorithmic,
evidence-based
approach

 comprising four steps: DESCRIBE: describe the behavior to
derive an accurate characterization and the context in
which it occurs; INVESTIGATE: examine, exclude and
identify possible underlying causes of the behavior; CRE-
ATE: create and implement a treatment plan for the behav-
ior; and EVALUATE: assess what parts of the treatment
plan were attempted and effective. Within the DICE ap-
proach caregiver (expectations, caregiver stress/depression,
etc), PLWD (medical conditions, functional status, etc); and
environmental (overstimulation, lack of routines, etc) con-
tributions to BPSD are evaluated and addressed.
This project had three phases. In the first, we involved
end-users (e.g. family caregivers) in the design of a web-
based tool incorporating DICE that would: 1) be easy to
use; 2) be tailored to the PLWD and caregiver’s specific
behavioral concerns, environment and personal charac-
teristics; 3) teach new transferrable skills to the end-
users; 4) provide an alternative to the risks and limited
efficacy associated with medication treatment; and 5)
could be used throughout the disease course. In the sec-
ond phase, we engaged in iterative cycles of program-
ming, testing and refinement to translate evidence-based
treatment and knowledge into a usable tool (called the
WeCareAdvisor). These two phases are described in de-
tail in other manuscripts [29, 30].
In the third phase, we assessed the WeCareAdvisor tool
(WCA) with family caregivers in a pilot randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) to evaluate its one-month effect on care-
giver distress and caregiver confidence as compared to a
waitlist control group. A one-month time frame for tool
use was selected as appropriate for this pilot/proof of con-
cept study. Secondary outcomes included caregiver stress,
depression, burden, negative communication and relation-
ship closeness, and PLWD behavioral frequency and sever-
ity. This paper reports the outcomes of the RCT including
effects following one-month of tool use between an imme-
diate treatment group (WCA) and a wait-list control group
and then within group differences for the WCA and Wait-
list control groups following their one month tool use.
Methods
A two-site randomized controlled trial was conducted
with one-month intervention and follow-up after base-
line assessment targeting family caregivers of people
with dementia. The design of the trial is detailed in a
prior manuscript [30]. All three phases or the project
were approved in 2012 by Institutional Review Boards of
University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins University.
This study adhered to CONSORT guidelines.
Recruitment and eligibility
Participants were consecutively recruited beginning in
May 2015 through September 2016. They were recruited
from community and outpatient clinical sites in Ann
Arbor, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland by several
methods: provider or staff referral; on-site by research
staff; caregiver response to flyers in a participating site; or
participation in a previous trial. Interested caregivers were
screened for eligibility by telephone. Inclusion criteria in-
cluded: primary caregiver for a PLWD (clinical diagnosis
or MMSE< 24); residing with the PLWD or close by; man-
aging ≥ 1 behavioral symptom; English speaking; and fa-
miliarity
with
technology
(computer,
tablet
or
smartphone). Exclusion criteria included: caregiver sen-
sory impairment; and for the person with dementia:
imminent institutional placement, terminal illness, active
suicide risk, or not on a stable dose of psychotropic for at
least 60 days. Figure 1 depicts recruitment and study flow.
Procedures
Eligible caregivers were next scheduled for a baseline in-
home interview. Written consent from the caregiver and
the PLWD were obtained at that time, including the fact
that subjects could withdraw from the study at any point
in time. If the PLWD was unable to provide informed
consent, then proxy consent from the family caregiver
(and assent from the person with dementia) was ob-
tained. At the conclusion of the baseline interview, the
interviewer opened a randomization envelope determin-
ing group assignment. Those randomized to the Waitlist
control group (1-month wait) were informed of their as-
signment and an appointment in one-month was sched-
uled. Those assigned to receive the WeCareAdvisor
immediately (intervention) received: 1) an iPad with the
WeCareAdvisor website link; 2) optional email account
setup (if no prior email access); and 3) approximately
15-min instruction in use of the tool.
Two to three days after the baseline visit and there-
after weekly during the one-month of the intervention,
participants received a “check-in” phone call from a
study team member. The purpose of this call was to
trouble shoot problems with the tool and encourage tool
use. These calls were not of a clinical nature; staff used a
guiding script for the purpose of this call in order to an-
chor it around the tool, and limited the length of calls to
a maximum of 20 min.
One month after baseline, an in-home follow-up inter-
view was completed with both intervention and control
participants. For intervention participants, after outcome
assessment, the interviewer collected the iPad and their
study participation was concluded. For Waitlist controls,
identical procedures were followed as for the interven-
tion group at baseline, and this group began their one
month of tool use and was reassessed one month later.
Randomization
A randomization table was created by the University of
Michigan statistician in Stata, stratified by study site and
Kales et al. BMC Geriatrics  (2018) 18:113 
Page 3 of 12
 using random blocks of sizes 4,6 or 8, and provided to a
project manager at each site who was not involved in as-
sessment. The project manager created sequentially
numbered sealed envelopes containing group assign-
ment. Each consenting caregiver received the envelope
in the order in which they were enrolled. The project
manager had access to the spreadsheet that indicated
the randomization order but the research assistants who
performed
baseline
and
outcome
assessments
were
masked as to randomized condition.
Baseline assessments
Comprehensive assessments were performed to collect
data from caregivers and people with dementia on sev-
eral domains including: 1) demographics; and 2) physical
and mental health related characteristics; 3) and technol-
ogy experience (caregiver only). Primary and secondary
outcomes are below.
Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary study aim was to evaluate the extent to
which WCA impacted caregiver distress (measured by
the total of the distress items from a revised version of
the NPI-Q; in the revised version, we separated agitation
and aggression and added frequency for a total of 14
items, score range 0–70) and confidence in using activ-
ities to manage BPSD (five item scale, score range 0–50)
after one month of use. Caregiver distress was selected
as the primary outcome based on emerging evidence
that
it
may
be
a
more
important
predictor
of
institutionalization and inpatient and emergency depart-
ment use than the frequency and severity of the BPSD
themselves [6–9]. We expected that after one month of
WCA use, the intervention group would report less dis-
tress and greater confidence than those in the Waitlist
control group. We also expected that the Waitlist group
would experience similar benefits following their one
month of tool use.
Secondarily, we evaluated change in caregiver stress
(five-point likert scale ranging from 1 to 5), depression
(CES-D, 20 items, score range 0–60), burden (Zarit bur-
den scale,12-item, score range 12–60), negative commu-
nication (Negative Communication Scale, 6 items, score
range 6–30) and relationship closeness (Relationship

 Closeness Scale, 6-item, score range 6–24) and PLWD
behavioral frequency, severity, and total behavioral score
(NPI-Q revised version, separating agitation and aggres-
sion and adding frequency as in the NPI-C). Secondary
measures were chosen based upon those that are both
meaningful in clinical practice as well as appear to be
impacted by family caregiver interventions in prior trials
[18–20]. For a full description of measures, please see
the WeCareAdvisor protocol paper [30].
Intervention/components of the WeCareAdvisor tool
For a full description of the tool, please refer to the prior
paper describing its development [29]. Briefly, the tool
contains three main components.
� The first is a guided DICE approach where a peer
navigator (tailored to the age, race and gender of the
caregiver) leads the caregiver through the approach;
this occurs through the caregiver answering
questions related to symptom context (who, what,
when, where) and possible medical/pain issues
including delirium. Based upon these answers, an
algorithm selects from over 900 evidence-based
strategies to create a WeCareAdvisor “prescription”.
Caregivers are instructed to try the strategies for
one week and then evaluate how the strategies work
for them; if the strategies are helpful, they are en-
couraged to keep using them, if the strategies have
not been helpful, caregivers are encouraged to con-
duct another DICE session to get a new set of strat-
egies. During orientation, caregivers conducted their
first DICE session on the most problematic behavior
they were experiencing, and during their one-month
trial were encouraged to create as many sessions as
they feel would be helpful to them.
� The second component is the Caregiver Survival
Guide which is a compendium of information for
dementia caregivers (e.g. “what is dementia”, “keeping
the person with dementia healthy”) located in one
place for “one stop shopping”.
� The third component is a daily messaging feature
that provides an encouraging daily communication
to caregivers for support and motivation.
Analytic approach
Data management and analyses were coordinated at the
University of Michigan for both sites. For all outcome mea-
sures, summary descriptive statistics were calculated at
baseline and one month, for change scores from baseline to
one month by study group, and by site for one month to
two months (for the Waitlist control group). WCA-
associated change was estimated in a regression model with
change-scores
from
baseline
to
one
month
as
the
dependent variable, and an indicator for the intervention
group as the primary independent variable. The model ad-
justed for baseline values of the outcome variable (e.g. for
change in confidence, adjustment for baseline confidence)
and site (Ann Arbor vs. Baltimore). The parameter estimate
of the intervention group indicator allowed for testing of
the WCA effect on distress (or confidence) and estimated
expected changes in scores associated with the tool, adjust-
ing for baseline values. Due to presence of two participants
with missing follow-up data, to obtain unbiased estimates,
we also used a mixed model and obtained an estimate asso-
ciated with the tool by fitting a multilevel model with both
baseline and follow-up data as dependent variables. The
model included random intercepts for participants, site,
time, WeCare group, and time by WeCare group inter-
action term. Because the Waitlist controls received the tool
after a one-month delay, their change data from one to two
months was used to estimate additional effects in this
group. We also compared intervention to waitlist changes
in caregiver stress, depression, burden, negative communi-
cation, and relationship closeness as well as in the fre-
quency, severity and total score for behavioral symptoms in
PLWD.
Power consideration
Although this was a proof of concept and feasibility
Phase II trial, our proposed sample size of 30 dyads in
each study group (n = 60 total) was calculated to afford
80% power, based on a two-group 0.05 significance level
test, to detect a standardized effect size of 0.725, and the
margin of error for the effect size estimate with 95%
confidence calculated to be ± 0.51 standard deviation.
Results
Of 131 potential participants screened across the two
sites, 74 caregivers were eligible. Of eligible caregivers,
57 (77.02%) were willing to participate. A total of 55 (96.
5%) completed followup. The mean age of caregivers
was 65.9 ± 14.0 years old and the majority (75%) were fe-
male. Most (84%) had more than a high school educa-
tion and the majority (74%) were married and white
(63%). Almost half (49%) were spouses. Caregivers had a
mean of 4.1 ± 3.1 medical and 0.4 ± 0.6 mental health
conditions. Regarding PLWD, their mean age was 80.4
± 10.2 years old, most were female (63%), married (58%),
and white (65%). The mean MMSE was 16.5 ± 8.3, the
mean number of NPI behaviors 7.3 ± 3.1 and the mean
level of functional dependence 9.9 ± 4.3.
Table 1 shows baseline (T0) demographic characteristics
for caregivers and the PLWD in the WCA and Waitlist
control groups. A Wald χ2 test from a logistic regression
controlling for site indicated there were no significant
demographic differences between the two study groups.
Table 2 lists other characteristics for caregivers and the
PLWD showing no significant differences between the

 groups with the exception of caregiver confidence in using
activities to manage behaviors that was significantly higher
at baseline in the Waitlist group, based on a Wald χ2 test
from a logistic regression controlling for site.
We examined demographic and other characteristics by
study site using t-tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests
for categorical variables (Ann Arbor vs. Baltimore) where
several significant differences were noted: caregiver age
(mean of 62.0 ± 14.3 in Ann Arbor vs. 69.4 ± 12.9 in
Baltimore, p = 0.04), PLWD age (Ann Arbor mean 75.1
± 10.2 vs. Baltimore mean 85.1 ± 7.5, p < 0.001), MMSE
(Ann Arbor mean 19.7 ± 7.6 vs. Baltimore mean 14.1 ± 8.2,
p = 0.02) and functional dependence (Ann Arbor mean 8.0
± 4.4 vs. Baltimore mean 11.6 ± 3.4, p = 0.001).

 Tool use
Table 3 shows the heterogeneity of behaviors that care-
givers used the WCA for during the trial. The most
common behavior caregivers created DICE sessions for
was agitation (17.5%) followed by toileting (12.3%), ag-
gression (10.5%), and anxiety (10.5%). DICE sessions
were created for all 10 other behaviors but in fewer than
10% of caregivers each.
One-month Followup outcomes
Table 4 presents the results of unadjusted followup
outcomes.
Within group outcomes baseline to one month (T0-T1)
Based on a t-test, within the group that immediately re-
ceived the WeCareAdvisor tool, distress declined signifi-
cantly after their one month of tool use (6.08 ± 6.31
points, t = − 4.82, p < 0.0001); confidence increased after
tool use, but this increase was not significant (1.00 ± 11.
44 points, t = 0.45, p = 0.66). The frequency of behaviors
(− 3.60 ± 5.05 points, t = − 3.56, p = 0.002), severity of
behaviors (− 3.24 ± 3.87 points, t = − 4.19, p = 0.0003)
and NPI score (− 6.80 ± 10.73 points; t = − 3.17, p = 0.
004) were all significantly decreased in the WCA group
after one month of tool use. Distress (t = − 4.51, p < 0.
001), behavioral frequency (t = − 3.31, p = 0.0014), sever-
ity (t = − 3.76, p = 0.0003) and NPI score (t = − 2.53,
p = 0.0132) all remained significant after adjustment for
site. In the same timeframe, Waitlist control caregivers
showed a significant worsening (decrease) in confidence
(− 6.40 ± 10.30, t = − 3.40, p = 0.002).

 caregivers with improvement in distress (number of
caregivers who had any improvement in distress from
T0 to T1 divided by the total number of caregivers in
the group) over the Waitlist control group (73.1% vs. 46.
7%, χ2 = 4.01, df = 1, p = 0.04). Unadjusted analyses
using a t-test showed that the WCA group had a greater
decline in distress compared to the Waitlist control
group (t = − 2.49, p = 0.02). Results remained significant
after adjusting for site and baseline distress in a regres-
sion model (beta = − 3.71 p = 0.02) and in a mixed
model (beta = − 4.45, p = 0.02).
Caregiver confidence At one-month follow-up (T1), the
WCA group had a higher percentage of caregivers with im-
provement in confidence over the Waitlist control group
(42.3% vs. 26.7%), however this difference was not signifi-
cant based on a χ2 test (χ2 = 1.52, df = 1, p = 0.22). In
unadjusted analyses, the WCA group had a significantly
greater change in confidence than the Waitlist control
group (t-2.55, p = 0.01); note that this difference did not
indicate significant improvement in confidence in the
WCA group, but rather worsening confidence in the
Waitlist group. The difference was not significant in a
regression model after adjusting for site and baseline level
of confidence (beta = 4.48, p = 0.09), however, remained
significant in mixed model (beta = 7.52, p = .004).
Caregiver stress, depression, burden, negative com-
munication, relationship closeness No differences be-
tween study groups in these outcomes were found in
unadjusted and adjusted analyses using both regression
and mixed model.
Person living with dementia behavioral outcomes
There were no significant differences in behavioral
frequency, severity or overall NPI score (frequency by
severity) between the WCA and Waitlist groups at one-
month followup based on t-tests and in regression and
mixed models.
Waitlist control one-month within group outcomes (T1-T2)
A t-test indicated that the Waitlist control group showed
significant improvement in both primary outcomes after
their one month (T1 to T2) of tool use: distress significantly
decreased (3.72 ± 7.53 points, t = − 2.66, p = 0.013) and
confidence significantly improved (4.38 ± 5.17 points, t = 4.
56, p < 0.0001). This group also showed improvement in
stress (− 0.41 ± 1.02 points, t = − 2.19, p = 0.04), caregiver
burden (− 2.76 ± 7.26 points, t = − 2.05, p = 0.05), and nega-
tive communication (− 1.48 ± 2.96 points, t = − 2.70, p = 0.
012). PLWD in the Waitlist group also showed a significant
reduction in frequency of behaviors (− 1.86 ± 4.58 points,
t = − 2.19, p = 0.037) and trend-level reductions for severity
of behaviors (− 1.45 ± 4.50 points, t = − 1.73, p = 0.09) and
overall NPI score (− 5.00 ± 14.34 points, t = − 1.88, p = 0.
07).
The significant decline in distress between T1 and T2
for the Waitlist control group remained significant after
adjustment for site in a mixed model (beta = − 3.83,
p = 0.004) as did the significant improvement in confi-
dence (beta = 4.67, p = 0.009). However, stress (beta = −
0.43, p = 0.06) and the decrease in frequency of behav-
iors was not significant after adjustment for site in a
mixed model (beta = − 1.90, p = 0.075).
Figure 2a shows the pattern for caregiver distress for
the two study groups over the trial. Figure 2b shows the
pattern for caregiver confidence for the two study
groups over the trial. Figure 2c, d and e show behavioral
frequency, severity and overall NPI score for the two
groups across the trial.
Discussion
In this pilot RCT, we tested a novel web-based tool to
help caregivers manage BPSD on caregiver distress and
confidence over a one-month period. Use of the WCA
was associated with significant declines in caregiver dis-
tress in the primary comparison of the intervention
group vs. the waitlist control group, as well as after the
waitlist control group completed one month use of the
tool. The impact on caregiver confidence was less clear,
with unadjusted differences reflecting worsening of con-
fidence in the control group. Interestingly, however,
once the control group completed their use of the tool,
they showed improvement in confidence that remained
after adjustment. While PLWD behavioral frequency, se-
verity, and overall NPI score were null in the primary
comparison of the WCA vs. Waitlist group, within group
comparisons showed improvement with use of the tool
(for the WCA group, frequency, severity and total

 behavioral scores; for the Waitlist group, trend-level im-
provement in behavioral frequency).
The impact of the WeCareAdvisor on caregiver dis-
tress suggests that it could have a role in caregiver man-
agement of BPSD. Emerging evidence suggests that the
impact of behaviors on caregivers, manifested as distress,
is an important predictor of negative outcomes. Philp et
al. found that among 114 community-dwelling Scottish
people
with
dementia
supported
by
family
carers
followed for 2 years, caregiver perceptions of a behavior
as problematic rather than severity of a behavior inde-
pendently predicted institutionalization [9]. In a second
study of 119 Dutch PLWD and their caregivers followed
over five years, caregiver distress (measured using the
NPI as in the present study) itself was a significant
predictor of nursing home placement while behavior it-
self was not [8]. The authors noted that their findings
could indicate that a caregiver’s emotional reaction to a
particular behavior was more important than the behav-
ior per se in the decision to admit the person with de-
mentia to a nursing home. A meta-analysis of BPSD and
outcomes concluded that caregiver factors are more im-
portant
than
care-recipient
factors
in
predicting
institutionalization [6]. A recent analysis using retro-
spective, nationally representative data of participants
with dementia from the Aging, Demographics and
Memory study found that high levels of caregiver dis-
tress (rather than the BPSD themselves) were signifi-
cantly associated with emergency department visits,
hospitalizations,
and
costs
[7].

 evidence suggests that identifying and supporting care-
givers in distress is a worthy target in reducing the nega-
tive outcomes associated with BPSD.
Notably, outcomes related to caregiver confidence
were less clear. In part, this may be related to the higher
baseline level of mean confidence in the control group.
Another factor may be the confidence measure used in
this trial (that assesses confidence in using activities to
manage BPSD). This measure has been used in prior
studies of caregiver interventions related to the use of
tailored activities [18, 31]. While WeCareAdvisor applies
a number of strategies involving use of activity to man-
age some symptoms (e.g., agitated outbursts), activity
may be less relevant for other problems (e.g. for certain
toileting problems). While agitation was the most com-
mon problem behavior for which caregivers created
DICE sessions, the second most common was toileting;
in these cases, confidence using activities is an imperfect
measure. Thus, it is possible that this measure was not
sensitive to the broad array of behaviors that family
caregivers in this study were managing.
Similarly, while the findings for behavior change
trended in a promising direction, there was no signifi-
cant impact of WCA use on severity or frequency of
BPSD as compared to the control group in the primary
comparison. There may be several reasons for this. First,
we did not select for any behaviors (e.g. agitation) like
other trials and therefore heterogeneity (with behaviors
ranging from agitation to apathy to eating issues, etc)
may have impacted results. Second, one month may not
be enough time to impact behavioral outcomes; notably
most drug trials in BPSD are 8–10 weeks. These aspects
of our trial may have impacted the ability to effect over-
all stress level, depression, caregiver burden, negative
communications or relationship closeness.
Strengths of the study include development of a low
cost, easy to use, on-demand web-based intervention for
caregivers to address BPSD, developed with extensive
end-user feedback. Another strength is that the tool is
based upon the DICE Approach which emphasizes the
importance of looking for underlying causes (e.g. pain,
UTI) with symptoms like agitation. A final strength is
that this was a controlled trial with dyadic outcomes
which are critical in the evaluation of impact on BPSD.
Weaknesses include a control group with limited atten-
tion and support (e.g. the intervention group received
about 1 h more of staff contact via weekly check-in calls
about tool use over 1 month) and positive outcomes in
the primary comparison limited to caregiver distress.
While this small pilot RCT demonstrates feasibility and
a promising impact on caregiver distress, the size of and
limitations inherent in this study limit generalizability. A
future study will include a longer (three month) trial
with a larger more diverse sample including attention to

Conclusions
In our pilot RCT, use of the WCA resulted in significant
decrease in caregiver distress. Prior research has shown
that caregiver distress is an important predictor of nega-
tive BPSD outcomes including ED visits, hospitalizations
and nursing home placement. Future research will iden-
tify whether longer use of WCA can significantly impact
other caregiver and behavioral outcomes.
