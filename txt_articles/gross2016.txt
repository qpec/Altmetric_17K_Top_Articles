Abstract
Context: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a promising therapy for
non-neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and might also be a valuable option in
patients with an underlying neurological disorder.
Objective: We systematically reviewed all available evidence on the efficacy and safety
of TENS for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction.
Evidence acquisition: The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement.
Evidence synthesis: After screening 1943 articles, 22 studies (two randomised con-
trolled trials, 14 prospective cohort studies, five retrospective case series, and one case
report) enrolling 450 patients were included. Eleven studies reported on acute TENS and
11 on chronic TENS. In acute TENS and chronic TENS, the mean increase of maximum
cystometric capacity ranged from 69 ml to 163 ml and from 4 ml to 156 ml, the mean
change of bladder volume at first detrusor overactivity from a decrease of 13 ml to an
increase of 175 ml and from an increase of 10 ml to 120 ml, a mean decrease of
maximum detrusor pressure at first detrusor overactivity from 18 cmH20 to
72 cmH20 and 8 cmH20, and a mean decrease of maximum storage detrusor pressure
from 20 cmH20 to 58 cmH2O and from 3 cmH20 to 8 cmH2O, respectively. In chronic
TENS, a mean decrease in the number of voids and leakages per 24 h ranged from 1 to
3 and from 0 to 4, a mean increase of maximum flow rate from 2 ml/s to 7 ml/s, and a
mean change of postvoid residual from an increase of 26 ml to a decrease of 85 ml. No
TENS-related serious adverse events have been reported. Risk of bias and confounding
was high in most studies.

Introduction
Lower urinary tract dysfunction is common in neurological
patients resulting in symptoms that have a pronounced
effect on quality of life [1]. The site and nature of the
neurological lesion determines the pattern of dysfunction
[1,2]. The high prevalence of neurogenic lower urinary tract
dysfunction (NLUTD) is reflected by the wide distribution of
neural control in health and depends on the underlying
neurological disorder, for instance reaching about 25% in
patients with Alzheimer‘s disease and approaching 100% in
those suffering from multiple sclerosis at an advanced stage
[1,2]. NLUTD substantially impairs quality of life and lower
urinary tract function becomes one of the most relevant
aspects 
in 
daily 
life 
of 
the 
neuro-urological 
patient
[1,3]. Optimal treatment of storage and/or voiding symp-
toms is a main challenge in this population, especially
because conventional treatments often fail.
In 1974, Sundin et al [4] showed for the first time that
electrical pudendal stimulation resulted in the inhibition of
bladder contraction in cats. This technique was improved,
extended to different stimulation sites, and is now used as
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for the
treatment of various urological dysfunctions. Electrical
stimulation is applied continuously or is event driven. TENS
is reported to be a potent and safe treatment option, both in
patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain [5,6] and non-
neurogenic overactive bladder syndrome [7,8]. Positive
treatment effects might also be expected in patients with an
underlying neurological disorder. We therefore performed a
systematic review to assess and appraise all available
evidence on the efficacy and safety of TENS for treating
NLUTD.
2. 
Evidence acquisition
2.1. 
Data sources and searches
This systematic review was performed according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses Statement [9]. The protocol for the review is
available on PROSPERO (CRD42014008678) (http://www.
crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO). 
We 
systematically 
searched
Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, and Health Technology Assessment Database (from
January 1, 1946 to January 23, 2015). No language or date
restrictions were applied. We additionally searched the
reference list of all included studies and any relevant review
articles. The search strategies are available in the Supple-
mentary data.
2.2. 
Study selection
We aimed to include all original studies that reported
efficacy and/or safety data on TENS for treating NLUTD,
including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), comparative
non-RCTs, and single-arm cohort studies. Nonoriginal
articles, studies not published as full-text, those including
children only, and those not discriminating between non-
neurological and neurological patients were excluded. Only
outcomes, which were reported in more than three studies,
were included in the analyses. There was no language
restriction. All identified abstracts were imported into a
bibliography management software (EndNote X5 [M.P.S.] or
X7 [T.G., T.M.K.]; Thomson Reuters, PA, USA) and sorted
according to inclusion and exclusion folders by drag and
drop. Abstracts of all identified studies were independently
reviewed by two authors (T.G. and M.P.S.). Studies reporting
on TENS (defined as any transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation) for treating NLUTD (defined as any type of
lower urinary tract dysfunction caused by a neurological
disorder) were reviewed in full text.
2.3. 
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
The variables assessed included year of publication, study
type, number of patients, sex and age, underlying neuro-
logical disorder, duration of neurological disorder, acute (ie,
stimulation during urodynamic investigation only) and
chronic (ie, daily upon weekly stimulation during 3–102 wk
before neuro-urological re-assessment), stimulation site
(clitoral/penile, vaginal/rectal, sacral dermatome, or supra-
pubic), stimulation frequencies, pulse widths, stimulation
signs (perception threshold and/or toes’ plantar flexion) and
durations, TENS effects on urodynamic parameters and
bladder diary variables, and any adverse events. Data from
eligible reports were extracted (by treatment group in
comparative studies) in duplicate (T.G. and M.P.S.) and
discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (T.M.K.).
The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used for
RCTs [10]. This included the assessment of sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of partici-
pants, therapists, and outcome assessors, completeness of
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other
potential sources of bias (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2).
Risk of bias in noncomparative studies cannot be
assessed with the approach described above. Therefore,
concern was extended in noncomparative studies to
address external validity by assessing whether study
participants were selected consecutively or were represen-
tative of a wider patient population and whether specified
Conclusions: Although preliminary data suggest TENS might be effective and safe for treating
neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, the evidence base is poor and more reliable data
from well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to make definitive conclusions.
Patient summary: Early data suggest that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
might be effective and safe for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, but
more reliable evidence is required.

 confounding factors were reported. A list of the three most
important potential confounders for efficacy and safety
outcomes was developed with clinical content experts
(European Association of Urology Neuro-Urology guidelines
panel). For each study, we asked whether each prognostic
confounder was considered and whether, if necessary, the
confounder was controlled for in analysis. The potential
confounding factors are underlying neurological disorder
(eg, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, etc), sex, and
type of therapy (acute or chronic TENS). Attrition bias and
selective outcome reporting were also assessed. This is also
a pragmatic approach informed by methodological litera-
ture [10].
2.4. 
Data synthesis
Effect estimates of TENS were calculated as the difference
(d) between study completion X1 and baseline X0, that is,
6–12 wk after baseline. For each study the variance at time
point x was calculated, using the standard deviation (SD)x
and 
group 
size 
n, 
as: 
VAR = SDx
2/n. 
The 
correlation
coefficient was assumed to be 0.5, being a conservative
value that leads to the highest variance. Thus, the variance
of d (VARd) was: VARX0 + VARX1 –2*0.5*H(VARX0 * VARX1)
and the corresponding SDd = Hn * VARd. In case of missing
SDx these were imputed taking the largest of reported
SDx. Pooling of data via meta-analysis was planned for RCTs
but it was not possible since outcome measures of the
different studies varied widely and only two RCTs were
available. In non-RCTs, no data pooling was planned due to
different study designs and the expected clinical and
methodological heterogeneity of included studies. Howev-
er, forest plots were generated in order to provide a visual
representation 
of 
results 
to 
show 
the 
direction 
and
magnitude of effects. This was performed using the metan
command of the Stata statistics software package (Stata
14.0 statistics software package; StataCorp 2015. Stata
Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX, USA).
Risk of bias summary and graphs (Supplementary Fig.
1 and 2) were generated using Cochrane RevMan software
(RevMan v 5.3; Informatics and Knowledge Management
Department, London, UK).

 patients was 46 yr. Patients suffered from multiple sclerosis
(n = 150), incomplete spinal cord injury (n = 70), complete
spinal cord injury (n = 79), spinal cord injury not otherwise
specified (n = 36), cerebrovascular accident (n = 78), herni-
ated disk (n = 9), Parkinson’s disease (n = 5), and others
(n = 23). Eleven (all non-RCTs) studies reported on acute
and 11 (two RCTs, nine non-RCTs) on chronic TENS, 15 on
clitoral/penile, two on vaginal/rectal, three on sacral, and
two on suprapubic stimulation (Table 1).
3.3. 
Efficacy of TENS
Treatment outcomes of RCTs and non-RCTs are shown in
Tables 2–4. In acute and chronic TENS, the mean increase of
maximum cystometric capacity (Fig. 2A) ranged from 69 ml
to 163 ml and from 4 ml to 156 ml, respectively. The mean
change of bladder volume at first detrusor overactivity (Fig.
2B) ranged from a decrease of 13 ml to an increase of 175 ml
and from an increase of 10 ml to 120 ml, respectively. In
acute and chronic TENS, the mean decrease of maximum
detrusor pressure at first detrusor overactivity (Fig. 2C)
ranged from 18 cmH20 to 72 cmH20 and 8 cmH20,
respectively, and the mean decrease of maximum storage
detrusor pressure (Fig. 2D) ranged from 20 cmH20 to 58
cmH2O and from 3 cmH20 to 8 cmH2O, respectively. In
chronic TENS, the mean decrease in the number of voids per
24 h (Fig. 2E) and in the number of leakages per 24 h (Fig.
2F) ranged from 1 to 3 and from 0 to 4, respectively. The
mean increase of maximum flow rate (Fig. 2G) ranged from
2 ml/s to 7 ml/s and the mean change of postvoid residual
(Fig. 2H) ranged from an increase of 26 ml to a decrease of
85 ml.
3.4. 
Safety of TENS
One patient did not tolerate stimulation and therefore
therapy had to be stopped [30]. No other adverse events
have been reported (Table 1).
3.5. 
Risk of bias and confounding
The risk of bias and confounding was relevant in both RCTs
and non-RCTs (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2). In particular, a
high risk of selective outcome reporting bias was found.
4. 
Discussion
4.1. 
Principal findings
The positive impact on urodynamic (maximum cysto-
metric capacity, maximum detrusor pressure at first
detrusor overactivity, maximum storage detrusor pres-
sure, and maximum flow rate) and bladder diary (voids per
24 h, leakages per 24 h) parameters as well as the
favourable adverse event profile, indicate that TENS might
be effective and safe for treating NLUTD. This is underlined
by the statistically significant differences between the
treatment and control group in the RCT by Guo et al [12]

 the inaccuracy of the evidence appears to be high with
some controversial findings. Most of the studies are small
and underpowered, especially to allow for subgroup
analyses (for instance comparison of different stimulation
sites, stimulation parameters and duration, different
neurological disorders, and different urodynamic pat-
terns). In addition, there is significant risk of bias and
confounding.
4.2. 
Findings in the context of existing evidence
In recent years, neuromodulation therapies using electrical
stimulation of peripheral nerves such as the sacral nerve
roots, tibial nerve, pudendal nerve, and dorsal genital
nerves have become more and more popular in the
urological community. Clitoral and penile electrodes are
used stimulating the dorsal clitoral nerve and dorsal penile
nerve in women and men, respectively. Electrodes are also
placed into the vagina and rectum resulting in a stimulation
of the pudendal nerve and the inferior rectal nerve.
Although the stimulation sites are different and the exact
mechanism 
of 
action 
remains 
to 
be 
elucidated, 
the
modulation 
of 
spinal 
cord-mediated 
reflexes 
through
interneurons and brain networks by peripheral afferents
seem to be involved [33]. Indeed, dorsal clitoral nerve
stimulation during bladder filling in healthy women
reduced the activation of certain cortical areas suggesting
a neuromodulation effect on supraspinal centres relevant
for lower urinary tract control [34]. However, there is a
complete lack of literature about the mechanism of action of
TENS for treating NLUTD so appropriately designed studies
are highly warranted.
Previous systematic reviews showed beneficial effects
of sacral neuromodulation [35] and tibial nerve stimula-
tion [36] for treating NLUTD, but the quality of evidence is
still low. In a recent RCT, it was found that TENS is as
effective as oxybutynin for the treatment of overactive
bladder in children [37]. However, no similar comparative
study is available assessing the effect of TENS for treating
adult patients with an underlying neurological disorder.
4.3. 
Implications for research
Although 
the 
findings 
of 
our 
systematic 
review 
are
promising, plausibility has to be added through appropri-
ately designed RCTs, especially to assess the reproducibility
of results for different underlying neurological disorders
and stimulation parameters. RCTs investigating treatment
effects in different neurological disorders using urody-
namics, bladder diary, validated disease- and condition-
specific questionnaires, as well as cost-effectiveness data
are needed to generate high-level evidence allowing
appropriate conclusions for daily clinical practice. Impor-
tantly, there are no treatment standards for TENS and no
guidelines for therapeutic regimes and these need to be
developed through further studies. Moreover, individual
adjustment of stimulation parameters by analogy with
sacral neuromodulation might improve outcomes and
warrants additional investigations.

 4.4. 
Implications for practice
NLUTD is not a homogenous entity and can result from a
wide 
range 
of 
neurological 
disorders 
[1]. 
Thus, 
the
treatment goal of TENS varies between different neurologi-
cal disorders and includes achieving urinary continence,
improving quality of life, preventing urinary tract infection,
and protecting the upper urinary tract (renal function).
This highlights the importance of prospective studies to
investigate disease-specific TENS outcomes.
The benefits of TENS are that it is noninvasive, associated
with few adverse events, and easy to self-apply at home by

on sexual and bowel dysfunction may occur.
4.5. 
Limitations of this study
This report is the first systematic review assessing and
appraising all available evidence of TENS for treating NLUTD
and several limitations need to be addressed. Included
studies are mostly cohort studies with a before-and-after
treatment design and besides the two RCTs no study had a
comparator. This is a major issue, as a placebo effect might be
relevant but could not be assessed appropriately. Primary
outcomes and methodology varied widely and in about one
quarter of results SDs for baseline and follow-up measure-
ments were missing and had to be imputed. As the estimate
of the covariance was not reported we thus assumed it to be
0.5. We therefore make attentive to cautious interpreting of
the summary figures reported. However, since we aimed to
summarise existing evidence, we consider our approach to be
acceptable. The included studies reported either on acute or
chronic TENS, but not on both, and various clinically relevant
outcome parameters were not consistently investigated such
as subjective versus objective stimulation effects, duration of
TENS effects, impact on comorbidities such as neurogenic
sexual and bowel dysfunction as well as spasticity, and
patient adherence to TENS. Moreover, studies were small and
outcomes varied widely. Thus, scarcity of data did not allow
for subgroup analyses (for instance comparison of different
stimulation sites, stimulation parameters and duration,
different neurological disorders, and different urodynamic
patterns). Finally, the risk of bias and confounding was
substantial (in both RCTs and non-RCTs) and more reliable
evidence is urgently required. Despite these limitations,
TENS seems to become a valuable treatment option before
more invasive therapies (which mostly lack high-level
evidence data) are considered.
5. 
Conclusions
Preliminary evidence indicates that TENS is an effective and
safe treatment option for patients with NLUTD. However,
quality of evidence was low, especially due to a lack of well-
designed, appropriately sampled, and powered RCTs. This
systematic review demonstrated the potential of TENS for
treating NLUTD and identified the need for more reliable
data in order to make definitive conclusions.
