Abstract
Objectives: We assess the association between marital quality and both the risk of developing diabetes and the management 
of diabetes after its onset in later life.
Method: We use data from the first two waves of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project to estimate regression 
models with lagged dependent variables. The sample includes 1,228 married respondents, among whom 389 were diabetic. 
Those with either a reported diagnosis or with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% are identified diabetic. We categorize diabetic respondents 
into three groups: controlled, undiagnosed, and uncontrolled diabetes. We conduct factor analysis to construct positive and 
negative marital quality scales.
Results: For women, an increase in positive marital quality between Waves 1 and 2 is related to a lower risk of being 
diabetic at Wave 2, net of diabetes status at Wave 1; surprisingly, for men, an increase in negative marital quality between 
Waves 1 and 2 is related to both a lower risk of being diabetic at Wave 2 and a higher chance of controlling diabetes at 
Wave 2 after its onset.
Discussion: Our results challenge the traditional assumption that negative marital quality is always detrimental to health 
and encourage family scholars to distinguish different sources and types of negative marital quality.
Keywords:  Diabetes—Disease management—Gender—Marital quality—Marriage
Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic condition in the 
United States. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC), 25.8 million Americans—8.3% of the 
population—had diabetes in 2010 (CDC, 2011); these fig-
ures rose rapidly to 29.1 million and 9.3% in 2012 (CDC, 
2014). The consequences of diabetes are clearly recognized 
and include serious complications and premature death 
(CDC, 2014). In the United States, diabetes remains the 
seventh leading cause of death (CDC, 2014). Because dia-
betes can be controlled, the risk of complications lowered, 
and the onset of disease delayed, identifying risk factors is 
extremely important in designing effective prevention strat-
egies and management programs. Yet previous research on 
diabetes has mostly focused on proximate behavioral risk 
factors, such as diet and exercise, ignoring upstream causes 
of social factors that lead to the development of the dis-
ease. In this study, we assess marital quality as one of the 
social factors that may shape both the risk and manage-
ment of diabetes. Diabetes risk refers to the presence of any 
physiological or functional state that is a step on the way 
to diabetes, and diabetes management refers to a systematic 
process of diagnosis, monitoring, and control of diabetes 
after the onset of the disease.
Marriage is a unique type of social relationship in 
which spouses share space and resources, make invest-
ments together, and influence each other’s health behaviors

 (Umberson, 1992; Waite & Gallagher, 2000). Marital qual-
ity—spouses’ subjective appraisal of the marital relationship, 
including satisfaction, happiness, strain, and conflict—has a 
profound influence on each partner’s life context and thus 
on his or her health (Carr, Cornman, & Freedman, 2016; 
Umberson, Williams, Powers, Liu, & Needham, 2006). 
Marital quality influences how people manage their health 
and is especially important for diseases and conditions that 
rely on self-management. Diabetes is one such disease; it 
requires a day-to-day self-care regimen (Trief et al., 2006). 
Support from a good-quality marriage or conflict from a 
poor-quality marriage may promote or disrupt adherence to 
diabetes care regimens (Trief et al., 2006).
To date, empirical evidence of marital quality’s effect on dia-
betes is limited and primarily based on cross-sectional studies 
and clinical or community samples (Robles & Kiecolt-Glaser, 
2003). Moreover, although gender differences have been a 
central focus of research on health links to marriage, empirical 
evidence is quite mixed. Some studies suggest a stronger effect 
of marital quality on health for women, some report stronger 
effects on men, and still other studies find no significant gen-
der differences (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001; Whisman, 
Li, Sbarra, & Raison, 2014). To fill these research gaps, we 
analyze data from the first two waves of the National Social 
Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) to address two 
major research questions: (1) How is marital quality related to 
diabetes risk and management over time among older adults? 
and (2) Do those patterns vary by gender?
Marital Quality and Diabetes Risk
Scholars have long recognized that married people have 
better health and live longer than unmarried people (Liu, 
2012; Waite & Gallagher, 2000; Zhang & Hayward, 2006). 
Recent research suggests that marital quality is more sig-
nificant than marital status per se in shaping health (Liu 
& Waite, 2014; Umberson, Williams, Powers, Liu, & 
Needham, 2006). Two of the primary theories to explain 
the links between marriage and health are the social con-
trol model and the stress model. The social control perspec-
tive on marriage suggests that spouses may regulate each 
other’s health behaviors (such as encouraging the spouse to 
quit smoking, reduce drinking, do exercise, or eat healthier 
food), comprising a source of social control that presumably 
promotes healthier behaviors and thus better health (Tucker 
& Anders, 2001; Umberson, 1992). The social control pro-
cess is more likely to happen in the desired direction within 
a supportive rather than a strained relationship (Kotwal, 
Lauderdale, Waite, & Dale, 2016). In fact, marital stress 
may increase unhealthy behaviors either by undermining 
individuals’ self-control or via reducing the spouse’s behav-
ior regulation (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001; Umberson, 
1992). Engaging in such unhealthy behaviors, such as over-
eating, adopting a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, or drinking 
alcohol, may contribute to diabetes exacerbation and com-
plications (Marshall & Flyvbjerg, 2006).
Moreover, according to the stress model, the marital rela-
tionship is a key dimension of adulthood life that may affect 
health by modifying stress exposure (Robles & Kiecolt-
Glaser, 2003). For example, ongoing marital conflict may 
expose spouses to chronic stress and lead to psychological 
distress that may increase the risk of chronic inflammation 
and in turn poor physical health (Umberson et al., 2006). 
Marital stress may also directly trigger the “fight-or-flight” 
process, in which the sympathetic nervous system induces 
the release of stress hormones (e.g., catecholamines and cor-
tisol) and evokes physiological responses that increase the 
metabolization of glucose (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001; 
Taylor et al., 2000). Consistent high blood glucose levels, 
along with inadequate levels of insulin or insulin resistance, 
increase the risk of developing diabetes (American Diabetes 
Association, 2010). In contrast, involvement in a happy 
marriage presumably provides social support and a safe 
haven that may reduce exposure to stress, aid in recovery 
from stress, and promote a healthy lifestyle, all of which 
may enhance both emotional and physical health (Carr 
et al., 2016; Waite & Gallagher, 2000).
Empirical studies have examined how marital quality 
relates to certain risk factors for diabetes, such as inflam-
mation or metabolic syndrome (Whisman, Uebelacker, & 
Settles, 2010). Yet little research examines the effect of 
social factors on the onset of diabetes. One of the very few 
national studies of diabetes prevalence in a population-
based sample finds that men who reported more positive 
marital exchanges were less likely to have diabetes, whereas 
men who reported more negative marital exchanges were 
more likely to have diabetes; no relationship appeared for 
women (Whisman et al., 2014). Because this study used 
cross-sectional data to examine marital exchanges among 
those with and without diabetes, it provides no informa-
tion on the effect of marital quality on the development 
of diabetes. The associations may reflect responses to the 
disease rather than causes of it. Taken together, previous 
literature leads us to expect that:
Hypothesis 1:  
Those with higher levels of negative 
marital quality will show greater risk 
of incident diabetes than those with 
lower levels of negative marital quality, 
and those with higher levels of positive 
marital quality will show lower risk of 
incident diabetes than those with lower 
levels of positive marital quality.
Marital Quality and Diabetes Diagnosis and 
Management
Diagnosis of diabetes depends on access to medical care, 
whereas management of the disease largely depends on 
a daily regimen of self-care (Trief et al., 2006). Diabetes 
diagnosis is the first step of the disease management pro-
cess. Early detection of diabetes prompts timely treatment

1071
 and can delay onset of neurological and vascular dam-
age that can result from uncontrolled spikes and falls in 
blood glucose (Marshall & Flyvbjerg, 2006). Because most 
symptoms of diabetes are mild and may go unnoticed, 
diagnosis depends heavily on regular medical examina-
tions (Marshall & Flyvbjerg, 2006). According to the social 
control perspective on marriage, a supportive spouse, 
especially the wife, may take a primary role in reminding 
the partner to have regular medical checkups that gener-
ally include screening for diabetes (Kotwal et al., 2016). 
A supportive marriage may also facilitate the treatment 
of diabetes once diagnosed. Diabetes regulation and treat-
ment includes medication, diet, glucose level monitoring, 
and lifestyle habits (Lutfey & Freese, 2005). Support from 
a spouse may indirectly promote adherence to a diabetes 
care regimen through spouses’ control of health behaviors 
(e.g., taking medicine and quitting alcohol) that increase 
the chances of controlling blood glucose levels (Trief, 
Ploutz-Snyder, Britton, & Weinstock, 2004). A happy mar-
riage may also directly promote self-regulation: it may 
motivate a diabetes patient to comply with doctor’s rec-
ommendations and maintain a healthy diet and regular 
exercise routine (Trief et al., 2004), all of which promote 
blood glucose control. In contrast, marital stress may dis-
rupt adherence to a diabetes management regimen, either 
by affecting patients’ own behavior and decision making or 
by reducing spouses’ involvement in patients’ disease man-
agement (August, Rook, Franks, & Parris Stephens, 2013). 
Moreover, the stress model suggests that marital stress may 
directly stimulate the release of stress hormones that causes 
blood sugar to rise and makes the disease control process 
harder, whereas a happy marriage may reduce the patient’s 
exposure to stress and thus improve the efficiency of the 
disease control efforts.
No nationally representative, population-based stud-
ies have assessed the relationship between marital quality 
and diabetes diagnosis and management, but a few clini-
cal studies provide evidence that supports our reasoning 
(Robles & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003; Trief, Himes, Orendorff, 
& Weinstock, 2001; Trief, Wade, Britton, & Weinstock, 
2002; Trief et al., 2006). For example, Trief and colleagues 
(2001) analyzed 78 diabetic patients aged 18–55 years and 
found that those with better marital quality were more 
content with the process of adjusting to the disease and 
experienced less stress from diabetes than those with worse 
marital quality. A similar study by Trief and colleagues 
(2002) followed up with 61 diabetic respondents 2 years 
later and found that better marital quality predicted more 
satisfaction with diabetes management and greater diabe-
tes-related quality of life. Another study of 134 elderly dia-
betic patients showed that greater marital stress was related 
to worse control of blood glucose levels (Trief et al., 2006). 
These clinical studies generally conclude that marital qual-
ity is directly correlated with diabetes management and that 
diabetics who have better marital adjustment and higher 
levels of intimacy adapt better to the disease and experience 
less distress from management regimens (Trief et al., 2001; 
Trief et al., 2002). Taken together, we expect that:
Hypothesis 2:  
Those with higher levels of negative marital 
quality will be less likely to be diagnosed 
with diabetes after its onset and also less 
likely to control it than those with lower 
levels of negative marital quality, and 
those with higher levels of positive marital 
quality will be more likely to be diagnosed 
with diabetes after its onset and also more 
likely to control it than those with lower 
levels of positive marital quality.
Gender Differences
On average, men receive more health-promotion benefits (e.g., 
emotional support and regulation of health behaviors) from 
their marriages than do women, and women’s health seems 
to be more vulnerable to marital stress than men’s (Kiecolt-
Glaser & Newton, 2001; Liu & Waite, 2014). Women’s met-
abolic systems also appear to be more responsive to marital 
strain than men’s (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001). Because 
women are generally more sensitive than men are to the qual-
ity of a relationship, women in strained marriages have a 
greater incidence of depression (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 
2001) that increases the risk of diabetes (Carnethon, Kinder, 
Fair, Stafford, & Fortmann, 2003). A handful of clinical stud-
ies confirm this view and conclude that marital conflict tends 
to evoke greater and more persistent physiological changes 
(e.g., increases in glucose levels) in women than in men 
(Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001). However, a more recent 
population-based national study finds that marital quality 
relates to men’s risk of diabetes but not women’s (Whisman 
et al., 2014). This mixed evidence reflects gender differences 
in the physiological mechanisms and health outcomes the 
studies measured as well as different samples and research 
designs. To the extent that women appear both physiologi-
cally and psychologically more reactive to marital stress than 
men (Donoho, Crimmins, & Seeman, 2013), we expect that:
Hypothesis 3:  
The associations between marital quality 
and diabetes risk and management will 
be stronger for women than for men.
Additional Sociodemographic Covariates
In addition to health behaviors (indicated by the social 
control model) and psychological distress (indicated by 
the stress model), both marital quality and diabetes are 
associated with other sociodemographic characteristics. 
The risk of diabetes increases with age (American Diabetes 
Association, 2010), and it also becomes more difficult to 
control this disease at older ages (CDC, 2011; Trief et al., 
2006). Previous studies also suggest that marital quality 
tends to decline with age (Umberson et al., 2005). Diabetes 
is more prevalent among blacks and people with lower 
1072 
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 6
 socioeconomic status (e.g., lower education and lower 
family income) than among whites and people with higher 
socioeconomic status (CDC, 2014; Lutfey & Freese, 2005). 
Marital quality is also lower among the former groups than 
the latter (Umberson et al., 2005).
Data
We use the first two waves of data from the NSHAP that was 
conducted by National Opinion Research Center (NORC) 
at the University of Chicago. A nationally representative 
probability sample of community-dwelling individuals 
aged 57–85 years was selected across the United States and 
screened in 2004. African Americans, Latinos, men, and 
those 75–84 years old were over sampled. We use the survey 
data analysis commands in Stata to weight all analyses and 
adjust them for clustering and stratification resulting from 
the complex sampling design (StataCorp, 2012).
The first wave of the NSHAP included a sample of 
3,005 adults aged 57–85 years who were interviewed in 
2005 or 2006 (Waite, Laumann, Levinson, Lindau, & 
O’Muircheartaigh, 2014). Both in-home interviews and lab 
tests and assays were conducted. Wave 2 consisted of 2,261 
Wave 1 respondents who were reinterviewed in 2010 or 
2011 (Waite, Cagney, et al., 2014). We restrict our analysis 
to the 1,250 respondents who remained married and who 
were interviewed in both waves. Results (data not shown 
but available upon request) suggest that in comparison with 
those who were interviewed in both waves, those who were 
lost to follow-up between waves are more likely to be dia-
betic, older, with lower levels of education and family income. 
This suggests that our sample may have excluded respond-
ents who are relatively more disadvantaged—indicating 
a potentially more conservative finding. We further delete 
cases with missing values (n = 22) on key variables, includ-
ing Wave 1 marital quality and Wave 2 diabetes. We draw 
two subsamples to analyze diabetes risk and management 
respectively. To analyze diabetes risk, we use the total sample 
of 1,228 respondents who were married and interviewed in 
both waves (with and without diabetes at baseline). To ana-
lyze diabetes management, we further restrict the sample to 
the 389 respondents who were diabetic at Wave 2.
Measures
Diabetes Risk and Management
To measure diabetes, we combine the biological and self-
reported measures. The NSHAP directly measured glyco-
sylated hemoglobin, or HbA1c, a biological marker that 
is useful in diagnosing and treating diabetes (Gomero, 
McDade, Williams, & Lindau, 2008). During the home inter-
views, blood was collected via a single finger-stick using a 
retractable tip, single-use disposable lancet, and then applied 
to filter paper for transport and storage. Gomero et al. (2008) 
describe the procedures of NSHAP HbA1c measurement 
in detail. Following the recommendations of the American 
Diabetes Association (2010), we identify respondents as hav-
ing diabetes when their HbA1c is ≥6.5%. Additional analyses 
(results not shown) using a different cutoff point of HbA1c 
at 5.7%—usually used for identifying prediabetes (American 
Diabetes Association, 2010)—showed similar results. In 
addition, respondents were asked whether they had ever 
been told by a medical doctor that they had diabetes or high 
blood sugar. Based on responses to this question, along with 
the measures of HbA1c, we created two variables to measure 
diabetes risk and diabetes management separately.
We measure diabetes risk as a dichotomous outcome 
with the value of 1 indicating respondents who either 
reported a diagnosis of diabetes or showed an HbA1c 
≥6.5%; we assigned the value of 0 to all others. Among 
those who have diabetes, we further measure diabetes 
management with three categories: (1) normal blood sugar 
reading but diagnosed with diabetes (referred as “con-
trolled” diabetic group), (2) high blood sugar reading but 
no diagnosis of diabetes (referred as “undiagnosed” dia-
betic group), and (3) high blood sugar reading and diag-
nosed diabetes (referred as “uncontrolled” diabetic group). 
The controlled diabetic group is the reference group in the 
analysis of diabetes management.
Marital Quality
Marital quality consists of both positive and negative 
dimensions that are not opposite ends of a single dimension 
but distinct constructs. A marriage may be high, for exam-
ple, on both positive and negative dimensions (Umberson 
et al., 2006). We follow previous studies (e.g., Galinsky & 
Waite, 2014; Liu & Waite, 2014; Warner & Adams, 2016) 
to calculate marital quality scales using the NSHAP data. 
These scales are composed of 8 items that we recoded to 
obtain consistent response categories across all items. First, 
respondents were asked how close they felt their relation-
ship with the spouse was (Item 1). Responses range from 1 
(not very close or somewhat close) to 3 (extremely close). 
Respondents were also asked how happy they were in their 
marriage (Item 2: 1 [very unhappy] to 7 [very happy]) and 
how emotionally satisfied they felt with their marriage (Item 
3: 0 [not at all] to 4 [extremely]). Because Items 2 and 3 
were highly skewed, we collapsed the categories. For rela-
tionship happiness, we collapsed the values to: 1 = Unhappy 
(1, 2, 3, 4), 2 = Happy (5, 6), and 3 = Very Happy (7). For 
emotional satisfaction, we collapsed the values to 1 = Not 
Satisfied (0, 1, 2), 2 = Satisfied (3), and 3 = Very Satisfied (4).
Additionally, respondents were asked the extent to 
which they preferred to spend their free time doing things 
with their spouse (Item 4). Responses included (1) mostly 
together, (2) some together and some apart, and (3) mostly 
apart. We reverse coded this item so that higher values 
indicate better marital quality. Finally, respondents were 
asked four questions about their spouse: how often they 
could open up to the spouse if they needed to talk about 
their worries (Item 5), how often they could rely on the 
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 6 
1073
 spouse for help if they had a problem (Item 6), how often 
the spouse made too many demands on them (Item 7), and 
how often the spouse criticized them (Item 8). Responses 
to each question (Items 5–8) are 1 (never, hardly ever, or 
rarely), 2 (some of the time), and 3 (often).
Results from exploratory factor analyses suggest that 
these 8 items form two different dimensions that we refer 
to as positive and negative marital quality. We create 
two factor scores for positive and negative marital qual-
ity based on the iterated principle factor method and an 
oblique rotation. Table 1 shows the factor loadings of each 
item. The validity and reliability of these marital qual-
ity measures are well justified in previous studies (e.g., 
Galinsky & Waite, 2014; Liu & Waite, 2014; Warner & 
Adams, 2016).
Other Covariates
We include three types of covariates (all measured at Wave 
1) that relate to both marital quality and diabetes: sociode-
mographic covariates, psychological distress, and health 
behavior-related covariates.
Sociodemographic Covariates
We stratify all analyses by gender. We create three age cat-
egories: 57–64 (reference), 65–74, and 75–85. Race ethnic-
ity includes non-Hispanic white (reference), non-Hispanic 
black, Hispanic, and other. We divide education into four 
categories: no diploma (reference), high school gradu-
ate, some college, and college graduate. We derive family 
income from a question that asked respondents to compare 
their family income level to that of other American families. 
Responses include below average (reference), average, and 
above average. We create a “missing” indicator category for 
about 15% of the analytic sample without valid values on 
family income.
Psychological distress
We control for depression, which is measured by a sum of an 
11-question subset of the Center for Epidemiological Studies 
Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Respondents 
were asked how often in the past week they experienced 
any of the following: (1) I did not feel like eating; (2) I felt 
depressed; (3) I felt that everything I did was an effort; (4) 
My sleep was restless; (5) I was happy; (6) I felt lonely; (7) 
People were unfriendly; (8) I enjoyed life; (9) I felt sad; (10) 
I felt that people disliked me; and (11) I could not get going. 
Response categories ranged from rarely or none of the time 
(0) to most of the time (3). We recode these items such that 
higher values indicate higher levels of depression.
Health Behavior-Related Covariates
Because respondents may take medications for diabetes, we 
include an indicator for taking any diabetes medications 
(1 = Yes, 0 = No). We also control indicators for currently 
smoke (1 = Yes, 0 = No), currently drink alcohol (1 = Yes, 
0 = No), physical exercise (1 = vigorous physical activ-
ity or exercise three times or more per week, 0 = others), 
and body mass index (BMI). Although BMI is not a direct 
measure for health behaviors, it is closely related to eating 
behaviors. We use measured height and weight to calcu-
late BMI and group results into four categories: normal or 
underweight (BMI <25), overweight (25 ≥ BMI < 30), obese 
(30 ≥ BMI < 40), and morbidly obese (BMI ≥40) (WHO 
Expert Committee, 1995). Missing values on BMI (about 
4%) were imputed with the mean. Excluding these cases 
and including them as a separate category led to similar 
results.
Analytic Approach
We use lagged dependent variables to analyze the incidence 
of diabetes between two waves. Specifically, we use Wave 
1 marital quality and change in marital quality between 
Waves 1 and 2 to predict Wave 2 diabetes, controlling 
for Wave 1 diabetes and all other covariates. We estimate 
binary logistic regression models to assess diabetes risk 
and multinomial logistic regression models to assess dia-
betes management as predicted by marital quality. Because 
our preliminary analysis revealed similar results (data not 
shown) when our models included positive and negative 
marital quality simultaneously and separately, we report 
only the final models that include both measures of marital 
quality simultaneously.
We estimate a sequence of models. We start by examin-
ing the general relationship between marital quality and 
diabetes risk and management controlling for sociodemo-
graphic covariates only. Next, we add measures of health 
behaviors and psychological distress separately. This 
allows us to test the idea that health behaviors and psy-
chological distress may mediate the relationship between 
marital quality and diabetes. Since preliminary results 
(available upon request) showed no evidence of mediation, 
we report only the final full model, in which all covari-
ates are controlled—including sociodemographic, health 
behavior-related covariates, and psychological distress. 
We note that our ability to test those potential mediation 
mechanisms is limited as our measures of health behaviors 
are not extensive and we do not have direct measures of 
social control. We stratify all analyses by gender and use 
t tests to assess the statistical significance of the gender 
differences. Results from t tests (data not shown) suggest 
that gender differences in all key findings are statistically 
significant.
Correction for Sample Selection Bias
We restrict our analyses to respondents who were married 
at both waves, so the samples select those with relatively 
good marital quality; marriages of poor quality are more 
likely to have ended. Moreover, sample attrition between 
waves—due to mortality, poor health, refusal, or inability 
1074 
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 6
 to locate the respondent—is not random. Therefore, we 
apply Heckman’s (1979) approach to adjust sample selec-
tion biases due to marriage and mortality selections (see 
Liu, 2012 and Liu and Waite, 2014, for similar applica-
tions). This approach entails using logistic regression to 
model the probability that a respondent would die between 
Waves 1 and 2 and the probability that a respondent would 
be married at both waves, conditional on a set of predictors 
measured at Wave 1. Then for individuals who did not die 
and who were married at both waves, we modeled diabetes 
as a function of a set of independent variables, including 
the estimated probabilities of dying and of being married 
at both waves. By using this Heckman-type correction, we 
have adjusted our estimates of diabetes risk and manage-
ment for factors that may affect that risk as well as for the 
tendency to die and the tendency to remain married.
Results
Table 2 shows the weighted descriptive statistics of all 
analyzed variables for the subsamples of diabetes risks 
(N = 1,228) and diabetes management (N = 389). From 
Table 2, we can see that 18.55% of respondents were dia-
betic at Wave 1 and that this proportion rises rapidly to 
29.57% at Wave 2. There are only modest changes in mari-
tal quality over time.
Table 3 shows estimated regression coefficients from 
binary logistic regression models for diabetes risk pre-
dicted by marital quality for the total sample and by gen-
der. To facilitate interpretation, we use exponentiation to 
derive the odds ratios. Results from Table 3 suggest that 
after Wave 1 diabetes status and all other covariates are 
controlled, increases in both positive and negative marital 
quality between Wave 1 and Wave 2 are significantly asso-
ciated with lower odds of having diabetes at Wave 2 for the 
total sample. Yet the results of our gender analysis (Table 3, 
also presented in Figures 1 and 2) reveal that the relation-
ship between positive marital quality and diabetes risk is 
only present for women, while the relationship between 
negative marital quality and diabetes risk is only pre-
sent for men. Specifically, when we hold constant Wave 1 
diabetes status and all other covariates, for women (shown 
in Figure 1), every one unit increase of positive marital 
quality between Waves 1 and 2 decreases the odds of being 
diabetic at Wave 2 by 45% (i.e., 1 − exp (−0.59)), whereas, 
surprisingly, for men (shown in Figure 2), every one unit of 
increase in negative marital quality between Waves 1 and 
2 decreases the odds of being diabetic at Wave 2 by 32% 
(i.e., 1 − exp(−0.39)).
Table 4 shows the results for diabetes management. The 
relative risk ratios can be derived by using exponentiation 
of the reported coefficients. These results suggest that after 
Wave 1 diabetes management and all other covariates are 
controlled, an increase in negative marital quality between 
Waves 1 and 2 is significantly associated with lower risks 
of uncontrolled diabetes at Wave 2, but only for men. 
Specifically, when we hold constant Wave 1 diabetes man-
agement status and all other covariates, every one unit of 
increase in negative marital quality between Waves 1 and 2 
decreases the relative risk of uncontrolled diabetes at Wave 
2 by about 58% (i.e., 1 − exp(−0.86)) for men. This result 
for men is illustrated in Figure 3.
Discussion and Conclusion
Although family and health scholars have long argued that 
marriage may promote health (Waite & Gallagher, 2000), 
this protective effect is highly contingent upon the quality of 
marriage (Liu & Waite, 2014; Umberson et al., 2006). This 
study highlights the importance of marital quality for the 
development and management of diabetes in later life. We 
provide nationally representative, population-based, longi-
tudinal evidence of this relationship, and we give particular 
attention to gender variation. Based on previous clinical 
evidence, we hypothesized that those with higher levels of 
negative marital quality would subsequently experience 
both greater diabetes risk and worse diabetes management 
than those with lower levels of negative marital quality, and 
those with higher levels of positive marital quality would 
subsequently experience lower diabetes risk and better dia-
betes management than those with lower levels of positive 
marital quality (Hypotheses 1 and 2). Our results provide

 mixed evidence for these hypotheses depending to a large 
extent on gender (Hypothesis 3).
For women, we find that an increase in positive mari-
tal quality may reduce the risk of subsequent diabetes over 
time. This finding contrasts with a recent national study’s 
finding that more positive marital exchanges are related to 
decreased diabetes prevalence for men but not for women 
(Whisman et al., 2014). That study analyzed a cross-
sectional sample, whereas our study used a longitudinal 
design. Moreover, our finding accords with previous clini-
cal evidence suggesting that marital quality affects women’s 
health more than men’s (Kiecolt-Glaser & Newton, 2001). 
Women may be more sensitive than men to the quality of 
a relationship and thus more likely to experience a health 
boost from a good-quality relationship (Liu, Waite, Shen, 
& Wang, in press). Scholars often contend that poor mari-
tal quality and marital loss are especially detrimental to 
women’s health (Liu & Waite, 2014; Zhang & Hayward, 
2006). Our results show the positive side, suggesting that 
good marital quality may promote women’s metabolic 
health. Future studies should examine the specific social, 
psychological, behavioral, and biological mechanisms 
through which positive marital quality promotes women’s 
metabolic health.
Our most surprising finding is that, for men, an 
increase in negative marital quality may decrease the risk 
of developing diabetes and increase the chances of man-
aging diabetes after its onset. It is likely that those men 
who experienced an increase in negative marital quality 
are more likely to be self-regulated or self-centered than 
other men that may promote their health—suggesting a 
selection process. Another possibility is that our measure 
of negative marital quality does not reflect intense con-
flict in the relationship but is based on reports that the 
spouse often “criticizes” or “makes too many demands.” 
These may reflect the wife’s efforts to regulate the hus-
band’s health behaviors that would explain this finding. 
Indeed, we note that this gender finding is consistent 
with the long-standing literature on gender differences in

 social control of health behaviors. A social control per-
spective suggests that spouses control each other’s health 
habits, and such social control attempts are more com-
mon among women than men (Tucker & Anders, 2001; 
Umberson, 1992). Wives are more likely than husbands 
to regulate a spouse’s health behaviors, perhaps especially 
if the husband is diabetic and/or in poor health. Both the 
development and treatment of diabetes are highly affected 
by lifestyle. Diabetes requires day-to-day (and even more 
frequent) monitoring that the wives could nudge the hus-
band to do. Such efforts may improve the spouse’s health 
outcomes but at the same time can be very annoying and 
can provoke behavioral resistance, hostility, and emo-
tional distress for the spouse—suggesting a “dual effects” 
process of spouse control (Tucker & Anders, 2001). This 
“dual effects” process may increase the conflict and mari-
tal strain over time between spouses but at the same time 
decrease the chance of developing diabetes and promote 
the husband’s success in controlling his diabetes. Indeed, 
our finding is in line with a couple of recent studies that 
also find marital strain may be protective for certain 
health outcomes (e.g., cognitive decline; Xu, Thomas, & 
Umberson, 2016), whereas marital support may not be, 
especially for men (Carr et al., 2016).
Moreover, although the spouse’s control of health 
behavior has long been posited to promote the partner’s 
health (Tucker & Anders, 2001; Umberson, 1992), recent 
empirical studies find that spouses’ pressure is actually 
associated with increases in patients’ diabetes-specific dis-
tress and decreases in dietary adherence and thus poor 
health outcomes (Stephens et al., 2013). Some scholars 
argue that the consequences of social control on the target 
of the control attempts depends on individual life context 
that determines the target’s affective responses to the social 
control attempts: people experiencing a more positive 
affective response to the spouse’s control are more likely 
to engage in desired behaviors (Tucker & Anders, 2001). 
Although we cannot directly test this hypothesis, our addi-
tional analyses (data not shown) that includes the interac-
tion of positive and negative marital quality suggest that an 
increase in negative marital quality decreases diabetes risk 
over time only when the levels of positive marital quality 
are high. Future research should consider different life con-
texts of negative marital quality for men as well as specific 
mechanisms through which such contexts affect people’s 
response to their spouse’s control attempt and thus may 
lead to different health outcomes.
This study is limited in several ways. First, it is based on 
two waves of longitudinal data. Although we attempt to 
tease out some selectivity issues and causal relationships, 
we are limited by sample size, especially for diabetes man-
agement when looking at men and women separately. We 
work from the social control and the stress perspectives 
to consider how marital quality may affect later diabetes 
development and management, but it is also likely that 
diabetes status affects later change of marital quality—sug-
gesting a potential reversal causality. To better understand 
these selection and causation processes, future studies 
should employ longitudinal data with larger sample sizes 
and more follow-up waves. The NSHAP is currently col-
lecting its third wave of data that will provide opportuni-
ties to further untangle causality. Second, our samples are 
restricted to respondents who survived and were married 
in both waves. Therefore, our conclusions may only apply

 to a selected population of older adults; our conclusions 
are more relevant to older adults who are not in very poor 
health, are less likely to die, and are more likely to stay 
married. This study is, however, based on a random sample 
from that segment of the population. Moreover, we are not 
able to distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes due to data 
limitations, but the development of these two types of dia-
betes may be different in response to marital quality. Since 
95% of adult diabetes are Type 2 (CDC, 2014), our results 
apply primarily to this group. Finally, various social, bio-
logical, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms under-
lie the link between marital quality and diabetes. Future 
studies should seek to identify the precise mechanisms and 
processes through which marital quality and diabetes affect 
each other and address how those mechanisms and pro-
cesses vary by gender.
Despite its limitations, our study makes significant con-
tributions to the literature on marital quality and health. 
We use a nationally representative, longitudinal data set 
to build on clinical evidence of the importance of marital 
quality for metabolic health. More importantly, our results 
add to the mixed evidence on gender differences in the links 
between marital quality and health in later life. Although 
growing evidence suggests that women’s health is especially 
vulnerable to poor marital quality and marital loss (Liu 
& Waite, 2014), our results reveal an optimistic finding: 
positive marital quality benefits women’s metabolic health 
in later life. Since diabetes is the fastest growing chronic 
condition in the United States, implementation of public 
policies and programs designed to promote marital qual-
ity should also reduce the risk of diabetes and promote 
health and longevity, especially for women at old ages. 
Surprisingly, we find that, for older men, negative marital 
quality may slow the development of diabetes and promote 
successful treatment after its onset. These results challenge 
the traditional assumption that negative marital quality is 
always detrimental to health and encourage family scholars 
to further distinguish different sources and types of nega-
tive marital quality.
