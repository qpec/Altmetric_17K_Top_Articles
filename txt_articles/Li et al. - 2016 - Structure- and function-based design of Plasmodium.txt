Abstract
The proteasome is a multi-component protease complex responsible for regulating key processes 
such as the cell cycle and antigen presentation1. Compounds that target the proteasome are 
potentially valuable tools for the treatment of pathogens that depend on proteasome function for 
survival and replication. In particular, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to be toxic for the 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum at all stages of its life cycle2-5. Most compounds that 
have been tested against the parasite also inhibit the mammalian proteasome resulting in toxicity 
that precludes their use as therapeutic agents2,6. Therefore, better definition of the substrate 
specificity and structural properties of the Plasmodium proteasome could enable the development 
of compounds with sufficient selectivity to allow their use as anti-malarial agents. To accomplish 
this goal, we used a substrate profiling method to uncover differences in the specificities of the 
human and P. falciparum proteasome. We designed inhibitors based on amino acid preferences

 specific to the parasite proteasome, and found that they preferentially inhibit the β 2 subunit. We 
determined the structure of the P. falciparum 20S proteasome bound to the inhibitor using cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis, to a resolution of 3.6 Å. These data 
reveal the unusually open P. falciparum β2 active site and provide valuable information regarding 
active site architecture that can be used to further refine inhibitor design. Furthermore, consistent 
with the recent finding that the proteasome is important for stress pathways associated with 
resistance of artemisinin (ART) family anti-malarials7,8, we observed growth inhibition synergism 
with low doses of this β 2 selective inhibitor in ART sensitive and resistant parasites. Finally, we 
demonstrated that a parasite selective inhibitor could be used to attenuate parasite growth in vivo 
without significant toxicity to the host. Thus, the Plasmodium proteasome is a chemically tractable 
target that could be exploited by next generation anti-malarial agents.
The Plasmodium proteasome represents a viable target for anti-malarial drugs due to its 
essential nature in protein turnover and the parasite's need to rapidly divide inside host 
cells9. We have previously shown that differences exist in the reliance of human cells and P. 
falciparum on specific proteasome activities for survival10. Therefore, we reasoned that a 
structural and biochemical understanding of this enzyme complex could yield compounds 
with desirable safety profiles due to their selectivity for the parasite proteasome. We purified 
the P. falciparum 20S proteasome11, activated it with human PA28α12,13 (Extended Data 
Fig. 1a) and determined the substrate preferences of this activated proteasome by monitoring 
the degradation pattern of 228 diverse synthetic tetradecapeptides using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry14,15. A frequency profile was generated using 
iceLogo software16, indicating which amino acids are most and least favored in the subsites 
surrounding each cleaved bond. In parallel, we generated a substrate specificity profile for 
the human 20S/PA28α proteasome under identical conditions. We detected 284 and 328 
cleavage sites for the activated P. falciparum and human 20S proteasomes, respectively, 
with 171 sites being cleaved by both (Fig. 1a). However, 113 and 157 sites were uniquely 
cleaved by P. falciparum and human proteasomes, respectively (Fig. 1a-c and Extended 
Data Fig. 1b, c), with the major differences occurring on the amino-terminal side of the 
cleavage site, namely at the P1 and P3 sites. For the P1 position which is directly adjacent to 
the cleavage site, the human proteasome showed chymotrypsin-like (Leu/Phe/Tyr), trypsin-
like (Arg) and caspase-like (Asp) activity (Fig. 1b), consistent with previous studies17, while 
the P. falciparum proteasome showed strong preference for aromatic residues (Fig. 1c). 
Direct comparison of the specificity profiles of both proteasomes revealed a clear preference 
for Trp at P1 and P3 in the parasite proteasome (Fig 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1b and c).
Using the canonical tri-leucine scaffold found in common proteasome inhibitors such as 
MG132 and Z-L3-VS18,19, we systematically replaced the Leu residues at the P1 and P3 
positions with Trp, resulting in the compounds LLW-vs, WLL-vs and WLW-vs (Fig. 1e and 
Extended Data Fig. 2a). We treated purified P. falciparum 20S proteasomes with each 
compound and measured residual activity of the catalytic sites using an activity based 
probe10 (Fig. 1f). Changing the P1 position to Trp (LLW-vs) dramatically reduced inhibition 
of the β5 active site, without altering the activity towards the β2 subunit, while Trp in the P3 
position (WLL-vs) resulted in potent inhibition of both β2 and β5 activities. Finally, Trp 
substitution in both P1 and P3 positions (WLW-vs) results in a potent inhibitor that was

 highly selective for the parasite β2 proteasome subunit. With the exception of LLW-vs, 
these compounds inhibited the human β5 subunit while all compounds only weakly inhibited 
the human β1 and β2 activities (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 1d & 2b). Therefore, these 
inhibitors primarily differ in their selectivity towards the β2 subunits and this selectivity was 
retained in human and P. falciparum inhibitor treatments in live culture (Extended Data Fig. 
2c).
We investigated the structural basis for the β2 selectivity of the P. falciparum 20S 
proteasome towards WLW-vs by high resolution cryo-EM and single particle analysis, using 
a strategy similar to that which we previously used to determine the structure of an inhibitor 
bound human 20S proteasome20. The resolution of the final map was estimated at 3.6 Å 
(Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3a-e), with local resolution decreasing for solvent exposed 
surfaces (Fig 2a, b). In our map, sheet-forming β strands are well resolved (Fig. 2d) and side 
chains are well defined for both β strands and α helices (Fig 2e,f), particularly when 
stabilized by intra-protein contacts or steric restraints. We were able to unambiguously 
assign a clear density extending from the β2 subunit N-terminal threonine to the WLW-vs 
inhibitor, with the vinyl sulfone group and the WLW side chains clearly resolved in a β 
strand secondary structural conformation (Fig. 2g).
When the protein coordinates for the P. falciparum β1 and β5 subunits are aligned to those 
of the ligand bound β2 subunit, the resulting superimposition of the WLW-vs ligand into the 
β1 and the β5 active sites clearly reveals space constrains for its binding. While the more 
open conformation of the β2 binding pocket easily accommodates the WLW-vs side chains 
(Fig. 3a), the ligand overlay into the β1 and the β5 active sites results in the burying of its 
Trp side chains into the protein van der Waals surface (Fig. 3b,c), with the exception of the 
P3 position in the β5 active site (Fig. 3c). We extended this comparison to the protein 
coordinates of the human 20S proteasome active sites, using the coordinates of the human 
apo complex21 (pdb 4R3O). Superimposing the WLW-vs inhibitor onto the human apo 
proteasome core (Fig. 3d-f) shows its active sites have no accessibility for the P1 and P3 Trp 
side chains of the inhibitor, with the exception of the P3 position at the β5 active site (Fig. 
3f). Similar observations can be made when using the protein model of the human 
proteasome core bound to the inhibitor AdaAhx3-LLL-vs (pdb 5A0Q) (Extended Data Fig. 
3f-h). This structural comparison of the accessibility of P. falciparum and human 
proteasome active sites is consistent and explains the observed specificity of the WLW-vs 
inhibitor towards the P. falciparum β2 subunit, which would be difficult to predict without 
direct high resolution structural information. The results presented here show an important 
and novel application of high resolution cryo-EM to interpret the basis for the specific 
binding of a ligand to an active site, where the information obtained can be harnessed to 
guide further ligand development for therapeutic usage.
P. falciparum parasites can become resistant to killing by the frontline ART drug 
family22-24, however these ART treated parasites are particularly sensitive to disruption of 
normal proteasome function25. We previously showed that inhibition of the β5 proteasome 
subunit is required for attenuation of P. falciparum growth10. However, we reasoned that a 
sub-lethal dose of the Plasmodium β2 selective inhibitor WLW-vs may still be sufficient to 
enhance killing by ART in both sensitive and resistant parasites. When laboratory-adapted

 clinical isolates were treated at the early ring stage of the intraerythrocytic cycle, ART 
resistant parasites (PL7) showed close to 2-fold higher sensitivity to WLW-vs than ART 
sensitive parasites (PL2) (Fig. 4a). In addition, we observed synergism between 
dihydroarteminisin (DHA) and WLW-vs at concentrations where WLW-vs selectively 
inhibits the β2 subunit of the Plasmodium proteasome (Fig. 4b; Extended Data Fig. 4a). As 
parasites are normally insensitive to a pulse inhibition of the proteasome β2 active site 
alone10, this underlines the heightened sensitivity of P. falciparum to proteasome inhibition 
in the presence of DHA.
We have previously shown that co-inhibition of the Plasmodium proteasome β2 and β5 
subunits results in complete parasite growth attenuation at all stages of its blood cycle, even 
after short inhibitor treatment times10. WLL-vs is a potent inhibitor of the parasite β2 and β5 
active sites, while only effective against the human β5 activity (Fig. 1g, Fig. 3 and Extended 
Data Fig. 1d-e). WLL-vs is therefore likely to have potent anti-malarial activity with 
minimal toxicity to the host, since a short inhibition of host β5 activity is well tolerated in 
most mammalian cells26. We treated live P. falciparum cultures and primary human 
fibroblasts for 1 hr with WLL-vs, and were surprised to find that WLL-vs inhibited all 3 
proteasome catalytic sites in P. falciparum, while having little effect on any of the human 
subunits until high micromolar concentrations (Fig. 4c). This increased potency is likely due 
to inhibitor accumulation in the intact parasites and enhanced inhibition of the parasite 26S 
proteasome (20S with regulatory subunit 19S proteasome complex)27. This translated into a 
large therapeutic window for the WLL-vs inhibitor in 1 hr and 72 hr viability assays (Fig. 4d 
and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Although the P. falciparum proteasome inhibition corresponds 
well to the decrease in parasite survival (Fig. 4d), we sought to determine if off-target 
toxicity was occurring. First, a diastereomer of WLL-vs containing a P1 (D)-Leu (WL(d)L-
vs) showed a dramatic reduction in compound potency (Extended Data Fig. 5a-c) indicating 
that these compounds were not indiscriminately cytotoxic. Second, vinyl-sulfones can react 
with cysteine proteases28 and, therefore, we assessed reactivity of WLL-vs towards P. 
falciparum cysteine proteases using the activity based probe BODIPY-TMR-DCG0429. We 
observed inhibition of cysteine proteases with WLL-vs only at concentrations that are >10-
fold over the 1 hr EC50 (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Third, we assessed parasite morphology 24 
hours after a 1 hr WLL-vs pulse treatment and observed arrested parasite development and 
eventual parasite death at high inhibitor concentrations (Extended Data Figure 5e). The 
absence of a food vacuole defect indicated that the falcipains in this digestive organelle were 
not significantly inhibited. Taken together, these data confirm that WLL-vs exerts its anti-
malarial effects through direct proteasome inhibition.
Given the large therapeutic window of WLL-vs, we assessed its efficacy in a rodent 
Plasmodium chabaudi infection model. We infected Balb/c female mice with 1 million 
parasites and treated 3 days later using a single bolus dose of 35 mg/kg WLL-vs or vehicle, 
via tail vein injection. We observed almost complete reduction of parasite burden following 
WLL-vs treatment (Fig. 4e) and good tolerance to the drug as assessed by appearance, 
activity and weight retention (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The efficacy of this treatment was 
further confirmed in an intra-peritoneal single bolus dosing study of P. chabaudi infected 
mice (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

 In summary, we have shown through biochemical and structural studies that the Plasmodium 
proteasome is sufficiently unique from the human proteasome for selective targeting. 
Furthermore we show that even sub-lethal doses of proteasome inhibitor can lead to parasite 
sensitization to ART. Our lead molecule, WLL-vs, is a mechanism-based peptidic inhibitor 
that is chemically similar to the FDA approved drug Kyprolis. We recognize that the unique 
disease epidemiology of malaria calls for stringent criteria in drug safety, stability and 
delivery and we are currently optimizing WLL-vs to generate a class of compounds with 
improved potency and oral bioavailability. Previous success in optimizing peptide-based 
agents30 for efficient oral delivery offers promise in this class of inhibitors as next 
generation anti-malarials.
Methods
Materials for substrate profiling
Proteasome substrates Suc-LLVY-amc and human 20S proteasome were purchased from 
Boston Biochem. The Plasmodium falciparum 20S proteasome was purified as previously 
reported11. The human PA28α is a generous gift from Boston Biochem. Peptide library for 
substrate cleavage profiling is used as described in (15).
Fluorogenic substrate assay
Substrate assays were performed in black 96-well COSTAR plates. For these assays purified 
human or P. falciparum 20S proteasomes were activated using human PA28α13. Each 
enzyme was added to a final concentration of 1 nM and the reaction proceeded in the 
presence of 12.5 μM Suc-LLVY-amc for 1 hr at room temperature. The slope over the linear 
range of the reaction was determined for each of the enzymes. All experiments were 
performed at least in triplicates.
Multiplex substrate profiling of human and Plasmodium proteasomes
The peptide library consisting of 228 tetradecapeptides was designed according to an 
algorithm previously reported15. Peptides were split into 2 pools of 114 for optimal LC 
separation. P. falciparum and human 20S proteasomes were assayed at 2 nM, in the 
presence of 24 nM of PA28α and 500 nM of each peptide. All assays were performed at 
room temperature in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 0.5 mM EDTA. Aliquots were removed 
and acid quenched to pH 3.0 or less with formic acid (4% final) after 15, 60 and 240 minutes 
incubation. A control sample lacking enzyme was also prepared under identical conditions 
to account for non-enzymatic degradation of the substrates. Each sample was desalted with 
C18 tips (Rainin) and ~130 ng of total peptide was injected for mass spectrometry analysis. 
Peptide separation was performed using an EZ-Spray C18 column (Thermo, ES800, 
PepMap, 3 μm bead size, 75 μm × 15 cm). Reverse phase chromatography was performed at 
a flow rate of 600 nL/min for loading and 300 nL/min for using a nanoACUITY (Waters) 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) instrument. A 60 minute linear gradient 
from 2% to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was used and mass spectrometry was 
performed on a LTQ Orbitrap XL. Survey scans were recorded over a 350-1500 m/z range, 
and peptide fragmentation was induced with collision-induced dissociation (CID) for 
MS/MS. CID fragmentation was performed on the six most intense precursor ions, with a

 minimum of 1,000 counts, using an isolation width of 2.0 amu, with 35% normalized 
collision energy. Data were analyzed as previously reported using the in-house PAVA 
software to generate centroid peak lists, Protein Prospector software v. 5.10.15 for data 
searches and iceLogo software for visualization of amino acid frequency surrounding the 
cleavage sites15. The Z-score is calculated using the standard formula and indicates 
deviation from the mean frequency of s specific amino acid on a specific position in a 
reference set of sequences.
P. falciparum replication assays
P. falciparum D10 cultures were maintained, synchronized and lysed as previously 
described11. P. falciparum D10 was obtained originally from Malaria Research and 
Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4). Parasite cultures were grown in human 
erythrocytes (no blood type discrimination) purchased from the Stanford Blood Center 
(approved by Stanford University). Ring stage P. falciparum culture at 2% parasitemia and 
0.5 % hematocrit was added to 96-well plates spotted with compounds. The P. falciparum 
culture was incubated with each compound for 1 hr and 72 hr. After 1 hr compound 
treatment, the inhibitor was removed and the culture was washed 3 times in media, before 
fresh media was added for a further 71 hr of growth. After incubation the culture was fixed 
in a final concentration of 1% para-formaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. 
The nuclei stain YOYO-1 was then added to a final concentration of 50 nM and incubated 
overnight at 4°C. Parasite replication was monitored by observation of a YOYO-1 positive 
population (infected) and YOYO-1 negative population (uninfected) using a BD Accuri™ 
C6 automated flow cytometer. Values in Extended Data Fig. 1e are the average ± standard 
deviation. n=6 parasite cultures from 2 independent experiment of triplicates.
Cell viability assay in mammalian cells
Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) used in all experiments are non-transformed primary cells 
(obtained from John Boothroyd, Stanford University) derived from human foreskin tissues 
and tested for mycoplasma contamination. HFF were plated at 2500 cells (non-confluent) 
per well <24 hr before addition of the compound. Compounds were diluted for dose 
response concentrations in media, and added to the cells for 72 hr. Cell viability was 
measured using the CellTiter-Blue® Assay (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 
Values in Extended Data Fig. 1e are the average ± standard deviation. n=9 cell cultures from 
3 independent experiments of triplicates for HFF treatment, except for 1hr WLW-vs, 1hr 
LLW-vs and 72 hr LLL-vs, where n=6 cell cultures from 2 independent experiment of 
triplicates.
Activity-based probe labeling of mammalian and P. falciparum proteasome
BMV037 was used at a final concentration of 10 μM to label P. falciparum proteasome 
activity and MV151 was used at a final concentration of 2 μM to label mammalian 
proteasome activity. Purified proteasomes (human or P. falciparum, 10 nM) were incubated 
with each inhibitor for 1 hr at 37°C before addition of BMV037 or MV151 for a further 2 hr 
at 37°C. Samples were denatured by addition of SDS sample buffer, boiled briefly and ran 
on a 12% SDS PAGE. Gels were scanned on the Cy5 channel (for BMV037) or the Cy3

 channel (for MV151) on a Typhoon Scanner (GE Healthcare). Quantification of the intensity 
of the labeled proteins was done using Image J. A small amount of activation in the β1 
subunit was observed in the human proteasome after inhibitor treatment.
Assessment of P. falciparum proteasome activity in intact inhibitor treated parasites
P. falciparum was cultured to around 10% parasitemia to ensure sufficient parasite is 
available for proteasome labeling. P. falciparum culture was first treated for the indicated 
amount of time, and spun down at 3200 rpm to remove inhibitor. Each culture was then 
washed once in fresh media and P. falciparum lysate obtained as previously described11. 
Proteasome labeling of the parasite lysate was performed as described above. To assess 
proteasome inhibition, the intensity of the proteasome labeling was quantified by Image J 
and the amount of proteasome inhibition was taken as a percentage of the DMSO treated 
control.
Assessment of WLL-vs activity and DHA synergism against ART sensitive and resistant P. 
falciparum
Sensitivity of PL2 and PL7 P. falciparum strains (at 2 hr post-invasion) to a 1-hr pulsed 
treatment with WLW-vs was determined as described previously25. Interactions between 
DHA and WLW-vs against the K13 mutant strain, PL7, exposed to a 3-hr pulsed treatment 
was determined at 4 hr post-invasion as described previously25.
In vivo assessment of WLL-vs
All mouse experiments were approved by the Stanford Administration Panel on Laboratory 
Animal Care and strictly followed their specific guidelines. Sample size was determined 
based on the minimum number of animals required for good data distribution and statistics. 
We ensured all animals in vehicle and compound treated group had similar body weight 
before treatment. No inclusion or exclusion criteria were used as animals were randomly 
chosen for each group. No blinding was performed between the groups. For each drug assay, 
Balb/c female mice (~20 g, 6-8 weeks old) were infected by intraperitoneal (I.P) injection 
with 1×106 P. chabaudi parasites isolated from an infected mouse on Day 0. For the 
experiment presented in Fig. 4, the infected mice were dosed 3 days post infection with a 
single bolus tail vein injection of either vehicle (n=6) comprising of 10% DMSO, 10% (2-
Hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin in sterile PBS or WLL-vs (n=6) formulated in the vehicle. 
For experiment presented in Extended Data Fig. 4c, the infected mice were dosed 2 days 
post infection with a single bolus intra-peritoneal injection of either vehicle (45% 
polyethylene glycol (M.W. 400), 35% propylene glycol, 10% ethanol, 10% DMSO and 10% 
w/v 2-hydroxyproyl-β-cyclodextrin) or WLL-vs at 40 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg 
formulated in the vehicle. Both of the treatments were administered at night (9 pm). 
Parasitemia was monitored daily by thin blood smears obtained from the tail vein and 
quantified by light microscope counting, where a minimum of 5 fields, each containing at 
least 400 red blood cells, were counted. The health of the mice was also monitored daily by 
measuring their body weight and by assessment of their appearance and activity.

 Assessment of P. falciparum cysteine protease activities
A mixed stage culture of red blood cells infected with P. falciparum D10 was treated with a 
range of concentrations of WLL-vs for 1 hr at 37°C. 2 μM of BODIPY-TMRDCG04 was 
then added to the culture for a further 1 hr for live cell labeling of the activities of the 
parasitic cysteine proteases. 100 μM of JPM-OEt27 was added as a positive control. After 
probe labeling, the parasite pellet was isolated by saponin lysis and kept at −80°C. For 
further analysis, the samples were thawed at 4°C and lysed directly in sample buffer and 
loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence of the probe was detected using the Typhoon 
as described above.
Giemsa stain of WLL-vs treated P. falciparum culture
P. falciparum culture at mid-ring (9-12 hr post-invasion) was treated with DMSO or WLL-
vs for 1 hr at 37°C and the inhibitor was removed. The culture was washed in media and left 
to grow in fresh media for a further 23 hrs. Culture was then spun down and the red blood 
cell pellet used to make a thin blood smear on glass slides, fixed with methanol and stained 
with Giemsa stain for light microscopy.
Chemical synthesis
The detailed procedures for chemical synthesis are presented in Supplementary Information.
Cryo-EM data acquisition
A sample of P. falciparum 20S proteasome core was diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 
mM MgCl2 and 1 mM dithiotreitol, to a concentration of 0.14 μM (0.1 mg ml−1), and 
incubated in the presence of 10 μM WLW-vs for 1 hour at 37°C. The sample was applied 
onto Quantifoil 1.2/1.3 electron microscope grids that were coated with a thin layer of 
carbon, freshly floated from mica, and glow-discharged in air. The grids were flash frozen 
by plunging into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI), operated at 22°C and 95% humidity, 
with a 2.5 s blot time. The grids were transferred into a FEI Titan Krios microscope, 
operated at an acceleration voltage of 300 keV and a nominal magnification of ×75,000 
(yielding a calibrated sampling of 1.04 Å pixel−1 at the image level). Images were recorded 
(from a single cryo-EM grid and during a single cryo-EM session) on a Falcon II direct 
electron detector, using EPU software, at a range of 1.70-3.16 μm underfocus and 1s 
exposure time (Extended Data Fig. 3a). For each exposure 17 individual frames were 
captured at a rate of 0.056 s frame−1, each corresponding to an electron dose of 2.8 e− Å−2. 
For each exposure the image corresponding to the sum of all frames was used for screening 
for optimal ice thickness and image stability, as assessed by the isotropic recovery of Thon 
rings in their power spectra. From the 2603 images recorded, 1816 were selected for further 
processing.
Image processing
We used the same strategy for image analysis as for the recent determination of the structure 
of an inhibitor bound human 20S proteasome core20. For each exposure selected for image 
analysis, the sum of all frames captured was used to determine the defocus and astigmatism 
parameters, using the Tigris program findctf, and for particle selection, performed

 automatically in Relion31. This automated particle selection was carefully supervised with 
the manual removal of false positives and addition of false negatives. Further processing 
was performed using the sum of frames 3-10 of each exposure, effectively acquired within 
0.45 seconds and corresponding to a total accumulated electron dose of 28 e− Å−2. This 
frame selection aimed at an adequate signal-to-noise, for accurate determination of particle 
orientation, and the preservation of high resolution information, as previously discussed20. 
The phases of the resulting images were corrected for the contrast transfer function by phase 
flipping with the Tigris program flipctf, using the image defocus and astigmatism 
parameters determined as described above. Selected particle images were then extracted into 
256×256 pixel boxes, resulting in a data-set of 97,720 particles. The single particle analysis 
refinement routine was performed using C2 symmetry and used the cryo-EM structure of the 
human 20S proteasome core (Electron Microscopy Data Bank accession code EMD-2981) 
as starting reference. This routine consisted of rounds of alignment and Euler angle 
assignment by projection matching, using the program AP SH of the Spider software 
package32, 3D reconstruction, using icr3d (which includes correction for the amplitude 
component of the contrast transfer function), and forward projection, using icr3dpro. The 
icr3d and icr3dpro programs are implemented in Tigris, a software package publicly 
available at sourceforge.net. A resolution limited approach was used in order to avoid noise 
over-fitting during refinement, where the 3D map obtained in each refinement cycle was 
carefully inspected, masked and Fourier low-pass filtered to a conservative threshold in 
preparation of the reference for the next cycle. The surface representations of the final map 
as determined by the icr3d software (Fig. 2a,b), without further sharpening, Fourier filtering 
or masking, were created using UCSF Chimera33 and color coded according to local 
resolution as determined by ResMap34.
Molecular modeling
Molecular models for each of the P. falciparum proteasome 20S core subunits were 
originally obtained using the Phyre2 Protein Homology Recognition Engine35, using the 
sequences deposited in the PlasmoDB (Plasmodium Genomics Resource). A preliminary 
fitting of these models was performed using Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting 
(MDFF)36, which was followed by real space refinement in Coot37 and Phenix38. Protein 
regions that were not well recovered in our map were not modelled. The final model was 
checked for geometry, close contacts and bond parameters using MolProbity39. The 
statistics obtained (Extended Data Fig. 3c) compare favorably with those for models 
determined by X-ray crystallography at similar resolutions, indicating that there was no 
over-fitting during model building. The resolution of the cryo-EM map can therefore be 
assessed by Fourier shell correlation against a density map generated from these coordinates, 
yielding a value of about 3.6 Å (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The mesh representations of the 
final map showing the fitted coordinates of the P. falciparum 20S proteasome core (Fig. 2c-
g) were created using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. For these representations the 
map was sharpened with a B-factor of -50 and Fourier low-pass filtered to 3.6 Å.

Proteasome inhibitors preferentially inhibit β2 of the P. falciparum proteasome. a, Vinyl 
sulfone inhibitors are synthesized from the Boc-protected amino acid by first generating the 
Weinreb amide, followed by the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction and standard peptide 
coupling. b, Purified human 20S proteasome was pre-treated for 1 hr at 37°C with each 
inhibitor followed by addition of activity based probe MV1511 to assess for human 
proteasome activities (for gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1b). c, Human foreskin 
fibroblasts (HFF) or P. falciparum culture was treated for 1 hr at 37°C with each inhibitor, 
followed by compound washout and post-lysis activity based probe labeling. Gel shown for 
WLL-vs in P.falciparum is derived from Fig 4c at the indicated concentrations to allow for 
direct comparison with other compounds (for gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1e).

(a-e) Evaluation of the single particle analysis of the P. falciparum 20S proteasome core 
bound to the inhibitor WLW-vs. a, cryo-EM image of the sample analyzed, with molecular 
images of side views of the complex (normal to its long axis) indicated by rings. The image 
greyscale was inverted in order to show the protein densities in white. b, Individual sections 
of the 3D map, as determined by the 3D reconstruction algorithm (without further 
sharpening, masking or Fourier filtering), are represented as grey scale. These sections are 1 
Å thick and reveal the quality of the reconstruction, as the protein densities are clearly 
resolved against a very smooth background, with regions showing the pattern of α-helices 
(box) and the clear separation of sheet forming β strands (arrows) indicated. c, Evaluation of 
the model of the P. falciparum 20S proteasome core using MolProbity2. d, Resolution 
estimate of the cryo-EM map by Fourier shell correlation. The curves correspond to the 
correlation obtained against the protein model (red) and the correlation between maps 
determined from two halves of the data (blue). The resolution was estimated from the curve 
against the model where the 0.5 correlation coefficient criterion3 yields an estimate of 3.6 Å. 
The correlation coefficient can be seen to fall to a local minimum at ~6 Å and then recover 
at higher resolutions for both FSC curves. This behavior is consistent with the rotationally 
averaged amplitude spectra of both the cryo-EM map and the coordinates (e). This region of 
the amplitude spectra contains reduced structural information, typical of protein scattering, 
indicating that these effects in the FSC curves arise from a genuine local reduction in the 
signal:noise ratio. (f-h) Accessibility of the human 20S proteasome active sites to the 
inhibitor WLW-vs, using the protein model of the human proteasome core complex bound
