Introduction: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is often used to identify which hyperkalemic patients are at 
risk for adverse events. However, there is a paucity of evidence to support this practice. This study 
analyzes the association between specific hyperkalemic ECG abnormalities and the development of 
short-term adverse events in patients with severe hyperkalemia.
Methods: We collected records of all adult patients with potassium (K+) ≥6.5 mEq/L in the hospital 
laboratory database from August 15, 2010, through January 30, 2015. A chart review identified patient 
demographics, concurrent laboratory values, ECG within one hour of K+ measurement, treatments and 
occurrence of adverse events within six hours of ECG. We defined adverse events as symptomatic 
bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or 
death. Two emergency physicians blinded to study objective independently examined each ECG for 
rate, rhythm, peaked T wave, PR interval duration and QRS complex duration. Relative risk was 
calculated to determine the association between specific hyperkalemic ECG abnormalities and short-
term adverse events.
Results: We included a total of 188 patients with severe hyperkalemia in the final study group. Adverse 
events occurred within six hours in 28 patients (15%): symptomatic bradycardia (n=22), death (n=4), 
ventricular tachycardia (n=2) and CPR (n=2). All adverse events occurred prior to treatment with calcium 
and all but one occurred prior to K+-lowering intervention. All patients who had a short-term adverse event 
had a preceding ECG that demonstrated at least one hyperkalemic abnormality (100%, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] [85.7-100%]). An increased likelihood of short-term adverse event was found for 
hyperkalemic patients whose ECG demonstrated QRS prolongation (relative risk [RR] 4.74, 95% CI 
[2.01-11.15]), bradycardia (HR<50) (RR 12.29, 95%CI [6.69-22.57]), and/or junctional rhythm (RR 7.46, 
95%CI 5.28-11.13). There was no statistically significant correlation between peaked T waves and 
short-term adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI [0.35-1.70]).
Conclusion: Our findings support the use of the ECG to risk stratify patients with severe 
hyperkalemia for short-term adverse events. [West J Emerg Med. 2017;18(5)963-971.]

Can the Electrocardiogram Risk Stratify for Short-term Adverse Events? 
Durfey et al.
INTRODUCTION
Severe hyperkalemia can lead to lethal cardiac 
dysrhythmias. Hyperkalemia produces cardiotoxicity 
through early depolarization of the cell membrane, slowing 
of ventricular conduction and decreased durations of the 
action potential. 1,2 These changes at the cellular level 
correlate with the electrocardiogram (ECG) manifestations 
of hyperkalemia. Traditional teaching describes the 
sequential appearance of ECG abnormalities seen with 
rising potassium (K+) levels as follows: peaked T waves, 
PR interval prolongation, QRS prolongation, loss of 
P wave, escape rhythms, “sine wave” configuration, 
ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless activity or asystole1,2 
The presence or absence of these ECG manifestations 
of hyperkalemia are frequently used to determine how 
aggressively a hyperkalemic patient is treated.3-5
However, studies have demonstrated that ECGs without 
any findings consistent with hyperkalemia are seen in 50-
64% of patients with K+ ≥ 6.5 mEq/L.6-8 Cases of patients 
with extreme hyperkalemia (10.1-10.3 mEq/L) and normal 
ECGs have also been reported.9,10 Furthermore, dysrhythmia 
and cardiac arrest have been reported in hyperkalemic 
patients without preceding peaked T waves.11 The role of 
the ECG in the management of hyperkalemia has thus been 
increasingly called into question.2,7,11-14 Leading FOAMed 
(free online open-access medical education) educators have 
deemphasized the role of ECG in management decisions, 
warning that patients with relatively normal ECGs may 
still experience sudden hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.12,14 
A recently published guideline for the management of 
severe hyperkalemia called for further research to both 
characterize the actual risk of cardiac instability in 
hyperkalemic patients without ECG abnormalities and to 
identify which hyperkalemic ECG changes are the greatest 
predictors of outcome.15
The practice of using the ECG to determine how 
aggressively to treat hyperkalemia assumes that ECG 
changes reliably occur prior to hyperkalemic dysrhythmia 
or cardiac arrest. While this is a widely held belief, the 
level of evidence needed to support this teaching does 
not currently exist. The objective of this study was to 
determine the association between specific hyperkalemic 
ECG abnormalities and the development of short-term 
adverse events in patients with severe hyperkalemia. This 
study could represent the first step in creating a predictive 
model for the risk stratification of hyperkalemic patients 
based on ECG changes. 
METHODS
Study Design
This was an observational retrospective cohort study. The 
study received institutional review board approval, with a waiver 
of informed consent. 
Population Health Research Capsule
What do we already know about this issue? 
Hyperkalemic ECG abnormalities do not 
consistently occur in hyperkalemic patients. 
Whether the ECG identifies patients at 
higher risk for adverse events is unclear. 
What was the research question? 
What is the association between ECG 
abnormalities and short-term adverse events 
in patients with hyperkalemia?
What was the major finding of the study? 
All short-term adverse events in 
hyperkalemic patients were preceded by 
ECG abnormalities.
How does this improve population health? 
This study suggests that the ECG is a useful 
tool in the risk-stratification of 
hyperkalemic patients.
Study Setting and Population
The study was performed at a suburban community 
hospital that supports an emergency medicine residency 
program. The annual emergency department (ED) census is 
approximately 72,000 patients. Patients are primarily adults 
(90%); approximately 90% are White, 4% are Hispanic, and 
2% are Black.  
A list of medical record numbers for all adult patients (age 
≥ 18 years) with K+ ≥6.5 mEq/L from August 15, 2010, through 
January 30, 2015, was electronically generated from the hospital 
laboratory database. This database contains all laboratory 
data for ED and hospitalized patients, which ensured that all 
hyperkalemia values were captured. 
We developed inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to data 
collection. Cases selected for inclusion were required to have 
a documented serum or plasma K+ of ≥6.5 mEq/L and an ECG 
performed within one hour of the laboratory draw. The K+ ≥6.5 
mEq/L cutoff is considered a threshold for initiating emergency 
therapy, and has been used in prior publications.2,16 The ECG 
could be performed either during the 60 minutes prior to the 
acquisition of the K+ sample, or during the 60 minutes after the 
laboratory draw. When a serum and plasma K+ level were both 
obtained, the plasma level (also known as a heparinized K+) was 
used.  Only one episode of hyperkalemia per patient was included

in the study. We excluded recurrent episodes of hyperkalemia in 
the same patient.
Exclusion criteria included laboratory notation of a 
hemolyzed sample, platelet count ≥ 500 x 109 /L, paced rhythm 
on ECG, and treatment for hyperkalemia prior to obtaining the 
ECG and laboratory sample. Hemolyzed samples were excluded 
because the release of K+ from red blood cells during hemolysis 
can lead to false elevation of the serum potassium. Similarly, 
we excluded patients with platelet count ≥ 500 x 109 /L because 
this degree of thrombocytosis can cause pseudohyperkalemia. 
Treatment for hyperkalemia was defined as the administration 
of any of the following prior to the time the ECG was obtained 
and the laboratory sample was collected: calcium chloride or 
gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, albuterol, insulin, dextrose, 
sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and/or hemodialysis. Patients who 
received prior treatment for hyperkalemia were excluded so that 
the measured K+ level more accurately reflected the K+ value at 
the time of the ECG. We also excluded patients if they received 
atropine, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin 
prior to the time the ECG was obtained. We excluded these 
patients because of the potential of these medications to alter the 
ECG, such as precipitating ventricular tachycardia or masking 
hyperkalemic bradycardia. 
Study Protocol
We abstracted data from the electronic medical record 
(EMR), including ED record, admission history and physical, 
daily progress notes, discharge summary, and electronic 
medication administration record. A standardized, closed-
ended electronic data collection form was used. All reviewers 
(AB, SD, BL, JV) were trained in the data collection rules 
and definitions using sample medical records. All EMRs and 
data collection forms of the final study group (n=188) were 
reviewed for accuracy by a second reviewer (ND). 
The following information was abstracted from each 
record: (1) demographics (age, sex, race); (2) serum and 
plasma K+ levels and time obtained; (3) patient location at 
time of hyperkalemia (ED vs inpatient); (4) ECG and time 
obtained; (5) medications administered prior to obtaining 
ECG (including medications administered by emergency 
medical services in the prehospital setting) and in the 
six hours after the ECG; (6) laboratory values (sodium, 
calcium, glucose, creatinine, CO2, platelets) obtained on 
the same lab draw as the K+ level; (7) whether the patient 
was an established dialysis patient at the time of the episode 
of hyperkalemia; and (8) occurrence of a study-defined 
adverse event in the six hours after the ECG. All charts were 
reviewed by two reviewers for the presence or absence of an 
adverse event (BL, AB, JV). Disagreement was resolved by 
the primary investigator (ND). 
We obtained a copy of the ECG performed within 
one hour of laboratory draw, and prior to treatment. When 
available, we also obtained a copy of the most recent previous 
ECG to serve as a baseline. K+ level was confirmed to be <5.0 
mEq/L at time of previous ECG. 
We created a separate document containing only the 
initial ECG, previous ECG (when available) and an event 
identifier. A second standardized, closed-ended electronic 
data collection form was used to review all ECGs. All ECGs 
were reviewed by two experienced board-certified emergency 
physicians (VL, ES). Both reviewers were blinded to the 
objectives and methods of the study, the potassium value, 
associated medical history, clinical information, and all 
other data collected for the patient. The ECG reviewers were 
also blinded to the formal interpretation documented by the 
attending cardiologist, as well as each other’s readings. The 
reviewers independently examined each ECG for rate, rhythm, 
peaked T wave, PR interval duration, QRS wave duration, 
and type of intraventricular conduction delay (if present). If 
the reviewer agreed with the computer-generated values of 
PR interval and QRS wave duration (in milliseconds), then 
we used the computer-generated values. To keep the ECG 
reviewers blinded to the study objective, additional data that 
did not pertain to the objective of the study (left ventricular 
hypertrophy, ST elevation, ST depression and/or T wave 
inversion) were included in the data collection form. 
We categorized the ECG as “PR prolongation” if the 
PR interval was >200 ms, and either there was no previous 
ECG for comparison or the PR interval was <200 ms on the 
previous ECG. If the previous ECG had a PR interval >200 
ms, then the ECG was categorized as “PR prolongation” if the 
current PR interval was longer than the previous PR interval. 
Similarly, we categorized the ECG as “QRS prolongation” 
if the QRS duration was >110 ms, and either there was no 
previous ECG for comparison or the QRS duration was <110 
ms on the previous ECG. If the previous ECG had a QRS 
duration of >110 ms, then the ECG was categorized as “QRS 
prolongation” if the current QRS duration was longer than 
the previous QRS duration. In the scenario where the ECG 
reviewers disagreed on the rhythm, type of intraventricular 
conduction delay, or whether T waves were peaked or not, 
then we used the attending cardiologist reading.
Outcomes
We categorized ECGs as having “any abnormality 
suggestive of hyperkalemia” if one or more of the following 
were present: (1) peaked T waves; (2) PR prolongation; (3) 
QRS prolongation; (4) bradycardia (HR<50 bpm); (5) 2nd or 3rd 
degree heart block; (6) junctional rhythm; (7) ventricular escape 
rhythm; or (8) ventricular tachycardia.
The presence or absence of an adverse event within six hours 
of the laboratory measurement of a K+ ≥6.5 mEq/L (regardless 
of treatment status) was determined. We defined an adverse 
event as symptomatic bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, 
ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/
or death. Symptomatic bradycardia was defined as bradycardia

requiring treatment with calcium chloride, calcium gluconate, 
atropine, epinephrine, dopamine and/or pacing for symptoms of 
hypotension, syncope, chest pain, dyspnea and/or altered mental 
status. Calcium chloride or gluconate administered solely for 
asymptomatic bradycardia, an abnormal ECG or high potassium 
value was not recorded as an adverse event.  
Data Analysis
For the association of short-term adverse events with 
specific ECG abnormalities, we used the Pearson chi-square 
statistic. Fisher’s exact test was used for analysis involving 
less than five events. We analyzed each variable separately and 
calculated relative risk (RR). The relationship of the K+ value 
to an ECG with “any abnormality suggestive of hyperkalemia” 
and to short-term adverse events was determined using 
binary logistic regression. We included  K+ as a continuous 
variable in this model. The kappa statistic was calculated to 
evaluate the level of agreement between ECG reviewers for 
ECG variables, as well as for the level of agreement between 
reviewers for adverse events. We ran tests with SPSS (version 
22; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). 
RESULTS
The final study group included 188 episodes of severe 
hyperkalemia (Figure 1). The majority of episodes (n=176, 
94%) occurred in the ED. Mean patient age was 68 years (range 
21-94 years), 54% were male, and 94% were White (Table 1). 
All patients had abnormal kidney function. Half of the patients 
had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/
min/1.73m2. Established hemodialysis patients represented 32 
(17%) of the 188 patients. Established hemodialysis patients 
and non-dialysis patients had no significant difference in the 
frequency of ”any ECG abnormality suggestive of hyperkalemia” 
(RR 1.02, 95% CI [0.81-1.29]) or of short term adverse events 
((RR 1.34, 95% CI [0.58-3.06]). 
The mean serum K+ level was 7.1 mEq/L (SD=0.6mEq/L). 
The distribution of K+ values is presented in Figure 2. 
Potassium levels ranged from 6.5-9.3 mEq/L. A plasma K+ level 
was obtained on the same laboratory draw as the serum K+ level 
in 96 episodes (51%). 
The ECG findings are characterized in Table 2. The mean 
time between the ECG and K+ lab draw was 18 minutes (SD=14 
minutes). Previous ECGs were available for comparison 
in 123 episodes (65%). There was no statistical difference 
between the frequency of ”any ECG abnormality suggestive 
of hyperkalemia” in patients with previous ECG available and 
patients who did not have a previous ECG available (RR 0.92, 
95% CI [0.74-1.10]). The RR for adverse events in patients with 
previous ECG available was comparable to those for the full 
study population (Appendix).
A total of 134 episodes (71%, 95% CI [64.4%-77.3%]) 
had “any ECG abnormality suggestive of hyperkalemia,” with 
the two most common findings being QRS prolongation (43%, 
95% CI [36.7%-50.8%]) and peaked T waves (30%, 95%

CI [24.1%-37.2%]). More than half (n=77, 57%) had only a 
single hyperkalemic ECG abnormality. Multiple hyperkalemic 
ECG abnormalities were present in the other 57 episodes 
(43%), with the most frequent combination of findings being 
QRS prolongation with peaked T waves. 
We identified 28 patients (15%, 95% CI [10.4%-20.7%]) 
as having had an adverse event within six hours of the 
measurement of hyperkalemia. The mean K+ value in patients 
with an adverse event was 7.5 mEq/L (SD=0.7). Adverse 
events included symptomatic bradycardia (n=22, 12%), 
ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n=2, 1%), cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) (n=2, 1%) and death (n=4, 2%). Two 
patients experienced more than one adverse event. One patient 
with VT survived after a brief period of CPR. Another patient 
died after CPR for pulseless electrical activity. Three deaths 
occurred in patients who did not receive CPR as they were “do 
not resuscitate.” All patients with symptomatic bradycardia or 
VT improved after treatment with calcium.
The median time from the ECG to the adverse event was 47 
minutes. Adverse events occurred either prior to the laboratory 
notification of hyperkalemia (n=16, 59%) or shortly after the 
laboratory notification of hyperkalemia (mean 36 min; SD 19 
min). All adverse events occurred prior to treatment with calcium, 
and all but one occurred prior to K+-lowering intervention. The 
majority of patients (n=177, 95%) received treatment within the 
six-hour period. The median time from ECG to treatment was 85 
minutes. There was no significant difference in time to treatment 
between patients with or without adverse event, nor for each 
particular ECG finding. The rate of adverse events after treatment 
with calcium was 0% (95% CI [0-4.0%]) and after K+-lowering 
intervention was 0.7% (95% CI [ <0.01%-3.5%]). 
All of the 28 patients with an adverse event within six 
hours had an ECG with evidence of at least one hyperkalemic 
abnormality (Table 2). QRS prolongation (n=22) and 
bradycardia of less than 50 bpm (n=17) were the most 
common ECG abnormalities identified. Of the patients 
with QRS prolongation, the average QRS duration was 152 
msec (SD 35 msec, range 116-266 msec). The majority of 
the hyperkalemic patients with an adverse event had more 
than one hyperkalemic ECG abnormality (n=24, 86%). Two 
patients had isolated bradycardia (HR<50), one patient had 
isolated junctional rhythm, and one patient had isolated 
QRS prolongation. No short-term adverse events occurred 
among patients with isolated peaked T waves or isolated PR 
prolongation as their ECG manifestation of hyperkalemia.
QRS prolongation had a statistically significant 
association with short-term adverse events (RR 4.74, 95% CI 
[2.01-11.15]), as did the presence of junctional rhythm (RR 
7.46, 95% CI [5.28-11.13]). Additionally, bradycardia (HR<50 
bpm) had a strong positive association with short-term adverse 
event (RR 12.29, 95%CI [6.69-22.57])  All patients with 
a ventricular escape rhythm (n=4) developed a short-term 
adverse event. There was no statistically significant correlation 
between peaked T waves and short-term adverse events (RR 
0.77, 95% CI [0.35-1.70]). Analysis of the association of 
PR prolongation and adverse events was limited because 
the majority of the patients who had a short-term adverse 
event were in a non-sinus rhythm (junctional rhythm n=11, 
ventricular escape rhythm n=4, atrial fibrillation n=6, 2nd 
degree heart block n=1). Of the six patients with short-term 
adverse events who could have a PR interval measured, three 
patients had PR prolongation.
We calculated the interrater reliability with a kappa value of 
1.0 for PR prolongation and QRS prolongation; 0.662 for peaked 
T waves, 0.716 for rhythm analysis, 0.870 for type of block, and 
0.822 for “any abnormality suggestive of hyperkalemia.” The 
interrater reliability for the presence or absence of a short-term 
adverse event was strong (kappa 0.870).

This paper is the largest study to date to report the 
relationship of specific ECG abnormalities to short-term 
adverse events in patients with severe hyperkalemia

Figure 2. Hyperkalemic electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and six-hour adverse events in patients with severe hyperkalemia (K+≥6.5 
mEq/L).  Potassium level was predictive of having “any ECG abnormality suggestive of hyperkalemia” (OR 2.71, 95% CI [1.31-5.59]) and of 
adverse event within six hours (OR 3.35, 95% CI [1.72-6.53]). We have not adjusted for potentially relevant covariates.
(K+≥6.5 mEq/L). Short-term adverse events occurred in 
15% of patients (95% CI [10.4%-20.7%]). All patients who 
experienced a short-term adverse event had a preceding ECG 
that demonstrated at least one hyperkalemic abnormality. An 
increased likelihood of short-term adverse event was found 
for hyperkalemic patients whose ECG demonstrated QRS 
prolongation, bradycardia (HR<50), and/or junctional rhythm.
Previous research has demonstrated that ECG abnormalities 
and adverse events typically occur in hemodialysis patients 
at higher serum K+ levels than those with preserved renal 
function.9,19 In our study, there was no statistical difference 
between the frequency of hyperkalemic ECG abnormalities 
and adverse events in established hemodialysis patients and 
non-dialysis patients. We suggest that this lack of distinction 
between the two groups derives from the high rate of severe renal 
impairment (81%) in our study’s non-dialysis patients.
To our knowledge, prior to our publication only two other 
studies have reported the relationship between ECG findings of 
hyperkalemia and the development of adverse events.11,16 Our 
study methods were designed to minimize limitations in two 
similar designs. 
In An’s study of patients with K+≥6.5 mEq/L, ECG 
findings were correlated with survival to hospital discharge.16  
In comparison with our study, An’s study did not focus on 
the use of the ECG for risk stratification of hyperkalemic 
patients. The most common ECG finding of hyperkalemia was 
“asystole or pulseless electrical activity,” a reflection of the 
fact that 20% of the hyperkalemic patients were diagnosed at 
time of cardiac arrest. In addition, the time from ECG to death 
was not reported. A significant lapse of time between the ECG 
and death is suggested by the report that almost half (47%) of 
patients were not hyperkalemic at the time of their death.
In Montague’s study of 90 patients with K≥6.0 mEq/L, 
14 patients experienced arrhythmia or cardiac arrest.11 Fewer 
than half of the patients with arrhythmia or cardiac arrest were 
noted to have new T-wave peaking or symmetry. Montague’s 
finding is consistent with our observation that only 25% of 
patients with short-term adverse events had peaked T waves. 
However, this study did not discuss the presence or absence of 
other hyperkalemic ECG manifestations (such as bradycardia, 
junctional rhythm, PR prolongation, QRS prolongation) in the 
study population.

Can the Electrocardiogram Risk Stratify for Short-term Adverse Events?
In contrast to An and Montague’s methods, no patients 
in this study experienced a cardiac arrest prior to or during 
the performance of the ECG. We examined multiple 
ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia. All adverse events 
occurred within six hours of the ECG, with a median time 
from ECG to adverse event of 47 minutes.
In our study, all patients who experienced a short-term 
adverse event had a preceding ECG that demonstrated 
hyperkalemic abnormality (100%, 95% CI [85.7-100%]). 
In fact, the majority of the hyperkalemic patients with a 
short-term adverse event had more than one hyperkalemic 
ECG abnormality (86%). However, the small number of 
adverse events in our study resulted in CIs that were too 
broad to conclude that hyperkalemia patients without ECG 
abnormalities do not have short-term adverse events.
Three quarters of patients with short-term adverse 
events did not have peaked T waves, and there was no 
statistically significant correlation between the presence 
of peaked T waves and the development of a short-
term adverse events. These findings contradict classic 
teaching. Texts and papers tend to emphasize peaked T 
waves as the ECG manifestation of hyperkalemia in their 
illustrations and research design.11,17-19 In contrast, our study 
identified QRS prolongation (RR 4.74, 95% CI [2.01-
11.15]), junctional rhythm (RR 7.46, 95% [5.28-11.13]), 
and bradycardia of less than 50 bpm (RR 12.29, 95% CI 
[6.69-22.57]) as the ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia 
associated with short-term adverse events.
Interestingly, all adverse events in our study occurred 
prior to treatment with calcium, and all but one occurred 
prior to K+-lowering intervention. There was no significant 
difference in time to treatment between patients with or 
without adverse events. Rather, adverse events occurred 
either prior to the laboratory notification of hyperkalemia 
(n=16, 59%) or shortly after the laboratory notification of 
hyperkalemia (mean 36 min; SD 19 min). One potential 
application of our study results would be the use of the 
ECG for early identification of patients who are at higher 
risk of adverse events. These patients could then be 
prioritized to rapid treatment (either empirically if clinical 
suspicion for hyperkalemia is high or after laboratory 
notification if hyperkalemia was not clinically suspected). 
Our findings suggest that the ECG is a useful tool in 
the stratification of hyperkalemic patients into higher and 
lower risk groups. This study is the first step in creating 
a predictive tool for the use of the ECG to identify which 
hyperkalemic patients are at risk for adverse events.
LIMITATIONS
The lack of racial/ethnic diversity in our study sample 
(94% White) may limit the applicability of our findings to 
more diverse populations.

Can the Electrocardiogram Risk Stratify for Short-term Adverse Events? 
Durfey et al.
Severely hyperkalemic patients frequently have additional 
metabolic abnormalities and these can also affect the ECG. 
Concurrent metabolic disturbances thought to worsen the ECG 
manifestations of hyperkalemia (hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, 
acidemia) were more common in our study than metabolic 
disturbances thought to lessen the ECG manifestations of 
hyperkalemia (hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, alkalemia).2 
These patients’ ECGs can also be affected by underlying cardiac 
disease. We performed comparison to previous ECG to decrease 
the effect of baseline ECG abnormalities. Previous ECG 
was unavailable in 35% of patients. However, we observed 
no difference between the frequency of hyperkalemic ECG 
abnormality between patients with or without a previous ECG. 
While the ECG readers were blinded to the study methods 
and objective, the high number of ECGs with hyperkalemic 
abnormalities, along with a lack of non-hyperkalemic controls, 
could have led the ECG readers to suspect that the study 
population contained patients with hyperkalemia. 
Our definition of symptomatic bradycardia required both 
treatment and symptoms. Symptomatic bradycardia may 
have been underestimated because symptoms may have been 
present but not recorded in the medical record. All patients 
treated with atropine, epinephrine, dopamine and/or pacing 
had recorded symptoms and were classified as symptomatic 
bradycardia. Four patients were identified who were treated 
with calcium and had a documented HR of <50bpm within 
six hours, but were asymptomatic and therefore not classified 
as an adverse event. All four of these patients had an ECG 
with hyperkalemic abnormalities.
Patients may have had both severe hyperkalemia 
and additional acute medical illnesses. The influence 
of concurrent acute medical illness on the occurrence 
of adverse events in this study is unknown. However, 
the majority of patients who experienced an adverse 
event improved with calcium treatment, suggesting that 
hyperkalemia was the primary etiology.
Almost all patients (95%) received treatment and the 
timing and type of treatment was not standardized. Treatment 
differences had the potential to confound the associations 
between specific ECG abnormalities and adverse events. 
However, this was not observed. All adverse events occurred 
prior to treatment with calcium, and all but one occurred 
prior to K+-lowering intervention. There was no significant 
difference in time to treatment between patients with or 
without adverse event, nor for each particular ECG finding. 
Time to treatment was consistent with previous study of 
hyperkalemia treatment practices.8
CONCLUSION
Our findings support the use of the ECG in the risk 
stratification of patients with severe hyperkalemia. All 
hyperkalemic patients in our sample who experienced 
a short-term adverse event had a preceding ECG that 
demonstrated at least one hyperkalemic abnormality. An 
increased likelihood of short-term adverse event was found 
for hyperkalemic patients whose ECG demonstrated QRS 
prolongation, bradycardia (HR<50), and/or junctional 
rhythm. These data could be used to create a predictive 
tool to identify which hyperkalemic patients are at risk for 
adverse events based on ECG findings.
