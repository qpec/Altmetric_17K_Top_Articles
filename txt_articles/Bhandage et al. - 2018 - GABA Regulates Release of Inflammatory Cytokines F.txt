The neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an extracellular signaling molecule in the brain and in pan-
creatic islets. Here, we demonstrate that GABA regulates cytokine secretion from human peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD4+ T cells. In anti-CD3 stimulated PBMCs, GABA (100 nM) inhibited release of 47
cytokines in cells from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but only 16 cytokines in cells from nondiabetic
(ND) individuals. CD4+ T cells from ND individuals were grouped into responder or non-responder T cells ac-
cording to effects of GABA (100 nM, 500 nM) on the cell proliferation. In the responder T cells, GABA decreased
proliferation, and inhibited secretion of 37 cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner. In the non-re-
sponder T cells, GABA modulated release of 8 cytokines. GABA concentrations in plasma from T1D patients and
ND individuals were correlated with 10 cytokines where 7 were increased in plasma of T1D patients. GABA
inhibited secretion of 5 of these cytokines from both T1D PBMCs and ND responder T cells. The results identify
GABA as a potent regulator of both Th1- and Th2-type cytokine secretion from human PBMCs and CD4+ T cells
where GABA generally decreases the secretion.

1. Introduction
Neurotransmitter signaling is normally associated with the nervous
system but compiling evidence suggests that many neurotransmitters
exert modifying influence on cells of the immune system (Levite,
2008; Jin et al., 2011b; Barragan et al., 2015; Levite et al., 2001; Franco
et al., 2007). The amino acid γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is best
known as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, but it is
also present in the pancreatic islets and in blood (Baekkeskov et al.,
1990; Petty and Sherman, 1984; Farrant and Nusser, 2005; Li et al.,
2015). In the brain, GABA is made in neurons from the amino acid glu-
tamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) that is pres-
ent in two isoforms, GAD65 and 67 (Bu et al., 1992). GAD is also found in
the insulin-secreting β cells in the pancreatic islets, where GAD65 is one
of the main autoantigen in T1D in humans (Kanaani et al., 2015, Bu et al.,
1992, Baekkeskov et al., 1990). Interestingly, some immune cells may
also produce and release GABA (Fuks et al., 2012; Bhat et al., 2010).
Where GABA in blood comes from is still being explored, but the re-
cently discovered drainage system of the brain, the glymphatic system
(Plog and Nedergaard, 2018), identifies the brain, in addition to periph-
eral organs, as a potential source for GABA in blood. In the pancreatic is-
lets, GABA is an auto- and paracrine signaling molecule activating GABA
receptors on the endocrine cells and, perhaps, also on immune cells that
may enter the islets (Birnir and Korpi, 2007; Kanaani et al., 2015;
Caicedo, 2013; Bhandage et al., 2015). Similarly, in blood, immune
cells may be regulated by GABA (Bhandage et al., 2015; Bjurstom et
al., 2008; Tian et al., 2004; Tian et al., 1999). In T1D, the β cell mass de-
clines and, thereby, also the local source for GABA in the pancreatic islets
(Fiorina, 2013, Tian et al., 2013).
GABA activates two types of receptors in the plasma membrane of
cells; the GABAA receptors, that are Cl− ion channels opened by GABA,
and the G-protein-coupled GABAB receptor (Marshall et al., 1999;
Olsen and Sieghart, 2008; Olsen and Sieghart, 2009). The GABAA recep-
tors are pentameric, homo- or heteromeric, receptors formed from 19
known subunit isoforms (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε θ, π, ρ1–3) (Olsen
and Sieghart, 2009). In contrast, the GABAB receptor is normally formed
as a dimer of the two isoforms identified to date (Marshall et al., 1999;

 Gassmann et al., 2004). GABA receptors are expressed in immune cells,
but their ability to influence the functional phenotype, i.e. proliferation,
migration or cytokine secretion, of the cells is still relatively unexplored
(Barragan et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2011b). Here, we studied effects of GABA
on human PBMCs and T cells from ND individuals and T1D patients. The
results revealed that GABA in a concentration-dependent manner regu-
lates release of a variety of cytokines from PBMCs and CD4+ T cells. In
PBMCs from T1D patients, GABA significantly altered secretion of both
pro- and anti-inflammatory types of cytokines.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Individuals and Ethical Permits
The study was approved by Regional Ethical Review Board in Upp-
sala, and the reported investigations were carried out in accordance
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.
The study includes 30 healthy controls and 64 T1D patients. All partici-
pants signed a written consent form before entering the study. The par-
ticipants were recruited at Uppsala University Hospital. Demographic
characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table S1. All the
participants were screened for islet autoantibodies (GAD and islet anti-
gen-2, IA2), which were not present in any of the healthy controls. None
of the healthy controls had a first degree relative diagnosed with T1D.
None of the participants was ill from, or had recently recovered from,
an infectious disease. All blood samples were collected in the morning
after an overnight fasting under standardized conditions. Routine lab
parameters were analyzed at the Central Clinical Chemistry Laboratory,
Uppsala University Hospital. The venous blood samples were collected
in EDTA tubes and processed for further experimentation.
2.2. Plasma, PBMCs and T Cell Isolation
Plasma, PBMCs and T cells were isolated from freshly derived blood
samples and CD4+ T cells from buffy coats as previously described
(Bhandage et al., 2015; Bhandage et al., 2017). The plasma was isolated
by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C directly after collection
of blood, and immediately frozen at −80 °C.
The blood samples or buffy coats were diluted in 1:1 ratio in MACS
buffer (Miltenyi Biotec, Madrid, Spain), and layered on Ficoll-paque plus
(Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany). Briefly, the samples were then sub-
jected to density gradient centrifugation at 400g for 30 min at room tem-
perature. The PBMCs were carefully withdrawn and washed twice in
MACS buffer. A portion of PBMCs was saved in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich)
at −80 °C for mRNA extraction for qPCR, and other portions were used for
either proliferation experiments or isolation of T cells using human CD3
MicroBeads and human CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kits (Miltenyi Biotec). The
CD3+ T cells were used for RNA sequencing, and the CD4+ T cells were
used for proliferation and electrophysiological patch-clamp experiments.
2.3. Total RNA Isolation, Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR
and Western Blot Analysis
Total RNAs were extracted with RNA/DNA/Protein Purification Plus
Kit (Norgen Biotek, Ontario, Canada). The real-time qPCR method has
been described previously (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008, Bhandage et
al., 2015, Kreth et al., 2010, Ledderose et al., 2011, Bhandage et al.,
2017). The extracted total RNA was quantified using Nanodrop
(Nanodrop Technologies, Thermo Scientific, Inc., Wilmington, DE,
USA). Then, 1.5 μg RNA was treated with 0.6 U DNase I (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) for 30 min at 37 °C to degrade genomic DNA in the sample,
and then with 8 mM EDTA for 10 min at 75 °C for inactivation of DNase I
enzyme. The cDNA was then synthesized using Superscript IV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden) in a 20 μl reaction mix-
ture using standard protocol provided by manufacturer. To confirm effi-
cient degradation of genomic DNA by DNase I treatment, we performed
reverse transcriptase negative reaction which did not yield any amplifi-
cation in real-time PCR, confirming the absence of genomic DNA con-
tamination. The gene-specific primer pairs are listed in Table S2. The
real-time qPCR amplification was performed on an ABI PRISM 7900
HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) in a standard 10
μl reaction with an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C, followed
by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min, followed
by melting curve analysis.
Protein extraction from PBMC samples was performed using RNA/
DNA/Protein Purification Plus Kit (Norgen Biotek, Ontario, Canada). Pro-
tein amounts were quantified using the RC DCTM protein assay kit (Bio-
Rad, USA) in Multiskan MS plate reader (Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland),
and the concentration was calculated by plotting standard curve. Pro-
tein samples (60 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacryl-
amide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Thermofisher
Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden). The membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat milk powder in Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween
(TBS-T) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies
against NKCC1 (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, Cat No. 8351, USA),
GABAAR ρ2 (1:500; Abcam, Cat No. ab83223, Cambridge, UK) and
GAPDH (1:3000; Merck Millipore, Cat No. ABS16, USA). After 3 wash-
ings with TBS-T, the membranes were further incubated with horserad-
ish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Cat No. 7074) for 2 h and then the immunoreactive protein
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection
kit (Thermofisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden).
2.4. Determination of GABA Concentration
Plasma samples were thawed, and the level of GABA was measured
using an ELISA kit (LDN Labor Diagnostika Nord, Nordhorn, Germany)
as per manufacturer's guidelines (Fuks et al., 2012; Abu Shmais et al.,
2012; El-Ansary et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011). Briefly, the plasma samples
and standards provided in the kit were extracted on extraction plate,
derivatized using equalizing reagent and subjected to standard competi-
tive ELISA in GABA coated microtiter strips. The absorbance of the solution
in the wells was read at 450 nm within 10 min using a Multiskan MS plate
reader (Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland). We used 620 nm as a reference
wavelength. The outcome of the assay, optical density values, were used
to plot the standard curve for each run, which was then used to interpo-
late the GABA concentration of the samples. The readout obtained by the
GABA standards in the kit was compared to and agreed with the stan-
dards in the quality control (QC) report from the company (Fig. S1).
2.5. Electrophysiology
GABA-activated currents were recorded by the patch-clamp tech-
nique as previously described (Bjurstom et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2011a).
The extracellular recording solution contained (in mM): 145 NaCl, 3
KCl, 1 CsCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose and 10 TES; the pH was adjusted
to 7.4 with NaOH. To record in the whole-cell configuration, the pipette
solution contained (in mM): 136 CsCl, 20 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 3 MgATP and 10
TES; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. The pipette solution for the cell-
attached configuration contained (in mM): 69 NaCl, 5 KCl, 75 CsCl, 1
CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 10 TES; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Saclofen
(a GABAB receptor antagonist, 200 μM) and GABA (100 nM) were used
in the experiments. The pipette potential (Vp) was −80 mV (hyperpo-
larizing) in the whole-cell configuration and −60 mV (depolarizing)
in the cell-attached configuration.
2.6. Proliferation Assay
The proliferation of freshly isolated human PBMCs or CD4+ T cells
was evaluated with MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyl-
tetrazolium Bromide) assay (Ring et al., 2012). Cells were suspended
in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM glutamine,
284
A.K. Bhandage et al. / EBioMedicine 30 (2018) 283–294
 25 mM HEPES, 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml pen-
icillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) in a concen-
tration 1 million cells per milliliter. The assay was performed in 96-well
plates in duplicates or triplicates, where each well was pre-coated with
3 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody for 3–5 h at 37 °C. Each well was loaded with
100,000 cells. Drugs were added to the wells at the relevant concentra-
tions. The plate was incubated for 68 h at 37 °C (95% O2, 5% CO2) and
then, a media-soluble tetrazolium dye MTT was added to a final concen-
tration of 1 mM after which the plate was incubated for additional 4 h.
The plate was then centrifuged at 2000 RPM for 10 min to pellet the in-
soluble purple formazan crystals. The supernatant culture media was
collected, stored at −80 °C and used for analysis of cytokines using
the multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA). The formazan crystal
pellet was dissolved in DMSO and the plate was read within 10 min
using a Multiskan MS plate reader (Labsystems) at 550 nm. The optical
density value was used as the proliferation index value. Drugs were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich or Tocris (Bristol, UK).
2.7. Multiplex PEA for Cytokine Measurements
Plasma samples, and culture media samples that were collected
from plate wells at the end of the proliferation assay, were analyzed
by multiplex PEA with an Olink Inflammation I96X96 panel, targeting
92 proteins related to inflammation (Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Swe-
den) as previously described (Edvinsson et al., 2017; Assarsson et al.,
2014; Larsson et al., 2015; Larssen et al., 2017). Briefly, 1 μl of sample
(plasma samples or cell culture media samples) or negative control
was mixed with 3 μl probe solution containing a set of 92 paires DNA-ol-
igonucleotide-conjugated antibodies. Upon recognition of a target pro-
tein by a pair of probes, the DNA oligonucletodies on the antibodies
are brought in proximity and hybridize to each other, follwed by enzy-
matic DNA polymerization to form a new DNA molecule. The newly
formed DNA molecule is then amplified and quantified using a
microfluidic real-time qPCR, BioMarkTM HD (Fluidigm, South San
Francisco, CA, USA). The generated quantification cycle (Cq) values are
normalized against spiked-in controls to convert Cq values to Normal-
ized Protein eXpression (NPX) value on log2 scale. NPX is an arbitrary
unit, which is positively correlated to protein concentration. These
NPX data were then converted to linear data, using the formula 2NPX,
prior to further statistical analysis. Limit of detetion (LOD) for each pro-
tein was defined as three standard deviations above the background.
Proteins with levels below LOD were excluded from further data
analysis.
2.8. Total RNA Isolation and T Cell RNA Sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from T cells using Direct-zol™ RNA
MicroPrep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to manufactur-
er's recommendation. cDNA libraries were prepared according to
Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2013). For Illumina sequencing librar-
ies, 2 ng of cDNA was fragmented, amplified (Picelli et al., 2014), pooled
and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500. Single-end 43 bp reads were
generated and mapped to human reference genome GRCh38 by
employing STAR (version 2.4.1) with parameter outSAMstrandField
intronMotif (Dobin et al., 2013). Reads per kilobase transcript per mil-
lion mapped reads (RPKM) from RefSeq gene annotations were calcu-
lated using RPKM for genes (Ramskold et al., 2009). The uniquely
mapped reads were considered for the downstream analyses.
2.9. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis and data mining were performed using Statistica
12 (StatSoft Scandinavia, Uppsala, Sweden), GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla,
CA, USA) and edgeR bioconductor package. The statistical tests were
performed after omitting outliers identified by the Tukey test. The dif-
ferences between groups were assessed by nonparametric Kruskal–
Wallis ANOVA on ranks with Dunn's post hoc test. The contingency of
sex equality was accessed by Fisher's exact test. Comparison of demo-
graphic data between the two groups was based on a non-parametric
Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed data and a two-tailed
Student's t-test for normally distributed. Normality of data was assessed
by D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test. The correlation be-
tween inflammatory cytokines and demographic factors was assessed
using non-parametric Spearman rank correlation. The significance
level was set to p b 0.05.
3. Results
Demographic data for the ND individuals (n = 30) and the individ-
uals with T1D (n = 64) that participated in the study is presented in
Table S1. As expected the individuals with T1D had higher levels of
fasting glucose and HbA1c (Table S1). In addition, the individuals with
T1D were, on the average, slightly older and had a higher BMI (Table
S1). The creatinine levels did not differ between the two groups but
the glomerular filtration rate was higher in the diabetes group (Table
S1). Islet autoantibodies (GAD and IA2) were not detected in any of
the healthy individuals.
3.1. Cytokines in Plasma From ND and T1D Individuals
Immune cells secrete a large number of small proteins, collectively
termed cytokines, which may have a protective function or act as pro-
inflammatory molecules. We investigated whether the types of cyto-
kines in plasma differed between ND individuals and T1D patients. We
used the multiplex PEA to measure the blood levels of a panel of 92 cy-
tokines that are most commonly associated with inflammation (http://
www.olink.com/products/inflammation/#). The assay that uses paired
cytokine-specific antibodies for the different cytokines allows compari-
son of the levels of the same cytokine in samples from e.g. ND individ-
uals and T1D patients. However, the assay format does not support
comparison of the absolute levels of one cytokine to another as the affin-
ities of the antibodies for their cognate targets may vary. As illustrated in
Fig. 1a, 73 out of 92 analyzed cytokines were detected in plasma from
the donors, of which 26 cytokines were significantly up-regulated and
only one cytokine, FGF-21 down-regulated in plasma from T1D patients
as compared to ND individuals (Fig. 1b).
We then examined if the neurotransmitter GABA varied in concen-
tration in plasma between the ND and T1D individuals (Fig. 1c). The
GABA concentration range was similar for the two groups but there
was a trend for increased plasma GABA concentration in T1D patients
resulting in a significantly higher average concentration in the T1D
group (ND: 501 ± 32 nM; T1D: 649 ± 42 nM; p b 0.05). No correlation
was observed for GABA concentrations with age or disease duration. In
contrast, when the concentration of GABA was correlated with cyto-
kines detected in plasma, levels of 10 cytokines were significantly corre-
lated (p b 0.05) with the plasma GABA concentration (Fig. 1d; Table S3).
3.2. GABA Inhibits Proliferation of PBMCs From T1D Patients and Responder
CD4+ T Cells
To further examine the effects of GABA on the immune cells, we
stimulated PBMCs and CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 antibody to induce
proliferation of CD3+ positive T cells. We then examined effects on pro-
liferation of GABA and the GABAA antagonist, picrotoxin. In PBMCs from
ND individuals, GABA did not inhibit proliferation of the cells (Fig. 2a).
In contrast, cell proliferation of PBMCs from T1D patients was inhibited
in the presence of 100 nM GABA by approximately 20%, while GABA at
concentration of 1 μM did not have any inhibitory effect on the cell pro-
liferation. The inhibition was reversed by picrotoxin (Fig. 2b). We have
previously demonstrated that GABA may inhibit T cells proliferation
(Bjurstom et al., 2008) and, thus, examined whether CD4+ T cells
from ND individuals varied in their sensitivity to GABA. The results

 revealed that CD4+ T cells from the ND individuals could be grouped
into responders (n = 15) and non-responders (n = 7) depending on
whether or not GABA affected the proliferation of the cells (Fig. 2c).
We examined further if GABA, in a dose-dependent manner, could reg-
ulate proliferation of the responder CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2d). Application of
different GABA concentrations demonstrated increased inhibition of
proliferation from 1 to 500 nM GABA with a maximum inhibition of
approximately 40% by 500 nM GABA, whereas no inhibition of prolifer-
ation of the cells was recorded in 1 μM GABA (Fig. 2d). This is in line with
the fact that saturating GABA concentrations cause desensitization and
thus, non-functionality of GABAA receptors. The open channel blocker
picrotoxin partially reversed the 500 nM GABA-induced inhibition
(Fig. 2e) and the GABAA agonists muscimol (100 nM) and TACA
(100 nM) inhibited the proliferation similar to GABA (Fig. 2f), whereas

 the GABAB antagonist CGP52432 (50 μM) and the GABAB agonist baclo-
fen (100 nM) were ineffective (Fig. 2e, f). Together the results highlight
that immune cells and in particular CD4+ T cells can be divided into sub-
groups depending on whether or not their proliferation is regulated by
GABA. The greater inhibition observed for the PBMCs from the T1D pa-
tients as compared to ND individuals is consistent with the presence of
expanded T cells clones that respond to GABA in T1D (Tong et al., 2016).
GABA can potentially activate GABAA and GABAB receptors in the im-
mune cells (Tian et al., 2004; Bjurstom et al., 2008; Bhandage et al.,
2015). We, therefore, measured the expression level of the GABAA and
GABAB receptor subunits in PBMCs. The most prominent GABAA recep-
tor subunit was the ρ2 that was similarly expressed and present in most
samples from both ND and T1D individuals (Fig. 2g, Table S4). Protein
expression of ρ2 was confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. S2). Of
the two GABAB receptor subunits, only the GABABR1 was commonly
expressed. Our results confirmed previously reported expression of
GABA receptors in PBMCs (Bhandage et al., 2015). We further found
that the mRNA expression levels of auxiliary proteins of GABAA recep-
tors gephyrin and GABARAP were similar but the GABA transporters
GAT3, BGT1 and the enzyme GABA-T plus the insulin receptor were sig-
nificantly increased, whereas the expression level of radixin decreased
in PBMCs from T1D individuals (Fig. S3, Table S4). Interestingly, expres-
sion of Cl− transporters was altered in T1D (Fig. 2h). The transporter
that moves Cl− into the cell, NKCC1, was significantly down-regulated,
whereas the transporters that move Cl− out of the cells, KCC3 and
KCC4, were up-regulated in PBMCs from T1D patients. Protein expres-
sion of NKCC1 was confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. S2). Since
the effects of GABAA receptors are related to the Cl− equilibrium poten-
tial in the cells, any changes in intracellular chloride will have conse-
quences for GABAA signaling. We further investigated if GABA in
submicromolar (100 or 500 nM) concentrations activated single-chan-
nel currents in the T cells. GABA activated GABAA single-channel cur-
rents in the cells (n = 54), which were blocked by picrotoxin. The
GABAA receptors conductance ranged from 9 to 45 pS (Fig. 2i).
3.3. Cholesterol Biosynthesis Gene Levels Are Regulated in T Cells From T1D
Patients
We applied RNA-seq to examine the transcriptome of isolated CD3+
T cells from ND individuals and T1D patients (Fig. 2j). A total of 16,684
genes were identified after passing the quality control and deposited
at GEO database (GSE111876). To reduce the bias of genes with low
counts and only expressed in a few samples, we used the dataset with
8669 genes that are expressed in N1/3 of the samples (RPKMN5) in
both T1D patients and ND individuals. Eleven genes (edgeR p b 0.05,
FDR b 0.05) were differentially expressed by more than two-fold be-
tween T1D and ND samples, of which only 1 gene (SCARNA21) was
up-regulated and 10 genes were down-regulated in samples from T1D
patients (Fig. 2j). Among the down-regulated genes, 5 genes (SQLE,
MSMO1, DHCR24, CYP51A1, HMGCS1) are involved in the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway and 1 gene (INSIG1) encodes an endoplasmic re-
ticulum protein that regulates cholesterol biosynthesis (REACTOME,
http://reactome.org) (Table S5). Interestingly, the expression levels of
MSMO1 and CYP51A1 were significantly correlated with the plasma
GABA concentration (p b 0.05) (Fig. S4). Furthermore, the expression
of MSMO1 was also significantly correlated with BMI, fasting glucose
and HbA1c levels (p b 0.05) (Fig. S4).
3.4. GABA Regulates Release of Pro- and Anti-inflammatory Cytokines From
PBMCs
It is possible that GABA signaling regulates what cytokines are re-
leased from the immune cells. We, therefore, examined the culture
media from the anti-CD3 stimulated PBMCs using the inflammatory re-
lated protein panel described above to study which of the 92 cytokines
are released by the cells and whether GABA affects secretion of specific
cytokines. Fig. 3a shows the levels of the different cytokines detected in
the culture media harboring proliferating cells from ND individuals and
T1D patients. In the absence of GABA, a difference in the secretion level
was observed for six cytokines (Fig. 3a insert). Somewhat surprisingly,
the results shown in Fig. 3b and c and also Table S6 and S7 demonstrate
that GABA regulated the release of many pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines. In the culture media from stimulated PBMCs, GABA
(100 nM) significantly inhibited release of 16 cytokines from ND indi-
viduals (n = 7; Fig. 3b) and 47 cytokines from T1D patients (n = 13;
Fig. 3c), respectively, and, additionally, increased the release of two cy-
tokines from T1D patients (Fig. 3c). Cytokines released by stimulated
PBMCs, which were affected by GABA can be grouped according to
their function (Fig. 3d). The group of cytokines with the largest differ-
ence between ND and T1D PBMCs was the one associated with chemo-
taxis. The results are in agreement with that GABA regulates release of
cytokines from PBMCs in both health and in disease.
3.5. GABA Regulates Release of Pro- and Anti-inflammatory Cytokines From
CD4+ T Cells
ND individuals could be divided into two groups based on whether
or not their stimulated CD4+ cells responded to GABA in the prolifera-
tion assay (see Fig. 2c). We termed the two groups of stimulated
CD4+ cells, responder (n = 15) and non-responder (n = 7) T cells.
Stimulated T cells normally release more and higher levels of cytokines
than resting T cells (Fig. S5). We examined if CD4+ T cells from re-
sponders and non-responders differentially secreted cytokines and
then, if the release in the two groups were affected by GABA. Fig. 4a
shows that upon stimulation, cells from both groups released a number
of cytokines and to similar levels. Only levels of three cytokines were
significantly different between the two groups (Fig. 4a insert). In con-
trast regulation of cytokine release by GABA was far more prominent
in the responder as compared to the non-responder T cells. In non-re-
sponder T cells, GABA at 100 and 500 nM concentration regulated secre-
tion of only four cytokines at each concentration (Fig. 4b, c; Table S8).
This is in contrast to the responder T cells where GABA significantly
inhibited release of many cytokines and, interestingly, the different con-
centrations of GABA inhibited release of somewhat different cytokines
(Fig. 4b, c; Table S9). In the presence of 100 nM GABA, release of 27 cy-
tokines were significantly decreased as compared to 25 cytokines in the
presence of 500 nM GABA. Picrotoxin reversed the effects of GABA. Of
these cytokines, secretion of 15 cytokines, including both Th1- and
Th2-type cytokines e.g. TNF-α and IL-13, were inhibited by both 100
and 500 nM GABA (Fig. 5b). In the presence of 100 nM GABA, another
12 distinct cytokines, including the Th2-type IL-6 and IL-24 cytokines,
were specifically inhibited. Inhibition of the Th1-type cytokines INF-γ
and TNF-β plus the Th2-type cytokine IL-5 was observed only when
GABA was present at 500 nM concentration. Fig. 4d shows that the pro-
portion of cytokines associated with chemotaxis remained similar to
what was determined for PBMCs from T1D patients. However, when

 the GABA concentration was increased from 100 to 500 nM, the propor-
tion of cytokines associated with secretion and MAPK decreased,
whereas those associated with cellular response to cytokine stimulus
and regulation of immune response increased. The results demonstrate
that GABA in a concentration-dependent manner regulates cytokine se-
cretion from CD4+ T cells.
4. Discussion
The results identify GABA as a potent regulator of cytokine secretion
from human PBMCs and CD4+ T cells. GABA altered proliferation and
cytokine secretion in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased
the release of most of the cytokines. Importantly, immunomodulatory
submicromolar GABA concentrations are normally present in plasma
of both ND individuals and T1D patients.
We and others have shown that immune cells express the genes,
proteins and functional GABAA receptors and also the genes encoding
the chloride transporters that regulate the intracellular chloride concen-
tration in the cells (Tian et al., 2004, Bjurstom et al., 2008, Bhat et al.,
2010, Bhandage et al., 2015, Alam et al., 2006, Mendu et al., 2012, Jin
et al., 2011b). The most prominent GABAA subunit in the PBMCs is the
ρ2 subunit that can form homomeric or heteromeric receptors (Pan et
al., 2006, Wang et al., 1994, Johnston et al., 2010, Bhandage et al.,
2015). Interestingly, subtypes of GABAA receptors in the brain rarely
contain the ρ2 subunit (Olsen and Sieghart, 2009) making the ρ2-con-
taining GABAA receptors in the immune cells, potentially, a rather spe-
cific target for drug-development aimed at GABA signaling in immune
cells.
In T1D, the mass of the pancreatic islet β cells is greatly diminished
(Baekkeskov et al., 2017, Baekkeskov et al., 1990), highlighting that
GABA in blood must be maintained by another mechanism than secre-
tion from the pancreatic islets. An important source supplying GABA
to blood might be the brain, by the way of the newly discovered mech-
anism of volume-transmission of small molecules from the brain, via the
glymphatic system, to the periphery (Plog and Nedergaard, 2018). In
pancreatic islets where the β cells are intact and secrete GABA, as in
ND individuals, the islet interstitial GABA concentrations can be ex-
pected to fall within the GABA immunomodulatory range. In contrast,
GABA immunosuppression in pancreatic islets of T1D patients is likely
to decrease as the disease progresses and the β cells disappear.
This study reveals that GABA regulates secretion of a far greater
number of cytokines than was previously known. In plasma of T1D pa-
tients, levels of 26 cytokines were increased and of those, 16 were
inhibited by GABA in the cell assays (Figs. 1 and 5). Moreover, of the
10 cytokines in plasma that correlated with the GABA plasma concen-
tration, 7 cytokines were significantly increased in T1D patients and 5
of those (Flt3L, TRAIL, TNF-β, PD-L1, IL-10) were inhibited by GABA in
the cell assays (Figs. 1d and 5). The few studies that previously have ex-
amined effects of GABA on cytokine secretion in immune cells, have
only identified a limited number of cytokines e.g. IL-1β (Bhat et al.,
2010), IL-2 (Tian et al., 1999), IFNγ (Tian et al., 2004), TNF-α (Duthey
et al., 2010) and IL-6, IL-12 (Reyes-Garcia et al., 2007). Our study re-
vealed that about three times more cytokines were inhibited by GABA
in stimulated PBMCs from T1D individuals (47 cytokines) as compared
to stimulated PBMCs from ND individuals (16 cytokines). We and others
have previously shown that GABA can regulate proliferation of immune
cells (Tian et al., 1999; Bjurstom et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2011b; Dionisio et
al., 2011; Mendu et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2004). In this study, we used
this effect of GABA to divide the stimulated CD4+ T cell samples from
ND donors into non-responder and responder groups in terms of prolif-
eration and then, examined how these groups differed in cytokine se-
cretion. GABA effectively decreased proliferation and secretion of
cytokines only in the responder group. Here GABA decreased secretion
of 37 cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner. Of the inhibited
cytokines from T1D stimulated PBMCs and the responder cells, 29 cyto-
kines were common to both cell populations (Fig. 5a). Although the
GABA-induced immunosuppression was somewhat similar for the re-
sponder and T1D cell populations, it clearly differed for a number of spe-
cific cytokines (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, GABA did not decrease
proliferation of stimulated ND PBMCs nor proliferation or cytokine se-
cretion in the non-responder T cell population. The dramatic effect
GABA had on stimulated T1D PBMCs and responder T cell but not on
non-responder T cells, implies that GABA is a central molecule deter-
mining cytokine secretion in primed, activated cells. It is possible that
GABA has a homeostatic role in the immune system acting as a
“brake” but not a “full stop”.
GABA inhibited cytokines involved in chemotaxis in stimulated T1D
PBMCs more than in ND PBMCs cells. When the GABA concentration
was increased from 100 to 500 nM for the stimulated responder T
cells, the prominence of inhibited cytokines associated with secretion
and MAPK was decreased. In contrast, inhibition of cytokines that affect
either the cellular response to cytokine stimulus or regulate the im-
mune response increased in 500 nM GABA. The specific profile of cyto-
kines regulated by GABA indicates that the 100 nM GABA response
tended to modulated levels of Th2-type cytokines, whereas the
500 nM GABA inhibited both Th1- and Th2-type cytokine release (Fig.
5a, b). The results are consistent with a concentration-dependent im-
munomodulatory effect of GABA.
Interestingly, of the 10 genes down-regulated more than two-fold in
the CD3+ T cells from T1D individuals, six were associated with choles-
terol biosynthesis (Fig. 2j) and included MSMO1 and CYP51A1 that cor-
related negatively with the plasma GABA concentrations (Fig. S4).
MSMO1 further correlated negatively with HbA1c, fasting glucose and
BMI raising the question of its potential suitability as a biomarker in
T1D. Non-random distribution of proteins in the cell membranes are de-
pendent on e.g. cholesterol and the actin cytoskeleton (Goyette and
Gaus, 2017). The T cell receptor resides in lipid rafts that are microdo-
mains within the plasma membrane and where cholesterol is an essen-
tial component and contributes to membrane fluidity and signal
transduction (Kidani and Bensinger, 2016; Hubler and Kennedy,
2016). The change in cholesterol biosynthesis genes observed in the
T1D T cells are likely to have an impact on signaling processes associated
with signaling complexes located in the cell membrane.
The general inhibitory effect of GABA on the release of cytokines
from the immune cells was enlightening. It lends further support to
the immunomodulatory function of GABA (Jin et al., 2011b; Barragan
et al., 2015; Fiorina, 2013). It also highlights the importance of extracel-
lular GABA in the blood and in tissues such as the pancreatic islets and
the brain. Clearly, future studies are required to identify and character-
ize the various subpopulations of immune cells with respect to their
