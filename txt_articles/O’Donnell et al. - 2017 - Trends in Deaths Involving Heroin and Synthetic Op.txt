International Overdose Awareness 
Day — August 31, 2017
International Overdose Awareness Day is a global event 
held each year on August 31. This event aims to raise 
awareness that overdose deaths are preventable, reduce 
stigma about substance use disorders and drug-related 
deaths, highlight community drug-related services, and 
support evidence-based policies and programs to prevent 
or reduce drug-related harms. Additional information is 
available at https://www.overdoseday.com.
The opioid overdose epidemic resulted in the deaths of 
approximately 300,000 persons in the United States during 
1999–2015, including 33,000 in 2015 (1). The first wave 
of deaths began in 1999 and included deaths involving 
prescription opioids (1). It was followed by a second wave, 
beginning in 2010, and characterized by deaths involving 
heroin (2). A third wave started in 2013, with deaths involv-
ing synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl (IMF) (3). IMF is now being used in combination 
with heroin, counterfeit pills, and cocaine (3).
Reports in this issue of MMWR 1) highlight how 
increases in deaths and death rates related to heroin and 
synthetic opioids mirror data tracking illicit drugs and 
2) describe the role of IMF and fentanyl analogs in 281 
overdose deaths in 2 months in Ohio. Additional data 
and information on CDC’s state-level efforts to address 
drug-related deaths are available at https://www.cdc.gov/

Opioid overdose deaths quadrupled from 8,050 in 1999 
to 33,091 in 2015 and accounted for 63% of drug overdose 
deaths in the United States in 2015. During 2010–2015, 
heroin overdose deaths quadrupled from 3,036 to 12,989 
(1). Sharp increases in the supply of heroin and illicitly manu-
factured fentanyl (IMF) are likely contributing to increased 
deaths (2–6). CDC examined trends in unintentional and 
undetermined deaths involving heroin or synthetic opioids 
excluding methadone (i.e., synthetic opioids)* by the four 
U.S. Census regions during 2006–2015. Drug exhibits (i.e., 
drug products) obtained by law enforcement and reported

opioids excluding methadone” is a defined cause of death category.

to the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA’s) National 
Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) that tested 
positive for heroin or fentanyl (i.e., drug reports) also were 
examined. All U.S. Census regions experienced substantial 
increases in deaths involving heroin from 2006 to 2015. Since 
2010, the South and West experienced increases in heroin drug 
reports, whereas the Northeast and Midwest experienced steady 
increases during 2006–2015.† In the Northeast, Midwest, and 
South, deaths involving synthetic opioids and fentanyl drug 
reports increased considerably after 2013. These broad changes 
in the U.S. illicit drug market highlight the urgent need to track 
illicit drugs and enhance public health interventions targeting 
persons using or at high risk for using heroin or IMF.

tional or undetermined intent heroin and synthetic opioid 
death rates per 100,000 population (using the National Vital 
Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files) were 
stratified by the four U.S. Census regions for 2006–2015. 
The following International Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
Revision codes were used to identify deaths involving heroin 
and synthetic opioids: 1) underlying cause-of-death codes 
X40–X44 (unintentional) or Y10–Y14 (undetermined)** and 
2) opioid-specific multiple cause-of-death codes of T40.1 for 
heroin and T40.4 for synthetic opioids. Total deaths involving

** Suicides and homicides were excluded because the focus was on unintentional 
overdoses. Trends in unintentional overdose deaths are expected to be different 
from those of intentional poisoning deaths. During 2006–2015, only 1.1% 
and 9.1% of deaths involving heroin or synthetic opioids were categorized as 
homicides or suicides, respectively (https://wonder.cdc.gov/). Undetermined 
intent overdoses were included because they might have been unintentional; 
only 7% of analyzed deaths were categorized as undetermined.

opioids) and total deaths involving synthetic opioids (i.e., 
deaths involving synthetic opioids with or without heroin) 
were categorized further into three groups: 1) deaths involving 
heroin without synthetic opioids, 2) deaths involving synthetic 
opioids without heroin, and 3) deaths involving use of both 
heroin and synthetic opioids.†† Changes in deaths involving 
synthetic opioids after 2013 have been primarily driven by IMF 
and thus are a proxy for changes in deaths involving fentanyl 
after 2013 (5,6).§§ Piecewise linear regression analyses were 
used to examine hypotheses that regional trends mirrored the 
national trends in which deaths involving heroin and heroin 
drug reports increased at faster rates starting in 2010 and 
deaths involving synthetic opioids and fentanyl drug reports 
 
†† “Deaths involving heroin without synthetic opioids” and “deaths involving 
synthetic opioids without heroin” exclude deaths with synthetic opioids and 
heroin, respectively, but other substances could have contributed to the deaths.
 
§§ Fentanyl-related overdose deaths were estimated to have increased by 2,295 
from 1,905 in 2013 to 4,200 in 2014 (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/
nvsr65/nvsr65_10.pdf). This accounts for approximately 94% of the increase 
in deaths involving synthetic opioid excluding methadone from 3,105 to 5,544.
increased at faster rates starting in 2013. To examine the impact 
of synthetic opioids on the increase in deaths involving heroin 
without synthetic opioids, rate increases in deaths involving 
heroin without synthetic opioids were examined before and 
after 2013.
The rate of deaths involving heroin increased during 
2006–2015 nationally and in all four U.S. Census regions 
(Table). Total deaths involving heroin increased more sharply 
during 2010–2015 than during 2006–2009 in all regions, 
with the largest increases occurring during 2010–2015 in 
the Northeast (average yearly increase of 1.02 deaths per 
100,000 population) and Midwest (average yearly increase of 
0.89 deaths per 100,000 population) (Table). Heroin drug 
report trends mirrored trends in total deaths involving heroin, 
with overall increases during 2006–2015 in all regions. The 
South and West experienced larger average yearly increases in 
rates of heroin drug reports during 2010–2015 than during 
2006–2009 (Table). In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest 
experienced steady increases in rates of heroin drug reports 
during 2006–2015 (Figure 1).

During 2013–2015, deaths involving synthetic opioids with-
out heroin increased at faster rates than did deaths involving 
heroin without synthetic opioids in the Northeast, Midwest, 
and South (Table) (Figure 2). Deaths involving use of both 
heroin and synthetic opioids had larger average yearly rate 
increases after 2013 than did deaths involving heroin without 
synthetic opioids in the Northeast (0.84 compared with 0.31 
per 100,000 population) and Midwest (0.62 compared with 
0.23), the two regions that experienced the largest increases 
in total deaths involving heroin (Table). Mirroring the pat-
tern in deaths involving synthetic opioids, rates of fentanyl 
drug reports increased significantly nationally and across all 
regions starting in 2013 after having remained level during 
2006–2012 (Figure 1).
Discussion
Three interconnected trends drove increases in uninten-
tional or undetermined deaths involving heroin and synthetic 
opioids in the United States during 2006–2015: increases in 
the supply and use of heroin (3), mixing of fentanyl into the 
heroin supply, and increases in deaths involving synthetic 
opioids without heroin. Large increases in the heroin supply 
coincided with increases in deaths involving heroin across all 
U.S. Census regions, with the largest increases in the Northeast 
and Midwest. In 2016, many state and local law enforcement 
agencies in these regions reported that heroin could be easily 
obtained in their communities and was the top drug threat (2). 
The increasing availability of heroin comes at a time when an 
estimated 2 million persons reported a substance use disorder 
involving misuse of prescription opioids and nearly 600,000 
reported a substance use disorder involving heroin in 2015.¶¶ 
Increased heroin availability combined with high potency and 
relatively low price might have made heroin a viable substitute 
 
¶¶ The National Survey on Drug Use and Health collects data on prescription pain 
reliever use. Although survey respondents can write in nonopioid pain relievers, 
all pain relievers specifically asked about are opioids. Therefore, misuse of pain 
relievers is a close approximation of misuse of prescription opioid pain relievers. 
Misuse of pain relievers was defined as any use in a way not directed by a doctor.

because its effects are similar to those of prescription opioids 
(7). The strongest risk factor for heroin use and dependence 
is misuse of or dependence on prescription opioids; approxi-
mately 75% of persons who initiate heroin first misused 
prescription opioids (7), although only a small percentage of 
persons misusing prescription opioids begin using heroin.***
The second trend contributing to increases in deaths involv-
ing heroin and synthetic opioids is the mixing of fentanyl 
into the heroin supply by drug traffickers and persons misus-
ing opioids. In 2015, DEA and CDC released a nationwide 
alert and a public health advisory††† about large increases 
in fentanyl drug reports and deaths across multiple states in 
the Northeast, Midwest, and South, beginning in late 2013 
(8). The high potency and rapid onset of action of fentanyl 
and fentanyl analogs and the difficulty of mixing nonlethal 
doses makes fentanyl more dangerous to use than heroin (8).

Approximately half of the increase in deaths involving heroin 
after 2013 is attributable to increases in deaths involving use 
of both heroin and fentanyl. In the Northeast and Midwest, 
the U.S regions reporting the sharpest increases in fentanyl 
drug reports, deaths involving use of both heroin and synthetic 
opioids accounted for 77% of the total increase in deaths 
involving heroin. One possible reason for the relative stability 
of total deaths involving synthetic opioids and fentanyl drug 
reports in the West is that the form of heroin sold primarily 
west of the Mississippi River (black tar heroin) is difficult to 
mix with fentanyl, whereas white powder heroin, the type 
primarily sold east of the Mississippi, is more easily mixed 
with fentanyl (2). Reports from 14 states§§§ have shown that 
increases in deaths involving fentanyl (from 2,418 in 2014 to 
4,980 in 2015) accounted for most of the increase in deaths 
 §§§ Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New 
Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
Virginia, and West Virginia. Georgia and Pennsylvania reported deaths testing 
positive for fentanyl; the remaining 12 states reported fentanyl-related deaths.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Opioid overdose deaths in the United States have been 
increasing since 1999, initially driven by prescription opioid 
misuse and more recently by heroin and other illicit opioid use.
What is added by this report?
Rates of deaths involving heroin increased in all U.S. Census 
regions from 2006 to 2015. The increase appears to be driven in 
part by increases in the heroin supply after 2010 and by the 
introduction of illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), a synthetic 
opioid, into the heroin market. Deaths involving both heroin 
and synthetic opioids increased sharply after 2013. The largest 
increases were in regions where white powder heroin is 
primarily used. Deaths involving synthetic opioids without 
heroin also increased sharply after 2013, indicating emergence 
of synthetic products without heroin or mixing of IMF into other 
drugs, including cocaine.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Changes in the supply and potency of illicit drug products can 
substantially contribute to increases in overdose deaths 
regardless of rates of opioid misuse. With continued increases in 
the heroin and synthetic opioid supply and deaths in the 
context of prescription opioid misuse, sustained, targeted, and 
multisectoral responses to the opioid overdose epidemic are 
needed, including timely surveillance, safer opioid prescribing, 
education on opioid overdose and naloxone, linkage and access 
to treatment, leveraging of community-based services, and 
collaboration between public health and public safety agencies.
involving synthetic opioids (from 2,658 in 2014 to 4,806 in 
2015). These data, coupled with recent public health and law 
enforcement reports, continue to demonstrate that increases 
in deaths involving synthetic opioids are primarily driven by 
IMF (2,5,6).
Finally, multiple factors are likely driving the substantial 
increases in deaths involving synthetic opioids without heroin 
after 2013. First, the difficulty in distinguishing deaths involv-
ing morphine from deaths involving heroin might result in 
misclassifying some deaths as involving synthetic opioids 
without heroin (9). Also, drug products containing IMF are 
rapidly evolving, with IMF distributed in counterfeit prescrip-
tion pills (4), mixed with and sold as cocaine, or sold as powders 
to persons using heroin with and without their knowledge that 
the product contains fentanyl (2,6).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limi-
tations. First, deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids 
are likely underestimated because 17% of death certificates 
for drug overdose deaths lack information on the specific 
drug(s) involved, and this percentage varies widely by state 
(1). Second, although analyses excluded intentional deaths, it 
is possible that deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids 
of undetermined intent might include homicides or suicides; 
however, only 7% of the analyzed deaths were categorized as 
undetermined. Third, toxicologic testing for synthetic opioids 
might have increased during 2006–2015, leading to higher 
rates because of better detection. Fourth, deaths involving 
synthetic opioids were a proxy for change in deaths involving 
fentanyl, but deaths involving other synthetic opioids, like 
tramadol, were included, which might result in underestimat-
ing increases in deaths involving fentanyl. Finally, NFLIS drug 
reports might vary because of jurisdictional differences in drug 
evidence submission and testing practices.
The heroin and IMF drug market in the United States is 
rapidly expanding in the context of widespread prescription 
opioid misuse. As a result, opioid-involved deaths are cur-
rently at peak reported levels. Enhanced, timely surveillance 
of the illicit drug supply and opioid overdoses is critical to 
rapidly track and respond to broad changes in the illicit opioid 
drug market, including the introduction of fentanyl analogs. 
Comprehensive testing of opioid overdose deaths is needed 
because fentanyl analogs, including potent analogs such as 
carfentanil, are increasingly distributed in illicit markets¶¶¶ 
(10). Evidence-based interventions such as implementing safer 
opioid prescribing,**** increasing naloxone availability,†††† 
and linking persons at high risk for an opioid overdose (e.g., 
persons treated in the emergency department for an overdose 
or persons released from prison, with a history of substance 
use disorder§§§§) to medication-assisted treatment, as well as 
geographically tailored responses linking law enforcement and 
public health, could help reduce opioid-involved morbidity 
and mortality. Finally, community-based services, like syringe 
exchange programs, can be leveraged to prevent infectious 
disease transmission among persons who inject drugs and as 
opportunities to connect persons with substance use disorders 
into care, risk-reduction services, and long-term recovery.
