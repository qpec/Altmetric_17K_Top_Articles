Background
Irreversible pulpitis, which is characterised by acute and intense pain, is one of the most frequent reasons that patients attend for
emergency dental care. Apart from removal of the tooth, the customary way of relieving the pain of irreversible pulpitis is by drilling
into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve) and cleaning the root canal. However, a significant number of dentists continue to
prescribe antibiotics to stop the pain of irreversible pulpitis.This review updates the previous version published in 2013.
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group’s Trials Register (to 27 January 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12); MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 27 January 2016); EMBASE via Ovid (1980
to 27 January 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (to 27 January 2016) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 27
January 2016). There were no language restrictions in the searches of the electronic databases.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials which compared pain relief with systemic antibiotics and analgesics, against placebo and analgesics in the
acute preoperative phase of irreversible pulpitis.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors screened studies and extracted data independently. We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using
GRADEpro software. Pooling of data was not possible and a descriptive summary is presented.

 Main results
One trial assessed at low risk of bias, involving 40 participants was included in this update of the review. The quality of the body of
evidence was rated low for the different outcomes. There was a close parallel distribution of the pain ratings in both the intervention
and placebo groups over the seven-day study period. There was insufficient evidence to claim or refute a benefit for penicillin for
pain intensity. There was no significant difference in the mean total number of ibuprofen tablets over the study period: 9.2 (standard
deviation (SD) 6.02) in the penicillin group versus 9.6 (SD 6.34) in the placebo group; mean difference -0.40 (95% confidence interval
(CI) -4.23 to 3.43; P value = 0.84). This applied equally for the mean total number of Tylenol tablets: 6.9 (SD 6.87) used in the
penicillin group versus 4.45 (SD 4.82) in the placebo group; mean difference 2.45 (95% CI -1.23 to 6.13; P value = 0.19). Our
secondary outcome on reporting of adverse events was not addressed in this study.
Authors’ conclusions
This systematic review which was based on one low powered small sample trial assessed as at low risk of bias, illustrates that there is
insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotics reduce pain or not compared to not having antibiotics. The results of this review
confirm the necessity for further larger sample and methodologically sound trials that can provide additional evidence as to whether
antibiotics, prescribed in the preoperative phase, can affect treatment outcomes for irreversible pulpitis.

Antibiotic use for severe toothache (irreversible pulpitis)
Review question
Are oral antibiotics effective and safe for treating pain in irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the nerve inside the tooth/nerve damage)?
Background
Irreversible pulpitis occurs where the dental pulp (tissue inside the tooth which contains the nerve) has been damaged beyond repair.
It is characterised by intense pain (toothache), sufficient to wake someone up at night and is considered to be one of the most frequent
reasons that patients attend for emergency dental care. Any tooth may be affected, it is not restricted to particular age groups, and it
usually occurs as a direct result of dental decay, a cracked tooth or trauma and thus tends to occur more frequently in older patients.
The ’standard of care’ for irreversible pulpitis - immediate removal of the pulp from the affected tooth - is now widely accepted and yet
in certain parts of the world antibiotics continue to be prescribed.
Study characteristics
The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 27 January 2016. One study involving 40 people with irreversible pulpitis
(nerve damage) was included. There were two groups of 20 people, one group was treated with penicillin 500 mg, the other with
placebo (no active ingredient) every six hours over a seven-day period. In addition, all of the participants received painkillers (ibuprofen
and paracetamol (acetaminophen) combined with codeine).
Key results
Antibiotics do not appear to significantly reduce toothache caused by irreversible pulpitis. Furthermore, there was no difference in the
total number of ibuprofen or Tylenol tablets used over the study period between both groups. The administration of penicillin does not
significantly reduce the pain perception, the percussion (tapping on the tooth) perception or the quantity of pain medication required
by people with irreversible pulpitis. There was no reporting on adverse events or reactions.
Quality of the evidence
This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as low. There
is currently insufficient evidence to be able to decide if antibiotics help for this condition. This review highlights the need for more
and better quality studies on the use of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
1 Small sample size, unable to use data, assume imprecise estimate.
2 The between-group differences in SPID (median; interquartile range) for the penicillin group were (6.0 ± 10.5), and for placebo (6.0
± 9.5) P value = 0.776. The SPPID (median; interquartile range) for the penicillin group were (3.5 ± 7.5) and placebo (2.0 ± 7.0) P
value = 0.290.
3 Small sample size and 95% confidence interval includes no effect and both the upper and lower confidence limit crosses the minimal

 B A C K G R O U N D
Dental emergencies are extremely common, a survey conducted
in the USA recorded that 12% of the population had experienced
toothache in the preceding six months (Lipton 1993). Non-trau-
matic dental condition visits account for 1.4% of all emergency
dental visits in the USA and have shown an annual rise of 4%
(from 1.0% in 1997 to 1.7% in 2007) (Onkunseri 2012). Dental
caries (tooth decay) is the result of bacterial attack on a tooth and is
the precursor to irreversible pulpitis, which is considered to be an
immune system mediated event affecting the dental pulp (nerve)
(Bergenholtz 1990). Acute and intense pain are the most typical
presenting symptoms of irreversible pulpitis. It occurs more com-
monly in vital teeth beneath deep caries before the bacteria have
even reached the pulp (Hahn 1991). Thus the involved tooth will
usually have an extensive restoration (filling) or caries or both un-
der which death of the pulp may occur quite quickly or which may
take years to occur even if the dental caries is removed (Tronstad
1991).
Description of the condition
The symptoms are a continuum and can vary but usually include a
history of spontaneous pain which may also involve an exaggerated
response to hot or cold that lingers after the stimulus is removed (
Soames1998). Anytooth maybe affectedbyirreversible pulpitis, it
is not restricted to particular age groups, it usually occurs as a direct
result of dental caries, a cracked tooth or trauma and thus tends
to occur more frequently in older patients. The involved tooth
is usually not sensitive to percussion, and palpation tests do not
produce an untoward reaction. The characteristics of irreversible
pulpitis are a vital pulp which responds to cold and electric pulp
testing. Not infrequently, cold may actually alleviate the pain of
irreversible pulpitis and thus, can be used as a diagnostic test (Cecic
1983). A number of variations of irreversible pulpitis have been
recognised (Cohen 2006). These include acute, subacute, chronic,
partial or total, infected or sterile, however it is not possible to
clearly differentiate these except by histopathological methods.
Description of the intervention
A range of oral antibiotics with differing dosing regimens may
be prescribed e.g. azithromycin (500 mg daily for three days);
clindamycin (150 mg four times a day for seven days); penicillin V
(250 mg four times a day for seven days); metronidazole (200 mg
three times a day for three days); amoxicillin (250 mg + clavulanic
acid 125 mg three times a day for five days) (Matthews 2003).
How the intervention might work
Pulpitis is an inflammatory reaction of the pulp and often occurs
without any evidence of bacteria in the pulp chamber. Antibiotics
have bactericidal or bacteriostatic properties or both and are used
widely to control or eliminate bacteria, but the mode of action and
extent to which antibiotics have an anti-inflammatory or analgesic
effect in irreversible pulpitis remains less clear.
Why it is important to do this review
There is limited and what appears to be largely anecdotal evidence
to support the routine prescribing of antibiotics for irreversible
pulpitis. It is likely that the practice of prescribing of antibiotics
may have arisen due to a misconception of the pathological process
of pulpitis or the perception that antibiotics should be prescribed
prophylactically in anticipation of pain arising prior to endodon-
tic treatment. Either of these approaches may have promoted the
inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for endodontic emergen-
cies. A study conducted in the USA of members of the Ameri-
can Association of Endodontists (AAE) surveyed their prescribing
practices and reported that 16.7% of the specialist endodontists
prescribed antibiotics for cases of irreversible pulpitis (Yingling
2002). General dental practitioners are often the first point of con-
tact for patients with irreversible pulpitis and although one study
conducted in Belgium reported that a smaller proportion (4.3%)
of general dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for irreversible
pulpitis (Mainjot 2009), another study conducted in Spain indi-
cated that a substantial number (86%) of respondents continue to
do so (Segura-Egea 2010). To further investigate the prescribing
behaviours of the general dentists and endodontists, we conducted
a survey with the same question as of this review and found that
one in every four dentists would prescribe antibiotics, when not
needed (Agnihotry 2014a). In a more recent study (Cope 2015),
it was found out that more than half of the sample size of gen-
eral dentists (65.6%) prescribed antibiotics when there was no ev-
idence of spreading infection.
It is believed that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics may have
added significantly to the increase in the infections caused by
multi-drug resistance bacteria. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) infections with concomitant staggering cost im-
plications is one of them (Cox 1995). Another emerging multi-
drug resistant strain, which is resistant to carbapenem, is Gram-
negative Enterobacteriaceae with New Delhi Metallo-beta-lacta-
mase 1 (NDM-1). It is spreading over many nations, including
India, United Kingdom and United States and has been identified
as a possible public health issue which can be dealt only through
coordinated international surveillance of antibiotics (Kumarasamy
2010). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
mates that about 100 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed
by office-based physicians each year, and that approximately one
halfof those prescriptionsappeartobe unnecessary(Colgan 2001).
Although the inappropriate prescribingof antibioticsforendodon-
tic emergencies has received much attention (Agnihotry 2014;
5

 Fouad 1996; Palmer 2003) it is unclear to what extent this may
have contributed to the development of resistant strains of bacte-
ria and the growing problem of antibiotic resistance (CDC 2008;
SMAC 1997).
Irreversible pulpitis, at least in the early phase, is not normally ac-
companied by the clinical signs of bacterial infection, i.e. swelling
and tenderness of adjacent mucosa, which more generally mani-
fests itself after the pulp has become necrotic and the infected pul-
pal tissues pass into the periapical region. Although some dentists
continue to prescribe antibiotics, there appears to be very limited
evidence that penicillin reduces pain, percussion sensitivity, or the
amount of analgesics required in untreated teeth diagnosed with
irreversible pulpitis (Nagle 2000).
Immediate pulpectomy is now widely accepted as the ’standard of
care’ for irreversible pulpitis (Walton 2009) and yet in certain parts
of the worldantibioticscontinue tobe prescribed. We considerthat
a systematic review is still necessary to provide further evidence of
the effects of antibiotics and ultimately more clarity and guidance
in the management of this clinical condition.This review updates
the previous version published in 2013 (Fedorowicz 2013).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were considered in this re-
view.
Types of participants
We included adult patients who were over the age of 18 and pre-
sented with a single tooth with a clinical diagnosis of irreversible
pulpitis.
Types of interventions
Active interventions
Administration of any systemic antibiotic at any dosage and any
analgesic at any dosage prescribed in the acute preoperative phase
of irreversible pulpitis.
Control
Administration of placebo and any analgesic, at any dosage, pre-
scribed in the acute preoperative phase of irreversible pulpitis.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Patient-reported pain (intensity/duration) and pain relief
measured on a categorical scale in the preoperative phase of
irreversible pulpitis.
Secondary outcomes
1. Type, dose and frequency of medication required for pain
relief.
2. Any adverse effects related to any clinically diagnosed
hypersensitivity or other reactions to either the antibiotics or
analgesics.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For the identification of studies included or considered for this
review, we developed detailed search strategies for each database to
be searched. These were based on the search strategy developed for
MEDLINE via Ovid (Appendix 3) but revised appropriately for
each database. There were no language restrictions on the searches
of the electronic databases.
For this update we searched the following databases:
• the Cochrane Oral Health Group’s Trials Register (to 27
January 2016) (Appendix 1);
• the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12) (Appendix
2);
• MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 27 January 2016) (Appendix
3);
• EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 27 January 2016) (Appendix
4);
• ClinicalTrials.gov (to 27 January 2016) (Appendix 5);
• the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
(Appendix 5).
Searching other resources
Only handsearching done as part of the Cochrane worldwide
handsearching programme and uploaded to CENTRAL was in-
cluded.
We searched reference lists of relevant articles and clinical trials in
an attempt to identify any potential or additional studies.

 Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (Zbys Fedorowicz (ZF) and Anirudha Agni-
hotry (AA)) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of stud-
ies resulting from the searches. All irrelevant records were excluded
and only details of potential studies were noted. Full copies were
obtained of all relevant and potentially relevant studies which ap-
peared to meet the inclusion criteria, or when there were insuffi-
cient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision. Studies
not matching our inclusion criteria were excluded and their details
and reasons for their exclusion were noted in the Characteristics
of excluded studies table in Review Manager (RevMan) (RevMan
2014).
Data extraction and management
Study details were entered into the Characteristics of included
studies table. We collected outcome data using a predetermined
form and entered them into RevMan. The review authors only
included data if there was an independently reached consensus.
All disagreements were discussed and resolved by consulting with
a third review author (Jassim Hasan Al-Langawi).
The following details were extracted.
1. Study methods: method of allocation, masking of
participants and outcomes.
2. Participants: country of origin, sample size, age, sex,
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
3. Intervention: type of antibiotic.
4. Control: analgesic, placebo or nil.
5. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes as described
in the Types of outcome measures section of this review.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Each of the two review authors then graded the selected studies
separately according to the domain-based evaluation described in
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.1.0
(updated March 2011) (Higgins 2011). The gradings were com-
pared and any inconsistencies between the review authors were
discussed and resolved.
The following domains were assessed as at ’low risk’ of bias ( i.e.
plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results), ’unclear’ (i.e.
uncertain risk of bias, plausible risk of bias that raises some doubts
about the results) or ’high risk’ of bias (plausible bias that seriously
weakens confidence in the results):
1. sequence generation;
2. allocation concealment;
3. blinding (of participants, personnel and outcomes
assessors);
4. incomplete outcome data;
5. selective outcome reporting; and
6. other sources of bias.
We categorised and reported the overall risk of bias in the included
study according to the following:
• low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the
results) if all criteria were met;
• unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt
about the results) if one or more criteria were assessed as unclear;
or
• high risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens
confidence in the results) if one or more criteria were not met.
These assessments are reported for the included study in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Measures of treatment effect
The trialists in Nagle 2000 used sum of pain intensity difference
(SPID) and sum of pain percussion intensity difference (SPPID)
to assess between-group differences. Values were expressed as me-
dians with interquartile ranges and were analysed using the Mann-
Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Each patient was asked to rate their pain
on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no pain; 1 = mild pain, pain that was
recognizable but not discomforting; 2 = moderate pain, pain that
was discomforting but bearable; 3 = severe pain, pain that caused
considerable discomfort and was difficult to bear). Patients were
asked to rate the pain to percussion using the same scale. SPID
is defined as the sum of pain intensity differences weighted by
the length of the interval since the previous observation. These
assessments were made at wake-up time over the seven-day study
period. We were unsuccessful in our attempts to contact the inves-
tigators to provide us with means or ranges of the minimum and
maximum scores for SPID and SPPID, and therefore we were un-
able to calculate and present means, standard deviations and con-
fidence intervals for these outcomes. These have been discussed
narratively based on the data as reported in the study (see Effects
of interventions).
We have presented the continuous outcomes on the original scale
as reported in the study for our secondary outcome ’number of
painkillers’ togetherwith theirassociated95%confidence intervals
(CIs). These data were analysed in RevMan (RevMan 2014) using
a random-effects model.
For future studies we will present continuous outcomes on the
original scale as reported in each individual study. If similar out-
comes were reported using different scales, we would convert these
to standardised mean differences (SMD).
We will present dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR), and if
found significant, we would convert them to the number needed
to treat (NNT) to find one success. We will report all outcomes’
data with their associated 95% CIs and analyse the data using
a random-effects model in RevMan, with a general inverse vari-
ance (DerSimonian and Laird method), unless stated otherwise.
In cases where only medians are presented with ranges, the mean
7

 is estimated by the median, and the variance using the range and
the number of observations (Hozo 2005).
Unit of analysis issues
It is possible that studies included in future updates may present
data from repeated observations on participants which may lead
to unit of analysis errors, if so we will follow the advice provided
in section 9.3.4 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Dealing with missing data
There were no missing data in the single included study. For future
updates, if data are missing attempts will be made to contact the
trial investigators.
Assessment of heterogeneity
There was only one single trial and therefore no assessments were
made.
If further studies are included in future updates, we will assess
clinical heterogeneity by examining the characteristics of the stud-
ies, the similarity between the types of participants, the interven-
tions and outcomes as specified in the criteria for included studies.
Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a Chi2 test and the
I2 statistic where I2 values over 60% indicate moderate to sub-
stantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). If this could be explained
by clinical reasoning and a coherent argument can be made for
combining the studies, we will enter these into a meta-analysis. In
cases where the heterogeneity could not be adequately explained,
the data will not be pooled. A cut off P value of > 0.1 would be
used to determine statistical significance.
Assessment of reporting biases
If a sufficient number (> 10) of trials investigating similar inter-
ventions are identified for inclusion in future updates of this re-
view, publication bias will be assessed according to the recommen-
dations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry as described in sec-
tion 10.4.3.1 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2011). If asymmetry is identified, we will
try to assess other possible causes and these will be explored in the
discussion if appropriate.
Data synthesis
If further studies are included the following methods of data syn-
thesis will apply. Data will be analysed using RevMan and reported
according to Cochrane Collaboration criteria. Pooling of data will
only occur if the included studies have similar interventions in-
volving similar participants. We will present risk ratios for out-
comes and odds ratios for adverse effect outcomes. The risk ratio
(relative risk) is the ratio of the risk of an event in the two groups
whereas the odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an adverse event
in the intervention group to the odds of an event in the control
group. Additionally, any data obtained from visual analogue scales
and any categorical outcomes will be transformed into dichoto-
mous data prior to analysis if appropriate. Risk ratios, the number
needed to treat and their 95% confidence intervals will be calcu-
lated for all dichotomous data.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If a sufficient number of studies with moderate to substantial het-
erogeneity (as defined above) are identified we will carry out sub-
group analyses based on different antibiotics and dosing regimens.
Sensitivity analysis
We had expected to be able to conduct sensitivity analyses to assess
the robustness of our review results by repeating the analysis with
the following adjustments: exclusion of studies at high risk of bias
and unpublished studies. However, as there was only a single trial
that matched our inclusion criteria no sensitivity analyses were
carried out.
Presentation of main results
We established a Summary of findings table 1 using the following
outcomes listed according to priority.
1. Patient-reported pain intensity (sum pain intensity
differences and sum pain percussion intensity differences).
2. Patient-reported pain relief.
3. Total number of ibuprofen tablets.
4. Total number of paracetamol (acetaminophen) + codeine
tablets.
5. Number of adverse events.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The search strategy used in the earlier version of this review in
2005 identified 39 references of which all but four were excluded
from further analysis. Full-text copies of these four papers were
obtained for further assessment. Only one study (Nagle 2000) met
the inclusion criteria and is included in the review. No additional
studies were identified for inclusion based on the updated searches
in September 2013 or January 2016 (Figure 1).

 Included studies
Methods
Nagle 2000 is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clin-
ical trial conducted in the emergency department of a university
dental college in the USA.
Participants and setting
Forty adult patients, 17 male, 23 female, with an age range of 30
to 34 years who had presented as an emergency with spontaneous
moderate to severe pain associated with a tooth, participated in
this study. All of the teeth were vital and responsive to an elec-
tric pulp tester (EPT) and to Endo Ice and displayed percussion
sensitivity. The diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis was confirmed by
a radiographically widened periodontal ligament space (see Addi-
tional Table 1).
Intervention
Twenty participants were allocated to antibiotic and analgesic and
20 to placebo and analgesic. The participants received a seven-day
oral dose (28 capsules each to be taken every six hours) of either
penicillin (500 mg) or a placebo control in which the participants
and trialists were double-blinded. They also received a supply of
pain medication consisting of ibuprofen 600 mg; paracetamol (ac-
etaminophen) with codeine 30 mg (Tylenol). No operative en-
dodontic treatment was performed during the course of the study.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for this review was pain relief in the preop-
erative phase of irreversible pulpitis. Participants in this study were
requested to complete a seven-day diary in which they recorded
pain, percussion pain, and the quantity and type of pain medica-
tion taken. Pain was assessed using a short ordinal numerical scale
graded from 0 to 3 (see Measures of treatment effect). Addition-
ally, the patients were asked to use the same scale to rate pain on
percussion which was achieved by tapping the affected tooth with
a finger. The pain scale used in this trial had been used in previous
pain studies which were referenced by the trialists of the included
study.
The secondary outcome was the type and dose of pain medication
required to achieve pain relief. The participants in this study were
instructed to initially take one tablet of the ibuprofen every four
to six hours as needed for pain and to take the Tylenol (two tablets
every four to six hours) only if the ibuprofen did not relieve their
pain. Each participant received a seven-day diary to record their
symptoms and the number and type of pain medication taken. No
assessments of adverse effects to either the antibiotics or analgesics
were considered or reported by the investigators.
Excluded studies
Three studies were excluded: a systematic review (Matthews 2003)
which included a potential trial (Henry 2001) which was sub-
sequently excluded as it investigated the effect of antibiotics on
postoperative endodontic pain. One trial (Fouad 1996) was ex-
cluded as it combined the interventions with immediate opera-
tive endodontic treatment. We excluded Nusstein 2003 because it
was a retrospective non-experimental study, see Characteristics of
excluded studies for further details.
Risk of bias in included studies
The single included study (Nagle 2000) met all of the criteria
across all of the domains in Cochrane’s tool for assessing the risk
of bias, and therefore this study was considered to be at low risk of
bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) (Figure
2).

study.
Allocation
Sequence generation
In this study the intervention (penicillin) and control (placebo)
groups were assigned before the experiment by using four-digit
numbers from a random number table. The method used to gen-
erate the allocation sequence was described in sufficient detail;
therefore, this domain was judged as at low risk of bias.
Allocation concealment
To ensure adequate concealment only the random numbers were
recorded on the data collection and postoperative diary sheets and
it was unlikely that allocation could be foreseen and therefore this
domain was judged as at low risk of bias.
Blinding
The measures used to blind study participants and personnel from
knowledge of which intervention a participant received as well as
blinding of outcomes assessors were described in sufficient detail.
The medications were blinded, randomised, and packaged by a
pharmacy. Each 500 mg gelatin capsule of either penicillin or
placebo was identical in form. The 500 mg tablets of penicillin VK
were ground into a powder and placed into the clear, unlabelled
gelatin capsules. The white powder of the lactose placebo was
indistinguishable from the white powder of the penicillin tablets
when viewed through the capsule.
Incomplete outcome data
The report was complete and there were no missing data and this
domain was judged as at low risk of bias.
Selective reporting
11
Antibiotic use for irreversible pulpitis (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 There was no evidence of selective outcome reporting and the
outcomes listed in the methods section were comparable to the
reported results. This was judged as at low risk of bias.
Other potential sources of bias
There was no evidence of other potential sources of bias in the
report of the included trial.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Antibiotics
for irreversible pulpitis
The single included study did not provide sufficient data to per-
form a statistical analysis on the primary outcome and the only
data presented are those which were published in the study. Un-
successful attempts to obtain additional and individual level data
from the trialists made it difficult to confirm the results presented
in their study (see Measures of treatment effect).
Primary outcome: Patient-reported pain
(intensity/duration) and pain relief
Baseline data indicated that all of the participants that entered
the study had moderate to severe pain (Additional Table 1). Af-
ter the first day of the study the average pain rating decreased
and remained quite stable over the following six days. This ini-
tial decrease in pain may be considered to be due to the effect of
the analgesics which was sustained by the gradual and progressive
necrosis of the pulp. However, at the end of the study period and
at the commencement of operative endodontic treatment it was
found that 75% of the teeth in the penicillin group and 80% in
the placebo were still vital.
There was a close parallel distribution of the pain ratings in both
the intervention and placebo groups over the seven days. The fol-
lowing data were presented as medians with their interquartile
range. The in between-group differences in sum of pain intensity
difference (SPID) for the penicillin group were (6.0 ± 10.5), and
for placebo (6.0 ± 9.5) P value = 0.776. The sum of pain percus-
sion intensity difference (SPPID) for the penicillin group was (3.5
±7.5) and placebo (2.0 ± 7.0) P value = 0.290 with differences as
assessed by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test considered by the
investigators of the study to be statistically significant at P value
< 0.05 (Additional Table 2). (See Measures of treatment effect for
additional information on these data.)
Secondary outcome: Type, dose and frequency of
medication required for pain relief
The number, percentage and average use and non-use of ibuprofen
and Tylenol are summarised in Additional Table 3.
On both day one and day two only one participant did not take
either one or other of the analgesic medications. The number not
taking any medication increased to three to four (15% to 20% )
on day three, and two to six (10% to 30%) on day four. On the
fifth to seventh days only four to seven (20% to 35%) did not
take any additional pain medication. At day seven, 20% of the
penicillin group and 35% of the placebo group took no additional
analgesics.
There was no significant difference in the mean total number of
ibuprofen tablets over the study period: 9.2 (standard deviation
(SD) 6.02) in the penicillin group versus 9.6 (SD 6.34) in the
placebo group; mean difference -0.40 (95% confidence interval
(CI) -4.23 to 3.43; P value = 0.84). The same was true for the mean
total number of Tylenol tablets: 6.9 (SD 6.87) in the penicillin
group versus 4.45 (SD 4.82) in the placebo group; mean difference
2.45 (95% CI -1.23 to 6.13; P value = 0.19). There was insufficient
evidence to determine whether penicillin reduced the quantity of
analgesic medication or not.
Secondary outcome: Adverse events
Not assessed.
D I S C U S S I O N
Summary of main results
The results of this well constructed but underpowered trial of 20
participants in each study arm indicate that the administration of
penicillin did not appear to significantly (P value > 0.05) reduce
either the pain perception, the percussion perception or the quan-
tity of analgesic medication required by patients with irreversible
pulpitis. Our secondary outcome regarding adverse events or re-
actions was not addressed. The quality of the evidence was rated
low for the different outcomes. For further details see Summary of
findings for the main comparison.
The significance of the relatively common occurrence of
toothache, the prevalence of inappropriate prescribing of antibi-
otics with the potential for producing antibiotic resistance and
patient sensitisation cannot be underestimated. It was somewhat
disappointing to see that only one single trial matched our inclu-
sion criteria.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The single included study (Nagle 2000) provides insufficient evi-
dence that the administration of antibiotics is effective in relieving
the pain from irreversible pulpitis. However, although we consider
that the population, intervention, comparator to the intervention,
and outcome of interest satisfy the clinical question of our review,
12

 the lack of further research since this study was conducted, which
is still highly desirable, would appear to indicate that there is a
wider acceptance that the ’standard of care’ and appropriate man-
agement strategy for irreversible pulpitis is immediate extirpation
of the pulp.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence as summarised in Summary of findings
for the main comparison was rated as low. The most important rea-
sons for downgrading for each outcome were: imprecision, mainly
due to low sample size and the 95% confidence interval included
no effect and the upper or lower confidence limit crossed the min-
imal important difference.
Limitations in study design and implementation
We did not identify any limitations in either the design or imple-
mentation of the study (Figure 2). However, adverse events were
not addressed in this study.
Indirectness of the evidence
Although limitedtoasingle study, the evidence canbe directlygen-
eralized to the clinical scenario of the presentation of irreversible
pulpitis.
Inconsistency of the results
The single included study did not allow any assessment of incon-
sistency of results.
Imprecision of the results
The single study with a low sample size included in this review pro-
vided limited amounts of data. Our primary outcome was down-
graded due to small sample size, and due to the sparse data we were
unable to further evaluate the imprecision of the results. However,
for our secondary outcome we downgraded twice as the confi-
dence intervals included no effect and both the upper and lower
confidence limit crossed the minimal important difference.
Publication bias
Although it would be reasonable to assume that the comprehensive
searches will have identified all existing randomised controlled
trials, and thereby helped to limit bias in the conduct of this review,
the absence of any published trials over the last 10 years creates
a measure of uncertainty that there may be further and as yet
unpublished studies which might add to the overall evidence.
Potential biases in the review process
We made every attempt to limit bias in the review process by
ensuring a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies.
The authors’ independent assessments of eligibility of studies for
inclusion in this review minimised the potential for selection bias.
The effects of language bias on the identification and selection of
studies for inclusion in a systematic review is widely recognised;
therefore, we ensured that language of publication was not used
as an exclusion criterion.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Our electronic searches did identify two systematic reviews
(Aminoshariae 2015; Matthews 2003) which offered strong con-
firmatory evidence that in the absence of systemic complications
e.g. fever, lymphadenopathy, cellulitis or in immunocompromised
patients, antibiotics alone have no place in the management of lo-
calised acute apical abscess. Furthermore, they stated that although
the pain from acute apical abscess is as a result of an infective pro-
cess, the infection is localised and that even in this terminal stage
of irreversible pulpitis the use of antibiotics as a sole or concomi-
tant therapy remains questionable.
In our search for additional studies and reviews, we also exam-
ined several clinical references and sources for guidelines and
systematic reviews: Agency for Healthcare Research and Qual-
ity (http://www.ahrq.gov/), National Guidelines Clearinghouse
(http://www.guideline.gov/), National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (http://www.nice.org.uk/), Scottish Intercolle-
giate Guidelines Network (http://www.sign.ac.uk/index.html),
UK Database of Uncertainties about the Effects of Treat-
ments (http://www.library.nhs.uk/duets/) and UpTo Date (http:/
/www.uptodate.com/home). It was surprising to find that the ma-
jority did not address this clinical topic or provided very limited
useful or current information that could aid clinical decision-mak-
ing.

Implications for practice
This review illustrates that there is insufficient evidence to deter-
mine whether antibiotics reduce pain or not when compared to
not having antibiotics. The quality of the evidence for the dif-
ferent outcomes was low, mainly due to imprecision of the data.
Although there was a paucity of high quality evidence to guide
clinical practice, the prescribing of antibiotics for irreversible pul-
pitis should not be seen as a substitute for immediate pulpectomy
which is now widely accepted as the ’standard of care’.

 Implications for research
The results of this systematic review confirm the necessity for
further larger sample and methodologically sound trials that can
help provide additional evidence as to whether antibiotics can
affect treatment outcomes for irreversible pulpitis.
Any future randomised controlled trials must be well-designed,
well-conducted, and adequately delivered with subsequent report-
ing, including high-quality descriptions of all aspects of methodol-
ogy. Reporting should conform to the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (http://www.consort-
statement.org/) which will enable appraisal and interpretation of
results, and accurate judgements to be made about the risk of bias,
and the overall quality of the evidence.
Although it is uncertain whether reported quality mirrors actual
study conduct, it is noteworthy that studies with unclear method-
ology have been shown to produce biased estimates of treatment
effects (Schulz 1995).
For further research recommendations based on the EPICOT
(evidence, population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and
time) format (Brown 2006), see Additional Table 4. However, it
may be more appropriate for future research to concentrate on
pain control rather than prescription of antibiotics.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Nagle 2000
Methods
Prospective randomised double-blind trial in the USA. Before the experiment, patient
groups (penicillin or placebo) were assigned by using 4-digit numbers from a random
number table. Only the random numbers were recorded on the data collection and
postoperative diary sheets to blind the experiment.
The medications were blinded, randomised, and packaged by a pharmacy
Participants
Adults: (40) 17 male, 23 female. Mean age and standard deviation (SD) in the penicillin
group 30 (9.8), placebo group 34 (11.6).
2 groups of 20: penicillin group 7 women and 13 men, placebo 16 women and 4 men
Inclusion criteria:
• participants in “good health”,
• clinical diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis (spontaneous moderate/severe pain),
• percussion sensitivity,
• tooth vital to electric pulp tester (EPT) and painful response to Endo Ice,
• radiographically widened periodontal ligament space.
Exclusion criteria:
• tooth not responsive to EPT,
• participants taking antibiotics or in the preceding 30 days.
Interventions
Oral penicillin or placebo control (lactose) and all patients received analgesics.
7-day oral dose 500 mg 6 hourly; penicillin (Penicillin VK; Wyeth Laboratories, Philadel-
phia, Pa) or a placebo control (lactose).
Analgesics: 600 mg ibuprofen (Motrin; HN Norton Co, Shreveport, La); paracetamol
(acetaminophen) with 30 mg of codeine (Tylenol No 3; McNeil Consumer Products,
Fort Washington, Pa)
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: between-group differences in sum of pain intensity difference (SPID)
, sum of pain percussion intensity difference (SPPID) and quantity of pain medications
taken
Notes
There were no withdrawals or drop-outs.
Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
Quote: “Before the experiment, patient
groups(penicillinorplacebo)were assigned
by using 4-digit numbers from a random
number table.”
Comment: Probably done.

(Continued)
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
Quote: “Only the random numbers were
recorded on the data collection and postop-
erative diary sheets to blind the experiment.
” “The medications were blinded, random-
ized, and packaged by a pharmacy.”
Comment: Central randomisation, proba-
bly done.
Blinding (performance bias and detection
bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Participants/healthcare providers:
Quote: “Each 500-mg gelatin capsule of
either penicillin or placebo was identical in
form. The 500-mg tablets of penicillin VK
were ground into a powder and placed into
the clear, unlabeled gelatin capsules. The
white powder of the lactose placebo was
indistinguishable from the white powder of
the penicillin tablets when viewed through
the capsule.”
Comment: Probably done.
Outcomes assessors and data analysts:
The outcomes were self assessed and as the
caregivers were blinded, this was probably
done
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Outcome data were complete for all of the
participants.
Comment: We judged this as at low risk of
bias.
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
No evidence of selective choice of data for
outcomes. Outcomes listed in the methods
section comparable to the reported results
Comment: We judged this as at low risk of
bias.
Other bias
Low risk
Quote: “Supported by research funding
from the Endodontic Graduate Student
Research Fund and the Steve Goldberg
Memorial Fund, The Ohio State Univer-
sity.”
Comment: Appears to be free of other bias.
