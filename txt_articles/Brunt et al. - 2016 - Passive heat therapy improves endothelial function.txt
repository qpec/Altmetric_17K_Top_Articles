Abstract The majority of cardiovascular diseases are characterized by disorders of the arteries,
predominantly caused by endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening. Intermittent hot water
immersion (‘heat therapy’) results in elevations in core temperature and changes in cardiovascular
haemodynamics, such as cardiac output and vascular shear stress, that are similar to exercise, and
thus may provide an alternative means of improving health which could be utilized by patients
with low exercise tolerance and/or capabilities. We sought to comprehensively assess the effects
of 8 weeks of heat therapy on biomarkers of vascular function in young, sedentary subjects.
Twenty young, sedentary subjects were assigned to participate in 8 weeks (4–5 times per week)
of heat therapy (n = 10; immersion in a 40.5°C bath sufficient to maintain rectal temperature
� 38.5°C for 60 min per session) or thermoneutral water immersion (n = 10; sham). Eight weeks
of heat therapy increased flow-mediated dilatation from 5.6 ± 0.3 to 10.9 ± 1.0% (P < 0.01) and
superficial femoral dynamic arterial compliance from 0.06 ± 0.01 to 0.09 ±0.01 mm2 mmHg−1
(P = 0.03), and reduced (i.e. improved) aortic pulse wave velocity from 7.1 ± 0.3 to 6.1 ± 0.3 m s−1
(P = 0.03), carotid intima media thickness from 0.43 ± 0.01 to 0.37 ± 0.01 mm (P < 0.001), and
mean arterial blood pressure from 83 ± 1 to 78 ± 2 mmHg (P = 0.02). No changes were observed
in the sham group or for carotid arterial compliance, superficial femoral intima media thickness or
endothelium-independent dilatation. Heat therapy improved endothelium-dependent dilatation,
arterial stiffness, intima media thickness and blood pressure, indicating improved cardiovascular
health. These data suggest heat therapy may provide a simple and effective tool for improving
cardiovascular health in various populations.

Introduction
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the number one cause of
death in the United States, accounting for over 30% of
deaths (Mozaffarianetal.2015).As such,thereis desperate
need for novel therapeutic tools for reducing CV risk. Heat
therapy in the form of hot baths and saunas has been
utilized for centuries, with reports of improved quality
of life and overall improved well-being (Beever, 2010),
but few studies have investigated the potential physio-
logical health benefits. Recently, a 30 year prospective
study revealed lifetime sauna use resulted in significantly
reduced incidence of CV-related mortality, sudden cardiac
death and all-cause mortality (Laukkanen et al. 2015);
however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits are
currently unknown.
The majority of CV diseases are characterized by
vascular dysfunction (Mozaffarian et al. 2015), including
impaired endothelial-dependent dilatation and arterial
stiffening. Heat exposure increases core temperature,
heart rate and contractility, redistribution of blood flow,
and changes in conduit vessel endothelial shear stress
(Johnson & Proppe, 2011), all of which are believed to
potentiate long-term improvements in vascular function.
Additionally, heat exposure induces the expression of
heat shock proteins (HSPs), which in turn stabilize a
variety of other proteins important to the CV system.
These include proteins which improve nitric oxide (NO)
signalling (Pritchard et al. 2001), reduce oxidative stress
(Baek et al. 2000) and reduce vascular inflammation
(Kim et al. 2005), all of which greatly influence vascular
function. Furthermore, it has been proposed that many
of the vascular benefits of exercise training are mediated
by increases in core temperature (Locke et al. 1990;
Rhind et al. 2004) and subsequent changes in cardiac
output and arterial shear stress (Tinken et al. 2010; Carter
et al. 2014a), suggesting that passive heat therapy may
induce long-term CV protective effects through similar
mechanisms.
Therefore, we investigated the effects of 8 weeks of
heat therapy on endothelial-dependent dilatation, arterial
stiffness, intima media thickness and blood pressure in
young, sedentary (otherwise healthy) individuals. This
is the first clinical trial to comprehensively investigate
the physiological benefits of long-term heat therapy in
humans. As such, we chose to study a non-patient
population in order to gather a thorough understanding
of the mechanisms by which heat therapy improves
vascular health. Since exercise training has profound
CV effects on sedentary individuals, we expected to
observe similar improvements with heat therapy. A
period of 8 weeks was chosen as studies in animals
have demonstrated > 4 weeks of passive heat exposure
are required to induce cellular adaptation (Horowitz,
2007). We hypothesized that, relative to thermoneutral
water immersion (sham), heat therapy would improve
endothelial-dependent dilatation, arterial stiffness, blood
pressure and intima media thickness (hereafter ‘wall
thickness’).
Methods
Ethical approval
All subjects provided oral and written informed consent
prior to participation in the study, as set forth by the
Declaration of Helsinki. All experimental procedures
were approved by the Institutional Review Board at
the University of Oregon. The study was registered as a
clinical trial at clinicaltrials.gov. Identifier: NCT02518399;
https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02518399?
term=heat+therapy&rank=1.
Subjects
Of the 76 subjects assessed for eligibility, 27 were enrolled
in the study (Fig. 1). All subjects were young (18–30
years of age), sedentary (<2 h of aerobic exercise per
week), healthy and non-smokers, and efforts were made
to include equal numbers of male and female sub-
jects. Subjects underwent a health screening and were
excluded if they had any history of CV-related diseases
or took prescription medications other than hormonal
contraceptives. Female subjects were required to provide
negative pregnancy tests prior to all experimental sessions,
measured using urine human chorionic gonadotropin.
Intervention
Subjects were assigned to participate in 8 weeks of heat
therapy (experimental group) or thermoneutral water
immersion (sham group). Due to the smaller cohort
size, subjects were not randomly assigned to groups, but
were instead assigned by investigators to match for sex,
age, height, weight and body mass index between the
two groups. Of the 27 subjects enrolled, 23 initiated
participation in the intervention. For both groups, sub-
jects reported to the laboratory 4–5 times per week, for a

total of 36 sessions across the 8 weeks. Studies took place
from December 2013 to August 2015. Although outside
temperatures varied greatly during this time, similar
numbers of subjects participated in the experimental and
sham groups in each season.
For heat therapy, subjects were immersed up to the
shoulder in a 40.5°C hot tub until rectal temperature (Tre)
reached 38.5°C, which took �25–30 min. Subjects then sat
up on a bench such that the water reached waist-level in
order to maintain Tre between 38.5 and 39.0°C for another
60 min (up to 90 min total in the tub). Following hot water
immersion, subjects were monitored for another 10 min,
or until Tre had fallen below 38.5°C.
Subjects in the sham group were immersed up to
the shoulder in a 36°C tub for 30 min and then to
waist-level for another 60 min in order to mimic the
same hydrostatic pressures as were experienced by sub-
jects in the heat therapy group, but without the heat
exposure. This water temperature was selected to match
meanbodytemperature,inordertominimizecore-to-skin
temperature gradients, and was successful at avoiding
any changes in rectal temperature > 0.2°C across the
90 min.
Core temperature was monitored using a sterile
rectal thermistor probe (YSI Series 400, Yellow Spring
Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) inserted �10 cm
past the anal sphincter. Heart rate was monitored via
chest strap (Polar; Lake Success, NY, USA). Prior to all
sessions, subjects provided a first-morning urine sample
to confirm euhydration via urine specific gravity < 1.02
(refractometer). If urine specific gravity was > 1.02, sub-
jects drank 5 ml kg−1 of water prior to entering the hot
tub. While in the tub, subjects drank water ad libitum. Dry
nude body weight was measured before and immediately
after sessions to calculate mean whole-body sweat rate,
after correcting for water intake. If subjects did not drink
enough water to compensate for sweat loss such that body
weight loss was > 1%, they drank additional fluids to make
up the difference prior to leaving the laboratory.
Outcome measures
Subjects in both groups reported to a temperature-
controlled laboratory before, every 2 weeks during
and immediately following the 8 week intervention
for experimental testing. All experimental sessions took

place at least 36 h after the previous heat therapy
session to ensure the chronic, rather than acute,
effects of heat therapy were being investigated. Prior
to all experimental days, subjects refrained from all
over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and
supplements, for 24 h, alcohol and caffeine for 12 h, food
for 4 h and heavy exercise for 24 h. Female subjects taking
hormonal contraceptives were always studied during the
active phase (n = 10). Naturally menstruating females
(n = 2) were studied in the same menstrual phase during
Weeks 0, 4 and 8 and during Weeks 2 and 6.
Upon arrival at the laboratory, subjects voided their
bladder and subjects’ height and weight were measured.
Subjects were instrumented with three-lead electro-
cardiogram (CardioCap; Datex Ohmeda, Louisville, CO,
USA), a blood pressure cuff on the left brachium, and
a finger cuff for measurement of beat-by-beat blood
pressure via photoplethysmography (Nexfin; BMEye,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Brachial blood pressure
was measured in triplicate following at least 20 min of
supine rest.
A
high-resolution
Doppler
ultrasound
(Terason
t3000cv; Teratech, Burlington, MA, USA) equipped with
10.0 MHz linear array ultrasound transducer probe was
used to image the common carotid, superficial femoral
and brachial arteries 1–2 cm distal to the carotid bulb,
2–3 cm distal to the femoral bifurcation and 9–16 cm
proximal to the antecubital fossa, respectively. Probe
placement (distances and angles) and subject position
(includinglimb–trunk angles)wererecorded and repeated
to ensure consistency between experimental sessions.
Doppler velocity was assessed using an insonation angle of
60 deg. Images were optimized using ultrasound contrast
controls which were consistent across experimental
days for each individual subject (Potter et al. 2008).
Ultrasound images were captured at 20 Hz using video
recording software (Camtasia) and were later analysed
for changes in arterial diameter and peak blood velocity
using custom-designed edge-detection and wall-tracking
software (DICOM; Perth, Australia).
Applanation
tonometry
(PCU-2000;
Millar,
Inc.,
Houston, TX, USA) was used to obtain arterial pressure
tracings from the common carotid and common femoral
arteries. All recordings were performed on the left
side of the body. Using this technique, the pulse wave
obtained is the same as intra-arterially recorded pressure
waves (Mackay et al. 1960). Tonometry tracings were
recorded using data acquisition software (Windaq; Dataq
Instruments, Akron, OH, USA).
Using the approaches described above, the following
measurements were obtained in this order.
Wall thickness. The common carotid artery was imaged
1–2 cm distal to the carotid bulb in three planes:
anterior, lateral and posterior. The superficial femoral
artery was imaged 2–3 cm distal to the femoral bifurcation
in two planes: anterior and lateral. Clearly demarcated
intimal–medial boundaries were obtained while focusing
onthefarwall.Imageswerefrozenindiastoleandenlarged,
and calipers were used to make three repeat measurements
of the wall thickness from the lumen–intima interface to
themedia–adventitiainterface.Measurements(threefrom
each angle) were averaged.
Dynamic arterial compliance and β-stiffness. Concurrent
ultrasound images and tonometry pressure tracings were
obtained from contralateral common carotid and super-
ficial femoral arteries. Ultrasound data were analysed for
mean arterial diameter (D) and changes in diameter from
trough diastolic to peak systolic (�D) for each cardiac
cycle. Diastolic and mean arterial pressures obtained via
tonometry were calibrated to values obtained via brachial
oscillation, and pulse pressure (�P) was calculated as
systolic (SBP) minus diastolic (DBP) pressures. Dynamic
cross-sectional arterial compliance and β-stiffness index
were calculated for each cardiac cycle using the following
equations and averaged across at least 20 cardiac cycles.
dynamic arterial compliance =[(�D/
D)/2�P]∗ πD2 (1)
β-stiffness index = Ln (SBP/DBP)∗ D/�D
(2)
Pulse wave velocity. Tonometry pressure tracings were
obtained concurrently from the common carotid and
ipsilateral common femoral artery. Time delays between
pressure tracings were calculated using the upswing of the
pressure tracing (Asmar et al. 1995). Pulse wave velocity
was calculated as the direct distance between the probes
divided by the time delay, averaged over at least 20 cardiac
cycles.
Flow-mediated
dilatation
(FMD)
and
post-occlusive
reactive hyperaemia (PORH). FMD and PORH were
measured in accordance with previously published
guidelines (Corretti et al. 2002; Thijssen et al. 2011).
Subjects lay supine with their right arm extended to
80–90 deg at heart level. An inflatable occlusion cuff
was placed 0–2 cm distal to the antecubital fossa and
inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 min (E20 Rapid Cuff Inflater,
D. E. Hokanson, Bellevue, WA, USA). Brachial artery
diameter and blood velocity were measured via Doppler
ultrasonography for 1 min of baseline prior to cuff
inflation and for 3 min following release of the cuff.
Following release, brachial artery blood flow and therefore
shear stress increases, resulting in dilatation of the artery
which reaches a peak approximately 40–90 s after cuff
release(Blacketal.2008;Thijssenetal.2011).Immediately
following the test, ultrasound scans were analysed using
the wall-tracking software and FMD was calculated as
the per cent change in diameter from baseline to peak

dilatation following occlusion. In the event that the first
FMD was considered non-physiological (i.e. the tissue
moved during occlusion and did not return to the same
position after release), the test was repeated at least 20 min
after the first FMD. Subjects remained supine during this
rest period.
The shear stimulus responsible for eliciting dilatation
was calculated as area under the curve above baseline
shear rate from the time of release to peak dilatation
(SRAUC). FMD was then normalized for shear stimulus
by dividing FMD by SRAUC, as described and validated
previously (Pyke & Tschakovsky, 2005; Padilla et al.
2009).
To characterize the PORH response, blood velocity
and diameter were averaged across cardiac cycles and
used to calculate forearm vascular conductance (FVC) as
(peak blood velocity/2) × vessel cross-sectional area (from
diameter)/mean arterial pressure (MAP). Beat-by-beat
FVC values were zero-hold interpolated to 5 Hz. Peak
PORH was determined as the peak FVC following release
of the occlusion (usually in the range of 3–10 s after
cuff release). Area under the curve (AUC) PORH was
calculated as the integral of FVC values above base-
line FVC (average FVC across the 1 min baseline) until
return to baseline (usually 120–180 s after cuff release).
Due to higher variability in 0 week PORH values across
subjects, data are presented as fold changes across the
8 weeks.

following
administration of 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerine
(Nitrolingual; Sciele Pharma, Atlanta, GA, USA), which

of

arteries.
Endothelium-independent dilatation was calculated as
the per cent change in diameter from baseline to peak
dilatation following nitroglycerine administration.
Statistics
Subject characteristics were compared across groups using
Student’s unpaired two-tailed t test. All other outcome
variables were compared across groups and time into heat
therapy or thermoneutral water immersion using two-way
2 × 5 mixed design analysis of variance. When significant
main effects of time into heat therapy or significant
group × time interactions were detected, significant
differences between paired variables across time were
determined using Bonferroni’s post hoc test.
To determine whether changes in arterial stiffness were
related to changes in endothelial function, we compared
changes from 0 to 8 weeks in FMD and shear-corrected
FMD to changes in carotid and superficial femoral arterial
compliance and β-stiffness index and aortic pulse wave
velocity using Pearson’s product moment correlation.
Statistical significance was set to α = 0.05. Data are
presented as means ± SEM.
Results
Subjects
Of the 23 subjects who initiated the heat therapy or
sham protocol, 20 completed the full 8 weeks (n = 10
in each group). Data from subjects who dropped out of
the study partway have been excluded. Subjects were well
matched across groups for age, height, weight, body mass
index and the distribution of males vs females (Table 1).
Subjects tolerated heat therapy well. There were some
reports of light-headedness during the initial 20–30 min
of full immersion, but these only occurred during the
first 1–3 days of exposure. Heat therapy resulted in sub-
stantial elevations in Tre and heart rate; by contrast,
no changes in Tre or heart rate were observed during
thermoneutral water immersion (Table 1). As subjects
became heat-acclimatized, average Tre across the entire
90 min session was significantly lower at 8 weeks vs

0 weeks (P < 0.01). However, time spent �38.5°C was
held consistent across all sessions at 60 min.
Endothelial-dependent dilatation
For FMD, there were significant main effects of both group
(P = 0.002) and time into heat therapy (P < 0.001),
as well as a significant group × time interaction effect
(P = 0.003). We observed a robust improvement in FMD
with heat therapy, which was significantly elevated by
2 weeks (P = 0.015 vs 0 weeks within heat therapy
group). FMD then decreased back to baseline at 4 weeks
(P = 0.64 vs 0 weeks), but continued to increase afterwards
through 6 and 8 weeks (Fig. 2). No changes were observed
in the sham group at any time point. FMD corrected for
the shear rate stimulus continually increased across the
8 weeks of heat therapy (group × time: P = 0.003; time
main effect: P = 0.001; group main effect: P = 0.01),
with no dip at the 4 week time point (Table 2), and was
significantly different from the sham group at all time
points into the intervention (Weeks 2–8). We observed
a significant group × time interaction of heat therapy
on SRAUC (P = 0.02), but no significant main effects of
group (P = 0.11) or time (P = 0.08). The only pairwise
difference in SRAUC occurred between 4 and 6 weeks into
heat therapy (P = 0.04, 4 vs 6 weeks within group).
No changes were observed in baseline brachial artery
diameter (group × time: P = 0.43; time main effect:
P = 0.70; group main effect: P = 0.63). There was no
effect of heat therapy or thermoneutral water immersion
onendothelium-independentdilatationacrossthe8weeks
(group × time: P = 0.24; time: P = 0.76; group: P = 0.83)
(Table 2).
Post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia
We observed a significant main effect of time into heat
therapy (P = 0.003) on AUC PORH and a significant
group × time interaction (P = 0.047), but no significant
main effect of group (P = 0.66). Within the heat therapy
group, heat therapy significantly increased AUC PORH
by 6 weeks (P = 0.004 vs 0 weeks) (Table 2), while no
changes were observed in the sham group. We observed a
significant main effect of time on peak PORH (P = 0.04);
however, there was no significant main effect of group
(P = 0.56) or interaction of group × time (P = 0.39),
and as such we cannot conclude the changes we observed
across time were attributable to heat therapy.
Arterial stiffness
There was no effect of heat therapy or themoneutral water
immersion on carotid artery dynamic arterial compliance
(group × time: P = 0.10; time: P = 0.30; group: P = 0.21)
or β-stiffness index (group × time: P = 0.41; time:
P = 0.41; group: P = 0.61). However, there were significant
main effects of time into heat therapy and group × time
interactive effects of heat therapy on dynamic arterial
compliance (group × time: P = 0.03; time: P = 0.01;
group: P = 0.08) and β-stiffness index (group × time:

from baseline by 4 weeks into heat therapy (P = 0.02 vs
0 weeks), while β-stiffness index became significantly
reduced from baseline by 8 weeks (P = 0.03 vs 0 weeks).
Heat therapy also reduced carotid–femoral pulse wave

In data pooled across subjects in both groups, changes
in superficial femoral dynamic arterial compliance
were significantly positively correlated with changes in
shear-corrected FMD (r = 0.58, P < 0.01) and tended to be
correlated with changes in FMD presented as a percentage
change from baseline diameter (r = 0.39, P = 0.09). No

significantly by 8 weeks (P = 0.003 vs 0 weeks within heat

group: P = 0.23), but had no effect on superficial femoral
artery wall thickness (group × time: P = 0.26; time:

different between the groups, we did observe a significant

but there was no significant group × time interaction

Discussion
In the present study, we sought to determine the effects
of 8 weeks of passive heat therapy in young, sedentary
individuals. Our major findings were that passive heat
therapy results in robust and clinically relevant increases
in endothelium-dependent dilatation and reductions in
arterial stiffness, wall thickness and blood pressure. All
these variables continually improved across the 8 weeks

This is the first study to comprehensibly investigate the
physiological effects of long-term whole-body passive heat
therapy in human subjects. Our results suggest that these
improvements in vascular function probably underlie the
reduced incidence of CV disease and all-cause mortality
associated with lifelong heat therapy.

endothelial function, which is primarily dependent on
NO (Joannides et al. 1995) and highly correlated with

function in the brachial artery has been shown to parallel
that in the coronary arteries (Anderson et al. 1995), adding
to its prognostic value. In the present study, we observed
a robust improvement in FMD by the first time-point
into heat therapy (2 weeks), consistent with previous
studies investigating the effects of 2 weeks of infrared
sauna therapy in patients with elevated CV risk (Imamura
et al. 2001; Kihara et al. 2002). By the end of the 8 weeks,
FMD had increased by 5.31%, which represents a sub-
stantial improvement in vascular health, as improvements
of just 2% have been correlated with a 15% reduction
in CV risk (Yeboah et al. 2009). These findings are in
contrast to those observed following 8 weeks of three
timesperweeklegheating,inwhichFMDwassignificantly
improved by 4 weeks, but had returned back to baseline
values by 8 weeks (Carter et al. 2014a). However, core
temperature only reached �38.0°C per session in that
study, perhaps demonstrating the importance of reaching
a higher threshold core temperature. Our findings also
contrast with exercise training studies, in which early
improvements in FMD typically resolve and return back
towards baseline values by 8 weeks (Tinken et al. 2008),
suggesting heat therapy may offer a more robust stimulus
for endothelial adaptation.
Heat therapy results in repeated episodic elevations
in core temperature and perfusion, both of which
may upregulate NO-dependent dilatation and therefore
improve FMD. HSPs, which are activated by acute bouts
of heat stress and are chronically increased following heat
acclimation (McClung et al. 2008), directly improve NO
signalling. For example, association of Hsp90 with end-
othelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is essential for eNOS
activation and NO production (Pritchard et al. 2001).
Thus, increases in Hsp90 expression result in enhanced
NOS activity independent of total eNOS expression
(Harris et al. 2008). Repeated episodes of increased shear
rate, as occurs due to elevated blood flow during heat
stress, have also been shown to increase FMD (Tinken et al.
2010). Furthermore, shear stress is known to upregulate
transcription of HSPs, independently of elevations in
temperature (Brooks et al. 2002). Importantly, limiting
increases in shear with an arm cuff during 8 weeks of
repeated leg heating prevented brachial artery FMD from
improving over time (Carter et al. 2014a), demonstrating
that elevations in shear, either alone or in combination
withelevationsincoretemperature,areessentialtoarterial
adaptation.
We also evaluated the reactive hyperaemia response,
which is a common test of microvascular function and an
independentpredictoroffutureCVevents(Andersonetal.
2011; Lind et al. 2011). Furthermore, the shear stimulus,
and therefore FMD, are dependent on PORH and base-
line diameter. Although we did not observe any significant
change in baseline brachial artery diameter, heat therapy
did improve AUC PORH at the 6 and 8 week time points.
However, as we observed improvements in FMD as early
as 2 weeks into heat therapy despite no changes in baseline
diameter or PORH, we can conclude these improvements
represent augmented vasodilator function of the brachial
artery. The prolonged downstream vasodilatation that
occurs following release of arterial occlusion is thought to
be the combined result of myogenic responses and release
of metabolic vasodilators, including adenosine, adenosine
diphosphate, prostanoids and NO (Carlsson et al. 1987;
Meredith et al. 1996; Bank et al. 2000). Although we did
not investigate the mechanisms in the present study, it
is likely that increases in PORH with heat therapy were
caused by HSP- and shear stress-induced improvements
in NO-dependent dilatation, as described above.
Lastly,
we

any
changes
in
endothelium-independent dilatation to nitroglycerine
administration across the 8 weeks of heat therapy. Thus,
improvements in FMD can be attributed to changes in the
brachial artery endothelium rather than changes in the
response of the underlying vascular smooth muscle to an
NO stimulus.
Arterial stiffness
Arterial stiffness is an independent risk factor for CV
disease (Laurent et al. 2001; van Popele et al. 2001;
Boutouyrie et al. 2002), and increased arterial stiffness
is often accompanied by atherosclerosis, left ventricular
hypertrophy and increased incidence of vascular events
(Agabiti-Rosei & Muiesan, 2007). We assessed three
different measures, all validated for their abilities to pre-
dict CV morbidity and mortality (van Popele et al. 2001;
Boutouyrie et al. 2002; Mohammed et al. 2013). With heat
therapy, superficial femoral arterial compliance increased,
femoral β-stiffness index decreased and aortic pulse wave
velocity decreased, all indicating reduced arterial stiffness.
Furthermore, all these improvements were of a great
enough magnitude to be considered clinically relevant,
which is compelling given we studied a young, healthy
population, albeit a sedentary one. Consistent with our
results, previous studies have demonstrated a reduction
in arterial stiffness with acute passive heat stress (Ganio
et al. 2011) and following 8 weeks of Bikram (hot) yoga
(Hunter et al. 2013).
Arterial stiffness can be impacted by a variety of factors,
including elastic fibre degeneration, increased collagen
content, structural changes to the arteries (e.g. vascular
smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia), and
impaired endothelial function (Oliver & Webb, 2003),
several of which were probably affected by heat therapy.
HSPs are known to inhibit smooth muscle cell hyper-
plasia and hypertrophy (Connolly et al. 2003; Zheng
et al. 2006), to reduce oxidative stress (Baek et al. 2000)
and to reduce vascular inflammation (Kim et al. 2005).
Improved NO bioavailability and endothelial function (by

the above-mentioned mechanisms) also reduce arterial
stiffness(Wilkinsonetal.2002),andindeedimprovements
in superficial femoral arterial compliance were correlated
with improvements in shear-corrected FMD. Sympathetic
nervous activity has been shown to increase stiffness
(Boutouyrie et al. 1994). Resting sympathetic activity
is lower in the summer than in the winter despite no
difference in body or room temperature at the time of
testing (Niimi et al. 1999), although it is unknown whether
heat therapy would have similar effects.
Lastly, blood pressure is well known to affect the
visco-elastic properties of the arterial wall. As blood
pressure is reduced, compliance increases. In the pre-
sent study, we observed a reduction in diastolic and
mean arterial blood pressure. For this reason, we chose
to calculate β-stiffness index, which is less dependent
on changes in blood pressure. In the carotid artery, we
observed no change in β-stiffness index with heat therapy,
suggesting that improvements in compliance were likely
to be the result of reductions in blood pressure. However,
both compliance and β-stiffness index were significantly
improved in the superficial femoral artery. The super-
ficial femoral artery is a more muscular artery than the
carotid and, as such, may be more affected by nervous
activity, hormones or locally produced vasoactive sub-
stances, such as NO (Bank et al. 1995). In support of this
notion, changes in superficial femoral arterial compliance,
but not carotid arterial compliance, were correlated with
changes in endothelial function. It is possible we were
able to better observe the effects of heat therapy on
the arteries in the superficial femoral compared to the
more elastic carotid and aorta. Our results also demon-
strate the importance of assessing arterial stiffness at more
than one artery and using more than one method as each
has limitations (O’Rourke et al. 2002).
Wall thickness
We observed a significant reduction in carotid artery wall
thickness, but observed no such changes in the superficial
femoral artery. This is especially interesting in light of
opposite effects of heat therapy on arterial stiffness (i.e.
heat therapy reduced stiffness in the superficial femoral
artery, but not in the carotid artery). In addition to the
development of atherosclerotic lesions, which begin in
childhood as fatty streaks and progress up to fibrous
plaques later in life (Holman et al. 1958), arterial wall
thickening can be affected by structural changes in the
arteries, inflammation and changes in haemodynamics,
such as changes in shear stress (Bots et al. 1997) and
blood pressure (Oren et al. 2003; Breton et al. 2011).
Although these latter factors can all be affected by heat
stress, as described previously, they can also affect arterial
stiffness. Given that we observed a reduction in carotid
wall thickness with heat therapy but no change in carotid
arterial stiffness, it is possible that heat therapy did indeed
partially reverse the progression of atherosclerosis. An
alternative explanation is that some structural changes
in the arteries occurred to a great enough extent for us to
detect changes in wall thickness, but these changes were
not great enough to detect changes in arterial stiffness.
Interestingly, we observed no change in superficial femoral
artery wall thickness. However, atherosclerotic lesions are
most likely to occur just proximal to arterial bifurcations
due to the turbulent flow (Glagov et al. 1988), and
so the prevalence of lesions is considerably lower in
the superficial femoral artery (just distal to the femoral
bifurcation) compared to the much greater prevalence in
the common carotid artery (just proximal to the carotid
bifurcation).
Blood pressure
We observed significant reductions in diastolic and mean
arterial blood pressure with heat therapy. Although the
magnitude of these reductions was only �4 mmHg,
increases of 10 mmHg in diastolic pressure (or increases of
20mmHginsystolicpressure)areassociatedwithtwo-fold
increases in CV-related mortality, even in individuals as
young as 40 years (Lewington et al. 2002). We expect
the effects of heat therapy on blood pressure would be
even greater in a (pre-)hypertensive population. Although
exercise is considered a primary treatment for hyper-
tension, exercise training generally has little or no effect
on blood pressure in young individuals. Given that heat
therapy is capable of lowering blood pressure even in
young,normotensiveindividuals,heattherapy(orexercise
combined with heat therapy) could prove more powerful
than exercise alone as a treatment for hypertension.
Thermoneutral water immersion
Acute thermoneutral water immersion has previously
been shown to induce changes in CV haemodynamics,
such as increased cardiac output and mean arterial blood
pressure (Arborelius et al. 1972), changes in conduit vessel
diameter (Carter et al. 2014b), and increased arterial
compliance (Boussuges, 2006). As such, we thought a
true sham group which underwent chronic thermoneutral
water immersion was necessary to isolate the effects of
repeated rises in core temperature in the experimental
group.
We selected a water temperature of 36°C to match mean
body temperature and therefore minimize core-to-skin
temperature gradients. We were successful in preventing
changes in core temperature in sham subjects, with no
greater than ±0.2°C changes in Tre from resting in any
session. However, as mean skin temperature is typically
closer to 33°C, subjects may have experienced some
cutaneous vasodilatation during thermoneutral water

immersion sessions, resulting in minor changes in blood
flow and shear rate. Additionally, by having subjects in
a seated position in the tub, we minimized hydrostatic
effects on blood flow and cardiac output redistribution.
Regardlessofanyacutechanges,weobservednolong-term
adaptation in sham subjects.
Conclusions and perspectives
The present study demonstrates that passive heat
therapy is capable of inducing robust improvements in
vascular health, even in sedentary, young (otherwise
healthy) individuals. Furthermore, the magnitude of
improvements in vascular function and blood pressure
observed in the present study was similar to what is
typically observed in young, healthy, sedentary subjects
with exercise training (Cameron & Dart, 1994; Clarkson
et al. 1999; Tinken et al. 2008), and in some cases,
even greater (e.g. FMD). As such, similarly to exercise
training, improved endothelial function and reduced
arterial stiffness and blood pressure probably underlie the
CV-protective effects of lifelong heat therapy observed
by Laukkanen et al. (2015). As we believe elevations
in body core temperature and subsequent increases in
vascular shear stress underlie vascular adaptations, we
presume lifelong effects of both sauna bathing and hot
water immersion would impart similar CV protective
effects so long as similar core temperatures are attained.
Indeed, a study which compared acute far infrared sauna
bathing to acute hot water immersion in heart failure
patients found that the only difference between the two
heating modalities in regard to CV haemodynamics was
that hot water immersion increased intracardiac pre-
ssures secondary to increased hydrostatic pressure acting
on the submerged portion of the body – changes in
stroke volume, cardiac output, vascular resistance and
ejection fraction were similar between the two (Tei et al.
1995). The core temperature stimulus we used in the pre-
sent study was similar to that found to be associated
with the greatest reduction in CV risk with lifelong
sauna use by Laukkanen et al. (2015), a frequency of
4–7 times per week for > 19 min per session. Rectal
temperature has been reported to increase by about
�1.0°C in 30 min in heat-adapted individuals in Finnish
saunas with air temperatures of 80°C (Lepp¨
aluoto et al.
1986). As air temperatures are typically in the range
80–100°C in Finnish saunas, we expect peak increases in
rectal temperature ranges from 1.0 to 1.5°C in individuals
sauna bathing for > 19 min per session. However, an
important point made by the findings of Laukkanen et al.
(2015) is that less frequent and shorter duration bouts of
heat therapy may also have CV-protective effects, albeit
to a lesser extent. Therefore, studies like ours addressing
whether smaller ‘doses’ of heat therapy are also effective
are warranted.
Lastly, many disease states are characterized by impaired
vascular function. While exercise is arguably the best
‘medicine’ for these patients, many of them are unable
or unwilling to exercise at an extent great enough to
induce protective adaptations (e.g. spinal cord injured,
heart failure and diabetic patients). The present study
suggests passive heat therapy may provide a powerful
alternative means of reducing CV risk and mortality across
a broad range of patient populations.
