Summary
Objective: To compare the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges
with zinc gluconate lozenges in common cold treatment
and to examine the dose-dependency of the effect.
Design: Meta-analysis.
Setting: Placebo-controlled zinc lozenge trials, in which the
zinc dose was > 75 mg/day. The pooled effect of zinc
lozenges on common cold duration was calculated by
using inverse-variance random-effects method.
Participants: Seven randomised trials with 575 participants
with naturally acquired common colds.
Main outcome measure: Duration of the common cold.
Results: The mean common cold duration was 33% (95%
CI 21% to 45%) shorter for the zinc groups of the seven
included trials. Three trials that used lozenges composed of
zinc acetate found that colds were shortened by 40% and
four trials that used zinc gluconate by 28%. The difference
between the two salts was not significant: 12 percentage
points (95% CI: �12 to þ 36). Five trials used zinc doses of
80–92 mg/day, common cold duration was reduced by 33%,
and two trials used zinc doses of 192–207 mg/day and
found an effect of 35%. The difference between the high-
dose and low-dose zinc trials was not significant: 2 percent-
age points (95% CI: �29 to þ 32).
Conclusions: Properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges
may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges. There is no
evidence that zinc doses over 100 mg/day might lead to
greater efficacy in the treatment of the common cold.
Common cold patients may be encouraged to try zinc
lozenges for treating their colds. The optimal lozenge
composition and dosage scheme need to be investigated
further.

Background
Interest in zinc lozenges for the treatment of the
common cold arose when the common cold symp-
toms of a 3-year-old girl with leukaemia disappeared
within a few hours after she had slowly dissolved a
therapeutic zinc tablet in her mouth instead of
immediately swallowing it as instructed.1 The benefit
seemed to be obtained from the slow dissolution of
the tablet in her mouth, which implied that zinc has
local effects in the pharyngeal region. This observa-
tion prompted the father of the child, George Eby, to
conduct the first randomised double-blind placebo-
controlled trial on zinc lozenges. Eby et al.1 used
zinc gluconate lozenges, providing 207 mg/day of
elemental zinc, and they significantly shortened the
duration of colds.
A series of zinc lozenge trials have been carried out
since Eby’s study but with varying results, which
could be partly ascribed to the seven-fold variation
in the daily dosage of elemental zinc in those trials.2
The composition of the zinc lozenges between the
trials also differed as some lozenges contained sub-
stances that tightly bind zinc, which prevented the
release of zinc ions. The variation in the levels of
free zinc ions in the oro-pharyngeal region has been
proposed as a factor that might explain the wide
divergence between those results.3–9 Eby hypothesised
that zinc acetate might be a better constituent for
lozenges than zinc gluconate, since acetate binds
zinc ions less strongly.7,8 Nevertheless, it is not clear
whether the difference between acetate and gluconate
has practical importance at the clinical level.
A previous meta-analysis showed that five low-
dose
trials
of
zinc
lozenges
(<75 mg/day
zinc)
uniformly found no effect on the duration of colds.
Three high-dose (>75 mg/day) zinc acetate trials
found a 42% reduction in the duration of colds,
whereas five high-dose zinc gluconate trials found
just a 20% reduction in cold duration. Such a differ-
ence was consistent with Eby’s proposal; however,
there was significant heterogeneity in the five high-
dose zinc gluconate studies but not in the three
high-dose zinc acetate studies.2 Thus, there may be
factors that could confound the comparison of the
efficacy of zinc acetate and zinc gluconate.
Although the zinc lozenges dissolved in the oro-
pharyngeal region led to the highest zinc levels in

 that region, a meta-analysis found no evidence that
zinc acetate lozenges have a greater effect on cold
symptoms that originate in lower anatomical regions
compared with those of the nasal region.10 Another
meta-analysis of zinc acetate trials found that there
was no difference in the efficacy by gender, age, eth-
nic background, or smoking.11 Further systematic
reviews on zinc and the common cold have been pub-
lished,12–14 but some of them have methodological
problems,15–17 and a Cochrane review was recently
withdrawn.18
The goal of this meta-analysis was to compare zinc
acetate and zinc gluconate in their efficacy in the
treatment of the common cold, and to examine the
dose-response relationship between the daily dose of
elemental zinc and the efficacy of zinc lozenges in
treating the common cold.
Methods
Selection of the trials
This meta-analysis was restricted to placebo-con-
trolled trials on zinc lozenges for patients with natur-
ally acquired common cold infections in which the
zinc dosage was >75 mg/day. Previous searches of
the literature2,8,12–14 identified eight trials that fulfilled
these search criteria.1,19–25 Turner25 published a trial
of three zinc arms: two arms used zinc acetate
<75 mg/day
and
one
arm
used
zinc
gluconate
>75 mg/day; only the latter was included in this
meta-analysis. The methods and characteristics of
the eight trials are shown in Supplementary file 1.
No additional zinc lozenge trials were found by
searching PubMed and Scopus using the free search
terms ‘zinc’ and ‘lozenge*’ (15 November 2016).
The lozenge of the Smith et al. trial19 contained
mannitol and sorbitol.9 There is experimental evi-
dence that mannitol and sorbitol bind zinc ions in
the presence of saliva,9 which may explain the nega-
tive findings in the Smith et al. trial. Furthermore,
Dr Smith was one of the authors of the Godfrey
et al.20 trial, which stated in its introduction (p.235)
that ‘it has been demonstrated that . . . mannitol/sorb-
itol inactivate zinc by chelation in saliva’ and ‘man-
nitol/sorbitol [zinc lozenge] formulations release no
zinc ions when dissolved in the mouth’ referring to
the Smith et al. trial.19 This indicates that afterwards
Dr Smith did not trust the lozenge formulation of his
1989 trial. Therefore, the Smith et al. trial was
excluded from the current analysis.
There are no studies that directly compare high-
dose zinc acetate lozenges versus high-dose zinc glu-
conate lozenges head-to-head. In addition, there are
no studies that compared the same salt by using
different doses in the high-dose range. The compari-
sons in this analysis are indirect.
Outcomes and extraction of data
The outcome in this meta-analysis was the duration
of colds. The data reported by Eby et al.,1 Mossad
et al.,21 and Turner25 had censored observations that
had been previously imputed.2 This study used the
mean values and standard deviations for the Eby
and the Turner trials based on those previously
imputed data.2 The Mossad et al. data were reana-
lysed for this study leading to small differences com-
pared with the previous imputation (Supplementary
file 2, p. 7). The duration of the longest cold symptom
was used as the outcome for the Petrus et al. trial22;
Dr Petrus kindly made available the dataset of
his trial.
Statistical methods
Variation in the recorded cold durations between dif-
ferent patient groups can be caused by differences in
the distributions of viruses over time and by differ-
ences
in
the
operational
outcome
definitions.
Therefore, the relative effect of zinc lozenges on the
common cold duration was calculated in percentages
because the relative effect adjusts for variations
between the patient groups and outcome definitions26
(see
transformation
to
the
relative
scale
in
Supplementary file 2).
The pooled effects of zinc lozenges on common
cold duration were calculated by using the inverse-
variance random-effects option of the RevMan pro-
gram.27
Heterogeneity
between
the
studies
and
subgroups was assessed by Cochran Q test (the
�2-test) and the I2-statistic.28 The I2-statistic estimates
the percentage of total variation across studies that is
due to true heterogeneity rather than due to chance.
Values of I2 greater than about 75% indicate a high
level of heterogeneity. The 95% CI for the difference
between the estimates was calculated by summing the
variances of the subgroup estimates.
Results
Seven zinc lozenge trials with natural common cold
infections that had administered >75 mg/day of elem-
ental zinc were included in this meta-analysis. The
zinc doses ranged from 80 to 207 mg/day, with three
trials using zinc acetate22–24 and four using zinc glu-
conate.1,20,21,25 All the identified trials were rando-
mised, placebo-controlled, and double-blind. Their
characteristics are described in Supplementary file 1.
There were 575 participants among the seven trials.

 The effect of zinc lozenges on common cold dur-
ation in the seven included trials, and the pooled
effects for zinc acetate and zinc gluconate trials
are shown in Figure 1. The pooled estimate over the
seven included trials indicates a reduction in the
common cold duration by 33% (95% CI 21% to
45%). The estimate of zinc acetate indicates a 40%
(95% CI 31% to 50%) and the estimate of zinc glu-
conate indicates a 28% (95% CI 6% to 50%) reduc-
tion in common cold duration. There is no difference
in the estimates of effect between the two subgroups,
with I2¼ 0% (p ¼ 0.3). The difference between zinc
acetate trials and zinc gluconate trials is 12 percentage
points (95% CI: � 12 to þ 36); thus, the two salts do
not differ significantly. Therefore, the pooled estimate
of 33% for all the seven trials appears to be a valid
estimate for both zinc acetate and zinc gluconate
lozenges.
Analysis of the dose-dependency between the daily
elemental zinc level and the effect of the lozenges is
shown in Figure 2. The thick horizontal line indicates
the pooled effect and the thick vertical line shows its
95% CI. Five trials used zinc doses from 80 to 92 mg/
day and found a mean 33% (95% CI 18% to 48%)
reduction in common cold duration. Two trials used
substantially higher doses of zinc, 192 and 207 mg/
day, with a pooled estimate of 35% (95% CI 8% to
61%) reduction in common cold duration. There is
no difference in the estimates of effect between the
low-dose and high-dose trials, with I2¼ 0% (p ¼ 0.9)
(see Supplementary file 2). The difference between the
high dose and the low-dose zinc trials is 2 percentage
points (95% CI: �29 to þ 32). Thus, the pooled esti-
mate of 33% for all the seven trials appears to be a
reasonable estimate of the efficacy of zinc lozenges
over the dose range that has been tested. Such an
effect seems to be reached with doses of 80 to
92 mg/day of zinc. So far, there is no evidence that
doses higher than 100 mg/day of elemental zinc might
lead to greater benefits.
When all the seven trials are included in the meta-
analysis, there is very strong evidence of heterogen-
eity over the trials with I2¼ 77% (p ¼ 0.0003). This
high level heterogeneity is accounted for by the
Turner trial25 (Figures 1 and 2). If the Turner trial
is excluded as an outlier, the level of heterogeneity
decreases to I2¼ 39% (p ¼ 0.15). When the Turner
trial is excluded, the difference between zinc acetate
and zinc gluconate trials shrinks to 2 percentage
points (95% CI �17 to 21), and the difference
Figure 1. Effect of high-dose zinc lozenges on the duration of the common cold. Trials with zinc acetate are separated from trials
with zinc gluconate. The duration of symptoms was transformed to the relative scale, thus the duration in the respective placebo
group was given the value of 100%. The estimate of effect over all seven trials indicates a 33% (95% CI: 21% to 45%) reduction in
common cold duration. The high level of heterogeneity among all the seven trials (I2¼ 77%; p ¼ 0.0003) is explained by the Turner
trial. If the Turner trial is excluded, there is no significant heterogeneity over the remaining six trials (I2¼ 39%; p ¼ 0.15), see
Supplementary file 2. In the forest plots on the right hand side, the vertical line indicates the placebo level. The horizontal lines

 between the high-dose and low-dose trials increases to
7 (95% CI �20 to þ35) percentage points; neither of
these differences is significant. If the Turner trial is
excluded, the estimated effect of zinc lozenges based
on the remaining six trials increases to 40% (95% CI
31% to 47%) reduction in common cold duration (see
Supplementary file 2 for the forest plots).
The dose-dependency in Figure 2 was analysed by
the total daily dose of elemental zinc. However, the
total daily dose of zinc has two components: (1) the
amount of zinc per lozenge and (2) the number of zinc
lozenges dissolved in the mouth per day. Both of
them are independent variables. Figure 3 shows
these two components for the seven trials which
were used to calculate the estimated 33% reduction
in cold duration. The dose of elemental zinc per
lozenge ranged from 9 to 23.7 mg, and the average
frequency of lozenge use ranged from 6 to 9.9 times
per day.
Discussion
Eby considered the chemical properties of zinc acetate
and zinc gluconate and proposed that the acetate
might be a better constituent for zinc lozenges than
the gluconate.7,8 The first goal of this study was to
carry out a meta-analysis to compare the two zinc
salts. The comparison of three zinc acetate trials
against four zinc gluconate trials did not find a
meaningful difference between the two salts in their
effects on common cold duration (Figure 1). The
second goal of this study was to analyse the dose-
dependency of zinc lozenge effect by the total daily
dose of elemental zinc. No evidence was found that
doses higher than 80–92 mg/day of zinc might cause
greater effects (Figure 2). Thus, it seems that the max-
imal effects of zinc lozenges may be reached by doses
of some 80 mg/day, if the lozenge composition is opti-
mal, i.e. the lozenge does not contain substances that
bind zinc.
Zinc ion can form complexes with a number of
substances, which has caused substantial problems
with the lozenge formulations in a few trials. Farr
et al.29 used a lozenge that contained 2% citric acid,
which binds zinc ions and very little or no free zinc is
released from such lozenges.3,4,6–9 The low-dose
(<75 mg/day)
zinc
lozenges
studied
by
Douglas
et al.30 contained tartaric acid and sodium bicarbon-
ate, which bind zinc ions.7,8 The Turner trial25 had
two low-dose zinc acetate trial arms. The zinc acetate
lozenges contained hydrogenated palm-kernel oil,
cotton-seed oil, and soy lecithin, and Eby pointed
out that most probably those substances formed
insoluble reaction products with zinc at the high prep-
aration temperatures used in the production.31 These
concerns were not refuted by Turner. Finally, the first
author of the Smith et al. study19 stated in a 1992
paper that the negative findings of the Smith et al.
study most probably were explained by the presence
of mannitol and sorbitol in the lozenges.20 The nega-
tive findings of the above studies were thus explained
by flaws in the composition of the zinc lozenges.

 Evidently, problems in lozenge formulation cannot be
compensated for by appropriate methodology at the
level of randomisation and blinding. Furthermore,
problems in lozenge formulation can lead to false
negative conclusions about the potential effects of
zinc lozenges but cannot lead to false positive
conclusions.
The divergence between the Turner trial25 and the
three other zinc gluconate studies1,20,21 is statistically
so great that the Turner trial may be considered sep-
arately (Figures 1 and 2). It is possible that the zinc
gluconate lozenges of the Turner trial were non-opti-
mal, though no specific concerns about those lozenges
have been expressed. If the Turner trial is excluded
from the comparison of zinc acetate against zinc glu-
conate in Figure 1, the difference between the two
salts substantially diminishes. If the Turner trial is
excluded from the calculation of overall effect of
zinc lozenges, the overall estimate increases from
33% reduction to 40% reduction in common cold
duration. In any case, the inclusion or exclusion of
the Turner trial does not influence the comparison of
the two salts or the analysis of dose-dependency.
The doses of zinc used in the studies included in
this meta-analysis were over 75 mg/day, but this
dosage level should not be interpreted as the minimal
effective dose. In addition to the dosage, the pub-
lished five low-dose trials have other problems, and
their negative findings should not be attributed unam-
biguously to the nominal zinc dosage per day. As
described above, lozenges were not properly formu-
lated in three of the low-dose zinc comparisons,25,30
and it is unlikely that free zinc was released.7,8,31 The
fourth trial used a particularly low dose of zinc,
45 mg/day.32 The fifth low-dose trial used children
as subjects.33 Compliance may be a concern in studies
that recruit children because they can be less likely
than adults to follow instructions to slowly dissolve
a lozenge in the mouth. Thus, the five low-dose trials
are not valid for comparing the efficacy of, say, 50–
70 mg/day of zinc against 80–90 mg/day of zinc for
treating colds in adults. Estimation of the dose-
dependency in the region below 80 mg/day thus
requires further research.
The dose-response analysis in Figure 2 is based on
the total daily dose of zinc, which is a simplification.
The daily dosage of elemental zinc is determined by
the amount of zinc per lozenge and the number of
lozenges used per day (Figure 3). Mossad et al.21
and Prasad et al.23 administered lozenges only six
times per day and used 13 mg of zinc per lozenge
and both found a 45% reduction in common cold
duration. There are no indications that a higher fre-
quency or a higher dose of zinc per lozenge might
increase the effect over that reached by those two
studies (Figure 3). It is not clear how the efficacy of
zinc depends on these two variables; however, it
seems unlikely that dissolving a lozenge that contains
80 mg of zinc in the mouth once per day equals dis-
solving eight lozenges that each contain 10 mg of zinc
over the entire day time, even though the nominal
daily dose is the same. Evidently, the optimal
lozenge composition and dosage scheme should be
investigated.
This analysis was based on the calculation of the
relative effect, percentages, of zinc lozenges on the
common cold duration because the relative effect
partly adjusts for variations between the patient
groups
and
outcome
definitions
in
the
trials.
Nevertheless, the absolute effect on days is also an
important measure of the zinc lozenge effect. On aver-
age, the three zinc acetate trials22–24 found that
zinc lozenges shortened colds by 2.7 days from
the mean duration of 7.3 days in the placebo
groups.11 In the zinc gluconate trials, zinc lozenges
shortened colds by 3.6 days from 7.5 days in the pla-
cebo group,1 by 4.0 days from 9.2 days,21 by 1.3 days
from 6.1 days,20 but Turner25 did not find any effect
of zinc.
Farr and Gwaltney34 speculated that the benefit
reported by Eby et al.1 might have been explained
by the bad taste of the zinc lozenges. However, they
did not provide evidence that bad taste might shorten
the duration of colds. The early findings of Eby are
consistent with a number of later trials, and bad taste
does not seem a reasonable explanation for the bene-
fits. For example, none of the three high-dose zinc
acetate lozenge trials reported bad taste to be a prob-
lem, there was no substantial difference between the
zinc and placebo groups in the recorded adverse
effects, and only a few drop-outs occurred.22–24
In the most recent trial by Prasad et al.,24 a few
participants identified the lozenges, but when the ana-
lysis was restricted to those who remained blinded at
the end of the study, the efficacy of zinc lozenges was
no less.
Zinc doses of 100 to 150 mg/day have been admin-
istered for certain patient groups for months with few
adverse effects.2,10,35,36 Therefore, a zinc dose of some
80 mg/day
for
1–2
weeks
starting
at
the
early
symptoms of the common cold is unlikely to cause
long-term adverse effects. Nevertheless, even though
there is strong evidence that properly formulated zinc
lozenges can shorten the duration of colds, the major-
ity of zinc lozenges in the market seem to have either
too low doses of zinc or they contain substances such
as citric acid that bind zinc.8 Therefore, the findings
of this study are not directly applicable to the
wide variety of formulations of zinc lozenges on the
market.

 In conclusion, the trials included in this study were
of high methodological quality: randomised, double-
blind, and placebo-controlled. They were carried out
over three decades by six different research groups.
The evidence is thus very strong that zinc lozenges
may shorten the duration of colds by approximately
33%. The optimal composition of zinc lozenges
should be investigated in addition to the optimum
frequency of their administration. Nevertheless, the
current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges, in par-
ticular zinc acetate lozenges, is so strong that
common cold patients may be encouraged to try
them for treating their colds.
