Abstract While targeted therapy against HER2 is an effective first-line treatment in HER2+
breast cancer, acquired resistance remains a clinical challenge. The pseudokinase HER3,
heterodimerisation partner of HER2, is widely implicated in the resistance to HER2-mediated
therapy. Here, we show that lapatinib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of HER2, is able to induce
proliferation cooperatively with the HER3 ligand neuregulin. This counterintuitive synergy between
inhibitor and growth factor depends on their ability to promote atypical HER2-HER3
heterodimerisation. By stabilising a particular HER2 conformer, lapatinib drives HER2-HER3 kinase
domain heterocomplex formation. This dimer exists in a head-to-head orientation distinct from the
canonical asymmetric active dimer. The associated clustering observed for these dimers
predisposes to neuregulin responses, affording a proliferative outcome. Our findings provide
mechanistic insights into the liabilities involved in targeting kinases with ATP-competitive inhibitors
and highlight the complex role of protein conformation in acquired resistance.

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases plays a major role
in proliferative signalling in a variety of cancers (Baselga and Swain, 2009; Yarden and Pines,
2012). Apart from EGFR (also known as ErbB1), the family consists of the orphan receptor HER2
(ErbB2), the pseudokinase HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4 (ErbB4). Overexpression of HER2 is an onco-
genic driver in approximately 20% of all breast cancers (Lovekin et al., 1991; Owens et al., 2004;
Slamon et al., 1987). The high clinical relevance of these receptors has made them a target for
directed therapy with both antibodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors. In the case of HER2+
breast cancer, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) and its cytotoxic drug-conjugated
derivative trastuzumab-emtansine (Kadcyla), the monoclonal antibody blocking HER2-HER3 dimer-
isation pertuzumab (Perjeta), and the small molecule kinase inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) have
been successful in the clinic (Blackwell et al., 2010; Cameron et al., 2017; Die
´ras et al., 2017;
Geyer et al., 2006; Krop et al., 2017; CLEOPATRA Study Group et al., 2015; EMILIA Study
Group et al., 2012).
While HER2 itself has no known ligand, HER3 binds the growth factor neuregulin (NRG, also
known as heregulin or HRG) to induce heterodimerisation and signalling (Sliwkowski et al., 1994).
HER3 has been implicated in therapeutic resistance to HER2-targeted therapy through a variety of
mechanisms, including receptor rephosphorylation, HER3 overexpression and increased NRG pro-
duction (reviewed in [Claus et al., 2014]). In terms of cellular signalling in response to HER-family
kinase inhibition, HER3-mediated buffering through the Akt/PKB signalling axis has been shown to
be an important factor in therapeutic resistance (Sergina et al., 2007).
The dimerisation of EGFR family members is a fluid process mediated by interaction dynamics in
practically every domain of the receptor. For EGFR, the ligand-bound, active dimer shows an
upright, back-to-back extracellular domain (ECD) interaction where both receptors have bound
ligand, although singly-bound dimers can also occur (Garrett et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2012;
Ogiso et al., 2002). Although HER2 has no known ligand, it natively adopts this upright, dimerisa-
tion-ready ectodomain conformation (Garrett et al., 2002). On the intracellular side, formation of
the active kinase domain dimer is critically affected by the conformation of the juxtamembrane
domain (JMD) (Jura et al., 2009a; Thiel and Carpenter, 2007). The kinase domains associate in an
asymmetric dimer, which resembles the CDK/cyclin-like asymmetric dimer interface (Jeffrey et al.,
1995; Zhang et al., 2006). In this canonical dimer, one kinase (the ‘activator’) allows the dimerisation
partner (the ‘receiver’) to adopt an active conformation and become catalytically active. These vari-
ous conformations have also been observed in near-complete receptors using negative stain elec-
tron microscopy (Mi et al., 2011). Of note in these receptor dimer formations was the lack of active,
asymmetrical kinase domain interactions when the receptor was bound to the ATP-competitive
inhibitor lapatinib (Mi et al., 2011). Although these interactions have mainly been described in the
context of EGFR homodimerisation, they remain a template for the interactions of the rest of the
EGFR family. The conformation of the active kinase domain interaction has been validated for EGFR-
HER3 and HER2-HER3 (Jura et al., 2009b; Littlefield et al., 2014; van Lengerich et al., 2017).
A multitude of studies, using a variety of techniques, have confirmed that EGFR-family receptors
can form higher order oligomers, and that the exact nature of these oligomers is modulated by a
variety of conditions, including receptor density, ligand presence, ligand type and temperature-
dependent membrane behaviour (Clayton et al., 2005; Clayton et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2016;
Nagy et al., 2010; Needham et al., 2016; Saffarian et al., 2007; van Lengerich et al., 2017;
Yang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2017).
Against the backdrop of such a multitude of association modes, it is clear that conformational
dynamics and structural rearrangements are an integral regulator of protein behaviour in the EGFR
family.
We have shown previously that within a kinase, in this case PKCe, occupation of the nucleotide
binding pocket with ATP (or an inhibitor) is a major determinant of protein behaviour, conferring the
structural stability required for protein–protein interactions to occur and priming sites to be stably
phosphorylated (Cameron et al., 2009). Similar effects have been observed in several additional

 kinases, including PKB/Akt, IRE1, and AMPK (Okuzumi et al., 2009; Papa et al., 2003; Ross et al.,
2017; Wang et al., 2012).
A notable example of nucleotide binding pocket occupation inducing behaviour independent of
catalysis has been described for the RAF family, originally in cRAF, where the inhibitor SB 203580
paradoxically induced activity (Eyers et al., 1998). More recently, a similar phenomenon has been
shown in BRAF, where the small molecule kinase inhibitor vemurafenib blocks the oncogenic mutant
V600E, but stabilises the wild type protein, promoting downstream proliferative signalling
(Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010; McKay et al., 2011; Poulikakos et al., 2010; Thevakumaran et al.,
2015). Within the EGFR family, we and others have shown previously that quinazoline inhibitors can
cause homodimer formation of EGFR, and EGFR-MET heterodimerisation, by stabilising particular
kinase domain conformers (Arteaga et al., 1997; Bublil et al., 2010; Lichtner et al., 2001; Ortiz-
Zapater et al., 2017).
The structural, conformational role that nucleotide pocket occupation can fulfil is particularly
interesting in the context of pseudokinases, which have lost their catalytic activity. Sequence analysis
shows that many pseudokinases retain several of the conserved residues involved in ATP-binding
(Boudeau et al., 2006; Claus et al., 2013). In vitro analysis of the pseudokinome showed that many
pseudokinases have nucleotide binding capability (Murphy et al., 2014).
In the case of these ATP-binding pseudokinases, where nucleotide binding does not elicit phos-
photransfer, the structural stability conferred by ATP binding may be integral to protein function.
This has been observed for the pseudokinase STRAD, which requires ATP binding to sustain a
heterotrimeric complex with LKB and MO25 (Zeqiraj et al., 2009a; Zeqiraj et al., 2009b). Similarly,
in the pseudokinase FAM20A ATP-binding, albeit in a non-canonical orientation, is essential for sta-
bilising the FAM20A/FAM20C complex (Cui et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2017). ATP binding is a struc-

HER3 is able to bind ATP (crystallised as PDB ID 3KEX, 3LMG), as well as the Src/ABL inhibitor
Bosutinib (PDB ID 4OTW) (Levinson and Boxer, 2014; Davis et al., 2011; Jura et al., 2009b;
Murphy et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2010). Considering the importance of HER3 as a conformational
eLife digest Around 20% of breast cancers are caused because cells have too many copies of a
receptor protein called HER2 on their surface. HER2 is responsible for telling the cell to divide. Cells
with too many of these receptors – and breast cancer cells can have up to 1000 times too many –
divide uncontrollably. This causes the cancer to grow.
Several successful anti-cancer drugs, such as Herceptin and Kadcyla, are used in the clinic to
block the signals produced by HER2. Other drugs called kinase inhibitors prevent HER2 from
building its faulty signals. However, a particular kinase inhibitor called lapatinib was not as successful
in clinical trials as the medical community had hoped.
Kinase inhibitors can have unexpected effects. While they can block specific signals in a cell, they
can sometimes also cause new types of signals. Could this be one of the reasons behind the
disappointing clinical trial results for lapatinib?
By performing experiments on breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory, Claus, Patel et al.
found that lapatinib can counterintuitively boost the growth of breast cancer cells. This occurs
because lapatinib causes HER2 receptors to cluster together like a daisy chain along with another
protein receptor of the same family, called HER3. These chains are primed to rapidly respond to a
molecule called neuregulin, a growth factor that is commonly associated with breast cancer.
The results presented by Claus, Patel et al. indicate that a particular subset of breast cancer
patients – those whose cancer cells do not increase production of HER3 receptors – might better
respond to lapatinib than others. The insights gained into what happens to HER2 when you try to
block it should also influence the design of new drugs that target either HER2 or HER3.

 partner in the HER2-HER3 heterodimer, and the established importance of ATP-binding for complex
formation in other pseudokinases, the role of nucleotide binding pocket occupation in HER3 function
warrants investigation.
Here, we have integrated the study of kinase-autonomous conformational effects of nucleotide
binding pocket occupation with that of HER2-HER3 heterointeraction modalities and downstream
proliferative phenotypes in response to drug treatment. We show that nucleotide pocket occupation
in both HER2 and the pseudokinase HER3 is of great conformational importance for kinase domain
heterodimerisation and subsequent proliferative signalling. In HER2+ breast cancer cells this leads to
an unexpected synergy between the HER3 ligand NRG and the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, by which
their concomitant binding promotes proliferation in 2D and 3D culture systems. Lapatinib is able to
promote heterodimerisation between the kinase domains of full-length HER2 and HER3 in cells.
However, this dimer interface is different from the canonical active EGFR-family dimer, and it is nec-
essary for the lapatinib/NRG combinatorial proliferative phenotype. Both the lapatinib-induced het-
erodimer and the cooperative proliferation effects depend strongly on the ability for the
pseudokinase HER3 to bind ATP. Consistent with the model, occupying the pseudokinase HER3 with
the Src/Abl inhibitor bosutinib stabilises the pseudokinase domain to the extent that it actually pro-
motes HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation and downstream proliferation.
Results
Lapatinib-NRG co-treatment shows a synergistic effect on proliferation,
dependent on HER3 ATP binding
The sensitivity of a variety of oncogene-addicted cell lines to small molecule kinase inhibitors can be
counter-acted by the addition of growth factors (Wilson et al., 2012). This includes the case of lapa-
tinib-treated HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, where NRG is seen to mediate a rescue of drug toxicity
(Novotny et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2012). Using different experimental procedures, we have
investigated further these competing effects of lapatinib and NRG on the proliferative behaviour of
HER2+ breast cancer cells.
In SKBR3, BT474, AU565, and HCC1419 cells treated with a range of lapatinib concentrations for
72 hr, the addition of 10 nM NRG rescues the drug-induced cytotoxicity except at very high drug
concentrations (Figure 1a, Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c).
Interestingly, in the case of the SKBR3, BT474 and AU565 cell lines, low concentrations of lapati-
nib (~40–400 nM) are able to enhance proliferation in conjunction with 10 nM NRG by 25–30% com-
pared to growth factor alone (Figure 1a, Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b). A partial response of
this cooperative phenotype is observed in ZR75 and HCC1419 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement
1c–d).

(Novotny et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2012). We corroborated our results with a cell counting assay,
in which SKBR3 cells were treated for 72 hr with 250 nM lapatinib or vehicle ±10 nM NRG
(Figure 1b). The emergent effect of lapatinib plus NRG depends on lapatinib sensitivity. Two breast
cancer cell lines with low lapatinib sensitivity, MCF7 and HCC1569, show low inhibitor-growth factor
cooperation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1e–f). The growth phenotype in ZR75 may be partially
explained by its HER4 expression, considering that NRG is also a ligand for HER4 (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1g).
Although HER3 has been shown to bind lapatinib in vitro with very low affinity (Kd = 5.5 mM)
(Davis et al., 2011), the synergistic behaviour between lapatinib and NRG occurs in cells at a ~ 50 x
lower dose than the in vitro Kd, indicating that any binding of lapatinib to HER3 would likely be
minor under these conditions. Using a thermal shift assay (TSA), which measures a shift in the ther-
mal stability of a protein after ligand/inhibitor binding in vitro, we also show that lapatinib does not
strongly bind HER3 as compared to ATP and a panel of other inhibitors (Figure 2a, see further
below).
While EGF treatment rescued SKBR3 cells from the effects of low-concentration lapatinib treat-
ment, synergistic growth effects such as those observed with lapatinib-NRG co-treatment were not
observed for lapatinib-EGF co-treated SKBR3 or BT474 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1h–i).
Although NRG is also a growth factor ligand for HER4, protein levels of HER4 in SKBR3 cells are very
low (Figure 1—figure supplement 1g). Additionally, lapatinib is a strong inhibitor of both EGFR and

 HER4 (Davis et al., 2011). Taken together, these data seem to exclude a significant role for EGFR
and HER4 in the synergistic growth observed for lapatinib-NRG co-treatment. Moreover, transient
knockdown of HER3 with two different siRNA oligonucleotides shows a modest, but consistent
reduction in the proliferative effect of ligand-inhibitor co-treatment, implicating HER3 as the relevant
growth factor-binding receptor for this NRG response (Figure 1—figure supplement 1j).
The proliferative effects of lapatinib and NRG on SKBR3 cells were also observed in 3D spheroid
cultures. As seen in 2D culture systems, in 3D spheroid culture the addition of NRG to lapatinib-
treated cells rescues SKBR3 cells from lapatinib-induced cytotoxicity/cytostasis (Figure 1c, Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1k–l). Lapatinib and NRG share a cooperative effect on the induction of
proliferation in 3D spheroid cultures, where spheroid size is greater for inhibitor-ligand co-treatment
conditions than for those treated with growth factor alone.
The irreversible inhibitor neratinib binds the same inactive conformation as lapatinib and with sim-
ilar binding affinity (Davis et al., 2011). However, neratinib is an irreversible inhibitor and forms a
covalent bond with HER2C805, a residue conserved in EGFR and HER4 but not HER3. Neratinib-NRG
co-treatment did not show the synergistic proliferative phenotype observed with lapatinib-NRG, in

larly, the induction of HER2 and HER3 phosphorylation seen in western blot analysis of lapatinib-
NRG co-treated 3D spheroids was absent in neratinib-NRG co-treatment (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1l, Figure 1—figure supplement 2d). This indicates that the proliferative phenotype observed
for lapatinib is likely to necessitate a dynamic, reversible inhibitor binding.
Collectively, the data from both 2D and 3D cultures show that there is a counterintuitive synergy
between the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib and the HER3 ligand NRG in driving the proliferation of SKBR3
cells. This prompted us to examine the potential for novel allosteric regulation of HER2-HER3 het-
erotypic interactions by both ligand and inhibitors.

 HER3 nucleotide pocket occupation is of structural importance
To study the effects of ATP binding on HER3 function, we aimed to both stabilise and destabilise
the pseudokinase nucleotide-binding pocket. This would allow us to investigate the importance of
the structural role that nucleotide binding pocket occupation has been shown to play in several
(pseudo)kinases.
To separate the structural and trace catalytic roles that ATP-binding could fulfill in HER3, we used
the ATP-competitive Src/Abl inhibitor bosutinib, which has been shown to bind strongly to HER3 but
not to other EGFR family members (Levinson and Boxer, 2014; Davis et al., 2011). We compared
bosutinib to a small panel of EGFR family inhibitors as well as an additional Src inhibitor, dasatinib,
and measured HER3 thermal stability by TSA (Figure 2a, Figure 2—figure supplement 1a). In line
with previous observations, we confirmed that HER3 strongly binds bosutinib. Significantly, lapatinib
was not able to provide a noticeable thermal shift, which corresponds to previously published results
indicating HER3 does not bind lapatinib with high affinity (Davis et al., 2011). While lapatinib was
able to confer strongly increased thermal stability to HER2, bosutinib was not (Figure 2b). This is in
line with previously published data that indicates HER2 is not a strong bosutinib binder (Davis et al.,
2011).
We hypothesised that bosutinib might be able to aid proliferation in a cellular context by stabilis-
ing the nucleotide binding pocket of HER3 and helping sustain dimer formation, analogous to
vemurafenib-bound behaviour of BRAF. In a 2D proliferation assay, SKBR3 cells treated with bosuti-
nib over 72 hr show a dose dependent induction of proliferation without additional NRG stimulation
(Figure 2—figure supplement 1b). This proliferative effect is sustained in eight-day treatments in
3D spheroid cultures (Figure 2c, Figure 2—figure supplement 1d,e). The ability of bosutinib to
induce SKBR3 cell proliferation appears to be an EGFR-family mediated event, as lapatinib treatment
can curtail its effects in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2—figure supplement 1e).
In order to destabilise the HER3 nucleotide binding pocket we made the triple mutant HER3KGG.
HER3K742 was mutated to methionine to hinder ATP a-phosphate coordination, which by itself has
been shown to reduce HER3 mant-ATP binding affinity (Shi et al., 2010). To obstruct ATP binding
further, double aspartates were introduced in the glycine-rich loop (HER3G716D/G718D) to mimic the
pseudokinase-specific aspartate residue observed in the glycine-rich loop of VRK3 (Scheeff et al.,
2009), adding a negative charge in the area where the ATP phosphates would normally sit. Introduc-
tion of this ATP-binding deficient HER3KGG mutant into MCF7 cells shows abrogation of ligand-
induced trans-phosphorylation of HER3 by HER2 (Figure 2d). SKBR3 cells ectopically expressing
HER3wt or HER3KGG show a differential proliferative behaviour upon lapatinib ±NRG treatment. This
indicates a critical role for HER3 ATP binding in order to sustain inhibitor-growth factor cooperative
proliferation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1f).
The bosutinib binding of HER3wt, HER3KGG, and the proposed drug de-sensitised HER3T787M
(Levinson and Boxer, 2014; Dong et al., 2017), was investigated using an in-cell thermal shift assay
(CETSA) (Jafari et al., 2014; Reinhard et al., 2015). Where wild type HER3 showed increased ther-
mal stability in cells in the presence of 50 nM bosutinib, HER3KGG did not (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1g). Ectopic expression of wild type HER3, but not HER3KGG or HER3T787M, enhances
bosutinib-mediated proliferation, indicating this behaviour is driven by bosutinib binding to HER3
directly (Figure 2e). Both HER3KGG and HER3T787M showed normal localization to the plasma mem-
brane, as measured by flow cytometry, indicating that these mutations did not compromise the
receptor and its traffic to the plasma membrane (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).
The HER3KGG and bosutinib results indicate that nucleotide pocket occupation in HER3 is essen-
tial for its ability to sustain a proliferative signalling pathway under distinct circumstances: in the
acute response to growth factor, in promoting ligand-inhibitor cooperative proliferation and even
after treatment with a HER3-binding inhibitor. This indicates a critical structural role for HER3 ATP-
binding pocket occupation in its ability to sustain heterointeractions and proliferation. Considering
the proliferative effects observed with the HER3-binding inhibitor bosutinib, our results also suggest
that any residual transferase activity HER3 retains does not appear to be important in these

would seem unlikely.

 Lapatinib binding induces HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation
The stability conferred to a protein kinase by small molecule inhibitor binding has been shown to
play an important role in the promotion of protein–protein interactions. We investigated the poten-
tial role of lapatinib to similarly promote HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation by stabilising particular pro-
tein
conformations
in
HER2
using
a
FRET-FLIM
approach.
We
measured
drug-induced
heterodimerisation of HER2 and HER3, as we have done previously in the case of drug-induced
dimerisation of the EGF receptor (Bublil et al., 2010; Coban et al., 2015).
At endogenous protein levels in SKBR3 cells, we observe lapatinib-driven HER2-HER3 heterodi-
merisation to levels similar to those seen with NRG (Figure 3a). Interestingly, the lapatinib-induced
dimerisation occurs in the absence of exogenously added NRG, indicating a HER2-HER3 dimer that
is driven primarily through intracellular domain interactions. MCF7 cells, which express low levels of
endogenous HER2 and HER3 compared to SKBR3, also display lapatinib-induced heterodimerisation
of ectopically expressed GFP-HER2wt and HA-HER3wt (Figure 3b).
As discussed above, occupation of the nucleotide binding pocket in HER3 is of importance for its
ability to sustain proliferation. This is also reflected in the case of lapatinib-induced heterodimer for-
mation, where the introduction of the nucleotide pocket compromised HER3KGG mutant strongly
disrupts inhibitor-promoted heterodimerisation (Figure 3c). In line with the proliferative effects
described above, bosutinib was also able to directly promote heterodimerisation between HER2 and
HER3 (Figure 3d).
Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we analysed receptor clustering in
SKBR3 cells. Treatment with either NRG, lapatinib, or bosutinib showed a shift in cluster population
size compared to control, implying the formation of higher-order oligomers rather than dimers
(Figure 3e,f). The exact HER2-HER3 stoichiometry in these drug-treated oligomers remains elusive,
because these experimental conditions allowed us to count only cluster size for either HER2 or
HER3, not both at the same time. Therefore, it is expected that the observed HER3 clusters also con-
tain uncounted HER2 receptors, and vice versa, as evident in the FRET-FLIM data.
Disruption of the active HER2-HER3 interface
The active signalling dimer in the EGFR family adopts an asymmetric orientation, in which there is a
distinct division of labour in the activator-receiver pairing. One kinase (the activator kinase) does not
phosphorylate substrates, but binds in a way that helps its heterodimerisation partner (the receiver
kinase) in adopting an active conformation. The receiver kinase is then capable of substrate phos-
phorylation. Originally described for EGFR homodimerisation, and similar to the cyclin/CDK binding
mode (Jeffrey et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2006), this canonical active dimerisation interface has
been reported across the EGFR family including the heterodimerisation of HER3, which can only per-
form the activator role (Jura et al., 2009b; Littlefield et al., 2014; van Lengerich et al., 2017).
Mutations that disrupt this active interface in both the activator and receiver partner kinases are
well-documented and are schematically highlighted (Figure 4a, Figure 4—video 1).
In the case of the active, activator/receiver interface, HER3 buttresses the inward orientation of
the HER2 a-C helix, leaving no space for the HER2 a-C helix to adopt the ‘out’ orientation character-
istic of the inactive conformation. We modelled the potential effects of HER2 a-C helix positioning
on lapatinib binding to test whether canonical activator/receiver orientation (in which the HER2 a-C
helix is pushed inwards) would give sufficient space to still accommodate lapatinib. Our modelling
showed that, for a HER2 a-C helix in the active, ‘in’ position, lapatinib binding results in a potential
steric clash with HER2E770/M774 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b). A general decrease of the

v1.5 (Laskowski, 1995)) supports these predictions.
To further test whether the lapatinib-induced HER2-HER3 is adopting the canonical activator/
receiver orientation, we used FRET-FLIM to investigate lapatinib-induced dimer formation. The
I714Q mutation in HER2, which renders the receptor receiver-impaired, disrupted the lapatinib-
driven HER2-HER3 association, indicating it is retained in the lapatinib-induced dimer interface
(Figure 4b). However, the reciprocal activator-impaired mutation in HER3 (HER3V945R) did not dis-
rupt lapatinib-mediated heterodimerisation, although it efficiently suppressed the canonical active
dimer after ligand-induced heterodimerisation (Figure 4c).

 It is surmised that the inhibitor binding is able to robustly induce a heterodimer between HER2
and HER3, which is distinct from the canonical active heterodimer induced after growth factor stimu-
lation. The orientation of this non-canonical lapatinib-driven heterodimer retains HER2I714 in the

 dimer interface, giving us a starting point for in silico molecular modelling to investigate potential
dimer conformations distinct from the well-described active dimer.
Lapatinib drives a novel HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation interface
In the case of type II kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib, the inhibitor stabilises an inactive conforma-
tion of the kinase domain, where the a-C helix is tilted outwards. As HER3 lacks the conserved gluta-
mate residue in the a-C helix, HER3K742 is unable to form the salt bridge normally observed in active
kinase domain structures (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002). The HER3 ATP-bound conformation therefore
does not show a classical active conformation with the a-C helix tilted inward (Jura et al., 2009b;
Shi et al., 2010), but instead resembles the inactive conformation seen in kinases bound to type II
inhibitors such as lapatinib. Because lapatinib-bound HER2 and ATP-bound HER3 adopt similar con-
formations, there is a possibility that the lapatinib-induced, inactive dimer is oriented symmetrically.
In the crystal lattices of EGFR and HER3 kinase domains, two different symmetrical interaction
interfaces have been observed (Jura et al., 2009a; Jura et al., 2009b). We used molecular model-
ling to investigate the potential for HER3 and lapatinib-bound HER2 to adopt either of these con-
formers (Figure 5a–b, Figure 5—figure supplement 1a–b). HER2I714 is present in the interaction
interface of both the EGFR-like, staggered orientation, as well as in the head-to-head, HER3-like ori-
entation. This falls in line with the FRET-FLIM data in Figure 4 that suggests the retained presence
of the HER2I714 residue in the lapatinib-induced dimer interface.
On the basis of these models, we designed pairs of mutations in HER2 that would exclusively dis-
rupt one of the potential heterodimer orientations (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—
video 1 and 2). For the EGFR-like, staggered dimer we substituted two hydrophobic residues on
HER2 with two positively charged residues, HER2I748R/V750R, which should lead to repulsion from the
positively charged residues, K998 and K999, lying on the HER3 side of the interface.
Likewise, for the HER3-like, head-to-head dimer, we predicted that the HER2N764R/K765F mutant
would disrupt the dimerisation interface. The substitution of an asparagine residue (HER2N764) with a
positively charged arginine should lead to repulsion from a positively charged HER3 residue
(HER3R702), lying within a radius of 4 A
˚ and opposite to HER2N764, therefore causing severe disrup-
tion of the HER3-like dimer interface. Furthermore, the substitution of a lysine residue (HER2K765)
with a bulky, hydrophobic residue such as phenylalanine should generate clashes at this HER2-HER3
interface.
These dimer interface mutants were introduced into our FRET-FLIM assay for investigation of the
lapatinib-induced heterodimerisation conformer (Figure 5c). The HER2N764R/K765F mutant disrupted
heterodimerisation upon lapatinib binding, whereas HER2I748R/V750R showed no difference in hetero-
dimer formation. These mutational FRET/FLIM data is consistent with our model that the lapatinib-
induced HER2-HER3 heterodimer adopts a symmetrical, head-to-head orientation, similar to the one
observed in the HER3 kinase domain crystal lattice (Jura et al., 2009b) (Figure 5b).
Head-to-head HER2-HER3 dimerisation is required for inhibitor-induced
proliferation
Having presented modelling and FRET/FLIM data consistent with an orientation of the lapatinib-
induced HER2-HER3 dimer being distinct from the active activator/receiver dimer interface, we
sought to identify which type of HER2-HER3 interaction caused the NRG-lapatinib co-stimulatory
growth observed in 2D proliferation assays.
In these assays, we did not ectopically introduce the HER2N764R/K765F mutant because, firstly, it
might also disrupt the active, asymmetrical HER2-HER3 heterodimer interface and secondly, SKBR3
cells have vast numbers of endogenous HER2 receptors that would hinder analysis of the behaviour
of ectopically expressed HER2N764R/K765F. Instead we identified HER3L700F as the reciprocal mutant
to HER2N764R/K765F (Figure 6a, Figure 6—video 1). We introduced HER3L700F into SKBR3 cells to
investigate the role of the head-to-head, symmetric dimer interface in the lapatinib-NRG synergistic
proliferation described above. While the HER3V945R active dimer mutant did not disrupt drug-growth
factor cooperative proliferation, the HER3L700F mutant did (Figure 6d–e). Both HER3L700F and
HER3V945R were expressed on the cell surface, as measured by flow cytometry (Figure 2—figure
supplement 2). Combined, this indicates that the inhibitor-induced heterodimer of HER2 and HER3
is consistent with a head-to-head, symmetrical conformation, and it plays an important role in the

 synergistic proliferative effects of lapatinib and NRG. Although this conformation has been
described from the HER3 kinase domain crystal lattice (Jura et al., 2009b), to our knowledge it is
the first time a functional role has been ascribed to heterodimers consistent with this interface in
cells.
Discussion
The conformational dynamics of HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation are an important consideration for
evaluating existing and future targeted therapy intervention strategies against HER2+ breast cancer
and other HER family driven cancers. Here, we show that the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib is paradoxically
able to promote proliferative behaviour in HER2+ breast cancer cells when administered in the pres-
ence of the HER3 ligand NRG. The synergy between growth factor and inhibitor requires an intri-
cate, multi-step cascade of conformational events.
Lapatinib itself is able to promote heterodimerisation between the kinase domains of HER2 and
HER3, stabilising an orientation consistent with a symmetric, head-to-head kinase domain hetero-
dimer that is distinct from the canonical, asymmetric, head-to-tail active kinase domain orientation
that occurs throughout the EGFR family. An analogous interface has previously been observed in the
HER3 kinase domain crystal lattice (Jura et al., 2009b); here, we have provided modelling and cellu-
lar evidence of a heterodimer with an interface consistent to the one observed in the HER3 kinase
domain crystal lattice. Sequestering HER2 and HER3 in these inactive, lapatinib-bound heterodimers
was of benefit to NRG-mediated proliferative signalling. Our results, in which inhibitor binding drives
dimer formation that boosts signalling and proliferation, shows some parallels with the inhibitor-
induced signalling phenotypes in the RAF-family (Eyers et al., 1998; Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010;
McKay et al., 2011; Poulikakos et al., 2010; Thevakumaran et al., 2015)
While the FRET-FLIM analysis of the lapatinib-induced dimerisation was not able to differentiate
between heterodimers or higher order oligomers, our clustering data shows that lapatinib is likely to
induce higher order oligomers. Because of the modelled symmetrical nature of these lapatinib-
induced dimers, in which both lapatinib-bound HER2 and HER3 would be conformationally available
as ‘activator’ receptors for additional oligomerization partners, it is not inconceivable they may act
as nucleation points for larger oligomeric signalling platforms. Such signalling arrays, in which mutual
cooperativity increases signaling output, have been proposed for EGFR oligomers (Huang et al.,
2016).
The addition of ligand potentially causes rearrangements within these platforms through the
ligand-induced conformational ballet of multi-level interactions between the various extracellular
and intracellular domains of EGFR family receptors (reviewed in (Lemmon et al., 2014)). The forma-
tion of lapatinib-induced oligomeric platforms may facilitate a transition into active signalling hetero-
dimers upon ligand binding, due to the availability of dimerisation partners in immediate proximity
within these drug-induced oligomer platforms.
Both the lapatinib-induced HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation and the downstream lapatinib-NRG
synergistic effects on proliferation depended on the ability of HER3 to bind ATP. Although usually
classified as a pseudokinase, HER3 has been shown to retain a measure of autophosphorylation
activity (not transphosphorylation) under specific circumstances (Shi et al., 2010). We show HER2-
HER3 heterodimerisation and downstream proliferative effects can be elicited by the addition of the
HER3-binding inhibitor bosutinib, indicating that nucleotide binding pocket occupation performs a

in certain pseudokinases, and the necessity of pocket-occupied structural conformers in sustaining

Because of the importance of HER3 in HER2-targeted therapy resistance, its conserved ATP bind-
ing raised the possibility of targeting HER3 with ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. Our data show,
however, that stabilisation of the HER3 kinase domain with an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor can
have a stimulating effect on HER2+ breast cancer cell proliferation. This indicates that the develop-
ment of small molecule targeted therapy against HER3 for use in HER2+ breast cancer needs to be
directed away from stabilising the HER3 ATP binding pocket occupied conformer and rather towards

 stabilising the apo, inactive conformer. An exception to this might be the development of irrevers-
ible, adamantane-linked inhibitors of HER3 that target the receptor for proteosomal degradation
(Xie et al., 2014).
The substantial effect that lower doses of lapatinib have on proliferation in the presence of
growth factor may have an impact on the establishment of lapatinib-resistance in vivo. This is in
accordance with the observation from xenograft models that resistance occurs much more readily if
lapatinib is administered continuously at low doses than if it’s used intermittently at high dose
(Amin et al., 2010). Increased production of growth factors (including NRG) is a well-described resis-
tance mechanism against HER2-targeted therapy (reviewed in [Claus et al., 2014]). NRG production
by the microenvironment has also been shown to play a role in metastatic spread of ovarian cancer
cells that express high levels of HER3 (Pradeep et al., 2014). High expression levels of NRG in
HER2+ breast cancer patients showed a strong correlation with disease recurrence (Xia et al., 2013).
Several somatic mutations in HER3 observed in cancer fall within the extracellular domain and have a
potential effect on ligand-binding affinity (Jaiswal et al., 2013). These mutations may exacerbate
the inhibitor-growth factor synergistic behaviour reported here.
Our results provide a potential molecular mechanism for the disappointing results observed in a
recent Phase III study of lapatinib used in an adjuvant setting (ALTTO trial) (Piccart-Gebhart et al.,
2016). The lapatinib-only arm of this study was terminated prematurely, and the effects observed in
the adjuvant setting for both lapatinib-trastuzumab co-treatment and trastuzumab treatment fol-
lowed by lapatinib were not significant. These clinical results indicate there are complicating factors
in hindering lapatinib efficacy in patients, which may involve the expression levels of HER3 and NRG
stimulation by a complex tumour microenvironment. The complex relationships between distinct
protein conformation dynamics, formation of oligomeric assemblies, the availability of ligand, and
the various effects on downstream signalling all need to be considered when applying targeted ther-
apy to avoid potentially unexpected enhanced cancer cell proliferation after inhibitor treatment.
Materials and methods
Reagents and antibodies
NRG1 was purchased from PeproTech. Lapatinib was a kind gift from Professor Gyo

Chemie Research Ltd Hungary). Bosutinib was purchased from LC Labs. Total HER2, HER3, PKB,
HER2 pY877, HER3 pY1289, PKB pS473 and ERK1/2 pT202/pY204 antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology, anti-a-tubulin from Sigma, total ERK1/2 from Merck, and Alexa Fluor-488
conjugated anti-HER3 antibody from R&D systems.
Cell culture and plasmid transfection
MCF7 and ZR75 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, SKBR3 cells were grown
in McCoys medium supplemented with 10% FCS. BT474, AU565, HCC1419, and HCC1569 cells
were grown in RPMI with 10% FCS. For BT474 cells 10 mg/ml bovine insulin was included in the cul-
ture medium.
Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6, FuGENE HD (Roche), or Lipofect-
amine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
All cell lines were sourced from the Francis Crick Institute’s Cell Services facility, where they were
tested negative for mycoplasma and authenticated via STR profiling.
Proliferation assays
For 2D proliferation assays, cells were plated at 1 � 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The following
day they were subjected to treatment for 72 hr, followed by addition of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Prom-
ega) and measured on an EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). CellTiter-Glo data were normalised
to the growth factor-null/inhibitor-null untreated control. This caused some growth factor-treated
plots to start at above-baseline levels, which is an indication of the proliferative effect that growth
factor treatment had in these cells.
For 3D spheroid assays, 3 � 103 cells were plated in a 96-well, round-bottom, ultra-low attach-
ment plate (Corning) in the presence of 1% Matrigel (Corning). After three days of growth, an equal
volume of 2x media containing treatment conditions was added and refreshed every three days for a

Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated anti-HER3 antibody (R&D systems, clone 66223) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were blocked using mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Antibodies) for 15 min at room
temperature, followed by incubation with conjugated antibody for 30 min at room temperature in
the dark. Cells were washed in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% sodium azide three times before flow cytomet-
ric analysis using a BD Fortessa instrument (BD). Results were analysed using the Flo-Jo software.
FRET determination by FLIM measurements
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is used to quantitate direct protein–protein interac-
tions and post-translational modifications. Processing of cells for FRET determination by FLIM has
been previously described (Barber et al., 2009; Parsons and Ng, 2002). FLIM was performed using
time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) with a multiphoton microscope system as described
previously (Peter et al., 2005). For experiments measuring endogenous protein, FRET pairs were
Cy5-conjugated anti-HER2 IgG, and Alexa546-conjugated anti-HER3 IgG. For exogenous protein
measurements, FRET pairs were HER2-GFP and HER3-HA with an anti-HA IgG, tagged with a Cy3
fluorophore. FRET efficiency between the donor and acceptor bound proteins was calculated with
the following equation in each pixel and averaged per cell: FRET eff = 1-tau(DA)/tau(control) where
tau(DA) is the lifetime displayed by cells co-expressing the donor and acceptor, whereas tau (control)
is the mean donor (GFP) lifetime, measured in the absence of the acceptor.
Modelling HER2-HER3 dimers
We modelled the HER2-HER3 dimer by comparative homology modelling using a multiple templates
approach. The active, asymmetric HER2-HER3 dimer was modelled using the crystal structure of the
active EGFR kinase domain (PDB ID 2GS2) (Zhang et al., 2006) and one chain of the crystal structure
of the HER3 homodimer (PDB ID 3KEX) (Jura et al., 2009b) as templates. To build the EGFR-like,
inactive, symmetric dimer we have used the crystal structure of the EGFR homodimer (PDB ID
3GT8) (Jura et al., 2009a), the crystal structure of EGFR complexed with lapatinib (PDB ID
1XKK) (Wood et al., 2004) and only one chain of the crystal structure of the HER3 homodimer (PDB
ID 3KEX) (Jura et al., 2009b). To build the HER3-like dimer, we have used the HER3 homodimer
structure (PDB ID 3KEX) (Jura et al., 2009b), the crystal structure of EGFR lapatinib-bound (PDB ID
1XKK) (Wood et al., 2004) and the crystal structure of the inactive EGFR AMP-PNP bound (PDB ID
2GS7) (Zhang et al., 2006). The sequence alignment used to build the model has been created by
using PRALINE with the homology-extended alignment strategy (Simossis et al., 2005). We gener-
ated 200 three-dimensional models using the MODELLER package (Sali and Blundell, 1993). The
selected models were chosen on the basis of the MODELLER objective function’s DOPE score.
The

with
the
SURFNET
1.5
package (Laskowski, 1995), where the cavity regions in a protein are built up by fitting a probe
sphere of 1.4 A

using
the

of
the

package (Humphrey et al., 1996), and measurement of interaction surface buried residues was per-
formed using POPScomp (Kleinjung and Fraternali, 2005).
Receptor clustering assays
STORM imaging and cluster analyses are described in more detail at Bioprotocol (Roberts et al.,
2018). SKBR3 cells were treated with either 14 nM Lapatinib or 41 nM Bosutinib. HER2 and HER3
Affibody ligands were used to label the non-activated states of the receptors (HER2 from Affibody
Inc. and plasmid encoding the HER3 affibody was a gift from John Lo
¨ fblom, protein made in house
and shown to bind specifically to HER3 receptors) and NRG-b1 (Peprotech) was used to stimulate
the cells. The conjugation of dyes (Invitrogen) to HER2 and HER3 ligands was done in house and the
ratio of dye:ligand was confirmed to be ~1:1. The NRG-dye conjugate has been shown to be as

 active as the unlabelled protein. We incubated cells in 100 nM HER2Affibody-Alexa488 + 50 nM
HER3Affibody-Alexa647 or 100 nM HER2Affibody-Alexa488 + 10 nM NRG-Alexa647 ±drug for 1 hr.
Cells were chemically fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS solutions)+0.5% glutaraldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich) diluted into ice-cold PBS.
Samples were imaged using a Zeiss Elyra super-resolution microscope to stochastically excite the
Alexa488 and Alexa647 fluorophores bound to the receptors in the cells and to image single mole-
cules. Imaging was done in TIRF mode using a 100x oil immersion objective lens. We used a 405 nm
laser line to aid fluorophore blinking and 488 nm or 640 nm laser lines to excite the fluorophores,
alternating the lasers to image the two receptors independently every 300 frames, over a total
of ~10,000 frames. The exposure time was 20 ms. A minimum of two replicates of each sample were
imaged generating at least 12 regions (25.6 mm x 25.6 mm) covering at least one cell per region. The
Zen software localised the single molecule spots in the cells, a threshold was set to discard back-
ground spots and the co-ordinates of the positive localisations (typically 30,000 + for HER2 and
5,000 + for HER3 per region) were passed into the Bayesian cluster identification algorithm (Rubin-
Delanchy et al., 2015)
The clustering algorithm expects the background and clusters to be uniformly distributed over a
rectangular ROI (Rubin-Delanchy et al., 2015). The analysed images mainly showed single cells. Of
interest are the HER2 and HER3 receptors in the cell membrane, which were visible as a circular
shape. In order to conform with the prerequisites of the clustering algorithms, rectangular regions
have been manually selected that tightly cover the cell membrane using the most suitable angles
(assessed by visual inspection). The whole cell membrane has been covered in this way. The data
selected by these regions have been rotated so that the sides of the rectangles became parallel to
the coordinate axis. The result was used as input for the clustering algorithm and the algorithm was
applied as described by the protocol. The complete lists of molecules per cluster that have been
produced by the algorithm were used for the presentation.
Recombinant HER3 KD purification
The baculoviral HER3 kinase domain construct was kindly provided by Prof. Mark Lemmon, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. Sf21 cells at 1 � 106 cells/ml were infected with P3 virus (7 � 107 pfu/ml) at an
MOI of 1.0 and allowed to grow for three days. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing prote-
ase inhibitors, 1 mM DTT and 2 mM BME. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and incubated
with NiNTA resin (Qiagen) for 30 mins at 4˚C, after which the resin was washed extensively with
buffer containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM BME, 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole.
HER3 was eluted in the same buffer with 200 mM imidazole added.
Each elution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove any precipitate or resin and applied to a
S200 gel filtration column in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM BME, 2.5% glycerol.
Thermal shift assay (TSA)
Thermal shift assays were carried out as described in (Niesen et al., 2007). Briefly, in a 96-well RT-
PCR plate (Life Technologies) 1 mg HER3 kinase domain/well was incubated with 1 mM inhibitor or
200 mM ATP/10 mM MgCl2 (as indicated) for 30 mins at 4˚C in the presence of Sypro Orange dye
(Sigma). HER2 TSA experiments were performed in a 384-well RT-PCR plate (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). 0.5 mg of HER2 kinase domain/well was incubated with 1 mM lapatinib, 1 mM bosutinib, or 200
mM ATP/10 mM MgCl2 for 20 mins at 4˚C. HER3 measurements were taken on an Applied Biosys-
tems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR machine, and HER2 measurements on an Applied Biosystems Quant
Studio 7 PCR machine. Data were trimmed and a Boltzmann sigmoidal curve fitted in GraphPad
Prism 6. The inflection point of the Boltzmann sigmoidal was taken as the Tm. Thermal shift DTm val-
ues were obtained by subtracting the Tm value of the kinase domain alone control.
Western blot analysis
Cells were plated at 0.5 � 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. Cells were lysed in 1x sample buffer (con-
taining 1 mM DTT), sonicated and centrifuged. After centrifugation, the lysates were subjected to
SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting.

 Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA)
CETSA was performed with COS7 cells transfected with HER3wt-RFP, HER3T787M-RFP or HER3KGG-
RFP plasmids as described in (Jafari et al., 2014; Reinhard et al., 2015). Briefly, COS7 were treated
with DMSO or 50 nM bosutinib for 1 hr at 37˚C. Cells were washed with PBS, detached and washed
again twice with cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in cold PBS with protease inhibitors
(Roche) and 100 ml of each cell suspension was transferred into 0.2 ml PCR tubes. PCR tubes were
heated for 3 min at 42˚C or 50˚C in a thermal cycler (DNA Engine DYAD, MJ research, Peltier ther-
mal cycler) and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Tubes were then immediately transferred
onto ice, 35 ml of cold PBS 1.4% NP-40 with protease inhibitors were added and tubes were snap-
frozen. Samples were then subjected to two freeze-thaw (at 25˚C) cycles and cell lysates were centri-
fuged at 20,000 g for 1 hr at 4˚C. Supernatants were carefully removed and analysed by western
blot.
