IMPORTANCE Myopia is becoming increasingly common globally and is associated with
potentially sight-threatening complications. Spending time outdoors is protective, but the
mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of myopia with ultraviolet B radiation (UVB; directly
associated with time outdoors and sunlight exposure), serum vitamin D concentrations, and
vitamin D pathway genetic variants, adjusting for years in education.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional, population-based random sample
of participants 65 years and older was chosen from 6 study centers from the European Eye
Study between November 6, 2000, to November 15, 2002. Of 4187 participants, 4166
attended an eye examination including refraction, gave a blood sample, and were interviewed
by trained fieldworkers using a structured questionnaire. Myopia was defined as a mean
spherical equivalent of âˆ’0.75 diopters or less. Exclusion criteria included aphakia,
pseudophakia, late age-related macular degeneration, and vision impairment due to cataract,
resulting in 371 participants with myopia and 2797 without.
EXPOSURES Exposure to UVB estimated by combining meteorological and questionnaire
data at different ages, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolic pathway
genes, serum vitamin D3 concentrations, and years of education.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Odds ratios (ORs) of UVB, serum vitamin D3
concentrations, vitamin D single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and myopia estimated from
logistic regression.
RESULT Of the included 3168 participants, the mean (SD) age was 72.4 (5) years, and 1456
(46.0%) were male. An SD increase in UVB exposure at age 14 to 19 years (OR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.71-0.92) and 20 to 39 years (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93) was associated with a reduced
adjusted OR of myopia; those in the highest tertile of years of education had twice the OR of
myopia (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.41-3.06). No independent associations between myopia and
serum vitamin D3 concentrations nor variants in genes associated with vitamin D metabolism
were found. An unexpected finding was that the highest quintile of plasma lutein
concentrations was associated with a reduced OR of myopia (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.72).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increased UVB exposure was associated with reduced
myopia, particularly in adolescence and young adulthood. The association was not altered
by adjusting for education. We found no convincing evidence for a direct role of vitamin D
in myopia risk. The relationship between high plasma lutein concentrations and a lower risk
of myopia requires replication.

M
yopia, or short-sightedness, is a complex trait influ-
enced by numerous environmental and genetic fac-
tors. Myopia is becoming more common world-
wide, most dramatically in urban Asia, but rises in prevalence
have also been identified in the United States and Europe.1,2
This has major implications, both visually and financially,
for the global burden from this potentially sight-threatening
condition.
An increased risk of myopia has been associated with ur-
banization,highersocioeconomicstatus,prenatalfactors,near
work, and education.2-5 The protective effect of time out-
doors on myopia has been identified in studies of school-
aged children and young adults, with replication in different
climates.6-10 A meta-analysis of 7 cross-sectional studies11
concluded that there was a 2% reduced odds of myopia per ad-
ditional hour of time spent outdoors per week. The recom-
mendation for children to spend time outdoors provides an
attractive option, and intervention studies are in progress.12
However, it remains unclear which of the numerous ele-
ments associated with time spent outdoors, such as light
intensity, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), or distant focus, con-
fers the reduced risk of myopia. Vitamin D concentrations have
been inversely associated with myopia in some but not
all studies,13-17 while genetic polymorphisms in vitamin D
pathway genes have been associated in 1 study but not in
another.13,17
We exploited the availability of relevant existing informa-
tion (ie, refractive status, UVR, education, serum vitamin D
concentrations,andgeneticpolymorphismsinvitaminDpath-
way genes) in the European Eye Study with the objective of
investigating their association with myopia.
Methods
Study Population
The European Eye Study was designed to maximize hetero-
geneity of UVR exposure and diet by selection of study cen-
ters from northern to southern Europe. Participants were re-
cruited from November 6, 2000, to November 15, 2002, from
random sampling of the population 65 years and older in the
following centers: Bergen, Norway; Tallinn, Estonia; Belfast,
United Kingdom; Paris-Creteil, France; Verona, Italy; Thessa-
loniki, Greece; and Alicante, Spain.18 More than 11 000 people
wereinvited,ofwhom5040participated(45.8%responserate).
Written informed consent was obtained from all study par-
ticipants. Ethical approval was obtained for each center from
the local ethics committee, and the research adhered to the te-
nets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Details of study design are described elsewhere.19 Par-
ticipants attended the examination center where they were
interviewed by trained fieldworkers, underwent an ophthal-
mological examination, and gave a blood sample for blood
measurements and genotyping. Information collected by the
interviewers included years of education, smoking, alcohol
use, a brief medical history, a semiquantitative food fre-
quency questionnaire, and a detailed questionnaire on out-
door exposure.
Measurement of UV Exposure
Full details of the methods have been published previously.20
Participantsweresentaresidenceandemploymenthistorysur-
vey to complete in advance to facilitate recall at the inter-
view.Weusedaquestionnairethataskedabouttimespentout-
doors between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM and between 11 AM
and 3 PM daily (from the age of 14 years) for different occupa-
tional and leisure periods (including homecare) and in retire-
ment up to current age. Information from the questionnaire
and residence calendar and geographical coordinates for resi-
dence were sent to the University of East Anglia in the United
Kingdom to generate estimates of individual years of all-day
(9 AM to 5 PM) or middle-of-the-day (11 AM and 3 PM) exposure
for different wavelengths of light (ultraviolet A, ultraviolet B
[UVB], and blue light). For all residences of 1 year or more,
ambient UVB (minimal erythema dose21) and ultraviolet A
(J/cm2) were estimated from published sources that take into
account time of day, month, and latitudinal variations.22 We
used published coefficients to adjust ambient clear-sky UV for
cloudcover23andterrain.24Foreachwavelengthoflight,maxi-
mum potential lifetime dose was calculated as the sum of the
time-weighted levels at each of the places of residence of the
individual. Personal adult lifetime (ie, from age 14 years) UV
exposure was estimated for each of the 3 wavelengths and
summed for a mean annual lifetime dose at different ages for
all-day and middle-of-the-day exposure.
Visual Acuity and Refraction
The protocol for testing visual acuity (VA) was different in 1 of
the European Eye Study centers (Alicante, Spain); data from
this center was not included in the present analysis. All other
centers followed the procedures described below. Presenting
distance VA (ie, with spectacles if worn) was tested sepa-
rately in each eye using the 4-meter ETDRS logMAR chart. Any
participant who was unable to achieve 0.3 logMAR (ie, a 20/40
Snellen acuity) in either eye underwent automated refraction
or manual retinoscopy, and their best-corrected VA was re-
corded. For persons who achieved 0.3 logMAR or better, the
spectacle correction (if any) worn by the participant for each
eye was measured by neutralization using a focimeter or
by handheld lenses. The spherical equivalent was obtained by
Key Points
Question What is the association between myopia and ultraviolet
B radiation, serum vitamin D concentrations, and polymorphisms
in vitamin D metabolism genes in a cross-sectional,
population-based random sample of participants 65 years and
older from north and south Europe?
Findings In this secondary analysis of the European Eye Study,
only ultraviolet B radiation exposure was associated with a
reduced odds ratio for myopia, especially in adolescence and early
adulthood, despite adjustment for years in education.
Meaning This study, while not designed to determine cause and
effect relationships, suggests that increased ultraviolet B
exposure, a marker of sunlight exposure, is associated with
reduced myopia.

adding half of the cylindrical value to the spherical value and
the mean of the 2 eyes was calculated, commonly used in epi-
demiologicalstudies.Myopiawasdefinedasasphericalequiva-
lent of âˆ’0.75 diopters (D) or less (low myopia, â‰¤âˆ’0.75 to >âˆ’3
D; moderate myopia, â‰¤âˆ’3 to >âˆ’6 D; severe myopia, â‰¤âˆ’6 D).
Those with a spherical equivalent greater than âˆ’0.75 D were
not considered to have myopia, nor were those with an un-
aidedVAhigherthan0.3logMARwhenrefractionwasnotmea-
sured. Participants with late age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD), aphakia or pseudophakia in either eye, or visual
impairment (ie, less than 0.5 logMAR or 20/60 Snellen acuity
or less) due to cataract were excluded.
Blood Measurement
Blood samples were sent to a single laboratory (Queenâ€™
s Uni-
versity Belfast in the United Kingdom) for analysis. Serum 25-
hydroxy vitamin D2 (25[OH]D2) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D3
(25[OH]D3) concentrations were measured by liquid chroma-
tography-tandem mass spectrometry.25 In all analyses, vita-
min D levels were adjusted for season of measurement. Plasma
lutein concentrations, zeaxanthin concentrations, Î²-crypto-
xanthin concentrations, Î±-carotene and Î²-carotene concen-
trations, Î±-tocopherol and Î³-tocopherol concentrations, lyco-
pene concentrations, and retinol concentrations were
measured by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chro-
matography. Total ascorbate was measured using an enzyme-
based assay in plasma stabilized with metaphosphoric acid. All
assays were standardized against appropriate National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology standard reference materi-
als. Cholesterol was measured using an enzymatic assay
(Randox, Crumlin) on a Cobas FARA centrifugal analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata version 13
(StataCorp). All analyses took account of the study design of
the6centersbyuseofrobusterrors.All-day(9 AMto5 PM)adult
lifetime UVB exposure and 25(OH)D3 concentrations were the
primary measures of interest, as vitamin D3 is produced in the
skin following exposure to UVB whereas vitamin D2 is mainly
derived from fortified foods and vitamin supplements.26 Fol-
lowing the exclusion of 67 participants with very high levels,
the distribution of 25(OH)D3 concentrations was normal. We
investigated 25(OH)D3 both as a continuous variable and cat-
egorized by quintiles. Dietary vitamin D was estimated using
food composition tables27 and was energy adjusted. Expo-
sure to UVB was normalized using a square root transforma-
tion and then z transformed to investigate an increase in ex-
posure of 1 SD. We calculated years of education from the
difference between the start and leaving dates and catego-
rized these data into tertiles to reflect the common tiers of edu-
cation (ie, primary, secondary, and higher) for inclusion as an
independent myopia risk factor.
We ran preliminary regression analyses to identify fac-
tors associated with changes in 25(OH)D3 concentrations and
withUVBaspossibleconfoundersofanyassociationwithmyo-
pia. A large number of variables were independently associ-
ated with 25(OH)D3 concentrations, including age, sex, sea-
son, study center, current smoking, diabetes, obesity, dietary
vitamin D intake, fish and fish oil supplement intake, and an-
tioxidants, including vitamin C, lutein (or zeaxanthin), reti-
nol,Î±-tocopherol,andcholesterol.Luteinandzeaxanthinwere
highly correlated (r = 0.85), and results were almost identical
when separately introduced into the models; we presented lu-
tein only for simplicity. Of these, only lutein was (inversely)
associated with myopia and entered the models as a poten-
tial confounder. The factors independently associated with
UVBwere25(OH)D3concentrations,studycenter,sex,andedu-
cation; only education was (positively) associated with myo-
pia. Therefore, in our final logistic regression models for myo-
pia, we retained age, sex, study center, and season as well as
our primary exposure variables (UVB, 25[OH]D3, and educa-
tion) and identified confounders, namely lutein. Our out-
come measure was the confounder-adjusted association be-
tweenmyopiaandourkeyexposuresexpressedastheadjusted
odds ratio (OR) in logistic regression.
Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Selection, Genotyping,
and Genetic Analyses
For reason of costs, genotyping was undertaken in a sub-
sample of the main study. Data on vitamin D pathway single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available for a subset
of 109 of 371 participants (29.4%) with myopia and 782 of 2797
participants (28.0%) without myopia. Ninety-three common
SNPs located across 7 genes involved in vitamin D metabo-
lismâ€”GC (10), RXRA (14), CYP2R1 (7), DHCR7 (5), VDR (29),
CYP27B1 (7), and CYP24A1 (21)â€”were selected from Phase III,
release2HapMapdataofUtahresidentswithancestryinnorth-
ern and western Europe using Haploview (http://www
.broadinstitute.org/haploview) to determine linkage
disequilibrium. Tag SNPs were selected using multimarker
tagging with the following criteria: r2 greater than 0.8, minor
allele frequency of 5% or greater, genotype call rate of 95% or
greater, and no significant deviation from Hardy Weinberg
equilibrium. Genotyping was performed by KBiosciences, and
associations between genotypes and myopia status were
investigated. Quality filters for exclusion of SNPs included call
rates less than 95% and deviation from Hardy Weinberg
equilibrium (P < .001). DNA samples were excluded if missing
genotypes exceeded 10%. Other quality control measures
included duplicates on plates, random sample allocation to
plates, independent scoring of problematic genotypes by 2
individuals, and resequencing selected DNAs to validate
genotypes. KBiosciences quality control also included
validation of all SNP assays on a panel of 44 random white
participantâ€“derived samples and 4 nontemplate (negative)
controls. Statistical genetic tests were performed using PLINK
version 1.07 under an additive genotypic model.28 Logistic
regression adjusted for age, sex, season, and study center to
examine association with individual SNPs.

phakia, 116 for late AMD, and 36 for vision impairment due to
cataract.Relevantexposuredata(mainlyserum25[OH]D3con-
centrations) were missing in 297 participants (32 with myo-
pia and 265 without myopia). Our final analysis was based on
371participantswithmyopia,ofwhich24(6.5%)hadhighmyo-
pia, and 2797 without myopia with complete data on all rel-
evant exposures. Included participants had a mean (SD) age
of 72.4 (5) years, and 1456 (46.0%) were male.
In univariate analyses, there were no differences in the age
or sex of people with myopia compared with those without,
nor in smoking habit, alcohol use, or obesity (Table 1). Signifi-
cant differences were observed between those with and with-
out myopia in years of education, UVB exposure, and serum
25(OH)D3 concentrations, but there was no difference in di-
etary vitamin D intake.
In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and study center, an in-
crease of 1 SD in personal lifetime UVB exposure was associ-
ated with reduced odds of myopia (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-
0.93; P = .001) (Table 2). Those in the highest tertile of years
of education (median, 14 years) had twice the odds of myopia
(OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.41-3.06; P = .001) compared with those
in the lowest tertile (median, 7 years). In the adjusted analy-
ses, there was no clear evidence for an association of 25
(OH)D3 concentrations (either continuous or by quintiles) with
myopia. In contrast, those in the highest quintile of plasma lu-
tein concentrations had nearly half the risk of myopia (ad-
justed OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.72) compared with the low-
est quintile. In a further model adjusted for age, sex, study
center, and season and incorporating 25(OH)D3 concentra-
tions, lutein concentrations, education, and UVB, the esti-
mates for each exposure were virtually unchanged. There was
evidence for a stronger inverse association of UVB with in-
creasing myopia severity (low myopia: OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-
1.01; P = .06; moderate myopia: OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.97;
P = .04; severe myopia: OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.25-0.63; P = .001).
We investigated whether the association with myopia and
UVB exposure varied by the personal UVB exposure experi-
enced at different ages. Significant ORs for less myopia with
increased UVB exposure were observed in adolescence and
early adulthood, between ages 14 to 19 years and 20 to 29 years
(Figure 2), but not for other age groups.
The subset of 891 patients (28.1%) with genetic data were
similar in age (mean [SD] age, 73 [5] years), sex (49% male),
and myopia severity (low myopia, 59%; moderate, 34%; and
high, 7%) to those without genetic data. Of the 93 genetic vari-
ants associated with vitamin D metabolism, 1 SNP in GC was
excluded for deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Of
the remaining SNPs, 4 were nominally associated with myo-

Discussion
We found that higher annual lifetime UVB exposure, directly
related to time outdoors and sunlight exposure, was associ-
ated with reduced odds of myopia. Exposure to UVB between
ages 14 and 29 years was associated with the highest reduc-
tion in odds of adult myopia. Myopia was more than twice as
common in participants in the highest tertile of education. The
association between UVB, education, and myopia remained
even after respective adjustment. This suggests that the high
rate of myopia associated with educational attainment is not
solely mediated by lack of time outdoors.
The protective effect of time outdoors on myopia is well
established.6-9,29 Time outdoors reflects various physiologi-
cal effects that have been associated with or hypothesized to
influence myopia, including brighter light levels,30,31 a differ-
ent spectrum of wavelengths compared with artificial light-
ing with reduced UVR, and an extended focal distance with
less hyperopic peripheral defocus.32 Ultraviolet conjunctival
autofluorescence, an indirect marker of ocular sun exposure
(in particular, UVR), is inversely associated with myopia8 and
has a stronger effect than time outdoors assessed using ques-
tionnaires. One small study33 measuring UVR using dosim-
eters found differing exposure between those with emmetro-
pia, those with stable myopia, and those with progressing
myopia.
Proposed mediating mechanisms include activation of do-
paminergic retinal amacrine cells, which are stimulated by
light31 and influence ocular axial growth,34 and higher serum
vitamin D concentrations induced by sunlight. We, like oth-
ers, did not find evidence to support the association between
myopia and serum vitamin D concentrations16 or genes in-
volved in vitamin D metabolism. A previous publication17 ex-
amined 12 SNPS from 2 vitamin D pathway genes (VDR and GC)
and reported a significant association between rs2853559 in
VDR in the overall sample of 289 participants with myopia and
81 controls and a further 3 variants in VDR within a subset of
participants with low and moderate myopia. In a more recent
publication,13 33 SNPs across 6 genes associated with vitamin
D metabolism were examined in more than 2000 individuals
in relation to both refractive error and axial length. Nominal
significance was identified for variants in CYP24A1 and VDR,

but none withstood correction for multiple testing. We inves-
tigated the association between myopia and 92 variants in vi-
tamin D metabolism genes, identifying nominal significance
in 3 SNPs in CYP2R1 and 1 SNP in CYP24A1 (not the same vari-
ant as the aforementioned study). None withstood correction
for multiple testing. We acknowledge low power for this type
of analysis, but notably, we studied more variants as well as
previously unexamined genes (ie, CYP2R1 and RXRA) in a sub-
stantial cohort.
Those in the highest fifth of plasma lutein concentrations
had approximately 40% reduced odds of myopia. We ex-
cludedthosewithlateAMDbecausewehavepreviouslyshown
an increased risk of late AMD with blue light exposure in those
with low levels of key antioxidants, including lutein.20 Sensi-
tivity analyses made no appreciable difference; myopia (OR,
0.56; 95% CI, 0.46-0.70) in the highest quintile of lutein was
similar when 72 individuals with late AMD were included or
excluded (OR, 0.57 vs 0.56). Lutein is a retinal carotenoid, re-
sponsibleformuchofthemacularpigmentopticaldensity,and
has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and structural effects in
neural tissue.35 Lutein has been associated with a reduced risk
of AMD,36 with improved contrast sensitivity in healthy
individuals,37 and (inversely) with axial length (and thus axial
myopia).38 Although limited evidence for an association be-
tween lutein and myopia is gained from this analysis and, im-
portantly, no causative role can be inferred, it does raise in-
teresting hypotheses for a potential role.
Study Limitations
This study has limitations. We retrospectively calculated UVB
exposure data through highly detailed questionnaires over the
life course and used this data together with geographically
specific, historical data on UVR. Our measure is subject to re-
call error and lacks the heightened accuracy of UV exposure
achieved with light meters. However, we do not have any rea-
son to believe that the UVB association would be biased, as
myopia was identified after the interview. A weakness of our
study was that we did not collect any data on UVB exposure
during childhood, which could be argued to be more relevant
in myopia development. However, a significant proportion of
refractiveerrordevelopsinadolescenceandearlyadulthood,39
andourresultsshowedthegreatesteffectsfortheseagegroups.
No myopia was defined either by refraction or good, unaided
VA when refraction was unknown. This definition was used
in attempt to minimize bias, but to ensure this was appropri-
ate, we performed sensitivity analyses in which those with-
out myopia were only classified on the basis of measured re-
fractive error; analysis using this definition produced very
similar results. A limitation was also that vitamin D and lu-
tein concentrations were measured in later life. The associa-
tion between myopia development and these factors may be
more relevant in younger ages. However, there is evidence, al-
beit limited, that an individualâ€™
s 25(OH)D concentrations are
reproducible over time.40 Variants in vitamin D pathway genes
are not subject to these concerns of temporality and confound-
ing (mendelian randomization); hence, any association with
myopia would strengthen a causal relationship with vitamin
D. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that vitamin D plays a role
in myopia.
Conclusions
ThisstudysuggestslifetimeexposureofUVBisassociatedwith
reduced myopia in adulthood. The protective association is
strongest with exposure in adolescence and younger adult life
and with increasing severity of myopia. As the protective ef-
fect of time spent outdoors is increasingly used in clinical in-
terventions, a greater understanding of the mechanisms and
life stages at which benefit is conferred is warranted.
