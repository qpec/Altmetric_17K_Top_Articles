ABSTRACT
Background: Food fortification has been recommended to improve a
population’s micronutrient status. Biofortification techniques modestly
elevate the zinc content of cereals, but few studies have reported a
positive impact on functional indicators of zinc status.
Objective: We determined the impact of a modest increase in di-
etary zinc that was similar to that provided by biofortification pro-
grams on whole-body and cellular indicators of zinc status.
Design: Eighteen men participated in a 6-wk controlled consump-
tion study of a low-zinc, rice-based diet. The diet contained 6 mg
Zn/d for 2 wk and was followed by 10 mg Zn/d for 4 wk. To reduce
zinc absorption, phytate was added to the diet during the initial
period. Indicators of zinc homeostasis, including total absorbed zinc
(TAZ), the exchangeable zinc pool (EZP), plasma and cellular zinc
concentrations, zinc transporter gene expression, and other meta-
bolic indicators (i.e., DNA damage, inflammation, and oxidative
stress), were measured before and after each dietary-zinc period.
Results: TAZ increased with increased dietary zinc, but plasma zinc
concentrations and EZP size were unchanged. Erythrocyte and leukocyte
zinc concentrations and zinc transporter expressions were not altered.
However, leukocyte DNA strand breaks decreased with increased dietary
zinc, and the level of proteins involved in DNA repair and antioxidant and
immune functions were restored after the dietary-zinc increase.
Conclusions: A moderate 4-mg/d increase in dietary zinc, similar to
that which would be expected from zinc-biofortified crops, im-
proves zinc absorption but does not alter plasma zinc. The repair
of DNA strand breaks improves, as do serum protein concentra-
tions that are associated with the DNA repair process. This trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02861352.

INTRODUCTION
The dependence on cereal-based diets in lower-income
countries has led to the development of fortification programs
to enhance the micronutrient amounts of staple food crops in-
cluding rice, wheat, and maize. Because of the need for adequate
zinc intakes to support optimal child health and growth and for
normal pregnancy outcomes, .30 countries have initiated zinc-
fortification programs (1). In addition to adding zinc to various
cereal flours postharvest, biofortification methods (i.e., selective
breeding and the use of zinc-containing fertilizers) have been used
to increase the zinc concentrations in crops (2, 3). For example,
Bangladeshi researchers increased the rice zinc concentration by
50%, from 16 to 24 parts per million (ppm)5, through biofortification
methods (4). In populations who derive w80% of their total energy
intake from rice, as is the case in very poor households, a 50% in-
crease in the rice zinc concentration would translate to an additional
w4 mg Zn/d in the total diet. Previous studies have shown that,
when infants or children are fed zinc-fortified cereals, the additional
zinc that is provided by the crop ranges from only 1.5 to 3 mg/d (5).
Although zinc fortification is a safe strategy for enhancing zinc in-
takes of populations, none of the cereal-based zinc-fortification
programs had a positive effect on child growth or morbidity.
In addition to influencing growth and morbidity, zinc atten-
uates oxidant stress over the range of usual zinc intakes, and in
that capacity, zinc modulates DNA damage (6, 7). Increased zinc
availability reduces the amounts of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and

 chemokines (8–10). An attack by ROS is one of the primary en-
dogenous causes of the thousands of lesions of cellular DNA per day
(11). However, modest changes in dietary zinc can modulate DNA
damage primarily by reducing cellular oxidative stress (7). In a
study of adult men, we showed that leukocytic DNA strand breaks
increased when only 4 mg Zn/d was consumed, and the number of
breaks declined when dietary zinc was increased to 11 mg/d (12).
This association between zinc, oxidative stress, and inflammation
may explain the association between zinc and chronic disease (13).
To our knowledge, the effect of modest increases in dietary
zinc on DNA damage, as would occur when zinc-fortified cereals
are added to the diet, has not been previously studied. We hy-
pothesized that an increase in cellular oxidative stress and DNA
damage is one of the earlier signs of reductions in cellular zinc (7,
14); therefore, a modest increase in dietary zinc would reduce
DNA damage and alter the concentrations of serum proteins that
are involved in DNA repair, oxidative stress, and inflammation.
We also hypothesized that this modest 4-mg increase in dietary
zinc would not increase plasma zinc concentrations (PZCs) or the
size of the exchangeable zinc pool (EZP). If confirmed, these
findings would provide a zinc functional biomarker that is
sensitive to modest physiologic changes in dietary zinc.
METHODS
Study design
Eighteen healthy men were recruited from March 2012 to July
2013 to participate in a nonblinded, randomized, controlled, 6-wk
zinc depletion and repletion study. After a 3-d run-in period, the
men consumed a controlled diet that provided 6 mg Zn/d for 2 wk
[metabolic period 1 (MP1)]. A total of 1.5 g sodium phytate,
which would bring the diet phytate:zinc molar ratio to 44, was
distributed evenly into 3 meals to facilitate zinc depletion by
limiting zinc absorption. Thereafter, dietary zinc was increased to
10 mg/d by adding a total of 4 mg exogenous zinc (i.e., 1.33 mg
Zn/meal) into the rice portion of the meal for the remaining 4 wk.
The rice was cooked in a conventional rice cooker according to
the manufacturer’s instructions at 360 mL H2O/240 mL rice for
30 min or until all free water was absorbed. Rice was allowed to
cool before the application of a sterile solution of 1 mg zinc
chloride/mL directly to the rice. The rice was allowed to fully
absorb the zinc solution before packaging. Portions of each
batch of rice were also taken for a zinc analysis. In this second
metabolic period, the additional phytate was discontinued. The
men were not confined to a metabolic unit, but they came to the
clinical site to have their vital signs checked and to pick up their
food 2 times/wk. Fasting blood samples were collected at the
beginning of the study (day 1) and at the end of MP1 and
metabolic period 2 (MP2) (i.e., days 15 and 43).
Ethics
The Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute In-
stitutional Review Board approved the study, and written in-
formed consent was obtained from each participant.
Participants
Healthy adult men, who were aged 19–45 y with BMI (in
kg/m2) between 18 and 30, participated in the study. Before the
study, the men discontinued any dietary supplements that con-
tained zinc for $4 wk. Inclusion criteria consisted of a baseline
PZC .60 mg/dL and usual zinc intake, as estimated from a 24-h
dietary recall, of .9.5 mg Zn/d. Exclusion criteria included a self-
report of chronic or acute diseases (including diabetes or asthma),
the use of medications for a metabolic disorder (including statins
or diuretics), and evidence of alcohol abuse or use of illicit drugs.
Participant height was measured at the first clinical visit, and body
weight was measured 2 times/wk during the study. Body com-
position was measured at the beginning of the study and at the end
of MP2 (i.e., days 1 and 43) with the use of a BOD POD whole-
body air-displacement plethysmography device (COSMED USA).
Study diets
The study diet consisted of a 4-d cycle menu with 80% of
energy from carbohydrate, 10% of energy from protein, and 10%
of energy from fat. A description of the menus is shown in
Supplemental Table 1. The macronutrient composition of the
study diet was determined with the use of the University of
Minnesota Nutrition Data System for Research 2010 (Nutrition
Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota). Participants
were permitted to add salt and pepper to the meals and to
consume tap water ad libitum. Consumption of alcoholic drinks,
soda, and other beverages were not allowed. Participants came
to the clinical site biweekly to return food containers and to pick
up food for the next 3–4 d. Any uneaten food was recorded at
this time. The study coordinator also regularly observed food
consumption in person or by video conferencing, which was
scheduled during meal times via the Google Hangout platform
(Google Inc.).
Energy requirements of the volunteers were estimated with the
use of the resting metabolic rates that were calculated with the use
of the BOD POD device at the start of the study and self-reported
physical activity levels. Individual adjustments in dietary energy
to maintain body weight were made by adding 1 of 2 zinc-free
beverages with the same distribution of energy sources as in the
overall study diet (Supplemental Table 1). Total energy intakes
ranged from 2500 to 3000 kcal/d.
A macronutrient and micronutrient analysis was performed on
duplicate portions of all meals for each of the 4 d in a cycle. The
meals were homogenized and blended into whole-day compos-
ites. An additional complete meal was saved from each meal-
preparation batch. Food and beverages were combined in a
large commercial blender until fully liquefied. Only the blender
blades were metal, and there was no obvious corrosion damage.
The composite samples were batched at 2208C. Mineral con-
centrations, including zinc, were analyzed with the use of in-
ductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry
(ICP-OES) (Varian Vista Pro). The ICP-OES was calibrated
with the use National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST)–traceable elemental standards and routinely validated
with the use of NIST-traceable 1577b bovine-liver reference
material and Seronorm Trace Element Serum Levels 1 and 2
(Sero AS). The mean daily mineral amounts of the diet were
as follows: 6.4 6 1.5 mg Zn, 7.9 6 2.1 mg Fe, 1.6 6 0.5 mg Cu,
414.5 6 24.9 mg Ca, 824.6 6 148.7 mg P, and 250.0 6 34.5 mg
Mg. Although some of these mineral intakes were below Rec-
ommended Dietary Allowances (15), supplements were not
provided in this short-term study. Phytate concentrations were

 measured with the use of high-performance anion-exchange
chromatography followed by conductivity detection (16).
Blood sampling and processing
Fasting blood samples were drawn between 0700 and 0900 at
the beginning of the study (day 1) and at the end of each met-
abolic period (days 15 and 43). Trace metal–free certified
evacuated tubes containing K2EDTA (Becton-Dickson) were
used for the zinc measurements, the complete blood count, DNA
integrity, and plasma protein concentrations. PAXGene tubes
(Becton-Dickson) were used to collect samples for gene-expression
measurements. Blood in the K2EDTA evacuated tubes was
centrifuged at 800 3 g for 15 min at 48C before removing the
plasma, leukocytes, and erythrocytes. The plasma was further
centrifuged at 3000 3 g for 10 min at 48C to remove any re-
maining leukocytes and was stored at 2808C. Isolated leuko-
cytes were washed twice with 10 vol RBC Lysis Solution
(0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.3 mM EDTA; pH = 7.5)
to remove contaminating erythrocytes, and the leukocytes were
pelleted by centrifugation (500 3 g for 10 min at 48C). Isolated
erythrocytes and leukocytes were suspended in a Cell Wash So-
lution (50 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl; pH = 7.4) and
counted with the use of an automated complete blood count in-
strument (ADVIA 120 Hematology System; Siemens Healthcare
GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Predetermined
amounts of erythrocytes and leukocytes were pelleted by centri-
fugation (500 3 g for 10 min at 48C), cleared of supernatant fluid,
and frozen at 2808C for analysis. Whole blood was also run on
the ADVIA 120 Hematology System to monitor standard hema-
tologic variables.
Elemental analysis
Composite food, plasma, and blood cell zinc concentrations
were determined with the use of ICP-OES (17–20). Briefly,
samples were fully dissolved in 0.25 mL OmniTrace 70% HNO3
(EMD Chemicals) by microwave digestion with the use of a
MARS5 Microwave Digestion Oven (CEM) at 1008C for 15 min.
Samples were diluted to 5% HNO3 with OmniTrace water (EMD
Chemicals), clarified by centrifugation (3000 3 g for 10 min),
and analyzed with the use of a Vista Pro ICP-OES (Varian Vista
Pro). The ICP-OES was calibrated with the use of NIST-traceable
elemental standards and validated with the use of NIST-traceable
1577b bovine-liver reference material. Zinc was measured at the
213-nm wavelength with a detection range between 0.005 and
5 ppm and a CV for interassay precision ,10%. Cesium (50 ppm)
was used for ionization suppression and yttrium (5 ppm) was used
as an internal standard for all samples. All reagents and plastic
ware were certified or routinely tested for trace-metal work. Zinc
concentrations were expressed per volume (plasma) or per cell
number (erythrocytes and leukocytes). Plasma and erythrocytes
samples were analyzed in triplicate, and leukocyte samples were
analyzed in duplicate. All samples from each participant were
analyzed in the same run.
Stable-isotope preparation
Zinc stable isotopes 67Zn (93.1% enriched) and 70Zn (89.6%
enriched) were purchased as zinc oxide salts (Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory). The zinc salts were dissolved in concentrated
hydrochloric acid (4.5 mL HCl/mg ZnO) (Optima grade, A-466;
Fisher Scientific), diluted with triply deionized water to a final
concentration of 1.0 mg 67Zn/mL or 0.1 mg 70Zn/mL, and fil-
tered through a 0.22-mM filter (Millipore). The zinc solutions
were tested for sterility and pyrogenicity and stored in in-
dividual, sealed, sterile vials by the School of Pharmacy, Uni-
versity of California at San Francisco, for use by intravenous
administration.
Isotope administration and measurement
Stable isotopes were administered on days 4 and 18 for
measuring fractional zinc absorption (FZA), total absorbed zinc
(TAZ), and the EZP. 70Zn was also infused on day 46 for
measuring the EZP after MP2. For the studies of zinc absorption
on days 4 and 18, participants were fed the first day of the 4-d
study-diet rotation. A total of 1 mg 67Zn was divided into 3
equal doses (w0.33 mg) and added as a fortificant to each meal.
Phytate was not added to the 3 study meals on the isotope ad-
ministration day to prevent interference with the isotope mea-
surements. One hour after the dinner meal, 0.1 mg 70Zn was
infused into the antecubital vein over 1–2 min. The catheter
tubing was flushed with 3 mL sterile saline. The exact amount of
tracer infused was determined from the difference in syringe
weight before and after the infusion. The first urinary void was
collected for 5 d (days 3–7) after each isotope infusion for the
measurement of zinc isotopic ratios.
Stable-isotope analysis
Zinc isotopic ratios were analyzed in the urine samples with
the use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as
reported previously (18–20). Urinary macrominerals were re-
moved by adjusting the sample pH to 5.3 and applying the
sample to chelating resin (Chelex 100; Bio-Rad). The samples
were purified with the use of ion-exchange chromatography
(AG8; Bio-Rad), and pure zinc was eluted with 0.0005 N HCl,
evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 1% HNO3 for in-
ductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis. The
tracer:tracee method (67Zn:66Zn and 70Zn: 66Zn) was used to
estimate the FZA with the use of a modification of the double-
isotope tracer method (21). TAZ was calculated by multiplying
total the amount of dietary zinc per day by the FZA. The EZP
was estimated with the use of modifications of the Miller
method in which urine tracer:tracee ratios were graphed onto a
semilog plot to extrapolate the size of the pool at the time of
infusion with the use of the y intercept (22).
DNA integrity
DNA single-strand breaks in peripheral blood cells were de-
termined with the use of a comet assay as described by Singh
et al. (23). Briefly, 500 mL fresh whole blood was cryopreserved
in liquid nitrogen. Cryopreserved blood was thawed rapidly and
centrifuged at 400 3 g for 5 min. Cell pellets were mixed with
500 mL of 0.5% low–melting point agarose at w378C and ap-
plied onto microscope slides (Trevigen). Slides were incubated
in lysis buffer (Trevigen) for 1 h, and DNA was allowed to
unwind in alkali buffer (0.3 M NaOH/L and 1 mmol/L EDTA)
for 20 min. Slides were electrophoresed for 20 min at 300 mA
and 15 V and neutralized with 0.4 M Tris/L (pH = 7.5). The

 slides were washed in cold 100% methanol and 100% ethanol
for 5 min each and air dried for storage. Immediately before
analysis, nuclear material was stained with 65 mL 13 SYBR
Green (Life Technologies)/field. Comet measurements were
made with the use of a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescent microscope
(Zeiss) and Komet 6 software (Andor Technology). Images of
300 randomly selected nuclei (150 nuclei from each of 2 rep-
licate slides) were analyzed from each sample. No identifying
information was available to the laboratory technicians who
performed the assay. The olive tail moment was used to indicate
DNA damage. The intraindividual variation was minimized with
the use of each individual as his own control and a paired-
analysis approach. For detecting oxidized bases, a digestion
step with a bacterial repair enzyme was included in the alkaline
comet assay before electrophoresis in accordance with the
modified protocols of Collins et al. (24). Briefly, after the lysis
step, slides were washed 3 times in enzyme buffer (40 mmol
HEPES/L, 100 mmol KCl/L, 0.5 mmol Na2EDTA/L, and 0.2 mg
bovine serum albumin/mL; pH 8.0) and incubated with 100 mU
formamidopyrimidine DNA-glycosylase (FPG) (New England
Biolabs) for 30 min at 378C. Amounts of oxidized sites were
calculated from the olive tail moment score that was obtained
with the enzyme minus the score that was obtained without the
enzyme.
Proteomic analysis
The SOMAscan proteomic assay (SomaLogic Inc.) was used
to measure 1129 proteins in plasma samples that collected at the
end of MP1 and MP2 (days 15 and 43). The assay has been
described more extensively elsewhere (25) and on the SomaLogic
Inc. website (http://www.somalogic.com/Products-Services/
SOMAscan/FAQs.aspx). Proteins were measured with the
use of a SOMAmer-based capture array (SomaLogic Inc.)
SOMAmers are single-stranded DNA aptamers, which include
some bases that have been chemically modified to mimic protein
side chains while retaining the ability to pair with standard DNA
bases [allowing their amounts to be quantified with the use of a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or microarrays]. A total of 1129
of these SOMAmers are currently available, and they can be used
to analyze a biological sample in such a way that the amount of
each type of SOMAmer that remains in the sample is proportional
to the amount of the corresponding protein targets in the original
sample. Currently, one-third of SOMAmers have been assessed
for specificity with the use of a pulldown and mass spectrometry.
Proteomic data were collected with the use of a fluorescent
imager (SOMAscan v3; SomaLogic Inc.) for the measurement of
1129 proteins. Quality control was performed at the sample and
SOMAmer levels and involved the use of control SOMAmers on
the microarray and calibration samples. At the sample level,
hybridization controls on the microarray were used to monitor the
sample-by-sample hybridization variability, whereas the median
signal over all SOMAmers was used to monitor the overall
technical variability. The resulting hybridization scale factor and
median scale factor were used to normalize data across samples.
Plasma samples from subjects at the 2 time points were randomly
assigned to plates within the array and analyzed along with a set
of calibration and normalization samples. No identifying in-
formation was available to the laboratory technicians who per-
formed the assay. All samples passed quality-control criteria and
were used for the analysis. The SOMAscan proteomic data are
reported in relative fluorescence units. Relative fluorescence-unit
data were log-transformed before the statistical analysis to reduce
heteroscedasticity.
Preparation of leukocyte total RNA and real-time PCR
analysis of zinc transporter expression
Blood collected in PAXGene tubes was incubated at room
temperature for 2 h and immediately frozen at 2808C until
analysis. RNA extraction was completed with the use of a
PAXgene Blood RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Total RNA was treated with DNase 1 to avoid
any DNA contamination. The concentrations and purities of the
extracted RNA samples were evaluated by measuring absor-
bance at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths with the use of a spec-
trophotometer (NanoDrop; Thermo); only samples with optical
density 260:optical density 280 values $1.8 were used in the
analysis. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 mg total
RNA with the use of a QuantiTect RT kit (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Relative messenger RNA (mRNA)
concentrations of specific zinc transporter genes were measured
with the use of a quantitative real-time PCR. All quantitative
real-time PCR assays were conducted with SYBR Green dye
(Qiagen) on an ABI 7900 HT system (Life Technologies). All
primers were designed with the use of a Universal Probe Library
System Assay Design (Roche) (Supplemental Table 2). The
specificity of each primer pair was confirmed with the use of
melting curve analyses, and the relative quantity was determined
by normalization with respective 18S RNA and b-actin values
with the use of the DD threshold cycle method.
Sample-size calculations and statistical analysis
We planned to enroll 20 men, which, according to previous
research, would have enabled us to determine a 5% difference in
FZAwithin subjects between the 2 metabolic periods with a = 0.05
and b = 0.20 (20, 26). On the basis of a sample of 18 men and the
observed variation in FZA, we were able to detect a within-subject
difference in FZA of 8%.
Statistics
Descriptive statistics (means 6 SDs) were computed for each
of the dependent variables at baseline and the end of MP1 and
MP2. Pearson correlations were computed between PZCs and
variables of whole-body zinc homeostasis (i.e., EZP, FZA,
and TAZ), total and oxidized markers of DNA damage, and
serum proteins associated with DNA damage, oxidative stress,
and inflammation. Differences between MP1 and MP2 were
determined for all endpoints with the use of linear models with
generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mea-
sures of a subject. Pairwise significant differences were assessed
with the use of Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 soft-
ware (SAS Institute), and P = 0.05 was used as the cutoff for
statistical significance except for differences in serum proteins
between MP1 and MP2 when P # 0.01 was used to account
for the number of multiple comparisons. This P value was ar-
bitrarily chosen for multiple comparisons (n = 1129) between

 serum proteins because it was more conservative and appropri-
ate for the large number of variables analyzed.
RESULTS
To determine the effects of modest increases in dietary zinc on
measures of zinc status and metabolic functions, we conducted a
6-wk consumption study in which participants were provided
3 meals/d with controlled amounts of zinc. Eighteen healthy men
participated in the study (Table 1). The ethnicity of participants
was diverse and reflected an attempt to recruit participants who
were accustomed to eating a rice-based diet. The initial mean
BMI and mean 6 SD total body weight of participants were 22
and 68 6 5 kg, respectively, with 16% as fat. The mean 6 SD
prestudy dietary zinc intake from 10 of the men was 13.0 6
6.5 mg/d, which provided 1980 6 912 kcal/d. The mean 6 SD
initial PZCs averaged 75 6 10 mg/dL; none of the men had
initial values ,60 mg/dL. Blood hemoglobin concentrations
were normal in all of the men. None of the measured hemato-
logic variables or other health indicators changed significantly
during the study (Supplemental Table 3).
The study diet, with protein sources that were limited to egg
whites, fish, and chicken breasts, provided 6.4 6 1.5 mg Zn/d
(Table 2). The mean total phytate content of the study diet was
0.7 g/d. In MP1, when 1.5 g exogenous phytate was added to the
diet, mean phytate intake was 2.2 g/d, and the phytate:zinc
molar ratio was 35.1. PZCs did not change during the study
(Table 2). The size of the EZP tended to increase by w15%
during MP2 (P = 0.058). Because the EZP is located within the
fat-free mass, the size of the EZP per kilogram of fat-free mass
was calculated, and it did not differ between MP1 and MP2. The
FZA decreased significantly from 35% to 28% between MP1
and MP2, respectively (P , 0.005), but TAZ increased from 2.1
to 2.8 mg/d, respectively (P , 0.005).
In addition to whole-body homeostatic biomarkers of zinc
status, we measured the blood cell zinc content and the ex-
pression of some leukocytic zinc transporters (Table 3). The
4-mg increase in dietary zinc between MP1 and MP2 did not
increase erythrocyte or leukocytic zinc concentrations. Relative
to the baseline, the gene expression for the zinc importers (Zip1,
Zip4, and Zip8) and the zinc exporters (ZnT7 and ZnT1) did not
significantly change over the course of the study. Metallothionein
(Mt2a) gene expression also did not change.
DNA single-strand breaks were measured as a cellular zinc
functional biomarker at baseline and at the end of the low and
moderate zinc metabolic periods (Figure 1). DNA damage, as
indicated by the olive tail moment, increased from baseline
(14.5% 6 4.7%) to the end of the low-zinc period (MP1) (23.0%
6 6.3%; P , 0.001) and decreased by the end of the higher-zinc
period (MP2) (12.2% 6 3.7%; P , 0.001). DNA strand breaks
can occur as a result of either DNA damage or repair. We also
measured the number of strand breaks that were generated in
response to the addition of FPG, which is an enzyme that re-
moves oxidized purines. Compared with baseline, the number of
FPG-sensitive strand breaks that resulted from oxidized purines
increased significantly with the low-zinc diet (MP1) (Figure 1).
However, at the end of MP2, the number of DNA strand breaks
that were generated by oxidative DNA damage was not signif-
icantly different from that at the end of MP1 or at baseline.
Thus, the additional 4 mg Zn/d that was consumed for 4 wk
reduced the overall DNA damage, but it did not fully promote
the repair of oxidized lesions.

 to a 4-mg change in dietary zinc, we measured the concentrations
of 1129 serum proteins with the use of the SOMAscan proteomic
assay. The statistical analysis, with the use of paired t tests,
showed that 116 proteins changed significantly (P , 0.01) be-
tween the 2 metabolic periods (Supplemental Table 4). With
the addition of 4 mg dietary zinc, the amounts of 61 proteins
decreased, of which the majority were proinflammatory in na-
ture. The amounts of 55 proteins increased, most of which were
involved in an adaptive immune function or cellular metabolism.
To better understand the metabolic basis of the DNA strand
breaks, we identified the proteins that are involved in the fol-
lowing 3 key areas where zinc function maybe implicated: 1)
DNA damage and repair, 2) oxidative stress, and 3) the response
to inflammation (Table 4). Proteins that are involved in the in-
flammatory response were analyzed because it has been shown
that inflammation is secondary to DNA damage and oxidative
stress (27, 28). For example, of the 5 DNA-damage proteins that
we identified, 2 repair proteins [high-mobility group protein B1
(HMGB1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2N] increased
significantly with the addition of 4 mg dietary zinc. Concomi-
tantly, proteins reflecting DNA strand breaks [TNF receptor
superfamily member 1B, importin subunit a-1, and E3 ubiquitin-
protein ligase (Mdm2)] decreased during the same time pe-
riod. In category 2 (oxidative stress), plasma antioxidants (i.e.,
peroxiredoxin-1, ferritin, and catalase) increased with the added
dietary zinc, whereas proteins that are involved in ROS formation
decreased (i.e., lactoperoxidase). In category 3 (inflammation),
anti-inflammatory proteins increased (i.e., apolipoprotein A-I,
HMGB1, and IL-2 receptor subunit a), whereas proteins that are
involved in the response to inflammation decreased (i.e., fi-
brinogen, resistin, and fibronectin fragment 4) with the ad-
ditional dietary zinc. Taken together, these results show that
metabolic functions that are associated with maintaining DNA
integrity improved with the addition of a small amount of die-
tary zinc despite an absence in the response of traditional zinc-
status biomarkers.
To determine whether these metabolic bioindicators are more
sensitive than traditional zinc biomarkers to changes in dietary
zinc, we correlated the changes in PZCs and EZP sizes with
changes in the previously detailed proteins between MP1 and
MP2. Plasma zinc and the size of the EZP did not correlate
significantly with any of the responsive proteins (data not shown).
However, the changes in oxidative DNA damage, as measured
by FPG comets, which occurred with the dietary-zinc change,
were correlated significantly with changes in HMGB1 (r = 0.896,
P = 0.0002), which is a marker of inflammation that is spe-
cifically involved in endotoxin binding to lipopolysaccharide-
binding protein and to prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (r = 0.82,
P = 0.02), which is a marker of peroxidase activity. These data
suggest that DNA strand breaks (both total and oxidized) are

sponse to dietary zinc.
DISCUSSION
A short-term moderate increase in dietary zinc from 6 to 10 mg/d
caused a reduction in leukocyte DNA damage and significant
changes in concentrations of serum proteins that are associated with
DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation. These shifts in
dietary zinc–related functions occurred without a change in
plasma, erythrocyte, or leukocyte zinc concentrations or the EZP
size. Also, the gene expression for 5 key zinc transporters and for
metallothionein 2a in leukocytes did not respond to the modest
increase in dietary zinc. Previous reports of changes in the gene
expression of zinc transporters or metallothionein occurred with
larger changes in dietary zinc (29–31).
The comet assay has been used previously in several human-
intervention trials to measure DNA single-strand breaks from
peripheral blood cells (12, 23, 32). In a previous zinc depletion–
zinc repletion study by our group, DNA damage increased sig-
nificantly in healthy men after the consumption of a diet that
provided 4 mg Zn/d for 6 wk, including a formula diet that
provided 0.6 mg Zn/d during the first week. Repletion with
11 mg Zn/d for 4 wk with a 20-mg Zn supplement for the first
7 d ameliorated the DNA damage. Although PZCs did not
change significantly during zinc depletion in that study, there
was a negative correlation between PZCs and DNA damage in
the 9 men. DNA strand breaks also declined significantly in a
group of Ethiopian women who were given 20 mg supplemental
zinc/d for 17 d (32). This change occurred without an overall
increase in PZCs, but PZCs and DNA strand breaks were neg-
atively correlated at the end of the study. Intracellular DNA
strand breaks, which are a potential functional indicator of zinc
status, appeared to be sensitive to small changes in dietary zinc,
which suggested that DNA integrity is one of the first metabolic
functions to improve with modest increases in zinc intake.
In the proteomic analysis, 26 proteins that are involved with
DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation responded to an
increase of 4 mg dietary zinc (Table 4). For example, the amount
of proteins that are associated with DNA repair was greater at the
end of MP2 (i.e., HMGB1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
E2N). HMGB1 maintains the integrity of DNA by several
mechanisms including participating in nucleotide excision repair,
mismatch repair, base-excision repair, and double-strand break
repair (33). In addition, HMGB1 has been postulated to be a
redox and inflammation sensor (34).
Zinc may also prevent DNA damage by protecting cellular
components from oxidation. Although zinc is a redox inert metal
and does not participate in oxidation-reduction reactions (35), it
can reduce oxidant stress by protecting protein sulfhydryl groups
from oxidation by antagonizing redox-active transition metals
such as iron or copper, thereby preventing their oxidation of
protein sulfhydryl groups (36). An example of this function was
the significant increase in ferritin when dietary zinc was increased

MODEST INCREASES IN DIETARY ZINC REDUCE DNA DAMAGE

 (Table 4). Ferritin reduces protein oxidation by binding and
converting redox-active iron to a nontoxic form. The role of zinc
in protein folding and enabling the proper functioning of proteins
may explain how an increase in peroxiredoxin-1, which is a
cysteine-rich protein with both antioxidant and protein-folding
chaperone functions, is linked to reduced oxidative stress. The
increase in peroxiredoxin-1 with the dietary zinc increase may
have enabled appropriate protein folding that facilitated its
function as an antioxidant (37).
Zinc reduces oxidative stress and also limits the formation of
inflammatory cytokines by upregulating the zinc-finger protein
A20, which inhibits nuclear transcription factor kB activation
(35). When dietary zinc was increased by 4 mg/d in this study,
the proteins that are associated with an increase in inflammation
(i.e., fibrinogen, resistin, and TNF ligand superfamily member 6,
soluble form) declined, whereas the proteins that are linked to a
decrease in inflammation increased (i.e., apolipoprotein A-I,
HMGB1, and IL-2 receptor subunit a). To our knowledge, the
relation between apolipoprotein A-I and plasma zinc has not
been studied, but low zinc availability in the media of a human
liver cancer cell line reduced apolipoprotein A-I mRNA (38).
However, human as well as tissue-culture studies have shown
that zinc is required for IL-2 receptor subunit a expression and
for reducing the underlying inflammation that accompanies a
decline in IL-2 receptor subunit a mRNA (39, 40).
Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation play causative roles
in the development of chronic diseases including cancers, ath-
erosclerosis, and other degenerative disorders. Our results sug-
gest that subclinical zinc deficiencies may shift cellular metabolic
functions in a manner that increases chronic disease risk. Epi-
demiologic studies have reported associations between zinc and
risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (41–45), but
to our knowledge, this is the first human study to show that a
moderate increase in dietary zinc alters underlying cellular
changes that are associated with subsequent disease risk. Further
studies are needed to show that a moderate increase in dietary
zinc could positively influence biomarkers that are associated
with these diseases.
To date, stunting and an increased risk of gastrointestinal or
pulmonary infections are the 2 primary functional consequences
of zinc deficiency in humans. On the basis of the current study
and studies reported by other authors (12, 32), we suggest that
DNA damage should be considered a functional indicator of
human zinc deficiency. The use of comet assay as a functional
indicator of zinc nutrition has several advantages over the as-
sessment of incidences of stunting and morbidity. First, it can be
used in studies of adults as well as children. Second, unlike
stunting and increased morbidity, it is very sensitive to small
changes in dietary zinc, and third, it requires very little blood,
which makes it possible to do the analyses of a finger-stick
sample that is drawn in a field setting. The association be-
tween DNA damage and dietary zinc appears to be stronger than
that with PZCs. The same is true for stunting (46). Although
PZCs respond readily to oral zinc supplements that are taken
without food, plasma zinc does not decline with lower dietary
zinc until intakes are ,3 mg/d (47). Thus, these zinc-related
functions appear to be more sensitive to changes in the dietary
zinc supply than are PZCs. However, this DNA damage is not
specific for low zinc intake. DNA strand breaks also increase
with low intakes of folate and vitamin B-6 (48, 49).
The multiple metabolic responses to a marginal increase in
dietary zinc that were observed in this study suggest that the
framework that is used to evaluate zinc status needs to be
modified. Modest changes in dietary zinc, as is typical with
changes in the composition of human diets, caused a shift in the
serum concentrations of multiple proteins, thereby reflecting
several metabolic functions rather than a single, specific bio-
marker. Proteins that are associated with preventing DNA
damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation changed without any
changes in PZCs. We suggest that a combination of endpoints that
are linked to a key metabolic function (i.e., DNA damage) can be
used as bioindicators of the relation between zinc nutrition and a
nonspecific functional outcome. For example, a shift in a few of
the zinc-sensitive proteins that are involved in DNA damage
(e.g., peroxiredoxin-1, ferritin, fibrinogen, and resistin) could
be used to confirm that dietary zinc inadequacy contributes to
the observed DNA lesions.
In conclusion, we show that a moderate increase in dietary
zinc, which is similar to that when regular rice is replaced with
zinc-biofortified rice, reduces DNA strand breaks and alters
circulating concentrations of plasma proteins that are involved in
DNA repair, oxidative stress, and inflammation. DNA damage is
not a specific bioindicator of zinc nutrition. Nevertheless, DNA
damage can serve as a bioindicator of zinc nutrition when mea-
surements of zinc-sensitive proteins like peroxiredoxin-1, ferritin,
fibrinogen, and resistin are also taken into consideration.
