Abstract
BACKGROUND—Early introduction of peanut is an effective strategy to prevent peanut allergy 
in high-risk infants; however, feasibility and effects on growth and nutritional intake are unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the feasibility of introducing peanut in infancy and explore effects on 
growth and nutritional intake up to 60 months of age.
METHODS—In the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial, 640 atopic infants aged 
4-11 months were randomly assigned to consume (6g peanut protein/week) or avoid peanut until 
60 months of age. Peanut consumption and early feeding practices were assessed by questionnaire. 
Dietary intake was evaluated with prospective food diaries. Anthropometric measurements were 
taken at all study visits.
RESULTS—Peanut was successfully introduced and consumed until 60 months with median 
peanut protein intake of 7.5g/week (IQR 6.0-9.0) in the consumption group compared to 0g in the 
avoidance group. Introduction of peanut in breastfeeding infants did not affect the duration of 
breastfeeding. There were no differences in anthropometric measurements or energy intakes

 between groups at any visits. Regular peanut consumption led to differences in dietary intakes. 
Consumers had higher intakes of fat and avoiders had higher carbohydrate intakes; differences 
were greatest at the upper quartiles of peanut consumption. Protein intakes remained consistent 
between groups.
CONCLUSIONS—Introduction of peanut proved feasible in infants at high-risk of peanut allergy 
and did not affect the duration of breastfeeding nor impact negatively on growth or nutrition. 
Energy balance was achieved in both groups through variations in intakes from fat and 
carbohydrate while protein homeostasis was maintained.

INTRODUCTION
We recently reported that early introduction of dietary peanut results in a marked reduction 
in the development of peanut allergy in high-risk infants.(1) The LEAP Study intervention 
disagrees with current WHO advice which recommends that infants should be exclusively 
breastfed for the first six months of life (no other food or water).(2) Similar to the dietary 
practices in the USA and Australia, the mean age of introduction of peanut-containing foods 
in the UK is 36 months and only around 8-10% of infants eat peanut before one year of age.
(3-5)
Many professional allergy societies now recommend the LEAP Study intervention of early 
peanut introduction in infancy followed by ongoing regular consumption until 60 months of 
age for the prevention of peanut allergy in high-risk infants.(6-8) This advice may in time be 
extended to encompass all children regardless of their risk of peanut allergy. Whilst regular 
consumption of peanut from an early age appears to be an effective strategy for the 
prevention of peanut allergy in high-risk infants as well as in infants recruited from a general 
population, there could be unexpected consequences for growth and nutrition. (1,9) 
Anecdotally, no adverse health consequences have been associated with this practice in 
countries such as Israel, where peanut is regularly consumed by infants and young children. 
Epidemiological studies describe beneficial health effects of regular nut consumption in 
children and adolescents including a lower body mass index (BMI), a higher healthy eating 
index and higher intakes of micronutrients.(10,11). Furthermore, there is a long tradition of

 using peanut as the mainstay of nutritional fortification programs in developing countries 
and even in the USA as part of the supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants and 
Children.(12) Despite these dietary practices, intervention studies involving regular 
consumption of peanut or similar energy-dense foods in early childhood are lacking in the 
literature.
The LEAP intervention recommended an intake of 6g peanut protein/week, equivalent to 3 
teaspoons of peanut butter, based on the upper quartile of intake observed in infants in Israel 
(7.1g peanut protein/month).(3) It is unknown if this dietary recommendation is challenging 
to incorporate into the diet of the infant, or will lead to an imbalanced diet if eaten 
throughout childhood.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of introduction of peanut in 
infancy and the effects of regular ongoing consumption on growth, nutrition and diet of 
atopic infants enrolled onto a randomized controlled trial. Using data from the LEAP study, 
we compare infants randomized to consumption or avoidance of peanut during the first 5 
years of life.
METHODS
Study Design
This study represents a planned secondary analysis from the LEAP trial, a randomized, 
open-label, controlled trial comparing two strategies to prevent peanut allergy: consumption 
or avoidance of peanut in high-risk infants. The primary outcomes and adverse event profile 
of this trial have been previously published.(1)
Dietary intervention
Infants aged 4 to <11 months with severe eczema and/or egg allergy were randomly assigned 
to consume or avoid peanut until 60 months of age. Participants randomized to peanut 
consumption (except those who were diagnosed with peanut allergy) were advised to eat at 
least 6g peanut protein/week distributed over three or more meals/week until age 60 months. 
The preferred peanut source was Bamba®, a snack-food manufactured from peanut butter 
and puffed maize; this snack was suitable for infants and could also be easily softened to a 
smooth texture (with warm milk or water) and added to other infant foods, such as oatmeal. 
Smooth peanut butter (Sunpat® and Duerr's® brands) was also provided by the study center; 
for safety, it was advised that this be loosened using warm (cooled, boiled) water prior to 
feeding infants.(13) Due to choking risk, it was also recommended that whole peanuts be 
avoided during early childhood.(13) Participants randomized to avoidance (and participants 
who were diagnosed with peanut allergy) were given detailed dietary advice on how to avoid 
exposure to peanut during study participation. They were advised that avoidance of products 
with peanut precautionary allergen labelling (where peanut was not a listed ingredient) was 
unnecessary unless diagnosed peanut allergic. Further details of the dietary advice provided 
are available in this article's Online Repository (Figure E1 and Figure E2).

 Peanut consumption monitoring
Peanut consumption was monitored using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at 
intervals as detailed in the schedule of events; adherence criteria are detailed elsewhere.
(1,14) For subgroup analyses, peanut consumers were divided into quartiles based on 
average peanut consumption throughout the study as measured by FFQ.
Growth and anthropometric measurements
Anthropometric measurements were taken in duplicate and the mean value recorded by 
trained staff at each study visit. Length and height were measured to the nearest 0.1cm, 
using an infant measuring table (<2 years) or wall-mounted stadiometer (Harpenden, 
Crymych, UK) and weight to the nearest 0.1kg using an electronic scale (Marsden M700, 
Rotherham, UK). Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1cm using an 
anthropometric measuring tape, triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness were measured to 
the nearest 0.1mm using skinfold calipers (Holtain, Crymych, UK). Body Mass Index (BMI) 
was calculated as weight/(height*height). Measurements were transformed into z-scores 
using the WHO Child Growth Standards.(15)
Nutritional intake monitoring
A 3-day food diary was completed prior to (or shortly after) each study visit. Detailed 
instructions were provided by study dietitians on how to complete the diary accurately. Food 
diaries were checked for completeness by a dietitian/dietetic assistant at the study visit and 
additional information or clarification sought where required including cooking methods and 
portion sizes. Those who had not completed some or all of the food diary were asked to 
return the diary by mail after the clinic visit.
Foods and drinks were entered into Dietplan 6 (Forestfield Software Limited, UK) and 
analyzed to produce average daily energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intakes. Portion 
weights were assigned based on information from manufacturers, food packaging and/or 
estimated from standard food portion sizes all scaled down for age based on the details 
recorded in the food diary and portion size resources.(16-21)
Nutrient intakes were compared with UK Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) by age and sex.
(22-24) Further details on nutritional intake monitoring are available in this article's online 
repository.
Types of foods consumed (average daily consumption in grams) over the duration of the 
study were compared between avoidance and consumption groups. All food codes entered 
into Dietplan were mapped to 61 food groups based on those reported elsewhere.(25) In 
addition, we separated out peanut-containing foods and specialist allergen-free products (e.g. 
wheat/gluten free cereals) which are more frequently eaten in this population compared to 
the general population.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were carried out in the intention to treat (ITT) population comparing the two 
randomized treatment groups cross-sectionally. Anthropometry and skin fold measurements

 were compared using general linear models adjusted for treatment assignment and gender. 
Percentage of total energy intakes were compared using equivariance t-tests. The proportion 
of participants with micronutrient intakes below lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI) 
levels were compared with Fisher's exact tests. Micronutrient intakes, total protein intake, 
percent of total protein intake, and average daily consumption of different types of foods 
were compared using Wilcoxon tests.
RESULTS
Study participants
The median age of participants at screening was 7.8 months (IQR, 6.3 to 9.1). The median 
duration of study participation was 4.4 years. Additional baseline characteristics have been 
previously published.(1)
Peanut consumption
In the consumption group, average peanut intake exceeded the recommended study intake 
within the first month (median 7.5g/week; IQR 6.0-9.0g/week) post-randomization, was 
sustained during the first six months of the intervention (median 7.9g/week; IQR 6.6-9.2g/
week) and on average increased throughout the study (Table I and Fig 1). Median peanut 
intake in the avoidance group remained at 0g throughout the study.
The main sources of peanut changed over time (see Fig E3 in this article's Online 
Repository): up until 21 months of age, participants consumed Bamba as their predominant 
source of peanut protein with peanut butter becoming the main source as participants got 
older. Other sources, including peanut-containing breakfast cereals and confectionary (e.g. 
cookies, chocolate or snack bars containing peanut) were minor sources of peanut protein. 
Crushed or ground whole peanuts were eaten by some participants from 12 months of age.
Infant feeding pre- and post-randomization
There were no differences in breastfeeding characteristics between treatment groups before 
or after randomization (Table I). The introduction of peanut did not result in a significantly 
shorter duration of breastfeeding in the peanut consumption group, even when adjusted for 
maternal highest level of education, gestational age at birth, and ethnicity. The mean 
duration of breastfeeding post-randomization was 4.7 months in the consumption group and 
4.9 months in the avoidance group (p=0.56). At the time of randomization, 290 participants 
had introduced infant formula in the consumption and 287 in the avoidance group. Solid 
foods were introduced at a mean age of 5 months (range 2.0-7.0 months) in both groups. 
There were no differences in the age at which the following food allergens were introduced 
pre-randomization: dairy foods (excludes infant formula), egg, wheat, fish, soya, tree nuts.
Growth, anthropometry and nutritional intakes
Anthropometric measures and nutrient intakes were compared between randomized groups 
and in subgroup analyses which compared the highest quartile of peanut consumers with the 
peanut avoidance group.

 There were no differences in weight, height, BMI or other anthropometric measurements 
(waist circumference, subscapular and triceps skin fold thickness) between the consumption 
and avoidance groups at any time during the study (Fig 2). Even when comparing the 
highest quartile of peanut consumers to peanut avoiders, there were no differences in 
anthropometric measures (see Fig E4 in this article's Online Repository). There were also 
no differences in anthropometric measurements when compared to WHO child growth 
standards (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository).
Food diary return rates
There were no differences between randomized groups in the numbers of food diaries 
returned (see Table E2 in this article's Online Repository).
Energy and macronutrient intakes
There were no differences in total energy intakes between randomized groups at any study 
time points and for the highest quartile of peanut consumers compared to peanut avoiders 
(see Fig E5 in this article's Online Repository).
The percentage of total energy (%TE) from carbohydrate was higher in the avoidance group 
compared to the consumption group at all post-randomization time points. Conversely, the 
%TE from fat was higher in the consumption group compared to the avoidance group at all 
post-randomization time points (Fig 3B). A cross-sectional comparison of macronutrient 
intakes across quartiles of peanut consumption found that small differences in contributions 
of carbohydrate and fat to %TE were accentuated in the upper quartiles of peanut 
consumption whereas %TE from protein remained consistent at all post-randomization time 
points for all quartiles of peanut consumption (Fig 3C) and in the avoidance group. When 
macronutrient subgroups were compared, %TE from starch was significantly higher at 21 
and 30 months and %TE from sugars was significantly higher at 30 and 60 months in the 
avoidance group (see Fig E6a in this article's Online Repository). There were no 
differences between randomized groups in %TE from saturated or polyunsaturated fatty 
acids at any time point. Intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in 
the consumption group at 60 months. (see Fig E6b in this article's Online Repository).
When compared with UK DRVs, mean protein intakes in both groups were well above the 
RNI whilst fat intakes met DRVs at all study visits.(22) Mean carbohydrate intakes fall just 
above the recommended 50%TE for children aged 2 years and older in the avoidance group 
at all post-randomization time points. In the consumption group carbohydrate intakes fall 
just below the DRV at 12 and 21 months, are at the DRV at 30 months and just above at 60 
months.(23)
Sodium, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin D
As peanut-containing foods often have added sodium, we assessed this intake between 
peanut avoiders and consumers. Sodium intake was elevated for all participants (144-244% 
above UK recommendations); this intake was not significantly different between randomized 
groups or in the highest peanut consumers compared to peanut avoiders. (see Tables E3a, 
E3b and E3c in this article's Online Repository Table).(24,26)

 Calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin D intakes (expressed as a percentage of the RNI) were 
compared as intakes of these micronutrients are often compromised in children with food 
allergies.(27-29) There were no differences in intakes for calcium (except at 12 months), 
iron or zinc. There were no differences between groups in intakes of vitamin D; however, 
intake decreased over time. There is no RNI for vitamin D above 3 years of age so intake as 
a percentage of RNI at 60 months could not be calculated (Table II).
There were no differences in the proportion of participants with intakes of iron, calcium or 
zinc below the lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI) (Table III). A higher than expected 
proportion of participants in both randomized groups had intakes of iron and zinc below the 
LRNI; at baseline, 12, 21 and 30 months of age for iron and at all time points for zinc (apart 
from peanut avoidance group at 21 months).
Foods consumed
Participants randomized to consumption ate significantly less of the following food groups: 
‘crisps/chips and savory snacks’, ‘high fiber bread’, ‘fruit juices and smoothies’, ‘spreads’ 
(e.g. jam, yeast extract), ‘low energy dense sauces’ (includes gravy, ketchup, mustard, 
tomato-based pasta sauce), ‘sunflower/other oils and fat spreads’ and ‘dairy free spreads’ 
(see Table E4 and Table E5 in this article's Online Repository).
To see whether the consumption of peanut, a source of vegetable protein, led to a reduced 
intake of protein from other sources in order to maintain overall protein homeostasis, we 
compared the sources of protein (expressed as total intake in grams and percent of total 
protein intake) in the avoidance and consumption groups. There were no differences 
between randomized groups in protein intake from different sources at any post 
randomization time point (except for ‘other’ sources at 12 months) (Table IV). However, 
when we compared the highest quartile of peanut consumers to the avoiders, we found 
significantly higher intakes of vegetable protein and lower intakes of animal protein 
expressed as a percent of total grams at 21, 30, and 60 months. (Table V).
DISCUSSION
The LEAP Study successfully introduced peanut to the diet of infants randomized to peanut 
consumption. The recommended intake was achieved in the first month of the study and 
maintained throughout, confirming the ease with which peanut can be introduced to the 
infant diet. Whilst Bamba and peanut butter accounted for the majority of peanut intake 
during the early years of the trial, peanut butter consumption increased after 21 months, 
showing that the intervention can be undertaken using a variety of peanut products. Despite 
eating different peanut-containing foods, even whole peanuts from the age of 12 months, no 
episodes of participant choking or aspiration were reported. However, clinicians should still 
emphasize that whole peanuts and chunks of peanut butter are a choking hazard in young 
children and should not be consumed before 5 years of age.(6-8,13)
The timing of introduction of other allergenic foods was equivalent between groups prior to 
randomization. A high proportion of LEAP infants were breastfeeding at the time of 
introducing peanut and, reassuringly, peanut consumption did not affect the duration of

 breastfeeding. Whilst the study intervention does not comply with WHO guidelines on 
exclusive breastfeeding, it did not negatively impact breastfeeding itself. This is important 
due to concerns that introduction of solid foods before 6 months of age will reduce 
breastfeeding duration.(30) Our finding is supported by other studies.(31,32) We know that 
in the UK, 30% of infants have already introduced solid foods by 4 months and 75% by 5 
months of age i.e. do not comply with WHO guidelines on exclusive breastfeeding.(5) In 
addition, for some infants the introduction of allergenic foods between 4-6 months may be 
important for allergy prevention.(33-35) Our results show that in high-risk infants, early 
consumption of peanut from 4 months of age is safe and effective for allergy prevention.
Peanut consumption did not lead to differences in weight, height, BMI, or other 
anthropometric measurements even amongst the highest quartile of peanut consumers.
Macronutrient intakes in both groups were in line with UK recommendations apart from 
carbohydrate which fell close to the recommended intake (DRV for 2-5 year olds defined in 
2015). When compared to US dietary reference intakes, which have wider ranges than the 
UK, both groups meet acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges for protein, fat and 
carbohydrate at all study visits.(36) Sodium intakes were above UK recommended 
maximum intakes in both groups but below US recommended maximum intakes.(26) 
Although iron and zinc intakes were low for some participants, similar proportions of young 
children with intakes below the LRNI have been reported by the recent UK national dietary 
survey.(37)
Nutritional priorities of maintenance of energy and protein homeostasis are achieved in 
different ways in peanut consumers compared to avoiders. Peanut consumption led to a 
higher fat intake and a lower carbohydrate intake compared to avoidance while energy 
balance was maintained in both groups. These differences in fat and carbohydrate intakes 
were accentuated in the highest quartile of peanut consumers while protein intake stayed 
constant across quartiles of peanut consumption and in the avoidance group. We believe this 
shows evidence of protein regulation occurring in children from an early age. The addition 
of peanut-containing foods did not affect %TE intake from protein because intake from other 
sources (animal protein sources) was decreased to maintain protein homeostasis; energy 
balance was maintained by adjusting non-protein energy intakes (i.e. fat and carbohydrate). 
Similarly, an experimental study found that adult participants restored protein homeostasis 
through increased selection of high protein foods such that they had a 13% higher protein 
intake after a 14 day low protein diet compared to after a high protein diet. (38)
Peanut consumers made different food choices to peanut avoiders. They had a lower intake 
of fat spreads and oils than the avoidance group; however, their overall intake of fat as %TE 
was higher. This likely reflects their using peanut butter in place of fat spreads. Peanut butter 
tends to be spread more generously and also parents/caregivers may have given larger 
portions to ensure the participant achieved their target peanut protein intake (a generous 
teaspoon or 8g of smooth peanut butter contains approximately 2g of peanut protein).
Peanut consumers also ate significantly less crisps/chips and savory snacks, high fiber bread, 
fruit juices and smoothies, spreads (e.g. jam, yeast extract), low energy dense sauces

 (includes gravy, ketchup, mustard, tomato-based pasta sauce), than peanut avoiders. Many of 
these foods have a high carbohydrate content supporting the lower carbohydrate intakes 
found in the consumption group. We are unable to say whether reduced consumption of 
these foods is due to development of different taste preferences through repeat peanut 
exposure from infancy (increased liking for fruit and vegetables has been observed in 
children with repeat exposure from infancy), or whether having a predetermined snack 
means that other popular snack choices are not selected. Alternatively, regulatory processes 
may influence self-selection of specific foods to avoid imbalances in protein and total energy 
intake which we observe occurs with intakes of different protein sources in the highest 
peanut consumers.(39-41)
The nutritional intake data is subject to the limitations of estimated food diaries which are 
well described including the challenges of accurately quantifying portion sizes, over-, under- 
and mis-reporting of dietary intakes by participants and missing nutritional data in UK food 
tables.(42) Nonetheless this method provides a level of detail about dietary intake that 
cannot be obtained by other methods such as FFQs.(43) We have also previously described 
the limitations associated with the use of FFQ's for the accurate determination of peanut 
intake.(14) The favorable LEAP nutritional results may not be generalizable to children in 
the general population who have less dietetic support with peanut consumption, less frequent 
monitoring of peanut intakes and of growth and nutritional intakes during treatment.
Our study has several strengths. The high study retention over 5 years (98%), high adherence 
to the randomized intervention (92%), regular collection of peanut consumption and 
avoidance information by FFQ (median number of 80 phone contacts per participant) ensure 
robust data were gathered. This is enhanced by the high return rate of food diaries (83% 
returned ≥4 food diaries) with collection on 5 occasions from infancy to 60 months 
alongside detailed growth data. In addition, we show that infants and young children not 
only maintain energy balance in response to dietary manipulation but also regulate their 
protein intakes.
In conclusion, this is the first randomized trial to introduce peanut in infancy and 
demonstrates that the intervention is easily achieved and has no adverse dietary sequelae. In 
addition to a reduction in peanut allergy at 60 months of age, peanut consumption did not 
negatively impact growth in childhood even at the highest quartile of consumption. These 
findings are reassuring in the context of new consensus communications to feed peanut early 
to high-risk, atopic infants.(6-8) Interestingly, we found that despite peanut consumers 
making different food choices to peanut avoiders, both achieved nutritional priorities of 
energy and protein homeostasis. This occurs through a trade-off between carbohydrate and 
fat contributions to energy intake.

 CAPSULE SUMMARY
Our results demonstrate that the dietary intervention of regular peanut consumption from 
infancy as a strategy to prevent peanut allergy in high-risk infants is easily achieved and 
has no adverse effects on growth or nutrition.

 Implications for clinicians
Peanut consumption as a strategy to prevent peanut allergy, introduced in infancy is 
nutritionally safe even when consumption occurs at high levels. However, parents/
caregivers must be reminded that whole peanuts should not be given to children below 5 
years due to choking risk.

 Fig 1. Average peanut consumption over time (grams peanut protein per week)
Peanut consumption summarized throughout the study from FFQs completed at baseline and 
between study visits. Median weekly consumption during the first 2 years of life (per-
protocol adherence) has been previously published.(1) Grey dots denote subjects 
randomized to the avoidance group. Green dots denote subjects randomized to the 
consumption group. Red circles denote participants who were peanut allergic at 60 months.
