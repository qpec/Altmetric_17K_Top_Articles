Background: Head or anterior body part regeneration is commonly associated with protostome, but not deuterostome inver-
tebrates. However, it has been shown that the solitary hemichordate Ptychodera flava possesses the remarkable capacity to
regenerate their entire nervous system, including their dorsal neural tube and their anterior head-like structure, or proboscis.
Hemichordates, also known as acorn worms, are marine invertebrate deuterostomes that have retained chordate traits that
were likely present in the deuterostome ancestor, placing these animals in a vital position to study regeneration and chordate
evolution. All acorn worms have a tripartite body plan, with an anterior proboscis, middle collar region, and a posterior trunk.
The collar houses a hollow, dorsal neural tube in ptychoderid hemichordates and numerous chordate genes involved in brain
and spinal cord development are expressed in a similar anterior–posterior spatial arrangement along the body axis. Results:
We have examined anterior regeneration in the hemichordate Ptychodera flava and report the spatial and temporal morpho-
logical changes that occur. Additionally, we have sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the transcriptome for eight stages of
regenerating P. flava, revealing significant differential gene expression between regenerating and control animals. Conclu-
sions: Importantly, we have uncovered developmental steps that are regeneration-specific and do not strictly follow the
embryonic program. Developmental Dynamics 245:1159–1175, 2016. V

Introduction
Regeneration has captured the interest and imagination of people
for centuries. Popularized in myths, science fiction, and even hor-
ror movies, regeneration of missing and damaged tissue is a com-
mon reality in the animal kingdom. Nearly every animal phyla
contains at least some species that consistently regenerate all or
certain tissues and structures (Bely and Nyberg, 2010; Somorjai
et al., 2012; Giangrande and Licciano, 2014). All deuterostome
groups, with the possible exception of Xenoturbella, have at least
some species with the capacity to regenerate (S�
anchez Alvarado,
2000). Numerous chordates, including lancelets, tunicates, frogs,
fish, salamanders, and even humans are able to regenerate to
some degree (Brown et al., 2009; Bely and Nyberg, 2010; Somor-
jai et al., 2012; Giangrande and Licciano, 2014). Every extant
class of echinoderms have been reported to regenerate (Candia
Carnevali et al., 2009), while some species of hemichordates, which
are a sister group to the echinoderms, undergo asexual reproduc-
tion and regenerate all anterior and posterior body parts when
amputated (Willey 1899; Dawydoff 1902; Rao 1954; Rychel and
Swalla, 2008; Humphreys et al., 2010; Miyamoto and Saito, 2010).
When and in what animal lineage did the ability to regenerate
first evolve? Was regeneration a stem metazoan trait that was
subsequently lost or reduced in numerous taxa or has regenera-
tion evolved independently several times across the metazoans?
Porifera (Bely and Nyberg, 2010; Giangrande and Licciano,
2014), Cnidaria (Bosch, 2007; Dubuc et al., 2014), Ctenophora
(Ryan et al., 2013; Moroz et al., 2014), and Placozoa (Bely and
Nyberg, 2010) have extensive regenerative abilities and, as basal
metazoans, these lineages suggest an ancient and ancestral
mechanism of regeneration. Comparing gene regulatory networks
used during regeneration across various animal phyla will help to
elucidate common molecular mechanisms of regeneration.
Understanding the morphological and genetic basis of regener-
ation may yield clues to unlocking regeneration in animals with
limited or no regenerative abilities, like humans. Millions of

 people suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord inju-
ries, and limb amputations (Brown et al., 2005; Ziegler-Graham
et al., 2008; Mahabaleshwarkar and Khanna, 2014). Furthermore,
aging and age-related diseases will eventually affect everyone.
Regeneration may slow the aging process and stem cells present
one feasible way to combat a multitude of diseases and injuries
(Rando and Wyss-Coray, 2014). If regeneration is a stem deutero-
stome trait, it is likely that humans possess many, if not all, of
the genetic switches controlling regeneration, but those switches
have been modified or inactivated in some way over evolutionary
time. It may, therefore, be possible to re-activate those pathways
in humans using information gained from studying genetic mod-
els made from animals with extensive regenerative capabilities.
We are seeking to identify the morphological and genetic
underpinnings controlling regeneration in the solitary hemichor-
date, Ptychodera flava (Eschscholtz, 1825), which is a basal deu-
terostome and capable of regenerating all anterior and posterior
structures when bisected (Rychel and Swalla, 2008; Humphreys
et al., 2010). It is critical to know when internal structures regen-
erate to use genetic knock downs and knock outs, as well as over-
expression, to characterize the function of genes directing the
regeneration process. Moreover, hemichordates are the only deu-
terostome known to be able to regenerate an anterior head-like
structure and entire central nervous system (CNS). Ptychodera
flava progresses from a fertilized embryo to a planktonic, feeding
larva that can remain in the water column for up to 300 days
(Hadfield, 1978; Lin et al., 2016). Upon metamorphosis, the larva
develops into a juvenile worm that settles to the ocean floor to
begin a benthic lifestyle. Solitary hemichordates are exclusively
marine and adult animals have a tripartite body plan with an
anterior proboscis that is used for digging and burrowing in the
sand and mud, a middle collar region with a hollow, dorsal neural
tube in ptychoderid hemichordates, a ventral mouth between the
proboscis and collar, and a long posterior trunk with pharyngeal
gill slits and gonads in the anterior trunk, a hepatic region in the
mid-trunk and a terminal anus (Balser and Ruppert, 1990; Brown
et el., 2008; Luttrell and Swalla, 2014).
The hemichordate nervous system is quite interesting. Upon
embryogenesis in direct developing hemichordates and metamor-
phosis in indirect developers, dorsal and ventral nerve cords
develop along the full length of the trunk and nerve rings form
around the base of the collar and the base of the proboscis (Balser
and Ruppert, 1990; Kaul and Stach, 2010; Miyamoto et al., 2010;
Miyamoto and Wada, 2013; Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015). Adult
echinoderms also develop nerve cords throughout each arm and a
circumferential nerve ring around the central disc; however, it
still remains to be determined whether echinoderm and hemi-
chordate nerve cords are homologous structures (Sly et al., 2002;
Holland et al., 2013). In addition to nerve cords, P. flava also
develops a hollow, neural tube that is positioned dorsally in the
collar region. Our lab has shown this structure forms from ecto-
derm that invaginates and rolls up forming a hollow tube, similar
to chordate neurulation (Morgan, 1894; Luttrell et al., 2012;
Miyamoto and Wada, 2013; Luttrell and Swalla, 2014).
Lastly, hemichordates have a diffuse nerve net throughout the
ectoderm, similar to the adult tunicate, Ciona intestinalis (Balser
and Ruppert, 1990; Lowe et al., 2003; Dahlberg et al., 2009;
Miyamoto et al., 2010; Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015). The adult
acorn worm, in light of these similarities, has aspects of the dif-
ferent types of nervous systems that are present in the deuteros-
tomes. Remarkably, P. flava is able to regenerate all of these
structures, making hemichordates a model system to study nervous
system evolution and regeneration in this clade of animals. Further-
more, as invertebrates, hemichordates lack the numerous genome
duplications events present in the vertebrates (Dehal and Boore,
2005; Hughes and Liberles, 2008), thereby making functional studies
of the regeneration genes more tractable in this animal.
Here, we report the spatial and temporal regeneration of inter-
nal body structures to complement the previously published
external morphology regeneration data (Willey, 1899; Rao, 1954;
Nishikawa, 1977; Rychel and Swalla, 2008; Humphreys et al.,
2010). We also include analyses of the transcriptome from regen-
erating P. flava animals. In total, eight different stages of regen-
eration were sequenced, assembled, and annotated to track
changes in early gene expression that direct regeneration of ante-
rior structures. We document expression profiles and gene ontol-
ogies of hundreds of putative genes associated with anterior head
regeneration. These data build a foundation for future experi-
ments that may show what genes are sufficient and necessary to
start the regeneration program in P. flava. Our morphological
data shows the regenerative response to these early changes in
gene expression and we document complete anterior regeneration
of the proboscis, collar, and anterior trunk. Furthermore, we
uncovered morphological differences between early development
and regeneration of anterior structures, including the neural tube.
The assembled transcriptomes reported here not only complement
recent P. flava developmental transcriptomes (Shu-Hwa et al.,
2014; Tagawa et al., 2014; Simakov et al., 2015), but also open
the door to systematic comparisons of embryonic processes to
regenerative events in hemichordates specifically, and deuteros-
tomes in general.

Regeneration of External and Internal Anterior
Features in P. flava
Intact, healthy, adult worms (Fig. 1A) were bisected in the trunk
between the branchial region and the hepatic sacs (Fig. 1B) and the
posterior piece was monitored for regeneration signs at the cut site
(Fig. 1C). The first observable change in tissue composition in Pty-
chodera flava is wound healing. This process is relatively rapid and
takes place within the first 2 days following amputation at 26�C.
Wound healing culminates in ectoderm covering and sealing the
open cut site (Fig. 1D–F). Over the next 3 days, a regeneration blas-
tema forms at the anterior end (Fig. 1G,H). Cells accumulate and
proliferate in the blastema to yield a new, rudimentary anterior
head, or proboscis (Fig. 1I). Between days 4 and 5 post bisection, the
mouth has opened on the ventral side (Figs. 1J, 3D1–3).
Over the next several days, cells continue to proliferate enlarg-
ing the proboscis and the collar begins to wrap around the base
of the proboscis (Fig. 1K–T). The collar regenerates in the ventral
and lateral positions first (Fig. 1K–P). Gill slits and gill bars start
to form in the anterior most region of the trunk after 10 to 12
days, before the collar ectoderm completely regenerates and
closes on the dorsal side (Fig. 1Q–T). At 13 days post bisection,
the ventral and lateral collar ectoderm has fully regenerated (Fig.
2). The dorsal most region of the collar has not yet formed, but
will continue to regenerate and finally close forming a continu-
ous ring around the neck region after approximately 2 weeks of
regeneration. The epibranchial nerve ring that that wraps around
the posterior collar is visible in the newly regenerated tissue and

 forms as the collar regrows and not after the collar has fully
shaped (Fig. 2).
The internal regeneration morphology of P. flava is striking
after the first day the animal is bisected. Both ectoderm and
endoderm of the trunk region come together at the cut site and
form a near continuous layer (Fig. 3A1). The folds of pre-existing
endoderm are still present and the neural net is maintained below
the ectoderm (Fig. 3A1). Existing muscle fibers of the trunk are
still obvious at the anterior end where the wound has sealed (Fig.
3A1). Hepatic collagen is visible below the ectoderm at the cut
site, denoting endoderm of the existing hepatic sacculations are
taking part in wound healing (Fig. 3A1). On day 2 of regenera-
tion, the wound has completely healed and the ectoderm epitheli-
um is smooth and continuous (Fig. 3B1,B2). Dorsal and ventral
blood vessels run the length of the animal, allowing blood cells
to circulate. Blood is visible in the dorsal and ventral endoderm
of the cut site, indicating that both blood vessels are likely sup-
plying blood to this region (Fig. 3B2).
Hepatic collagen is still visible in the dorsal endoderm, sugges-
ting that at least parts of this tissue have not undergone apoptosis

 or have been remodeled at this stage. By day 3 of regeneration,
the blastema has formed a rudimentary proboscis (Fig. 3C1–4). A
nerve net is present below the ectoderm in this region, at least
partially originating from the existing trunk tissue and not whol-
ly regenerated de novo (Fig. 3C1–4). At this stage, a structure
resembling the presumptive stomochord appears posterior to the
rudimentary proboscis and also appears to be derived from endo-
dermal tissue (Fig. 3C3,C4). The hepatic sacculations are clearly
visible in the existing trunk denoting the dorsal side and a thick
nerve net is still present on the ventral side below the ectoderm
posterior to the cut site (Fig. 3C1–C4).
As the proboscis grows, anterior internal tissues continue to be
elaborated. Hemichordates are tricoelomates, having separate
coeloms in the proboscis, collar, and trunk regions. The proboscis
coelom is fully formed after 4 days of regeneration (Fig. 3D1–3).
The dorsal blood vessel flows anteriorly from the trunk, through
the collar, ultimately forming the heart in the posterior proboscis
(Benito and Pardos, 1997). The dorsal vessel has regenerated into
the proboscis, filling the coelom with blood at 4 days postampu-
tation (Fig. 3D1–3). The mouth, which was visible in the external
morphology at day 5, is clearly open in sagittal sections at day 4
(Fig. 3D1–3). The stomochord is a stiff, rod-like structure in the
posterior proboscis and provides structural support for the super-
imposing heart/kidney complex (Balser and Ruppert, 1990;
Rychel and Swalla, 2008; Miyamoto and Wada, 2013). The sto-
mochord is apparent in sections after 5 days of regeneration (Fig.
3E2–4). At this stage, the stomochord forms between the bound-
ary where ectoderm and endoderm meet. At this time, the heart-
kidney complex regenerates in the lateral and dorsal positions
around the stomochord (Fig. 3E1–4). The dorsal blood vessel is
obvious at this stage, flowing into the proboscis just above the
stomochord where the heart/kidney complex is regenerating (Fig.
3E1–4). The ventral blood vessel is supplying blood and cells to
the presumptive ventral collar coelom as well (Fig. 3E1–4). One
day later, the regenerated collar coeloms can be seen in the dorsal
and ventral regions (Fig. 3F1–4). The proboscis skeleton provides
structure and support for the collar and overlying dorsal blood
vessel and neural tube (Luttrell et al., 2012). The proboscis skele-
ton regenerates from endoderm in the collar region and is visible
in endodermal inpocketing at 13 days postamputation (Fig. 4P).
The hollow, dorsal neural tube, which is found only in the collar
region in ptychoderid hemichordates, begins to form in the poste-
rior collar as the ectoderm closes on the dorsal side at 13 days
postbisection (Fig. 4T). These morphological regenerative events
are summarized in Table 1.
Dynamic and Discrete Cohorts of Gene Expression
Patterns Are Observed During Early Stages of Head
Regeneration
Regeneration of these morphological structures is driven by a sig-
nificant change in gene expression as evidenced by the transcrip-
tome data. A line graph was constructed to show clusters of up-
regulated, putative genes showing similar expression profiles
along all time points sampled (Fig. 5A). Nearly all genes in cluster
A are significantly up-regulated 2 hr after the animal is bisected;
however, the expression level of these genes steadily and drasti-
cally declines beginning 6 hr into the regeneration process. A
heatmap of cluster A identifies the individual, putative genes and
their expression profile across all time points (Fig. 5B). Heatmaps
of the genes in cluster B shows overall expression is near baseline

 values at the 2-hr time point, but then expression increases sig-
nificantly after 6 hr and is elevated approximately 8-fold higher
than control animals after 4 days of regeneration (Fig. 5C).
Heatmaps of the cluster C and cluster D genes show similar
expression profiles, both being only slightly elevated after 2 hr of
regeneration and then progressively increasing until the 24-hr
time point, at which time both clusters begin to show decreased
expression levels, with cluster C displaying the most dramatic
decrease (Fig. 5D,E). However, expression of putative genes in
both clusters still remain over two log fold change higher than
controls after 4 days of regeneration.
Down-regulated, putative genes were also identified and
grouped into clusters of similar expression domains. A line graph
shows four clusters of predicted genes with very different expres-
sion profiles (Fig. 6A). Heatmaps of cluster A show overall expres-
sion levels slightly below baseline values between 2 and 6 hr of
regeneration and then expression gradually decreases with a steep
decline between 3 and 4 days of regeneration. A detailed listing of
these putative genes is included in Figure 7. Cluster B genes also
start off at near baseline values and expression steadily decreases;
however, this group of genes reverses at the 48-hr time point and
expression levels begin to increase, although overall expression
of this cluster remains significantly down-regulated at the 96-hr
time point compared with control animals (Fig. 8).
Predicted genes in cluster C show an interesting expression
pattern along all sampled time points. Expression is initially

 significantly reduced by over three log fold compared with con-
trol animals at the 2-hr time point and then expression sharply
increases over the next 2 hr, only to abruptly decrease again to
nearly an 8-fold change from control animals at the 6-hr time
point. Expression levels then steadily elevate again over the next
18 hr, at which point expression sharply declines again between
24 and 48 hr of regeneration, with expression values greater than
8-fold lower than control animals. Expression then rebounds
over the next 48 hr and returns to around the same levels mea-
sured at the 2-hr time point, which is still nearly four log fold
lower than expression in control animals (Fig. 6B). Cluster D
genes are initially down-regulated after 2 hr of regeneration, but
are significantly up-regulated from baseline levels at the 96-hr
time point (Fig. 6C). Additionally, a heatmap was constructed for
putative transcription factors and their relative expression com-

 Gene Activity Associated With Cell Proliferation and
Metabolic Changes is Prominently Detected in the
Early Stages of P. flava Head Regeneration
Gene ontology (GO) analysis was completed to categorize the
function of differentially expressed putative genes. We display
the number of genes per significantly enriched GO term for 72 hr
and 96 hr and no other time points because there was no enrich-
ment for the other time points. Over half of the significantly
enriched genes for which we have GO annotations play a role in
cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as organ morpho-
genesis (Fig. 10A). Approximately 12% of the significantly
enriched genes for which we have GO annotations are involved
with cell signaling (Fig. 10A). Predicted orthologs of highly con-
served developmental pathways were detected, including mem-
bers of the Wnt signaling pathway, the fibroblast growth factor
signaling pathway, and the Notch signaling pathway (Fig. 10A).
We further classified the amount of both up- and down-
regulated genes at the 72-hr time point and 96-hr time point
into biological processes, molecular function, and cellular com-
ponent categories (Fig. 10B). The vast majority of up-regulated
genes at the 3- and 4-day time points are involved with extra-
cellular space and matrix roles (Fig. 10B). At 72 hr post bisection,
hundreds of genes are up-regulated for biological processes,
such as cell adhesion and lipid metabolism (Fig. 10B). Genes
regulating small molecule and single organism metabolic pro-
cesses on the other hand are down-regulated after 72 hr of
regeneration, as well as numerous genes involved with oxidore-
ductase activity (Fig. 10B). Biological process genes aligned with
aging, extracellular structure organization and matrix organiza-
tion are down-regulated at the 96-hr time point (Fig. 10B). The
cellular component categories of extracellular space and region
part, as well as oxidoreductase activity in the molecular func-
tion category are also down-regulated at 96 hr post bisection
(Fig. 10B).
Discussion
External Regeneration Morphology
Ptychoderid hemichordate regeneration is a remarkable process
that results in external structures regenerating in an anterior to
posterior manner patterned off the existing body axis. This is
similar to juvenile worm development in P. flava and another
ptychoderid hemichordate, Balanoglossus simodensis, when the
proboscis forms first during metamorphosis (Miyamoto et al.,
2010; Lin et al., 2016). The collar and trunk then differentiate
and the trunk elongates. One difference between development
and regeneration, however, is that gill slits start to regenerate
before the collar has fully formed, unlike early development in
direct developing hemichordates when gill slits form after the
collar and trunk have delineated from one another (Kaul-Streh-
low and Stach, 2013; Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015).
Furthermore, during direct development, the neural tube also
starts to invaginate from dorsal, collar ectoderm in the posterior
region of the collar before the first gill slit formation (Kaul-Streh-
low and Stach, 2013); however, we show in this study that the
first gill slit regenerates at least 2 days before the neural tube
begins to form in the indirect developing P. flava. Few studies
directly compare development or regeneration of the neural tube
and gill slits in ptychoderid worms, but two studies state that the
collar develops or regenerates before the branchial region (Niel-
sen and Hay-Schmidt, 2007: Humphreys et al., 2010). This is not
evidence that the neural tube specifically has developed at this
point and future studies will need to confirm the timing of devel-
opment of the neural tube compared with development of the
branchial region in P. flava. These differences, however, do show
a potential temporal plasticity during regeneration of anterior
structures in P. flava.
During regeneration, cells proliferate and accumulate to form a
blastema at the cut site, which then differentiate to replace

proliferating cells are bona fide stem cells occupying an unknown
niche that are recruited to the cut site or are these somatic cells
that have undergone de-differentiation and returned to a
progenitor cell state and then assigned new fates in the regener-
ating tissue? Numerous genes in P. flava are both up- and down-
regulated beginning just 2 hr after the animal is bisected. Differ-
ential gene expression increases rapidly during the early time

cut site forming the regeneration blastema within 3 to 4 days
postamputation. Rychel and Swalla (2008) showed that prolifer-
ating cell nuclear antigen positive cells are found in scattered
mesenchyme cells throughout the tissue near the cut site by day 2
of regeneration at 28�C in P. flava. There is some slight variation
in wound healing and blastema growth times between the results
reported by Rychel and Swalla (2008) and here, but the overall
results are consistent. Our lab is currently working to determine
the origin and molecular profile of these proliferating cells to ver-
ify whether these are stem cells or de-differentiated somatic cells.
We are using stem cell markers in regenerating and nonregener-
ating animals to detect molecular signatures consistent with
known stem cell lines.
Internal Regeneration Morphology
While epidermal tissue regenerates anterior to posterior, internal
structures appear to regenerate based on need and function. The
mouth, which is critical to feeding and thereby supports the high
metabolic cost of regeneration, forms and opens after just 4 days.
The worm does not burrow and ingest sand to deposit feed at this
point; however, they are likely taking in organic nutrients sus-
pended in the water column. Regenerating worms start to burrow
in sand around 10 days postbisection. Blood vessels and mechan-
ical support elements for vital organs and tissues also seem to be
essential as these are among the first internal structures in the
new tissue.
The stomochord in the posterior proboscis is vacuolated and
acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, providing support for the heart-
kidney complex (Miyamoto and Wada, 2013). Several studies
have shown that, in both direct and indirect developing acorn
worms, the stomochord is elaborated from endoderm during
juvenile worm development (Kaul-Strehlow and Stach, 2013;
Miyamoto and Wada, 2013; Satoh et al., 2014). At 3 days postbi-
section, we show what may be the presumptive stomochord
regenerating from endoderm; however, the identity of this struc-
ture is not clear. At this stage, it is not positioned directly below
the future heart/kidney complex in the proboscis as the stomo-
chord should be, but rather it is more internal in the presumptive
collar region. This structure could also be the hydropore, which is
a rounded tube, but that is also not in the correct position, as the
hydropore is in the dorsal proboscis/collar ectoderm region and
expels circulating waste from the proboscis coelom to the envi-
ronment (R€
ottinger and Martindale, 2011). It may be that the
angle of the sections is not exactly sagittal, at which point inter-
nal structures may appear skewed. It may also be that regenerat-
ing structures look out of place during the early stages. Future
studies will be needed using molecular markers to confirm the
identity of this structure.
This study does clearly show, however, that the stomochord is
elaborated from tissue at the ectoderm/endoderm boundary at 5
days postbisection. Tracing the anterior proboscis ectoderm to the
anterior stomochord shows that ectoderm is definitely connected
to this structure. Conversely, tracing the endodermal tissue to the
posterior stomochord also shows that it is definitely connected to
this tissue. So the question remains; at what point does endoderm
become ectoderm? Our lab is using endodermal and ectodermal
molecular markers to answer this provocative question and deter-
mine from what tissue type the stomochord regenerates.
The proboscis skeleton is cartilaginous and provides a rigid
framework to protect the collar and overlying dorsal blood vessel
and neural tube. The proboscis skeleton regenerates from

 endoderm, similar to early development (Luttrell et al., 2012;
Miyamoto and Wada, 2013). A key difference is that the probos-
cis skeleton and dorsal vessel regenerate before neural tube
regeneration. During normal development this process is reversed
and the dorsal vessel and neural tube develop before the probos-
cis skeleton (Luttrell et al., 2012). Another major difference is the
way the neural tube regenerates. During normal development,
dorsal collar ectoderm invaginates, rolls up forming a hollow
tube. During regeneration, the neural tube begins to form at day
13 as the collar ectoderm nears closure on the dorsal side. It is the
closure of this ectoderm that actually forms the tube and not
from invaginating ectoderm after the collar fully regenerates and
closes.
This study shows that regeneration in P. flava does not strictly
follow the developmental program and there are morphological
steps that are regeneration specific. Furthermore, Arimoto and
Tagawa (2015) showed that the hedgehog gene, which is highly
conserved in the metazoans (Adamska et al., 2007) and involved

 with both morphogenesis and regeneration (Huangfu and Ander-
son, 2006; Rink et al., 2009), is expressed in both the pharyngeal
endoderm and anterior tip of P. flava larvae, however, it is only
expressed in the pharyngeal region during regeneration in P.
flava. The regenerating proboscis tip does not express hedgehog
and this evidence suggests there are different gene expression
patterns that are regeneration specific in P. flava as well.
In the vertebrates, the notochord and dorsal vessel secrete sig-
naling molecules to partially pattern the neural tube and
peripheral nervous system, respectively. The notochord secretes
sonic hedgehog, signaling the overlying ectoderm to become
neural, invaginate and roll up forming the neural tube, while the
dorsal blood vessel secretes bone morphogenetic protein mole-
cules that signal neural crest cells to become peripheral neurons
(Rickmann et al., 1985; Altaba et al., 1995; Briscoe et al., 1999;
Schneider et al. 1999; Young et al., 2004). Hemichordates lack a
notochord; therefore, the dorsal vessel may play a pivotal role in
guiding CNS formation in the collar region during early

 development. The dorsal vessel may still be directing this process
during regeneration as this structure is formed and has regener-
ated into the proboscis by day 4. The tissue directly above the
dorsal vessel in the collar region is thickened with a rich nerve
net by 9 days postbisection and this tissue will become the ven-
tral part of the neural tube. It is likely that signals directing a

 neural tube fate are coming on early during collar regeneration,
before the dorsal, collar ectoderm being present, and these signals
may be emanating from the dorsal vessel.
Regeneration of the branchial region starts to occur before the
collar closes dorsally and the neural tube forms. Between days 10
and 12, the first gill slit appears directly between the regenerating
collar and the existing hepatic sacs. The regenerating branchial
region in P. flava contains both pigmented and unpigmented
cells. The anterior most branchial region closest to the collar is
clear to white, while the posterior regenerating branchial region
closest to the original cut site contains pigmented cells. Rychel
and Swalla (2008) used a TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick end-label-
ing) assay to show numerous apoptotic cells in the endoderm of
the hepatic sacs near the cut site 8 days after amputation. This
suggests that, while the anterior most branchial tissue is likely
elaborated from newly generated, unpigmented proliferating
cells, the cells in the tissue closest to the cut site undergo apopto-
sis and the tissue is remodeled from the existing cells in the
hepatic region. This hypothesis remains to be confirmed, but it
will be exciting if internal structures regenerate using both stem
cells and somatic cells in P. flava because it will provide a model
to study two different modes of regenerating tissue in a stem
deuterostome.
Expression of Putative Vertebrate Anterior Head Genes
Understanding the genetic and morphological basis of regenera-
tion in hemichordates is vital to unlocking more extensive neural
regeneration in humans. No vertebrate has been shown to be able
to regenerate an anterior head or an entire CNS. Vertebrates that
are capable of regenerating a small part of their CNS, like fish
and amphibians (Slack et al., 2008; S^
ırbulescu and Zupanc, 2010;
Kroehne et al., 2011; Lau et al., 2013), possess numerous copies
of single genes due to whole genome duplication events (Dehal
and Boore, 2005; Hughes and Liberles, 2008). This genetic redun-
dancy complicates functional studies of key genes controlling the
regeneration process. Hemichordates not only lack whole genome
duplications, but consistently regenerate their anterior head and
complete CNS and, therefore, present a remarkable model system
to study and uncover key genetic switches directing regeneration
of anterior structures in the deuterostomes.
Several studies have detailed expression of genes involved
with chordate brain and spinal cord development in the direct
developing hemichordate, Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Lowe et al.,
2003; Pani et al., 2012: R€
ottinger and Lowe, 2012). These orthol-
ogous genes show a similar spatial distribution of chordate pat-
terning along the anterior–posterior body axis in S. kowalevskii.
Numerous chordate forebrain genes are expressed in the develop-
ing hemichordate proboscis region while chordate midbrain genes
are expressed in the hemichordate collar region and chordate
hindbrain and spinal cord genes are expressed in the hemichor-
date trunk region (Lowe et al., 2003; Pani et al., 2012; R€
ottinger
and Lowe, 2012). These overlapping similarities suggest that at
least parts of the gene regulatory networks that pattern the chor-
date CNS were likely present in the common ancestor of the deu-
terostomes and the hemichordate proboscis and collar could be
considered an early representation of the chordate head. No chor-
date has been shown to regenerate an anterior head or CNS after
complete amputation and, therefore, hemichordates are vital to
revealing gene networks regulating CNS regeneration in the
deuterostomes.
We compared regeneration in P. flava and identified several
putative orthologs of chordate CNS patterning genes that are up-
regulated after 3 and 4 days of regeneration. The regeneration
blastema has formed at these time points, and cells continue to
proliferate to generate a rudimentary proboscis at 3 to 4 days
postbisection of the animal. Sine oculis homeobox 3 (six3), dis-
tal-less (dll), paired box homeobox 6 (pax6), and frizzled-5 are all
significantly up-regulated at the 96-hr time point, which is just
as the proboscis begins to form. Six3, Pax6, and dll are transcrip-
tion factors that are involved with patterning the chordate fore-
brain (Echevarria et al., 2003; Wilson and Houart, 2004; Paek
et al., 2009). Frizzled-related Wnt antagonists have been shown
to be necessary and sufficient to establish the telencephalon
region of the chordate brain (Houart et al., 2002; Paek et al.,
2009). Of the 26 putative transcription factors identified as being
differentially expressed in this study, 7 of them are known to be
involved in head and neural development and they are all signifi-
cantly up-regulated 3 and 4 days into regeneration as the rudi-
mentary proboscis is beginning to form. It is likely that other
chordate head genes are up-regulated during anterior regenera-
tion in P. flava, but they are possibly expressed at later time
points as the proboscis continues to regenerate and the collar
begins to form. Future studies will be aimed at identifying these
transcripts and their expression domains.
Conclusions
We have shown that Ptychodera flava regeneration is not strictly
a morphological recapitulation of development. There is exten-
sive temporal plasticity during regeneration, as well as different
modes of acquiring the same anterior structures. Putative ortho-
logs of chordate head genes are also significantly up-regulated
just before anterior proboscis regeneration. It will be interesting
and informative to discover whether additional head genes are
expressed as the proboscis and collar undergo regeneration and
we will then use in situ hybridization to localize gene expression
in regenerating tissues.
The origin of blastemal cells in P. flava still remains to be
determined. Our lab is currently working to determine whether
this animal uses genuine stem cells or dedifferentiated somatic
cells to propagate missing tissue. In humans, when a cell differ-
entiates into a particular cell type, the cell fate assignment nor-
mally cannot be reversed or transformed. If hemichordates are
using dedifferentiated cells to elaborate new tissue, this may
reveal cell signaling pathways necessary for the gain and loss of
cell fates in the deuterostomes.
Experimental Procedures
Animal Collection and Management
Ptychodera flava were collected at Paiko Peninsula in Honolulu,
Hawaii, in early November. During low tide, when the water level
was approximately 3 feet deep, animals were removed from the
coral beds by snorkeling. The light sand cover was fanned by
hand to expose the underlying coral and hemichordates. Animals
were collected into 50-ml tubes and carried back to the lab with
the tubes immersed in a cooler with sea water.

 Animals were bisected at the level of the anterior hepatic sacs
and allowed to regenerate for various time points (Figs. 1 and 2).
Regenerating worms were kept in running seawater tanks at
Kewalo Marine Laboratory at 27�C during regeneration. Some
worms were collected and shipped to the University of Washing-
ton in Seattle, Washington, and kept at 26�C while regenerating.
Animals were immersed in a 1:1 solution of sea water and 7.5%
MgCl2 for 15 min to relax muscles and constrain movement and
then observed with a Nikon 1000 dissecting microscope and pho-
tographed with a Cool Snap camera. Pictures were taken daily for
15 days and near daily thereafter until 55 days post bisection.
Histology
Regenerating animals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline overnight at room temperature and
stored at -20�C in 100% methanol. They were placed into 100%
ethanol for, 20 min at room temperature and then moved to a 1:1
mixture of 100% ethanol and polyester wax (nine parts Poly (eth-
ylene glycol) [400] distearate and one part 1-hexadecanol, (Poly-
sciences, Warrington, PA) (Steedman, 1957; Norenburg and
Barrett 1987) at 40�C for 1 hr. The animals were then moved to
100% polyester wax at 40�C for 1 hr and then embedded in fresh
100% polyester wax. Next, 7-mm sections were cut on a Spencer
829 microtome and mounted on gelatin subbed slides. Slides
were deparaffinized, and processed through Milligan’s trichrome
staining, a histological stain that differentiates muscle cells,
nuclei, and cartilage (Fig. 3; Presnell and Schreibman, 1997).
Slides were rinsed in 95% ethanol and treated for 5 min with
potassium dichromate HCl mordant and then rinsed in distilled
water. Slides were then stained for 5 min in acid fuchsin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) and rinsed again in distilled water. Slides were
then stained 5 min in phosphomolybdic acid (Sigma) followed by
5 min in Orange G (Sigma) and then rinsed in distilled water.
Finally, slides were treated for 2 min in 1% glacial acetic acid
and stained 5 min with Fast Green FCF (Sigma) and then treated
again for 3 min with 1% glacial acetic acid. Slides were dehy-
drated with ethanol and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientif-
ic, Pittsburgh, PA). Sections were photographed using a Nikon
Eclipse E600 microscope mounted with a Cool Snap camera.
RNA Isolation and cDNA Preparation
Following bisection, animals were allowed to regenerate for
either 2 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, or 96 hr. Between
50 and 100 mg of tissue were removed with a sterile, feather sur-
gical blade from the cut site of the posterior segment in four
regenerating animals at each time point (Fig. 1A–C). Four
healthy, intact animals were bisected and total RNA was isolated
from the cut site of the posterior half to serve as reference con-
trols. RNA was isolated from the tissue using either a Promega
SV Total RNA Isolation System, catalog number Z3100, or a USB
PrepEase RNA Spin Kit, part number 78766 1 KT. RNA was ana-
lyzed on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer for nucleic
acid concentration and purity and then stored at -80�C until
cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScriptV
R III First-Strand
Synthesis System for RT-PCR by Invitrogen.
cDNA Library Preparation and Sequencing
mRNAseq libraries for sequencing were generated from 1 to 1.5
mg of high quality total RNA, as assessed using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer. RNA was purified using poly-T oligo-attached mag-
netic beads. Libraries were made according to the manufacturer’s
directions for the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, RS-
122-2101). Resulting short fragment libraries were checked for
quality and quantity using the Bioanalyzer. Equal molar libraries
were pooled, requantified and sequenced as 100 bp paired read
on the Illumina HiSeq, 2000 instrument using HiSeq Control
Software 1.5.15. Following sequencing, Illumina Primary Analy-

Transcriptome Assembly and Annotation
To create a reference for expression analysis, paired end sequence
files from all P. flava experimental time points were pooled
(605,821,125 pairs totaling 122,164,225,000 bp) and assembled
using Trinity, version r2013-02-25, (Grabherr et al., 2011), with
default parameters. We vector clipped and contaminate filtered
the resulting assembly with SeqClean, version, 2011-02-22, (Seq-
Clean, 2011). The resulting transcriptome reference contained
527,715 sequences, with an average length of 1,022, and N50 of
1,961, 208,773 of these sequences contain an ORF of at least 60
amino acids. All sequences were used for expression analysis
with sequences from the same Trinity “component,” roughly
equal to a gene, treated as a single gene.
To maximize the utility of this transcriptome assembly,
sequences were annotated with the best BLASTx (Camacho et al.,
2008) hit to Swissprot (UniProt, 2015) and NCBI’s NR database,
using an e-value cutoff of 0.001. We also identified PFAM (Finn
et al., 2014) domains present in P. flava transcripts using
hmmscan, version 3.1b1, from the HMMER package (Eddy, 2011)
with an e-value cutoff of 0.01. In addition, we annotated these
transcripts with tmhmm, version 2.0c, (Krogh et al., 2001) signalP
version 4.1 (Petersen et al., 2011), and ncoils (Lupas et al., 1991).
We identified putative transcription factors based on PFAM
domain hits using a list from transcriptionfactor.org. For tran-
scripts with multiple isoforms, annotations were collapsed to the
gene level as determined by Trinity.
Differential Expression Analysis
To identify differentially expressed genes, single end reads from
each time point were aligned to the transcriptome using Bowtie2
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with default parameters. Align-
ments were quantified using Samtools (Li et al., 2009). Isoform
counts were summed to generate a “per gene” count. Differential
expression analysis and normalization was performed using the
R package DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). All time points were con-
trasted with the zero hour (0 hr) time point. Data used for the
gene expression analysis have been deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE70295.
Hierarchical Clustering and Heatmaps
To select genes of interest for clustering, differentially expressed
genes (P < 1e-5), having an expression level log2 fold change
greater than one or less than negative one, for one or more time

 points, and having a hit to the Swissprot protein database were
identified. These genes were hierarchically clustered on the dis-
tances of the Pearson correlation of the log2 fold change, using
the complete linkage method to find similar clusters (Figs. 5 and
6, 7, 8). Significantly differentially expressed genes (P < 1e-5)
that had transcription factor domains were clustered on the dis-
tances of the Pearson correlation of the log2 fold change, using
Ward’s minimum variance method to find similar clusters (Fig.
9). All heatmaps were created using the R package pheatmap
(Kolde, 2013).
Gene Ontology Analysis
Gene Ontology (GO) (Gene Ontology, 2015) terms were assigned
to each P. flava gene based upon homologous PFAM domains
and significant Swissprot hits. These terms were used to impute
functional categories of differentially expressed genes and calcu-
late categorical enrichment. The GO slim terms used were from
the generic GO slim terms list available at the Gene Ontology
Web site. GO term enrichment was performed using the R pack-
age topGO (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2010). To examine higher-
level GO terms, significantly enriched (P < 0.01) GO terms were
mapped to select higher-level GO terms using GO.db. These select
GO terms were then mapped to the significantly differentially
expressed genes (P < 1e-5) (Fig. 10).
