Abstract  
Many studies have sought to determine whether there is an association between air quality and 
acute deaths in the US. Additionally, many consider it plausible that current levels of air quality 
cause acute deaths. However, several factors call causation and even association into question. 
Multiple testing and multiple modeling and various biases can lead to false positive findings.  
Moreover, the fact that most data sets used in studies evaluating the relationships among air 
quality and public health outcomes are not publicly available makes reproducing the results 
nearly impossible. Here we have publicly available a dataset containing daily air quality levels, 
PM2.5 and ozone, daily temperature levels, minimum and maximum and daily relative humidity 
levels for the eight most populous California air basins. Over two million death certificates were 
obtained from the state of California and daily death counts in the eight air basins were derived. 
We analyzed the dataset using a standard time series analysis, a moving median analysis, and a 
prediction analysis in which we use leave-one-year-out cross validation analysis to evaluate 
predictions. Both standard time series analysis and the moving medians analysis found little 
evidence for association between air quality and acute deaths. The prediction analysis process 
was a run as a large factorial design using different models. We use holdout predictive mean 
square error to assess prediction. Among the variables used to predict acute death, most of the 
daily death variability was explained by time of year or weather variables. In summary, neither 
PM2.5 nor ozone added appreciably to the prediction of daily deaths. The empirical evidence is 
that current levels of air quality, ozone and PM2.5, are not causally related to acute deaths for 
California.  
 
 
 Introduction  
The purposes of this paper are threefold: First, we describe a data set we develop and make 
publically available that is useful for time-series analyses for air quality and acute deaths. 
Second, we provide three analyses of the data set. Third, we discuss the implications of our 
analysis results for the broader question of air quality and health effects.  
The National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the White House all support open 
access to data used in scientific papers [1-3]. In 1985 Joe Cecil [4] noted that “As an abstract 
principle, the sharing of research data is a noble goal and meets with little opposition. However, 
when data sharing is attempted in a particular circumstance, the conflicting interests of the 
parties can thwart the exchange.” Our experience has been that it is difficult to get public access 
to data sets used in studies evaluating the relationships among public health outcomes and air 
quality. Consequently, we obtained raw data, built our own analysis-ready data set, and now 
make the data set publically available. Briefly, the data set contains daily counts of deaths in the 
eight most populous air basins in California for the years 2000-2012, air quality levels for ozone 
and PM2.5, minimum and maximum temperature, and relative humidity.  
Any large, complex observational data set, including a time series environmental epidemiology 
data set, can be problematic for analysis [5-7]. In 1978, Herbert Schimmel [5] was one of the 
first to comment that claimed time series results could vary depending on how the data was 
analyzed. We analyze our data set using three different methods. Briefly, our first method uses 
moving medians with gaps, described later, to track the central distribution of the data, then 
computes deviations of observed values from the estimated daily central value, e.g. deviations of 
daily all cause deaths, ozone, PM2.5, weather variables, etc. Our second method uses time series 
regression analysis [8-9]. Our third method examines the predictive power of air quality and 
weather variables of daily deaths and uses leave one year out prediction means square error.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The data sources and protocol used to generate the 
analysis-ready data set is described in Section 2. The methods and results of all three methods 
are described in Section 3. Finally, a discussion is provided in Section 4. In addition, the publicly 
available analysis-ready data-set is provided at http://www.unc.edu/~rls/CApollution.html and 
extensive supplementary material is available as part of the online publication. 
 
2.0 Data and Sources 
California is divided into air basins. Within air basins, weather and topography are similar. A 
map of California with all the air basins is given in Figure 1. We obtained electronic death 
certificate data without personal identifiers for all of California for the years 2000-2012. We 
chose to use the eight most populous air basins for which death counts are large enough that we 
could expect to see significant association if they exist.

Board) 
 
2.1 Mortality  
The state of California provides access to the death public use files for the purpose of research. 
The available variables are given Supplemental Death Public Use files [10]. The cause of death 
is indicated by an ICD 10 code and the corresponding group cause of death is determined using 
the group cause of death codes from the Department of Health Services Center for Health 
Statistics. See California Department of Public Health, www.cdph.ca.gov for how to obtain the 
raw death data. The total number of deaths of individuals over 65-74 and 75+ years of age with 
group cause of death categorized as AllCauses or HeartLung where HeartLung deaths were 
attributed to “Diseases of the Circulatory System” or “Diseases of the Respiratory System”. We 
created four outcome death categories: 65-74 AllCause, 65-74 HeartLung,  75+ AllCause, 75+ 
HeartLung. Note accidental deaths were excluded from our analyses. 
2.2 Air Quality 
The California Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Resources Board provides an Air Quality 
Data (PST) Query tool at the following website http://www.arb.ca.gov/aqmis2/aqdselect.php  
[11]. Daily data can be retrieved for each combination of basin, day, and year. The following 
statistics were retrieved on July 19, 2014: 
1. Daily Average PM2.5 in µg m−3 
2. Daily Average Ozone in parts per billion (ppb) 
3. Daily Max 8 Hour Overlapping Average Ozone – State in ppb 
4. Daily Max 8 Hour Overlapping Average Ozone – National in ppb 
 
2.3 Temperature  
The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) maintains data from the United 
States Historical Climatology Network. Daily temperature data was retrieved from the following 
website http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ushcn_daily/ for each combination of basin, day, and year the 
minimum and maximum temperature were derived [12]. 
 
2.4 Humidity  
The US Environmental Protection Agency maintains daily humidity data. Daily humidity data 
was downloaded from http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/detaildata/downloadaqsdata.htm, [13]. 
For each combination of basin, day, and year the maximum relative humidity was derived. 
 
3.0 Statistical Methods and Results 
3.1 Robust Case Crossover Method and Results 
 The case crossover method is a standard method for examining acute effects in time series data 
[14, 15]. All individuals are cases, there are no selected controls, and time-displaced cases serve 
as controls. For the cases we consider a 21-day moving window. The center of the window, day 
11, is the time point at issue. We compute a median of points 1-8, 14-21 and contrast that to the 
day 11 point. In effect we compute a deviation from the estimated time trend. The two points left 
and right of the time point of interest are omitted from the estimated time trend to partially 
remove any very local effect. The notation for our moving median is 21-5, 21 days with 5 center 
days removed. Our method closely resembles a bidirectional, time-stratified case crossover 
design [15]. The use of a 21-day window is in the range of typical time windows [15] used in air 
pollution studies. The omitting of points near the point of interest is used in an attempt to 
decrease the influence of spikes on the moving median [15]. The use of a moving median with a 
gap is novel so far as we know. A SAS JMP addin [16] is available from the first author to 
compute this time series trend estimate. This moving median is also used to estimate time trends 
in air quality and meteorological variables. Deviations from that trend are computed, giving a 
deviation for each day where the trend can be computed. A touted advantage of a case crossover 
design is that the cases within the window are expected to be very similar with respect to many 
covariates; there is time-local control. 
 
Moving median deviations and simple two-way plots of raw data and are presented first to give 
the reader a sense of part of the data set. We use South Central Coast (Los Angeles) data as the 
number of daily deaths is high and pollution levels in LA are relatively high. If there are 
pronounced effects we should see them.  
 
Partial correlations are computed by first predicting each variable using multiple linear 
regression of the other variables and then correlating the residuals for each pair of variables. 
Partial correlations are used for inferring potentially causal relationships among variables as they 
are adjusted for other variables under consideration. We use the JMP addin Partial Correlation 
Diagram. 
 
Temperature 
The analysis in this section is limited to the South Central Coast air basin, Los Angeles. The 
response variable was daily all cause deaths for people 75 and older. To illustrate the utility of 
the moving median analysis consider the relationship between death and maximum temperature, 
Figure 2. It is shown that as maximum temperature increases the number of daily deaths 
decreases. However, the effect may be confounded by other variables that are seasonal. Note the 
seasonal relationship between death and time of year, Figure 3. The moving median is used to 
model the relationship between death and time of year and temperature and time of year with a 
21-5 moving median. Deviations from the moving medians are then calculated for both all cause 
deaths and maximum temperature, denoted as D All Cause 75 and D Tmax, respectively. The 
relationship between these two variables illustrates that a spike in temperature as measured by a 
large deviation from the moving median is complemented by a spike in daily deaths as measured 
 by a deviation from the moving median, Figure 4. Sup 3.1 A gives a 2x2 multiple scatter plot of 
All Cause deaths 65-74 and 75+ by mint and maxT. Older individuals appear to be sensitive to 
an increase in maxT. 
 
Figure 2. All Cause daily deaths of people 75 and older are plotted against the maximum daily 
temperature. Each dot represents the number of daily deaths. Accidental deaths are removed. 
Non-parametric density contours are added to help visualize the relationship. 
Figure 3. Daily all cause deaths are plotted against time, 2000-2012. A spline is fit to the data to 
help visually track the density of the points. 
Figure 4. Deviations of daily deaths are plotted against deviation of daily temperature. A spline 
indicates that as the there is a spike in daily maximum temperature there is an increase in daily 
deaths. Three sets of points are colored, red, green and aqua where the spike in temperature is 
15-28 degrees higher than the moving median. 
 
 
Ozone 
A similar analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between all cause deaths for people 
75 and older (deaths) and daily max 8 hour lag ozone (ozone). The bivariate relationship between 
deaths and ozone is shown in Figure 5. The moving medians for both time series are plotted in 
Figure 6. The result is a smoothed relationship between each of the variables with time. Note 
both ozone and deaths are seasonal over time and are out of phase. As ozone increases, deaths 
decrease. Deviations from the moving medians are calculated and the relationship between the 
deviations is illustrated graphically in Figure 7. Note there is no apparent effect of ozone on 
deaths. Sup 3.1 B gives multiple scatter graphs with lags of 0, 1, and 2 days of Deviations of 
Death vs Deviations of ozone from their moving medians. There is no apparent association of 
deaths with ozone. There are 96 scatter graphs, 8 air basins, 4 death outcomes and 3 lags. 
 
Figure 5. All Cause daily deaths of people 75 and older are plotted against the maximum 8-our 
daily ozone. Each dot represents the number of daily deaths. Accidental deaths are removed. 
Non-parametric density contours are plotted to help overcome the overprinting. 
 
Figure 6. The moving medians for all cause deaths and ozone are plotted against time, 13 years, 
red o for deaths and blue + for ozone. 
 
Figure 7. Deviations of daily deaths are plotted against deviation of daily ozone. A spline 
indicates that when the there is a spike in daily ozone, there is little or no effect on daily deaths. 
The density does not go from lower left to upper right. Dramatic increases in ozone have 
essentially no effect on deaths. 
  
 
PM2.5 
A similar analysis was used to assess the relationship between all cause deaths and PM2.5, see 
Figures 8 and 9. Again, there is no apparent effect of PM2.5 on deaths. Sup 3.1 C gives multiple 
scatter graphs with lags of 0, 1, and 2 days of Deviations of Death vs Deviations of PM2.5 from 
their moving medians. There is no apparent association of deaths with PM2.5. There are 96 scatter 
graphs, 8 air basins, 4 death outcomes and 3 lags. 
 
Figure 8. All Cause daily deaths of people 75 and older are plotted against the PM2.5. Each dot 
represents the number of daily deaths. Accidental deaths are removed. Non-parametric density 
contours are plotted to help overcome the overprinting. A spline fit to the data indicates no 
association of deaths with PM2.5 levels. 
 
Figure 9. Deviations of All Cause daily deaths of people 75 and older are plotted against the 
deviations of PM2.5 from yearly medians. There is no indication of any association.  
Partial Correlations 
See Figure 10. There are strong positive (thick red lines) and negative (thick blue lines) partial 
correlations among the weather variables. PM2.5 and ozone have high partial correlations with 
MAXRH and Tmax. Tmin has a high partial correlation with MAXRH and Tmax. All Cause 
mortality has weak, positive correlations with Tmin and Tmax. Partial correlations between All 
Cause mortality and air pollution variables are inconsequential (thin lines and multiple testing 
adjusted p-values, results not shown).

3.2 Time Series Analysis of California Mortality Data 
The time series model is adapted from models previously used for the National Morbidity, 
Mortality and Air Pollution (NMMAPS) data series; see in particular [8, 9, 18]. The code used 
for the results in the present paper is at www.unc.edu/~rls/EpiTimeSeriesCodeRLS.txt [19].  
 
The basic model is of the form 
Log(µt) = Overall Mean + DLM(l1,…,lk) + s(t, nyr*df0) + DOW  
                 + s(M1(t); df1) + s((M1(t-1) + M1(t-2) + M1(t-3))/3; df2)  
                 + … + s(Mp(t); df1)+ s((Mp(t-1) + Mp(t-2) + Mp(t-3))/3; df2)           (1) 
 where 
µt is expected number of deaths on day t; 
DLM(l1,…,lk) refers to a (linear) distributed lag model for the air pollution variable; this 
includes regression terms β1(X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k + β2{ X(t- l2) - (X(t- l1) + 
X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k} + … + βk{ X(t- lk) - (X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k} 
where the lead coefficient β1 represents the mean rise in mortality per one unit rise in air 
pollution X, distributed over lags l1,…,lk; 
s(t, nyr*df0) refers to a natural spline on time variable t over nyr years with df0 degrees of 
freedom per year; this represents the long-term trend (including seasonal component); 
DOW is a day of week component (treated as a factor variable with 6 degrees of 
freedom); 
s(M1(t); df1) represents a nonlinear trend on current-day value of met variable M1 with df1 
degrees of freedom; 
s((M1(t-1) + M1(t-2) + M1(t-3))/3; df2) represents a nonlinear trend on the average of the 
three previous days of met variable M1 with df2 degrees of freedom; 
other met variables M2,…,Mp are treated similarly to M1; 
days with missing data are omitted from the analysis; 
the model is fitted as a generalized linear model with log link and quasipoisson mean-
variance structure; this is similar to assuming a Poisson distribution but with an 
additional parameter representing overdispersion. 
 
In addition to fitting model (1) with all the variables, we have also fitted the model without the 
air pollution component and dropping some of the meteorological terms. A likelihood ratio test is 
conducted when each of the terms from s(M1(t); df1) to s((Mp(t-1) + Mp(t-2) + Mp(t-3))/3; df2) is 
dropped; this is an additional check that the selection of meteorological terms is appropriate.  
 
For the California analysis, we have used three meteorological variables: daily maximum 
temperature, daily minimum temperature and daily mean relative humidity. Previous NMMAPS 
studies including [8] have used two meteorological variables, daily mean temperature and 
dewpoint, but otherwise the same model form as above. For the degrees of freedom, in previous 
studies df0 has been typically taken between 7 and 12, df1 and df2 between 3 and 6; we have 
varied these by trial and error to understand the sensitivity of the analysis to these choices. 
 
The most critical component of the model (1) is the selection of lags l1,…,lk to represent the air 
pollution component. The NMMAPS analyses in Bell [15] and Smith [8] used lags 0, 1, 2,…,6 
(in some cases with an additional refinement, the constrained distributed lag model in which 
 some of the coefficients β2,…,βk are constrained to be equal; however, this usually has only 
minor impact on the important coefficient β1). Other common approaches use any of lags 0, 1, 2 
in a single-lag model, or averages over any combination of lags 0, 1, 2, 3. For the present study, 
we have tried different combinations of lags to look for the lag combination that best represents 
the air pollution effect. We believe this approach to be justified in view of the weak evidence for 
any air pollution effect in these dataset; however, in view of the selection bias inherent in such an 
approach, we caution against over-interpretation of such results, especially in cases where the p-
value is over 0.01 or the result highly depend on the selection of a particular combination of lags.  
South Coast Air Basin 
The approach outlined in the previous section is applied to data from each of eight California air 
basins, Figure. 1. Because they are the two most populated air basins, we concentrate initially on 
the South Coast air basin (which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
Counties) and the San Francisco Bay air basin (San Francisco, Marin, Sonoma, Napa, Solano, 
Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties). For the response variable in this 
analysis, we use total non-accidental mortality among people aged 65 and over. 
 
Fitting the meteorological model alone, in Table 1 we tabulate the p-value associated with 
dropping each of the six terms in turn. Five of the meteorological variables are very highly 
significant; the only exception is current-day relative humidity. This result is based on the 
particular choices df0=7, df1=df2=6, but the overall conclusion is robust against alternative values 
of those three degree of freedom parameters.

Table. 1: Statistical significance of meteorological components: based on model (1) without air 
pollution component and with df0=7, df1=df2=6, fitted to nonaccidental mortality for ages 65 and 
up, South Coast air basin. 
 In subsequent analyses, we have retained all six meteorology components; this is to ensure 
consistency across different air basins and to avoid the analysis being biased by overuse of 
statistical significance tests; however, Table. 1 is evidence that we have identified appropriate 
meteorological variables for the overall analysis. 
We now consider addition air pollution variables to the meteorological model in Table 1. 
Initially, we concentrate on ozone. Table 2 shows the coefficient estimates, standard error (SE), 
t-value and p-value associated with ozone at various combination of lags. The units here are 
percent rise in mortality per 10 ppb rise in ozone. The strongest positive coefficient is based on 
lags 0, 1, 2 and 3, for which the model predicts a 0.1% rise in mortality per 10 ppb rise in ozone. 
However, neither this nor any of the other values in the table comes anywhere close to being 
statistically significant. This is for 13 years of data over one of the most densely populated areas 
of the US – if there is an ozone-mortality effect in California, we ought to see it here.

South Coast air basin; response variable is non-accidental mortality aged 65 and over. 
The same analysis was tried using PM2.5 in place of ozone, with results shown in Table 3. In this 
case, several of the estimates appear to be statistically significant with a p-value <0.05 (smallest 
value 0.017), but all the statistically significant values are negative, which is not biologically 
plausible. We conclude that either the small p-values are an artifact of the selection effect already 
 mentioned, or there is some other biological mechanism, such as confounding by some other 
pollutant, that explains these results.

South Coast air basin; response variable is non-accidental mortality aged 65 and over.  
 In these analyses, the overdispersion parameter was of the order of 1.07 – in other words, the 
variance of the mortality variables is inflated by a factor of 1.07 compared with the Poisson 
distribution. This is typical for this kind of analysis and does not indicate a problem. A much 
larger overdispersion parameter could indicate some important missing covariates. 
San Francisco Bay Air Basin 
So far, we have only considered one air basin. The second most populated is San Francisco Bay, 
which has substantially different weather patterns and demographics from the Los Angeles area. 
Therefore, the entire analysis has been repeated for this air basin, as a test of how robust the 
analyses are for different regions of the state. 
Table 4 shows the statistical significance of the individual meteorology components, analogous 
to Table 1 for the South Coast air basin. The main difference from Table 1 is that neither of the 
components due to relative humidity is statistically significant. (Although not reported in the 
table, if both relative humidity components – current day and the average of lags 1, 2, 3 – are 
dropped together, rather than one at a time, we also do not get a statistically significant 
 component due to relative humidity.) In the following analyses, to maintain consistency of 
analysis methods across different air basins, the main results are still reported including relative 
humidity, but to assess the sensitivity to this component, some of the analyses have been 
repeated omitting relative humidity altogether.

pollution component and with df0=7, df1=df2=6, fitted to nonaccidental mortality for ages 65 and 
up, San Francisco Bay air basin. 
Table 5 shows the results when ozone is added to the analysis. As with our earlier analyses for 
the South Coast air basin, none of the estimates of the ozone effect at various lags is statistically 
significant at the 0.05 level. However, two of the analyses (with lag 0 alone, and with lags 0 and 
1 together) are statistically significant with a p-value of about .02 if the relative humidity 
component is omitted. This result illustrates the principle that if enough different models are 
tried, it is usually possible to find some model that gives a statistically significant result: it does 
not imply that the result is significant in any practical sense. It should also be noted, however, 
that all the coefficients of models that include lag 0 are similar in magnitude (between 0.3 and 
0.6): the variation in p-values is mostly due to their standard errors.

Table 5: Statistical significance of ozone component with various combinations of lags: based 
on model (1) df0=7, df1=df2=6. Relative humidity is omitted from some of the analyses. Estimate 
is percent rise in mortality for 10 ppb rise in ozone. San Francisco Bay air basin; response 
variable is non-accidental mortality aged 65 and over. 
 
Table 6 shows the corresponding results for PM2.5, where again relative humidity has been 
omitted from some of the analyses to illustrate the sensitivity to this component. Our conclusions 
are similar: some rows of this table show a statistically significant effect with a p-value of the 
order 0.02, but taking account of the number of models examined in order to achieve this result, 
it is unlikely to be of practical significance. 
The overdispersion parameter for these analyses was around 1.05.

Table 6: Statistical significance of PM2.5 component with various combinations of lags: based on 
model (1) df0=7, df1=df2=6. Relative humidity is omitted from some of the analyses. Estimate is 
percent rise in mortality for 10 µg/m3 rise in PM2.5. San Francisco Bay air basin; response 
variable is non-accidental mortality aged 65 and over. 
 
 Combining Results Across Air Basins 
In the NMMAPS papers on ozone [9, 18], the single-city analyses were repeated for up to 98 US 
cities for which ozone and mortality data were available. They were then combined across cities 
using a hierarchical model analysis, based on an algorithm originally due to Everson and Morris 
[21] and coded by Roger Peng into the R function “tlnise” [22]. The same method is used here to 
produce estimates that are combined across all eight air basins in our study. It would not be 
practicable (or interpretable) to repeat all the analyses for every combination of meteorological 
variables, lags of the pollutant variable, or degrees of freedom for the spline components of the 
 model. Therefore, some choices were made, guided by the analyses already conducted for the 
South Coast and San Francisco Bay air basins, as follows: 
1. All analyses used all six meteorological variables. 
2. The degree of freedom parameters were set to be respectively 7, 6 and 6, for df0, df1 and 
df2. 
3. For both ozone and PM2.5, only certain combinations of lags were tried.  
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 7. None of the analyses show a statistically 
significant effect when combined across all eight air basins.

Table 7: Combined results across all eight air basins. 
 All the analyses in this paper so far are based on total non-accidental mortality for ages 65 and 
up. The analysis was repeated using (a) total non-accidental mortality for all ages, (b) respiratory 
deaths aged 65 and up, (c) circulatory deaths aged 65 and up, (b) combined respiratory and 
circulatory deaths aged 65 and up. None of these produced a statistically significant result in the 
combined analyses. 
The results of Table 7 were also repeated with the choices df0=7, df1=6, df2=6 replaced by (a) 
df0=10, df1=6, df2=6, (b) df0=7, df1=3, df2=3, (c) df0=10, df1=3, df2=3. The analysis of Table 7 
was also repeated with relative humidity omitted from the analysis. None of these changes 
produced a statistically significant result in any of the combined analyses.

 Comparisons with NMMAPS 
We have pointed out that the statistical methods of this paper are similar to those of the 
NMMAPS study; see in particular [8, 15], but they are not identical. Those papers also included 
an interaction effect between age and long-term trend, and the meteorological variables were 
daily mean temperature and dewpoint, rather than those of the present paper. What happens if we 
use exactly the same methods for the two datasets? 
To investigate this question, we recompiled the NMMAPS dataset but using tmax, tmin and daily 
max relative humidity as the meteorological variables. (Those variables are all in the NMMAPS 
dataset, but were not used in the previously cited papers.) The dataset was analyzed using the 
same computer code as the other analyses in this paper, applied to deaths aged 65 and over 
analyzed as a single age group (no interactions). We took df0=7, df1=df2=6 as in most of the 
analyses in this paper, and the distributed lag structure based on lags 0 through 6.  
Since the rest of this paper is concerned with California data, we concentrated on the California 
cities in the NMMAPS database. Table 8 shows results for each city, and the combined result for 
all 12 California cities. Also shown in Table 8 is the national result, in which the 12 California 
cities were combined with 86 other US cities, reanalyzed using the software of the present paper.

Table 8: Estimates for the ozone effect in 12 California cities from the NMMAPS study (San 
Francisco omitted because of lack of ozone data). Also shown are the combined results from all 
12 cities under “All CA”, and the combined results of all 98 US cities included in the NMMAPS 
ozone study. Applied to all deaths aged 65 and up, using tmax, tmin and maximum relative 
humidity as the three meteorological variables, and a distributed lag model for ozone covering 
lags 0-6.  
 The last result shows a combined estimate of 0.287 (percent rise in mortality per 10 ppb rise in 
8-hour daily max ozone) and a standard error (more precisely, posterior standard deviation) of 
0.0915. By comparison, the result quoted in Smith [9] was a combined estimate of 0.411 and a 
posterior standard deviation of 0.080. Just to make a further comparison with the results of Smith 
[9], the method of the present paper was repeated with mortality data from all age groups 55 and 
up (the same as in the original NMMAPS analyses) – in this case our estimated combined 
national coefficient, using the meteorological model of the present paper, rises only very slightly, 
from 0.287 to 0.300. Therefore, the difference in combined estimates compared with Smith [9] 
appears to be due to the different meteorological variables used and not to the different 
 treatments of age groups. It seems plausible that the treatment of meteorology in the present 
paper (in particular, the separate use of tmax and tmin) is superior to the treatment in the earlier 
NMMAPS papers, resulting in a lower estimate of the ozone effect because of less confounding 
by weather.  
Nonlinear Distributed Lag Models 
In this section, we consider an extension of the preceding analyses that allows for the leading air 
pollution term to be nonlinear. 
Specifically, where we have previously defined the DLM(l1,…,lk) to have components 
β1(X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k + β2{ X(t- l2) - (X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k} + … + 
βk{ X(t- lk) - (X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k},                                                     (2) 
we now replace the term β1(X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k by a nonlinear term of form 
s((X(t- l1) + X(t- l2) + … + X(t- lk))/k; df3),                                                                 (3) 
in other words, a nonlinear spline in the average air pollution variable over all k lags, with df3 
degrees of freedom. As in previous discussions of nonlinear spline terms, there is no hard and 
fast rule for choosing df3, but in subsequent discussion we have generally set it equal to 6 since 
this is large enough in most cases to show a clear nonlinearity but not so large that the model is 
distorted by evident overfitting.  
The proposed model (3) is not as general as that of [23], which will be considered in Section 3.3 
of the present paper. The current model is simpler to fit and to interpret. On the other hand, by 
retaining the linear terms β2,…,βk in (2), the model is more general than that of Bell et al. [24], 
who used a spline term in the average ozone at lags 0 and 1, but without any “distributed lag” 
component. 
The model formed by combining (1) and (3), based on lags 0,1,2, and 3, was fitted to all eight 
California air basins for both ozone and PM2.5. Selected results are in Figures 11 and 12; results 
for other air basins are similar. In neither case is there any evidence of a systematic increase in 
risk with ozone or PM2.5.

residuals from the model that includes long-term trends, day of week and meteorology, plotted 
against the air pollution variable (ozone). Red solid and dashed curves: implied change of 
relative risk with respect to ozone level 0.075 ppm (the current ozone standard), with pointwise 
95% confidence bands.

Analogous to Figure 11, using the full meteorological model (including relative humidity), and a 
nonlinear model for the relationship between PM2.5 and mortality. 
 
  
 
 
3.3 Prediction, Methods and Results 
 
With any large, complex, observational data set there are usually a lot of questions that can be 
considered. It is well-known that if you ask a lot of questions and employ a lot of modeling that 
false associations can result [6, 7, 27]. If effects are discovered, it is useful to know their relative 
importance. With all of this in mind we designed a factorial experiment to explore multiple 
questions and modeling that can be applied to the California data set.  
 
The factorial experiment included, given in detail below: Health Endpoints, 4 levels; Air Basins, 
8 levels; Air Quality variables including lags, 7 levels; Weather variables including lags, 9 
levels; Time as Thin Plate Regression Splines. It is well-known that deaths follow a seasonal 
pattern, high in winter and low in summer. See Figure 3. Examination of the analysis results 
pointed to the importance of time in the analysis. All together over 78k models were fit. Our 
initial thinking was that if air quality was important for the health effects at issue, we should see 
a consistent pattern of results from the analysis across air basins and years. 
 
The notation in this section differs somewhat from that in Section 3.2 so that the nature of the 
factorial modeling experiment is clear and that this section is somewhat self-contained. The basic 
data for Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 is the same. 
 
In effect, the factorial experiment is a very large sensitivity study made possible by automated 
software using cloud computing.

Response and Covariates 
Mortality, Response 
Using the death public use files provided by the state of California, we considered the total 
number of deaths in four different categories: 
 1. All cause deaths with accidents removed of individuals age 65 to 74, inclusive 
2. All cause deaths with accidents removed for individuals age greater than or equal to 75 
3. Death caused by diseases of the respiratory or circulatory systems individuals age 65 to 
74, inclusive 
4. Death caused by diseases of the respiratory or circulatory systems individuals age greater 
than or equal to 75 
All subsequent methods were carried out for each of these four death outcomes. For the sake of 
describing the methods, let Y   generically indicate the response variable.

For each combination of basin and response, the cross reduce function in the DLNM package in 
R was used to obtain the overall cumulative effect of ozone and the overall cumulative effect of 
PM2.5. The overall cumulative ozone effect is the risk of death at a particular value of ozone 
relative to an ozone level of 50 ppb. The overall cumulative PM2.5 effect is the risk of death at a 
particular value of PM2.5 relative to a PM2.5 level of 20 micrograms per cubic meter. The 
coefficient and variance of the overall cumulative effect for each combination of basin, response 
and air quality variable will be obtained.  
For each response and air quality variable, the 8 basin specific cumulative effect coefficients 
were combined using a meta-analysis framework as described in Gasparrini [25]. Let 
i
  be the 
basin specific cumulative effect and 
i
S  be the corresponding variance of the cumulative effect 
for each basin. We assume the following model for each basin

Results: Prediction Models 
Note due to missing covariate data in the calendar year 2000 results for that year as the hold-out 
year are omitted due to large numbers of missing values for predictions. 
By partitioning the air quality variable into two groups, Ozone (levels 1,2,3, and 4) and PM2.5 
(levels 1,5,6, and 7), 108 models were isolated for each combination of air quality group, basin, 
year, and response (4 levels of air quality X 3 levels of Max. Temp. X 3 levels of Min. Temp. X 
3 levels of Rel. Hum. = 108 models). Note 27 models appear in both groups because of the null 
level (level 1) of the air quality variable.  
First, the observed values for each combination of basin, year, and response were plotted (open 
circles) and the predictions from the 108 models were added to the same plot (solid red lines). 
Consider the results for the number of deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory or circulatory 
systems individuals age greater than or equal to 75 for the South Coast air basin for the Ozone 
group, Figure 13.  
Figure 13. Model hold out predictions for each year except 2000. “o” are the observed deaths and 
the red overlay are the model predictions. The models do not explain much of the variability and 
are essentially identical to one another. 
 
Despite the various forms of the 108 models, the variability of the predicted values is relatively 
small as illustrated by the overlapping red lines. Because the predictions are point estimates, 
prediction intervals that account for uncertainty would overlap and thus make the predictions 
virtually indistinguishable [27]. That is, in terms of predictive performance, the models perform 
similarly. Note a similar result for the other air basins in both ozone groups and the PM2.5 groups 
regardless of outcome (Sup Figures A1-A32 and B1-B32). 
Second, the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) was obtained for each model using the data 
from the year that was held out. For each combination of air quality group, basin, year, and 
response, the MSPE of the model that only includes time as a covariate,

calculate the ratio

 indexing  the 108 models considered for that combination of air 
quality group, basin, year and response. For a given model, if the ratio is greater than 1 then the 
model that only included time had a smaller MSPE and if the ratio is less than 1 then the 
 corresponding model had an MSPE smaller than the model that only included time. A boxplot of 
the 108 MSPE ratios for each combination of air quality group, basin, year, and response are 
presented (Figure 14 and Sup 3.3 C and Sup 3.3D, 32 scatter graphs each.)

predictions are made by varying the modeling variables. 
 
Consider the ratios of the MSPE of each of the 108 models for the same subset of data, number 
of deaths caused by diseases of the respiratory or circulatory systems individuals age greater than 
or equal to 75 for the South Coast air basin for Ozone group, Figure 13. Recall a value greater 
than 1 indicates the model had an MSPE larger than the model that include time effects only and 
if the value is less than 1 then the model had an MSPE smaller than the model that included time 
only. Note that in general the ratio of the MSPE relative to the MSPE of the model with time 
only fell between 0.98 and 1.02. Moreover, the variability of the ratio changes depending on 
which year is held out. In addition, the form model with the best MSPE (i.e. the smallest ratio) 
was not the consistent across year (Supplementary File 03 Prediction analysis results). In 
summary, the boxplots indicate that the differences in point-estimate predictions for hold-out 
years are small and there is not a consistent best form of the model. This result is consistent 
across response variable, air quality group, and basin (Supplementary Figures C1-C32, D1-
D32, and Supplementary File 1).

 4.0 Discussion 
In this paper we analyze daily death data for the eight most populous air basins in California for 
associations with air quality. We found no associations using our moving median analysis 
method and no consistent associations with our regression-based time series analysis. Moreover, 
we assessed the predictive capability of various models using a leave-one-year-out cross 
validation strategy. We found air quality variables most often do not add to the predictive ability 
of the model. Even when the predictive ability is improved, the improvement is negligible 
relative to a model that only uses time of year. Also the form of the air quality variable that 
improves prediction is inconsistent across basin/year combinations. In short, we were unable to 
find a consistent and meaningful relationship between air quality and acute death in any of the 
eight California air basins considered.  
The time series methods used in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 have become standard in studies of this 
nature. Daily death counts are fitted using a generalized linear model with log link and either 
Poisson or “quasipoisson” distributional form. The latter assumes the same mean-variance 
structure as the Poisson distribution but with one additional parameter representing 
overdispersion. In the analyses of this paper, the overdispersion parameter is typically of the 
order of 1.05 to 1.07, indicating only a slight departure from the Poisson distribution. However, 
the standard errors are slightly larger when the overdispersion parameter is included and this is 
therefore recommended as a conservative approach. 
The covariates included in the analysis are long-term trend, day of week and three 
meteorological variables: daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and relative 
humidity. The well-known NMMAPS dataset used daily mean temperature and dewpoint as the 
two meteorological variables, but in other respects the analysis is the same. In particular, for each 
meteorological variable we have included the current day’s value and the average of the three 
previous days’ values, each modeled nonlinearly through a smoothing spline. The degrees of 
freedom of these smoothing splines, as well as the one involving long-term trend, have been 
varied to allow us to study the sensitivity to that parameter. 
The trickiest aspect of the analysis is in deciding which lag or lags of the air pollution variable to 
include. Unlike the choice of degrees of freedom in the smoothing spline, the choice of lags for 
the air pollution analysis does appear to have a substantial effect on the estimated coefficients. In 
these analyses, we have tried a total of ten different combinations of lags for the single-air basin 
analyses, and then used the results of that to guide the choice of lags for the combined analyses. 
Trying a wide variety of different lag structures and only using the one that gives the largest 
coefficient or the most statistically significant result has a flavor of “data snooping” and could 
lead to biased results. We have tried to mitigate that effect by only considering results for which 
the p-value is well under the standard 0.05, but there are not many such cases where even this 
mild criterion is satisfied. 
 For ozone, we were unable to find any significant result for the South Coast air basin, and only 
for San Francisco Bay when the humidity variable was excluded, and with a relatively mild p-
value (0.018). When the results are combined across all air basins, there is no effect of ozone on 
mortality. 
For PM2.5, there were several statistically significant results in South Coast but with negative 
coefficients, which does not make sense biologically and could be a model selection artifact. In 
San Francisco Bay, there were some statistically significant results with a positive coefficient, 
but only for models in which relative humidity was excluded. Given the inconsistent results and 
the relatively mild p-values associated with them, it seems likely that these results are a case of 
spurious statistical significance. When combined across all air basins, there is no statistically 
significant effect for PM2.5. 
To establish a direct comparison with the analyses of the NMMAPS dataset in Smith [9], the 
results of that paper have been re-derived using the exact same statistical method used in the 
present paper (in particular, the same meteorological variables). Consistent with the results of the 
present paper, none of the individual-city results for California using the NMMAPS dataset 
showed a statistically significant effect, nor did the combined result of all California cities. 
However, the present method of analysis still shows a statistically significant “national” effect 
for ozone when applied to the whole NMMAPS dataset, although smaller than that reported in 
Smith [9]. The fact that the national estimate is smaller using tmax, tmin and relative humidity as 
the meteorological variables could imply that these variables do a better job than the original 
NMMAPS variables (daily mean temperature and dewpoint) of capturing the confounding effect 
of ozone with meteorology. Moreover, Smith [9] noted spatial variation of the ozone-mortality 
coefficient across cities, possible explanatory variables being the percentage of residences with 
central air conditioning (high in California) and the use of public transportation (high use of 
public transportation could correspond to high exposure to ambient pollutants, but use of public 
transportation is generally low in California). Because of this spatial variation, Smith [9] 
questioned whether it made sense to compute a “national” estimate in the face of clear evidence 
that the effect is not, in fact, national in scope. The results of the present paper add to the 
previous results by confirming that California data for 2000-2012, most of which lies after the 
end of the NMMAPS data period, still does not show any statistically significant relationship 
between mortality and either ozone or PM2.5.  
The analyses of Section 3.3 extend these results by considering a still wider range of models and 
also assessing predictive power of the models in a cross-validation context. For most analyses, 
including the air pollution variable does not improve the predictive ability of the model. 
It is worth considering how these results related to other studies of ozone and especially PM2.5, 
especially those regarding long-term chronic effects. There is contradictory literature on chronic 
effects of air pollution on deaths for the entire US. Eight papers were cited in [28], references 4–
11 in their paper, saying, “Associations between long-term exposure to fine particulate air 
 pollution and mortality have been observed ... more recently, in cohort-based studies.... all 
support the view that relatively prompt and sustained health benefits are derived from improved 
air quality”. On the other hand, Enstrom [29], after citing papers supporting an association says, 
“Other cohort studies have also examined mortality associations with PM2.5 and other pollutants 
... with somewhat different findings.” Enstrom cites four papers that cast doubt on the claim. 
Enstrom has a particular interest in California and he extracted risk ratio summary data for all 
cause deaths for California from a number of papers [30]. See Table 9. The average risk ratio 
was 0.9979 with a standard error of 0.0126 for California.

Table 9. All Cause risk ratios for PM2.5 deaths in California [30]. 
Chay et al. [31] looked at a reduction in air pollution due to the Clean Air Act, focusing on total 
suspended particulates (TSPs). Counties out of compliance were given stricter air pollution 
reduction goals. This action by the EPA created a so called natural experiment [32]. The EPA 
selected counties that they judged needed to reduce air pollution levels. Air pollution levels were 
reduced in these counties, but there was no reduction in deaths after adjustments for covariates. 
They concluded “…regulatory status is associated with large reductions in TSPs pollution but 
has little association with reductions in either adult or elderly mortality.” Another paper [33] also 
found that a reduction in PM2.5 does not lead to a reduction in deaths. No association of PM2.5 
 with longevity in western US was claimed in [34]. Many others have found no association of 
chronic deaths with PM2.5 in California. See Table 9 and the references cited therein.  
Another analysis that tried to reconcile claims related to acute and long-term effects was Greven 
et al. [35]. They developed a Poisson regression model to estimate two regression coefficients, a 
“global” coefficient that measures the association between national trends in pollution and 
mortality, and a “local” coefficient, derived from space by time variation, that measures the 
association between location-specific trends in pollution and mortality adjusted by the national 
trends. In their results, they find strong statistically significant evidence for the global 
coefficient, but they acknowledge that this could be explained by a variety of confounding 
factors operating at a national level. In contrast, the local coefficient, being based on correlating 
spatial variations in mortality with corresponding spatial variations in PM2.5, is supposed to be 
largely free of confounding variables. However, they did not find statistical significance for the 
local regression coefficient. This result therefore raises the question of whether there is any 
association between long-term mortality and PM2.5 that cannot be attributed to confounding 
variables. An earlier analysis in [36] raised similar concerns. In summary, a number of papers 
that take covariates into account [31, 33, 35-37] lead to the conclusion that there is no association 
of air quality with deaths that could not be explained by confounding variables. 
Many authors have noted “geographic heterogeneity”, that the measured effect of air quality is 
not the same in different locations. There is overwhelming evidence for the existence of 
geographic heterogeneity [8, 30, 31, 33, 38]. Multiple authors [9, 34, 37, 40] have not found any 
association of air quality with acute deaths in California. Enstrom [29] found no association with 
chronic deaths in California. In the absence of an adequate explanation of why such geographical 
heterogeneity occurs, it is hard to make the case for a simple causal relationship between air 
quality and deaths. Indeed, Greven et al. [35] suggest that differences in locations (geographic 
heterogeneity) are most likely due to differences in covariates that are not connected with air 
pollution such as age distributions, income and smoking.  
Another recent paper by Milojevic et al. [41] effectively removes heart attacks and stroke as a 
possible etiology for acute air quality deaths. This paper uses a very large UK data set. They 
track heart attacks and strokes essentially to the hour, but they find no association of heart 
attacks with ozone or PM2.5. We also note that cardiovascular notations on a death certificate are 
not considered reliable, for example [42], which reports that about half of all heart attacks are 
missed and heart attacks are falsely diagnosed about 25% of time, hence our primary focus on 
all-cause (non-accidental) deaths. The cardiovascular diagnosis is largely a matter of 
convenience as the person filling out the certificate is required to put something down.  
In summary, although EPA publications such as [43] highlight the large number of papers 
supporting a harmful association between particle pollution and public health, in fact, the 
evidence is not so clear cut: we have highlighted numerous studies where variations in mortality 
could be better explained by covariates not related to air pollution, or by simple geographic 
 heterogeneity, without implying a causal association with air pollution. The present paper adds to 
that literature by showing that, even by applying a variety of different statistical methods, we 
were unable to find any association between daily mortality and either PM2.5 or ozone in what we 
believe to be the only public dataset based entirely on data since the 1997 revision of air 
pollution standards. Therefore, we conclude that the case for further revision of those standards 
is unproven at the present time.

Analogous to Figure 11, using the full meteorological model (including relative humidity), and a 
nonlinear model for the relationship between PM2.5 and mortality. 
 
  
 
 
 
Figure 13. Model hold out predictions for each year except 2000. “o” are the observed deaths and 
the red overlay are the model predictions. The models do not explain a lot of the variability and 
are essentially identical to one another.

Figure 15. Ozone. The time-series analysis was conducted to obtain an estimated relationship 
between the air quality variables and the response variables in each basin. The basin specific 
estimates were combined in a meta-analysis framework to obtain the pooled cumulative effect. 
The relationships between the response variables and ozone are plotted. The first-stage basin-
specific relationships are represented by the dashed lines. The pooled estimates with 95% 
confidence intervals are represented by the solid blue lines and shaded gray region, respectively.
