Abstract
Evidence‐based health care (EBHC), previously evidence‐based medicine (EBM), is considered by
many to have modernized health care and brought it from an authority‐based past to a more
rationalist, scientific grounding. But recent concerns and criticisms pose serious challenges and
urge us to look at the fundamentals of a changing EBHC.
In this paper, we present French philosopher Bruno Latour's vision on modernity as a framework
to discuss current changes in the discourse on EBHC/EBM. Drawing on Latour's work, we argue
that the early EBM movement had a strong modernist agenda with an aim to “purify” clinical
reality into a dichotomy of objective “evidence” from nature and subjective “preferences” from
human society and culture.
However, we argue that this shift has proved impossible to achieve in reality. Several recent
developments appear to point to a demise of purified evidence in the EBHC discourse and a
growing recognition—albeit implicit and undertheorized—that evidence in clinical decision making
is relentlessly situated and contextual. The unique, individual patient, not abstracted truths from
distant research studies, must be the starting point for clinical practice. It follows that the EBHC
community needs to reconsider the assumption that science should be abstracted from culture
and acknowledge that knowledge from human culture and nature both need translation and
interpretation. The implications for clinical reasoning are far reaching. We offer some preliminary
principles for conceptualizing EBHC as a “situated practice” rather than as a sequence of
research‐driven abstract decisions.

INTRODUCTION
The evidence‐based movement is over 25 years old and has profoundly
affected the way health care is practised. Originally known as evidence‐
based medicine (EBM) and now usually referred to as evidence‐based
health care (EBHC) to embrace all health care professions, the
movement has achieved much but also drawn criticism and concerns.
For instance, in 2014, a group of scholars questioned whether the
EBHC movement was “in crisis” as a result of a number of unintended
consequences of its earlier success1:
the evidence based ‘quality mark’ has been misappropriated
by vested interests; the volume of evidence, especially
clinical guidelines, has become unmanageable; statistically
significant benefits may be marginal in clinical practice;
inflexible rules and technology driven prompts may
produce care that is management driven rather than
patient centred; and evidence based guidelines often
map poorly to complex multimorbidity.
Many authors consider that the emergence of EBM/EBHC
(a movement that continues to evolve) marks the shift from the
traditional
“priestly
authority”
of
doctors
to
a
more
modern,
knowledge‐based—and hence rational and scientific—authority.2-4 As
such, EBM/EBHC deserves analysis within the wider context of
modernity in general. In this paper, we consider the discourse on

 EBM/EBHC and its future in the light of work by the French anthropol-
ogist and philosopher Bruno Latour, who analysed the emergence of
science and technology in late modernity in one of his classic books
We have never been modern.5 In the next section, we summarize
relevant ideas from this book and apply them to EBM/EBHC.
1.1

“We have never been modern”
The term “modernity” is generally used to describe a historic period in
European arts, politics, science, and the humanities that began in the
16th century with the rise of the new cosmology and experimental
science and extended to the 20th century. It conveys the idea of a
general progress towards the rejection of traditional and religious
explanations as envisioned by enlightenment philosophers as well as
early social theorists such as Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Auguste
Comte. Their work culminated in a broad range of related theories and
ideas still prevalent today. With modernity came increasing seculariza-
tion, rational thought and rejection of tradition along with the firm
belief that reality is based on empirically testable scientific laws.
Bruno Latour wrote several classic books on the practices and
nature of science that already inspired others to discuss relevant issues
of the evidence‐based movement, such as the standardization of
morals and patients6 and the implementation of innovations.7
In We have never been modern, Latour acknowledges many versions
of modernism, which is recognizable when society is engaged in 2 sepa-
rate practices: purification, which means to make a distinction between
nature (which has always been) and human culture (which is man made),
and translation/hybidrization, defined as efforts to combine elements of
nature and culture in “hybrids networks” (Figure 1).
Latour gives as an example of translation a debate on climate
change, in which translation efforts seek to align elements of both
nature
and
culture—specifically,
“[the]
chemistry
of
the
upper
atmosphere, scientific and industrial strategies, the preoccupations of
heads of state, [and] the anxieties of ecologists.”
Latour argues that modernists recognize that nature and culture
have interconnections, but they seek to make them analytically separa-
ble. In particular, say modernists, science should be politics free.
Modernists' assumption (what Latour calls “the modernist constitution”)
entails that nature is always objectively knowable and never man made
and human culture is always made up and never influenced by nature.
According to this view, we would be “modern” when and to the
extent that we could successfully separate nature and culture and
subject the former to rational scientific analysis. However, argues
Latour, despite the application of advanced scientific techniques and
technological apparatus, modern society is struggling and failing to
keep these 2 phenomena apart. Nature and culture remain inextricably
linked, just as they were in the premodern era.
To resolve this modernist problem, Latour does not argue for a
return to premodern obscurantism, ie, deliberately precluding full
understanding of anything. Instead, he introduces an alternative take
on reality, which he calls a “middle kingdom.” In this view, the world,
consisting of both nature and culture, is explained with reference to
“hybrids” or the so‐called “quasi‐objects.” He offers a number of
examples including soccer balls,8 frozen embryos, expert systems,
digital machines, sensor‐equipped robots, hybrid corn, data banks,
and psychotropic drugs.5 All of them are naturally real in the sense that
they obey physical laws, but are also culturally real in the sense that
they have cultural meaning and social significance. They are objects
and nonobjective concepts at the same time. According to Latour,
moderns deny quasi‐objects even though they depend on them. To
enter the middle kingdom means to acknowledge that nature and
culture can never be kept apart and that the modern project is equally
dependent on purification and translation.

Early EBM as a modernist movement
The emergence of EBM in the early 1990s can be understood as a
modernist movement. For instance, an article by the EBM Working
Group in JAMA in 1992 opens as follows:
A
new
paradigm
is
emerging. EBM
de‐emphasises
intuition,
unsystematic
clinical
experience,
and
pathophysiologic rationale as sufficient grounds for
clinical decision making and stresses the examination of
evidence from clinical research.9
In the above quote, real patients and conditions are understood
as hybrids of 2 pure forms: objective nature and subjective culture.
Clinical research is depicted as able to provide “facts” of biology
and epidemiology, as far as possible void of human intuition or
experience. Indeed, the programme of training that was to be offered
to the early students consisted (more or less) of a menu of tools,
techniques, and processes for separating objective (hence, trustwor-
thy) evidence from subjective (untrustworthy) opinions, biases, and
perspectives. Thus, EBM began with explicit aspirations to modern-
ism that still persevere today.10 For instance, in a paper on evaluating
e‐health interventions, the authors write:
[…] health information systems should be evaluated with
the same rigour as a new drug or treatment programme,
otherwise decisions about future deployments of ICT in
the
health
sector
may
be
determined
by
social,
economic, and/or political circumstances, rather than by
robust scientific evidence.11
Not all early protagonists of EBM rejected the value of clinical
expertise. Indeed, Sackett et al famously defined EBM as an approach
FIGURE 1
Purification and translation
WIERINGA ET AL.
965
 that integrates the best external evidence with individual clinical
expertise and patients' choice.12 But even this, more accommodating
definition remains essentially modernist. The fundamental issue here
is the concept of “the best external evidence.” Although Sackett et al
advise practitioners to “integrate” clinical expertise and patient choice
(which implies some kind of hybridization), they persist in conceptual-
izing evidence in the form of general truths that are external to the
messiness of the clinical encounter and arrived at through rational,
objective means (notably, randomized controlled trials [RCTs]).
Compare with Latour who writes:
The moderns […] did not make quasi‐objects disappear by
eradication and denial, as if they wanted to simply repress
them. On the contrary, they recognized their existence
but emptied it of any relevance […] The modern
explanations consisted in splitting the mixtures apart in
order to extract from them what came from the subject
(or the social) and what came from the object. Next
they multiplied the intermediaries in order to reconstruct
the unity they had broken and wanted none the less to
retrieve through blends of pure forms.
Thus, while Sackett and other early leaders of the EBM movement
celebrated clinical expertise and the patent voice, they nevertheless
insisted that evidence is developed in a secluded space outside the
clinical encounter and only then translated through integration with
expertise and preferences. In this way they reproduced the dichotomy
between science and translation typical of modernism.
By the late 1990s, critical social scientists were reflecting that
EBM had succeeded in producing
…[a] Cartesian epistemology of differentiation—a reality
of distinct subjects and objects—in which research
evidence and clinical practice are seen as dualistically
opposed.
Evidence,
in
this
context,
is
seen
as
a
commodity, whose better, quicker, easier to access, and
increasingly electronic transfer, from the research pole
to that of practice will lead to the more effective
clinical management of patients […]. Whilst the appeal
of this dualist model is its maintenance of stable
boundaries
and
firm
divisions:
objective/subjective,
research/practice, facts/values, such thinking is almost
always structured so as to privilege one side of the
dualism over the other. This has made possible the
hierarchical
distinction
between,
for
example,
the
objective
‘facts’
of
biomedical
research
and
the
subjective ‘mere knowledge’ of clinical practice. Here,
an analytic and disembodied (scientific) organisation of
knowledge is privileged over more tacit and situated
experiences: a body of evidence, separated from its
social context, that can be unilaterally transmitted
from the research setting—where it is known—to the
world of practice—where it is not.7
The 1990s and 2000s saw an exponential expansion in the kind of
research designated by the EBM community as “robust”—defined in
terms of the methods used to reduce or eliminate bias in the collection
and analysis of empirical data. The large RCT became the bread‐and‐
butter type of research and in its trail rapidly followed increasingly
sophisticated systematic reviews and meta‐analysis, instruments to
appraise clinical practice guideline development, frameworks to guide
and assess clinical care pathways, and the institutionalization of
implementation as a science.

The “movement in crisis”: EBM's receding
modernist vision
The original vision of the EBM movement was that within a genera-
tion, the evidence base for clinical decisions would have been
collected, collated, and distributed for easy access by clinicians and
policymakers.
This
knowledge
base—“best
evidence”—would
be
objectively verifiable and readily updated in real time as new research
evidence from robust study designs accumulated.
However, research evidence in many fields remains heavily
contested. The scientists, clinicians, and guideline developers involved
are usually EBM experts; they understand the rules for interpreting
clinical trials and screening programmes perfectly well. Yet they each
interpret the evidence differently. These disagreements between
experts often originate not from the data but from a difference in
values.13 Principles like confidentiality, equality, and preventing harm
affect how “facts” are understood. Reinterpretation of existing
evidence in national breast cancer screening programmes based on
mammography caused heavy debate about their effectiveness and
the risks of overdiagnosis.14 The discussion on the harms and benefits
of statins in low‐risk patients and the elderly is fierce and ongoing as
some trialists and systematic reviewers are accused of conflict of
interests.15 And the medical community was shocked when recom-
mendations for Tamiflu16 and paroxetine in adolescence17 were
reverted after previously unpublished research data were disclosed
and reinterpreted by others. Again and again, evidence‐based value‐
free “facts” turn out to be value laden (and for good reason).
In the light of these examples, the warning offered in 1997 by
Haridimos Tsoukas was remarkably prescient (although few in the
EBM movement heeded it at the time):
Contrary to how knowledge was viewed in pre‐modern
societies, knowledge now tends to be understood as
information,
that
is
as
consisting
of
objectified,
commodified, abstract, decontextualized representations.
The overabundance of information in late modernity
makes the information society full of temptations. It
tempts us into thinking that knowledge‐as‐information is
objective and exists independently of human beings;
that everything can be reduced into information; and
that generating ever more amounts of information will
increase the transparency of society and, thus, lead to
the rational management of social problems. However,
… the information society is riddled with paradoxes that
prevent it from satisfying the temptations it creates.
More information may lead to less understanding; more
information may undermine trust; and more information
may make society less rationally governable.18
966
WIERINGA ET AL.
 The original goals of EBM to provide a methodology to generate
independent truths and objectively assess the certainty of facts have
so far proved elusive. Society's influence pervades. Despite the
hopes and predictions of its forefathers, EBM has never become
modern.

EBHC in 2017—moving towards a “middle
kingdom?”
A number of recent developments suggest that the EBM/EBHC
movement is gradually recognizing its rigid adherence to modernism
while it tempts to get to grips with its stance towards nature on one
side and human society on the other.
1. The discourse on EBHC displays a greater degree of reflexivity
from within the community. Whereas the early protagonists of
EBM saw the movement as part of the inevitable march of
scientific progress, social scientists have always viewed EBM as
historically—and
politically—situated.
Judith
Greene,19
for
instance, notes that:
The EBHC movement has attracted critical comments
from sociologist and policy analysts from a number of
perspectives: that for instance, clinical epidemiology is
not always the most appropriate framework for decision
making
in
healthcare
[…]
and
that
EBM
can
be
deconstructed
as
a
discourse
which
functions
to
maintain the ‘purity’ of medical practice in the face of
threats to autonomy […]. [O]ne key problem within the
EBM movement lies in its assumption of rationalistic
behaviour and linear change: that evidence is stable and
independent of social relationships.
But now the EBHC community too appears to embrace these
criticisms as it tries to find solutions for the inability to fully be
modern. For example, to deal with vested interests, the ALLTrials
campaign20,21 calls for better registration of planned trials, summary
results reported within a year after the end of all trials, and publica-
tion of a full report including all harms. These may still be considered
modernist, purifying activities. But the practices of the initiative,
creating momentum, networking, lobbying, and beating the pharma-
ceutical industry at its game, are not. They make evidence‐based–
minded clinicians, researchers, and guideline developers more and
more aware that medical facts are not so objective as they seem.
They turn out to be constructed, situated within specific agendas
and alignments of key players in human society.
2. The EBM/EBHC no longer views the result of a sample mean in an
RCT as applicable unproblematically to the single case scenario.
There is a more sophisticated understanding of the translational
process from scientific evidence to a particular situation such as
a complex intervention at the organizational and system level or
an individual patient in a particular situation.
For example, inspired by the concepts of “shared decision
making”22
and
“person‐centred
care,”23
guideline
makers
are
supporting individualized clinical decisions by providing new tools in
new formats, as, for instance, the Magic app24 or Option grids.25
What is new about these instruments is that they do not just
prescribe what objective, purified nature says (does the drug
work?),
but
also
present
arguments
from
human
culture
(Do
patients value it? Is it affordable?). True, as they still separate
nature and human society in neat categories, they remain largely
modernist. But nature and society are put on a more equal footing
than ever before.
These developments are still somewhat removed from what it
takes to care for an actual patient. That would be what philosopher
Annemarie Mol calls a “logic of care”—a constant tinkering, while
avoiding neglect26 or a relationship‐based care—following the story
of the person in context, in the words of Schei27:
a relational competence, where empathic perceptiveness
and creativity render doctors capable of using their
personal qualities, together with the scientific and
technologic tools of medicine, to provide individualized
help attuned to the particular circumstances of the
patient.
But they do reveal a growing interest in the EBHC discourse to
start thinking from the standpoint of real patients in real encounters
as with Latours quasi‐objects.
3. There is an increasing interest in less purified kinds of knowledge,
research methods, and styles of reasoning.28
For example, works by Gigerenzer29 on heuristics and other
researchers on gut feelings30 provide evidence that decisions based
on not‐so‐explicit human reasoning and inferences do give good, and
sometimes even better, outcomes in reality. Ethnographic research
by Gabbay and Le May and observational research by Zwolsman
ea31,32 showed that in everyday practice, most clinical decisions
commonly rely on tacit, hard‐to‐explain knowledge, influenced by past
experiences, peers, and contexts. Pragmatic randomized trials have
been designed to test interventions in the actual context of where they
will be used.33 And guideline makers urge that in practice, good recom-
mendation requires more kinds of knowledge than just RCTs.34
These examples show an understanding that the products of
modernist practice of purification (resulting in explicit law like rules
of medicine) need to be watered down to become applicable “in
reality.” Latour writes:
We do not need to attach our explanations to the two
pure forms known as the Object or Subject/Society,
because these are, on the contrary, partial and purified
results of the central practice that is our sole concern.
The explanations we seek will indeed obtain Nature and
Society, but only as a final outcome, not as a beginning.5
Purified findings from well‐designed RCTs and reviews are
wonderful insights, but at the end of the day, they may prove useless
in the face of an actual patient, in the here and now.
WIERINGA ET AL.
967
 Of course, consultations themselves have always been about
translation and hybridization. In consultations, patients and health care
professionals swiftly connect molecules, plaques, platelets, cells,
average blood pressures, drugs, lifestyle, food, function, meaning,
values, sense, and care. What is new is the growing acknowledgement
in the discourse on EBHC that these are not clearly separable in
objective nature or subjective culture (as critical social scientists have
argued for decades).

DISCUSSION
In his book, Latour sought to eradicate the divide between science and
culture. His middle kingdom implies a fundamental questioning of the
modernist conception of science that extends beyond EBM.
While current initiatives in the EBHC movement may concede the
existence of a middle kingdom—that is, they accept that research
evidence cannot sit above history, culture, or politics but is recursively
linked1 to all 3—there remains an important paradox. As Latour argued
about science in general in We have never been modern, EBHC cannot
acknowledge this middle kingdom without ceasing to be modern and
collapsing back into premodernism.
This creates an ambivalence: On the one hand, EBHC (at least as it
has developed) depends on mediation, translation, or a “cultural sup-
plement.” On the other hand, it still relies on the purification of science
to be separate from, and more objective than, real‐world messiness.
The whole concept of “best evidence” hinges upon such a divide. If
not, it risks becoming “unscientific.” Inevitably, then, EBHC must move
towards a middle kingdom to deal with the paradoxes it has already
generated (such as the dominance of vested interests in the publica-
tion of large RCTs in mainstream academic journals). But EBHC can
never fully embrace this middle kingdom without effectively rejecting
the very concept of evidence on which its central claims are based.
Instead of resolving this paradox, the EBHC movement must coexist
with it and “muddle through.”
Latour argues that while modernity is built on a myth (the
separability of nature and culture), it nevertheless produces bene-
fits. Modernity generates the need for translation, hybridization,
and cultural/technological supplements, a need that follows from
the act of purification itself. The practice of purification also leads
very efficiently to many new insights (smoking leads to cancer),
concepts (statistical significance), and natural objects (DNA). All
these quasi‐objects would not have existed in a premodern society,
he argues. Indeed, it is hard to underestimate the impact EBHC
has had with its renewed methods of induction as means to purify
clinical reality into more or less stable rules and recommendations.
We contend that any new interpretation of EBHC should not
seek to refute the fundamental principles of clinical epidemiology or
the position of the RCT as the best study design for reducing bias
in human experiments. We are not arguing for a return to the priestly
authority of doctors, to anecdotal evidence, or to guideline develop-
ment by GOBSAT (“good old boys sat around a table”). Rather, we
suggest that a progressive, mature, “middle kingdom” EBHC would
reframe the concepts of “evidence” and “medicine/health care” in
EBM/EBHC in several different ways:
• The new EBHC should reflexively reject the science‐culture
dichotomy.
Especially
in
some
circumstances
(for
example,
where
different
stakeholder
groups
hold
widely
different
values and priorities; where vested interests loom large; or
where uncertainty is inherent35), “pure” evidence is unlikely
to be obtained by stripping away real‐world messiness or
imposing rigid or unworkable protocols. As Contandriopoulos
points out:
Collective knowledge exchange and use are phenomena
so
deeply
embeded
in
organizational,
policy,
and
institutional contexts that externally valid evidence
pertaining
to
the
efficacy
of
specific
knowledge
exchange strategies is unlikely to be forthcoming.36
Rather, a mature EBHC will seek to incorporate the messiness of
real‐world hybridization into a wider range of approaches and
methodologies. Concepts of a “gold standard” and a “hierarchy of
evidence”
become
highly
problematic
in
such
circumstances.
Randomized controlled trials require “supplements” to create better
inferences for a complex reality, be it pragmatic trials, pattern
recognition modelling, participatory codesign, or other approaches.
• The new EBHC recognizes that all evidence—whether derived
from science on the one hand or from human culture (patient
preferences, opinions, insights, etc) on the other—requires transla-
tion and interpretation. This is in contrast to a recent study where
researchers found that guideline panel members differentiated
between “objective evidence” from studies and “insights” from
patients. They write: “There is a tendency to try to weigh‐up the
patients' views against the clinical and economic data, which
proves difficult.”37 With Latour's framework, it becomes clear
why nature and society are hard to separate. If we accept the
legitimacy of the middle kingdom, we must accept that research
evidence cannot be placed on a pedestal apart from other
evidence in this way, as well as accepting that research evidence
will always be developed outside the relationship‐based care for
the patient and based on a logic, which is different from the
relational logic inherent in a clinical encounter.
The danger of the dominant discourse of rationality is
that
by
marginalising
and
devaluing
the
role
of
individual
judgement,
it
undermines
rather
than
strengthens actors' capacity to act.38
• The new EBHC acknowledges the need to reason not only from
the individual to the general or from the general to the
individual but from individual to individual (casuistry39). In the
old EBM, health care needs to be purified to find its (assumed
stable) laws of nature. For instance, people with hypertension
have a higher cardiovascular risk. We, the society of humans,
make mistakes against the absolute rules of nature, which are
typically referred to as “cognitive biases.” Instead, Latour urges
968
WIERINGA ET AL.
 us to reason from the original “quasi‐object/hybrid” that is the
patient
in
practice
in
clinical
context.
The
question
then
becomes as follows: Is this patient with hypertension one of
the group of patients that would form the “rule” (hypertension
causes
increased
cardiovascular
morbidity)?
It
is
a
small
difference, but crucial in EBHC: It forces clinicians to challenge
the rule with every patient they see, to ask if there actually is
a rule or an original new situation, and to recognize that the rule
found in a certain reference population (eg, incorporated into a
guideline) cannot remain a law forever. It will change as the
original/real patients in their contexts are changing. It is about
causality departing from a dynamic world context, not a stable
controlled laboratory environment.40
• The new EBHC recognizes its own limitations in relation to
decision support and inductive inference in health care.
Latour's framework unveils EBHC as just one of the activities
(practices) of everyday health care. It is the practice of purification in
that realm: making inferences to produce new insights and good
decisions.
But as a result of the focus on purification practices of early EBM,
the purpose of health care itself became skewed towards aiming for
objective evidence from nature at the expense of care and equity.
The concept of health care as caring, loving, and nurturing has largely
been lost in the process.41
This was not intended. For Archie Cochrane, who the early EBM
proponents often cited in support of their view, health care had 2
equality important dimensions:
I see the NHS, rather crudely, as supplying on the one hand
therapy, and on the other board and lodging and tender,
loving, care.42
Purification and hybridization have their place, but not predomi-
nantly. Health care is about making good inferences (which is the role
of EBHC), about equity, and about relationship‐based, loving care.
Paraphrasing Latour, health care should once again be reinstated as
broad concept that has both “science and society as its satellites.”

FINAL REMARKS
In this paper, we aimed to provide an understanding of the current
position changes and the future of the evidence‐based movement by
introducing Latour's views on modernity as a framework for discus-
sion. An ongoing dialogue within the movement is needed about the
role, the paradox, and benefits and harms of the modernist practice
of purification. With Wood, we would argue for more interdisciplinary
practices: “innovation is neither natural or inevitable, but constantly
negotiated and aligned—a path forged within an assemblage of
scientific and organisational and behavioural factors.”7 Rather than a
sequence of research‐driven abstract decisions, EBHC should be
conceptualized as a situated practice, always starting from the real
problems of individual real patients (and real organizations and
systems) in their real contexts.
