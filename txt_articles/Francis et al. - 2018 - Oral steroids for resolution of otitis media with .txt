Summary
Background Children with persistent hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion are commonly managed by 
surgical intervention. A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment would enhance treatment options. Underpowered, 
poor-quality trials have found short-term benefit from oral steroids. We aimed to investigate whether a short course of 
oral steroids would achieve acceptable hearing in children with persistent otitis media with effusion and hearing loss. 
Methods In this individually randomised, parallel, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial we recruited children aged 
2–8 years with symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months and with confirmed bilateral 
hearing loss. Participants were recruited from 20 ear, nose, and throat (ENT), paediatric audiology, and audiovestibular 
medicine outpatient departments in England and Wales. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to sequentially 
numbered identical prednisolone (oral steroid) or placebo packs by use of computer-generated random permuted 
block sizes stratified by site and child’s age. The primary outcome was audiometry-confirmed acceptable hearing 
at 5 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number 
ISRCTN49798431.
Findings Between March 20, 2014, and April 5, 2016, 1018 children were screened, of whom 389 were randomised. 
200 were assigned to receive oral steroids and 189 to receive placebo. Hearing at 5 weeks was assessed in 183 children 
in the oral steroid group and in 180 in the placebo group. Acceptable hearing was observed in 73 (40%) children in the 
oral steroid group and in 59 (33%) in the placebo group (absolute difference 7% [95% CI –3 to 17], number needed to 
treat 14; adjusted odds ratio 1·36 [95% CI 0·88–2·11]; p=0·16). There was no evidence of any significant differences 
in adverse events or quality-of-life measures between the groups.
Interpretation Otitis media with effusion in children with documented hearing loss and attributable symptoms for at 
least 3 months has a high rate of spontaneous resolution. A short course of oral prednisolone is not an effective 
treatment for most children aged 2–8 years with persistent otitis media with effusion, but is well tolerated. One in 
14 children might achieve improved hearing but not quality of life. Discussions about watchful waiting and other 
interventions will be supported by this evidence.

Introduction
Otitis media with effusion is estimated to affect 50–80% 
of children by the age of 5 years and costs the National 
Health Service (NHS) up to £90 million per year.1 
Antibiotics, topical intranasal steroids, decongestants, 
antihistamines, and mucolytics are ineffective treatments 
for this condition.2–4 Intervention options are largely 
limited to watchful waiting, hearing aids, or surgical 
insertion of ventilation tubes through the tympanic 
membrane (with or without adenoidectomy or tonsill­
ectomy). Use of an autoinflation device resulted in a 
modest benefit for some children aged 4–11 years.5 
However, 80% of children are affected by otitis media 
with effusion before the age of 4 years, a time when 
language development is most rapid, hearing loss has 
its greatest effect on language development, and when 
children are generally unable to use an autoinflation 
device.6 Hearing aids are an effective treatment, but 
children often find them uncomfortable, might feel self­
conscious, and can become a target for bullying.7 Both 
hearing aids and surgery require referral to secondary 
care, with major cost implications.8 A safe, cheap, and 
effective medical treatment, especially if implementable 
in primary care, would enhance treatment options. 
Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for 
otitis media with effusion found a significant benefit 
with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus with antibiotics 
alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit 
for oral steroids versus control.3 Studies were generally 
small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to

assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome 
was underpowered and included otitis media with 
effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation).9 
A subsequent trial found that both oral steroids alone 
and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved 
otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 
6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.10 
The American Academy of Otolaryngology­Head and 
Neck Surgery Foundation and the American Academy 
of Pediatrics, informed by the generally underpowered 
studies in our review, have recommended against oral 
steroids for otitis media with effusion.11 Despite this 
recommendation, adults diagnosed with otitis media 
with effusion are more likely to be prescribed oral 
steroids than those with other diagnoses.12 
We therefore aimed to establish the clinical and cost­
effectiveness of a short course of oral prednisolone 
(steroid) on hearing over a short­term period in children 
with bilateral otitis media with effusion. 
Methods
Study design and participants 
OSTRICH was a double­blinded, individually random­
ised, parallel­arm, superiority, placebo­controlled trial. 
Children were screened and followed up at 20 ear, nose, 
and throat (ENT) outpatient or paediatric audiology 
and audiovestibular medicine (AVM) clinics in England 
and Wales. The methods have been described in the 
published protocol and are summarised here.13 Sites 
were selected on the basis of their recruitment potential 
and membership of clinical research networks. Each 
child had an audiometry assessment and a clinical 
assess 
ment before assessment for eligibility. Eligible 
children were those aged 2–8 years with symptoms of 
hearing loss attributable to otitis media with effusion for 
at least 3 months (or with audiometry­proven hearing 
loss for at least 3 months); diagnosed with bilateral otitis 
media with effusion in an ENT or paediatric audiology 
and AVM clinic on the day of recruitment or during the 
preceding week; with audiometry confirming hearing 
loss of more than 20 decibels hearing level (dB HL) 
averaged within the frequencies of 0·5 KHz, 1 KHz, 
2 KHz, and 4 KHz in both ears by pure tone audiometry 
ear­specific insert, visual reinforcement audiometry 
(VRA), or ear­specific play audiometry, or hearing loss 
of more than 25 dB HL averaged within the frequencies 
of 0·5 KHz, 1 KHz, 2 KHz, and 4 KHz by soundfield 
Research in context
Evidence before this study 
Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media 
with effusion, updated in 2011, found a significant benefit with 
oral steroids plus antibiotics versus control with antibiotics 
alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for 
oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor 
quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral 
steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and 
included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks 
after presentation). We searched PubMed on Jan 22, 2018, and 
identified an additional trial showing that both oral steroids 
alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved 
otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 
6 weeks, but that this advantage disappeared by 3 months.
Added value of this study 
This study is, to our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled 
trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in children with otitis 
media with effusion, in whom hearing loss was documented 
at study entry and was the primary outcome. We achieved 
good long-term follow-up and found weak evidence of a 
small benefit in achieving acceptable hearing but no effect 
on quality-of-life measures from a short course of oral 
prednisolone in children with persistent otitis media with 
effusion. In children with documented hearing loss and 
symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at 
least 3 months, the rate of spontaneous resolution is high. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Discussions about watchful waiting and other interventions will 
be supported by this evidence of the effectiveness and clinical 
course of oral steroids. We do not recommend routine use of a 
short course of oral steroids for treatment of hearing loss in 
children with otitis media with effusion.

VRA or soundfield performance/play audiometry in the 
better­hearing ear, on the day of recruitment or within the 
preceding 14 days, and with a parent or carer providing 
informed consent. Exclusions included congenital and 
genetic disorders and major comorbidities, and are listed 
in the protocol13 and in the appendix. Changes made to 
the methods are detailed in the appendix. Parents of 
recruited children provided their informed consent to 
participate.
Ethical approval was obtained from an NHS research 
ethics committee, recognised by the UK Ethics Committee 
Authority (UKECA), the National Research Ethics Service 
Research Ethics Committee for Wales on Feb 28, 2013 
(reference number 13/WA/0004). The trial protocol was 
reviewed and approved by the Wales Research Ethics 
Committee 3, recognised by the UKECA. All hospital 
sites received research and development approval from 
the respective NHS Health Boards and Trusts in England 
and Wales. Clinical trial authorisation was obtained from 
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency (MHRA). The trial was overseen by independent 
trial steering and data monitoring committees.
Randomisation and masking 
Sequential pack numbers were randomly assigned (1:1) 
to the oral steroid or placebo groups by use of computer­
generated random permuted block sizes stratified by site 
and child’s age group (2–5 years vs 6–8 years). Recruited 
children were allocated the next sequentially numbered 
trial pack at each site pharmacy. Children, parents 
and legal guardians, clinical staff, and the trial team 
(including the statistician) were all masked to treatment 
allocation. A masked randomisation list was generated 
by the trial statistician. The codes were then allocated to 
oral steroid and placebo by an independent statistician 
who liaised with the pharmaceutical unit for labelling 
and distribution. 
Procedures
The intervention was a 7­day course of soluble 
prednisolone, given as a single daily dose by mouth of 
20 mg for children aged 2–5 years or 30 mg for children 
aged 6–8 years, or placebo matched for packaging, colour, 
solubility, and consistency (Piramal Healthcare, Morpeth, 
UK). This is the most commonly used dose in previous 
studies of otitis media with effusion, and similar to the 
standard dose for treatment of other inflammatory 
conditions, such as asthma. Procedures for emergency 
unblinding were in place but there were no instances of 
unblinding.
The schedule for timing, frequency, and method of 
collection of all trial data is summarised in table 1. 
Medical history, audiometry, tympanometry, and otos 
copy 
findings were recorded at baseline, and the parent or legal 
guardian was asked to complete the Otitis Media 
(OM8­30) questionnaire to assess the child’s functional 
health status as an overall score and by three facets: 
infection­related physical health, general developmental 
impact, and reported hearing difficulties (with a low 
[more negative] score indicating better quality of 
life).14 The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)

functioning, and psychosocial health summary score.15 
Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating 
better quality of life. Children aged 8 years were invited to 
complete the child self­report version of PedsQL if the 
research nurse assessed them as having the cognitive 
ability to do so. The Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) 
measured health utilities and comprises a family of 
multi­attribute preference­based utility measures, with 
scores ranging from –0·36 to 1·00 (where higher scores 
indicate better health­related quality of life).16 Children 
were randomly assigned after completion of baseline 
assessments. 
Parents or legal guardians were provided with a 
symptom diary to complete at home during the first 
5 weeks. The diary was used to record daily treatment 
adherence (all, some, or no medication taken) for the first 
week, as well as symptoms and adverse events, alongside 
resource use for the economic analyses. Parents scored 
each of the ten symptoms weekly on a scale from 0 
(problem not present at all) to 6 (problem is as bad as it 
could be). Follow­up assessments were done at week 5 
(4 weeks after completion of treatment), and at 6 months 
and 12 months after randomisation, when completion of 
the validated questionnaires and the audiometry, tymp­
anometry, and otoscopy were repeated as well as questions 
about resource use. Participants were asked to not have 
ventilation tube surgery during the first 5 weeks of follow­
up, but then resumed usual care. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was acceptable hearing at 5 weeks 
from randomisation (4 weeks after conclusion of treat­
ment), defined as less than or equal to 20 dB HL averaged 
within the frequencies of 0·5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 
4 kHz in at least one ear in children assessed by pure 
tone audiometry, ear­specific insert VRA, or ear­specific 
play audiometry, and less than or equal to 25 dB HL 
averaged within the frequencies of 0·5 kHz, 1 kHz, 
2 kHz, and 4 KHz in children assessed by soundfield 
VRA or soundfield performance/play audio 
metry. Hear­
ing loss associated with otitis media with effusion 
averages 18–35 dB HL, and the thresholds we used are 
based on national guidelines.17,18 We selected a short­term 
primary outcome as we considered that this would be the 
point at which oral steroids would be most likely to be 
effective, and that short­term benefit (even if only 
temporary in some children) would be worthwhile from 
a relatively safe, cheap, and easy to implement inter­
vention. Demonstrable short­term improvement in 
hearing is arguably more important than longer­term 
outcomes, as short­term improvement is most likely to 
influence the decision to undergo surgery for insertion 
of ventilation tubes. 
Secondary outcomes assessed the effects of the inter­
vention on acceptable hearing (defined through audio­
metry) at 6 months and 12 months; tympanometric

relating to otitis media with effusion and other resource

assessed at 5 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months; insertion 
of ventilation tubes by 6 months and 12 months; and 
adverse events and symptoms (as reported by parent and 
child if appropriate) reported during the 5 weeks from 
randomisation.
Statistical analysis
We required a sample size of 302 to show a change in the 
proportion of children with resolved hearing loss at 
5 weeks after randomisation from 20% in the placebo 
group to 35% in the oral steroid group, with 80% power 
at a 5% significance level. We selected a conservative 
effect size of 1·75 (ratio of proportions) as we considered 
that a 15% absolute increase in the rate of resolution at 
5 weeks would represent a clinically meaningful benefit 
that could result in a meaningful reduction in insertion 
of ventilation tubes. Our sample size was increased 
to 380, to allow for a 20% loss to follow­up at 12 months. 
All analyses were by intention to treat without 
imputation for those lost to follow­up, with outcomes 
compared between the oral steroid and control groups 
by use of mixed­effects two­level regression models to 
adjust for trial site (random­effects) and the age of the 
child at recruitment (2–5 years vs 6–8 years; fixed­effects) 
as stratification variables. All parameter estimates are 
presented alongside 95% CIs and p values. 
The primary analysis used a logistic regression model 
with comparisons presented as the absolute difference in 
proportions and adjusted odds ratios (aOR). The model 
was also adjusted for days from randomisation to 5­week 
follow up. For comparison with other studies, the adjusted 
relative risk and 95% CI were also presented by use of a 
generalised linear model with log­link function. Sensitivity 
analyses were done in the per­protocol population and 
with allocation respecting methods such as complier 
averaged causal effects (CACE) modelling to investigate 
the effect of adherence to treatment by use of instru­
mental variable regression.20,21 The per­protocol population 
comprised those who were randomly assigned and 
satisfied the study eligibility criteria, received and adhered 
to their allocated intervention for the 7­day course, and 
did not receive any surgery for grommets 5 weeks 
from randomisation. Children who presented more than 
14 days before or after the scheduled 5­week visit date were 
considered not to have complied with the trial protocol 
and were excluded from the per­protocol population. 
Diaries were used to assess adherence to the medication; 
adherence to oral steroid or placebo was defined as 
reporting taking all 7 days of oral steroid (partial adherence 
was defined as <7 days and reporting taking some or none

were entered into the model to do prespecified exploratory 
subgroup analyses (appendix). Secondary analyses of the 
primary outcome used weighted average dB HL (to 
account for the number of frequencies recorded) at the 
5­week follow­up as a continuous outcome. As 327 (90%) 
of 363 children had their ears tested at all four frequencies, 
weighted results were similar to the unweighted and so 
the unweighted results were dropped from the analysis. 
This outcome was modelled as a child­level analysis to 
explore the average, best, or worst hearing levels from 
children assessed via pure tone audiometry, ear­specific 
insert VRA, or ear­specific play audiometry, and also as an 
ear­level analysis to account for both ears being tested with 
the ear­specific VRA. Both approaches used multilevel 
linear regression modelling (child nested within site, and 
ears nested within child nested within site) adjusting for 
baseline dB HL, child’s age at recruitment, and time of the 
5­week follow­up (days). 
Methods for analysing secondary outcomes are 
presented in the protocol13 and are summarised in the 
appendix. 
A detailed statistical analysis plan was developed and 
signed off before the study trial database was locked 
and any data were examined. No interim analyses were 
done. Data analysis was done in IBM SPSS Statistics 
(version 20.0) and STATA (version 13.1).
The cost­effectiveness analysis was done from the 
perspective of the NHS and UK Personal Social Services. 
Detailed methods are presented in the protocol13 and in 
the appendix. 
Role of the funding source 
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data inter 
pretation, writing of 
the manuscript, or the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. RC­J and KH had access to the data. All 
authors were responsible for the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication.
Results 
Between March 20, 2014, and April 5, 2016, 1018 children 
were assessed for eligibility and 389 (38%) children from 
20 sites were randomly assigned (figure). The main 
reason for exclusion was hearing loss that did not meet 
inclusion criteria (appendix). After randomisation, a 
further nine children were excluded, with none of their 
data being used (six because their baseline audiometry 
data indicated that they did not have sufficient hearing 
loss to meet the eligibility criteria, and three who 
withdrew from the trial and withdrew consent to use any 
data). Therefore, 380 children (193 [51%] in the oral 
steroid group and 187 [49%] in the placebo group) were 
included in the analyses. There was a slight imbalance of 
children randomly assigned to each group resulting from 
the splitting of allocation blocks because of medication 
packs being withdrawn and destroyed as a result of 
temperature excursions and reaching their expiry dates. 
This issue affected the balance within some sites 
and in the older age group (6–8 years). The baseline 
demo 
graphics and medical and family history of the 
randomised groups were well balanced (table 2). Hearing 
was slightly better in the oral steroid group, with most 
children having mild to moderate hearing loss. Otoscopy 
and tympanometry were done in almost all children, the 
majority with type B. The tympanic membrane was

visualised in most ears and suggested the presence of 
middle ear effusion. Around 11% of children had bubbles 
behind the ear drum. 349 (92%) of diaries were returned 
(179 [93%] in the oral steroid group and 170 [90%] in the 
placebo group). Parents of 138 (77%) children in the oral 
steroid group and 134 (79%) in the placebo group reported 
full adherence to the study medication for all 7 days. 
Acceptable hearing at 5 weeks was observed in 73 (40%) 
children randomly assigned to oral steroid and in 
59 (33%) assigned to placebo, resulting in a small, non­
significant between­group difference (absolute difference 
7% [95% CI –3 to 17]; table 3). The aOR was 1·36 (95% CI 
0·88 to 2·11; p=0·16) and number needed to treat to 
benefit (NNTB) was 14·1 (95% CI number needed to treat 
to harm [NNTH] 35·7 to ∞ to NNTB 6·0). Similar results 
were shown in both the per­protocol population and when 
adjusting for adherence (table 3). For the child­level 
analysis, both treatment groups showed a similar 
decrease over the 5 weeks with no evidence of a difference 
between groups (<1 dB HL between­group difference), 
regardless of which assess 
ment of both ears was taken 
(average, best, or worse ear; only average shown in 
table 3). Analyses for individual ears (adjusted for 
correlation between ears within each child) showed 
similar results to the primary per­child analyses. Several 
effect modifiers were pre 
specified for subgroup analyses 
but treatment effects did not differ between subgroups, 
with the exception of antibiotics received for ear problems 
in the past month (p=0·0378; appendix). Although few 
children had received antibiotics (17 on oral steroids vs 13 
on placebo), the aOR in children who had received 
antibiotics was 11·80 (95% CI 1·18 to 117·8) compared 
with 1·17 (0·74 to 1·85) for children who had not (p=0·038 
for comparison betwen two treatment effects).
Secondary outcomes are presented in table 4 and in the 
appendix. There was a significant increase in acceptable 
hearing from 5 weeks to 6 months and 12 months 
(p=0·0001), with a constant albeit non­significant 
difference of 7–8% in favour of oral steroid (table 4). 
Although the rate of tympanometry resolution did not 
differ significantly over time or between groups (oral 
steroids vs placebo averaged across all three follow­up 
timepoints), the treatment groups had a different 
resolution trajectory over time (in the oral steroid group 
the rate of resolution increased over time whereas in the 
placebo group it decreased after 6 months). There was no 
treatment effect in the proportion of children with 
otoscopic evidence of a tympanic membrane perforation 
present in at least one ear, evidence of a middle ear 
effusion, or bubbles behind the ear drum (table 4). 
39 (23%) of 173 children in the oral steroid group and 
38 (22%) of 170 in the placebo group had ventilation tubes 
inserted between 5 weeks and 6 months, as did an 
additional 23 in each group between 6 months and 
12 months (table 4). There was no evidence of an effect on 
ventilation tube insertion rates from oral steroids. The 
mean time to insertion of ventilation tubes was 168·0 days 
(SD 96·1) in the oral steroid group and 165·5 days (104·5) 
in the placebo group, with no difference between groups 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1·04 [95% CI 0·71–1·53], p=0·84). 
The overall OM8­30 score decreased significantly over 
time as did the three facets; there were no discernible 
differences in trends over time by treatment group 
(table 4). All PedsQL domains scored highly and in 
creased 
over time with a negatively skewed distribution and a high 
proportion of parents reporting improved quality of life for 
their children. For all PedsQL outcomes, there were no 
significant differences between groups or over time. 
Distribution of the HUI3 score was negatively skewed, 
with a high proportion of parents reporting high quality of 
life for their children. As no improvement was seen in 
model fit by use of transformation, the score was recoded 
as a binary variable based on the maximum score of 1 
(perfect health) versus scores less than 1 (non­perfect 
health). The proportion of children reporting being healthy 
increased significantly over time, but with no evidence of a 
difference between treatment groups and no discernible 
difference between treatment groups over time.
41 (12%) of 349 children attended a consultation in any 
health­care setting during the 5 weeks after randomisation, 
with no difference between groups (appendix). Similar 
conclusions were made for time taken off school or 
nursery or days off work for family members for ear 
problems and other illnesses. The weekly overall symptom

potential adverse events (table 5). The proportion re­
porting adverse effects decreased during the follow­up 
period, with no significant difference between groups 
(appendix). 
The costs of health­care service use at 5 weeks and then 
over 12 months for the placebo and oral steroid groups 
are reported in table 6. Overall, no significant differences 
in resource use or costs were found for any of the 
categories of health service usage between the oral steroid 
and placebo groups. The non­significant relative increase 
of 7% in acceptable hearing at 5 weeks was associated 
with an incremental cost increase of £39 (95% CI 6 to 71). 
The cost per additional hearing resolution achieved was 
£546. The 12­month increase in acceptable hearing 
resolution observed in the steroid group was 5·8% with 
an incremental increase in costs of £177 (95% CI –132 to 
487). The 12­month incremental cost­effectiveness ratio 
was £3052 per additional hearing resolution. 
The cost­utility analysis (incremental cost per quality­
adjusted life­year [QALY] gain [based on HUI13] at 
12 months) found evidence for oral steroids being 
dominated (ie, being less effective and more costly) by

placebo (appendix). The probability of oral steroids being 
cost­effective compared with placebo was 17% at a £20 000 
per QALY threshold and 22% at a £30 000 per QALY 
threshold. Sensitivity analyses showed that in 
cremental 
costs and effects were highly sensitive to methods, 
although the results remained consistent when individual 
parameters for cost and outcomes were varied. 
Discussion 
This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 
placebo­controlled trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in 
children with otitis media with effusion, in whom 
hearing loss was documented at study entry and was the 
primary outcome, with long­term follow­up achieved. We 
found high rates of acceptable hearing at 5 weeks, 
6 months, and 1 year in children with initial documented 
hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion in 
secondary care clinics and with symptoms attributable to 
otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months. If 
effective, a short course of oral steroids for otitis media 
with effusion would have been appealing as the treatment 
is generally well tolerated and would avoid more 
burdensome and expensive inter 
ventions such as 
ventilation tubes or hearing aids. Although we found an 
absolute increase of 7% in the proportion of children 
with acceptable hearing at 5 weeks after randomisation 
in the oral steroid group, an increase that was maintained 
at 6 months and 12 months, these differences were not 
significant. We found no significant differences in 
functional health status and quality­of­life measures. A 
short course of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion 
is unlikely to be effective for most children aged 
2–8 years, although steroid treatment was well tolerated 
and one in 14 children might receive some benefit in 
achieving acceptable hearing. However, we did not 
identify any subgroup that showed meaningful advantage 
from steroid treatment. We also did not find any 
differences in functional health status and quality­of­life 
measures between study groups. Our evidence does not 
support a 1­week course of oral steroids as a cost­effective 
option for children aged 2–8 years with otitis media with 
effusion, but there is considerable uncertainty in our 
cost­effectiveness estimates.
We recruited within our target sample size and achieved 
close to 90% follow­up over 12 months, including hearing 
and functional health status and quality­of­life assess­
ments. We recruited children from 20 routine secondary 
care clinics across a wide geo 
graphical area, social depri­
vation, and age categories, which facilitate judgments 
about applicability. The study groups were well balanced 
for children’s characteristics. A high proportion of children 
adhered fully to the study interventions. More children 
than we anticipated recovered spontaneously, raising the 
possibility that we might not have had sufficient power 
to detect a real (but smaller than anticipated) difference 
in our primary outcome. However, although we did 
find differences in tympanometry findings at 5 weeks, 
we found no differences in functional health status and 
quality­of­life measures at any time 
point, suggesting that 
even with a larger sample size the difference in hearing 
outcomes would not have translated into meaningful

advantages on these measures. A large proportion of 
participants (68% in the steroid group and 61% in the 
placebo group) reported having symptoms attributable to 
otitis media with effusion for 12 months or more. Although 
these are only self­reported data, and the duration of actual 
effusions might have been substantially shorter, it is 
possible that we included a large proportion of children 
with more prolonged otitis media with effusion and 
viscous middle ear fluid. However, our subgroup analysis 
did not find a significant differential treatment effect by 
duration of symptoms and the point estimates suggested 
reduced benefit for those with a shorter duration of 
symptoms (<12 months).
The most recent update of the Cochrane review on oral or 
topical steroids for treatment of otitis media with effusion 
found no benefit from intranasal steroids.3 However, the 
review did identify evidence of a significant benefit from 
oral steroids plus antibiotics versus anti 
biotics alone for 
otitis media with effusion (five studies, 409 participants, 
risk ratio 1·99 [95% CI 1·14–3·49] for persistent otitis 
media with effusion at follow­up), and a non­significant 
point estimate suggesting benefit from oral steroids versus 
placebo in the short term (three studies, 108 participants, 
risk ratio 3·80 [95% CI 0·93–15·52]). Oral antibiotics 
alone were not effective. 
Studies included in the systematic review were limited 
by short­term follow­up, low power, poorly described 
inclusion criteria or no assessment of hearing at the time 
of inclusion (or both), use of ears rather than children as 
the unit of analysis, and use of intermediate outcome 
measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than 
improved hearing. No previous cost­effectiveness studies 
of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion were found. 
A non­placebo­controlled trial published subsequent to 
the Cochrane review found that oral steroids, and oral 
steroids followed by intranasal steroids, resolved otitis 
media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 
6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.10
Our study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous trial 
of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion in children. 
We included more patients than the combined total 
number of participants included in previous studies of 
oral steroid versus placebo in the Cochrane review; we 
confirmed hearing loss at study entry; and we included 
hearing, tympanometric, and quality­of­life assessments 
at follow­up. A systematic review and meta­analysis found 
that ventilation tubes improved hearing and time with 
otitis media with effusion, but did not improve speech, 
language, and other functional outcomes compared with 
watchful waiting or myringotomy, and that tubes 
increased the rate of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis.22 
An overview of studies found that the rate of spontaneous 
resolution of otitis media with effusion diagnosed by 
tympanometry of unknown duration was 28% (95% CI 
14–41) by 3 months, rising to 42% (35–49) by 6 months.23 
We found higher rates of resolution (acceptable hearing 
was observed in 40% of children in the oral steroid group 
and in 33% in the placebo group at 5 weeks) of actual 
hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion. 
Otitis media with effusion causes substantial problems 
for patients and their families, and results in considerable 
costs to the NHS. It continues to be the most common 
reason for childhood surgery despite reported reductions 
in the number of ventilation operations.8 The McKinsey 
report commissioned by the Department of Health states 
that the NHS could save £21 million per year by reducing 
insertion of ventilation tubes by a further 90%, a procedure 
that they assessed as being “relatively ineffective”.8 The UK 
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline 
published in 2008 for management of otitis media with 
effusion recommends a “watchful waiting” period of 
3 months, with referral to an ENT department if hearing is 
significantly affected, if the condition persists for longer 
than 3 months, or if there is suspected language or 
developmental delay.24 US guidelines also recommend 
watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion 
onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis.11 
Oral steroids might be a reasonable candidate intervention 
to help reduce the burden of otitis media with effusion. 
However, our findings suggest that any hearing­related 
benefit from oral steroids is likely to occur in one in 
14 children (aged 2–8 years) with otitis media with effusion, 
and that this benefit might be of questionable clinical 
significance, since we found no evidence of a beneficial 
effect on functional health status and health­related quality 
of life. Therefore, based on these findings we do not 
recommend routine use of oral steroids in this setting.
The high rate of spontaneous resolution identified in 
this study will support the evidence base informing 
discussions about watchful waiting in children with 
hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion. 
Given the findings of some benefit from antibiotics for 
otitis media with effusion in children, and limited trial 
evidence for a benefit from oral steroids in combination 
with antibiotics, a rigorous trial of oral steroids combined 
with antibiotics might be indicated.25
