ophthalmic gel 0.38% for the treatment of
inflammation and pain after cataract surgery
Raymond Fong, MD, Bruce E. Silverstein, MD, James H. Peace, MD, Jon I. Williams, PhD, Jason L. Vittitow, PhD
Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of a 0.38% submicron
formulation of loteprednol etabonate (LE) gel for the treatment of
postoperative inflammation and pain after cataract surgery.
Setting: Forty-five United States ophthalmology practices.
Design: Double-masked vehicle-controlled randomized parallel
group study.
Methods: Patients 18 years of age or older with anterior chamber
cells grade 2 or higher on day 1 after uncomplicated cataract sur-
gery were randomized to 14 days of treatment with LE gel 2 times
a day, LE gel 3 times a day, or vehicle. Hierarchical primary end-
points were the proportion of patients with resolution of anterior
chamber cells and grade 0 (no) pain at postoperative day 8. Safety
outcomes included adverse events, intraocular pressure (IOP), bio-
microscopy, visual acuity, ophthalmoscopy, and tolerability (drop
comfort and ocular symptoms).
Results: The intent-to-treat population included 514 patients.
Significantly more patients in the LE gel 2 times a day and 3
times a day groups compared with the vehicle group had
complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (26.9% and
28.7% versus 9.3%) and reported grade 0 pain (73.7% and
73.1% versus 47.7%) on day 8 (P < .001 vs vehicle for all).
The
safety
findings
were
unremarkable,
with
1
patient
experiencing an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or higher while on
LE gel. More than 75% of patients in each group reported no
drop discomfort.
Conclusion: In this study, submicron loteprednol etabonate gel
0.38% appeared safe and effective in the treatment of postopera-
tive inflammation and pain whether instilled 2 times or 3 times a day.

O
cular inflammation is common after cataract sur-
gery and when untreated, it could result in compli-
cations such as pain, photophobia, corneal edema,
cystoid macular edema, posterior capsule opacification,
and increased intraocular pressure (IOP).1,2 Topical corti-
costeroids are widely used to reduce inflammation and
pain after cataract surgery.1 However, potential side effects
of topical corticosteroid therapy include elevated IOP,
increased susceptibility to infection, and decreased wound
healing.3–5 Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is a corticosteroid
retrometabolically designed from prednisolone with a
unique C-20 ester group replacing the position C-20 ketone
group present in other glucocorticoids. Because of this
modification, after exerting its affect at the glucocorticoid
receptor, LE undergoes rapid deesterification by ubiquitous
esterases to 2 inactive metabolites.6 The antiinflammatory
activity of LE and its reduced potential for side effects
compared with other topical glucocorticoids were the focus
of a recent review.7
Loteprednol etabonate was first developed as an
ophthalmic suspension, with clinical studies demon-
strating its safety and efficacy for the management of
postoperative ocular inflammation as well as for inflam-
mation associated with a number of other medical condi-
tions, including seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, anterior
uveitis, dry eye, and giant papillary conjunctivitis.7
Compared with prednisolone, LE suspension exhibited
similar efficacy when used to reduce post-surgical ocular

 inflammation.8 A non-settling gel formulation of LE 0.5%
utilizing micronized drug particles (approximately 3 mm
diameter) was introduced in 2012 and was shown to pro-
vide consistent dose uniformity without the need to shake
before instillation.9,A The LE 0.5% gel formulation was
found to be safe and effective in treating inflammation
and pain after cataract surgery when dosed 4 times
daily.10–13 In addition, LE gel 0.5% has been shown to
be effective for the treatment of inflammation associated
with dry eye,B,C management of postoperative pain and
inflammation after laser in situ keratomileusis or photo-
refractive keratectomy surgery,14,15 and prevention of
immunologic graft rejection episodes after Descemet
membrane endothelial keratoplasty.16 In terms of safety,
clinical studies demonstrated that, with both short-term
and long-term use, LE formulations have a low propen-
sity
to
produce
clinically
significant
elevations
in
IOP.10,12,17 Furthermore, LE gel 0.5% is associated with
significantly lower rates of clinically significant IOP eleva-
tion compared with prednisolone acetate or dexametha-
sone (in combination with tobramycin).17
A lower-dose (0.38%) ophthalmic gel formulation of LE
using submicron-sized drug particles was recently devel-
oped using a milling process that creates drug particles
with a median diameter of approximately 0.6 mm (or 25-
fold smaller than the 3 mm median diameter micronized
drug particles in LE gel 0.5%). Reducing the particle size
to the nanometer range increases the surface area to vol-
ume ratio by 5-fold with the intent of improving the
ocular penetration of LE, thereby enabling effective con-
trol of inflammation and pain at dosing regimens of 2
or 3 times daily. This, in turn, would be expected to
enhance patient convenience and potentially improve
dosing compliance. As with LE gel 0.5%,9 the submicron
LE gel 0.38% formulation transitions to a liquid upon
topical ocular instillation but retains enough viscosity to
prolong retention on the ocular surface. Submicron LE
gel 0.38% also has a pH close to that of tears (pH 6.5)
and a low concentration of the preservative benzalkonium
chloride (0.003%), which would be expected to improve
comfort.
In vitro studies showed that the LE submicron drug par-
ticles used in LE gel 0.38% exhibited improved dissolution
kinetics over LE micronized particles used in LE 0.5% gel.A
Furthermore, a pharmacokinetic study in rabbits demon-
strated similar or improved penetration/exposure of LE
into the aqueous humor, iris/ciliary body, and cornea after
a single topical instillation of submicron LE gel 0.38%
compared with micronized LE gel 0.5%.D These preclinical
studies supported the concept that it might be possible to
reduce the frequency of administration with this new
formulation relative to LE 0.5% gel, which is instilled 4
times a day for the treatment of postoperative inflammation
and pain after ocular surgery. To evaluate this hypothesis,
the current study assessed the clinical safety and efficacy
of submicron LE gel 0.38% administered 3 times daily
and 2 times daily for the treatment of postoperative inflam-
mation and pain after cataract surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
This multicenter double-masked vehicle-controlled randomized
parallel-group study (NCT01996839E) was conducted at 45 sites
in the United States. The study was performed in accordance
with the International Conference on Harmonization standard
E6, Good Clinical Practices as required by the tenets of the Decla-
ration of Helsinki, and applicable local regulations. The study pro-
tocol was approved by a central Institutional Review Board
(Schulman Associates, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) before screening
patients, and all patients provided written informed consent.
The study enrolled patients who were 18 years of age or older
who had routine uncomplicated cataract surgery by phacoemulsi-
fication with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in
one eye and not combined with any other surgery. Eligible patients
had potential postoperative pinhole Snellen corrected distance vi-
sual acuity of at least 20/200 in the study (surgical) eye. On post-
operative
day
1,
patients
who
had
undergone
routine,
uncomplicated cataract surgery in the study eye and had at least
grade 2 anterior chamber cells (6 to 15 cells) were eligible to
continue study participation. Female patients of child-bearing
potential were required to have a negative urine pregnancy test
result at screening.
The study excluded patients who had a severe or serious ocular
condition, a history or presence of chronic generalized systemic
disease, ocular hypertension (IOP R21 mm Hg) at screening or
baseline (postoperative day 1) or glaucoma, had ocular surgery
in the study eye within 3 months or fellow eye within 2 weeks of
screening, had a current diagnosis of cystoid macular edema
(CME), were monocular, or had a known hypersensitivity to the
study drug or its components. Patients who used ocular therapy
with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mast cell
stabilizers, antihistamines, or decongestants within 7 days before
surgery or who were expected to require any of these treatments
(except for %81 mg/day of acetylsalicylic acid) during the
18 days after cataract surgery were excluded from participation.
In addition, the study excluded patients who had used systemic
or ocular corticosteroids within 14 days before cataract surgery,
those who were expected to require systemic or ocular use of cor-
ticosteroids or glucocorticoids during the study, and patients who
had used ocular immunosuppressants within 30 days before sur-
gery or were expected to require concurrent systemic or ocular
therapy with immunosuppressants during the study.
Study Treatments and Assessments
The investigational product was LE gel (Bausch C Lomb) contain-
ing submicron LE 0.38% and the preservative benzalkonium chlo-
ride 0.003%. The vehicle-only product did not contain LE but was
otherwise identical to the investigational product. Study treat-
ments (LE gel and vehicle) were packaged in identical polyethylene
bottles containing equal volumes and were supplied in identical
patient kit boxes. Treatments were assigned using numbered kits
along with instructions for the assigned dosing frequency. Investi-
gator masking to treatment regimen (ie, 2 versus 3 times a day
dosing) was achieved by assigning a designee at each site who
was not involved in assessing safety or efficacy to dispense treat-
ments and instruct patients on dosing.
Eligible patients completed 7 study visits starting with a
screening visit (visit 1) within 14 days before surgery. Visit 2
was the day of surgery. On visit 3, or postoperative day 1 (base-
line), patients with an anterior chamber cell grade 2 or higher
were randomized to study treatment according to a computer-
generated randomization list in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to LE gel 0.38% 2
times a day, LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day, vehicle 2 times a day,
or vehicle 3 times a day. Instillation of the first dose occurred at
the clinic. Thereafter, patients randomized to the 2 times a day
treatment instilled 1 drop into the study eye at approximately
12-hour intervals each day, whereas patients randomized to the
1221
POST-CATARACT SURGERY LE GEL FOR INFLAMMATION AND PAIN
Volume 44 Issue 10 October 2018
 3 times a day treatment instilled 1 drop into the study eye at
approximately 8-hour intervals each day for 14 days. Visits 4
and 5 were on postoperative days 3 and 8, respectively. The last
dose administered was the evening dose before visit 6 (postopera-
tive day 15). Compliance with dosing instructions was assessed us-
ing diaries, in which patients recorded the date and time of each
study treatment instillation.
At any time during the study, patients with worsening or no
change in inflammation could be placed on antiinflammatory
rescue medication at the discretion of the investigator. Patients
requiring antiinflammatory rescue medication discontinued study
treatment and were considered treatment failures, although they
were followed until the end of the study. The use of intracameral
antibiotic injection at the end of cataract surgery and/or perioper-
ative topical antibiotics (not in combination with a steroid) was
permitted at the investigator’s discretion. Topical antibiotics
were to be instilled at least 15 minutes before instillation of study
treatment.
Assessments were performed on postoperative days 3 (visit 4), 8
(visit 5), 15 (visit 6), and 18 (visit 7; study exit visit). Anterior
chamber cells and anterior chamber flare were assessed by the
investigator using a 1.0 mm � 1.0 mm high-power-field slit
beam and graded on a 5-point scale (cells: 0 Z no cells, 1 Z 1–5
cells, 2 Z 6–15 cells, 3 Z 16–30 cells, 4 Z O30 cells; flare:
0 Z none, 1 Z mild, 2 Z moderate, 3 Z severe, 4 Z very severe),
with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells defined as a
grade of 0, or no cells observed. Ocular pain was defined as foreign
body sensation, stabbing, throbbing, or aching, and it was graded
by patients on a 6-point scale (0 Z none, 1 Z minimal, 2 Z mild,
3 Z moderate, 4 Z moderately severe, 5 Z severe). Pinhole
Snellen visual acuity was assessed at each visit.
Tolerability of LE gel 0.38% and its vehicle were evaluated by the
proportion of patients with ocular symptoms (other than pain)
and gel comfort. Patients assessed any discomfort attributable to
study treatment at visit 5 by grading their overall impression of
drop sensation experienced within 1 minute after drop instillation
on a scale from 0 (none, or no discomfort) to 3 (severe discom-
fort). Ocular symptoms (photophobia, itching, tearing, and
discharge) were graded by the patients on a scale from 0 to 3 (ab-
sent, mild, moderate, severe) at screening and at each postopera-
tive visit as well, symptoms were classified as either “improved/
no change” or “worsened” as compared with visit 3 (1 day after
surgery).
Adverse events and concomitant medications were assessed at
each study visit. Treatment-emergent adverse events (hereafter,
adverse events) were defined as beginning or worsening after the
first dose of the study drug. Ocular signs and symptoms, pinhole
Snellen visual acuity, and IOP (Goldman applanation tonometry)
were assessed at screening and at all postoperative visits. Ocular
signs were evaluated using slitlamp biomicroscopy. A dilated
fundus examination was performed at screening and on postoper-
ative day 15.
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients
with
complete
resolution
of
anterior
chamber
cells
(cell
score Z 0) and the proportion of patients with grade 0 (no)
pain at postoperative day 8 (visit 5) in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day and 3 times a day groups and the combined vehicle group.
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients
at each on-treatment visit with complete resolution of anterior
chamber cells, grade 0 pain, complete resolution of anterior cham-
ber flare, complete resolution of both anterior chamber cells, and
anterior chamber flare; the change from baseline in anterior cham-
ber cells and flare, combined (defined as sum of scores for anterior
chamber cells and anterior chamber flare) and separately, at each
follow-up visit; and the proportion of treatment failures (defined
as having started rescue medication before or on day 8).
Safety and tolerability endpoints were ocular symptoms other
than pain (ie, photophobia, itching, tearing, and discharge), study
drug sensation, the incidence of ocular and non-ocular adverse
events, ocular signs (biomicroscopy), any change from baseline
in the dilated fundus examination, the change from baseline in
visual acuity, and the change from baseline in IOP.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 161 patients per treatment group was determined
to provide 90% power to detect a difference in the proportion of
patients with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells at
postoperative day 8 between LE gel 0.38% and vehicle using the
asymptotic Pearson chi-square test and resolution rate assump-
tions based on previous studies of LE gel 0.5% versus vehicle.10,12
The 2 vehicle arms were combined into 1 treatment group in the
statistical analysis, and hence the study reported on 3 treatment
groups, that is, LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day, LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day, and (combined) vehicle group.
The safety population included all patients who received at least
1 dose of study treatment. The intent-to-treat population was
comprised of all randomized patients. Patients in the intent-to-
treat population were analyzed in the treatment group to which
they were assigned. The per-protocol population included all
patients in the intent-to-treat population who remained in the
study through visit 5 (postoperative day 8), underwent an assess-
ment of the 2 primary endpoints at visit 5, and did not have any
significant protocol deviations.
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the intent-to-treat
population with missing data imputed as treatment failures. The
multiple endpoints and dose-vehicle comparison hypotheses
were tested sequentially to control the overall type I error rate
(a Z .05). The primary efficacy analyses of the difference between
each active treatment group and the combined vehicle treatment
group at postoperative day 8 in (1) the proportion of patients
with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells in the study
eye, followed hierarchically by (2) the proportion of patients
with grade 0 pain in the study eye was tested using asymptotic
Pearson chi-square statistic. Supportive analyses of the primary
efficacy endpoints were performed using the per-protocol popula-
tion and the intent-to-treat population imputing missing values
and post-rescue values using the last observation carried forward
method. As additional supportive analyses, endpoints were tested
using the asymptotic Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for
site (repeated on the per-protocol population and on the intent-to-
treat population using last observation carried forward). Similar
efficacy analyses were performed for secondary endpoints, where
indicated.
Safety and tolerability analyses were based on the safety popu-
lation. Safety endpoints were summarized by visit and treatment
group. Ocular symptoms other than pain were summarized at
each visit by category and treatment group using observed data.
For each post-baseline visit, the proportion of patients classified
as “worsened” was compared between each active treatment group
and the combined vehicle group using a Pearson chi-square test.
Study drug sensation was summarized by treatment on postoper-
ative day 8. Adverse events were summarized by system organ
class and preferred terms for each treatment group using the Med-
ical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version
16.1).F Biomicroscopy measures, fundoscopy findings, and visual
acuity were summarized using discrete summary statistics. Visual
acuity was summarized for each visit as a categorical variable and
as a line change from baseline. IOP was summarized at each visit
for each patient using both continuous variable summaries
(including change from baseline) and the proportion of patients
with change from screening in IOP at any post-baseline visit
R10 mm Hg.
All statistical testing was 2-sided and performed at the .05 sig-
nificance level noted. All analyses were performed using SAS soft-
ware (version 9.2 or higher, SAS Institute, Inc.).

POST-CATARACT SURGERY LE GEL FOR INFLAMMATION AND PAIN
Volume 44 Issue 10 October 2018
 RESULTS
Patients
A total of 514 patients were randomized at 45 surgical sites
and included in the intent-to-treat population (LE gel
0.38% 2 times a day, n Z 171; LE gel 0.38% 3 times a
day, n Z 171; vehicle, n Z 172), and 352 patients
completed the study (LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day,
n Z 133; LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day, n Z 139; vehicle,
n Z 80) (Figure 1). One patient who was randomized
(LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group) and included in the
intent-to-treat population did not receive the study drug
and was therefore not included in the safety population;
the remaining 513 patients were included in the safety pop-
ulation. Protocol deviations occurred in 126 patients, re-
sulting in 387 patients in the per-protocol population (LE
gel 0.38% 2 times a day, n Z 133; LE gel 0.38% 3 times a
day, n Z 141; vehicle, n Z 113). The numbers (percent-
ages) of patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day, LE gel
0.38% 3 times a day, and vehicle group who completed
the study through day 8 (visit 5) were 161 (94.2%), 158
(92.4%), and 131 (76.2%), respectively, and the numbers
(percentages) of those who completed the study through
day 18 (visit 7) were 133 (77.8%), 139 (81.3%), and 80
(46.5%), respectively.
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics
Overall, the majority of patients were white, female, and
had brown iris color, and individual treatment groups
were comparable with respect to demographic characteris-
tics (Table 1). Ocular and non-ocular medical histories were
similar in the treatment groups and consistent with those of
a study population approximately 70 years of age. At base-
line, the mean anterior chamber cell unit score was
2.4 G 0.59 (SD) in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day group,
2.5 G 0.58 in the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group, and
2.5 G 0.64 in the vehicle group. Baseline mean flare scores
were also comparable in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day
(0.8 G 0.65), LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day (0.8 G 0.69),
and vehicle (0.7 G 0.71) groups, as were baseline mean
summed anterior chamber cells and flare unit scores
(3.2 G 0.90, 3.3 G 0.98, and 3.2 G 1.10, respectively).
Concomitant ophthalmic antibiotic use during the study
varied and included (in order of overall frequency) moxi-
floxacin, ciprofloxacin, besifloxacin, and gatifloxacin.
Rescue Medication
Over the course of the study, rescue medication was
required by 39 (22.8%) patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day group, 35 (20.6%) in the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day
group, and 90 (52.3%) in the vehicle group. The most
commonly used classes of rescue medications were topical
corticosteroids (most frequently prednisolone or diflupred-
nate) and/or NSAIDs (most frequently nepafenac or
bromfenac).
Treatment Compliance
The mean compliance rates across the entire treatment
period (postoperative day 1 [visit 3] to 15 [visit 6]) were
90.6% G 24.1% for the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day group,
90.4% G 23.0% for the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group,
and 69.7% G 34.5% for the vehicle group. Analysis of over-
all compliance indicated that 140 (81.9%) patients in the LE
gel 0.38% 2 times a day group, 148 (87.1%) patients in the
LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group, and 91 (52.9%) patients in
the vehicle group had dosing compliance rates between 80%
and 100%. The mean dosing compliance rates through day
8 (visit 5) were 95.9% G 17.6% for the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day group, 93.5% G 18.1% for the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a
day group, and 82.1% G 28.1% for the vehicle group.
Through visit 5, 156 (91.2%), 158 (92.9%), and 129
(75.0%) patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day, LE gel
0.38% 3 times a day, and vehicle group, respectively, had
dosing compliance rates between 80% and 100%.

POST-CATARACT SURGERY LE GEL FOR INFLAMMATION AND PAIN
Volume 44 Issue 10 October 2018
 Efficacy
Primary Efficacy Endpoints In the intent-to-treat population,
compared with vehicle, complete resolution of anterior
chamber cells on day 8 was significantly greater in patients
in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day (mean difference,
[95% confidence interval {CI}], 17.6% [9.7%, 25.5%];
P ! .0001) and LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day (mean difference
[95% CI], 19.4% [11.3%, 27.4%]; P ! .0001) groups
(Figure 2). Similarly, the percentages of patients reporting
complete resolution of ocular pain (grade 0) in the study
eye at day 8 in the intent-to-treat population were
significantly greater in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day group
(mean
[95%
CI]
difference,
26.0%
[16.0%,
36.0%];
P ! .0001) and LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day (mean difference
[95% CI], 25.4% [15.4%, 35.4%]; P ! .0001) groups than in
the vehicle group. Results of analyses in the per-protocol
population and the intent-to-treat population using last
observation carried forward were consistent with those of
the primary efficacy analysis.
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Compared with the vehicle
group, significantly higher proportions of intent-to-treat
patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day group and the
LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group had complete resolution
of anterior chamber cells, resolution of ocular pain, resolu-
tion of flare, and resolution of both anterior chamber cells
and flare at day 8 (visit 5), day 15 (visit 6) and day 18 (visit
7; Table 2). The mean changes from baseline in anterior
chamber cell, anterior chamber flare, and anterior chamber
cells and flare combined were significantly greater in the LE
gel 0.38% 2 times a day and 3 times a day groups than in the
vehicle group at day 8 (visit 5), day 15 (visit 6), and day 18
(visit 7; Figure 3). In addition, the mean change from base-
line in anterior chamber flare and anterior chamber cells
and flare combined were significantly greater in the LE
gel 0.38% 2 times a day and LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day
groups compared with the vehicle group at day 3 (visit 4).
Significantly greater proportions of patients in the LE gel
0.38% 2 times a day group and the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a
day group compared with the vehicle group also had com-
plete resolution of ocular pain at day 3 (visit 4) and every

 study visit thereafter (Table 2). With few exceptions at spe-
cific visits, outcomes based on analysis of these secondary
endpoints in the per-protocol population were supportive
of findings with the intent-to-treat population.
The need for rescue medication provided another
perspective on the effectiveness of dosing LE gel 0.38% 2
times a day or 3 times a day. The proportion of patients
who were treatment failures (required rescue medication)
by day 8 (visit 5) was significantly lower in the LE gel
0.38% 2 times a day (24 [14.0%] of 171; P ! 0.0001) and
0.38% 3 times a day (19 [11.1%] of 171; P ! .0001) groups
compared with the vehicle group (72 [41.9%] of 172).
Safety and Tolerability
Exposure The mean duration of exposure was 12.7 G
3.13 days for the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day group,
13.0 G 3.16 days for the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group,
and 10.1 G 4.64 days for the vehicle group.
Adverse Events Overall, adverse events occurred at a com-
parable or lower incidence in the LE 0.38% 2 times a day
group (17 [9.9%] of 171) and the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a
day group (10 [5.9%] of 170) relative to the vehicle group
(20 [11.6%] of 172). The most common ocular adverse
events occurring in the study eye were eye pain, photo-
phobia, and foreign body sensation. Excluding adverse
events that occurred after initiation of rescue medication
in patients requiring rescue medication, ocular adverse
events were reported by 5 (2.9%), 2 (1.2%), and 12 (7.0%)
of patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day, LE gel
0.38% 3 times a day, and vehicle groups, respectively. The
proportion of patients experiencing at least 1 treatment-
related adverse event in the study eye was lower in the LE
gel 0.38% 2 times a day group and the LE gel 0.38% 3 times
a day group compared with the vehicle group (Table 3).
There
were
no
ocular
adverse
events
considered
treatment-related that occurred more than once in any
treatment group. Two patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day group experienced adverse events of increased IOP (1
in the study eye, 1 in the fellow eye); both were considered
mild in severity, resolved within 7 days, and were not
considered to be related to study treatment.
The number of patients experiencing at least 1 non-
ocular adverse event was 6 (3.5%) of 171 in the 0.38% LE
0.38% 2 times a day group, 4 (2.4%) of 170 in the 0.38%
LE 0.38% 3 times a day group, and 1 (0.6%) of 172 in the
vehicle group. No non-ocular adverse event was experi-
enced by more than 1% of patients in any treatment group,
and none were considered related to study treatment.
The majority of both ocular and non-ocular adverse
events were mild or moderate in severity. One patient expe-
rienced a severe non-serious ocular adverse event (LE gel
0.38% 2 times a day group, photophobia in the study eye)
that was not considered related to study treatment. This

 adverse event resolved within 6 days after treatment discon-
tinuation. One patient in the vehicle group experienced a
serious adverse event of endophthalmitis, and another pa-
tient in the vehicle group experienced a serious adverse
event of CME that occurred 11 days after study completion.
Neither of these serious adverse events were considered
related to study treatment. Two patients in the LE gel
0.38% 2 times a day group experienced severe non-ocular
adverse events: a small intestinal obstruction considered
not related to the study drug that resolved within 5 days,
and dizziness that was considered not serious and not
related to the study drug and that resolved in 2 days.
Overall, 5 patients receiving LE gel 0.38% discontinued
the study drug because of adverse events, which were all
considered unrelated to the study drug (3 in the LE gel
0.38% 2 times a day group, 2 in the LE gel 0.38% 3 times
a day group). There were 7 patients in the vehicle group
who discontinued because of adverse events, 2 of which
were considered related to the study drug. Three patients
withdrew from the study because of adverse events (in the
study eye), including 1 patient in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day group (CME, which occurred after completion of all
assigned doses of the study drug [not serious, mild, ongoing
at study exit]), and 2 patients in the vehicle group (cataract
operation complication [not serious, moderate, considered
not related to the study drug, resolved] and endophthalmi-
tis [serious, moderate, not resolved at study exit]). None of
these events were considered related to study treatment.
Biomicroscopy Findings
Biomicroscopy showed that fewer patients in the LE gel
0.38% treatment groups compared with the vehicle group
had worsening of ocular signs. In the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day group, fewer patients had worsening of anterior
chamber flare and bulbar conjunctival injection at all visits,
palpebral conjunctival injection and corneal edema on days
3 and 8, ciliary flush on day 3, and conjunctival chemosis on
day 15 (all P % .04 versus vehicle). For LE gel 0.38% 3 times
a day, fewer patients had worsening of bulbar conjunctival
injection at all post-surgical visits; anterior chamber flare,
palpebral conjunctival injection, corneal edema, and ciliary
flush on days 3 and 8; anterior chamber cells on day 3;
corneal staining on day 8; and conjunctival chemosis on
day 15 (all P % .04 versus vehicle).
Fundoscopy Findings
Fundoscopy findings were comparable across treatment
groups at screening and at day 15, with no abnormalities re-
ported in the majority of study eyes. Worsening in retina
assessments was observed in 1 study eye in the vehicle
group, whereas 1 study eye in the vehicle group and 2 study
eyes in the LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day group showed wors-
ening in macula assessments. No study eye in any treatment
group showed worsening in the optic nerve cup-to-disc
ratio.
Visual Acuity
At day 8, significantly fewer patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2
times a day group (4 [2.5%] of 161; P Z .0405) and the LE
gel 0.38% 3 times a day group (2 [1.3%] of 158; P Z .0069)
had a decrease in VA of 3 lines or more since the baseline
visit compared with the vehicle group (10 [7.7%] of 130).
Intraocular Pressure
The mean IOP at screening for study eyes was similar across
treatment groups (15.5 G 2.3 mm Hg, 15.3 G 2.6 mm Hg,
and 15.4 G 2.3 mm Hg for the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day,

 LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day, and vehicle group, respectively).
In all groups, mean IOP decreased from screening at all
post-baseline visits. At the last on-treatment study visit
(day 15), mean IOP was 14.1 G 2.8, 14.4 G 2.7, and 14.3
G 2.8 mm Hg for the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day, LE gel
0.38% 3 times a day, and vehicle group, respectively.
A clinically significant increase (R10 mm Hg) from
screening in IOP was experienced by 2 patients in the LE
gel 0.38% 2 times a day group in the study eye. One patient
had an IOP of 45 mm Hg at baseline that was managed by
an intervention and reduced to 21 mm Hg before random-
ization. That patient subsequently had a transient on-
treatment IOP elevation to 30.5 mm Hg (IOP elevation
also reported as an adverse event). A second patient in
the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day group had a change from
screening in IOP in the study eye R10 mm Hg, after initi-
ating rescue medication. Two patients (one in each LE gel
0.38% group) experienced IOP elevations R10 mm Hg
from screening in the fellow eye before rescue medication
use.
Tolerability
At baseline, 50.6% to 57.0% of patients had grade 0 (no)
photophobia, 75.3% to 80.1% had grade 0 (no), itching,
63.2% to 69.2% had grade 0 (no) tearing, and 91.2% to
95.3% had grade 0 (no) ocular discharge. Analysis of ocular
symptoms in the study eye at postoperative follow-up visits,
excluding patients requiring rescue medication, indicated
that significantly fewer patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times
a day group compared with the vehicle group had wors-
ening of photophobia at day 3 (P Z .0083) and day 8
(P Z .0032), itching at day 3 (P Z .0289), and tearing at
day 15 (P Z .0447). Similarly, significantly fewer patients
receiving LE gel 0.38% 3 times a day versus vehicle had
worsening of photophobia at day 3 (P Z .0011), day 8
(P Z .0001), and day 15 (P Z .0350) and itching at day
15 (P Z .0446).
At day 8, 129 (80.1%), 122 (77.7%), and 107 (82.3%)
patients in the LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day, LE gel 0.38% 3
times a day, and vehicle group, respectively, reported no
discomfort in the study eye. There were no reports of severe
drop discomfort in any treatment group, and moderate
discomfort was reported by 3 (1.9%) patients in the LE
0.38% 2 times a day group and 4 (2.5%) patients in the
LE 0.38% 3 times a day group.
DISCUSSION
Results
of
this
multicenter,
double-masked,
vehicle-
controlled, randomized study suggest that submicron LE
gel 0.38%, dosed either 2 times a day or 3 times a day, pro-
duces robust and sustained resolution of ocular inflamma-
tion and pain after cataract surgery. Significantly greater
proportions of patients receiving submicron LE gel 0.38%
dosed either 2 times a day or 3 times a day had complete
resolution of anterior chamber cells and no ocular pain
compared with patients receiving vehicle on day 8, the pri-
mary efficacy assessment timepoint. Statistically significant
differences versus vehicle were sustained at all subsequent
visits through postoperative day 18.
New LE gel 0.38%, with LE particles in the nanometer
range, also appeared safe and well tolerated regardless of
whether administered 2 times a day or 3 times a day.
The most common ocular adverse events occurring in
the study eye (eye pain, photophobia, and foreign body
sensation) were consistent with the cataract surgery pro-
cedure itself. There were no severe or serious adverse
events considered related to treatment, and no patient dis-
continued LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day or 3 times a day
because
of
a
treatment-related
adverse
event.
Bio-
microscopy and visual acuity findings in LE gel 0.38% 2
times a day and 3 times a day groups were similar to or
significantly improved as compared with those in the
vehicle group, and fundoscopy findings were comparable
across all treatment groups. There were no reports of
blurred vision related to the study drug. Consistent with
previous studies of LE 0.5%,17 LE gel 0.38% administered
2 times a day or 3 times a day did not elevate mean IOP
and did not appear to elicit any clinically significant IOP
elevations O10 mm Hg. This finding is clinically impor-
tant considering that persistent, uncontrolled elevations
of IOP with corticosteroid therapy can lead to optic nerve
damage (eg, steroid-induced glaucoma).5,18 Patient reports

POST-CATARACT SURGERY LE GEL FOR INFLAMMATION AND PAIN
Volume 44 Issue 10 October 2018
 ocular symptoms (photophobia, tearing, itching, ocular
discharge) were significantly less among patients in the
LE gel 0.38% 2 times a day and 3 times a day groups
compared with the vehicle group, and the majority of pa-
tients reported no drop discomfort upon drop instillation.
In general, the observed magnitudes of difference
between submicron LE gel 0.38% and vehicle in the cur-
rent study for resolution of anterior chamber cells, flare
and pain appear similar, if not better, to those previ-
ously reported for patients treated with micronized LE
0.5% gel administered 4 times a day. The differences
versus vehicle in the proportions of patients achieving
complete resolution of anterior chamber cells by day 8
were 17.6% (2 times a day) and 19.4% (3 times a day)
with submicron LE gel 0.38% in the current study and
15.7% in a combined analysis of 2 trials of micronized
LE 0.5% gel.11 Similarly, the differences versus vehicle
in the proportions of patients reporting no pain at day
8 was 25.4% (2 times a day) and 26.0% (3 times a
day) with submicron LE gel 0.38% in the current study
compared with 30.5% in the LE gel 0.5% combined anal-
ysis at day 8. For both resolution of anterior chamber
cells and pain, the effects of submicron LE gel 0.38%
relative to vehicle appeared comparable to treatment ef-
fects reported in vehicle-controlled studies of diflupred-
nate 0.05%.19,20
The new LE gel 0.38% formulation was developed with a
submicron drug particle size to increase or maintain ocular
levels of LE in key anterior segment tissues (iris/ciliary
body, aqueous humor, cornea) while lowering the drug
concentration relative to micronized LE gel 0.5%.D The
clinical benefit of enhanced penetration can allow for less
frequent dosing, which, in turn, has the potential to
improve compliance.21 It has been demonstrated, for
example, that reducing dosing frequency with ocular hypo-
tensive medications increases patient compliance.22–24 Re-
sults of the current study suggest that a reduced dosing
regimen with LE gel 0.38% formulation (2 times or 3 times
a day) was effective for the treatment of ocular pain and
inflammation after cataract surgery. The simpler dosing
regimen might offer an advantage over currently available
corticosteroid formulations that require more frequent
administration in terms of greater treatment adherence
and less administration burden on patients. Along with
effective control of inflammation and pain at a lower
dose/dose regimen, the submicron LE gel 0.38% formula-
tion provides the benefits associated with a pH close to
physiological conditions (6.5) and a low level of benzalko-
nium chloride (0.003%); furthermore, this formulation is
non-settling, requiring no shaking before instillation. It
also contains polycarbophil as well as glycerin and propyl-
ene glycol, 2 known demulcents, which might lead to better
drop comfort.
In conclusion, in this study, submicron LE gel 0.38%,
instilled either 2 or 3 times a day, appeared safe and effective
for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain
after cataract surgery. Both dosing regimens were associ-
ated with robust and sustained clinical benefits. Further
studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to eval-
uate the efficacy and safety in the treatment of inflamma-
tion after other types of ocular surgeries and medical
inflammatory conditions of the eye.
WHAT WAS KNOWN
� Loteprednol etabonate is a topical ophthalmic corticosteroid
with a low propensity to cause side effects, including
elevation of IOP.
� Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.5% is approved in
the U.S. and other countries for the treatment of inflammation
and pain after ocular surgery with 4 times daily instillation.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
� This study evaluated a new gel formulation of loteprednol
etabonate with lower drug concentration (0.38%) and
reduced drug particle diameter (in the nanometer range) for
the treatment of pain and inflammation after cataract surgery
with either 2 or 3 times daily instillations.
� Submicron loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.38%,
instilled either 2 or 3 times daily, appeared safe and effica-
cious in treating postoperative inflammation and pain.
