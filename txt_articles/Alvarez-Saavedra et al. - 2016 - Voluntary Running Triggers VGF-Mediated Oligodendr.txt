In Brief
Alvarez-Saavedra et al. find that voluntary
running induces expression of the VGF
growth factor and improves the ataxic
phenotype of Snf2h cKO mice. Surviving
Snf2h cKO mice show enhanced
oligodendrogenesis and myelination in
the hindbrain that is not seen in sedentary
Snf2h cKO or control mice. Adenoviral-
mediated VGF overexpression can also
improve motor deficits and prolong
lifespan without exercise.

SUMMARY
Exercise has been argued to enhance cognitive
function and slow progressive neurodegenerative
disease. Although exercise promotes neurogenesis,
oligodendrogenesis and adaptive myelination are
also significant contributors to brain repair and brain
health. Nonetheless, the molecular details underlying
these effects remain poorly understood. Conditional
ablation of the Snf2h gene impairs cerebellar devel-
opment producing mice with poor motor function,
progressive ataxia, and death between postnatal
days 25–45. Here, we show that voluntary running
induced an endogenous brain repair mechanism
that resulted in a striking increase in hindbrain myeli-
nation and the long-term survival of Snf2h cKO mice.
Further experiments identified the VGF growth factor
as a major driver underlying this effect. VGF neuro-
peptides
promote
oligodendrogenesis
in
vitro,
whereas Snf2h cKO mice treated with full-length
VGF-encoding adenoviruses removed the require-
ment of exercise for survival. Together, these results
suggest that VGF delivery could represent a thera-
peutic strategy for cerebellar ataxia and other pathol-
ogies of the CNS.
INTRODUCTION
Clinical studies show that physical exercise protects against
brain atrophy and reduces the risk of dementia, as well as pro-
moting cerebral and cardiovascular health (Barnes, 2015). The
protective effect of exercise is also being recognized as a means
to enhance cognitive function and slow down neurodegenerative
disease progression and disability (Erickson et al., 2011; Pereira
et al., 2007). Indeed, rodent studies have confirmed that exercise
regimens improve motor and cognitive functions in a variety of
neurodegenerative models including stroke, Parkinson’s dis-
ease, Alzheimer’s disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and multiple
sclerosis (Abbott et al., 2004; Colcombe et al., 2004; Cruise
et al., 2011; Fryer et al., 2011; Heyn et al., 2004; Khalil et al.,
2013; Verghese et al., 2003). Despite these advances, our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which exercise
impedes or protects from neurodegeneration remains poorly
understood.
Physical exercise increases skeletal muscle metabolism by
enhanced contractile and epinephrine activity that drive adap-
tive responses to alter whole body energy and glucose homeo-
stasis. Among these responses is the secretion of autocrine
and paracrine factors from the muscle, collectively called myo-
kines. These include IL-6, IL-15, IGF-1, and brain-derived
growth factor (BDNF), whose functions are to increase appetite,
improve mood, increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphoryla-
tion, and enhance overall metabolic efficiency (Pedersen and
Febbraio, 2012). Of these, BDNF has an impact on brain func-
tion with several studies demonstrating that exercise pro-
motes the generation of new neurons within the hippocampus,
improves memory, and improves performance in aged mice
(van Praag et al., 1999a, 1999b, 2005). Similarly, the neuropep-
tide precursor VGF (non-acronymic; also known as nerve
growth factor inducible; unrelated to VEGF) is also upregulated
upon exercise and promotes an anti-depressant response
(Hunsberger et al., 2007). Other studies suggest that VGF-
processed peptides function to maintain BDNF expression in
a VGF-BDNF-positive feedback loop (Alder et al., 2003; Boz-
dagi et al., 2008; Hunsberger et al., 2007). However, the

 importance of VGF to delaying or preventing neurodegenera-
tion remains obscure.
Although significant attention has focused on the idea that ex-
ercise promotes the activation of neurogenesis, recent papers
suggest that oligodendrogenesis is also a significant contributor
to brain repair and the maintenance of brain health. Recent
studies have shown that neuronal activity promotes oligoden-
drogenesis and adaptive myelination in complex learning tasks
or following demyelination injury (Brousse et al., 2015; Gautier
et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2014). Voluntary exercise also
increased oligodendrogenesis in the spinal cord of nestin-GFP
transgenic mice (Krityakiarana et al., 2010). Other studies show
that injury results in massive recruitment of cells from the sub-
ventricular zone (SVZ) that adopt an oligodendrocytic fate,
whereas another study showed that de novo synapse formation
onto OPCs resulted in glutamate-induced differentiation of oligo-
dendrocytes to facilitate remyelination (Brousse et al., 2015;
Gautier et al., 2015). Similarly, Piao et al. (2015) demonstrated
that engrafted OPCs derived from human ESCs could facili-
tate forebrain and cerebellar remyelination, which functionally
improved cognitive and motor deficits of irradiated animals.
Despite these exciting findings, the molecular pathways driving
recovery of these pathological states require further investiga-
tion. Nonetheless, manipulating levels of OPC genes, including
Olig2, Sox2, or TAPP1 have been shown to influence OPC
recruitment and/or myelination thereby inferring the importance
of external signaling pathways on this process, such as those
induced by exercise (Chen et al., 2015; Wegener et al., 2015;
Zhao et al., 2015).
Recently, we characterized mice inactivated for the Snf2h
gene demonstrating that these animals have cerebellar hypopla-
sia, develop severe ataxia by postnatal day 20 (P20), and die
between P25–P45 (Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2014). At the cellular
level, these mice generate significantly fewer granule and Pur-
kinje cells (PC) within the cerebellum, accompanied by poor
PC dendritic arborization. Molecularly, alterations in chromatin
folding underlie the progressive death of surviving neurons. In
this study, we assessed whether our model was receptive to ex-
ercise therapy and could be used to identify molecules and/or
novel pathways that delayed the progression of this neurode-
generative phenotype. Here, we present evidence to suggest
that the long-term survival of these mice is attained through
voluntary exercise. Exercise induced the myelination of cere-
bellar neurons, amelioration of motor deficits and a significant
extension of lifespan that was dependent on continued exercise
or adenoviral-mediated VGF overexpression.
RESULTS
Voluntary Running Extends the Lifespan of Snf2h
cKO Mice
To investigate the mechanisms linking exercise to neural protec-
tion, we made use of mice ablated for the chromatin remodeler
Snf2h in the brain that develop a progressive neurodegenerative
and ataxic phenotype (Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2014). Condi-
tional Snf2h-null mice have an abnormal gait with reduced
weight gain by postnatal day 10 (P10), that progresses to clas-
sical signs of cerebellar ataxia by P20. Mice perform poorly in
motor function tests at this age, continue to physically degen-
erate, show progressive Purkinje cell (PC) loss, and die between
P25–P45 (Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2014). Morphologically, the
cerebellum of Snf2h cKO mice is one-third the size of control lit-
termates due to a severe reduction in granule neuron progenitor
expansion, coupled with the progressive death of PCs (Alvarez-
Saavedra et al., 2014). Given the progressive nature of the
phenotype and the collective finding that exercise can improve
neurodegenerative disorders, we reasoned that the Snf2h cKO
mice would be a good model to further examine the underlying
mechanisms involved. To assess whether our model was recep-
tive to exercise therapy, we provided them with unlimited access
to a running wheel shortly after weaning (�P21–P23). Strikingly,
voluntary running prolonged the survival of Snf2h cKO animals
beyond 1 year of age (Figure 1A). Running was critical for long-
term survival as a cohort of mice that received the running wheel
at P21–P25 but had it removed at P100 showed a progressive
decline and death between P150–P200 (Figure 1A). Along with
survival, running increased weight gain in Snf2h cKO mice at a
rate that was similar to wild-type littermate controls (Figure 1B).
Snf2h cKO mice showed daily improvement in the distance trav-
eled but overall averaged one-half the total traveled distance of
control littermates (Figure 1C). Previously, we demonstrated
that the Snf2h cKO mice have motor deficits, as they fell much
quicker from either a small elevated platform or when placed
on a rotarod, a rotating rod that increases in speed with time
(Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2014). As such, we repeated these
assays with Snf2h cKO runner mice. Running improved perfor-
mance in the rotarod assay (Figure 1D) and open field tests
(Figures 1E–1G). Moreover, Snf2h cKO mice tested in the
elevated platform and rotarod assays 50 days post-wheel
removal displayed diminished performance compared to mice
that continued to run (Figures 1H and 1I; Movies S1, S2, S3,
S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8).
Voluntary Running Triggers Oligodendrogenesis,
Myelination, and PC Dendritic Arborization of the Ataxic
Cerebellum
Because physical exercise can trigger both neurogenesis and
oligodendrogenesis in the murine forebrain (Krityakiarana et al.,
2010; van Praag et al., 1999a), we next determined which pro-
cess was active in hindbrain areas. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
was administered via the drinking water (2 g/L) to label dividing
cells between P21–P35 in wild-type controls (hereon referred
to as WT) and Snf2h cKO mice (cKO hereon) provided with
running wheels at P21. Whole brain sagittal sections through
the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of the cerebellum and the infe-
rior olivary nucleus within the brain stem (also known as inferior
olive), a major site of input into the cerebellum, were then
analyzed either 55 or 145 days post-BrdU administration (P90
or 180, respectively) for BrdU+ cells co-stained with the oligo-
dendrocyte precursor (OP) or oligodendrocyte (OL) markers
NG2 and Olig2, respectively. As expected, we observed promi-
nent BrdU-labeling within the hippocampus in WT-Runner and
cKO-Runner mice relative to sedentary controls (Figure S1).
We did not detect any BrdU-labeled PCs in the cerebellum of
any genotype (data not shown). However, cKO-Runner mice

 cerebellum and the brain stem (Figures 2A–2C, S2, and S3),
suggesting that oligodendrogenesis may partially underlie the
long-term recovery of ataxic exercising mice. Indeed, BrdU-re-
taining cells that co-expressed the differentiated OL marker
Olig2 were significantly upregulated in cKO-Runners at P90
and P180 relative to all controls in both the cerebellum and
inferior olive (Figure 2D). We additionally attempted to block oli-
godendrogenesis by administering 10 mg/kg trichostatin A (TSA)
at P30, as has been recently described (Gibson et al., 2014), and
co-administered EdU the following day for 3 consecutive days at
100 mg/kg. Cerebella were analyzed at P40 with double labeling
for EdU and NG2, but we did not observe a significant decrease
on the number of NG2+/EdU+ cells in the cerebella of Snf2h
cKO-Runner mice with TSA or vehicle treatment (Figure S4).
Because neurodegenerative pathologies are also associated
with increased inflammation (Fernandes et al., 2014; Skaper,
2007), we assessed the total number of Iba1+ microglia or
GFAP+ astrocytes within the cerebellum and inferior olive from
all genotypes. This experiment revealed no changes in the total
number of either Iba+ or GFAP+ cells (Figures 2E and 2F).
To assess whether the increased number of Ng2+ and
Olig2+ OPs and OLs resulted in increased myelination, toluidine

 blue-stained and ultrathin transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images from the molecular layer and the white matter
of the cerebellum were obtained from WT and cKO mice
125 days post-running (wheels introduced at P25) and from
P25 WT and cKO sedentary mice as controls. Strikingly, we
observed myelin rings surrounding most PCs in cKO-Runner
mice that were not present in WT-Sedentary, WT-Runner, or
cKO-Sedentary mice (Figures 3A, 3B, and S5A–S5C). As control,
the white matter of the cerebellar lobes from all genotypes
showed comparable myelination (Figure 3A, rightmost panels),
as well as the sciatic nerves (Figure S5D). Myelination is not typi-
cally present within the molecular layer of the cerebellum and due
to the disorganization of the mutant cerebellum, we were unable
to determine if the myelination was present on axons of PCs pro-
jecting from a different plane, or derived from the parallel and
climbing fibers of granule or inferior olivary neurons, respectively.
Regardless, we speculated that increased myelination protects
and strengthens the function of the existing neurons in the cere-
bellum of mutant mice. Because increased myelination confers
improved neuronal function and because running activity was
shown to improve PC dendritic arborization (Fernandes et al.,
2014), we next examined the thickness of the molecular layer.
Indeed, we observed a significant increase in the thickness of
the molecular layer in both WT-Runner and cKO-Runner mice
versus WT-Sedentary and cKO-Sedentary animals (Figures 4A–
4D). These results are further supported as increased PC den-
dritic growth has been previously attributed to running activity
in wild-type rodents (Pysh and Weiss, 1979). To further attribute
this to a neuronal effect, we co-labeled WT and cKO Sedentary
or Running (15 days post running; wheels in at P25) mice with
the serotonin transporter (Slc4a6) and Calbindin, a marker of
PCs. We observed increased Slc4a6 puncta within the PC
soma of cKO-R mice relative to all control genotypes, suggesting
that running enhanced the activity and survival of existing mutant
PCs (Figure 4E). As an additional control, we performed histology
on the transverse abdominal (TA) muscle of control and Snf2h

Comparative RNA Sequencing Analysis Identified
Increased Levels of the VGF Neuropeptide
Concomitant to our cellular studies, we performed RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments to identify potential mo-
lecular correlates contributing to the exercise-induced rescue
of cKO mice. While we recognize that some gene expression
changes may arise from differences in certain cell types
in the mutant cerebellum (i.e., reduced granule neurons), it
provides a useful starting point to initiate molecular studies.
We performed a four-way comparative analysis between
samples sequenced from WT-Sedentary, WT-Runner, cKO-
Sedentary, and cKO-Runner cerebella, identifying 2,290 upre-
gulated and 1,321 downregulated genes in the cKO-R versus
WT-R analysis (Figure 5; see Data S1 for complete gene lists).
Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were consistent with our find-
ings, namely that genes involved in neurotransmitter release
and activity-dependent synaptic transmission (e.g., dopamine
transporter [Slc6a3], noradrenaline transporter [Slc6a2], sero-
tonin transporter [Slc6a4], choline transporter [Slc5a7], and
vesicular monoamine transporter [Slc18a2], among others)
were increased (Figure 6A). In addition, we observed an in-
crease in growth factors (e.g., Dlk1 and Tdgf1) and the exer-
cise-induced neuropeptide precursor protein VGF (Figure 6B)
(Hunsberger et al., 2007). We validated VGF as well as several
other neuropeptide precursor genes (e.g., chromogranin-B
[ChgB], vasointestinal peptide [VIP], gastrin-releasing peptide
[GRP], neuropeptide Y [NPY], and somatostatin [Sst], as
well as brain-derived growth factor [BDNF], among others)
to be significantly upregulated in cKO-Runner versus cKO-
Sedentary cerebella and brain stems with TaqMan-based
qPCR (Figure 6B). Lastly, we found that the VGF precur-
sor
protein
is
robustly
and
significantly
upregulated
in
cerebella of Snf2h cKO-Runner mice relative to Snf2h cKO-
Sedentary, Control-Sedentary, and Control-Runner mice after

Figure 6C).
VGF Promotes the Proliferation and Differentiation of
OP Cultures
The upregulation of the VGF gene was of particular interest
because it was reported to be highly expressed in OPs (Dugas
etal., 2006).Furthermore,itsupregulationuponexerciseactivates
the anti-depressant response in mammals and maintains BDNF
expression in a VGF-BDNF-positive feedback loop (Alder et al.,
2003; Bozdagi et al., 2008; Hunsberger et al., 2007). Moreover,
reduced VGF peptide levels are considered biomarkers for both
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease, pa-
thologies that have a demyelination component (Pasinetti et al.,
2006; Selle et al., 2005). Hence, we next asked whether VGF

 peptides could stimulate the growth and/or differentiation of ho-
mogenous preparations of primary cortical mouse OPs (O’Meara
et al., 2011). VGF is cleaved to produce numerous C-terminal
bioactive peptides including TLQP-62, TLQP-21, and AQEE-30,
among others (Lewis et al., 2015). As such, we treated OP cultures
with previously characterized peptides that trigger BDNF produc-
tion TLQP-21 (3 mM), AQEE-30 (3 mM), BDNF (50 ng/mL), or DMSO

along with the proliferation marker BrdU
and analyzed them 48 hr later by scoring
the number of NG2+/BrdU+ cells. In paral-
lel, we also counted the total number
of NG2+ cells to assess endogenous pro-
liferation. Interestingly, we observed a
significant increase in the total number
of NG2+ cells and in the total number
of proliferating Ng2+/BrdU+ OPs when
treated with the TLQP-21 VGF peptide.
In contrast, no significant differences
were observed in any of the other treat-
ments (Figure 7A). We next assessed
differentiation of the cultures with the
mature OL markers myelin-associated
glycoprotein (MAG) and myelin basic
protein (MBP), where we observed that
TLQP-21 also increased the average
oligodendrocyte dendriticlength suggesting that this VGFpeptide
can promote both OP proliferation and their subsequent differen-
tiationintoOLs(Figures7Band7C).Indeed,VGFproteinlevelsare
robust early in the OP differentiation cascade (Figure S7). Taken
together, these results raised the exciting possibility that VGF is
impacting the OL lineage and contributes to the long-term survival
of running cKO mice.

 Adenoviral-Encoded Full-Length VGF Delivery
Increased Myelination and Prolonged the Lifespan of
Snf2h-Null Ataxic Mice
To determine whether VGF was sufficient to rescue the lifespan
of cKO mice, we generated adenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing
full-length mouse VGF protein (Ross and Parks, 2009). Control
and sedentary cKO mice received tail vein injections at �P21
(1 3 1012 viral particles/kg) and their survival was recorded.
Strikingly, cKO mice that received the Ad-VGF injections were
alive and healthy at P300 (time of analysis) whereas uninjected
cKO or Ad-control (no VGF cDNA)-injected cKO mice perished
between P25 and P45 using both C57Bl/6 and FVB/N back-
crossed cKO strains (Figure 7D). Using qPCR to compare tran-
script levels between cKO Ad-control and cKO Ad-VGF, we
were able to detect significant VGF mRNA upregulation in the
heart, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem, with highest
levels in the liver, the primary site of adenoviral transduction (Fig-
ure 7E). However, we only detected upregulation of the BDNF
transcript in the brain (hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain
stem) and not in any of the other tissues analyzed (Figure 7E).
Importantly, TEM images demonstrated increased myelination
in the molecular layer of the cerebellum and within the brain
stem of cKO Ad-VGF-treated animals versus WT Ad-VGF- or
cKO Ad-control-treated mice, suggesting that increasing cere-
bellar myelination was critical for the survival of the sedentary
cKO mice (Figures 7F–7H). Notably, we did observe some addi-
tional, but non-significant myelination in Ad-VGF-injected WT
animals, but it was minimal compared to the rescued Ad-VGF-
treated sedentary cKO mice. Moreover, we observed a signifi-
cant increase in the number of NG2-BrdU and Olig2-BrdU
double-positive cells in the cerebella of Snf2h cKO mice treated
with Ad-VGF relative to all other treatments (Figures 7I and 7J).
This was also accompanied by increased levels of the VGF
propeptide in the plasma of cKO mice treated with Ad-VGF
and not with Ad-CT (Figure 7K).
DISCUSSION
Exercise induces the secretion of several hundred peptides from
skeletal muscle (myokines) that are known to exert autocrine,
paracrine, and endocrine effects on multiple tissues, including
the brain. Many of these myokines promote metabolic ho-
meostasis and, collectively provide protective effects against
obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative dis-
ease (Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012; Pedersen et al., 2009).
Given the dependence of exercise on the long-term survival of
Snf2h cKO mice, these systemic effects are key contributors to
the recovery of these mice. In this regard, many studies have
shown that exercise induces BDNF to promote neurogenesis,
and exercise mimetics such as AICAR analogs and metformin
similarly promote neurogenesis via BDNF (Dadwal et al., 2015;
Kobilo et al., 2011; van Praag et al., 1999a, 1999b, 2005; Wang
et al., 2012). However, within the cerebellum we did not observe
enhanced neurogenesis but rather increased oligodendrogene-
sis suggesting that the primary mechanism was distinct. More-
over, the comparative RNA-seq data indicated an upregulation
of VGF, a neuropeptide precursor that: (1) is similarly induced
by exercise within the hippocampus (Hunsberger et al., 2007);
(2) has widespread influences on energy metabolism, anti-
depressant effects, neurogenesis, and learning (Bartolomucci
et al., 2006; Hahm et al., 1999; Hunsberger et al., 2007; Thak-
ker-Varia et al., 2007, 2014); and (3) it is highly expressed in
OPs (Dugas et al., 2006). Indeed, we demonstrated that VGF
could induce oligodendrogenesis in vitro and that adenoviral
delivery of the full-length VGF precursor could significantly
rescue the survival of the Snf2h cKO mouse model and trigger
de novo myelination of cerebellar neurons to ameliorate motor
deficits and prolong their lifespan.
A key pending question is how does VGF impact the repair
process in the Snf2h cKO mice? It is known that exercise induces
VGF in the hippocampus and that this promotes the anti-depres-
sant effects caused by running (Hunsberger et al., 2007; Thakker-
Varia et al., 2007). It also functions in a positive feedback loop to
maintain BDNF expression (Hunsberger et al., 2007). Studies on
cultured hippocampal neurons have shown that VGF peptides
stimulate multiple signaling cascades to enhance synaptic
activity (Alder et al., 2003; Bozdagi et al., 2008). Thus, within the
cerebellum of the Snf2h cKO mice, the VGF peptides may serve
to maintain the survival of the existing neurons and concomi-
tantly, increase their synaptic activity, which would bolster
cerebellar-dependent motor function. Consistent with this hy-
pothesis, we observed increased expression of genes involved
in serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine synthesis, and
enhanced dendritic arborization of PCs. Whether this is a direct
or indirect effect of increased VGF expression requires further
validation. Other studies have shown that BDNF released from
astrocytes can also promote oligodendrogenesis (Miyamoto
et al., 2015). Surprisingly, we did not observe an effect of BDNF
on our in vitro OP cultures, although we did observe increased
BDNF levels in the brain following VGF adenoviral treatment of
the mice. While we cannot explain our in vitro results, our in vivo
data suggest that VGF may be able to stimulate astrocytes to
release BDNF and promote oligodendrogenesis indirectly.
Neuronal damage and neuronal loss results in the recruitment
of OPs and differentiation into OLs (Brousse et al., 2015; Piao
et al., 2015). Similarly, other studies have indicated that neuronal
activity stimulates myelination to strengthen active circuits
(Gibson et al., 2014). Importantly, demyelinated axons are elec-
trically active and can generate de novo synapses with recruited
OPs to facilitate OL differentiation and repair (Gautier et al.,
Figure 5. Voluntary Running Stimulates Synaptic Transmission and Growth Factor-Related Pathways
RNA-seq reveals the top 30 differentially expressed genes (DE) between cerebella from all genotypes after 15 days of running (wheels in at P25). Note the
upregulation of a high number of genes (in the WT-R versus cKO-R comparison, top right table) involved in neurotransmitter release and activity-dependent
synaptic transmission (cyan; e.g., TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; Slc6a3, dopamine transporter; Slc6a2, noradrenaline transporter; Slc6a4, serotonin transporter;
DBH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase; Slc5a7, choline transporter; Tph2, tryptophan hydroxylase; as well as upregulation of neuropeptides [yellow] and the nerve
growth factor-inducible gene VGF [green]). p < 0.05, n = 2 paired-end libraries per genotype. See also Data S1 for DE analyses between all four genotypes
(WT-Sedentary versus WT-Runner, cKO-Sedentary versus cKO-Runner, WT-Sedentary versus cKO-Sedentary, and WT-Runner versus cKO-Runner).

 2015). Indeed, myelin is the most effective means of speeding
conduction velocity by altering how electric potentials propa-
gate. Most recently, cultured OPs were shown to preferentially
myelinate electrically active axons, but OP-neuronal synap-
ses were not required for activity-dependent myelination. One
possible regulatory mechanism is through calcium signaling
produced by vesicular release of glutamate, cellular effects
that are also similarly mimicked by aerobic activity (Wake
et al., 2015). Because both OPs and neurons express VGF,
one possibility is that OPs and neurons utilize VGF peptides
as a secreted molecular tool to express their relative health or
activity to the other cell, in synapse-dependent and independent
manners. In this regard, reduced VGF is a biomarker for several
neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and Alzheimer’s
disease, and is also downregulated in human bipolar postmor-
tem brain tissue (Ferri et al., 2011; Pasinetti et al., 2006; Selle
et al., 2005; Thakker-Varia et al., 2010). Moreover, the TLQP-
21 peptide prevented apoptotic death of cerebellar granule
neurons and exogenous induction of VGF in a mouse model of
ALS attenuated excitotoxic injury, slowed disease progression,
and prolonged survival (Severini et al., 2008; Shimazawa et al.,
2010; Zhao et al., 2008). We demonstrated that VGF peptides
were capable of promoting OP proliferation and differentiation
into OLs using primary mouse OP cultures. While the mecha-
nism(s) remains to be elucidated, future studies using cell-
type-specific VGF cKO mice could shed light on whether VGF
peptides function as secreted vehicles that mediate OL-neuron
intercommunication to control activity-dependent synaptic re-
modeling and repair.
Inactivation of the Snf2h gene in the brain results in progres-
sive cerebellar degeneration and death during early adulthood.
Strikingly, voluntary running or intravenous full-length VGF de-
livery rescued the long-term survival of these animals (Fig-
ure 7L). Taken together, our results suggest that damaged
cerebellar neurons can be substantially rescued by increased
myelination, utilizing an endogenous mechanism of brain
repair. It is now clear that OPs are the largest population of
dividing cells in the adult brain, hence intrinsically implicated
in activity-dependent myelination of the postnatal brain. Addi-
tionally, white matter structure can change with environmental
experience and functional activity (Zatorre et al., 2012). In a
normally functioning cerebellum, additional myelination is not
as significant as in the pathological state, suggesting that
exercise promotes a repair mechanism that counteracts a
neurodegenerative process. How OP-neuron intercommunica-
tion changes during development in healthy and pathological
states and in response to environmental stimuli are current
areas of intense investigation. For the first time, our results
provide strong evidence that VGF has the ability to stimulate
OP proliferation, trigger myelination, revert neural damage,
and prolong lifespan in our chosen disease model. These
findings thereby illuminate a novel pathway to potentially treat
other neuronal and/or oligodendroglia-associated pathologies
of the CNS.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse Breeding
Snf2hfl/fl mice (Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2014) were backcrossed for six gener-
ations to a C57BL/6 or FVB/NCrl background and bred with a C57Bl/6 Nestin-
Cre�/+ heterozygous mice (Be
´ rube
´ et al., 2005) that also carried a Snf2h-null
allele (Stopka and Skoultchi, 2003), thereby generating Snf2h cKO mice by
Nestin-Cre (Snf2h�/fl::Nes-Cre�/+ or Snf2h cKO) and control littermates that
carried only one functional copy of Snf2h (Snf2h�/fl or Snf2h+/fl::Nes-Cre�/+)
or both functional alleles (Snf2h+/fl).
Behavioral Analysis
All behavioral tests were completed in the Behavior Core Facility at the Univer-
sity of Ottawa using standardized protocols. Animals were habituated to the
testing room at least �1 hr before testing. Behavioral assays were performed
irrespective of sex. One-way ANOVA was used for at least 10–20 mice per ge-
notype. The values are presented as the mean ± SEM.

 BrdU-Birthdating
BrdU was diluted in nanopure water at a final concentration of 2 g/L and sup-
plemented with 1% sucrose and protected from light. BrdU-containing water
was changed with fresh stock every other day. Mice were given BrdU 2 days
post-wheel introduction at P23 and allowed to drink freely for a maximum of
15 days (stopped at P40). Mice were then analyzed 50 days or 140 days
post-BrdU removal (P90 or P180).
TSA and EdU Administration
Mice were single-housed and a running wheel was introduced between P21
and P25. TSA was administered intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg at P30, and
EdU was administered intraperitoneally the following day for 3 consecutive
days at 100 mg/kg. Brains were analyzed at P40 and immunolabeled as
described below. Cell counts were performed with the indicated markers
from 1 mm2 3 100 mm3 confocal z stacks through the cerebellar lobes.
Immunofluorescent Histochemistry
Brain sections were obtained as 40–50 mm free-floating sections after cryo-
preservation. Sections were washed four times in PBS with 0.1% Triton
X-100 (PBST), blocked (1 hr, room temperature [RT]) in 10% horse serum/
PBST, and incubated (overnight, 4�C) in primary antibodies. Primary and sec-
ondary antibodies are listed in the Supplemental Information.
Reverse Transcription and Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Tissues were quickly dissected from mutant and control littermates and RNA
was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions and further concentrated with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kits (QIAGEN).
Glycogen (Ambion Life Technologies) was used as carrier. Total RNA (1 mg)
was reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen Life Technologies).
cDNA was further diluted 1:10 and 1 ml was used per qPCR reaction. qPCRs
were carried out using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). Student’s
t test was used for statistical significance.
Western Blotting
Protein samples were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gels under denaturing
conditions or using Bis-Tris 4%–12% gradient gels (NuPage, Invitrogen) and
blotted onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore) by wet transfer for
1–2 hr at 90 V. Membranes were blocked (45 min, room temperature) with
5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (TBST),
and incubated (4�C, overnight) with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-
VGF (1:1,000; a kind gift from Dr. Stephen Salton) or mouse anti-b-Actin
(1:30,000, Sigma). Western blots were quantitated using ImageJ software
(rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). At least three to five individual lanes from multiple litters
were used for quantitation.
Cell Culture
Primary mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were harvested
and propagated using an adaptation of the ‘‘shake-off’’ method originally
described by McCarthy and de Vellis (1980). In brief, neonatal mouse cortices
were dissociated and seeded onto poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated flasks and
grown as a mixed glial culture for 10 days. OPCs were then detached from
the mixed glial cell monolayer via orbital shaking, and the purified OPC popu-
lation was seeded onto poly-D-lysine, PLL, or laminin-coated coverslips and
differentiated for up to 6 days. For immunolabeling, OPCs were fixed with
3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and washed
in PBS (0.1 M). Cells were then permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton X-100 solu-
tion for 10 min at RT and subsequently washed in PBS. A 10% goat serum
blocking solution was then applied for 40 min, followed by an overnight
incubation (4�C) with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: myelin-
associated glycoprotein (1:100, EMD Millipore), NG2 chondroitin sulfate pro-
teoglycan (1:250, EMD Millipore), myelin basic protein (1:100, AbD Serotec),
VGF (1:100; a kind gift of Dr. Stephen R. Salton, Mount Sinai Medical School,
NY, USA), and chromagranin-B (1:100, Synaptic Systems #259103). For BrdU
incorporation, purified OPCs were pulsed with 20 nM BrdU and subsequently
fixed with 3% PFA, PBS washed, and permeabilized as described above. Prior
to immunostaining, the cells were treated with 2 N HCl for 20 min under
mild agitation. Neutralization was then achieved through addition of an
equal volume of basic 0.1 M Tris-HCL for 20 min. Samples were processed
for immunostaining as above, using an anti-BrdU antibody (1:200, Abcam
#ab6326).

introduced for voluntary running, Snf2h cKO show oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) expansion and extensive de novo myelination of otherwise dying Purkinje
neurons. This OPC expansion and de novo myelination can also be mimicked with adenoviral-mediated full-length VGF precursor protein delivery in the absence
of exercise. Upon running or VGF overexpression, ataxic Snf2h cKO mice show increased VGF protein in the plasma and brain, extensive myelination of damaged
cerebella, improved motor function, and a significant extension of their lifespan. VGF, nerve growth factor-inducible; P, postnatal; cyan cell, OPC; yellow cell,

 (Sigma-Aldrich, #B3795), or DMSO at 3 mM. Cells were then processed for
immunofluorescence as described above.
RNA-Sequencing and Bioinformatics
Tissues were quickly dissected from mutant and control littermates and
RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and further concentrated with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kits
(QIAGEN). Glycogen (Ambion Life Technologies) was used as carrier. We
pooled three independent cerebella as one sample per genotype and
sequenced two independent pools per genotype using Illumina HiSeq
2000 paired-end technology at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innova-
tion Center. Bioinformatics pipeline is described in the Supplemental
Information.
Adenoviral Construction and Delivery
A plasmid containing the murine VGF cDNA (a kind gift of Stephen Salton,
Mount Sinai School of Medicine), was digested with HindIII, the ends re-
paired with T4 DNA polymerase, digested with NotI, and the fragment
cloned into EcoRV/NotI digested pRP2645 (Poulin et al., 2010), generating
pRP3137. As such, in pRP3137 full-length murine VGF was placed under
regulation of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/pro-
moter and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. The expres-
sion cassette contained in pRP3137 was cloned into an adenovirus type 5
genomic plasmid, pRP2014 (Poulin et al., 2010), using RecA-mediated bac-
terial recombination, generating pRP3140 (Chartier et al., 1996; Ross and
Parks, 2009). pRP3140 was transfected into HEK293 cells and then propa-
gated and purified using standard techniques (Ross and Parks, 2009).
Thus, AdRP3140 is an early region 1 (E1)/E3-deleted Ad vector containing
the mVGF under regulation by the human CMV promoter and BGHpA. An
empty adenoviral construct was used as control. Mice were given a single
dose via tail injection of 1 3 1012 viral particles per kilogram (VP/kg) diluted
in a 100-mL final volume. At least 10–15 mice were injected per genotype per
condition.
Image Acquisition and Processing
Tissue sections were examined and images captured using a Zeiss 510 laser
scanning confocal microscope with UV (405 nm), argon (488 nm), helium/neon
(546 nm), and helium/neon (633 nm) lasers. All images were acquired as 30 mm
z stacks (in 1- to 2-mm intervals) and analyzed as projections using the LSM
510 Image Browser software (Zeiss). Images were exported to Adobe
Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems) and further processed for contrast when
necessary.
Toluidine Blue Staining
Semi-thin sections of 0.5 mm were stained with 1% toluidine blue and 2%
Borate in distilled water. Histological samples were scanned with a MIRAX
MIDI automated scanning light microscope (Zeiss) and images processed
with Zeiss MIRAX Viewer software (Zeiss).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Cerebella vermis, deep cerebellar nuclei, brain stem, and inferior olive brain
regions were collected under a stereomicroscope, cut into sections of 1- to
2-mm thickness and fixed for at least 4 hr to overnight in Karnovsky’s fixative
(4% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1 M cacodylate in PBS
[pH 7.4]) at 4�C. Grids were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and
with Reynold’s lead citrate. Sections were observed under a transmission
electron microscope (TEM) (Hitachi 7100). All ultrastructural analysis were
based on at least three mice per genotype of the same age for each group
examined.
Statistics
Group statistical analysis was performed via a two-tailed Student’s t test or
one-way ANOVA where indicated; p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically sig-
nificant. At least three mice from each genotype were used for evaluation. The
values are presented as the mean ± SEM. For BrdU or EdU cell counting in
the cerebellar lobes and brain stem, three 1-mm2 regions in 100 mm3 cubic
z stacks were counted per animal, n = 4 mice per genotype.
