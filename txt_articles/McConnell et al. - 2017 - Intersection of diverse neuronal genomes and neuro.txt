BACKGROUND: Elucidating the genetic archi-
tecture of neuropsychiatric disorders remains
a major scientific and medical challenge.
Emerging genomic technologies now permit
the analysis of somatic mosaicism in human
tissues. The measured frequencies of
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small
insertion/deletion (indel) mutations, struc-
tural variants [including copy number
variants (CNVs), inversions, transloca-
tions, and whole-chromosome gains or
losses], and mobile genetic element in-
sertions (MEIs) indicate that each neu-
ron may harbor hundreds of somatic
mutations. Given the long life span of
neurons and their central role in neural
circuits and behavior, somatic mosa-
icism represents a potential mechanism
that may contribute to neuronal diver-
sity and the etiology of numerous neu-
ropsychiatric disorders.
ADVANCES: Somatic mutations that
confer cellular proliferative or cellular
survival phenotypes have been identi-
fied in patients with cortical malfor-
mations. These data have led to the
hypothesis that somatic mutations may
also confer phenotypes to subsets of
neurons, which could increase the risk
of developing certain neuropsychiatric
disorders. Genomic technologies, including
advances in long-read, next-generation DNA
sequencing technologies, single-cell genomics,
and cutting-edge bioinformatics, can now
make it possible to determine the types and
frequencies of somatic mutations within the
human brain. However, a comprehensive un-
derstanding of the contribution of somatic
mosaicism to neurotypical brain development
and neuropsychiatric disease requires a co-
ordinated, multi-institutional effort.
The National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) has formed a network of 18 investi-
gative teams representing 15 institutions called
the Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network (BSMN).
Each research team will use an array of genomic
technologies to exploit well-curated human
tissue repositories in an effort to define the
frequency and pattern of somatic mutations in
neurotypical individuals and in schizophrenia,
autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder,
Tourette syndrome, and epilepsy patient pop-
ulations. Collectively, these efforts are estimated
to generate a community resource of more than
10,000 DNA-sequencing data sets and will enable
a cross-platform integrated analysis with other
NIMH initiatives, such as the PsychENCODE
project and the CommonMind Consortium.
OUTLOOK: A fundamental open question in
neurodevelopmental genetics is whether and
how somatic mosaicism may contribute to
neuronal diversity within the neurotypical spec-
trum and in diseased brains. Healthy individ-
uals may harbor known pathogenic somatic
mutations at subclinical frequencies, and
the local composition of
neural cell types may be
altered by mutations con-
ferring prosurvival phe-
notypes in subsets of
neurons. By extension,
the neurotypical archi-
tecture of somatic mutations may confer
circuit-level differences that would not be
present if every neuron had an identical
genome. Given the apparent abundance of
somatic mutations within neurons, an in-
depth understanding of how different types
of somatic mosaicism affect neural function
could yield mechanistic insight into the eti-
ology of neurodevelopmental and neuropsy-
chiatric disorders.
The BSMN will examine large col-
lections of postmortem brain tissue
from neurotypical individuals and
patients with neuropsychiatric dis-
orders. By sequencing brain DNA and
single neuronal genomes directly, ra-
ther than genomic DNA derived from
peripheral blood or other somatic
tissues, the BSMN will test the hy-
pothesis that brain somatic variants
contribute to neuropsychiatric dis-
ease. Notably, it is also possible that
some inherited germline variants con-
fer susceptibility to disease, which
is later exacerbated by somatic muta-
tions. Confirming such a scenario could
increase our understanding of the ge-
netic risk architecture of neuropsy-
chiatric disease and may, in part,
explain discordant neuropsychiatric
phenotypes between identical twins.
Results from these studies may lead
to the discovery of biomarkers and
genetic targets to improve the treat-
ment of neuropsychiatric disease and
may offer hope for improving the lives of
patients and their families.▪

Collectively, somatic SNVs, indels, structural variants (e.g.,
CNVs), and MEIs (e.g., L1 retrotransposition events) shape
the genomic landscape of individual neurons. The Brain Soma-
tic Mosaicism Network aims to systematically generate pioneer-
ing data on the types and frequencies of brain somatic mutations
in both neurotypical individuals and those with neuropsychiatric dis-
ease.The resulting data will be shared as a large community resource.

Neuropsychiatric disorders have a complex genetic architecture. Human genetic population-
based studies have identified numerous heritable sequence and structural genomic variants
associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease. However,these germline variants do
not fully account for disease risk. During brain development, progenitor cells undergo billions of
cell divisions to generate the ~80 billion neurons in the brain.The failure to accurately repair
DNA damage arising during replication, transcription, and cellular metabolism amid this
dramatic cellular expansion can lead to somatic mutations. Somatic mutations that alter
subsets of neuronal transcriptomes and proteomes can, in turn, affect cell proliferation and
survival and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.The long life span of individual neurons and
the direct relationship between neural circuits and behavior suggest that somatic mutations in
small populations of neurons can significantly affect individual neurodevelopment.The Brain
Somatic Mosaicism Network has been founded to study somatic mosaicism both in
neurotypical human brains and in the context of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.
T
he human body reaches a steady-state level
of approximately 1014 cells in adulthood.
Because DNA replication and DNA repair
are imperfect processes (estimated at ~0.27
to 0.99 errors in ~109 nucleotides per cell
division) (1), somatic cells within an individual
must differ in the presence of single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs) and/or small insertion/deletion
(indel) mutations (2–4). In addition to SNVs
and indels (5), subsets of neurons also harbor
structural variants [which include large (>1 Mb)
copy number variants (CNVs), inversions, trans-
locations, and whole-chromosome gains or losses
(6–10)] and smaller mobile genetic element in-
sertions (MEIs) (11–16). Here, we define somatic
mosaicism as the existence of different genomes
within the cells of a monozygotic individual. Well-
known examples of somatic mosaicism include
ichthyosis with confetti and lines of Blaschko (4).
Healthy neuronal development requires that
neural stem cells and progenitor cells (NPCs)
undergo tens of billions of cell divisions, both
before birth and during the first years of life, to
generate the ~80 billion neurons in the fully
developed human brain (17). Because neurons
are among the longest-lived cells in the body, the
accumulation of somatic mutations (i.e., SNVs,
indels, structural variants, and MEIs) within NPCs,
or perhaps postmitotic neurons (18), could influ-
ence neuronal development, complexity, and func-
tion (19, 20). Indeed, mounting evidence indicates
that somatic mutations in small populations of
neurons contribute to various neurodevelopmental
disorders (Table 1).
Genomic studies implicitly assume that every
cell within an individual has the same genome.
Family-based genetic studies, genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS), and exome sequencing
analyses have identified numerous common, rare,
and de novo germline SNVs and CNVs associated
with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD),schizophrenia,andbipolardisorder,buteach
variant only represents a minor component of
population-level disease risk (21–24). In general,
these approaches sequence the DNA from avail-
able clinical samples (e.g., peripheral blood) to in-
terrogate an individual’s germline genome; they
do not account for any additional disease risk
brought about by somatic mutations that occur
duringbraindevelopment.Toaddressthisknowl-
edge gap, the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) supportedthe formation of the Brain So-
matic Mosaicism Network (BSMN). Notably, sev-
eral outstanding reviews have recently discussed
how somatic mutations within the brain may con-
tribute to neurological disease [e.g., (2, 25, 26)].
Here, we buildonthese discussions and highlight
howsomaticmutationswithinthebrainmaycon-
tribute to neuronal diversity. We also evaluate
emerging genomic approaches to measure and
validate somatic mosaicism and summarize BSMN
efforts to generate a large publicly available re-
source to evaluate the contribution of somatic mo-
saicism to neuropsychiatric disease (Fig. 1).

 Mechanisms of somatic mosaicism
DNA damage occurs constantly in every cell in
our bodies, and many components of the DNA
damage response are essential for neurodevel-
opment. Single-strand and double-strand DNA
breaks, as well as base mutations, arise as a
consequence of DNA replication, transcription,
epigenetic modification, cellular respiration, and
environmental stressors. If the resultant damage
is not accurately repaired, DNA mutations can
occur that can lead to somatic variation among
neurons and other cell types.
The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) path-
way of DNA repair is required for neurodevelop-
ment. Mice deficient in NHEJ proteins exhibit
extensive NPC apoptosis and often die prenatally
(27). Intriguingly, the embryonic lethality and
NPC apoptosis phenotypes are rescued in a p53-
null mouse background, suggesting that genotoxic
stress contributes to lethality (28). Consistent with
these data, compound heterozygous mutations in
DNA damage response genes [e.g., ataxia telan-
giectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia-
related (ATR), and ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP)]
can lead to increased mutational loads, neuro-
developmental brain defects, and neuronal de-
generation (29–31). More broadly, deficits in other
DNA repair pathways, such as transcription-
coupled repair, homologous recombination, and
nucleotide excision repair, also can lead to hu-
man neurodevelopmental phenotypes (32, 33).
Defects in different DNA repair pathways are
associated with distinct somatic mutation profiles.
For example, SNVs and indels can arise from
errors during base excision repair, nucleotide
excision repair, and transcription-coupled repair
(33). Moreover, the action of the apolipoprotein
B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-
like-3 (APOBEC3) family of cytosine deaminase
proteins can lead to cytidine-to-uridine transition
mutations on single-strand DNA that, upon rep-
lication, lead to guanosine-to-adenosine muta-
tions on the opposing DNA strand (34). Errors
made during DNA mismatch repair also can lead
to either interspersed SNVs or indels within mi-
crosatellite repeat sequences, whereas errors made
during double-strand break repair by homolo-
gous recombination, NHEJ, or alternative-NHEJ
can lead to CNVs (35, 36).
Errors incurred during DNA replication or
transcription also can lead to the formation of
CNVs. Large, actively transcribed genes that un-
dergo replication during late S-phase correspond
to chromosomal fragile sites and are hot spots
for the generation of genomic variants and trans-
locations (37, 38). Because neuronal genes are
overrepresented among the longest genes in the
human genome, transcription may predispose
these genes to somatic CNVs (39). Indeed, in-
tragenic deletions within large, neuronally ex-
pressed genes (e.g., AUTS2, IMMP2L, NXRN1, and
CNTNAP2) are associated with ASD, intellectual
disability, and other neurodevelopmental disor-
ders (40, 41). Thus, if individuals harbor somatic
CNVs at these loci in many neurons or in neu-
rons within specific functional brain regions, they
may be susceptible to neurological disease.
Long interspersed element-1s (LINE-1s or L1s)
can mobilize (i.e., retrotranspose) within the brain,
leading to another form of somatic variation
(42). Active L1s encode two proteins, ORF1p and
ORF2p, which are required for retrotransposition.
ORF2p contains endonuclease and reverse tran-
scriptase activities that are needed to “copy-and-
paste” L1 sequences into a new genomic location
by a mechanism termed target-site primed reverse
transcription(TPRT)(42, 43).Inadditiontocanon-
ical TPRT, L1s occasionally can integrate into
endogenous DNA lesions (44). Moreover, recom-
bination events that arise either during (15, 45–47)
or after L1 retrotransposition (48) can lead to the
formation of structural variants.

Box 1. Criteria used to prioritize somatic variants for functional characterization.
Absence from the germ line
We will focus on variants with a definitive somatic origin.
Recurrence and frequency of somatic variation at the locus of interest
We will prioritize loci at which somatic variations, across all types, recur in multiple disease
samples but not in control samples.
Mutation severity
Highly deleterious variations will be prioritized for likely functional importance.
Intersection with known disease loci and biochemical pathways
Taking advantage of data on germline variations in brain disorders, we will prioritize loci
that have been previously implicated in disease.
Intersection with brain expression and epigenomic data
Taking advantage of large, publicly funded consortia of human brain spatiatemporal
expression data (e.g., BrainSpan) and epigenomic data (e.g., PsychENCODE and
Roadmap Epigenomics), we will select genes that are expressed in brain regions associated
with brain disorders and noncoding loci with potential regulatory function.

 this disorder remained a medical mystery. Genetic
studies of the most severe form of focal dysplasia,
hemimegalencephaly, in which one entire cere-
bral hemisphere is enlarged in size, led to the
identification of gain-of-function somatic muta-
tions in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)–
protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways (Table 1,
Fig. 2). We now know that mutations in mTOR
are the single largest contributor to focal dyspla-
sia in pediatric epilepsy (49–51). Similarly, germ-
line mutations in one allele of the TSC1 or TSC2
gene confer susceptibility to tuberous sclerosis, a
disease characterized by facial and skin lesions,
seizures, intellectual disability, cardiac and renal
tumors, and cortical tubers (52). Because the Tsc1
and Tsc2 proteins are negative regulators of the
mTOR-signaling pathway, a second somatically
acquired mutation is required for disease onset.
Somatic mutations that mildly activate the mTOR-
signaling pathway also cause symmetrical over-
growth syndromes such as megalencephaly-capillary
malformation syndrome, megalencephaly, and
certain forms of polymicrogyria (49–51). Com-
mon to all of these phenotypes is the presence of
hypertrophic neural-like “balloon” cells, which
carry the somatic mutation yet fail to transform to
a malignant cell type (52).
Somatic mutations that inappropriately acti-
vate Ras signaling or related signaling pathways
can likewise confer proliferation and survival phe-
notypes to subsets of cells and cause neurological
disease. For example, a gain-of-function somatic
mutation in GNAQ, encoding G protein subunit
alpha q, can lead to Sturge-Weber syndrome, a
disease characterized by vascular anomaly in the
brain, glaucoma, seizures, stroke, and intellectual
disability (53). The same GNAQ mutation, occur-
ring in a different somatic cell type later in de-
velopment, can cause uveal melanoma (54). Because
mutations in certain neurodevelopmental dis-
orders (e.g., neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclero-
sis, Proteus syndrome, and other neurocutaneous
disorders) either activate proto-oncogenes or in-
activate tumor suppressor genes, it is not sur-
prising that similar mutations in non-neuronal
cell types manifest as cancers. Intriguingly, post-
mitotic neurons are rarely the source of brain
tumors, suggesting that postmitotic neurons may
have safeguards that ensure against dediffer-
entiation and further proliferation.
Relative to germline mutations, somatic mu-
tations can lead to milder cases of heritable neu-
rodevelopmental disorders. For example, somatic
mutations in genes involved in neuronal migra-
tion are estimated to represent 5 to 10% of de novo
mutations and are detected more frequently in
patients with unexplained brain malformations
when studied with sensitive high-throughput se-
quencing methods (55). Moreover, somatic muta-
tions within the LIS1 or DCX genes can lead to
gross disruptions of neuronal migration, whereas
germline mutations in LIS1 or DCX result in
lissencephaly (56, 57). Results from several ex-
periments also suggest that somatic mutations
that lead to a reduction of gene copy number in
migrating neurons can lead to cell-autonomous
defects in neuronal migration, with severe epilepsy
and intellectual disability as a consequence (56, 57).
ASD and other common
neuropsychiatric diseases
Genetic approaches have not yet fully explained
the etiology of ASD, bipolar disorder, schizo-
phrenia, or Tourette syndrome. Although gene-
by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions
could, in principle, account for additional dis-
ease risk, somatic mosaicism is another potential
mechanism that warrants exploration as a con-
tributor to neuropsychiatric diseases (58).
De novo SNVs and CNVs, particularly loss-of-
function mutations, are significant contributors
to ASD risk (21, 59–62). In addition to de novo
germline mutations, a substantial number of de
novo somatic mutations (i.e., ~5.4% of de novo
events) are detected in the blood of ASD patients
and are enriched in ASD probands (22). Somatic
mosaic mutations also have been identified
throughout postmortem ASD brains or, in some
instances, in more localized areas in ASD brains
(59). Evidence of continuous, widespread corti-
cal mismigration, as seen in some mutant mice,
has not been reported in the postmortem ASD
brain (63, 64). However, NPCs from a subset of
ASD patients with enlarged brain volumes are
inherently more proliferative and display abnor-
mal neurogenesis when compared to controls
(65, 66). Other ASD patients have focal cortical
abnormalities, including disorganized neurons
and lamina, polymicrogyria, and other local sur-
face malformations (67). Thus, in addition to spe-
cific mutations, additional cell cycles may further
affect somatic mutational loads in patients.
Prenatal challenges to the immune system in
animals (i.e., maternal immune activation) (68)
can also lead to many features like those present
in ASD brains. Maternal immune activation leads
to increased cellular proliferation, brain size, and
ASD-like behaviors in animal models (69–72).
Intriguingly, an elevated prevalence of MEIs was
observed in a primate model of maternal immune
activation (73). Elevated MEI levels likewise are
observed in schizophrenia (73) and Rett syndrome
patients (74), suggesting that somatic MEI burden
may play a role in the etiology of some neuro-
developmental and neuropsychiatric diseases.
Methods to detect somatic mutations
The difficulty in detecting a somatic mutation
depends on its frequency within a cell population.

tissue from large cohorts of neurotypical individuals and neuropsychiatric disease patients. The methods include bulk sequencing of tissues or sorted
neurons (top), sequencing of single cells after whole-genome amplification (middle), or clonal expansion from single cells followed by bulk sequencing
(bottom). Each method offers a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

 Whereas mutations affecting a large fraction
(e.g., 50%) of cells are readily detected in bulk
tissue sequencing experiments and generally re-
sult in high-confidence calls, mutations affect-
ing one or a few cells are unlikely to be detected
with bulk tissue sequencing approaches. The iden-
tification and validation of rare somatic mutations
requires sequencing DNA derived from small
pools of cells, single cells, or clonally repro-
grammed cells followed by robust computational
data analyses (Fig. 1).
Bulk tissue approaches
Whole-genomesequencing(WGS)or whole-exome
sequencing (WES) of DNA derived from bulk brain
tissue allows a straightforward approach to dis-
covering somatic mosaicism (26). WGS and WES
minimize sequencing artifacts that can confound
downstream analyses and, in the case of WGS,
provide an opportunity for identifying a wide
range of structural rearrangements, including
inversions and translocations. However, WGS
and WES using standard sequencing depths have
reduced statistical power to detect mutations
that occur at low frequencies (i.e., <10% of cells in
a population at 30 to 100x coverage). Although
increasing sequence coverage allows detection of
somatic variants at lower frequencies, it quickly
becomes cost prohibitive. Moreover, WGS and
WES do not provide information on how somatic
variants are distributed across individual cell lin-
eages within a bulk tissue sample.
Sorted-pools approaches
Fluorescence-activated cell or nuclei sorting (FACS/
FANS) can be used to isolate specific neural pop-
ulations (e.g., NeuN+ neurons versus NeuN– cells
or cortical inhibitory interneurons versus excit-
atory principal neurons). Analysis of sorted nu-
clei populations (e.g., 5000 or 500,000 cells) from
specific brain regions increases the power to de-
tect somatic mosaicism that arises in one lineage,
because these genomes are no longer diluted by
genomes derivedfrom otherlineages. Independent
pools of sorted nuclei can then be subjected to
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative re-
verse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) to confirm cell type–specific gene ex-
pression profiles (75). In addition to increasing
the power for detecting a somatic mutation, cell
sorting before DNA extraction could yield infor-
mation about the embryological origin and de-
velopmental trajectory of somatic variation across
the brain. Large pools of sorted cells can yield
enough DNA for the direct examination of somatic
variants by WGS or WES. However, smaller pool
sizes will only generate small amounts of DNA;
thus, they are best suited for generating PCR
amplicon libraries (e.g., as used in MEI detection
and other targeted sequencing) or for subsequent
whole-genome amplification (WGA).
Single-cell approaches
WGA can be used to analyze the genomes of
single neurons (26). The spectrum of mutations
identified from the genomes of single neurons
can then be compared to germline variants in
bulk tissue data derived from a non-neuronal
control (e.g., brain dural fibroblasts or heart) to
identify candidate somatic mutations (5). WGA
approaches already are used in pre-implantation
genetic screening of embryos (76, 77) and include
(i) degenerate-oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-
PCR), (ii) multiple displacement amplification
(MDA), and (iii) multiple annealing and looping-
based amplification (MALBAC). Each method
has its advantages and drawbacks. In general,
DOP-PCR provides coverage evenly across the
genome, which facilitates the detection of large
CNVs and chromosomal aneuploidies. However,
DOP-PCR has a higher read duplication rate, lower
mapping rate, and lower recovery rate when
compared with MDA and MALBAC (78) and is
cost prohibitive for SNV, indel, and MEI detec-
tion. By comparison, MDA yields a high rate of
artificial chimeric DNA molecules that can lead
to false-positive calls in downstream analyses
(79), whereas MALBAC exhibits reduced coverage
of certain genomic regions (14, 16, 80), especially
those rich in repetitive sequences (78). Consider-
able advances have recently been made in detect-
ing SNVs (81, 82), CNVs (83), and MEIs (16) in
WGA samples; however, best practices necessi-
tate evaluating each WGA approach for the de-
tection of specific types of somatic mosaicism.
Clonal expansion of single cells using human-
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology
or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) provides
a biological alternative to WGA (80, 84). Any
variant uniformly identified in the clonal line,
but not in controls, represents a candidate so-
matic mutation that requires confirmation in the
tissue of origin. In contrast, mutations introduced
during cell culture will be present in a lower
frequency of cells within a clonal cell line and
can be discriminated from bona fide somatic
mutations in downstream computational analy-
sis. Although the clonal isolation and expansion
of primary human neural stem and progenitor
cells is possible, the analysis of human neuronal
genomes using clonal reprogramming has several
limitations. Foremost among these is the avail-
ability of live human neurons. Moreover, neither
clonal reprogramming nor SCNT have been re-
ported using human neurons; SCNT is further
limited by the expense and availability of human
oocytes. Finally, reprogramming approaches cur-
rently are only successful in ~10% of cells; thus,
any neurons harboring highly aberrant genomes
may be refractory to reprogramming. Despite these
caveats, clonal reprogramming of human neurons
is theoretically possible. In addition, it is note-
worthy that mouse neurons reprogrammed by
SCNT contain genomic rearrangements (e.g.,
kataegis and chromothripsis) that would be very
challenging to validate using current WGA ap-
proaches (84).
Computational methods for
mutation detection
WGS and WES have been used successfully to
detect somatic SNVs in family-based studies
of Mendelian disease and large-scale sequencing
studies of human patient cohorts (2). To identify
SNVs, most computational approaches compare
call sets generated from an affected sample to
those generated from a matched healthy/unaffected
sample and/or a control population. These com-
parisons allow the identification and subsequent
exclusion of germline polymorphisms from down-
stream analyses; however, care must be taken to

 ensure that any candidate somatic mutations are
not germline variants that were missed in the
matched control. In general, variant callers ini-
tially developed to detect mutations in cancer
offer higher sensitivity for detecting mosaic
SNVs when compared with standard approaches
used to detect germline variants (85, 86).
Somatic CNVs can be detected by identify-
ing deviations either from the expected depth
of sequence or in the expected distances be-
tween paired-end sequencing reads. Similarly,
inversions can be identified through differences
in the orientations of paired-end sequencing reads.
Numerous approaches have been developed to
identify CNVs from WGS (7, 87–89), and most can
be applied directly to identify somatic mutations.
For example, recent studies using WGA in con-
junction with WGS have identified megabase-scale
de novo CNVs in human and mouse neurons
based on differences in read-depth across genomic
bins (6–9). CNVs are more difficult to identify
using WES due to the biases encountered during
the capture of target exons (90).
Somatic MEIs can be detected from bulk tis-
sue, PCR amplicons generated from sorted-cell
fractions, or single-cell WGA DNA using split-read
and paired-end information (e.g., one paired-end
read may map to the reference genome, whereas
another may map to a MEI) (91, 92). Detecting
low-frequency MEIs with fewer supporting reads
requires careful bioinformatic analyses that can
distinguish signal from noise, followed by ex-
perimental validation with orthogonal methods
(14, 93). The analysis of single-cell data remains
challenging due to the presence of chimeras gen-
erated during WGA (14, 16, 94); thus, care must
be taken in calling MEIs.
Validation of somatic mutations
It is essential to validate all candidate somatic
mutations. False-positive calls can arise from DNA
sequencing errors, contamination with germline
variants, chimeric molecules generated during
single-cell WGA, PCR-induced nucleotide sub-
stitutions, and the failure to amplify certain ge-
nomic regions. False-negative calls are dependent
on the allele frequency of the somatic mutation
within the sample, the type of mutation, and the
method of detection. Orthologous experimental
methods are required to eliminate false-positives
and to calibrate the confidence of detection for
different types of somatic mutations. Validation
experiments can then be performed on either the
tissue of origin or amplified material used to dis-
cover the variant. The first approach represents a
biological validation, which establishes the pres-
ence of a variant call in unamplified DNA from
the source sample. The second approach repre-
sents a technical validation, which establishes
the presence/absence of variant calls in the DNA
source material used for discovery.
Biological/primary validation in the
tissue of origin
Validation on unamplified DNA from the tissue
of origin provides confirmation that a candidate
call is a genuine somatic variant and rules out
the possibility that it corresponds to a DNA am-
plification artifact or a mutation that occurred
during clonal expansion. Biological validation re-
quires a variant to be present in multiple cells in
the tissue of origin at a frequency above experi-
mental detection limits. As such, the failure to
validate a variant in the tissue of origin does not
necessarily represent a false call. For example,
only ~50% of CNVs manifested in hiPSC clones
could be directly confirmed in the primary fibro-
blast cells used to derive hiPSCs (80).
Somatic variants can be confirmed in unam-
plified cell source material by (i) targeted DNA
capture followed by high-coverage (>100x) DNA
resequencing, (ii) high-coverage sequencing of
multiplexed PCR amplicons, and (iii) droplet dig-
ital PCR (ddPCR). These approaches vary in
throughput and sensitivity. Targeted DNA cap-
ture and resequencing can require the creation
of several thousand custom oligonucleotides de-
signed to capture the genomic DNA either includ-
ing or surrounding the putative variants. The
captured DNA then is subjected to high-coverage
paired-end DNA sequencing, yielding a typical
sensitivity of variant detection in greater than
1% of cells. Amplicon sequencing involves PCR
amplification of candidate loci followed by high-
coverage paired-end DNA sequencing, yielding
a typical sensitivity of variant detection in greater
than 0.1% of cells. Finally, ddPCR involves par-
titioning a DNA sample into large numbers of
individual droplets that generally contain one
copy of template DNA. PCR takes place within
these droplets, leading to the production of a
fluorescent readout, either through the use of an
intercalating dye or a fluorescent oligomer probe,
to indicate the presence or absence of the PCR
target of interest. Subsequent quantification of
the fluorescent droplets allows a determination
of the number of copies of the target locus present
in the sample, yielding a typical sensitivity of
variant detection in greater than 0.001% of cells
(95). Although extremely sensitive, ddPCR requires
the optimization of primers, probes, and am-
plification conditions, which is time-consuming
and limits throughput.
The goal when employing biological valida-
tion procedures is to detect putative somatic
variants and to assess, as precisely as possible,
the frequency of each variant in that tissue of
origin. Biological validation can (i) determine
whether certain individuals in the population
are more prone to somatic variation than others,
(ii) investigate whether different areas of the brain
and/or specific brain cell types have varying
amounts and types of particular forms of somatic
variation, (iii) assess whether developmental
timing contributes to somatic variation, and (iv)
reveal whether somatic variations increase as a
function of the number of cell divisions and/or
a function of age in postmitotic neurons.
Technical validation on
source/amplified material
If a somatic variant is only present in a single cell,
it will be impossible to validate in bulk tissue.
Likewise, a variant present in very few cells may
be difficult to validate in the tissue of origin. Thus,
technical validation in the source DNA used to dis-
cover a putative variant can be used to determine
whether a call is true or false. Technical validation
typically employs PCR, qPCR, and Sanger sequenc-
ing of the locus in the DNA source material (e.g.,
WGA DNA or DNA from a clonal cell population).
Multiple true/false verdicts form the basis for
estimating false-discovery and false-negative rates
in the resultant call sets.
Present understanding of the
prevalence of somatic mutation in
neurotypical individuals
Recent studies revealed that mosaic neuronal
genomes are the rule, rather than the exception;
every neuron probably has a different genome
than the neurons with which it forms synapses.
Not unexpectedly, SNVs are the most prevalent
somatic mutations. A “triple calling” strategy was
used to identify and validate clonal SNVs in

 MDA-amplified DNA from single neurons iso-
lated from a neurotypical brain, leading to es-
timates of ~1000 to 1500 SNVs per neuronal
genome (5). By comparison to human cortical
neurons, a SCNT experiment in reprogrammed
mouse olfactory neurons detected hundreds of
SNVs per neuron and a lower proportion of C-to-T
transition mutations (84). Although the divergent
SNV rates between these two studies may arise
from technical differences (as discussed above),
both approaches establish that SNVs represent
an important form of somatic mutation in both
human and mouse neurons.
Brain somatic CNVs initially were identified
by comparing the sequences of bulk DNA derived
from multicellular samples of different brain re-
gions to the sequences of DNA derived from so-
matic tissues (96, 97). The first single-cell study
of neuronal CNVs analyzed 110 human frontal
cortex neurons and found that 13 to 41% of the
neurons contained at least one megabase-scale
de novo CNV (6). Additional studies, which an-
alyzed fewer neuronal genomes, confirmed that
de novo CNVs occur in at least 10% of neurons
(7, 8). CNVs can be shared by multiple neurons
and inherited in a clonal manner (8). Further-
more, megabase-scale CNVs typically alter the
copy number of 10 or more genes in individual
neurons. In addition to expression-level differ-
ences that can accompany gene copy number
changes, mosaic neuronal CNVs also are expected
to reveal or abate pernicious alleles on a neuron-
by-neuron basis in every individual.
L1 retrotransposon insertions alter the tran-
scriptional regulation of genes in myriad ways
(42). Initial studies used engineered L1s containing
a retrotransposition indicator cassette to discover
MEI activity in mouse brain (98) and in human
NPCs in vitro (99). Studies of MDA-amplified
NeuN-positive nuclei isolated from a neuro-
typical human brain, followed by L1-transposon
profiling (13) or WGS (15, 16), have since suggested
that 0.2 to 1 L1 insertion occur per neuronal
genome. Another report, which employed MALBAC
WGA in conjunction with L1 capture technology
(RC-seq), reported an average of 13 L1 insertions
in every neuronal genome (11), although a sub-
sequent study suggested a high false-positive rate
in these data (14). By comparison, SCNT experi-
ments in mouse olfactory neurons reported ≤1.3
MEI per neuronal genome (84). An extrapolation
of these data indicates that potentially billions
of neurons in the neurotypical brain contain
de novo MEIs. Additional studies are required
to determine whether L1s retrotranspose at vary-
ing rates in different brain regions, in different
individuals, or preferentially insert into expressed
genes, and whether other mobile elements [e.g.,
Alu retrotransposons (42)] also contribute to intra-
individual neuronal genetic diversity.
Generation of a community resource
The BSMN will generate comprehensive maps of
somatic genomic variation in neurotypical and
diseased human brains, including a prioritized
call set of confirmed somatic variants (Box 1) that
may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease and
epilepsy. Functional validation experiments will
beperformedusingCRISPR/Cas9-mediatedgenome
engineering, hiPSC-based neurogenesis, and mosaic
mouse models generated by in utero electropora-
tion (Fig. 3). The BSMN is initially determining
concordance among disparate sequencing and
bioinformatic approaches by performing a “com-
mon experiment” in which pulverized tissue from
one neurotypical individual in the Lieber brain
repository has been distributed to all of the
working groups for independent assessment of
mosaicism.
The BSMN will generate an estimated 10,000
sequencing data sets that comprise >600 terabytes
of data and facilitate data-sharing through the
BSMN Knowledge Portal (www.synapse.org/bsmn)
and the NIMH Data Archive (https://data-archive.
nimh.nih.gov). Coordinated analyses with data
derived from some of the same brain samples
by the CommonMind (www.synapse.org/cmc) and
PsychENCODE (www.synapse.org/pec) initiatives
may elucidate the effect of somatic mosaicism
on tissue-wide gene expression. Data generated
though the BSMN initiative will be released to
the broader research community on an ongoing
basis through a controlled-access mechanism that
follows NIH policies and regulatory requirements.
