We aimed to quantify the inertial parameters of the lower trunk segment in pregnant Japanese women
and compare kinetic data during tasks calculated with parameters estimated in this study to data
calculated with standard parameters. Eight pregnant women and seven nulliparous women participated.
Twenty-four infrared reflective markers were attached to the lower trunk, and the standing position was
captured by eight infrared cameras. The lower trunk was divided into parts, and inertial parameters were
calculated. Pregnant women performed a movement task that involved standing from a chair, picking up
plates, and walking forward after turning to the right. Kinetic analysis was performed using standard
inertial parameters and the newly calculated parameters. There were more significant differences be-
tween methods in the kinetic data at the latter stages of pregnancy. The inertial parameters calculated in
this study should be used to ensure the validity of biomechanical studies of pregnant Japanese women.

1. Introduction
The abdomen increases in mass and volume during pregnancy,
causing changes in physical function. The center of mass (COM)
location shifts and the alignment of the spine exhibits compensa-
tory changes (Franklin and Conner-Kerr, 1998; Gaymer et al., 2009;
Ostgaard et al., 1993). These changes in alignment differ between
individuals (Gilleard et al., 2002) and can affect the musculoskeletal
and postural control systems (Nagai et al., 2009; Ponnapula and
Boberg, 2010), cause low back pain (Bastiaanssen et al., 2005;
Cheng et al., 2009; Gutke et al., 2010; Lisi, 2006) and make it
difficult for pregnant women to perform some activities of daily
living (Garshasbi and Faghih Zadeh, 2005).
Previous biomechanical studies involving pregnant women
have assessed changes in postural control during pregnancy. We
reported that movement patterns of pregnant women during rising
from a chair and walking forward were different from those of
nulliparous women and varied with the number of days since
conception (Sunaga et al., 2013). Difficulties performing a trunk
flexion movement caused pregnant women to rise from a chair
with insufficient forward displacement of their COM, meaning that
they transitioned to walking and enhanced their forward propul-
sion after the transition to walking to compensate for insufficient
forward displacement of the COM. Insufficient lower extremity lift
and enhanced forward propulsion caused uncertain toe clearance
and postural unsteadiness at the initiation of walking, increasing
the risk of falling (Sunaga et al., 2013).
In the United States, accidental falls cause 10e25% of traumas
during pregnancy (Connolly et al., 1997). Dunning et al. (2003) re-
ported that the prevalence of falls in employed pregnant women
was 26.6%, and that in non-employed pregnant women was 27.2%,

 with the most common contributing factors to falls being slippery
floors and carrying an object or a child. McCrory et al. (2011)
demonstrated that pregnant women walked slower than non-
pregnant women, and pregnant women who had fallen during
pregnancy walked slower than pregnant women who had not
fallen during pregnancy. Falls during pregnancy cause trauma for
the mother and, at worst, intrauterine fetal death (Connolly et al.,
1997; Dunning et al., 2003; El-Kady et al., 2004; Murao et al.,
2000). Knowledge of postural control and movement patterns of
pregnant women is necessary to develop safety guidelines to pre-
vent falls.
Body segment inertial parameters (BSPs) are essential to un-
derstand human biomechanics. These include the ratio of segment
mass to whole body mass, the distance of the segment COM from
the edge of the body segment, and the radius of gyration of the
segment. BSPs are required for kinetic analysis of movements, to
calculate variables such as the COM location, joint moments, and
joint powers. BSPs of Caucasian men (Chandler et al., 1975; Clauser
et al., 1969; Dempster, 1955), young Japanese individuals (Ae et al.,
1992), elderly Japanese individuals (Okada et al., 1996), and Japa-
nese children (Yokoi et al., 1986) have been reported. Lee et al.
(2009) reported the effects of BSP estimates on joint kinetics of
the lower extremity during gait and highlighted the necessity of
accurate BSP estimates. However, the available BSP estimates are
not applicable to pregnant women, who have a distinctively
different body shape to non-pregnant women (Yokoi et al., 2002).
Furthermore, we believe that the BSPs of pregnant Japanese
women will differ from those of pregnant Caucasian women, as, for
example, the mean body mass gain of Japanese women during
pregnancy is 9.8 kg (Tsukamoto et al., 2007), whereas that of Ca-
nadian women is 14.1 kg (Hui et al., 2006). A regression expression
to estimate the BSPs of pregnant Canadian women has been pre-
sented (Jensen et al., 1996), but the BSPs of pregnant Japanese
women have not been reported. As such, biomechanical studies
have thus far used standard BSPs that are not applicable to preg-
nant women.
The aim of this study was to estimate the BSPs of pregnant
Japanese women and quantify the changes in BSPs over time. These
data will be useful for future motion analysis studies especially in
analyzing motions in pregnant women. In addition, we compared
BSPs between pregnant and nulliparous Japanese women. Jensen
et al. (1996) reported that the lower trunk mass of pregnant Ca-
nadian women increased significantly in the second and third tri-
mesters of pregnancy, but there were no significant changes in the
mass of other body segments. Therefore, in this study, we focused
only on the lower trunk segment.
Several methods have been used to estimate BSPs, including
cadaver measurements (Chandler et al., 1975; Clauser et al., 1969;
Dempster, 1955), mathematical modeling (Jensen, 1993; Jensen
et al., 1996; Nikolva and Toshev, 2007), and X-ray scanning (Lee
et al., 2009). Ideally, BSPs should be estimated in three di-
mensions, but methods involving radiation, such as X-ray scanning,
are contraindicated for pregnant women. Ferrigno et al. (1994)
calculated the volume of the trunk using a three-dimensional
(3D) motion capture system, a method that was further validated
by comparing inspired and expired lung volumes to volumes
determined by spirometry (Cala et al.,1996). 3D motion capture has
been widely used to analyze chest wall motion during breathing
(Aliverti et al., 2001; Kenyon et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2009);
however, to our knowledge, this method has not been previously
used to estimate BSPs. In the present study, we used a 3D motion
capture system, which has no undesirable effects on both the
mother and fetus, to estimate BSPs of pregnant Japanese women.
The estimated BSPs were used to perform kinetic analyses of
pregnant women performing a movement task that involved rising
from a chair, picking up square plates, turning to the right, and
walking a few steps. In many cases, the motion of rising from a chair
and walking also included turns to head toward a destination and
perform some aimed motion. For these reasons, and in accordance
with the increased risk of falling when carrying an object, we
studied rising from a chair and turning while carrying an object,
which seems to be routinely performed even during pregnancy.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants and measurements
Eight pregnant women (maternal group) with a mean age of
34.4 (SD 5.9) years, a mean body height of 160.3 (SD 4.1) cm, and a
mean pre-pregnancy body mass of 55.4 (SD 6.6) kg volunteered for
this study. Seven nulliparous women with a mean age of 29.3 (SD
2.4) years, a mean height of 156.5 (SD 5.6) cm, and a mean body
mass of 52.4 (SD 7.6) kg also volunteered for this study and formed
the control group. The maternal group was examined on the
following three occasions: between the 16th and 18th weeks of
gestation (Exam 1), between the 24th and 25th weeks of gestation
(Exam 2), and between the 32nd and 33rd weeks of gestation
(Exam 3), as per previous studies (Gilleard et al., 2008; Jang et al.,
2008; Sunaga et al., 2013) and taking into consideration possible
risks to the mother and fetus. The control group was examined on
one occasion. Examinations of BSPs and motion were performed on
the same day. The Ethics Committee of Saitama Prefectural Uni-
versity approved this study (Approval Number 24007), and the
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. All participants provided their written, informed consent
prior to enrollment.
2.2. Examination to estimate BSPs and motion analysis
Twenty-four infrared reflective markers were attached to the
lower trunk and lower extremities of the subjects (Fig.1), who were
dressed in tight, non-reflective clothes. The lower edge of the 10th
rib defined the top edge of the lower trunk segment, and the
greater trochanter defined the bottom edge of the lower trunk
segment. This segment division was based on previous studies
involving Japanese individuals (Ae et al., 1992; Jensen, 1993;
Nikolva and Toshev, 2007; Yokoi et al., 1986) and was chosen to
enable comparisons across studies.
Standing posture was captured using eight infrared cameras
(Vicon Motion Systems, Oxford, UK) while the subjects were
standing comfortably and looking straight ahead. The coordinates
of the markers were identified using a motion analysis software
Vicon NEXUS 1.7.1. (Vicon Motion Systems, Oxford, UK). The center
of the bottom edge of the posterior surface of the lower trunk
segment was defined as the origin of the coordinate system, and
the left-right, antero-posterior, and vertical axes of the lower trunk
segment were defined as the x, y, and z axes, respectively. The co-
ordinate system was orientated so that the right was positive and
the left was negative.
For subjects in the maternal group, body mass, height of the
uterine fundus, and abdominal girth were obtained at each exam-
ination using the most recent obstetric check-up record. Abdominal
girth was measured at the level of the most projecting point around
the navel. For subjects in the control group, body mass was
measured on the day of the experiment.
For the maternal subjects, the markers were replaced after the
examination of BSPs to enable measurement of the movement task.
Thirty-five markers were attached to the subject at the following
locations, according to the Plug-in-Gait Full Body Model (Vicon
Motion Systems, 2010): right and left foreheads and back of the

 heads, 7th cervical spinous process, 10th thoracic spinous process,
suprasternal notch and xiphoid process of the sternum, the inferior
edge of the right scapula, right and left acromia, elbows, thumb
sides and digitus minimus sides of the wrists, bases of the second
metacarpals, anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs), posterior supe-
rior iliac spines (PSISs), the center points of anteroposterior diam-
eter exclude the patella located on the lateral surface of the knee
joint space (knee markers), the points on the line connecting the
knee markers and the points over the lateral 1/3 surface of the line
from ASIS to the greater trochanter, the points on the fibula located
on the upper 1/3 of the lower leg, the lateral malleoli, the heads of
the first metatarsals, and the calcaneal tuberosities.
A table (height, 67 cm) was placed in front of a chair (height,
40 cm) without both backrest and armrests. Two legs of the table
and chair are on the FP1 and FP3, FP2 and FP4, respectively (Fig. 2).
The horizontal distance between the anterior edge of the seat of the
chair and the near side of the top of the table was 25 cm, i.e., within
reach of the subjects. The subjects rose from the chair and picked
up two piled square plates (weight, 8.8 N; depth, 20 cm; width,
30 cm; height, 4 cm) from the table before stepping forward with
the right foot and then turning 90� to the right and walking 3 m
forwards at a self-selected speed. This task was performed three
times at each exam. The location of the infrared markers was
captured at 100 Hz using eight infrared cameras. Ground reaction
force data were captured at 100 Hz by four force plates (Kistler,
Winterthur, Switzerland) to define the instant when the plantar
aspect of the foot lost contact with the floor during walking (Fig. 2).
Force plates were set to 0 N with the table, chair and plates on.
2.3. Calculation of BSPs
The lower trunk was divided into six hexahedral parts, each
consisting of six tetrahedrons. The six tetrahedrons were created by
connecting each vertex of the hexahedrons, as described by
Fig. 1. Location of the markers used for the estimation of body segment inertial parameters.

turned 90� to their right, and then walked forward while carrying the load. FP: Force plate.

 Ferrigno et al. (1994) (Fig. 3). The volume of the tetrahedron 1 in
Fig. 3 was calculated using the Eq. (A. 1) and the similar calculation
method were applied to the volume of the other five tetrahedrons.
The mass (Mj), COM coordinates (Xj, Yj, Zj), moment of inertia (Ixj, Iyj,
Izj), and radius of gyration (kxj, kyj, kzj) of the lower trunk (j) were
calculated using the parameters of the hexahedron obtained from
the values of the individual tetrahedrons, according to Eqs. (A.
2)e(A. 5) in Appendix A. These formulas are in accordance with
those reported by Yokoi et al. (1986). Eqs. (A. 3)e(A. 5) were
modified to calculate the COM, moment of inertia, and radius of
gyration in the x, y, and z directions. The lower trunk was assumed
to be a rigid body segment with a uniform density of 1.037 � 103 kg/
m3 for the control group and Exam 1 of the maternal group and
1.030 � 103 kg/m3 for Exams 2 and 3 of the maternal group (van
Raaij et al., 1988). The coordinates of the segment COM were
normalized to body height. The mass of the lower trunk segment
was normalized to whole body mass. The Z coordinate of the COM
location (Zj) was calculated as the distance from the top of the
segment and expressed relative to segment length. The moment of
inertia was calculated as the principal of inertia when the lower
trunk segment was gyrated about the left and right (x), ante-
roposterior (y), and vertical (z) at the COM coordinate. The radius of
gyration was calculated when the lower trunk segment was gy-
rated about the left and right (x), anteroposterior (y), and vertical
(z) at the COM coordinate and expressed relative to the lower trunk
segment length. All calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel
2010 (Microsoft Japan, Tokyo, Japan).
2.4. Analysis of rising from a chair and carrying a load with a turn
For analysis of the movement task, the body was separated into
15 segments: the head, upper trunk, lower trunk, left and right
upper arm, lower arms, hand, thigh, shank, and foot. For all seg-
ments apart from the lower trunk, the BSPs used were those of
young nulliparous Japanese women reported by Ae et al. (1992). For
the lower trunk segment, two different BSPs were used: those
estimated in the subjects themselves using the data from the earlier
part of the experiment (BSP1) and those of young nulliparous
Japanese women reported by Ae et al. (1992) (BSP2). The lower
trunk segment was defined as described above, and the moment of
the lower trunk segment was calculated with the origin of the
segment as the center of gyration. In the global coordinate system,
the transverse, longitudinal, and vertical directions were defined as
the x, y, and z axes, respectively, with right, forwards, and upward
defined as positive. The local coordinate systems of the lower trunk
segment are shown in Fig. 4. The center of the line connecting the
right and left greater trochanters was defined as the origin. The
vector crossing the origin and connecting the right and left greater
trochanters was defined as the x axis. The vector crossing the origin
and orthogonal to the vector connecting the center of the line be-
tween the right and left ASISs and the center of the line between
the right and left PSISs and x axis was defined as the z axis. The
vector crossing the origin and orthogonal to the x and z axes was
defined as the y axis. The lower trunk moment was described as the
inner moment when the lower trunk segment was gyrated about
the x axis. The moment was defined as flexion and extension when
the lower trunk segment was gyrated anteriorly and posteriorly,
respectively. The moment of the lower trunk segment and the co-
ordinates and velocity of the COM were calculated using Body
Builder software (Vicon Motion Systems, Oxford, UK).
Initiation of motion in the movement task was defined as when
the upper trunk flexion angle first increased while rising from a
Fig. 3. The lower trunk segment model used to estimate inertial parameters. The lower trunk segment was divided into six hexahedral parts, each comprising six tetrahedrons. The
six tetrahedrons were created by connecting each vertex of the hexahedrons. The mass (Mj), COM (Xj, Yj, Zj), inertial moment (Ixj, Iyj, Izj), and radius of gyration (kxj, kyj, kzj) of the
lower trunk (j) were calculated for the lower trunk segment from the value of each tetrahedron using the mathematical Eqs. (A. 1)e(A. 4). nj is the number of the hexahedrons in
part j, dj is the density of the part j, vij is the volume of the hexahedron ij and xij, yij, and zij are the coordinates of the COM of the hexahedron ij.

 chair. Toe offs for the first swing leg and the stance leg were defined
as when the vertical ground reaction force on the force plate was
below 0 N because the force plates were set to 0 N with the table
and chair on.
Three events during walking were identified according to Kerr
et al. (2004): (1) first toe off of the first swing leg (1st swing-off);
(2) first toe off of the first stance leg (stance-off); and (3) 2nd toe
off of the first swing leg (2nd swing-off). The moment of the lower
trunk segment and the location and velocity of the COM were
calculated at initiation of motion and each of these events.
2.5. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 21
software (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan). One-way analysis of variance
with a post-hoc Dunnett's test was performed to compare the body
mass, height of the uterine fundus, abdominal girth, and BSPs be-
tween the groups, and repeated measures analysis was performed
to compare within the maternal group. The body mass was
compared between the control group and the four maternal groups
(maternal before pregnancy, maternal Exam 1, maternal Exam 2,
and maternal Exam 3). The height of the uterine fundus and
abdominal girth were compared within three maternal groups
(maternal Exam 1, maternal Exam 2, and maternal Exam 3). BSPs
were compared between the groups and within the three maternal
groups (maternal Exam 1, maternal Exam 2, and maternal Exam 3).
A paired t-test was used to compare the lower trunk moment and
the location and velocity of the COM calculated using BSP1 and
BSP2. When the distribution of the values was not normally
distributed, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for this com-
parison. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
3. Results
3.1. BSPs of the lower trunk segment
Body mass, height of the uterine fundus, and abdominal girth
are shown in Table 1. The body mass was significantly heavier at
maternal Exam 3 than in the control group (P ¼ 0.028). Body mass,
height of the uterine fundus, and abdominal girth increased
significantly within the maternal group (body mass: between
before pregnancy and Exam 1, P ¼ 0.000; before pregnancy and
Exam 2, P ¼ 0.000; before pregnancy and Exam 3, P ¼ 0.000;
maternal Exams 1 and 2, P ¼ 0.040; maternal Exams 1 and 3,
P ¼ 0.000; maternal Exams 2 and 3, P ¼ 0.007; height of the uterine
fundus: between Exams 1and 2, P ¼ 0.043; Exams 1 and 3,
P ¼ 0.002; Exams 2 and 3, P ¼ 0.022; abdominal girth: between
Exams 1 and 2, P ¼ 0.015; Exams 1 and 3, P ¼ 0.004).
The lower trunk segment length and absolute and relative
masses are shown in Table 2. The lower trunk segment was
significantly longer in the maternal group than in the control group
(Exam 1, P ¼ 0.003; Exam 2, P ¼ 0.001; Exam 3, P ¼ 0.006). The
absolute and relative lower trunk segment masses were signifi-
cantly greater in the maternal group at Exams 2 and 3 than in the
control group (absolute mass: Exam 2, P ¼ 0.020; Exam 3,
P ¼ 0.006; relative mass: Exam 2, P ¼ 0.003; Exam 3, P ¼ 0.001). In
the maternal group, the absolute lower trunk segment mass at
Exam 3 was significantly greater than at Exam 1 (P ¼ 0.026).
The coordinates of the lower trunk segment COM are shown in
Table 3. The segment COM was located more anteriorly (Y coordi-
nate) in the maternal group at Exams 1, 2, and 3 than in the control
group (Exam 1, P ¼ 0.030; Exam 2, P ¼ 0.007; Exam 3, P ¼ 0.003),
but there were no significant differences in the X and Z coordinates
of the segment COM or in the relative position of the Z coordinate
within the lower trunk segment between the groups and within the
maternal group.
The moment of inertia of the lower trunk segment and the
radius of gyration of the lower trunk segment expressed relative to
segment length are shown in Table 4. The moment of inertia of the
lower trunk segment about the y axis was significantly larger in the
maternal group at Exam 3 than in the control group (P ¼ 0.035). The
radius of gyration about the y axis was significantly smaller in the
maternal group than in the control group (Exam 1, P ¼ 0.001; Exam
2, P ¼ 0.002; Exam 3, P ¼ 0.036).
3.2. Motion analysis
The moment of the lower trunk segment and the location and
velocity of the COM at each event during the movement task are
shown in Tables 5e7 when calculated with BSP1 and BSP2. There
were more significant differences between BSP1 and BSP2 in the
latter stages of pregnancy than in the early stage of pregnancy.

Fig. 4. The local coordinate system of the lower trunk segment. The center of the line
connecting the right and left greater trochanters was defined as the origin. The vector
crossing the origin and connecting the right and left greater trochanters was defined as
the x axis. The vector crossing the origin and orthogonal to the vector connecting the
center of the line between the right and left anterior superior iliac spines and the
center of the line between the right and left posterior superior iliac spines and x axis
was defined as the z axis. The vector crossing the origin and orthogonal to the x and z
axes was defined as the y axis.

 women were quantified using a 3D motion capture system at three
different times during pregnancy and compared with those of
nulliparous women. The lower trunk segment length was signifi-
cantly longer in the control group than in the maternal group
because of individual variability in physical constitution between
subjects in this study. Moreover, the lower trunk segment length
decreased as pregnancy progressed, although there was no signif-
icant difference. This result could have been due to increasing
spinal curvature. The absolute and relative lower trunk segment
masses were significantly greater in the maternal group at Exams 2
and 3 than in the control group, although there was no significant
difference at Exam 1. This result represents the lower trunk
segment mass is not affected by uterine increase at the period of
the Exam 1. Additionally, the absolute and relative masses of the
lower trunk segment increased as pregnancy progressed. Jensen
et al. (1996) reported that the lower trunk segment mass of preg-
nant Canadian women increased from 21.6 kg to 28.4 kg between
the 2nd and 9th months of gestation, i.e. by 0.29 kg per week during
pregnancy. In the present study, the lower trunk segment mass of
pregnant Japanese women increased from 11.5 kg to 14.7 kg be-
tween 16th and 33rd weeks of gestation, i.e., by 0.19 kg per week.
This corresponds to an increase of 27.8%, compared to an increase of
25.2% between the 16th and 33rd weeks of gestation in Canadian
women, as estimated from the linear regression in Jensen et al.
(1996). This difference may be due to differences in the physical
constitution,
timing

populations.
The relative mass of the lower trunk segment in nulliparous and
pregnant women at Exam 1 in this study was smaller than that
reported by Ae et al. for young Japanese women (1992). This may be
due to differences in the measurement method and/or the method
of division of the lower trunk segment. The relative mass of the
lower trunk segment in pregnant women at Exams 2 and 3 was
greater than that in the young female Japanese individuals reported
by Ae et al. (1992). This result indicates that changes in maternal
morphology were captured using the methods used in this study.
The Y coordinate of the lower trunk segment COM was signifi-
cantly more anterior in the maternal group than in the control
group, but there were no significant differences in the X and Z co-
ordinates of the lower trunk segment COM or the relative location
of the Z coordinate within the lower trunk segment between
maternal and control groups. The anterior shift of the lower trunk
segment COM in the maternal group occurred because of the
anterior shift of the heavy part of the abdomen.
The moment of inertia of the lower trunk segment Iy was signif-
icantly larger in pregnant women at Exam 3 than in nulliparous
women. Jensen et al. (1996) reported that the moment of inertia of
the lower trunk segment increased at a rate of 0.00679, 0.00474, and
0.00612 kg m2 per week throughout pregnancy for Ix, Iy, and Iz,
respectively, and these rates of change were greater than those for all
other segments. The result in this study indicated that the moment of
inertia was affected by the change of body mass during pregnancy.
Additionally, the variables related to moment of inertia, such as the
COM location and the mass of the lower trunk segment, changed due
to high inter-subject variability in the timingof the appearance of the
abdominal protrusion and in physical constitution.
When expressed relative to the segment length, the radius of
gyration was smaller in pregnant women at Exam 1 to 3 than in
nulliparous women, and this was due to the longer segment length
and larger segment mass of the maternal group.
The effect of pregnancy on BSPs should be considered in
biomechanical analyses of pregnant women. The radius of gyration
of the lower trunk segment, which was significantly different be-
tween pregnant women at Exam 1 to 3 and nulliparous women, is
generally incorporated in motion analysis software. The ratio of the
lower trunk segment mass to whole body mass and the COM
location of the lower trunk segment are also generally incorporated
in motion analysis software. In this study, these variables were

 incorporated into the analysis of a movement in which subjects
rose from a chair and carried an object while walking. The results
showed that these variables affected biomechanical parameters.
Possible risk factors for falling during pregnancy, there are precious
few studies which have been identified in detail, may be investi-
gated by using BSPs produced by motion analysis assessment of
pregnant women. As detailed in Section 1, the increases in mass and
volume of the abdomen that occurs during pregnancy cause
changes in physical function, and the validity and reliability of
biomechanical analysis of pregnant women would be improved by
the use of appropriate BSPs.
Physical constitution varies not only with pregnancy, but also
with other variables, such as stage of pregnancy, race, and age,
therefore biomechanical analyses should be performed based on
valid BSPs. We believe that the method used in the present study to
determine BSPs is useful, since it uses the same equipment that is
used to perform motion analysis, and motion analysis can therefore
be performed in the same session if the infrared makers are relo-
cated. The small number of subjects and the inter-individual vari-
ability in physical constitution are the main limitations of this
study. However, the changes of BSPs affect the biomechanics of
motion, so that the data measured at each period of pregnancy are
important basic data. Additionally, it is recommended that BSPs be
applied as specific data to individuals, if possible.
5. Conclusions
The absolute and relative masses, the COM location, the
moment of inertia, and the radius of gyration of the lower trunk
segment of pregnant Japanese women were estimated using a
novel approach based on a 3D motion capture system. The moment
of inertia changed as pregnancy progressed. Therefore, different
BSPs should be used in biomechanical analyses of pregnant women
according to the stage of pregnancy and each pregnant subject.
Further research is required to validate these results by using the
estimated BSPs proposed in this study in the motion analysis of
pregnant women.
