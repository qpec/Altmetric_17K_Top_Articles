Abstract
Background Coaches,
sport
scientists,
clinicians
and
medical personnel face a constant challenge to prescribe
sufficient training load to produce training adaption while
minimising fatigue, performance inhibition and risk of
injury/illness.
Objective The aim of this review was to investigate the
relationship between injury and illness and longitudinal
training load and fatigue markers in sporting populations.
Methods Systematic searches of the Web of Science and
PubMed online databases to August 2015 were conducted
for
articles
reporting
relationships
between
training
load/fatigue
measures
and
injury/illness
in
athlete
populations.
Results From the initial 5943 articles identified, 2863
duplicates were removed, followed by a further 2833
articles from title and abstract selection. Manual searching
of the reference lists of the remaining 247 articles, together
with use of the Google Scholar ‘cited by’ tool, yielded 205
extra articles deemed worthy of assessment. Sixty-eight
studies were subsequently selected for inclusion in this
study, of which 45 investigated injury only, 17 investigated
illness only, and 6 investigated both injury and illness. This
systematic review highlighted a number of key findings,
including disparity within the literature regarding the use of
various terminologies such as training load, fatigue, injury
and illness. Athletes are at an increased risk of injury/ill-
ness at key stages in their training and competition,
including periods of training load intensification and peri-
ods of accumulated training loads.
Conclusions Further investigation of individual athlete
characteristics is required due to their impact on internal
training load and, therefore, susceptibility to injury/illness.
Key Points
Athletes training load and fatigue should be
monitored and modified appropriately during key
stages of training and competition, such as periods of
intensification of work training load, accumulated
training load and changes in acute training load,
otherwise there is a significant risk of injury.
Immunosuppression occurs following a rapid
increase in training load. Athletes who do not return
to baseline levels within the latency period
(7–21 days) are at higher risk of illness during this
period.
Individual characteristics such as fitness, body
composition, playing level, injury history and age
have a significant impact on internal training loads
placed on the athlete. Longitudinal management is
therefore recommended to reduce the risk of injury
and illness.

 1 Introduction
Previous research has demonstrated that training and
competition stress result in temporary decrements in
physical performance and significant levels of fatigue post-
competition [1–3]. These decrements are typically derived
from increased muscle damage [3, 4], impairment of the
immune system [1], imbalances in anabolic–catabolic
homeostasis [5], alteration in mood [6, 7] and reduction in
neuromuscular function (NMF) [2, 7, 8]. The resultant
fatigue from these variables can take up to 5 days to return
to baseline values post-competition [5], with sports that
have frequent competition (i.e. often weekly in team
sports) also inducing accumulative fatigue over time [9]. In
addition to the significant amounts of fatigue induced by
competition, many athletes experience fatigue as a result of
the work required to develop the wide variety of physical
qualities that contribute significantly to performance. For
example, in both team and individual sports, speed,
strength, power and endurance are required in addition to
technical and tactical skills [10]. To achieve optimal
development and performance, these physical qualities
must be trained and developed, which, irrespective of the
level of training loads used, may also induce further levels
of fatigue [10, 11].
1.1 Training Load, Fatigue, Injury and Illness
Definitions
Training load, fatigue, injury and illness have become
widely used terms within exercise science and sports such
as soccer and the various rugby codes; however, there has
been a lack of consistency regarding these definitions and
their use. When describing load/workload throughout this
paper, unless otherwise stated, load refers to training load
and is defined as the stress placed on the body by the
performed activity [12]. Training load comprises internal
and external workload, whereby internal training load
quantifies the physical loading experienced by an athlete
and external training load describes the quantification of
work external to the athlete [13]. Fatigue can be defined as
the decrease in the pre-match/baseline psychological and
physiological function of the athlete [14]. An accumulation
of fatigue can result in overtraining, which has a significant
negative impact on performance [15]. For example, the
investigation by Johnston et al. [16] regarding the physio-
logical responses to an intensified period of rugby league
competition over a 5-day period found that cumulative
fatigue appeared to compromise high-intensity running,
maximal accelerations and defensive performance in the
final game. This suggests that when athletes do not receive
adequate time to recover between training and competition,
fatigue will accumulate, compromise key aspects of per-
formance and result in an increased risk of injury and ill-
ness to the athlete [1, 15–17]. The definition of injury has
recently been realigned to the notion of impairment used by
the World Health Organization [18, 19]. As a result injury
can be categorised into three domains: clinical examination
reports,
athlete
self-reports
and
sports
performance,
according to the Injury Definitions Concept Framework
(IDCF) [18, 19].
1.2 Monitoring Tools
Due to the highly complex nature of fatigue [9, 20], as well
as individualised responses to similar training loads
[21, 22], it is important to monitor global athlete fatigue
levels (i.e. mental, physical and emotional) in response to
prescribed training loads in order to minimise injury and
illness [23]. Given the link between training load and
injury incidence is now established, measures aimed at
controlling and reducing the risk factors for the develop-
ment of a sports injury are critical to primary, secondary
and tertiary injury prevention [149]. Monitoring tools are
used extensively in elite sport as valid indicators of
recovery status of the athlete [17] and to inform support
staff making decisions regarding the balance between
prescribing training and recovery/rest so that performance
is optimised and injury/illness minimised. Various aspects
of global training load and fatigue can be measured that
impact the day-to-day readiness of the athlete [17], with a
range of subjective and objective measures adopted to
monitor both load (e.g. training volume/duration/exposure,
number of skill repetitions, rating of perceived exertion
[RPE], session RPE [sRPE], global positioning systems
[GPS]) and fatigue (e.g. perceptual wellness scales, neu-
romuscular fatigue, biochemical markers, immunological
markers and sleep quantity/quality) [17].
1.3 The Relationship Between Training Load
and Fatigue Markers and Injury and Illness
The majority of training load/fatigue monitoring research
has focused on acute responses to measure recovery of
performance variables and the acceleration of this process
through
the
implementation
of
recovery
modalities
[8, 24, 25]. In contrast, fewer attempts have been made to
monitor acute and/or cumulative load and fatigue variables
longitudinally to determine the association with injury/ill-
ness. Longitudinal monitoring refers to the investigation of
how change or accumulation in training load/fatigue is
associated with injury/illness over time. The use of long-
term monitoring allows for the measurement of training
load and fatigue variables to identify any injury/illness
trends in order to provide practitioners with objective data
944

123
 for planning training over multiple blocks, rather than
relying solely on anecdotal evidence, with the aim of
reducing overtraining and injury/illness [17, 26]. Any
subsequent reduction in injury and illness is likely to have a
significant impact on team performance due to the large
percentages of athletes from training squads (approxi-
mately 25 %) in team sports injured at any one time [27],
and the association between the number of injuries and
matches won [28, 29]. Although recent reviews have pro-
vided a summary of the methods available to monitor
athlete load and fatigue [17], the relationship between
training load in throwing-dominant sports [144], training
load and injury, illness and soreness [13], and the rela-
tionship between workloads, physical performance, injury
and illness in adolescent male football players [150], they
have not detailed or critiqued the specific relationship
between longitudinal training load, fatigue markers, and
subsequent injury
and
illness.
Additionally, previous
reviews have adopted strict inclusion criteria, leading to
lower numbers of studies included for consideration.
1.4 Objectives
The objective of this study was to perform a systematic
review and evaluate the association between longitudinally
monitored training load, markers of fatigue, and injury/
illness in sporting populations. In doing so, this review
gives recommendations regarding appropriate variables to
measure training load, and suggestions for further studies
investigating longitudinal monitoring and fatigue markers
and their relationship with injury and illness.
2 Methods
2.1 Literature Search Methodology
A Cochrane Collaboration [30] review methodology (lit-
erature search, assessment of study quality, data collection
of study characteristics, analysis and interpretation of
results, and recommendations for practice and further
research) was used to identify relationships between long-
term training load, fatigue markers, injury and illness.
2.2 Search Parameters and Criteria
We searched the Web of Science and PubMed online
databases until August 2015 using combinations of the
following terms linked with the Boolean operators ‘AND’
and ‘OR’: ‘athlete’, ‘distance’, ‘fatigue’, ‘illness’, ‘in-
jury*’, ‘match’, ‘monitor*’, ‘monitoring’, ‘neuromuscular’,
‘performance’, ‘training’, and ‘wellness’. Articles were
first selected by title content, then abstract content, and
then by full article content. Manual searches were then
conducted from the reference lists of the remaining articles
that were selected for the ‘full article content’ stage, using
the Google Scholar ‘cited by’ tool and article reference
lists.
Exclusion
criteria
included
studies
that
were
(i) unavailable in English; (ii) review papers; (iii) purely
epidemiological; (iv) studying non-athlete, chronically sick
and/or already injured/ill populations; (v) study length
\
2 weeks; and (vi) acute studies not investigating how
change or accumulation in load/fatigue associates with
injury/illness over time (Fig. 1 shows the flow of infor-
mation through the systematic review process). After an
initial 5943 articles were identified through online database
searching, 2863 were discarded due to duplication, 2558
were discarded due to title content, and 275 were discarded
due to abstract content. Subsequent manual searching
yielded 205 additional articles that were also assessed for
inclusion.
Lastly,
384
articles
were
discarded
upon
assessment of their full-text content, leaving 68 studies for
inclusion in the final review (injury, n = 45; illness,
n = 17; injury and illness, n = 6).
2.3 Assessment of Study Quality
As noted in previous systematic reviews [31], the usual
method of quality evaluation comprises tools such as the
Delphi [32] or PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database)
[33] scales whose criteria are often not relevant for specific
review study types, including this current review article.
For example, similar to Hume et al. [31], 5 of the 11 PEDro
scale criteria were not included by any study in this review,
including concealed allocation, subject blinding, therapist
blinding, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis.
Therefore, to reduce the risk of bias, and given the
unsuitability of scales such as Delphi and PEDro to assess
the literature in this review, two authors independently
evaluated each included article using a 9-item custom
methodological
quality
assessment
scale
with
scores
ranging from 0 to 2 (total score out of 18). The nine items
included
(1)
study
design
(0 = retrospective,
1 = prospective cohort, 2 = experimental e.g. intervention
or
case/control);
(2)
injury
and/or
illness
inclusion
(1 = one of either, 2 = both); (3) injury/illness definition
(0 = not stated, 1 = no distinction between performance,
self-reported or clinical, 2 = clearly defining if injury was
sports performance, self-reported or clinical examination;
(4) sporting level (0 = less than sub-elite, 1 = sub-elite,
2 = elite); (5) fatigue and/or load inclusion (1 = one of
either, 2 = both); (6) number of fatigue and/or load vari-
ables (0 = 1, 1 = 2–3, 2 = more than 3); (7) statistics
used (0 = subjective/visual analysis or no direct compar-
ative analysis for fatigue/load and injury/illness associa-
tions; 1 = objective statistics for fatigue/load and injury/

123
 illness associations, 2 = objective statistics with: (i) ad-
justments for fatigue/load interactions, or (ii) quantification
of injury/illness prediction success); (8) study length
(0 = less than 6 weeks, 1 = 6 weeks to 1 year, 2 = more
than 1 year); and (9) fatigue and/or load monitoring fre-
quency (0 = less than monthly, 1 = weekly to monthly,
2 = more than weekly). Item 4 (sporting level) definitions
were as follows: less than sub-elite—unpaid novices or
recreational athletes, e.g. first-time runner [35] or amateur
rugby league player who trains once or twice a week and
plays weekly matches [36]; sub-elite—experienced athlete
who trains regularly with a performance focus, e.g. lower-
league soccer player who trains two to three times a week
[37]; elite–athletes competing and/or training at national or
international level. Item 6 (load/fatigue variables) refers to
the number of a particular kind of variable. For example,
three immunological markers and five perceptual wellness
factors included in a study would be registered as two
variables, not eight. A positive approach was taken
regarding items 6 and 9, i.e. the variable that scored the
greatest on the item scale was included as the final score.
For example, if one variable was monitored twice a week
and one was measured monthly, the final score for item 9
would be 2. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) study
quality score was 11 ± 2 (range 7–15).
2.4 Data Extraction and Analysis
For each article, the year of publication, quality score, sex,
sporting level, sample size, injury/illness definition and
type, fatigue/load variables, and a summary of findings
were extracted and are included in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Only the fatigue/load variables that were associated with
injury/illness in each study were included. As much data as
possible were included for the summary of findings;
however, if large amounts of data were reported in an
article then only significant/clear results were used. The
magnitude of effects were reported in the following

load/fatigue–injury data were analysed using Pearson cor-
relations. A priori level of evidence was evaluated using
the van Tulder et al. method [142]. Levels of evidence were
defined as strong (consistent findings among multiple high-
quality randomised controlled trials [RCTs]), moderate
(consistent findings among multiple low-quality RCTs and/
or non-RCTs, clinical controlled trials [CCTs], and or one
high-quality RCT), limited (one low-quality RCT and/or

 CCT), conflicting (inconsistent findings among multiple
trial RCTs and/or CCTs) and no evidence from trials (no
RCTs or CCTs) [142]. The van Tulder et al. [142] method
is an accepted method of measuring the strength of evi-
dence [13, 142]. The Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based
Medicine Levels of Evidence [151] was utilised to deter-
mine the hierarchical level of evidence, whereby the
highest level of evidence pertained to a systematic review
of RCTs, and the lowest level of evidence pertained to
expert opinion without critical appraisal or based on
physiology, bench research or ‘first principles’ [13, 151].
The levels of evidence of each study are presented in
Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4.
2.5 Definitions of Key Terms
Training load, fatigue injury and illness have previously
been defined (see Sect. 1.1). Latency period is defined as
the period between training load and the onset of injury or
illness [13]. Finally, we used the term ‘exposure’ to refer to
time spent participating in a particular training/competition
activity.
3 Results
3.1 Retention of Studies
Overall, 68 studies were retained for inclusion in the final
review (Fig. 1), of which 45 (66 %) investigated injury
only, 17 (25 %) investigated illness only, and 6 (8 %)
investigated both injury and illness. In addition, 42 (61 %)
articles focused on load–injury/illness relationships, 11
(16 %) focused on fatigue–injury/illness relationships only,
and 15 (22 %) included both load and fatigue variables. In
the 57 studies that investigated load–injury/illness rela-
tionships,
many
different
load
measures
were
used,
including training exposure (n = 14, 24 %) [35, 40–52];
number of sessions/matches (n = 5, 8 %) [46, 47, 53–55],
number of skill repetitions [e.g. number of deliveries
bowled
for
cricketers]
(n = 6,
10 %)
[56–61];
days
between/frequency of matches (n = 8, 14 %) [53, 55,
56, 62–66]; heart rate (n = 4, 7 %) [48, 55, 67, 68]; RPE
(n = 2,
3 %)
[69,
70];
sRPE
(n = 21,
36 %)
[26, 36, 40, 54, 57, 68, 70–84]; number/intensity of colli-
sions (n = 2, 3 %) [64, 65]; distance [both self-reported
and GPS derived] (n = 6, 10 %) [34, 49, 68, 69, 85, 86];
velocity/acceleration GPS-derived measures (n = 2, 3 %)
[38, 85]; metabolic equivalents [MET] (n = 1, 1 %) [87];
the Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire [88] (n = 1,
1 %) [89]; and a combined volume and intensity ranking
[1–5 scale] (n = 1, 1 %) [90]. A number of fatigue mea-
sures were also used in the 26 studies that investigated
fatigue–injury/illness relationships, including perceptual
wellness scales (n = 13, 50 %) [37, 39, 48–50, 75, 80, 81,
91–95]; sleep quantity/quality (n = 6, 23 %) [39, 48, 71,
80, 95, 96]; immunological markers (n = 12, 46 %)
[49, 54, 73, 82, 83, 87, 89, 90, 97–100]; and stress hormone
levels (n = 6, 23 %) [75, 81–83, 100, 101].
3.2 Definitions of Key Terms
Thirty-seven
(54 %)
studies
defined
injury/illness
as
‘sports incapacity’ [102, 109 ] events (i.e. the injury/illness
caused time-loss from, or an alteration in, normal training
schedule), whereas 26 studies (38 %) did not distinguish
between what category the injury/illness orientated from,
and defined injury/illness by measures such as the ‘Wis-
consin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey’ [104] for
upper respiratory illness (URI), or as any pain or disability
experienced by a player during a match or training session
[105] for injury. Only two studies did not clarify which
type of injury/illness definition was used [42, 74].
3.3 Statistical Analysis Methods
A range of statistical analysis methods were also used,
including Pearson correlations [68], mean differences in
load/fatigue between injured and non-injured groups [86], a
Cox proportional regression frailty model [34], logistic
regression with binomial distribution [26], linear regression
[78] and multinomial regression [71], with only one study
adjusting for interactions between load and fatigue mea-
sures [50]. Main et al. used linear mixed modelling to
assess the interactive associations between training expo-
sure and psychological stressors with signs and symptoms
of illness in 30 sub-elite triathletes [50]. In addition, only
two studies provided an indication of the success of load to
predict injury. Specifically, Gabbett [26] achieved this
using a sensitivity and specificity analysis, while Foster
[74] reported the percentage excursions beyond their
derived load thresholds that did not result in illness.
3.4 Sporting Populations
A number of different sporting populations were repre-
sented, from recreational to elite level; namely, American
Football (n = 1) [89]; Australian Football [AF] (n = 6)
[68, 70, 84, 85, 94, 96]; basketball (n = 2) [81, 106];
cricket [fast bowlers] (n = 5) [56–58, 60, 61]; futsal
(n = 1) [82]; soccer (n = 21) [37, 38, 40, 43–47, 53,
55, 62, 63, 67, 71, 75, 83, 92, 93, 95, 100, 101]; road
cycling (n = 1) [73]; rugby league (n = 13) [26, 34, 36,
39, 64–66, 76–80, 94]; rugby union (n = 5) [41, 52, 54, 72,
94]; running (n = 4) [35, 42, 69, 86]; swimming (n = 4)
[49, 74, 97, 98]; triathlon (n = 2) [48, 50]; wheelchair

 rugby (n = 1) [99]; and yacht racing (n = 1) [90]. Two
studies used a mix of various sports [51, 87]. The majority
of studies included only male participants (n = 52), with
11
studies
including
both
males
and
females
[35, 49, 50, 74, 86, 87, 92, 93, 97–99] and three including
females only [42, 83, 106]. Three studies used intervention
[35, 48, 77] and case-control study designs [83, 89, 105],
with nine studies [38, 41, 45–47, 67, 75, 77, 82] investi-
gating injury/illness severity as opposed to injury/illness
incidence only.
4 Discussion
The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the
literature that has examined the longitudinal monitoring of
training load and fatigue data, and its relationship with
injury/illness in sporting populations. Although a number
of common findings were identified from the 68 studies, a
lack of consistency and conflicting views are clearly
apparent within the literature regarding the definition of
key terms, monitoring of the training load and injury and
illness, and monitoring of fatigue markers and their rela-
tionship to injury and illness.
4.1 Reporting of Terms
This review has identified conflicting levels of evidence for
several key terms and their subsequent measures used to
longitudinally monitor the athlete, including training load,
fatigue, injury and illness. The use of multiple definitions
within the literature to describe a singular term may lead to
confusion and misuse at both a conceptual and practical
level by leading to inadequate and inconsistent criteria for
defining samples, and subsequent difficulty in comparing
one study with another [77].
4.1.1 Training Load and Fatigue
Use of the terms training load and fatigue was found to
have the greatest misinterpretation within this review,
primarily the interchangeability of these terms within the
literature. For example, a recent study by Hulin et al. [57]
applying Bannister’s fitness–fatigue model [107] to train-
ing stress-balance (acute:chronic workload ratio) described
fatigue as the acute training load (weekly training load
total), and fitness as the chronic load (previous 4-weekly
total average). Even though this new method of monitoring
training load provided by Hulin et al. [57] has enabled a
greater understanding of the relationship between training
load and injury [108, 131], the application of fitness and
fatigue terminology to represent training workload has
added further confusion. This has resulted in several recent
studies readdressing this issue, whereby the fitness–fatigue
model (formerly training stress balance) has been replaced
by the term acute:chronic workload ratio for this very
reason [108, 131, 143, 145, 146, 148]. The key implication
for researchers and practitioners here is that when training
load and fatigue are used as terms they should be clearly
defined and described as separate entities.
4.1.2 Injury and Illness
Along with the 37 studies that used time-loss injury/illness
definitions, 26 studies have simply reported ‘injury’ or
‘illness’ when summarising key findings, without distin-
guishing
between
categories.
Distinguishing
between
which category of injury/illness is an important practical
consideration. For example, Brink et al. [71] noted differ-
ences between traumatic injury, overuse injury and illness
associations with training load, while Orchard et al. [59]
reported training load-related differences for joint, bone,
tendon and muscle injuries. Standardised reporting of
injury/illness
incidence
will
further
aid
comparison
between studies, as well as generation of any subsequent
meta-analyses [111].
4.1.3 Exposure
Three terms were also used to describe the time spent
participating in a particular training/competition activity;
namely, duration [71], volume [41, 52] and exposure [44].
However, ‘volume’ was used as a term in only two studies
and, in Brooks et al. [41], it was included in the study title
and was used interchangeably with ‘exposure’ in the article
text. Several studies, such as Buist et al. [35] and Main
et al. [50], also used ‘exposure’ in the article text but did
not include it in their titles or keywords.
4.1.4 Perceptual Wellness
It should also be noted that the term ‘perceptual wellness
scales’ covers a range of inventories that attempt to assess
how individuals perceive particular physical and psycho-
logical states. The measures used in the studies included in
this review ranged from simple 1–5 Likert scale ques-
tionnaires for factors such as energy, sleep quality and
mood [80], to more detailed and longer multi-question
tools such as the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Ath-
letes (REST-Q) [39] or the Daily Analysis of Life
Demands for Athletes Questionnaire (DALDA) [81].
4.2 Training Load and Injury
Monitoring of training load accounted for 33 of 68 studies
in this review, with the majority from team sports (90 %),
956
C. M. Jones et al.
123
 predominately soccer and rugby league, and the additional
10 % coming from three running studies [35, 42, 86] and
one with a mixed sporting group [51] (Table 1). For
internal training load, the most common measure was sRPE
(n = 21), with exposure the most frequent (n = 15) for
external load. The following section discusses the emerg-
ing moderate evidence for the relationship between training
load and key stages of training and competition, which
highlights where athletes were deemed to be more sus-
ceptible to increased risk of injury [26, 41, 44, 84, 85].
4.2.1 Periods of Training Load Intensification
Periods of training load intensification, such as preseason,
periods of increased competition, and injured players
returning to full training, were found to increase the risk of
injury. For example, athletes returning for preseason are at
significantly greater risk of injury, potentially from the
intensification in training workload and detraining effect
from the offseason [26, 84]. This may result in the athlete
being unable to tolerate the external/internal training load
placed on them. Gabbett [26] also reported that the likeli-
hood of non-contact soft tissue injury was 50–80 % (95 %
CI) in a rugby league preseason when weekly internal
training load (sRPE) was between 3000 and 5000 AU
compared with lower weekly training loads, and that
increased loads during preseason elevated injury rate at a
group level but not during the inseason [105]. Along with
high preseason training loads, periods of training and
match load intensification, such as periods of congested
scheduling,
were
also
investigated
in
the
literature
[7, 15, 16]. However, there was conflicting evidence from
the six studies investigating associations between shortened
recovery cycles and injury. Two studies found shortened
recovery to be related to increased injury [53, 63], one
study related to decreased injury [64], one study found
moderate recovery cycles to have the highest injury risk
[65], one study reported different findings depending on
injury type [66], and one study found no significant asso-
ciations [62].
4.2.2 Changes in Acute Training Load
Another facet of this review was how acute change in
training load (week to week) is associated with injury risk.
Piggot et al. [68] identified that if weekly internal training
load was increased by more than 10 %, this explained
40 % of injury in the subsequent 7 days. The other two
studies to assess acute changes in training load both found
a positive linear relationship between increased acute
internal training load (1245–1250 AU) relative to the pre-
vious week and injury rate in elite contact-sport athletes
[72, 84]. However, in contrast, the investigation by Buist
et al. [35] regarding injury incidence among novice runners
following a graded training programme (running minutes
increased 10.5 %/week) versus a control group (running
minutes increased 23.7 %/week) found no difference
between groups for running-related injury (RRI) rate (odds
ratio 0.8, 95 % CI 0.6–1.3), despite a greater increase in
acute weekly training minutes in the control group. This
finding is in agreement with the study by Nielsen et al. [86]
regarding the development of RRI in novice runners
(n = 60) during a 10-week prospective study. Those who
sustained an RRI showed an increase in weekly training
load of 31.6 %/week when compared with a 22.1 %/week
increase among healthy participants; however, this was
deemed non-significant (p = 0.07). This lack of increase in
injury with increased acute training load may be first
explained by the fact that only external load has been
measured, with all relationships that have been found
adopting internal training load measures. Second, novice
runners may be able to improve at a greater rate than
experienced athletes [113] and are therefore potentially
able to tolerate large relative increases in external training
load due to the absolute external and internal training load
level being low.
4.2.3 Accumulated Training Load
Another key stage of training and competition that was
highlighted was the effect of long-term accumulated
training load (chronic workload) on injury incidence. For
example, Ekstrand et al. [44] compared external load
(training/match exposures) and injury rates between elite
soccer players who participated in the international World
Cup after the domestic season (World-Cup players) and
non-World-Cup players. World-Cup players had greater
match exposure and total (training plus match) exposure
compared with non-World-Cup players during the domes-
tic season (46 vs. 33 matches). Ekstrand et al. [44] then
found that 32 % of this high-exposure group sustained a
drop in performance, with 29 % proceeding to sustain
injury during the World Cup. Moreover, 60 % of players
who had played more than one competition/week in the
10 weeks prior to the World Cup also sustained an injury.
aus der Fu
¨nten et al. investigated the effect of a reduced
winter break (6.5 weeks down to 3.5 weeks) by comparing
training exposure and injury rates between the two seasons
immediately before and after the change in the length of
the winter break [45]. Even though the reduced winter
break showed athletes having lower training and match
exposures, injury rates were higher, particularly in training.
These studies suggest that how coaches and support staff
manage key stages of training and competition (e.g. the
periodization of starting players, the length of offseason/
midseason breaks) has significant implications regarding
Training Load and Fatigue Marker Associations with Injury and Illness

 the maintenance of performance and reduction of injury. A
specific example is the management of training/competi-
tion load of team-sport athletes during the domestic season,
taking into account international and/or club competitions
towards the latter end of that season [112].
4.2.4 Training–Injury Prevention Paradox
The results of this study support recent publications on the
training–injury prevention paradox [103, 108, 131, 143,
145–148], whereby moderate relationships were identified
between training loads and injury, yet there was disparity
regarding the direction of findings (i.e. whether increased
training load was associated with decreased or increased
injury). For example, Brooks et al. [41] found that although
higher external acute training volumes (
\
6.3 h/week vs.
high [ 9.1 h/week) did not necessarily increase elite rugby
union match injury incidence, they were associated with
increased severity of all injuries, especially during the
latter part of the season and the second half of matches.
Linear increases in acute internal training load (1245 AU)
were associated with increased injury risk in a group of
elite rugby union players [72] but decreased injury risk in
28 elite cricketers [57]. As well as linear training load–
injury relationships, ‘U-shaped’ relationships (a phe-
nomenon described in other scientific fields [114, 115])
were evident in several studies. For example, Dennis et al.
[56] showed that bowling between 123 and 188 balls had
lower injury risk than bowling \
123/
[
188 balls. This
U-shaped relationship may be due to low training loads
failing to provide sufficient stimulus for attaining ‘ac-
quired resistance’ to injury [56], and high training loads
fatiguing athletes to the point where musculoskeletal tis-
sue is less able to deal with the forces it encounters during
activity [116, 117]. As with negative and positive linear
training load–injury relationships, an inverted U-shaped
relationship pattern [118, 119] was also elicited. For
example, Arnason et al. [40] found moderate acute match
and training exposures to have higher injury rates when
compared with low and high exposures in elite soccer
players. Collision injury rates were also higher in mod-
erate-length
recovery
cycles
(8 days)
versus
low
(
\
8 days) and high (
[
8 days) recovery cycles in 51 elite
rugby league players.
Another potential reason for the disparity between the
findings of the relationship between training load and injury,
such as the negative/positive linear and U/inverted-U pat-
terns, is that the majority of studies report the magnitude of
external load (e.g. distance or duration), but not the intensity.
Increased external intensity (e.g, velocity of running and
load lifted) and internal intensity (e.g. RPE and heart rate)
will increase the stress placed on the body and therefore
potentially increase injury risk [116, 120, 121]. For example,
both Owen et al. [67] and Mallo and Dellal [55] showed
increases in training intensity, measured via heart rate, to be
associated with increased injury. Gabbett and Ullah [34] also
found that when[
9 m of sprinting (
[
7 m/s) per session was
performed in elite rugby league players, this resulted in a
2.7-fold greater relative risk of sports performance non-
contact, soft-tissue injury when compared with \
9 m. In
contrast to distances at sprinting velocity, it was found that
sessions that had greater distances covered for very-low-
intensity (0–1 m/s) and low-intensity running velocities
(1–3 m/s) were associated with a reduced risk of time-loss
non-contact injury. Low training intensity, such as that
reported by Buist et al. [35] (i.e. ‘‘All were advised to run at
a comfortable pace at which they could converse without
losing breath’’), may also account for increases in external
training load of 23.7 %/week not being associated with
increased injury versus 10 %/week increases. These lower
intensities reported by Buist et al. and Gabbett et al. may
have provided a recovery stimulus [8, 122] or allowed
adaptation to occur without excessively fatiguing athletes so
as to increase injury risk [116, 120].
4.2.5 Other Measures of Training Load
In addition to acute training load, other variables such as
chronic load (previous 3- or 4-week total average load)
[57, 85], monotony (total week load/SD of daily load) [74],
strain (monotony 9 total week load) [74] and the acute:-
chronic workload ratio [57] may be more robust predictors
of injury as they objectively account for accumulation of,
and variability in, training load over time. As with acute
load, both U-shaped and inverted-U-shaped relationships
were present, along with positive and negative linear
relationships for cumulative load. For example, Hulin et al.
showed a linear protective effect for high chronic external
load (previous 4-week average) [57], whereas Orchard
et al. [58] showed higher 17-day external bowling loads
(
[
100 overs) to increase injury risk 1.8-fold. Cross et al.
[72] have also noted a U-shaped relationship with 4-week
cumulative internal load, with an apparent increase in risk
associated with higher internal loads (
[
8651 AU). In
contrast, Colby et al. [85] found an inverted-U external
load–injury relationship using 3-weekly total running dis-
tance; between 73 and 87 km was associated with 5.5-fold
greater intrinsic (non-contact) injury risk in elite AF
players when compared with low (
\
73 km) and high
(
[
87 km) distances. The difference in patterns highlighted
may be injury type-specific, as highlighted by Orchard
et al. [59] in their review of the effects of cumulated load in
235 elite cricket fast bowlers over the longest period of
study in the current literature (15 years). Previous 3-month
load was found to be protective for tendon injury but
injurious with respect to bone-stress injury. Increased

 previous season load was also associated with increased
joint injuries but provided a protective effect for muscle
injuries. Only one previous study found associations
between illness and monotony and strain levels [74].
‘Spikes’ in training monotony (
[
2.0) and strain levels were
associated with rates of 77 and 89 %, respectively, in
relation to illness [74]; however, no other studies reported
any associations between injury/illness and monotony and
strain levels [73, 106]. The results of our review have
highlighted conflicting evidence for the use of monotony
and strain. The weight of evidence favouring other metrics,
such as change in acute training load [57, 72, 84, 87], and
chronic training load [44, 45, 59] indicate that the role of
monotony and strain in monitoring and injury prevention is

 not currently supported by the literature. A potential
improvement on using acute and chronic load in isolation
to predict injury is the acute:chronic workload ratio mea-
sure as it takes into account both acute and cumulative
workload by expressing acute load relative to the cumu-
lative load to which athletes are accustomed [57, 107]. The
only study to use the acute:chronic workload ratio in this
current review found that an acute:chronic ratio of 2.0,
when compared with 0.5–0.99 for internal and external
training load, was associated with 3.3- to 4.5-fold increased
risk of non-contact injury in elite cricket fast bowlers [57].
4.3 Fatigue Markers and Injury
Only nine studies investigated fatigue–injury relationships,
seven
of
which
used
perceptual
wellness
scales
[37, 39, 80, 92–95]. Three studies used the Hassles and
Uplifts Scale (HUS) [123] and showed greater daily hassles
to be associated with increased injury in soccer players
[37, 92, 93]. Findings from Kinchington et al. [94] support
the notion that increased perceptual fatigue is related to
increased injury as ‘poor’ scores on the Lower-Limb
Comfort Index (LLCI) [124] (i.e. an increase in perceptual
fatigue) were related to increased lower-limb injury
(r = 0.88; p \ 0.001) in elite contact-sport athletes. Laux
et al. [95] further support the positive perceptual fatigue–
injury relationship in their findings, which reported that
increased fatigue and disturbed breaks, as well as decreased
sleep-quality ratings, were related to increased injury. In
contrast, Killen et al. [80] found increased perceptual
fatigue (measured via worse ratings of perceptual sleep,
food, energy, mood, and stress) was associated with
decreased training injury during an elite rugby league
preseason (r = 0.71; p = 0.08). Similarly, King et al. [39]
showed increased perceptual fatigue (measured via various
REST-Q factors) was associated with decreased sports
performance training injuries and time-loss match injuries.
These unexpected findings may be due to the fact that when
players perceive themselves to be less fatigued they may
train/play at higher intensities, increasing injury likelihood
[80]. Of the seven studies mentioned above, six used per-
ceptual wellness scales that take approximately 1–4 min to
complete. Shorter wellness scales, such as the 1–10 ratings
used by Killen et al. [80], that have \
1 min completion
time may be easier to implement [125]; therefore, there is
great practical significance in their association with injury.
However, the differences in the levels of evidence for
validation between psychometric tools and ‘bespoke’

 wellness questionnaires are important factors when con-
sidering their use in an applied setting. The benefits of
using REST-Q compared with shorter wellness scale
questionnaires reflect the fact that REST-Q has undergone
extensive tests of rigor, whereas the latter are not as well-
validated [39, 139]. Examination of subjective fatigue
markers also indicates that current self-report measures
fare better than their commonly used objective counterparts
[139]. In particular, subjective well-being typically wors-
ened with an acute increase in training load and chronic
training load, whereas subjective well-being demonstrated
improvement when acute training load decreased [139].
Sleep is a vital part of the body’s recovery process
[126, 127], therefore it was surprising that only four studies
investigated its relationship with injury [39, 80, 95, 96].
Three studies assessed sleep–injury relationships via sleep-
quality ratings [39, 80, 95], with only Dennis et al. [96]
investigating objective measures of sleep quality and
quantity in relation to injury. No significant differences in
sleep duration and efficiency were reported between the
week of injury and 2 weeks prior to injury.
4.4 Individual Characteristics and Injury
An important finding from this review is that the individual
characteristics of the athlete [36, 128] will significantly
impact the internal load and stress placed on the body and
thus the athlete’s susceptibility to injury. For example, an
athlete’s aerobic fitness level will impact the internal
workload they place on themselves. A recent study in AF
players reported that for every 1 s slower on the 2-km time-
trial performance, there was an increase in sRPE of 0.2.
Therefore, the better the time trial performance of the
individual, the easier the sessions of the same distances
were rated [129]. Furthermore, older athletes or athletes
with a previous injury are at a significantly greater risk of
injury
than
other
members
of
their
population
[27, 40, 84, 112, 130]. A potential reason for this finding is
that it is likely older players have experienced a greater
number of injuries across the course of their careers than
the less experienced younger players [131]. Other indi-
vidual characteristics, such as body composition, have a
significant impact on injury. Zwerver et al. [128] reported a
higher risk of RRI among persons with a body mass index
(BMI) above 25 kg/m2, which is in agreement with Buist
et al., who reported higher BMI scores in injured runners
versus non-injured runners (BMI 27.6 vs. 24.8 kg/m2;
p = 0.03) [35]. In addition, decreases in aerobic power and
muscular power, as well as increases in skinfold thickness
towards the end of the playing season, have been reported
alongside increased match injury rates in recreational
rugby league players [36]. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the load/fatigue–injury associations described
in this review are significantly influenced by the individual
characteristics of the athlete, such as strength, fitness, body
composition, playing level, age and injury history, as they
determine the amount of internal workload and stress
placed on the body and therefore the subsequent reduction
or increase in the risk of injury [27, 35, 36, 40, 84,
112, 128–130].
4.5 Training Load and Illness
Monitoring of training load and illness accounted for 17 of
68 studies in this review, with the majority measuring
salivary immunoglobulin (Ig) A (s-IgA) and/or cortisol
(n = 13) as a marker of immune function. The following
section discusses the relationship between monitoring
training load and key phases identified with increasing the
susceptibility of the athlete to illness.
4.5.1 Intensification of Training Load and Illness
Internal training load, measured via sRPE, explained
between 77 and 89 % of illness prevalence over a period of
6 months to 3 years in a mixed-ability group of swimmers
[74]. Piggott et al. [68] identified that if weekly internal
training load was increased by more than 10 %, this
explained 40 % of illness and injury in the subsequent
7 days. This could be associated with elevated psycho-
logical stressors from increased internal training load and
factors that were significantly associated with signs and
symptoms of injury and illness [50]. Cunniffe et al. [54]
reported that periods of increased training intensity and
reduced game activity just prior to competition resulted in
peaks in upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in elite
rugby union players. Despite the consensus that intensified
periods in load or reduced game/training activity increased
URTI, there was a contradiction in the literature as to
whether increases in external load and markers of immune
function
were
associated
with
the
risk
of
illness
[69, 97–99]. For example, Fricker et al. [69] found no
significant differences in mean weekly and monthly run-
ning distances in elite male distance runners who self-re-
ported illness versus those who did not. With the exception
of Fricker et al. [69] and Veugelers et al. [70], the majority
of studies that have found no association between load and
illness have used mixed ability or disability populations,
only measured external load, and used self-reported illness.
Therefore, as the individual responses to load will vary
dramatically with athlete training level, this may impact on
illness rates. Furthermore, having athletes self-report ill-
nesses rather than being diagnosed by a team doctor, and
self-reporting load rather than having it measured objec-
tively in terms of external load, may have a significant
impact on the results (depending on the individual’s
Training Load and Fatigue Marker Associations with Injury and Illness
967
123
 perception of what illness is and the potential for over- or
underreporting of the amount of training exposure).
4.6 Fatigue and Illness
Mackinnon and Hooper [49] found the incidence of URTI
to be lower in athletes who reported increased perceptual
fatigue via the 1–7 wellness rating scales (sleep quality,
stress and feelings of fatigue). This study concurs with
Killen et al. [80] who found lower injury rates in rugby
league athletes who reported increased perceptual fatigue
via perceptual wellness scales of 1–10. This is further
supported by Veugelers et al. [70] who found that increased
perceptual fatigue in their elite AF high internal training
load group caused a protective effect against non-contact
injury and illness when compared with the low internal
training load group. This reduced injury/illness could be
possibly due to greater fatigue resulting in a reduction in
intensity, as a result of the physiological and psychological
stress placed on the body. Another possibility is that the
high internal training load group adapted to the load and
were therefore able to tolerate higher internal load at a
reduced risk of injury/illness. Finally, the lower training
load associated with illness may be due to the fact that
athletes could have had their training load modified as a
result of being ill earlier in the week.
4.6.1 Markers of Immune Function and Illness
A primary finding was the association between s-IgA
reduction and increased salivary cortisol due to periods of
greater
training
intensities
or
reduced
game/training
activity (preseason, deload weeks), resulting in significant
increases in URTI [54, 81, 83, 87, 90, 98, 101]. For
example, rugby players who sustained a URTI, when
compared with players who did not, had a reduction in
s-IgA by 15 % [54]. However, there was contradiction
within the literature on whether reduction in s-IgA was
linked with URTI as Ferrari et al. [73] found no significant
association between training load phase, s-IgA and sus-
tained URTI in sub-elite male road cyclists. This is in
agreement with Leicht et al. [99] who found secretion rate
had no significant relationship with s-IgA responses and
subsequent occurrence of upper respiratory symptoms in
elite wheelchair rugby athletes.
4.7 The Latent Period of Illness
A key phase identified with illness was the latency period,
which can be defined as the time interval between a
stimulus and a reaction [13]. At the onset of a stimulus,
such as a spike in training load, reductions can occur in
s-IgA or the elevation of salivary cortisol levels for an
extended period of 7–21 days. Failure of these markers to
return to baseline values during this time period was
associated
with
a
50 %
increased
risk
of
URTI
[68, 90, 100], which would explain why the majority of
illnesses reported in this review occurred during or after
week 4 of intensified training [81, 83, 90, 100, 101].
Athletes who do not recover from the initial spike in
training load experience an extended period of suppres-
sion of immune function, placing the athlete at a signif-
icant risk of illness. This finding has implications for
practitioners; first, to avoid unplanned spikes in training
load and, second, to adjust training loads when an athlete
is immunosuppressed to allow the markers of immune
system to return to baseline values.
4.8 Limitations
Of the 68 studies included in this review, 39 were only
highlighted from the search criteria, with an additional 29
included from searching references of the identified stud-
ies, which could have led to the risk of studies not being
included. Furthermore, during the manuscript review pro-
cess, a number of key studies and reviews were published
that would have satisfied the inclusion criteria and provided
the most up-to-date research [13, 131, 144, 146, 148]. For
example, several papers readdressed terminology issues in
relation to use of the training stress balance measure, and
defined
it
as
the
acute:chronic
workload
ratio
[108, 143, 145, 146, 148].
4.9 Directions for Future Research
4.9.1 Definition of Load, Fatigue, Injury and Soreness
Even with the relatively small amount of research under-
taken regarding longitudinal monitoring, the research
detailed in this review clearly highlights that relationships
exist between longitudinally monitored training load and
fatigue variables and injury or illness. Further research is
now required to establish a common language for load,
fatigue, injury and illness, as well as exploring these rela-
tionships within more specialised populations, and with a
wider range of load, fatigue, injury and illness measures.
4.9.2 Training Load and Fatigue Interactions
A clear gap identified in the literature from the current
review is the lack of assessment of load–fatigue interac-
tions in association with injury/illness, as the fatigue state
of an individual will essentially define the load they can
tolerate before injury/illness risk increases [121, 132]. For
example, a case study on a female masters track and field
athlete found that, despite no increase in load, signs of
968
C. M. Jones et al.
123
 overreaching increased significantly due to external psy-
chological stress [133]. Therefore, further study is needed
combining both load and fatigue in analyses, as per the
study by Main et al. [50].
4.9.3 Monitoring of Neuromuscular Function
The lack of monitoring of NMF variables in respect to
injury and illness (n = 0 of the 68 studies included within
this review) was highly surprising given the strong theo-
retical
rationale
for its association with injury
risk
[120, 134] and its common use in the recovery and acute
monitoring literature [7, 135, 136] in light of its strong
association with performance variables such as speed
[137]. Future research should investigate the relationship
between NMF variables and training load, and their con-
sequent associations between injury and illness; however,
there is currently no high-level evidence to support its use
in monitoring as mechanism-based reasoning represents the
lowest form of evidence [151].
4.9.4 Perceptual Wellness
Of the 13 studies that used perceptual wellness measures,
11 adopted inventories that take approximately 1–4 min to
complete. In a busy elite athlete environment or, con-
versely,
a
recreational/sub-elite
environment
where
resources are stretched, inventories of such length may be
impractical to implement [125]. Shorter wellness scales,
such as the 1–10 rating scales used by Killen et al. [80] and
the 1–7 rating scales used by MacKinnon and Hooper [49],
that have \
1 min completion time may be easier to
implement [125]. Consequently, more investigation is
needed using shortened perceptual wellness scales as there
is great practical significance in their association with
injury; however, these should undergo suitable tests of their
validation in order to ensure they are able to detect the
intended domains and constructs in a rigorous manner.
4.9.5 Latent Period of Injury
This review highlighted a lack of studies reporting the
latency period of injury. Future studies evaluating the
relationship between training load and time frame of injury
response will provide information that allows practitioners
to adjust training loads during the injury time frame as an
injury prevention measure [149].
4.9.6 Injury and Illness
Monitoring
of
load–fatigue
and
injury
and
illness
accounted for only 6 of the 68 studies in this review.
Although studies investigating both injury and illness
accounted for \
10 % of the research in this review, the
majority (five of six) were above the average quality
score (13 vs. 11) (Table 3). Future research should
therefore look to measure both injury and illness, not
only because of the higher quality scores accorded to
studies that did so in this review but also because of the
different relationships they will highlight between load
and fatigue markers and subsequent injury risk and
performance outcomes [29, 110, 138].
4.9.7 Monitoring of Female Athletes
This review has highlighted a lack of studies with female
athletes (13 of 68 studies). Further research is essential
to understand how the hormonal fluctuations during
various stages of the menstrual cycle may influence
tolerance to training load, and the subsequent effects on
markers of immune function and fatigue markers. This
will provide valuable information on load and fatigue
and inform the periodization of female athletes to help
reduce the risk of injury/illness during periods of greater
susceptibility.
4.9.8 Monitoring of Adolescent Athletes
Although this review has highlighted a lack of studies in
adolescents, a recent review found that the relationship
between workload, physical performance, injury and illness
in adolescent male football players was non-linear and that
the individual response to a given workload is highly
variable [150]. Further investigation into the effects of
maturation and training loads, and their relationship
between
performance,
injury
and
illness,
would
be
invaluable for practitioners working with pediatric athletes.
4.9.9 Session Rate of Perceived Exertion
The widespread use of sRPE as a measure of internal
training load is most likely due to its relative ease of
implementation compared with other internal load mea-
sures, such as heart rate or external load measures from
GPS systems [17]. Indeed, a recent review has highlighted
that current self-report measures fare better than their
commonly used objective counterparts [139]. To advance
the use of self-reported measures, splitting sRPE into
internal respiratory and muscular load is also warranted to
observe
how
such
discrepancies
affect
injury/illness
[140, 141]. The injury/illness mechanisms will differ
between these two systems and such differential measure-
ment of internal load will allow more specified information
for prevention and recovery [140].

 4.9.10 Severity of Injury
Only a small number of studies in this review investigated
the severity of injury [38, 41, 45–47, 67, 77] and illness
[75, 82], with only two studies quantifying the contact ele-
ments of training/competition [64, 65]. Given contact inju-
ries are often more severe than non-contact injuries [41], and
the amount of time lost from training/competition is one of
the major negative impacts of injury/illness, more studies are
needed detailing load/fatigue–injury/illness severity and the
contact aspects of training/competition. Information on
injury/illness severity relationships will allow coaches and
support staff to make even more informed decisions about
the risk of going beyond thresholds of load/fatigue, such that
they may accept an increased risk of sports performance or
low-severity injuries, but not accept increases in the risk of
more severe injuries.
5 Conclusions
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the litera-
ture that has reported the monitoring of longitudinal
training load and fatigue and its relationship with injury
and illness. The current findings highlight disparity in the
terms used to define training load, fatigue, injury and ill-
ness, as well as a lack of investigation of fatigue and
training load interactions. Key stages of training and
competition where the athlete is at an increased risk of
injury/illness risk were identified. These included periods
of training load intensification, accumulation of training
load and acute change in load. Modifying training load
during these periods may help reduce the potential for
injury and illness. Measures such as acute change in
training load, cumulative training load, monotony, strain
and acute:chronic workload ratio may better predict injury/
illness than simply the use of acute training load. Acute
change in training load showed a clear positive relationship
with injury, with other load/fatigue measures producing
mixed associations, particularly acute and cumulative
training load. The measure most clearly associated with
illness was s-IgA, while relationships for acute training
load, monotony, strain and perceptual wellness were
mixed. The prescription of training load intensity and
individual characteristics (e.g. fitness, body composition,
playing level, injury history and age) may account for the
mixed findings reported as they impact the internal training
load placed on the athlete’s body and, therefore, suscepti-
bility to injury/illness.
