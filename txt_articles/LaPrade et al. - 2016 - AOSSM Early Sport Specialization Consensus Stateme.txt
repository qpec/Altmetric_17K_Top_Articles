Background: Early sport specialization is not a requirement for success at the highest levels of competition and is believed
to be unhealthy physically and mentally for young athletes. It also discourages unstructured free play, which has many
benefits.
Purpose: To review the available evidence on early sports specialization and identify areas where scientific data are lacking.
Study Design: Think tank, roundtable discussion.
Results: The primary outcome of this think tank was that there is no evidence that young children will benefit from early sport
specialization in the majority of sports. They are subject to overuse injury and burnout from concentrated activity. Early multisport
participation will not deter young athletes from long-term competitive athletic success.
Conclusion: Youth advocates, parents, clinicians, and coaches need to work together with the sport governing bodies to ensure
healthy environments for play and competition that do not create long-term health issues yet support athletic competition at the
highest level desired.
Keywords: early sports specialization; consensus; youth sports
Despite mounting scientific evidence and professional ath-
letes speaking out against its value, the trend of early
sports specialization continues with tournaments and com-
petitive leagues increasingly available as well as wider
media exposure (eg, The Short Game [7- to 8-year-old gol-
fers], Friday Night Tykes [Texas Youth Football]). Early
sports specialization, or early single-sport specialization,
is believed to be potentially damaging to the long-term
physical and mental health of athletes and has not been
validated as a requirement for competitive success in
sport.3 Early youth sport specialization has been associ-
ated with increased rates of overuse injury, burnout,
decreased motivation for participation, and sports with-
drawal,19,33,34,43 while multisport participation is pro-
posed to result in better long-term performance and an
increase in lifetime enjoyment of physical activity and
recreational sports participation.2
With these issues in mind, the American Orthopaedic
Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) convened a think
tank on the topic of early sports specialization on October
2, 2015, in Rosemont, Illinois. This report represents the
consensus of the participants of this meeting; importantly,
it identifies areas where more research is necessary to
address the outstanding questions surrounding this topic
(Appendix 1) and achieve the goal of healthy athletic par-
ticipation through adulthood at the highest level of partic-
ipation desired.
DEFINITION OF EARLY SPORTS SPECIALIZATION
AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION
It was the consensus at this symposium that early sports
specialization, or early single-sport specialization, be
defined by the following 3 criteria:
1.
Participation in intensive training and/or competi-
tion in organized sports greater than 8 months per
year (essentially year round)34
2.
Participation in 1 sport to the exclusion of participa-
tion in other sports (limited free play overall)33
3.
Involving prepubertal (seventh grade or roughly age
12 years) children.

 WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT EARLY
SPORTS SPECIALIZATION IS DETRIMENTAL?
A variety of researchers and organizations have investi-
gated the impact of early sports specialization on long-
term health and future sport success. The consensus
statement of the American Medical Society for Sports
Medicine19 on overuse injuries and burnout in youth
sports contends that a variety of physical and mental
health concerns can be attributed to early sports specia-
lization. In their position statement, they identify the
concerns listed in Table 1.
Their recommendations for avoiding burnout and injury
include the following:
�
Avoiding
overscheduling
and
excessive
time
commitments
�
Consider using a valid and reliable tool to monitor
burnout
�
Emphasize skill development and fun
�
Emphasize lifelong physical activity skills.
The International Olympic Committee8 also published a
consensus statement on youth athletic development. Their
goal was to develop healthy, capable, and resilient young
athletes while attaining widespread inclusive, sustainable,
and enjoyable participation and success for all levels of
athletic achievement. They identified several physical and
mental health concerns associated with youth athletic

 talent development, including insufficient sleep, increased
overuse injury rates, overtraining, burnout, and eating dis-
orders. They recommended that children be encouraged to
participate in a variety of different activities and develop a
wide range of skills and avoid specialization until at least
puberty. They recommended focusing on the integration of
strength and neuromuscular fitness in conjunction with the
development of the entire athlete in terms of competence,
confidence, connection, and character.
Researchers have suggested that early specialization iso-
lates the young athlete from their peers (interferes with
normal identity development) and increases the potential
for burnout or withdrawal from sport as a result of chronic
stress.11,43 Athletes who experience burnout are character-
ized by a loss of motivation and especially have decreased
intrinsic motivation, a lack of enjoyment, high perceived
stress and anxiety, ineffective or limited stress coping stra-
tegies, and mood disturbances.23,24
Several types of burnout have been identified.25,26 One of
these is social psychological in nature and is driven by fac-
tors such as perfectionism in the young athlete or excessive
coach and/or parental pressure to perform. The other type
is driven by physical factors, such as overtraining and lack
of sleep. Research suggests, then, that while high training
loads are certainly involved in athlete burnout, other per-
sonal and situational factors of a social psychological
nature also play a very important role.20,25,26 Recent evi-
dence also suggests that monitoring the balance between
intensive sports participation/specialization and other
childhood commitments such as friends, school, and extra-
curricular activities is important to consider in determining
the health and wellness status of young athletes.20
Studies directly linking youth sports specialization to
psychosocial outcomes are lacking. However, the available
evidence suggests youth specialization before the age of 12
years is associated with increased burnout and dropout
rates and decreased athletic development over time.22
Importantly, there is a lack of evidence that early speciali-
zation is necessary for adult elite performance. In a
German study, 88% of Olympians reported participating
in more than 1 sport as a child.28 Work by Gu
¨llich and
Emrich27 evaluated 1558 German national squad athletes
in Olympic sports and reported that a great training vol-
ume in other sports beyond the individual’s current main
sport was associated with great long-term success in an
elite sport (unpublished data, 2006). In addition, 97% of
professional athletes believed being a multisport athlete
was beneficial to their success in another study.39
One factor driving the emphasis on early specialization is
the increasingly common practice of early talent identifica-
tion/selection. Researchers in this area note that talent
identification is difficult at all phases of development, but
particularly difficult to identify before puberty. The avail-
able evidence reviewed at this meeting does not support the
belief that early sports specialization is a requirement
(gymnastics and figure skating may be examples of excep-
tions because the top tiers of competition tend to occur dur-
ing the teenage years to the early 20s). Diversification of
sports during childhood results in increased long-term par-
ticipation, increased adult performance, and increased per-
sonal development.17 Moreover, early diversification does
not seem to hinder elite-level participation in sports where
peak performance occurs after maturation.4 A transition
period seems to occur around the end of primary school
(at age approximately 13 years). Playing sport without the
consistent intervention of coaches (youth-led activities like
play) has also been identified as necessary to develop good
skill levels prior to this age.
IS EARLY SPECIALIZATION NECESSARY
FOR ELITE PERFORMANCE?
Support for early specialization comes from the assumption
that early training experiences distinguish those who
become experts/elites from those who do not. Much of the
recent rhetoric regarding early sports specialization can be
traced to studies of ‘‘deliberate practice,’’ a specific form of
training proposed by Ericsson and colleagues21 more than 2
decades ago. Deliberate practice is highly effortful and rel-
evant to performance improvement, and Ericsson et al21
proposed that anyone beginning deliberate practice early
would have a benefit over peers starting later. Despite the
consistent evidence for the value of deliberate practice for
athlete development in general,6 there is very little support
for the necessity of high amount of deliberate practice dur-
ing childhood for the development of adults’ elite perfor-
mance. Comparisons of experts and nonexperts in field
hockey,29 soccer,29 and triathlon5 found that differences
in training profiles did not occur until age 13, 15, and
20 years, respectively. Although there may be specific
sports where early specialization is required due to early
ages of peak performance (eg, gymnastics, figure skating,
diving), the overall evidence supporting early specializa-
tion, as a general requirement for elite performance in
sport where peak performance is achieved in adulthood, is
not convincing. It is felt that some, but not all, athletes in
early entry sports such as women’s gymnastics, figure skat-
ing, and dance may benefit from specialization because
their peak competitive levels generally occur before full
maturity. These sports may lend themselves to be at the

 forefront of the effort to reset competitive expectations so
that early specialization would not be necessary to meet the
expectations of the sport.
WHAT RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE TO DATE?
Several models of athlete development in sport have been
proposed in the literature to explain long-term participa-
tion and performance in sport.1,12,41,44 Systematic review
studies of athletes’ development models9,10 have reported
that the Developmental Model of Sport Participation
(DMSP)12,14 is the most prominent conceptualization of
athletes’ development within the sports literature. The
DMSP is a conceptual framework that integrates the devel-
oping athlete in its environment with processes that focus
on early diversification and play.
The different stages of the DMSP are based on changes in
the type and amount of involvement in different sports,
deliberate play, and deliberate practice throughout an ath-
lete’s career.16 It is composed of a series of 7 postulates
associated with the different pathways and outcomes of the
DMSP. The postulates highlight the efficiency of sport pro-
grams to develop adult elite performance, continued partic-
ipation, and personal development based on early sampling
(postulates 1, 2, and 3), deliberate play (postulates 4 and 5),
and key transitions throughout development (postulates 6
and 7). The DMSP and its postulates (Table 2) integrate the
various outcomes of sport—performance, participation, and
personal development—by focusing on key proximal pro-
cesses (deliberate play, deliberate practice, and early
sampling) and the environment in which the processes are
occurring (role of coaches, peers, and parents).
A review of the evidence that supports these postulates
can be found in recent publications.13,17 In sum, the DMSP
and its 7 postulates are based on a developmental approach
that features the interaction of variables at the activity
(eg, deliberate play, diversification) and the environment
levels (eg, sport setting, coaching) that have strong impli-
cations for youth sport policies.15
The current evidence supports the contention that chil-
dren should be encouraged to take part in a variety of sports
at levels consistent with their abilities and interests to best
attain the physical, psychological, and social benefits of
sport.36 Children who specialize early (eg, prior to matura-
tion) in a single sport may execute less age-appropriate
sports skills, especially when they do not participate in as
many youth-led activities (eg, deliberate play) as their
peers. Without opportunities to experience sport diversifi-
cation, children may not fully develop neuromuscular pat-
terns that may be protective of injury. Based on the
cumulative evidence, sport specialization was concluded
to be a real issue that will very likely continue to occur in
many sports. The authors recommend the inclusion of
diverse opportunities for motor skill development during
the growing years, combined with planned integrative neu-
romuscular training to help optimize the potential for suc-
cess and reduced injury risk in young athletes (Figure 1).37
It is well accepted that youth-driven play has shifted
greatly toward parent- and coach-driven activities recently
at the expense of free play (N. Jayanthi, personal commu-
nication, October 15, 2015). Athletes who come from high
median incomes (>US$70,000 per year) and who have pri-
vate insurance have an increased risk of early sports spe-
cialization (N. Jayanthi, personal communication, October
15, 2015). Moreover, athletes who utilize private facilities
are often encouraged to participate year round because
those facilities are businesses that require income.
It is also important to recognize that chronological age is
not equal to developmental age (Figure 2). For increased
organized play over free play, there has also been reported
to be a greater than 2 to 1 increased injury rate.34 Athletes
who specialize before the age of 12 years also may have a
trend toward greater risks of being injured (N. Jayanthi,
personal communication, October 15, 2015). Increased ath-
lete exposure has a linear relationship to adjusted injury
rate in high school athletes. For ice hockey, there is an
increased dropout rate for those who participate in off-ice
training at younger ages.
An increased risk of hip injury has been shown in hockey
players as they move through the ranks of organized
hockey. As hockey players reached the midget level, with
increased age and increased participation in hockey, the
prevalence of factors associated with labral tears in the hip
increased. When matched with skiers of the same age,
hockey players had significantly higher prevalence of fac-
tors associated with labral tears in the hip. This study
showed that risk factors may not only include years of play
but may also include sports that put the hip at risk in young
athletes.38 Increased years of play was also a factor in
young tennis players. A total of 148 youth tennis players
TABLE 2
Seven Postulates Associated With the Different Pathways
of the Development Model of Sport Participationa
Postulate 1: Early diversification does not hinder elite sport
participation in sports where peak performance is reached after
maturation.
Postulate 2: Early diversification is linked to a longer sport career
and has positive implications for long-term sport involvement.
Postulate 3: Early diversification allows participation in a range
of contexts that most favorably affects positive youth
development.
Postulate 4: High amounts of deliberate play during the sampling
years build a solid foundation of intrinsic motivation through
involvement in activities that are enjoyable and promote
intrinsic regulation.
Postulate 5: A high amount of deliberate play during the
sampling years establishes a range of motor and cognitive
experiences that children can ultimately bring to their principal
sport of interest.
Postulate 6: Around the end of primary school (about age
13 years), children should have the opportunity to choose to
either specialize in their favorite sport or continue in sport at a
recreational level.
Postulate 7: Late adolescents (around age 16 years) have
developed the physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and motor
skills needed to invest their effort into highly specialized
training in one sport.

 were screened. Players were defined at risk of femoroace-
tabular impingement (FAI) if they had a positive anterior
impingement test, a positive FABER (flexion, abduction,
external rotation) distance test, or decreased internal rota-
tion. Those players who had hips at risk played tennis lon-
ger compared with those without hips at risk (9.5 years
compared with 8.6 years).18
Biomechanical Issues
Practitioners, trainers, parents, coaches, and athletes
should be aware of the nonmodifiable risk factors that may
predispose some athletes to a greater risk of injury. In the
knee, anatomic factors include genu recurvatum, valgus
alignment, increased lateral tibial slope greater than 4
degrees, and increased Beighton score.7 These factors have
been reported to be associated with a greater risk of knee
injury. For elbow injuries associated with throwing sports,
poor throwing mechanics such as increased trunk lean,
improper stride, and ‘‘opening up early’’ are risk factors for
elbow injury.40 However, it is important to recognize that
high throwing velocity increases elbow valgus moment, and
younger pitchers may put greater forces on the medial
elbow and be at a greater risk for injury.
DISCUSSION
The topic of early sport specialization is receiving signifi-
cant attention in the media.42 There is a false or overstated
importance of sports as it relates to individual roles in
society; sports may be a financial bonanza for a very few
but not the masses. The historical context of the need for
large amounts of sport-specific practice may stem from the
10,000-hour rule,21 but research has not substantiated this
as a requirement for athletic success. One potential cause of
this early sport specialization is that in North America par-
ticularly there is a competitive varsity school sports pro-
gram and ‘‘select’’ teams which, while allowing for
multisport participation, are often combined with non-
school sport teams. There is an expectation for better ath-
letes to participate in school teams as well as community
(eg, regional, state) teams, which may set up these athletes
to over-train. There is also a push for college scholarships
where 14- and 15-year-olds are now committing to colleges
based on their early teenage sports performance.
The biggest roadblock to making this culture shift may
be the acknowledgement of coaches and parents that chil-
dren are participating too early in sports, but ‘‘this doesn’t
apply to ‘my’ sport or ‘my’ child.’’ This consensus meeting
emphasized that we need to reset expectations of when
competitive events occur and the level of difficulty or skill
expected at each age level. Sports that have taken on this
task with varying degrees of success are ice hockey in
Canada and tennis in the United States.30 In the United
States, an ideal training program for safe development in a
high-level junior tennis player has been recommended as
follows32:
�
Minimum 12-year-old junior tournament player
�
Play less than 12 hours a week of organized tennis
�
Participate in less than 12 tournaments a year
�
Possibly consider another sport (soccer) with an off-
season for tennis
�
Participate in 2þ hours a week of injury prevention
training
However, within the current ranking system for ath-
letes that tennis uses, this program will not allow an ath-
lete to maintain a high ranking, highlighting a built-in
contradiction.
Current recommendations for athletes who are involved
in early sports specialization are as follows37:

tation of integrative neuromuscular training. Reprinted with

 �
Children who participate in more hours per week
than their age, for more than 16 hours per week in
intense training, and who are specialized in sport
activities should be closely monitored for indicators
of burnout, overuse injury, or potential decrements
in performance due to overtraining.31
�
All youth (including inactive youth) can benefit
from periodized strength and conditioning (eg, Inte-
grative Neuromuscular Training [INT]) to help
them prepare for the demands of competitive sport
participation.
�
Youth who specialize in a single sport should plan
periods of isolated and focused INT to enhance
diverse motor skill development and reduce injury
risk factors.
Early sports specialization has been identified as dama-
ging for the future physical and mental health of the ath-
lete. Future recommendations should include the following
points:
�
A public health message that multisport participation
will not diminish the athletic capabilities of athletes;
we need better and more effective messaging with
improved data.
�
A focused effort toward the importance of physical
education as an opportunity for noncompetitive play
and put it back into school curriculums.
�
Increased emphasis on the economic impact of a lack
of physical fitness to health care costs as presented in
obesity and various medical comorbidities.
�
Recognition that each sport has its own distinct load-
ing pattern and a distinct overuse injury to go with it.
�
Identification of the optimal level of exposure to max-
imize training effect with minimal risk of injury needs
to be identified.
�
Early sport specialization has not been shown to be
beneficial for high-caliber athletic performance at the
national team/Olympic/professional levels, and in fact
may be detrimental.

APPENDIX
Areas the Think Tank Identified Where Further Research Is Necessary
The following research suggestions were made during the
meeting.
Short term
1.
Retrospectively determine the fate of National Col-
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) scholarship
versus nonscholarship athletes (walk-on and DIII
[Division III]). The primary endpoint would be
years in sport, secondary would be injuries, time
missed due to injury. Keep in mind that attrition
happens more commonly between 10 to 15 years
old.
2.
Collect a cohort of athletes that stopped early and
ask them why they stopped.
With these data, we could answer 2 important questions
that would be relevant to the public: What happens to scho-
larship athletes when they get to college, and why do they
burn out when they leave?
3.
Which sports or injuries are highest risk? Focus on a
single sport.
4.
Develop a database that would allow for universal
tracking of key variables across sports in a longitu-
dinal fashion.
Long term
1.
Develop an F-Marc program for all sports.
2.
Make successful completion of skills a requirement
for sport participation.
3.
Is recovery (or inadequate recovery) a factor in stay-
ing healthy?
4.
Small-scale interventional project with coaches.
5.
One group with set hours of training and 1 group
with no limit—5 years of follow-up.
6.
Determine injury patterns in youth athletes and
their long-term consequences.
7.
Identify the age range at which sports specializa-
tion is clearly detrimental.
8.
Identify the age range at which sports specializa-
tion becomes beneficial to the elite athlete being
sure to define elite athlete.
9.
Biomechanical studies: Determine the sport-
specific risk of improper form on soft tissue or oss-
eous overload.
10.
Soft tissue laboratory: Understand the MSK (mus-
culoskeletal) tissue changes during adolescence.
�
How important is being ‘‘elite’’ early?
�
What are the benefits of continued multisport
activity?
�
How much training is enough?
�
How much recovery is needed?
�
What is the influence of proper biomechanics on
injury risk?
11.
Prospective multicenter cohort study evaluating
specific risks by sport and injury pathology.
12.
Quantify the amount of specialized sport training
that is not harmful to youth athletes.
13.
Age at which specialization is appropriate.
14.
Risks versus benefits of sports participation.
The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
AOSSM Consensus Statement
7
 Could specialization be protective against acute injury
through sport-specific neuromuscular control or adaptive
changes?
Some of the more important think tank questions
asked:
1.
Conduct longitudinal studies that examine long-
term participation patterns and attrition.
2.
How much recovery is needed?
3.
What are the benefits of multisport activity?
4.
How much training is enough and too much at vari-
ous ages?
5.
What is the influence of proper biomechanics on
injury risk?
Some think tank issues that need to be addressed:
1.
We need data on the performance of athletes who
specialize versus those that diversify as children.
2.
Do some sports have multiple sports within them
(eg, decathlon)?
3.
Evidence-based versus general consensus recommen-
dations.
4.
There are 3.7 million injuries per year in high school
sports. Overuse injuries are probably underesti-
mated because many of them do not result in true
time loss from sports.
5.
Overscheduling is a huge issue with multiple events
on the same day and consecutive days.
