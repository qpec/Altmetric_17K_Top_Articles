ABSTRACT 
Introduction: Physical activity (PA) conveys known cardiometabolic benefits to youth, but the 
contribution of vigorous-intensity PA (VPA) to these benefits is unknown. Therefore, we sought 
to determine, a) the associations between VPA and cardiometabolic biomarkers independent of 
moderate-intensity PA (MPA) and time sedentary, and b) the accelerometer cutpoint that best 
represents the threshold for health-promoting VPA in youth. 
Methods: Data from the International Children’s Accelerometry Database (ICAD) were 
analyzed in 2015. The relationship between cardiometabolic biomarkers and 4 categories of VPA 
estimated via 3 sets of cutpoints were examined using isotemporal substitution quantile 
regression modeling at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile of the distribution of each 
biomarker, separately. Age, sex, accelerometer wear time, sedentary time, and MPA were 
controlled for while allowing substitution for light-intensity PA. Data from 11,588 youth (4-
18yrs) from 11 ICAD studies (collected 1998-2009) were analyzed. 
Results: Only 32 of 360 significant associations were observed. Significant, negative 
relationships were observed for VPA with waist circumference and insulin. Replacing light 
intensity PA with VPA (corresponding to at the 25th to 90th percentiles of VPA) was associated 
with a .67 (-1.33, -0.01; P = .048) to 7.30cm (-11.01, -3.58; P < .001) lower waist circumference 
using Evenson and ICAD cutpoints (i.e., higher CPM). VPA levels were associated with 12.60 (-
21.28, -3.92; P = .004) to 27.03 pmol/l (-45.03, -9.03; P = .003) lower insulin levels at the 75th to 
90th percentiles using Evenson and ICAD cutpoints when substituted for light PA. 
Conclusions: Substituting light PA with VPA was inversely associated with waist circumference 
and insulin. However, VPA was inconsistently related to the remaining biomarkers after 
controlling for time sedentary and MPA.

 INTRODUCTION 
1 
Emerging research utilizing international samples (7, 17) has indicated that many children 
2 
globally are spending an insufficient amount of time engaging in physical activity (PA) and an 
3 
excessive amount of time engaging in sedentary behaviors. Engaging in international guideline  
4 
recommendations (38) of 60 minutes per day (min/day) of moderate-to-vigorous physical 
5 
activity (MVPA) is inversely associated with biomarkers of cardiometabolic health (13, 25) 
6 
including lower rates of obesity (17) independent of time spent sedentary. While the benefits of 
7 
MVPA are well established cross-sectionally (7) and longitudinally (6), few studies of PA in 
8 
youth have examined the contribution of specific intensities to the association, despite a growing 
9 
body of literature that suggests that vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) may be more 
10 
important for the prevention and amelioration of cardiometabolic risk factors (13, 39). A small 
11 
number of studies have employed an objective measure of PA to examine associations with 
12 
cardiometabolic biomarkers. These studies suggest that VPA is independently associated with 
13 
cardiorespiratory fitness (positive) (23), BMI (negative) (17), adiposity (negative) (32), HDL 
14 
cholesterol (positive) (22), fasting glucose (negative) (31), and fasting insulin (negative) (1). 
15 
However, an extensive examination of the literature suggests that the relationship between VPA 
16 
and cardiometabolic biomarkers is inconsistent, potentially due to small samples, definition of 
17 
VPA, and other methodological limitations (11). 
18 
 
19 
Complicating examinations of the relations between VPA and cardiometabolic biomarkers is an 
20 
issue of measurement of VPA, or more specifically, the threshold for which VPA occurs. While 
21 
imperfect, accelerometers are still considered one of the best objective measures available for 
22 
epidemiological studies of PA (5, 28), but the processing of data generated by accelerometers 
23 
  
5 
(e.g., “counts”) lacks uniformity or consistency across studies (18), which can lead to 
24 
misclassification of exercise intensity (12) and/or lack of comparability across studies (3, 4). 
25 
Since the choice of cutpoint is a de facto selection of an intensity threshold with all other sources 
26 
of variability held constant (e.g., monitor brand, epoch), and no standard exists for the VPA 
27 
cutpoint, it is imperative to consider a range of accelerometer cutpoints for VPA if the 
28 
relationship between VPA and cardiometabolic biomarkers is to be studied. 
29 
 
30 
The benefits of MVPA in youth are well established, but little research has been conducted to 
31 
examine the contribution of PA intensity in cardiometabolic health in youth. Therefore, the 
32 
objective of the present investigation was to determine, a) the associations between VPA and 
33 
cardiometabolic biomarkers independent of moderate physical activity (MPA) and sedentary 
34 
time, and b) the accelerometer cutpoint that best represents the threshold for health-promoting 
35 
VPA in a diverse sample of youth.

MATERIALS/SUBJECTS AND METHODS 
38 
Study Design 
39 
Data were utilized from the International Children’s Accelerometry Database (ICAD, 
40 
http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Research/Studies/), which was established to pool data on PA 
41 
from studies in youth worldwide. A comprehensive description of the ICAD can be found 
42 
elsewhere (34). Briefly, in 2008 19 studies were identified from a PubMed search that used an 
43 
Actigraph (Actigraph, LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA) accelerometer and included a minimum of 400 
44 
participants aged 3 to 18 years. Six additional studies were identified through professional 
45 
colleagues, with 21 studies ultimately contributing data to the final database (7, 34). For the 
46 
  
6 
current study, 11 studies were included (7, 34), which are presented in brief with the variables 
47 
each contributed in Table 1 [details of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children 
48 
(ALSPAC) are available at www.bris.ac.uk/alspac and including the data that are available via a 
49 
fully searchable data dictionary (http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-
50 
dictionary)]. Ethical approval for the present study was attained from participating institutions, 
51 
and data-sharing agreements were established prior to contribution of data. 
52 
  
53 
Participants 
54 
Data from 11,588 youth (4-18yrs), representing 11 studies from Brazil, Europe, and the United 
55 
States from the ICAD were analyzed. Data from studies conducted between 1998 and 2009 were 
56 
included in the present analyses if the dataset contained PA, age, sex, and at least one biomarker 
57 
of a cardiometabolic risk [defined as “A characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated 
58 
as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses 
59 
to a therapeutic intervention” (2)]. 
60 
 
61 
Measurements 
62 
Physical activity. A comprehensive description of the measurement of PA has been published 
63 
previously (34). ICAD data were reanalyzed to allow for comparability across studies by 
64 
aggregating data to a 60-second epoch. The criterion of 60 minutes of consecutive zeros was 
65 
utilized to designate non-wear time, with a tolerance for 2 minutes of nonzero epochs (35). 
66 
Participants with three or more days with 600 minutes of valid wear time were included in 
67 
analyses. VPA was defined by cutpoints from Pate (26), Evenson (8), and the ICAD workgroup 
68 
(7, 34). These cutpoints were selected because they represent the most generous, lowest 
69 
  
7 
threshold defining VPA [Pate > 3,365 counts/min (CPM)], a medium threshold (Evenson > 
70 
4,012 CPM), to the most stringent, highest threshold for VPA (ICAD > 6,000 CPM). 
71 
 
72 
Cardiometabolic biomarkers. Eight cardiometabolic biomarkers reflecting a diverse array of 
73 
health indices were collected, including; waist circumference [as a proxy for adiposity (30)]; 
74 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (hemodynamics); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-
75 
density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting triglycerides (lipid metabolism); fasting glucose and 
76 
fasting insulin (glucose metabolism). Details of data collection procedures can be found 
77 
elsewhere (7, 34). Waist circumference (WC) was assessed midway between the lower rib 
78 
margin and the iliac crest using a metal tape (10), except in the NHANES (National Health and 
79 
Nutrition Examination Survey) where WC was measured just above the iliac crest at the mid-
80 
axillary line using similar equipment (36). Resting blood pressure was measured using standard 
81 
procedures, reported previously (7). Markers of lipid and glucose metabolism were assessed 
82 
using standard clinical procedures described in detail elsewhere (36).  
83 
 
84 
Statistical Analysis 
85 
Descriptive analyses of accelerometer-derived estimates of minday-1 spent in sedentary, MPA, 
86 
and VPA were computed across all studies using three sets of cutpoints to define PA intensities. 
87 
To evaluate the cross-sectional association of cardiometabolic biomarkers and time spent in 
88 
VPA, a series of isotemporal substitution quantile regression models were estimated for each set 
89 
of cutpoints separately (20, 21, 40). Quantile regression models were employed since biomarkers 
90 
are often non-normal in their distribution, and quantile regression models are not influenced by 
91 
normality and are free from distributional assumptions (19). Individual models for each 
92 
  
8 
biomarker as the dependent variable were estimated. Time spent in VPA, defined by one of the 3 
93 
sets of cutpoints, separately, served as the primary independent variable. Because of its non-
94 
normal distribution, minday-1 spent in VPA was placed into 4 categories – none (0mins/d – 
95 
reference category), low (lower 33%), middle (middle 33%), and high (upper 33%) – based on 
96 
the distribution of VPA for each of the 3 sets of cutpoints. The relationship between cardio-
97 
metabolic biomarkers and 4 categories of VPA min/d [none (0 min/d – reference category), low 
98 
(7.2Pate, 4.0Evenson, 1.5ICAD min/d), medium (18.6Pate, 11.0Evenson, 3.5ICAD min/d), and high (42.7Pate, 
99 
28.9Evenson, 11.9ICAD min/d)] estimated via 3 sets of cutpoints [Pate: sedentary = 0 - 152 
100 
counts/min (CPM), MPA = 1677 – 3364, VPA = ≥ 3,365 CPM; Evenson: sedentary = 0 - 100 
101 
CPM, MPA = 2296 – 4011, VPA = ≥ 4,012 CPM; and ICAD: sedentary = 0 - 100 CPM, MPA = 
102 
3000 – 6000, VPA = ≥  6,001 CPM] ––were examined using isotemporal substitution quantile 
103 
regression modeled at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the distribution of each 
104 
biomarker. Included in each model were age (years), sex, average total daily wear time, and 
105 
minday-1 in sedentary and MPA distilled using the corresponding cutpoint for VPA. Since light 
106 
PA (LPA) was the only intensity excluded from the models, all estimates are interpreted as 
107 
substituting “x” amount of LPA with VPA. Separate models were estimated for each study and 
108 
for each set of cutpoints used to define VPA within each study. An example of the modeling 
109 
approach is: insulin serving as the dependent variable, with 3 separate models using VPA levels 
110 
(i.e., low, middle and high, with no VPA as the referent group) reduced with each of the sets of 
111 
cutpoints for each study, run separately. Statistical significance was set at P = .05. 
112 
 
113 
Meta-analytical techniques were used to combine the quantile regression model coefficients and 
114 
standard errors for each biomarker across the 11 studies for each of the 3 sets of cutpoints, 
115 
  
9 
separately. Random effects inverse variance weighting was used to pool effects across studies 
116 
and within study for each set of cutpoints. The study served as the unit of analysis for each 
117 
quantile and category of VPA. For instance, the VPA estimates representing the lowest 33rd of 
118 
the distribution of VPA regressed on the 10th quantile of insulin were combined across all studies 
119 
for a given biomarker. All quantile regression analyses were conducted in 2015 using Stata 
120 
(v.13.0, College Station, TX) and all meta-analytic analyses were conducted using 
121 
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (v2.2, Englewood, NJ). 
122 
 
123 
RESULTS 
124 
Descriptive information for each study is presented in Table 2. The average amount of VPA 
125 
minday-1 for each set of cutpoints (highest to lowest) by tertile ranged from 1.5 to 7.2 min/day 
126 
for the lowest tertile, the medium tertile 3.5 to 18.6 min/day, and the highest tertile 11.9 to 42.7 
127 
min/day. The results of the pooled meta-analytic effects for each quantile and level of VPA 
128 
across each cardiometabolic biomarker are presented in Table 3.  
129 
 
130 
Relationship of volume of VPA with cardiometabolic biomarkers 
131 
Substituting LPA with VPA was inconsistently related to systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 
132 
fasting triglycerides, HDL, or LDL after controlling for time sedentary and MPA at all tertiles of 
133 
VPA volume, with only 32 of a possible 360 associations statistically significant (P < .05). 
134 
Independent of minday-1 spent sedentary and in MPA, substituting LPA with VPA was 
135 
associated with a .67 to 7.30 cm smaller waist circumference at the 50th to 90th percentiles. 
136 
Relationships were observed for all three tertiles of VPA, but relationships at the lowest tertile of 
137 
VPA volume were significant at only the highest cutpoint value (i.e., ICAD). Substituting LPA 
138 
  
10 
with VPA was associated with 12.6 to 27.0 pmol/l lower insulin values at the 75th to 90th 
139 
percentiles. Relationships were observed for all three tertiles of VPA, but relationships at the 
140 
lowest tertile of VPA were significant at only the highest tertiles of VPA volume for the highest 
141 
cutpoint value (i.e., ICAD).  
142 
 
143 
Influence of cutpoint 
144 
Independent of minday-1 spent sedentary and in MPA, substituting LPA with the high volume of 
145 
VPA defined via Pate cutpoints was associated with a smaller waist circumference only at the 
146 
90th percentile. For VPA determined via Evenson cutpoints, substituting LPA for medium and 
147 
high VPA levels were associated with a smaller waist circumference at the 25th to 90th centiles. 
148 
Substituting LPA with the lowest, medium, and highest volumes of VPA reduced via ICAD 
149 
cutpoints was associated with a smaller waist circumference at the 50th to 90th, the 75th and 90th, 
150 
and the 25th to 90th, respectively. Across all other biomarkers (i.e., SBP, DBP, HDL, LDL, 
151 
glucose, and triglycerides), no consistent associations or patterns were observed, with only 9 
152 
significant associations observed from a possible 270 tested (<5%; see Figure). 
153 
 
154 
DISCUSSION 
155 
The present study is the first of this scope (e.g., sample size, diversity of national origin) to 
156 
examine the relationship between VPA and cardiometabolic biomarkers in youth. The results are 
157 
consistent with previous studies using more homogeneous samples, such as Carson et al. (6) 
158 
where no association was found between diastolic blood pressure and VPA, but a significant 
159 
negative association was reported between waist circumference and VPA in children of the 2nd 
160 
and 3rd quartiles (relative to the 1st). The more nuanced analyses presented here, taken with those 
161 
  
11 
of Carson et al. (6), provide additional insight into the complex relationship between VPA and 
162 
cardiometabolic biomarkers  (11, 25). The results suggest that substituting modest amounts of 
163 
LPA for VPA may have cardiometabolic benefits above and beyond those conveyed by MPA 
164 
and avoidance of sedentary behavior (24). Of potentially greater importance, the current results 
165 
suggest that these health supportive associations are most pronounced in those who have 
166 
undesirable levels of these biomarkers, specifically those with relatively large waist 
167 
circumference or fasting insulin levels. If these relationships are found to be robust in 
168 
longitudinal and experimental studies, then a specific frequency and duration of VPA could be 
169 
incorporated as a distinct component of a PA “prescription” for youth (24). However, it must be 
170 
noted that VPA was independently associated with only two of the markers examined. Therefore, 
171 
while VPA may relay meaningful health benefits, the number of markers exhibiting those 
172 
benefits may be few relative to less intense movement.  
173 
 
174 
These results, taken with a growing body of literature demonstrating the independent health 
175 
benefits of VPA for youth (6, 11, 14, 16, 17, 23, 24, 37), support the assertion that this intensity 
176 
should be considered when setting policy recommendations for PA of youth. For example, it has 
177 
been shown previously that as little as 9 (15) to 14 minutes (17) of VPA per day is associated 
178 
with less adiposity in Canadian (15) and multinational samples of youth (17). These previous 
179 
findings, derived from independent samples, are consistent with the present findings showing an 
180 
association of substituting 11.9 to 42.7 min/day of LPA for VPA. While this is a considerable 
181 
range, with the top end (42.7 min/day) potentially impractical, consistent benefits were seen for 
182 
VPA defined by the ICAD cutpoints, which even in the high volume category represented 11.9 
183 
min/day of VPA, is potentially achievable for most youth (39). Therefore, the present findings 
184 
  
12 
suggest a modest duration (e.g., approximately 10 min) of high intensity PA may be related to 
185 
health benefits in youth who exhibit undesirable levels of insulin or waist circumference. 
186 
 
187 
While the present study has a number of strengths, including an objective measure of PA, a large 
188 
sample size, a diverse and international sample, and an advanced analytical approach, the present 
189 
results should be considered in light of a number of limitations. First, all data were cross-
190 
sectional in nature, therefore causality cannot be assumed. For example, it is possible that 
191 
children with smaller waist circumference are more vigorously active because it is less 
192 
cumbersome for them to do so. However, the nature of our analyses, which examined the 
193 
relationship of VPA and waist circumference at different quantiles of waist circumference, is less 
194 
supportive of this possibility. Second, while these cross-sectional results are supportive of VPA 
195 
specific PA recommendations for youth, it is unknown if changes in youth VPA levels will result 
196 
in meaningful changes in diastolic blood pressure, HDL, cholesterol, insulin or adiposity. While 
197 
a recent study is supportive of the latter three (29), the literature is mixed on the relationship 
198 
between increased VPA and blood pressure (9, 11, 27, 33), and very few studies have examined 
199 
the responsiveness of insulin or other markers of glucose metabolism (11, 13). Third, the 
200 
database we utilized lacks standardized dietary data or genetic data that might confound the 
201 
observed relationships. For example, children with higher levels of VPA may consume fewer 
202 
calories, or possess a genetic make-up supportive of a positive biomarker profile. This possibility 
203 
cannot be ruled out using the currently available data. Despite these limitations, this study 
204 
represents one of the largest to date that examined VPA in relation to cardiometabolic 
205 
biomarkers in youth. 
206 
 
207 
  
13 
In summary, the present results suggest few significant or clinically meaningful associations 
208 
between VPA and most cardiometabolic biomarkers studied in youth, but health promoting 
209 
associations were observed between VPA and select cardiometabolic biomarkers (i.e., insulin, 
210 
waist circumference), with the associations observed at higher levels of the biomarkers and 
211 
higher volumes of VPA. As such, VPA may have unique metabolic health benefits beyond those 
212 
conveyed by MPA or minimizing time spent sedentary. The present results also suggest that 
213 
higher VPA cutpoints represent an intensity that is associated with healthier insulin levels and 
214 
waist circumference. Future longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to determine the 
215 
temporal relationship between these variables, the modifiability of VPA, and the effect of 
216 
increased VPA on biomarkers in youth. If these results are indeed robust, then a less time 
217 
consuming, more intense dose of PA may be a viable option for youth seeking to achieve or 
218 
maintain cardiovascular health.
