Abstract
Despite the success of potent anti-retroviral drugs in controlling HIV-1 infection, little progress 
has been made in generating an effective HIV-1 vaccine. Although passive transfer of anti-HIV-1 
bNAbs can protect mice or macaques against a single high dose challenge with HIV or SIV/HIV

 chimeric viruses respectively1-8, the long-term efficacy of a passive antibody transfer approach for 
HIV-1 has not been examined. Based on the relatively long term protection conferred by Hepatitis 
A immune globulin, we tested the efficacy of a single injection (20mg/kg) of four anti-HIV-1 
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (VRC01, VRC01-LS, 3BNC117, and 10-10749-12) in 
blocking repeated weekly low dose virus challenges of the clade B SHIVAD8. Compared to control 
animals, which required 2 to 6 challenges (median=3 weeks) for infection, a single bNAb infusion 
prevented virus acquisition for up to 23 weeks. This effect depended on antibody potency and half-
life. The highest levels of plasma neutralizing activity and correspondingly, the longest protection, 
were found in monkeys administered the more potent antibodies, 3BNC117 and 10-1074 
(median=13 and 12.5 weeks respectively). VRC01, which showed lower plasma-neutralizing 
activity, protected for a shorter time (median=8 weeks). The introduction of a mutation that 
extends antibody half-life into the Fc domain of VRC01 increased median protection from 8 to 
14.5 weeks. If administered in to populations at high risk for HIV-1 transmission, such an 
immunoprophylaxis regimen could have a major impact on virus transmission.
It is now recognized that unlike most other prophylactic vaccines for human viral pathogens, 
an effective vaccine against HIV-1 will likely need to completely block the establishment of 
a productive infection within a very short time frame (1 to 3 days of transmission). Such 
protection has, in fact, been achieved by administering polyclonal and monoclonal anti-
HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to humanized mice or macaques prior to challenge 
with SIV/HIV chimeric viruses (SHIVs)1-8.
During the past seven years, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been isolated from 
selected HIV-1 infected individuals, who generate anti-viral NAbs (bNAbs) with broad and 
potent activity against isolates of diverse genetic and geographic origin13. Several of these 
bNAbs have been used to suppress ongoing viral infections in humanized mice, macaques, 
and humans14-18. Pre-exposure immunoprophylaxis with bNAbs has also been evaluated in 
macaque models. In most of these experiments, a single dose of antibody, typically infused 
24 to 48h before a single high dose virus challenge, was sufficient to block infection by a 
virus challenge, capable of establishing an infection in all untreated animals4,19-21. Humans, 
however, are usually exposed to much lower doses of virus on several occasions before 
becoming infected with HIV-122.
It is worth noting that prior to the development of an effective hepatitis A virus vaccine, pre-
exposure immunoprophylaxis with Hepatitis A immune globulin was common practice for 
travelers to endemic regions of the world; protective effects lasted 3 to 5 months23. 
Prophylactic administration of antibodies against other microbial pathogens has also been 
used to prevent disease24. Based on this idea, we explored the possibility that a single 
administration of a potent neutralizing anti-HIV MAb, in the setting of repeated low-dose 
(RLD) SHIV challenges, might protect for extended periods of time, thereby providing a 
proof of concept for periodic administration of MAb as an alternative to HIV-1 vaccination.
We initially selected 3 MAbs for the RLD SHIV challenge experiment based on their 
previously described activity in blocking virus acquisition in a cohort of 60 macaques 
following a single high dose SHIV challenge21. Two of these antibodies (VRC0112 and 
3BNC11711) target the gp120 CD4bs and one (10-107410) is dependent on the presence of

 HIV-1 gp120 N332 glycan, located immediately downstream of the V3 loop. The challenge 
virus selected for the present study was SHIVAD8-EO25, an R5-tropic molecular cloned 
derivative of the clade B SHIVAD826, which possesses multiple properties typical of 
pathogenic HIV-1 isolates27.
When tested against large HIV-1 pseudovirus panels including multiple clades, 3BNC117 
and VRC01 neutralize more than 80% of the viral isolates and 10-1074 neutralizes between 
60 and 70%. Against sensitive viruses, 10-1074 is the most potent, followed by 3BNC117 
and VRC0128. Consistent with this trend, the IC50s for VRC01, 3BNC117 and 10-1074 
against SHIVAD8-EO were 0.67, 0.06 and 0.08 μg/ml, respectively, and the IC80s were 2.04, 
0.19 and 0.18 μg/ml, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Neutralization sensitivities were 
also measured using the SHIV challenge stock in a single round of infection assay in TZM-
bl cells, using replication competent SHIVAD8-EO. The IC50s and IC80s for VRC01, 
3BNC117 and 10-1074 in this assay system were 2.06, 0.12, and 0.05 and 7.14, 0.32, and 
0.14 μg/ml, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1b).
In an initial experiment designed to simulate low dose mucosal transmission in humans, a 
cohort of 9 monkeys was challenged weekly by the intrarectal (IR) route with 10 TCID50 of 
SHIVAD8-EO, in the absence of antibody treatment. As shown in Fig. 1a, plasma viremia 
became detectable following 2 to 6 challenges, with a median of 3.0 weekly virus exposures 
needed to infect all nine animals. Based on these results, the inoculum size administered to 
each monkey per challenge was estimated to be 0.27 AID50.
The regimen used to assess the protective efficacy of the three anti-HIV-1 MAbs against a 
RLD rectal challenge of SHIVAD8-EO is shown in Fig. 1b. Individual MAbs (20 mg/kg) were 
administered a single time intravenously to three cohorts of 6 animals. Starting one week 
later, each group was challenged weekly by the IR route with 10 TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO. 
Samples of blood, collected at regular intervals, were monitored for levels of viral RNA, 
concentrations of MAb, and anti-SHIV neutralizing titers. The number of virus challenges 
required to establish a SHIVAD8-EO infection, indicated by measurable viremia (>100 viral 
RNA copies/ml plasma), in the recipients of the anti-HIV-1 MAbs was compared to that 
needed for virus acquisition in the control group.
In all cases, the administration of MAbs delayed virus acquisition. Animals receiving 
VRC01 required 4-12 challenges; 3BNC117 required 7-20 challenges and 10-1074, 6-23 
challenges (Fig. 1c, d, and e). The difference in the number of challenges required for 
infection, and thus, the median times to virus acquisition compared to control monkeys were 
8 weeks for VRC01, 13 weeks for 3BNC117 and 12.5 weeks for 10-1074.
The pharmacokinetic profile of VRC01 was altered by introducing two amino acid 
mutations (M428L and N434S, referred to as “LS”), into its Fc domain, which increased its 
half-life in both plasma and tissues9. The neutralization activity of this VRC01 derivative, 
designated VRC01-LS, was first tested in the TZM-bl assay and, as expected, it exhibited 
IC50 and IC80 values similar to VRC01 (Extended Data Fig. 1 a and b). When administered 
to six macaques in the previously described RLD SHIVAD8-EO challenge system, the 
VRC01-LS treated animals required 9 to 18 challenges (median = 14.5) for all of the

 monkeys to become infected (Fig. 1f). Thus the modified VRC01-LS Fc domain conferred 
an estimated 1.8-fold increase in the number of challenges resulting in successful acquisition 
compared to the parental VRC01 MAb.
The protective effects of the four anti-HIV-1 MAbs are described by Kaplan-Meier analysis 
in which the percentage of macaques remaining uninfected is plotted against the number of 
SHIVAD8EO challenges (Fig. 2a). Significantly increased numbers of challenges were 
required to establish infections in the recipients of the VRC01, 3BNC117, 10-1074 and 
VRC01-LS MAbs than in the control animals (P = 0.007, 0.002, 0.002 and 0.002, 
respectively), using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (Fig. 2b). A comparison of the individual 
pairs of Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that 10-1074, 3BNC117 and VRC01-LS were not 
significantly different from each other in blocking infection.
Ultrasensitive nested qRT-PCR and qPCR assays for plasma viral RNA and cell-associated 
viral RNA and DNA29 were performed on plasma and PBMC samples, collected from 
recipients of the different neutralizing MAbs, prior to SHIVAD8-EO breakthrough infections, 
as assessed by plasma viremia measured in our standard assay. In all cases, the levels of viral 
RNA and DNA measured with the ultrasensitive assays were below detectable limits 
(Extended Data Table 1).
The plasma concentrations of the infused MAbs were measured longitudinally in individual 
animals beginning 1 week following infusion. (Fig. 3; Extended data Tables 2 and 3). The 
median plasma concentrations at the times of virus breakthrough for the 10-1074 and 
3BNC117 recipient cohorts were 0.169 and 0.330 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 3e). These values 
are comparable to the IC80 values determined in vivo, using TZM-bl assays (Extended data, 
Fig. 1b). The median plasma concentrations at the times of virus acquisition for VRC01 and 
VRC01-LS were 10 to 20-fold higher (1.825 and 6.446 μg/ml) and were also in the same 
range as the IC80 values determined in vitro. It is worth noting that three of the six recipients 
of the 10-1074 MAb experienced rapid decay of plasma antibody, which fell to background 
levels between weeks 4 to 6 following administration (Fig. 3c). A similar pattern occurred 
for three of the 3BNC117 MAb and VRC01-LS recipients, although the decline of antibody 
in plasma was delayed in these two groups animals (Fig. 3b). This rapid clearance of plasma 
MAbs in the subgroups of 10-1074 and 3BNC117 recipients tracked with the emergence of 
anti-antibody responses to the infused anti-HIV-1 human MAbs (Extended Data Fig. 2). For 
monkeys infused with the 10-1074 MAb, the median number of challenges for successful 
infection in the three-animal subgroup not experiencing the rapid anti-antibody induced 
decay, was 17.0 weeks compared to 12.5 for the entire 10-1074 recipient cohort.
Probit analysis was also used to estimate the probability of infection as a function of the 
imputed plasma MAb concentration at the time of each challenge. The probability of 
infection per infection for the control monkeys was 0.27, estimated by pooling all of the 
SHIVAD8-EO challenges to this group of animals; this is indicated by the single open circle 
along the ordinate of Extended Data Fig. 3. Not unexpectedly, the curves relating antibody 
concentration and virus acquisition for VRC01 and VRC01-LS were superimposed on one 
another even though VRC01-LS had a longer half-life in vivo. In this same analysis, the 
curves for 10-1074 and 3BNC117, which conferred lower probabilities for infection at each

 plasma MAb concentration, reflected their greater neutralization potency against the 
challenge virus, relative to the VRC01 antibodies. At a 10-1074 MAb plasma concentration 
of 1 μg/ml, the model predicts a probability of infection, for a single challenge, of 0.044, 
approximately 6-fold less than that estimated for animals receiving no antibodies.
The plasma neutralization titer was also determined for each of the MAb recipients at 
multiple times post infusion (Figure 4a). The median plasma neutralizing titers for the four 
groups of macaques at the time of SHIVAD8-EO acquisition were low: <1:20 (below the level 
of detection) for 10-1074 and 3BNC117 recipients; 1:27 for the VRC01 group; and 1:51 for 
the VRC01-LS cohort (Fig. 4b). As noted earlier for plasma MAb concentrations, the levels 
of detectable neutralizing activity in members of each cohort inversely correlated with the 
emergence of anti-antibodies (Compare Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 2).
In conclusion a single administration of potent anti-HIV-1 neutralizing MAbs to naïve 
macaques was protective against repeated low dose SHIV infection for several months. The 
duration of protection was directly related to antibody potency and half-life. When 
considered in the context of a potential exposure to HIV-1 in regions of the world where the 
HIV-1 is endemic, the barrier to infection when antibody concentrations remain above 
protective levels in infused individuals, could have a profound impact on virus transmission. 
As noted earlier, anti-antibodies directed against some of the administered MAbs emerged 
quite rapidly in some macaques, and diminished their prophylactic efficacy. However, this is 
not likely to occur in humans as reported in a recent study of VRC0130. Based on the results 
obtained with VRC01 and VRC01-LS, it is also anticipated that the creation and use of 
3BN117 and/or 10-1074 derivatives with the LS mutation should exhibit increased durability 
in vivo, resulting in protection of up to 6 months against SHIVAD8-EO infected macaques. 
The administration of a multivalent cocktail of these anti-viral bNAbs could augment their 
efficacy by increasing overall breadth and their capacity to block the transmission of 
resistant HIV-1 strains.
METHODS
Animal experiments
Thirty-three male and female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Indian genetic origin 
from 2 to 4 years of age were housed and cared for in accordance with Guide for Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals Report no. NIH 82-53 (Department of Health and Human 
Services, Bethesda, Maryland, 1985) in a biosafety level 2 NIAID facility. All animal 
procedures and experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NIAID, NIH. Animals were not 
randomized and the data collected was not blinded. Phlebotomies, euthanasia and sample 
collection were performed as previously described 31. All of the macaques used in this study 
were negative for the MHC class I Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 alleles. No 
animals were excluded from the analysis.

 Antibodies
The VRC01, 3BNC117, 10-1074 and VRC01-LS anti-HIV-1 monoclonal NAbs were 
isolated and produced as described elsewhere 9-12. 10-1074 was produced by transient 
transfection of IgH and IgL expression plasmids into the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 
cells whereas VRC01, VRC01-LS, and 3BNC117 were produced from Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells. All of the MAbs were IgG1. All of the monoclonal antibodies were 
purified by chromatography and sterile filtration and were endotoxin free. A single dose (20 
mg/kg) of each MAb was administered intravenously to individual animals in four cohorts of 
monkeys.
Virus challenge
The origin and preparation of the tissue-culture-derived SHIVAD8-EO stock have been 
previously described25. One week following MAb infusion, animals were challenged 
intrarectally with 10 TCID50 of SHIVAD8-EO, and every week thereafter, until a virus 
infection was established. A pediatric nasal speculum was used to gently open the rectum 
and a 1 ml suspension of virus was slowly infused into rectal cavity using a plastic 
tuberculin syringe. An IR challenge SHIVAD8-EO inoculum size of 10 TCID50 was chosen 
for RLD experiments based on previous results indicating that: 1) 1000 TCID50 of 
SHIVAD8-EO administered by the IR route resulted in the establishment of infections of 30 
of 30 rhesus monkeys and 2) an IR virus titration suggested that 1000 TCID50 of 
SHIVAD8-EO was equivalent to approximately 10 animal infectious doses (AID)5021.
Quantification of viral nucleic acids
Viral RNA levels in plasma were determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (ABI 
Prism 7900HT sequence detection system; Applied Biosystems) as previously described31. 
Ultrasensitive measurement of plasma SIV gag RNA was performed as described, and cell-
associated levels of SIV RNA and DNA were determined by a nested, hybrid real-time/
digital PCR assay, essentially as reported previously29.
Antibody concentrations in plasma
Plasma antibody levels were quantified by ELISA using purified MAbs as a standard and 
anti-antibody responses in plasma were also evaluated as reported earlier9. These assays 
were performed twice.
Neutralization assays
The titers of each MAb against SHIVAD8-EO was assessed by two types of in vitro 
neutralization assays: (1) TZM-bl entry assay with pseudotype challenge virus25,27 and (2) a 
single-round TZM-bl infectivity assay with replication competent challenge virus32. 
Antibody concentrations required to inhibit infection by 50% or 80% are reported as 50% or 
80% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 or IC80), respectively. TZM-bl cells were obtained 
through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from Dr. John C. 
Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu and Tranzyme Inc 33. These cells were not authenticated for this 
study. The neutralization activity present in plasma samples collected from rhesus macaques 
was assessed by TZM-bl entry assay with pseudotype challenge virus. The IC50 titer was

 calculated as the plasma dilution causing 50% reduction in RLUs compared with virus 
controls. The neutralization assays were repeated two times.
Statistical analyses
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare number of challenges until infection 
between each MAb groups and control; these comparisons were considered primary and 
were compared to a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha of .05/4=.0125 to determine significance. 
Comparisons between antibodies were considered secondary and are not adjusted for 
multiple comparisons. Finally, probit models were used to model the probability of infection 
at each challenge as a function of concurrent antibody concentration. Since these values 
were not always measured at the precise time of challenge, antibody concentration were 
modeled separately for each animal over time, and these models were used to impute the 
concentration at the exact time of each challenge for the probit model.

 Figure 1. HIV MAbs delay virus acquisition following repeated low-dose intrarectal 
SHIVAD8-EO challenges
a, Plasma viral loads in macaques receiving no MAb (controls). b, Diagrammatic 
representation of the regimen used to assess the protective efficacy of MAbs. Macaques 
were administered the indicated MAbs at a dose of 20 mg kg−1 and challenged one week 
later and subsequently, every week thereafter. c, d, e, f, Plasma viral loads in macaques 
administered VRC01, 3BNC117, 10-1074 and VRC01-LS bNAbs, respectively.

 Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier analysis and magnitude of protection by HIV MAbs in repeated low-
dose challenge
a, The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for recipients of the four bNAbs and the cohort of 
control animals. The percentage of macaques remaining uninfected is plotted against the 
number of 10 TCID50 SHIVAD8-EO intrarectal challenges required to establish infections. b, 
Statistical differences are represented as P-values (Wilcoxon Rank sum test) by comparing 
the number of challenges resulting in infection between control animals and an individual 
MAb recipient group or between different MAb treated groups.
