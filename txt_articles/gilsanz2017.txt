IMPORTANCE Birth in a group of predominantly southern US states is robustly linked to
increased stroke risk. Given the role of cerebrovascular disease in dementia risk, geographic
patterning may also occur for dementia incidence.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether birth in 9 high stroke mortality states (HSMSs) is
associated with dementia in a diverse cohort of individuals living in Northern California.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational cohort study included 7423 members
of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care delivery system,
with health survey and clinical examination data available. Data were collected between 1964
and 1973 when the individuals were middle-aged and 1996 and 2015 when participants were
in later life.
EXPOSURES Self-reported state of birth in an HSMS (top quintile of states for stroke
mortality).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dementia diagnoses obtained from electronic health
records from January 1, 1996, to October 15, 2015. Place of birth, race, educational level, and
midlife vascular risk factors data were collected between 1964 and 1973.
RESULTS Of the 7423 persons included in the analysis, 4049 (54.5%) were women; 1354
(18.2%) were black. The mean (SD) age of study participants at their first visit between 1963
and 1974 was 42.94 (1.73) years and mean (SD) age at the beginning of follow-up for
dementia in 1996 was 71.14 (2.72) years. Dementia was diagnosed in 2254 (30.4%) of the
participants and was more common among those born in an HSMS than those born outside of
one (455 [39.0%] vs 1799 [28.8%]). Birth in an HSMS was 9.6 times more common for black
participants (795 [58.7%]) than nonblack participants (371 [6.1%]). Overall, birth in an HSMS
was associated with a 28% higher risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.28; 95% CI,
1.13-1.46) adjusted for age, sex, and race. Compared with nonblack persons born outside of an
HSMS, black individuals born in an HSMS had the highest dementia risk (aHR, 1.67; 95% CI,
1.48-1.88), followed by black individuals not born in an HSMS (aHR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.28-1.72),
and nonblack persons born in an HSMS had a 46% increased risk (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI,
1.23-1.74). Cumulative 20-year dementia risks at age 65 years were 30.13% (95% CI,
26.87%-32.93%) and 21.80% (95% CI, 20.51%-22.91%) for individuals born in and outside an
HSMS, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first study to date of place of
birth and incident dementia and shows increased risk for individuals born in an HSMS, even
though all participants subsequently resided in California. Birth in an HSMS was common
among black participants. Place of birth has enduring consequences for dementia risk and
may be a major contributor to racial disparities in dementia.

 A
dultresidenceinabandofstatesinthesouthernUnited
States known as the Stroke Belt is associated with in-
creased risk of a plethora of conditions, including hy-
pertension, diabetes, stroke, and cognitive impairment.1-6 A
growing body of research demonstrates a link between birth-
place and adult cardiovascular risk,6-10 and early-life resi-
dence in the Stroke Belt has been shown to increase the risk
of poor health outcomes even for individuals who subse-
quently move out of the region.1,6,10,11
Although birth in the Stroke Belt has been associated
with greater risk of dementia mortality, regardless of the state
of residence at death,9 to our knowledge, no prior study has
examined whether incident dementia is similarly elevated
for individuals born in geographic regions with high stroke
risk but who subsequently reside elsewhere. There is strong
geographic patterning of place of birth and adult residence by
race, which could play a role in racial or ethnic inequalities in
rates of dementia.12,13 Geographic patterning of increased risk
of disease can represent clustering of risk factors, some of
which are modifiable. Stroke risk can reflect clustering of
cerebrovascular risk factors, many of which are also robust
predictors of dementia, so it is biologically plausible that
early life residence in regions with elevated stroke risk may
also increase dementia risk. Our objective was to determine
whether birth in a high stroke mortality state (HSMS) is asso-
ciated with increased dementia risk in a diverse cohort of
individuals living in Northern California with equal access to
medical care.
Methods
Study Participants
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) is a large inte-
grated health care delivery system that provides care to over
3 million members in Northern California (approximately 30%
ofthegeographicregion).TheKPNCmemberpopulationisgen-
erally representative of the overall population of the region,
although individuals at extreme tails of the income distribu-
tion are underrepresented.14-16 We included members who
participated in the Multiphasic Health Checkup (MHC), an op-
tional checkup provided to health plan members in San Fran-
cisco and Oakland, California, in the 1960s and 1970s. During
MHC visits, information was collected on demographics, life-
style, and cardiometabolic health.
The study was approved by the Kaiser Internal Review
Board and they approved a waiver of informed consent for this
study. Data are deidentified.
Study Design
This was a cohort study of 7423 US-born individuals who par-
ticipated in at least 1 MHC visit between 1964 and 1973, were
aged40to45yearsatthetimeofparticipation,remainedKPNC
members when electronic health records became available
in 1994, and reported state of birth. The eFigure in the
Supplement shows the flowchart of exclusions. For members
who participated in more than 1 MHC visit, data from the first
visit were included. This cohort was followed-up from Janu-
ary 1, 1996, until the first diagnosis of dementia, death, lapse
inhealthplanmembership,orOctober1,2015,forupto19years
of follow-up.
State of Birth
During MHC visits, state of birth was captured with an open-
ended questionnaire item asking, “Where were you born?” To
bestcapturetheearlylifeconditionsofthepopulation,weused
overall Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stroke mor-
tality rates from 2012 to 2014, which are the most current es-
timates of high stroke risk states. High stroke mortality states
were those in the top quintiles of stroke mortality rates among
US territories (ie, states with >83 stroke deaths per 100 000
people older than 35 years).17 Based on this information, we
coded place of birth as inside or outside an HSMS. The follow-
ing 9 states were considered HSMSs: Alabama, Alaska, Arkan-
sas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, South Caro-
lina, and West Virginia. Many of these states are part of what
is commonly considered the Stroke Belt, although defini-
tions of the Stroke Belt are not consistent across prior re-
search and public health activities.
Dementia Diagnosis and Mortality
Consistentwithpreviouspublicationsinthispopulation,12,18-23
dementia diagnoses were identified from KPNC electronic
medical records. The following International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes were used to
identify dementia cases between January 1, 1996, and Octo-
ber 1, 2015: Alzheimer disease (code 331.0), vascular demen-
tia (code 290.4x), and other/nonspecific dementia (codes
290.0, 290.1x, 290.2x, 290.3, 294.2x, and 294.8). A previous
study, also within a health care system, found a that a similar
set of ICD-9 codes had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of
95%, compared with a consensus diagnosis of dementia uti-
lizing medical records review, physical examination, struc-
tured interviews, and a neuropsychiatric battery.24
Death was captured through electronic medical records,
the California State Mortality File, and Social Security Death
Records. This method of death ascertainment has previously
been used in studies of this population.12,25
Key Points
Question Is birth in a state with high stroke mortality associated
with dementia risk in a cohort of individuals who all subsequently
resided outside of those states?
Findings In this cohort study, among 7423 Northern California
residents with equal access to health care, dementia risk was
approximately 26% higher among those born in high stroke
mortality states compared with elsewhere. Compared with
nonblack persons born outside of high stroke mortality states,
black individuals born in a high stroke mortality state had the
highest dementia risk, followed by black individuals not born in a
high stroke mortality state, and lastly nonblack persons born in a
high stroke mortality state.
Meaning Racial inequalities in dementia may partially reflect
geographic patterning of early-life exposures.

 Covariates
The 1964-1973 MHC questionnaire included self-report of the
following covariates: age, sex, race (black, white, Asian, or
other), educational attainment (high school or less, some col-
lege or technical school, at least college graduate), blood pres-
sure medication, and smoking. The 1964-1973 MHC visit also
included clinical measurements of height, weight, and sys-
tolicanddiastolicbloodpressure.Heightandweightwerecom-
bined to calculate midlife body mass index. Hypertension was
definedasbloodpressuremeasurementsofsystolicbloodpres-
sure 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic pressure 90 mm Hg or
higher. Hypertension was combined with self-reported blood
pressure medication use to create 3 categories of midlife blood
pressure: no hypertension, controlled hypertension, and un-
controlledhypertension.Informationoneversmokingwascon-
nected with smoking duration to classify midlife smoking sta-
tus as never smoked, smoked less than 10 years, smoked
between 10 and 20 years, or smoked more than 20 years. Late-
life cardiovascular risk (yes/no) was defined as having at least 1
of the following diagnoses between January 1, 1996, and Octo-
ber 1, 2015, in the electronic health records: diabetes, hyper-
tension, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Missing indicators were used for
missing data on smoking duration (n = 125), midlife body mass
index (n = 432), and blood pressure medication (n = 8).
Statistical Analysis
First, we examined the distribution of sociodemographic vari-
ables, midlife risk factors, and late-life conditions stratified on
birth in HSMSs (yes/no). We then estimated dementia inci-
dence rates standardized to the 2000 US Census by region of
birth. Next, we tested the assumption of proportional hazards
and used a series of Cox proportional hazards models (with age
as the timescale) to examine the association between birth in
anHSMSandriskofdementia.Weadjustedforcovariatesinse-

We concurrently examined the associations of birth in an
HSMSandracewithdementiariskbygroupingindividualsinto
4 categories: (1) nonblack individuals born outside of HSMSs,
(2) black individuals born outside of HSMSs, (3) nonblack in-
dividuals born in HSMSs, and (4) black individuals born in
HSMSs. We examined the association of these categories with
dementia risk in Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting
for sociodemographics and midlife and late-life exposures
sequentially.
We estimated and plotted the cumulative risk of demen-
tia in 5-year increments from 10 to 25 years conditional on sur-
vival free of dementia to age 65 years by birth in an HSMS using
the Practical Incidence Estimator macro, which incorporates
information on death rates.26 All analyses were conducted
using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc), and 2-sided P val-
ues <.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Overall, the sample was 18.2% black, 74.2% white, and 5.0%
Asian; 15.7% were born in an HSMS (Table 1). Of those born in
HSMSs, 68.2% were black and 31.8% were nonblack. Even
though all sample members resided in Northern California by
1974, black participants were 9.6 times more likely to be born
in an HSMS than nonblack participants (795 [58.7%] vs 371
[6.1%]) (eTable 2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement). A total of
30.3% of individuals born in an HSMS and 27.5% of those born
outside of those states experienced a late-life stroke. The mean
(SD) age of study participants at their first MHC visit between
1963 and 1974 was 42.94 (1.73) years (range, 39.96-45.96 years)
and their mean age at the beginning of follow-up for demen-
tiain1996was71.14(2.72)years(range,63.80-76.63years).The
mean (SD) follow-up time for dementia (starting in 1996)
was 11.61 (6.24) years (range, 0.02-19.75 years). By the end of
follow-up, 2254 (30.4%) of the participants were diagnosed
with dementia, 2473 (33.3%) had died without a dementia di-
agnosis, 1227 (16.5%) were censored owing to a lapse in mem-
bership, and 1469 (19.8%) were alive, members of KPNC, and
dementia-free at the end of follow-up. The incidence rates for
people born in an HSMS and people born outside of an HSMS
were 23.56 (95% CI, 20.46-26.67) and 15.54 (95% CI, 14.42-
16.66) per 1000 person-years, respectively.
Visual examination of the unadjusted survival plots by
birth in HSMSs provided evidence that the proportional haz-
ards assumption was met. In age- and sex-adjusted Cox pro-
portionalhazardsmodels,birthinanHSMSwasassociatedwith
a 54% increased risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR],
1.54; 95% CI, 1.39-1.71) (Table 2). The association remained sig-
nificantafteradjustmentforblackrace(aHR,1.28;95%CI,1.13-
1.46). Further adjustment for education and midlife vascular
risk factors did not attenuate the association between birth in
an HSMS and dementia (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.44). Among
nonblack individuals, birth in an HSMS was associated with a
46% increase in dementia risk (aHR,1.46; 95% CI, 1.23-1.75) ad-
justed for age and sex. In black individuals, birth in an HSMS
was associated with a 13% increased dementia risk (aHR, 1.13;
95% CI, 0.94-1.35), although the 95% CI included the null.
An interaction term for birth in an HSMS and black race was
statistically significant (P = .04), indicating that the relative ef-
fects of being born in an HSMS differed for black and non-
black individuals.
The 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year cumulative risks of demen-
tia conditional on survival to age 65 years without dementia
(Table 3 and Figure) were each greater among individuals born
in HSMSs compared with their counterparts born outside of
those states. For example, the 20-year cumulative dementia
risk was 30.13% (95% CI, 26.87%-32.93%) for people born in
the HSMSs and was 21.80% (95% CI, 20.51%-22.91%) for those
born outside those states.
In age- and sex-adjusted models examining joint effects
of birth in an HSMS and race, with nonblack individuals born
outside the HSMSs as the reference group, black individuals
born in an HSMS had the greatest dementia risk (aHR,1.67; 95%
CI, 1.48-1.88), followed by black individuals not born in an

in an HSMS (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.23-1.74) (Table 4). After ad-
justing for education and midlife and late-life health expo-
sures, compared with nonblack members born outside the
HSMSs, both black and nonblack individuals born in an HSMS
had more than a 40% higher dementia risk and black individu-

Discussion
In what we believe to be the first article examining place of
birth, race, and dementia incidence, we found place of birth
to be a robust risk factor for dementia even after accounting
for race, educational level, and life-course vascular risk fac-
tors.BirthinanHSMSwasassociatedwitha54%increasedrisk

 of dementia compared with birth outside of those states in
age-adjusted models and persisted after adjustments. Esti-
mates of cumulative risk, an absolute risk measure (as
opposed to relative measures, such as HRs), further under-
score the risk associated with birth in an HSMS. Individuals
born in an HSMS had approximately 38% higher 20-year
cumulative dementia risk compared with people born out-
side of an HSMS. Compared with nonblack individuals born
outside of the HSMSs, black persons born in these states had
a 67% higher incidence rate of dementia, whereas black per-
sons born outside of these states had a 48% greater demen-
tia incidence rate.
Even though the association was stronger among non-
black individuals, trends suggested an increased risk of
dementia associated with birth in an HSMS for both the black
and nonblack cohorts. Furthermore, dementia risk was great-
est for individuals who were black and born in an HSMS. The
excess dementia risk associated with geography may there-
forecontributetoracialdisparitiesindementia.Posthocanaly-
ses showed that black race was associated with a 56% in-
creased risk of dementia when controlling only for age. With
adjustment for birth in an HSMS, the risk associated with black
race was attenuated by more than a third. This has great pub-
lic health relevance since many current black elderly individu-
als were born in the South and moved away during the “great
migration.”13
To our knowledge, no study has previously examined
birthplace and dementia incidence. However, our finding of
elevated risk among people born in an HSMS is consistent with
a previous death-records–based study reporting an elevated
risk of dementia-related mortality among individuals born in
the Stroke Belt.9 The present analysis is a valuable advance
because studies based on mortality data are potentially bi-
ased owing to inaccurate reporting of place of birth and de-
mentia diagnoses on death records and undercounts in cen-
sus denominator populations.
Several of the states with high stroke mortality rates are
part of the southern region of the United States, which has the
largest racial disparities in cognitive outcomes between white
and black individuals.27 In 1960, the South had the greatest
proportion of people living in poverty compared with other
census regions; 35.6% of people in the South lived below pov-
erty level compared with 22.1% of the United States overall and
only 14.4% of those in the Northeast.28 Poverty early in life can
reflect a host of factors that could affect brain health and cog-
nitive reserve, such as nutrition, lead exposure, chronic stress,
and cognitive stimulation.29 Poverty is highly associated with
low birthweight and it is very likely that low birthweight dis-
proportionally affected southern black persons in the 1920s,
placing them at greater risk for elevated blood pressure,30,31
stroke,31,32 and cardiovascular disease mortality.33,34 Relat-
edly, birth or childhood residence in the Stroke Belt specifi-
cally has also been associated with stroke,10,11 hypertension,1
and atrial fibrillation.35 One’
s place of birth can have lasting
effects by influencing individuals’lifestyle and health behav-
ior throughout adult-life, even when residence has changed
and access to health care is uniform.

 Birth in southern states may also be associated with poorer
quality of education among older adults, which affects cogni-
tive reserve. The cognitive reserve hypothesis posits that edu-
cation (and other factors) during early life prompts protec-
tive biological changes in the brain that can delay against
cognitive impairment.36 Southern state laws allowing school
segregation were not overturned until 1954 when the Su-
preme Court’
s Brown vs Board of Education ruled that these
laws were unconstitutional. Segregated schools designated for
black children received less funding, had higher student-
teacher ratios, and had shorter term lengths than schools des-
ignatedforwhitechildren.37Althoughblackchildrenweremost
disadvantaged by these policies, average educational quality
for segregated white schools was also lower than average qual-
ity in nonsegregated states.9 Even after the Brown vs Board of
Education decision, de facto racial segregation of schools re-
mained common. In our sample, 66.0% of individuals born in
an HSMS had a high school or less level of education com-
pared with 44.9% of individuals born outside of these states.
While we know the highest grade of school participants
completed, we can only extrapolate regarding educational
quality. Additional research is needed to assess whether higher
levels of formal education diminish the absolute risk of de-
mentia associated with being born in an HSMS among black
or nonblack persons.
Limitations and Strengths
Given that everyone in our cohort migrated to California, our
results are susceptible to selection bias and probably under-
estimate the effect of birth in an HSMS due to a healthy mi-
grant bias: migrants may be healthier or more highly edu-
cated than those who remained in an HSMS. It is reasonable
to assume that it would be more challenging for black indi-
vidualsbornintheSouthtomovetoCaliforniathantheirwhite
counterparts. Therefore, selection bias may especially lead to
an underestimate of the effect among black individuals and
the risk of dementia associated with birth in an HSMS may not
differ by race.
Although we know both the birthplace and the midlife and
current location of individuals in this study, we did not have
completeresidentialhistoryandcouldnotdeterminehowlong
they resided in an HSMS. Therefore, we cannot disentangle
whether cumulative or longer time of residence was worse or
whether the effect of birthplace varies by the age at which they
left the HSMS. We also do not know childhood exposure to rel-
evant residential risk factors, such as secondhand smoke, lead,
or air pollution, although this is a goal of our future research.
It is unclear whether these results are generalizable to all of
Northern California and individuals who were born during a
different time since early-life exposures are influenced by so-
cial norms and policies. We do not have brain imaging data in
our sample and thus were unable to examine subclinical vas-
cular brain injury; we therefore could not directly examine the
associationbetweenbirthinanHSMSandbrainhealth.Aswith
all observational studies, the possibility of residual confound-
ing, unmeasured confounding, and measurement error per-
sists. Strengths of this study include a long follow-up period
during which an array of data regarding a large span of the life
course were collected, a multiethnic cohort with equal access
to health care, and granular health records with information
about other health conditions. By evaluating birth in HSMSs
in a group that had subsequently all moved to 1 geographic re-
gion, we had the unusual opportunity to determine the role
of early life exposures and conditions that are captured in geo-
graphic differences even in individuals who did not remain in
their state of birth. We found that black individuals born out-
side the HSMSs had very similar dementia risks as nonblack
individuals born inside an HSMS.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study of place of birth and
risk of incident dementia. Our study confirms the overlap be-
tween race and place of birth as potential contributors to dis-
parities in dementia risk, showing that black individuals are
more likely to have been born in HSMSs than are those of other
races. Furthermore, there was an influence of place of birth on
dementia risk in this group of individuals who moved away
from states with high stroke mortality rates decades before de-
mentia diagnosis. Place of birth may reflect a host of social and
environmental conditions in early life that could be some of
the primary drivers of racial inequalities in rates of dementia.
Future research should examine possible pathways through
which early-life biological and psychosocial exposures affect
dementia risk. In addition, further research needs to address
the geographic patterning of dementia and elucidate the ef-
fect of place over the life course on health. It is also important
to conduct such analyses in different cohorts of aging popu-
lations since the early life social and physical conditions to
which individuals are exposed will vary by birth cohort. Our
findingsunderscoretheimportanceofexaminingearlylifefac-
tors when researching dementia risk as these may inform on
the timing, populations, and mechanism of interventions.
