Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to examine how children’s and parents’ physical activity changes from Year
1 (5–6) to Year 4 (8–9 years of age).
Methods: Data are from the Bristol (UK) B-PROACT1V cohort. Fifty-seven primary schools were recruited when
the children were in Year 1, with 1299 children and their parents providing data. Forty-seven schools were
re-recruited in Year 4, with 1223 children and parents providing data (685 of whom participated in Year 1).
Children and at least one parent wore an accelerometer for 5 days including a weekend and mean minutes of
sedentary time, moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and accelerometer counts per minute
(CPM) were derived. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data for all 1837 families who took part,
including those who participated at just one time. Paired t-tests examined if there was statistical evidence of
change in accelerometer measures.
Results: Multiple imputation and observed data were comparable and results using complete observed data
were mostly the same as those using imputed data. Imputed data showed that mean boys’ CPM decreased
from 747 to 673 (difference in mean 74 [95% CI 45 to 103]) and girls’ from 686 to 587 (99 [79 to 119]). Boys’
time spent in MVPA reduced from 72 to 69 (3 [0 to 6]) and girls’ from 62 to 56 (7 [4 to 9]) minutes per day.
There were increases in sedentary time for both boys (354 to 428 min, 74 [61 to 88]) and girls (365 to 448, 83
[71 to 96]). There was no evidence of change in parent CPM or MVPA. Mothers’ sedentary time increased by
26 min per day [16 to 35].
Conclusions: There were similar increases in sedentary time in girls and boys between age 5–6 and 8–9, and
decreases in MVPA that were more marked in girls. The similarity of multiple-imputed and complete observed
data suggest that these findings may not be markedly affected by selection bias. Result support early interventions to
prevent the age-related decline in children’s physical activity.

 Background
Physical activity during childhood has been shown to
moderately track into adulthood [1], and is associated
with lower levels of a number of risk factors for cardio-
vascular disease and type 2 diabetes including insulin,
glucose, blood pressure and body composition [2]. Phys-
ical activity is also associated with improved emotional
well-being and self-esteem among young people [3]. Data
from the UK Millennium cohort study showed that only
51% of 7-year-old children met the recommendation of an
hour of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity
(MVPA) per day [4]. Thus, there is a need to understand
children’s physical activity patterns, how they change dur-
ing maturation and key ages in which to target behaviour
change interventions.
A number of studies have examined how children’s
physical activity and sedentary time change as they age
[5–7]. The most comprehensive analysis is the pooled
data from 20 studies and 27,637 participants included in
the International Children’s Accelerometry Database
(ICAD), which showed an average decrease of 4.2% in
total physical activity with each additional year of age
[8]. However, despite the strength of the database, the
majority of the studies include children from age eight
or older with data for younger children based on cross-
sectional studies [8]. As such, the ICAD data are limited
on the information they can provide in terms of within-
person change in physical activity during the early years
of schooling. It is also important to highlight that several
studies have reported that age-related changes in phys-
ical activity are not consistent for weekdays and weekend
days. For example, the Speedy study showed a marked
decrease in weekend MVPA after the transition from
primary to secondary school that was not apparent for
weekdays [6]. Thus, there is a need to study the within-
child changes in physical activity and differences between
weekdays and weekend days at the start of primary school.
Two studies have examined within-person change in
younger children’s physical activity. A New Zealand study
with 242 children has shown that children at age 5 en-
gaged in approximately 50% of the physical activity that
they took part in at age 3 [9]. Physical activity patterns at
age 7 were comparable to those at age 5, and boys were
more active than girls at all ages [9]. Analysis of a cohort
of 300 UK children reported that there was little change
in physical activity between 5 and 8 years of age before
declining progressively between 9 and 15 years of age [10].
Both of these studies are, however, comparatively small
and as such there is a need for larger studies that can pro-
vide more representative data.
While there is evidence children’s physical activity pat-
terns decline as they age [8, 11] it is not clear if parental
physical activity patterns change as children get older. We
have previously reported weak associations between parent
and child physical activity [12–14] suggesting that parents
may not need to be active with their children to promote
physical activity and reduce sedentary time [15, 16]. How-
ever, becoming a parent has been associated with a decline
in physical activity [17, 18] with parents of young children
reporting new responsibilities and time commitments as
barriers to physical activity [19–21] and a shift in priorities
from themselves to their child [22]. It may be reasonable to
assume, therefore, that as children age and become more
independent, parents are able to re-address this balance
and find more time to participate in their own physical
activity. To the best of our knowledge, there is, however a
lack of information on whether parental physical activity
patterns change as children move through primary school.
Understanding change in parents’ physical activity as
children age would be helpful for identifying time-points
when parent and child activity patterns may be more or
less amenable to behaviour change interventions.
The aims of this paper were to examine the change in
children’s physical activity between 5–6 and 8–9 years of
age in a UK-based cohort and if there were any differences
by gender or day of the week. Secondly, as changes in the
start of primary school may affect parents’ opportunities for
physical activity, we also examined if there were within-
person changes in parents’ physical activity over the same
period.
Methods
Study design
The current analyses used data from a longitudinal study
(B-PROACT1V) conducted at the University of Bristol
(UK). The aim of the study was to examine the physical
activity and sedentary behaviours of children and their
parents during primary school. Extensive detail on the
first phase of data collection has been previously published
[13, 23]. Briefly, study recruitment began in January 2012,
with data collection conducted between February 2012 and
July 2013 when the children were in their second year of
schooling (known as Year 1 in the UK – children were aged
5 to 6 years). Two hundred fifty primary schools within
Bristol, Bath and North Somerset were invited to take part
in the study, from which 57 schools consented to partici-
pate and data collection was conducted. All children in
Year 1 (or Y1 and Y2 in schools with combined classes)
were eligible, with 1299 children and at least one of their
parents consenting to participate (see Fig. 1).
The second phase of data collection was conducted
when the children were in Year 4 (aged 8 to 9 years)
between March 2015 and July 2016. All 57 schools that
participated in the first phase were invited to partici-
pate in the second phase; 10 schools declined for vari-
ous reasons (e.g., Ofsted (government) inspections, staff
changes, scheduling issues), with the remaining 47 schools
agreeing to participate. Where possible, schools were

 recruited in the same order as the Year 1 data collec-
tion to closely replicate the data collection timeline and
average difference between the dates of the Year 1 and
4 data collections was 6.9 days. The median difference
in age between the time of data collection for each
phase for children who took part in Year 1 and Year 4
was 3.00 years and 95% of the age differences ranged
between 2.79 and 3.65 years. All children in Year 4 (or
Y4 and Y5 in schools with combined classes) were eligible
(n = 2047) regardless of whether they had participated in
the first phase of data collection. In total, 1223 (59.7%)
children and at least one of their parents consented and
took part in the Year 4 data collection. One family con-
sented but was not available for data collection.
Data collection at Year 4
Researchers arranged to visit each school to conduct a
briefing presentation with the Year 4 children to explain
the study. After the presentation, children were given an
information pack to take home to their parents/carers.
Child participation in the study was dependent on at least
one parent or carer (maximum of two parents/carers) also
agreeing to participate in the study. Ethical approval for
the study was granted from the School for Policy Studies
Research Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol
and written parental consent was provided for both parent
and child participation [24].
Child height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm
using a SECA Leicester stadiometer (HAB International,
Northampton). Weight was recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg
using a SECA 899 digital scale (HAB International,
Northampton). The children were then given a waist-worn
ActiGraph wGT3X accelerometer, shown how and when to
wear it, and given a pack to take home to their parents.
Parent packs contained either one or two accelerometers,
depending on the number of parents/carers participating.
Parents received instructions on how and when to wear the
accelerometer. If indicated on the consent form, the packs
also contained paper versions of the parent questionnaires.
Alternatively, parents were sent a link to a secure online
version of the questionnaire. The parent questionnaires
assessed demographic variables and a number of psycho-
social constructs that are not reported here.
Children and parents were instructed to wear the acceler-
ometers for five full days (3 week days and 2 weekend days).
During data collection a mobile phone SMS reminder sys-
tem was in operation to inform parents about the when the
accelerometers and questionnaires were being sent home
and when to return the devices. At the end of the 5 days,
parents were instructed to return the accelerometers and
completed paper questionnaires to a marked returns box at
the child’s school. If accelerometers or questionnaires were
not returned directly, parents were sent reminder texts,
calls and/or emails. If after 2 weeks, devices or question-
naires were still outstanding a letter and prepaid envelope
were sent directly to the child’s home address. As a thank
you for participating children were given a water bottle and
a Frisbee upon completion of data collection.

 Accelerometer data processing
Accelerometer data were processed using Kinesoft (v3.3.75;
Kinesoft, Saskatchewan, Canada) and each day was consid-
ered valid if there was at least 500 min of data after exclud-
ing intervals ≥60 min of zero counts allowing up to two
minutes of interruptions. For the complete case analysis, at
least one valid weekday and at least one valid weekend day
of data were required at both the Year 1 and Year 4 assess-
ments. To maximise the sample size, if a participant had at
least one valid day of data at either time point, this partial
data was included in the imputation models (see below) to
provide an indication of physical activity for the participant.
Average counts per minute (CPM), average number of
sedentary minutes per day and average number of MVPA
minutes per day overall and separately by weekdays
and weekend days for the children and their parents
were derived. Minutes spent in MVPA were derived
using population-specific cut points for children and
adults [25, 26].
Child characteristics
Child gender and the number of siblings were reported
by the parent. An age-adjusted BMI z-score was derived
using the 1990 UK child growth reference, and categorised
as under/normal weight (<85th percentile), overweight
(≥85th percentile) or obese (≥ 95th percentile) [27]. Indices
of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores, based upon the
English Indices of Deprivation (http://data.gov.uk/dataset/
index-of-multiple-deprivation), were assigned to each child-
parent dyad based on their reported home postcode where
higher IMD scores indicate a greater level of deprivation.
Each school was asked to provide information on whether
the child had moved school or remained in the same school
between Year 1 and Year 4 (three schools refused to pro-
vide this information). The parent questionnaire at Year 4
also asked whether the child had moved school between
Year 1 and Year 4.
Parent characteristics
Parent gender, age, height, weight, ethnicity and employ-
ment status were reported in the two parental question-
naires. Body mass index was calculated from self-reported
height and weight (BMI = kg/m2).
Statistical analysis
Child and parent characteristics measured during the
Year 1 phase of B-PROACT1V were examined as potential
predictors of the child’s participation in the Year 4 phase
using univariable logistic regression models. Odds ratios for
participation at Year 4 versus not participating are pre-
sented for each characteristic.
To enable us to include information from all study
participants in our analysis, and thus potentially increase
statistical power and precision of estimates of change in
physical activity, we used multiple imputation of missing
data. This method also allows demographic factors that
are predictive of missingness (but are not necessarily re-
quired in the analysis model) to be accounted for in the
imputation procedure and can therefore reduce selection
bias compared with analysis including only individuals
with complete data [28]. We imputed data for the 1837
children who participated in either Year 1 or Year 4 using
chained equations; this included imputing complete Year
4 data if the child participated in Year 1 but not Year 4
and vice versa. Twenty imputed datasets were created
using 20 cycles of regression switching and results were
then averaged over these datasets using Rubin’s rules [29].
Separate imputation models were used for boys and girls
to allow for possible differences in missing data patterns
that would influence results and to allow exploration of
different patterns of change in physical activity between
Year 1 and Year 4 by child gender. All child and parent
accelerometer measures and child and parent characteris-
tics that were potential predictors of missingness (child
BMI, IMD and number of siblings and female/male parent
response, age, BMI, ethnicity and employment status) at
either year, were included in multiple imputation models.
We also included a categorical variable indicating which
school the child attended in order to account for the clus-
tering of children within schools. For the three children
who attended a different school at Year 4 from that in
Year 1, we used their Year 1 school as this seemed most
likely to influence their physical activity change between
Year 1 and Year 4. The distributions of all included vari-
ables have been compared in the observed data and in the
multiple imputation datasets.
The children’s physical activity levels (mean and SD)
in Year 1 and Year 4 and the change in these between
Year 1 and Year 4 were summarised for the imputed
datasets and are presented separately for boys and girls.
Confidence intervals for the change in physical activity
were derived using robust standard errors to account for
clustering of children within schools. Paired t-tests
(based on these robust standard errors) were used to as-
sess whether there was statistical evidence of a change in
physical activity between Year 1 and Year 4. The female
and male parents’ physical activity levels in Year 1 and
Year 4 were also summarised and compared in the same
way. Additionally, the mean and SD of each of the physical
activity measures at Year 1 and Year 4 have been sum-
marised for children and parents in the complete case
analyses and the change in these measures was assessed,
as in the imputed data, using paired t tests with robust
standard errors.
There was a high degree of missing data for the male
parents since male parents were less likely to participate
in any aspect of the study than female parents. To check
whether this was affecting our findings, we also imputed
Jago et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity  (2017) 14:33 
Page 4 of 13
 to the 864 children and parent triads where a male par-
ent responded at either Year 1 or Year 4 and repeated
the analysis of male parents’ physical activity levels in
this subgroup as a sensitivity analysis. All analyses were
performed in Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp, 2015).
Results
Of the 1837 children who participated in the study at
either year, 614 (33.4%) participated in Year 1 only, 538
(29.3%) participated in Year 4 only and 685 (37.3%) par-
ticipated in both Year 1 and Year 4. Figure 2 shows the
Year 4 school locations (same school, different study
school, different non-study school) of the 1299 children
who took part in Year 1, 52.7% of whom were successfully
re-recruited to the study in Year 4. Those re-recruited
were mostly children who remained in the same school
between the two study years, although three children
moved within study schools and were still able to partici-
pate at both time points.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of all of the children
and parents who participated at Year 1 and at Year 4,
as well as the subset who participated in both time
points. The distributions of these characteristics were
broadly similar at each phase and within the group who
participated at both phases, with the exception of the
percentage of children having moved school between
Year 1 and Year 4, which was much lower in the group
that participated in both years, as expected. In both
Year 1 and Year 4, children were more likely to have a
female parent take part in the study than a male parent.
The male parents were slightly older on average than
the female parents and a higher proportion were in full
time employment. The distributions of child and parent
accelerometer measures and demographic characteris-
tics in the multiple imputation datasets and in the
observed data are compared in Additional file 1: Table S1.
There was little difference in these between the observed
and imputed data, except that the proportion of non-
White British and not working parents was higher in the
imputed data than in the observed data.
The associations of each of the characteristics of children
and their parents measured at Year 1 with their participa-
tion in the study in Year 4 are shown in Table 2. Girls who
participated at Year 1 were more likely to participate in
Year 4 than boys, and children who were obese at Year 1
were less likely to participate at Year 4 than those who were
underweight/normal weight.
The average CPM, sedentary minutes per day and
MVPA minutes per day at Year 1 and Year 4, and change
in these, for all boys and girls using multiple imputation
are shown in Table 3. In both boys and girls there was
strong evidence that mean CPM over all days decreased
between Year 1 and Year 4 while sedentary minutes per
day increased overall. There was also strong evidence in
girls, and slightly weaker evidence in boys, that MVPA per
day decreased overall between Year 1 and Year 4. When
analysed separately by weekday and weekend day, there
was strong evidence for reductions in CPM and increases
in sedentary time on weekdays and weekend days in both
boys and girls, as well as for reductions in MVPA on
weekdays and weekend days in girls. However, there was
only weak evidence for a reduction in MVPA on weekdays
in boys and no difference in MVPA on weekend days.
Similar patterns of association were seen in the complete
case analyse and these results were consistent with the
multiple imputation analysis (Additional file 2: Table S2).
The change in CPM, sedentary minutes per day and
MVPA per day for the parents of all children who took
part in either Year 1 or Year 4 using multiple imputation
is shown in Table 4. There was little evidence that CPM
or MVPA changed over the 3 years for female or male
parents, or that sedentary time changed in male parents,
whether using overall measures or analysing these separ-
ately by weekday and weekend day. However, there was
evidence of an increase in sedentary minutes per day
overall, as well as in weekdays and weekend days separ-
ately, in female parents. In analysis including only the
complete cases findings were consistent with the mul-
tiple imputation analysis as confidence intervals were
wide (Additional file 3: Table S3). However, in this small
subset of the data there was an increase in MVPA in

 female and male parents between Year 1 and Year 4 that
was not seen in the imputed data.
In the sensitivity analysis in which we repeated the
analysis of physical activity levels in male parents, im-
puting missing data only for families in which the male
parent responded at either Year 1 or Year 4, findings
were consistent with the main analysis.
Discussion
The data presented in this paper have shown that there
are important changes in children’s physical activity
between Year 1 and Year 4 of primary school. Acceler-
ometer CPM decreased by 10% for boys and 8.6% for
girls, time spent in MVPA by 3 min (4%) for boys and
7 min (11%) for girls, while sedentary time increased by
20% for boys and 23% for girls. Overall, the findings in-
dicate that while there were important changes for both
genders, the magnitude and absolute change in MVPA
was more marked for girls than boys. These patterns
were broadly consistent when comparing weekdays and
weekend days except for boys’ weekend MVPA, which
did not differ between the two assessment points. With
the exception of mothers’ sedentary time, which in-
creased by 25 min (5%) per day over the 3-year period,
there was no evidence that parents’ physical activity
patterns changed between the two assessment periods.
The data presented here therefore show marked changes,
in an undesirable direction (with regards to their health),
in children’s physical activity and sedentary time as the
children move through primary school that are not
reflected among their parents.
The within-child declines in physical activity and asso-
ciated increases in sedentary time between Year 1 and
Year 4 are broadly consistent with the ICAD data which
showed an average decrease of 4.2% in total physical ac-
tivity with each additional year of age [8]. The findings
are also consistent with the results of a meta-analysis of
self-reported adolescent physical activity which identified
a decrease of 7% in physical activity per year [30]. The
analysis in this paper extends these findings to show that
the age-related decline in MVPA is evident during the
early years of school. Importantly, our data also shows a
very substantial increase in sedentary time between Year
1 and 4, indicating that the children are not just less
active, they are also spending more time being sedentary.
Collectively these findings highlight a need to identify
the factors that are contributing to both the decrease in
MVPA and also the increase in sedentary time with age,
as both may be useful targets for strategies to attenuate
the decline in physical activity.
Girls who participated in Year 1 were more likely to
take part in the Year 4 assessment than boys, and children
who were a healthy weight in Year 1 were more likely to
participate in Year 4 than children who were obese. This
finding is comparable to previous analyses of the ALSPAC
cohort which reported that children attending the clinics
at ages 12, 14 and 16 were more likely to be girls and from
a higher social class [31]. Similarly, the Speedy study
reported that participants included in the analysis of
change in physical activity during the move from pri-
mary to secondary school were more likely to be girls
and from more affluent households, but they found no
differences by anthropometric assessments [6]. However,
analysis of the ROOTS study reported that participants
who provided data at age 15 and 17 who provided data at
both time points had a lower fat mass index (as measured
by bio-electrical impedance) at age 15 than those who only
provided data at age 15 [32]. These findings are important

 as they suggest that bias could be introduced by restricting
the sample to a “complete case” dataset.
A key issue in accelerometer studies is how “missing”
accelerometer data are handled and the implications that
those decisions have on sample bias. Prospective studies
that include objective measures of physical activity often
include a high level of missing data because either
participants were not present at both assessments
(attrition), or they provided only partial data at one
of the assessments. Partial data is a particular issue
for accelerometer-based physical activity studies in
which a participant is required to provide a number
of “valid days” at each time point, with 3 days often
used as a criteria [33, 34]. For example in the PEACH pro-
ject, accelerometer data were provided by 1307 children at
the end of primary school (10–11 years of age), and of
these, 953 (73%) children provided data a year later when
in the first year of secondary school (11–12 years of age)
[35]. However, due to missing data, the analysis sample
was further reduced to 518 participants, with 290 (30.4%)
of those with data at both time points excluded due to
incomplete accelerometer data [35]. The reduction in the
sample size for these analyses has the potential to intro-
duce selection bias to coefficient estimates as it may be
the case that there are some participant characteristics
such as baseline level of physical activity, body mass, or
socio-economic position that are related to data provision
[28, 36, 37]. By not taking account of these important
differences between the target population and the analysis
sample, the interpretation of study findings can be biased
and the data presented in this paper suggest that by limit-
ing the analysis sample to complete case we would have
introduced this kind of error.
In the analyses reported in this paper, we used mul-
tiple imputation methods to create a complete dataset
for 1837 children and their parents, and the complete
case and imputed dataset were broadly comparable with
the exception of parent ethnicity and employment status.
We recognise that there are limitations to the multiple
imputation approach. In particular, the method assumes
that data are missing at random (MAR) and thus any
differences between individuals whose data are observed
and those whose data are missing can be explained by
observed variables and these must be included in the im-
putation model [28]. However, if data are missing not at
random (MNAR) and there are reasons for missingness
that depend on unobserved data, once observed data are
taken into account, then the multiple imputation approach
will provide biased estimates and this bias increases with
the proportion of missing data [38]. In our analysis data
may be MNAR if, for example, children who experienced a
large decline in physical activity between Year 1 and Year 4
were less likely to participate at Year 4. We are unable
to assess from the observed data whether the MAR
assumption holds, however by including a wide range
of child and parent characteristics that were predictive
of missingness in our multiple imputation model we
aimed to reduce the possibility of data being MNAR
and minimise bias in our estimates of change in physical
activity. In our study, it is plausible that the multiple im-
putation approach reduced selection bias compared with
the complete case analysis since it allowed for the partici-
pants’ BMI, school, and socio-economic position to be
accounted for despite these not being required in the ana-
lysis model and therefore not incorporated in complete
case analysis. It also facilitated the creation of a markedly
larger sample size to increase precision in estimates of
physical activity change. Previous studies have suggested
that at least 3 days of valid accelerometer data are re-
quired to provide an indication of habitual physical activ-
ity patterns [33, 34], but we have included accelerometer
data for anyone with at least one valid day in order to
maximise the use of the data. A key issue for the field is,
however, how multiple imputation methods and partial
accelerometer data can be optimally combined to provide
the largest possible sample size while also providing the
most accurate representation of habitual physical activity.
The four UK Chief Medical Officers recommend that
all children and adolescents should engage in an hour
per day of MVPA [39], and this recommendation has re-
cently been highlighted as a key component of the Eng-
lish
childhood
obesity
strategy
[40].
Our
imputed
analyses showed that Year 4 boys engaged in an average
of 69 min of MVPA per day, but for girls the mean was
55 min of MVPA per day. Further examination of these
data showed that 62.3% of boys and 35.5% of girls met
the hour per day recommendation in Year 4. This was
compared with 72.5% of boys and 53.7% of girls in Year
1. As there is clear evidence that children’s physical ac-
tivity declines with age [8, 11] with girls less active than
boys at all ages, these findings highlight a need to de-
velop effective means of increasing children’s physical
activity and attenuating the age-related decline in activ-
ity during the primary school years.
Strengths and limitations
The key strength of this project is the provision of
detailed physical activity and related information from
children as they move through primary school and
their parents, which has facilitated a detailed examin-
ation of how physical activity behaviours have changed
within individuals. Moreover, we have demonstrated
that we can maximise the information available to cre-
ate a dataset of 1837 children and their families using
multiple imputation approaches. The study, is however,
limited by ten of the original schools not participating in
the follow-up assessment. The relatively homogenous sam-
ple, which is primarily of White British origin from a single

 UK area, also limits the ability to extrapolate to other ethnic
groups in more diverse areas of the UK. Where possible,
the data collection timelines were closely matched between
the two time points, however for some participants data
was collected in different months of the year, meaning that
weather effects and day length may have had an affect on
physical activity levels [41]. However, when we repeated
analysis restricting only to participants from schools where
the data collection at Year 4 was within 1 month of the data
collection at Year 1 (67% of participants) the findings were
essentially unchanged from those presented here.
Conclusions
Between Year 1 and Year 4 of primary school accelerometer
counts per minute decreased by 10% for boys and 8.6% for
girls. Minutes of MVPA decreased by 3 min (4%) for boys
and 7 min (11%) for girls, and sedentary time increased by
20% for boys and 23% for girls. Findings suggest that early
intervention to prevent the age-related decline in children’s
physical activity is needed and work to identify key effective
interventions is an urgent public health need.
