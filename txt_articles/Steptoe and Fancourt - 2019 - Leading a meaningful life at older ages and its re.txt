The sense that one is living a worthwhile and meaningful life is
fundamental to human flourishing and subjective well-being. Here,
we investigate the wider implications of feeling that the things one
does in life are worthwhile with a sample of 7,304 men and women
aged 50 and older (mean 67.2 y). We show that independently of age,
sex, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status, higher worth-
while ratings are associated with stronger personal relationships
(marriage/partnership, contact with friends), broader social engage-
ment (involvement in civic society, cultural activity, volunteering), less
loneliness, greater prosperity (wealth, income), better mental and
physical health (self-rated health, depressive symptoms, chronic
disease), less chronic pain, less disability, greater upper body strength,
faster walking, less obesity and central adiposity, more favorable
biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, plasma fibrinogen, white blood
cell count, vitamin D, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), health-
ier lifestyles (physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption,
sleep quality, not smoking), more time spent in social activities and
exercising, and less time spent alone or watching television. Longi-
tudinally over a 4-y period, worthwhile ratings predict positive
changes in social, economic, health, and behavioral outcomes in-
dependently of baseline levels. Sensitivity analyses indicate that these
associations are not driven by factors such as prosperity or depressive
symptoms, or by outcome levels before the measurement of worth-
while ratings. The feeling that life is filled with worthwhile activities
may promote healthy aging and help sustain meaningful social
relationships and optimal use of time at older ages.

T
he sense that one is living a meaningful and worthwhile life is
a key component of subjective well-being and human flour-
ishing (1) and is related to a range of social, economic, and
health factors (2). The importance of the concept to public policy
has been endorsed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in
the United Kingdom, which has included ratings of how worth-
while people think the things they do in their lives are within the
national program of personal well-being since 2011 (3).
Having a strong sense of purpose and meaning in life may be a
protective factor in relation to health, with longitudinal studies
documenting associations with reduced premature mortality,
slower development of age-related disability, reduced incidence
of cardiovascular disease, healthier lifestyles, and more pre-
ventive behaviors (4–6). Much of this research has focused on the
health domain, while studies on social, economic, and emotional
outcomes have largely been cross-sectional (2). Maintaining a sense
that life is worthwhile may be particularly important at older ages
when social and emotional ties often fragment, social engagement is
reduced, and health problems may limit personal options.
Accordingly, we tested the association between the ONS rat-
ing of life being worthwhile and a range of social, economic,
health, biomarker, and health-related behaviors in the English
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), a representative pop-
ulation sample of men and women aged 50 and over living in
England (7). Cross-sectional associations and longitudinal rela-
tionships between life being worthwhile and outcomes over a 4-y
period were analyzed. We also explored the relationship between
time use and having a meaningful life (8), so as to identify pat-
terns of social, solitary, and productive activities over the day.
Results
We analyzed data from 7,304 participants (3,250 men and 4,054
women) in wave 6 (2012) of ELSA. Ages ranged from 50 to over
90 y (mean 67.21, SD 9.11). Worthwhile ratings averaged 7.41 (SD
2.24, range 0–10) and showed a curvilinear association with age (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). Ratings of life being worthwhile were slightly
higher in women than men (means 7.46 vs. 7.35) and were posi-
tively associated with educational attainment and socioeconomic
status (SES) (P < 0.001; see SI Appendix, Table S1 for details).
Results from cross-sectional linear and logistic regression
analyses adjusted for age, sex, educational attainment, and SES
are detailed in Table 1, and results from longitudinal regression
analyses are given in Table 2. Key longitudinal findings are illus-
trated in Fig. 1 by dividing worthwhile ratings into five categories
(0–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, 9–10) and computing covariate-adjusted
percentages or means. Complete figures for all variables are
presented in SI Appendix. Sample sizes differed across outcomes
Significance
Ratings of the meaningfulness of life have been adopted in UK
national surveys and are advocated internationally. This study
demonstrates the value of a simple rating of the extent to
which people feel that the things they do in life are worth-
while, by documenting positive associations with social rela-
tionships and broader social engagement, economic prosperity,
mental and physical health, biomarkers, health-related behav-
iors, and time use. These associations were observed both
cross-sectionally and longitudinally, suggesting that feeling life
is worthwhile contributes to subsequent well-being and hu-
man flourishing at older ages. Given the widely recognized
policy importance of promoting subjective well-being at older
ages, a wider adoption of worthwhile ratings in large-scale
surveys would provide valuable policy-relevant evidence in-
ternationally.

 because of missing data and method of data collection (e.g., blood
draws), as detailed in SI Appendix, Table S2.
Social Variables. Higher worthwhile ratings were associated with an
increased likelihood of being married/having a partner, reduced
likelihood of living alone, having a greater number of close rela-
tionships, and more frequent contact with friends (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2). For example, 73.1% of participants with ratings of 9 or 10
had contact with friends at least on a weekly basis, declining to
47.1% of those with ratings of 0–2. Higher worthwhile ratings were
also associated with belonging to a greater number of organizations
such as social clubs, gyms, and churches, an increased probability of
volunteering on a regular basis, and greatly reduced loneliness.
Cultural activity, assessed in terms of going to museums, art
galleries, concerts, and theaters at least every few months, was also
more common among respondents with higher ratings of life being
worthwhile.
Worthwhile ratings at baseline also predicted social outcomes
4 y later, in wave 8 of ELSA (2016), independently of baseline
social measures (Table 2). Although few couples divorced over
this time period, the risk of divorce was lower among those with
higher worthwhile ratings at baseline (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Similarly, the risk of living alone in 2016 among those who were
not living alone at baseline was inversely associated with worthwhile
ratings. Number of close relationships in 2016 was positively
associated with worthwhile ratings independently of relation-
ships at baseline, while people without weekly contact with
friends were more likely to start this by 2016 if their baseline

 worthwhile ratings were higher. The number of organizations to
which a person belonged continued to be higher on follow-up,
adjusting for baseline levels, and loneliness in 2016 remained
lower in those with higher baseline worthwhile ratings. Interest-
ingly, continuing to volunteer was predicted by baseline worthwhile
ratings, and there was a 7% increase in the odds of initiating cul-
tural activity for every point increase in worthwhile rating among
individuals who were not culturally active at baseline.
Economic Variables. We analyzed three indicators of prosperity
and economic activity (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Leading a worth-
while life was associated with an 11% increased odds of having
wealth in the top tertile (highest third of the wealth distribution)
and 10% increased odds of income in the top tertile, adjusting
for age, sex, education, and SES. Similar results emerged when
wealth and income were modeled as continuous variables. Peo-
ple with higher worthwhile ratings were also more likely to be in
paid employment; when these analyses were repeated on people
aged 65 or younger, the same pattern emerged, with an odds
ratio (OR) of 1.13 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.09–1.17, P <
0.001]. Longitudinally, worthwhile ratings at baseline predicted
wealth 4 y later, after taking baseline wealth into account (Table 2).
Health Variables, Biomarkers, and Physical Capability. Worthwhile
ratings were consistently related to better self-rated health, less
limiting longstanding illness, less chronic disease (coronary dis-
ease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and chronic lung disease),
and a lower likelihood of impaired activities of daily living (ADLs,
such as difficulty bathing or showering), instrumental ADLs (e.g.,
difficulty managing money), and less chronic pain (Table 1 and SI
Appendix, Fig. S6). For instance, 56.6% of respondents with rat-
ings of 0–2 were in fair or poor health compared with 17.9% of
those with ratings of 9 or 10. The associations with depressive
symptoms were particularly pronounced, with a 35% reduced
odds of having depressive symptoms above threshold per unit
increase in worthwhile rating. These differences were supported
by associations with biomarkers and objective indices of physical
capability. Higher worthwhile ratings were significantly related to
stronger hand grip, less objectively measured obesity and central
adiposity, faster gait speed, lower plasma C-reactive protein and
fibrinogen concentrations, lower white blood cell counts, higher
vitamin D concentration, and better lipid profiles (Table 1 and SI
Appendix, Figs. S7 and S8). Baseline worthwhile ratings were also
inversely associated with self-rated health and limiting long-
standing illness 4 y later, adjusting for baseline levels as well as
other covariates (Table 2). The incidence of new chronic disease
was reduced among people with higher worthwhile ratings, as was
the incidence of impaired ADLs among respondents who did not
report impairment at baseline. New cases of depressive symptoms
and new cases of moderate or severe chronic pain were signifi-
cantly less common (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Blood was obtained
from only a subset of participants, and grip strength was not
measured in 2016, so these variables have not been analyzed
longitudinally. However, objectively measured obesity on follow-
up was inversely associated with worthwhile ratings at baseline,
while gait speed was faster in those with higher worthwhile ratings
after adjustment for baseline gait speed.
Health-Related Behaviors. We tested associations between worth-
while ratings and several health-related behaviors (Table 1 and
SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Respondents with higher worthwhile
ratings were more likely to report moderate or vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) at least weekly and were less likely to be sed-
entary. They were also more likely to eat at least five portions of
fruit and vegetables per day (as recommended in UK health
guidelines). People with higher worthwhile ratings were more

 likely to rate their sleep as good or very good and were less likely
to smoke. At 4 y follow-up, the associations with health behaviors
persisted, and worthwhile ratings predicted new healthy changes
(Table 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S11). There was an 11% increase
in the odds of taking up MVPA among those who were not active
at baseline and a lower risk of becoming sedentary. People with
higher worthwhile ratings who were not eating at least five
portions of fruit and vegetables at baseline were more likely to
do so on follow-up, and worthwhile ratings predicted sustained
good sleep. A positive association between worthwhile ratings
and alcohol consumption emerged at follow-up, but there was no
relationship with smoking after baseline smoking status had been
taken into account.
Time Use. Worthwhile ratings were positively associated with time
spent with friends or family on the previous day, time spent
walking or exercising, and time spent working or volunteering,
after adjustment for covariates (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Con-
versely, worthwhile ratings were negatively related to time spent
alone and time watching television (TV). For instance, people
with low worthwhile ratings spent twice as much time alone on
average than those with high worthwhile ratings. Time use was
not reassessed in 2016, but it was measured in wave 7 (2014) of
ELSA. Consequently, longitudinal analyses were conducted over
a 2 y period. Higher worthwhile ratings were positively related to
time spent with friends, walking/exercising, and working/volun-
teering and negatively related to time spent alone and watching
TV (Table 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S13). These associations ad-
justed for baseline time use, so indicate that worthwhile ratings
predict time spent in different activities in the future.
Sensitivity Analyses. Differences in prosperity or in depressive
mood might underlie the apparent associations between life
being worthwhile and other measures. We reasoned that if this
was the explanation, associations between worthwhile ratings
and other measures would be eliminated or greatly reduced if
these factors were included as covariates. Results (summarized
in SI Appendix, Tables S3–S6) indicate that the large majority of
cross-sectional and longitudinal associations remained signifi-
cant, with only the strength of some associations slightly reduced.
A second set of sensitivity analyses controlled for levels of out-
comes before the assessment of worthwhile ratings, involving a
uniform set of covariates across outcomes as advised by VanderWeele
et al. (9). We therefore included as covariates measures of
marital status, wealth, self-rated health, depressive symptoms,
and smoking obtained in 2010, 2 y before worthwhile ratings
were assessed. The results (shown in SI Appendix, Tables S7 and
S8) indicate that 33 of the 38 cross-sectional associations
remained robust, as did 16 of 32 longitudinal findings under
these stringent conditions. The sample size was reduced be-
cause 663 individuals joined the study in 2012, and this may
partly account for these results.
Discussion
Meaning of life is a complex concept involving notions of life
being comprehensible and coherent, having purpose and di-
rection, as well as having significance and being worth living (10).
The sense of life being worthwhile is a component of eudemonia
(10). It is also correlated with hedonic well-being (feelings of joy
or sadness) and with evaluative well-being (life satisfaction), and
these facets together contribute to overall subjective well-being
(11). Our analyses indicate that ratings of doing worthwhile
things among older people show associations with a wide spec-
trum of social, economic, health, biological, and behavioral
factors both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Analyses con-
trolled for a number of time-invariant factors that potentially
impinge on these outcomes, including age, sex, educational back-
ground and SES. Sensitivity analyses showed that the associations
were not driven by economic resources or negative emotional
states (operationalized as depressive symptoms). The E value
is an indicator of the minimum strength of association that an
unmeasured confounder would need to fully explain away an
association. E-values were relatively modest, which could suggest
that further inclusion of confounders would lead to the attenuation
of results (12). Additionally, we followed recent recommenda-
tions for outcome-wide studies in including a range of preexposure
variables in sensitivity analyses (9).
Cross-sectionally, worthwhile ratings were associated with
stronger personal relationships (marriage, number of close
relationships, regular contact with friends) and broader social
engagement (involvement in organizations, cultural activity,
volunteering), while living alone and loneliness were related to
lower worthwhile ratings. Longitudinally, it has been shown that
social, cultural, and volunteer engagement predict purpose in life
(13, 14). In these analyses, we found the reverse: worthwhile
ratings predict greater contact with friends, a lower likelihood of
living alone, greater cultural engagement, and a greater likeli-
hood of persistent volunteering over 4 y. The feeling that one is
doing worthwhile things in life therefore appears not only to be
the product of social relationships and activities but also to con-
tribute to future personal relationships and prosocial outcomes.
We found a positive association between worthwhile ratings
and wealth and income, and a longitudinal relationship with fu-
ture wealth over 4 y that was independent of current wealth. Since
these associations were independent of occupational prestige and
education, they do not merely reflect SES effects but distinct
processes related to economic prosperity. An analysis of the
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study showed that sense of
purpose predicts greater income and net wealth independently of
covariates (15). The present results extend these observations into
older ages.
The analyses of health variables indicate that the sense of
doing worthwhile things in life is related to healthier profiles
in terms of better self-rated health, less limiting illness and
chronic disease, fewer depressive symptoms, less disability, and
less chronic pain. Worthwhile ratings also predicted less incidence
of chronic disease, depressive symptoms, and the development of
disability and chronic pain over 4 y. We were able to corroborate
these associations with analyses of objective measures of physical
function, finding negative cross-sectional associations with obesity
and waist circumference as well as longitudinal associations with
obesity (waist circumference was only measured cross-sectionally).
We also identified cross-sectional associations with upper body
strength and longitudinal relationships with gait speed. These ef-
fects mesh with our results concerning the development of dis-
ability and physical activity and sedentary behavior, implicating a
meaningful life in the maintenance of physical capability and ac-
tivities at older ages. Not only are these important facets of sustained
healthy life, they are also relevant to reduced risk of premature
mortality (16).
The biomarker panel included three indicators of inflamma-
tion: C-reactive protein, plasma fibrinogen, and white blood cell
count, all of which showed marked inverse associations with
worthwhile ratings. Purpose in life has previously been associ-
ated with lower levels of single inflammatory markers (17), a
finding extended in our study to include further measures
known to predict future cardiovascular disease, less healthy
aging, poorer mental health, and premature mortality (18, 19).
Additionally, we found associations with higher vitamin D
concentration, which has been linked with a range of health
outcomes, while the inverse relationship with HDL-cholesterol
is relevant to reduced cardiovascular disease risk. In combina-
tion, the objective biomarker data document a generally fa-
vorable profile of biological risk among people who feel their
activities are worthwhile.

SOCIAL SCIENCES
 The health of older people with higher worthwhile ratings is
also likely sustained by health-related behaviors such as fruit and
vegetable consumption, physical activity, good sleep and not
smoking. Worthwhile ratings predicted future increases in fruit
and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and sustained sleep
quality over the follow-up period independently of baseline
levels, extending previous findings linking health behaviors with
broader dimensions of subjective well-being (11). The alcohol
results are harder to interpret, since worthwhile ratings were
associated with an increase in alcohol consumption over time but
not with baseline levels. However, the relationship between al-
cohol consumption and well-being may be curvilinear, with both
abstinence and high levels associated with poorer mental health
(20). The increases in consumption seen here may also reflect
changes from very low to moderate levels of intake.
The associations we observed between worthwhile ratings and
time use support our findings with broader social and behavioral
measures. Worthwhile ratings were inversely associated not only
with loneliness and living alone, but also with time spent alone
on the previous day; a similar pattern has been described in the
Health and Retirement Study (21). The observation that people
with higher worthwhile ratings spent more time walking or ex-
ercising is consistent with the physical activity results. In other
studies of time use, work and volunteering emerge as among the
most rewarding activities in population samples (8), and this is
endorsed by the associations between time spent in these activities
and worthwhile ratings.
There was considerable variation in the strength of associa-
tions between worthwhile ratings and other variables. Both cross-
sectionally and longitudinally, the strongest effects related to
emotional well-being (depressive symptoms, loneliness), dis-
ability (ADLs), health behaviors (physical activity, sleep), and
social function (close relationships, marriage). Notably, these
associations cut across several different domains, with no single
area appearing to predominate. This attests to the broad signifi-
cance of the feelings that the things we do in life are worthwhile.
This is an observational study, so causal conclusions cannot be
drawn, and unmeasured confounders may be relevant. Rela-
tionships are likely to be bidirectional, but the fact that worth-
while ratings predict future levels of such a wide range of
outcomes independently of baseline values suggests that living a
meaningful life may contribute to future health and optimal
aging. In the context of this broad population study, we were only
able to address rather general factors relevant to the sense that
the things we do in life are worthwhile, and idiosyncratic factors
will be relevant to each individual. Worthwhile activities in later
life may center around maintaining harmonious family rela-
tionships, working toward goals in hobbies, the achievements of a
favorite sports team, communing with nature, religious or spiritual
faith, making money, intellectual accomplishment, satisfaction
with work, stimulating travel, or other experiences. However,
whatever the source, our findings suggest that engaging in activi-
ties perceived to be worthwhile has wide ramifications across
many domains of human experience at older ages. This simple
measure of life being worthwhile has been implemented in a
number of national surveys in the United Kingdom, including the
Annual Population Survey, the Wealth and Assets Survey, and the
National Crime Survey. Wider adoption in other national and
international surveys would provide important policy-relevant
evidence.
Materials and Methods
Participants and Measures. Data were analyzed from the English Longitudinal
Study of Ageing (ELSA), a nationally representative longitudinal panel study
of English adults aged 50 and older (7). See SI Appendix for details. The study
was approved through the National Research Ethics Service, and all partici-
pants provided informed consent. Life being worthwhile was assessed
through answers to the question “to what extent do you feel the things you
do in your life are worthwhile?” with responses from 0 = not at all to 10 =
very. Covariates, social, economic, health, biomarkers and health behaviors
are detailed in SI Appendix. We measured time use with an adaptation of
the Day Reconstruction Method devised for the Health and Retirement
Study (22), asking about the amount of time spent on selected activities over
the previous day.
Statistical Analysis. Associations with social, economic, health, and biological
factors were analyzed using logistic regression for binary outcomes and
ordinary least squares regression for continuous outcomes, with worthwhile
ratings being modeled as a continuous variable. We included age, sex, ed-
ucational attainment, and socioeconomic status (SES) defined by occupa-
tional standing as covariates. We also computed E-values: indicators of how
robust findings are to potential unmeasured confounding (12).
