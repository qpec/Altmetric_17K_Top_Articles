STUDY QUESTION: Is physical activity associated with incident early menopause?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Physical activity is not associated with incident early menopause.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Lifestyle factors such as physical activity may influence menopause timing, but results from prior research
are inconsistent.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We evaluated the association between physical activity and the occurrence of early natural meno-
pause in a prospective cohort study, the Nurses’ Health Study II. Women were followed prospectively from 1989 to 2011.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Our analysis included 107 275 women who were premenopausal at baseline.
Menopause status was self-reported biennially. Time per week participating in specific activities was reported approximately every 4 years
and used to calculate metabolic task hours per week (MET h/week). We used Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the association
between physical activity and incidence of natural menopause before age 45 years while controlling for potential confounding factors.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were 2 786 study members who experienced menopause before the age of
45. After adjustment for age, smoking and other factors, we observed no association between adulthood physical activity and early meno-
pause. For example, compared to women reporting <3 MET h/week, the hazard ratio for women in the highest category (≥42 MET h/week)
of cumulatively-averaged total physical activity was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.76–1.04; P-trend: 0.26). Neither moderate nor strenuous
activity in adolescence and young adulthood were related to risk. The relation of physical activity and early menopause did not vary across
strata of body mass index or smoking status.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Physical activity and menopausal status were self-reported, but repeated assessment of
physical activity and prospective report of menopause status likely reduce the potential for non-differential misclassification. While the major-
ity of our study participants were white, it is unlikely that the physiological relation of activity and early menopause varies by ethnicity.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Findings from our large prospective study do not support an important association
between physical activity and early menopause.

National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. No competing interests are declared.

 Introduction
Early menopause, defined as the cessation of menstruation before age
45, is experienced by approximately 10% of women (Jacobsen et al.,
2003; Broekmans et al., 2009; Shuster et al., 2010). Early menopause is
associated with an increased risk of premature mortality, cardiovascu-
lar disease and other chronic conditions (van Der Voort et al., 2003;
Miller, 2012; Wellons et al., 2012; Bleil et al., 2013; Torrealday and Pal,
2015). Genetic factors alone do not explain the development of early
menopause, and recent studies suggests that modifiable lifestyle fac-
tors may also influence risk, including physical activity (Aydin et al.,
2005; Ortega-Ceballos et al., 2006; Dratva et al., 2007; Dorjgochoo
et al., 2008; Nagata et al., 2012; Emaus et al., 2013; Gold et al., 2013).
In premenopausal women, physical activity may influence ovarian
function by altering production of estrogens and other steroid hor-
mones via the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis (Tworoger et al.,
2007). Intense physical activity can disrupt regular ovarian cycles, lead-
ing to luteal phase insufficiency, anovulation and amenorrhea; these
may be associated with a lower risk of early menopause as they are
associated with a lower frequency of ovulation and a slower rate of
exhaustion of the follicle pool (Gudmundsdottir et al., 2009). Most
prior research of physical activity and menopause has primarily
addressed a potential relation with menopausal timing more generally.
Prospective studies have yielded inconsistent findings. Only two stud-
ies of physical activity and early menopause specifically have been con-
ducted; both were based on small sample sizes and observed point
estimates consistent with a strong inverse association, but the results
were not statistically significant. It thus remains unclear whether phys-
ical activity may be importantly related to risk of early menopause.
We evaluated the relation of physical activity at multiple ages with
risk of early menopause in the prospective Nurses’ Health Study II
(NHSII).
Materials and Methods
Participants
The NHSII cohort includes of 116 429 female US registered nurses aged
25–42 years in 1989. Participants completed questionnaires assessing life-
style factors and medical conditions every two years thereafter. Follow-up
rates for each questionnaire cycle were least 89%. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham, Women Hospital
in Boston, MA and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.
Assessment of physical activity
In study questionnaires in 1989, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2009, women
reported the average time per week during the past year spent on recre-
ational activities. In 1989, activities included walking, jogging, running,
bicycling (including on a stationary machine), racquet sports, lap swimming,
calisthenics and other aerobic activities. In later years, activities were
expanded to include weight training, low intensity exercises like yoga and
high intensity activities like lawn mowing. Response options ranged from 0
minutes to ≥11 h/week. In 1997, women also reported the average
amount of time per week spent on moderate and strenuous recreational
activities at three ages: grades 7–8 (ages 12–13), grades 9–12 (ages 14–17)
and ages 18–22, 23–30 and 30–34. Response options ranged from none to
≥11 h/week. To incorporate the frequency, duration and intensity of
activity, we multiplied hours per week of each activity by its metabolic
equivalent (MET) score, with one MET equal to 1 kcal/kg/h or the energy
expended by sitting quietly (Ainsworth et al., 2000), and then summed
values for all activities to create total MET hours/week.
Assessment of early menopause
In 1989 and on each subsequent biennial questionnaire, women were
asked if their menstrual periods had ceased permanently, and if so, at what
age, and whether cessation was related to surgery, radiation or chemo-
therapy or occurred naturally. Information regarding use of hormone ther-
apy (HT) was collected as well. Age at menopause was defined as age after
12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. A small number of women
reported being postmenopausal on one questionnaire and then subse-
quently reported being premenopausal. For these women, we defined age
at menopause as age after which periods were absent for 12 months or
more, and then confirmed that this status persisted for at least three con-
secutive questionnaires.
Eligibility for the current analysis was limited to women who were pre-
menopausal and reported physical activity at the baseline 1989 question-
naire (n = 107 275). Women were followed for incidence of menopause
until June 2011. We defined cases as those women who reported natural
menopause before age 45.
Covariate assessment
Information on race, ethnicity, age, education, height and age at menarche
was collected at baseline. Information on parity, oral contraceptive (OC)
use, HT use and smoking was collected biennially since baseline. Current
weight and body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) were also
assessed biennially. Information on diet was collected using semi-
quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in 1991 and every 4
years thereafter (Willet et al., 1985). Additional information on dietary
supplement use, including vitamin D and calcium, was collected on main
NHSII questionnaires. Nutrient intake was adjusted for total energy using
the residual method (Willett, 2012).
Statistical analysis
We divided women into categories of total MET hours/week and then
compared the distribution of covariates at baseline with physical activity in
age-adjusted general linear models. We evaluated the relation of category
of physical activity with incidence of early menopause using Cox propor-
tional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI). Women contributed person-time in months from the date
of return of the baseline questionnaire (1989) until menopause, hysterec-
tomy, oophorectomy, diagnosis of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin
cancer), death, loss to follow-up, age 45 or June 2011, whichever came
first.
We modeled total physical activity participation in adulthood in three
ways: (1) MET h/week at baseline (1989) only; (2) updating MET h/week
data every 4 years; (3) cumulatively averaging MET h/week, updated every
4 years; this method uses the mean MET h/week from all prior physical
activity assessments as a measure of long-term physical activity (Eliassen
et al., 2010). In addition, we evaluated associations of early menopause
with the cumulative average of time spent walking, as walking was the
most common activity reported by participants. Risk associated with mod-
erate and strenuous activity in adolescence, early and middle adulthood
was also assessed.
In addition to models adjusting for age, we built a multivariate model
controlling for time-varying factors including age, pack-years of smoking,
parity, breastfeeding duration, alcohol intake, percentage of total calories
from vegetable protein, and vitamin D from dairy intake, as well as age at
menarche (time invariant); these covariates were selected a priori based

 on previous studies of early menopause in our population (Purdue-Smithe
et al., 2017, Boutot et al., 2018, Whitcomb et al., 2018). We created a
second multivariate model additionally controlling for BMI (time-varying),
given that adiposity could be a confounder or intermediate in the pathway;
BMI and physical activity are closely related, and prior research in the same
population found that underweight women are at increased risk for early
menopause (Szegda et al., 2017). To test for linear trend, we assigned the
median activity level of each category to all women in that category and
used median values in regression models.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. We stratified analyses to
evaluate whether hazard ratio estimates were comparable across categor-
ies of BMI, smoking status and current OC use, using likelihood ratio tests
to compare models with and without multiplicative interaction terms.
Finally, because HT use may contribute to misclassification of menopause
status, we ran additional models censoring at first use of HT. Statistical ana-
lyses were conducted with SAS v9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
During 20 years of follow-up, 2786 members of the analytic cohort
experienced incident early menopause. Overall, women reporting
higher physical activity were somewhat younger, had lower BMI at
baseline and recalled BMI at age 18, and lower parity compared to
those reporting lower activity overall (Table I). Greater physical activ-
ity was associated with slightly longer duration of OCs use, and higher
intake of alcohol, vegetable protein and vitamin D.
In results from age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, phys-
ical activity at baseline was not associated with risk of early menopause
(Table II). For example, compared to women who reported <3 MET
h/week, women reporting ≥42 MET h/week of activity had a HR of
early menopause of 0.92 (95% CI = 0.81–1.06; P-trend = 0.34).
Results adjusting for covariates (Model 2) were similar, and additional
adjustment for BMI had minimal impact. Results from analyses model-
ing updated and cumulatively-averaged physical activity were consist-
ent with models of baseline activity, suggesting no association with
early menopause risk. No association was observed for time spent
walking and early menopause risk. In results from fully adjusted mod-
els, women reporting a cumulative average of 4 or more h/week of
walking had a HR of early menopause of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.76–1.04)
compared to women reporting no walking (P-trend = 0.26). Time
spent per week in moderate and strenuous activity at ages 23–39 and
30–34 were also unrelated to risk of early menopause (results not
shown).

Physical activity and early menopause
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/humrep/dey267/5077232 by guest on 07 September 2018
 In results stratified by BMI and OC use, estimates were very similar
between strata and we observed no evidence of effect modification
(Table III). In results stratified by smoking status, we observed no asso-
ciation among ever-smokers. Among never smokers, we observed
some evidence of an inverse relation between activity and risk, with
women averaging at least 42 MET h/week having a 23% lower risk of
early menopause compared to women reporting <3 MET h/week
(HR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.63–0.95; P-trend = 0.07), but the test for
interaction was not significant (P-interaction = 0.34). Results from
models censoring at first HT use were highly similar to those of the
main analysis (results not shown).
We did not find moderate or strenuous activity at any age (12–13
years, 14–17 years or 18–22 years) to be associated with risk of early
menopause (Table IV).
Discussion
In this prospective study, we did not find any substantial evidence that
participation in physical activity was associated with risk of early meno-
pause. In our main analyses, the results were null across all levels of
physical activity, even for women reporting the equivalent to 4 or
more hours of running or 8 or more hours of brisk walking per week
compared to inactive women. Analyses limited to never smokers sug-
gested the possibility of a modestly lower risk among women reporting
consistently high levels of activity. High levels of moderate and intense
physical activity in adolescence and early adulthood were unrelated to
risk of early menopause.
The association of physical activity and early menopause was
assessed previously in a prospective study among 3 435 women fol-
lowed for approximately 12 years, during which time 124 cases of
early menopause were observed (Gudmundsdottir et al., 2013).
Compared to women reporting no activity, HRs of early menopause
(95% CI) among women reporting high and very high activity were
0.68 (0.28–1.68) and 0.21 (0.02–1.78), respectively. In a cross-
sectional analysis of 1 829 women in the Oslo Health Study that
observed early menopause in 9.6% of the cohort, the odds ratio for
early menopause among women reporting ≥3 h/week of activity ver-
sus none was 0.70 (95% CI = 0.38–1.30) (Mikkelsen et al., 2007).
Despite low point estimates in these two studies, small numbers of
cases and low statistical power resulted in wide confidence intervals;
our large prospective study including more than 2 700 incident early
menopause cases suggests no inverse association.

 Associations from previous cohort studies of activity and meno-
pause timing have generally been small in magnitude, if not entirely null
(Bromberger et al., 1997; Nilsson et al., 1997; Nagata et al., 2000;
Palmer et al., 2003; Nagel et al., 2005; Dorjgochoo et al., 2008; Nagata
et al., 2012; Emaus et al., 2013; Gold et al., 2013; Gudmundsdottir
et al., 2013). For example, in a cross-sectional analysis in the
Breakthrough Generations Study (n = 50 678) women, women
reporting any strenuous exercise at ages 30–49 had a HR for meno-
pause of 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93–0.98; P = 0.003) compared to women
with no strenuous activity (Morris et al., 2012). Though statistically

Physical activity and early menopause

 significant, the magnitude of effect was very small, and the median age
at menopause was 52 years in both strenuously active and inactive
women.
Results were similar in magnitude in the California Teachers Study
(n > 97 000 women), the largest prospective study conducted to date
of activity and menopause timing (Emaus et al., 2013). Women in the
highest quartile of long-term physical activity (equivalent to ≥6 h/
week each year from high school through age 45–54) had a HR for
menopause of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92–0.98; P-trend = 0.005) compared
to the least active women. Results differed by smoking status, but in
the opposite direction from what we observed; associations were null
for never smokers but were significant in heavy smokers (HR = 0.89;
95% CI = 0.80–0.99 for current heavy smokers). Cumulatively, phys-
ical activity appears either unassociated with early menopause or only
modestly linked, with magnitudes of association of likely limited clinical
relevance.
A potential limitation of our study is our use of self-reported physical
activity, rather than objective measurement, which likely contributes
to misclassification. However, our physical activity questionnaire has
demonstrated good reproducibility and validity as compared with
7-day diaries (Wolf et al., 1994). Also, these physical activity measures
have been significantly associated with other health outcomes such as
depression, breast cancer and colon cancer in the NHS2, suggesting
that misclassification is likely not substantial enough to obscure import-
ant associations (Maruti et al., 2008; Lucas et al., 2011; Morikawa
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Du et al., 2012). While menopause
timing was self-reported as well, the prospective report of onset of
menopause has been demonstrated to have high reproducibility over
multiple questionnaire cycles (Colditz et al., 1987). We note that
residual confounding by psychosocial stress, employment status and
other factors potentially related to menopause timing may persist if
these were also related to physical activity levels in our population.

 Additionally, while we know of no data suggesting that the physiology
underlying a relation between physical activity and menopausal timing
differs by race/ethnicity, we were unable to evaluate potential effect
modification by race/ethnicity, as the majority of NHS2 participants
were white.
In summary, although physical activity has been shown to have wide
ranging positive health effects overall, results of this large, prospective
study do not support an important role of physical activity with regard
to risk of early menopause.
