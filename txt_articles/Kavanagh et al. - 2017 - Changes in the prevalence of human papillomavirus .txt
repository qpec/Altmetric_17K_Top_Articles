Abstract 
Background 
In September 2008, Scotland launched routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, 
targeted at 12-13-year-old girls, of whom 92.4% were fully vaccinated in 2008/9.  In this study, 
we report on vaccine effectiveness of the bivalent vaccine in these vaccinated women who 
attended for routine cervical screening at age 20-21. 
Methods 
In this seven year cross-sectional study (covering birth cohorts 1988-1995) we sampled 
approximately 1000 samples per year from those attending cervical screening at age 20-21 
and tested each for HPV.  By linkage to vaccination records we ascertain prevalence by birth 
cohort and vaccination status. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) for HPV 16/18, HPV 
31/33/45, other high-risk types and any HPV are calculated using logistic regression. 
Findings 
In total, 8584 samples were HPV genotyped. HPV 16/18 prevalence reduced substantially 
from 30.0% (95% CI 26.9-33.1) in 1988 cohort to 4.5% (95% CI 3.5-5.7) in 1995 giving a 
VE=89.1% (95% CI: 85.1-92.3%) for those vaccinated at age 12-13.  All cross protective types 
showed significant VE (HPV 31: VE=93.8% (95% CI: 83.8-98.5); HPV 33: VE=79.1% (95% CI 
64.2-89.0); HPV 45: VE=82.6% (95% CI 61.5-93.9)). Unvaccinated individuals born in 1995 
have a reduced odds of HPV16/18 infection compared to those in 1988 (adjusted OR=0.13; 
95% CI: 0.06-0.27) and reduced odds of HPV 31/33/45 (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.89). 
Interpretation 
Bivalent vaccination has led to a startling reduction in vaccine and cross-protective types 
which have almost disappeared in this population, 7 years following vaccination. We also 
evidence herd protection against the vaccine specific and cross-protective types, in 
unvaccinated individuals born in 1995. The success of the vaccination programme and the 
evidence presented must now be considered in cost-effectiveness models informing vaccine 
choice and models to shape the future of cervical screening programmes.

Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have collated population-based data 
demonstrating early evidence of the effectiveness of the HPV vaccination programme in high-
income countries. These studies showed a significant reduction in HPV 16/18 associated with 
vaccine. Although reduction in HPV 31 was suggested, there was no evidence of a reduction 
in HPV 31, 33 and 45 as a group. Studies included in these reviews covered both the bivalent 
and quadrivalent vaccines, had differing levels of vaccine uptake, were often ecological 
studies comparing prevalence in different time frames and were focused on those vaccinated 
at older ages as part of catch-up cohorts.  
On 8 March 2016, we conducted a PubMed search using the same strategy outlined in the 
2015 review - (“papillomavirus vaccine”, “papillomavirus vaccination”, “HPV vaccine”, or “HPV 
vaccination”) and (“program evaluation”, “population surveillance”, “sentinel surveillance”, 
“incidence”, or “prevalence”), with 151 articles published in the intervening period (1 Feb 2014-
8 March 2016), and found a further 6 studies, including our own work, reporting population-
based HPV prevalence in vaccinated populations from England, Scotland, Sweden, Australia 
and USA (2 studies) with all bar the UK studies evaluating the impact of the quadrivalent 
vaccine. The populations studied were generally vaccinated during catch-up campaigns and 
were attending cervical screening at age 25 or above, or were vaccinated at an earlier age 
and observed as part of screening high risk populations or through national surveys using self-
collected samples. For the majority of studies, individual vaccination status was not known, 
rather changes in HPV prevalence pre- and post-vaccination were examined. No studies have 
currently presented population-based evidence for those vaccinated at age 12/13 where 
vaccine status is known.  With the exception of our own work, no statistically significant 
evidence of vaccine effectiveness for the grouping of the cross-protective types was found in 
the aforementioned studies.  
 
Added value of this study 
This study is the first to present population-based evidence of the effectiveness of the bivalent 
HPV vaccine in girls vaccinated routinely at age 12/13 and attending for cervical screening at 
age 20.  We have shown that the vaccine-specific types HPV16/18 and the cross-protective 
types (31/33/45) have almost disappeared in this population, 7 years following the receipt of 
vaccine and present evidence of herd protection for all these types. We also demonstrate 
significant vaccine effect for the cross-protective types individually. 
 4 
Implications of all the available evidence 
These reductions in the most carcinogenic types of HPV, which are implicated in 90% of 
cervical cancers in Scotland, have clear implications for cervical screening in that the 
predictive value of cytology and HPV based screening strategies will reduce. Defining optimal 
screening intervals, age range, test and triage strategies for vaccinated women should be 
priorities for research. Our findings should inform the evaluation of screening programmes in 
vaccinated populations with high levels of uptake. There may be a time when current cytology 
or HPV based cervical screening programmes are no longer cost-effective. In addition, the 
levels of vaccine effectiveness observed, in particular for the cross-protective types may have 
implications for the comparative cost effectiveness assessment of the bivalent, quadrivalent 
and nonavalent HPV vaccines and our findings should be incorporated in the baseline 
assumptions of such evaluative models. If when evaluated under such models, the cross-
protective benefit is shown to improve cost-effectiveness then the bivalent vaccine remains a 
strong candidate for consideration in HPV immunisation programmes.

Introduction 
 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are responsible for 70-80% of cervical cancers 
in the UK1. HPV vaccination prevents infection with HPV 16 and 182-4 and is associated with 
a reduction in all grades of histological and cytological abnormalities according to data from 
population-based immunisation programmes5, 6.  The bivalent vaccine also provides 
immunological cross-protection against HPV 31, 33 and 45, high-risk oncogenic HPV types 
phylogenetically related to HPV 16 and 18, although the duration and scale of long-term cross-
protective immunity has been vigorously debated3, 7-9. The persistence of the cross-reactive 
antibody titres against HPV 31 and 45 after bivalent HPV vaccination has been demonstrated 
up to 9.4 years after the initial dose in the clinical trial setting10. These data are particularly 
relevant for Scotland since at least 90% of invasive cervical cancers are attributable to HPV 
16, 18, 31, 33 and 4511.  
 
To date, HPV vaccine impact data2-4, 7, 12 through national vaccination programmes are largely 
obtained from females immunised as part of “catch-up” cohorts which, in Scotland, included 
girls up to age 18.  While data derived from catch-up populations have been encouraging, they 
are likely to underestimate the effect as some females will have been exposed to HPV before 
vaccination. Cervical screening programmes, which constitute a critical and enriched resource 
for both monitoring HPV prevalence and outcomes, mostly screen from age 25 or older. 
Assessment of vaccine impact, prior to screening, has been possible either ecologically by 
conducting HPV testing in higher risk populations attending chlamydia screening13-15 or via 
national surveys16 reliant on self-reported vaccine status and self-collected samples.  There 
has thus far been limited opportunity to observe changes in prevalence in women routinely 
vaccinated at age 12/13.  
 
Until June 2016, cervical screening started aged 20 in Scotland. Therefore, using the ability 
to link individual screening and vaccination records, we can now report on effectiveness of the 
bivalent vaccine on both low- and high-risk HPV infections in 12/13-year old girls, of whom 
92.4% were fully vaccinated in 2008/917. Timely production and analyses of these data have 
significant implications for service planning and cost-effectiveness modelling to inform future 
cervical disease prevention policy.

Methods 
In September 2008, Scotland began school-based routine HPV vaccination, targeted at 12- 
13-year-old girls. Between 1 September 2008 and 31 August 2011, a 3-year catch-up 
programme for older girls (aged 13–18 years, born between 01/09/90 to 31/08/95) was also 
delivered, both at school and, for school leavers, at Health Board-run vaccination clinics or 
general practices. The 3-year catch-up programme attained a high uptake (87%) for all three 
doses among those vaccinated in school but a lower uptake (32%) was achieved in school 
leavers18.  Bivalent vaccination was delivered until September 2012 when a switch was made 
to quadrivalent vaccination.  All females in our study period were eligible for the bivalent 
vaccination. 
 
Since 2009, Health Protection Scotland (HPS) has co-ordinated a national HPV immunisation 
surveillance programme19 to assess the impact of HPV vaccine on viral and disease 
outcomes3-5, 20, 21.  This includes the assessment of type-specific HPV prevalence in females 
attending for their first cervical screen. This has been achieved by yearly (cross-sectional) 
collection and HPV genotyping of approximately 1000 residual liquid-based cytology (LBC) 
samples from women aged 20–21 from the years 2009 to 2015. Each sampling year covers 
at least two birth year cohorts for example, in 2009, individuals from 1988 and 1989 birth 
cohorts were sampled and in 2015, the collection primarily covered individuals from the 1994 
and 1995 cohorts. Vaccinated girls mainly entered the cervical screening programme from 
2011 and the inclusion of samples from 2009 and 2010 provides a relevant comparator group 
of those not offered vaccination through the National Health Service (NHS) immunisation 
programme. 
 
Residual LBC samples from cervical screening were collected from all 8 NHS cytopathology 
laboratories in Scotland. Each laboratory collected residual samples over a 1-2 month period, 
staggered throughout the year, to balance the workload. The target number from each 
laboratory was dictated by the size of the population served by the laboratory, ensuring a 
geographically representative sample. Each laboratory collected sequential residual LBC 
samples from women aged 20-21 attending in those months until they had met their target. 
Apart from age, no other information was known about the women at the point of collection. 
Samples were given a laboratory identification number and underwent HPV genotyping at the 
Scottish HPV Reference Laboratory (SHPVRL). Oversampling was conducted in 2009 to 
establish a baseline. The 2015 collection was extended into 2016 to maximise capture of those 
vaccinated at age 12-13, prior to the change in screening policy to start at age 25. 
 7 
All individuals resident in Scotland are listed on the Community Health Index (CHI) population 
register, allowing all patients using the NHS in Scotland to be uniquely identified by their CHI 
number. Cytopathology laboratories sent the laboratory identification number and the CHI 
number of samples selected for testing to the Information Services Division of the Scottish 
National Health Service.  CHI numbers were used to assign month and year of birth and to 
obtain vaccination data (dates of and type of vaccine) from the Scottish Immunisation Recall 
System. The postal code of the patient’s residence on attendance for screening was used to 
rank the geographic data zone for each sample according to the Scottish Index of Multiple 
Deprivation22 (SIMD) – the Scottish Governments official tool to identify areas of multiple 
deprivation based on combining information on seven domains covering employment, income, 
crime, housing, health, education and access. Each individual is categorised into SIMD 
quintiles (SIMD 1 = most deprived and SIMD 5 = least deprived). An anonymous patient 
identifier was then assigned to all records, the CHI and postcode were removed, and the 
resulting data sent to HPS. HPV test results and laboratory identification number were 
transferred to HPS from SHPVRL and were linked to vaccination data using the laboratory 
identification number which was then removed from the data set before analysis. No patient 
identifiable HPV results were available to anyone involved in the linkage or analysis. 
HPV genotyping was performed using a PCR based technology with luminex detection - the 
Optiplex HPV genotyping kit, (Diamex, Heidelberg, Germany). This assay has a high analytical 
sensitivity, detecting 24 HPV types - high-risk carcinogenic types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 
45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59); probable carcinogenic types (HPV 68); and some possibly 
carcinogenic types (HPV 26, 53, 66, 70, 73, and 82) – as defined by the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer23. This assay can also detect 5 low-risk HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 42, 
43, and 44).  
HPV genotyping was performed on all collections from 2009-15. In addition any sample 
collected in 2015/16 and found to be positive for HPV 16/18 by the Optiplex genotyping test, 
was also tested by the clinically validated Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV (HR-HPV) assay 
(RealTime; Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). This was to gain preliminary insight into the likely 
clinical significance of any residual HPV 16/18 infections in routinely vaccinated females. This 
test has a detection remit for high-risk and probable carcinogenic types with the sensitivity 
calibrated to detect high-grade lesions24.  
The sample collection of 1000 per year, was powered a priori to give at least a 99% power to 
detect a 15% reduction at first cervical screen in assumed overall HPV prevalence from 40 to 
34%, a 25% reduction in high-risk HPV prevalence from 25 to 19%, and a 40% reduction in 
HPV 16/18 prevalence at first cervical screen from 12 to 7%. The prevalence of each 
 8 
detectable HPV type, along with 95% CIs, was calculated and presented for each cohort year, 
study year, number of doses of vaccine received, SIMD quintile and age at vaccination.  
Association between HPV outcome and the number of doses of vaccine received (0, 1, 2 or 3 
doses) was measured by logistic regression to allow for adjustment for the impact deprivation 
score and birth cohort on HPV positivity. Both adjusted and unadjusted effects (odds ratios) 
are presented. Ordered factors were used to test for a linear change in positivity by dose, 
cohort and deprivation.  Vaccine effectiveness was estimated stratified by age at vaccination 
(for those receiving 3 doses) and pooled for all ages for those with incomplete dosage (1 or 2 
doses).  The odds ratio (OR) of each HPV outcome relative to those unvaccinated in all birth 
cohorts was calculated for each group adjusted for deprivation score using logistic regression.  
Vaccine effectiveness is then calculated as VE=100*(1-OR). 
The HPV groupings considered as outcomes were positivity for any of the following HPV types 
- HPV 16/18; HPV 31/33/45; other non-vaccine HR-HPV types (35/39/51/52/56/58/59/68); or 
any type detected by the genotyping HPV assay. In addition, HPV 31, 33 and 45 were 
evaluated individually. Potential herd immunity was evaluated in women who were not 
vaccinated during 2009–2015 by using logistic regression and testing for a linear trend over 
the successive annual cohorts for the prevalence of HPV 16/18, the cross-protective types, 
other non-vaccine high-risk types, and any HPV. Descriptive analysis of HPV 16/18 positivity 
using the RealTime and Optiplex on samples collected in 2015 was performed.  
National surveillance was approved through the NHS National Clinical Governance 
committees and Caldicott Guardians at individual NHS Boards. Data linkage of information 
was approved by the NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) CHI advisory group. 
Monitoring and evaluation of the HPV immunisation programme in Scotland is funded by the 
Scottish Government. This research was also partially funded by the CSO grant, CZH/4/528.

Results 
Over the seven surveillance years, 8708 LBC samples were collected. Sixty-one entries were 
excluded as SIMD quintile could not be linked and a further 63 could not be HPV genotyped. 
The remaining 8584 samples were successfully HPV genotyped and formed the study 
population. Supplementary Table 1 describes the breakdown by year. In the 2009 collection 
year, females attending for first smear born in 1988 and 1989 were not eligible for routine 
vaccination hence 98.5% were unvaccinated.  The proportion of vaccinated individuals 
increased with study year; 33.6% of those in 2011 were vaccinated with 3 doses compared to 
86.0% in 2015 (Supplementary Table 1). The data are consistently distributed by SIMD quintile 
(~20% expected in each group).  
HPV 16/18 prevalence reduced substantially from 28.9% (95% CI: 26.7, 31.1%) in 2009 to 
4.8% (95% CI: 3.8, 5.9%) in 2015 (unadjusted OR=0.12; linear p-value<0.0001; Table 1).  
Stratifying by birth cohort and vaccination status (Figure 1A) indicates a clear linear decline in 
HPV16/18 in successive birth cohorts (unadjusted OR (1995 cohort vs 1988 cohort) =0.11, 
linear p-value<0.0001; Table 1). The overall impact of vaccination on HPV16/18 prevalence, 
adjusted for birth cohort and SIMD, summarised in Table 2, shows a clear increase in 3 dose 
vaccine effectiveness (VE) in those receiving vaccine with earlier age of vaccination. For those 
vaccinated with 3 doses at age 18 resident in the most deprived areas (SIMD 1), VE=28.9% 
(95%CI: 4.5-47.8%) compared with VE=89.1% (95% CI: 85.1-92.3%) for the same group of 
women vaccinated at age 12/13. In the 1995 cohort, 59 (4.5%) of individuals were positive for 
HPV16/18 (58 HPV 16 positive, 1 HPV 18 positive) according to the Optiplex assay; 8 were 
unvaccinated, 1 person had 1 dose, 1 person had 2 doses and the remaining 49 individuals 
were fully vaccinated. When the 58 HPV 16/18 positive samples were tested with RealTime, 
only 7 individuals were positive for HPV 16, 4 of whom were fully vaccinated and 3 
unvaccinated. Incomplete immunisation led to lower estimates of VE – 2 doses had an overall 
VE=39.0% (95% CI: 21.3-53.3%) and 1 dose VE=27.6% (95% CI: 0.7-48%) (Table 2). 97% of 
individuals receiving incomplete dosage were age 15 or older at first dose and the second 
dose occurred a median 49 days following the initial dose (IQR: 30 – 70 days). 
The bivalent vaccine was also associated with substantial decreases in the prevalence of HPV 
31/33/45 (Figure 1B). Prevalence reduced from 14.2% (95%CI: 12-16.7%) in the 1988 cohort 
to 2.6% (95% CI: 1.9-3.6%) in the 1995 cohort (Table 1). Again VE was lower in those 
vaccinated at older ages – VE=29.5% (95% CI: -6.2-55.3%) in those vaccinated at age 18, 
increasing to VE=85.1% (95% CI:  77.3-90.9%) in those vaccinated at age 12-13 (Table 2). 
Three dose vaccine effectiveness for the cross-protective types was therefore slightly lower, 
but comparable to, that for the vaccine types in girls vaccinated at age 12/13. Significant 
 10 
vaccine effectiveness was observed for HPV 31, 33 and 45 individually in those vaccinated at 
age 12/13, with highest levels observed for HPV 31 and lowest for HPV 33 (HPV 31: 
VE=93.8% (95% CI: 83.8-98.5%); HPV 33: VE=79.1% (95% CI: 64.2-89.0%); HPV 45: 
VE=82.6% (95% CI: 61.5-93.9%)). For full details see Supplementary Table 1. 
Figure 1C illustrates that although there were yearly fluctuations in the prevalence of HR-HPV 
types other than 16/18/31/33/45 of between 28% and 35%, there is no significant trend 
(Supplementary Table 3, linear test trend p=0.085) and there is little difference in prevalence 
between the unvaccinated and vaccinated groupings. Vaccination showed no effect on the 
odds of infection with these types (fully vaccinated adjusted OR=0.96 (95% CI: 0.83-1.1).  VE 
calculations for other HR-HPV by age vaccination (Table 2) show fluctuations between 
negative and positive VE with all bar the age 16, 3 dose group, having confidence intervals 
which span 0 suggesting no vaccine effect on other HR-HPV levels. 
Supplementary Figure 1 provides an overview of the changing epidemiology of the 24 HPV 
genotypes detected by HPV assay in young women spanning Scottish birth cohorts 1988-
1995. The non-vaccine HR-HPV types show little evidence of trends that would indicate type 
replacement. For overall HPV positivity (i.e. positive for any of the 24 types) there is evidence 
of a declining trend with cohort year (linear p<0.0001, Supplementary Table 3) with levels 
decreasing from 56.9% (95%CI: 53.5-60.2%) in the 1988 cohort to 47.6% (95%CI: 44.9-
50.3%) in the 1995 cohort, driven by the decline in HPV 16/18 and the cross-protective types 
31/33/45 (Figure 1D). There is evidence that those vaccinated with 3 doses are significantly 
less likely to be infected with any HPV than those who are unvaccinated (adjusted OR=0.79, 
95% CI: 0.69-0.9, Table 2).  Across all HPV groupings, there is evidence (Table 2) that even 
when accounting for vaccination there remains an impact of deprivation on HPV positivity with 
those least deprived being less likely to be HPV positive.   
Stratifying by birth cohort and vaccination status (Figure 1A) also provides an indication of 
herd protection with a substantial reduction in HPV16/18 prevalence in the unvaccinated in 
the 1993, 1994 and 1995 birth cohorts. Examining the change in prevalence in the 
unvaccinated individuals (Table 3) indicates that those born in 1995 have a substantially 
reduced odds of HPV16/18 infection compared to those in 1988 (adjusted OR=0.13; 95% CI: 
0.06-0.28). In the unvaccinated, there is evidence of a reduction in HPV31/33/45 (Figure 1B) 
with a significant reduction in the odds of infection observed in the 1995 cohort compared to 
the 1988 cohort (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.23-0.89), for the first time demonstrating herd protection 
against cross-protective HPV types. Sensitivity analysis focusing on the unvaccinated who 
were eligible for vaccination (those born after 1st September 1990) shows similar results 
(Supplementary Table 4).

Discussion 
Population-based data from the Scottish HPV immunisation programme clearly demonstrates 
that the bivalent vaccine is associated with a significant reduction in the prevalence of HPV 
16/18 and each of the cross protective types 31, 33 and 45 in those attending for routine 
cervical screening. The magnitude of this effect increases with successive birth cohorts. 
Moreover, we can demonstrate that cross-protection remains high at age 20 for girls 
vaccinated at age 12-13, differing from an earlier meta-analysis of clinical trial data8 which 
postulated that there may be waning of cross-protection over time.  
The implications of these findings are significant. According to global meta-analyses HPV 
16,18,31,33 and 45 are implicated in 84% of invasive cervical cancers25 and in Scotland these 
5 HPV types account for 90% of cancers11.  For all 5 types, vaccine effectiveness in those 
vaccinated at age 12-13 exceeded 79%. This differs from recent meta-analysis7 which found 
evidence for HPV 31 cross-protection but little evidence for reductions of HPV 33 or 45. This 
meta-analysis was potentially influenced by inclusion of results for both the bivalent and 
quadrivalent vaccines as the latter has previously been shown to have lower levels of cross-
protection8, by stratification by vaccine availability period (pre and post) rather than known 
vaccination status, and by the inclusion of studies with low population vaccine uptake. Our 
results suggest that the high levels cross-protection associated with the bivalent vaccine may 
have been underestimated in the baseline assumptions of cost-effectiveness models. 
Recalibration of such models may impact future vaccine choice with a recent review26 
highlighting that “the 9-valent was not cost-effective (vs 2-valent), under assumptions of 
maximum cross-protection for the 2-valent vaccine”.  
We have demonstrated that partial vaccination conveys protection against HPV16/18 albeit at 
a lower level (2 dose VE=39%, 1 dose VE=27.6%). However, it is important to emphasise that 
the majority of those receiving partial vaccination were vaccinated as part of the catch-up 
cohorts at age 16 and over. Comparable 3 dose VE was 75.9% in those vaccinated at age 16, 
58.1% at age 17 and 28.9% at age 18. It should also be noted that the 2 dose schedule was 
generally delivered as planned within a 3 dose regime i.e. at 0 and 1 month rather than at the 
current 2 dose recommended scheduling of 0 and 6 months, where higher VE would be 
expected. Partial vaccination in older women shown to be HPV-negative, as suggested by the 
HPV Faster protocol27 for accelerated reduction of cervical cancer incidence, may also have 
a higher VE.  Given the age range of women considered for HPV Faster, they are likely to be 
largely unaffected by genital warts and there may be merit in offering bivalent vaccine to these 
women.  
 12 
Encouragingly, there was no significant increase in non-16/18/31/33/45 HR-HPV types even 
though 16/18 prevalence has reduced by 6-fold (28.9% to 4.8%). There is therefore no 
evidence of “type replacement”, at least in the shorter term. However, for this to be addressed 
robustly further longitudinal studies which relate infecting HPV type to the future risk of disease 
in immunised populations are required and ongoing in the Scottish population.   
Retesting the 59 samples in the 1995 cohort that were positive for 16/18 according to the 
epidemiologically orientated assay with a clinically validated assay (with a cut off set for the 
detection of CIN2+)24, showed that only 7 (4 vaccinated) were HPV 16 positive and none were 
HPV 18 positive. This suggest that the majority of HPV 16 infection in routinely immunised 
women may be at thresholds that are clinically irrelevant. Analytically sensitive assays are 
also more likely to detect HPV associated with recent acquisition rather than actual intra-
cellular infection which has the capacity to persist. Follow up studies to determine the clinical 
significance of residual infection in vaccinated women are underway to examine this more 
specifically. 
We previously showed preliminary evidence, based on small numbers, of herd protection in 
the unvaccinated population for the vaccine types4. Scotland has benefitted from high uptake 
rates of vaccine of around 90% in the routine cohort since initiation of the programme. The 
growing evidence of herd protection extending to the cross-protective types serves as a 
positive, reinforcing message for future and existing programmes in their drive to achieve and 
maintain high uptake levels.  
Reduced HPV 16/18/31/33/45 infection will naturally have implications for screening, as 
current modalities have been calibrated to pre-vaccination era levels of disease. The positive 
predictive value (PPV) of a screening test will reduce as the prevalence of target disease 
reduces28. Data derived from the population vaccinated as part of catch-up in Scotland has 
already shown a significant reduction in the PPV of cytology for CIN2+ in immunised women21. 
While it is argued that HPV primary screening using objective molecular assays may mitigate 
the issues of cytology screening, it is subject to the same influences as cytology and is not a 
panacea. The randomised controlled trials which provided evidence for its introduction have 
been based solely on unvaccinated women29. 
Compared to other high-risk types, HPV 16/18 have been shown to confer a significantly 
higher risk of disease30, particularly HPV 16 and particularly when CIN3 or worse is used as 
an outcome. Consequently, residual HR-HPV infection in immunised women will be clinically 
less significant. In line with this, preliminary data on the clinical performance of HPV testing 
for primary screening in Scotland indicated that the positive predictive value for CIN2+ was 
significantly lower in vaccinated women compared to unvaccinated women31. Therefore, 
 13 
robust “triage” for primary HPV testing becomes increasingly relevant for immunised 
populations. The choice of optimal triage is a fertile area of research and extended genotyping, 
methylation and cytology with adjunctive biomarker staining represent some of the many 
options under consideration32. Furthermore, an ecological study which assessed national 
colposcopy data in Scotland before and after the introduction of vaccination, showed that the 
PPV of colposcopy for CIN2+ decreased from 79% in 2008/9 to 67% in 2013/14 - close to the 
UK key performance indicator threshold of  65%33 . 
There are limitations to this study. The sample collection and testing strategy necessarily 
involved only those women who attended screening who represent only 50% of their age 
group34. In our study vaccine uptake figures are the same as in the general population. There 
is therefore no substantial bias in who comes to screening with respect to vaccine receipt. 
This coupled with the equity of vaccine uptake18 in the routinely vaccinated cohorts in 
Scotland, and the similarity in HPV positivity levels in 2009/10 between screening attenders 
and non-attenders20, should mitigate any differential vaccine effect in non-attenders who were 
vaccinated at younger ages. In those vaccinated as part of the catch-up cohorts who had lower 
overall uptake, our previous work18 has shown lowest uptake of vaccination in the most 
deprived,  a group disproportionately affected by cervical malignancy. Our results show that 
there remains a deprivation effect in HPV positivity and, whilst this effect may be driven by 
inequitable vaccine uptake in the catch-up cohorts, perhaps in addition to differences in sexual 
behaviour and smoking status (which we cannot ascertain in our study), they reinforce the 
need for appropriate delivery and uptake of cervical screening. 
 
With the change to quadrivalent vaccination in 2012, future work to examine vaccine impact, 
both in terms of herd protection and direct protection, will be confounded by the inevitable 
sexual mixing of the two vaccination cohorts.  In this study however, the 4-year gap between 
the 12/13 year olds vaccinated in 2008/9 and the first quadrivalent cohort in 2012/13, coupled 
with examining HPV prevalence at age 20/21 and the final collection year being 2015, 
reassures that any impact attributable to quadrivalent vaccine in the cohorts examined is likely 
to be minimal.  We are committed to ongoing surveillance to assess the impact of the change 
to quadrivalent vaccine. 
To conclude, HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 have reduced substantially following a population-
based vaccination programme which has achieved high uptake of bivalent vaccine. Levels of 
cross-protective immunity endure for at least 7 years and further follow-up will provide 
important information as to their ultimate longevity. The massive reductions in the most 
carcinogenic types of HPV have clear implications for cervical screening and disease 
management and there may be a time when the current cervical screening programme is no 
 14 
longer cost-effective. Primary screening with HPV testing already allows extended screening 
intervals compare to cytology, and immunisation will permit even longer intervals and possibly 
a rise in the age at which screening starts in developed countries35. The levels of sustained 
cross protection observed with bivalent vaccine may also have implications for future vaccine 
choice, which needs to be matched to the prevalence of HPV types in the target population. 
Indeed, if the cross protection observed translates to fewer HPV related cancer cases in a 
population, then there are likely to be implications for the cost effectiveness of the bivalent 
vaccine relative to alternative HPV vaccines.  It is therefore imperative that data such as those 
described above are incorporated into models which can inform optimal strategies for future 
cervical disease screening and cost-effectiveness calculations for vaccine choice.
