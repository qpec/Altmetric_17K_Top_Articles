Objective:
Childhood abuse makes people vulnerable to developing depression, even in late
life. Psychosocial factors that are common in late life, such as loneliness or lack of a partner,
may explain this association. Our aim was to investigate whether the association between
childhood abuse and depression in older adults can be explained by psychosocial factors.
Methods:
Cross‐sectional data were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older
Persons (aged 60‐93), including 132 without lifetime depression, 242 persons with an early‐onset
depression (<60 years), and 125 with a late‐onset (≥60 years) depression. Childhood abuse (yes/no)
and a frequency‐based childhood abuse index were included. Multinomial regression and
multivariable mediation analyses were used to examine the association between childhood abuse
and the onset of depression, and the influence of loneliness, social network, and partner status.
Results:
Multinomial regression analyses showed a significant association between childhood
abuse and the childhood abuse index with early‐ and late‐onset depression. Multivariable media-
tion analyses showed that the association between childhood abuse and early‐onset depression
was partly mediated by social network size and loneliness. This was particularly present for
emotional neglect and psychological abuse, but not for physical and sexual abuse. No psychosocial
mediators were found for the association between childhood abuse and late‐onset depression.
Conclusions:
A smaller social network and feelings of loneliness mediate the association
between childhood abuse and early‐onset depression in older adults. Our findings show the
importance of detecting childhood abuse as well as the age at depression onset and mapping
of relevant psychosocial factors in the treatment of late‐life depression.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of major depressive disorders (MDDs) among older
adults ranges from 1% to 5% in most large‐scale epidemiological
studies.1 Recently, 2 studies have shown a significant association
between childhood abuse and late‐life depression.2,3 Although it is
generally assumed that childhood abuse is associated with an early
onset of depression,4,5 Comijs et al showed that childhood abuse is
also associated with late‐onset depression.2 Regarding mental health,
some victims of childhood abuse are apparently able to function
relatively well throughout their lives but become depressed at older
age. Comijs et al demonstrated that chronic somatic diseases partly
explained the association between childhood abuse and late‐onset
depression, suggesting that the increase of chronic diseases in older
adults with a history of childhood abuse may make them vulnerable
to depression at older age.2 The question of other factors that might
explain the association
between childhood abuse and
late‐life
depression remains. Characteristics of psychosocial functioning, such
as feeling lonely, living without a partner, or having a small social
network, might be of importance in the late onset of depression in
older adults who reported childhood abuse.
It has been suggested that childhood abuse has a negative influ-
ence on social functioning during life.6,7 Several studies investigated
this relationship in adults, focusing on factors such as partner status,

 social network size, and loneliness. Roberts et al found that women
reporting childhood sexual abuse were more likely to become single
mothers without a regular partner than those who were not abused.8
In addition, Gibson and Hartshorne9 showed an association between
loneliness and childhood abuse and also showed that women with a
history of childhood sexual abuse had smaller social networks (see also
Turner10). Sperry and Widom reported in a prospective study that
childhood abuse is associated with lower levels of social support in
adulthood and that social support has a significant mediating influence
on the association between childhood abuse and depression.11 In addi-
tion, Wilson et al found in a cohort of older adults that childhood abuse
was associated with fewer close relationships and with feeling more
emotionally isolated.12 These negative consequences of childhood
abuse, which seem to persist during life, may make those adults more
vulnerable to depression, and maybe even more later in life, when
physical health deteriorates and support from the environment might
become more necessary.
In addition, changing life circumstances when aging, such as
retirement and loss of a partner, may further influence psychosocial
functioning. Dykstra et al indicated that with age the chance that
someone will outlive their partner and lose age‐matched friends
increases.13 Another study found that changes in the social network
of older adults predict loneliness.14 Furthermore, loneliness increases
among older adults when aging; above 55 years of age, older persons
tend to be lonelier than younger persons.13 Not everyone is capable
of adjusting to these new circumstances, which may in turn lead to
depression later in life, especially in persons with a history of childhood
abuse. It has been shown that partner status, social network size, and
feelings of loneliness are all associated with late‐life depression.15-17
Thus far, there are no studies available examining the influence of
psychosocial factors on the association between childhood abuse and
late‐life depression. Previous literature suggests that individuals with
a history of childhood abuse may have long‐standing problems with
psychosocial functioning, which may lead to a first onset of depression
in later life but may also trigger a new depressive episode in persons
who have been depressed before. Therefore, we hypothesized that
psychosocial factors, specifically partner status, social network size,
and feelings of loneliness, mediate the association between childhood
abuse and both early‐ and late‐onset depression, although the strength
of the mediation effect may differ between early‐ and late‐onset
depression.

METHODS
2.1
|
Study sample
Baseline
cross‐sectional
measurements
were
derived
from
the
Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO).18 The
NESDO is a longitudinal study investigating depressive disorders in
older adults. At the start, 510 older adults (60‐93 years) were included,
378 depressed and 132 nondepressed older adults from 5 different
regions in the Netherlands, recruited from general practitioners and
mental health care institutes. People who had a clinical diagnosis of
dementia or were suspected of suffering from dementia according to
their clinician and people with a primary diagnosis of psychotic or
bipolar disorder, a score under 18 on the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE),19 or insufficient mastery of the Dutch language
were excluded. The comparison group of nondepressed older adults
consisted of persons who had no lifetime diagnosis of depression.
From this cohort, 3 participants had missing values on childhood abuse
and 8 participants were excluded, while information on age at onset of
depression was missing, resulting in 499 participants for the present
study. Persons excluded because of missing values (n = 11) did not
differ from the study sample with respect to age, years of education,
and depression diagnoses. Baseline measurements were collected by
structured clinical interviews that were recorded on audiotape and
conducted by trained research assistants.

Depression characteristics
The Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI; WHO
Version 2.1; lifetime version) was used to determine a diagnosis of
depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria20 and to assess the
age at onset of the first depressive episode. The CIDI has high validity
for depressive and anxiety disorders and is particularly used in research
settings.21 We included participants with a 6‐month diagnosis of MDD
and/or dysthymia. On the basis of a previous study using NESDO
data,2 late‐onset depression was defined as a first onset of depression
at 60 years and older.

Childhood abuse
The Childhood Abuse Inventory was used to retrospectively assess
childhood abuse. This is a structured interview to determine the
occurrence and frequency of several types of childhood abuse prior
to the age of 16 and was previously used in large‐scale studies, such
as the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study22 and
the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety.23 Four types of
childhood abuse are recorded, namely, emotional neglect, psycholog-
ical abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. The frequency of child-
hood abuse was scored by never (0), once and sometimes (1), and
Key points
• Childhood abuse is associated with an early onset of
depression as well as a late onset of depression in
older adults.
• A smaller social network and feelings of loneliness
mediate the association between childhood abuse and
early‐onset depression.
• Partner status did not mediate the association between
childhood abuse and early‐onset depression.
• No
psychosocial
mediators
were
found
for
the
association between childhood abuse and late‐onset
depression.

 regularly, often, and very often (2). The present study differentiated
between “childhood abuse” (scores 1 and 2) and “no childhood
abuse” (score 0 for all subtypes). In addition, the childhood abuse
index (CAI) was created by summing up the frequencies (0‐2) of
every type of childhood abuse, leading to a 0 to 8 range of the total
score.24
2.2.3

Psychosocial factors
We considered 3 psychosocial factors, namely, partner status, social
network size, and loneliness. Partner status was obtained with standard
questions, asking whether they had an intimate relationship with
someone they considered as their partner. The Close Person Inventory
determined social network size,25 which is recently validated in the
Netherlands by Hanssen et al.26 It asks participants how many
important contacts they have on a regular basis. We differentiated
between small (0‐5 people) and large social networks (6 people or more).
Loneliness was assessed with the Loneliness Scale, a validated
questionnaire consisting of 11 items.27 The sum score ranges from 0
(“no loneliness”) to 11 (“very severe loneliness”).

Covariates
Several variables were included to control for possible confounding:
sociodemographics, severity of depressive symptoms, current anxiety
disorder, negative life events, chronic diseases, and global cognitive
functioning. Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, and years
of education. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was used
to measure the severity of depression, with scores in the 0 to 84
range.28 Current anxiety disorder (last 6 months' diagnosis) was
assessed by the CIDI, including general anxiety disorder, panic
disorder, agoraphobia, and social phobia. Negative life events in the
last 5 years were measured by the Brugha questionnaire.29 The
number of chronic diseases was assessed with self‐report questions
about the presence of several chronic somatic diseases, such as cardiac
disease, peripheral atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.30
Global cognitive functioning was assessed with the MMSE.19 Scores
ranged from 0 to 30, with higher scores reflecting better cognitive
functioning.

Statistical analyses
Baseline differences between the early‐ and late‐onset depression
groups and the comparison group “no depression” were analyzed using
analysis of variance tests, chi‐squared tests, and Kruskal‐Wallis tests
when appropriate. Variables that differed significantly (P ≤ .10) were
used
as
covariates
in
subsequent
analyses.
Next,
to
avoid
multicollinearity, the correlations between psychosocial factors were
examined by bivariate correlation analysis, and the variance inflation
factors between the psychosocial factors were taken into account
using a linear regression analysis in which every psychosocial factor
was separately inserted as the dependent variable. Multinomial
regression analyses were performed to examine the association
between childhood abuse and the CAI with the onset of depression.
We used the nondepressed group as the reference group. As the
cutoff of early onset and late onset is arbitrary, we repeated the
multinomial regression analyses excluding participants with an age at
depression onset between 50 and 60 years. To study whether the
association between childhood abuse and the onset of depression is
mediated by psychosocial factors, multivariable mediation analyses
were performed. We performed 2 separate mediation analyses with
no depression as the reference category for either early‐ or late‐onset
depression (Figure 1). Following Preacher and Hayes,31 we used a
multiple‐mediation model quantifying the indirect effect of the
independent variable (childhood abuse) on the dependent variable
(depression onset) through one or more mediator(s) by testing the
effect of childhood abuse on the mediator (a) and by testing the effect
of the mediator on depression onset (b). The product “a × b” quantifies
the indirect mediating effect and was obtained using a bootstrapping
procedure with 5000 bootstrap samples. When the bias‐corrected
95% confidence interval did not contain 0, we considered the
mediating effect to be significant. The direct effect of childhood abuse
on depression onset with consideration of the mediation effect was
quantified as c′. First, we investigated the mediating effect of all
mediating variables adjusted for relevant confounders separately.
Second, we created a model with all significant mediators in one
complete model. In addition, we calculated the change in effect using
the following formula: ΔB = [(c − c′)/c] × 100. For explorative reasons,
we repeated the mediation analyses with 2 groups, based on a

 meta‐analysis in adults32 that showed that there might be a different
association between emotional neglect and psychological abuse and
depression compared to the association between physical and sexual
abuse and depression.
All P values were tested 2‐tailed, and P values ≤.05 were
considered as statistically significant. Statistical Package of the Social
Sciences Version 20.0 (SPSS 2011) was used to conduct all statistical
analyses.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of older adults with no
lifetime depression (n = 132), early‐onset depression (n = 242), and
late‐onset depression (n = 125). Of those with early‐onset depression,
235 participants were diagnosed with MDD and 74 with dysthymia. In
the late‐onset depression group, 115 participants had MDD and 26
dysthymia. Age, years of education, and depression severity differed
significantly between groups. Those with early‐ and late‐onset
depression more often experienced childhood abuse, more often had
“no partner,” had smaller social networks, and felt lonelier compared
to the nondepressed group. Also, the number of chronic diseases and
the number of negative life events were significantly higher for the
depressed groups compared to the nondepressed group.
Using a bivariate correlation analysis, we found no significant
correlation between partner status and social network size (r = −0.05,
N = 491, P = .23), but we did find a significant correlation between
partner status and loneliness (r = −0.32, N = 464, P < .001) and
between social network size and loneliness (r = −0.36, N = 464,
P < .001). We examined the multicollinearity of these variables and
found no variance inflation factor above 1.2, indicating that there is
no multicollinearity.
Multinomial regression analyses were executed to study the
association between childhood abuse psychosocial factors and the
onset of depression as outcome variable, with the nondepressed group
as the reference group. First, we performed a bivariate multinomial
regression analyses with childhood abuse (yes/no) and found a signifi-
cant positive association for early‐onset depression (odds ratio [OR],
8.04; 95% CI, 4.72‐13.70; P < .001) as well as for late‐onset depression
(OR, 3.52; 95%CI, 1.96‐6.34; P < .001). Next, we adjusted this model
for age, years of education, depression severity, comorbid anxiety
disorder, number of chronic diseases, number of negative life events
in the past 5 years, and score on the MMSE. Again, a significant
positive association was found for early‐onset depression (OR, 4.36;

analyses, thereby excluding participants with an age at depression
onset between 50 and 60 years, leading to a total of 434 participants
(132 controls; 183 with an early‐onset depression, ≤50 years; and
119 with a late‐onset depression, >60 years). These results were
comparable with the results from the complete sample.
Multivariable mediation analyses, adjusted for the same covari-
ates, were executed to investigate whether these psychosocial factors
mediate these associations. We used a dichotomous outcome
measure, either “no depression and early‐onset depression” or “no
depression and late‐onset depression” (Figure 1). Results are shown
in Tables 2 and 3. The direct association between childhood abuse
(yes/no) and early‐onset depression was statistically significant.
Adding every mediator separately to the mediation model showed that
social
network
size
and
loneliness
significantly
mediated
the
association between childhood abuse and early‐onset depression
(Table 2), but partner status did not. Including all significant mediators
in the same model showed that only loneliness stayed a significant
mediator. The direct effect corrected for a × b (c′) was still significant
in a complete model; adding these mediators to our model led to a
significant reduction of the direct effect (c) (ΔB = 24.83%). The same
analyses were conducted with the CAI; however, no significant
mediation effects were found for the psychosocial factors. Next, we
examined the association between childhood abuse and late‐onset
depression. The direct association between childhood abuse (yes/no)
and late‐onset depression was not significant. Consequently, no
significant mediation effects were found for this association, although
adding these psychosocial factors did explain some of the variance
(Table 3). For the CAI, we did find a significant direct association with
late‐onset depression compared to no depression when partner status
and/or social network size were added to the model; however, none of
the psychosocial factors significantly mediated the association.
Post hoc, we performed the same multivariable mediation analyses
for childhood physical and sexual abuse together, as well as for emo-
tional neglect and psychological abuse (Tables 4 and 5). The direct asso-
ciation between childhood physical and sexual abuse and early‐onset
depression was significant; however, none of the psychosocial factors
significantly mediated this association (Table 4). The direct association
between childhood emotional neglect and psychological abuse and
early‐onset depression was significant. Social network size and
loneliness individually significantly mediated this association; only
loneliness stayed a significant mediator in a complete model. The direct
effect corrected for a × b (c′) of these types of childhood abuse on
early‐onset depression was still significant in a complete model; adding
these mediators to our model led to a significant reduction of the direct
effect (c) (ΔB = 20.48%). Considering the association between types of
childhood abuse and late‐onset depression, no significant associations
or mediation effects were found (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether the associ-
ation between childhood abuse and late‐life depression is mediated by
psychosocial factors. We hypothesized that psychosocial factors
would mediate the association between childhood abuse and both
early‐onset and late‐onset depression. However, our results showed
that a smaller social network and loneliness significantly mediated
the association between childhood abuse and early‐onset depression,
but not between childhood abuse and late‐onset depression. Loneli-
ness appeared the strongest mediator, leading to a reduction of almost
25% of the direct effect between childhood abuse and early‐onset
depression. The mediation effects were strongest for emotional
neglect and psychological abuse.

WIELAARD ET AL.
 Our findings suggest that smaller social networks and feelings of
loneliness are important factors in late‐life depression in older adults
with a history of childhood abuse and with an early‐onset depression.
Studies have already shown that the size of social networks decreases
and that feelings of loneliness become stronger when getting older,13
which suggests that changes in psychosocial factors might trigger a
depressive episode in late life. It might also be that a history of depres-
sion already influences the size of a social network as well as loneliness
in adulthood, which increases the vulnerability for (another) depres-
sion. Our findings are in line with those of Shevlin et al,33 who showed,
in a sample of women with a mean age of 51 years, that loneliness
mediated the association between childhood abuse and adult psycho-
pathology including depression. However, to our knowledge, our study
is the first that considered social network size or loneliness in late‐life
depression, differentiating between an early onset and a late onset.
In contrast to our hypothesis, we did not find a mediation effect of
psychosocial factors for late‐onset depression. Previous research
showed that an increased number of chronic diseases partially
explained the association between childhood abuse and late‐onset
depression.2 Still, regarding mental health, the question of why some
adults are able to function relatively well throughout their lives but
become depressed in older age remained. Even though many changes
occur in psychosocial aspects of the lives of older adults, in our sample,
they do not explain the late onset of depression. So there must be
other factors not considered in this study, such as cognitive decline,
that might explain the association between childhood abuse and
late‐onset depression. Future research might further explore these
mediating mechanisms.
On the basis of our findings, it seems that the presence of
childhood abuse is more important than the frequency of the abuse,
since we only found a mediation effect for childhood abuse (yes/no)
and not for the CAI. More importantly, the mediation effects were
predominantly present in specific forms of childhood abuse, namely,
emotional neglect and psychological abuse. It might be that these
forms of childhood abuse are more connected to depression compared
to physical and sexual abuse. A meta‐analysis has shown that even
though childhood abuse increases the risk of developing depressive
symptoms, childhood neglect was found to be the strongest risk factor
for developing a depression.32
This study has several strengths and limitations due to the design
of this study. First of all, we used cross‐sectional data, which prohibits
us from making causal inferences and studying changes over time
considering depression and psychosocial factors. Second, although
we found a significant association between childhood abuse and
late‐onset depression in the multinomial regression analysis, the direct
association in the mediation model was not significant. This might be
due to the reduced power by using a smaller sample size in the
mediation model and the stricter rules that are implicit in our mediation
model.31 Third, this study investigates early‐ and late‐onset depression
but does not differentiate between a first episode and recurrent or
chronic depression in the early‐onset group. Fourth, information about
childhood abuse was asked retrospectively. Distorted memories,
unwillingness to tell about embarrassing or painful memories, a
negative mood, etc could cause a recall bias, possibly leading to
underreporting or overreporting.34 Two previous studies concluded
that the reliability of childhood abuse recollections is not associated
with psychopathology.35,36 Still, we need to be cautious in our
interpretation. Underreporting or overreporting might also concern
the age at onset of depression, which was also asked retrospectively.
However, a study by Toren et al37 showed that self‐reported data
considering age of onset are reliable and accurate. The major strength
of our study is the large overall sample size and the detailed
information about formal Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (Fourth Edition) diagnoses,20 childhood abuse, and a wide
array of covariates. This allowed us to incorporate covariates in the
analyses that controlled for confounding effects, particularly those of
importance later in life such as the number of chronic diseases.
As far as we know, this is the first study indicating that a smaller
social network and stronger feelings of loneliness might be risk factors
for late‐life depression in older adults with a history of childhood abuse

 and with an onset of depression before the age of 60 years. Our
findings highlight the importance of detecting the presence of
childhood abuse in late‐life depression and possibly to integrate this
in treatment. Research indicates that older adults are able to make
new long‐lasting contacts38,39 and that there are effective strategies
to decrease feelings of loneliness.40 A review on effective strategies
to reduce loneliness41 described that a structured group intervention
seems to be helpful but also that small experimental interventions
using new technologies, such as videoconferencing, were effective.
In addition, an earlier review42 found that interventions that focused
on maladaptive social cognitions might be helpful. Therefore, it might
be worthwhile to focus on social network size and feelings of
loneliness, particularly in older adults with a history of childhood
abuse, and to develop tailored strategies in treatment and prevention
programs earlier in life on these topics.
