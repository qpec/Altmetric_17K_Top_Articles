Abstract The direct monitoring of mosquito populations in field settings is a crucial input for
shaping appropriate and timely control measures for mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we
demonstrate that commercially available mobile phones are a powerful tool for acoustically
mapping mosquito species distributions worldwide. We show that even low-cost mobile phones
with very basic functionality are capable of sensitively acquiring acoustic data on species-specific
mosquito wingbeat sounds, while simultaneously recording the time and location of the human-
mosquito encounter. We survey a wide range of medically important mosquito species, to
quantitatively demonstrate how acoustic recordings supported by spatio-temporal metadata
enable rapid, non-invasive species identification. As proof-of-concept, we carry out field
demonstrations where minimally-trained users map local mosquitoes using their personal phones.
Thus, we establish a new paradigm for mosquito surveillance that takes advantage of the existing
global mobile network infrastructure, to enable continuous and large-scale data acquisition in
resource-constrained areas.

Introduction
Frequent, widespread, and high resolution surveillance of mosquitoes is essential to understanding
their complex ecology and behaviour. An in-depth knowledge of human—mosquito interactions is a
critical component in mitigating mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika (Macdon-
ald, 1956; World Health Organization, 2014; Godfray, 2013; Besansky, 2015; Kindhauser et al.,
2016). However, there is a paucity of high-resolution ecological data on the abundance, temporal
variation, and spatial distribution of mosquito vector species. This poses a serious impediment to
the effective control of mosquito-borne diseases (Townson et al., 2005; Ferguson et al., 2010;
Hay et al., 2013). Efforts to map mosquito populations primarily rely on interpolative mathematical
models based on factors such as clinical disease burdens or climatological data, with field inputs
from entomological surveys being a comparatively sparse contribution (Hay et al., 2010;
Mordecai et al., 2017). This scarcity of field data stems from the absence of high-throughput, low-
cost surveillance techniques to map the distribution of mosquitoes. This effect is particularly severe
in resource-constrained areas, as currently used methods like trapping and manual identification
require considerable expense, labour, and time. However, for disease control strategies to be truly
effective, it is critical for them to be strongly informed by current mosquito population distributions.
Hence, there is a pressing need for novel methods of surveillance that can rapidly and inexpensively
sample mosquito populations across large areas at high spatio-temporal resolutions.
Acoustic surveillance was proposed decades ago as a high-throughput automated surveillance
approach, where mosquitoes in flight are identified using the species-specific frequencies in their
wingbeat sounds (Kahn et al., 1945; Kahn and Offenhauser, 1949a; Offenhauser and Kahn, 1949;
Kahn and Offenhauser, 1949b; Jones, 1964; Johnson and Ritchie, 2016). This technique is based

 on the hypothesis that sexual selection has led to characteristic sound signatures for different mos-
quito species (Roth, 1948; Belton, 1994; Gibson and Russell, 2006; Cator et al., 2009;
Warren et al., 2009; Pennetier et al., 2010; Cator et al., 2010). However, the challenge of using
expensive microphones to acquire low amplitude mosquito sounds against potentially high back-
ground noise poses a significant barrier to its widespread adoption as a field technique
(Jones, 1964; Unwin and Ellington, 1979; Raman et al., 2007). Optical wingbeat measurement has
been proposed as a proxy for sound recording, to overcome the technological limitations in audio
signal acquisition (Moore et al., 1986; Batista et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2015).
However, this approach is yet to take flight on a large scale, as the cost and global scalability of the
requisite hardware remain challenges for its worldwide deployment.
Here, we propose a novel solution that uses mobile phones to enable widespread acoustic mos-
quito surveillance. We use the sensitive microphones in mobile handsets to record species-specific
wingbeat sounds from a variety of mosquito vector species for automated identification and analysis
(Figure 1A). Our technique exploits the rapid advances in mobile phone hardware technology, rec-
ognizing that these highly portable devices are optimized for sophisticated audio capture, process-
ing, and transmission. Further, the proliferation of the global mobile network implies that around 5.3
billion users worldwide are connected today by a distributed data transmission infrastructure, grow-
ing quickly at over 6% annually (Cerwall et al., 2017). Mobile connectivity has revolutionized the
delivery of services based on mapping and analyzing crowdsourced data from mobile phones, which
has enabled many innovative applications in citizen science (Graham et al., 2011; Catlin-
Groves, 2012; Malykhina, 2013; Kong et al., 2016). Also, the explosive growth in mobile phone
use is most pronounced in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (Cerwall et al., 2017), which also bear the
brunt of mosquito-borne diseases (World Health Organization, 2014). This overlap implies that a
mobile phone based concept can be particularly scalable, sustainable, and cost effective for
eLife digest Diseases spread by mosquito bites – like malaria, dengue and Zika – kill over half a
million people each year. Many of these diseases have no cure, and those that do often face the
problem of drug resistance. As such, the most effective way to control these diseases is to reduce
the number of mosquitoes in the affected area. Yet, this kind of control strategy relies on knowing
which species of mosquito that spread diseases to humans and where they are found.
Most current methods to monitor mosquitoes are laborious, and need expensive equipment and
highly trained people. This makes them less suitable for resource-poor areas, which typically have
the highest levels of mosquito-borne diseases. However, scientists have known for many decades
that one can identify species of mosquito by the pitch of sound they make when they fly. The
challenge was to find instruments that could record these sounds clearly enough to measure the
pitch, but that were still cheap and sturdy enough to use in mosquito-infested environments.
Mukundarajan et al. now report that the microphones in ordinary mobile phones are sensitive
enough to accurately record the whining buzz of a mosquito, even in the presence of background
noise. First, techniques were developed that allow anybody to record mosquitoes on virtually any
mobile phone model – including smartphones and basic flip-phones. Next, the sounds of 20 species
of mosquito that spread diseases to humans were recorded – more than in any previous study.
When other recordings made using various phones were compared to this collection of sounds, the
correct species was automatically identified for two thirds of the recordings. This meant that,
together with volunteers who were trained for 15 minutes, Mukundarajan et al. could use mobile
phone recordings to map mosquito species inside a National Park in California and a village in
Madagascar more efficiently than with any conventional method.
There are over five billion mobile phones in use today. Even a small percentage of mobile users
recording mosquito sounds could thus provide a tremendous amount of data. As more and more
people contribute recordings, Mukundarajan et al. hope to be able to make real-time global maps
of mosquito distributions. These could then be used to design better strategies to control
mosquitoes and combat mosquito-borne diseases.

burdens. Our proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of our solution to engage citizen scien-
tists around the world in mosquito surveillance, without the need for specialized equipment or
extensive formal training.
Results
Mobile phone microphones can be used to record wingbeat sounds
from mosquitoes
We record the acoustic signatures of free-flying mosquitoes using mobile phones, by orienting the
primary microphone towards the mosquito and using an audio recording application to acquire and
store its wingbeat sound (Figure 1A,B, Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2, Supplementary file
1, Videos 1–3). Mosquito sounds have relatively low complexity. They comprise a single fundamen-
tal frequency with several overtones, which we identify using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
(Figure 1C, Video 4). The sound from typical flight traces is not monotone, but shows natural fre-
quency variations which we capture as a wingbeat frequency distribution, in a range characteristic of
the given species (Figure 1D). Since mosquitoes rarely fly at speeds over half a meter per second,
the Doppler shift of frequency during free-flight (1 � ½330 � 0:5=330 þ 0:5� » 0:3%, i.e. <2 Hz) is
small when compared to the observed natural spreads of up to 100 Hz within a single flight trace.
Sexual dimorphism in most species implies that males have higher frequencies than females. Female
wingbeat
frequencies
are
typically
between
200 and 700 Hz. This overlaps the voice fre-
quency band (300 to 3000 Hz), in which phones
are designed to have maximum sensitivity. In
addition, using mobile phones as recording plat-
forms automatically registers relevant metadata
parameters, such as the location and time of
data acquisition. This adds valuable secondary
information to acoustic data that is useful for
species identification and spatio-temporal map-
ping. Such acoustic and spatio-temporal infor-
mation could potentially be aggregated from
many mobile phone users, to generate large
data sets that map the distribution of mosquito
species at high resolutions (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1).
Mobile phone microphones
accurately capture wingbeat
frequencies without distortion
Our concept of mobile phone based acoustic
surveillance is based on the idea that mobile
phones are high fidelity acoustic sensors, which
faithfully capture the frequencies produced by
mosquito wingbeats during flight. To confirm
this, we compared measurements of wingbeat
frequency from two independent modalities,
high speed video and mobile phone audio (Sony
Xperia Z3 Compact), for female Culex tarsalis
mosquitoes
in
tethered
flight
(Figure
2A,
Video 4, Video 5). For synchronized audio-video
recordings, spectrograms were aligned in time
to within 2 ms, and show an exact match in fre-
quency at each time window to within a compu-
tational error margin of 2 Hz (Figure 2B). The

 respective distributions of wingbeat frequency have maximum sample fractions occurring in the
same frequency bin (Figure 2C), giving the same median frequency of 264 Hz, despite the audio sig-
nal being noisier than the video. To show similarity between distributions, we compute the Bhatta-
charya Coefficient (BC) - a measure of the mutual overlap of two distributions, ranging between 1
for completely coincident and 0 for completely separated distributions. We obtain a high BC of 0.95,
implying an almost complete overlap between the distributions. This corroborates the spectral accu-
racy of wingbeat frequency distributions recorded by mobile phones, based on an independent opti-
cal reference.
Mobile phone microphones are comparable to studio microphones in
recording mosquito wingbeats at up to 100 mm
We propose using mobile phones for acoustic surveillance under field conditions, where the primary
challenge is recording faint mosquito sounds in noise-prone environments. Accordingly, it is impor-
tant to establish the limits within which their built-in microphones are sensitive enough to reliably
acquire data with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The technical specifications of many commercial
mobile phone microphones are not openly available. Hence, we experimentally calibrated a range of
mobile phone models against two reference electret condenser microphones under identical condi-
tions. Using a piezoelectric buzzer of constant amplitude (77 dB at source) and frequency (500 Hz) as
a standardized sound source, we first showed that both smartphones (iPhone 4S, Xperia Z3 Com-
pact) and low-end feature phones (Samsung SGH T-209 clamshell model) have SNRs comparable to
the reference microphones over distances up to 100 mm (Figure 2D). Next, we recorded wingbeat
sound from tethered mosquitoes to gauge suitable working distances over which SNR is high
enough to allow detection. Curves of mobile phone SNR over distance indicate that all the phones
tested, including a decade-old basic phone (SGH T-209), are capable of acquiring detectable wing-
beat sound up to 50 mm from a mosquito (Figure 2E). This is a working distance we have found to
be easily achievable when making free-flight recordings in the field. This distance improves to 100
mm in the case of smartphones like the Xperia, making it even easier for users to record mosquito
sound (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Beyond these distances, the mosquito sound becomes
imperceptible, drowned out by background noise. We also caution that these working limits are
appropriate in quiet to moderately noisy environments with background noise levels below 50 dB,
and shrink drastically in louder conditions. In addition to distance, the orientation of the mobile
phone is also critical to maximizing SNR, as its acoustic sensitivity is directional and localized around
the primary microphone. Thus, the success of using mobile phones to record mosquitoes is funda-
mentally dependent on active involvement from the user, to maintain the appropriate distance and
orientation of the phone with respect to the mosquito, and avoid introducing noise via bumps and
scrapes of the microphone.
Diverse mobile phone models acquire quantitatively equivalent acoustic
data from mosquitoes
There are over 100 mobile phone brands in use worldwide, with a range of devices widely varying in
features and capability. Widespread mobile phone-based surveillance is only possible if mosquito
wingbeat sound collected using any phone can be analyzed using the same identification metrics
and algorithms. This means that a diverse range of phone models must record quantitatively equiva-
lent acoustic data with identical spectral profiles. This is a necessity for our proposed surveillance
technique to scale to the broadest possible user base, particularly in countries with lower smart-
phone penetration. We compared eight different smart and feature phones ranging in price
between ~$20 and ~$700 (Figure 2F), by analyzing 5 minutes of audio recorded with each phone
from free-flying female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes of similar age from a lab-reared population
contained in a cage. We noted high degrees of overlap in wingbeat frequency distributions recorded
by each phone for this population, with both mean and median frequencies obtained by each phone
differing by less than 5% from other phones (Figure 2F).
We computed the Bhattacharya Coefficient (BC) and obtained high degrees of overlap between
0.93 and 1 (Figure 2H). We also quantified how distinguishable these wingbeat frequency distribu-
tions are, using the Jensen-Shannon divergence metric (JSD) between each pair of phones
(Figure 2G). This metric, which ranges from 0 for identical to 1 for completely disparate

 distributions, can be inversely related to the
amount of mutual information shared between
the distributions. The JSD for each pair of phones
had low values below 0.3 indicating high similar-
ity in measurement, corroborating that wingbeat
frequency sampling is relatively insensitive to the
phone used. This is also true of other species we
surveyed, with the JSD between phones typically
between 0.1 and 0.35 for a given population.
This range of JSD provides an estimate of the
variance inherent in sampling a population of the
same species. Hence, the upper end of this range
gives an approximate quantitative threshold for
differentiability requirements between wingbeat
frequency distributions of different species. Thus,
we demonstrate that a diverse range of both
smart and feature phones provide highly similar acoustic spectra from the same population of mos-
quitoes, enabling a truly universal acoustics-based platform for mosquito identification.
Mosquito species have characteristic wingbeat frequency distributions
that are measurable using mobile phone recordings
The most important ingredient for acoustic identification of mosquitoes is prior knowledge of the
wingbeat frequency distributions corresponding to different species. We surveyed representative
populations from 20 medically relevant mosquito species under similar experimental conditions
(Figure
3A),
to
establish
a
reference
dataset
for
classifying
acoustic
recordings
(Mukundarajan et al., 2017). Although we recorded mosquitoes using a variety of phones, the
results presented here focus on data acquired by the 2006-model $20 SGH T-209 feature phone.
This highlights that even a basic low-end phone is capable of collecting high-quality acoustic record-
ings, to precisely measure wingbeat frequency distributions.
We analyzed the recordings of the reference populations by dividing their spectrograms into 20
ms sample windows, and applying a peak-finding algorithm in each window to measure instanta-
neous frequency. The number of frequency values we obtained for each species had a wide range
between 300 and 50,000 data points, and these were binned into wingbeat frequency distributions
(Figure 3A). To verify whether these reference distributions are sufficiently well-sampled, we drew
random subsets of frequency values from each distribution, and measured the statistical distance
from these subsets to their parent distributions. For subsets of increasing size, we observed a rapid
convergence of the BC and JSD to their respective values of 1 and 0 expected for distributions iden-
tical to the parent. We showed computationally that the smallest subset of randomly selected values
which has a BC above 0.9 as compared to the

 full distribution still has a length which is a small fraction (less than 0.2) of the total number of
samples in the full distribution for each species. Some species, such as An. dirus and An. stephensi,
show slower convergence, due to the smaller sample sizes used to build the frequency distributions.
The time for convergence above a BC of 0.9 corresponds to approximately 60 samples, or 1.2 sec-
onds of recording time, to generate a well-sampled wingbeat frequency distribution for a given pop-
ulation. Since our reference distributions were recorded for between 6 and 1000 seconds each, we
conclude that they are sufficiently representative of the variations within the reference population.
Nevertheless, it is also clear that the longer a population is sampled for, the better the frequency
distribution constructed to represent it.
We also considered whether significant variations exist between different colonies or populations
within a species. We found that different lab-reared strains of An. gambiae, including permethrin
susceptible and resistant variants sourced from Kenya and an additional bendiocarb resistant strain
sourced from Benin, produced highly similar frequency distributions with large overlaps of 0.84 to
0.89 as measured by their mutual BCs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Similarly for Aedes
aegypti, lab-reared mosquitoes from two separate colonies of the same New Orleans origin, as well
as first generation progeny from eggs retrieved from the field in Los Angeles, had high overlaps in
their frequency distributions with mutual BCs ranging between 0.66 and 0.74 (the slightly lower BC
values arise due to the distribution for one of the colonies having a smaller spread despite being
completely overlapped by the other two) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Thus, we hypothesize
that it may be possible for certain species to have wingbeat frequency distributions that are universal
across colonies and strains, facilitating automated identification using the same reference. However,
we also found that lab-reared strains of An. arabiensis originally sourced from Senegal and Sudan
have non-overlapping frequency distributions, with a very small BC of 0.14 (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1C). This signals that there may be other factors underlying geographic variability in wingbeat
frequency within a species, which merit further investigation. Hence, it is advisable to build local
acoustic databases wherever possible in order to improve classification, by recording actual fre-
quency distributions from mosquitoes whose species have been verified by non-acoustic methods
(Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D).

microprocessor to produce the same temporal sequence of sound and light. (B) Overlaid spectrograms for female Culex tarsalis mosquitoes obtained

Coefficient (BC) of 0.95. (D) Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimates over distance from a standardized sound source show that mobile phone microphone
performance within a 100 mm radius is superior or comparable to high performance studio microphones. The pink line represents the actual source
amplitude, with the pink-shaded region below indicating the region less than the actual amplitude, in which all acoustic measurements should lie. The
gray-shaded band represents the range of sensitivities between the limits set by the two studio microphones used as reference standards. The SNR
curves for all three phones lie mostly within this band, indicating that they perform in a range between the two reference microphones. (E) SNR over

limits where phones can detect the audio signal - 50 mm for the low end T-209 feature phone and 100 mm for the iPhone 4S and Xperia Z3 Compact
smartphones. The gray-dotted line represents the actual amplitude of the mosquito sound in dB, as measured by the MXL991 reference microphone.
The gray-shaded region below indicates the region less than the actual amplitude, in which all acoustic measurements are expected to lie. (F) Variation
of the wingbeat frequency distribution sampled by 8 different phones is low compared to the natural variation within a population of lab-reared
Anopheles stephensi females. Raw data are shown with overlaid box plots marking the inter-quartile range, black circles for mean frequency, gray

distributions (G, lower left triangle) shows low disparity, ranging between 0.144 and 0.3, against a minimum of 0 for identical distributions. Likewise, the
Bhattacharya distance (H, upper right triangle) shows high overlap, with values between 0.935 and 0.986, against a maximum of 1 for identical
distributions. The brown-hatched areas along the diagonal represent blank cells, as distances are not shown for any distribution with respect to itself.

correct identification of the species of a mosquito
given its wingbeat acoustic signature. Although
previous approaches have used a single averaged
value of frequency to represent a flight trace
(Moore
et al.,
1986;
Batista
et
al., 2011;
Chen
et
al.,
2014;
Silva
et
al.,
2015;
Villarreal et al., 2017), our approach takes into
account the natural variance within each trace, by
treating the collection of frequency values across
all time windows of the recording as a distribu-
tion. We classify a given flight trace by statisti-
cally
comparing
this
distribution
against
the
known wingbeat frequency distributions for dif-
ferent species. Although classification is possible
through several approaches that emphasize dif-
ferent statistical comparisons, in this work we
apply the method of Maximum Likelihood Esti-
mation (MLE). Here, the species is considered to
be a parameter, whose discrete values affect the statistical distribution of wingbeat frequency over a
specified frequency range. We classify a given flight trace as belonging to that species whose corre-
sponding wingbeat frequency distribution is most likely to have produced the observed frequency
values from that trace, with a confidence level equal to the likelihood estimate. The reference distri-
butions for comparison are built using the data presented in Figure 3A, collected using the SGH
T-209 basic phone.
The best indicator for how likely it is for recordings from a given species to be correctly classified
is the degree of overlap of its characteristic wingbeat frequency distribution with other potentially
confounding species. One way to measure this is the mutual JSD between pairs of species, which
must be significantly higher than the threshold of 0.35 established earlier for the variance inherent
within the same species. The vast majority of all possible pairwise combinations of species in our
study (184 out of 190) had JSD greater than this minimum value (Figure 3B), indicating that differen-
ces in frequency distribution between species are significant in most cases (Figure 3C). We translate
this into probabilistic estimates of classification accuracy, based on the principle that randomly
drawn samples bootstrapped from a given species’ frequency distribution will be classified with an
error rate that reflects its overlap with other species’ distributions. We applied the MLE algorithm on
bootstrapped subsets from the wingbeat frequency data used to create the reference distributions,
to build a confusion matrix showing the relative proportions in which subsets derived from different
species are classified correctly or erroneously. Our results verify that species with fairly unique and
non-overlapping wingbeat frequency distributions are almost always correctly classified, while those
with high degrees of overlap are most likely to be mutually misclassified. This provides quantitative
estimates of the inherent degree of differentiability of each species with respect to all others
(Figure 3D), setting intrinsic limits on the success of any classification scheme based exclusively on
wingbeat frequency.
The classification accuracies and error rates for samples bootstrapped from the same data used
to build reference distributions represent a best case scenario. A more realistic test of our classifica-
tion approach is its ability to handle new flight traces that are not part of the original reference data-
sets. We validated the MLE algorithm by classifying recordings from the iPhone 4S, Sony Xperia Z3
Compact, and Google Nexus One (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), by comparing
them to the reference dataset collected using the SGH T-209 (Figure 3A). This is a validation dataset
that has similar species frequency distributions as the reference dataset, but also incorporates the
additional variance arising from using different phones. We sequentially tested a large number of
individual flight traces chosen at random from eight different species, to simulate the stochastic

 nature of human-mosquito encounters involving a variety of species in the field. Each flight trace was
compared against all species in the reference dataset, and the best match was chosen. We observe
that classification accuracies are slightly lower than those obtained for bootstrapped reference data
(Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), indicating that our MLE approach is inherently lim-
ited in practice by overlaps in wingbeat frequency distributions.
Acoustic data can be combined with metadata to improve classification
accuracies
The limitations of using wingbeat frequency as the sole distinguishing characteristic between species
are exposed by the inability to perfectly classify species that have overlapping frequency distribu-
tions. A typical wingbeat frequency distribution for any given species has a spread of 150 to 200 Hz
between the 5th and 95th percentiles, located within the frequency range of 200 to 700 Hz for most
female mosquitoes. But with over 40 species of medical relevance among Anopheles mosquitoes
alone, the pigeon-hole principle makes it impossible to have perfectly non-overlapping distributions
for all species (Chen et al., 2014). Unlike speech (Rabiner and Schafer, 2011), music (Wang, 2003),
or other insects (Drosopoulos and Claridge, 2005), birds (Marler and Slabbekoorn, 2004) and ani-
mals (Mellinger et al., 2007; Mellinger and Clark, 2000; Portfors, 2007), the low time-domain
complexity of mosquito sound makes it difficult to identify temporal motifs or other acoustic param-
eters that can be used in species identification (Chen et al., 2014; Kiskin et al., 2017). To improve
the classification of mosquito species, Chen et al. (2014) introduced the concept of metadata,
where parameters like the time or place of recording can be used as additional features to differenti-
ate between mosquitoes with varying circadian activity or geographic distribution. Mobile phones

distributions but no location-time distinctions, hence distinguishable but not in all cases, (v) indistingishable due to highly overlapping frequency
distributions with co-occurrence in space and time. The brown-hatched areas along the diagonal represent blank cells, as distances are not shown for
any distribution with respect to itself. (D) Confusion matrix for classification of acoustic data bootstrapped from the reference frequency datasets for
twenty species, using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm. Each column corresponds to a particular species, from which acoustic data
is drawn for classification. The twenty entries in each column represent the fractions in which recordings from the species corresponding to that column
are classified among all twenty species in our database. This classification is done for data taken from the reference distributions, and is compared
against the same reference dataset, based exclusively on wingbeat frequency. Classification errors occur when a given species frequency distribution
has overlaps with other species, and the confusion matrix reflects the inherent uniqueness or overlap between frequency distributions in our database.
Colour scale showing fraction of recordings classified is the same for both D and E. (E) Confusion matrix for classification of test audio recordings, using
the MLE algorithm. Test data were collected for 17 species, using different phones (some or all among Google Nexus One, Sony Xperia Z3 Compact,
iPhone 4S) which were not used to construct the reference distributions (recorded using the SGH T-209). Each column corresponds to a particular test
species, from which acoustic data are drawn for classification. The twenty entries in each column represent the fractions in which recordings from the
test species corresponding to that column are classified among all twenty species in our database. Classification is based on both wingbeat frequency
and a location filter, simulating the classification of randomly recorded mosquitoes of different species by users in field conditions. The resulting
classification accuracies are significantly higher in this case, when compared to classification accuracies which do not consider location (Figure 3—
figure supplement 1D). Blank areas along three columns represent species for which test data from a different phone were not available. (F,G)

 offer the advantage of automatically registering time stamps for acoustic data, and location tags
from cell tower or GPS measurements, along with sensors to collect other metadata such as photo-
graphs which can support identification. We assessed the effect of including even a single metadata
parameter to refine species classification, by applying a location filter based on entomological survey
data from over 200 countries for the 20 species in our database (Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit,
2017). These data are available in the public domain (Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit, 2017), and
can be readily incorporated as prior knowledge to aid in classification. We repeated our sequential
classification of flight traces from randomly chosen species, with each recording randomly assigned
to one of the countries where that species is known to be found. Recordings are then compared
only among the subset of species co-located in that country. This significantly improved classification
accuracy not only for individual species, but also from about 35% to 65%, as an average over all the
species tested (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). In earlier work, algorithms for mos-
quito species classification have achieved accuracies of around 80%, when comparing a smaller num-
ber (10) of insect types. This included both sexes of four acoustically dimorphic mosquito species,
and two species of flies (Chen et al., 2014). Although the overall classification accuracy by our
method is a little lower at 65%, we note that this is for twice the number of species and includes
only female mosquitoes. Since classification accuracy decreases significantly with the number of spe-
cies considered and their degree of frequency overlap, the accuracies produced by our classification
algorithm appear to be reasonable in comparison to earlier work. We underline the caveat that in
practice, classification accuracies can be further lowered by species other than the ones in our refer-
ence database. However, the inclusion of a location filter eliminates potential errors from irrelevant
species, and highlights the discriminatory power of such metadata.
For greater clarity, we illustrate a few scenarios where acoustic data can be combined with meta-
data for identifying mosquitoes in field investigations (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In the sim-
plest case, species with completely non-overlapping frequency distributions, such as Anopheles
gambiae and Culex pipiens (JSD = 1, negligible probability of mutual mis-classification), can easily
be distinguished by sound alone (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). Some species with overlapping
frequency distributions can still be perfectly classified using location metadata on the basis of their
spatial segregation. For instance, An. atroparvus has a 38% probability of being mis-classified as An.
dirus (overlapping frequency distribution with mutual JSD ¼ 0:26<0:35). However, this confusion
never occurs when location is taken into account, as these species are respectively found in Europe
and South Asia (Sinka et al., 2012), and do not co-exist in the same area (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 2B). The use of timestamps has been suggested previously in the case of species which are
overlapping in both frequency and spatial distribution, but have different circadian activity
(Chen et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2015). As an example, Ae. aegypti is often misclassified as An. gam-
biae with high probability based on wingbeat frequency (mutual JSD ¼ 0:37 ~ 0:35, Ae. aegypti
wrongly classified 95% of the time). However, classification accuracy may possibly be substantially
improved if recordings collected during daytime were all classified as Ae. aegypti, since it is much
more likely to be active during daylight hours (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). Co-occurring and
morphologically similar species of interest that can be acoustically distinguished include the arboviral
vectors Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Brogdon, 1994) (JSD ¼ 0:55>0:35, correctly distinguished
by MLE around 98% of the time), and the closely related species Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefascia-
tus (JSD ¼ 0:65>0:35, correctly distinguished around 95% of the time) (Figure 3—figure supplement
2D). Morphologically indistinguishable vector species like members of the Anopheles gambiae s.l.
complex are of particular interest for acoustic identification (Brogdon, 1998; Wekesa et al., 1998;
Tripet et al., 2004). Our results for four members of this complex imply significant distinguishability
for An. arabiensis, An. quadriannulatus, An. gambiae, and An. merus. The JSD for all but one species
pair ranges between 0.61 and 0.91 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E), and An. gambiae and An.
quadriannulatus are correctly identified with over 97% probability. However, the pair of An. arabien-
sis and An. merus has high frequency overlap (JSD ¼ 0:29<0:35, An. arabiensis is misclassified as An.
merus with around 15% probability) (Figure 3—figure supplement 2F). Improving classification
rates in this case may not be possible without additional knowledge of their specific local ecology,
such as the distribution of saltwater breeding sites for the halophilic An. merus. Despite such limiting
cases, the wingbeat frequency combined with phone provided metadata has significant discrimina-
tory power between species in many situations, making mobile phone-based acoustic surveillance an
extremely promising screening tool for mosquito population compositions (Figure 3C).

 Mobile phones can be effectively used to map mosquito activity
through user-driven acoustic surveillance
So far, we have calibrated the performance of mobile phones and studied acoustic frequency disper-
sion among different mosquito species, using lab-reared populations in controlled environments.
We now test our mobile phone based surveillance approach under field conditions, by collecting
mosquito wingbeat data in various settings and measuring acoustic variance among wild mosquito
populations. Using the techniques described earlier (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Videos 1–
3), we recorded mosquitoes not only in free flight, but also under confinement in cups or bottles to
amplify the sound and increase the length of flight traces, due to the enforced proximity to the
microphone. We also collected recordings in a wide range of ambient environments, from urban and
rural homes, both indoors and outdoors, to forests and parks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1,
Supplementary files 2–7). We obtained mosquito recordings with high SNR, whose distinctive nar-
row-spectrum characteristics allow their easy visual identification in spectrograms against back-
ground noises such as birdsong, fire truck sirens, and human speech. We matched the sound
signatures against our frequency distribution database (Figure 3A for females, data for males not
shown) to identify their species, which we also confirmed by capturing the respective specimens for
morphological identification by microscopy.
Wild mosquitoes in field environments may vary considerably in terms of age, body size, rearing
temperature, and nutrition status, yet our method requires the variation in their wingbeat frequen-
cies to be sufficiently small in order to be identifiable. We explored the variations in wingbeat fre-
quency for flight traces corresponding to over 80 individual free-flying Aedes sierrensis mosquitoes,
recorded by volunteers at Big Basin Redwoods State Park in California, USA (BBR) (Figure 4—figure
supplement 2A). Wingbeat frequency distributions for a population typically span a characteristic
frequency range with a spread of around 150 to 200 Hz (Figure 3A). For individual flight traces col-
lected in the field, the distributions lie at different positions within the population-level frequency
range, and have spreads (difference between 5th and 95th percentile) between 10 and 100 Hz (Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 2B,C). The spread in frequency for a single flight trace is typically smaller
than the spread across a population, with the difference between mean frequencies for different
traces contributing to the additional variation in the population’s frequency distribution. This spread
in each flight trace also appears uncorrelated to the duration of the trace itself (Figure 4—figure
supplement 2B,C), suggesting that it may arise due to aerial manoeuvers during flight (Video 6).
Although the mean frequency for most individuals is tightly clustered, there are still outliers that
pose challenges for classification (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). Additionally, the classification
accuracy for any given recording was not a function of the duration of the trace but of the mean fre-
quency, indicating that overlaps between frequency distribution play the fundamental role in identi-
fying the species correctly, no matter how long the flight trace is recorded for (Figure 4—figure
supplement 2D). We also observed that frequency distributions for individual flight traces have a
minimum spread of around 2% of the mean fre-
quency irrespective of the mean frequency or
the duration of the recording, suggesting that
this is an inherent natural variation in the wing-
beat frequency during free flight (Figure 4—fig-
ure supplement 2C). Further, both the spread
and the duration of the recording did not affect
whether the recording was classified correctly
(Figure 4—figure supplement 2E), corroborat-
ing the importance of wingbeat frequency as the
primary identifying factor.
Wingbeat
frequency
for
insects,
including
mosquitoes, has been shown to vary linearly with
temperature (Oertli, 1989; Villarreal et al.,
2017). It may be possible to correct for this fac-
tor by measuring ambient temperature when
recording as part of relevant metadata, as sug-
gested in other studies (Chen et al., 2014). We

 also investigated correlations between wingbeat frequency and body size, by comparing the physical
specimens corresponding to several flight traces (Figure 3F,G). For mosquitoes varying almost two-
fold in size (Figure 3G), the difference in mean frequency between each mosquito is less than the
spread within each individual flight trace, and non-monotonic with body size (Figure 3F). This pro-
vides a field confirmation of lab studies that show no relationship between wingbeat frequency and
body size (Villarreal et al., 2017). Despite the variations among individuals, our MLE approach
(using a pool of all field recordings together to create a reference frequency distribution) was able
to correctly classify recordings from wild Aedes sierrensis mosquitoes in about two-thirds of cases
(54 out of 82 recordings), when considering other local species (Cx. pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus,
Cx. tarsalis, and Cu. incidens) as potential confounders.
We next show how mobile phone recordings of mosquitoes in the field can be pooled from mini-
mally trained users for spatio-temporal mapping, using the time and location metadata associated
with each recording. Our recordings of wild Ae. sierrensis mosquitoes in BBR (Figure 4—figure sup-
plement 2A) represent the only species found in the park, based on microscopic identification of
the corresponding captured specimens. These were collected over a continuous 3 hour period by 15
volunteers hiking along trails and recording with their personal mobile phones. The recordings were
mapped according to their locations to reflect spatial variations in mosquito distribution within the
park (Figure 4D). Parsing this data by recording time further reveals the rise and fall in the number
of human-mosquito encounters over an evening (Figure 4D inset), which can be correlated to the
circadian activity of Ae. sierrensis.
In addition to the temperate forest environment represented by BBR, we carried out another
small-scale field trial in a tropical village, at Ranomafana (District Ifanadiana) in Madagascar (RNM).
Here, our first step was to establish the baseline species composition, by collecting live mosquitoes
in traps or bags and identifying them using microscopy. We found both Anopheles and Culex mos-
quitoes (Zohdy et al., 2016), which we identified only to genus level in the field. We recorded sev-
eral minutes of acoustic data from both, to form a frequency distribution reference database specific
to the RNM field site, for comparing new data from phone recordings (Figure 4A,B). We obtained
two clearly separated frequency distributions with a single peak each, implying that the two genera
were easily distinguishable by wingbeat frequency alone. About 60 recordings were collected in a 3-
hour period by 10 volunteers who were trained for about 15 minutes and stationed at specific loca-
tions in the village. This number of recordings exceeded the number of mosquitoes simultaneously
captured in CDC light traps placed at the same locations. Mapping the distributions of the two gen-
era of mosquitoes across the village revealed considerable heterogeneity in the proportions of
Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes from the western riverside to the eastern hillside, possibly influ-
enced by extremely local factors such as drainage, density of humans, or presence of livestock
(Figure 4C). This heterogeneity was concordant with the data from CDC light traps, which collected
Anopheles mosquitoes only in those locations where they were also recorded by volunteers
(Figure 4C, insets). Although the ratio of the two kinds of mosquitoes varied between acoustic
recording and conventional trapping at each location, there was a qualitative correspondence
between the two methods in terms of the relative number of mosquitoes at a location, and the more
numerous species.
Together, the two pilot field trials at BBR and RNM highlight spatial variations in mosquito distri-
butions along with their circadian activity patterns, in very different field environments. The greater
number of observations obtained by pooling mobile phone recordings as compared to trapping
indicates that phones may be a more productive means of sampling mosquito populations. At the
same time, the maps of mosquito activity at both field sites were extremely localized, on the level of
minutes and tens of metres. This demonstrates how mobile phone based crowdsourcing can simulta-
neously enhance both the scale and the resolution of ecological measurements of mosquito popula-
tions, indicating considerable potential for such an approach to the spatiotemporal mapping of
mosquito vectors.
Discussion
In this work, we demonstrate a new technique for mosquito surveillance, using mobile phones as
networked acoustic sensors to collect wingbeat frequency data for automated identification. We
present quantitative analyses of mobile phone acoustic signal quality and the differentiability of

 important mosquito species, complemented by field data collected by minimally trained volunteers
and organized into spatio-temporal maps.
The involvement of local volunteers in our study underlines that practically anyone with a mobile
phone can quickly be trained to contribute data towards mosquito surveillance efforts. Based on the
proof-of-concept presented here for a mobile phone based surveillance framework, we propose a
citizen science effort for mapping mosquito populations (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and
2). Citizen science is an exciting paradigm for community-based vector surveillance, with emerging
initiatives such as the United Nations-backed Global Mosquito Alert. These programs rely on data
collected by volunteers from the general public, in the form of physical specimens or through apps
for reporting the presence of mosquitoes with photographs for expert identification. Our proposed
platform would support the collection of mosquito sound recordings from mobile phone users, auto-
mating the audio processing to instantly identify and map the species without human intervention.
This approach has the potential to greatly expand surveillance efforts in resource-limited areas
where they are needed the most, by enabling people to take the initiative in tracking disease vectors
within their own communities.
The greatly reduced cost of surveillance as a result of using pre-existing infrastructure, together
with the ability to localize mosquito recordings, allows both the coverage and resolution of mosquito
field maps to increase. The availability of sufficient data on highly local scales could inform mosquito
control strategies tailored to a given location. Further, this approach also has the potential to screen
for the presence of exotic or invasive species, particularly in high-risk areas such as port cities. Addi-
tionally, it provides a rapid and easy way to survey baseline mosquito populations in a given area
and their fluctuations over time, which may be highly relevant for programs that aim to control mos-
quito populations through the release of sterile or genetically modified organisms. The implicit need
for human involvement in our method skews the collection strongly towards species that are most
likely to encounter a human. Although all methods of mosquito collection, including various traps,
have biases in the species they predominantly attract, the over-representation of anthropophilic spe-
cies is a caveat to be noted when probing mosquito ecology using our method.
We have focused on statistical Maximum Likelihood Estimation methods for acoustic identifica-
tion of mosquitoes, using known distributions corresponding to different species as a reference.
There are however many possible methods to predict the species that a given recording belongs to,
with various techniques for incorporating prior knowledge about the wingbeat frequency, circadian
activity, habitat and other characteristics of the relevant mosquito species. The field of computa-
tional entomology, which includes the development of algorithms for the automated identification
of mosquito sound in acoustic data and its classification by species is an active area of research, with
growing relevance for the automation of mosquito surveillance (Chen et al., 2014; Silva et al.,
2015; Kiskin et al., 2017). There is considerable scope for studies that not only search for more
acoustic features that discriminate between mosquito species, but also those which use spatiotem-
poral population data to identify trends and patterns. These can be correlated to other man-made
and environmental factors, to enable evidence-based decision making for mosquito control and

 disease management. Such insights require not only the development of algorithms capable of sift-
ing through surveillance data, but also considerable expansion of our databases of prior knowledge
to train these algorithms to identify more species across diverse areas of the world.
Recent technological trends have spurred a rapid rise in apps and services based on crowdsourc-
ing data about the physical world through embedded sensors and user input from mobile phones.
Applying analytics methods and spatiotemporal mapping on this data provides useful information
ranging from traffic density to restaurant recommendations to earthquake warnings. At present, the
critical missing link in enabling similar advances in mosquito surveillance and control is the capacity
to generate large quantities of mosquito ecological data on fine-grained space and time scales
(Ferguson et al., 2010). Our mobile phone based solution holds great promise as a scalable, non-
invasive, high-throughput and low-cost strategy to generate such data, by leveraging widely avail-
able hardware and an existing network infrastructure. We hope that a citizen science approach to
mosquito surveillance based on this method will boost our capability to dynamically assess mosquito
populations, study their connections to human and environmental factors, and develop highly local-
ized strategies for pre-emptive mosquito control (Hay et al., 2013).
Methods and materials
Acquisition of acoustic data from mobile phones
Different mobile phones were used to collect sounds from mosquitoes, using audio recording soft-
ware that was already freely available on the devices, including applications for voice messaging,
voice memos, or sound recording. To locate the primary microphone on the body of the mobile
phone, we either read the location of a user manual showing its different components, or found the
microphone by trial-and-error, where we tapped the phone periphery and observed the response of
the recording software to locate the area with maximum audio sensitivity. The primary microphone
is oriented towards the mosquito for maximum sensitivity in audio acquisition. Audio data from the
phones was compiled and transferred to a server for processing. This method applies to all figures.
Processing of acoustic data from mobile phones
The audio signals from mosquitoes were acquired at different sampling rates ranging from 8 kHz to
44.1 kHz and a variety of file formats, depending on the mobile phones and the specific in-built or
user-defined settings on the recording applications used to acquire the signal. When a raw signal
was acquired from the phone, it was converted into the WAV format for convenience of processing,
with sampling rate interpolated to 44.1 kHz if sampled at a lower rate. To reduce constant back-
ground noise in the signal, we used a spectral subtraction algorithm, with the fundamental principle
of subtracting the actual or expected frequency content of pure noise from the spectrum of the
noisy signal. Here, we identified the background using an automated algorithm as those spectral
bands that are constant with almost zero variation in amplitude and frequency across the entire
sound clip. To generate the audio frequency spectrum over different instants of time, we applied
the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT ; Signal Processing Toolbox, MATLAB R2015B) to produce a
spectrogram with resolutions of 5 Hz in frequency and 20 ms in time, having a high degree (90%) of
overlap between windows to achieve a trade-off between sufficient frequency resolution and accu-
rate localization of the signal in time.
Construction of wingbeat frequency distributions (Mukundarajan et al.,
2017)
Using the spectrogram, we construct histograms for the distribution of peak frequencies for mosqui-
toes of a given species. Once a sound was identified (either manually or using an automated code)
as belonging to a mosquito of a given species, the lowest frequency corresponding to a local maxi-
mum in amplitude was detected using a peak finding algorithm. In cases where more than one mos-
quito is recorded sequentially in the same file, they are considered separate instances, distinguished
as contiguous durations of peak frequency in a given range separated by time. In cases where
recordings from mosquitoes overlap, the louder mosquito is considered. In many studies, a repre-
sentative wingbeat frequency is found for a single flight trace by averaging the fundamental fre-
quency over all time instants. However, the wingbeat frequency from a single continuous mosquito

Epidemiology and Global Health
 signal can vary over a range of about 100 Hz for a tethered mosquito, and over a few tens of Hz for
mosquitoes in free-flight. To take into account this natural variation in wingbeat frequency over the
duration for an audio signal, we did not average the frequency over time, but instead focused on
the instantaneous frequency computed in each 20 ms interval time window. Each time window was
treated as an individual instance, and its fundamental frequency added to a histogram, to bring out
the natural variations in wingbeat frequency within a single signal. Peak frequencies from all time
windows are binned with a bin size of 5 Hz - the same frequency resolution imposed upon the spec-
trogram. This yields a histogram that captures the distribution of peak frequencies for that mosquito
species, without making a priori assumptions about the nature of this distribution. For statistical
computations, the histograms are normalized by the total number of instances such that the area
under the distribution sums up to 1, yielding a discrete probability density distribution for wingbeat
frequency. However, for ease of representation in figures, probability mass functions where the his-
togram counts are normalized relative to the maximum number of counts in a single bin are shown,
so that each histogram spans 0 to 1 on the y-axis. This method applies to all figures.
Statistical tests and metrics
Wingbeat frequency was represented as discrete probability density distributions, with the fre-
quency binned into intervals of 5 Hz (the computational accuracy for frequency in our STFT analyses)
and the area under the probability density distribution summing up to 1. The peak frequency mea-
sured in each time window of the video or audio was treated as an individual sample, and the 2-sam-
ple T-test carried out using the MATLAB Statistics toolbox at a significance level of 1% for peak
frequencies of the 165 time windows compared. The peak frequency samples measured from video
and audio were tested to check if the distributions had highly similar mean and variance, indicating
that they have been sampled from the same probability distribution function. This method applies to
Figure 2C. The Bhattacharya overlap coefficient (BC) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence metric (JSD)
were computed between pairs of wingbeat frequency distributions, where the number of counts of
wingbeat frequency in each bin are normalized by the product of the total number of samples and
the range of the independent variable (frequency, 200 to 700 Hz) to yield a probability density distri-
bution with unit area under the curve. BC is calculated as the sum of the geometric mean of the two
probability densities in each bin, ranging between a minimum of 0 for disparate non-overlapping dis-
tributions and a maximum of 1 for identical distributions. The JSD is calculated as the square root of
the arithmetic mean of the Kullback-Leibler divergences of each distribution with respect to the
other, for each pair of distributions considered. These methods apply to Figure 2G,H, and
Figure 3B.
Testing and validation of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
algorithm
Algorithm description
In this classification algorithm, the different species are treated as discrete values of a parameter
that alters the point mass function for the distribution of frequency from mosquito sound. A given
observation is statistically compared to each distribution to deduce which one it is most likely to
have been sampled from, and the species with maximum likelihood to be the parent distribution is
identified. We chose this strategy as an appropriate method for identification, as it attempts to iden-
tify the statistical distribution that is most likely to have produced the observed data, i.e. it attempts
to identify the species that is most likely to have produced an observed sound recording. This is par-
ticularly appropriate as we treat each recording not as a single data point, but as a distribution of
wingbeat frequencies over the duration of the recording. Hence, to compare and classify the
observed distribution from the recording with respect to the various reference distributions, MLE
provides a natural solution. We use wingbeat frequency data from each species, isolated for each 20
ms sample window using a peak finding routine on the spectrogram as described earlier, to con-
struct the point mass functions that describe the wingbeat frequency distributions for each species.
We also treat any given acoustic recording being queried as a collection of discrete samples of wing-
beat frequency from 20 ms windows. For each sample window frequency in this recording, we find
the probability density of its occurrence in the frequency distributions corresponding to each spe-
cies. We thus construct a matrix that gives the probability of occurrence in each of the frequency

 distributions corresponding to each species, for each sample point of frequency in the given record-
ing. Assuming each sample point of frequency in the given recording to be independent, we now
sum across all sample points to obtain a measure of the combined likelihood that all sample window
frequencies in the recording were produced from each species frequency distribution. We add these
values instead of multiplying, to avoid the case where a single outlier frequency value in a recording
has the power to veto a certain species due to having zero probability of occurrence in the corre-
sponding frequency distribution. We choose the species which has the maximum likelihood for the
total over all sample windows of that recording, as the species with the maximum likelihood of hav-
ing produced a recording with that given set of frequency values.
Location filter
We constructed a location filter by looking up the presence or absence of all the species in our data-
base in a set of 200 countries, as recorded in the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit Mosquito Identifi-
cation Database (Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit, 2017). When applying the filter, we choose a
location at random for a recording from a given species, based on its geographical distribution as
specified in our location matrix. When finding the species with the maximum likelihood of having
produced the frequencies observed in that recording, we now only choose from other species that
are also located in the country chosen for our recording, as per our location matrix. This winnows
down the number of choices for the species, eliminating those with similar frequency distributions
but which are not geographically relevant.
Validation using bootstrapped data
We first applied our algorithm to find the probability of correct classification of bootstrapped data
from the original set of frequency values that was used to generate the wingbeat frequency distribu-
tions for each species. This is expected to correctly classify species whose frequency distributions do
not have much overlap with others, and make mistakes when classifying species which have signifi-
cant overlaps with others. For each species, we choose a random subset of frequency values from
the original distribution and assign it to the species with maximum estimated likelihood. We repeat
this for a total of 10,000 random subsets per species, to find the asymptotically convergent probabil-
ity of classification for a large number of trials. A confusion matrix was generated by finding the frac-
tions of these 10,000 trials for each species that were classified correctly, or erroneously to a certain
other species. As expected, we see very high classification accuracies (greater than 0.99) for species
with relatively non-overlapping frequency distributions, with errors arising exclusively in the classifi-
cation of overlapping species.
K-fold validation by partitioning data
To get an idea of classification errors that arise when the data being queried is not itself used to
generate the distribution against which it is being compared, we performed K-fold validation for K
from 2 to 10. Here, we partitioned the data into K groups, and used one group to generate queries
which were matched against distributions generated using the other (K-1) folds. The confusion
matrix generated in this case had very similar values as the one generated for bootstrapped data.
Validation using test data
We finally validated our approach against test data that was collected in a separate experiment
using a different phone, from the same reference populations. Contiguous individual mosquito
traces were chosen from these recordings, and compared against the reference distributions. This
validation was performed both with and without the location filter, to show the effect of including
location metadata to refine classification.
Mosquito specimens
Mosquito colonies were sourced from a number of different labs and facilities, including our own.
Mosquitoes were typically chosen to be between 5 and 15 days, with all individuals in a colony aged
within two days of each other. Females were typically mated but not bloodfed. The lab reared colo-
nies used in this work sourced from the BEI Resources Vector Resource collection were Aedes

tured at Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California, USA), Anopheles spp., Culex spp. and Mansonia
spp. (captured at the Centre ValBio and Ranomafana village, Madagascar).
Comparisons with high speed videography
We acquired high speed video of tethered mosquitoes in the lab using a Phantom v1610 camera, at
10,000 frames per second (Video 5). Simultaneously, we made audio recordings using a mobile
phone placed with the primary microphone 10 mm away and oriented towards the mosquito. Since
the audio and video are completely independent as the camera does not talk to the phone, synchro-
nization was achieved using a specially designed setup to produce a specific light and sound pattern.
We connected a piezoelectric buzzer and an LED to the same pin of an Arduino. The buzzer and
LED are both fed the same pattern of voltage by the microprocessor. Hence, the frequency of sound
from the buzzer recorded in the audio exactly matches the frequency of light flashes from the LED
recorded in the video at every instant of time, allowing the audio and video spectrograms to be
aligned in time. We programmed the Arduino to produce a square wave at 5000 Hz and 50% duty
cycle for 500 ms, followed by a 500 ms pause, and then a square wave at 2000 Hz for 500 ms. This
gave us four time points - the beginning and end of each waveform - to use for aligning the corre-
sponding spectrograms from video and audio in time. The video data were thresholded and the
area of the wing (which we recorded face on) was computed in each frame. We plotted a waveform
of the change in projected wing area over time, and applied the STFT to produce a spectrogram.
The fundamental frequency in the spectrogram corresponded to the wingbeat, with higher harmon-
ics corresponding to subtle variations in wing kinematics such as wing deformation during clap-and-
fling. Acoustic data from the mobile phone was processed as described in the section above. The
two spectrograms were computed to the same time and frequency resolutions of 5 Hz and 20 ms,
and aligned in time based on the best match of the four points of synchronization. This method
applies to Figure 2B.
Comparisons to studio microphones
Comparison with an acoustic gold standard was achieved using the Marshall MXL991 and Apex 220
microphones, the latter of which is calibrated to have a flat frequency response between 100 and
1000 Hz. The two studio microphones were connected to a pre-amplifier (Onyx) with the gain set to
its maximum value of 60 dB, after ensuring that this would still avoid saturation. We carried out
experiments to calibrate the sensitivity of mobile phones over distance using a standardized sound
source - a piezoelectric buzzer ringing at 500 Hz, with its amplitude measured before every

 recording to be constant at 77 dB at the edge of the buzzer disc. To compare the ability of mobile
phones to record mosquito sounds, we recorded tethered male and female Culex tarsalis mosqui-
toes. We placed the microphones at an identical distance to the left of the mosquito as we placed
the mobile phone primary microphone to its right, since waveforms produced by the two wings are
assumed to be symmetrical. We synchronized recordings from all three sources using the times of
initiation and cessation of wingbeat sound, with multiple flight traces in a single dataset. Using the
amplitudes recorded by the Marshall MXL991 studio microphone which has a known 1=r2 drop in
recorded amplitude, we deduced the actual amplitude produced by the mosquito in a given experi-
ment, and standardized the corresponding mobile phone SNR for a uniform source amplitude of
45 dB (which we measured to be a typical amplitude produced by a mosquito). Spectrograms con-
structed independently and aligned in time are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. These
methods apply to Figure 2D,E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.
Acoustic data collection in the lab from tethered mosquitoes
Individual sound traces for distance calibration experiments were collected from tethered mosqui-
toes. Individuals were aspirated out of the cage and knocked out with a puff of carbon dioxide. The
wings were gently spread to move them out of the way, and a pipette tip was affixed to the scutum
with a bead of low-melting insect wax. The pipette tip was clamped in a stand, and the appropriate
recording device - mobile phone, studio microphone or high speed camera - was clamped in another
stand at the desired orientation and a specified distance away from the pipette tip as measured by a
ruler. The legs of the mosquito are gently stimulated by touch to induce a flight reflex, after which
the wings beat for a period of a few seconds to minutes. This method applies to Figure 2A,B,D,E.
Acoustic data collection in the lab from caged populations
Wingbeat frequency distributions for a given species were measured from lab-reared populations
maintained in 1-ft cubical cages. Cages typically contained between 100 and 300 individuals of males
and females each, with the sexes segregated into separate cages whenever possible. The mobile
phones were inserted by hand through the stockinette sleeves of the cages, with the primary micro-
phones oriented away from the hand, and moved to follow individual mosquitoes in flight or against
walls or corners of the cage. Care was taken to avoid introducing noise from bumping against the
cage surfaces or rubbing against the sleeve. Between 5 and 10 minutes of data were collected per
cage, and high amplitude noise due to bumps was eliminated using an automated algorithm. This
method applies to Figure 2F, Figure 3A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2. In some cases, indi-
vidual mosquitoes were introduced into an otherwise empty cage, to record free flight traces from a
specific mosquito in the lab. This method applies to Figure 4A,B.
Acoustic data collection in the field
Field acoustic data were collected in a variety of locations, including homes and gardens around San
Francisco and Palo Alto, USA, at Stanford University’s Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, and around
the Centre ValBio in Ranomafana, Madagascar. Mosquitoes were either followed with a phone dur-
ing free flight around the user, or captured live in a Ziploc bag and subsequently recorded by put-
ting the phone’s primary microphone against the bag (while taking care not to introduce noise due
to crumpling or brushing the bag surface). This method applies to Figure 4. The pilot demonstra-
tions of field recording and mapping of mosquitoes were organized with small teams of volunteers
working in pairs, with 14 and 10 users respectively in Big Basin Redwoods State Park in California,
USA (20 km2, between 5:30PM and 8:30PM on 17 August 2016), and in Ranomafana village, district
Ifanadiana, Madagascar (4 km2, between 6PM and 8PM on 26-28 October 2016). During the studies,
volunteers were hiking along trails in Big Basin Park, and were gathered in houses or shops in Rano-
mafana village. Prior to the field study, we initially collected live mosquitoes from the field, recorded
them in the lab to create a curated database of signatures for those specific locations, and later mor-
phologically identified them through microscopy for association with each acoustic signature
(Figure 4A,B). Subsequently, field recordings were made by the teams, and each recording was
assigned a species by comparing with the databases (Figure 4B). During the field exercises, the
users also collected matched physical specimens from the field in grinder tubes and Ziploc bags cor-
responding to many of the audio recordings, which were morphologically identified to confirm the

 IDs assigned based on the acoustic database. The recordings were associated with a location as
reported by GPS or the user, and timestamped automatically by the recording application on the
mobile phone, for spatio-temporal placement of each observation. Maps were prepared by counting
the number of reliably identified acoustic signatures for each location. This method applies to
Figure 4C,D.
