Increased proteolytic activity has been widely associated with skeletal muscle atrophy. However, 
elevated proteolysis is also critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by disposing cytotoxic 
proteins and non-functioning organelles. We recently demonstrated that exercise activates autophagy 
and re-establishes proteostasis in cardiac diseases. Here, we characterized the impact of exercise 
on skeletal muscle autophagy and proteostasis in a model of neurogenic myopathy induced by 
sciatic nerve constriction in rats. Neurogenic myopathy, characterized by progressive atrophy and 
impaired contractility, was paralleled by accumulation of autophagy-related markers and loss of acute 
responsiveness to both colchicine and chloroquine. These changes were correlated with elevated levels 
of damaged proteins, chaperones and pro-apoptotic markers compared to control animals. Sustained 
autophagy inhibition using chloroquine in rats (50 mg.kg−1.day−1) or muscle-specific deletion of Atg7 in 
mice was sufficient to impair muscle contractility in control but not in neurogenic myopathy, suggesting 
that dysfunctional autophagy is critical in skeletal muscle pathophysiology. Finally, 4 weeks of aerobic 
exercise training (moderate treadmill running, 5x/week, 1 h/day) prior to neurogenic myopathy 
improved skeletal muscle autophagic flux and proteostasis. These changes were followed by spared 
muscle mass and better contractility properties. Taken together, our findings suggest the potential 
value of exercise in maintaining skeletal muscle proteostasis and slowing down the progression of 
neurogenic myopathy.
Skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction are hallmarks of several degenerative processes1. Considering the 
continuous increase in lifespan, it is expected that pathology- or disuse-induced muscle weakness/wasting will 
likely affect every person during lifetime2. Therefore, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular sign-
aling pathways involved in skeletal muscle pathophysiology as well as the development of pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological interventions are critical to improve quality of life in the long-term.
Skeletal muscle is an extremely plastic tissue that modifies its size through adjustments in both protein syn-
thesis and degradation. Increased proteolytic pathways (i.e. autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system) have 
been extensively associated with loss of muscle mass3,4. However, proteolysis is also crucial for the maintenance 
of proteostasis and cellular homeostasis5. We and others have previously reported that proteostasis disruption 
contributes to the onset and progression of many degenerative diseases through the accumulation of damaged 
proteins (i.e. misfolded proteins)6,7. Therefore, a better understanding of proteolytic pathways involved in tis-
sue proteostasis during both physiological and pathological conditions is critical for developing better therapies 
against degenerative diseases such as skeletal myopathies.
Autophagy (also referred as macroautophagy) plays a critical role in protecting post-mitotic cells, including 
skeletal muscle, from stress–induced toxicity8. This highly conserved proteolytic pathway – driven by more than 
30 components, coordinates and oversees the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles by engulfing cyto-
solic material into autophagosomes (double-membraned vesicles) and assisting them to fuse with lysosomes for

degradation9,10. Autophagy-related markers are usually elevated in different models of skeletal muscle atrophy/
dysfunction11–13 and impaired autophagy is associated with severe skeletal myopathy-related diseases such as 
Pompe, Danon and MDC1A5. Moreover, the inability to induce autophagy under stress results in a more pro-
nounced skeletal myopathy in both rodents and humans14–17.
Skeletal muscle-related properties (i.e. grip strength, neuromuscular tasks, aerobic exercise capacity) are con-
sidered independent predictors of survival, and even small increases in general muscle function reflects into a 
better quality of life and lower risks of mortality18,19. Therefore, there is a clinical need in preventing or delaying 
the onset of skeletal muscle degeneration in order to extend healthspan. In this regard, exercise has been used as a 
safety non-pharmacological strategy capable of attenuating muscle weakness/wasting in both health and disease. 
We recently reported that exercise protects failing hearts by activating autophagy and maintaining proteosta-
sis20–22. Moreover, autophagy seems to be critical to induce skeletal muscle remodeling triggered by exercise23. 
Despite the prominent role of autophagy and protein homeostasis in maintaining muscle physiology, the impact 
of exercise on protein quality control in skeletal myopathies is not fully understood. Here, we set out to deter-
mine the role of exercise in preventing the impairment of skeletal muscle autophagy and proteostasis as well as 
its impact on muscle mass and contractility properties in a rat model of neurogenic myopathy induced by sciatic 
nerve constriction (SNC).
Results
Skeletal muscle proteostasis is impaired during progression of neurogenic myopathy. 
Skeletal 
muscle proteostasis is impaired during progression of neurogenic myopathy. To investigate the skeletal muscle 
proteostasis profile during progression of neurogenic myopathy, we first measured morphological and functional 
parameters of skeletal muscle in a rat model of permanent SNC (Fig. 1A). A progressive muscle wasting, depicted 
by reduced muscle mass, was observed in plantaris muscle following 2, 7 and 14 days of SNC (Fig. 1B). The skel-
etal muscle atrophy that reached ~55% 14 days after surgery was also apparent at the single fiber level, measured 
by myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA). Moreover, the distribution of fiber sizes in plantaris muscle showed a 
leftward shift during disuse due to an increase in the small fibers percentage (Fig. 1B–D). These changes were 
accompanied by a reduction in extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) ex vivo contractile properties assessed 
by maximal tetanic absolute force (Fig. 1E,F) when compared to Control rats.

We next measured the levels of critical markers of skeletal muscle proteostasis in neurogenic myopathy. The 
progression of muscle atrophy and dysfunction in SNC rats was followed by increased levels of misfolded, poly-
ubiquitinated and carbonylated proteins in skeletal muscle of SNC animals (Fig. 2A,D). Accumulation of dam-
aged proteins was paralleled by elevated levels of chaperones α
β
-crystallin, HSP27 and HSP90 in SNC animals 
over 14 days of neurogenic myopathy (Fig. 2B,D). Finally, the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunc-
tion was depicted by increased levels of pro-apoptotic markers caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 as well as reduced 
levels of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 in skeletal muscle from SNC animals (Fig. 2C,D). Taken together, these 
findings suggest that proteostasis is impaired during the progression of skeletal muscle dysfunction in a model of 
neurogenic myopathy in rats.
Autophagy is compromised in neurogenic myopathy. 
Considering that autophagy degradation sys-
tem comprises one of the main effectors in regulating proteostasis5,24,25, we set out to determine the skeletal mus-
cle levels of autophagy-related markers as well as the autophagic flux in neurogenic myopathy. At 14 days after 
SNC there was an increase in autophagy-related markers associated with both elongation and maturation of the 
autophagosome (Atg3, Beclin-1, LC3 and p62) in atrophic/dysfunctional skeletal muscle compared to Control 
animals (Fig. 3A). However, due to the dynamism and complexity of autophagy machinery, accumulation of these 
proteins may reflect either increased or insufficient autophagy process26.
To better understand the meaning of increased levels of autophagy-related markers during skeletal muscle 
atrophy/dysfunction, we carried out two different assays to measure autophagic flux27,28. First, we performed 
an in vivo autophagic flux assay by treating the rats 48 hours before the end of the experimental protocol with 
colchicine (0.4 mg.kg−
1, a microtubule depolarizing agent that blocks autophagosome maturation to autolyso-
somes). As expected, colchicine treatment increased skeletal muscle LC3-II:I ratio and LC3-II levels in Control, 
but not in SNC rats (Fig. 3B). Additionally, we also inhibited autophagic process ex vivo by incubating plantaris 
muscle with chloroquine (100 μ
g.mL−
1, 4 h −
37 °C, a compound that neutralizes the lysosomal pH), which also 
resulted in increased LC3-II:I ratio and ~70% accumulation of LC3-II in muscles from Control, but not from 
SNC animals (Fig. 3C). Both in vivo and ex vivo autophagic flux assays resulted in accumulation of p62 levels in 
muscles from Control, but not from SNC rats (Fig. 3B,C). These data suggest that skeletal muscle autophagic flux

is compromised/impaired in a model of neurogenic myopathy in rats. Moreover, we evaluated protein levels of 
ULK1 (Unc-51-like kinases 1) – a protein that governs autophagosome formation29. Further supporting auto-
phagy suppression, SNC rats presented increased phosphorylation of ULK1 at Serine 757, a residue targeted by 
mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1), which impairs autophagy30. No changes were observed 
in the phosphorylation of Serine 555, an ULK1 residue that activates autophagy31 (Fig. 3D).
SNC rats submitted to chronic inhibition of mTORC1 (I.P. injections of rapamycin 1.5 mg.kg−
1.day−
1 for 14 
days) displayed decreased levels of phospho-ULK1Ser757 along with lower levels of polyubiquitinated proteins 
and the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP when compared to SNC-saline treated animals (see Supplementary Fig. S1). 
Decreased levels of phospho-S6Ser235 and phospho-4EBP1Ser65, associated with less incorporation of puromycin, 
confirmed the effectiveness of the in vivo rapamycin treatment-induced mTORC1 inhibition in SNC rats (see 
Supplementary Fig. S1). These findings reinforce the hypothesis that constitutive mTORC1 activation contributes 
to autophagy suppression in skeletal muscle weakness/wasting. However, we cannot exclude the possible role of 
mTORC1 in other downstream effectors32 that regulate proteostasis and skeletal myopathy.
Considering that proteostasis is regulated by both protein synthesis and degradation, we next decided to 
investigate the protein synthesis profile in skeletal muscle from SNC and Control rats. Skeletal muscle atro-
phy and dysfunction in SNC rats were followed by increased total and phosphorylated levels of protein 
synthesis-related markers PRAS40, phospho-PRAS40Thr246, Akt and phospho-AktSer473 (Fig. 4A,D). Moreover, 
we detected increased levels of protein synthesis downstream effectors S6, phospho-S6Ser235, phospho-4EBP1ser65 
and eiF4E in SNC rats compared to Controls (Fig. 4B,D). Next, to understand whether elevated levels of pro-
tein synthesis-related markers reflected into newly synthesized proteins in skeletal muscle from SNC rats, we 
measured protein synthesis using the in vivo incorporation of puromycin – SUnSET method. In fact, puromycin 
incorporation into skeletal muscle was elevated by about 50% in SNC rats compared with Controls (Fig. 4C,D). 
Overall, these findings demonstrate that proteostasis imbalance is characterized by increased protein synthesis 
and reduced autophagy-mediated protein degradation in neurogenic myopathy.
Chronic autophagy disruption reduces skeletal muscle strength in sham animals. 
Next, we 
decided to evaluate whether chronic inhibition of autophagy is sufficient to impair skeletal muscle contractile 
properties and/or trophism. Autophagy was chronically inhibited by treating Control (sham) and SNC rats daily 
with chloroquine (50 mg.kg−
1.day−
1) for 14 days (Fig. 5A). As expected, sustained chloroquine inhibition resulted 
in a 5- and 7-fold increase in LC3-II:I ratio and LC3-II levels, respectively, in skeletal muscle from control ani-
mals; therefore confirming the effectiveness of our treatment (Fig. 5B–D). Treatment of SNC animals with chlo-
roquine resulted in a mild increase of LC3-II:I ratio and LC3-II levels in skeletal muscle (~2-fold, Fig. 5B–D). 
According to the Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays monitoring autophagy26, this increase in LC3-II

levels after chronic treatment with chloroquine does not reflect the autophagic flux. Additionally, chronic chloro-
quine treatment induced an accumulation of p62 in Control group, but not in SNC (Fig. 5B,E).
Chronic pharmacological inhibition of autophagy was able to reduce ex vivo skeletal muscle contractility 
properties (Fig. 5F) without affecting trophism (Fig. 5G,H) in Control rats. Chloroquine treatment did not aggra-
vate skeletal muscle wasting or dysfunctional contractile properties in SNC rats when compared to non-treated 
SNC group (Fig. 5F–H). Considering that chloroquine blocks not only autophagy, but the whole lysosomal deg-
radation pathway, we decided to validate these findings using Atg7 KO mice. Muscle specific deletion of Atg7 was 
sufficient to reduce muscle contractility properties in Control but not in SNC mice, without affecting trophism 
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These findings using pharmacological inhibition (chloroquine) and genetic disruption 
(Atg7 KO mice) of autophagy reinforce the critical role of autophagy in regulating skeletal muscle contractility 
properties and suggest that autophagy is already compromised in a model of neurogenic myopathy in rats.

Exercise training activates autophagy and improves proteostasis in neurogenic myopa-
thy. 
Considering that autophagy is impaired in neurogenic myopathy, we next set out to determine whether 
the re-establishment of autophagic flux is sufficient to improve skeletal muscle proteostasis and counteract 
SNC-induced skeletal muscle damage. We have recently demonstrated that exercise training is able to restore 
the autophagic flux in failing hearts contributing to better disease prognosis21. To evaluate the effects of exercise 
training in autophagy in a model of neurogenic myopathy, rats were submitted to 4 weeks of moderate running 
training on a treadmill prior to SNC surgery. Skeletal muscle trophism, function, autophagy and proteostasis were 
evaluated 14 days after surgery in sedentary (Sed-SNC) and trained SNC (ET-SNC) rats (Fig. 6A).
We demonstrated that 4 weeks of exercise training was sufficient to improve aerobic capacity (Fig. 6B). To test 
the effectiveness of exercise training in activating skeletal muscle autophagy we performed an ex vivo autophagic 
flux assay. Exercise increased skeletal muscle responsiveness to acute chloroquine treatment in SNC rats, depicted

of maximal aerobic capacity. After this period rats were submitted to SNC, and 14 days after surgery skeletal 
muscle morphological, functional and biochemical parameters were measured in Sed-SNC and ET-SNC rats.

here by a chloroquine-induced increase in LC3-II:I ratio and an accumulation of both LC3-II and p62 when 
compared to non-exercised SNC group (Fig. 6C). These findings provide evidence that 4 weeks of exercise prior 
to SNC is sufficient to increase autophagic flux in a rat model of neurogenic myopathy.
Activation of autophagy was associated with reduced levels of skeletal muscle LC3-II (Fig. 6D,H), polyubiq-
uitinated and carbonylated proteins in exercised SNC animals compared to sedentary group (Fig. 6F,H). These 
changes in proteostasis were followed by reduced cellular stress in skeletal muscle, depicted here by decreased 
levels of chaperones α
β
-crystallin, HSP27 and HSP90 (Fig. 6E,H) as well as decreased levels of cleaved caspase 3 
(a pro-apoptotic related marker), and increased levels of BCL2 (an anti-apoptotic related marker) (Fig. 6G,H), in 
exercised animals compared with sedentary group 14 days after SNC. Finally, we provided evidence that increased 
skeletal muscle autophagic flux and proteostasis induced by exercise training was accompanied by better ex vivo 
skeletal muscle contractile properties (Fig. 7A,B) as well as increased skeletal muscle fiber CSA compared to sed-
entary SNC animals (Fig. 7C–E).
Discussion
Maintenance of skeletal muscle functionality is critical for healthy ageing and has a positive impact on qual-
ity of life and survival in many degenerative diseases18. However, the spectrum of pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological interventions capable of protecting skeletal muscle is still limited. Therefore, identifying 
cellular and molecular mechanisms that counteract skeletal myopathy/dysfunction must be extensively studied.
Here, using an in vivo model of neurogenic myopathy, we provided evidence that dysfunctional/atrophic mus-
cles exhibit impaired proteostasis, characterized by accumulation of damaged and stress-related proteins. Theses

changes were associated with an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation, depicted by increased 
protein synthesis and reduced autophagic flux. Further supporting an autophagic mechanism for impaired skel-
etal muscle functionality, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy was sufficient to reduced skeletal muscle con-
tractility properties in Control animals. Finally, we demonstrated that exercise training improved skeletal muscle 
autophagic flux and proteostasis in neurogenic myopathy, which was associated with spared muscle mass and 
better contractility properties.
Skeletal muscle degeneration is commonly associated with impaired protein synthesis and excessive protein 
degradation; therefore resulting in muscle atrophy with impact on contractile properties33. Here, we observed 
that chronic neurogenic myopathy is paradoxically characterized by increased protein synthesis 14 days after 
muscle denervation. Elevated protein synthesis has been previously reported in an acute model of skeletal muscle 
denervation, which was associated with the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass34. The elevation in protein syn-
thesis seems to be a compensatory mechanism to counteract the excessive muscle loss in neurogenic myopathy. 
However, the mechanisms related to this process as well as its contribution in maintaining skeletal muscle mass 
and functionality in chronic degenerative diseases are still elusive.
Excessive protein degradation is a hallmark of skeletal muscle atrophy3,35–40. Different genetic and pharma-
cological interventions that counteract exacerbated proteolysis seem to be sufficient to protect against muscle 
atrophy in preclinical studies37,41–43. However, it is expected that uncontrolled inhibition of proteolysis causes 
proteotoxicity, an adverse effect that can impair muscle contractility properties in the mid-to-long term44. In fact, 
we and others have demonstrated that inhibition of proteolysis results in increased cardiotoxicity in both rodents7 
and humans45. Moreover, genetic inclusion body myopathy, which is a severe proteinopathy, causes a progressive 
skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy in both rodents and humans17. Therefore, the maintenance of proteosta-
sis through different interdependent systems ultimately dictates cell and tissue viability. A sustained disruption 
in protein homeostasis caused by impaired protein degradation and consequent accumulation of dysfunctional 
proteins is sufficient to trigger cell death6,7. We recently reported that improving the turnover of toxic misfolded 
proteins7,20,46–48, as well as mal-functioning organelles21 results in better cardiac outcome during degenerative 
processes.
It is well known that autophagy plays a critical role in the clearance of damaged proteins, therefore affecting 
skeletal muscle physiology49. Evidence supporting the detrimental role of dysfunctional autophagy in skeletal 
muscle pathophysiology emerged from biochemical, functional and ultrastructural analysis in muscle-specific 
autophagy-deficient mice. Two different groups independently demonstrated that genetic disruption of auto-
phagic flux contributes to myofiber degeneration and skeletal muscle weakness in rodents15,50. Moreover, skeletal 
muscle autophagy is suppressed in acute denervation34. Here, we provide evidence that skeletal muscle accu-
mulation of dysfunctional/cytotoxic proteins occurs in parallel to impaired autophagy in chronic neurogenic 
myopathy. Indeed, sustained inhibition of autophagy using chloroquine, a chemical compound that neutralizes 
lysosomal pH, is sufficient to impair skeletal muscle contractility properties in control but not in neurogenic 
myopathy animals. Together, these data suggest that loss of autophagic flux plays a detrimental role in the main-
tenance of skeletal muscle protein homeostasis, which contributes to the pathophysiology of chronic neurogenic 
myopathy. In fact, genetic diseases characterized by impaired autophagy and proteinopathy commonly causes 
severe skeletal myopathy5,17.
Restoring skeletal muscle autophagy ameliorates the dystrophic phenotype in a variety of conditions14,49,51–54. 
Exercise has been used as a non-pharmacological intervention capable of activating autophagy (acutely and 
chronically) in different tissues21,55,56. Although the contribution of skeletal muscle autophagy to exercise per-
formance is still controversial23,57,58, exercise-induced autophagy in degenerative diseases plays a critical role in 
facilitating the turnover of damaged proteins and dysfunctional organelles (i.e. mitochondria)21,59. Here, we found 
that 4 weeks of exercise training, starting prior to SNC surgery as a preventive intervention, was sufficient to 
improve skeletal muscle autophagic flux, which was associated with reduced levels of dysfunctional/cytotoxic pro-
tein and markers of apoptosis in chronic neurogenic myopathy. Overall, these changes contributed to the main-
tenance of skeletal muscle protein homeostasis, which partially affected muscle trophism and contractility. These 
data indicate that autophagic flux is unlikely the only factor that affects neurogenic myopathy. In fact, our data 
using chronic chloroquine treatment provide evidence that autophagy reduced muscle force in a lower magnitude 
in control animals comparing with untreated SNC rats. Despite of autophagy contribution to skeletal myopathy, 
its degenerative process is associated with other intracellular events such as impaired calcium handling, redox 
status and mitochondrial metabolism, which are positively affected by exercise60–64. In conclusion, our findings 
suggest that skeletal muscle protein homeostasis is impaired in an animal model of chronic neurogenic myopathy, 
most likely resulting from defective autophagy. Our data also suggest that exercise training may become a useful 
strategy to prevent disruption of skeletal muscle proteostasis in chronic neurogenic myopathy.
Materials and Methods
Study Design. 
 (1) A cohort of male Sprague-Dawley rats was submitted to SNC or equal procedure without ligation of the 
sciatic nerve (sham surgery – Control group). In order to follow the SNC-induced skeletal muscle atrophy, 
morphological, functional and biochemical parameters were evaluated in skeletal muscle 2, 7 and 14 days 
after surgery (Figs 1 and 2). At the end of the experimental protocol, protein degradation and protein syn-
thesis were assessed in Control and SNC rats (Figs 3 and 4).
 (2) Rats were submitted to sham or SNC surgery and randomly assigned into saline or chloroquine (CHQ) 
treatment groups. To inhibit autophagy in vivo, rats were treated daily for 14 days with I.P. injections of 
CHQ (50 mg.kg−
1.day−
1). At the end of experimental protocol, skeletal muscle morphological, functional 
and biochemical analyses were performed in Control, Control + CHQ, SNC and SNC + CHQ rats (Fig. 5).

 (3) Rats were randomly assigned into sedentary (Sed) and exercise training (ET) groups. ET rats were submit-
ted to running on a treadmill over 4 weeks, 5 days per week, 60 minutes per day at 60% of maximal aerobic 
capacity. After this period, animals were submitted to SNC, and 14 days after surgery skeletal muscle mor-
phological, functional and biochemical parameters were measured in Sed-SNC and ET-SNC rats (Figs 6 
and 7).
Animal care and use. 
A cohort of male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) was selected for the study. Rats 
were maintained in a 12:12 h light-dark cycle and temperature-controlled environment (22 °C) with free access 
to standard laboratory chow and tap water. At the end of protocol, 14 days after sham or SNC surgery rats were 
anaesthetized using isoflurane [4% (v/v) induction, 3% (v/v) maintenance] and killed by decapitation. The animal 
care and protocols in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of Institute of Biomedical 
Sciences of University of Sao Paulo (2012/142/135/02), and were performed in compliance with the National 
Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Sciatic nerve constriction (SNC) surgery. 
For induction of skeletal muscle atrophy, SNC was performed 
as previously described65. Rats were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (50 mg.kg−
1) and xylazine (10 mg.
kg−
1) and both corneal and toepinch reflex were tested to ensure the adequate depth of anesthesia has been 
attained. A 0.5-cm incision at middle thigh level on the lateral side of the right hindlimb was made and after 
blunt dissection through the biceps femoris, the sciatic nerve was lifted out with surgical forceps and four lig-
atures (4.0 chromic gut) were tied loosely around it. The suture thread causes nerve compression and triggers 
an immune response causing intraneural edema, effectively axotomizing many but not all of the nerve axons 
(Wallerian degeneration). This impaired neural input severely compromises skeletal muscle mass and function. 
Surgery with equal procedure duration to that of SNC group, but without sciatic nerve ligation, was undertaken 
in the Control group (sham-operated).
Chloroquine treatment. 
In order to inhibit the autophagy machinery, rats were treated during 14 days 
with daily I.P. injections containing chloroquine (50 mg.kg−
1). A similar volume of saline was injected as control.
Graded treadmill exercise test. 
Animals from Study 3 were submitted to graded exercise testing on a 
motor treadmill adapted to experimental models before and after the experimental period. After being adapted 
to treadmill exercises and the test environment for over one week (10 minutes each session), rats were placed in 
the treadmill streak and allowed to acclimatize for at least 30 minutes. Treadmill speed started at 6 m.min−
1 and 
was increased by 3 m.min−
1 every 3 minutes at 0% grade until exhaustion, where rat could no longer maintain 
running speed over 3 minutes. This test provided the total distance run and peak workload was measured at the 
termination of the test66.
Exercise training protocol. 
ET + SNC rats performed moderated-intensity running training on a motor 
treadmill over 4 weeks, 5 days per week, 60 minutes per day prior to SNC. Running speed and duration of exercise 
were progressively increased to elicit 60% of maximal speed (corresponding to the maximal lactate steady state 
workload) at the second week of training66.
Measurement of autophagic flux. 
In Vivo. Autophagic flux was measured in vivo as described else-
where27. Control and SNC rats were treated 48 hours before the sacrifice with I.P. injections containing colchi-
cine (0.4 mg kg−
1). The differences in LC3-II:I ratio, LC3-II and p62 protein levels with and without colchicine 
– assessed in plantaris muscle by Western Blotting, were used to calculate the autophagic flux. LC3-II:I ratio was 
expressed as a percentage of Control group and LC3-II and p62 levels were expressed as a percentage of each 
group without colchicine (arbitrarily set as 100%).
Ex Vivo. Autophagic flux was measured ex vivo using a modified protocol67,68. At the end of the protocol, rats 
were sacrificed and plantaris muscle was dissected in small chunks. The small chunks were minced finely and 
then divided between two wells (with or without chloroquine – 100 μ
g.mL−
1) and then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. 
The differences in LC3-II:I ratio, LC3-II and p62 protein levels with and without chloroquine – assessed in small 
plantaris chunks by Western Blotting, were used to calculate the autophagic flux. LC3-II:I ratio was expressed 
as a percentage of Control group and LC3-II and p62 levels were expressed as percentage of each group without 
chloroquine (arbitrarily set as 100%).
Ex vivo skeletal muscle function. 
Contractile properties of the fast-twitch EDL muscles were evaluated 
ex vivo as previously described69. Briefly, the entire operated hindlimb was removed, the EDL muscle was then 
carefully isolated and transferred to a temperature-controlled organ bath containing 20 mL of Tyrode solution 
(137 mM NaCl; 24 mM NaHCO3; 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 11 mM glucose, pH 7.4) 
at 25 °C bubbled continuously with carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2). The distal tendon was tied to a holder fixed 
in the organ bath and the proximal tendon was attached to a force transducer (Grass Instruments model FT03, 
USA). After being mounted, muscle optimal length (L0) was determined from micromanipulations of muscle 
length and a series of isometric twitch contractions. The muscles were stimulated to contract isometrically using 
electrical field stimulation (Grass Instruments S-88 Grass-stimulator) delivered via two platinum wire electrodes. 
The output of the force transducer was recorded and analyzed using a PowerLab system (AD Instruments, USA). 
To define force-frequency characteristics, we measured force in response to stimulus frequencies of 1, 10, 20, 
30, 50, 80, 100 and 150 hertz every 3 minutes. Forces are expressed in grams and normalized by the EDL weight.

Skeletal Muscle Morphology (CSA). 
To evaluate muscle atrophy, fast-twitch plantaris muscle was excised, 
snap frozen in melting isopentane and stored in liquid nitrogen. Muscles were vertically mounted at L0 length 
in fixed bases and serially sectioned in cryostat (10 µm sections). Sections were submitted to Hematoxylin-eosin 
staining for examination by light microscopy. To determine myofiber CSA (µm2), images were evaluated at 200 
magnification and analyzed by a digitalizing unit connected to a computer (Image Pro-Plus, NHI, USA). A total 
of approximately 400 myofibers per muscle was measured. A single observer, who was blinded to animal identity, 
conducted all analyses.
Protein synthesis measurement. 
Protein synthesis was measured in vivo in rats using the SUnSET 
method as previously described70. Exactly 30 minutes before the plantaris muscles were excised, mice were given 
an I.P. injection of puromycin (0.04 μ
mol.g−
1) dissolved in 100 μ
l of phosphate buffered saline. Skeletal muscle 
puromycin levels were detected by Western Blotting and expressed as percentage of Control group (arbitrarily 
set as 100%).
Skeletal muscle protein levels (western blotting). 
Protein levels were measured by western blotting in 
total lysate from plantaris muscle. Briefly, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in polyacrylamide gels (6–15%) 
depending upon protein molecular weight. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to PVDF mem-
branes. Equal gel loading and transfer efficiency were monitored using 0.5% Ponceau S staining of blot membrane. 
Blotted membrane was then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk T-TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 
and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 hours at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibod-
ies against polyubiquitinated conjugates, α
β
-crystallin, HSP27, HSP90, BCL-2, caspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, Atg3, 
Beclin-1, LC3, p62/SQSTM1, ULK1, phospho-ULK1Ser757, phospho-ULK1Ser555, PRAS40, phospho-PRAS-40Thr246, 
Akt, phospho-AktSer473, GSK3β
, phospho-GSK3β
Ser9, S6K1, phospho-S6K1Thr389, 4EBP1, phospho-4EBP1Ser65, 
eIF4E and IRS-1. Binding of the primary antibody was detected with the use of peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (rabbit, mouse or goat, depending on the protein, for 2 hours at room temperature) and developed 
using enhanced chemiluminescence detected by autoradiography. Quantification analysis of blots was performed 
with the use of Scion Image software (Scion based on NIH image). Results were corrected to Ponceau red staining 
(0.5%, w:v) of the membrane and expressed as percentage of Control or Sed-SNC groups (arbitrarily set as 100%).
Misfolded protein levels. 
Upon conformational changes, misfolded proteins acquire a motif known as 
the beta-sheet and often expose beta-strand oligomers. This new structure confers ability to self-assemble with 
other misfolded proteins (protein aggregation)71,72. Beta-strand (cellular soluble) oligomers can be recognized by 
an antibody in a manner that is independent of amino acid sequence72. Briefly, to assess the levels of misfolded 
proteins, 25 μ
g of plantaris muscle protein samples were slot-blotted onto PVDF membrane using a Minifold II 
slot blot apparatus. The membranes were washed 3X with T-TBS and then blocked for 1 hour in 5% nonfat dry 
milk T-TBS. After blocking, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-soluble oligomer. Blots were then 
incubated with a secondary anti-IgG rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase for 2 hours. Protein slots 
were visualized and quantified using the Scion Image software. Results were corrected to Ponceau red staining 
(0.5%, w:v) of the membrane and expressed as percentage of Control group (arbitrarily set as 100%).
Carbonylated protein levels. 
Protein carbonylation was assessed by measuring the levels of carbonyl 
groups using the OxyBlot Protein Detection Kit from Millipore, as previously described73. Briefly, 20 μ
g of soluble 
proteins were denatured by 6% SDS (w:v) and the carbonyl groups in the protein side chains were derivatized 
to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). The reaction was 
stopped and the skeletal muscle protein carbonylation was detected by Western Blotting, quantified in the broad-
est molecular weight range as possible and expressed as percentage of Control or Sed-SNC groups (arbitrarily set 
as 100%).
Statistical analysis. 
Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data normality was 
assessed through Shapiro-Wilk’s test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze data from 
Figs 1, 2, 6 and 7. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze data from Fig. 5. Whenever significant F-values were 
obtained, Duncan’s adjustment was used for multiple comparison purposes. Student t test was used to ana-
lyze data from Figs 3 and 4. Statistical significance was considered achieved when the value of P was < 0.05. 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied in order to test differences between groups in Figs 1C and 7C.
