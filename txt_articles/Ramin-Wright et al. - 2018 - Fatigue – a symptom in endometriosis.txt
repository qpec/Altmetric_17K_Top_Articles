STUDY QUESTION: Is fatigue a frequent symptom of endometriosis?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Fatigue is an underestimated symptom of endometriosis as it affects the majority of women with endometriosis,
but it is not widely discussed in literature.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fatigue can be a symptom of endometriosis causing major distress impacting the daily activities and qual-
ity of life of women with endometriosis. However, few studies with large sample sizes have investigated fatigue as a symptom of
endometriosis.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was designed as a multi-center matched case–control study. Recruitment took place at
hospitals and private practices in Switzerland, Germany and Austria between 2010 and 2016. Data was collected from 1120 women, 560 of
them with endometriosis. The women with endometriosis were matched to 560 control women in regard to age ±3 years and ethnic
background.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Diagnosis of women with endometriosis had to be surgically and histologically
confirmed. Surgical exclusion or absence of any endometriosis-identifying symptoms was required for control subjects. Materials included sur-
gical and histological reports as well as data retrieved from a self-administered questionnaire. This study focused on the symptom fatigue in
endometriosis. Relationships of variables were established by regression analysis and associations were quantified as odds ratios.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Frequent fatigue was experienced by a majority of women diagnosed with endometri-
osis (50.7% versus 22.4% in control women, P < 0.001). Fatigue in endometriosis was associated with insomnia (OR: 7.31, CI: 4.62–11.56,
P < 0.001), depression (OR: 4.45, CI: 2.76–7.19, P < 0.001), pain (OR: 2.22, CI: 1.52–3.23, P < 0.001), and occupational stress (OR: 1.45,
CI: 1.02–2.07, P = 0.037), but was independent of age, time since first diagnosis and stage of the disease.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Women with asymptomatic endometriosis cannot be excluded in the control group which
would lead to underestimation of our results. The study’s design allows no evaluation of causal effects.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As fatigue is experienced by numerous women with endometriosis, it needs to be
addressed in the discussion of management and treatment of the disease. In addition to treating endometriosis, it would be beneficial to
reduce insomnia, depression, pain and occupational stress in order to better manage fatigue.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): There was no additional funding received for this study and no conflict of interest.

 Introduction
Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition affecting about
8–10% of women of reproductive age (Acién and Velasco, 2013).
Endometriosis is considered a chronic and progressive condition
(Huntington and Gilmour, 2005). Symptoms of endometriosis are
mainly dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, infertility and deep dyspar-
eunia (Bellelis et al., 2010). Furthermore, endometriosis is a risk factor
for miscarriages (Kohl Schwartz et al., 2017). These symptoms nega-
tively impact the quality of life, as well as the physical and mental health
status, and productivity at work (Fourquet et al., 2011; Hämmerli
et al., 2018). Depression is a frequent comorbidity (Chen et al., 2016)
and the prevalence of depression is especially high in women with
endometriosis experiencing pain (Pope et al., 2015).
However, it has been shown that fatigue is one of the most intense
and frequent symptoms (Hansen et al., 2013; Touboul et al., 2013) as
well as the symptom with highest associated distress (Lemaire, 2004).
The prevalence of fatigue is significantly higher in patients with endo-
metriosis compared to the general female population (Sinaii et al.,
2002). Conversely, women with chronic fatigue syndrome often
report endometriosis in their gynecological history (Boneva et al.,
2011). In addition, patients with endometriosis suffer more often from
stress (Hansen et al., 2013; van Aken et al., 2018). The impact of
fatigue is vast as women’s educational performance is affected as well
as playing sports and social activities (Gilmour et al., 2008; Moradi
et al., 2014).
Although chronic fatigue is mentioned as one of the most debilitating
symptoms of endometriosis, it is not widely known and discussed as
such (Riazi et al., 2015). Large studies addressing endometriosis-
related symptoms do not systematically evaluate fatigue (Ballard et al.,
2008; Bellelis et al., 2010; Abbas et al., 2011) and only few studies with
a large sample size of more than 1000 study participants reference
fatigue as a symptom of endometriosis (Sinaii et al., 2002; Ballweg,
2004; Hansen et al., 2013).
The aim of this study was to (i) investigate the prevalence of fatigue
in women diagnosed with endometriosis compared to an unaffected
control group and to (ii) evaluate the confounding effects of endomet-
riosis, pain, BMI, insomnia, depression, motherhood and stress on
fatigue.
Materials and Methods
Study design
The study was designed as a multi-center a cross-sectional study investigat-
ing the quality of life in women with endometriosis. This analysis compared
fatigue in a cohort of endometriosis patients to a cohort of non-
endometriosis patients with a focus on prevalences and confounders of
fatigue. Outcome was the prevalence of fatigue.
Data collection
Study participants were recruited from different university hospitals, dis-
trict hospitals and associated private practices in Switzerland, Germany
and Austria, as well as from endometriosis self-help groups in Germany.
Most of the data was collected from the University Hospital Zurich, the
Triemli Hospital Zurich, the district hospitals in Winterthur, Schaffhausen,
St. Gallen, Baden, Solothurn, and Walenstadt, the Charité Berlin, the
University Hospital Aachen, the Albertinen-Hospital Hamburg, the
Vivantes Humboldt-Klinikum Berlin and the University Hospital Graz.
Women were approached by medical staff and received information about
study participation. After verbal consent, the patients were given additional
written information, a questionnaire, a consent form for study participa-
tion, and a consent form for confirmation of diagnosis along with a return
envelope. In the endometriotic group, the context for consultation was
either a post-operative follow-up or a regular check-up monitoring the dis-
ease progression. Women of the control group were recruited during their
annual check-up or during hospital stays for temporary mild, benign gyne-
cological procedures (for example laparoscopic removal of a benign ovar-
ian cyst) if they met inclusion criteria.
Sample size
A sample size of 387 participants in each group is needed to detect a 10%
difference between cases and controls with an alpha of 0.05 and a power
of 0.8. As the present study is part of a larger study also including outcome
measures where we expected smaller differences, we decided on a sample
size of a minimum of 550 study participants in both groups.
Inclusion criteria
Women with surgically and histologically confirmed endometriosis were
included in the study regardless of their disease symptoms. Eligible for the
control group were only women that showed no pelvic pain or where
endometrioses had been surgically excluded by laparoscopy or laparot-
omy. However, women with other pain than pelvic pain could still be
included in the control group. The diagnosis of endometriosis was con-
firmed and classified using the revised American Society for Reproductive
Medicine (rASRM) classification. To be included, women had to be in suffi-
cient command of the language and demonstrate the psychological ability
to understand and respond to the given questionnaire. Pregnancy at the
time of inclusion was an exclusion criterion for both groups. Data was
included when at least 80% of questions relevant for the present evaluation
had been answered. Following these criteria, data from 1120 women was
available for fatigue evaluation, 560 women with endometriosis and 560
pair-matched women without endometriosis. The women’s age ranges
from 18 to 59. Age ±3 years and ethnic background were used as match-
ing criteria.
Questionnaire and definitions
The self-administered questionnaire contains questions pertaining to a var-
iety of factors related to quality of life, including factors associated with
endometriosis. Along with questions regarding age, nationality and socio-
economic background, the questionnaire addresses questions about the
gynecological history, pre-existing health conditions, chronic pain, family
history, pregnancy, partnership, sex life, life style and psychological disor-
ders. The questionnaire was developed by endometriosis and psycho-
somatic specialists from the universities of Zurich and Berlin as well as
leading board members of endometriosis self-help groups. The study was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 02511626) where further details on
the complete questionnaire are available. All data was encrypted and
entered into an Access database.
The extent of fatigue and insomnia was categorized into five different
levels (1 = never to 5 = very often). Study participants had to answer
based on their experiences in the previous 6 months. Furthermore,
women were asked to rate their current occupational stress (0 = no stress
to 10 = major stress). Moreover, pain was investigated in both groups
using questions from the Brief Pain Inventory and the Pain Disability Index.
Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
and classified as a score ≥10 (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002).

 The body-mass-index categorizes underweight, overweight and obesity
(World Health Organization, 2006). The formula is: BMI = kg/m2. A body
mass index equal or greater to 25 is classified as overweight. Therefore, a
high BMI in our analysis corresponds to a BMI greater than 24.9.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using the statistical software JMP,
Version 13. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. Results are shown as abso-
lute numbers (n), percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Descriptive
statistics quantitatively summarize observations made during analysis.
Significance of differences in categorical data was tested for using the chi-
squared test. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were performed to
analyze the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
Associations were quantified as odds ratios and adjusted for confounding
factors. Confounders were chosen a priori based on our prior knowledge
from existing literature which exposed a relation between endometriosis,
chronic pain, and fatigue (Dunselman et al., 2014), an association between
a high BMI and fatigue (Jarosz et al., 2014), and a relation between child
and parent sleep patterns (Meltzer and Montgomery-Downs, 2011).
Further, prior literature presented a higher prevalence of insomnia in
endometriosis patients (Maggiore et al., 2017), a greater risk for developing
a major depression (Chen et al., 2016), and a high prevalence of stress in
women with endometriosis (Hansen et al., 2013). After confounders were
chosen, they were assessed using univariate models. All variables significant
at the 0.1 alpha level in the univariate analysis were included in the multi-
variate analysis.
Ethical approval
All women voluntarily participated in the study and signed an informed
consent. The cantonal ethics committees as well as the ethics committees
of the participating hospitals approved the study. The guidelines of the
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 1964, updated in
October 2013, apply to the study. The STROBE criteria were used to draft
the manuscript (Von Elm et al., 2007).
Results
In total, 560 women with endometriosis and 560 women without
endometriosis were evaluated. An overview of symptoms and condi-
tions experienced by women diagnosed with endometriosis and con-
trol women is shown in Table I. Demographic data is presented in
Table II. Endometriosis characteristics and related fatigue are shown in
Table III. Increasing age was not significantly associated with frequent
fatigue (P = 0.26).
Table IV presents the multivariate analysis of factors associated with
fatigue. Associations between endometriosis stage and fatigue are
shown in Table V. The median time since first diagnosis was 2.6 years
(first quartile: 0.8 years, third quartile: 6.1 years). Time since first diag-
nosis in women experiencing frequent fatigue did not significantly differ
from women experiencing only occasional or rare fatigue (P = 0.13).
An analysis of the association between pain and fatigue can be found
in the supplementary information.
Discussion
In our study, the prevalence of frequent fatigue is more than doubled
in women diagnosed with endometriosis compared to unaffected
control women. Fatigue was associated with endometriosis, pain,
insomnia, depression, and occupational stress. The association
between endometriosis and frequent fatigue remained significant after
controlling for the confounding effects of pain, insomnia, occupational
stress, depression, BMI and motherhood. This finding supports an
independent effect of endometriosis which cannot be attributed to dis-
ease symptoms. Our results show that endometriosis-related fatigue is
a frequent symptom which should be addressed in medical care.
While the current treatment and management of the disease focuses
more on classic symptoms such as pain and infertility (Bernardi and
Pavone, 2013; Dunselman et al., 2014; Vercellini et al., 2014), it is
important to also address fatigue when treating patients with endo-
metriosis. Physical activity reduces pain (Leeners and Imthurn, 2007)
and therefore might be beneficial in endometriosis treatment. As psy-
chological or pharmacological treatments are used to alleviate fatigue
when suffering from other conditions (Acciarresi et al., 2014), they
could be suitable for treating fatigue in endometriosis. Additionally,
these
treatments

improve
depression
and
sleep
disturbances.
We considered multiple factors with an influence on fatigue inde-
pendent of endometriosis. Our regression analysis showed that fatigue
is independent of age. A high BMI is associated with frequent fatigue.
However, other factors such as pain and depression have a greater
influence on fatigue. Our analysis demonstrates that women experien-
cing pain were more affected by fatigue and that pain is highly asso-
ciated with endometriosis. Further, it is important to note that pain
and mood conditions such as depression often occur together in endo-
metriosis (Smorgick et al., 2013; Pope et al., 2015) which is also
reflected in our results. Additionally, depression was associated with
frequent fatigue.
Our study shows that frequent fatigue is strongly associated with fre-
quent insomnia which is experienced more often by endometriosis
patients than controls and supported by other literature (Maggiore
et al., 2017). As child sleep problems have an impact on parent sleep
and daytime functioning (Meltzer and Montgomery-Downs, 2011), we
suspected being a mother to have an impact on the level of fatigue. In
our study, many women with endometriosis are childless, probably
due to infertility being one of the major disease symptoms. After
adjusting for confounders, the association of low fatigue levels and chil-
dren became insignificant, indicating that other factors are more
important in influencing fatigue.
Long-term endometriosis influences the perceived stress level
(Lazzeri et al., 2015) and stress exposure is associated with depression
(Kendler et al., 1999; Vinkers et al., 2014). Both, occupational stress
and depression were experienced more by women with endometri-
osis than controls. Patients with endometriosis using positive coping
strategies suffer less from depression (Donatti et al., 2017) while
avoidance coping styles and passive coping styles are related to poor
mental status and higher pain (Zarbo et al., 2018). Negative coping
strategies have been found to be significant predictors of fatigue
(Nikolaus et al., 2013), therefore, fatigue in endometriosis could be a
result of poor disease coping. Furthermore, inflammation caused by
endometriosis lesions and the activation of the immune system might
be involved in fatigue. Fatigue is a frequent symptom of inflammatory
diseases and a positive correlation between inflammatory cytokines
and fatigue has been shown, suggesting that the immune system with
elevated cytokines could play a role in fatigue symptomology (Bower,
2007; Louati and Berenbaum, 2015). Our analysis shows that high

 occupational stress, as well as depression, is associated with frequent
fatigue. Due to higher stress levels, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal
(HPA) axis is altered in patients with endometriosis (Van Uum et al.,
2008; van Aken et al., 2018). Being chronically exposed to high stress
can result in adrenal fatigue which could be another possible explan-
ation for a relation between endometriosis and fatigue.
Furthermore, our results indicate that fatigue is independent of the
disease stage which differs from previous literature (Ashrafi et al.,
2016). Likewise, the time since first diagnosis does not differ with the
level of fatigue.
Limitations
The data was retrieved from a self-administered questionnaire and
answers on fatigue were based on experiences in the past 6 months.
Therefore, answers, including perception of sleepiness, are subjective
and at risk for recall biases. Whenever possible, questions were based
on prior validated questionnaires. Additional aspects, where no valid-
ated questionnaire was available, were based on clinical experience
and revised by the governing body of the German endometriosis self-
help groups. Furthermore, the study design does not allow to evaluate
causal effects. Additional confounding factors may not have been
included in the statistical analysis as the evaluation focused on endo-
metriosis and did not include every other possible disease which could
potentially influence fatigue. However, such diseases will be present in
both groups. Some of the evaluated answers only reflect a short peri-
od of time and do not necessarily represent a constant condition.

 Medication such as GnRH analogs, progestins, and especially pain kill-
ers likely confound fatigue and related symptoms. Unfortunately, we
have no information on the exact medication taken during the full
period relevant for the present investigation of fatigue. Therefore, the
association between endometriosis and fatigue will partly have to be
attributed to side effects of medication. However, this situation repre-
sents clinical reality where medication always aims for the best possible
compromise between disease symptoms on the one hand and side
effects on the other hand. As a consequence, we assume that our find-
ings represent experiences of women living with the combined symp-
toms of endometriosis and related medication. Stress is limited to
occupational stress since the questionnaire did not ask for general
stress. As some women in the control group might have undiagnosed
endometriosis, differences in fatigue might have been underestimated.
In contrast, exclusion of women with pelvic pain in the control group
might have resulted in overestimation.
Conclusion
To improve the quality of life in women with endometriosis, addres-
sing fatigue should, in addition to chronic pain and infertility, become a
routine part of medical care. Together with the standard treatment of
endometriosis, it would be beneficial to reduce insomnia, pain, depres-
sion and occupational stress in order to better manage fatigue.
