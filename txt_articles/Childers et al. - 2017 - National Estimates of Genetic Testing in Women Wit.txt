Purpose
In the United States, 3.8 million women have a history of breast (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC). Up to
15% of cases are attributable to heritable mutations, which, if identified, provide critical knowledge
for treatment and preventive care. It is unknown how many patients who are at high risk for these
mutations have not been tested and how rates vary by risk criteria.
Methods
We used pooled cross-sectional data from three Cancer Control Modules (2005, 2010, 2015) of the
National Health Interview Survey, a national in-person household interview survey. Eligible patients
were adult females with a history of BC and/or OC meeting select 2017 National Comprehensive
Cancer Network eligibility criteria on the basis of age of diagnosis and family history. Outcomes
included the proportion of individuals reporting a history of discussing genetic testing with a health
professional, being advised to undergo genetic testing, or undergoing genetic testing for BC or OC.
Results
Of 47,218 women, 2.7% had a BC history and 0.4% had an OC history. For BC, 35.6% met one or
more select eligibility criteria; of those, 29.0% discussed, 20.2% were advised to undergo, and
15.3% underwent genetic testing. Testing rates for individual eligibility criteria ranged from 6.2%
(relative with OC) to 18.2% (diagnosis # 45 years of age). For OC, 15.1% discussed, 13.1% were
advised to undergo, and 10.5% underwent testing. Using only four BC eligibility criteria and all
patients with OC, an estimated 1.2 to 1.3 million individuals failed to receive testing.
Conclusion
Fewer than one in five individuals with a history of BC or OC meeting select National Cancer
Comprehensive Network criteria have undergone genetic testing. Most have never discussed
testing with a health care provider. Large national efforts are warranted to address this unmet need.

INTRODUCTION
Up to 10% of breast and 15% of ovarian can-
cers are attributable to hereditable mutations,
most commonly mutations in BRCA1/2.1,2 In the
United States, 316,120 women will be diagnosed
with breast cancer and 22,440 with ovarian can-
cer this year.3 Identifying which of these patients
carries heritable mutations can direct cancer
treatment4,5 and alter surgical decision making.6,7
Recent estimates suggest that rates of genetic testing
in newly diagnosed patients meeting National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) cri-
teria are up to 53%.8
Although patients should undergo genetic
testing at the time of diagnosis, there is likely a large
cohort of breast and ovarian cancer survivors for
whom testing was not offered, pursued, or even
available. Indeed, the number of new diagnoses
this year accounts for less than 10% of the 3.8
million women living with a history of breast or
ovarian cancer.9 Of these women, 70% were di-
agnosed 5 years ago, and half were diagnosed more
than 10 years ago.10 The importance of identifying
heritable mutations extends beyond the initial treat-
ment period, enabling cancer prevention and early
detection for patients and their family members.11
Single-site studies provide some insight into rates of
testing for cancer survivors, with estimates as low as
25% for breast cancer and 10% forovarian cancer,12,13
but it is unknown how often genetic testing is per-
formed at a population level.
This study used a nationally representative
sample to quantify the unmet need for genetic
testing in patients with a history of breast and/or

 ovarian cancer meeting select NCCN eligibility criteria and de-
termined how rates differed across cancer type and risk criteria.
Understanding these deficits can guide policy priorities and in-
form providers about which patients are most at risk for being
overlooked.
METHODS
The data source was the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),
a multistage cross-sectional in-person household interview that gathers
self-reported health data for the civilian noninstitutionalized US pop-
ulation.14 Since 1987, a Cancer Control Module (CCM) has been ad-
ministered approximately every 5 years. This study merged the Person,
Sample Adult, and Sample Adult Cancer files with subsequent pooling of
the 2005, 2010, and 2015 data sets. Pooling increased precision and allowed
assessment of longitudinal trends. Reliable estimates (relative SE , 30%)
were rarely available for subpopulations in individual years.15 The overall
response rate ranged from 70.1% to 86.5%.14,16,17
The population of interest was adult women with a history of breast
and/or ovarian cancer. Although males with a history of breast cancer were
included in NHIS, the population was too small to generate reliable es-
timates. Questions related to genetic encounters were prefaced with the
following phrase: “The following questions refer to genetic testing for
cancer risk. That is, testing your blood to see if you carry genes which may
predict a greater chance of developing cancer at some point in your life.”
Genetic encounters included the proportion of individuals self-reporting
(1) a history of discussing the possibility of getting a genetic test for cancer
risk with a doctor or other health professional (referred to as discussing
hereafter); (2) a history of being advised to undergo a genetic test by a
doctor or other health professional (referred to as advising hereafter); or (3)
a history of having a genetic test to determine future breast/ovarian cancer
risk (referred to as testing hereafter). Responses to (2) required an affirmative
response to (1), whereas responses to (3) were independent of the other two.
Subpopulations were defined using 2017.2 NCCN Genetic/Familial
High-Risk Assessment for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Guidelines.19 The
NHIS Cancer Control Module collects sufficient personal and family
history to evaluate the following eligible breast cancer populations: (1)
diagnosis 45 years of age or younger, (2) diagnosis 50 years of age or
younger with one or more first-degree relatives (FDRs) with breast
cancer, (3) diagnosis at any age with one or more FDRs with breast
cancer 50 years of age or younger, and (4) diagnosis at any age with one
or more FDRs with ovarian cancer. Patients with breast cancer not
meeting one of these criteria were considered eligibility unknown.
NHIS does not collect, and therefore we were unable to estimate rates
for, other testing criteria, including those that rely on cancer diagnoses
in second- or third-degree relatives, multiple primaries, family history
of pancreatic or Gleason score $ 7 prostate cancer, Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry, or triple-negative tumor pathology (Appendix Table A1,
online only). Individuals with breast cancer who met one of these
criteria but did not meet the four available criteria were included in the
eligibility unknown category. All individuals with a history of ovarian
cancer were considered eligible for testing.
STATA software (v14.2; STATA, College Station, TX) was used for all
analyses. Sample weights were divided by 3 to adjust for pooling of
multiple years. Unique identifiers were created for the 2005 strata before
merging with the 2010/2015 data files because of a shift in sample design
periods. Analyses were adjusted for complex survey weights using svy and
subpop commands. SEs were calculated using the Taylor series linearization
method. An alpha of .05 was used for statistical significance.
Data set calibration was assessed by comparing the sample with
summary statistics from the 2000 and 2010 US Census.19a,19b Of 92,257
total survey respondents, 84,746 (92%) had complete data for all three
genetic encounters (discussed, advised, and tested). Covariable means and
proportions were compared for individuals with and without genetic
encounter data using adjusted Wald and x2 tests. Individuals with data
were, on average, 2 years younger than those without data, but were no
different with respect to sex, survey year, or history of breast or ovarian
cancer (Appendix Table A2). All further analysis was conducted on complete
cases, with count estimates scaled to the population with known outcomes.
Encounter rates were calculated for risk pools defined by NCCN criteria and
compared using x2 tests. An estimate for the national unmet need was
generated by multiplying the weighted total number of patients with eligible
breast or ovarian cancer by 1 minus the 95% CI of rate of testing.
RESULTS
Database Calibration and Population Demographics
The data set included 92,257 observations representing
229,926,502 adults in the noninstitutionalized civilian US population.
Age and racial distributions closely approximate estimates from the
2000 and 2010 US Census, with 17.4% of the sample $ 65 years of
age, 14% Hispanic/Latino, and 11.7% non-Hispanic Black (Table 1).
Genetic Encounter Availability and Cancer Prevalence
Of 92,257 survey respondents, 84,746 (92%) had complete
data for all three genetic encounters, including whether the in-
dividual had (1) discussed genetic testing with a health care
provider, (2) been advised to undergo genetic testing, and (3)
undergone genetic testing. Of the individuals with complete
data (referred to as population hereafter), 51.7% were female; of
these, 2.7% had a history of breast cancer, and 0.4% had
a history of ovarian cancer (Table 2).
Identification of Individuals With Breast or Ovarian
Cancer Meeting Eligibility Criteria
For women with a history of breast cancer, four eligibility
criteria, as defined by NCCN guidelines,19 were identified on the

 basis of age of diagnosis and family history of breast and/or ovarian
cancer. Thirty-six percent of individuals with a history of breast
cancer met one or more of the criteria, representing 1,039,232
people (Table 2). Individuals were most likely to meet criteria for
having the diagnosis at 45 years of age or younger (25.0%).
Smaller proportions were eligible because of having $ 1 FDR
diagnosed with breast cancer at 50 years of age or younger
(9.8%), having a personal diagnosis at 50 years of age or younger
with $ 1 FDR with a history of breast cancer (9.1%), and $ 1
FDR with a history of ovarian cancer (3.8%; Table 2). Of in-
dividuals with a history of breast cancer, 64.4% did not meet one
of the four eligibility criteria and were considered eligibility
unknown. All women with a history of ovarian cancer were
considered eligible, representing 449,640 individuals19 (Table 2).
Of eligible patients, 83% met only one criterion, whereas
10%, 6%, and 1% met two, three, and four criteria, respectively
(Appendix Table A3).
Genetic Encounter Rates for Breast Cancer, Stratified by
Risk-Profile
For women with a history of breast cancer meeting one or
more eligibility criteria, outcomes of the pooled sample were as
follows: discussed, 29.0%; advised, 20.2%; and tested, 15.3%. The
rate of testing was 12.1% in 2005/2010 and 20% in 2015. The rate
of testing in individuals with a history of breast cancer who did not
meet any of the eligibility criteria (eligibility unknown) was 7.2%
(Table 2; Fig 1). Of the women with a history of breast cancer who
underwent genetic testing, 54% (SE = 5.4%) met one or more
eligibility criteria.
Genetic Encounter Rates for Breast Cancer, Stratified by
Eligibility Criteria
Stratifying by individual criteria, rates of discussing ranged
from 17.9% ($ 1 FDR with ovarian cancer) to 43.3% (personal
diagnosis at 50 years of age or younger, $ 1 FDR with breast
cancer) and rates of advising ranged from 14.1% ($ 1 FDR with
ovarian cancer) to 24.8% (personal diagnosis at 50 years of age or
younger, $ 1 FDR with breast cancer). Rates of testing ranged from
6.2% ($ 1 FDR with ovarian cancer) to 18.2% (personal diagnosis
at 45 years of age or younger). Because of small samples, the only
reliable estimates over time were in individuals with a diagnosis at
45 years of age or younger, where the rate of testing was 14.7% in
2005/2010 and 23.3% in 2015 (Table 2; Fig 1).
Genetic Encounter Rates for Ovarian Cancer
In women with a history of ovarian cancer, outcome rates for
the pooled sample were as follows: discussed, 15.1%; advised,
13.1%; and tested, 10.5%. Testing rates were 9.7% in 2005/2010
and 11.6% in 2015.

Estimates of Unmet Genetic Testing
 Population Estimates of Untested Individuals Meeting
One or More Eligibility Criteria
In the pooled sample, an estimated 1,471,279 women with
a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer met one or more of the
identifiable eligibility criteria. In this population, the rate of genetic
testing was 13.8% (95% CI, 10.8% to 17.6%). Using only these five
criteria, this generates a population-based estimate of unmet need
of genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer survivors between
1,212,334 and 1,312,381.
DISCUSSION
This study estimates that 1.2 to 1.3 million women with a history of
breast and/or ovarian cancer have not undergone genetic testing
despite evidence-based guidelines supporting this as the standard
of care. This includes 800,000 women with breast cancer and
400,000 women with ovarian cancer. Furthermore, over 70% of
eligible patients with breast cancer and 80% of patients with
ovarian cancer have never discussed genetic testing with a health
care provider.
Although rates of testing are low across the entire study,
ovarian cancer seems to be a particularly unrecognized indication
for genetic testing. NCCN guidelines have recommended genetic
testing for patients with a history of ovarian cancer since at least
2010.20 Previous studies have shown this discrepancy, but the
magnitude of this deficit was not previously known.12,21
The rates of genetic testing in this study population differ
dramatically from recent reports, with estimates of discussing and
testing as high as 71% and 53%, respectively.8 Although some of
this difference may reflect NHIS data being outdated, the rate of
testing in 2015 in this study was still only 20%. Much of this
difference can be attributed to a focus on women with new di-
agnoses, a small fraction of the population that lives with a history
of breast or ovarian cancer. Women with diagnoses 5, 10, or even 20
years ago are likely susceptible to much lower rates of testing due to
a lack of awareness or availability, yet may still benefit significantly
from genetic testing. There are other reasons to believe our esti-
mates are more representative—the NHIS samples from the entire
US noninstitutionalized civilian population, instead of focusing on
academic centers, single or regional (often urban) sites, or unique
populations such as those diagnosed at particularly young ages or
participating in advocacy groups. Furthermore, the in-person
nature of the NHIS may help mitigate the self-selection bias in-
herent in mailed surveys; however, responses are still limited by
self-report and potential recall bias.
Analyzing the steps a patient must take before undergoing
genetic testing can provide insight into the barriers of care.
Seventy-five of every 100 eligible patients with a history of breast or
ovarian cancer have never discussed genetic testing with a health
care provider. An additional seven patients are lost between dis-
cussing and advising, and four more between advising and testing.
These first two gaps (before discussing and between discussing
and advising) reflect a lack of patient identification and perhaps
a lack of provider awareness and knowledge. A number of women
now eligible for testing would not have been identified at the time
of their diagnosis because of the rapid evolution of NCCN guidelines
over the past number of years.19,20 This may also reflect changes in
care; as patients move away from their initial cancer providers, new
providers may overlook these remote histories or may not be aware
of contemporary guidelines. Although most primary care providers
are aware of BRCA mutations, as few as 20% could accurately
identify NCCN guidelines in a 2011 study.22
Previous studies have documented the importance of provider
recommendation on patients’ pursuit of genetic testing8,23 and
have shown a lack of recommendation as the primary reason for
many untested women.8 Thus, it becomes important for all
providers to make note of those with a personal history and inquire
about prior genetic testing. All women with a history of ovarian
cancer should be identified and referred. For breast cancer, three
pieces of information—age at diagnosis, FDR with breast cancer
(with age of diagnosis), and FDR with ovarian cancer—can identify
a large population of women at risk for carrying a heritable gene
mutation. Using these four questions as part of each routine visit
could identify over 1 million women eligible for genetic testing.
The final gap in the continuum is between advising and
testing. This discrepancy may reflect a myriad of health care
challenges, such as availability of providers (including genetic
counselors,24,25 certified advanced practice nurses, and physicians),
out-of-pocket expenses to the patient,26 and patient preference.27
The availability of genetic counselors is especially problematic
and is currently being addressed by the National Society of Ge-
netic Counselors. The American Board of Genetic Counseling lists
approximately 4,000 board-certified genetic counselors (CGCs),
but a 2011 survey suggests that only two thirds of these CGCs
practice in clinical settings (one third work in industry), and only
25% of clinical CGCs specialize in cancer.28 The geographic dis-
tribution of CGCs is not uniform, with 500 located in California,
whereas states such as Missouri, Wyoming, Mississippi, and Alaska
each have five or fewer CGCs. Possible solutions include expanding
the CGC workforce,25 integrating CGCs into multidisciplinary
clinic workflows,29 and the use of telemedicine.30 Education fo-
cused on increasing the number of advanced practice nurses and
physicians who are comfortable initiating genetic testing could also
help alleviate the burden from this overstretched workforce, but
would require that insurers eliminate a recent change to pre-
requisite genetic counseling.31 Although the cost of genetic testing
has decreased significantly over recent years, cost still remains
a barrier for underinsured individuals. Providers and patients
should also be reminded of the numerous provisions that protect
patients from discrimination on the basis of genetic information.32
Given the low testing rate and large impact of identifying
a heritable mutation, aggressive solutions should be considered.
These may include universal testing for women with breast and/
or ovarian cancer or other select populations,33 directed patient
education for self-referral, or modified direct-to-consumer testing.
As the cost of testing continues to decline, there is evidence that
universal screening of adult women older than 30 years of age may
fall below $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.34
Increasing the rate of genetic testing in affected women is
critical to enable subsequent cancer prevention and early detection
in patients and their family members.4-7,11 The ultimate impact of
genetic testing is to identify all individuals at high-risk for cancer
before they are affected to maximize the opportunity for pre-
vention and early detection. This effort will be challenging if we

 cannot first identify affected individuals with hereditary cancer
gene mutations.
This study has several limitations. First, NHIS only collects
self-reported data and is not validated against the medical re-
cord. Recall bias as it relates to advising, discussing, and testing
are all possible and are likely magnified as patients become more
removed from their treatment. Patients may confuse other
pathologies with cancer diagnoses or report inaccurate ages at
diagnosis for themselves or their relatives. Second, survivorship
bias may result in under-representation of aggressive tumor
pathologies, such as triple-negative breast cancer or epithelial
ovarian cancer. Third, low event rates and small subpopulations
limit precision. Pooling data improve these estimates but at the
expense of information being outdated. Fourth, NHIS only
collects data to estimate four eligible breast cancer sub-
populations, whereas NCCN outlines over a dozen (Appendix
Table A1). Patients who would have otherwise met criteria (eg, if
their eligibility was dependent on second- or third-degree
relatives) would be included in our eligibility unknown pop-
ulation. To our knowledge, an empirical estimate of the sig-
nificance of this is not available. However, studies suggest that
age at diagnosis and family history of breast and ovarian cancer
account for the majority of all eligible individuals.29,35 Further
support that these limited criteria capture the majority of eli-
gible women is the comparability between the proportion of
individuals eligible in our study with recent studies with access
to more granular data36 and the significant difference in rates of
testing between our eligible patients with breast cancer (15.3%)
and the eligibility unknown patients (7.2%). Given this lower
rate in the eligibility unknown patients, if additional criteria
expanded the pool, our estimate for the number of patients
needing testing would actually increase, suggesting our esti-
mates are conservative.
Future research should focus on understanding the charac-
teristics of the eligible population that has not been tested, with an
emphasis on measures of access to care. Further research should
also assess the patient and provider factors that contribute to
decreasing rates of patients discussing, being advised to undergo,
and actually undergoing genetic testing.
In conclusion, in a nationally representative sample, fewer
than one in five women with a history of breast and/or ovarian
cancer meeting select NCCN eligibility criteria have undergone
genetic testing. This represents a deficit of 1.2 to 1.3 million
women. Most women meeting criteria have never even discussed
genetic testing with a health care provider. Large national efforts
are needed to address this unmet need.
