Synchronous colorectal cancers (syCRCs) are physically separated tumours that develop
simultaneously. To understand how the genetic and environmental background influences the
development of multiple tumours, here we conduct a comparative analysis of 20 syCRCs
from 10 patients. We show that syCRCs have independent genetic origins, acquire dissimilar
somatic alterations, and have different clone composition. This inter- and intratumour
heterogeneity must be considered in the selection of therapy and in the monitoring of
resistance. SyCRC patients show a higher occurrence of inherited damaging mutations in
immune-related genes compared to patients with solitary colorectal cancer and to healthy
individuals from the 1,000 Genomes Project. Moreover, they have a different composition of
immune cell populations in tumour and normal mucosa, and transcriptional differences in
immune-related biological processes. This suggests an environmental field effect that
promotes multiple tumours likely in the background of inflammation.

 S
everal large-scale sequencing projects have extensively
characterized the genomic landscape of colorectal cancer
(CRC)1–4. Despite all efforts, several questions still remain
unaddressed. For instance, around 2–5% of CRC patients present
multiple primary tumours at initial diagnosis5–7 (synchronous
CRC (syCRC)) but the causes of multiple tumours are still
poorly understood. Patients with Lynch syndrome and familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have a higher incidence of
syCRC8–10. Similarly, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and
hyperplastic polyposis are known to predispose to synchronous
tumours10–12. These conditions, however, only account for
around 10% of syCRC8, thus suggesting that other predisposing
causes likely exist7,13. Recently, a homozygous mutation in the
base-excision repair gene NTHL1 has been associated with the
onset of multiple colorectal adenomas in Dutch families14, but
this mutation is absent in other affected individuals. In addition
to the predisposing factors, it is uncertain whether paired
tumours of a patient share the same genetic origin and acquire
similar somatic alterations. In other words, whether genetic or
environmental field effects influence the way syCRCs originate
and develop. Comparative analyses of syCRCs have so far
focussed mostly on mutation hotspots in known cancer genes and
on the status of microsatellites and mismatch-repair proteins.
These studies report both concordant and discordant alterations
between paired tumours, with the latter being predominant15–21.
High methylation of CpG islands seems to be a recurrent feature
of syCRC22–24 and has suggested the presence of an epigenetic
field
effect13,23.
Despite
these
reports,
a
comprehensive
characterization of syCRC is not yet available. Around 5% of
CRCs available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are
annotated as synchronous, but only one tumour has been
sequenced
in
all
cases,
thus
preventing
a
genome-wide
comparison of somatic mutations between paired lesions.
Here, we performed a systematic genomic profiling of 20
syCRCs from 10 patients with the aim to compare their
alterations. The analysed cohort included patients with Lynch
syndrome, FAP, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, familial CRC type X
and sporadic CRC, not to bias the analysis towards a particular
CRC type. We compared the landscape of acquired mutations
between paired tumours to assess whether they share the same
origin and converge towards a similar clone composition. We also
analysed the inherited genotype of these patients to search for
evidence of genetic predispositions to the development of
multiple tumours. Our results contribute the elucidation of the
genetics and of the predisposing mechanisms of syCRCs with
possible impacts on their clinical management.
Results
syCRCs are genetically heterogeneous tumours. We extracted
genomic DNA from multiple sections of one fresh frozen and
19 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumours from 10
patients (Supplementary Table 1). Each tumour underwent
quantitative pathological review to ensure a reliable estimation of
tumour content based on macrodissected sections or across
multiple regions of the tissue block (Supplementary Fig. 1). We
captured and sequenced the whole exomes of all 20 syCRCs and
matched normal samples reaching an average depth of coverage
of 125 � (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 2). We
called and compared single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
insertions and deletions (InDels) in tumour and corresponding
normal (Supplementary Fig. 3) to identify somatic mutations
(Table 1; Supplementary Data 1). We performed several quality
controls on the identified mutations. First, we re-sequenced the
whole exome of eight tumours from independent libraries
(Supplementary
Fig.
2)
and
confirmed
that
on
average
81%
mutations
were
present
in
both
sequencing
rounds
(Supplementary Table 3). Second, we re-called SNVs and InDels
using independent variant callers, and measured 88 and 78%
concordance, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). Third, we
re-sequenced a panel of 151 cancer genes in six tumours at high
depth of coverage (280 � , Supplementary Table 4) and confirmed
all previously detected mutations (Supplementary Data 2).
Finally, we randomly selected 24 SNVs and 11 InDels, and
confirmed 32 of them with Sanger sequencing (91% specificity,
Supplementary Table 5). Since the majority of sequenced samples
derived from FFPE tissues, we checked for possible sequencing
artefacts due to formalin fixation. We observed similar signatures
of somatic mutations between the 19 FFPE tumours and fresh
frozen CRCs from TCGA (Supplementary Fig. 4). Similarly, the
germline mutation patterns of FFPE samples were comparable to
those of blood and TCGA samples (Supplementary Fig. 4). This
excluded the presence of sequence artefacts.
In addition to SNVs and InDels, we also profiled copy number
variations (CNVs) using genome-wide SNP array on tumours
and normal samples, and identified genes undergoing somatic
amplifications
and
deletions
in
each
tumour
(Table
1;
Supplementary Data 3). As expected1,25, cancers associated
with
mismatch
repair
deficiency
were
hypermutated
and
mostly diploid, while non-hypermutated CRCs showed a high
proportion of amplified or deleted genes (Fig. 1a; Table 1).
We also confirmed that cancers on the right side of the intestine
were more mutated than those on the left side1,25 (Fig. 1a).
To assess whether syCRCs shared the same genetic origin, we
compared somatic alterations between paired tumours. Overall,
we detected high intertumour heterogeneity, with almost all
nonsilent mutations being dissimilar between lesions (Fig. 1b). To
discard the possibility that mutations were not identified because
of insufficient coverage depth, we verified that all mutated
positions in one tumour were well covered and wild type in the
other (Supplementary Fig. 5). Similar to mutations, most genes
underwent different types of CNVs in paired tumours (Fig. 1c).
The exceptions were patients S3, S12 and UH5 whose tumours
shared the same amplified regions on chromosomes 1 and 3.
However, these CNVs had different breakpoints (Supplementary
Fig. 6), suggesting that they occurred independently in each
tumour.
Next
we
investigated
whether,
although
with
different
modifications, tumours of a patient converged towards the
modification of the same cancer genes. Overall, only a small
fraction of cancer genes were altered in both tumours (Fig. 1d;
Supplementary Data 4). This was further confirmed in the deep
sequencing experiment (Supplementary Data 2). To assess
whether the few shared cancer genes were altered at similar
stages during the tumour growth, we quantified the clonality of
their alterations (see below). In the majority of cases, alterations
in cancer genes had different clonality (Fig. 2a), indicating that
the corresponding cancer genes were modified at different times
in the two tumours. For example, alterations in PIK3CA and
ARID1A were early events in tumour S13T2 (clonality 460%),
but were detectable in o35% of cells in S13T1 (Fig. 2a). Patients
S3, S12, and to a lower extent, UH5 again represented exceptions
because
their
tumours
shared
higher
fractions
of
altered
cancer genes (Fig. 1d) and these alterations, albeit different
(Supplementary Fig. 6), often had similar clonality (Fig. 2a).
Finally, we checked whether, overall, tumours of a patient
converged towards the alteration of the same genes. We found
that paired lesions of a patient did not share a higher fraction of
altered genes or of cancer genes than any pair of tumours of
different patients (P values ¼ 0.34 and 0.16, respectively, one-
tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 2b,c). Altogether our analysis
indicated that syCRCs had independent genetic origins, acquired

 different somatic alterations and developed into tumours that
were as genetically heterogeneous in terms of cancer genes as
tumours from different patients.
syCRCs show distinct clone composition. Next, we sought to
investigate whether syCRCs were also heterogeneous in terms of
clone composition, because this may have consequences in their
clinical management. To this aim, we derived the density
distribution of clonality of somatic alterations and quantified the
number of prevalent clones in each tumour using the allele
frequency of somatic SNVs, InDels, amplifications and deletions
(Fig. 3a). For SNVs and InDels, we measured the allele frequency
as the number of mutated reads over the total reads, after con-
firming the reliability of this estimation (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Because amplifications and deletions modify the allele frequency
of SNVs and InDels, we only considered mutations in diploid
regions (on average 76% of all somatic mutations in each tumour,
Supplementary Data 1). For amplified and deleted regions, we
inferred the allele frequency based on the loss of heterozygosity
of germline mutations (see Methods section). We corrected the
allele frequency of each alteration for the tumour content of the
corresponding lesion to remove the fraction of wild-type alleles
deriving from normal cells (Fig. 3a). We then assessed the
fraction of cancer cells carrying each alteration (alteration
clonality) and derived the density distributions of clonality for
SNVs,
InDels,
amplifications
and
deletions
independently
(Fig. 3a). In general, these density distributions indicated how
many alterations were expected at each clonality as inferred from
the observed counts. In particular, the peaks of the distributions
showed at which clonality the alterations accumulated and were
indicative of the clone composition of the tumour. To further

 classify the tumour as monoclonal, biclonal or polyclonal, we
divided somatic alterations into three groups according to their
clonality (480%, 35–80% and o35%). The largest group of the
three was indicative of the presence of one, two or multiple
prevalent clones (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Note 1). Three out of 20
tumours (S3T1, S12T1 and S12T2) were classified as monoclonal
because the majority of their somatic events were detectable in
480% of cancer cells (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 8). Ten
tumours (S13T1, S13T2, S6T1, S3T2, UH1T1, UH2T1, UH5T1,
UH5T2, UH8T1 and UH11T2) were considered as biclonal
because they showed an accumulation of modifications between
35 and 80% clonality, suggesting the co-existence of two prevalent
clones (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 8). The remaining seven
tumours (S6T2, UH1T2, UH2T2, UH6T1, UH6T2, UH8T2 and
UH11T1) were considered as polyclonal because the majority of
somatic events had clonality o35%, compatibly with the presence
of multiple clones (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 8). In 6 out of 10
patients, the two tumours had distinct clone composition
(Fig. 3b), indicating that syCRCs differed not only in their genetic
origin but also in their clonal development. Remarkably,
we obtained similar estimates of clone composition using an
independent method to measure the alteration clonality26
(Supplementary Fig. 9).
The inter- and intratumour heterogeneity of syCRCs may have
implications in the response of patients to therapy. For example,
several analysed tumours had amplification of EGF receptor
(EGFR) (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Data 4), which is a clinically
relevant target in CRC27–29. However, they also showed activating
alterations of EGFR downstream effectors conferring resistance to
anti-EGFR therapy30–33 (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Data 4). In most
cases, these alterations were heterogeneously distributed at
different
clonality
between
paired
tumours
(Fig.
3c;
Supplementary Fig. 8). For example, modifications of EGFR and
PIK3CA were almost clonal in tumour S6T1 but absent in S6T2
(Fig. 3d). We extended our analysis to a list of known actionable
genes34 and again observed that most alterations either occurred
in only one tumour or showed different clonality between
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, the different clone
composition of syCRCs might have an impact on drug response
and their genetic heterogeneity should be taken into account
when selecting therapeutic regimens.
syCRC patients carry damaging germline SNPs in immune genes.
Our analysis of somatic alterations showed that syCRCs started
independently and developed into heterogeneous tumours as a
consequence
of
distinct
driver
events.
Thus,
we
asked
whether there was any genetic predisposition of these individuals
to develop independent tumours as compared to patients
with solitary CRC (soCRC). We identified 406 soCRCs and 23

 additional syCRCs in TCGA and verified that overall the two
cohorts did not significantly differ in terms of age at initial
diagnosis, gender, ethnicity and CRC type (Supplementary
Fig.
11).
The
only
significant
difference
was
the
higher
occurrence of extra-colonic malignancies in syCRC patients
(P value ¼ 0.03, Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary Fig. 11),
which supports the hypothesis of their predisposition to develop
multiple tumours.
Since known hereditary conditions account only for a small
fraction of syCRC8, we hypothesized that syCRCs result from the
constitutional alteration not of a single gene, but of several genes
contributing to the same biological process. To detect such
altered processes, we developed a mutation enrichment gene set
analysis (MEGA). MEGA systematically compares the cumulative
distribution of mutations within a process between two cohorts
and identifies those processes that are overall more frequently
altered in one cohort (Fig. 4a, see Methods section). Using
MEGA, we compared the distribution of rare single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with predicted damaging effects on the
protein in 186 manually annotated KEGG gene sets35 between
syCRC and soCRC patients. We focused on rare damaging SNPs
(minor allele frequency o1%) because they are most likely to
cause disease36. Since the TCGA samples were sequenced at
different centres, we re-called mutations using the same pipeline
as for our samples (Supplementary Data 5). In syCRC patients,
we observed a significantly higher number of rare damaging
SNPs in four of the 186 KEGG gene sets (cytokine-cytokine
receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signalling, biosynthesis of
unsaturated fatty acids and cytosolic DNA sensing pathways, false
discovery rate, FDR o10%, Supplementary Data 6). To exclude
possible biases, we repeated the analysis using different reference
cohort and gene sets. To change cohort, we re-called and
annotated germline mutations in 756 individuals of the 1,000
Genomes Project37 (Supplementary Data 5). We again confirmed
the enrichment of syCRC patients in rare damaging SNPs
affecting the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and in the
Toll-like receptor signalling pathways (FDR o2%, Fig. 4b;
Supplementary Data 6). To change gene sets, we grouped 6,589
disease-associated genes38 according to disease and obtained 346
disease-associated gene sets (Supplementary Data 7). Applying
MEGA we found that syCRC patients had significantly more rare
damaging SNPs in four disease-associated gene sets as compared
to both the soCRC and to the 1,000 Genomes cohorts (FDR
o5%, Fig. 4b; Supplementary Data 8). Among these we found

756 individuals from the 1,000 Genomes) using a bootstrapping
procedure.
For
10,000
times,
we
randomly
extracted
33
individuals from the soCRC and from the 1,000 Genomes
cohorts
separately.
At
each
iteration,
we
compared
the
distribution of rare damaging SNPs in the four immune-related
gene sets between the 33 syCRC patients and the randomly
extracted individuals. We found that syCRC patients had
significantly
more
rare
damaging
SNPs
(P
value
o0.05,
one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test) in the vast majority of
comparisons (Fig. 4c).
Several gene sets that were frequently mutated in syCRC
patients are involved in immune response. The cytokine-cytokine
receptor
interaction
and
the
Toll-like
receptor
signalling
pathways mediate immune response while IBD and allergic
senitization arise in response to abnormal antigen recognition.
Overall, 24 out of 33 syCRC patients (73%) had rare damaging
SNPs in these four immune-related gene sets (Fig. 4d), with an
average of one mutation per patient. As a comparison, only 94
soCRC patients (23%) and 200 individuals from 1,000 Genomes
(26%) had rare damaging SNPs in the same gene sets, with an
average of 0.3 mutations per individual (Supplementary Data 6
and 8). Most of the genes in these gene sets were mutated in only
one syCRC patient (Fig. 4d), confirming that it is the alteration of
the immune response rather than of a specific gene to recur
across these patients. The only exception was the stopgain
mutation in the interferon domain of IFNA5 that recurred in
three patients (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Data 5).
syCRC patients have abnormal mucosa immune composition.
To understand whether inherited alterations of immune-related
genes were reflected in differences in the immune cell composi-
tion, we stained and counted T cells in the normal colonic
mucosa of syCRC and soCRC patients. We found significantly
higher fraction of CD8 þ T cells in the normal mucosa, which
was also evident when the lamina propria was scored indepen-
dently
(P
values ¼ 0.03
and
0.028,
respectively,
one-tailed
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 5a,b). Moreover, intraepithelial
T cells were more frequent in the surface epithelium of syCRC
patients, though not in the crypt epithelium (P values ¼ 9 � 10 � 3
and
0.5,
respectively,
one-tailed
Wilcoxon
rank-sum
test,
Fig. 5c,d). Therefore, the normal colonic mucosa of syCRC

 patients has a different immune cell composition than the normal
colonic mucosa of soCRC patients. To verify whether differences
were also detectable in the tumours, we compared the levels of
immune cell infiltrates in syCRCs and soCRCs. We measured the
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio because it has a prognostic value
in colorectal cancer39,40 and found that it was significantly higher
in syCRCs (P value ¼ 1.5 � 10 � 4, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum
test, Fig. 6a). This was due to a higher number of neutrophils in
syCRC
(Supplementary
Fig.
12).
Since
microsatellite
instable (MSI) tumours show higher immune cell infiltrates,
usually lymphocytes41, we removed MSI tumours and verified
that the difference between syCRCs and soCRCs remained
significant (P value ¼ 1.5 � 10 � 3, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum
test, Fig. 6b). We then analysed only syCRCs and verified that the
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio
was
similar
in
MSI
and
microsatellite stable (MSS) syCRCs and slightly higher in T2
than in T1 (P values ¼ 0.69 and 0.013, respectively, one-tailed
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Fig. 6c). Thus, despite being genetically
heterogeneous, syCRCs showed consistently higher level of
tumour-associated
inflammation,
particularly
in
neutrophils
(Fig. 6d). Finally, we sought to investigate whether these
differences in the immune cell composition were reflected at
the transcriptional level. We compared the entire transcriptomes
of syCRCs and soCRCs using an approach conceptually similar
to MEGA. First, we derived the overall distributions of gene
expression in 14 syCRCs and 193 soCRCs that had RNA
sequencing data in TCGA. Then, we grouped genes in four classes
(not expressed, lowly expressed, medium expressed, highly
expressed; see Methods section). Finally, we compared the
fractions of genes in each of the four classes between syCRCs
and soCRCs in the 186 KEGG gene sets to search for significant
differences. With the exception of the olfactory transduction
pathway, we found no difference in the fractions of highly and
medium expressed genes (Supplementary Data 9). Instead,
syCRCs showed significantly higher fractions of not expressed
and lowly expressed genes in 10 gene sets, seven of which had
clear connections with immune response (FDR o10%, Fig. 6e;
Supplementary Data 9). In particular, the cytokine–cytokine
receptor
interaction
and
the
Toll-like
receptor
signalling
pathways had an average of 10 and 3% not expressed genes per
tumour, respectively (Fig. 6e; Supplementary Data 9). We
confirmed similar results with the bootstrapping to control for
sample size (Supplementary Fig. 13) and with a gene set
enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes. In this
case, we found 47 significantly down regulated gene sets (FDR
o9%), 18 of which are immune-related including all those found
in the previous analysis (Supplementary Data 10). Finally, we
observed an overall tendency of genes in the immune-related
pathways (Figs 4d and 6e) to have lower expression when
mutated as compared to wild-type, particularly in the presence of
stopgain mutations (Supplementary Fig. 14). Altogether, these
results indicated a different functionality of immune-related
processes at the transcriptional level in syCRCs as compared to
soCRCs.
Discussion
In this study we show that syCRCs have independent genetic
origins and develop into genetically heterogeneous tumours, in
agreement with single observations in other anatomical sites such
as kidney42 and lung43. In general, tumour heterogeneity affects

 response to treatment because it may reduce the efficacy of
therapies targeting specific gene aberrations44. In the particular
case of syCRC, the scenario is complicated by the presence of
genetically distinct tumours. Currently, no specific guidelines
exist for the management of syCRC45. Our results highlight the
need for testing all synchronous tumours to inform on the most
appropriate clinical decisions. For example, anti-EGFR therapy
and monitoring of mutations in EGFR downstream effectors as
biomarkers of resistance may have limited applicability in syCRC
patients because of the genetic contribution of distinct clones
from multiple tumours.
We also contribute a better understanding of the factors that
predispose to multiple tumours. Our analysis of germline
mutations
suggests
that
inherited
damaging
alterations
of
immune-related genes may increase the frequency of independent
cancer-initiating events. This may be due to the inflammatory
microenvironment that favours tumorigenesis via increased
genomic instability or through the production of cytokines
and growth factors46,47. In this respect, our results suggest the
presence
of
an
environmental
field
effect
mediated
by
inflammation promoting the onset of multiple independent
tumours. In addition to germline alterations, we report a higher
proportion of CD8 þ T cells in the lamina propria and a higher
abundance in the surface intraepithelial compartment of the
normal colon mucosa of syCRC patients. CD8 þ T cells, in
particular those with intraepithelial location, are associated
with maintenance of epithelial integrity48. Thus, it is not clear
if
their
relative
abundance
in
syCRC
is
associated
with
tumorigenesis or increased surveillance. We also observe a
higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and differences in the
tumour expression of immune related genes. The role of immune
cells in promoting neoplastic progression is well known46,49, and
it is usually mediated through the production of cytokines46,50.
Moreover,
bacterial
biofilms,
which
contribute
to
chronic
inflammation,
are
also
known
to
favour
the
onset
of
colorectal cancer51,52. It would be interesting to check whether
the
gastrointestinal
microbiome
also
contributes
to
the
environmental field effect of syCRC. Further studies on the
deregulation mechanisms of these immune processes are required
to fully understand the onset of multiple primary tumours,
including extending the analysis to other organs.
Methods
Sample description. Tumours used in this study were collected from patients
diagnosed with CRC who underwent surgical resection of two syCRC in a window
of time of 6 months maximum8. Samples were obtained from four (S3, S6, S12 and
S13) and six (UH1, UH2, UH5, UH6, UH8 and UH11) patients from the Istituto
Clinico Humanitas (ICH), Rozzano, Milan, Italy and the University College
London Hospital (UCLH), London, United Kingdom, respectively. All patients
provided written informed consent and the study followed the approved
institutional guidelines (ICH: ICH-25-09, 07/05/2009, UCLH: 07/Q1604/17 and
11/LO/1613).
BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-21, NR-24 and MONO-27 mononucleotides were
analysed by capillary gel electrophoresis and used as molecular markers of
microsatellite instability in tumours of patients S3, S6, S12 and S13. A tumour was
classified as microsatellite unstable when at least one marker was found altered.
All tumours, except those from patients S3 and S12, were further screened for the
lack of mismatch repair proteins. For the tumours of patients S13 and S6,
nuclear expression of hMLH1 (clone G-168–15, 1:200, BD Biosciences) and
hMSH2 (clone FE11, Calbiochem, 1:100, Merck Millipore) were investigated via
immunohistochemistry. The lack of expression of hMLH1/hMSH2 was assessed

For lesions of patients UH1, UH2, UH5, UH6, UH8 and UH11 the expression of
hMLH1 (Clone G168-15, 1:200 Biocare Medical), hMSH2 (Clone 25D12, 1:100,

(Clone A16-4, 1:300 BD Biosciences Pharmingen) were assessed using the Leica
Vision BioSystems Bond-max.
Quantification of tumour content. The tumour content of lesions from patients
S3, S6, S12 and S13 was measured as the average of three 2 mm-thick sections at the
beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the region used for DNA extraction.
Two independent pathologists quantified tissue and tumour areas using the ImageJ
software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) on the digitalized image of each section. The
tumour content of the section was calculated as the percentage of tumour area over
the total tissue area. The tumour area of lesions from patients UH1, UH2, UH5,
UH6, UH8 and UH11 was delimited by the pathologist on haematoxylin and eosin
stained 2 mm-thick FFPE sections at the beginning of the block. This section was
then used to as a reference to macrodissect the tumour in each section. According
to pathologist evaluation, the tumour content of the dissected areas was 490%.
DNA extraction and whole-exome sequencing. Genomic DNA for all tumours,
except S3T1, and 7-matched normal tissues (S6N, UH1N, UH2N, UH5N, UH6N,
UH8N, UH11N) was extracted from 10 mm-thick FFPE sections (3–6 sections
per sample) using QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Tumour S3T1 derived from fresh frozen tissue. Blood of
patients S3, S12 and S13 was used as matching reference. DNA from blood and
frozen samples was extracted using DNaesy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Whole exome was captured from genomic DNA for all 20 tumours and
matched normal using the SureSelect XT Human All Exon V4 (Agilent) following
the manufacturer’s protocol with modifications in case of DNA extracted from
FFPE samples. Briefly, 3 mg of genomic DNA was sheared using an Adaptive
Focused Acoustics technology (Covaris) to obtain B200-bp-long fragments.
Fragments were used to prepare libraries according to SureSelect XT manual.
Libraries were further amplified with 7–10 cycles of PCR and 500–750 ng were
hybridized with the bait library. Captured DNA was amplified with 16 PCR cycles
and barcode indexes were added. Libraries of tumour and normal samples from
patients UH8 and UH11 were prepared from 500 ng of genomic DNA using
NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) with minor
modifications to make it compatible with SureSelect XT Human All Exon V4
capture kit (Agilent). Briefly, NEB adaptors and NEB PCR primers were replaced
by SureSelect adaptor mix and SureSelect ILM indexing pre capture primers,
respectively. Libraries were then sequenced using one lane (S13N, S13T1, S13T2,
S6N, S6T1, S6T2, S3N, S3T1, S3T2, S12N, S12T1, S12T2) or half a lane (UH1N,
UH1T1, UH1T2, UH2N, UH2T1, UH2T2, UH5N, UH5T1, UH5T2, UH6N,
UH6T1, UH6T2) of Illumina HiSeq 2000 or one-third of a lane of Illumina HiSeq
2500 (UH8N, UH8T1, UH8T2, UH11N, UH11T1, UH11T2) per sample, with 76
and 101 bp paired-end protocol, respectively. All tumour and normal samples of
patients S3, S6, S12 and S13 underwent a second round of whole-exome sequencing
from independent libraries. DNA extraction and library preparation were
performed as described above. Each library was next sequenced using half a lane of
Illumina HiSeq 2000 with 76 bp paired-end protocol. Samples were sequenced at
the sequencing facility of the IFOM-IEO Campus, Milan and at the Biomedical
Research Centre Genomics Core Facility, Guy’s Hospital, London.
Sequence alignment and variant annotation. Sequencing reads from each
sample were aligned to the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using Novoalign
(http://www.novocraft.com/) with default parameters. At the most three mis-
matches per read were allowed and PCR duplicates were removed using rmdup of
SAMtools53. All reads uniquely mapping within 75 or 100 bp from the targeted
regions were considered as on target and retained for further analysis. SNVs and
small insertion/deletions (InDels) were identified using VarScan2 (ref. 54) in each
tumour and in normal samples independently. In tumours, SNVs and InDels were
further retained if (1) supported by at least 10 mutated reads, (2) had allele
frequency Z5%, and (3) had at least 1% of reads mapping on both DNA strands.
In normal samples, SNVs and InDels were further retained if (1) supported by at
least two mutated reads and (2) had at least 1% of reads mapping on both DNA
strands. For normal and tumour samples that underwent two whole-exome
sequencing rounds, mutations were called independently in each experiment as
described above. In the case of normal samples, mutations called in each round
were merged and used for further analysis. In the case of tumour samples, SNVs
and InDels detected in one round were retained only if present in the other
sequencing round and merged. In each tumour, somatic SNVs and InDels were
identified as tumour-specific if absent in the normal counterpart and further
retained after manual inspection. MuTect55 (version 1.17) and Strelka56
(version 1.0.14) were used to measure concordance in calling SNVs and InDels,
respectively, with default parameters (MuTect: minimum number reads covering a
site in the tumour ¼ 14 and in the normal ¼ 8; Strelka: indelMaxRefRepeat ¼ 8,
indelMaxWindowFilteredBasecallFrac ¼ 0.3, indelMaxIntHpolLength ¼ 14,
sindelPrior ¼ 0.000001, sindelNoise ¼ 0.000001, sindelQuality_LowerBound ¼ 15)
to all tumours and matched normal samples. Only somatic SNVs identified as
‘KEEP’ in MuTect and InDels identified as ‘PASS’ in Strelka were retained and
intersected with the manually curated collection of somatic mutations in each
sample.
Starting from the entire pool of somatic mutations in each tumour, ANNOVAR57
was used to identify nonsilent (nonsynonymous, stopgain, stoploss, frameshift,
nonframeshift and splicing modifications) mutations using RefSeq v.64 (ref. 58) as a
reference protein dataset. SNVs and InDels falling within 2 bp from the splice sites of
a gene in one of the three datasets were considered as splicing mutations.
Thirty-five somatic nonsilent mutations were randomly selected from all
samples for orthogonal validation. Genomic regions of B200 bp long
encompassing the mutations were amplified by PCR using the Q5 High Fidelity
DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and PCR amplicons were submitted for
Sanger sequencing. Chromatograms were processed with Chromas 2.3 and all
sequences were visually inspected.
Deep sequencing of cancer gene panel. Genomic DNA was extracted from
macrodissected tumours UH1T1, UH1T2, UH2T1, UH2T2, UH11T1 and
UH11T2, and libraries were prepared as described above. A panel of 151 cancer
genes was then captured in each tumour using ClearSeq Comprehensive Capture
kit (Agilent) and sequenced in one lane of Illumina Miseq using the 300 paired-end
protocol. Samples were sequenced at the sequencing facility of the Biomedical
Research Centre Genomics Core Facility, Guy’s Hospital, London. Alignment of
sequencing reads and variant calling were performed using the same analytical
framework as described above.
SNP array and copy number detection. Quality of the genomic DNA extracted
from FFPE blocks was assessed using Infinium HD FFPE QC kit (Illumina) and
DNA was restored using Infinium HD FFPE restore kit (Illumina). Tumour and
matched-normal samples were genotyped using HumanOmniExpress-24 v1.0
(Illumina) and images were scanned using a BeadArray reader. Intensity and
genotype data were extracted for CNV analysis after normalizing raw fluorescent
signals using Illumina Genome Studio v2011.1.CNVs were detected using
ASCAT59 (version 2.1) with default parameters (segment lengths for ASPCF
Segmentation and probes with minor allele frequency ranging between 40 and 60%
in matched reference for all samples). To improve the identification of CNVs with
FFPE samples only high-quality-genotyped probes (genocall score 40.7) were
used. Analysis of all tumour samples was done in comparison with matched
normal. Frequency distributions of the germline heterozygous single SNPs were
integrated with the SNP array results to identify high-confidence aberrant regions.
In a diploid genome, heterozygous SNPs follow a normal distribution centred
around 50% allele because both alleles are present at equal frequency. In the case of
allelic imbalance due to CNVs, frequency distribution of heterozygous SNPs
deviates from normality because of the unbalanced ratio between mutated and
wild-type alleles. Hence, the distribution of heterozygous SNP frequencies can be
used to identify genomic regions undergoing CNVs. High-confidence aberrant
regions were defined as genomic segments with copy number different from 2 and
with an aberration reliability score 475%, and present in regions with non-normal
SNP frequency distribution. The copy numbers of aberrant regions were assessed
using ASCAT59. To identify amplified and deleted genes, the genomic coordinates
of the aberrant regions in each sample were intersected with those of 21,033 human
genes of the SureSelect XT Human All Exon V4 kit (Agilent). A gene was considered
as modified if Z80% of its length was contained in an aberrant region60.
Identification of putative driver alterations. A list of CRC genes was
retrieved from the Network of Cancer Genes61(http://ncg.kcl.ac.uk/). This list
was intersected with the list of genes with somatic mutations, amplifications and
deletions in each tumour. Altered cancer genes were further classified as putative
drivers in each tumour if they harboured (1) nonsilent mutations and/or (2)
were oncogenes undergoing amplification or (3) tumour-suppressors undergoing
deletion in recurrently modified CRC regions (http://www.broadinstitute.org/tcga/
home, version ‘2014-11-03’).
Reconstruction of tumour clone composition. Clone composition of each tumour
was rebuilt based on the clonality of its somatic alterations (SNVs, InDels, amplifi-
cations and deletions), defined as the fraction of cancer cells carrying each alteration.
All CNV regions and all SNVs and InDels were used, except mutations falling in
amplifications and deletions, because of the effect of CNVs on allele frequency.
Clonality of SNVs and InDels was assessed based on the allele frequency
(number of mutated sequencing reads over the total number of reads covering that
position). First, the allele frequency (f) of each mutation (i) was corrected for the
tumour content (tc):
f 0
i ¼ fi
tc
ð1Þ
Second, the clonality (c) of each mutation (i) was measured as the double of the
corrected allelic frequency (f 0), to account for the presence of two alleles per cell:
ci ¼ f 0
i �2

 In cases of mutations with 50%o f 0o 100% (almost clonal), clonality was
assessed as:
f 0
i 450% !
c0
i ¼ 100%
c00
i ¼ f 0
i � 50%
�
�
�2

ð3Þ
where c0
i and c00
i represent the clonality of the two alleles, respectively.
Clonality of regions undergoing amplification or deletion was assessed based on
the variation in allele frequency of heterozygous SNPs between each tumour and
the matched-normal sample. First, heterozygous SNPs in each somatic CNV
were identified as germline mutations with 40–60% allele frequency in the
matched-normal tissue of each patient. Second, the allele frequency of any CNV
region (j) was measured as the median allele frequency ð~
f Þ of all heterozygous
SNPs in the region and corrected for the tumour content:
~
f 0
j ¼
~
fj
tc
ð4Þ
Third, the clonality (c) of each CNV region (j) was measured as twice the absolute
deviation of ~
f 0 from the expected allele frequency (50%), to account for CNV allelic
imbalance:
cj ¼ ~
f 0
j � 50%
�

ð5Þ
The density distribution of clonality was calculated for each type of alteration
independently using the one-dimensional Gaussian kernel estimator as
implemented in the R function ‘stat_density’ (http://ggplot2.org).
First, the probability density (r) was derived from the clonality of all somatic
alterations. It defined the probability (P) of observing an alteration (x) at clonality
(I) as the area of density distribution in I:
P x
ð Þ ¼
Z
I
r x
ð Þdx
ð6Þ
Second, the expected number of alterations (E) at clonality (I) was calculated as the
probability of each alteration P(x) multiplied by the total number of alterations
(n)62:
E ¼ P x
ð Þ�n
ð7Þ
The density distribution of clonality corresponded to the distribution of the
expected number of alterations and recapitulated the clonal composition of the
tumour.
Identification of rare damaging SNPs. The BAM files of matched-normal tissue
of 429 TCGA CRC samples (304 colon and 125 rectum adenocarcinoma) were
downloaded from the Cancer Genomics Hub (https://cghub.ucsc.edu). The
corresponding clinical data were downloaded from the TCGA data portal (https://
tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm). This information was used
to identify 23 syCRC and 406 soCRC patients and to assess the occurrence of
extra-colonic malignancies. TCGA patients were classified as affected by hereditary
cancer based on the immunohistochemistry of mismatch-repair proteins,
on the microsatellite instability, or on the presence of pathogenic SNP in CRC
predisposing genes. The BAM files of 756 non-consanguineous individuals
from the 1,000 Genomes Project37 were downloaded from the repository
(ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk, phase 1 version 3 April 2014). All samples had
sequencing coverage 420 reads on at least 70% of the targeted regions.
To obtain uniform variant calling across samples, all BAM files from 10 syCRCs
sequenced here, 23 TGCA syCRCs, 406 TCGA soCRCs and 756 individuals from
the 1,000 Genomes Project were re-analysed with the same pipeline to identify
germline SNPs. Briefly, PCR duplicates were removed using rmdup command of
SAMtools53 and only reads uniquely mapping within the SureSelect XT Human All
Exon V4 kit targeted regions were used for further analysis. SNPs were identified
using VarScan2 (ref. 54) and retained if (1) supported by at least 10 mutated reads
and 1% of the reads mapping on both DNA strands, and (2) had allele frequency
ranging between 40 and 60% or 490%. For samples S3, S6, S12 and S13 that
underwent two rounds of sequencing, aligned BAM files of the normal tissue were
merged using SAMtools4 before variant calling. ANNOVAR57 was used to identify
stopgain, stoploss and nonsynonymous mutations using RefSeq v.64 (ref. 58) as
protein dataset. All stopgain and stoploss SNPs were considered as damaging,
while predictions on the damaging effect of nonsynonymous mutations were
obtained from dbNSFP version 2.4 (ref. 63), based on SIFT64, PolyPhen265,
MutationTester66, MutationAssessor67 and LTR68. Mutations were considered as
damaging if predicted by at least four of the five methods (SIFT score o0.05,
labelled as ‘probably damaging’ or ‘possibly damaging’ by PolyPhen2,
MutationTester and LTR or as ‘high predicted non-functional’ by
MutationAssessor). Rare damaging SNPs were defined as those with either no
minor allele frequency or with minor allele frequency lower than 1%, as reported in
ANNOVAR based on the 1,000 Genomes Project (phase 1 version 3, April 2014)
and on the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (version 0.0.27, April 2014). To
further remove possible sequencing and alignment errors, all rare damaging SNPs
not detected in the general population but present in more than 50% of the three
cohorts were removed.
Mutation enrichment gene set analysis (MEGA). MEGA was developed
to identify gene sets (for example, genes involved in the same pathway,
or predisposing to specific diseases) that show a significantly higher number of
mutations in syCRC patients as compared to soCRC patients.
As an input, MEGA requires a gene set X ¼ {g1,y, gx} and a list of mutations
detected in this set in two cohorts of samples A ¼ {a1,y, ay} and B ¼ {b1,y, bz}.
For each sample (ai, bi) in cohorts A and B, the number of mutations (Nai, Nbi) in
all genes of gene set X is calculated as:
Nai ¼
X
g2X
Mai;g and Nbi ¼
X
g2X
Mbi;g
ð8Þ
where Mai;g and Mbi;g are all mutations in gene g for samples ai and bi, respectively.
The distributions of mutations (DA and DB) for cohorts A and B are then
derived as:
DA ¼
Nai; . . . ; Nay
�
�
and DB ¼ Nbi; . . . ; Nbz
f
g
ð9Þ
To determine whether cohort A is enriched in mutations of gene set X as compared
to cohort B, distributions DA and DB are compared using the one-tailed Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. In the case of multiple gene sets, the P value from each comparison
is corrected for FDR using the Benjamini & Hochberg method. In case the sample
sizes differ substantially between groups A and B (as in the case of our cohorts),
MEGA applies a bootstrapping procedure (random sampling with replacement).
It down-samples the larger cohort to reach the sample size of the smaller cohort
randomly 10,000 times and repeats the analysis at each iteration. At the end of all
iterations, MEGA calculates the proportion of significant enrichments (P value
o0.05, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test) over the total comparisons.
Two lists of gene sets were used here. The first list was composed of 186
manually curated gene sets comprising 5,267 human genes from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were downloaded from MSigDb35
(version 5). The second list of 1,076 diseases was collected from the catalogue of
published Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS, October 2013)38. Genes
associated with diseases were retrieved and grouped into 1,076 disease-associated
gene sets. Only 346 of these (comprising 6,589 human genes) were selected because
they contained at least 10 genes. For each gene set the number of rare damaging
SNPs were compared between syCRC and soCRC patients or individuals from
1,000 Genomes Project.
Immune composition of tumour and normal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry
was performed to identify CD8 (Clone 4B11, 1:1, Novocastra) and CD3 (Clone
LN10, 1:1, Novocastra) double immunostaining heat mediated antigen retrieval
was performed using Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (pH 6.0, citrate) for 30 min
before the tissue was blocked using peroxide for five minutes. After primary
antibody incubation for 15 min, eight minute incubation of both post primary
reagent and a polymer reagent was performed. Bond polymer refine red detection
was used for visualization of the first antibody. A second heat mediated retrieval
using Bond epitope retrieval solution 2 (pH 9.0, TE) was used for the second
antibody for 10 min, followed by incubations of 30 min for the second antibody,
and 20 and 30 min for the post primary and polymer reagents, respectively. DAB
was used for visualization. Haematoxylin was used as a counterstain. The density of
the intraepithelial T-cell compartment and the ratios of CD8 þ to CD8 � T cells
were determined using our published methods69,70. To identify neutrophils
(Neutrophil elastase, Dako, clone NP57) and lymphocytes (CD3, Novocastra, clone
LN10) 19 syCRCs (from Instituto Humanitas Milan, UCLH London, and
Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford) and 14 soCRCs (from
UCLH London) were stained on the bondmax system (http://www.vision-bio.com/).
The number of neutrophils and lymphocytes was counted in three different areas (hot
spots) away from the luminal surface of the tumour. The histopathologist was blinded
to the tumour details (MSI, MSS, syCRC, soCRC) and areas of ulceration, necrosis,
artefacts, and intra-vascular neutrophils were ignored. The tumour sections were
screened at low power magnification ( � 40 and � 100), and 2 high power fields
( � 400). The average number of infiltrates was expressed in number per high-power
field (Olympus BX51, � 400).
Gene expression analysis. RNA sequencing data (level 3, RNASeqV2) were
available in TCGA for 14 syCRCs, 193 soCRCs and 35 matching normal samples.
Starting from the scaled estimate expression values for 20,531 genes, the number of
transcripts per million reads (TPM) was obtained. Gene expression in normal
tissue was calculated as the average TPM across the 35 normal samples. The
distribution of TPM values was measured in each sample and genes were
considered as (1) highly expressed, if their TPMs fell in 475th percentile of the
distribution; (2) medium expressed, if their TPMs ranged between 25th and 75th
percentile of the distribution; (3) lowly expressed, if their TPMs fell in o25th
percentile of the distribution; (4) not expressed in the tumour, if their TPMs were
o0.1. The cumulative proportion of genes in each class of expression levels was
compared between syCRCs and soCRCs using the Fisher’s exact test in each of the
186 KEGG gene sets. The resulting P values were corrected for multiple tests using
the Benjamini & Hochberg method. To control for the sample size effect,
a bootstrapping procedure was applied. For 10,000 times, 14 soCRCs were
randomly selected and the proportion of genes in the four classes of expression
in each gene set was compared with that of 14 syCRCs using the Fisher’s exact

 test. At the end of all iterations, the proportion of significant enrichments
(P valueo0.05, Fisher’s exact test) over the total comparisons was calculated.
Differentially expressed gene sets between 14 syCRCs and 193 soCRCs were
detected using the GAGE package (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/
bioc/html/gage.html). Starting from the read counts of 20,531 genes in each
samples, genes with read count equal to zero across all samples were removed. For
each sample the number of reads was normalized to the total amount of sequenced
reads and a log2 transformation was applied to stabilize the variance at low
expression levels. GAGE was applied with default parameters (set.size ¼ c(10,500);
rank.test ¼ FALSE; use.fold ¼ TRUE; FDR.adj ¼ TRUE; weights ¼ NULL;
saaPrep ¼ gagePrep; saaTest ¼ gs.tTest; saaSum ¼ gageSum; use.stouffer ¼ TRUE)
and experimental design specified as ‘unpaired’. A FDR threshold of o10% was
used to detect down and up regulated gene sets in syCRCs as compared to syCRCs.
