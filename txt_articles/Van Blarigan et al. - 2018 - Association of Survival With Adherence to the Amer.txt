IMPORTANCE The American Cancer Society Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines for
Cancer Survivors (ACS guidelines) include maintaining (1) a healthy body weight; (2) physical
activity; and (3) a diet that includes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. It is not known
whether patients with colon cancer who follow these guidelines have improved survival.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether a lifestyle consistent with the ACS guidelines is associated
with improved survival rates after colon cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included 992 patients
with stage III colon cancer who were enrolled in the CALGB 89803 randomized adjuvant
chemotherapy trial from 1999 through 2001. Data for the present study were analyzed
between November 2016 and December 2017.
EXPOSURES We assigned an ACS guidelines score for each included patient based on body
mass index; physical activity; and intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and
red/processed meats (score range, 0-6, with higher score indicating healthier behaviors).
Secondarily, we examined a score that also included alcohol intake in addition to the other
factors (range, 0-8). Lifestyle was assessed during and 6 months after chemotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for disease-free, recurrence-free, and overall survival.
RESULTS Of the 992 patients enrolled in the study, 430 (43%) were women, and the mean
(SD) age was 59.6 (11.2) years (range, 21-85 years). Over a 7-year median follow-up, we
observed 335 recurrences and 299 deaths (43 deaths without recurrence). Compared with
patients with a 0 to 1 ACS guidelines score (n = 262; 26%), patients with a 5 to 6 score
(n = 91; 9%) had a 42% lower risk of death during the study period (HR, 0.58; 95% CI,
0.34-0.99; P = .01 for trend) and improved disease-free survival (HR, 0.69; 95% CI,
0.45-1.06; P = .03 for trend). When alcohol consumption was included in the score, the
adjusted HRs comparing patients with scores of 6 to 8 (n = 162; 16%) vs those with scores of
0 to 2 (187; 91%) were 0.49 for overall survival (95% CI, 0.32-0.76; P = .002 for trend), 0.58
for disease-free survival (95% CI, 0.40, 0.84; P = .01 for trend), and 0.64 for recurrence-free
survival (95% CI, 0.44-0.94; P = .05 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Having a healthy body weight, being physically active, and
eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains after diagnosis of stage III colon
cancer was associated with a longer survival.

allmortality.6-8Guidelineadherencehasalsobeencorrelatedwith
higher quality of life among survivors of colorectal cancer.9 It is
not known, however, whether following the guidelines after
colorectal cancer diagnosis is associated with reduced risk of
recurrence or mortality.
Data suggest that lifestyle may have an impact on colo-
rectal cancer outcomes.10 Our group reported that a western
dietary pattern was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of
colon cancer recurrence and death,11 and physical activity af-
ter diagnosis was associated with a 50% lower risk of recur-
rence and death.12 Additionally, our group and others have re-
ported that body size is associated with colorectal cancer
recurrence and death, although the body mass index (BMI; cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) associated with the lowest mortality rate may be
higher in patients with cancer than in healthy individuals.13
No study has looked at the combined effect of BMI, physical
activity, and diet after colorectal cancer diagnosis.
We sought to determine whether patients with colon can-
cer who had a lifestyle consistent with the ACS Nutrition and
Physical Activity Guidelines for Cancer Survivors (hereafter
referred to as the ACS guidelines) had longer disease-free,
recurrence-free, and overall survival.

gible for analysis. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards of all participating institutions, and each partici-
pant signed an informed consent statement in accordance with
federal and institutional guidelines.
Dietary Assessment
Patients completed a validated food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) that queried intake of 131 items over the past 3 months
in up to 9 frequency options ranging from never to 6 or more
times per day, as previously described.15-18 Items of interest in-
cluded fruits, vegetables, whole grains, refined grains, red and
processed meats, and alcohol (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Physical Activity Assessment
Patientsreportedaveragetimeperweekoverthepast2months
performing 9 common leisure-time activities, as previously
described.12 Ten response options ranged from 0 to 11 or more
hours per week for each activity. To calculate total metabolic
equivalent task (MET) hours per week (MET-h/wk) of physical
activity, we assigned each activity a MET value, multiplied the
activity-specific MET value by the amount of time the partici-
pantengagedinthatactivity,andsummedacrossallactivities.19
ACS Guidelines Score
We quantified the degree of concordance between patients’
lifestyles and the ACS guidelines using a score developed by
McCulloughetal.8ThescoreincludedBMI,physicalactivity,and
intake of vegetables and fruits, proportion of total grains con-
sumed that were whole grains, and intake of red and processed
meat (eTable 2 in the Supplement).3,6 The overall score ranged
from0to6,withhigherscoresindicatingbehaviormoreconsis-
tent with the guidelines. In our primary analysis, we calculated
thecumulativeaverageACSguidelinesscoreusingdatafromboth

WeconsideredalternativescoringforBMIinanapriorisec-
ondary analysis. The ACS guidelines recommend a BMI of 18.5
to24.9.However,aBMIof23.0to29.9hasbeenassociatedwith
lower risk of recurrence or death among patients with colorec-
tal cancer.20 Therefore, we examined alternative cut points for
BMI: 0 points for 35.0 or higher; 1 point for 18.5 to 22.9 or 30.0
to 34.9; and 2 points for 23.0 to 29.9.
In addition, alcohol consumption is included in the ACS
guidelines for Cancer Prevention, but not among cancer survi-
vors.Givenpatientinterestandapossiblebenefitoflowtomod-

Key Points
Question Do patients with colon cancer who follow the American
Cancer Society’
s Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines for
Cancer Survivors (ACS guidelines) have better survival rates than
those who do not follow these guidelines?
Findings In this cohort study of 992 patients with colon cancer,
a lifestyle consistent with the ACS guidelines was associated with
a 42% lower risk of death during the study period. The 5-year
survival probability was 85% for patients with high concordance
with the guidelines and 76% for patients with low concordance
with the guidelines, a 9% absolute reduction in risk of death at
5 years.
Meaning Patients with colon cancer who follow the ACS
guidelines during and after treatment may have a higher 5-year
survival rate.

en, or more than 2 drinks per day for men; 1 point for no drinks,

individuals compared with a score that assigned 2 points for no
alcohol.8TheACSguidelinesscoreincludingalcoholrangedfrom
0 to 8, with a score of 8 indicating complete concordance with
the ACS guidelines plus low to moderate alcohol consumption.
Outcome Assessment
Our primary outcome for this analysis was overall survival,
defined as time from survey 1 to death. We also examined dis-
ease-free and recurrence-free survival. Disease-free survival
was defined as time to tumor recurrence, occurrence of a new
primary colon tumor, or death from any cause. Recurrence-
free survival was defined as time to tumor recurrence or new
primary colon tumor; patients who died without recurrence
were censored. Follow-up included nearly 100% of enrollees.
Statistical Analysis
There was no difference in survival between treatment arms in
CALGB 89803, so we analyzed all patients as a prospective
cohort.22WeusedCoxproportionalhazardsregressiontocalcu-
late hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We
combinedpatientswithACSguidelinesscoresof0and1andpa-
tients with scores of 5 and 6 owing to low numbers in both cat-
egories(6%had0points[n = 61];20%had1point[n = 201];7%

Absolute Risk Difference, Number Needed to Treat, and PAR
Weestimatedtheabsoluteriskdifferenceofdeathat5years,the
number needed to treat for 5 years to prevent 1 death, and the
population-attributable risk (PAR) between patients with ACS
guidelines scores of 4 or higher and 5 or higher vs lower scores.
There were only 19 individuals with a score of 6, so we were
unable to examine this group. The Cox proportional hazards

weassumedthatthepatients’lifestylemeasuredat2timepoints

Discussion
In this prospective study, patients with stage III colon cancer
and a lifestyle consistent with the ACS guidelines (score, 5-6)
had a 42% lower risk of death compared with patients who did
not(score,0-1).Theabsolutereductioninriskofdeathat5years
was 9% comparing patients with a score of 5 or 6 vs those with
a score of 0 to 4.
To our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated the ACS
guidelinesaftercoloncancerinrelationtosurvival.Among65838
womenwithoutcancer,theACSguidelineswereassociatedwith
a61%lowerriskofcolorectalcancer–specificmortality(HR,0.39;
95% CI, 0.24-0.63; P < .001).6 Among 2017 female cancer sur-
vivors,womenwithdietsconsistentwiththeAmericanInstitute
forCancerResearchguidelines(similartotheACSguidelines)had
a20%lowerriskofdeathduringthestudyperiod(HR,0.80;95%
CI,0.64-1.00;P = .05).26Noassociationwasobservedamongthe
380womenwithcolorectalcancerinthatstudy,buttherewere
feweventsamongthosepatients(n = 82),anddietwasassessed
approximately 9 years after diagnosis (after most events of co-
lorectal cancer recurrence and death would have occurred). In
1 of the only other studies to examine a diet quality score after
diagnosis, women with diets consistent with the Health Eating
Index after breast cancer had a 26% lower risk of death during
the study period (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99; P = .04).27
It is plausible that following the ACS guidelines after co-
lon cancer diagnosis inhibits recurrence and death. Exten-
sivedatasuggestthatahealthybodysize,physicalactivity,and
diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains improves in-
sulin sensitivity, decreases inflammation, and increases vita-
min D levels.28 These biomarkers have all been consistently
associated with colorectal cancer survival.28,29
Each component of the score (BMI, physical activity, diet)
was independently associated with survival after colon can-
cer. However, as previously reported, the BMI associated with
the lowest risk of death for patients with colon cancer was
higher than the ACS guidelines recommendation (23.0-29.9 vs
18.5-24.9).20 This may reflect reverse causation, since weight
loss commonly occurs as cancer progresses. Alternatively, it is
possible that a BMI of 23.0 to 29.9 reflects an optimal muscle
mass to fat ratio for patients with colon cancer.30 For physical
activity, we observed a benefit at 8.75 MET-h/week, approxi-
mately150minutesperweekofmoderateactivitysuchasbrisk
walking. For diet, choosing whole over refined grains and eat-
ing 5 or more servings per day of vegetables and fruits were as-
sociated with improved colon cancer survival. Low intake of
redandprocessedmeatdidnotappeartocontributetotheben-
efit of the ACS guidelines, consistent with data from the

 Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort.31 Higher protein
intake may be beneficial for cancer survivors.32 Thus, it is pos-
sible that red meat is inversely associated with colon cancer
mortality, despite being positively associated with colon can-
cer incidence. Further research is needed to inform guide-
lines regarding meat intake for patients with cancer.
Limitations
Our study has a number of strengths, including many events,
standardized cancer treatment, repeated lifestyle assess-
ments, and complete follow-up. However, there were several
limitations. First, there was the potential for reverse causa-
tion. To limit reverse causation, we excluded patients whose
cancer recurred or who died within 90 days of the survey and
within up to 180 days of the survey in a sensitivity analysis.
Additionally,allofthepatientshadcomprehensivestagingand
good performance status when they completed survey 1. Sec-
ond, we cannot conclude that the associations we observed are
independent of patients’prediagnosis lifestyle or that chang-
ing behaviors after diagnosis will achieve the observed re-
sults. Third, there is measurement error in lifestyle assess-
ments, but the error is likely nondifferential in our analysis
owing to our prospective data. Fourth, our study population
waspredominantlywhite,andpatientsintrialsmaynotberep-
resentative of all patients with colon cancer. We did not ob-
serve evidence of effect modification by race, but future stud-
ies in more diverse cohorts are needed. Finally, while
adjustment for risk factors for cancer recurrence and death
had little impact on our effect estimates, we cannot exclude
the possibility of confounding or prove causation.
Conclusions
In conclusion, patients with colon cancer who had a healthy
body weight, were physically active, and ate a diet rich in veg-
etables and fruits and chose whole over refined grains had a
42% lower risk of death during the study period than patients
who did not engage in these behaviors. Clinical trials of life-
style change in colon cancer are needed.
