It has been suggested that early infections are associated with increased risk for later celiac disease (CD). We anal-
yzed prospective claims data of infants from Bavaria, Germany, born between 2005 and 2007 (n = 295,420), con-
taining information on medically attended infectious diseases according to International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision, codes in quarterly intervals. We calculated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for time to CD
diagnosis by infection exposure, adjusting for sex, calendar month of birth, and number of previous healthcare visits.
CD risk was higher among children who had had a gastrointestinal infection during the first year of life (hazard ratio =
1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.55) and, to a lesser extent, among children who had had a respiratory infection
during the first year of life (hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.43). Repeated gastrointestinal infec-
tions during the first year of life were associated with particularly increased risk of CD in later life. These findings indi-
cate that early gastrointestinal infections may be relevant for CD development.

Recent studies have shown that infections in the first year of
life are associated with increased risk for later celiac disease
(CD) but have not been consistent as to whether respiratory or
gastrointestinal infections are more relevant (1, 2). We investi-
gated associations between types of medically attended infec-
tious diseases and CD in a large population-based cohort. The
main focus of our analyses was on infections during the first
year of life, but we additionally explored associations of CD
with infections up to age 2 years.
METHODS
We used claims data provided by the Kassenärztliche Ver-
einigung Bayerns of all (n = 295,420) statutorily insured in-
fants born alive between 2005 and 2007 in Bavaria, Germany
(92.6% of all live-born children during this period in Bavaria),
from birth to a median age of 8.5 years. These data covered
diagnoses from both primary care and specialized physicians
(e.g., general practitioners, pediatricians, gastroenterologists,
and internal medicine specialists). Diagnoses of medically
attended infectious diseases and CD were obtained using
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10), codes recorded in quarterly calendar intervals (3).
Development of CD was defined by first occurrence of the
ICD-10 code K90.0. The selection and classification of rele-
vant infection diagnoses was done as previously described for
the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) study (4). We distinguished infections by symp-
toms (mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal) and causes
(mainly viral and bacterial) according to their ICD-10 codes
(see Web Table 1 (available at https://academic.oup.com/aje)
for details). Infections with unknown causes were classified
according to their symptoms only. Cox proportional hazards
models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals for time to CD diagnosis according to infection
exposure, adjusting for sex, calendar month of birth, and the
number of previous healthcare visits (as a proxy for comorbid-
ities). Infections were treated as separate, individual binary
covariates with nonexposure to a specific infection as the
referent: 1) during the whole first year of life and 2) in quar-
terly intervals during the first 2 years of life (i.e., we calculated

 a separate Cox model for each infection type—including
“any” infections, i.e., irrespective of symptoms or causes—
and exposure interval). In sensitivity analyses, we: 1) adjusted
all Cox models for the number of previous quarterly inter-
vals with infections of the same type, 2) excluded children
with CD diagnoses recorded in only 1 quarterly interval in
order to reduce the number of potential false-positive cases,
and 3) excluded infections occurring within 12 months prior
to CD diagnosis, to exclude potential bias by symptoms of
undiagnosed CD. Cumulative risks of CD after age 12 months
were compared according to the number of quarterly intervals
with respiratory or gastrointestinal infections during the first
year of life, using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests.
To avoid reverse-causation bias, time at risk for CD was
measured after the respective infection exposure period in
each analysis. Terms for interaction of the respective predictor
variables with time were calculated to check the proportional
hazards assumption. Statistical analyses were conducted using
SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina),
and R, version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). Statistical significance was determined at
the 5% level (2-sided). Data release was approved by the data
protection officer in accordance with the German Guidelines
for Secondary Data Analysis (5).
RESULTS
In total, 853 children (0.29%; 415 (48.7%) boys) were diag-
nosed with CD at a median age of 5.0 years, of which 820
(95.5%) developed CD after the first year of life (see Web
Table 2 for detailed characteristics of study subjects by infec-
tion exposure). In 488 cases (57.2%), CD diagnosis was re-
corded in more than 1 quarterly interval. CD risk was higher
in children who had had a medically attended gastrointestinal
infection during the first year of life (hazard ratio = 1.32, 95%
confidence interval: 1.12, 1.55), accounting for an incidence
rate of 46/100,000 person-years compared to a rate of 34/
100,000 person-years in children without a gastrointestinal
infection. The association was slightly weaker in children who
had had a medically attended respiratory infection during the
first year (hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.04,
1.43), with incidence rates of 38/100,000 person-years and 32/
100,000 person-years in children with and without respiratory
infections, respectively. The proportional hazards assumption
was not rejected for either of the models. These associations
were relatively constant across all quarterly age intervals dur-
ing the first 2 years of life and thereafter, but they could not be
attributed to either viral or bacterial infections only (Figure 1)
and were very similar when we adjusted for previous infec-
tions of the same type (Web Figure 1) or restricted the analysis
to CD diagnoses recorded in more than 1 quarterly interval
(Web Figure 2) or to infections occurring more than 12 months
prior to CD diagnosis (data not shown). Repeated respiratory
and, particularly, gastrointestinal infections during the first
year of life were associated with increased cumulative risk of
CD in later life (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
Medically attended gastrointestinal and respiratory infec-
tions were associated with CD development by age 8 years in
a large, population-based sample. Particularly strong associa-
tions were observed for repeated gastrointestinal infections in
the first year of life. Early gastrointestinal infections may
therefore be relevant for CD development rather than for type
1 diabetes development, for which early respiratory infections
have been found to be more relevant in the same data (3).
Our data are consistent with a similar prospective study
that interrogated infection records, which showed strong
associations of CD with gastrointestinal infections during

 the first 12 months of life (2) and partly also with another in
which a positive association with respiratory infections was
observed (1). It should be mentioned, however, that in these
studies infections were defined based on parental reports (1)
or hospitalization records (2), respectively, indicating different
levels of infection severity compared with our data. Further,
our CD diagnoses could not be validated with data from other
sources, such as questionnaires (1) or pathology reports (2), but
we assume their validity is relatively high, because the diagno-
ses were coded by physicians for the purpose of remuneration
(e.g., to support fees claimed for diagnostic testing). Neither
of the previous studies had data on onset of CD-associated
autoantibodies, so it remains unclear from these findings
whether early infections trigger the disease or rather contribute
to susceptibility. Several mechanisms have been suggested for
early infections to potentially cause CD, including altera-
tions of the microbiome or induction of specific immune
responses, such as type I interferons (6). Our data do support
further investigation of these potential pathways; however,
given that we observed the strongest associations for repeated
gastrointestinal infections—but no major role for either viral
or bacterial infections—our results might suggest that it is a
persistent state of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract
in early life rather than a specific infectious agent that leads to
increased CD risk.
Unfortunately, our data do not contain information about
whether CD diagnosis was based on clinical, serological, and/
or histopathologic findings or about socioeconomic status,
infant feeding, or antibiotic use. These might be potential con-
founders in this context. Further, we investigated several infec-
tion types with different exposure ages, potentially introducing
multiple testing errors.
