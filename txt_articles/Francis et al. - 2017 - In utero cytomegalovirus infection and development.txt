Key Points
• CMV is prevalent in
pretreatment bone marrow
from childhood ALL and not in
acute myeloid leukemia.
• In utero infection with CMV
is a risk factor for ALL
(OR 5 3.71, P 5 .0016)
and is more pronounced
in Hispanics (OR 5 5.90,
P 5 .006).
It is widely suspected, yet controversial, that infection plays an etiologic role in the
development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood
cancer and a disease with a confirmed prenatal origin in most cases. We investigated
infections at diagnosis and then assessed the timing of infection at birth in children
with ALL and age, gender, and ethnicity matched controls to identify potential causal
initiating infections. Comprehensive untargeted virome and bacterial analyses of
pretreatment bone marrow specimens (n 5 127 ALL in comparison with 38 acute
myeloid leukemia cases in a comparison group) revealed prevalent cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection at diagnosis in childhood ALL, demonstrating active viral transcription
in leukemia blasts as well as intact virions in serum. Screening of newborn blood
samples revealed a significantly higher prevalence of in utero CMV infection in ALL
cases (n 5 268) than healthy controls (n 5 270) (odds ratio [OR], 3.71, confidence
interval [CI], 1.56-7.92, P 5 .0016). Risk was more pronounced in Hispanics (OR55.90,
CI51.89-25.96) than in non-Hispanic whites (OR52.10 CI5 0.69-7.13). This is the first
study to suggest that congenital CMV infection is a risk factor for childhood ALL and is more prominent in Hispanic children.
Further investigation of CMV as an etiologic agent for ALL is warranted. (Blood. 2017;129(12):1680-1684)
Introduction
A role for infection in the etiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) has long been hypothesized.1-3 Although many
individual infectious agents and proxies have been investigated,4-8 a
comprehensive untargeted study of possible etiologic viruses and
bacteria has not previously been attempted.
Studies of tumor genetic changes in newborn blood spots
(NBS) provide unambiguous evidence of the presence of ALL ini-
tiation in utero for some subtypes of the disease.9-11 Decreased
interleukin-10 levels at birth in children who later develop ALL12
and more medically diagnosed infections early in life7,13 suggest
that dysregulated immunity plays an etiologic role. Hispanics have
the highest risk of ALL, which appears to be increasing.14 In this
study we seek to answer fundamental etiologic questions: (1) What
infections are unique to childhood ALL in comparison with acute
myeloid leukemia (AML, used here as an immune suppressed
control group at the time of diagnosis)? (2) Are such infections
acquired in utero, and are they risk factors for ALL?
Study design
We conducted two complementary studies, briefly described below (details are
available in the supplemental Materials section, available on the Blood Web site).
Viral and bacterial discovery at diagnosis
We conducted a comprehensive next-generation sequencing-based virome and
bacterial metagenomic analysis in pretreatment diagnostic bone marrow of both
childhood ALL and AML, drawn from the California Childhood Leukemia
Study (CCLS).15 (All data and samples have been approved for use by the

California Childhood Leukemia Study/Protocol 2010-10-2438].)
Two independent patient sample sets were selected from the CCLS (see the
supplementalMethodssection)andinterrogatedusingtwoseparatemetagenomic
methods (Figure 1). The first method used 36 diagnostic bone marrow (BM)
samples from children with ALL and 10 diagnostic BM samples from children
with AML and were examined using virus isolation by ultracentrifugation and
454 sequencing. The second method used total RNA extracted from 91 ALL BM
pooled into 4 groups and 28 AML BM pooled into 2 groups, then sequenced by
Illumina Hi-Seq2500. Data generated from each method were analyzed using
separate custom bioinformatics pipelines that categorized all nonhuman reads
using BLAST (see the supplemental Methods section). Additionally, we used
16s-based bacterial metagenomics on 91 ALL BM and 28 AML BM as a control
for bacterial diversity and differential bacterial contamination of the BM samples
(seethesupplementalMaterialssection).Samplesizewasdeterminedonthebasis
of sample availability and budget constraints.
Viral screen at birth
NBS from 268 ALL cases and 270 cancer-free controls, randomly drawn from
the California Department of Public Health (see the supplemental Methods
section, supplemental Table 2), were screened for 2 herpes viruses identified
in the discovery set at diagnosis (ie, cytomegalovirus [CMV] and Epstein-Barr
virus [EBV]). Viral screen was done by a droplet digital polymerase chain
reaction PCR-based direct-detection method, specifically, ultrasensitive “third-
generation” ddPCR (Figure 1).
Results and discussion
In general, ALL patients were younger than AML patients but were
otherwise demographically similar (supplemental Table 1). A limitation
of our methods is the ability to primarily detect active infections,
although evidence of viruses and bacteria was detected in all
pretreatment bone marrow specimens from both ALL and AML
groups by both Illumina sequencing (supplemental Figures 1-7) and
virus enrichment isolation/454 sequencing. Only herpes viruses
distinguished ALL from AML in both analysis sets; all 4 ALL
Illumina pools expressed CMV transcripts, whereas no CMV
transcripts were detected in AML pools (Figure 2A). Particle
isolation and 454 sequencing showed a greater prevalence of CMV
(OR 5 18, P 5 .003) in individual ALL bone marrow specimens in
comparison with AML specimens (Figure 2B).
We initiated this study with no a priori candidate, following
identification of CMV at diagnosis and given the in utero origins of
ALL.ChildrenwhowentontodevelopALLwere3.71timesmorelikely
to be CMV positive at birth (P 5 .0016) (Table 1). We found suggestive
evidence for statistical interaction between CMV positivity and Hispanic
ethnicity (logistic interaction term P 5 .227). Stratification by Hispanic
ethnicity showed 5.9-fold increased risk of ALL in Hispanics infected
perinatally with CMV (CI 5 1.9, 26.0). The prevalence of CMV in-
fection was higher in whites overall, and an increased risk for ALL was
also demonstrated in this group; however, the result was not statistically
significant (OR 5 2.10; CI 5 0.69, 7.13). We observed no difference in
EBV prevalence at birth between cases and controls (11 positive cases
and 11 positive controls; OR 5 1.01, P 5 1.0). After stratifying by
ethnicity, no significant effect modification was observed (Table 1).
CMV viral load among positive case samples averaged 0.214 copies/ul
and was higher than the CMV viral load among positive control samples
(0.071 copies/ul; supplemental Table 2; P 5 .003). There was no
significant difference in the age at diagnosis between CMV-positive
(meanage,4.8years)andCMV-negative(meanage,5.15)ALLsatbirth.
Several studies of childhood ALL have examined herpes viruses at
diagnosis with conflicting results.5,6 Two previous studies examined

 study examined EBV and HHV-6, in which no association was found,
but did not assess CMV.16 Another screened NBS for CMV from 48
cases and 46 controls yet found no infected children in either group.17
With a significantly larger sample size and a more sensitive assay, we
could detect extremely low quantities of CMV DNA that may other-
wise have been missed. Further replication of our findings is warranted
using higher input volumes of NBS DNA, protein-based detection
methods, and samples from geographically diverse locations.
CMV is a common virus that infects over 90% of adults worldwide.
In the United States, seroprevalence of adult CMV ranges from ;50%
to 80% and is highest in Hispanics and blacks,18 which is particularly
interesting given the high rate of ALL in Hispanics.14 Timing of
infection has important implications. In utero infection with CMV is
a leading cause of birth defects, specifically hearing loss. Although
primary CMV infection during pregnancy yields the greatest risk for
vertical transmission, most women of childbearing age are previously
infected with CMV, and therefore vertical transmission of reactivated
virus accounts for the majority of congenital CMV infections.19 The
presenceofCMVinthechildpriortobirthmayhaveimportantimmune
control implications. Infection prior to the development of a robust
adaptive immune response in the fetus and neonate may affect central
tolerance and enable CMV to persist in an infectious course, unlike the
majority of children who are infected after birth, thus leading to increased
risk of developing ALL.
Two features of CMV infection support a role in oncogenesis in
ALL. First, congenital CMV infection has been noted to cause

exact test (for additional details, see the supplemental Methods section). (B) Results of particle isolation and 454 sequencing from an independent study of 36 ALL and

see the supplemental Methods section). Recovered sequences were assembled into contigs in which alignments to hg19 were removed using Bowtie2. Contigs were then
categorized with a cutoff of E value less than or equal to 1.0 3 E210 using blastn and the refseq viral database. Cytomegalovirus contigs were normalized by recovered contigs
per patient (blast hits/contigs assembled 3 1 3 E3); odds ratios were calculated comparing presence/absence of virus in ALL versus AML patients; P values were computed
using Fisher’s exact test (for additional details, see the supplemental Methods section). CMV was found to be the only virus that showed statistically significant variation

 chromosomal instability, which is suspected to be related to its
teratogenic properties.19 This is of interest in leukemia, because
specific chromosomal lesions are present at birth in children with
ALL.20 Second, CMV has the largest genome of any known human
viral pathogen and harbors many immune evasion genes, indi-
cating that host immune dysregulation is a critical aspect of the
CMV lifecycle. The functions of many CMV genes remain poorly
understood, and it is likely that their genomic complexity is the
direct result of the evolution of latency. Along these lines, CMV has
been hypothesized to be an “oncomodulator” in adult gliomas.21 A
delicate balance has evolved between CMV and the immune
system, which has led to a high population prevalence of the virus
with relatively low morbidity. Nevertheless, disruptions to this
balance can have serious and complex pathologic consequences for
the host.
This study provides a putative candidate for future investiga-
tions. The comparison of ALLs with AMLs was designed solely to
generate a putative agent in ALL and was not matched to race,
ethnicity, or age. Furthermore, the preponderance of lymphoid
versus myeloid cells in the BM samples may bias the results in
relation to viruses with a tropism for B cells. A major limitation in
the dried blood spots (DBS) CMV screen is our lack of information
on ALL subtype and cytogenetic characteristics. Additionally, the
low input quantity of DBS DNA may have resulted in false
negatives, though this may drive results toward the null. Additional
studies defining in utero CMV infection in terms of ALL subtype,
cytogenetics, and overall prevalence are needed.
Our findings lead us to hypothesize that in utero or perinatal CMV
infection initiates immune dysregulation during the critical period of
fetal immune development, allowing a greater number of and more
fulminantinfectionslater inlife,asobservedinepidemiologic studies.7,13
Further validation of our findings is warranted to establish ALL as an
additional reason to develop an effective CMV vaccine.22
