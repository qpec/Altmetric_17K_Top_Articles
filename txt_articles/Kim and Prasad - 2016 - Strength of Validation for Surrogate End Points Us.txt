Abstract
Objective—To determine the strength of the surrogate-survival correlation for cancer drug 
approvals based on a surrogate.
Participants and Methods—We performed a retrospective study of the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) database, with focused searches of MEDLINE and Google Scholar. Among 
cancer drugs approved based on a surrogate end point, we examined previous publications 
assessing the strength of the surrogate-survival correlation. Specifically, we identified the 
percentage of surrogate approvals lacking any formal analysis of the strength of the surrogate-
survival correlation, and when conducted, the strength of such correlations.
Results—Between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014, the FDA approved marketing 
applications for 55 indications based on a surrogate, of which 25 were accelerated approvals and 
30 were traditional approvals. We could not find any formal analyses of the strength of the 
surrogate-survival correlation in 14 out of 25 accelerated approvals (56%) and 11 out of 30 
traditional approvals (37%). For accelerated approvals, just 4 approvals (16%) were made where a 
level 1 analysis (the most robust way to validate a surrogate) had been performed, with all 4 
studies reporting low correlation (r≤0.7). For traditional approvals, a level 1 analysis had been 
performed for 15 approvals (50%): 8 (53%) reported low correlation (r≤0.7), 4 (27%) medium 
correlation (r>0.7 to r<0.85), and 3 (20%) high correlation (r≥0.85) with survival.
Conclusions—The use of surrogate end points for drug approval often lacks formal empirical 
verification of the strength of the surrogate-survival association.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may grant oncology drugs either accelerated 
(provisional) (AA) or traditional (full) (TA) marketing approval.1 Accelerated approvals are 
given based on a surrogate end point that is “reasonably likely to predict” true clinical 
efficacy, ie, survival or quality of life.2–4 Traditional approvals are granted when a drug 
demonstrates “a longer or better life or a favorable effect on an established surrogate for a

 longer or better life.”4 Surrogate end points, thus, play a prominent role in oncology drug 
approvals, with the strength of the surrogate end point guiding the pathway of approval.
When relying on surrogates to guide clinical and regulatory decisions, it is important that the 
surrogate-survival correlation is robust to avoid the approval of toxic drugs with no benefit. 
Bevacizumab received AA in 2008 based on data that it markedly improved progression-free 
survival (PFS).5 However, by 2011, that approval was withdrawn when multiple studies 
found that the drug did not improve overall survival (OS) and carried toxicity and that gains 
in PFS were smaller than initially appreciated.6 In retrospect, the approval and subsequent 
withdrawal of bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer is not surprising given that multiple 
validation studies found that this specific surrogate-survival association is weak.7
The validation of surrogate end points in oncology is an increasingly important field, with 
different statistical methods used.8–12 We favor a clear and simple hierarchy to grade the 
strength of surrogate-survival correlations.7,13 In this model, level 3—the lowest level—
requires the surrogate-survival correlation to be only biologically plausible. Level 2 and 
level 1 analyses require clinical data. Although level 2 analysis shows that the surrogate is 
associated with the final outcome across groups, level 1 analysis addresses the clinically 
relevant question of whether improving the surrogate end point is associated with 
improvements in survival across many randomized studies. Typically, regression analysis is 
performed in level 1 studies. The x coordinate reflects the change in surrogate end point, and 
the y coordinate reflects the change in final end point. Correlation coefficients (r) closer to 1 
signify stronger associations. As such, the validation of surrogate-survival associations in 
oncology exists along an established hierarchy.
We set out to characterize the nature of FDA approvals in oncology from 2009 through 
2014. Specifically, what percentages of approvals were accelerated and traditional? Among 
TAs, what percentage were made based on a surrogate end point? For all approvals granted 
on the basis of surrogates, what is the documented strength of the surrogate-survival 
association? Finally for drugs approved based on surrogates, have subsequent trials 
demonstrated improvements in survival or quality of life? In short, we set out to empirically 
describe the strength of evidence for 6 years of FDA cancer drug approvals.
METHODS
Data Source
The FDA provides a record of hematology and oncology drug approvals and safety 
notifications on their website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/
ucm279174.htm) and in related links. Each relevant webpage was downloaded and is 
provided in the Supplemental Figure 1 (available online at http://
www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). Further information for each approval was obtained from 
the Drugs@FDA website, which includes information regarding the approval of new 
oncology drugs as well as expanded indications for currently approved drugs, date of 
approval, basis of approval, and a summary of the clinical review that supported the 
approval.

 Study Sample
We identified all oncology drugs approved by the FDA between January 1, 2009, and 
December 31, 2014, the last complete year at the time of this investigation. Oncology drugs 
were approved based on improvements in OS or one of the following surrogate end points: 
improvements in disease response rate (eg, hematologic, pathologic, or tumor response) or 
delay in progression (eg, improved PFS or recurrence-free survival). We included data on 
new oncology drugs and on new indications for previously approved oncology drugs.
End Points Extracted
We ascertained the total number of AAs and TAs. We noted the efficacy end point leading to 
approval. When drugs were approved on the basis of improvement in OS or quality of life—
measures of patient-centered benefit—we performed no further investigation. When drugs 
were approved based on a surrogate end point, we investigated formal analyses of the 
surrogate-survival correlation and whether subsequent publications have found an OS 
benefit.
Literature Search
We sought to ascertain the strength of the surrogate-survival correlation. In other words, as 
the criteria for AA and TA based on surrogates are “reasonably likely to predict” and 
“established,” respectively, we sought to evaluate the practical meaning of these terms.
For each surrogate drug approval, we performed a focused review of the literature to identify 
available surrogate-survival association studies. Surrogate association studies are widely 
performed in oncology to assess the strength of the surrogate end points.14 These studies are 
often meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials conducted in the same setting as the 
particular indication of the drug approval. For example, if one wants to know whether PFS 
correlates with OS in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, one begins by collecting 
all randomized controlled trials in this setting. Then one plots whether the hazard ratio or 
change in PFS (x coordinate) predicts the hazard ratio or change in OS (y coordinate). 
Regression analysis is conducted across trials to demonstrate the general correlation between 
the surrogate and survival. For each specific surrogate drug approval identified, we 
performed a review of the literature to locate such analyses. Multiple searches were 
performed, and all the search terms used and databases searched are listed in Supplemental 
Table 1 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). Two CONSORT 
diagrams show (1) the number of articles retrieved and the percentage included for AAs and 
(2) AAs and TAs combined (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3, available online at http://
www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
Grading the Strength of Correlation
We scored the strength of correlation for level 1 studies based on a modification of criteria 
proposed by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care,15 as we have done 
previously7: low correlation (r≤0.7), medium correlation (r>0.7 to r<0.85), and high 
correlation (r≥0.85). The specific cutoff points were adapted to function even when 
confidence intervals were not presented. If coefficients of determination (R2) were given 
instead of correlation coefficients (r), we calculated the r by taking the square root. Where

 multiple level 1 studies existed, the median r was used for scoring. We repeated the analysis 
using the best r, which did not materially change the results (data not shown). We could not 
score level 2 studies because a variety of analyses and reported measures were used.
Subsequent Publications
For all drugs approved on the basis of a surrogate end point, we performed a focused search 
of the published literature to identify subsequent publications that report whether the drug 
improved OS, as we have also done previously, albeit in a set of different years (2008–
2012).16 We credited a drug for improving OS if that drug improved survival in any 
combination (even beyond a combination that received approval) or in any line of treatment 
(eg, if the drug was approved for second line but improved survival in first line, we would 
credit the drug as improving survival). The search terms and databases included are also 
given in Supplemental Table 2 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).
RESULTS
Between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2014, the FDA approved marketing 
applications for 83 oncologic indications: 25 (30%) were AAs and 58 (70%) were TAs. Of 
the AAs, 24 (96%) were based on response rate (or duration of response) and 1 (4%) was 
based on PFS. Of the TAs, 28 (48%) were based on either improved OS or quality of life—
patient-centered end points—and 30 (52%) were based on a surrogate end point, such as 
response rate (7 indications, 12% of TAs) or PFS or disease-free survival (23 indications, 
40% of TAs). Figure 1 shows each approved drug, the year of approval, the indication for 
approval, the pathway for approval (traditional or accelerated), and the clinical end point 
supporting claims of efficacy at the time of approval.
Accelerated approvals are made on the basis of a surrogate that is reasonably likely to 
predict true clinical efficacy. As shown in Figure 2, A, we could not find any formal analyses 
(studies that assessed level 1 or level 2 surrogacy) of the strength of the surrogate-survival 
correlation in 14 drug approvals (56%). In 7 instances (28%), a level 2 analysis (but not a 
level 1 analysis) could be found.17–22 The specific correlations established in those analyses 
are shown in Table 1. In 4 cases (16%), a level 1 analysis had been 
performed,24,25,28–33,41,42 with all studies reporting low correlation (r≤0.7).
When direct patient benefit has not been reported at the time of approval, TAs may be 
granted on the basis of an established surrogate for clinical benefit. Among 30 TAs based on 
a surrogate, we could not find any formal analyses of the strength of the surrogate-survival 
correlation in 11 instances (37%) (Figure 2, B). In 4 cases (13%), a level 2 analysis had been 
performed.19–21,43,44 The specific correlations established in those analyses are shown in 
Table 2. In 15 approvals (50%), a level 1 analysis had been performed to evaluate the 
strength of the surrogate-survival association, with 8 (53%) reporting low correlation 
(r≤0.7),28–33,41,42,45,49–53 4 (27%) reporting medium correlation (r>0.7 to r<0.85),56–59 and 
3 (20%) reporting high correlation (r≥0.85) with survival.46 In only 7 of 30 TAs (23%) did a 
level 1 analysis demonstrate medium or high correlation with survival.46,56,57,59,60

 When an oncology drug is approved based on a surrogate, subsequent studies or longer 
follow-up for ongoing studies may report OS benefits. Table 3 summarizes the results of this 
review of subsequent publications for all marketing indications approved on the basis of a 
surrogate. Although 10 of 55 approvals (18%) were later found to carry an OS benefit, 15 
(27%) were found not to improve OS. Most marketing approvals 30 of 55 (55%) remain 
untested. Traditional approvals based on surrogates were more likely not to show survival 
benefits than AAs (40% vs 12%; P=.02). The use of crossover occurred in 48% of these 
studies and did not vary among trials that found a survival advantage vs those that did not (4 
of 10 [40%] vs 8 of 15 [53%]; P=.52).
Combining the results of the 2 analyses, we find that among 55 drugs approved on the basis 
of a surrogate, 10 (18.2%) have shown OS benefits, and another 2 (3.6%) have not shown 
OS benefits, but were approved on the basis of a high-strength correlation in a level 1 
analysis. Thus, only 12 (21.8%) of 55 surrogate approvals were made on the basis of a 
strong surrogate-survival correlation or later showed OS benefits.
DISCUSSION
We found that most cancer drug approvals (55 of 83 [66%]) are based on a surrogate end 
point. Although the FDA grants TA based on established surrogate end points, this standard 
is lax. Only 3 of 30 such approvals (10%) have shown high correlation in a level 1 surrogate 
analysis, widely considered a prerequisite for clinical or regulatory decisions.15 Of concern, 
11 of 30 TAs (37%) had no formal analyses of the surrogate-survival correlation. 
Accelerated approvals are granted on the basis of a surrogate that is reasonably likely to 
predict clinical benefit; but again, practically, this standard has not been enforced, with 56% 
of approvals (14 of 25) made without any formal analysis of surrogacy.
The frequent use of surrogate end points in FDA approval is paralleled by a rise in the use of 
these end points as the primary end point of clinical trials. Examining randomized controlled 
trials from 1974 through 2009 for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal 
cancer in 5 major journals, PFS increased in frequency as the primary end point of trials 
from 0% (1975–1984) to 20% (2005–2009).61 Sacher et al62 found, in an exhaustive look at 
trials for non-small cell lung cancer, that OS declined as the primary end point of lung 
cancer trials from 97% (1980–1990) to 96% (1991–2000) to 81% (2001–2010). This trend 
was accompanied by a rise in the PFS end point (a surrogate) as the primary end point. The 
improvement of a surrogate end point in oncology can be used to petition for drug 
approval4,63 and to expand clinical guidelines, which in many cases obliges insurers and 
Medicare to cover drugs. It is likely that the validation of surrogate end points in cancer 
would benefit from a formal set of guidelines, as was done decades ago for general statistical 
presentations in medicine.64
There are at least 2 potential reasons why surrogates may not correlate with OS for new 
oncology drugs. The first is that in contrast with OS, where the date of death is precise and 
can be ascertained for all patients, surrogates are prone to reader interpretation, 
measurement error, evaluation bias, and attrition bias.65,66 These artifacts may create 
spurious surrogate benefits. The second explanation is a biological one: a cancer drug with

 favorable surrogate effects may affect changes in tumor growth or aggressiveness or may 
increase off-target deaths.67–70 For these reasons, it is important that a surrogate is validated 
in a precise context (eg, whether disease-free survival correlates with OS for cytotoxic 
agents in the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer). Validation is performed for the unique 
combination of disease setting (adjuvant), tumor type (colorectal), class of agents 
(cytotoxic), and particular surrogate end point (disease-free survival).
Regulatory language appreciates these concerns and allows AA for surrogates reasonably 
likely to predict true efficacy and TA for surrogates that are established. Although there is 
clearly flexibility in this language, we believe that, at a minimum, the language implies some 
previous formal analysis of the surrogate-survival relationships. Yet, in 25 of 55 drug 
approvals based on a surrogate end point, we found no published analysis assessing the 
robustness of the surrogate-survival correlation. Although it is possible that the FDA has 
conducted internal and unpublished analyses in these cases, we consider that unlikely 
because the FDA has announced and published other analyses they have commissioned 
seeking to assess a surrogate.25 Without any formal analysis, we contend that it is incorrect 
to consider a surrogate as established.
Subsequent studies do not lend much clarity to surrogate approvals. In the present analysis, 
we found that less than half of the surrogate approvals (25 of 55, 45%) had a subsequent 
analysis of survival, and, when they did, such analyses concluded approximately 3 to 2 
(15:10) that the drug did not improve survival. The present results regarding subsequent 
trials in the present data set are similar to the fate of drugs approved from 2008 through 
2012, as we reported previously.16
A crossover design was used in 48% of these studies, and they did not vary among trials that 
found a survival advantage vs those that did not. As such, the present data provide further 
evidence to question the common narrative concerning crossover: that it masks OS benefits 
that truly exist.71,72 Alternative explanations include that crossover obscures the fact that 
survival benefits do not exist and prevents the ability to observe late toxicity. Moreover, 
despite crossover, some drugs have shown survival benefits.73
Finally, note that the sizable use of unvalidated (and altogether untested) surrogates to 
approve cancer drugs may further undermine the ability to conduct definitive trials of 
precision medicine. Once drugs are available, patients are naturally reluctant to participate in 
trials assessing their fundamental efficacy. Instead, we increasingly have to rely on case 
reports,74 a notoriously unreliable way to assess claims of efficacy.
There are several limitations to this analysis. Whether an end point is truly a surrogate or a 
measure of clinical benefit continues to be subject to debate in oncology.68 We considered 
improvements in patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, and OS to constitute a patient-
centered benefit and improvements in all other outcomes as surrogate to this. Others may 
believe that under certain circumstances radiographic PFS becomes clinically meaningful. 
However, because this end point includes events that patients may not physically be aware of 
(radiographic progression), as such, we believe that our classification is technically accurate.

 Future research is needed to delineate the relationship between PFS and quality of life across 
tumor settings.
The use of follow-up studies remains inadequate among cancer drugs approved based on a 
surrogate, with 16 of 25 AAs and 14 of 30 TAs lacking a subsequent study reporting on OS. 
Given the recent nature of the drugs we investigated (2009–2014), it is likely that additional 
studies will become available in the future. However, this may be more true among AAs, 
where such postmarketing studies are a requirement for continued authorization, than among 
TAs, which often do not entail further postmarketing efficacy commitments. Thus, it is 
possible that some of the estimates change as future data become available. At the same 
time, it must be acknowledged that the FDA’s enforcement of postmarketing commitments 
has historically been poor75 and that future data will not change the known strength of 
surrogate-survival correlations at the time of approval, which remains the regulatory basis 
for approval.
Another limitation is that although the search strategy for surrogate-survival association 
studies involved the use of 2 search engines, it is possible that we missed such associational 
studies. However, previously we performed an exhaustive mixed-methods search for 
surrogate survival correlations,7 and, thus, we believe that we have captured most such 
papers that exist in the biomedical literature.
A final limitation—not necessarily of the study itself but of the topic that we are studying—
is that surrogate validation studies likely have publication and selective reporting bias. 
Previous work7 has found that few level 1 validation studies (5 of 36) survey both published 
and unpublished trials, and when they do, they are able to retrieve and use data from only 
51.5% of studies. Although this concern does not pertain to situations in which surrogate 
validation studies were absent in the present investigation, it suggests that in situations in 
which validation was present, the strength of correlation may be different based on a more 
comprehensive analysis using all trials conducted on a topic.
CONCLUSION
Most new cancer drugs are approved on the basis of surrogate end points. The standard for 
such approvals is that surrogates are reasonably likely to predict clinical efficacy or 
established in the case of AA and TA, respectively. We found that, practically, this standard 
is lax, with 56% and 37% of AAs and TAs, respectively, based on surrogates made without 
any formal analysis of the strength of the surrogate-survival correlation. Additional follow-
up to existing trials or new trials were unlikely to be completed or to confirm survival 
benefits. The present study suggests that the use of surrogate end points for drug approval 
often lacks formal empirical verification. This practice should be reconsidered.

The strength of evidence between a surrogate-survival correlation for accelerated (A) and 
traditional (B) drug approvals based on surrogate end points. Level 1 studies were scored 
based on a modification to criteria proposed by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in 
Health Care: low correlation (r≤0.7), medium correlation (r>0.7 to r<0.85), and high 
correlation (r≥0.85). No level 1 or 2 means that we could not identify a single association 
study in the literature. Where multiple level 1 studies exist, the median r was used for 
scoring.
