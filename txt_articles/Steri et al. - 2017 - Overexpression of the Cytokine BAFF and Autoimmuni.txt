BACKGROUND
Genomewide association studies of autoimmune diseases have mapped hundreds of 
susceptibility regions in the genome. However, only for a few association signals has 
the causal gene been identified, and for even fewer have the causal variant and underly-
ing mechanism been defined. Coincident associations of DNA variants affecting both 
the risk of autoimmune disease and quantitative immune variables provide an informa-
tive route to explore disease mechanisms and drug-targetable pathways.
METHODS
Using case–control samples from Sardinia, Italy, we performed a genomewide association 
study in multiple sclerosis followed by TNFSF13B locus–specific association testing in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Extensive phenotyping of quantitative immune 
variables, sequence-based fine mapping, cross-population and cross-phenotype analy-
ses, and gene-expression studies were used to identify the causal variant and elucidate 
its mechanism of action. Signatures of positive selection were also investigated.
RESULTS
A variant in TNFSF13B, encoding the cytokine and drug target B-cell activating factor 
(BAFF), was associated with multiple sclerosis as well as SLE. The disease-risk allele was 
also associated with up-regulated humoral immunity through increased levels of soluble 
BAFF, B lymphocytes, and immunoglobulins. The causal variant was identified: an 
insertion–deletion variant, GCTGT→A (in which A is the risk allele), yielded a shorter 
transcript that escaped microRNA inhibition and increased production of soluble BAFF, 
which in turn up-regulated humoral immunity. Population genetic signatures indicated 
that this autoimmunity variant has been evolutionarily advantageous, most likely by 
augmenting resistance to malaria.
CONCLUSIONS
A TNFSF13B variant was associated with multiple sclerosis and SLE, and its effects were 
clarified at the population, cellular, and molecular levels. (Funded by the Italian Founda-
tion for Multiple Sclerosis and others.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
M
ultiple sclerosis and systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) are auto-
immune diseases caused by largely un-
known environmental factors acting in genetical-
ly susceptible persons. Genomewide association 
studies have provided statistical support for more 
than 110 independent signals for multiple sclero-
sis and 43 for SLE.1-3 Although several signals are 
near genes involved in immunologic processes, 
the effector mechanisms for most associations 
remain unknown.
A useful approach to explore disease mecha-
nisms is to search for genetic variants that affect 
both the risk of autoimmune disease and quanti-
tative immune variables such as circulating levels 
of immune-cell populations, immunoglobulins, 
and cytokines.4,5 This approach can reveal disease-
related endophenotypes and is especially infor-
mative when variables are measured in healthy 
persons, avoiding secondary effects of the disease 
and its therapy.4 For such studies, the genetic 
structure of the Sardinian population,6 with 
prevalences of multiple sclerosis and SLE that 
are among the highest in the world,7,8 is likely to 
facilitate the detection of relevant variants missed 
in studies of cosmopolitan populations.6,9,10
A genomewide association scan for risk of 
multiple sclerosis was carried out in Sardinia, 
Italy. We implemented a strategy to follow up 
association signals in other populations and as-
sess mechanisms through the characterization of 
potentially correlated quantitative immune vari-
ables and transcript and expression studies. We 
focused on an association signal in TNFSF13B, 
which encodes tumor necrosis factor superfamily 
member 13b (also known as B-cell activating 
factor [BAFF]). BAFF is a cytokine and drug 
target that is primarily produced by monocytes 
and neutrophils and that is essential for B-cell 
activation, differentiation, and survival.11,12
Methods
Study Sample Sets
Coincident associations were assessed in case–
control sets of 2934 patients with multiple scle-
rosis, 411 patients with SLE, and 3392 controls 
from across Sardinia, as well as in a population 
cohort (SardiNIA study) of 6921 volunteers from 
the Lanusei valley in Sardinia.6,13 Tests of replica-
tion involved the use of case–control sets from 
mainland Italy (2292 patients with multiple scle-
rosis, 503 patients with SLE, and 2563 controls), 
Sweden (4548 patients with multiple sclerosis and 
3481 controls), the United Kingdom (3176 pa-
tients with multiple sclerosis and 2958 controls), 
and the Iberian Peninsula (1120 patients with 
SLE and 1300 controls). All participants provided 
written informed consent.
Genotyping, Imputation, and Variant 
Characterization
A subgroup of 2273 patients with multiple scle-
rosis and 2148 controls from Sardinia were geno-
typed with the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 (574,519 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), and 
6602 SardiNIA volunteers were genotyped with 
four Illumina arrays (OmniExpress, ImmunoChip, 
Cardio-MetaboChip, and ExomeChip; 890,542 
SNPs in total).6,14 A much denser genetic map (up 
to 13.6 million SNPs) was constructed from a ref-
erence panel of 2120 Sardinians who underwent 
whole-genome sequencing and was then propa-
gated (“imputed”) to all genotyped persons.6
Furthermore, at the TNFSF13B locus, we con-
structed a more refined map, which also in-
cluded insertion–deletion variants (indels) called 
by use of the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) 
HaplotypeCaller tool. This locus-specific map 
was used as a reference panel for TNFSF13B locus 
imputation in the case–control and SardiNIA 
cohorts. Custom TaqMan assays were designed 
to genotype variants of interest (rs12874404 and 
an insertion–deletion variant, GCTGT→A, that we 
refer to as BAFF-var) in appropriate Sardinian and 
non-Sardinian samples.
Association Analyses
Genomewide association studies in Sardinian 
multiple sclerosis case–control sets and locus-
specific association studies in the SardiNIA co-
hort were performed as described previously.6,14 
Single-variant follow-up association analyses fo-
cusing on rs12874404 and BAFF-var (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org) used PLINK 
software, version 1.9 (https:/ 
/ 
www 
. 
cog-genomics 
. 
org/ 
plink2). P values and effect sizes for SLE 
were calculated with the use of METAL soft-
ware (http://genome 
. 
sph 
. 
umich 
. 
edu/ 
wiki/ 
METAL_ 
Program). Bonferroni correction for multiple test-
ing was applied to the nominal P value (P 
= 
0.05). 
Conditional analyses for risk of multiple sclero-
sis and for quantitative traits were performed by 
adding either BAFF-var or rs12874404 as a co-
variate to the basic model.

Overexpression of BAFF and Autoimmunity Risk
Immunologic Phenotyping and Serum 
Quantifications in the SardiNIA Cohort
Broad leukocyte types, including lymphocytes, 
neutrophils, and monocytes, were quantified 
with the use of an automated counter in up to 
5937 genotyped volunteers. Flow cytometry was 
used to profile immune-cell subpopulations in 
3669 volunteers, as described previously in a study 
involving a smaller sample.4 In addition, B-cell 
and monocyte subsets were assessed cytometri-
cally in 1902 persons (Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Soluble BAFF was measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
(R&D Systems) in serum specimens from 2733 
SardiNIA volunteers, and levels of IgA, IgG1, IgG2, 
IgG3, IgG4, and IgM were measured by Bio-Plex 
Multiplex Immunoassay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in 
serum specimens from 2898 SardiNIA volunteers.
Transcript Studies
Normalized read counts of TNFSF13B (reflecting 
levels of messenger RNA [mRNA]) and TNFSF13B 
3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) length scores 
were computed from RNA sequencing data from 
leukocyte samples from 606 SardiNIA volunteers, 
and their correlation was assessed with the use 
of the Pearson coefficient. (See the Methods sec-
tion in the Supplementary Appendix.) Mapping of 
expression quantitative trait loci was performed 
with the use of Merlin software (http://csg 
. 
sph 
. 
umich 
. 
edu/ 
/ 
abecasis/ 
Merlin/ 
) and the lmekin() 
function in R Software.
To determine whether the effect of BAFF-var 
on levels of soluble BAFF was fully accounted for 
by effects on transcription, we performed a con-
ditional linear regression analysis of data on 522 
persons for whom both soluble BAFF protein 
levels and RNA sequencing data were available. 
The effect of BAFF-var on soluble BAFF levels, 
with and without TNFSF13B 3′ UTR transcript 
levels, was assessed with a likelihood-ratio test.
MicroRNA Effects on BAFF Expression
Expression studies were performed with primary 
monocytes and HeLa, HEK293T, and THP1 cells. 
Primary monocytes were isolated from peripheral-
blood mononuclear cells by negative selection. 
RNA extraction, complementary DNA prepara-
tion, and quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction 
(PCR) analyses were performed with the use of 
the primers listed in Table S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
In silico prediction of microRNAs (miRNAs) 
targeting the wild-type BAFF 3′ UTR and the vari-
ant BAFF 3′ UTR (nucleotides 2130 through 2582) 
was performed with the use of three prediction 
programs: TargetScan (http://www 
. 
targetscan 
. 
org/ 
), 
miRDB (http://mirdb 
. 
org/ 
miRDB/ 
), and RNA22 
(https:/ 
/ 
cm 
. 
jefferson 
. 
edu/ 
rna22/ 
). The miRNAs 
and related predicted binding sites (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix) were considered for 
further validation. Pull-down assays, miRNA and 
anti-miRNA transfection, Western blot analysis, 
ELISAs, and luciferase assays were used to assess 
miRNA binding and validate BAFF mRNA–miRNA 
interactions.
Differentiation and Positive Selection 
Analyses
To assess positive selection, we used standard 
statistical tests to evaluate allele-frequency differ-
entiation (fixation index15 and population branch 
statistic16) and haplotype diversity (integrated 
haplotype score17 and the number of segregating 
sites by length18) in sequences from 1081 unre-
lated Sardinians as compared with sequences 
from European participants in phase 3 of the 
1000 Genomes Project.19 For any given statistic, 
we calculated a “genomic percentile,” ranking 
BAFF-var relative to 3042 other variants that 
were sampled across the genome and matched 
for minor-allele frequency in Sardinians, local 
recombination rates, and levels of background 
selection.
Results
Association of a Variant in TNFSF13B  
with Multiple Sclerosis
Extending previous work14 with more samples 
and an improved genetic map, we conducted a 
sequencing-based genomewide association study 
involving 2273 Sardinian patients with multiple 
sclerosis and 2148 controls, analyzing approxi-
mately 12.2 million SNPs.6 The SNPs that showed 
a suggestive association (P<5×10−6) (Table S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix) included variant 
rs12874404 near TNFSF13B. This variant is in 
moderate linkage disequilibrium (r2 
= 
0.44) with 
SNP rs9520836, which we previously found to be 
associated with increased numbers of B cells.4 
This locus was thus a strong candidate for 
evaluating coincident associations between dis-
ease risk and endophenotypes and was further 
investigated.
We confirmed the association with multiple

sclerosis at this locus by directly genotyping 
rs12874404 in a sample of Sardinians that in-
cluded the discovery set and some additional 
Sardinians (totaling 2934 patients and 3392 con-
trols) and observing a genomewide significant 
association (odds ratio, 1.27; P 
= 
1.52×10−9). (See 
the Results section in the Supplementary Appen-
dix.) However, we found no association between 
rs12874404 and multiple sclerosis in the case–
control sets from mainland Italy, the United King-
dom, or Sweden (the lowest P value was found in 
the Italian sample [P 
= 
0.51]), even though the 
risk allele was common and sample sizes pro-
vided high statistical power. (See the Results 
section in the Supplementary Appendix.) Thus, 
rs12874404 is unlikely to be the variant driving 
the association.
Because the pattern of linkage disequilibrium 
around rs12874404 differs between Sardinia and 
mainland Europe (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary 
Appendix), we considered whether the signal 
might come from a variant, such as an indel, 
that was not assessed in our initial genomewide 
association study and that was in stronger link-
age disequilibrium with rs12874404 in Sardinia 
than elsewhere. Searching for such variants, we 
found an indel with GCTGT replaced by A, which 
had an r2 of 0.76 with rs12874404 in Sardinia but 
an r2 of only 0.44 among European participants 
in the 1000 Genomes Project (Fig. S1B in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Directly genotyping 
the indel in our Sardinian cohort showed the 
minor allele (A), which we named “BAFF-var,” as 
the variant most strongly associated with multi-
ple sclerosis (odds ratio, 1.27; P 
= 
1.23×10−9) 
(Fig. 1A). Conditional analyses showed BAFF-var 
or rs12874404 completely explaining the asso-
ciation at TNFSF13B, excluding secondary signals 
among the approximately 10,000 variants as-
sessed at the locus. (See the Results section in 
the Supplementary Appendix.)
We further fine-mapped the association 
through cross-population comparisons. BAFF-var 
is especially common across Sardinia (frequency, 
26.5%) and progressively less common in south-
ern Europe (5.7% in Italy and 4.9% in Spain) and 
northern Europe (1.8% in the United Kingdom 
and Sweden). We estimated that we would have 
power to detect an association with BAFF-var only 
in the available Italian samples. (See the Results 
section in the Supplementary Appendix.) By geno-
typing these samples (in which we initially did 
not replicate the rs12874404 association), we 
replicated the association of BAFF-var with risk 
of multiple sclerosis (odds ratio, 1.25; P 
= 
0.01) 
(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). To-
gether, these findings pinpoint BAFF-var as the 
variant in TNFSF13B that is most strongly associ-
ated with multiple sclerosis.
BAFF-var as a General Autoimmunity Variant
BAFF is also a prime candidate for involvement 
in other autoimmune diseases, especially SLE20; 
belimumab, which targets BAFF, has been ap-
proved for the treatment of SLE by the Food and 
Drug Administration.12 We found that BAFF-var 
was associated with SLE in the case–control sets 
from Sardinia (odds ratio, 1.38; P 
= 
4.09×10−5), 
mainland Italy (odds ratio, 1.49; P 
= 
0.002), and the 
Iberian Peninsula (odds ratio, 1.55; P 
= 
3.05×10−4), 
with an odds ratio of 1.44 (P 
= 
6.74×10−10) in a 
combined analysis across all samples (Table S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix). These findings 
indicate that the effect of BAFF-var is not re-
stricted to multiple sclerosis alone.
Associations of BAFF-var with Immune 
Endophenotypes
We next asked whether BAFF-var might also ac-
count for the previously observed associations 
between variants at the TNFSF13B locus and ele-
vated numbers of B lymphocytes.4 Assessing a 
much denser set of markers (including indels) in 
an expanded sample of 3669 persons from the 
Figure 1 (facing page). Regional Association Plots.
Shown are association results in the TNFSF13B region 
for multiple sclerosis (Panel A), B-cell percentage with 
respect to lymphocytes (Panel B), level of soluble B-cell 
activating factor (BAFF) (Panel C), monocyte counts 
(Panel D), length of the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) 
of TNFSF13B (Panel E), and TNFSF13B messenger RNA 
(mRNA) (Panel F). Each panel shows the association 
strength (expressed as negative log10 P values) versus 
the genomic position (on the hg19/GRCh37 genomic 
build), with specifications on genes, exons, and direction 
of transcription shown in the box at the bottom of the 
column. In each plot, BAFF-var is the variant with the 
strongest association. Other variants in the region are 
color-coded to reflect their extent of linkage disequilib-
rium with BAFF-var (taken from pairwise r2 values calcu-
lated for Sardinian haplotypes). Panel A shows results 
for 2273 patients with multiple sclerosis and 2148 con-
trols and for the extended sample (diamonds) of 2934 
patients with the disorder and 3392 controls. Panels B 
through F refer to the SardiNIA study cohort.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
SardiNIA cohort, we found that BAFF-var domi-
nated the association with circulating B cells 
(B-cell counts, P 
= 
4.23×10−12; B-cell percentage 
with respect to lymphocytes, P 
= 
9.36×10−23) 
(Fig. 1B, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). To refine the target-cell type, we carried 
out deeper profiling of six B-cell subtypes. 
Rather than any particular subtype explaining 
the overall B-cell association, several subtypes 
were affected, with CD24+CD27+ (comprising 
unswitched and switched memory) B cells being 
most strongly associated (Table S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Furthermore, BAFF-var dramatically augment-
ed levels of soluble BAFF in SardiNIA volunteers 
(effect size, 0.77 SD; P 
= 
8.47×10−150) (Fig. 1C, and 
Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). It also 
increased levels of total IgG (P 
= 
1.68×10−12), 
IgG1 (P 
= 
2.24×10−14), IgA (P 
= 
7.64×10−9), and IgM 
(P 
= 
4.70×10−8) (Fig. S2 and Table S9 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Finally, we found that 
BAFF-var was also the lead TNFSF13B variant 
(P 
= 
9.07×10−13) associated with reduced mono-
cyte counts in SardiNIA volunteers (Fig. 1D, and 
Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix), with 
the largest effect on “classical” CD14+CD16− 
monocytes (Table S10 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Overall, BAFF-var was the top variant in ge-
nomewide significant associations (P<6.9×10−9),6 
with 18 immune endophenotypes (Tables S7 
through S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
For each of these traits, conditional analysis 
showed that BAFF-var explained the entire as-
sociation at the locus (Table S11 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
We also found that soluble BAFF levels were 
significantly higher in patients with multiple 
sclerosis or SLE than in controls. Furthermore, 
using preclinical samples available for SardiNIA 
volunteers in whom multiple sclerosis developed 
up to 12 years later, we observed elevated levels 
of soluble BAFF before disease diagnosis (Table 
S12 and the Results section in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). We infer that BAFF-var is the 
causal variant driving an increase in soluble 
BAFF and a cascade of immune effects leading 
to increased autoimmunity risk.
Effect of BAFF-var on Levels of Soluble BAFF
The observation that BAFF-var creates an alter-
native polyadenylation motif, AATAAA, from the 
sequence AAT[GCTGT/A]AA prompted the hypoth-
esis that the variant 3′ UTR could raise soluble 
BAFF levels by generating a truncated TNFSF13B 
transcript in the 3′ UTR. Indeed, in 606 se-
quenced leukocyte transcriptomes of SardiNIA 
participants (Fig. 2), BAFF-var correlated with a 
decrease of approximately 35% in the longer 
transcript per allele (P 
= 
8.34×10−86) (Fig. 1E, and 
Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix), an effect 
confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis of pri-
mary monocyte RNA (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Thus, BAFF-var generates a shorter 
TNFSF13B 3′ UTR.
The transcriptome data also implicated BAFF-
var as an expression quantitative trait locus that 
increases TNFSF13B expression (P 
= 
2.37×10−13) 
(Fig. 1F). However, the elevated mRNA levels 
could explain only 24 to 27% of the effect on 
protein (soluble BAFF) levels (Fig. 3A, and the 
Results section in the Supplementary Appendix), 
indicating that an increase in translation level 
was also probably involved. Higher levels of 
BAFF-var protein could be due to the presence of 
miRNA sites in the longer, but not in the shorter, 
3′ UTR that might reduce protein production 
from the longer 3′ UTR.21
We identified in silico candidate miRNA sites 
that were absent from the truncated 3′ UTR 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix) and 
tested them by pulling down miRNA–mRNA 
complexes from THP1 lysates using biotinylated 
RNA probes for the TNFSF13B wild-type 3′ UTR and 
the variant 3′ UTR (Fig. S5A in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The miRNAs in the miR-15/107 
family22 and miR-494 were more enriched in the 
probe for the wild-type 3′ UTR than in that for 
the variant 3′ UTR (Fig. S5B in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), suggesting their preferential inter-
action with the longer 3′ UTR.

expression, overexpression of miR-15a, miR-497, 
and miR-646, but not miR-16 and miR-494, sig-

BAFF protein in THP1 cells (Fig. 3B and 3C). 
One of these miRNAs, miR-15a, is highly ex-
pressed in primary monocytes (Fig. 3D) and thus 
was used in further validation experiments; its 
overexpression did not lower levels of endoge-

production. Further supporting the regulation of

Overexpression of BAFF and Autoimmunity Risk
the use of a locked nucleic acid–anti-miR in-
creased production of soluble BAFF, both in THP1 
cells and in primary monocytes (Fig. 3F and 3G).
To verify that miR-15a directly targets TNFSF13B, 
we cloned the wild-type BAFF 3′ UTR and the 
variant BAFF 3′ UTR into the pmirGLO reporter 
vector (Fig. 4A) and analyzed luciferase activity in 
HeLa cells, which express low levels of miR-15a 
(Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Co-
transfection of miR-15a with pmirGLO wild-type 
BAFF 3′ UTR or pmirGLO variant BAFF 3′ UTR 
substantially reduced reporter levels, whereas re-
porters bearing mutated miR-15a binding sites 
were refractory to repression by miR-15a (Fig. 4B).
Importantly, cotransfection of miR-15a with 
the variant BAFF 3′ UTR reduced reporter activ-
ity to levels similar to those seen for the wild-
type BAFF 3′ UTR with one of the two miR-15a 
sites mutated, probably because one miR-15a site 
is absent from the variant BAFF 3′ UTR. These 
data indicate that BAFF-var raises soluble BAFF 
levels by favoring the production of a shorter 
transcript that is less inhibited by miR-15a. 
However, the higher luciferase activity from 
short reporters than from long reporters — either 
basal or cotransfected with miR-15a after mu-
tating miR-15a binding sites — suggests that 
miR-15a does not fully explain the BAFF-var 
regulatory effects, and other miRNAs or RNA-
binding proteins may also influence soluble 
BAFF levels.
Evidence of Positive Selection on BAFF-var
We next assessed whether the high frequency of 
BAFF-var in the isolated Sardinian population 
(Fig. S8A in the Supplementary Appendix) is 
consistent with the effects of random genetic 
drift acting across the genome or whether it is 
more likely the outcome of selection specifically 
favoring BAFF-var in Sardinia (positive selection). 
We found that BAFF-var has greater differences 
in frequency between Sardinians and Europeans 
than the vast majority of variants matched for 
allelic frequency in Sardinia and for other perti-
nent genetic features (99.97th genomic percentile 
for both fixation index and population branch 
statistic) (Table S13 and Fig. S8B in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). In addition, the core haplo-
type carrying BAFF-var is remarkably longer 
than haplotypes carrying variants with matched 
genetic features (99.91th genomic percentile for 
integrated haplotype score and >99.99th genomic

Panel A shows a box plot of soluble BAFF levels, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in 
serum specimens from 2733 genotyped SardiNIA volunteers, stratified according to genotype. Panel B shows the 
results of Western blot analysis of endogenous BAFF protein in THP1 cells 48 hours after transfection of the mi-
croRNA (miRNA) precursors. Panel C shows BAFF protein expression normalized to HSP90 levels and plotted rela-
tive to the scrambled miRNA control (miR-Ctr). Panel D shows relative miRNA expression in primary monocytes, 
quantified by reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) analysis using U6 RNA as the 
endogenous control. Panel E shows quantification by qPCR of BAFF mRNA levels after miR-15a overexpression in 
THP1 cells, normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. Soluble BAFF levels were measured by ELISA after transfection of 
the locked nucleic acid–anti–miR-15a oligonucleotide into THP1 cells, as shown in Panel F, and into primary mono-
cytes, as shown in Panel G; results were normalized to locked nucleic acid–anti-miR control samples. Data in Pan-
els C through G are the means of at least three independent experiments. I bars represent standard errors. Level of

percentile for the number of segregating sites by 
length) (Figs. S8C and S9A in the Supplementary 
Appendix), a finding consistent with the hypothe-
sis of positive selection for BAFF-var in Sardinia. 
The combination of extreme frequency differ-
ences and long core haplotype suggests that 
BAFF-var has been positively selected,23 most 
likely as an adaptation to a selective pressure 
particularly prevalent in Sardinia.
 
Discussion
Since its discovery, BAFF has been studied in 
animal models,24,25 with an indication for a role 
in autoimmunity from mice that overexpress 
BAFF and have symptoms resembling those of 
human SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome.11 In con-
trast, case–control studies of human autoim-
mune disease that compared levels of soluble 
BAFF in biologic fluids have overall been incon-
clusive. (See the Discussion section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.) Furthermore, previous 
genomewide association studies provided no 
genetic evidence (in large consortium efforts2,26) 
or weak genetic evidence (in a small study27) for 
its role in autoimmune disease. The convergent 
genetic, transcriptomic, and functional evidence 
now supports its effects in autoimmunity. A 
schematic depiction of the effects of BAFF-var is 
shown in Figure 5. Our findings of naturally 
overexpressed BAFF in the general population 
are reminiscent of the large increases in IgM, 
IgG, and IgA in constitutive Baff-transgenic 
mice.11 Furthermore, the lack of association of 
BAFF-var with any of the 153 T-cell traits that we 
assessed (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix) is consistent with the development of auto-
immunity to the same extent in T-cell–sufficient 
and T-cell–deficient Baff-transgenic mice.28 We 
infer that the increased risk of multiple sclerosis 
and SLE associated with BAFF overexpression 
mainly involves humoral immunity, consistent with 
the efficacy of B-cell–depleting therapies.29,30
However, the effects of BAFF-var are broad, 
and the involvement of specific B-cell and im-
munoglobulin subtypes in the pathogenesis of 
multiple sclerosis and SLE remains unclear and 
requires further explication. Moreover, how the 
observed BAFF-var–driven changes in peripheral 
blood relate to effects in mucosal and target 
organ compartments remains unresolved. For 
instance, the reduction in circulating monocytes 
reported here could result from their soluble 
BAFF–driven mobilization or transformation into 
macrophages or dendritic cells at sites of in-
flammation, consistent with findings in mice.31
Alternatively, it may reflect negative feedback in 
response to the enhanced production of soluble 
BAFF in monocytes.
Nevertheless, besides supporting BAFF as a 
target in multiple sclerosis and SLE, our results 
have implications for clinical research. A perti-
nent one, to be assessed in further studies,

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
would be that patients stratified according to 
BAFF-var status might show a differential bene-
fit from anti-BAFF therapies. One might also 
anticipate that patients carrying BAFF-var would 
have a weaker response to B-cell–depleting 
therapies owing to a faster resurgence of mem-
ory B cells.32 In fact, patients with SLE with 
higher basal levels of BAFF have been found to 
have poorer or shorter clinical responses to 
rituximab than those with lower levels.33,34
Our findings also underline the critical bal-
ance between regulation of immune responses 
to defend against infection and possible tissue 
damage from the elicited responses. Such evolu-
tionary trade-offs might be a more general phe-
nomenon, consistent with previous work.4,35
BAFF-var may have been positively selected in 
Sardinia by providing resistance to Plasmodium 
falciparum or P. vivax malaria, both of which were 
strikingly prevalent in Sardinia until their eradi-
cation in the 1950s.36 The malaria-driven selec-
tive pressure to maintain high BAFF levels is 
supported by models of malaria in mice, in which 
BAFF overexpression confers protection against 
lethal malaria infection.37 In addition, as shown 
here, BAFF-var increases antibody production, 
and classic findings showed that antibody trans-
fer from adults with immunity to malaria to 
acutely infected children reduced blood-stage 
parasitemia and disease severity.38
Overall, the evolutionary scenario we propose 
is that BAFF-var was selected as an adaptive re-
sponse to malaria infection, resulting in an in-
creased present-day risk of autoimmunity.

Production, and Cellular Response.
Shown is a schematic depiction of the location of BAFF-var within TNFSF13B 
and its effects on the generation of mRNAs with different 3′ UTR lengths. 
The number and location of miRNA sites, production of soluble BAFF, endo-
phenotypes, and autoimmunity risk are indicated. BAFF-var creates an alter-
native polyadenylation signal that generates a shorter 3′ UTR transcript 
lacking a miRNA binding site. In contrast to the wild-type allele, which is 
associated with long 3′ UTR only, BAFF-var leads to a mixed population of 
mRNAs with long and short 3′ UTRs, resulting in higher production of solu-
ble BAFF. In turn, the increased levels of soluble BAFF lead to higher num-
bers of B cells and immunoglobulins, reduced levels of monocytes, and an 
increased risk of autoimmunity.

clinical trial registration
The Journal requires investigators to register their clinical trials  
in a public trials registry. The members of the International Committee  
of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) will consider most reports of clinical  
trials for publication only if the trials have been registered.  
Current information on requirements and appropriate registries  
is available at www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html.
