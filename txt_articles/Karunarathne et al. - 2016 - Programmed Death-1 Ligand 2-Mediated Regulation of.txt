Blocking the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway is an
important new therapy. Wykes et al.
studied malarial immunity, which is
inhibited by PD-1:PD-L1 axis, to
understand the role of PD-L2. They found
that PD-L2 expression on DCs is essential
for generating enduring Th1 immunity.
Soluble PD-L2 can be an efficacious

SUMMARY
Many pathogens, including Plasmodium spp., exploit
the interaction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) with
PD-1-ligand-1 (PD-L1) to ‘‘deactivate’’ T cell func-
tions, but the role of PD-L2 remains unclear. We
studied malarial infections to understand the contri-
bution of PD-L2 to immunity. Here we have shown
that higher PD-L2 expression on blood dendritic
cells, from Plasmodium falciparum-infected individ-
uals, correlated with lower parasitemia. Mechanistic
studies in mice showed that PD-L2 was indispens-
able for establishing effective CD4+ T cell immunity
against malaria, because it not only inhibited PD-L1
to PD-1 activity but also increased CD3 and inducible
co-stimulator (ICOS) expression on T cells. Impor-
tantly, administration of soluble multimeric PD-L2 to
mice with lethal malaria was sufficient to dramatically
improve immunity and survival. These studies show
immuno-regulation by PD-L2, which has the potential
to be translated into an effective treatment for malaria
and other diseases where T cell immunity is ineffec-
tive or short-lived due to PD-1-mediated signaling.
INTRODUCTION
Malaria is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality,
caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium. In 2015 there
was an estimated 214 million cases of malaria which led to
438,000 deaths (WHO, 2015). Vertebrate hosts become infected
by the bite of mosquitoes, which introduce sporozoites that
infect hepatocytes, which then release merozoites to infect red
blood cells. It is the blood-stage infection that causes the
potentially lethal effects of malaria. Much effort has gone into
developing vaccines for malaria but success has been limited,
highlighting our incomplete understanding of immunity against
this disease.
The components of the immune system responsible for elim-
inating blood stage Plasmodium parasites remain unclear,
although antibodies play a key role (Cohen et al., 1961). Studies
in experimental rodent models of malaria have shown that CD4+
T helper cell-1 (Th1)-immune responses are critical for protection
against acute blood-stage malaria (Su and Stevenson, 2002),
while CD8+ T cells have a role in controlling chronic disease
(Horne-Debets et al., 2013). Furthermore, several groups have
shown that dendritic cell (DC) functions are compromised during
malaria (Wykes and Good, 2008). We have previously shown
that naive mice transfused with DCs from micewith non-lethal ma-
laria,butnotlethalmalaria,survivesubsequentinfectionwithlethal
malaria (Wykes et al., 2007). These studies thus establish that sur-
vival from malaria depends on the functional capacity of DCs.
Many studies have shown that pathogens including protozoan
parasites such as Plasmodium spp., bacteria, viruses including
HIV, and tumor cells exploit the PD-1 pathway to evade the
host’s adaptive immunity (Day et al., 2006; Gubin et al., 2014;
Horne-Debets et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2009). The engagement
of PD-1 by its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, normally inhibits T cell
functions to induce tolerance and to control the expansion and
function of foreign antigen-specific T cells (Brown et al., 2003;
Latchman et al., 2001). PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed on a va-
riety of cells, and expression on DCs, as well as other cell types,
downregulates T cell immune responses (Brown et al., 2003;
Freeman et al., 2000).
Field studies in malaria-endemic Mali have shown increased
expression of PD-1 on T cells in malaria-infected individuals
compared to control subjects, implicating PD-1 in immune
evasion (Butler et al., 2012; Illingworth et al., 2013). PD-1-deficient

 C57BL/6J mice (Pdcd1�/�; Nishimura et al., 2001) rapidly and
completely clear non-lethal (P. chabaudi) chronic malaria unlike
wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (Horne-Debets et al., 2013). Com-
bined blockade of PD-L1 and LAG-3 immuno-inhibitory mole-
cules with antibodies accelerate clearance of acute non-lethal
blood-stage malaria (P. yoelii) by improving CD4+ T cell functions
and increasing antibody titers (Butler et al., 2012). Blockade of
PD-L1 during lethal malaria (P. berghei) also enhances T cell func-
tions but results in an unfavorable outcome in that model, as T cell
hyperactivity promotes cerebral disease (Hafalla et al., 2012).
However, blockade of PD-L2 does not affect immunity against
P. berghei malaria (Hafalla et al., 2012), suggesting that the two
PD-1 ligands function differently during malarial infections.
The relevance of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-
L1 in immunity against cancer and infectious diseases has
been extensively studied and therapeutic approaches targeting
PD-1 and PD-L1 are in the clinic. In contrast, the role of PD-L2
in modulating immune responses is less clear. The goal of this
study was to comprehensively investigate the role for PD-L2
in regulating immunity against malaria. Our studies revealed
PD-L2 regulates the PD-1-PD-L1 interaction and has potential
to be used as a therapy for malaria.
RESULTS
PD-L2 Expression on DCs Inversely Correlates with
Malaria Severity in Humans
TodeterminewhetherPD-L1andPD-L2influencedmalarialimmu-
nity, we infected seven malaria-naive, healthy human volunteers
with 1,800 P. falciparum infected red cells (pRBC) and their blood
was examined before and 7 days after challenge. We examined
DCs, defined by CD11c expression, in view of their important
roleinmalariapathogenesis(Wykesand Good,2008)and because
PD-L1 and PD-L2 on DCs can downregulate immune responses
by T cells (Brown et al., 2003). In all seven volunteers, �90% of
DCs expressed PD-L1 before infection, and there was no signifi-
cant change to the percentage of DCs expressing this ligand by
day 7 of infection (Figure 1A). In contrast, while �80% of DCs
also expressed PD-L2 before infection, 5 of 7 individuals showed
a significantly reduced (17%–57%) percentage of PD-L2+ DCs at
day 7 of infection (Figure 1B). Notably, we observed a significant
inverse correlation between parasitemia and the ratio of percent-
age PD-L2 to PD-L1 expression on DCs at day 7 post-infection
(p.i.) (Figure 1C). Overall, contrary to the generally perceived role
of PD-L2 as an immune inhibitor, we observed that higher fre-
quencies of PD-L2-expressing DCs were associated with lower
parasitemia in volunteers after infection with P. falciparum.
PD-L2 Expression on DCs Inversely Correlates with
Malaria Severity in Mice
To understand the biological relevance of these data, we next
investigated four mouse models of malaria. We chose four
different species and strains of Plasmodium that infect mice,
with each showing distinct biology and pathogenicity. When
WT mice were infected with non-lethal P. yoelii 17XNL or
P. chabaudi, and the blood was examined every 1–3 days for
parasites, the infection progressed at different rates, but both
groups cleared the infection within �30 days (Figure 1D). In
contrast, WT mice infected with P. yoelii YM or P. berghei
ANKA showed severe but distinct disease courses (Figure 1E;
monitored as per Tables S1 and S2). P. berghei parasitemia is
low compared to P. yoelii YM infections because P. berghei-in-
fected RBC sequester from the blood into deep tissues including
the brain, leading to lethal cerebral disease. However, all P. yoelii
YM and P. berghei-infected mice had to be euthanized within
10 days when the clinical score was R4 (Tables S1 and S2).
We examined surface expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on DCs
from the spleen, which has been shown to be a major site of
parasite killing and regulation of parasite-specific immune re-
sponses in mice (Yadava et al., 1996). Approximately 70% of
CD11c+ DCs in the spleens of naive mice expressed PD-L1
and this percentage increased in P. berghei and P. chabaudi-
infected mice but not during lethal or non-lethal P. yoelii infec-
tions (Figure 1F). PD-L1-expressing DCs did show increases
in surface expression (mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) of
PD-L1 following all four malarial infections compared to DCs
from naive mice, with non-lethal P. chabaudi-infected mice
showing the greatest increase (Figure 1G and Figures S1A–
S1F). In contrast, <5% of splenic DCs from naive mice expressed
PD-L2. This differed from human blood DCs that predominantly
expressed PD-L2, which most likely reflects their different origins
from blood and spleen. Furthermore, the percentages of PD-L2+
DCs increased during all malarial infections with greater percent-
ages found in mice with non-lethal than lethal malaria (Figure 1H
and Figures S1A–S1E). The MFI of PD-L2 expression on PD-L2+
DCs also increased in mice infected with all but P. berghei para-
sites, compared to DCs from naive mice (Figure 1I and Figures
S1A–S1F). Finally, CD11c+ DCs from lethal and non-lethal
P. yoelii malaria showed similar increases in the amounts of
PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA (Figure S1G) suggesting that the differ-
ence in PD-L2 between these parasites (Figure 1H) is dependent
on post-transcriptional regulation or protein localization. Of note,
DCs from lethal and non-lethal P. yoelii infections had the same
surface expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 and mRNA but differed
in percentages of PD-L2+ and not PD-L1+ DCs. Overall, the re-
sults from all infections are consistent with a hypothesis that a
higher percentage of PD-L2+ DCs correlates with a favorable dis-
ease outcome.
PD-L2 Is Required for Survival and Parasite Control
To determine the contribution of PD-L2 to the control of malarial
parasites, we next examined the outcome of P. yoelii 17XNL
infection in Pdcd1lg2�/� mice (PD-L2 deletion on a C57BL/6J
background) (Liang et al., 2006) compared with WT mice. All
WT mice cleared the infection within 27 days (Figure 2A). How-
ever, the Pdcd1lg2�/� mice had higher parasitemias than WT

 mice after day 13, and all of these mice died or had to be eutha-
nized by day 19 (Figure 2A and Figure S2A) due to clinical scores
R 4 (Figure S2B). Thus, PD-L2 expression is required for parasite
control and survival from infection with P. yoelii 17XNL.
To confirm this observation, we next blocked PD-L2 with a
monoclonal antibody when parasites became detectable in
the blood. For this experiment, WT mice were infected with
P. yoelii 17XNL and given either anti-PD-L2 or control rat immu-
noglobulin G (IgG), 4 days p.i. and every 3–4 days until day 14–18
p.i. All WT mice that received rat IgG survived and cleared the
infection within 32 days (Figure 2B and Figure S2C). In contrast,
100% of infected mice that were given the PD-L2 blocking anti-
body died or were euthanized by day 19, due to severe symp-
toms (Figure S2D), although the degree of parasite control was
similar between groups (Figure 2B and Figure S2C). This was
in contrast to Pdcd1lg2�/� mice, which had significantly higher
parasitemia after day 13 (Figure 2A) suggesting either that the
antibody did not completely inhibit function, or that 4 days of
PD-L2 function, before blockade, partially improved immunity.
To further explore the role of PD-L2 in protection against
another non-lethal infection, we infected WT mice with non-lethal
P. chabaudi malaria and treated with either anti-PD-L2 or rat IgG
(Figure 2C and Figure S2E) as for P. yoelii 17XNL experiments.
Mice from both groups survived but blockade of PD-L2 signifi-
cantly increased parasitemia during the acute infection (day 8;
note log scale), led to generally higher parasitemia during the
chronic phase of infection (> day 21) and delayed parasite clear-
ance by 4 days (arrow indicates parasite clearance in rat IgG-
treated mice; Figure 2C). Overall, these protection and survival
studies showed that PD-L2 expression was required for better
control of non-lethal malarias and survival from P. yoelii 17XNL
malaria.
PD-L2 Improves Parasite-Specific CD4+ T Cell
Responses in Mice
Wenextfocusedonunderstandingwhymicedid notsurviveinfec-
tion with non-lethal P. yoelii 17XNL when PD-L2 was blocked. We
therefore repeated the above blocking experiments and collected
spleens at days 7 and 14 for evaluation by multiple immuno-
assays. First, CD4+ T cells were examined for the expression of
Tbet, a transcription factor required for effector functions of Th1
CD4+ T cells, which are known to mediate protection against
malaria. T cells were also evaluated for expression of CD62L, a
marker found on naive T cells and which also distinguishes central
memory (CD62Lhi) from effector memory (CD62Llo) T cells (Fig-
ure S2F). Compared to naive mice (day 0; Figure 3A), there was
a significant increase in numbers of Tbet-expressing CD62Lhi
CD4+ T cells per spleen by day 7 (Figure 3B; p < 0.0095) in control
mice given rat IgG but not mice with PD-L2 blockade (Figure 3B;
p > 0.05). By day 14, the control mice had 2.2- and 3-fold more
Tbet-expressing CD62Lhi and CD62Llo CD4+ T cells per spleen,
respectively, than the mice given anti-PD-L2 antibody (Figure 3C).
Similarly, control mice had > 5-fold higher numbers of interferon-g
(IFN-g)-secreting, parasite-specific CD4+ T cells at day 14 as
measured by responses to parasite antigen MSP119 in culture,
than mice with PD-L2 blockade (Figure 3D). An in vitro EdU-
uptake assay confirmed that control mice had higher numbers
of parasite-specific CD4+ T cells which proliferated in response
to parasite antigen (Figure 3E). However, the concentrations of
serum IFN-g were not affected by PD-L2 blockade (Figure 3F).
In contrast, mice with PD-L2 blockade had >2-fold more serum
interleukin-10 (IL-10) than control mice by day 14 (Figure 3G).
This result correlated with a significant increase in numbers of
regulatory T cells (Treg) per spleen seen with PD-L2 blockade
compared to control treated mice (Figure 3H).
Studies with P. yoelii 17XNL-infected Pdcd1lg2�/� mice also
found significantly lower numbers of Tbet-expressing and IFN-
g-secreting, parasite-specific CD4+ T cells per spleen at day
14 compared to infected WT mice (Figures S2G and S2H).
Finally, there was no reduction in IFN-g-secreting, parasite-spe-
cific CD8+ T cells per spleen at day 14 in infected Pdcd1lg2�/�
mice or infected mice given anti-PD-L2 blocking antibody
compared to infected WT mice (Figure S2I).
Overall, our data show that PD-L2 expression is necessary for
effective Th1 CD4+ T cell responses against P. yoelii 17XNL ma-
laria. Given that a higher ratio of PD-L2 to PD-L1 expression on
DCs was associated with lower parasitemia and blockade of
PD-L2 resulted in reduced CD4+ Th1 cell responses, we hypoth-
esized that PD-L2 might inhibit PD-L1 functions that were
reported to inhibit Th1 cell responses (Liang et al., 2006). Further-
more, PD-L2 blockade caused mortality in mice infected with
P. yoelii 17XNL but not P. chabaudi malaria. In alignment,
PD-L1 to PD-1-mediated immune suppression was previously
shown to be greater during the acute phase of P. yoelii 17XNL
(Butler et al., 2012) than P. chabaudi malaria (Horne-Debets
et al., 2013). As such, we conclude that PD-L2-mediated

 inhibition of PD-L1 to PD-1-mediated immune suppression
could explain the different outcomes of PD-L2 blockade be-
tween the two infections.
PD-L1 and PD-L2 Co-expression on DCs Determine
Immunity
We next undertook DC-transfer studies to establish whether PD-
L1 expression on DCs was responsible for lethality of malaria. To
do so, WT and Pdcd1lg1�/� mice (PD-L1 deletion on a C57BL/6J
background) were infected with lethal P. yoelii YM malaria, DCs
isolated at day 7 p.i. (Figure S3A) and transferred to naive mice,
which were then infected with lethal P. yoelii YM malaria. While
100% of mice given DCs from WT mice had to be euthanized
within 10 days due to clinical scores R 4, all mice given DCs
from Pdcd1lg1�/� mice survived (Figure 4A) and cleared the
infection (Figure S3B). This transfer study showed that PD-L1
on DCs was mediating lethality as mice given DCs with abundant
PD-L1 but little PD-L2 (see Figure 1F, H and Figure S1D) did not
survive, while all mice given Pdcd1lg1�/� DCs survived.

tail (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). See also
Figure S2.
We then infected WT and Pdcd1�/�
mice (PD-1 deletion on a C57BL/6J back-
ground) with lethal P. yoelii YM to confirm
that the PD-1 pathway was responsible
for the lethality of P. yoelii YM malaria.
While 100% of WT mice had to be
euthanized by day 10 due to clinical
scores R 4, all Pdcd1�/� mice survived
(Figure 4B) and cleared the infection (Fig-
ure S3C) confirming that the PD-1 pathway
was driving lethality of P. yoelii YM infec-
tions. Overall, these studies showed PD-1
and PD-L1 mediate lethality of malaria.
Given that PD-L2 expression was associated with survival
from malaria, we next examined how PD-L2 co-expression
with PD-L1 on DCs could modulate immunity. A previous study
has shown that the interaction between PD-L1 on DCs and
PD-1 on CD8+ OTI T cells contribute to ligand-induced T cell
receptor (TCR) down-modulation (Karwacz et al., 2011). We
thus investigated whether PD-L2 co-expression with PD-L1
on DCs could inhibit PD-L1-mediated downregulation of TCR
and ICOS expression. To do so, we cultured purified DCs
and T cells from infected mice (1:5 cells), with antibodies to
block PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2 functions and examined the
T cells after 36 hr for high expression of CD3, a component
of the TCR, and high ICOS expression which can indicate
T cell activation (Figures 4C–4H). Blockade of PD-1-signaling
to T cells with anti-PD-1 antibody in DC: T cell cultures
significantly increased the expression of CD3 and ICOS, indi-
cating PD-1 signals downregulated expression of these mole-
cules on T cells (Figures 4E and 4H). When PD-L1 signals were
blocked with antibody, leaving only PD-L2 to function, T cells
Immunity 45, 333–345, August 16, 2016

 had significantly increased ICOS and CD3 expression (Figures
4F and 4H). In contrast, when PD-L2 was blocked, leaving
PD-L1 function intact, there was a significant loss of CD3
and ICOS (Figures 4G and 4H). Overall, these findings show
that in the context of cells from P. yoelii 17XNL-infected
mice, PD-L1 expression on DCs is likely to inhibit T cell activa-
tion, whereas PD-L2 appears to promote CD3 and ICOS
expression.

 PD-L2 Can Out-Compete PD-L1 for PD-1 Binding
To further understand the differential effects of PD-L1 and
PD-L2, we undertook biochemical studies using surface plas-
mon resonance (SPR) technology with dimeric ligands, as a
previous study showed PD-L1 has a dimeric structure (Chen
et al., 2010). We used recombinant mouse PD-L1 and PD-L2
attached to human immunoglobulin-Fc fusion proteins, which
formed dimers due to the intrinsic property of the Fc portion
of immunoglobulin, and measured their affinity for PD-1. Using
immobilized PD-1, we found that mouse PD-L1 had a KD value
of 251 nM (Figure 5A and Figure S5A) while PD-L2 (Figure 5B
and Figure S5A) had a 1.7-fold higher affinity of 148 nM, in
agreement with values reported previously (Ghiotto et al.,
2010; Youngnak et al., 2003). PD-L2 had a moderately faster
on rate (8.4 3 103 1/Ms) than PD-L1 (5.6 3 103 1/Ms) for
PD-1 binding but similar off rates (1.1 3 10�3 versus 1.2 3
10�3 1/s respectively).
As a previous study reported that PD-L1 and PD-L2 competed
for PD-1 binding (Ghiotto et al., 2010), we examined DCs from
non-lethal malaria for PD-L1 and PD-L2 co-localization by
microscopy. We observed PD-L2 labeling in locally enriched
macroclusters, which co-localized with MHC class II in general
(arrows in Figure 5C and Figure S4A). This explained how
PD-L2 was positioned near MHC class II to affect CD3 expres-
sion (Figure 4) located within the TCR. Importantly, these
macro-clusters of PD-L2 could also co-localize with PD-L1 (Fig-
ure 5C and Figure S4B) or were punctate (arrow head in Figure 5C
and Figure S4C). In contrast, PD-L1 expression was generally

punctate, dispersed across the whole
cell and co-localized with or adjacent to
MHC class II (noted by rust or orange co-
lor; Figure 5C and Figure S4D). In approximately 30% of DCs,
PD-L1 also co-localized with MHC class II into thick ring-like
structures (Figure S4E). Thus, enriched local concentrations of
PD-L2 located within MHC class II synapses, positioned along-
side PD-L1, has the potential to compete with PD-L1 for PD-1
binding, to prevent the immunosuppressive functions of PD-L1
on antigen-specific T cells.
We thus hypothesized that large aggregated forms of PD-L2,
like those found within a macrocluster on DCs, would compete
with PD-L1 for binding to PD-1. To test this hypothesis, we bio-
chemically multimerized this dimeric PD-L2 as described in
the supplemental experimental procedures section (hereafter
referred to as sPD-L2 as it is a soluble form). Using immobilized
PD-1, we found multimeric sPD-L2 had a �9-fold higher affinity
(16.8 nM) for mouse PD-1 (Figure 5D and Figure S5A) than
dimeric PD-L2.
We next tested whether multimeric PD-L2 could inhibit PD-L1
binding to PD-1. Using immobilized PD-L1, we compared the
binding of PD-1 in buffer alone and in the presence of sPD-L2.
PD-1 showed similar binding kinetics to immobilized PD-L1
(Figure 5E and Figure S5B) as in Figure 5A. However, the interac-
tion between PD-1 and PD-L1 was inhibited by > 80% in the
presence of multimeric PD-L2 (Figure 5E), confirming that PD-
L2 could out-compete PD-L1 binding to PD-1. Taken together,
these data provided the proof of concept that sPD-L2 is capable
of reducing PD-L1 binding to PD-1 (Figure 5), which could thus in
theory prevent PD-L1-mediated lethality in vivo during malaria
infection (Figure 4A).

 Multimeric PD-L2 Inhibits PD-L1-Mediated Lethality
We hypothesized that multimeric sPD-L2 would outcompete PD-
L1 for binding to PD-1 on Th1 cells and thus reduce the suppres-
sive effects of PD-L1 on T cell functions. To test this, we infected
WT mice with lethal P. yoelii YM or P. berghei and administered
sPD-L2 on day 3, after parasitemia(s) were measurable and then
on days 5 and 7 p.i. All WT mice infected with P. yoelii YM and
treated with control human IgG (Control Ig) died or had to be
euthanized within 10 days (Figures 6A and 6B). Similarly, dimeric
PD-L2 did not offer any protection from increasing parasitemia
(Figure S6A). In contrast, 92% of P. yoelii YM-infected mice
(N = 12) treated with sPD-L2 survived and cleared the infection
in 25 days with fewer symptoms (Figures 6A–6C). All of the sur-
viving mice were rested until day 150 and re-challenged with the
same dose of lethal P. yoelii YM malaria (no additional sPD-L2
was administered; Figure 6A) along with new age-matched,
naive control mice (Control Ig-R). All of the mice previously
treated with sPD-L2 survived re-infection with no symptoms,
and only 4/8 mice showed any parasitemia, as shown by a log
scale in the Figure 6A inset. Within 20 days of re-infection,
80% of these sPD-L2-treated, re-infected mice had completely
cleared the infection, as the transfer of 200 ml of blood from these
mice to naive mice did not transfer the infection (Figure S6B). In
comparison, the second set of age-matched control mice suc-
cumbed to the infection, confirming the lethality of the parasite
used for re-infections (Figure 6B). Overall, multimeric PD-L2
could overcome PD-L1 mediated lethality following infection
with P. yoelii YM.

Significance of survival was analyzed using Log-
rank (Mantel-Cox) test. See also Figure S6.
Similarly, 100% of control mice in-
fected with P. berghei developed experi-
mental cerebral malaria symptoms (ECM;
Table S2) within 8 days (Figure 6D) and
succumbed to the infection by day 10
(Figure 6E). Only 22% of the P. berghei-
infected mice treated with sPD-L2 devel-
oped cerebral malaria as seen by their
ECM scores (Figure 6D). Furthermore, the surviving mice
controlled the infection for approximately 20 days (Figures 6E
and 6F), before succumbing 13 days after the last dose of sPD-
L2. Additional doses did not improve survival (data not shown).
In summary, the administration of multimeric sPD-L2 significantly
improved survival from lethal infections and reduced the severity
of the clinical symptoms, especially for cerebral malaria.
Soluble PD-L2-Mediates Survival from Lethal Malaria by
Improving CD4+ T Cell Responses
To determine the contribution of T cells to sPD-L2-mediated sur-
vival from P. yoelii YM malaria, we depleted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells
in sPD-L2-treated, infected mice. For this experiment, multiple
groups of WT mice were infected with P. yoelii YM and treated
with sPD-L2 or human IgG (hIg), as in Figure 6A. These mice
were also given CD4+ or CD8+ T cell-depleting antibodies or
rat Ig on day 1 and every 3–4 days until day 14–18 p.i. Previous
studies confirmed that the antibodies used would deplete these
cells. All of the infected WT mice that received hIg and rat Ig died
or required euthanasia by day 14 (Figure 7A and B). In contrast,
75% of the P. yoelii YM-infected mice given sPD-L2 and control
rat Ig cleared parasitemia within 30 days and survived > 50 days,
when monitoring was stopped (Figures 7A and 7B). However,
mice were not protected by sPD-L2 if CD4+ T cells were depleted
(Figures 7A and 7C) and had to be euthanized due to severity of
clinical symptoms. In contrast, depletion of CD8+ T cells did not
significantly affect the protective effect provided by sPD-L2,
although these mice had consistently higher parasitemia around

 days 11–21 than control mice (Figures 7A and 7D). Taken
together, these findings demonstrate that sPD-L2 can promote
survival and parasite control from P. yoelii YM infection through
CD4+ T cells with a possible minor contribution from CD8+
T cells.
PD-L2 Mediates Protection by Improving CD4+ Th1
Responses
To determine how sPD-L2 exerts its therapeutic effects, we
treated P. yoelii YM-infected mice with control Ig or sPD-L2 on
days 3 and 5 and collected the spleens at day 7 before the onset
of severe clinical symptoms in the control mice. T cells were
isolated from spleens and cultured with spleen DCs from naive
mice and parasite-specific antigen (MSP119) or peptide (Pb1,
EIYIFTNI; Lau et al., 2011) or no additional antigen. Treatment
with sPD-L2 increased the number of parasite-specific CD4+
T cells that could respond to MSP119 in culture, with �2.7-fold
higher numbers of IFN-g secreting CD4+ T cells than the mice
treated with control Ig, as measured by an ELISPOT assay (Fig-
ure 7E). Similarly, an in vitro EdU-uptake assay confirmed that
sPD-L2-treated mice had higher numbers of parasite-specific
T cells which proliferated in response to parasite antigen (Fig-
ure 7F). However, there was no difference in the number of
TREG cells between cohorts (Figure 7G). Furthermore, the sPD-
L2-treated mice also exhibited 6-fold higher numbers of para-
site-specific CD8+ T cells (i.e., that bound MHC tetramer [Db]
displaying the parasite-specific peptide Pb1; Howland et al.,
2013) than the control group (Figure 7H). However, there was
no increase in IFN-g secretion (Figure 7I) or granzyme B expres-
sion (Figure 7J) by these cells within 7 days. Similarly, there was
no significant increase in serum IFN-g in response to sPD-L2,
(Figure 7K). Taken together, these results show that sPD-L2
protects mice from lethal malaria by promoting development of
IFN-g secreting effector CD4+ T cells, known to be crucial
for protection against malaria. Similarly, the increased CD8+
T cells potentially explained the modest improvement in protec-
tion seen in mice treated with sPD-L2 around days 11 to 21
(Figure 7D).
DISCUSSION
This study has shown that PD-L2 is essential for establishing
effective Th1 CD4+ T cell immunity, which protects against lethal
malaria. First, we found that PD-L2 but not PD-L1 expression
on human blood DCs changed significantly in response to
P. falciparum infections. Unexpectedly, a higher ratio of PD-L2
to PD-L1 expressing-DCs correlated with reduced parasitemia.
Mechanistic studies utilized four mouse models of malaria to un-
derstand the biological significance of changes in PD-L2 expres-
sion. These studies found that while PD-L1 expressed by DCs
attenuated immune responses, PD-L2 co-expression regulated
immune responses by (1) inhibiting the binding of PD-L1 with
PD-1 and (2) increasing CD3 and ICOS expression on T cells.
These two functions were so significant, that administration of
soluble multimeric PD-L2-Fc fusion protein alone was sufficient
to mediate survival of mice from patent lethal malaria and mice
then survived re-infections without additional sPD-L2. Thus,
we have identified a layer of immune regulation of the PD-L1
with PD-1 interaction and shown a therapeutic strategy for ma-
laria and other diseases susceptible to immune checkpoint
modulation.
Survival from malaria requires a balance between the control
of parasitemia and pathology generated by immune responses.
We now show that while percentages of PD-L1+ DCs are rela-
tively unchanged during malaria, changes in PD-L2 expression
by DCs determine disease severity as higher expression of PD-
L2 on DCs enhances protection from this disease. A deleterious
role for the PD-L1-PD-1 axis on protection against malaria has
been demonstrated by us (Horne-Debets et al., 2013) and others
(Butler et al., 2012; Hafalla et al., 2012). PD-L1 has a pivotal role
in inducing Treg development and sustaining their functions
(Francisco et al., 2009), regulating Th1 cell differentiation (Liang
et al., 2006) as well as limiting pathology during infections (Muel-
ler et al., 2010). However, PD-L2 blockade with antibody during
non-lethal malaria resulted in reduced T-bet-expressing Th1
cells, increased Treg cell numbers, increased systemic anti-in-
flammatory IL-10, and death due to severe clinical symptoms
associated with pathology. These findings highlighted opposing
roles of PD-L1 and PD-L2. However, it is unclear why PD-L2 is
differentially upregulated on DCs from lethal and non-lethal ma-
laria. Type I IFN signaling of cDCs has been reported to reduce
PD-L2 expression on DCs during lethal P. berghei malaria (Ha-
que et al., 2014) but we have previously shown non-lethal
P. yoelii 17XNL malaria has higher concentrations of this cyto-
kine than lethal P. yoelii YM malaria (Wykes et al., 2007). Thus,
regulation of PD-L2 expression is complex and requires further
investigation.
It is generally believed that PD-L1 and PD-L2, which cannot
bind PD-1 simultaneously (Ghiotto et al., 2010), will have the
same immuno-inhibitory outcome. However, we have demon-
strated that multimeric PD-L2 can out-compete PD-L1 for
PD-1-binding. To understand how PD-L2-PD-1 binding might
influence immune responses, we compared the effects of selec-
tively blocking PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed by DC on previously
activated T cells in culture by examining CD3 and ICOS expres-
sion. We found that blocking PD-L2 signals (PD-L1 function
remains) reduced CD3 and ICOS expression while blocking
PD-L1 signals (PD-L2 function remains) improved ICOS and
CD3 expression. This is consistent with a higher ratio of PD-L2:
PD-L1 expression on DCs initiating protective immunity. One
crucial point of difference between PD-L1 and PD-L2 is that
PD-L1 not only inhibits T cell immunity by binding to PD-1, but
can also bind to CD80 (Butte et al., 2007), which can also prefer-
entially recruit CTLA-4 into the immunological synapse (IS)
(Pentcheva-Hoang et al., 2004). Thus, PD-1-PD-L1 binding
might also co-recruit CD80 (and CTLA-4) into the IS. In contrast,

two-sided tail (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). Data represent two independent experiments that obtained similar results.

 preferential recruitment of PD-1 by PD-L2 might exclude CD80
(and CTLA-4) recruitment into TCR clusters, to reduce the inhib-
itory microenvironment surrounding the TCR while recruiting
CD3 and ICOS. Therefore the effects of PD-L2 binding PD-1
can be vastly different to the PD-L1 with PD-1 interaction as
shown by our study. Furthermore, blocking PD-L1 and leaving
PD-L2 free to bind PD-1 increased ICOS and CD3 expression
compared to PD-1 blockade. This suggests that PD-L2 does
not act merely to compete with PD-L1, but could have an addi-
tional stimulatory action via a separate receptor, as previously
suggested (Liu et al., 2003; Shin et al., 2003).
Remarkably, we showed that three doses of multimeric PD-L2
given to mice with lethal malaria supported the development of
robust CD4+ T cell responses that mediated survival from
P. yoelii YM infection. These mice then survive re-infections after
150 days with no requirement for additional PD-L2, showing that
sPD-L2 administration allowed the development robust long-
term protective immunity. In fact, 80% of re-infected mice
developed immunity effective enough to completely clear the
lethal parasites without patent parasitemia, highlighting that
sPD-L2 supports the development of complete immunity.
Consequently, sPD-L2 has potential to treat acute infections
such as malaria or other diseases where PD-L2 has been down-
regulated during the immune response, and promote the devel-
opment of an effective memory response, which is protective
against later exposure.
The interaction of PD-L2 with PD-1 on T cells regulates the bal-
ance between T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology
(Keir et al., 2008). Recent studies have found that PD-L2 can also
bind RGMb expressed by normal resting lung interstitial macro-
phages and alveolar epithelial cells to regulate respiratory toler-
ance (Xiao et al., 2014). PD-1 and PD-L1 are important members
of coinhibitory pathways, which are becoming a major focus of
cancer immunotherapy. We now show that PD-L2 has a vital
role in modulating immunity against malaria, an observation
that might be relevant to a range of diseases where T cell immu-
nity is ineffective or short-lived due to a reduction in PD-L2
expression.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Study
The method for conduct of the clinical trial (McCarthy et al., 2011)
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02389348) and the PCR method used to
quantify parasitemia (Rockett et al., 2011) are described in detail elsewhere.
Each participant gave informed consent. Seven of eight healthy volunteers
(N = 4 males and N = 3 females) aged 19–55 years (median age, 24 years
[interquartile range, 21–37]) who participated in a study to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the experimental antimalarials OZ439 and DSM265 separately
consented to participate in this sub-study, nested within the clinical trial.
This study was approved by the QIMR Berghofer, Human Research Ethics
Committee. Volunteers received approximately 1800 P. falciparum pRBCs
via intravenous injection in 2.0 ml of saline. On day 7, the day designated
for commencement of treatment, participants were admitted to the study
unit and administered the investigational antimalarial drug treatment after
blood was collected for the study.
Blood Collection and Processing
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from hep-
arinized blood by density centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharma-
cia Biotech), before inoculation and on day 7 p.i. before drug treatment. The
PBMCs were labeled for multicolor flow cytometry to exclude lineage+ cells
but to include viable HLA-DR+ cells, and determine expression of PD-1 ligands
on CD11c+ DC.
Mice
Specific pathogen-free C57BL/6J (WT) femalemice8–12 weeks of age were ob-
tained from the Animal Resources Centre (Perth, Australia). Mice were housed in
the QIMR animal research facility. All procedures were approved and monitored
by the QIMR AnimalEthicsCommittee (approval number A0209-622M) inaccor-
dance with the ‘‘Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for
scientific purposes’’ (NHMRC, Australian). Pdcd1�/� mice were kindly provided
by Dr. T. Honjo through the Riken BRC (Nishimura et al., 2001). The Pdcd1lg2�/�
(Liang et al., 2006), Pdcd1lg1�/� (Liang et al., 2006), and Pdcd1�/� mice used in
these studies, were confirmed to have the gene deleted by PCR testing and flow
cytometry. The sample size was estimated based on previous studies with
similar assays, using the same parasites. For experiments with multiple groups,
all mice were first infected and then randomly assigned into treatment groups.
No blinding was undertaken.
Parasitic Infection and Monitoring
Cohorts of 3–6 WT mice were infected intravenously with 105 P. yoelii 17XNL,
105 P. chabaudi AS, 104 P. yoelii YM, or 104 P. berghei ANKA parasitized red
blood cells (pRBCs) freshly obtained from previously infected C57BL/6J mice.
These parasite doses were previously shown to give patent parasitemia
around the same time. Tail-tip blood films were made every 1–2 days, stained
using the Quick Dip modified Wright-Giemsa stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and examined for parasitemia, for up to 60 days. The percentage of pRBCs
was assessed by counting at least 300 RBCs during parasitemia > 1% and
20 fields with �10,000 cells at other times. The mean percentage parasitemia,
shown in several figures, is the mean percentage pRBC of total RBC, from in-
dividual mice in a group. Mice were monitored daily for anemia, and physical
symptoms of disease, including posture (hunching), lack of activity, and fur
texture. Mice were euthanized if they showed signs of distress as described
in Tables S1 and S2.
Flow Cytometry
Standard protocols were used. Please refer to the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for details on antibodies used and methods.
DC Transfer Study
CD11c+ DC were obtained from spleens of WT and Pdcd1lg1�/� mice infected
with 104 P. yoelii YM (lethal) pRBC. Four days after infection, mice were treated
with 250 mg Pyrimethamine given by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injections daily for
4 days to clear the infection. At day 7, the spleens were digested and DC en-
riched using Dynal DC enrichment kit. Samples were run on the AutoMACs to
remove residual Dynal labeled cells and hemozoin. Highly purified DCs were
obtained by labeling DCs with anti-CD11c MACS beads and isolated on
AutoMACS. Approximately 1.5 3 107 DC were then transfused intravenously
to naive mice. After resting the mice for > 15 hr, they were infected with a lethal
dose of P. yoelii YM (104 pRBC). Mice were followed for 48 days when moni-
toring was stopped.
DC–T Cell Cultures
Mice were infected with 105 P. yoelii 17XNL pRBC and on day 14 p.i., spleens
were digested and total T cells isolated using CD90.2 MACS beads, to mini-
mize any effect on the TCR. DCs were isolated from remaining spleen cells us-
ing Dynal DC enrichment kit. Approximately 106 T cells were cultured with 2 3
105 DCs in > 3 replicate wells. Control or blocking anti-PD-1 (RMP1-14), anti-
PD-L1 (10F.9G2) or anti-PD-L2 (TY25) antibodies were added to cultures at
20 mg/ml. After 36 hr culture, cells were washed and labeled for flow cytometry.
CD3 and ICOS expression was assessed on viable CD4+CD62LloPD-1+ T cells.
Surface Plasmon Resonance
Please refer to the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Microscopy
DCs from day 7, P. chabaudi-infected mice, were placed on poly-L-lysine
coated slides as cyto-spins or in chamber slides. Slides were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde and labeled with fluorescent-antibodies.

 In Vivo Depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells and Blocking Studies
For depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, anti-CD4 antibody (500 mg; clone
GK-1.5; BioXcell), anti-CD8b antibody (500 mg; clone 53.5.8; BioXcell), or con-
trol rat IgG (500 mg; BioXcell) were administered by i.p injections, on day �1
and then every 3–4 days for 14 to 18 days. Mice were infected on day 0.
Notably, CD8+ T cells express CD8a and b chains while CD8+ DCs express
two CD8a chains. As such, depletion of CD8b+ cells only depletes CD8+
T cells. Previous control studies showed that T cell-depleting antibodies
cleared > 99% of the respective T cell populations. For PD-L2 blocking
studies, 250 mg per mouse anti-PD-L2 (clone Ty25; BioXcell) was given by
intra-peritoneal injection, 4 days post-infection (p.i.) and every 3–4 days until
days 14–18 p.i. sPD-L2 treatment was given i.v. on days 3, 5, and 7 and human
IgG as a control.
Assays to Measure Peptide-Specific IFN-g Production
PVDF micro plates (Millipore), were coated according to the manufacturer’s
directions using the Mouse IFN-g ELISPOT Ready-SET-Go kit (eBioscience).
Please refer to the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details and
modifications.
