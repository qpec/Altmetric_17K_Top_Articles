SUMMARY
The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is implicated in habit
formation. However, the DLS circuit mechanisms un-
derlying habit remain unclear. A key role for DLS is to
transform sensorimotor cortical input into firing of
output neurons that project to the mutually antago-
nistic direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways.
Here we examine whether habit alters this input-
output function. By imaging cortically evoked firing
in large populations of pathway-defined striatal
projection neurons (SPNs), we identify features that
strongly correlate with habitual behavior on a sub-
ject-by-subject basis. Habitual behavior correlated
with strengthened DLS output to both pathways as
well as a tendency for action-promoting direct
pathway SPNs to fire before indirect pathway
SPNs. In contrast, habit suppression correlated
solely with a weakened direct pathway output. Sur-
prisingly, all effects were broadly distributed in
space. Together, these findings indicate that the
striatum imposes broad, pathway-specific modula-
tions of incoming activity to render learned motor
behaviors habitual.
INTRODUCTION
Habit formation is a fundamental adaptive mechanism drawn
upon daily to provide efficiency for common behaviors (Graybiel,
2008; Yin and Knowlton, 2006). Mechanisms underlying habit
formation are also thought to be co-opted by drugs of abuse
and disrupted in numerous neuropsychiatric diseases involving
compulsivity (Gerdeman et al., 2003). Habits arise from goal-
directed learning as a particular behavior becomes automated
with repetition and its performance becomes less dependent
on the outcome. As demonstrated by behavioral assays de-
signed to assess the mode of behavioral control, the transition
from goal-directed to habitual behavior, as well as the mainte-
nance of habit, requires dorsolateral striatum (DLS) (Furlong
et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2004, 2006). Habit formation is also
accompanied by altered in vivo activity (Desrochers et al.,
2015; Rueda-Orozco and Robbe, 2015; Tang et al., 2007) in
this region.
While the DLS is strongly implicated in habitual behavior,
habit-related activity changes have also been described in
afferent cortical regions (Coutureau and Killcross, 2003; Gremel
and Costa, 2013). This observation highlights a key ambiguity in
our understanding of the neural encoding of habit: are behavior-
ally salient features locally encoded in the striatum? Or, is the
habit-related striatal activity observed in vivo driven by afferent
cortical activity? To address these questions, it is necessary to
isolate the DLS contributions to habitual behavior independently
of changes in cortical activity. In support of the idea that DLS
circuitry might locally store habit-related information, studies in
brain slices have found long-lasting changes in synaptic and
intrinsic membrane properties of projection neurons in mice
extensively trained on a nose-poke task with chronic cannabi-
noid exposure (Nazzaro et al., 2012), a lever press task (Shan
et al., 2015), and on a rotarod task (Yin et al., 2009). However,
no clear model for how DLS plasticity alters striatal output has
emerged from these observations.
One approach to address these issues is to directly monitor
striatal output using calcium imaging to report firing activity
(Smetters et al., 1999). By performing such experiments in brain
slices under conditions that include contributions of glutamater-
gic synapses, GABA-ergic synapses, and intrinsic membrane
properties along with experimenter-controlled activation of
cortical inputs, one can elucidate how local DLS circuit plasticity
modifies striatal output in habit. We therefore sought to develop
such an approach using vector-mode two-photon laser-scan-
ning microscopy (2PLSM) calcium imaging to measure cortico-
striatal input-output relationships in DLS as a function of habitual
behavior in individual mice.
At the circuit level, the DLS is known to integrate incoming
action-related information from sensorimotor cortices into firing
of striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which constitute its two
output pathways. Historically, these pathways have been re-
garded as mutually antagonistic, with the direct (striatonigral)
pathway facilitating and the indirect (striatopallidal) pathway

 inhibiting movement (Albin et al., 1989; DeLong, 1990). Optoge-
netic manipulations of direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) and indirect
pathway SPNs (iSPNs) support this model (Kravitz et al., 2010,
2012). However, recent observations that both pathways are
concurrently activated with action initiation (Cui et al., 2013),
and that balanced activity between pathways is necessary for
normal movement (Tecuapetla et al., 2014), have led to an up-
dated model of basal ganglia function in which dSPNs facili-
tate voluntary movement while iSPNs concomitantly suppress
competing, unintended motor programs (reviewed in Calabresi
et al., 2014 and Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014). To examine the cir-
cuit contributions of DLS to behavior, we further developed our
approach to enable simultaneous measurement of activity of
both SPN types. We identified pathway-specific DLS SPN firing
properties that robustly predicted how habitually individual sub-
jects behaved in a lever press task. These findings indicate that
local DLS plasticity mechanisms are sufficient to drive habit-
related changes in DLS output and further illustrate how the
direct and indirect pathways contribute to behavior.

under random reinforcement schedules
designed either to retain goal-directed
behavior (random ratio [RR]) or to induce
habit formation (random interval [RI])
(Dickinson et al., 1983; Hila
´ rio et al.,
2007) (Figures 1A and 1E). A defining
feature of habitual behavior is its persistence when the value of
the outcome is reduced (Dickinson, 1985). To evaluate habitual
behavior, we pre-fed mice ad libitum with sucrose pellets to
devalue the outcome specifically associated with the lever press
just before a 3 min extinction ‘‘probe’’ test in which no reward
was delivered and measured the effect of pre-feeding on lever
press rate (LPr). To control for general satiety, we pre-fed mice
grain pellets prior to the same test on a different day (Figure 1A).
To minimize confounds from the probe test experience, we set
its duration similar to periods during which mice occasionally
received no reward during random reinforcement training
(3 min no-reward bouts per session: RR = 1.44 ± 0.26, n = 17;
RI = 1.36 ± 0.43, n = 14). To minimize any effects from the gap
in daily training during probe tests, we re-exposed mice to an
additional lever press training session after devaluation testing
and prior to ex vivo analysis of DLS circuit properties. Habitual
behavior was quantified in individual animals by comparing de-
valued LPr (pre-fed sucrose) to non-devalued LPr (pre-fed grain).
This metric, referred to here as normalized devalued LPr, repre-
sents the tendency for an animal to persist in reward-contingent
behavior despite devaluation of reward and is expressed as
log2ðdevalued LPr=non­devalued LPrÞ.
As expected, RI reinforcement induced habit formation more
effectively than RR reinforcement (t(28.81) = 2.21, p < 0.05) (Fig-
ure 1F). Although RR subjects pressed at a higher rate than RI
subjects on the final training session prior to devaluation testing
(t(23.90) = 4.5454, p < 0.001), subjects’ learned rates (measured
on R6, Figure 1E) were unrelated to their degrees of habitual
behavior (r(29) = �0.12, p > 0.05, n = 31). This result shows

 that the measure of normalized devalued LPr for habit is not influ-
enced by general lever pressing rates.
Although RI subjects were more habitual than RR subjects on
average, there was considerable overlap between groups for in-
dividual subject behavior (Figure 1F). We took advantage of this
overlap by merging RI and RR groups to form a continuous spec-
trum of habitual responding. We reasoned that if local DLS circuit
plasticity significantly contributed to habitual behavior, then
changes in the DLS response to cortical activity should correlate
with quantitative behavioral measures of habit. To investigate
this hypothesis, we evaluated the relationship between habitual
lever pressing and ex vivo properties of cortically evoked SPN
firing in individual subjects.
Action potential activity was imaged in dozens of SPNs per
animal with defined cell type using 2PLSM, calcium indicator
dye fura-2, AM, and BAC transgenic Drd1a-tdTomato reporter
mice (RRID: IMSR_JAX:016204) (Ade et al., 2011) (Figures 1B–
1D). By imaging with a calcium indicator that fluoresces at
resting calcium levels to identify all loaded cells and by taking
advantage of the high fidelity of the Drd1a-tdTomato reporter

Strengthened DLS Output and a
Shift in Latency to Fire between
Pathways Predicts Habitual
Behavior
We observed strong, positive correlations
between
the
amplitude
of
stimulus-
evoked SPN calcium transients and the
degree to which mice were habitual.
This was true in both dSPNs and iSPNs
(Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, SPN spike probability did
not correlate with habitual behavior (Figures 2D–2F). Because
event amplitude corresponds to the number of action potentials
underlying a calcium transient (Figures S1F and S1G), and
because spike probability did not predict habitual behavior,
our data suggest that habit is encoded in the DLS as an inte-
grated readout of burst firing rather than a binary code of
whether or not SPNs fire at all. Finally, comparison of data
from slices from the least and most habitual mice revealed
the surprising finding that habit-related differences in event
amplitude were broadly distributed spatially throughout the
imaged populations, rather than in discrete clusters (Figures
2J and 2K).
While increased event amplitude predicted habit expression in
SPNs of both pathways, the balance of activity between dSPNs
and iSPNs as measured by event amplitude was unrelated (Fig-
ure 2C). In contrast, we found that habitual behavior strongly
correlated with a shift in the relative timing between dSPNs
and iSPNs. Specifically, dSPNs tended to fire before iSPNs in
habitual mice and iSPNs fired before dSPNs in goal-directed

 mice (Figure 2I). Absolute latency to fire did not correlate with
habitual behavior for either SPN type, only relative timing (Fig-
ures 2G and 2H). Thus, we found evidence that pathway imbal-
ance contributes to habitual behavior but in the unexpected
domain of timing.
We next examined whether factors other than habit could simi-
larly explain our findings. As mentioned, normalized devalued
LPr isolates the behavioral insensitivity to outcome devaluation
from absolute rates of lever pressing. Therefore, we predicted
that lever press rates alone should not drive the observed corre-
lations. Indeed, a correlational analysis using LPr instead of
normalized devalued LPr failed to find relationships with any
measures of DLS corticostriatal output (Figures S2A–S2I).
Consistently, lever press rates did not correlate with degree of
habitual behavior either (r(29) = �0.14, p > 0.05, n = 31). To
further test whether lever press rates alone were sufficient to
drive the correlations that we identified, we trained a separate

that

than our data indicate.
Weakening of Direct Pathway Output Predicts
Suppression of Habitual Behavior
We next sought to identify the DLS circuit properties associated
with learning to suppress a habit. To do this, we first induced
habitual lever pressing in all subjects by increasing the total num-
ber of RI and RR training sessions (extended training groups
RIext and RRext, Figure 3A). With enough repetition, an RR
schedule can also induce habitual responding (Dickinson,
1985). To control for features related to learning to suppress
lever pressing independent of habit, we trained a third group un-
der conditions optimized for goal-directed responding (short-
ened training group RRshort, Figure 3A). LPr was then reduced
by omission training in which each lever press resulted in tempo-
rary withholding of an otherwise periodically delivered reward

475
 (Figure 3A). This paradigm trains the animal to suppress lever
pressing in order to receive a reward. After omission training,
lever pressing behavior was reinstated to isolate learned sup-
pression from any acute effects related to decreased lever press
activity (Figure 3A). Suppression of lever pressing was quantified
as the percent decrease in LPr relative to the last random rein-
forcement session before omission training began (% LPr
omitted). RRext (n = 5) and RIext (n = 6) groups had no significant
differences in omission behavior (F(1,9) = 1.29, p > 0.05) and,
consistent with habitual responding (Rossi and Yin, 2012),
were significantly more resistant to omission training compared
to the RRshort group (n = 8) (F(1, 17) = 24.38, p < 0.001)
(Figure 3B).
We found a strong negative correlation between suppression
of lever pressing in the final omission session and dSPN event
amplitude and spike probability. This was true of the combined
RIext/RRext cohort (Figures 3C, 3E, 3G, and 3H) but not the
RRshort group (dSPN amplitude r(5) = 0.19, p = 0.69, n = 7;
dSPN spike probability r(5) = 0.13, p = 0.78, n = 7). Notably, other
habit-predictive features did not correlate with suppression in
either the habitual cohort (RIext/RRext) (Figures 3D and 3F) or
the goal-directed cohort (RRshort) (iSPN amplitude r(5) =
�0.12, p = 0.80, n = 7; dSPN/iSPN latency ration r(5) = �0.36,
p = 0.43, n = 7). No correlations with pathway balance were
observed for any of the measured SPN firing properties (Figures
3F, S4D, and S4E). Lastly, because the correlations were not
shared by the goal-directed group, decreased direct pathway
output in the DLS is specific for suppression of habitual behavior.
DISCUSSION
Here we have found that changes in local DLS processing of
incoming cortical activity to generate projection neuron firing
correlate with habitual behavior. While other brain regions are
likely to contribute behaviorally relevant information, the fact
that DLS corticostriatal input-output features alone were suffi-
cient to strongly predict habitual behavior shows that this brain

region plays a crucial role in the expres-
sion of habitual behavior. Additionally,
our results suggest for the first time that
habits may be expressed and suppressed
through separate, pathway-specific processes. It is notable that,
despite some differences between the substrates for habit
expression and suppression, a general circuit logic favoring
action unifies our findings.
Taken together, our findings support a model in which habit
expression is characterized by an increased gain in both DLS
output pathways and a shift in their relative timing such that firing
of dSPNs precedes that of iSPNs. On the other hand, habit sup-
pression correlates solely with reduced dSPN firing (Figure 4A).
Notably, dSPN event amplitude predicted habit suppression in
a near-perfect inverse of its correlation with habit expression
(mexpression = 1.1 and msuppression = �0.96; Figure 4B), whereas
iSPN event amplitude predicted habit expression but was sur-
prisingly unrelated to suppression (Figure 4C). These data sug-
gest that habits are not broken by a simple undoing of the forma-
tive process but through different mechanisms. Such a view is
consistent with the finding that motor memory reversal can occur
through new learning processes that are separate from those un-
derlying formation of the same memory (Boyden and Raymond,
2003).
Our finding that an increase in gain of both types of SPNs cor-
relates with habitual lever pressing is in accord with recent in vivo
observations that a transient increase in activity of both path-
ways is associated with action initiation (Cui et al., 2013). Simi-
larly supportive is the observation that synaptic strength of
both dSPNs and iSPNs is increased in rotarod-trained mice
(Yin et al., 2009). Interestingly, an increase of corticostriatal
gain has been hypothesized to hasten the onset of action at
the cost of outcome errors, as predicted by a model for
increased corticostriatal efficacy in a visuomotor discrimination
task (Lo and Wang, 2006). Such a mechanism would be consis-
tent with our findings and could potentially explain the relative
insensitivity of habitual behavior to outcome value.
Whereas a symmetrically heightened event amplitude was
observed in SPNs of both pathways, we found evidence for a
timing imbalance between the direct and indirect pathways.
Specifically, dSPNs tended to fire before iSPNs in the most
476

 habitual mice, whereas in the most goal-directed mice, iSPNs
tended to fire before dSPNs (Figure 2I). This somewhat unex-
pected finding is in accord with recent evidence for a timing
competition between the direct and indirect basal ganglia path-
ways as a mechanism for action cancellation (Schmidt et al.,
2013). In that study, Schmidt and colleagues showed that, to
successfully cancel an action, the subthalamic nucleus (STN)
must excite the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) before
striatal dSPNs can inhibit the SNr response to STN input. Here
we find evidence that long-lasting, local DLS plasticity might
contribute to such an overall basal ganglia circuitry timing
competition. Specifically, a short dSPN latency to fire relative
to iSPN latency could allow dSPNs to preempt stop-related
SNr activity that is driven by iSPNs through a globus pallidus ex-
ternus-mediated disinhibition of the STN, thereby reducing the
probability of action cancellation.
Additionally, a systematic difference in the timing of firing be-
tween SPN types is not ostensibly explained by a model in which
dSPNs promote one action and iSPNs inhibit other actions; such
a model would seem to necessitate parallel processing of
competing action plans rather than a competition between path-
ways. Rather, the timing advantage of the direct pathway SPNs in
habit is more readily explained by a model in which expression of
a given learned behavior would be promoted in habit by biasing
the relative timing between output pathways to favor the direct
pathway.Interestingly,wefoundevidencetosupportacorrelation
between habit and relative, but not absolute, latencies to fire (Fig-
ures 2G–2I). We suspect that this distinction relates to the addi-
tional experimental variability that is imposed by electrode place-
mentin brain slicesandhighlights an advantageof simultaneously
monitoring direct and indirect pathway SPNs. Elucidating the
underlying cellular and microcircuit mechanisms for such timing
differences is an exciting future direction that could suggest novel
pharmacological targets to manipulate habit.
Similar to our findings for timing in habit expression, we found
that the DLS substrate for suppressing a habit was pathway spe-
cific. Although at first estimation one might hypothesize a role for
an increase in indirect pathway activity with action suppression,
our finding that weaker direct pathway activity positively corre-
lated with habit suppression is also consistent with decreased
drive for voluntary action (Cui et al., 2013; Sippy et al., 2015; re-
viewed in Calabresi et al., 2014 and Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014) or
for action in general (Albin et al., 1989; DeLong, 1990). It was
somewhat unexpected that DLS substrates for suppression of
lever pressing manifested in habitual but not goal-directed sub-
jects. This result indicates that mechanisms for suppressing a
habitual and goal-directed behavior are distinct. However,
because goal-directed behaviors are typically associated with
the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) (Yin et al., 2005, 2009), we sus-
pect that similar mechanisms in principle might occur here. In
support of this possibility, synaptic modifications have been
found in the DMS of goal-directed mice (Shan et al., 2014; Yin
et al., 2009).
Likewise, while the design of our study allowed us to identify
predictive DLS circuit substrates for habit expression and sup-
pression, the particular formative processes that gave rise to
these substrates represent an important area for future studies.
For example, since our findings describe a behavioral continuum
from goal-directed to habitual responding, it would be interesting
to know whether plasticity solely occurred in subjects that
became habitual or whether there was also DLS circuit plasticity
that shaped goal-directed responding. It has been proposed that
action-outcome (goal-directed) and stimulus-response (habit)
associations form in parallel through separate circuits where
stimulus-response
associations
eventually
gain
control
of
behavior over time (Everitt and Robbins, 2005). If this were the
case, then DLS output may begin to change well before a habit
is noticeably expressed and the plasticity underlying goal-
directed behavior may persist separately as the behavior be-
comes more habitual.
Finally, perhaps most surprising is the observation that habit-
related SPN firing properties were broadly distributed in space.
Given that previous in vivo studies have identified discrete sub-
sets of DLS neurons as task related (Desrochers et al., 2015;
Tang et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2009), one might expect habit-related
plasticity to occur only in subsets of neurons, i.e., those SPNs
related to the lever press task. Instead, our findings indicate
that an interaction between the broad DLS circuit modifications
we describe and specific action-related inputs may ultimately be
necessary to generate the specificity of habit for some behaviors
and not others. According to such a model, a broadly distributed
‘‘habit engram’’ in the DLS could serve to bias an overall compe-
tition between the direct and indirect pathways toward action
execution. If it is the case that patterns of incoming cortical ac-
tivity represent specific actions and that the striatum broadly
tunes how SPNs respond to such input, then one might predict
that forming one habit would influence the likelihood that
other actions become habitual. Indeed, the observations that al-
coholics displaying compulsive drug-seeking behavior also
demonstrate an overreliance on habit learning for other behav-
iors (Sjoerds et al., 2013) and that repeated ethanol exposure
leads to a generalized increase in DLS control over Pavlovian
learning (DePoy et al., 2013) support such a possibility. Thus,
we conclude that, as opposed to a model in which the DLS alone
encodes specific habitual actions, our data favor a model in
which broadly distributed changes in the DLS circuitry alter the
propagation of cortical activity related to specific actions
through the basal ganglia to render behaviors habitual.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Detailed methods are in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. 2- to
4-month-old hemizygous Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice (Ade
et al., 2011) in C57Bl/6 background were trained in Med Associates operant
chambers and behavioral data were recorded by Med-PC-IV software. After
training, acute brain slices were prepared using cutting and holding solutions
that promote survival of brain tissue from adult and aging animals (Ting et al.,
2014). Slices were bulk loaded with cell-permeable fura-2, AM. SPN action po-
tential firing in response to electrical stimulation of cortical afferents was moni-
tored using vector-mode 2PLSM (Nikolenko et al., 2007). Data were analyzed
using automated custom MATLAB software. Experiments and data analysis
were performed with experimenter blind to training schedule.
