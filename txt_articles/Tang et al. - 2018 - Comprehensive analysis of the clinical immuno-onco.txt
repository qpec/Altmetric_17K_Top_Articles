Advances from immuno-oncology (IO) are changing the standard of care of many types of cancer, and the paradigm of cancer
treatments and drug development is being rewritten on a regular basis. Moreover, an unprecedented number of new
investigational agents and companies are entering the field of IO. As such, it has become challenging for oncology physicians
conducting clinical trials, industry veterans developing IO drugs, and even regulators reviewing novel IO agents to keep track of
the rapidly evolving landscape. To help the key stake holders in the field understand the latest IO landscape, we sought to
present an unbiased, neutral, scientifically curated, and timely updated analysis of all the current IO agents in clinical
development and the clinical trials testing these agents. We based our analyses on information collected from numerous
trusted and publicly available sources. We have developed two databases. One database tracks 2004 IO agents (940 in clinical
stage and 1064 in preclinical stage) against 303 targets, from 864 companies; the other tracks 3042 active clinical trials of these
agents with a target enrollment of 577 076 patients. This report provides key analyses of these data. Furthermore, we will discuss
a number of important and actionable trends in the current IO landscape: a large number of companies developing agents
against the same IO targets; a rapid increase in the number of anti-PD-1/L1 combination studies, many of which are testing the
same combinations and following inefficient patterns; and a significant increase in the number of small, investigator-initiated
studies. For each of the findings, we speculate the causes and discuss a few initiatives that aim to address some of these
challenges. Finally, by making these landscape analyses available, we aspire to inform the cancer community as they seek to
strive for efficiencies and innovation while avoiding duplication.

Introduction
Advances in immuno-oncology (IO) are revolutionizing the
standard of care for many types of cancer. As of our data cut-off
date
(September
2017),
26
immunotherapies
have
been
approved, and 17 types of cancer have at least one approved im-
munotherapy as a treatment option. The first approval of modern
cancer immunotherapy was interferon-a in 1986 for hairy cell
leukemia, and later for chronic myelogenous leukemia, follicular
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, and AIDS-related Kaposi’s
sarcoma [1]. Several other agents have been approved since then,
but a transformation in the landscape of IO started with the ap-
proval of ipilimumab—a checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA-
4—for advanced melanoma in 2011 [2, 3]. In the past 3 years
alone, five new checkpoint inhibitors (targeting PD-1 or PD-L1),
two new cell therapies (targeting CD19), and one new
CD3-targeted bispecific antibody (also targeting CD19) have
been approved [4–7]. These novel immunotherapies, in most
cases, are designed to treat advanced, refractory, or relapsed
cancers that did not respond to standard-of-care cancer treat-
ments (Table 1).
Since the approval of ipilimumab, the pipeline of IO agents in
clinical and preclinical development has become very crowded
[8]. As of September 2017, there were 940 IO agents in clinical de-
velopment, with another 1064 in preclinical phase. We also found
that 3042 interventional active clinical trials are evaluating these
clinical-stage immunotherapies with a target of enrolling 577 076
patients (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology
online). These IO trials cover all common cancer types and the
majority of the less common ones, and promising results are
being reported on a daily basis in major conferences and clinical

 journals. The large numbers of promising experimental therapies,
active clinical trials, and planned patient enrollment suggest that
we are entering a new era that could change the standard-of-care
in even more cancer types.
However, the fast-expanding and ever-changing IO field could
overwhelm even the most experienced clinical investigators as
they seek treatment options for their patients. To help the cancer
community stay informed of the current IO landscape, the Anna-
Maria Kellen Clinical Accelerator of the Cancer Research
Institute (CRI), the clinical research program of CRI, provides
herein an unbiased, neutral, comprehensive, and scientifically
curated landscape analysis that aims to inform the physician-
scientists, drug developers, regulators, and other stakeholders of
the latest trends in IO clinical development.
The landscape of clinical immuno-oncology
A large number of IO drugs in clinical development
with significant duplication
Overview of the Clinical Accelerator IO database. Our database
included 2004 IO agents as of September 2017, 940 of which are
in clinical development. On the basis of different mechanisms of
actions, we classified these agents into six categories: (i) T-cell-
targeted immunomodulators that act on inhibitory or activating
molecules expressed by T cells (e.g. agents targeting CTLA-4,
PD-1, CD40, and GITR); (ii) other immunomodulators that act
on other immune cells or the tumor immune microenvironment
to unleash antitumor immunity (e.g. agents modulating IFNAR,
CSF1R, IDO1, A2AR, and KIR); (iii) cancer vaccines that induce
antigen-specific antitumor immunity (e.g. sipuleucel-T); (iv) cell
therapies that engineer immune cells such as T cells to directly
attack cancer cells (e.g. anti-CD19 CAR-T); (v) oncolytic viruses
that rely on both direct tumor killing and activation of antitumor
immunity (e.g. T-VEC); and (vi) CD3-targeted bispecific anti-
bodies that bring T cell to the targeted tumor cells for direct kill-
ing (e.g. blinatumomab) (Figure 1).
Concentration of agents on a few targets. The 940 clinical-stage
IO agents are owned by 462 different companies or academic in-
stitutes (supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology
online), and these agents modulate 271 different targets.
Interestingly, a closer investigation of the 940 agents revealed that
almost half of them modulate only 40 targets (Figure 2). For ex-
ample, we found 164 agents targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 (PD-1/L1),
with 50 clinical-stage agents targeting PD-1/L1, 34 of which are
monoclonal antibodies (Figure 3). This confirms our assumption
of significant duplication, despite the fact that five anti-PD-1/L1
monoclonal
antibodies
have
already
been
approved
[9].
Although it is still unclear if targeting the PD-1 receptor or its lig-
and PD-L1 will result in any differences in efficacy and safety,
none of the agents or studies in our database show any head-to-
head evaluation in patients. In another example, agents targeting

 unspecified tumor-associated antigens (unspecified TAA) rep-
resent the largest number of clinical IO agents. There are now
114 agents in the clinic, 98 of which are cancer vaccines. Of the
114 unspecific TAA-targeted IO agents, only sipuleucel-T (an au-
tologous dendritic cell vaccine) has been approved for prostate
cancer [10]. This number of agents raises questions on efficien-
cies of resources and, importantly, the patients who enroll into
clinical trials. The concentration of IO development and patient
resources on a few targets, some with already approved drugs,
could potentially be stalling future innovation. Rather, investing
these precious resources more efficiently could help accelerate
needed progress in finding cures to this deadly disease.
Rapid proliferation of CAR-T-cell therapy, especially in China.
CAR-T-cell therapy has delivered unprecedented results, with
two recent approvals of CD19-targeted CAR-T-cell therapies
[11, 12]. CD19 is also the most common CAR-T target, with
56 clinical-stage therapies against it (supplementary Table S3,
available at Annals of Oncology online). Surprisingly, by interrog-
ating our IO drug database, we found 291 different CAR-T thera-
pies, with 162 of them being tested clinically. These agents are
being developed by 136 different companies and academic cen-
ters. Interestingly, companies and academic centers from China
seem to lead the total number of clinical-stage CAR-T therapies,
with 98 clinical-stage agents owned by 46 companies from China

The landscape of anti-PD-1/L1 combination trials
Trends in the landscape of 1105 PD-1/L1 combo therapy trials.
Despite the approval of five anti-PD-1/L1 antibody agents, our
database shows that there are numerous clinical trial programs
that are ongoing and actively recruiting patients. The clinical-stage
PD-1/PD-L1 agents are evaluating clinical questions across 1502
different studies. Of these, 1105 are combination trials that com-
bine anti-PD-1/L1 agents with other IO therapies, targeted thera-
pies, chemotherapies, radiotherapies, or chemoradiotherapies. It is
worth noting that 49 of the combination trials are testing agents
that have not been approved, whereas the majority of combination
trials focus on the five approved agents (Figure 5).
Fragmentation and lack of coordination in PD-1/L1 combination
trial landscape. A deeper analysis of the 1105 trials reveals some
interesting observations. First, there has been a rapid increase in
new combination studies in the past 5 years. Analysis of our data-
base shows that in 2017 alone, 469 new studies were started, with a
target enrollment of 52 539 patients (Figure 6). Second, agents
against 165 different targets are being combined with anti-PD-1/L1
agents (supplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology

 online). Many of these studies we observed have significant over-
lap and duplication of the combination partner targets. For in-
stance, anti-CTLA-4 agents and chemotherapies are the two
most prevalent classes of therapies being combined with anti-
PD-1/L1 agents, with 251 and 170 studies, respectively (Figure
7). This could possibly be driven by the evidence of preclinical
synergy of the combination [13], or the recent approvals of anti-
PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination for advanced melanoma and
anti-PD-1/chemotherapy combination as the first-line treat-
ment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [14, 15].
However, it should be questioned if 251 and 170 studies are
needed to answer clinically relevant questions. Other prevalent
combination partners are anti-VEGF agents (predominantly
with bevacizumab) and radiochemotherapy, with some having
already shown clinical benefits [16]. This wide coverage of dis-
tinct targets, in our opinion, reflects a fragmented and uncoor-
dinated approach to drug development across the anti-PD-1/L1
combination trial landscape.
New trial designs should be considered for IO
development
Breakthrough treatments sooner. The early activity observed with
anti-PD-1/L1 agents across multiple tumor types has accelerated
the use of novel trial designs, several of which have led to regula-
tory approvals. There are several examples of novel study designs
where drugs have leaped through the drug development phases:
from first-in-human, dose selection, safety, efficacy, biomarker
selection, all the way to regulatory approval, in one single study.
Particularly, the proliferation of agents has resulted in a competi-
tive drug development landscape with a need to answer clinical
questions faster within a shorter timeframe by using these novel
trial designs. One example is KEYNOTE-001, a phase I trial that
led to two FDA approvals, one in melanoma and the other in
advanced NSCLC [17]. Moreover, the PD-L1 biomarker was
evaluated and confirmed all within the same study. KEYNOTE-
001 is arguably the largest phase I trial, which finally recruited

 1245 patients. Its adaptive design allowed the trial to seamlessly
transition from generating safety data to producing regulatory
submission-quality efficacy data rather than starting separate
studies for each clinical question [17]. Speed of development was
also demonstrated in this innovative trial design. In <4 years,
KEYNOTE-001 went from IND filing to the approval of pembro-
lizumab for ipilimumab-resistant metastatic melanoma [18].
One year after the first approval, results from this same trial led to
the second approval in advanced NSCLC [19].
Another example of novel study design involves biomarker-
based, histology-agnostic basket trial design. It was known that
tumors with high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or
deficiency in mismatch DNA repair (dMMR) have very high level
of nonsynonymous mutations and high immunogenicity, which
associates with a high response rate to anti-PD-1 therapy [20,
21]. In KEYNOTE-059, a phase II basket trial, patients with solid
tumors tested positive with MSI-H or dMMR were enrolled, re-
gardless of their cancer types. Indeed, 149 enrolled patients with
MSI-H or dMMR tumors demonstrated a 39.6% objective re-
sponse rate, which led to the first histology-agnostic approval of a
cancer treatment in the United States [22]. Notably, most ap-
provals in IO today are based on unprecedented benefit–risk
ratios, with results from relatively small datasets. However, most
of these early approvals in the United States are accelerated
approvals (FDA sub-part H), which require confirmatory trials
to validate the results [23, 24]. These novel trial designs, coupled
with highly flexible and cooperative attitudes from regulators
globally have significantly accelerated the delivery of innovative
and clinically beneficial immunotherapies to patients with
cancer.
A notable shift in study sponsorship from
companies to investigators
Rapid increase of investigator-initiated trials in the early develop-
ment cycle. Traditionally, companies conduct most early- and
mid-stage development of a compound themselves—through
multicenter, industry-sponsored trials. Once the agent is closer to
regulatory approval, the companies would allow more ‘investiga-
tor-initiated’ exploratory studies to be conducted. However, for
IO agents, our analysis shows that this traditional development
paradigm is no longer followed. First, we found that of the 1105
anti-PD-1/L1 combo trials, 60% (655 out of 1105) are sponsored
by non-industry sources, such as individual academic centers,
government agencies, collaborative groups, or nonprofit entities
(Figure 8). Investigator-initiated studies are deemed more ex-
ploratory and have an enrollment target of 76 patients per trial on
average, compared with 257 patients per industry-sponsored trial
(Figure 9). Furthermore, as most of the investigator-initiated tri-
als are being conducted at single centers, it is unrealistic that these
655 non-industry trials will ever achieve the overall target enroll-
ment of �50 000 patients (Figure 8). This enormous recruitment
target, in our opinion, is also a challenging hurdle with many du-
plicate questions being addressed and limited patient resources.
Summary and discussion
In summary, the current clinical landscape of IO presents enor-
mous enthusiasm from academia and industry, which is exempli-
fied by 940 clinical-stage IO agents, 3042 immunotherapy trials,
and 1 105 anti-PD-1/L1 combination trials. The field is very
promising and has the potential to deliver many breakthroughs
to change the standard of care of many cancer types. However, it
is also very crowded, fragmented, and uncoordinated with

 significant duplication. Our research has identified and con-
firmed several opportunities and challenges: many IO agents
concentrate on a few targets such as PD-1; anti-PD-1/L1 combin-
ation trial space is very fragmented and uncoordinated; trad-
itional trial designs are not suited for the fast-changing landscape
of clinical IO development; and a significant proportion of the
increase in studies can be attributed to investigator initiated IO
trials—small, single-center trials that may fail to recruit enough
patients and produce high-quality results. We now discuss several
ongoing trends that could address these challenges.
There are clear limitations to traditional trial designs, namely
single-center studies and the pursuit of the same biological targets
by multiple companies. From our research of the IO landscape,
there is an urgent need to enhance efficiencies. In a recent publi-
cation led by the FDA, the authors provided an eloquent sum-
mary and examples of collaborative and novel trial designs,
which could allow more questions to be answered more effi-
ciently in a single multicenter trial [25]. These umbrella, basket,
or platform designs create a unique opportunity to drive collab-
oration, coordination, and accelerated innovation.
Although many biopharmaceutical companies are adopting
such study designs, they still tend to include drugs only from their
own portfolio. The nonprofit and public sectors can play an im-
portant role in facilitating and conducting these innovative trials
across multiple companies and research centers. There are now
several examples of nonprofit organizations leading these novel
study designs that have made significant contributions to the
field. Notably the I-SPY program for breast cancer [26] is a
unique nonprofit-led collaborative that has recruited over 1000
patients and has graduated multiple agents into pivotal develop-
ment. In another program, the LUNG-MAP for lung cancer [27]
was a multi-party collaboration between Friends of Cancer
Research, Foundation for NIH, National Cancer Institute, the
Southwest Oncology group, and multiple biopharmaceutical and
diagnostic companies. Despite a slow start and operational com-
plexities, the study is now open with multiple arms at hundreds
of sites. There is an opportunity to learn from these experiences
and apply them to future collaborative opportunities to help
avoid further fragmentation and duplication.
Public IO-focused information hubs would help coordinate ef-
forts, optimize research resources, and identify rising opportuni-
ties in the field. In basic research, the online cancer-immunity
cycle (https://cancer-immunity.nature.com/pages/map), which
evolved from a recent landmark review paper, serves as a central-
ized information hub for new IO targets and factors that affect
tumor immunology [28]. In clinical development, we realized the
urgent need of an updated, scientifically curated landscape for
the clinical IO community. Along with this publication, we will
make all related resources available on CRI’s website (www.can
cerresearch.org/IO-landscape). These analyses will be updated on
a quarterly basis. Working with the IO community, we aim to
build an unbiased, neutral, comprehensive information hub for
clinical IO.
Conclusion
It is probably the best time for progress in oncology in the past
decades. The historic opportunity would be maximally capital-
ized if people from academia, industry, regulatory agencies, and
nonprofit organizations work together. This cross-sector collab-
oration, deep commitment to following the science, and adopting
novel study design would be the best ways to bring the true prom-
ise of cancer immunotherapies to patients, sooner than later.
