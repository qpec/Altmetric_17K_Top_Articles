Abstract
Context—In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes 
and coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether these associations represent causal relationships 
remains uncertain.
Objective—To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for 
body mass index (WHRadjBMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD 
through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure and glycemic phenotypes.
Design—A polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI based on 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
was constructed. The association of this score, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal 
adiposity, with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a Mendelian 
randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional datasets.
Setting and Participants—Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined 
dataset including summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 
to 2015, consisting of up to 322 154 participants, as well as individual level, cross sectional data 
from the UK Biobank collected from 2007–2011, consisting of 111 986 individuals. Estimates for 
type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide 
association studies conducted from 2007–2015, and including 149 821 individuals and 184 305 
individuals, respectively, combined with individual level data from the UK Biobank.

 Exposure—Genetic predisposition to increased WHRadjBMI.
Main Outcome Measures—Type 2 diabetes and CHD.
Results—In 111 986 individuals in UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 [standard deviation (SD) 
8] years, 58 845 participants (52.5%) were women and the mean waist-to-hip ratio was 0.875. 
Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK 
Biobank data demonstrated that a one SD increase in WHRadjBMI mediated by the polygenic risk 
score was associated with 27 mg/dl higher triglyceride levels, 4.1 mg/dl higher two-hour glucose 
levels, and 2.1 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P ≤ 0.001). A one SD genetic increase 
in WHRadjBMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes [OR 1.77 CI 1.57, 2.00; 
absolute risk increase per 1000 participant years (ARI) 6.0 CI 4.4, 7.8; number of participants with 
type 2 diabetes outcome, 40 530] and CHD (OR 1.46 CI 1.32, 1.62; ARI 1.8 CI 1.3, 2.4; number 
of participants with CHD outcome, 66 440).
Conclusions and Relevance—A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted 
for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart 
disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal 
adiposity and these outcomes.
Introduction
Obesity, typically defined on the basis of body mass index (BMI), is a leading cause of type 
2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) in the population.1,2 However, for any given 
BMI, body fat distribution can vary substantially; some individuals store proportionally 
more fat around their visceral organs (abdominal adiposity) than on their thighs and hip.3 
Waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) is a surrogate measure of abdominal 
adiposity and has been correlated with direct imaging assessments of abdominal fat in 
observational studies.4,5
In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with cardiometabolic 
disease6,7; however, whether this association is causal remains unclear. For example, 
unmeasured lifestyle factors8 might confound observational studies that link WHRadjBMI 
with type 2 diabetes and CHD. Furthermore, reverse causality could similarly lead to a 
statistically robust but non-causal relationship. For example, individuals with subclinical 
CHD might develop abdominal adiposity due to an inability to exercise.
Mendelian randomization is a human genetics tool that leverages the random assortment of 
genetic variants at time of conception to facilitate causal inference.9 Because genetic 
predisposition to abdominal adiposity is determined by DNA sequence variants, it is less 
likely to be affected by confounding or reverse causality. In this study, a Mendelian 
randomization approach is used to determine whether a genetic predisposition to increased 
WHRadjBMI is associated with cardiometabolic quantitative traits, type 2 diabetes, and 
CHD.

 Methods
Study Design and Instruments
Observational epidemiology studies test association of an exposure (e.g., WHRadjBMI) with 
an outcome (e.g., CHD). However, unobserved confounders may affect both exposure and 
outcome, thus biasing the observed association (Figure 1, Supp. Methods A). Because 
genetic variants are both randomly assorted in a population and assigned at conception, 
genetic variants are largely unassociated with confounders and can be used as instrumental 
variables to estimate the causal association of an exposure (WHRadjBMI) with an outcome.9 
This Mendelian randomization approach has three assumptions.10 First, genetic variants 
used as an instrument must be associated with the exposure of interest (e.g., WHRadjBMI, 
Assumption 1 in Figure 1). Second, genetic variants must not be associated with 
confounders (Assumption 2 in Figure 1). Third, genetic variants must not be associated with 
outcome independently of the exposure (Assumption 3 in Figure 1). The second and third 
assumptions are collectively known as independence from pleiotropy. Mendelian 
randomization can be extended to conduct a mediation analysis, estimating the association 
of an exposure (WHRadjBMI) with an outcome (CHD) that occurs through a given mediator 
(M in Figure 1) and that does not occur through a mediator (U in Figure 1).
A Mendelian randomization study using publicly-available summary-level data from large-
scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS; both cross-sectional and case control 
datasets) as well as individual-level data from the UK Biobank (a cross-sectional dataset) 
was conducted (Figure 2).11–17 The primary exposure was a polygenic risk score for 
WHRadjBMI. A recent large-scale GWAS from the Genome-wide Investigation of 
Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium identified 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs; genetic variants) associated with WHRadjBMI (eTable 1).13 Combining these 48 
SNPs into a weighted polygenic risk score enabled quantification of the genetic 
predisposition to increased WHRadjBMI for each individual.
Data sources and study participants
Summary-level data from six GWAS consortia were used (GWAS conducted from 2007 to 
2015, eTable 3, Supp. Methods B).11–17 For waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), BMI, waist 
circumference, hip circumference, and WHRadjBMI, data from the GIANT consortium was 
used (GWAS conducted from 2007 to 2013);13,14 this study included 322 154 individuals of 
European descent for BMI and 210 088 individuals of European descent for WHRadjBMI, 
WHR, waist circumference and hip circumference. The results from five additional GWAS 
(conducted from 2007 to 2015) examining blood lipids, glycemic traits, renal function, type 
2 diabetes, and CHD, and predominantly containing individuals of European descent, were 
also assessed.11,12,17–20 Summary results for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from 
studies of 149 821 individuals (DIAGRAM17) and 184 305 individuals (CARDIOGRAM19), 
respectively. Informed consent was obtained from all participants of contributing studies. 
Contributing studies received ethical approval from their respective institutional review 
boards.

 Individual-level data from 111 986 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, 
collected from 2007–2011, was also used (Supp. Methods C, Table 1). UK Biobank received 
ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee (reference number 11/NW/0382). 
Analysis of UK Biobank was approved by the Partners Health Care Institutional Review 
Board (protocol 2013P001840). Informed consent was obtained from all participants by UK 
Biobank. WHRadjBMI was derived in UK Biobank through inverse normal transformation 
of WHR after adjustment for age, sex and BMI (as in the GIANT collaboration13). Type 2 
diabetes and CHD were both ascertained at baseline by self-report, followed by a verbal 
interview with a trained nurse to confirm the diagnosis (eTable 4). Type 2 diabetes was 
defined as report of type 2 diabetes, report of type 2 diabetes unspecified, or current use of 
insulin medication. CHD was defined as report of previous myocardial infarction or 
diagnosis of angina or hospitalization for myocardial infarction (ICD codes I21-I23).
In addition to the primary outcomes of type 2 diabetes and CHD, a phenome-wide 
association study (an analysis of the association of a genetic variant or polygenic risk score 
with a broad range of diseases and/or outcomes) for 35 additional diseases, including 
endocrine, renal, urological, gastrointestinal, neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory and 
cancer disorders was conducted in UK Biobank to attempt to identify whether the polygenic 
risk score for WHRadjBMI is associated with any additional disorders (eTable 4).
Statistical analysis
For analyses of both summary-level data and UK Biobank, a weighted polygenic risk score 
was derived based on the magnitude of association each SNP with WHRadjBMI in the 
previously published GIANT analysis.18 The association of polygenic risk score with each 
continuous trait and dichotomous outcome was then calculated after standardization to a one 
standard deviation (SD) predicted change in WHRadjBMI.
For the summary level data, this approach is equivalent to an inverse-variance weighted 
fixed effects meta-analysis of the association of each SNP with the trait or outcome of 
interest (e.g. CHD), divided by the association of each SNP with WHRadjBMI.21,28 
Explicitly, if x is the association of each SNP with the outcome of interest, and w the 
association of each SNP with WHRadjBMI, then the estimated genetic association of 
WHRadjBMI with the outcome was calculated as a fixed effects meta-analysis of x/w for all 
SNPs.
To validate that the polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI was a strong instrument for 
WHRadjBMI (Assumption 1 in Figure 1), an F-statistic for the instrument was calculated in 
UK Biobank. An F-statistic is a measure of the significance of an instrument (the polygenic 
risk score) for prediction of the exposure (WHRadjBMI), controlling for additional 
covariates (age, sex, ten principal components of ancestry and a dummy variable for the 
array type used in genotyping). An F-statistic greater than 10 is evidence of a strong 
instrument.22
For individual level data from UK Biobank, logistic regression was used to determine 
association of a polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI and dichotomous outcomes (type 2 
diabetes, CHD and 35 additional diseases, Supp. Methods C).23 Linear regression was used

 for continuous traits in UK Biobank (anthropometric traits and blood pressure). All UK 
Biobank analyses included adjustment for age, sex, ten principal components of ancestry 
and a dummy variable for the array type used in genotyping. The inclusion of principal 
components of ancestry as covariates is commonly implemented to correct for population 
stratification according to ancestral background.24
In order to test Assumption 2 (independence of polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI from 
potential confounders, Figure 1), the relationship of the polygenic risk score to smoking, 
alcohol use, physical activity, vegetable consumption, red meat consumption and 
breastfeeding status as a child was determined among individuals in the UK Biobank. Test 
for trend was performed across quartiles of the polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI using 
logistic regression with each potential confounder as the outcome. For comparison, 
individuals in UK Biobank were stratified into quartiles by observational WHRadjBMI and 
test for trend performed using logistic regression.
Five additional sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of our results 
(Supp. Methods D). Three additional polygenic risk scores were used, including one that 
included variants which were not significantly associated with BMI, a second that included 
variants which were significantly associated with gene expression in adipose tissue and a 
third that included variants which were significantly associated with increased WHRadjBMI 
in women but not in men. The association of genetic variants with BMI was adjusted for and 
median regression was used (Supp. Methods D).10 The rationale for these sensitivity 
analyses is provided in Supp. Methods D.
Absolute increases associated with WHRadjBMI for type 2 diabetes and CHD were 
calculated using the United States population incidence of type 2 diabetes and CHD (Supp. 
Methods E). Tests for non-linear associations of a genetic predisposition to increased 
WHRadjBMI with type 2 diabetes and CHD were performed using non-linear instrumental 
variable estimation (Supp. Methods F).25
The threshold of statistical significance for type 2 diabetes and CHD (main outcome 
measures) was p< 0.025 (0.05/2=0.025). The threshold of significance for the analysis of 
fifteen traits was p<0.0033 (0.05/15=0.0033). The threshold of significance in the phenome-
wide association analysis was p<0.0014 (0.05/35 = 0.0014).
Mediation analysis
Amongst continuous traits, the polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI was most strongly 
associated with plasma triglyceride levels. The extent to which the polygenic risk score 
association with CHD was mediated by plasma triglycerides was tested using mediation 
analysis, conducted post-hoc after triglycerides was identified as the cardiometabolic trait 
most strongly associated with WHRadjBMI. An estimate of the genetic association of 
triglycerides on CHD risk, previously derived in Do et al. (odds ratio 1.52 per 1 SD increase 
in triglycerides)26, was used to calculate the predicted magnitude of increased CHD risk 
based on the observed association of the WHRadjBMI polygenic risk score with 
triglycerides (estimated using linear regression). To derive the remaining proportion of CHD 
risk unaccounted for by an increase in triglyceride levels, the magnitude of association of the

 change in triglycerides with CHD was subtracted from our estimate of the genetic 
association of WHRadjBMI with CHD (estimated using logistic regression).
Analyses were performed using R version 3.2.3 software (The R Project for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Stata version 12 (StataCorp, Texas, United States).
Results
The characteristics of UK Biobank participants are provided in Table 1. The mean age was 
56.9 (SD 7.9), the mean systolic blood pressure 143.6 mm Hg (SD 21.8) and the mean 
diastolic blood pressure 84.5 mm Hg (SD 11.8). 5639 (5.0%) participants had CHD while 
5690 (5.1%) individuals had type 2 diabetes.
A 48-SNP polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI score was a strong instrumental variable 
(F-statistic of 1713), statistically accounting for 1.5% of variance in WHRadjBMI in UK 
Biobank, thus validating Assumption 1 in Figure 1.
In order to test Assumption 2 (independence of polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI from 
potential confounders, Figure 1), the relationship of the polygenic risk score to smoking, 
alcohol use, physical activity, vegetable consumption, red meat consumption and 
breastfeeding status as a child was determined among individuals in the UK Biobank. In 
each case, no significant relationship was noted (eTable 5). For comparison, a similar 
analysis that categorized individuals according to observed WHRadjBMI (instead of genetic 
predisposition to WHRadjBMI) was conducted (eTable 6). In this observational 
epidemiology analysis, WHRadjBMI was strongly associated with each potential 
confounder.
A one SD increase in WHRadjBMI due to the polygenic risk score was associated with a 1.0 
kg/m2 decrease in BMI (CI 0.9, 1.1), a 2 cm increase in waist circumference (CI 1.5, 2.4), a 
4.1 cm decrease in hip circumference (CI 3.8, 4.4) and a 0.068 increase in WHR (CI 0.066, 
0.07; Figure 3). A one SD increase in WHRadjBMI due to the polygenic risk score was 
associated with higher total cholesterol (5.6 CI 3.9, 7.3 mg/dl), higher LDL cholesterol (5.7 
CI 4.1, 7.2 mg/dl), higher triglycerides (27 CI 25, 30 mg/dl) and lower HDL cholesterol (6.0 
CI 5.3, 6.6 mg/dl). A one SD increase in WHRadjBMI due to the polygenic risk score was 
associated with higher log-transformed fasting insulin levels (0.065 CI 0.052, 0.078), higher 
two-hour glucose levels (4.1 CI 1.6, 6.5 mg/dl), and higher systolic blood pressure (2.1 CI 
1.2, 3 mmHg).
A one SD increase in WHRadjBMI due to polygenic risk score was associated with a higher 
risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 1.77 CI 1.57, 2.00; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant 
years (ARI) 6.0 CI 4.4, 7.8; p=7.3*10−21; number of participants with type 2 diabetes 
outcome, 40 530; Figure 4). A one SD increase in WHRadjBMI due to polygenic risk score 
was also associated with higher risk of CHD (OR 1.46, CI 1.32, 1.62; ARI 1.8 CI 1.3, 2.4; 
p=9.9*10−14; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66 440; Figure 4).
Five sensitivity analyses (Supp. Methods D, eFigures 1–9) of the genetic association of 
WHRadjBMI with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes and CHD were conducted to 
Emdin et al.

 examine if results were influenced by pleiotropy (i.e., a violation of Assumptions 2 or 3 in 
Figure 1). Four of the five sensitivity analyses were consistent with the results not being 
influenced by pleiotropy (eFigures 1–7). In the fifth sensitivity analysis, eight SNPs 
associated with elevated WHRadjBMI in women but not men were combined in an additive 
risk score. If WHRadjBMI causes CHD (rather than results being due to pleiotropy), then a 
risk score that increases WHRadjBMI in women but not in men should increase risk of CHD 
in women but not in men. Although a numerically greater magnitude of association with 
type 2 diabetes and CHD was noted in women as compared to men, no significant difference 
was observed (p-interaction = 0.10 and 0.11 respectively (eFigures 8 and 9; eMethods D).
Using the polygenic risk score of 48 SNPs associated with WHRadjBMI, a phenome wide 
association study of 35 additional diseases in UK Biobank was conducted (Figure 5). There 
was no significant association of WHRadjBMI with any of these diseases at the Bonferroni-
adjusted level of significance (p<0.0014).
In mediation analysis, the association of polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI with CHD 
was attenuated from OR 1.46 (CI 1.32, 1.62) to OR 1.23 (CI 1.11, 1.36), after accounting for 
the association of the polygenic risk score with triglycerides (eFigure 10).
Discussion
Mendelian randomization analyses tested if human genetic evidence supported a causal 
relationship of WHRadjBMI, a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and 
CHD. Genetic predisposition to higher WHRadjBMI was associated with increased levels of 
quantitative risk factors (lipids, insulin, glucose, and systolic blood pressure) as well as a 
higher risk for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.77 CI 1.57, 2.00 per SD higher WHRadjBMI) and 
CHD (OR 1.46 CI 1.32, 1.62 per SD higher WHRadjBMI).
These results permit several conclusions. First, these findings lend human genetic support to 
previous observations associating abdominal adiposity with cardiometabolic disease.6,7 In 
the INTERHEART acute myocardial infarction case-control study, a one SD higher WHR 
was associated with elevated odds of myocardial infarction (OR 1.37 CI 1.33, 1.40), after 
adjustment for BMI and other covariates.6 However, residual confounding or reverse 
causality may have contributed to these associations. Indeed, in this study, observational 
WHRadjBMI was strongly associated with potential confounders, illustrating a limitation of 
observational epidemiology. Here, these prior findings were extended by testing a polygenic 
risk score that appeared independent of measured confounders (eTable 5). Elevation in 
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, a risk factor for CHD with genetic and experimental evidence 
for causality26,27, appeared to mediate a substantial proportion of the increased risk for 
CHD.
Second, these results suggest that body fat distribution, beyond simple measurement of BMI, 
could explain part of the variation in risk of type 2 diabetes and CHD noted across 
individuals and subpopulations. For example, increased abdominal adiposity in South Asians 
at a given BMI has been proposed as an explanation for the excess risk of CHD observed in 
South Asians.28 Similarly, greater abdominal adipose tissue at a given BMI has been

 proposed to underlie the excess risk of CHD at a given BMI among men compared to 
women.29 In the INTERHEART study, which observed a similar strength of association of 
WHRadjBMI with myocardial infarction as the genetic estimate reported here, 33.7% of 
myocardial infarctions were attributed to elevated WHR compared to 10.8% of infarctions to 
overweight and obesity (BMI > 25).6 When combined with the evidence supportive of 
causality reported here, these results raise the potential that abdominal adiposity, 
independent of elevated BMI, is a major driver of global CHD burden.
Third, WHRadjBMI might prove useful as a biomarker for the development of therapies to 
prevent type 2 diabetes and CHD. Although a substantial focus of drug development has 
been towards therapeutics to reduce overall adiposity30, there has been little effort towards 
the development of therapies that modify body fat distribution to reduce abdominal 
adiposity. Ongoing research to understand the mechanistic links between the numerous 
genetic loci that influence WHRadjBMI may lead to novel therapeutics strategies to reduce 
abdominal adiposity and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and CHD.
The Mendelian randomization approach used in this study rests on two major principles 
(Figure 1). First, it requires a strong link between the genetic variants used as an instrument 
and the exposure (WHRadjBMI, assumption 1 in Figure 1). The 48 SNP polygenic risk 
score explained 1.5% of variance in WHRadjBMI and had an F-statistic of 1713 in UK 
Biobank, classifying it as a strong instrument with negligible weak instrument bias.31 
Second, Mendelian randomization assumes the absence of pleiotropy, that is, it assumes that 
the genetic variants used as an instrument affect the outcome (CHD) through the exposure 
(WHRadjBMI) and not through any other pathway or confounding factors (assumptions 2 
and 3 in Figure 1). Although it is not possible to directly test whether pleiotropy is present in 
any Mendelian randomization study32, a number of steps were taken in this study to reduce 
the risk of pleiotropy, including use of three different genetic instruments, use of weighted 
median regression and use of an instrument that was associated with higher WHRadjBMI in 
women but not men. Results from four of five of these sensitivity analyses were consistent 
with the primary results. Tests for interaction using sex-specific instruments for CHD and 
diabetes were directionally consistent with expectation but did not demonstrate significant 
heterogeneity of effect by gender. This analysis required individual-level data available only 
in UK Biobank participants and may have been underpowered to detect a difference. Future 
research that explores such sex-specific instruments in larger datasets may prove more 
conclusive.
Several limitations deserve mention. First, while a number of approaches were used in an 
attempt to rule out pleiotropy, it is possible that these results represent a shared genetic basis 
between WHRadjBMI and CHD rather than a causal relationship. Second, prevalent events 
largely derived from a verbal interview with a nurse were used for the phenome-wide 
association study of thirty-five different disorders. Although these events are likely to be of 
greater specificity and sensitivity than coded mortality data, they have not been 
independently validated. Third, the phenome-wide association study may have been 
underpowered to detect an association of genetic WHRadjBMI with outcomes other than 
type 2 diabetes and CHD. Fourth, this analysis was restricted to individuals of European

 ancestry; the association of genetic WHRadjBMI with type 2 diabetes and CHD may differ 
by ethnicity or genetic ancestry.
Conclusions
A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was 
associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and CHD. These results provide evidence 
supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.

 Key Points
Question
Is genetic evidence consistent with a causal relationship among waist-to-hip ratio 
adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, type 2 
diabetes and coronary heart disease?
Findings
In this Mendelian randomization study, a polygenic risk score for increased WHRadjBMI 
was significantly associated with adverse cardiometabolic traits and higher risks for both 
type 2 diabetes (OR 1.77) and coronary heart disease (OR 1.46).
Meaning
These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal 
adiposity and the development of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease.

 Figure 1. 
Assumptions of a Mendelian randomization analysis. Genetic variants, which are assigned at 
birth and largely randomly assorted in a population, can be used as instrumental variables to 
estimate the causal association of an exposure (e.g., WHRadjBMI) with an outcome of 
interested (e.g., coronary heart disease). This approach rests on three assumptions, denoted 
with Assumption 1 through Assumption 3 above. First, the genetic variants must be 
associated with the exposure (Assumption 1). Second, the genetic variants must not be 
associated with confounders (Assumption 2). Third, the genetic variants must influence risk 
of the outcome through the exposure and not through other pathways (Assumption 3). 
Mendelian randomization can be extended to estimate the association of exposure with 
outcome that is mediated (M in Figure 1) by a given a mediator (e.g., triglycerides) and that 
is not mediated (U in Figure 1) by that mediator.

Association of 48 SNP polygenic risk score for WHRadjBMI with cardiometabolic 
quantitative traits. Results are standardized to a one SD increase in WHRadjBMI due to 
polygenic risk score. For systolic blood pressure, a one SD genetic increase WHRadjBMI is 
associated with a 2.1 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI 1.2, 3.0), or a 0.1 
standard deviation increase in systolic blood pressure (CI 0.059, 0.15). For anthropometric 
traits, estimates from Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT – derived 
using inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis13,14) were pooled with UK 
Biobank (derived instrumental variables regression adjusting for age, sex, ten principal 
components of ancestry and array type) using inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-
analysis. For lipids, glycaemic and renal function traits, estimates were derived from 
genome-wide association studies (Global Lipids Genetics11, Meta-analyses of Glucose and 
Insulin-related Traits12 and Chronic Kidney Genetics Consortia15, respectively). For blood 
pressure, estimates were derived from UK Biobank. Two hour glucose refers to measured
