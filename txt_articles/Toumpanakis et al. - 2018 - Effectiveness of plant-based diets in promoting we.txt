AbstrAct
Diet interventions have suggested an association between 
plant-based diets and improvements in psychological 
well-being, quality of life and glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) control in populations with diabetes. The 
aims of this review are to systematically analyze the 
available literature on plant-based diet interventions 
targeting diabetes in adults and to clearly define the 
benefits on well-being of such interventions. This is a 
systematic review of controlled trials. A computerized 
systematic literature search was conducted in the 
following electronic databases: Allied and Complementary 
Medicine, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 
E-Journals, Excerpta Medica Database, MEDLINE, Health 
Management Information Consortium, PsycARTICLES, 
PsycINFO, PubMed, SocINDEX and Web of Science. The 
search strategy retrieved 1240 articles, of which 11 met 
the inclusion criteria (n=433; mean sample age 54.8 
years). Plant-based diets were associated with significant 
improvement in emotional well-being, physical well-being, 
depression, quality of life, general health, HbA1c levels, 
weight, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, compared with several diabetic associations’ 
official guidelines and other comparator diets. Plant-based 
diets can significantly improve psychological health, 
quality of life, HbA1c levels and weight and therefore the 
management of diabetes.

diabetes facts
WHO estimates that in 2014, 422 million 
adults were living with diabetes glob-
ally, while according to the International 
Diabetes Federation (IDF) this number will 
rise to 642 million by 2040.1 2 In the UK 
the number of people who have diabetes is 
over 4.5 million, and in the USA it is more 
than 30 million.2–4 In 2010/2011 in the UK, 
diabetes costed approximately £10 billion in 
direct costs and £14 billion in indirect costs, 
totaling £24 billion (10% of the National 
Health Service budget), with the estimation 
being £40 billion in total in 2035.5 In the 
USA the annual economic burden is $245 
billion, $176 and $69 billion in direct and 
indirect costs, respectively.6
Diabetes UK states that 90% of people with 
diabetes have type 2 diabetes (T2D), while 
at the same time the percentage of people 
with T2D is on the rise and increasing.3 
The increasing levels of obesity in many 
countries nowadays have underlined a very 
concerning, newly introduced aspect: the 
number of T2D in children is growing.4 The 
IDF raises the concern by stating that T2D 
in children has the potential to become a 
global public health issue which will lead 
to serious health outcomes and underlines 
the need for more research in this aspect of 
diabetes.2
The impact of diabetes
Diabetes can cause a number of health compli-
cations if not well managed and treated and 
has the potential to have a huge impact on 
people’s physical and psychological well-
being. The WHO and the IDF suggest that 
diabetes considerably increases the risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), nephropathy, 
loss of vision due to diabetic retinopathy and 
lower extremity amputation.1 2 Diabetes (and 
its health complications) is also associated 
with an increased risk of mortality in most 
countries.2 7 The IDF estimates the number 
of people who died from diabetes in 2015 
before the age of 60 was approximately 5 
million; 14.5% of all-cause mortality globally 
is attributed to diabetes.2 The countries with 
the highest number of people with diabetes 
are the ones with the highest number of 
deaths associated with diabetes: China, 
Russian Federation, India and the USA. In 
2015 T2D was the seventh leading cause of 
death in the USA.4
T2D is considered to be one of the most 
psychologically demanding chronic condi-
tions,8 and people with diabetes often have

poor psychological well-being.9 Diabetes is often comorbid 
with depression, which has an impact on its management 
and control.1 A systematic review10 shows high rates 
of comorbidity between diabetes and depression and 
suggests that depression is three times as common among 
people with diabetes. The psychological stress associated 
with the management of diabetes could lead to elevated 
symptoms of depression.11 Depression comorbid with 
T2D has been associated with poorer glycemic control 
and poorer management of the condition.12–14
diabetes management
In January 2018 the American Association of Clinical 
Endocrinologists and the American College of Endo-
crinology released their new guidelines in which they 
suggest that plant-based diet is the optimal nutrition plan 
for people with diabetes as it promotes the well-being and 
the better management of diabetes.15
The IDF reports that the most influential factor for the 
development of T2D is lifestyle behavior commonly asso-
ciated with poor diet (eg, processed and high fat content 
foods).2 WHO underlines the importance of achieving a 
standardized and consistent management approach by 
promoting interventions that support healthy diets.1
There is a large body of research that suggests the asso-
ciation between high meat consumption and T2D.16–19 
The European Prospective into Cancer and Nutrition 
(EPIC) -InterAct study20 is a large prospective cohort 
study which explored the role of lifestyle and genetics 
on the risk of developing T2D in approximately 340 000 
adults from eight countries in Europe during a mean 
period of 11 years. The results of the EPIC-InterAct 
study20 show a high risk of T2D among individuals with 
high meat consumption, specifically red and processed 
meat. Moreover, after controlling and managing other 
risk factors for T2D (eg, smoking, physical activity, alcohol 
intake), the association between meat consumption and 
incidence of T2D remained statistically significant. This 
suggests the importance of healthy diet behavior in the 
management of T2D.
The term plant-based diet refers to eating habits that 
avoid the consumption of most or all animal prod-
ucts and support high consumption of fruits, vegeta-
bles, legumes, seeds, whole grains and nuts.21 Satija et 
al22 reviewed three prospective cohort studies of a total 
sample of 200 727 participants and concluded that a 
plant-based diet is associated with significantly lower risk 
of T2D. Tonstad et al23 state that plant-based diets could 
effectively and substantially decrease diabetes incidents. 
Furthermore, high consumption of fiber, whole grains, 
fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of 
T2D.24–27 A plant-based diet pattern seems to offer high 
protection against the development of diabetes as it 
contains antioxidants, fiber, micronutrients and unsatu-
rated fatty acids, which are considered to act as protec-
tive factors against diabetes.22 In addition, Mayo28 states 
that the management of diabetes is mostly based on a 
behavioral approach in which individuals could establish 
nearly complete control of their condition as long as they 
have been equipped with the right knowledge and skills. 
This suggests that effective management of diabetes 
could result in better glycemic control and psychological 
well-being.
A meta-analysis29 focusing on vegetarian diets (defined 
as those excluding meat, poultry and fish, and including 
eggs and dairy) in diabetes revealed a significantly 
improved glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in people who 
followed a vegetarian diet pattern. No systematic review 
was found in the literature solely focusing on the psycho-
logical and medical outcomes of plant-based diet inter-
ventions in adults with T2D.
objectives
The aims of this review are to systematically analyze 
the available literature on plant-based diet interven-
tions targeting and/or including adults with diabetes 
and to clearly define the benefits on well-being of such 
interventions.
MeThods
The incorporation of the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was 
used in order to conduct this review.30 31 The following 
criteria were considered for inclusion in the systematic 
review: (1) plant-based diet interventions targeting or 
including adults with T2D; (2) age of participants ≥ 18 
years; (3) clearly defined health outcomes; (4) controlled 
trials with length of ≥ 3 weeks; and (5) peer-reviewed 
studies. The exclusion criteria were (1) diet interventions 
for diabetes other than type 2; (2) age of participants <18 
years; (3) uncontrolled studies; (4) diet interventions 
that included more than 10% of daily calories on animal 
products; and (5) duplicate results.
search strategy
A computerized systematic search was performed on 10 
November 2017 in the following electronic databases 
limited to studies published in English language since 
the inception of each database: Allied and Complemen-
tary Medicine, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature, E-Journals, Excerpta Medica Database, 
MEDLINE, Health Management Information Consor-
tium, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PubMed, SocINDEX 
and Web of Science. In order to search for further poten-
tially eligible research material, the reference lists of 
studies with relevant topic were searched and reviewed. 
The following were the search terms used to locate/find 
studies: (1) plant based OR plant-based OR “plant based” 
OR plant food OR “plant food” OR vegan* OR vege-
tarian* OR “Daniel fast”; (2) diabet* OR T2D OR DT2; 
and (3) intervention* OR program* OR “controlled 
trial*” OR “randomised controlled trial*” OR “random-
ized controlled trial*” OR RCT.

data extraction
The following data was collected from each study as avail-
able: quality of life, self-esteem, depression,perceived 
pain and neuropathy symptoms, foot conductance, nutri-
tional efficacy,general efficacy, dietary adherence, dietary 
restraint, dietary disinhibition,diet acceptability, quality 
of life HbA1c, weight, fasting blood glucose,total choles-
terol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides 
anddiabetes-related medication. In addition, baseline 
characteristics of each study’s sample size, mean age, 
gender (proportion of men), design and duration were 
collected. Mean values for baseline age, proportion of 
male population and HbA1c were also calculated.
data screening and quality measures
The search results from the databases were combined 
and then the identified duplicates were removed. The 
described inclusion criteria were applied in a standard-
ized manner, and relevant studies were screened using 
the title, abstract and full text of the article.
The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies 
is a standardized quality appraisal instrument that was 
developed by the Effective Public Health Practice Project 
(EPHPP) of McMaster University for assessing the quality 
of public health.32 The instrument has been evaluated 
for inter-rater reliability, content validity and construct 
validity and has received high scores.33 34 This quality 
assessment tool and its dictionary are provided at www. 
ephpp. 
ca. Two researchers carried out the quality assess-
ment independently. The identified relevant studies 
were critically assessed according to the EPHPP’s tool 
and rated as ‘strong’, ‘moderate’ or ‘weak’ in six sections: 
(1) selection bias; (2) study design; (3) confounders; 
(4) blinding; (5) data collection methods; and (6) with-
drawals and dropouts. The aim of the quality assessment 
was to extract results from studies with an overall ‘strong’ 
or ‘moderate’ methodological rating. Studies that were 
rated as ‘poor’ have been excluded from the systematic 
review. Please see table 1 for the results of quality assess-
ment of included studies.
resulTs
study selection process
The search strategy retrieved 1240 articles. After removing 
the duplicates, the title/abstract screening process iden-
tified 41 studies. After a further full-text assessment, 30 
articles were excluded from the systematic review and 11 
met the inclusion criteria (please see figure 1). No addi-
tional publications were found through reference lists 
and hand searching.
The included studies relied on different tools in order 
to extract psychological data outcomes, and therefore 
a meta-analysis was not possible in this regard. For the 
other outcomes of our study, we considered that because 
the overall pooled N in the study is small, the CIs would 
be quite wide due to imprecision, which might cause our 
pooled estimate to cross the null hypothesis, which would 
make it difficult to draw a conclusion in either direc-
tion. Dietary interventions are difficult to engage a large 
number of individuals as it is hard for participants to alter 
their dietary patterns for a medium/long period of time. 
Our aim was to present as clear as possible the physical 
and psychological outcomes of plant-based interventions.
study characteristics
The 11 included studies were published between 1999 
and 2017 (please see table 2). Two of the studies produced 
two articles from the same sample highlighting different 
aspects of research; these articles are included:
1. Kahleova et al (2013) used different data from Kahleova 
et al (2011).35 36
2. Barnard et al (2009b) used different data from Barnard 
et al (2009a).37 38

Figure 1 Study selection process.
(n=2),35 36 Italy (n=1),43 New Zealand (n=1)44 and South 
Korea (n=1).45 One study had been conducted in a 
supervised residential environment,43 while the rest had 
been conducted in community-based settings. The total 
sample size was 433 participants (219 in the intervention 
groups/214 in the control groups; mean sample size 48), 
aged between 27 and 80 years (mean age 54.8 years). 
The number of withdrawals was reported in all studies, 
with the rates being between 3.5% and 29.1%. All studies 
targeted populations with T2D except for three.39 40 44 
Of these three studies, two39 40 included individuals with 
body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 and/or T2D, and 
one44 also included individuals with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and 
at least one diagnosis of T2D or ischemic heart disease 
or hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. Therefore not 
all of the participants of these three studies had T2D, but 
in the results specific outcomes related to the individuals 
with T2D were described.
All included studies were controlled trials with a dura-
tion range of between 3 and 74 weeks (mean duration 23.2 
weeks). Of the nine controlled trials, seven were random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs), of which four reported 
the randomization process38 41 44 45 and three failed to 
describe it.36 42 43 Moreover, two studies used a parallel 
design36 44 and one used a cluster study design.39 Eight 
of the studies examined vegan diets in the intervention 
groups, while one study examined plant-based diet with 
an option of one portion of low-fat yogurt a day, which 
accounted for approximately 8% of the total daily intake 
of calories.36 A full description of the diet intervention 
was described in all of the articles. All studies reported 
HbA1c as their primary or secondary outcome, which was 
measured at baseline and at the end of each study in both 
groups. From the 11 articles included, 3 reported psycho-
logical well-being outcomes in their results. The studies 
were dietary interventions and therefore none included 
blinding of participants. Five controlled trials provided 
nutritional education in both groups36 38 42 43 45 and four 
provided education only to the intervention group.39–41 44 
All studies reported both baseline and end-line results 
and used validated measures. Highly specialized profes-
sionals (medical doctors, registered dietitians) delivered 
the dietary interventions in all of the studies.
FIndIngs
Quality of life, psychological and social well-being
Quality of life significantly improved only in the inter-
vention group35 41 (p=0.01; p<0.05), and significant 
improvements in the intervention group in both psycho-
logical and physical components summary44 (p<0.001; 
p<0.0001) were also reported. The control group 
showed a significant improvement only in the physical 
component summary44 (p=0.03). Significant differences 
between the two groups in favor of the intervention 
group were reported for both the psychological and phys-
ical component summary44 (p<0.01; p=0.03). Depression 
levels dropped and reached statistical significance only in 
the intervention group35 (p=0.03). Changes in perceived 
pain and neuropathy symptoms were reported as pain 
significantly decreased between groups favoring the 
intervention group41 (p=0.04). Also, a significant decline 
in foot conductance was reported in the control group41 
(p=0.03), suggesting that the intervention might have 
stopped or slowed down the progress of nerve impair-
ment. Furthermore, statistically significant differences 
were reported in favor of the intervention group for 
self-esteem44 (p<0.01), nutritional efficacy44 (p<0.0001) 
and general efficacy44 (p=0.01).
Overall, the results suggest that a plant-based diet could 
improve the overall quality of life, psychological well-
being and chronic diabetic neuropathy in people with 
T2D without changes in food enjoyment and diet costs. 
In addition, the slight increase in electrochemical skin 
conductance in the intervention group and the signifi-
cant decline of the control group41 make plant-based diet

Adherence, acceptability and diet behavior
Five studies36 37 39 41 44 reported greater adherence among 
the participants of the intervention group compared with 
the control group, while one study43 showed high adher-
ence among both groups. Also, one study40 reported 
complete adherence to the plant-based intervention diet 
in approximately half of participants (44%). In contrast, 
Lee et al45 reported that the control group reported 
higher adherence (p=0.002) compared with the inter-
vention group, while the percentage of participants who 
reported high adherence was significantly higher in the 
control group compared with the intervention group 
(p<0.001).
Dietary restraint increased to a greater extent only 
in the control group,35 37 suggesting that the control 
group felt more constrained by their assigned diet than 
the participants of the plant-based diet group. Dietary 
disinhibition decreased significantly only in the inter-
vention group (p=0.01) in one study,35 while Barnard et 
al37 reported that it declined in both groups, suggesting 
that individuals in both groups were feeling less hungry 
compared with baseline and they were less likely to 
overeat as a response to stressful stimuli. Also, no signif-
icant differences between the two groups were reported 
with regard to food acceptability.37 Within-group anal-
ysis demonstrated significant improvement in levels of 
energy only in the intervention group (p<0.001),37 while 
the control group reported significant improvement in 
digestion (p<0.05).37
Overall, the results showed that even though the plant-
based diets were slightly more demanding in initial effort, 
adherence was greater among those in the intervention 
groups compared with the control groups, suggesting 
high rates of acceptability of the plant-based diet among 
the participants of the intervention groups. In addition, 
control group diets were more likely to be described as 
constraining, and as a result dietary restraint was higher 
in the control groups.
hbA1c and diabetes control
All nine studies provided baseline and end-line measures 
for HbA1c. In eight studies the decrease of HbA1c was 
greater among participants in the intervention groups 
compared with the control groups, while in one study40 
the decrease was similar in both groups. After excluding 
Wright et al44 for reasons of not reporting HbA1c 
levels specifically for participants with T2D and after 
performing weighting statistical adjustment, the mean 
difference among the eight studies that provided specific 
HbA1c levels for participants with T2D between baseline 
and end-line measurements shows a decrease of 0.55% 
in the intervention groups and 0.19% in the control 
groups. The results suggest that participants in the inter-
vention groups managed to better control their diabetes

studies36 
40 
among 
participants whose medication remained unchanged 
showed a greater decrease of 1% in the intervention 
group compared with a decrease of 0.2% in the control 
group in one study40 and significantly decreased by 0.9% 
only in the intervention group (p=0.002) in the other.36
In addition, an analysis among participants who 
reported high adherence showed a greater difference 
of HbA1c levels between the two groups45: a significant 
within-group decrease of 0.9% in the intervention group 
(p<0.01) and a significant within-group decrease of 0.3% 
in the control group (p<0.05). The reported decrease 
between the two groups was significantly greater in the 
intervention group compared with the control group 
among participants of high adherence (p=0.01).45
Further medical outcomes
Six studies reported a reduction or discontinuation 
of diabetes-related medications among participants 
at end-line.36 38 41–44 Interestingly, Nicholson et al42 
mentioned that two intervention group participants on 
insulin decreased their insulin doses from baseline to 
end-line. Moreover, three intervention group partici-
pants decreased and one discontinued the oral hypogly-
cemic treatment.42 Additionally, two participants in the 
intervention group discontinued the antihypertensive 
medication at end-line.42 In contrast, participants in the 
control group did not have changes on their medica-
tion.42 Barnard et al38 reported that 35% (n=17) of the 
participants in the intervention group reduced their T2D 
medication in contrast to 20% (n=10) of the participants 
in the control group. Kahleova et al36 showed that the 
diabetic medication reduced in 43% of participants in 
the intervention group and in 5% of participants in the 
control group. Soare et al43 mentioned that from a total 
of seven participants on oral hypoglycemic medication in 
the intervention group, five of them discontinued their 
medication. In the control group one participant discon-
tinued the oral hypoglycemic medication treatment.43 
Similarly, Bunner et al41 reported that 10 participants in 
the intervention group reduced the glucose-lowering 
treatment, while in the control group one participant 
reduced the glucose-lowering medication. Moreover, 
four intervention group participants decreased the 
lipid-lowering medication, while no participant reduced 
it in the control group.41 Wright et al44 reported that two 
participants with T2D in the intervention group did no 
longer meet the criteria for T2D diagnosis at end-line.
Two studies reported an increase in diabetes-related 
medication at end-line,38 41 and one45 reported that 14% 
(n=7) of the participants in the intervention group and 
23% (n=12) participants of the control group increased 
the diabetes medication doses. Bunner et al41 showed that 
two participants in the intervention group and two in 
the control group increased the glucose-lowering medi-
cation. Also, the lipid-lowering medication increased in 
one intervention group participant and in three control 
group participants.41
Weighting statistical adjustment has been performed 
for all the mean values that follow. The review indicated 
a significantly greater weight loss in participants in the 
intervention groups (mean weight loss was 5.23 kg) 
compared with the control groups (mean weight loss was 
2.83 kg).36 38 41–43 Four studies36 38 42 43 showed a significant 
decrease in fasting blood glucose (FBG) only in the inter-
vention groups, while one study45 reported a reduction in 
FBG only in the intervention group but without meeting 
statistical significance. The mean FBG decrease was 22.91 
mg/dL in the intervention groups and 11.58 mg/dL 
in the control groups. Total cholesterol declined, with 
the reduction being greater in the intervention groups 
(mean decrease was 21.98 mg/dL) compared with the 
control groups (mean decrease was 11.14 mg/dL) in 
four studies,36 38 41 43 of which two36 43 reported significant 
results in favor of the intervention groups (p<0.0001; 
p<0.001). In addition, one study41 reported an increase 
in total cholesterol in the control group. Low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol greatly decreased among 
participants in the intervention groups (mean reduction 
was 12.43 mg/dL) compared with the control groups 
(mean reduction was 6.76 mg/dL) in five studies,36 38 41 43 45 
of which three36 38 43 showed significant reduction only in 
the intervention groups (p<0.05; p<0.01; p<0.001). One 
study41 reported an increase in LDL among participants 
in the control group. A greater reduction in triglycerides 
was reported in the intervention groups (mean decline 
was 12.86 mg/dL) compared with the control groups 
(mean decline was 5.79 mg/dL).36 38 41 42 45 One study38 
reported a significant reduction (p<0.05) in triglycerides, 
while two studies41 45 reported an increase of triglycerides, 
of which one41 showed an increase in both groups and 
the other45 showed that triglycerides surprisingly were 
increased in the intervention group and decreased in 
the control group. In both studies41 45 the results did not 
reach statistical significance.
dIsCussIon
This systematic review demonstrates evidence that a plant-
based diet can significantly improve psychological well-
being, quality of life, control of T2D measured by HbA1c 
and a number of physical characteristics (weight loss, 
FBG, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) in 
people with T2D.
Three studies reported results with regard to psychoso-
cial and quality of life outcomes.35 41 44 More specifically, 
there were significant improvements in the intervention 
group compared with the control group in depression,35 
emotional well-being,44 physical well-being44 and general 
quality of life.35 41 44 Further outcomes showed a signifi-
cant decrease of reported pain among participants in the 
intervention group.41 The participants of the interven-
tion groups reported greater psychosocial results and an 
improved quality of life in all three studies.

Participants’ adherence was reported in eight of the 
studies.36 37 39–41 43–45 Reported adherence was higher 
among participants of the intervention groups compared 
with the control groups in four studies.36 37 39 44 In contrast 
Lee et al45 reported that the control group showed signifi-
cantly higher adherence compared with the intervention 
group. A potential explanation for this difference might 
be the absence of weekly workshops, as Lee et al45 used 
only phone consultations, while the four studies with 
high adherence results in the intervention groups carried 
out weekly educational sessions. One study reported 
high adherence in both the intervention and the control 
groups,43 potentially because education was provided on 
a daily basis and the RCT was conducted in a supervised 
environment. Moreover, two of the studies monitored the 
adherence only in the intervention group and reported 
high41 and medium levels of adherence.40 These results 
of the systematic review suggest that providing consistent 
nutrition education can better support people to adapt 
more effectively to a plant-based diet, as high dietary 
adherence and compliance is linked with educational 
interventions.46–48
Three studies monitored the diet behavior and 
diet 
acceptability 
among 
participants 
in 
both 
groups.35 37 39 Dietary disinhibition significantly decreased 
in the intervention group, while dietary restraint signifi-
cantly increased only in the control group.35 Barnard et 
al37 reported that both diets were equally well accepted 
by participants in both groups. Kahleova et al35 results 
suggested that the plant-based diet was highly accepted 
by the participants as the dietary restraint and dietary 
disinhibition were significantly improved in the interven-
tion group.
With regard to diabetes control, this systematic review 
demonstrates that a plant-based diet intervention can 
significantly reduce HbA1c in adults with T2D and poten-
tially reduce diabetes medication. Eight of the included 
studies reported baseline and end-line HbA1c levels of 
participants with T2D.36 38–43 45 All eight studies reported 
a greater reduction of HbA1c levels among participants 
in the intervention groups compared with the control 
groups, with an average decrease of 0.55% in the interven-
tion groups and 0.19% in the control groups. This result 
is consistent with the findings of previous research.29 
Furthermore, findings from six studies reported a reduc-
tion or discontinuation of diabetes-related medication in 
the intervention groups.36 38 41–44
Five studies reported significant greater weight loss 
in the intervention group (mean weight loss 5.23 kg) 
compared with the control group (mean weight loss 
2.83 kg) from baseline to end-line.36 38 41–43 Three studies 
reported significant improvements in FBG levels.36 38 42 
Two studies demonstrated a significant decrease in LDL 
cholesterol levels in the intervention groups,36 38 while 
one study showed a decrease in total cholesterol and 
triglycerides levels.38 There are studies that have demon-
strated that a plant-based diet can significantly lower 
total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and the 
overall risk for CVD.49–52 This is noteworthy because CVD 
is one of the main comorbidities of T2D53 54 and one of 
the main causes of premature mortality in the diabetic 
population.55–59
The present systematic review has several strengths. It 
is the first review, to our knowledge, that attempted to 
summarize the significant psychological outcomes of a 
plant-based diet intervention in adults with T2D. Further-
more, the included CTs were conducted in several 
different countries (Czech Republic, Italy, New Zealand, 
South Korea and USA), which suggests that general-
izability of the findings in the UK setting is likely. Also, 
reviewing CTs which focus on dietary patterns and not 
isolated nutrients makes the findings of the review easier 
to be applied to the general population. Finally, when 
plant-based diets were compared with official guide-
lines from a number of countries, the plant-based diet 
was found to be superior. Although this is a preliminary 
review of evidence specific to people with T2D, other 
research which includes but is not specific to people with 
diabetes supports the psychological findings.60 61
This systematic review also has limitations. The included 
studies had rather small sample sizes, although they were 
adequate to estimate significance levels. Another limita-
tion is that two of the studies were not randomized.39 40 
In addition, adherence in control trials regarding diet 
is difficult to be followed and measured by researchers 
because it is highly dependent on participants’ recalls, 
which might be inaccurate.
ConClusIons
Based on the evidence of the research analysis by this 
systematic review, it can be concluded that plant-based 
diets accompanied by educational interventions can 
significantly improve psychological health, quality of life, 
HbA1c levels and weight and therefore the management 
of diabetes. Furthermore, plant-based diets could poten-
tially improve diabetic neuropathic pain and the levels 
of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in 
T2D.
There is further need of studies to explore the rela-
tionship between psychological health, dietary patterns/
behavior and diabetes control. Future studies could 
explore ways of delivering proper nutritional educa-
tion in order to support participants to follow healthier 
dietary patterns.
