 Cost-effectiveness of Common Diagnostic Approaches
for Evaluation of Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria
Joshua A. Halpern, MD, MS; Bilal Chughtai, MD; Hassan Ghomrawi, PhD, MPH
IMPORTANCE Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is highly prevalent and may signal
occult genitourinary (GU) malignant abnormality. Common diagnostic approaches differ in
their costs and effectiveness in detecting cancer. Given the low prevalence of GU malignant
abnormality among patients with AMH, it is important to quantify the cost implications of
detecting cancer for each approach.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the effectiveness, costs, and incremental cost per cancer detected
(ICCD) for 4 common diagnostic approaches evaluating AMH.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A decision-analytic model-based cost-effectiveness
analysis using inputs from the medical literature. PubMed searches were performed to
identify relevant literature for all key model inputs, each of which was derived from the
clinical study with the most robust data and greatest applicability. Analysis included adult
patients with AMH on routine urinalysis with subgroups of high-risk patients (males, smokers,
age �50 years) seen in the primary care or urologic referral setting.
INTERVENTIONS Four diagnostic approaches were evaluated relative to the reference case
of no evaluation: (1) computed tomography (CT) alone; (2) cystoscopy alone; (3) CT and
cystoscopy combined; and (4) renal ultrasound and cystoscopy combined.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At termination of the diagnostic period, cancers detected,
costs (payer perspective), and ICCD per 10 000 patients evaluated for AMH.
RESULTS Of the 4 diagnostic approaches analyzed, CT alone was dominated by all other
strategies, detecting 221 cancers at a cost of $9 300 000. Ultrasound and cystoscopy
detected 245 cancers and was most cost-effective with an ICCD of $53 810. Replacing
ultrasound with CT detected just 1 additional cancer at an ICCD of $6 480 484. Ultrasound
and cystoscopy remained the most cost-effective approach in subgroup analysis. The model
was not sensitive to any inputs within the proposed ranges. Using probabilistic sensitivity
analysis, ultrasound and cystoscopy was the dominant strategy in 100% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The combination of renal ultrasound and cystoscopy is the
most cost-effective among 4 diagnostic approaches for the initial evaluation of AMH. The use
of ultrasound in lieu of CT as the first-line diagnostic strategy will optimize cancer detection
and reduce costs associated with evaluation of AMH. Given our findings, we need to critically
evaluate the appropriateness of our current clinical practices, and potentially alter our
guidelines to reflect the most effective screening strategies for patients with AMH.

 A
symptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH), the pres-
ence of 3 or more red blood cells on urinalysis in the
absence of genitourinary (GU) symptoms, is highly
prevalent, with population-based studies estimating that up
to 40.9% of US adults have this finding on urinalysis.1,2 Among
potential etiologies for AMH, GU malignant abnormality is of
particular concern, with studies showing that 0% to 11% of pa-
tients with AMH had malignant abnormalities.3-6
The high prevalence of AMH and its role as a potential har-
binger of malignant abnormality confers great importance on
thediagnosticalgorithmforitsevaluation.Manycliniciansand
policy makers, including the American Urological Associa-
tion (AUA), have advocated for diagnostic protocols that maxi-
mally detect occult malignant neoplasms, because delays in
treatment of GU cancer may result in patient anxiety, im-
pairedqualityoflife,andpoorclinicaloutcomes.7,8Othershave
sought alternative approaches, predominantly driven by the
fact that most evaluations for AMH return negative results for
malignant abnormality.6,9
The choice of diagnostic protocol for patients with AMH
has broad clinical and economic implications. The AUA-
recommended protocol, consisting of computed tomo-
graphic (CT) urography and cystoscopy, subjects patients to
tests that carry considerable risk of morbidity including pro-
cedural discomfort, urinary tract infection (UTI), contrast-
induced nephropathy (CIN), and radiation exposure, all of
which impact quality of life and generate health care costs.10-15
These costs must be weighed against the relatively low risk of
malignantabnormality.16DespitetheeconomicburdenofAMH
evaluation, there have been few studies evaluating its cost-
effectiveness, which have either focused on the role of screen-
ing urinary biomarkers or predated modern imaging.17-22 We
sought to determine the relative cost per cancer detected
among 4 diagnostic protocols for the evaluation of AMH, with
particular focus on the radiodiagnostic component, because
this is the source of greatest morbidity, cost, and controversy.
We hypothesized that the replacement or exclusion of CT from
diagnostic protocols would considerably reduce costs with
minimal compromise on cancer detection.
Methods
Model Overview
Wedevelopedadecision-analyticmodeltosimulatecancerde-
tection rates and costs associated with the evaluation of adult
patients with AMH. Diagnostic strategies were selected based
on international guidelines and alternative approaches en-
dorsed by experts in the literature. Patients entering the model
had 3 or more red blood cells on urinalysis, no history of GU
malignant abnormality, and concurrent negative urine cul-
ture results to exclude UTI. We assumed the presence or ab-
sence of GU cancer for each patient on model entry, and this
disease status was static throughout. The model horizon was
termination of the diagnostic period with either an accurate
diagnosis (radiographic or pathologic) or completion of fur-
ther diagnostic testing for evaluation of false-positive or inci-
dental findings.
Effectiveness was determined by number of cancers
detected with each strategy. We used a composite cancer
endpoint, which consisted of lower tract (bladder) urothelial,
upper tract urothelial (UTUC), and renal cell cancer (RCC).
For model purposes, upper and lower tract cancers were con-
sidered mutually exclusive. Although these cancers present
in tandem, this is an infrequent occurrence owing to the low
incidence of UTUC.
The model was programmed in TreeAge Pro (version 2015,
TreeAge Software Inc.).
Diagnostic Strategies
Four diagnostic strategies were evaluated. The first strategy,
combination of CT and cystoscopy, is considered the gold stan-
dard according to AUA guidelines, employing diagnostic tests
withthehighestaccuracyfordetectionofupperandlowertract
cancers, respectively.23,24 The second strategy, combination
of renal ultrasound and cystoscopy, meets the recommenda-
tions of multiple international guidelines, including the Dutch
GuidelineonHematuriaandtheguidelineoftheCanadianUro-
logical Association.25,26 Furthermore, despite AUA guide-
lines, many practitioners in the United States use ultrasound
in lieu of CT for AMH evaluation.2 Replacement of CT with ul-
trasound significantly reduces morbidity through avoidance
of radiation and radiographic contrast exposure. Likewise, ul-
trasoundischeaperandfurtherreducesdownstreamcostsgen-
erated by incidental findings on CT, though its sensitivity for
cancer detection is inferior.26,27
We compared these strategies to cystoscopy alone and
CT alone. Cystoscopy alone has been advocated based on the
observationthatGUtumorsassociatedwithAMHarepredomi-
nantly located in the lower urinary tract, whereas upper tract
tumors comprise just 5% of all urothelial neoplasms.9,28-30
Computed tomographic urography alone has been advocated
on the basis of improved sensitivity and specificity of mod-
ern CT for detection of lower urinary tract cancers, thereby
obviating the need for and sparing the morbidity of
cystoscopy.10,31,32 We did not evaluate ultrasound alone ow-
ing to the low sensitivity of ultrasound for detection of lower
tract malignant abnormalities, which accounts for the major-
ity of GU malignant abnormalities in patients with AMH,
thereby rendering ultrasound alone a poor strategy for initial
detection of malignant abnormalities in this population.33,34
We did not incorporate voided urine cytology into the
above diagnostic strategies because the AUA recommends
Key Points
Question What is the most cost-effective strategy for the initial
diagnostic evaluation of patients with asymptomatic microscopic
hematuria (AMH)?
Findings In this cost-effectiveness analysis based on inputs from
the medical literature, the combination of cystoscopy and renal
ultrasound was most cost-effective with an incremental cost of
$53 810 per cancer detected.
Meaning The combination of cystoscopy and ultrasound should
be considered first-line in the evaluation of patients with AMH.

 against its use for evaluation of AMH owing to poor sensitiv-
ity and minimal benefit.20,23
All strategies were evaluated relative to the reference case
of performing no evaluation.
Clinical Data
Table 1 shows parameter estimates for clinical inputs ab-
stracted from the literature. PubMed searches were performed
to identify relevant literature for all key model inputs, includ-
ing cancer incidence, diagnostic test accuracy, complications,
and guideline compliance. For each model input, the clinical
studywiththemostrobustdataandgreatestapplicabilitytothe
currentmodelwasselectedastheprimarymodelinput.There-
maining literature was utilized to generate ranges for sensitiv-
ity analysis. Cancer incidence among adult patients with AMH
in the United States were obtained from Loo et al,2 and inci-
dence among high-risk groups (men, smokers, aged ≥50 years)
werederivedfromthesamecohort.Rangesforincidenceamong
high-risk subgroups were obtained by inflating the incidence
of cancer in the general population using relative risk of cancer
among high-risk groups according to recent meta-analyses and
population-based studies.16,38
Sensitivity and specificity of tests for upper and lower
tract cancers were obtained from the literature. For strate-
gies using multiple tests, we assumed no synergy between
tests evaluating the same portion of the GU tract. For
example, the sensitivity and specificity of the strategy com-
bining CT and cystoscopy for detection of lower tract cancer
was assumed equal to that of cystoscopy, which demon-
strates higher accuracy.
Diagnosis of malignant abnormality was achieved with
the first radiographic or pathologic evidence of disease. For
radiographic diagnoses, morbidity and costs associated with
confirmatory pathological diagnosis were considered

 beyond the diagnostic window and thus excluded. False-
positive findings on initial evaluation resulted in scenario-
dependent confirmatory testing. Upper tract cancer on ini-
tial evaluation resulted in confirmatory testing consisting of
ureteroscopy, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
depending on the initial diagnostic modality. False-positive
findings for lower tract cancer resulted in confirmatory test-
ing consisting of cystoscopy and biopsy. False-negative find-
ings (ie, undetected cancers) necessarily impacted the effec-
tiveness of each strategy.
Complications and downstream consequences of each di-
agnostic evaluation were incorporated into the model. Cysto-
scopic interventions carried a 1.9% risk of febrile UTI, which
required repeat urinalysis and urine culture, 1 additional clinic
visit, and treatment with oral antibiotics.11
Cost Data
Cost inputs are presented in Table 2. All costs were evaluated
from the payer perspective and updated to 2016 US dollars ($)
using the medical care component of the Consumer Price
Index.60Discountingwasnotusedbecausethemodeltimeho-
rizon was less than 1 year. National average nonfacility costs
associated with diagnostic tests were obtained from the Medi-
care Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) and the Medicare Clini-
cal Laboratory Fee Schedule (MCLS).61,62 Cost ranges for sen-
sitivity analyses were obtained from the minimum and
maximum Medicare reimbursement across all Medicare Ad-
ministrative Contractor regions. Costs associated with phar-
macologic treatment were obtained from the Red Book.59
Additional costs secondary to incidental findings on CT
or complications, such as CIN, were abstracted from the
literature.13,14
Cost-effectiveness Analysis
Owing to the low prevalence of malignant abnormality asso-
ciated with AMH, cost and effectiveness outcomes were scaled
to a rate per 10 000 patients to optimize the possibility of de-
tecting differences between strategies. Incremental analyses
were performed by rank ordering strategies with increasing ef-
fectiveness relative to the reference strategy. Strategies that
were dominated (ie, more costly and less effective) were re-
moved,andanincrementalcostpercancerdetected(ICCD)was
calculated for each strategy. Repeated analyses were per-
formed for each of 3 subpopulations with unique risk of ma-
lignant abnormality (men, smokers, and age ≥50 years). We
usedawillingness-to-paythresholdof$100 000percancerde-
tected and performed sensitivity analysis using thresholds of
$50 000, $150 000, and $200 000.63
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed for all key
variables to assess model stability. Probabilistic sensitivity
analyses were performed using a triangular distribution with
parameters determined by the aforementioned ranges. Addi-
tional head-to-head sensitivity analyses were performed for
the 2 most optimal strategies according to ICCDs.

 National Expenditures
The annual national expenditures secondary to AMH evalua-
tion were estimated for the 2 guideline-endorsed strategies.
We used the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NAMCS) to determine the annual number of urologist visits
with a diagnosis of AMH in 2012 (485 222). Additional na-
tionalcostsassociatedwithuseofCTinlieuofultrasoundwere
determined by factoring the number of visits by the cost dif-
ference between these 2 approaches, assuming 100% compli-
ance with guidelines. Sensitivity analysis was performed using
published and abstracted rates of guideline compliance.2,64,65
Results
Base Case
Compared with no evaluation, CT alone detected the fewest
additional cancers, 221 per 10 000 patients (Table 3). At a cost
of $9 300 000 per 10 000 patients, the CT-alone strategy was
dominated by all others (Figure). Cystoscopy alone detected
222 cancers at an ICCD of $10 287 compared with no evalua-
tion. Addition of ultrasound resulted in the detection of 23 ad-
ditional cancers at an ICCD of $53 810 compared with cystos-
copy alone. Replacing ultrasound with CT detected just 1
additional cancer at an ICCD of $6 480 484, far exceeding the
willingness-to-pay threshold.
On 1-way sensitivity analysis, the model was stable with
variation of all inputs across the proposed ranges. A tornado
diagram of inputs to which the ICCD was most sensitive in a
head-to-head comparison of ultrasound and cystoscopy vs CT
and cystoscopy is presented in the eFigure in the Supple-
ment. Ultrasound and cystoscopy was the optimal strategy
across all 1-way sensitivity analyses.
Our results were stable throughout a probabilistic sensi-
tivity analysis using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. The
strategy of ultrasound and cystoscopy was optimal in 100%
of simulations.
Subgroup Analysis
Among high-risk groups, all strategies detected a greater num-
ber of cancers compared with the reference case (eTable in the
Supplement). For men, smokers, and those aged 50 years or
older, CT alone detected 382, 332, and 302 cancers per 10 000
patients,respectively.However,owingtohighdiagnosticcosts,
CT alone was dominated across all 3 groups. Cystoscopy alone
detected 384, 334, and 303 cancers at ICCDs of $6047, $6918,
and $7594, respectively, compared with no evaluation. The ad-
dition of ultrasound resulted in the detection of 39, 34, and
31 additional cancers for each high-risk group compared with
cystoscopy alone. Replacing ultrasound with CT detected just
2 additional cancers in each group. The ICCDs for this strat-
egy were more favorable (lower) than that of the base case but
remained well above the willingness-to-pay threshold at
$3 720 417, $4 297 326, and $4 727 059, respectively.
Our results were stable throughout a probabilistic sensi-
tivity analysis using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. The
strategy of ultrasound and cystoscopy was optimal in 100%
of simulations.
National Expenditures
In 2012, the diagnosis of microscopic hematuria was associ-
ated with 2.69% of patient visits to urologists, accounting for
485 222 visits. Assuming 100% urologist compliance with
guidelines, use of CT instead of ultrasound would detect 60.2
additional cancers nationally at an incremental cost of
$389 914 648 (Table 4). In the setting of imperfect compli-
ance, use of CT instead of ultrasound would detect anywhere

 from 3 to 38 additional cancers nationally at an incremental
cost ranging from $19 495 732 to $245 646 228.
Discussion
While routine urinalysis for screening of GU malignant abnor-
malities is not presently recommended by any major health
organization, hundreds of thousands of patients annually un-
dergo urinalysis for various indications and are found to have
microscopic hematuria prompting further evaluation. We
found that the combination of renal ultrasound and cystos-
copy was the most cost-effective approach for the evaluation
of AMH. The superiority of this approach over the use of CT
and cystoscopy is driven primarily by higher costs of CT and
its associated complications, albeit rare. These costs were ac-
companied by minimal gains in cancer detection because ul-
trasound technology nearly reaches the sensitivity of CT for
the detection of upper tract malignant abnormalities. Given
the low prevalence of upper tract malignant abnormalities in
patients with AMH, the small advantage in the sensitivity of
CT imaging modalities does not compensate for the signifi-
cant additional costs. Likewise, CT and cystoscopy was not a
cost-effective first-line approach among patients with higher
risk of malignant abnormality, because the absolute risk of ma-
lignant abnormality in this group remains low.
While ultrasound should be considered first-line, we urge
clinicianstoincorporateindividualizedpatient-careandshared
decision-makinginthepursuitoffollow-upCTorMRI.Though
guidelines target optimal population-wide policy, patient pref-
erences and risk factors must be considered on an individu-
alizedbasis.Guidelinesforthediagnosisandtreatmentofother
GU malignant abnormalities, most notably prostate cancer, in-
clude shared decision-making as a central tenet.66 Evalua-
tion of AMH should follow this paradigm, because risk toler-
anceforCT-associatedcomplicationsoruncertaintywithregard
tooccultmalignantabnormalitiesmayvary.Furthermore,each
clinical scenario may entail unique considerations or risk fac-
tors that have not been incorporated into the current model,
such as family history of malignant abnormality, high num-
ber of RBCs on urinalysis, or presence of multiple risk factors.16
In the wake of the Affordable Care Act, the landscape of
US health care has changed dramatically. Accountable care or-
ganizations (ACOs), along with other policy initiatives, con-
tinuetoemphasizehigh-valueandpatient-centeredcareacross
all medical disciplines. In particular, diagnostic radiology has
been recognized as an area ripe for transformation through
stewardship and paradigm shifts.67-69 Likewise, while sur-
geons and surgical care have been largely excluded from ini-
tial ACO models, recent authors have recognized that the in-
tegration of surgical care is paramount.70,71 The prevalent
condition of AMH sits at the crossroads of these 2 disciplines
and offers an opportunity for the provision of high-value, in-
dividualized patient care.9
Implementation of ultrasound-based guidelines will sub-
stantially reduce national expenditures associated with AMH
evaluation by up to $390 million. Although these reductions
are rough estimates and do not account for the costs associ-
ated with delayed diagnosis of cancers that would have oth-
erwise been detected by CT, they do represent a potential for
large economic savings. In addition, the recommendation of
ultrasound in lieu of CT may have the unintended but desir-
able consequence of improving compliance with hematuria
evaluation. Studies64,65 have demonstrated poor rates of uro-
logic referral and compliance with hematuria evaluation
among patients presenting to primary care physicians (PCPs).
Prior authors have speculated that these low rates result from
the unwillingness of PCPs to subject their patients to morbid
evaluations, and the replacement of CT with ultrasound
could therefore improve referral rates. Likewise, inclusion of
PCPs in the development of future guidelines may help to
ensure higher compliance, ultimately resulting in greater
cancer detection.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has a number of strengths. This is the first study
to comprehensively model the effectiveness and costs of
AMH evaluation in the era of modern imaging. Our findings
are strengthened by the robust data inputs derived from
extensive literature surrounding the incidence of cancer and
accuracy of CT in AMH evaluation. Furthermore, stability of
the model across all clinically determined ranges reinforces
the findings and provides strong evidence for changing clini-
cal practice.
However, our results must be interpreted in the context
of the study design. First, the study is limited by the short
model horizon, which prevented modeling the downstream
effect of missed cancers on stage at presentation, life expec-
tancy, quality of life, and costs. We chose the diagnostic pe-
riod based on the lack of data on delayed diagnosis of bladder
cancer, UTUC, and RCC. Second, owing to the heterogeneity
of GU malignant abnormalities and the paucity of literature ex-
amining the impact of early detection on quality-adjusted life-
years (QALY), we used the primary outcome of cancers de-
tected in lieu of QALY as a measure of effectiveness. Although
it is optimal for contextualizing population-based effects of
AMH evaluation, this approach did not differentiate effective-
ness and costs among patients with distinct types of GU can-
cers, nor did it model downstream costs of delayed cancer di-
agnosis. Whereas some studies have demonstrated poor
outcomes among patients with delayed diagnosis of urothe-
lial cancer, others have found that those with asymptomatic
and symptomatic presentations had equivalent oncologic
prognoses.72,73 Third, limited data existed on accuracy of ul-
trasoundforUTUCdiagnosis.Thoughsensitivityanalysescom-
pensated for these data, further studies are needed to better
determine the utility of ultrasound in this setting. Fourth, ow-
ing to limitations of NAMCS, estimates of national expendi-
tures presume evaluation of all patients with microscopic he-
maturia, including symptomatic patients, which may inflate
this estimate. Furthermore, we included only visits to urolo-
gists, which likely excluded a considerable number of pa-
tients who may undergo AMH evaluation by other providers
(eg, gynecologists). This portion of the analysis is intended as
anestimateforillustrativepurposesandmaynotpreciselycap-

with radiation from CT. On a population level over time, the

based protocol would not only prove less costly in the long
term, it would likely reduce overall morbidity secondary to ra-
diation, thereby strengthening the case for ultrasound-based

was abstracted from a review evaluating percutaneous coro-

owing to lower contrast requirement. However, this estima-
tion was accounted for in sensitivity analysis and did not
change model outcomes.12 Finally, MR urography was not

and inadequate access. However, MRI offers the advantage of
high sensitivity without radiation exposure and may be opti-
mal for specific patients.76
Conclusions
Thecombinationofultrasoundandcystoscopyisthemostcost-
effective among 4 diagnostic approaches for the initial evalu-
ation of AMH. The use of ultrasound in lieu of CT as the first-
line diagnostic strategy will reduce the cost, morbidity, and
national expenditures associated with evaluation of AMH. Cli-
nicians and policy makers should consider changing future
guidelines in accordance with this finding.
