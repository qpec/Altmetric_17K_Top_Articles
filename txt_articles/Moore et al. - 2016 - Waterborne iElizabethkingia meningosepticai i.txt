 Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an infrequent colonizer 
of the respiratory tract; its pathogenicity is uncertain. In the 
context of a 22-month outbreak of E. meningoseptica ac-
quisition affecting 30 patients in a London, UK, critical care 
unit (3% attack rate) we derived a measure of attributable 
morbidity and determined whether E. meningoseptica is an 
emerging nosocomial pathogen. We found monomicrobial 
E. meningoseptica acquisition (n = 13) to have an attribut-
able morbidity rate of 54% (systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome >2, rising C-reactive protein, new radiographic 
changes), suggesting that E. meningoseptica is a pathogen. 
Epidemiologic and molecular evidence showed acquisition 
was water-source–associated in critical care but identified 
numerous other E. meningoseptica strains, indicating more 
widespread distribution than previously considered. Analy-
sis of changes in gram-negative speciation rates across a 
wider London hospital network suggests this outbreak, and 
possibly other recently reported outbreaks, might reflect 
improved diagnostics and that E. meningoseptica thus is a 
pseudo-emerging pathogen.
E
lizabethkingia meningoseptica (formerly Flavobacte-
rium meningosepticum and, during 1994–2005 Chry-
seobacterium meningosepticum) (1) is a gram-negative 
nonfermenting obligate aerobe. It is widely distributed in 
the environment (2), yet also an acknowledged opportu-
nistic human pathogen. Most frequently associated with 
neonatal meningitis (3,4), the organism also has been de-
scribed in osteomyelitis (5) and skin structure infections 
(6,7). In addition, E. meningoseptica has been associ-
ated with colonization of the respiratory tract in venti-
lated adult patients, but causation of ventilator-associated 
pneumonia in this cohort is less clear; some studies have 
attributed pathogenicity (8–10), but others have found no 
attributable disease from colonization (11,12). Outbreaks 
have been linked to hospital water sources in adult critical 
 
care units (8,13); these outbreaks have been suggested to 
be attributable to the tolerance exhibited by Elizabeth-
kingia species to such environments.
Challenges in the laboratory diagnosis of this organ-
ism complicate a true understanding of its role in disease. 
Difficulties in culture, including variable (strain-depen-
dent) growth on MacConkey agar (1) and misidentification 
on some automated laboratory platforms (4,7), contribute 
to diagnostic challenges. Recent changes to clinical labo-
ratory practice, particularly the widespread adoption of 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight 
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, has improved confi-
dence in identification of nonfermenting gram-negative 
organisms (14) and specifically facilitated rapid identifica-
tion of E. meningoseptica from patient samples (15). How 
this advance confounds the reported epidemiology of this 
organism remains unclear and contributes to the lack of 
clarity around attributable illness. In the context of recent 
increased international reporting of E. meningoseptica out-
breaks among adults, including in the United States (10), 
Brazil (16), South Asia (17), and Southeast Asia (8,18), 
establishing whether E. meningoseptica is an emerging 
pathogenic organism is essential.
We report a retrospective observational study detailing 
an outbreak of E. meningoseptica acquisition in a London 
teaching hospital adult critical care unit in accordance with 
the ORION protocol (19), analyzing the clinico-physiologic 
response of patients who acquired E. meningoseptica, and 
deriving a measure of attributable illness. We analyzed case 
identification in the context of the wider changes to diag-
nostic laboratory practice to determine whether E. meningo-
septica is an emerging, or pseudo-emerging (i.e., previously 
present but unidentified or underidentified), organism (20).

surgery, tertiary referral vascular surgery, and major trau-
ma patients from a 400-bed London teaching hospital. The 
hospital is part of a wider 5-hospital network across West 
London with overarching institutional policies, including for 
infection prevention and control and antimicrobial steward-
ship. The critical care unit comprises 8 en suite single rooms 
(each with a room sink and a lobby sink) and two 4-bed bays 
(with 1 clinical sink per bed). Infrared taps are used in all 
clinical sinks. An off-site sterilization facility processes all 
endoscopes and procedural equipment. Critical care staffing 
levels meet mandatory requirements, and a multidisciplinary 
infection control team provides support with daily critical 
care antimicrobial rounds. A critical care resistant-organ-
ism screening program is in place, and all patients admitted 
for critical care have cross-infection screening comprising 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sampling (na-
sal and groin) at admission and then weekly, and resistant 
gram-negative organism sampling (rectum and throat) once 
per week.
Microbiological Investigation
A centralized microbiology laboratory processes samples 
from the 5-hospital network in accordance with standard UK 
laboratory operating procedures (21). Specifically, cross-
infection sample processing occurs in line with detection of 
extended-spectrum β-lactamase/carbapenem-hydrolyzing 
organism protocols (21). Blood cultures are incubated by us-
ing a BACTEC system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ, USA). Since June 2011, organisms have been identified 
by Biotyper MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Bruker Dal-
tonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) with previously described 
methods used for identifying nonfermenting gram-negative 
organisms (14,22); previously, identification was by API 
(bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Susceptibility testing 
is by disk diffusion using British Society of Antimicrobial 
Chemotherapy methods and interpretative criteria (23). A 
representative of the outbreak strain underwent MIC deter-
mination by using agar dilution for a broad range of antimi-
crobial agents at a national reference laboratory (24). 
Water from all clinical taps in the critical care unit was 
sampled for bacterial colonization in July 2012, July 2013, 
and December 2013. A total of 100 mL of water was col-
lected from each tap, filtered by using a 0.45-μ filter mem-
brane, and incubated on MacConkey agar in air at 37°C 
for 48 hours. Oxidase-positive non–lactose-fermenting 
colonies were subcultured onto nutrient agar and a 10-μg 
meropenem disk placed on the inoculum. Organisms dis-
playing meropenem resistance were further identified by 
using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Clinical and envi-
ronmental isolates were compared by using pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) of XbaI-digested isolate genomic 
DNA as previously described (25), except that switch times 
of 1–25 seconds were used.
Cases
The index case was identified on January 12, 2012, in a 
patient from whom E. meningoseptica was grown from a 
respiratory tract sample. This patient and all those in whom 
E. meningoseptica was subsequently isolated from clini-
cal or screening samples were defined as case-patients and 
are analyzed here. During January 2012–October 2013, we 
identified 30 cases from among 983 new patients admitted 
to the critical care unit.
Determination of Attributable Illness
All case-patients had retrospective interrogation of their 
electronic critical care records to determine clinico-phys-
iologic parameters (pulse rate, oxygen requirements, tem-
perature, C-reactive protein [CRP], leukocyte count, chest 
radiography); primary outcomes (discharge from critical 
care, death during admission); and antimicrobial history. 
The microbiology information management system was 
interrogated to identify all relevant isolates in the 7 days 
before or after acquisition, to which any evident clinical 
infection could otherwise be attributed. After excluding 
patients in whom multiple organisms were identified, we 
were able to identify case-patients with monomicrobial E. 
meningoseptica acquisition and, in this subgroup, analyze 
the trend in clinico-physiologic parameters in the 48 hours 
before and after acquisition. Three systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (SIRS) parameters were investigated 
(because most patients were ventilated, respiratory rate 
as a parameter was excluded): new temperature change to 
<36°C or >38°C, new increase in pulse rate to >90 beats 
per minute, and new change in leukocyte count to <4 >12 × 
109 cells/L. We investigated 3 additional criteria: new rise 
in fraction of inspired oxygen requirement >0.1, new CRP 
>100 mg/L, and new pulmonary infiltrates on plain chest 
radiography.
Outbreak Investigation
We undertook spatiotemporal analysis of cases by cor-
relating bed occupancy of confirmed case-patients against 
each other and possible environmental reservoirs to 
identify possible routes of cross-transmission or point 
sources. This analysis was reviewed against sequential 
interventions to determine effectiveness in outbreak cur-
tailment. Data from serial routine 6-monthly antimicro-
bial use point-prevalence studies (conducted across the 
hospital network) were analyzed to identify trends in 
antimicrobial use. We also analyzed the microbiology 
information management system to identify any other E. 
 
meningoseptica in the wider 5-hospital network during 
the outbreak period and for the 2 preceding years. This 
analysis enabled identification of any possible out-of-co-
hort secondary cases and enabled a wider analysis of the 
epidemiology of E. meningoseptica within the hospital

network. Ethical approval was not required for this study; 
outbreak investigation and analysis was classed as service 
evaluation by the head of regulatory compliance at the 
host institute.
Results
We identified 30 patients as acquiring E. meningoseptica 
during the outbreak, yielding an attack rate of 3% for pa-
tients admitted to critical care. The median age of E. menin-
goseptica case-patients was 45 years (range 17–83 years); 
73% were male (Table 1), compared with a critical care all-
admission median age of 55 years (range 8–95 years) and 
68% male. Before E. meningoseptica acquisition, the me-
dian time spent in the critical care unit was 17 days (range 
4–35 days), and 26 patients had received broad-spectrum 
antimicrobial drug regimes (piperacillin/tazobactam or 
meropenem) in the week preceding acquisition. Of the 30 
patients in whom E. meningoseptica was identified, 24 had 
the organism isolated from specimens taken for a clinical 
indication; for 6, the organism was isolated only through 
routine screening.
Microbiological Investigation
Identification of isolates from patients and water samples 
by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave spectra concor-
dant with E. meningoseptica for all isolates with relative 
intensity of matched peak scores >2.1. Disk diffusion 
susceptibility testing demonstrated in vitro resistance to 
amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, temocillin, cefu-
roxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ertapenem, meropenem, 
gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and colistin but sus-
ceptibility to ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, tige-
cycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The antibio-
grams were consistent for isolates from all 30 patients; 
MICs of selected agents for a representative isolate are 
shown in Table 2.

 RESEARCH
In addition to the isolates derived from patients, 7 E. 
meningoseptica isolates were identified from 5 sinks (1 in 
July 2012 when 2 additional taps were identified to have 
Pseudomonas spp. colonization; 4 in July 2013 when no 
further taps had Pseudomonas spp. colonization; no organ-
isms were identified in December 2013). Routine analysis 
of bronchoscope rinse water from decontamination units 
during the investigation period showed no growth.
PFGE typing (Figure 1) showed that of the 12 patient 
isolates retrievable, 7 shared a common PFGE pattern 
(denoted EZ1), 2 shared a different profile (EZ2), 1 had a 
further identifiable profile (EZ3), and 2 others had unique 
profiles. Comparative PFGE typing of the 7 environmental 
isolates demonstrated that 5 were indistinguishable from 
the EZ1 outbreak strain; the remaining 2 isolates shared a 
PFGE pattern not identified among patient isolates (EZ4). 
The 5 EZ1 environmental isolates were isolated from taps 
from 3 different sink units in the critical care unit.
Attributable Illness
Eleven of the 30 case-patients received antimicrobial drug 
therapy targeted at E. meningoseptica, in all cases for a 
clinical diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Thir-
teen patients were identified within the outbreak cohort 
in whom no discernible microbiological evidence of other 
pathogens was found in the 7 days before or after E. me-
ningoseptica acquisition (Figure 2). In the 48 hours be-
fore and after E. meningoseptica acquisition, in terms of 
SIRS response, 7 case-patients had new-onset fever, 7 had 
new tachycardia, and 8 had new leukocyte count change. 
Additionally, 4 had increasing oxygen requirements, 7 
had new increase in CRP, and 8 had new infiltrates on 
chest radiography. Moreover, targeted E. meningoseptica 
antimicrobial therapy was begun on 8 of these patients by 
the physicians coordinating care. Therefore, attributable 
illness (SIRS >2) from acquisition of E. meningoseptica 
in this outbreak was 54%.
Five case-patients died, including 2 of those deemed to 
have monomicrobial E. meningoseptica acquisition. How-
ever, the cause of death in those 2 patients was not due to 
infection; that is, no deaths were attributed to E. meningo-
septica acquisition in this outbreak.
Outbreak Investigation
Analysis of bed occupancy demonstrated that for most of 
the time the critical care unit had contemporaneous case-pa-
tients present. However, 2 notable periods where no cases 
were identified (October 2012–December 2013 and Janu-
ary–March 2013) suggested a point source was more likely 
than person-to-person transmission in perpetuating the out-
break. Spatial correlation was observed between all colo-
nized patients and environmental isolates in 1 quadrant of 
the critical care unit (2 side rooms and 1 bay); environmen-
tal sampling implicated 3 clinical sinks as the point source 
in this quadrant. No ongoing building or plumbing work 
elsewhere in the contiguous water system was identified.
Analysis of the antimicrobial point-prevalence stud-
ies showed that 63%–79% of all patients in the critical 
care unit were receiving antimicrobial drugs at any 1 
time, but no directional trend was exhibited. Antimicro-
bial drug use in the outbreak unit demonstrated no major 
difference from that in the other critical care units in the 
hospital network.
Estimating the Effect of MALDI-TOF Mass  
Spectrometry Introduction on Identification  
of E. meningoseptica
Interrogation of the microbiology information manage-
ment system identified 8 other E. meningoseptica isolates 
throughout the wider hospital network: 1 patient in the 
study hospital in March 2013 for whom no connection to 
the critical care unit could be established, and 7 patients in 
the 4 other hospitals in the network during January 2010–
October 2013. None of these were from critical care units, 
and no discernible health care contact was found among 
the case-patients. Only 2 of these 8 additional cases were 
detected before MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was in-
troduced into routine laboratory practice in June 2011, 
meaning 6 (and all 30 of the outbreak case-patients) were 
identified after its introduction. Further analysis of the mi-
crobiology information management system revealed that 
throughout the hospital network during January 2010–June 
2011, a total of 17% of non–lactose-fermenting gram-neg-
ative organisms were not identified to genus/species level; 
after introduction of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, 
during July 2011–October 2013, this percentage decreased 
to 10.9%.

with caution. 
 
  E. meningoseptica in Adult Critical Care
Water Reservoirs and Control
Interventions to attempt containment of the outbreak in-
cluded (sequentially): domestic process review (single 
cloth per sink; “clean-to-dirty” cleaning protocol) and de-
cluttering of clinical areas (August 2012); instigation of 
daily sink trap chlorination in all clinical sinks (August 
2012); exchange of clinical sink traps (September 2012); 
and water course remodeling, including removal of flexi-
ble tubing segments (September–December 2012). Use of 
alcohol gel after hand washing was advocated throughout 
the outbreak. These steps failed to control the outbreak; 
however, after initiation of 3 times per day automated 
flushing of all clinical tap units in October 2013, water 
testing in December 2013 demonstrated an absence of E. 
meningoseptica or Pseudomonas species, and no further 
isolates were identified from patients in the critical care 
unit from November 2013 onward. The exception was 1 
isolate from a cross-infection sample in a patient admitted 
in April 2014, detected from screening samples taken on 
the day of admission; typing of this organism showed a 
unique PFGE profile not related to any of the previously 
identified isolates.
Discussion
In the context of a prolonged outbreak of E. meningoseptica 
acquisition in an adult critical care unit of a London teach-
ing hospital, we found that acquisition of this organism was 
associated with clinically significant attributable illness in 
approximately half of patients, evidence against this organ-
ism being a nonpathogenic colonizer. We found clinical and 
molecular epidemiologic evidence indicating acquisition is 
associated with water sources in the critical care unit; how-
ever, within these water samples we also identified numer-
ous varied strains of E. meningoseptica, suggesting more 
widespread dissemination of this organism than previously 
thought. From our analysis of microbiology data throughout 
the hospital network, we found a marked excess of identi-
fied E. meningoseptica (both outbreak and nonoutbreak) and 
a contemporaneous decrease in unspeciated nonfermenting 
gram-negative organisms after MALDI-TOF mass spec-
trometry was introduced. We propose that wider introduc-
tion of this technology across clinical laboratories might be 
overcoming previous difficulties in identifying E. meningo-
septica, possibly contributing to the recent increase in report-
ed outbreaks of this emerging pathogen (8,10,16–18).

flammatory markers occurred in half of the patients who 
acquired E. meningoseptica and culminated in clinical de-
cisions to instigate targeted therapy in the absence of any 
other organisms. This finding suggests E. meningoseptica 
causes clinical infection and does not just colonize pa-
tients in critical care. Furthermore, the high frequency of 
isolation of E. meningoseptica from respiratory samples 
across the outbreak cohort, combined with new-onset ra-
diographic changes in half of patients with monomicrobial 
E. meningoseptica, suggests that this pathogen is a cause 
of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Biological plausibility 
exists, with virulence factors including a propensity for 
biofilm formation (26,27), intracellular invasion (28), and 
chromosomal (29) and plasmid (30) mediated resistance 
to many antimicrobial drugs, including commonly used 
β-lactams. This marked antimicrobial drug resistance has 
been previously documented to include 3 blaCME genes 
coding for extended-spectrum serine-β-lactamase (Ambler 
class D) and 2 unrelated metallo-β-lactamases conferring 
carbapenem resistance: blaB (subclass B1) and blaGOB (sub-
class B3) (31). Acquisition of further resistance elements, 
including blaKPC, also has been documented (32). Pheno-
typic susceptibility testing on the isolates from this out-
break supports such a marked resistance phenotype, par-
ticularly to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs. This high level of 
antimicrobial resistance may have accounted for the excess 
appearance of the organism in patients who had a history of 
broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug therapy; 87% of the pa-
tients who acquired E. meningoseptica had a history of pre-
ceding antimicrobial use (predominantly piperacillin/tazo-
bactam and meropenem), compared with a background of 
63%–79% among nonoutbreak critical care patients. Drug 
resistance also led to a limited armamentarium with which 
to treat; whereas our treatment strategies were susceptibil-
ity testing driven (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and tige-
cycline), other agents have been advocated, including some 
typically considered to target gram-positive organisms (3).
The noted potential for E. meningoseptica to display 
a strong biofilm biotype might also explain the failure of 
many of the infection control interventions during this out-
break. The failure of chlorine has been documented (33), 
but use of post–hand washing alcohol gel, previously found 
effective in terminating outbreaks (13,34), was not effec-
tive in our experience. The apparent success of regular sink 
flushing in terminating our outbreak might be attributed to 
the sheer force exerted during this process and is advocated 
in recent UK guidance for augmented care areas where 
waterborne pseudomonads are of concern (35). The return 
of the organism in a single patient in April 2014, seven 
months after the proposed outbreak termination, might be 
attributable to a failure in the automated flushing protocols 
but more likely represents contamination from a sink in 
a nearby area of the hospital (i.e., operating rooms) that 
does not practice the auto-flushing protocol or from outside 
the health care environment. Biofilm formation also might

Figure 2. Clinicophysiologic parameters of patients with monomicrobial acquisition of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in an outbreak 
in an adult critical care unit, London, UK, 2012–2013. Thirteen patients in the outbreak cohort were identified as having monomicrobial 
E. meningoseptica acquisition. Of these, 8 patients demonstrated an increase in 5 clinicophysiologic parameters of inflammation during 
the 48 hours before and after acquisition of E. meningoseptica: A) body temperature; B) oxygen saturation; C) pulse rate; D) lymphocyte 
count; and D) C-reactive protein. Patient numbers match those given in Table 1.

account for the observed predilection for respiratory tract 
acquisition, and we speculate that, in addition to antimicro-
bial drug therapy, in those with airway adjuncts repeated 
device changes might be helpful. Small-molecule disrup-
tion of biofilms might in the future provide an alternative 
therapeutic avenue (36).
The identification of numerous strains (albeit with 1 
predominating) of E. meningoseptica in patients and in wa-
ter sources suggests a wider issue in the water microbiome. 
The historical difficulties in identifying E. meningoseptica 
from other nonfermenting gram-negative organisms (in-
cluding Pseudomonas species) in both patient and environ-
mental samples mean that the advent of MALDI-TOF mass 
spectrometry might simply be helping to describe E. menin-
goseptica epidemiology, and the recent increase in reported 
outbreaks might indicate ascertainment bias. This possible 
bias is supported by the wider microbiology data, with few 
E. meningoseptica isolates being identified anywhere in the 
hospital network before introduction of MALDI-TOF mass 
spectrometry, after which not only were many more identi-
fied, but a concomitant fall in the frequency of nonidenti-
fied gram-negative organisms also was observed. Although 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry might therefore be aid-
ing the early phase of outbreak detection through improved 
organism identification, the extent to which this organism 
represents an emerging pathogen, as opposed to how much 
preexisted and is simply newly identified, is unclear. Fur-
ther work on the utility of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry 
in outbreak detection and investigation is warranted, and an 
additional role in typing might be feasible (37–40). Integra-
tion of this platform into clinical practice, as is happening 
in many laboratories, must be given due consideration as to 
such potential unintended consequences.
A failure to subculture many of the isolates from the 
cohort for PFGE typing is a noted limitation of this study. 
As described, however, variable growth on commonly used 
media is a feature of this organism. Moreover, the typing 
that was conducted was hardly circumstantial and was suf-
ficient to demonstrate a link between isolates from water 
sources and from patients. A further limitation of this study, 
in delineating the attributable illness, was the low number 
of patients for whom clinico-physiologic parameters were 
analyzed. However, inclusion of cases was purposefully 
strict, limiting cases to persons from whom no organisms 
other than E. meningoseptica were isolated. This restric-
tion was to enable changes in clinico-pathologic variables 
to be specifically associated with E. meningoseptica rather 
than any co-cultured organisms; however, the possibility 
remains that other organisms were present and not cultured.
Transmission of waterborne E. meningoseptica to 
adult critical care patients has an attributable illness rate of 
54%. Advances in rapidity and accuracy of microbiology 
diagnostics, including through adoption of MALDI-TOF 
mass spectrometry, is leading to increased detection of this 
organism providing an improved understanding of critical 
care clinical infections and the waterborne hospital micro-
biome. Consequently, the recent international increase in 
E. meningoseptica outbreaks in adults, including from the 
United States, Brazil, and South and Southeast Asia, might 
indicate a pseudo-emerging, rather than an emerging, nos-
ocomial pathogen. Further work is needed, and network 
analysis and whole-genome sequencing are likely to facili-
tate greater understanding of the wider transmission poten-
tial of E. meningoseptica. Given the attributable illness, the 
organism’s marked antimicrobial resistance profile, and its 
endurance against standard infection prevention and con-
trol procedures, development of robust interventions to 
combat waterborne outbreaks of this pathogen among criti-
cally ill adults is urgently needed.
