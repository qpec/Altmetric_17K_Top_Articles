Abstract
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a complex, multisystem disorder that can be disabling.
CFS symptoms can be provoked by increased physical or cognitive activity, and by ortho-
static stress. In preliminary work, we noted that CFS symptoms also could be provoked by
application of longitudinal neural and soft tissue strain to the limbs and spine of affected indi-
viduals. In this study we measured the responses to a straight leg raise neuromuscular
strain maneuver in individuals with CFS and healthy controls. We randomly assigned 60
individuals with CFS and 20 healthy controls to either a 15 minute period of passive supine
straight leg raise (true neuromuscular strain) or a sham straight leg raise. The primary out-
come measure was the symptom intensity difference between the scores during and 24
hours after the study maneuver compared to baseline. Fatigue, body pain, lightheadedness,
concentration difficulties, and headache scores were measured individually on a 0–10
scale, and summed to create a composite symptom score. Compared to individuals with
CFS in the sham strain group, those with CFS in the true strain group reported significantly
increased body pain (P = 0.04) and concentration difficulties (P = 0.02) as well as increased
composite symptom scores (all P = 0.03) during the maneuver. After 24 hours, the symptom
intensity differences were significantly greater for the CFS true strain group for the individual
symptom of lightheadedness (P = 0.001) and for the composite symptom score (P = 0.005).
During and 24 hours after the exposure to the true strain maneuver, those with CFS had sig-
nificantly higher individual and composite symptom intensity changes compared to the
healthy controls. We conclude that a longitudinal strain applied to the nerves and soft tis-
sues of the lower limb is capable of increasing symptom intensity in individuals with CFS for
up to 24 hours. These findings support our preliminary observations that increased mechan-
ical sensitivity may be a contributor to the provocation of symptoms in this disorder.

 Introduction
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), often called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syn-
drome (ME/CFS), is a complex, multisystem condition that is associated with a substantial
impairment in pre-illness levels of activity and quality of life [1–3]. Individuals with CFS have
increased symptoms during and after various physiologic challenges, such as physical exercise
[4–6], orthostatic stress [7, 8], and cognitive tasks [9]. We recently reported that a different
physiological challenge—neuromuscular strain—also has the potential to aggravate symptoms
in those with CFS. In pilot work involving exposure to a 12 minute period of progressively
increasing supine passive straight leg raise (SLR), two young adults with CFS developed a
marked increase in fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, lightheadedness, and visual blurring [10].
These findings were extended in a larger study, in which 48 adolescents and young adults with
CFS had significantly more areas of abnormal range of motion than healthy controls matched
for sex and level of joint hypermobility. Moreover, in response to physical examination maneu-
vers that added an elongation strain to the nervous system and related soft tissues, CFS patients
were more likely to develop abnormal symptomatic responses to the individual maneuvers and
to the overall physical assessment [11]. Taken together, these observations are consistent with
reduced compliance in the nervous system and its associated connective tissues in subjects
with CFS, and with the hypothesis that increased mechanical sensitivity may be a contributor
to the generation and exacerbation of CFS symptoms.
The current study was designed to further investigate this interaction between CFS symp-
toms and neuromuscular strain. We randomized individuals with CFS and healthy controls to
either a true passive straight leg raise neuromuscular strain or a sham neuromuscular strain.
We hypothesized that those with CFS exposed to the true strain would have a greater degree of
symptom exacerbation than healthy controls exposed to the same strain, and that among those
with CFS, individuals exposed to the true strain would report increased fatigue, body pain,
lightheadedness, difficulty with concentration and headaches as well as a greater overall
increase in CFS symptoms during the maneuver and 24 hour hours later compared to those
undergoing the sham strain.
Methods
Study participants
Individuals with a physician diagnosis of CFS were eligible if they satisfied the 1994 Interna-
tional Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group criteria for CFS [1] and were aged 16–55 years.
Participants were asked to refrain from taking their morning doses of vasoactive drugs such as
stimulants, modafanil, midodrine, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and salt tablets, but otherwise
remained on their usual medications. Healthy controls were eligible if they were aged 16–55
years and reported good, very good, or excellent general health. Controls were also asked to
skip morning doses of any of the vasoactive medications mentioned above.
Exclusion criteria included conditions expected to interfere with the passive SLR, such as
recent lower limb or pelvic fractures, sprains, casting, any prior lower limb or pelvic surgery,
known neuropathy, arthritis, cerebral palsy, developmental anomalies, pregnancy, or severe
obesity. Healthy controls were excluded if they had self-reported CFS or fibromyalgia, postural
tachycardia syndrome, neurally-mediated hypotension, recurrent syncope, or other health con-
ditions that contribute to pain and fatigue.
Individuals with CFS were recruited from past CFS studies conducted by the investigators,
as well as from the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Chronic Fatigue Clinic, media advertisements, tar-
geted mailings, and CFS support groups. Controls were recruited from media advertisements

 and flyers circulated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Prospective participants were assessed
during a phone screen. If they met eligibility criteria, they were invited to participate in the
study, which was conducted during a half-day visit to the hospital. Written informed consent
was obtained from all study participants 18 years of age or older. Those under 18 years pro-
vided verbal assent and written informed consent was granted by the parent. The study was
approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.
Study design
Following the completion of a battery of baseline questionnaires and baseline examination
measurements (described below), participants were positioned supine at rest for 15 minutes to
allow heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) to stabilize. They were then exposed to either a
15-minute true neuromuscular strain or a 15-minute sham test (Fig 1) as determined by the
randomization code.
Heart rate, BP, and symptom intensity ratings were assessed every 5 minutes during and 5
minutes after completion of the strain or sham maneuver. Twenty-four hours after the study
visit, participants were contacted by telephone and asked to rate their symptoms.
Baseline questionnaires
Participants completed the following assessments of health-related quality of life before under-
going the strain or sham maneuvers:
1. Wellness score, a valid and reliable single-item measure that asks respondents to numeri-
cally rate their general sense of well-being over the past month, with 0 representing death
and 100 representing as good as a person could feel [12, 13].
2. Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), a 20-item scale that examines five dimensions
of fatigue [14]. Higher scores indicate worse fatigue.
3. Symptom intensity, a subjective numerical score (on a 0–10 scale, with 0 indicating absence
of the symptom and 10 indicating its greatest intensity) assigned by the respondent to symp-
toms of fatigue, body pain, lightheadedness, difficulty with concentration, and headaches.
4. Wood Mental Fatigue Inventory (WMFI), a subjective rating scale for nine mental fatigue
symptoms. Higher scores indicate worse cognitive difficulty [15].

 5. Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), a 20-item questionnaire which
measures depressive mood [16]. Higher scores indicate a greater burden of depressive
symptoms.
6. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21-item scale with each item scored on a scale of 0–3.
Scores of 0–21, 22–36, >36 indicate very low, moderate, and high anxiety, respectively [17].
Baseline examinations
All participants underwent a tender point examination for the presence or absence of tender-
ness at the 18 sites specified in the 1990 American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia clas-
sification criteria [18]. Testing for joint hypermobility was also performed using the 9-point
Beighton scoring method [19].
Strain and sham maneuvers
Participants were informed that the purpose of the study was to measure the way in which
placing a strain on the nerves and muscles of the lower limb affected common CFS symptoms.
Participants were randomized 1:1 within each of the two groups (CFS and healthy controls) to
a true neuromuscular strain or a sham strain, each lasting 15 minutes. To ensure that range of
motion was similar between strain and sham groups and to compare range of motion between
those with CFS and healthy controls, all participants underwent measurement of passive SLR
range of motion before the study procedure. During the SLR range of motion measurement,
participants were instructed to report when they felt any ipsilateral lower limb stretch at all,
even a slight one, and this was deemed the onset of stretch. The hip angle for the onset of
stretch was recorded, as was the end-range angle. End-range was defined as the hip angle at
which the participants indicated they did not want the limb raised further.
Because range of motion varies among individuals, we did not specify a pre-determined
angle of SLR for the neuromuscular strain, as a given angle might create an insufficient strain
for those with increased range of motion, and might be excessively uncomfortable for those
with restricted range of motion. We therefore chose the mid-way point between the onset of
stretch and end-range as the angle of the passive SLR for the true neuromuscular strain group.
For the 15 minute passive SLR strain maneuver, the research staff passively supported the
non-dominant limb at the heel with the participant's hip flexed and knee extended at the hip
angle mid-way between the onset of stretch and end range. For the 15 minute sham SLR
maneuver, the research staff positioned the non-dominant limb in 5 degrees of hip flexion with
rolled towels placed behind the knee and ankle to minimize the neural strain and the likelihood
of associated symptom generation. Participants were instructed to not actively assist with mus-
cle contraction to maintain the limb position. Extraneous limb movements were discouraged,
and conversation between staff members and the participant was limited to essential instruc-
tion only.
Heart rate and BP were measured at baseline and once every 5 minutes with an automated
sphygmomanometer for the duration of the test. At baseline, every 5 minutes during the
maneuver, and 5 minutes afterwards, the research assistant asked participants to verbally
report their symptom intensity scores at that moment on the 0–10 scale. The verbal response
were chosen because completing written responses to the symptom intensity questions was
impractical for participants when positioned supine, and would have superimposed a neuro-
muscular upper limb strain that would have interfered with measuring the response to SLR.
All participants were asked to refrain from moderate strenuous physical activity in the
period between the end of the testing and their follow-up phone call 24 hours after the testing.

 At 24 hours, participants were asked to provide their current symptom intensity ratings using
the 0–10 scale, as well as to complete two brief questionnaires, namely the Wellness Score and
the WMFI.
Sample size and randomization procedures
The main comparison of interest was the difference in symptom scores between individuals
with CFS exposed to the true neuromuscular strain or to the sham maneuver. We considered a
10% higher symptom score (for any of the five CFS symptoms, namely fatigue, body pain,
lightheadedness, difficulty with concentration, and headaches) during the study maneuver and
24 hours later to be clinically significant. A sample size of 30 per group for those with CFS had
an 80% power to detect a 10% higher increase in symptoms in those exposed to the true SLR
neuromuscular strain.
We chose a healthy control group to assess whether the impact of the study maneuvers on
those with CFS differed from the impact on healthy individuals. Based on pilot work showing
minimal impact on healthy individuals, we estimated that 20 healthy controls would answer
this question.
Two separate randomization sequences were maintained, one for those with CFS and one
for healthy controls. Within these categories, the randomization to strain or sham groups was
conducted using a table of random numbers generated by one of the investigators (KRF). The
randomization was not blocked. The assignment to strain or sham groups was kept in sequen-
tially numbered opaque envelopes, which were opened by the research assistant after the par-
ticipant had been enrolled.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics between individuals with CFS and healthy controls were compared
with t-tests, or Mann-Whitney U tests depending on the data’s distribution. Categorical char-
acteristics were compared using the Chi-square test or Fischer’s exact test depending on the
distribution across categories. In addition to individual symptom intensity scores, we created a
composite symptom score by summing the five individual symptom scores (maximum
score = 50). To evaluate changes in individual symptom intensity scores from the baseline
score in response to the neuromuscular strain maneuver, we calculated two change scores. One
change score was based on the highest symptom intensity score reported during the strain or
sham maneuver, and the other was based on the score at 24 hours after the procedure. In com-
paring changes in individual symptom intensity scores for fatigue, body pain, lightheadedness,
difficulty with concentration, and headaches, we performed a two-factor (CFS vs healthy con-
trol and type of strain) regression analysis with an interaction term adjusting for their baseline
values. The numbers of symptoms with at least 2-point increases in intensity were compared
across the groups with the Chi-square test. The analyses were performed using STATA v12
(STATA Corp, College Station, TX) and SPSS v23 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Statistical significance
was P<0.05. Marginal statistical significance was between 0.10 and 0.05.
Results
Participants
Eighty individuals (60 with CFS and 20 healthy controls) enrolled in the study and all com-
pleted the study protocol. Only 5 subjects in our study had been enrolled in the pediatric CFS
clinic or had participated in prior pediatric CFS studies at Johns Hopkins. There was no differ-
ence between CFS and healthy control groups with regard to demographic variables (Table 1).

 As expected, on all measures of quality of life, individuals with CFS reported significantly
worse function than healthy controls (P < 0.001). The mean (SD) angle of the mid-point
between the onset of stretch and end-range for the SLR was 71 (14) degrees for healthy controls
and 61 (17) for those with CFS (P = 0.02). For 88% of participants, the non-dominant leg was
the left leg.
The randomization showed similar results in demographic, quality of life, and examination
variables between those in the strain or sham groups for both healthy controls and CFS partici-
pants (Table 2).
Primary outcomes
The individual and composite symptom intensity scores at baseline, at the 5, 10, and 15 minute
points during the strain maneuver, and at 5 minutes and 24 hours afterwards are shown in
Table 3. Two factors limited the ability to identify a true change in symptoms using unadjusted

 statistical techniques. First, fatigue intensity scores were significantly higher at baseline for the
CFS sham group than the CFS strain group (6.54 [1.67] vs. 5.38 [2.34]; P = 0.03). Second,
among the 60 CFS participants, 17% had at least one symptom score of 9 or 10 at baseline,
which thus limited their ability to report an increase in these symptoms due to the ceiling effect
of the 0–10 scale. As a result, we used a regression analysis to examine the differences in symp-
tom intensity change after adjusting for baseline values.

 hours minus the baseline score) are shown in Table 4. Compared to healthy controls exposed
to the 15 minute SLR, CFS participants exposed to the same neuromuscular strain maneuver
had a significantly greater mean change in intensity of all symptoms, adjusted for baseline val-
ues, during the maneuver (Table 4). For example, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI])
change in fatigue intensity was 2.78 (0.35, 5.20) points higher in CFS participants than in
healthy controls, and the mean (95% CI) change in body pain severity was 2.05 (0.87, 3.23)
points higher in CFS participants than in controls. Similarly, at 24 hours post-maneuver, the
CFS strain group had significantly greater change in symptom intensity compared to healthy
controls exposed to the strain maneuver for all symptoms except headaches.
CFS Strain vs. CFS Sham groups: As shown in Table 4, during the maneuver, the mean
(95% CI) difference between baseline and peak symptom intensity was 0.94 (0.07, 1.81) points
greater in the CFS strain group than in the CFS sham group for body pain, and 1.13 (0.17, 2.08)
points higher in the CFS strain group for difficulty with concentration. The mean difference in
fatigue severity was 0.72 (-0.01, 1.45) points higher in the strain group (marginally significant).
Changes in the intensity of lightheadedness and headache did not differ between groups during
the 15 minute maneuver.
Despite no difference in change for lightheadedness during the maneuver, at 24 hours post-
maneuver, those in the CFS strain group had mean (95% CI) scores 1.75 (0.78, 2.72) points
higher for lightheadedness. No other changes in individual symptom intensity scores differed
between groups at 24 hours post-maneuver.

with CFS than healthy controls exposed to the true strain maneuver (P<0.001).
CFS Strain vs. CFS Sham groups: CFS strain participants had a significantly greater mean
(95% CI) difference of 3.52 (0.41, 6.62) points in the composite symptom score during the
maneuver than CFS participants exposed to the sham maneuver (Table 4). The mean (95% CI)
difference in composite symptom score was 4.30 (1.32, 7.27) points higher in the CFS strain
than the CFS sham group at the 24 hour point.
Proportions with changes in symptom intensity scores of � 2 points
during and 24 hours after the maneuver
The high baseline scores of 9 or 10 for at least one symptom in 17% of those with CFS created a
potential to underestimate the magnitude of change in symptoms in response to the maneuver
due to a ceiling effect. To address this, we also performed a post-hoc analysis of the proportion
of subjects reporting at least a 2-point increase in at least 1 symptom, at least 2 symptoms, or at
least 3 symptoms during and 24 hours after the maneuver. As shown in Table 5 for all groups,
and as illustrated in Fig 2 for the CFS participants, a significantly higher proportion of the CFS
strain group than the CFS sham group had at least a 2-point increase in symptom intensity for
at least 1 symptom (84% vs. 61%; P = 0.04), at least 2 symptoms (63% vs. 36%; P = 0.04), or at
least 3 symptoms (47% vs 14%; P = 0.01). The difference between CFS strain and sham groups
was significant at 24 hours post-test for a change of at least 2 points in at least 3 symptoms
(44% vs. 18%; P = 0.03).
The mean (SD) wellness score did not differ between CFS strain and sham groups at 24
hours after the study maneuver [43(18) vs. 48(22); P = 0.40], nor did the Wood Mental Fatigue
Inventory score [17(9) vs. 15(8); P = 0.25].

Discussion
The main finding of this study is that a sustained longitudinal strain applied to the neural and
soft tissues of the lower limb was associated with an increased intensity of cardinal CFS symp-
toms during the maneuver and for up to 24 hours afterwards. Those with CFS exposed to a pas-
sive SLR strain for 15 minutes had a significantly greater exacerbation in all symptoms
compared to healthy controls exposed to the same strain, and a greater exacerbation of symp-
toms than those with CFS exposed to the sham strain. Among those with CFS, the difference
between the SLR strain and sham groups was evident when comparing the individual evoked
symptoms of body pain and impaired concentration for those groups and the combined symp-
tom score. At 24 hours after the study maneuver, CFS subjects in the strain group had signifi-
cantly more lightheadedness and a higher combined symptom score than those in the CFS
sham group. These differences in symptom intensity scores were relatively modest. Changes in
symptom intensity were more obvious when increases in symptom scores of at least 2 points
were assessed. Compared to those in the CFS sham group, a significantly higher proportion of
CFS subjects in the strain group reported increases of at least 2 points in at least 1, 2, or 3 symp-
toms during the study maneuver (47% vs. 14% for a change of at least 2 points in at least 3
symptoms; P = 0.01), and a higher proportion reported at least a 2-point increase in at least 3
symptoms at 24 hours (44% vs. 18%; P = 0.03).
Of interest, at 24-hours post-test, healthy controls in the strain group reported more symp-
tom changes of at least 2 points in any symptom (44% vs 9%), a marginally significant differ-
ence. While the study was not designed to perform statistical comparisons between the two
healthy control groups, the observed symptom changes suggest that the passive SLR strain
maneuver might be a broad physiologic challenge for all, but like exercise, orthostatic stress,
and cognitive stress, experienced at a much more profound level for those with CFS.
These findings complement earlier pilot data describing a marked change in fatigue, mental
fogginess, and lightheadedness during a progressive increase in SLR angle over 12 minutes
[10]. Our results also extend findings from an examination of limb and spine range of motion

 among 48 adolescents and young adults with CFS and 48 healthy controls matched by sex and
the degree of joint hypermobility. In that investigation, we assessed range of motion in
response to commonly-used physical examination maneuvers that add an elongation strain to
the nervous system and related soft tissues, including a passive SLR of only several seconds
duration. Of the 11 limb and spine regions examined, individuals with CFS had a higher
median number of areas of abnormal range of motion (5 vs. 2, P< 0.001), and were more likely
than healthy controls to develop abnormal symptomatic responses to range of motion testing
[11].
Biomechanical and physiological considerations with SLR
While the results of the current study confirm that individuals with CFS have an increased sen-
sitivity to SLR compared to healthy individuals, the mechanisms for transduction of that neu-
romuscular strain into increased symptoms are unknown. The structural and biochemical
responses of the nervous system to physical stress and elongation strain are relevant to this dis-
cussion. In the past several decades, work by Sunderland, Brieg, and others has investigated the
interaction between nerve mechanics and nerve function [20–25]. The nervous system’s nor-
mal adaptation to the range of limb and trunk movement in daily life involves accommodative
changes in length and nerve sliding within fascial beds. For example, the contents of the spinal
canal (including neuromeningeal and vascular tissues) must elongate to adjust to as much as a
5–9 cm length change of the spinal canal as one moves in standing from a position of full spinal
backward bend to full forward bend [20, 26]. The cord, meninges, and supporting vasculature
must undergo changes in length to accommodate this canal lengthening without altering con-
ductivity or other neural functioning.
It has been well established in cadaver studies that passive SLR exerts caudal traction on the
lower limb peripheral nerves, dorsal root ganglia, lumbosacral nerve roots, meninges, and the
sympathetic chain [20, 27–29]. The densely innervated thoracolumbar fascia would be
expected to be subjected to the same forces [30]. Evidence from human cadaver specimens and
from experiments in animals suggests that SLR also imparts an elongation strain to the entire
length of the spinal cord [28]. More recently, caudal displacement of lumbosacral nerve roots
and the spinal cord has been confirmed in living subjects. Using MRI techniques, Rade and col-
leagues identified a mean 3.5 mm caudal displacement of the conus medullaris during a 60°
passive SLR [31]. Of interest, 60° of passive SLR is the same mean angular displacement
recorded among the CFS participants in our study. Thus the neural and soft tissue strain in this
maneuver could have exerted a similar caudal strain on the cord and its coverings in our
participants.
Two further physiologic consequences of tension applied to the spinal cord during SLR can
be inferred. First, increased mechanical strain within the spinal cord—which can be caused by
acquired segmental, positional dysfunctions in the spine [32], or by tethering or deformative
stresses affecting the spinal cord, dura, and sympathetic chain [20, 33, 34]—could cause a lon-
gitudinal tensioning of spinal blood vessels, the result of which is narrowing of lumen diameter
[20]. In animal experiments, Dolan and colleagues demonstrated that application of a distrac-
tion strain to the spinal cord results in cord ischemia, with progressive impairment of spinal
cord blood flow as the distraction strain increases [35]. Yamada and colleagues used reflection
spectrophotometry to measure the availability of oxygen to neuronal mitochondria in an ani-
mal model of tethered cord syndrome. With increasing strain, there was evidence of increased
reduction of cytochrome a, a3, reflecting mitochondrial dysfunction [36]. Kobayashi and col-
leagues demonstrated that intra-radicular blood flow is reduced by a mean of 71% compared to
baseline during intra-operative SLR in those with nerve root compression due to bulging discs

 [37]. While the SLR imparted in our study would not have been expected to be severe enough
to result in the ischemic change seen with distraction or tethered cord, or with the reduced
nerve root blood flow seen with severe degenerative disc disease, these observations establish
the potential for passive SLR strain to contribute to at least transient changes in endothelial
shear stress and to transient reduction in blood flow to the nerve root and potentially to spinal
cord neurons.
Second, tension from the SLR is transmitted from the epineurium of the sciatic nerve to
the dural sleeves of the associated nerve roots and to the dural tube within the spinal canal
[22, 26]. Mast cells are distributed throughout the nervous system, including in the dura.
Mast cells are also known to degranulate in response to stretch [38, 39]. The release of hista-
mine, prostaglandins, and other biologically active substances in mast cells would have the
potential to cause both acute and delayed symptoms in response to SLR. Mast cell activation
has been hypothesized to be a pathophysiologic factor in CFS [40], as well as in the pathogen-
esis of symptoms in subsets of patients with postural tachycardia syndrome [41] and joint
hypermobility syndromes [42], two co-morbid conditions with an increased prevalence in
CFS [43].
Speculations about the pathophysiology of increased symptoms in
response to SLR in CFS
In the context of these physiologic correlates of SLR, why would this maneuver be associated
with only minimal perturbation in healthy individuals yet cause a significant exacerbation of
symptoms in those with CFS? Current theories of the pathogenesis of CFS symptoms implicate
heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to physical, orthostatic, and cognitive stressors
[44]. Among the hypothesized mechanisms for nervous system sensitivity are (a) a persistent
and abnormal stress response to a variety of precipitating and perpetuating conditions [45], (b)
reductions in cerebral blood flow [46, 47], a downstream effect of which is an increase in anaer-
obic metabolism, supported by observations that ventricular lactate levels are higher in CFS
patients than in either healthy or depressed controls [48], and (c) neuroinflammation in
response to infection, auto-immune inflammation, or other factors [49]. In a small controlled
study, Nakatomi and colleagues used PET scanning to identify increased binding of a ligand
for an 18 kDa translocator protein (TPSO) that is expressed by activated microglia. Individuals
with CFS had significantly higher binding than healthy controls in the midbrain, pons, and
thalamus (all P<0.01); binding was closely correlated to the reports of fatigue severity, cogni-
tive impairment, pain, and measures of depression [49]. While mechanisms for microglial acti-
vation were not investigated in the Nakatomi study, several of the proposed mechanisms for
CFS symptoms would be consistent with changes in microglial activity, including reduced cere-
bral blood flow, sympathetic activation, mast cell activation, or sustained immunological
responses to an initiating infection.
In light of these observations, we speculate that the increase in CFS symptoms after the
imposition of an otherwise mild mechanical strain like SLR could be consistent with the pres-
ence of a non-compliant or mechanically sensitized nervous system. The same strain is well tol-
erated by those with a non-sensitized nervous system. The development of symptoms such as
difficulty concentrating and body pain within 15 minutes of initiating the neuromuscular strain
is consistent with SLR provoking an acute physiologic response, likely affecting autonomic
tone or cerebral blood flow. The persistence or emergence of increased symptoms over the 24
hours following the neuromuscular strain is analogous to the gene expression changes reported
in the 24–48 hours after exercise in CFS [5].

 Study limitations
This study provides an initial description of the response of those with CFS to SLR. It had sev-
eral limitations. We are confident that the CFS participants in the SLR and sham strain groups
had similar demographic characteristics, illness duration and severity, and health-related qual-
ity of life. This suggests that the randomization was successful, and that the results reflect dif-
ferences in response to the study maneuver rather than differences in the severity of illness. It
remains to be seen whether the results we report would be similar in other groups with CFS, in
those with different durations of illness, or for individuals with different levels of physical
function.
Similarly, fibromyalgia is a condition with a substantial overlap with CFS, estimated to affect
30–70% of adults with CFS [50, 51]. Some of our study population met criteria for fibromyal-
gia, but we made no attempt to differentiate this subset. Because fibromyalgia tender point
scores did not differ between the CFS strain and sham groups at baseline, it is unlikely that an
unbalanced assignment of those with fibromyalgia to either experimental group occurred. In
future studies, the independent impact of fibromyalgia could be evaluated by including groups
satisfying the CFS criteria only, fibromyalgia without CFS, or both conditions.
The study was randomized, but blinding subjects to the degree of SLR was not possible. The
potential for biased reporting of symptom scores among those in the true strain group cannot
be excluded.
We did not measure symptom changes beyond 24 hours, so we cannot make definitive com-
ments about the duration of post-maneuver symptom exacerbations. Nonetheless, our results
suggest that neuromuscular strain is another mechanism for the generation of post-exertional
worsening of symptoms, regarded as a defining feature of CFS [2]. We also did not measure
changes in biomarkers at 24 or 48 hours, but these would be important to include in future
studies.
The impact of the neuromuscular strain may have been underestimated because some indi-
viduals had symptom intensity scores in the upper part of the 0–10 measurement range at base-
line. Without an objective measure of fatigue and pain, we relied on verbal self-report of
symptoms as the primary outcome. For those with a high baseline score of 9 or 10, it would
have been impossible to measure whether symptoms became substantially worse following the
SLR maneuver. In future studies, potential ways to address this problem would be to exclude
subjects with the highest baseline symptom ratings, to ask participants to report the degree of
improvement or exacerbation of symptoms on a Likert-scale, or to include a patient and clini-
cian global clinical impression of change score at the end of the maneuver that would supple-
ment the symptom intensity scores. Validated measures of symptom change such as the
Fatigue and Energy Scale [52] have been published since our study was designed, and have the
potential to provide an improved method of measuring change following provocation
maneuvers.
In a study with randomized assignment to the physiological strain, any measured differ-
ences between the CFS strain and sham groups were likely to be related to the study maneuver.
The randomization would have reduced the likelihood of marked variability in the degree of
orthostatic stress, physical exercise, or cognitive stress in the 24 hours after the study visit.
However, in the absence of an activity measure, we cannot exclude some influence of these fac-
tors on the 24 hour symptom scores.
Individuals with CFS can have impaired range of motion and mechanosensitivity in regions
other than the lower limb [11] in which case the SLR maneuver might be insufficient to pro-
voke symptoms. For this study, a simple and straightforward neuromuscular strain familiar to
most clinicians was selected as a means of introducing the concept of mechanical strain. Future

 studies of the phenomenon we have observed could add different sites of neuromuscular strain,
or add structural differentiation maneuvers that can better distinguish neural from myofascial
sources of symptoms [53, 54]. Methods to refine the maneuver and enhance tissue specificity
could include the addition of cervical flexion or ankle dorsiflexion while the limb is maintained
in the SLR position [54]. A report of symptom increase or decrease with the addition of joint
movement at locations beyond the points of attachment of the challenged muscles would
implicate nerve rather than muscle involvement.
Implications and future directions
Our findings have practical implications for the understanding of why exercise and the activi-
ties of daily life might be capable of provoking CFS symptoms. If a simple and relatively brief
passive SLR strain can provoke symptoms, then prolonged or excessive strain beyond the
usual range of motion in daily life might be followed by a similar exacerbation. A common
position that approximates the hip angle of a SLR maneuver is long sitting, as can occur while
reclining in bed with pillows to support the spine or when sitting with the right leg extended
and arms outstretched while driving. These positions each would be expected to add mechani-
cal tension to the nervous system. Such tension could be increased by ankle dorsiflexion or
plantar flexion. Further, some sleep or reclining postures could increase CFS symptoms
despite appearing to be positions of rest and recovery. Similarly, in a person with limited, but
symptom-free SLR who walks or runs with long strides, repetitive elongation strains of the
limbs or spine may readily induce CFS symptoms. Standing in stocking feet or in shoes with
flat soles likewise increases mechanical tension in the nerve tissues. The presence of such a
nuanced but profound means of symptom generation has practical implications for the care of
affected patients. Those with more marked restrictions in range of movement, or greater
symptomatic responses to longitudinal strain to the nerves and soft tissues, would be expected
to have a greater difficulty tolerating exercise. It is reasonable to hypothesize that treating
these areas of movement restriction—before advancing to more exertional activities—might
improve the ability of CFS patients to tolerate graded exercise. Consistent with this hypothesis,
in adults with a related condition, fibromyalgia, a randomized trial of neural mobilization
treatments has shown improvements in pain, fatigue, and adverse neural tension [55]. Further
studies are warranted to better understand the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of neuro-
muscular strain in CFS, and the optimal methods to restore more normal function to those
with the illness.
