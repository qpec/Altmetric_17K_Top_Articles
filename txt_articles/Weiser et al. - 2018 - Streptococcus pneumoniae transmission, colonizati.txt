Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae as a complex relationship with its obligate human host. On the one 
hand, the pneumococci are highly adapted commensals, and their main reservoir on the mucosal 
surface of the upper airways of carriers enables transmission. On the other hand, they can cause 
severe disease when bacterial and host factors allow them to invade essentially sterile sites, such as 
the middle ear spaces, lungs, bloodstream and meninges. Transmission, colonization and invasion 
depend on the remarkable ability of S. pneumoniae to evade or take advantage of the host 
inflammatory and immune responses. The different stages of pneumococcal carriage and disease 
have been investigated in detail in animal models and, more recently, in experimental human 
infection. Furthermore, widespread vaccination and the resulting immune pressure have shed light 
on pneumococcal population dynamics and pathogenesis. Here, we review the mechanistic 
insights provided by these studies on the multiple and varied interactions of the pneumococcus and 
its host.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as pneumococcus) is a Gram-positive, extracellular, 
opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the mucosal surfaces of the human upper 
respiratory tract (URT). Up to 27–65% of children and <10% of adults are carriers of 
S. pneumoniae and carriage involves a commensal relationship between the bacterium and 
the host1,2. Local spread, aspiration or seeding to the bloodstream results in invasive 
inflammatory diseases3 (Fig. 1). S. pneumoniae is a leading bacterial cause of a wide range 
of infections, including otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis and 
meningitis. As all of these diseases are ‘dead ends’ in the life cycle of the organism, the 
bacterial factors that cause invasive diseases must also be adaptive for colonization and/or 
transmission.

 In 2017, the WHO included S. pneumoniae as one of 12 priority pathogens. The continued 
high burden of disease and rising rates of resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics have 
renewed interest in prevention. The widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 
(PCVs) has reduced invasive disease of sero-types with the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) 
types that are included in the vaccine4 (Box 1). The remarkable capacity of S. pneumoniae 
to remodel its genome through the uptake and incorporation of exogenous DNA ( natural 
competence) from other pneumococci or closely related oral streptococci has facilitated the 
spread of antibiotic resistance and evasion of vaccine-induced immunity. The prominence of 
S. pneumoniae as a cause of disease is due to the combination of high carriage rates, its 
genetic adaptability and its ability to shift from a commensal to a pathogenic interaction 
with its host. In this Review, we discuss the bacterial, environmental and host factors that 
contribute to the different stages of pneumococcal disease.
Transmission of S. pneumoniae
Until recently, all that was known about pneumococcal contagion was that spread requires 
close contact with a carrier and/or carriers (especially young children), is more frequent 
during drier, colder months when airway secretions are more copious and is more likely to 
occur in conjunction with viral infections of the URT5–7. This general ignorance about 
transmission was a consequence of a lack of tractable animal models and an inability to 
study human-to-human transmission in sufficient detail. In 2010, airborne transmission 
among closely housed ferrets co-infected with influenza A virus (IAV) was described8. 
Another group modelled murine transmission from index pups colonized at 4 days of age to 
littermate contact pups in the setting of IAV co-infection9. Similar to human transmission, 
viral infection, close contact and younger age increased transmission. This infant mouse 
model has now enabled the study of the major steps during host-to-host spread, including 
exit from a colonized host (shedding), survival in the environment and acquisition by a new 
host.
Exit from the colonized host
IAV-induced inflammation stimulates both the expression of mucin glycoproteins and the 
flow of mucus10,11. There are more pneumococci in nasal secretions of pups with IAV co-
infection (Fig. 2), and only young mice shed S. pneumoniae at levels permissive for 
transmission12. Moreover, levels of shedding correlate with the extent of URT inflammation 
in response to IAV infection. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-deficiency, which is associated 
with an increased viral load and, subsequently, greater inflammation, results in higher rates 
of transmission, and this effect is specific to the index mice12. Furthermore, the effect of IAV 
is recapitulated by intranasal treatment of the index mice with the TLR3 ligand polyiC13.
The size of population bottlenecks in the infant mouse model during transmission was 
estimated by using marked isogenic bacterial strains13. In this study, all constructs 
colonized, shed and could be acquired in similar numbers by all pups. By contrast, after the 
index pup is simultaneously colonized with the marked mutants, in the majority of 
transmission events, only one of the mutants was successful. This tight population 
bottleneck during transmission would explain the need for large numbers of shed

 pneumococci for at least one to be successful in reaching a new host. Accordingly, 
increasing total shedding per cage by increasing the proportion of colonized index pups per 
cage to 50% made transmission to ∼30% of contacts possible without the need for IAV co-
infection14.
During early childhood, rhinorrhoea is pronounced, and clinical surveys demonstrate a 
relationship between secretion volume and S. pneumoniae density15. In the infant mouse 
model, dampening inflammation by intranasal dexamethasone treatment or the use of 
Tlr2−/− index mice reduces shedding and transmission16. The single pneumococcal toxin, 
pneumolysin (Ply), has strong pro-inflammatory effects, and Ply-induced inflammation 
hastens clearance of bacteria from the URT17. Both a ply-knockout mutant and a point 
mutant, in which the toxin is unable to oligomerize to form pores after membrane insertion, 
reduced URT inflammation, shedding and the ability to transmit to littermates16. 
Additionally, intranasal administration of the purified toxin, but not the inactive toxoid 
(PdB), could complement the inflammation, shedding and transmission defect of the ply 
mutant. This is the first example of a pneumococcal factor that is specifically required for 
transmission. These findings with Ply also provide a link between pneumococcal virulence 
and transmission18, suggesting that factors such as Ply that contribute to the disease state by 
enhancing inflammation also promote the transmission of S. pneumoniae.
As epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of different serotypes is highly variable, 
the role of capsule type and amount on shedding and transmission was tested using isogenic 
serotype-switch and cps-promoter switch mutants19. Some serotype-switch mutants 
colonized at wild-type levels but were shed and transmitted poorly in infant mice. Mutants 
with lower expression of CPS and thinner capsules were also shed and transmitted poorly. 
The capsule layer shields underlying surface adhesins, and mutants with reduced shedding 
and transmission showed increased binding to URT mucins in an in vitro assay. 
Encapsulation, therefore, may facilitate shedding by allowing escape from the mucus that 
lines the airway surface, with a thicker capsule or capsule of certain serotypes being more 
effective.
Survival in the environment
The extent of airborne transmission (as demonstrated by the ferret studies) versus contact-
dependent transmission (as shown by the infant mouse model) is unclear. A number of 
recent studies have examined factors that affect survival of S. pneumoniae outside the host. 
Transmission through secretions of carriers could involve direct person-to-person contact or 
spread involving bacteria on contaminated surfaces. As evidence of the latter, in the mouse 
model, the co-housed dam is not colonized but has large numbers of S. pneumoniae on her 
teats, and in-cage switch experiments can serve as a source of contagion9,16. S. pneumoniae 
can also be easily cultured from common objects, such as soft toys recently handled by 
colonized children20. Under ambient, nutrient-sufficient conditions, such as in ex vivo 
human saliva, pneumococci can survive for days21. Under nutrient-poor conditions, such as 
in airway surface fluid, bacterial expression of Ply increases ex vivo survival16. This effect 
can be explained by toxin dependent inflammation and, consequently, increased nutrients 
levels in secretions. Capsule expression from the cps locus increases survival in nutrient-

 poor environmental conditions, perhaps by providing a reserve of glycans22. Furthermore, 
pneumococci survive desiccation for many days, and biofilm bacteria retain viability in vitro 
better than planktonic bacteria20,23.
Acquisition by the new host
Given the importance of PCV in reducing transmission from immunized children, the infant 
mouse model has been used to explore the role of immunity in spread24. Pre-existing S. 
pneumoniae colonization of contact pups inhibits the acquisition of a new strain13. This 
bacterial interference could affect the frequency of co-colonizing strains. Passive 
immunization of contact pups with anti-capsular polysaccharide immunoglobulin G (IgG) is 
also sufficient to block acquisition, although this effect requires high levels of antibody and 
can be overcome by a large inoculum25. The protective activity of specific antibodies during 
acquisition is independent of Fc fragment-mediated effects but requires their 
agglutinating function, which could facilitate mechanical clearance by the 
mucociliary flow. However, S. pneumoniae evades clearance that is mediated by IgA1, 
the most abundant immunoglobulin on mucosal surfaces of the human URT26. The 
pneumococcal zinc metalloprotease ZmpA (also known as IgA1 protease), which cleaves the 
hinge region of human IgA1, eliminates the agglutinating activity of this immunoglobulin25. 
Thus, PCV likely is effective because it induces IgG, which is not sensitive to the protease, 
at levels high enough to reach the mucosal surface and block pneumococcal acquisition. In a 
model of experimental human colonization with S. pneumoniae, levels of CPS-specific 
memory B cells correlate with protection from acquisition27. Such memory B cells can 
quickly differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells following antigen exposure. 
Furthermore, the effectiveness of S. pneumoniae agglutination of airway secretions after 
PCV vaccination correlates with protection during experimental human colonization28. An 
additional effect of immunity demonstrated in the infant mouse model is a decrease in 
shedding by index pups24. Moreover, immunity in either the index or contact pups alone is 
sufficient to reduce rates of transmission, indicating that decreased shedding and protection 
from acquisition both contribute. These experiments were carried out with serotype-specific 
antibody. It is unclear whether immunity to other S. pneumoniae surface targets can block 
transmission. In this regard, immunization with Ply shows no effect on shedding and 
transmission, even though the toxin is required for spread between pups16. This result is not 
unexpected as Ply is not actively secreted, is not present on the cell surface and might be 
released only when pneumococci are lysed within the phagosome and therefore are not 
exposed to antibody29. When pneumococci are killed by lysozyme within the phagosome, 
the released Ply forms pores, which enable bacterial products to access the host cell cytosol 
and trigger the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines30–32. In this 
manner, S. pneumoniae responds to an influx of professional phagocytes when it finds itself 
in a host that is no longer hospitable. Triggering inflammation and mucus secretions drives 
its transit to a new, more hospitable host.
Colonization by S. pneumoniae
Nasopharyngeal carriage is the source of S. pneumoniae spread between hosts and the first 
step towards invasive disease. Several bacterial factors are required for S. pneumoniae to

 colonize and persist on the mucosal surface at a density and duration that is sufficient for 
transmission to occur (Fig. 3). For example, S. pneumoniae expresses two enzymes, 
peptidoglycan-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (PgdA) and attenuator of drug resistance 
(Adr), that modify its peptidoglycan and render it resistant to the lytic effects of lysozyme, 
which is abundant on the mucosal surface of the URT33. The main features that facilitate 
colonization are adherence to host cells and tissues, subversion of mucosal innate and 
adaptive immunity, and evasion of clearance by mucociliary flow.
Adherence to the nasopharynx
The first defence that S. pneumoniae encounters in the nasopharynx is mucus entrapment. 
The glycocalyx overlying the URT epithelium is composed of gel-like mucin glycoproteins 
and contains antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulins34. S. pneumoniae, like other 
residents of the URT, is found predominantly in and on this mucus layer35. Although the 
mucus layer keeps the bacteria away from the underlying cell surface, adherence to mucin 
glycans helps the bacteria to remain in the nasopharynx and provides a favourable niche and 
nutrients. On the other hand, CPSs, which are almost all negatively charged, repel the sialic 
acid-rich mucopolysaccha-rides in mucus36. By avoiding entrapment in the nasal mucus, S. 
pneumoniae might access and attach to the surface of epithelial cells. Much of our 
understanding of S. pneumoniae–host cell interactions comes primarily from models that use 
cultured human epithelial cells. S. pneumoniae uses several surface components for binding, 
but their relative importance in natural carriage has not been established. Examples of these 
adhesins are surface-located pneumococcal adherence and virulence protein A (PavA), PavB 
and enolase (Eno), all of which bind to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and 
plasminogen37–39. Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) moieties on cell wall teichoic acid bind to the 
platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR), and choline-binding protein A (CbpA; also 
known as PspC) binds the secretory component of the polymeric immunoglobulin 
receptor40,41. CbpA also binds the host proteins factor H and vitronectin. Other major 
classes of host cell receptors include carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion 
molecule 1 (CEACAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1)42. S. pneumoniae 
increases expression of many of its epithelial surface receptors and thereby increases its 
adherence in response to inflammatory stimuli43. The surface-exposed lipoproteins foldase 
protein PrsA (also known as PpmA)44 and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase SlrA45 also contribute 
to adherence to epithelial cells. CbpL facilitates migration of S. pneumoniae from the 
nasopharynx to the lungs and blood46. S. pneumoniae encodes at least ten extracellular 
glycosidases, some of which have been shown to enhance adherence by modifying host 
glycoconjugates to reveal glycan receptors47. In addition, two of these surface glycosidases, 
Neuraminidase A (NanA) and the β-galactosidase BgaA, have lectin domains and seem 
to function as adhesins independently of their enzymatic ac tivities48,49. N-acety 
lglucosamine-β-(1,3)-galactose inhibits pneumococcal adherence to epithelial cells, and S. 
pneumoniae is one of many pathogens that bind to N-acetylglucosamine-β-(1,4)-
galactose50,51. Thes e adhesive interactions with the epithelial surface may be needed for 
colonization but also comprise the initial step in the invasion process (see below).

 Interactions with the nasopharyngeal flora
The success of S. pneumoniae as a colonizer requires interactions with the nasopharyngeal 
microbiota, which likely are extensive and complex. These interactions can either be 
cooperative or competitive52. For example, detection of Gram-negative peptidoglycan 
through the sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) 
by neutrophils triggers killing of S. pneumoniae53. During experimental human colonization, 
increased diversity of the microbiota is associated with increased acquisition of S. 
pneumoniae following intranasal challenge54. S. pneumoniae colonization was also found to 
promote microbial heterogeneity in these studies. Similarly, during the first 2 years of life, S. 
pneumoniae colonization was associated with less stable microbiome profiles55. Co-
colonizing pneumococci compete with one another through a diverse array of 
bacteriocins (pneumocins) and related peptides with antimicrobial activity56–58. Lysis of 
susceptible strains not only allows for predation but also provides a source of DNA for the 
adaptation of the predator.
In general, inflammatory conditions in the URT favour the presence of S. pneumoniae. A 
common and important example is infection with URT viruses. Nasal inflammation in 
response to infection with respiratory viruses, such as IAV, modulates the expression of pro-
inflammatory chemokines, upregulates epithelial receptors used for S. pneumoniae 
adherence, compromises the integrity of the epithelium and provides a more nutrient-rich 
inflammatory milieu. Together, these effects of viral co-infection increase the susceptibility 
to acquisition and the density of colonizing S. pneumoniae59–61. Recent data from murine 
models and clinical studies have shown that the live attenuated influenza vaccine also 
increases the number of colonizing S. pneumoniae62–64. A higher pneumococcal density in 
the nasopharynx is likely to facilitate transmission and microaspiration to the lungs, thereby 
increasing the likelihood of progression to disease65.
Bacterial and host factors involved in clearance
Individual carriage episodes typically last for weeks to months. Through the use of a model 
for calculating the duration of carriage episodes from a longitudinal carriage study and 
combining these results with whole-genome sequence data, it was recently estimated that S. 
pneumoniae genomic variation accounts for 63% of the variation in carriage duration, 
whereas measured host traits (such as age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. 
Serotype was found to have a major influence on carriage duration66. This pan-genome-wide 
association study also identified prophage sequences as having the greatest negative impact 
on carriage duration, independent of serotype.
One important characteristic that enables S. pneumoniae to successfully thrive in this 
competitive niche is its ability to evade and sometimes hijack host responses during 
colonization. In mouse models, acquisition of the organism leads to a mild acute 
inflammatory response in the URT that is ineffective at completely clearing the organism67. 
By contrast, preexisting inflammation is the most closely associated susceptibility factor in 
the human challenge model68. Many of the factors contributing to the eventual clearance of 
S. pneumoniae have been delineated. Studies in mice suggest that clearance requires TLR2-
dependent responses that result in the recruitment of additional macrophages from the

 monocyte pool into the nasal lumen. Positive feedback and additional recruitment of 
macrophages are required for the gradual elimination of colonization69. The cellular immune 
responses to S. pneumoniae are greatly accelerated by cytosolic sensing of the pathogen, 
which requires the pore-forming function of Ply29,30. Accordingly, ply-deficient mutants, or 
mutants unable to form pores, show prolonged colonization and diminished production of 
key inflammatory mediators needed for clearance, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), CXC-
motif and CC-motif chemokines, and type 1 interferons29,30,32. These macrophage-
dependent responses are dysfunctional in both infant and aged mice, which might explain 
the higher incidence of infection among the very young and old70,71. The importance of 
cellular clearance mechanisms is likely to be a consequence of the inability of specific 
antibodies that are induced during carriage to clear the organism once it is established on the 
mucosal surface72,73.
Immunizing effect of colonization
Colonization increases anti-capsular (serotype-specific) and anti-protein (non-serotype-
specific) antibody levels74–77. Experimental data from murine models show that 
colonization is an immunizing event and protects against subsequent colonization and 
disease78,79. Experimental human carriage studies have confirmed that colonization 
increases nasal, lung and serum antibody levels74,80,81. Moreover, these studies corroborated 
observations in murine models, demonstrating the protective effect of colonization against 
reacquisition of the same strain up to 1 year following the first colonization episode75. 
Serotype-specific or strain-specific immunity seems to be required for this protection, as 
challenge of volunteers following a known natural carriage episode with a strain of a 
different serotype did not result in increased protection27. These infection studies also 
showed that colonization increases levels of S. pneumoniae-specific CD4+ T memory cells 
in the blood and lungs in humans80. In mice, anti-pneumococcal CD4+ T cells are sufficient, 
and the T helper 17 (TH17) cell response is necessary for efficient clearance82,83. The 
importance of TH17 immunity in natural colonization has yet to be confirmed, although a 
low ratio of TH17 to T regulatory (Treg) cells correlates with colonization in children and 
increases with age as colonization frequency decreases84.
Invasive pneumococcal disease
From an evolutionary perspective, stable nasopharyngeal colonization ought to be the 
principal modus operandi of S. pneumoniae, as this enables ready transmission to new hosts. 
As noted above, induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, upregulation of 
target receptors and damage to the respiratory epithelium caused by viral infection of the 
URT increases bacterial loads in the nasopharynx. This facilitates bacterial transmission but 
also increases the likelihood of penetration of host tissues and progression to localized or 
invasive disease. Progression to invasive disease is more likely in young children, elderly 
people and patients with specific lifestyle traits and comorbidities. There are also marked 
differences in the capacity of specific S. pneumoniae strains to cause invasive disease, which 
is unsurprising given the vast genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of this bacterium. S. 
pneumoniae factors and pathways that contribute to tissue adherence and invasion are 
outlined in Fig. 4.

 Niche adaptation
Translocation from the nasopharynx to deeper tissues exposes S. pneumoniae to distinct 
microenvironmental niches, requiring extensive adjustments to gene expression patterns. The 
importance of such adaptations for pathogenesis was initially suggested by genome-wide 
screens, for example, signature-tagged mutagenesis, which showed that in addition 
to known virulence genes, a large number of metabolic and transporter genes were required 
either for colonization or for local or invasive infections but not necessarily for growth of S. 
pneumoniae in vitro85–87. Subsequent studies using genomic microarray analysis identified 
substantial differences in expression patterns of these non-traditional virulence genes 
between pneumococci growing in distinct host niches (nasopharynx, lungs and blood) and 
compared with cells grown in vitro88,89.
Acquisition of metal ions, particularly transition metals such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) 
and zinc (Zn), is crucial for growth and survival of S. pneumoniae in multiple host niches, 
where availability of free ions may be restricted. These metals are essential cofactors for 
many metabolic and other enzymes, and in the case of Mn, they also mediate resistance to 
oxidative stress90. Unsurprisingly, genes encoding the metal-binding components of ATP-
binding cassette (ABC) transporters responsible for uptake of Fe (piuA, piaA and pitA), Mn 
(psaA) and Zn (adcA and adcAII) are preferentially expressed in the host environment, and 
the respective S. pneumoniae knockout mutants are heavily attenuated in vivo in models of 
both carriage and invasive disease91–93. Indeed, the absolute requirement for psaA in vivo 
makes it a valid target for novel antimicrobials94. Certain metals may also be deleterious in 
excess, and, hence, intracellular concentrations must be strictly regulated by coordination of 
uptake and efflux systems90. In addition, excess Zn released into the extracellular 
compartment by leukocytes poses a particular problem for invading pneumococci. Zn can 
compete with Mn for the metal binding site in manganese ABC transporter substrate-binding 
lipoprotein (PsaA)95, but unlike Mn, which is passed from PsaA to the PsaBC transporter for 
uptake, Zn binds irreversibly to PsaA and thereby blocks the transport pathway, starving the 
bacterium of Mn96. Thus, host Zn release contributes to nutritional immunity and may 
explain why dietary Zn deficiency increases rates of pneumococcal disease97,98. 
Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) also interacts with host lactoferrin, an Fe-
sequestering glycoprotein, and this protects the bacterium from killing by apolactoferrin (the 
Fe-free form of lactoferrin)99. Recent work has shown that the variable capacity of different 
S. pneumoniae strains to bind lactoferrin depends on PspA and differences in CPS100.
Optimal utilization of carbon sources available in distinct host niches is also critical for 
pathogenesis. S. pneumoniae is totally dependent on carbohydrates as a carbon source, and 
its genome encodes roughly 30 carbohydrate-specific phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) 
and ABC transporters capable of importing a wide range of sugars101. Many of these have 
previously been shown to contribute to growth and survival in vivo102. Although glucose is 
available in the blood, free sugars may be in low abundance at sites such as the mucosa of 
the upper and lower respiratory tracts. In these niches, pneumococci scavenge sugars by 
sequential cleavage of host cell surface N-linked glycoconjugates, which is mediated by 
surface-associated exoglycosidases such as NanA, BgaA and the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase 
StrH. The released sugars (sialic acid, galactose and N-acetylglucosamine) may then be

 taken up by the relevant ABC and PTS transporters and metabolized. At the same time, 
mannose residues are unmasked on the core gly-can structure, which may function as 
surface receptors for pneumococcal adherence103. S. pneumoniae also has a surface-
associated endoglycosidase, EndoD104, which releases the residual mannose3-N-
acetylglucosamine2 (Man3GlcNAc2) structure from host glycoconjugates. Terminal 
mannose can also be released from high man-nose N-glycans by an α-(1,2)-mannosidase, 
SpGH92, and taken up by the mannose PTS. Meanwhile, residual mannose5-N-
acetylglucosamine2 (Man5Gl cNAc2) is also released from these host structures by EndoD 
and taken up along with Man3GlcNAc2 by an ABC transporter, with further deconstruction 
occurring in the pneumococcal cytoplasm104. The various released sugars can have 
substantial intracellular effects by regulating carbohydrate metabolism through the catabolite 
repressor CcpA102. Sialic acid released by NanA has been shown to act as a signal, 
increasing bacterial loads in the nasopharynx of mice colonized with S. pneumoniae and 
facilitating invasion of nasal tissue and progression to pneumonia and meningitis105,106. 
Such signalling involves the two- component response regulator transcriptional 
regulatory protein CiaR and requires sialic acid uptake by the transporter SatABC, and this 
results in increased pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobial reactive oxygen species107. 
NanA can also trigger TGFβ signalling pathways, leading to endothelial cell invasion108.
The role of biofilms in the ability of S. pneumoniae to persist at various sites of infection is 
not well understood, and their contribution to invasive disease remains controversial. Most 
studies of pneumococcal biofilms have been carried out in vitro, and in vivo data are limited. 
Pneumococcal biofilm structures have been detected in biopsy samples from patients with 
otitis media109 and in the middle ear cleft of chinchillas co-infected with S. pneumoniae and 
Haemophilus influenzae110. In biopsy samples from volunteers colonized in experimental 
human studies, S. pneumoniae was found in microcolonies68, although it has not been 
determined whether these have characteristics of biofilms, such as an extracellular matrix. 
The production of an extracellular matrix has a major impact on the ability of S. pneumoniae 
that has been grown in a biofilm in vitro to subsequently translocate from the nasopharynx 
to the lungs in a murine infection model111. A recent report has also suggested that NanA-
mediated cleavage of sialic acid promotes biofilm formation in vivo and increases carbon 
availability during colonization112. Murine experiments suggested that the large surface-
exposed glycoprotein PsrP is particularly important for bacterial attachment to lung cells and 
biofilm formation by intraspecies interaction113. PsrP seems to be required for bacterial 
persistence in the lower airway but not for nasal colonization or survival in the bloodstream 
during sepsis114.
Quorum sensing (QS) and phase variation also have an important role in modulating 
pneumococcal niche adaptations. It has been known for many years that S. pneumoniae 
colonies can switch between transparent and opaque phenotypes in a process known as 
phase variation. These variants differ in levels of expression of key virulence proteins, such 
as PspA and CbpA, as well as CPS and cell wall teichoic acid. The transparent phenotype is 
favoured in the nasopharyngeal niche, and the opaque phenotype is favoured in the blood115. 
A more recent study has shown that the underlying mechanism involves a type I 
restriction-modification system, SpnIII, within a genetic locus containing inverted

 repeats that enable spontaneous rearrangement of alternative specificity domain genes. This 
generates six different SpnIII target specificities, each with distinct genome-wide DNA 
methylation patterns, gene expression profiles and virulence phenotypes116. Moreover, 
pneumococci were shown to readily switch between SpnIII alleles during progression of 
disease in a murine model116. Differentially expressed genes included the CPS biosynthesis 
locus cps, various sugar transporters, the Mn transporter psaBCA and luxS. The luxS gene is 
of particular interest, as it is involved in the synthesis of the ubiquitous QS molecule 
autoinducer 2 (AI-2), which is an important regulator of bio-film formation and virulence in 
pneumococci117. Recent studies show that AI-2 accumulating in the extracellular 
compartment is sensed by the fructose PTS transporter subunit IIC FruA, leading to 
upregulation of the galactose ABC transporter and the Leloir pathway105. Galactose is an 
important carbon source for S. pneumoniae in the respiratory tract, and AI-2-mediated QS 
seems to be essential for its uptake and metabolism. Upregulation of the Leloir pathway 
increases the availability of activated sugar precursors, leading to increased production of 
CPS and a hypervirulent phenotype105.
Penetration of tissues
Invasive pneumococcal disease requires breaching of epithelial and/or endothelial barriers 
and penetration of tissues, ultimately providing access to the bloodstream. In the case of 
meningitis, this involves breaching the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Invasion involves 
interaction between ChoP moieties and PAFR on the surface of cytokine-activated 
respiratory epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, followed by hijacking of the PAFR 
recycling pathway to gain entry40. An alternative route involves interaction between the 
pneumococcal surface protein CbpA and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) on 
human respiratory epithelial cells. Subversion of the PIGR recycling pathway enables 
internalization and transmigration of S. pneumoniae across polarized epithelial cell 
monolayers41. Interestingly, another region of CbpA has been shown to bind to the laminin 
receptor on brain microvascular endothelium, and this facilitates penetration of the BBB 
during development of pneumococcal meningitis118. CbpA, as well as laminin receptor and 
PAFR, are also necessary for invasion of cardiomyocytes and formation of cardiac 
microlesions, which can occur as a complication of invasive pneumococcal disease119. 
Recently, the ancillary pilus sub-unit RrgA, the tip adhesin of the pneumococcal pilus 1, has 
also been shown to interact with PIGR and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 
(PECAM1) on brain microvascular endothelium, and antibody blockade or deletion of these 
two receptors reduced brain invasion in a mouse meningitis model120. Currently, the relative 
importance of these uptake mechanisms and the extent of cooperation between them are 
uncertain. Furthermore, many S. pneumoniae strains are not piliated and thus cannot use 
RrgA-dependent pathways. It should also be emphasized that bacteraemia is not an essential 
prerequisite for meningitis, as localized infections such as sinusitis or mastoiditis can also 
lead to meningitis. When modelled in mice, meningitis may also develop as a consequence 
of the interaction of pneumococci colonizing the nasopharynx with gangliosides on the 
surface of olfactory neurons, triggering cell invasion and direct entry of pneumococci into 
the central nervous system by retrograde axonal transport121. Such non-haematogenous 
spread is stimulated by exogenous sialic acid106.

 Regardless of the mechanism or site of invasion, the pneumococcal capsule impedes 
adherence to and invasion of host cells because it may sterically hinder interactions between 
cell wall ChoP or surface proteins and their cognate host receptors122. However, 
pneumococci markedly reduce capsule thickness when in close contact with epithelial cells 
and during the invasion process123. This process of capsule shedding has recently been 
shown to depend on the major pneumococcal autolysin LytA and is triggered by exposure to 
cationic antimicrobial peptides that are released by the host cells124.
Several pneumococcal virulence factors that directly damage host tissues or induce host 
inflammatory responses also facilitate tissue invasion
One of the most notable examples is Ply, which, in addition to wide-ranging pro-
inflammatory effects, directly lyses or induces apoptosis of diverse cell types, including lung 
epithelium and endothelial cells at the BBB125. Ply also inhibits mucociliary clearance in 
human lungs, separates tight junctions between cells (which enables tissue penetration), and 
exposes new sites for pneumococcal attachment126. The pneumococcal pyruvate oxidase 
SpxB and α-glycerophosphate oxidase GlpO produce hydrogen peroxide, which also 
contributes to tissue damage in the lung and at the BBB127. Surface-exposed hydrolytic 
enzymes, including neuraminidases, hyaluronate lyase128 and metalloproteinases129, can 
also directly damage host tissues. Two glycolytic enzymes, Eno and glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase, are also surface-exposed and function as plasminogen-binding 
proteins along with CbpE (also known as Pce). They sequester and activate host 
plasminogen at the pneumococcal surface and facilitate adherence to and penetration of the 
extracellular matrix130,131. An overview of pneumococcal surface proteins and other factors 
contributing to adherence and invasion is provided in Table 1.
Evasion and subversion of host defences
S. pneumoniae expresses a plethora of factors that mediate immune evasion and subversion 
(Table 1). As an extracellular pathogen, S. pneumoniae must evade neutrophil-mediated 
killing to survive the acute inflammation that accompanies tissue invasion. Neutrophils can 
readily kill phagocytized pneumococci by releasing serine proteases from neutrophil 
granules132. One mechanism to evade neutrophil recruitment involves CbpE, which 
functions as a ChoP esterase. CbpE cleaves ChoP moieties on host-derived platelet-
activating factor (PAF), which is a potent activator of neutrophils133. Many of the virulence 
determinants of S. pneumoniae target components of the complement system to minimize 
opsonophagocytosis and clearance of invading pneumococci (reviewed in Ref. 134). The 
CPS is undoubtedly the most important defence against the host immune system. For 
example, although non-encapsulated pneumococci can colonize the URT and cause 
superficial eye infections, they rarely cause invasive infection. CPS covers deeper bacterial 
surface structures and thereby inhibits binding of immunoglobulins, complement 
components and C-reactive protein. It reduces opsonization with C3b and inactivated C3b 
(iC3b) and physically impairs interactions between C3b, iC3b and Fc regions of 
immunoglobulins with their receptors on phagocytic cells135. Capsular serotypes differ in 
the effectiveness with which they inhibit opsonophagocytosis and the level of inhibition 
correlates with their ability to cause invasive disease. Studies of capsule-switch mutants have 
shown an inverse relationship between the amount of C3b and iC3b deposition and binding

 to factor H, which inhibits the alternative complement pathway136. Increased levels of factor 
H in nasal lavages of asymptomatic individuals infected with a URT virus predispose the 
host to acquisition of S. pneumoniae137. Factor H mainly binds CbpA on the pneumococcal 
surface. CbpA can also bind directly to C3 and, in some strains, the classical complement 
pathway inhibitor C4b-b inding protein (C4BP) in an interaction that is inhibited by CbpA 
binding to vitronectin134,138,139. Thus, CPS and CbpA on the pneumococcal surface are both 
important for resistance to opsonophagocytosis.
PspA also interferes with complement deposition by binding factor B and blocking 
formation of or accelerating the dissociation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase140. 
Furthermore, Ply released from the bacterium activates the classical complement pathway 
through a domain with structural similarity to the Fc component of IgG, thereby depleting 
serum opsonic activity125,141. The combined functions of PspA and Ply are essential for S. 
pneumoniae to successfully cause septicaemia142. Other pneumococcal proteins that 
interfere with opsonophagocytosis include the exoglycosidases NanA, BgaA and StrH, 
presumably by deglycosylating human glycoproteins that are important for complement 
deposition143. Eno and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) bind and 
activate plasminogen, and this can also contribute to immune evasion through the 
degradation of complement pathway components134. S. pneumoniae grows in both short-
chain and long-chain forms. Short-chain forms have minimal surface area and are less likely 
to trigger complement activation and therefore are more likely to evade opsonophagocytic 
clearance during invasive disease144.
Conclusions and outlook
S. pneumoniae has proved to be a truly resilient foe. It has overcome selective pressure from 
multiple classes of antibiotics and now seems to be adapting to the immune pressure of 
widespread immunization. These developments demonstrate that we cannot be complacent, 
and further insights are needed to combat pneumococcal disease. This Review has 
highlighted the current state of our understanding of the three key stages in the pathogenesis 
of S. pneumoniae — transmission, colonization and invasion. In particular, our 
understanding has profited from progress in defining the molecular events involved in 
invasion and new models of transmission in infant mice and of carriage in humans. Further 
progress will likely come from a broader perspective that takes into account pneumococcal 
ecology. In this regard, there are now more than 8,000 publicly available whole-genome 
sequences of S. pneumoniae, which are providing a more comprehensive view of the species 
and the remarkable extent of its diversity. Additional insight will come from studies of the 
interactions of S. pneumoniae with other members of the microbiota and a better 
understanding of its niche in the human URT.

 Box 1
Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination
Streptococcus pneumoniae has a high genetic diversity, and certain lineages are 
particularly successful. an important source of strain-to-strain variation is the structure of 
the capsular polysaccharide (CPs), which is the major virulence determinant and 
immunodominant surface structure of S. pneumoniae. Currently, 98 immunologically and 
structurally distinct CPs types are recognized, but only a relatively small subset of these 
types is commonly found to cause carriage and disease. therefore, CPs-based vaccines 
target only a limited number of serotypes. when covalently conjugated to an 
immunogenic protein carrier, CPS is recognized as a T cell-dependent antigen, which 
stimulates a more effective humoral immune response (including immunoglobulin class 
switching, affinity maturation and memory) than polysaccharide-alone antigens, 
particularly in young children. since its introduction in 2000, the pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCv) has been highly effective in preventing invasive pneumococcal 
diseases. an unexpected benefit of the high levels of serotype-specific immunoglobulin G 
generated by PCv has been reduced rates of carriage in and transmission from immunized 
children, which also protects unimmunized populations (herd immunity)145. However, 
the protection elicited by PCv is incomplete, as current formulations contain only 10 to 
13 of the 97 known CPs types146. A further issue is the rising prevalence of non-vaccine 
serotypes in carriage and disease (serotype replacement) as a consequence of the immune 
pressure from widespread use of PCv147,148. Current efforts to improve prevention 
through vaccination are directed at increasing the number of serotypes covered by PCv or 
adding conserved pneumococcal proteins that induce serotype-independent immunity.

 Fig. 1. The life cycle of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease
Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract (URT). This 
carriage is the prerequisite for both transmission to other individuals and invasive disease in 
the carrier. Carriers can shed S. pneumoniae in nasal secretions and thereby transmit the 
bacterium. Dissemination beyond its niche along the nasal epithelium, either by aspiration, 
bacteraemia or local spread, can lead to invasive diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis 
and otitis media.

 Fig. 2. bacterial and host factors affecting pneumococcal shedding from carriers
Streptococcus pneumoniae is found predominantly in the mucus layer overlying the 
epithelial surface of the upper respiratory tract. Inflammation (indicated by the presence of 
neutrophils), which is induced by the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin or by co-infection 
with influenza virus or other respiratory viruses, stimulates secretions and increases 
shedding. By contrast, agglutinating antibodies such as anti-capsule immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) and IgA1 decrease shedding unless they are cleaved by the human IgA1-specific 
pneumococcal protease. Capsule type and amount also influence mucus association and 
numbers of shed bacteria.

 Fig. 3. Molecular mechanisms of pneumococcal colonization of host surfaces
Key functions that enable Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization are: establishing the first 
contact with the epithelium and epithelial receptors, interaction with the complement 
system, mucus degradation, metal binding, impairment of neutrophil activity and the pro-
inflammatory effects of the toxin pneumolysin (Ply). The pneumococcal enzymes 
Neuraminidase A (NanA), β-galactosidase (BgaA) and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (StrH) 
degrade mucus and thereby inhibit mucociliary clearance. Furthermore, the LytA 
(autolysin)-facilitated release of Ply damages the epithelium and reduces ciliary beating. 
Negatively charged capsular polysaccharide (CPS) inhibits bacterial mucus entrapment. CPS 
and several pneumococcal proteins, including pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), 
choline-binding protein A (CbpA), enolase (Eno) and pneumococcal histidine triad protein 
(Pht), directly and indirectly block complement deposition. PspA also binds to lactoferrin to 
acquire iron and blocks the antimicrobial effect of apolactoferrin. Endopeptidase (PepO), 
which is released from the pneumococcal surface, binds to C1q and thereby depletes 
complement components. Pneumococcal CbpE impairs neutrophil recruitment by degrading 
platelet-activating factor (PAF), a host-derived inflammatory phospholipid. CbpA interacts 
with factor H interactions to facilitate adherence and subsequent internalization of S. 
pneumoniae via cell glycosaminoglycans. CbpA also binds to polymeric immunoglobulin 
receptor (PIGR) to promote adherence. The zinc metalloprotease ZmpA (also known as 
immunoglobulin A1 protease) subverts mucosal humoral immunity by cleaving IgA1. 
Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) on teichoic acid mimics host PAF and allows binding to its

 Fig. 4. Stages in pneumococcal adherence and invasion
a | Several steps are required for invasion of the respiratory tract. Streptococcus pneumoniae 
evades entrapment in mucus and mucociliary clearance by negatively charged capsular 
polysaccharide (CPS) and proteolytic degradation of secretory immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) 
by the zinc metalloprotease ZmpA (also known as IgA1 protease). Neuraminidase A 
(NanA), β-galactosidase (BgaA) and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (StrH) deglycosylate 
mucus and unmask glycan targets for adhesins on the epithelium. Finally, pneumolysin (Ply) 
inhibits ciliary beating. Adherence to the apical surface of epithelial cells is mediated by 
diverse surface structures, including phosphorylcholine (ChoP), choline-binding protein A 
(CbpA), the ancillary pilus subunit RrgA at the tip of pili, adherence and virulence protein A 
(PavA) and large surface-exposed glycoprotein (PsrP). S. pneumoniae binds through ChoP 
to platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) and through CbpA to polymeric 
immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), and by subverting the respective host receptor recycling 
pathways, it induces its own endocytosis, which is followed by release of pneumococci at 
the basolateral surface. Alternatively, Ply and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) directly damage the 
epithelium, and hyaluronate lyase (Hyl) and plasmin, which is bound to the pneumococcal 
surface through enolase (Eno), glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or 
CbpE, degrade the extracellular matrix. This breaks down the epithelial barrier and provides 
a pathway for paracellular invasion. ChoP–PAFR and CbpA–PIGR interactions also enable

 pneumococci to traverse the endothelium and enter the bloodstream. Upregulation of PAFR 
by inflammatory cytokines amplifies ChoP–PAFR-mediated invasion. CPS and other 
virulence factors, including pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), CbpA and Ply, 
facilitate evasion of opsonophagocytosis. b | To penetrate the blood–brain barrier, S. 
pneumoniae uses ChoP–PAFR, CbpA–PIGR and CbpA–laminin receptor (LR) binding. 
Strains that express pili also use RrgA to bind to PIGR and platelet endothelial cell adhesion 
molecule 1 (PECAM1). Similar to invasion of the respiratory tract, Ply, H2O2 generated by 
α-glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) and activated plasmin bound to the pneumococcal 
surface proteins Eno, GAPDH and CbpE can compromise the blood–brain barrier.
