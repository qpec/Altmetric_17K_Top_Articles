nflammatory biomarkers are useful indicators of infection 
in care settings1 and have great value for monitoring 
chronic disease activity2 and overall health status in the 
wider population.3 Considerable research has shown that 
inflammatory biomarkers can predict mortality in adults with 
chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes4 and cardiovascular 
disease,5 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
have been shown to predict mortality and cardiovascular out-
comes in general population settings.6 In older adults, IL-6 
appears to have a stronger association than CRP with all-cause 
mortality.3 For cardiovascular outcomes, studies using Mende-
lian randomization have suggested causal effects for IL-6 but 
not for CRP.7,8
A recent metabolomics study examined 106 biomarkers and 
found α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), an acute-phase protein, to be 
the strongest predictor of 5-year mortality.9 The importance of this 
finding has not been established for mortality follow-up beyond 
5 years. It is also unknown how well AGP compares with other sen-
sitive, dynamic and commonly measured markers of systemic 
inflammation, such as IL-6 and CRP, as a predictor of mortality. To 
address this question, we compared associations of these 3 
inflammatory markers with short- and long-term risk of all-cause, 
cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in a large cohort 
study. We also examined absolute differences in remaining life 
expectancy at age 50 in men and women with high versus low 
inflammation based on each marker.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bio-
marker α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was 
found to have the strongest association 
with 5-year mortality in a recent study of 
106 biomarkers. We examined whether 
AGP is a better biomarker of mortality 
risk than the more widely used inflam-
matory biomarkers interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
and C-reactive protein (CRP).
METHODS: We analyzed data for 6545 
men and women aged 45–69 (mean 
55.7) years from the Whitehall II cohort 
study. We assayed AGP, IL-6 and CRP 
levels from fasting serum samples col-
lected in 1997–1999. Mortality follow-
up was until June 2015. Cox regression 
analysis was used to model associa-
tions of inflammatory biomarkers with 
all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer-
related mortality.
RESULTS: Over the mean follow-up of 
16.7 years, 736 deaths occurred, of which 
181 were from cardiovascular disease 
and 347 from cancer. In the model 
adjusted for all covariates (age, sex, 
socioeconomic status, body mass index, 
health behaviours and chronic disease), 
AGP did not predict mortality beyond the 
first 5 years of follow-up; over this period, 
IL-6 and CRP had stronger associations 
with mortality. When we considered all 
covariates and biomarkers simultane-
ously, AGP no longer predicted all-cause 
mortality over the entire follow-up 
period (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–1.08). 
Only IL-6 predicted all-cause mortality 
(adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12–1.33) and 
cancer-related mortality (adjusted HR 
1.13, 95% CI 1.00–1.29) over the entire 
follow-up period, whereas CRP predicted 
only cardiovascular mortality (adjusted 
HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.61).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest 
that AGP is not a better marker of short- 
or long-term mortality risk than the 
more commonly used biomarkers IL-6 
and CRP.

don-based offices.10 A total of 10 308 people (6895 men and 
3413 women) aged 35–55 years were recruited during 1985–
1988, with a response rate of 73%.9 Since the baseline medical 
examination, follow-up examinations have taken place about 
every 5 years.
The biomarkers were assayed from fasting serum samples 
collected in 1997–1999. For CRP measurement, a high-
sensitivity immuno 
nephelometric assay was used in a BN 
ProSpec nephelometer (Dade Behring); IL-6 levels were mea-
sured with a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (R&D Systems); and AGP levels were measured with 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as part of more com-
plete biomarker profiling.11
Mortality
Mortality data until June 2015 were drawn from the British 
national mortality register (National Health Service Central Reg-
ister). The tracing exercise was carried out using the National 
Health Service identification number of each participant. We 
used the 9th and 10th revisions of the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases to examine deaths due to cardiovascular (ICD-9 
codes 390–459 and ICD-10 codes I00-I99) and cancer-related 
(ICD-9 codes 140–208 and ICD-10 codes C00-C97) causes.
Covariates
Covariates used in the analyses were drawn from the 1997–1999 
assessment, concurrent with the measurement of inflammatory 
markers. 
Demographic covariates included age, sex and socioeco-
nomic status (defined by employment grade, a 3-level marker of 
socioeconomic status used in the Whitehall II study10). 
Health behaviour covariates included smoking status (cate-
gorized as current, former and never smoker), alcohol consump-
tion (assessed via questions on the number of alcoholic drinks 
consumed in the last week and converted to units of alcohol), 
physical activity level (defined as active for ≥ 2.5 h/wk of moder-
ate physical activity or ≥ 1 h/wk of vigorous physical activity, 
inactive for < 1 h/wk of moderate and vigorous activity, and 
intermediate for all other levels) and dietary behaviour 
(assessed using a question on frequency of fruit and vegetable 
consumption in a typical week). Body mass index (BMI) was 
used as a continuous variable. 
Chronic disease burden was assessed by prevalence of cardiovas-
cular disease (coronary artery disease or stroke), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cases of 
coronary artery disease included definite nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion and definite angina determined on the  
basis of questionnaires,

study electrocardiograms and cardiac enzyme levels; stroke was self-
reported. As far as possible, all identified cases of cardiovascular dis-
ease were corroborated via linkage to the UK Hospital Episode Statis-
tics database, which contains data on all inpatient and out 
patient 
treatment. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was self-reported 
on a UK Medical Research Council respiratory questionnaire.12 Can-
cer was assessed using the National Health Service cancer registry. 
Type 2 diabetes was determined on the basis of glucose level (fasting 
level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or 2-h postload level ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, or both), self-
report of doctor  
diagnosis or use of diabetes medication.13
Statistical analysis
We examined participants’ baseline characteristics as a function of 
vital status at the end of follow-up and summarized the associa-
tions using standardized differences. Inflammatory markers were 
log-transformed owing to skewed distributions and standardized 
to z scores to allow comparison of effect sizes. For the 590 partici-
pants (9.0%) who had missing values for 1 or more variables, we 
imputed missing data using multiple imputations to generate 10 
data sets, each analyzed separately, with the results combined 
using Rubin rules.14
For survival analyses, participants were followed until death or 
until the date of censoring for those who were alive (date of emigra-
tion or June 30, 2015), whichever occurred first. We used Cox pro-
portional hazards models with years of follow-up as the underlying 
time variable to examine hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for associations with mortality. Schoenfeld 
residuals suggested violation of the proportionality of hazards 
assumption, which justified our use of 3 follow-up periods for mor-
tality outcomes (< 5 yr, 5–10 yr, ≥ 10 yr). There were no sex differ-
ences in associations between inflammatory markers and mortality 
(p values for interaction ranged from 0.2 to 0.4), which led us to com-

bine men and women in analyses. In the first model, we adjusted for 
age and sex. In the second model, we also adjusted for socioeco-
nomic status, BMI, health behaviours and prevalent chronic disease. 
In the final model, we included all of the covariates as well as all 3 
inflammatory markers.
To take into account possible threshold effects, we repeated 
analyses with mortality using tertiles for each inflammatory marker 
(comparing highest v. lowest tertile). Using these same tertiles, we 
estimated remaining life expectancy at age 50 for men and women 
with high versus low inflammation by multiplying age-specific mor-
tality in England and Wales for 2011–2013 with the hazard ratios for 
the inflammatory marker–mortality asso 
ciation in the 2 groups 
compared with the total sample. These analyses were undertaken 
separately for men and women because of known sex differences in 
life expectancy.
We performed all analyses using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.). Sta-
tistical tests were 2-sided, with a p value of less than 0.05 consid-
ered to be statistically significant.
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee 
of the University College London Medical School. All participants 
provided written informed consent.
Results
A total of 6551 participants underwent clinical assessment in 
1997–1999, 6 of whom were not linked to mortality records and 
were excluded from all analyses. The mean age of participants at 
the 1997–1999 clinical assessment was 55.7 (range 45–69) years. A 
total of 736 deaths occurred over a mean follow-up of 16.7 years; 
14.5% occurred in the first 5 years, and 61.7% more than 10 years 
after assessment of biomarkers. Those who died were older than 
surviving participants (59.6 v. 55.2 years) but did not differ by sex 
(Table 1). They had an adverse socioeconomic and disease profile, 
including higher levels of all 3 inflammatory markers (Table 1). We 
found that AGP was correlated with IL-6 (r = 0.29, p < 0.001) and 
CRP (r = 0.33, p < 0.001); IL-6 and CRP were also correlated with 
each other (r = 0.46, p < 0.001).
In the first Cox regression model, adjusted for age and sex, all 3 
inflammatory biomarkers were associated with all-cause mortality 
(Table 2). All associations weakened over time and were stronger 
for deaths occurring in the first 5 years than for those occurring 10 
or more years after enrolment. In the second model, adjusted for 
all covariates, AGP did not predict mortality beyond the first 
5 years of follow-up. In the third model, which considered all 
covariates and biomarkers simultaneously, only IL-6 predicted 
short- and long-term mortality from all causes (adjusted HR over 
entire follow-up period 1.22, 95% CI 1.12–1.33). Table 3 shows the 
associations of all covariates with all-cause mortality before and 
after adjustment for all covariates and inflammatory markers.
A total of 181 deaths (24.6%) were attributed to cardiovascular 
disease, for which all 3 markers were significant predictors in the 
models adjusted for age and sex (model 1, Table 2). In analyses 
adjusted for all covariates and mutually adjusted for the 3 inflam-
matory markers, only CRP remained associated with cardiovascu-
lar death (adjusted HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.61). This pattern was 
also observed in analyses stratified by duration of follow-up.
A total of 347 deaths (47.1%) were due to cancer. All 3 biomark-
ers were associated with cancer-related mortality in models 
adjusted for age and sex over a 5-year follow-up period (model 1, 
Table 2). In the fully adjusted model including all 3 inflammatory 
markers, only IL-6 was associated with cancer-related mortality 
over the entire follow-up period (adjusted HR 1.13, 95% CI 
1.00–1.29).
When we compared mortality risk in the top versus the bottom 
tertile of each inflammatory marker, we did not observe associa-
tions between AGP or CRP and mortality in the models adjusted 
for all covariates (models 2 and 3, Table 4). On the other hand, IL-6 
was associated with all-cause mortality in all models, irrespective 
of the covariates included.

Figure 1 shows the remaining life expectancy at age 50 among 
participants with high versus low inflammation, defined using the 
highest and lowest tertiles for each biomarker. For AGP, there was a 
nonsignificant difference in life expectancy between those in the 
highest tertile and those in the lowest tertile (1.0 yr, 95% CI 0.0–2.0, 
for men and women; p = 0.054 and 0.06, respectively). The differ-
ences were significant between the highest and lowest tertiles of 
IL-6 (3.8 yr, 95% CI 2.9–4.7) and CRP (2.7 yr, 95% CI 1.6–3.7).
Interpretation
We examined the association of 3 inflammatory biomarkers with 
short- and long-term mortality in a large sample of middle-aged 
adults followed for 17 years. Analyses were motivated by a recent 
molecular profiling study that assessed the association of 106 
 
metabolites with mortality and found AGP to have the strongest 
association with all-cause mortality.9 Because AGP is an acute-
phase protein that is not widely measured,15 we compared its 
ability to predict mortality with the more commonly measured in-
flammatory biomarkers IL-6 and CRP. Our results showed that 
AGP was indeed associated with all-cause and cancer-related 
mortality in the short term; however, it was not associated with 
mortality beyond 5 years. Furthermore, when examining all 3 in-
flammatory markers in mutually adjusted models, AGP was not 
associated with mortality even in the short term. Thus, we found 
no evidence that AGP would be a better biomarker of mortality 
risk than the more commonly used inflammatory indicators IL-6 
and CRP.
In analyses adjusted for all covariates where each marker was ex-
amined separately, both CRP and IL-6 were associated with all-
cause and cancer-related mortality over the 17-year follow-up, with 
CRP also associated with cardiovascular mortality. However, when 
all inflammatory markers were considered together, only IL-6 was 
associated with all-cause and cancer-related mortality and CRP with 
cardiovascular mortality. 
Identification of inexpensive prognostic markers for ill health in 
vulnerable populations, older patients or patients with chronic 
conditions is important for the management of care. In addition, a 
better understanding of the role of inflammatory markers in gen-
eral population settings may help clarify their utility for guiding 
screening and prevention. Interactions between environmental, 
stochastic, genetic and epigenetic factors shape mortality risk. 
There is considerable interest in identifying biological markers of 
such risk, in particular those that can be measured noninvasively. 
Plasma biomarkers are ideal for this purpose, although observed 
associations do not necessarily reflect causality. In our study, CRP 
outweighed IL-6 as a predictor of cardiovascular mortality, al-
though evidence from Mendelian randomization studies suggests 
a causal role for IL-616 but not for CRP17 in cardiovascular disease. 
Reanalysis of our data using tertiles of inflammatory markers 
rather than standardized z scores suggested a robust association 
only between IL-6 and all-cause mortality.
Plasma concentrations of acute-phase proteins fluctuate in re-
sponse to inflammation. Interleukin-6 is a major proinflammatory 
cytokine, produced in a variety of tissues, and CRP and AGP are 
downstream products of the acute-phase response, derived via 
 
cytokine-dependent hepatic biosynthesis and secretion into the 
systemic circulation.18 Thus, IL-6 may be a more appropriate 
marker of long-term health status. There is considerable interest in 
the importance of inflammatory pathways for aging outcomes.19–21

It is possible that chronic low-grade inflammation plays a role in 
neurodegenerative diseases. This is supported by genome-wide 
association studies showing a number of genetic variants that in-
fluence inflammatory pathways associated with the development 
of Alzheimer disease.22, 23
In a study involving pregnant women with HIV infection, ele-
vated AGP levels were associated with an increased risk of mater-
nal death, postnatal transmission, and infant infection or death, 
possibly because of the impact of AGP on modulating immunity 
and binding or carrying drugs.1 There is little research on AGP and 
health status in general population samples, the exceptions being 
the study of metabolites and 5-year mortality, in which AGP was 
1 of 106 biomarkers (no other inflammatory markers were exam-
ined in that study),9 and studies of mortality risk among healthy 
older people and older patients in hospital.24,25 
Previous studies comparing AGP with other inflammatory 
markers for their associations with short- and long-term mortality 
are lacking. Our results showed a robust association of AGP with 
5-year risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer-related mortal-
ity in analyses adjusted for age and sex, with the magnitude of ef-
fect being similar to that in a previous study.9 However, by consid-
ering a longer follow-up period and other inflammatory markers 
simultaneously, we showed that IL-6 and CRP are more important 
predictors of mortality and that AGP does not provide additional 
information regarding mortality.
Strengths and limitations
A key strength of our study is the extended follow-up for mortality 
in a large cohort of men and women. We were also able to examine 
cancer-related and cardiovascular mortality.
Limitations of our study include the lack of ethnic diversity in the 
population. However, generalizability is unlikely to be compromised 
because the study was designed to include a wide socioeconomic 
spectrum, with more than a 10-fold salary difference across the so-

cioeconomic hierarchy. Associations between common risk factors 
and incidence of cardiovascular disease in our study are comparable 
to those in previous studies based on general population samples.26 
A further limitation is the use of only 3 serum markers of systemic in-
flammation. Although IL-6 and CRP are widely used in clinical prac-
tice and CRP is particularly inexpensive to measure, it remains un-
clear whether more relevant biomarkers of inflammation exist.
Conclusion
We found no evidence that AGP is a stronger prognostic marker of 
mortality than the widely used inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP. 
As in previous studies, elevated AGP was associated with 5-year 
mortality. However, even with this length of follow-up, it did not do 
better than IL-6 in predicting mortality. Our analyses of all-cause, 
cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality suggest that IL-6 may 
be a better prognostic marker for all of these outcomes, in both the 
short and the long term.
