ABSTRACT
Background/aim Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is
defined as a separation of the 2 muscle bellies of rectus
abdominis. To date there is scant knowledge on
prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of the
condition. The present study aimed to investigate the
prevalence of DRA during pregnancy and post partum,
presence of possible risk factors, and the occurrence of
lumbopelvic pain among women with and without DRA.
Methods This prospective cohort study followed 300
first-time pregnant women from pregnancy till
12 months post partum. Data were collected by
electronic questionnaire and clinical examinations. DRA
was defined as a palpated separation of ≥2
fingerbreadths either 4.5 cm above, at or 4.5 cm below
the umbilicus. Women with and without DRA were
compared with independent samples Student’s t-test and
χ2/Fisher exact test, and OR with significance level
>0.05.
Results Prevalence of DRA was 33.1%, 60.0%,
45.4%, and 32.6% at gestation week 21, 6 weeks,
6 months and 12 months post partum, respectively. No
difference in risk factors was found when comparing
women with and without DRA. OR showed a greater
likelihood for DRA among women reporting heavy lifting
≥20 times weekly (OR 2.18 95% CI 1.05 to 4.52).
There was no difference in reported lumbopelvic pain
(p=0.10) in women with and without DRA.
Conclusions Prevalence of mild DRA was high both
during pregnancy and after childbirth. Women with and
without DRA reported the same amount of lumbopelvic
pain 12 months post partum.
INTRODUCTION
Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is defined as a
separation of the two muscle bellies of rectus
abdominis.1 DRA is often described in relation to
pregnancy, but occurs both in postmenopausal
women2 and in men.3 4 Search on PubMed revealed
only few studies on DRA prevalence during preg-
nancy and in the postpartum period,2 5–9 and the
prevalence rates varied in the identified studies. T
o
date, there is also scant knowledge about risk
factors, but factors such as high age, multiparity, cae-
sarean section, weight gain, high birth weight, mul-
tiple pregnancy
, ethnicity, and childcare have been
proposed.2 8–11 There are few studies investigating
risk factors for having DRA in a timespan of
>6 months post partum and there is scant knowl-
edge on the consequences of DRA. It has been
claimed that DRA may change posture and give
more back strain due to reduced strength and
function, leading to low back pain.12 13 However,
some studies also contradict this hypothesis.5 14 In
addition, there is increasing focus on how women
can regain a ‘flat tummy’ after childbirth. The sparse
scientific knowledge in this area is in great contrast
to the information and opinions women are exposed
to in social media regarding abdominal exercise
related to DRA. Hence, there is a need for studies
on prevalence, risk factors, possible consequences,
and the effects of abdominal training in prevention
and treatment of the condition.15
The aims of the present study were: (1) to investi-
gate the prevalence of DRA among nulliparous preg-
nant women during pregnancy and the first year
post partum; (2) to investigate the presence of pos-
sible risk factors among women with and without
DRA 12 months post partum and (3) to investigate
report of lumbopelvic pain among women with and
without DRA 12 months post partum.
METHODS
The study was part of a cohort study at Akershus
University Hospital (Ahus), Norway. All first-time
mothers with planned birthplace at the hospital in
the period from January 2010 to April 2011 were
invited to participate in the study.16 17 Data were
collected by electronic questionnaire at gestation
week 21 in addition to 6 weeks, 6 months and
12 months post partum. At these four assessment
points, clinical examinations were carried out by
two physiotherapists. Data on delivery mode and
the baby’s birth weight were collected from the
women’s electronic medical journal at the hospital.
The cohort study was approved by the Regional
Medical Ethics Committee (2009/170), and the
Data Protection Officer at Ahus (2799026). All
women
gave
written
informed
consent
before
entering the study and procedures were in accord-
ance with the Helsinki Declaration (2008). The
study followed the STROBE reporting guidelines.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion took place in conjunction with the
routine ultrasound examination at gestation week
18–22.
Inclusion
criteria
were
women
aged
≥18 years, and the ability to understand and speak
a Scandinavian language. Exclusion criteria at base-
line were serious illnesses, multiple pregnancies,
and
history
of
a
previous
pregnancy
lasting
>16 weeks. During the study period women with
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or premature birth
before
gestation

 randomised controlled trial (RCT) on pelvic floor muscles train-
ing starting 6 weeks post partum were excluded.18 Additionally,
data from women with a new pregnancy of >6 weeks gestation
were excluded from the analysis (figure 1).
Power calculation
The study was a planned part of a project addressing several
questions related to the pelvic floor during pregnancy and after
childbirth. Whereas the power calculation for the cohort study
was based on expected changes in the levator hiatus area,
assessed by ultrasound,19 there was no a priori power calcula-
tion for the present study on DRA.
Measurement of DRA and cut-off value
All clinical examinations were performed by two physiothera-
pists blinded to data collected through the questionnaire. Owing
to practical reasons the physiotherapist did not necessarily
follow the same women throughout the study period. DRA was
measured by palpation 4.5 cm above, at and 4.5 cm below the
umbilicus.6 The women were tested in a standardised supine
crock-lying position with arms crossed over the chest. They
were instructed to perform an abdominal crunch till the shoul-
der blades were off the bench. Palpation of DRA in postpartum
women has shown to have good intrarater reliability (Kw>0.70)
and moderate inter-rater reliability (Kw=0.53).20
The women were classified into four categories depending on
the largest measured inter-recti distance among the three loca-
tions: (1) non-DRA was set as a separation <2 fingerbreadths,
(2) mild diastasis as a separation of 2–3 fingerbreadths, (3) mod-
erate diastasis as 3–4 fingerbreadths and (4) severe diastasis as a
separation of 4 or more fingerbreadths. Observed protrusion
along the linea alba was categorised as DRA even if the palpated
distance was <2 fingerbreadths. The categorising was based on
the study by Candido et al.8 Prevalence of DRA was analysed as
yes/no and mild, moderate and severe grade of DRA were
merged in the main analysis.
Risk factors
Selection of risk factors was based on existent literature and
clinical reasoning. The chosen variables were: age, height, mean
weight before this pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy,
delivery mode, baby’s birth weight, benign joint hypermobility
syndrome, heavy lifting, and level of abdominal and pelvic floor
muscle exercise training and general exercise training 12 months
post partum.
Hypermobility was assessed with Beighton score, including
nine subtests: trunk flexion with palms flat on the floor, hyper-
extension of left/right elbow past 10°, hyperextension of left/
right knee past 10°, passive movement of left/right thumb up to
the forearm, and passive extension of fifth left/right metacarpo-
phalangeal joint past 90°.21 Each subtest is graded zero or one.
Maximum test score is 9 points and cut-off for hypermobility
was set to 5/9.22–26 Beighton test has shown good intrarater
(Spearman r 0.86) and inter-rater (Spearman r 0.87) reliability
examined in women 15–45 years of age.22
Lumbopelvic pain
Pain related to the low back and pelvic girdle was recorded by
using an electronic questionnaire. T
wo yes/no questions were
used: ‘Are you bothered with pain in the low back?’ and ‘Are
you bothered with pain in the pelvis?’ If answering ‘yes’ on
pelvic girdle pain, participants were further asked to localise the
pain with the following alternatives: (1) right posterior pelvic
pain, (2) left posterior pelvic pain, (3) bilateral posterior pelvic
pain and/or (4) anterior pelvic pain. Pelvic girdle syndrome was
defined as having anterior and bilateral posterior pain.27 In the
main analysis, low back pain and/or pelvic girdle pain were
conflated into lumbopelvic pain. Additionally, subanalysis of
either pelvic girdle pain or low back pain was performed
independently.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (V
.21, Inc,
Chicago, Illinois, USA). Background variables were reported as
means with SDs or frequencies, and percentages. W
omen with
and without DRA were compared in relation to risk factors with
independent sample Student’s t-test for numeric data and χ2/
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Logistic regression
was used to calculate ORs for the different risk factors reported
as OR with 95% CI. Spearman’s correlation between variables
was used to investigate the basis for adjustments for possible
confounding factors. Differences in report of lumbopelvic pain
were compared with Fisher’s exact test. Missing data were
excluded. The significance level was set to >0.05.
RESULTS
In total, 2621 women were scheduled for delivery at Ahus
during the inclusion period. The cohort consisted of 300 prim-
iparous women of European ethnicity (96%), and between 19
and 40 years of age (table 1). The prevalence of DRA was
33.1% at gestation week 21, 60.0% 6 weeks post partum,
45.5% 6 months post partum, and 32.6% 12 months post

 partum (table 2). The location with the highest prevalence of
DRA was at the umbilicus for all the time points.
Table 3 showed no significant difference in evaluated risk
factors
when
comparing
women
with
and
without
DRA
12 months post partum. There were three borderline values:
height, heavy lifting and participation in strength exercise train-
ing. The OR for DRA was twice as high among women report-
ing heavy lifting 20 times a week or more than that for women
reporting less weight lifting (table 4). No other significant risk
factors were found.
Table 5 showed no difference in lumbopelvic pain among
women with and without DRA 12 months post partum. Four
women had pelvic girdle syndrome, and one woman had pain
in the front and back on one side.
DISCUSSION
At gestation week 21, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post
partum, the prevalence of DRA was 33.1%, 60.0%, 45.4% and
32.6%, respectively. There was a greater likelihood for DRA
among women reporting to be exposed to heavy lifting 20
times a week or more calculated with OR, but no other risk
factors were found to be statistically significant. W
omen with
DRA were not more likely to report lumbopelvic pain compared
with women without DRA.
Prevalence of DRA
There is no universal agreement about the definition of
DRA,15 28 and variance in prevalence rates between studies can
be explained by use of different cut-off values and locations
along the linea alba,11 29 degree of abdominal muscle activation
during the measurement,30
31 use of different measurement
tools,20 parity,2 9–11 29 and populations studied. The chosen
cut-off value for DRA in the present study is in accordance with
several studies investigating similar populations,6–8 10 and the
chosen measurement location is used frequently.6 14 32 33
W
e have only identified two studies investigating the preva-
lence of DRA during pregnancy.5 6 Our result of 33.1% is in
accordance with Boissonnault and Blaschak’s6 results of a preva-
lence of 27% in the second trimester. They assessed DRA with

 palpation at the same three locations along linea alba, and with
similar cut-off values as the present study. Mota et al5 measured
DRA with ultrasound during gestational week 35, and reported
a prevalence of 100%. The difference in measurement method,
assessment-time, and the use of 1.6 cm as cut-off value makes
direct comparison between studies difficult. To the best of our
knowledge, Mota et al5 is the only study reporting prevalence
of DRA 6 weeks and 6 months post partum. Their results of
52.4% and 39% are lower than our result of 60% and 45.4% at
the same time points. Boissonnault and Blaschak’s,6 who mea-
sured DRA 5 weeks to 3 months post partum, reported a preva-
lence of 36%.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the only
one assessing DRA 1 year post partum. T
uran et al9 examined
DRA with palpation minimum 6 months post partum and
reported a prevalence of 19.7% when applying a cut-off of 2
fingerbreadths or more 3–4 cm above the umbilicus. Using the
same location, the present study found a prevalence of 10.2%
measured 1 year post partum (data not shown), and among all
three measurement locations our result was 32.6%.
Possible risk factors for DRA 12 months post partum
Our data shows no clear risk factors for DRA 12 months post
partum. The wide CI for the OR on heavy lifting indicates that
this result should be interpreted with caution. In support, the
same variable was only on the borderline using Fisher’s exact
test and due to the multiple variables investigated in this study,
the risk of a type I error is increased.34 Data on heavy lifting
was collected through the questionnaire, and was neither
defined nor measured directly. Some authors have discussed
how frequent lifting and carrying children may cause increased
strain on the abdominal wall and DRA, without providing any
direct data for this hypothesis.8 Hence, this proposed risk factor
needs further investigation. There was no correlation between
possible confounding factors and DRA or investigated risk
factors; therefore, it was considered to be of no basis for calcu-
lating adjusted OR.
When comparing women with and without DRA in the
present study, no difference was found in the number of women
fulfilling the recommendations for general exercise, strength
training or specific pelvic floor muscle training 1 year post
partum. With a prevalence of DRA of above 30% at 12 months
post partum, preventive and treatment strategies are likely to
develop. As we did not perform a RCTwe cannot, based on our
data, advice women on how to prevent or treat the condition.
A recent systematic review concluded that, as for now, there are
no high-quality RCTs on the effect of abdominal training pro-
grammes to guide clinical practice in this area.15 Further high-
quality
studies
regarding
this
prevalent
condition
within
women’s health and exercise training are therefore warranted.
In accordance with Mota et al,5 our study showed no associ-
ation between report of regular exercise and DRA. Discordantly,
Candido et al8 found that women with mild or no DRA were
more often engaged in regular vigorous exercise three times a
week or more, and in regular walking exercise during pregnancy
as compared with women with moderate or severe DRA. In our
sample, there were only two women with moderate DRA and
none with severe DRA 12 months post partum. The fact that
the majority of women had a mild DRA could be a reason for
not seeing any differences between the groups regarding all the
risk factors. The use of different categories of exercise may also
explain the disparate results. W
e used the American College of
Sports Medicine’s guidelines for exercise when setting cut-off
value for frequency of exercise.35 Other factors that may be pro-
tective against more severe diastasis in our population is the
inclusion of only primiparous women carrying a single fetus. Lo
et al10 found that twin pregnancy was a risk factor for DRA;
however, this was not supported by the study of Candido et al.8
Lumbopelvic pain 12 months post partum
Several authors have postulated a relationship between DRA and
low back pain,9 12 13 36–38 but the evidence for such an associ-
ation is scant.14 Our result showed no difference between
women with and without DRA, and prevalence of low back
and/or pelvic girdle pain. This is in accordance with Mota et al5
and Parker et al.14 However, the latter study found an

 association between DRA and abdominal and pelvic region pain,
and argued that the observation of no associations between
DRA and low back pain might be due to inclusion of women
with non-severe DRA. The maximal separation in their study
was 5.02 cm, which is comparable to our result where only one
woman had a separation greater than 4 fingerbreadths. Another
explanation for the result of no association may be the small
sample size in our study.
Strengths and limitations
The longitudinal design and blinding of assessors to symptoms
and risk factors can be considered strengths of the study. In add-
ition, we had a large sample size compared with other published
studies in the postpartum period,5 6 and also investigated a
sample of homogeneous primiparous women. Furthermore, two
trained physiotherapists who were aware of the pitfalls of the
palpation method conducted the study.
Palpation has been found to have moderate inter-rater reliabil-
ity, and may be considered a limitation of the study.20 Today,
ultrasound is recommended as a more responsive and reliable
method to assess inter-recti distance.20
39 However, Van de
W
ater and Benjamin40 argued that palpation may be a sufficient
method for detecting presence of DRA. This was the main
purpose of our study in addition to comparing risk factors and
lumbopelvic
pain
in
women
with
and
without
diastasis.
Palpation is the most commonly used method in clinical prac-
tice,41 and the results may therefore be considered clinically
understandable and relevant for most practitioners. However,
we support the recommendations for use of ultrasound for
more details of DRA in future studies.20
Another limitation of the present study is the lack of data on
the normal width of linea alba before pregnancy. However,
earlier studies have shown no prevalence of DRA among nul-
liparous women using similar cut-off values.6 9 Furthermore,
the use of questionnaire to diagnose low back and pelvic girdle
pain may be a limitation as the diagnosis pelvic girdle pain is
recommended to be confirmed through specific clinical tests.42
The use of questionnaire for exercise data is also a potential
source of bias as the questions related to exercise may be prone
to recall bias43 and overestimation.44 However, the recall bias in
the present study was highest for prepregnancy data, and it is
considered that use of questionnaires can help separate between
participants fulfilling recommendations for exercise and not.43
The questions used regarding exercise are similar to those devel-
oped for the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study.45 In
general, there has to be caution in determining risk factors from
questionnaire data; however, questionnaires are a commonly
used, easy and cost-effective way of collecting information.43
Regarding the weight-related data, one weakness is that there
was no direct measure of the strain on the abdominal wall.
Furthermore, abdominal circumference and symphysis fundus
measurements could have been relevant.
Generalisability of the present study is limited because of the
homogeneity of the participants included. There were no a
priori power calculation for the investigated variables, but the
study is one of the few longitudinal studies in the peripartum
period and future power calculations can be based on results
from the present study. Given the high prevalence of DRA post
partum, and the concern and focus on the abdominal muscle
after childbirth, there is a need for more scientifically based
knowledge on consequences, prevention, and treatment of the
condition. Our study did not confirm that mild diastasis caused
lumbopelvic pain. However, to date, there is little knowledge on
women with larger separation. Further investigation using a
validated questionnaire on low back and pelvic pain in conjunc-
tion with more objective testing is required to conclusively
prove this association.
CONCLUSION
Prevalence of mild DRA was high both during pregnancy and
after childbirth. No obvious risk factors were found, and there
was no difference in report of lumbopelvic pain between the
group with and without DRA 12 months post partum. There is
a need for more research on the influence of DRA on abdominal
strength and lumbopelvic pain, and the effect of preventative
and treatment programmes.
What are the findings?
▸ Prevalence of diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) among
first-time pregnant Scandinavian women were 33.1%,
60.0%, 45.4% and 32.6% at gestation week 21, 6 weeks,
6 months and 12 months post partum, respectively.
▸ Age, height, mean weight before this pregnancy, weight
gain during pregnancy, caesarean section, baby’s birth
weight, benign joint hypermobility syndrome, and level of
abdominal and pelvic floor muscle exercise training and
general exercise training 12 months post partum were not
found to be risk factors for DRA.
▸ Women with DRA were not more likely to report lumbopelvic
pain compared with women without DRA 12 months after
childbirth.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Given the high prevalence of mild diastasis recti abdominis,
coaches and healthcare providers should assess whether the
condition is present in post partum women.
▸ This study indicates that mild diastasis is not associated with
lumbopelvic pain, which is important information to give to
women with this condition.
