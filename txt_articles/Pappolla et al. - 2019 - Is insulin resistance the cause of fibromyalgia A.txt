Abstract
Fibromyalgia (FM) is one of the most frequent generalized pain disorders with poorly under-
stood neurobiological mechanisms. This condition accounts for an enormous proportion of
healthcare costs. Despite extensive research, the etiology of FM is unknown and thus, there
is no disease modifying therapy available for this condition. We show that most (if not all)
patients with FM belong to a distinct population that can be segregated from a control group
by their glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance
(IR). This was demonstrated by analyzing the data after introducing an age stratification cor-
rection into a linear regression model. This strategy showed highly significant differences
between FM patients and control subjects (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, for two separate con-
trol populations, respectively). A subgroup of patients meeting criteria for pre-diabetes or
diabetes (patients with HbA1c values of 5.7% or greater) who had undergone treatment with
metformin showed dramatic improvements of their widespread myofascial pain, as shown
by their scores using a pre and post-treatment numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) for evalu-
ation. Although preliminary, these findings suggest a pathogenetic relationship between FM
and IR, which may lead to a radical paradigm shift in the management of this disorder.
Introduction
Fibromyalgia (FM) is one of the most frequent generalized pain disorders with poorly under-
stood neurobiological mechanisms. In the general population, the estimated global prevalence
of FM is 2.7% with a 3 to 1 female to male ratio [1]. However, studies suggest an even higher
prevalence in primary care settings [2].
Patients afflicted with FM have chronic widespread pain and protean somatic symptoms
including fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, gastrointestinal complaints and problems of cognition
and mood [3].

 The global economic impact of FM is enormous. In the United States alone, the healthcare
cost is around $100 billion/year; comparable to reports in European countries [4]. Due to
lower pain thresholds, patients with FM also have a higher incidence of symptomatic musculo-
skeletal and spinal disorders, which in themselves contribute to the financial burden of manag-
ing this disorder.
FM is considered a central sensitivity pain disorder characterized by abnormal processing
of nociceptive stimuli [5]. In addition, peripheral mechanisms (see Discussion below regarding
small fiber neuropathy) are also believed to contribute to widespread pain.
Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain the extensive array of symptoms including
inherited abnormalities [6], dysfunction of neurotransmitter pathways such as substance P [6],
immune dysregulation [7–9] and several others [9]. Unfortunately, none of these propositions
has led to practical advances beyond symptomatic treatment. In fact, recent reviews of FM
published in 2016 [10] and 2017 [3], have concluded that there have been no substantive
advances in our understanding of this disease.
Prior observations indicate that IR causes dysfunctions in the brain microvasculature lead-
ing to focal cerebral hypoperfusion [11]. Since similar brain perfusion abnormalities are pres-
ent in patients with FM [12], we hypothesized that IR may be the missing link in this disorder.
In order to search for initial evidence in support of this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospec-
tive chart review of patients with FM focusing on potential laboratory abnormalities. In con-
trast with prior studies, when we applied an age correction to the data available for analysis,
specifically to the HbA1c values, unexpected findings came to light. Here, we report that a
series of patients with FM belong to a distinct population that can be segregated from a control
group by their HbA1c values, a biomarker for impaired glucose metabolism, characterized by
insulin resistance [13, 14].
In order to supplement this finding, we also reviewed the evolution of the pain scores of
patients with FM who had had their IR treated pharmacologically. This subgroup of patients
reported dramatic improvements of their myofascial pain after treatment with metformin.
This evidence, although preliminary, suggests a pathogenetic relationship between FM and
IR, which may lead to a paradigm shift in the management of this disorder.
Materials and methods
Sample description
We identified 23 patients from a retrospective chart review who were referrals to a subspecialty
pain medicine clinic for the treatment of widespread myofascial pain. All patients had met the
1990 [15] as well as the 2010/2011 [16] American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM
diagnosis (i.e., tender points were retained in the evaluation). Patients with comorbid disor-
ders, including history of cerebrovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, untreated endocrine
abnormalities, autoimmune conditions, neuromuscular diseases, active malignancy, immuno-
deficiency or drug or alcohol abuse were excluded from the sample. Patients taking medica-
tions associated with IR such as glucocorticoids, thiazide diuretics, atypical anti-psychotics,
beta-blockers, niacin, statins and others were also excluded.
Since there is a known association between small fiber neuropathy and FM [17, 18], many
of these patients had undergone laboratory investigations in commercial CLIA (United States
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act) accredited laboratories. This comprised diagnostic
panels for peripheral neuropathy, which included HbA1c values.
The HbA1c values from 23 patients with FM (8 Hispanic; 11 White; 4 African-American;
21 females, 2 males) were compared with the HbA1c means of two independent control popu-
lations. One was a non-diabetic population with normal glucose tolerance (obtained from the

 Framingham Offspring Study; FOS NGT) for the ages stated in the graph (Fig 1). The second
population used for confirmation was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey dataset (NHANES non-diabetic) available from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). The data from both control groups can be found published in
Pani et al [19].
Because peripheral neuropathies (including small fiber neuropathy) that are associated with
IR may start at very early stages of pre-diabetes, there is a growing trend among experts to
begin early pharmacological interventions to correct this abnormality, particularly when IR is
associated with neuropathy or other risk factors [20]. Following this premise, patients either
meeting criteria for pre-diabetes (HgA1c values of 5.7 or higher) or previously undiagnosed
diabetes mellitus type 2, are routinely offered treatment in our clinics and were initiated on
metformin 500 mg twice a day. In our sample of patients, metformin was added to “standard
treatment” for widespread myofascial pain. Standard treatment (ST) consisted of either

 norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (amitriptyline, duloxetine or milnacipran) and/or mem-
brane stabilizing agents (gabapentin or pregabalin), depending on tolerability or patients’ pref-
erence of either class of drug. In our clinics, pain scores are routinely recorded by the Numeric
Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), at each clinical encounter. The NPRS is a unidimensional measure
of pain intensity in adults which consists of an 11-point scale for self-reporting of pain. It is
one of the most commonly employed instruments in clinical and research settings with exten-
sive evidence supporting its validity [21]. Pain scores were available from the initial evaluation,
after ST and after metformin administration.
Statistical analyses
In order to characterize the variation contributed from the patients, sets of simulated HbA1c
data were generated to emulate the populations which were the source of the HbA1c values
in the controls. Separately for FOS NGT and NHANES nondiabetic, over the bounded age
range from 40 to 69, the tabled values of N, mean, and standard error of each age group were
used to estimate the corresponding standard deviation (estimating standard deviation for each
age group as the product of the standard error and square root of N). A corresponding simu-
lated source population for the data was generated for each centered age as a set of random
normally distributed values with the tabled Ns and means and the calculated standard devia-
tion (Table 1). Means and standard errors for the resulting simulated data over each age range
were verified in good agreement with the values, with estimates of means within 0.1% and
standard errors within 4%. This simulated FOS NGT and NHANES non-diabetic HbA1c data,
paired with the HbA1c measures from patients with FM, was then modeled by linear regres-
sion with relation to age and group (FOS HGT simulated patients (N = 1350), NHANES non-
diabetic simulated patients (n = 1592) versus FM patients (n = 23). Differences among the
groups were estimated by Tukey-adjusted contrasts (Table 2). Differences among pain scores
(initial, ST-NPRS, MET-NPRS) were pairwise estimated using the sign test, followed by Hom-
mel adjustment of p-values to compensate for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were
performed using R statistical software (R Core Team, 2018, version 3.5.1). All statistical tests
assumed a 95% level of confidence, with alpha = 0.05.

Results
1. Association between FM and HbA1c levels
From all analytes reviewed, only the HbA1c levels segregated patients with FM from control
subjects (Fig 1). Despite many patients with FM showing HbA1c values within the normal
range (equal or less than 5.6%), when we stratified the data in an age continuum and analyzed
it as described, a clear-cut difference between the groups (patients with FM versus controls)
came to light. The regression relating HbA1c to group (FOS NGT, NHANES nondiabetic,
fibromyalgia HbA1c), summarized in Fig 1 and Table 1, showed that patients with FM average
0.59 units of HbA1c higher than FOS NGT, p < 0.0001, and that patients with FM average
0.39 units higher than NHANES nondiabetic, p = 0.0002.
NPRS for patients who were treated with metformin are reported in graphic form in Fig 2.
Pain scores differed significantly per the sign test among all groups (initial, ST-NPRS,
MET-NPRS), with p <0.0001 in each pairwise comparison, as illustrated in Fig 2 and summa-
rized in Table 2.
HbA1c values in 23 patients with FM (8 Hispanic; 11 White; 4 African-American; gender:
21 females, 2 males) were compared with the means of two control populations as described in
the text. 1-A non-diabetic population with normal glucose tolerance (obtained from the Fra-
mingham Offspring Study) and 2-A nondiabetic population from the NHANES data set.
Regression lines are shown with shaded 95% confidence regions. FOS NGT and NHANES
nondiabetic HbA1c values include scatterplots of published mean values for each age region,
while HbA1c results from patients with FM include a scatterplot of measures from individual
patients (several overlap in values). The regression estimates that HbA1c values in patients
with FM average 0.59 +/- 0.1 (mean +/-SE) units higher than FOS NGT (p<0.001), and 0.39
units higher than the NHANES nondiabetic values, p = 0.0002. Because of overlapping values,

 not all individual patients can be plotted in the graph. For this reason, individual data values
for each patient are provided in Table 3.
2. Pain scores reduction after treatment of IR
The subgroup of patients who had undergone pharmacological treatment of IR with metfor-
min, in combination with the ST, experienced a dramatic decrease in the pain scores (Fig 2).
Response to metformin plus ST was followed by complete resolution of the pain (report of 0 of
10 in the NPRS) in 8 of 16 patients who had been treated with metformin (50%), a degree of
improvement never observed before in such a large proportion of FM patients subjected to
any available treatment. In contrast, patients treated with ST alone improved, but complete
resolution of pain was generally not observed (Fig 2). Interestingly, some patients responded
only to metformin and not to ST with NSRIs or membrane stabilizing agents. Importantly,
there was a long-term retention of the analgesic effect of metformin as noted in Table 3.
I-NPRS: Initial pain scores at presentation. 2-ST-NPRS: Numerical pain scores after stan-
dard treatment (pregabalin, gabapentin and/or NSRIs). M-NPRS: Numerical pain scores after
addition of metformin. Pain scores are the average of the worse pain experienced in the 7 days
prior to the encounter. All pairwise differences among the groups were significant, p<0.0001,
per the sign test and following adjustment for multiple comparisons, as shown in Table 2.

 Discussion
The results showed a highly significant association between FM and HbA1c levels. Stratifica-
tion of the values in an age continuum, showed a clear-cut difference between the patients
and the control groups. As can be visually appreciated in the graph in Fig 1, almost all
patients in the FM group fell at or above the mean of the FOS control values, with highly sig-
nificant differences between the FM patients and both control groups (p < 0.0001 and
p = 0.0002 for the FOS and NHANES control populations, respectively). In addition, patients
with FM in whom IR had been pharmacologically treated showed dramatic and statistically
significant reductions in pain scores (p < 0.0001 for all groups) as shown in Fig 2 and Tables
2 and 3.
HbA1c does not directly measure IR; however, it is widely recognized as a surrogate marker
for this abnormality [14]. Non-diabetic individuals with mildly elevated HbA1c values (5.7%-
6.4%), belong to a stage often called “pre-diabetes”, which carries a higher risk for the develop-
ment of peripheral neuropathies (15), cardiovascular events [13], neurological disease [22–24]
and all-cause mortality [13].
In view of the substantive research efforts involved in FM, including those from the phar-
maceutical industry, we were puzzled that prior investigations had overlooked these simple
findings. The main reason for this oversight is that many patients with FM show HbA1c values
currently considered to be within the normal range; however, this is the first study to analyze
the data in an age-stratified manner. This is important, considering the effect of aging on
HbA1c levels [19]. Therefore, a value of 5.5%, for example (considered “normal” by current
criteria), may not be so in many young subjects. An additional reason for having missed this
association may be as follows: prior studies have established an association between FM and
small fiber neuropathy [17, 18]. Although IR is a frequent cause of small fiber neuropathy,
work up of this disorder by the investigators of these studies did not include evaluation of
HbA1c levels. Instead, other methods were used in some studies [i.e., oral glucose tolerance
tests; for example, see [17]]. Our data, if confirmed, may explain not only mechanisms ger-
mane to central pain in FM but also, the association between this disorder and small fiber
neuropathy.
It is important to give credit to the effort of other investigators who have also sought this
association. Tishler et al [25] found that the incidence of FM was higher in patients with diabe-
tes mellitus type 2 than in their control group (18% versus 2%) and suggested a potential rela-
tionship between these two disorders. In a separate study, Yanmaz et al [26] reported similar
findings.
Fava et al [27] showed that IR was a risk factor for cognitive impairment in FM patients,
but this association was limited only to cognitively impaired patients. These results would be
problematic for any causative hypothesis because, one cannot claim causation for a factor that
is present only in a small subgroup of the population afflicted by the condition. However, by
applying the strategy for data analysis reported in this study, we now demonstrate that abnor-
malities likely related to IR are much more widespread than had previously been appreciated
and may be present in most (and perhaps all) patients with FM. Interestingly, in the study
from Fava et al [27], the subjects body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were not associated
with an increase in their risk for developing cognitive impairment, suggesting that the occur-
rence of IR in these patients may not necessarily be associated with the increased body mass
index often present in patients with FM [28].
Based on our data, we would like to propose that IR is pathogenetically linked to FM. How-
ever, there are several caveats to our proposition which must be carefully considered in the
design of future clinical trials attempting to confirm this hypothesis. One is the limitation

 intrinsic to retrospective cross-sectional studies. Because IR and FM were simultaneously
assessed, evidence for causality is more difficult to establish in the absence of a temporal rela-
tionship. Secondly, patients with FM are commonly overweight or obese [28], factors which
may predispose them to the development of IR [29]. Thirdly, the results of the pharmacological
intervention were extracted from retrospective observations of treated patients and interpreted
outside the context of a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial. Finally, metformin may
have an effect in chronic pain independent of its action on IR [30, 31]. Metformin is known to
increase mitochondrial AMPK [32–34] which can result in reduced mechanical allodynia and
nociceptor activation [32–34]. In fact, one other group suggested that metformin may be useful
in FM, although a relationship to IR was not suspected or investigated by the authors [35, 36].
In this regard, it would be important for future trials to include drugs that target IR by different
mechanisms from metformin. Finally, other markers of IR, such as the homeostasis model
assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [37] and related tests should also be explored
using similar analytic strategies for age correction and comparison with normal individuals. In
their study, Fava et al [27] could not find differences between this test (HOMA-IR) in patients
with FM when compared to a control population; however, no age corrections (as reported
here) were applied to the comparison.
Despite all these caveats, this initial report prompts us to seek answers to a challenging set
of questions generated by this hypothesis. It would be unlikely for a placebo type of effect
alone to result in the impressive degree of long-lasting pain improvement experienced by
the patients who received the drug combination (metformin plus ST). Remarkably, “non-
responders” were conspicuously absent in our patient’s sample; such an unusual and atypi-
cally low “number needed to treat” (NNT) would be more in line with a disease modifying
therapy.
In conclusion, IR is being increasingly associated with a broad number of neurological dis-
orders [22–24] and FM may be one additional condition. Our data provides preliminary evi-
dence suggesting that IR may be a pathological substratum in FM and sets the stage for future
studies to confirm these initial observations. If confirmed, our findings may translate not only
into a radical paradigm shift for the management of FM but may also save billions of dollars to
healthcare systems around the world.
