SUMMARY
The recent Zika virus outbreak highlights the need for
low-cost diagnostics that can be rapidly developed
for distribution and use in pandemic regions. Here,
we report a pipeline for the rapid design, assembly,
and validation of cell-free, paper-based sensors
for the detection of the Zika virus RNA genome. By
linking isothermal RNA amplification to toehold
switch RNA sensors, we detect clinically relevant
concentrations of Zika virus sequences and demon-
strate specificity against closely related Dengue virus
sequences. When coupled with a novel CRISPR/
Cas9-based module, our sensors can discriminate
between viral strains with single-base resolution.
We successfully demonstrate a simple, field-ready
sample-processing workflow and detect Zika virus
from the plasma of a viremic macaque. Our freeze-
dried
biomolecular
platform
resolves
important
practical limitations to the deployment of molecular
diagnostics in the field and demonstrates how syn-
thetic biology can be used to develop diagnostic
tools for confronting global health crises.
INTRODUCTION
The emerging outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas has brought
this once obscure pathogen to the forefront of global healthcare.
Mostly transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosqui-
toes, Zika virus infections have been further spread by inter-
national travel and have expanded to large, heavily populated
regions of South, Central, and North America (Bogoch et al.,
2016). Correlations between the increase in Zika virus infections,
the development of fetal microcephaly (Calvet et al., 2016; Ga-
lindo-Fraga et al., 2015; Victora et al., 2016), and Guillain-Barre
´
syndrome have resulted in the declaration of a public health
emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a call
for fast-tracked development of Zika virus diagnostics (Oehler
et al., 2014; Smith and Mackenzie, 2016; WHO, 2016).
Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that has great
potential to respond to such pandemics. The increasing ability
of synthetic biologists to repurpose and engineer natural biolog-
ical components for practical applications has led to new oppor-
tunities for molecular diagnostics (Kotula et al., 2014; Lu et al.,
2013; Slomovic et al., 2015). We previously developed two
biotechnologies that dramatically lower the cost of and tech-
nical barriers to the development of synthetic biology-based
diagnostics. The first technology, programmable RNA sensors
called toehold switches, can be rationally designed to bind and
sense virtually any RNA sequence (Green et al., 2014). The sec-
ond technology, a freeze-dried, paper-based, cell-free protein
expression platform, allows for the deployment of these toehold
switch sensors outside of a research laboratory by providing a
sterile and abiotic method for the storage and distribution of
genetic circuits at room temperature (Pardee et al., 2014). We
combined these technologies to create a platform for rapidly
and inexpensively developing and deploying diagnostic sensors.
In the context of the Zika virus outbreak, the paper-based sen-
sors offer a solution to the critical challenges facing diagnosis of
the virus. Standard serological approaches, such as antibody

 detection, are limited in diagnostic value due to cross-reactivity
in patients that have previously been infected by other flavivi-
ruses circulating in the region. As a result, accurate diagnosis re-
quires nucleic acid-based detection methods, such as PCR and
isothermal nucleic acid amplification (Lanciotti et al., 2008; de M
Campos et al., 2016; Tappe et al., 2014; Zammarchi et al., 2015).
However, such techniques are relatively expensive, require tech-
nical expertise to run and interpret, and utilize equipment that is
incompatible with use in remote and low-resource locations
where surveillance and containment are critically needed.
Here, we demonstrate the rapid development of a diagnostic
workflow for sequence-specific detection of Zika virus that can
be employed in low-resource settings (Figure 1). We have ad-
dressed limitations in the practical deployment of nucleic acid-
based molecular diagnostics by combining isothermal RNA
amplification with toehold switch sensors on our freeze-dried,
paper-based platform. We automate the amplification primer
and sensor design process using in silico algorithms and demon-
strate a high-throughput pipeline to assemble and test 48 Zika
sensors in less than 7 hr. Clinically relevant sensitivity is attained
using our amplification and detection scheme, and we report no
significant detection of the closely related Dengue virus. To
further increase diagnostic capabilities, we develop a CRISPR/
Cas9-based module that discriminates between Zika genotypes
with single-base resolution. Finally, we employ a simple sample-
preparation protocol to reliably extract viral RNA and demon-
strate robust detection with this scheme using active Zika virus
samples.
RESULTS
In Silico Toehold Switch Design
Toehold switch sensors are programmable synthetic riboregula-
tors that control the translation of a gene via the binding of a
trans-acting trigger RNA. The switches contain a hairpin struc-
ture that blocks gene translation in cis by sequestration of the
ribosome binding site (RBS) and start codon. Upon a switch
binding to a complementary trigger RNA, sequestration of the
RBS and start codon is relieved, activating gene translation
(Figures 2A and 2B) (Green et al., 2014). To allow for colori-
metric detection of trigger RNA sequences, the sensors can
be designed to regulate translation of the enzyme LacZ, which
mediates a color change by converting a yellow substrate
(chlorophenol red-b-D-galactopyranoside) to a purple product
(chlorophenol red).
Toehold switch sensors for sequence-based detection of Zika
virus were generated using a modified version of the previously
developed in silico design algorithm (Supplemental Informa-
tion) (Green et al., 2014). The modified algorithm screened the
genome of the Zika strain prevalent in the Americas (Genbank:
KU312312) for regions compatible with RNA amplification and
toehold switch activation. The selected Zika genome regions
were then computationally filtered to eliminate potential homol-
ogy to the human transcriptome and to a panel of related viruses,
including Dengue and Chikungunya. A total of 24 unique regions
of the Zika genome compatible with downstream sensing efforts
were identified.
Two toehold switches, each utilizing a different design
scheme, were designed for each region, resulting in a total of
48 sensors. The first design scheme, termed the A series, utilizes
a modification to the original toehold switch (Green et al., 2014)
that reduces the size of the loop domain from 18 nts to 11 nts
(Figure 2A) to discourage loop-mediated docking of the ribo-
some and therefore reduce leakage in the OFF state. The second
design scheme, termed the B series, features a 12-nt loop and
incorporates a more thermodynamically stable stem in order to
lower OFF state gene expression (Figure 2B).
Rapid, In Vitro Sensor Assembly and Screening
In vitro assembly and initial screening of all 48 sensors took
place in a 7 hr time period, with low costs associated with
sensor development (DNA input $20 USD/sensor) and testing
Figure 1. Workflow for the Rapid Prototyping of Paper-Based, Biomolecular Sensors for Portable and Low-Cost Diagnostics
Using sequence information from online databases, primers for isothermal RNA amplification and toehold switch-based RNA sensors were designed in silico
using purpose-built algorithms. Once synthesized, the resulting sequence-specific toehold sensors can be assembled and validated in less than 7 hr. In under a
day, validated sensors can be embedded into paper and freeze-dried along with a cell-free transcription and translation system to be deployed in the field as
stable diagnostics. For the diagnostic test, extracted RNA is isothermally amplified via NASBA and used to rehydrate the freeze-dried paper sensors. The
detection of the appropriate trigger RNA is indicated by a color change in the paper disc from yellow to purple.

 ($0.10–$1/test). All 48 sensors and 24 targeted genomic regions
were assembled in-house using in vitro protocols. Toehold
switches were constructed by ligating the sensors (�130 nt)
to a LacZ reporter element in a single 2 hr PCR-based step.
Sensor performance screening to assess each sensor against
its respective trigger RNA element (Zika genome fragment)
was completed using low volume, cell-free transcription and
translation reactions on paper. We found that 25 (52%) of the
48 sensors produce a fold change of five or greater in the pres-
ence of the appropriate trigger element (128–178 nucleotide
regions of the Zika genome; Figures 2C, 2D, and S1). The
top-ranked sensors exhibited activation as high as 34-fold
over sensor alone (sensor 27B) and were activated in as quickly
as 20 min after incubation at 37�C (sensors 7A and 8A). For
all sensors, maximum fold change occurred within the first
90 min. Averaging the LacZ output from sensors not exposed
to trigger RNA confirmed that the low background design of
the series B toehold switch sensors successfully reduced signal
leakage (Figure 2D, inset).
Assessing and Improving Zika Sensor Sensitivity
We selected top performing sensors from both the A and B series
for trigger RNA titration experiments and found that all chosen
sensors were activated with as little as 30 nM of trigger RNA
(Figure 3A). The sensors displayed a linear response to RNA
concentration, providing semiquantitative information on input
trigger RNA values (Figure S2A). Additionally, our top three sen-
sors were highly orthogonal to each other when challenged
with a high dose of trigger RNA from off-target Zika sequences
(3,000 nM) (Figure S2B).

output gene expression.
(B) Series B toehold switch sensor schematic. Based on the same Zika genomic region as the A series, these sensors include a 12-nt loop and lack the refolding
domain. These modifications were made to further reduce LacZ reporter leakage in the OFF state.

rate is determined from the slope of absorbance at 570 nm over time (sensor alone versus sensor with 3,000 nM RNA trigger). Sensors are ordered according to
fold change.

replicates. Inset: average LacZ absorbance of the OFF states at 60 min indicates an overall reduction in LacZ reporter leakage for the Series B sensors. Error bars
represent SD across the 24 sensors.

 Though the sensors displayed specificity for their respective
Zika RNA trigger, they were unable to detect clinically relevant
RNA concentrations. Zika viral loads have been documented
as high as 202 3 106 copies/ml (365 fM) in urine (Gourinat
et al., 2015). However, viral loads in saliva and serum are report-
edly even lower, with 3 3 106 copies/ml (4.9 fM) (Barzon et al.,
2016) documented in patient saliva and 2.5 3 106 copies/ml
(4.1 fM) (Zika Experimental Science Team, 2016) and 7.2 3 105
copies/ml (1.2 fM) (Lanciotti et al., 2008) in primate and patient

serum, respectively. Accordingly, to in-
crease the sensitivity of our diagnostic
platform, we incorporated an isothermal
RNA amplification technique known as
NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based
amplification) into our workflow (Figure 1).
NASBA is a promising candidate for
use with our diagnostic scheme because
it is known to be extremely sensitive and
has a proven track record in field-based
diagnostic
applications
(Cordray
and
Richards-Kortum, 2012). The amplifica-
tion process begins with reverse tran-
scription of a target RNA that is mediated
by a sequence-specific reverse primer to
create an RNA/DNA duplex. RNase H
then degrades the RNA template, allow-
ing a forward primer containing the T7
promoter to bind and initiate elongation
of the complementary strand, generating
a double-stranded DNA product. T7-
mediated transcription of the DNA tem-
plate then creates copies of the target
RNA sequence. Importantly, each new
target RNA can be detected by the
toehold switch sensors and also serve
as starting material for further amplifica-
tion cycles. NASBA requires an initial
heating step (65�C), followed by isothermal amplification at
41�C (Figure 3B) (Guatelli et al., 1990).
NASBA was performed on trigger RNA corresponding to
Zika genomic regions for sensors 27B and 32B. Trigger
RNAs were spiked into either water or human serum (7%) to
more closely mimic clinical samples. NASBA reactions were
run for 2 hr and then applied to freeze-dried, paper-based sen-
sors. We saw detection with Zika sensors from NASBA reac-
tions initiated with as little as 3 fM of trigger RNA (Figure 3C),
1258
Cell 165, 1255–1266, May 19, 2016
 a value within the range of reported patient viral loads. Zika
sensor detection of NASBA-amplified trigger RNA proved to
be reliable on samples spiked into either serum or water (Fig-
ure S2C). Additionally, for reactions initialized with high con-
centrations of trigger RNA (> 300 fM), NASBA reaction times
could be reduced to as little as 30 min (Figure S2D). NASBA re-
agents are compatible with freeze-drying (Figure S2E) and
could therefore be easily deployed and utilized alongside our
paper-based sensors. We also demonstrated that NASBA
can be run in the absence of the initial heating step (65�C) (Fig-
ure S2F), further reducing the technical and power require-
ments for deployment.
Moving toward a Field-Ready Diagnostic Platform
To move our experiments toward conditions more representa-
tive of those found in clinics worldwide, we focused on three
key efforts: (1) testing sensor specificity against related viruses
that share clinical symptoms, partial homology, and geographic
range with Zika virus; (2) building a second-generation portable,
battery-powered reader to provide lab-quality results in low-
resource environments; and (3) developing a low-cost and trac-
table method for viral RNA extraction.
Although our sensor design algorithm screened for Zika
genomic sequences that are mostly distinct from those of related
viruses, the targeted Zika sequences do share substantial simi-
larity (51%–59%) with their Dengue virus counterparts (Figures
S3A and S3B). To test the Zika sensors for possible cross-reac-
tivity, we exposed the sensors to regions of the Dengue genome
that share a degree of homology with regions targeted in the Zika
genome. Sensors 27B and 32B were treated with high concen-
trations of RNA amplicons (3,000 nM) from either Zika or Dengue
genomic regions. As seen in Figure 4A, Dengue RNA sequences
failed to activate the toehold switch sensors. We also tested our
NASBA primer sets for specificity to their targeted Zika se-
quences by applying the NASBA-mediated amplification and
paper-based detection scheme to 300 fM inputs of the Dengue
and Zika RNA in human serum (7%). Again, we did not see a
response to the Dengue RNA sequences, demonstrating robust
sequence specificity in our amplification and detection scheme
(Figure 4B).

dried, paper-based reactions at 37�C. Error bars represent SD from three replicates.

trigger RNA in 7% human serum. To increase sensitivity, NASBA reactions were run for 2.5 hr. Graphs plot the relative absorbance of 570 nm wavelength light
compared to background, which was collected every minute from freeze-dried, cell-free reactions embedded into paper.

by sensor 32B. Three femtomolar of virus was spiked into 7% human serum and heated to 95�C for 2 min to extract viral RNA. The boiled lysate was used to
initiate NASBA-mediated RNA amplification. A 1:7 dilution of the 2 hr NASBA reaction in water was then used to rehydrate freeze-dried paper-based reactions.
Time-course data were collected on the portable electronic reader as in (C).

 As part of our efforts to advance the paper-based sensor plat-
form toward field-ready diagnostics, we designed a second-
generation portable electronic reader to serve as an accessible,
low-cost companion technology that provides robust and quan-
titative measurements of sensor outputs. The electronic reader
was assembled using readily available consumer components,
open-source code, and laser-cut acrylic housing, with a total
cost of just under $250 (Figure S4 and Table S3). The reader is
powered by a lithium ion battery (18.5 hr) that can be re-charged
via micro USB and houses onboard data storage (4 GB) to
resolve the need for an attached laptop during diagnostic reads
(Pardee et al., 2014). To achieve sensitive detection of toehold
switch signal output, an acrylic chip that holds the freeze-dried,
paper-based reactions is placed into the reader between an LED
light source (570 nm) and electronic sensors (Figure S4B). Using
onboard electronics, each sample is read 29 times per minute,
providing low-noise measurements of changes in light transmis-
sion due to LacZ-mediated color change.
To demonstrate the utility of the companion reader, we moni-
tored detection of 1 fM and 3 fM of Zika RNA amplicons that had
been amplified in NASBA reactions for 2.5 hr. The reader de-
tected significant signal from both samples, which are within
the reported range of Zika virus in patient serum (1.2 fM) and
urine (365 fM) (Gourinat et al., 2015; Lanciotti et al., 2008), after
just over 20 min (Figure 4C).
Our next challenge was to develop a technique to release RNA
from the viral capsid using simple methodology compatible with
low-resource environments. To this end, we tested the efficacy
of boiling viral samples to break down the capsid. For initial
development, we engineered lentivirus, which is also an RNA
virus, to encapsulate the regions of either the Zika or Dengue
genomes that correspond to the sensor 32B target sequence
(Figure S3B). These proxy Zika and Dengue viruses were spiked
into human serum (7%) at a final concentration of 3 fM and heat-
ed to 95�C for either 1 or 2 min. The resulting lysates were then
immediately used to initiate NASBA reactions, in order to simu-
late what might be recovered from a patient sample. Boiling
the viral samples for one minute was sufficient to release detect-
able amounts of RNA in our amplification and toehold switch
detection scheme (Figure S3C). NASBA reactions from 2 min
boiled samples were also monitored for sensor activation on
the portable electronic reader. We detected strong sensor acti-
vation in less than 30 min from 3 fM of lentivirus carrying Zika
RNA. We were also able to demonstrate clear discrimination be-
tween lentiviruses containing Zika and Dengue RNA sequences
(Figure 4D).
A NASBA-CRISPR Cleavage Assay to Discriminate
between Zika Strains
During epidemic outbreaks, it is often valuable to monitor
pathogen lineage andgeographic spread. In some cases, genetic
variants may be responsible for different clinical manifestations of
infection. For example, the Zika strain found in Brazil has been
uniquely connected with higher incidences of fetal microcephaly
and Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (Calvet et al., 2016; Mlakar et al.,
2016). To allow for strain-specific detection and tracking, we
developed an assay that provides single-base discrimination
in a manner that is compatible with our freeze-dried sensor
platform. Our assay, which we term NASBA-CRISPR Cleavage
(NASBACC), leverages the sequence-specific nuclease activity
of CRISPR/Cas9 to discriminate between viral lineages (Fig-
ure 5A). To do this, NASBACCexploitsthe ability ofCas9 to selec-
tively cleave DNA only in the presence of an NGG protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM). Since any non-biased mutation has a
48% probability of either creating a new PAM site or destroying
an existing one (Table S4), there are many strain-specific PAM
sites that can be used for lineage discrimination (Figures 5B
and 5C). In the NASBACC detection scheme, RNA sequences
undergo NASBA amplification utilizing a reverse primer designed
to append the trigger sequence of a synthetic toehold switch
(sensor H, Figure 5A) (Pardee et al., 2014). In the presence of
the appropriate PAM sequence and guide RNA target site, the
double-stranded DNA that is synthesized as part of the NASBA
reaction undergoes Cas9-mediated cleavage, resulting in a trun-
cated RNA product that is unable to activate the sensor H toehold
switch. In the absence of the PAM sequence, the full-length RNA
product containing the sensor H trigger sequence is generated,
allowing for sensor H activation. Trigger RNA is only amplified
from DNA that is not cut by Cas9, thereby allowing for strain-spe-
cific detection using toehold sensor H.
Using the paper-based system, sensor 32B was able to distin-
guish between Zika and Dengue RNA sequences. However, this
sensor could not discriminate between the African (GenBank:
KF268950) and American (GenBank: KU312312) Zika variants
(Figure 5D), a feature that may be useful in certain diagnostic ap-
plications. To address this, we applied our NASBACC detection
scheme to discriminate between the African and American Zika
strains. Due to a single-base difference in the trigger regions of
these two strains, a PAM site only exists in the American-lineage
sequence (Figure 5C). Thus, only the American strain sequence
was cleaved by Cas9, which led to amplification of truncated
RNA that did not activate the sensor H toehold switch (Figure 5E).
Conversely, the African strain sequence does not contain the
PAM site and was not cleaved by Cas9, which resulted in ampli-
fication of full-length RNA that activated the sensor H toehold
switch. Incorporating NASBACC into our diagnostic workflow
can provide precise genotypic information within a few hours.
As with the other biomolecular elements of this workflow, Cas9
is compatible with lyophilization and could be used in the field
(Figure S5).
Diagnostic Workflow Validation with Active Zika Virus
We next sought to validate our sensor platform with live Zika
virus. First, we verified that our amplification and detection
scheme could successfully detect full-length genomic RNA puri-
fied from Zika virus (Uganda strain MR 766) (Figure 6A). We de-
signed new NASBA primers to accommodate sequence differ-
ences between the Uganda Zika strain (GenBank: AY632535)
and the American Zika strain (GenBank: KU312312) that our
sensors and primers had originally been designed to detect.
Computational analysis suggested that Uganda-lineage Zika
RNA would activate sensor 32B despite two base mismatches
in the toehold region, and this was confirmed experimentally
(Figure 6A). We also demonstrated sensor orthogonality to full-
length genomic Dengue RNA isolated from three different
Dengue serotypes using these methods (Figure 6A).
1260
Cell 165, 1255–1266, May 19, 2016
 Once we confirmed that the sensors behaved as expected
on full-length genomic RNA, we sought to validate the sample
preparation scheme and diagnostic workflow from start to fin-
ish. Active Zika virus was cultured in the laboratory and spiked
into human serum (7%) at a final concentration of 10 fM, to
mimic a clinical sample. The viral sample was then heated
to 95�C for 2 min, and the resulting lysate was subjected to
NASBA amplification for three hours. Sensor activation from
the NASBA-amplified viral sample was monitored on the
portable electronic reader. We successfully detected activation
of sensor 32B from a diagnostic workflow initiated with live Zika
virus (Figure 6B).

Figure 5. NASBA-CRISPR Cleavage (NASBACC) Allows for Strain Differentiation at Single-Base Resolution
(A) Schematic representation of NASBACC genotyping following a positive Zika diagnosis. A synthetic trigger sequence is appended to a NASBA-amplified RNA
fragment through reverse transcription. The presence of a strain-specific PAM leads to the production of either truncated or full-length trigger RNA, which
differentially activates a toehold switch (sensor H) (Pardee et al., 2014).
(B) The probability that a non-biased single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between two strains can be discriminated by CRISPR/Cas9 is 48% (Table S4). Hence,
genetic drift between the American and African or Asian strains, while relatively small (14.4% and 4.9% sequence dissimilarity, respectively), has created
hundreds of strain-specific PAM sites.
(C) A SNP between African (GenBank: KF268950) and American (GenBank: KU312312) strains at site 7330 disrupts an existing PAM site, allowing for Cas9-
mediated DNA cleavage only in the American strain.
(D) Sensor 32B can distinguish between Dengue and Zika RNA sequences but cannot discriminate between American and African Zika strains. Paper discs
containing sensor 32B were rehydrated with 300 nM trigger RNA corresponding to sequences from American-Zika, African-Zika, or Dengue. Colorimetric
outputs: a purple color indicates the activation of LacZ expression from the toehold switch, and a yellow color indicates the toehold switch remained inactive.
(E) NASBACC can discriminate between American- and African-lineages of Zika virus. Paper discs containing sensor H were rehydrated with a 1:10 dilution of
NASBACC reactions initiated with 0.05 ml of a 300 nM RNA sample. In this case, an inactive toehold switch leads to a positive identification of the American Zika
strain.

 For the final validation of our system, we acquired and tested
plasma samples from a viremic macaque infected with Zika virus
(GenBank: KJ776791) (Zika Experimental Science Team, 2016).
The macaque was found to have a plasma viral load of 1.7 3 106
copies/ml (2.8 fM) by a standard qRT-PCR protocol, which was
within the detection limits of our platform as tested on synthetic
RNA amplicons (Figure 4C). The viremic plasma was diluted 1:10
in water to reduce known inhibitory effects of plasma on down-
stream reactions and was then taken through our sample pro-
cessing and diagnostic workflow. The sample was heated to
95�C for 2 min and then amplified via NASBA for 3 hr. Paper-
based reactions were monitored on the portable electronic
reader and showed strong activation with both sensors 27B
and 32B in less than 30 min (Figures 6C and 6D).
DISCUSSION
Rapid Sensor Development Pipeline for Low-Resource
Molecular Diagnostics
We have devised a rapid diagnostic development pipeline in
response to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. The serious but
poorly understood complications of this viral infection make its
timely diagnosis critical for patient health and for limiting its rapid
proliferation. However, the poor performance of antibody detec-
tion methods (Lanciotti et al., 2008; de M Campos et al., 2016;
Tappe et al., 2014; Zammarchi et al., 2015) and the limitations
of traditional sequence-based diagnostics have left technical
and economic challenges to meeting diagnostic needs.
Our paper-based platform directly addresses these needs by
enabling sequence-specific detection of Zika virus in a low-cost
manner that is tractable in low-resource settings. By freeze-
drying cell-free transcription and translation systems with ge-
netic sensors onto paper, we have created a sterile and abiotic
platform that can be utilized outside of laboratory conditions
without concern over biosafety. Furthermore, the freeze-dried
biomolecular components remain stable at room temperature,
allowing for easy storage and distribution in global settings.
Our application is easy to use, relying on a colorimetric output
that can be read by the naked eye or with a low-cost, battery-
operated companion reader, and we are actively working to
improve field-readiness via development of a third-generation
reader with onboard capabilities for sample preparation and
incubation.
The streamlined sensor development platform we describe
here provides a generalizable method for a rapid response to
any emerging outbreak. Our automated design process compu-
tationally screens for sequence specificity and feeds into a
high-throughput protocol for rapid sensor prototyping in vitro.
We augmented our diagnostic sensors with an upstream
target-amplification scheme that allows for detection of target
sequences in the low femtomolar range, bringing sensor sensi-
tivity in line with in-patient virus concentrations (Gourinat et al.,
2015; Lanciotti et al., 2008). Additionally, we demonstrated that
simply boiling an RNA virus liberates sufficient material for down-
stream amplification and detection processes (Figures 4D, 6,
and S3C), and we developed a CRISPR-based tool for accurate
strain genotyping on paper (Figure 5). Finally, our methods were
validated on viremic plasma samples (Figures 6C and 6D),
demonstrating a level of sensitivity that would be required for
use of this diagnostic scheme in the field.

 Isothermal RNA Amplification and Nucleic-Acid-Based
Diagnostics for Low-Resource Settings
Our unique approach of linking NASBA to a downstream syn-
thetic gene network for output detection can be applied to any
nucleic acid amplification scheme. This innovative development
addresses several key technical and economic challenges in the
employment of isothermal amplification methods in the field.
Namely, although NASBA has exceptional sensitivity to low-level
infections, the technique is costly ($5–$20/test) and susceptible
to contamination that can lead to off-target products and false
positives (Casper et al., 2007; Cordray and Richards-Kortum,
2012; Ulrich et al., 2010). Our diagnostic scheme addresses
both of these points and brings NASBA closer toward applica-
tion in low-resource settings. The low-volume paper-based re-
actions only use a fraction of a microliter of NASBA product
($0.51/ml), significantly reducing the total cost of NASBA per
test. Additionally, linking NASBA to a synthetic gene network
for signal detection allows for rapid and sensitive output reads
in a cost-effective manner ($0.10–$1/test) that is practical for
use in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the chance for
false-positive results due to contamination is minimized by the
use of sequence-specific toehold switch sensors and CRISPR/
Cas9-mediated selection downstream of the amplification. Our
ability to eliminate the initial 65�C heating step (Figure S2F)
traditionally used in NASBA reactions streamlines the diagnostic
protocol for in-field use and reduces the requirements of the
hardware necessary for monitoring results. Finally, we have
shown that NASBA reagents can be freeze-dried (Figure S2E)
and therefore could be distributed around the world at room tem-
perature alongside our toehold switch sensors. We are also
actively working toward combining NASBA and toehold switch
sensor reactions in a one-pot assay that will further streamline
the diagnostic protocol and shorten the timeframe for readout.
We note that certain components within blood are known to
inhibit PCR (Schrader et al., 2012) and similarly affect all nucleic
acid based diagnostics, including NASBA. However, we found
that a simple dilution of serum or plasma into water sufficiently
removes this effect in our diagnostic scheme. We therefore
used diluted human serum (7%) as a matrix for our exploratory
experiments and diluted viremic plasma samples (10%) for our
final validation experiment. The dilution step does affect the
overall sensitivity of the diagnostic platform, but we have shown
that increasing the NASBA reaction time can sufficiently
compensate for reduced sensitivity. Indeed, we were able to
detect 2.8 fM of Zika virus from plasma samples from an infected
rhesus macaque using our dilution protocol (Figures 6C and 6D).
Additionally, a recent study found that Zika virus can be detected
at high concentrations in saliva (Barzon et al., 2016), which may
not inhibit nucleic acid amplification to the same extent as
blood. We are actively working to test other clinical matrices
for compatibility with our diagnostic platform.
A Robust and Field-Ready Sample Preparation Scheme
for RNA Viruses
In this work, we implemented a simple procedure to extract viral
RNA that does not require specialized laboratory equipment. By
simply boiling (95�C) virus samples for 2 min, we were able to
extract sufficient quantities of RNA for amplification and detec-
tion in our diagnostic platform (Figures 4D and 6B–6D). We
note that we worked quickly to transfer boiled viral samples to
NASBA reactions that contained RNase inhibitors to protect
the integrity of the viral RNA. In practice, other commercially
available reagents could be added to the sample to protect the
RNA from degradation upon collection. Of note, we were able
to reliably extract RNA from three different sample types using
our methodology: engineered lentivirus (Figure 4D), cultured
Zika virus (Figure 6B), and plasma from an infected rhesus ma-
caque (Figures 6C and 6D), highlighting the robustness of our
sample preparation scheme.
Programmability of Molecular Sensors Can Address
Rapidly Changing Diagnostic Needs
Our platform provides multiple levels of molecular programma-
bility that greatly improve diagnostic specificity. Both the toehold
switches and NASBA primers can be designed to target regions
specific to a given genome, while excluding regions with signifi-
cant homology to other organisms. We demonstrated the effec-
tiveness of this design algorithm with sensor 32B, which was
able to distinguish genomic Zika RNA from the genomic RNA
of three different Dengue serotypes (Figure 6A). Additionally,
the NASBACC module allows for single-base discrimination
and can be rationally designed to distinguish between different
genotypes, adding to the overall programmability of our platform
(Figure 5E). Given the high sensor success rate and low barriers
to development, we envision that sensors could be easily multi-
plexed to ensure high-confidence diagnosis (reducing both false
negative and false positive results) while keeping costs low.
Furthermore, the diagnostic platform could be deployed as
panels that include sensors for strain-specific identification and
related infections to help monitor the spread of illness.
However, in some cases, it is beneficial for a diagnostic plat-
form to be able to tolerate genetic mutations within a particular
nucleic acid sequence. Evolutionary drift, for example, is an un-
avoidable feature of our ongoing arms race with pathogens that
all molecular diagnostics must confront. Our assay in particular
has the capacity to tolerate the expected genetic variation found
in nature. We analyzed the binding between the toehold switch
32B and RNA sequences from homologous regions in Zika
strains isolated from Africa and Asia (Supplemental Information:
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Both of these strains
are predicted to fully activate the toehold sensors, even with
up to 4-nt (11%) mismatches. In fact, we were able to demon-
strate this using RNA triggers from the American strain, two
different African strains, and an Asian-lineage of the virus (Fig-
ures 5D and 6). Additionally, a critical feature of our technology
is the ability to rapidly and inexpensively prototype new genetic
sensors, thus allowing for a rapid response to genetic variations
and mutations as they arise.
Freeze-Dried Biomolecular Networks for Addressing
Real-World Issues in Real Time
With our goal of responding to the ongoing outbreak in a timely
manner, we began our work using synthetic RNA fragments
spiked into human serum, followed by engineered lentiviruses
to mimic clinical samples. As with many proof-of-concept diag-
nostic studies, synthetic samples provided us with a powerful
Cell 165, 1255–1266, May 19, 2016
1263
 tool for optimizing our sensor platform ahead of the regulatory
demands required for use of live pathogens (Antunes et al.,
2015; Crannell et al., 2014; Rohrman et al., 2012; Stefan et al.,
2016; Yen et al., 2015). Through collaborative efforts with the
Zika virus community, we were able to test our platform on live
Zika virus and were pleased to find similar detection thresholds
with Zika virus isolated from infected Vero cells (Figure 6B) and
plasma samples from an infected rhesus macaque (Figures 6C
and 6D). Our rapid response to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak
and our ability to achieve clinically relevant sensitivity and
specificity highlight the utility and practicality of this platform
technology.
Our synthetic biology pipeline for rapid sensor design and
prototyping could be applied to a broad range of public health
threats, allowing for rapid development of new diagnostics
when and where they are most needed. The ease of in vitro
sensor synthesis will allow for the widespread use of validated
sensor sequences, aiding rapid global responses to current
and future health crises. Finally, our ability to expeditiously
design and implement our biomolecular diagnostics for an
emerging pathogen using the engineering principles of synthetic
biology suggests that the field will play an ever-increasing role in
the support and improvement of human health.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
In Silico Sensor Design and DNA Synthesis
A set of 48 toehold switch sensors and corresponding NASBA primers were
generated using an integrated in silico design algorithm. See the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures section in the Supplemental Information for details.
DNA Sensor Assembly
Toehold switch constructs were amplified from DNA templates (Integrated
DNA Technologies) and ligated to the lacZ reporter gene via PCR. Plasmids
were constructed for characterization of the top six toehold switches (Fig-
ure 3A). The DNA templates were amplified using PCR and inserted into pET
system parent plasmids (EMD Millipore) using Gibson assembly (Gibson
et al., 2009) with 30 bp overlap regions. Plasmids for sensors 27B and 32B
are available through Addgene (plasmid numbers: 75006–75011).
Cell-Free Reactions
Details of RNA sensor validation are described in Pardee et al. (2014). Briefly,
amplified sensor DNA was column purified and tested on paper discs (2 mm)
containing freeze-dried, cell-free reactions (NEB, PURExpress) in the
presence or absence of trigger RNA coding for a complementary region of
the Zika virus genome (128–178 nts). The cell-free reactions consisted of:
NEB Solution A (40%) and B (30%), chlorophenol red-b-D-galactopyranoside
(Sigma, 0.6 mg/ml), RNase inhibitor (Roche, 03335402001; 0.5%), and linear
DNA constructs encoding the toehold sensors (0.33 nM). The paper discs
(Whatman, 1442-042) were blocked in 5% BSA overnight prior to use.
Trigger RNA was produced using T7 RNAP-based transcription (Epicenter
ASF3257) from linear DNA templates. Paper-based reactions (1.8 ml) were
incubated at 37�C using either our companion electronic reader inside a
humidified chamber or a plate reader (BioTek Neo). For the in-house reader,
paper discs were placed into 2 mm holes in a removable acrylic chip; for
the plate reader, paper discs were placed into black, clear bottom 384-well
plates (Corning 3544). See Movie S1 for the paper-based cell-free reaction
methodology.
NASBA
For NASBA reactions, the trigger elements (128–178 nts) were extended by
100 nts on the 50 and 30 ends with the relevant Zika genome sequence to pro-
vide suitable template RNAs. RNA amplicons were spiked into 7% human
serum (Sigma H4522) where indicated. Reaction Buffer (Life Sciences
NECB-24; 33.5%), Nucleotide Mix (Life Sciences NECN-24; 16.5%), RNase in-
hibitor (Roche, 03335402001; 0.5%), 12.5 mM of each NASBA primer (2%),
nuclease free water (2.5%), and RNA amplicon (20%) were assembled at
4�C and incubated at 65�C for 2 min, followed by a 10 min incubation at
41�C. Enzyme Mix (Life Sciences NEC-1-24; 25%) was then added to the re-
action (for a final volume of 5 mL), and the mixture was incubated at 41�C for
2 hr unless noted otherwise. For output reads with paper-based toeholds,
the NASBA reactions were diluted 1:7 in water. See Table S2 for primer
sequences.
Lentivirus Preparation and Processing
HEK293FT cells (Life Technologies, R70007) used for virus packaging were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin,
and 4 mM GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scientific). 12 hr prior to transfection,
6.5 3 106 cells were seeded in a 10 cm dish. 7.5 mg psPAX2, 2.5 mg
pMD2.G, and 10 mg pSB700 modified to include a Zika or Dengue RNA frag-
ment were transfected using the HeBS-CaCl2 method. Media was changed
12 hr post-transfection. 27 hr after changing media, viral supernatant was har-
vested and filtered using a 0.45 mm syringe filter. Viral supernatant was then
purified with ViraBind Lentivirus Purification Kit (Cell Biolabs VPK-104) and
buffer exchanged into 1xPBS with Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech, 631231).
Viral RNA concentration was quantified using QuickTiter Lentivirus Quantifica-
tion Kit (VPK-112). Virus samples were spiked into 7% human serum at a final
volume of 25 ml. Samples were heated to 95�C for 1 and 2 min and used as
input to NASBA.
Zika Virus Preparation and Processing
100 ml of Zika virus isolate (MR 766) was utilized for infection of 106 Vero cells in
4 ml of media (DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum [FCS] and peni-
cillin-streptomycin). The supernatant was removed after 2 hr of incubation at
37�C and replaced with fresh media (DMEM, 10% FCS) for 48 hr of infection.
Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,500 rcf for 10 min, and aliquots
of the virus were stored at �80�C until use. The virus was buffer exchanged
into 1xPBS with Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech, 631231). Viral RNA concen-
trations were determined from virus purified with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (QIAGEN 52904) and confirmed with qRT-PCR. The titer of the Zika virus
used was 6.7 3 107 infectious units per milliliter (Lambeth et al., 2005). Virus
samples were spiked into 7% human serum at a final volume of 30 ml. Samples
were heated to 95�C for 2 min and used as input to NASBA. NASBA primers
were re-designed to accommodate the MR 766 strain sequence (see Supple-
mental Information).
Dengue Orthogonality
Genomic RNA from three Dengue serotypes was purified using the QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN 52904). Dengue 1 (GenBank: KM204119), Dengue
2 (GenBank: KM204118), Dengue 4 (GenBank: AF326573). NASBA reactions
using the sensor 32B primer set were performed on 30 pM RNA for 2 hr.
NASBA reactions were diluted 1:7 in water and used to rehydrate freeze-dried,
paper-based reactions containing sensor 32B.
Electronic Optical Reader
The portable device consists of four layers housed within a laser-cut acrylic
box fastened together with metal screws and mounting brackets (Figure S4;
McMaster-Carr, 8505K14, 98164A061; Digi-Key, 36-621-ND). The top layer
holds a multiplexer (Sparkfun, BOB-09056), solderable breadboard (Sparkfun,
PRT-12702), friction lock connectors (Digi-Key, A31001-ND, A19473-ND) and
16 LEDs (Digi-Key, 754-1262-ND). The LEDs have a very narrow viewing angle
and an emission of 570 nm to match the absorbance maximum of the chloro-
phenol red product from the LacZ reaction. The LEDs were placed in close
proximity to the chip in the middle layer, which holds 16 paper disks within
2 mm apertures. The apertures prevented transmission of stray light and
were coaxial with the LEDs in the top layer and the array of 16 TSL2591
sensors (Adafruit, 1980) in the third layer below, which also contained two
solderable breadboards and connectors as above. The bottom layer contains
the Arduino Uno with an attached Power Shield (Adafruit, 2708) connected
to a rechargeable 2,000 mAh lithium ion battery (Adafruit, 2011) on which a
1264
Cell 165, 1255–1266, May 19, 2016
 data-logging shield (Adafruit, 1141) was stacked with connectors (Digi-Key,
A30954-ND, A19476) and a 4GB SD/MicroSD Card (Adafruit, 102). To prevent
crosstalk between reads, reactions were read in series by sequentially
activating each LED and sensor pair. The read frequency and pattern of the
reader can be easily adjusted by modifying and uploading alternative sketches
to the Arduino. The raw data (which is the median of 29 100 ms, 4283 gain
reads per minute) was saved to the SD card along with the date and time of
the run, integration time and gain settings. The data were processed with
the MATLAB script and graphed in Prism. A diagram of the circuit and an
overview of the laser cut parts can be found in the supplemental figures
(Figure S4) and laser cutting patterns, the Arduino sketch and MATLAB script
are in Data S1. See Movie S2 for an in-depth look at the electronic optical
reader.
Calculation of Fold Change
Thecalculationof foldchangeforplatereaderdatawas donebyfirstsubtracting
thebackgroundabsorbance measuredfrompaper-based reactionsthatdidnot
contain sensor DNA or trigger RNA. These normalized values were smoothed to
reducemeasurementnoiseusing athree-point averageof thetimepointand the
data collected 10 min before and after. The minimum value of each well was
then adjusted to zero. For data presented in Figures 3, 4, and 6, fold change
was calculated from these zero adjusted values by dividing the wells at each
time point by the average signal from the corresponding sensor-alone control
wells. For our initial sensor screen (Figure 2), we used a more sensitive measure
of fold change based on the difference in the rate of color change between con-
trol and RNA trigger wells. This was done by calculating the rate of change in
normalized absorbance (570 nm) values using slope; where, at each 10 min
time point, the rate was calculated using Sn = (Tn+1 - Tn)/10, where T is
the normalized data at a time point (Tn) and the time point 10 min later (Tn+1),
and Sn is the slope reported for Tn. Fold change was then calculated as
above. MATLAB script to analyze data collected on a plate reader is provided
in Data S1.
NASBA-CRISPR Cleavage (NASBACC)
Reactions were performed in a 5 ml volume containing (NASBA buffer), 1 ml of a
250 nM Cas9 nuclease (NEB, M0386), and 250 nM purified gRNA (GeneArt
precision gRNA synthesis kit, ThermoFisher Scientific, A29377) mix, 3 nM
NASBACC primers, and 0.4 units of RNase inhibitor (NEB, M0314). The for-
ward NASBACC primer is composed of the reverse complement of the trigger
H sequence (50- GTT TGA ATG AAT TGT AGG CTT GTT ATA GTT ATG TTT-30)
and the forward binding sequence of the (region 32) NASBA primers. The
reverse NASBACC primer contains the T7 promoter sequence (50-CTA ATA
CGA CTC ACT ATA GG-30) followed by the reverse binding sequence of the
(region 32) NASBA primers. The assembled reaction was incubated at 37�C
for 2–6 hr. For toehold activation assay on freeze-dried paper, NASBACC re-
actions were diluted 1:10 in nuclease-free water.
Viremic Plasma Processing
Details on macaque care and infection can be found in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. For processing, plasma was diluted 1:10 in
nuclease free water, heated to 95�C for 2 min, and immediately added to a
NASBA reaction. NASBA was run for 3 hr.
qRT-PCR to Determine Macaque Plasma Viral Loads
Viral RNA was extracted from 300 ml of plasma using the Viral Total Nucleic
Acid Purification Kit (Promega) on a Maxwell 16 MDx instrument. Viral RNA
was quantified by qRT-PCR using the primers and probe designed by Lanciotti
et al. (2008). The RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum
one-step quantitative RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) on the LightCycler 480 in-
strument (Roche Diagnostics). Primers and probe were used at final concen-
trations of 600 nm and 100 nm, respectively, along with 150 ng random primers
(Promega). Cycling conditions were as follows: 37�C for 15 min, 50�C for
30 min, and 95�C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95�C for 15 s and 60�C
for 1 min. Virus concentration was determined by interpolation onto an internal
standard curve composed of seven 10-fold serial dilutions of a synthetic ZIKV
RNA fragment based on the Asian lineage.
