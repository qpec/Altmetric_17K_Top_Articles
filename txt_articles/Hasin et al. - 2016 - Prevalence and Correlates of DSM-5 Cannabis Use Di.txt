Objective: Attitudes toward marijuana are changing, the
prevalence of DSM-IV cannabis use disorder has increased,
and DSM-5 modified the cannabis use disorder criteria.
Therefore, updated information is needed on the prevalence,
demographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, dis-
ability, and treatment for DSM-5 cannabis use disorder.
Method: In 2012–2013, 36,309 participants $18 years old
were interviewed in the National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions–III. Psychiatric and sub-
stance use disorders were assessed with the Alcohol Use
Disorders and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule–5.
Results: The prevalences of 12-month and lifetime cannabis
use disorder were 2.5% and 6.3%. Among those with
12-month and lifetime diagnoses, the mean days of mari-
juana use per year were 225.3 (SE=5.7) and 274.2 (SE=3.8).
The odds of 12-month and lifetime cannabis use disorder
were higher for men, Native Americans, unmarried individuals,
those with low incomes, and young adults (e.g., among those
age 18–24 years versus $45: odds ratio for 12-month dis-
order, 7.2; 95% confidence interval, 5.5–9.5). Cannabis use
disorder was associated with other substance use disor-
ders, affective disorders, anxiety, and personality disorders.
Twelve-month cannabis use disorder was associated with
disability. As disorder severity increased, virtually all associ-
ations became stronger. Only 13.2% with lifetime cannabis
use disorder participated in 12-step programs or professional
treatment.
Conclusions: DSM-5 cannabis use disorder is prevalent,
associated with comorbidity and disability, and largely un-
treated. Findings suggestthe needto improve prevention and
educate the public, professionals, and policy makers about
possible harms associated with cannabis use disorders and
available interventions.

Cannabis use and DSM-IV cannabis use disorders are as-
sociated with adverse consequences (1, 2), including cog-
nitive decline (3–5), impaired educational or occupational
attainment (6–8), impaired driving ability (9–13), emer-
gency room visits (14), psychiatric symptoms (15–17), poor
quality of life (18), other drug use (19), and risk of addiction
or substance use disorders (1). Despite this, Americans in-
creasingly view marijuana use as harmless (1, 20–22) and
support its legalization (23). Reflecting these changing
views, 23 states now have laws permitting marijuana use
formedicalpurposes(ofwhichfouralsolegalizedmarijuana
for recreational use). Marijuana use is more prevalent in
these 23 states than in others (24–26). Consistent with
these changes, marked increases have occurred in the
U.S. prevalence of DSM-IV cannabis use disorder among
veterans (27) and adults in the general population (28, 29).
Cannabis-related emergency room visits and fatal car crashes
have also increased (11, 14).
Earlier studies conducted when cannabis use was less
prevalent (and therefore more deviant) showed a high degree
of comorbidity between cannabis use disorders and other
common mental disorders (17, 30–33). However, the increased
prevalence of adult cannabis use disorders may now include
more individuals without vulnerability to other psychiatric
disorders. If so, comorbidity patterns may have changed; thus,
the increased prevalence of cannabis use disorder creates a
need for updated information on its comorbidity.
Additionally, all knowledge regarding the U.S. prevalence
of cannabis use disorders and their demographic and clinical
correlates is based on DSM-IV definitions (17, 29, 30). In

ARTICLES
 DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria for cannabis use disorder were
revised (34) to combine dependence and abuse criteria into a
single disorder (35), drop the legal problems criterion, and
add craving, withdrawal, and a severity metric (mild, mod-
erate, severe) (35). Therefore, new information on DSM-5
cannabis use disorder is needed.
To our knowledge, this report provides the first nationally
representative information on DSM-5 cannabis use disorder
using data from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism (NIAAA) 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions–III (NESARC-III).
This includes current and lifetime prevalences, age at onset,
frequency of cannabis use among people with the diagnosis,
demographic correlates, psychiatric comorbidity, disability,
and likelihood of participation in interventions including
professional treatment and 12-step programs.
METHOD
Sample
The NESARC-III target population was the noninstitu-
tionalized civilian population age $18 years in households and
selected group quarters (36, 37). Respondents were selected
through multistage probability sampling, including primary
sampling units (counties/groups of contiguous counties),
secondary sampling units (groups of census-defined blocks),
and tertiary sampling units (households within secondary
sampling units from which respondents were selected, with
blacks, Asians, and Hispanics oversampled). Data were col-
lected from April 2012 to June 2013 and were analyzed in
May and June 2015. Data were adjusted for nonresponse and
weighted to represent the U.S. population based on the 2012
American Community Survey (38). These weighting adjust-
ments compensated adequately for nonresponse (37). The
totalsamplesizewas36,309:thehouseholdresponseratewas
72%, the person-level response rate was 84%, and the overall
response rate was 60.1%, comparable to the rates in other
current U.S. national surveys (39, 40). NESARC-III sample
characteristics are presented elsewhere (37). Informed consent
was electronically recorded; respondents received $90.00
for participation. Institutional review boards at the National
Institutes of Health and Westat (NESARC-III contractor)
approved the study protocol.
Assessments
The NIAAA Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities
Interview Schedule–5 (AUDADIS-5) (41) was the diagnostic
interview. AUDADIS-5 measures drug and alcohol use (e.g.,
onset, frequency), DSM-5 drug, alcohol, and nicotine use
disorders, and selected psychiatric disorders in the last 12
months and prior to the last 12 months. The DSM-5 cannabis
use disorderdiagnosisrequiresat leasttwo of11criteriawithin
a 12-month period. Twelve-month and prior diagnoses were
aggregatedtoformlifetimediagnoses.ConsistentwithDSM-5,
cases of cannabis use disorder were classified as mild (2 or 3
criteria), moderate (4 or 5 criteria), or severe ($6 criteria).
The test-retest reliability of 12-month and lifetime can-
nabis use was substantial (kappa=0.78, 0.77, respectively) in a
general population sample (42). The test-retest reliabilities
of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder (kappa=0.41, 0.41) and its
dimensional criteria scales (intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients [ICC]=0.70, 0.71) were fair to substantial in a general
population sample (N=1,006) (43). Procedural validity was
assessed through blind clinician reappraisal using the semi-
structured, clinician-administered Psychiatric Research In-
terview for Substance and Mental Disorders, DSM-5 version
(PRISM-5)(44)inaseparategeneralpopulationsample(N=712).
ConcordancebetweenAUDADIS-5andPRISM-5wasmoderate
for cannabis use disorder (kappa=0.60, 0.51) and substantial for
its dimensional criteria scale (ICC=0.79, 0.78) (45).
Other Psychiatric Disorders
DSM-5 alcohol, nicotine, and drug disorder diagnoses were
derived in a manner similar to that for cannabis disorder
diagnoses. Test-retest reliabilities were moderate to sub-
stantial for these disorders (kappa=0.40–0.87) and their
criteria scales (ICC=0.45–0.84) (43). Concordance between
AUDADIS-5 and PRISM-5 for alcohol, nicotine, and drug
disorders and corresponding criteria scales was fair to sub-
stantial (kappa=0.36–0.66; ICC=0.68–0.91) (45).
DSM-5 mooddisorders includedprimarymajor depression,
dysthymia, and bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Anxiety dis-
orders included panic, agoraphobia, social and specific phobias,
and generalized anxiety. Consistent with DSM-5, primary
mood and anxiety diagnoses excluded substance-induced
and medically induced disorders. Posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD) and schizotypal, borderline, and antisocial
personality disorders were also assessed. The reliability and
validity of these diagnoses were fair to moderate (43, 46).
Disability/Impairment
Current disability was measured by using the 12-item Short-
Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-12v2), a widely used survey
measure (47). The SF-12v2 scales included mental health,
social functioning, role–emotional functioning, and mental
component summary. Each SF-12v2 norm-based disability
score has a mean of50, standard deviation of 610, andrange of
0–100; lower scores indicate greater disability.
Service Utilization
Utilization of services for problems with cannabis among
individuals with cannabis use disorder was assessed for 14
modalities, including professional inpatient and outpatient
treatment settings and peer support, e.g., 12-step programs
such as Alcoholics Anonymous.
Statistical Analyses
Weighted means and percentages were computed for con-
tinuous and categorical correlates of 12-month and lifetime
cannabis use disorder, overall and by severity level. Odds ratios
from multivariable logistic regressions indicated associations
between cannabis use disorder and each sociodemographic

RESULTS
Prevalence, Onset, and
Frequency of Use
Table 1 shows the preva-
lences and standard errors
of 12-month and lifetime
DSM-5 cannabis use disorder
for the entire sample and by
sociodemographic character-
istics. In addition, Figure 1
summarizes 12-month prev-
alence for the entire sample
and by sex and age. As shown
in Table 1, the prevalences of
12-monthand lifetime DSM-5
cannabis use disorder were
2.54% and 6.27%, respectively.
The 12-month and lifetime
prevalences of mild, moder-
ate, and severe cannabis use
disorder were 1.38%, 0.59%,
and 0.57% and 2.85%, 1.42%,
and 2.00%, respectively.
The mean age at onset of
cannabis use disorder was 21.7
(SE=0.23) years; the mean
ages at onset of mild, mod-
erate, and severe disorders
were 23.1 (SE=0.38), 21.2
(SE=0.44), and 20.1 (SE=0.34)
years.
Among participants with
12-month cannabis use dis-
order, the mean number of
days cannabis was used in the
prior 12 months was 225.3
(SE=5.69); among those with
mild, moderate, and severe
12-month disorder, the mean
daysofusewere206.5(SE=7.79),

CANNABIS USE DISORDER
 243.5 (SE=10.60), and 252.2
(SE=14.03). Among those with
lifetime cannabis use disorder,
the mean number of days can-
nabis was used per year during
the period of heaviest use was
274.2 (SE=3.76); among those
with mild, moderate, and se-
vere lifetime disorder, the
mean days of use were 243.7
(SE=5.98),284.2(SE=6.36),and
310.4 (SE=4.48), respectively.
Sociodemographic
Characteristics
Table 2 shows the adjusted
odds ratios of DSM-5 cannabis
use disorder by sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. Men
had higher odds of cannabis
usedisorder than women,across
timeframes and severity levels
(OR=1.8–2.8).
Relative to the rates for
whites, the 12-month odds of
cannabis use disorder were higher in Native Americans and
blacks but lower in Asians/Pacific Islanders and His-
panics. By severity, the 12-month odds were higher in blacks
than whites at moderate and severe levels (OR=1.7–2.0) and
lower in Asians/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics at low se-
verity. Blacks did not differ from whites on odds of lifetime
cannabis use disorder, but Asians/Pacific Islanders and
Hispanics had lower odds than whites overall and across
severity levels (OR=0.3–0.5).
Relative to the rates for respondents age $45, the odds for
12-month cannabis use disorder were substantially higher in
those ages 18–29 (OR=7.2) and 30–44 (OR=3.6) overall and
across severity levels. For lifetime disorder, the odds were
also significantly higher in those 18–29 and 30–44 than in
those $45 (OR=1.9–3.6).
Compared with married respondents, those who were
never married had higher odds for 12-month cannabis use
disorder, overall and across severity levels (OR=1.5–2.3);
those previously married had higher odds than married re-
spondents but only at the mild severity level. Marital statuses
andlifetimecannabisusedisorderwereweaklyornotrelated.
Education was largely unrelated to cannabis use disorder.
However, compared with respondents at the highest income
level, those with the lowest incomes had greater odds of
12-month and lifetime disorders, overall and across severity
levels (OR=1.6–3.7). Comparing the odds for intermediate
relative to highest income levels produced weaker and less
consistent results.
Respondents in urban and rural areas did not differ. How-
ever, compared with those in the West, those in the Midwest
or the South had significantly lower odds of 12-month and
lifetime cannabis use disorders (OR=0.5–0.8). These regional
differences were most consistent at the low severity level.
Comorbidity

ated with other substance disorders (OR=6.0–9.3), mood

CANNABIS USE DISORDER
 disorders (OR=2.7–5.0), anxiety disorders (OR=1.7–3.7),
PTSD (OR=4.3), and personality disorders (OR=3.8–5.0).
Lifetime cannabis use disorder (Table 3) was also associated
with other substance disorders (OR=6.6–14.5), mood disor-
ders (OR=2.6–3.8), anxiety disorders (OR=2.1–3.2), PTSD
(OR=3.8), and personality disorders (OR=4.0–4.7). Across
severity levels, 12-month and lifetime cannabis use disorders
were associated with other disorders. Further, with few
exceptions (12-month bipolar II, agoraphobia, and specific
phobia), the associations became stronger (i.e., had pro-
gressively higher odds ratios) as the severity of cannabis use
disorder increased. For example, the odds ratios for PTSD
and 12-month mild, moderate, and severe cannabis use dis-
order were 2.1, 6.2, and 9.5; those for nicotine use disorder
were 4.8, 7.3, and 10.5; and those for borderline personality
disorder were 4.0, 4.9, and 8.8. Table S1 in the data supple-
mentaccompanyingtheonlineversionofthisarticleprovides
additional comorbidity information, i.e., 12-month and lifetime
prevalences of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder (any, mild, mod-
erate, severe) among participants with 12-month or lifetime
diagnosesofeachdisorderinTable3.Cannabisusedisorderhad
higher prevalences among participants with other disorders
thaninthetotalsample.Forany12-monthandlifetimecannabis
use disorder, the prevalence ranged from 4.0% and 10.7%
(specific phobia) to 22.5% and 34.9% (any drug use disorder).
Disability
Respondents with 12-month cannabis use disorder differed
significantly from others (p,0.001) on all disability com-
ponents (Table 4), with disability increasing significantly as
cannabis disorder severity increased. For those with severe
levels, the mean score on the mental component summary of
the SF-12v2 was approximately 0.75 SD below the mean. The
greatest impairment was found in the role–emotional func-
tioning domain, with a score 0.85 SD below the mean. By the
exact number of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder criteria, in-
creasing disorder severity was also generally associated with
greater disability (lower SF-12 scores).
Service Utilization
Among respondents with 12-month and lifetime DSM-5
cannabis use disorders, 7.2% and 13.7% received any type of
service for cannabis problems (Table 5). For 12-month dis-
order, service utilization rates were 4.1%, 6.0%, and 15.7% for
mild, moderate, and severe disorders; lifetime rates were 7.3%,
11.7%,and24.3%.Bytypeorsourceofintervention,individuals
with 12-month cannabis use disorder were most likely to use
physicians or other health care practitioners (4.8%), followed
by 12-step groups (3.2%) and rehabilitation programs, out-
patient clinics, inpatient facilities, detoxification programs,
and family or social services (range, 0.9%21.5%). Other set-
tings were utilized less. Individuals with lifetime cannabis use
disorder were most likely to use 12-step groups (8.0%), fol-
lowed by physicians or other health care practitioners (5.2%)
and rehabilitation programs, outpatient clinics, detoxification
programs, family or social services, and inpatient facilities
(range, 1.6%25.0%). Other settings were used less. Across
cannabis disorder severity levels, the most to least commonly
used intervention sources were ordered similarly.
DISCUSSION
Among U.S. adults in 2012–2013, the 12-month prevalence
of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder was 2.54%, representing

 approximately 5,982,000 Americans, and the lifetime preva-
lence was 6.27%, representing about 14,757,000 Americans.
Corresponding DSM-IV 12-month and lifetime rates in
NESARC-III, 2.9% and 11.7% (29), showed that a substantial
increase occurred since the 2001–2002 NESARC, in which the
12-monthandlifetimerateswere1.5%and8.5%(29),anincrease
apparently driven by greater prevalence of cannabis users (29).
The prevalence and odds of 12-month and lifetime can-
nabis use disorders were greater among men than women,
consistent with findings in earlier surveys (17, 49, 50).
In NESARC-III, the odds for 12-month cannabis use
disorder were higher among younger than older age groups,
with striking differences between those age 18–29 and those
$45 (OR=6.5–9.7). While the prevalence of cannabis use
disorder increased across all age groups between the
2001–2002 NESARC and the 2012–2013 NESARC-III,
the age differential in DSM-5 cannabis use disorder in
NESARC-III is considerably more pronounced than in the
NESARC (17). The general increases suggest the operation of
a period effect, while the sharply increased age differential

CANNABIS USE DISORDER
 suggests an additional cohort effect in the youngest adults.
The general increase plus the sharp age differential in
NESARC-III for DSM-5 cannabis use disorder are consistent
with similar time trends among people favoring legalization
of marijuana for recreational use (51). These trends all appear
to reflect different manifestations of the increasingly
accepting social attitudes toward marijuana use.
The odds of cannabis use disorder varied by race or ethnic
group. For 12-month and lifetime disorders, odds were lower
for Asians or Pacific Islanders and for Hispanics than for
whites, but higher in Native Americans, consistent with the
NESARC data (17). For blacks, the odds of 12-month cannabis
use disorder were significantly higher than for whites, in
contrasttofindingsinNESARC,inwhichblacksdidnotdiffer
from whites. For lifetime cannabis use disorder, the odds did
notdifferbetweenblacksandwhitesinNESARC-III,whilein
NESARC, blacks had significantly lower odds of lifetime
cannabis use disorder than whites (17). Thus, the risk in
blacks relative to whites has increased over the past decade.
This is consistent with notable increases in the prevalence
of cannabis use and cannabis use disorders among blacks
(29, 52–54). While the reasons for this change are unclear,
increasing economic disparity between blacks and whites
since the 2008 economic recession (55, 56) may have exacer-
bated neighborhood factors (disorder, violence, visible drug
dealing) that increase adolescent marijuana use (57), and
they may function similarly in adults, an issue warranting
investigation. Blacks may also differ from whites in their
attitudes toward marijuana, possibly viewing it as a natural
and therefore safe substance (22). This also warrants
investigation.
Participants with the lowest incomes had higher odds of
cannabis use disorder than others. Cannabis outcomes are
related to income disparities in distal and proximal forms,
including early exposure to disadvantaged macroeconomic
environments (58), low parental socioeconomic status as
a moderator of the risk of family history of addiction (59),
and current residence in high-unemployment neighborhoods
(60). Cannabis disorders and concurrent economic disparity
may be related if the stress of disadvantaged economic
conditions leads to marijuana use as a coping mechanism,
increasing the risk for cannabis use disorders among users
with a vulnerability to such disorders. However, the re-
lationship may be bidirectional, since early adolescent use of
marijuana is associated with subsequent lower adult cogni-
tivefunctioning(3–5),whichcouldimpairthechancesforthe
educational and occupational achievement (6–8) that would
bring higher incomes. This important yet complex re-
lationship merits further study to inform policy and personal
decisions regarding marijuana use.
Similar to the NESARC findings (17), 12-month and life-
time cannabis use disorders were strongly and consistently
associated with other substance and mental disorders. Thus,
despite the increasingly normative nature of marijuana use
and the increased adult prevalence of cannabis use disorder,
persons with cannabis use disorder continue to be vulnerable

 to other common mental disorders. In patient settings, those
with both drug and psychiatric disorders often exhibit more
persistent, severe, and treatment-resistant symptoms than
patients with drug disorders only (61). Research indicates
that the best treatment for such comorbid conditions is
concurrent treatment for both disorders (61). Therefore,
study findings indicate an increased need for settings that
provide evidence-based treatments for both types of condi-
tions. Further, multivariable investigation indicates two
latent transdiagnostic domains of comorbidity, the in-
ternalizing and externalizing (62) domains. The exter-
nalizing domain is characterized by antisocial personality
disorder and substance disorders; the internalizing domain
is characterized by distress (major depression, dysthymia,
generalized anxiety) or fear (panic, social phobia, specific
phobia). These domains have been replicated across gender
and racial/ethnic groups (63, 64). Given the changing legal and
attitudinal climate in the United States regarding marijuana
use, re-examining cannabis use disorders within this
transdiagnostic framework
is warranted to better un-
derstand its relationship to
other substance and psychi-
atric disorders, and to inform
the development of more ef-
fective treatments.
Participants with canna-
bis use disorder experienced
considerable disabilityacross
differentdomains.Thelevelof
disability, particularly among
those with severe disorders,
was consistent with the very
frequent cannabis use re-
ported (252.2 and 310.4 days
per year among those with
12-month and lifetime severe
cannabis use disorders).
These disability and use
patterns attest to the severity
of the disorder, which clearly
is not a benign or harmless
condition. Further, the dis-
ability levels were greater
than the corresponding lev-
els associated with alcohol
use disorder in NESARC-III
(37). Previous research sug-
gests that even after cannabis
usedisordersremit,disability
persists (65). Whether this
persistence is mediated by
prolonged cognitive impair-
ments associated with early
marijuana use (3–5), by as-
pects of the disorder itself
(e.g., particular diagnostic criteria), or by other factors
warrants investigation.
Relatively few participants with cannabis use disorder re-
ceived any type of services, a situation unimproved since
NESARC(17).Foralcoholusedisorders,factorspredictinglack
of service use include viewing alcohol problems as stigmatized
(66) or not serious (67), preference for self-reliance, andbeliefs
that treatment is ineffective (67). Similar factors appear related
to lack of service use for cannabis disorders (30, 68), a topic
warranting further investigation. Evidence-based treatments
(69–71)areavailableforcannabis usedisorders (32).Publicand
professional education about treatment efficacy and availability
that destigmatizes help seeking may encourage individuals
with cannabis use disorders to seek treatment. Given the
increased prevalence of these disorders among U.S. adults
(27,29),provisionofsuchservicesandpubliceducationabout
treatment appear critically needed.
TheDSM-5diagnosisofcannabisusedisorderdiffersfrom
that in DSM-IV by the addition of criteria for craving and

CANNABIS USE DISORDER
 cannabis withdrawal. Among participants with 12-month
DSM-5 cannabis use disorder, 60.50% (SE=2.05) had craving
forcannabis,32.48%(SE=2.09)hadcannabiswithdrawal,and
23.06% (SE=1.84) had both. In NESARC-III, the prevalence
of moderate to severe DSM-5 cannabis use disorder was
higher than the rate for DSM-IV cannabis dependence, a
difference attributed to the cannabis withdrawal criterion
(72). Earlier studies showed how the craving and cannabis
withdrawal criteria operate in the general population (35, 73,
74); for instance, the model fit of cannabis use disorder cri-
teria improved after addition of withdrawal (75). While
studies of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder in NESARC-III show
good reliability and validity (43, 45), further nosological studies
focused on craving and withdrawal should be conducted with
the NESARC-III data.
NESARC-III findings of increased rates of cannabis use
disorder (29) are inconsistent with the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health, which found that the prevalence of
cannabis use disorder was stable between 2002 and 2013 (7).
However, the NESARC-III findings are consistent with other
national indicators of increases in cannabis use disorders (27)
and other serious cannabis-related problems, e.g., emergency
room visits and fatal car crashes (11, 14). These increases are
consistent with a changing landscape of increasingly per-
missive marijuana attitudes and laws. Changing laws may
benefit society by reducing the harms of socially patterned
drug arrests (76). However, the laws may affect public health
adversely by leading to more marijuana users, including some
vulnerable to cannabis use disorders. Continued surveillance
ofthesetrendsisneededtomonitorthebalanceofsocialcosts
and benefits and the needs for treatment.
Lifetime rates of DSM-5 cannabis use disorder were
highest in those ages 18–29. This could be artifactual due to
recall failure for earlier disorders among older individuals
(77). However, this report and others (17) show that the risk
for onset of cannabis use disorder peaks in late adolescence
and early 20s, and remission often occurs within 3–4 years
(17, 78). Given that, the finding of higher rates of lifetime
disorders among those ages 18–29 may well be valid. Further
studies are needed to address this issue.
Study limitations are noted. Only common psychiatric
disorders were assessed. Some population segments were not
included, e.g., prisoners, the homeless, and long-term inpa-
tients. NESARC-III was also cross-sectional. Prospective
surveys are needed to investigate the stability and causal di-
rections of the relationships. The study also did not distinguish
between associations explained by greater use of cannabis and
those due to greater risk of a disorder given such use; future
studies should address this issue. NESARC-III also had im-
portant strengths, including a large sample, reliable and valid
measures,and rigorous field methodology. NESARC-IIIisalso
unique in providing current, comprehensive information on
DSM-5 cannabis use disorder and its correlates and comor-
bidity in the U.S. adult general population.
In summary, DSM-5 cannabis use disorder is a highly
prevalent, comorbid, disabling disorder that commonly goes
untreated. Numerous risk factors were identified that could
stimulate further studies of differences in correlates of DSM-5
cannabis use disorder by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, which
could inform additional hypothesis-driven studies. Most
important, this study highlights the urgency of identifying
and implementing effective prevention methods. The study
also highlights the need to educate the public, professionals,
and policy makers about the seriousness of cannabis use
