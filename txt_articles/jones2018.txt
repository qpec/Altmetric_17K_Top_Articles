IMPORTANCE Handing over the care of a patient from one anesthesiologist to another occurs
during some surgeries and might increase the risk of adverse outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether complete handover of intraoperative anesthesia care is
associated with higher likelihood of mortality or major complications compared with no
handover of care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective population-based cohort study
(April 1, 2009-March 31, 2015 set in the Canadian province of Ontario) of adult patients aged
18 years and older undergoing major surgeries expected to last at least 2 hours and requiring
a hospital stay of at least 1 night.
EXPOSURE Complete intraoperative handover of anesthesia care from one physician
anesthesiologist to another compared with no handover of anesthesia care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death,
hospital readmission, or major postoperative complications, all within 30 postoperative days.
Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome. Inverse
probability of exposure weighting based on the propensity score was used to estimate
adjusted exposure effects.
RESULTS Of the 313 066 patients in the cohort, 56% were women; the mean (SD) age was 60
(16) years; 49% of surgeries were performed in academic centers; 72% of surgeries were
elective; and the median duration of surgery was 182 minutes (interquartile [IQR] range,
124-255). A total of 5941 (1.9%) patients underwent surgery with complete handover of
anesthesia care. The percentage of patients undergoing surgery with a handover of
anesthesiology care progressively increased each year of the study, reaching 2.9% in 2015.
In the unweighted sample, the primary outcome occurred in 44% of the complete handover
group compared with 29% of the no handover group. After adjustment, complete handovers
were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of the primary outcome
(adjusted risk difference [aRD], 6.8% [95% CI, 4.5% to 9.1%]; P < .001), all-cause death
(aRD, 1.2% [95% CI, 0.5% to 2%]; P = .002), and major complications (aRD, 5.8% [95% CI,
3.6% to 7.9%]; P < .001), but not with hospital readmission within 30 days of surgery
(aRD, 1.2% [95% CI, −0.3% to 2.7%]; P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults undergoing major surgery, complete handover
of intraoperative anesthesia care compared with no handover was associated with a higher
risk of adverse postoperative outcomes. These findings may support limiting complete
anesthesia handovers.

andovers of anesthesia care from one anesthesiolo-
gist to another can occur intraoperatively due to per-
sonal or professional commitments, illness, or fa-
tigue.Handoverscanbetemporary(initialclinicianhandsover
care to another clinician for a break and then returns) or com-
plete (initial clinician hands over care completely to another
clinician and is no longer available).
During handovers, the outgoing clinician must commu-
nicate important facts about the patient and the surgery to the
incoming clinician while continuing to provide patient care.
This is a potentially vulnerable time for the patient because
all information required for safe anesthesia care must be trans-
ferred between clinicians in a busy environment with many
distractions. If crucial details are omitted, the patient may be
at increased risk of adverse events. Alternatively, a suffi-
ciently rested clinician taking over for a fatigued clinician may
improve quality of care and result in fewer adverse events.
Uncertainty regarding the effect of intraoperative anes-
thesia handovers on mortality and major morbidity contin-
ues to exist. The hypothesis of this large, population-based,
multicenter observational study was that the complete intra-
operative handover of anesthesia care from one anesthesi-
ologist to another was not associated with higher mortality or
major complications up to 30 days postoperatively, relative
to the standard case of anesthesia care.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Data Sources
This population-based, retrospective cohort study used ad-
ministrative health care data from the Canadian province of
Ontario and followed the STROBE (strengthening the report-
ing of observational studies in epidemiology)1 and RECORD
(reporting of studies conducted using observational rou-
tinely collected health data)2 reporting guidelines. All resi-
dents of Ontario (approximately 14 million) obtain health care
services from a government-administered single-payer sys-
tem.Aunique,encodedidentifierpermittedlinkageacrosssev-
eral administrative databases, which were then analyzed at the
Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Data were ob-
tained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information’
s
Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD; in-hospital out-
comes), the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System
(CIHI-NACRS; emergency department [ED] visits), the Same
Day Surgery Database (CIHI-SDS), the Ontario Health Insur-
ance Plan (physician billings), the Corporate Provider Data-
base (physician demographic data from Ontario’
s Ministry
of Health and Long-Term Care), and the Registered Persons
Database (patient demographics and vital status). Ethics ap-
proval was granted through the Sunnybrook Health Sciences
CentreResearchEthicsBoard(Toronto,Ontario),whichwaived
the requirement for informed consent from participants.
Participants
Adult patients (≥18 years) were identified who underwent
major surgeries expected to have duration of at least 2 hours
and require postoperative admission to hospital for at least
1 night between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2015. Major sur-
geries were targeted within the broad subgroup domains of
neurosurgery; cardiac; vascular; thoracic; and abdominal,
pelvic, and urologic surgery, as identified by surgeon experts
using Canadian Classification of Health Intervention (CCI)
codes (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Patients having multiple surgeries within the accrual pe-
riod were only included in the cohort for their first eligible sur-
gery. Patients who had surgery within the same surgical sub-
group within the previous year were excluded to reduce the
probability of complicated surgeries requiring revision or reop-
eration soon after initial operations (patients were still in-
cluded if they had surgeries within another surgical subgroup
atanytimeorwithinthesamesubgroupifmorethan1yearhad
passed after the previous surgery). In addition, after examin-
ing the initial cohort, it was discovered that one Ontario insti-
tution systematically billed the code used to define the main
exposure in this study for an alternative purpose—specifically,
the postoperative care of patients requiring complicated care
in the postanesthetic care unit. Because it could not be posi-
tivelydeterminedwhichexposureswereintraoperativevspost-
operative, all patients who had surgery at this institution were
excluded (Figure 1).
Exposure of Interest
The exposure of interest in this study was the complete intra-
operative handover of anesthesia care from one physician an-
esthesiologist (the primary anesthesiologist) to another physi-
cian anesthesiologist (the replacement anesthesiologist).
In Ontario, this transition is specifically captured by a unique
billing code (E005C). This code is submitted by the replace-
ment anesthesiologist and identifies a surgery in which a re-
placement anesthesiologist entirely took over a case from the
primary anesthesiologist. This billing code was expected to be
accurate since it is the only mechanism used to remunerate the
replacement anesthesiologist. Patients were considered to be
exposed to a complete handover if the code was billed on the
dayofsurgeryorthedayaftersurgery(toaccountforhandovers
occurring after midnight).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite3 of all-cause death, re-
admission to any hospital in the province, or major postop-
erative complications, all within 30 days of the index surgery.
Key Points
Question Is there an association between complete
intraoperative handover of anesthesia care and adverse
postoperative outcomes?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study that included 313 066
adults undergoing major surgery, complete intraoperative
handover of anesthesia care compared with no handover was
significantly associated with a higher risk of a composite of
all-cause death, hospital readmission, or major postoperative
complications over 30 days (44% vs 29%).
Meaning Complete handover of intraoperative anesthesia care
was associated with adverse postoperative outcomes.

 Secondary outcomes were the 3 separate components of the
primaryoutcome,theincidenceofpostoperativeintensivecare
unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay, and the number
of ED visits in Ontario within 90 days of the index surgery.
Major complications were defined by CCI intervention
codes, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10)diagnosticcodes,andtheOntarioHealthInsurancePlan
physician billings (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Major compli-
cations were only included if they were diagnosed for the first
time postoperatively (ie, atrial fibrillation present before sur-
gery was not counted as a complication). All outcomes were
specified a priori.

Results
Patients
This study included 313 066 patients (307 125 in the no
handover group; 5941 in the complete handover group)
(Figure 1). There were missing data for 2 variables: 51 670
(16.5%) patients were missing data on years since medical
school graduation for the primary anesthesiologist, and 5052
(1.6%) patients were missing data on the duration of surgery
(Figure 1). The total number of complete handovers for all sur-
geries (ie, not just the surgeries meeting inclusion criteria for
this cohort study) in Ontario from 2004 until 2015 increased
every year as did the yearly percentage of patients in this co-
hort whose surgery had a complete handover during the study
period (eFigure in the Supplement). Important baseline dif-
ferences between the no handover and complete handover
groups were noted on several characteristics (Table 1).
Unadjusted Main Outcomes
The primary outcome (all-cause death, hospital readmission,
or major complication within 30 days of the index surgery) oc-
curred in 90 306 (29%) of the no handover group and in 2583
(44%) of the complete handover group (risk difference [RD],
14.1% [95% CI, 12.8% to 15.3%]). Having a complete handover
was associated with worse outcomes for each component of
the primary outcome (Table 2). The mean hospital length
of stay was longer in the complete handover group as was the

bThe inverse probability of exposure-weighted data represent a pseudosample
after weighting and therefore were not directly observed.6 The pseudosample
also explains the apparent fraction of patients seen after weighting.
The sample size for the inverse probability of exposure-weighted cohort
(256 424) differs from the overall cohort due to missing data (Figure 1).
c Standardized differences compare imbalance among variables without being
affected by sample size.7 Standardized differences of less than 10% are
considered by some authors to indicate good balance between groups.7
dThe Charlson Comorbidity Index is a list of 17 comorbidities identified
by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes, each of which
is assigned a weight from 1 to 6 (score of 0 indicates healthy patients
[no comorbidities identified]; higher scores indicate the presence of additional
comorbidities). Comorbidities included a 5-year look-back window.

a Complete case analysis resulted in some missing data in the cohort on 2 variables only: an entire year of missing
data for years since medical school graduation for the primary anesthesiologist (51 670 records [16.5%]) and
missing data for duration of surgery (5052 patients [1.6%]). The results were similar when years since medical
school graduation was excluded from the statistical model (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
bAdjusted results obtained from inverse probability of exposure weighting based on propensity scores.
The propensity score was estimated using multivariable logistic regression with receipt of a handover as the
dependent variable and a vector of covariates decided a priori as the independent variables (sex, age,
comorbidities with a 5-year look-back window [hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, chronic liver disease, cancer,
chronic renal disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], duration of the surgery [in deciles], years
since medical school graduation for the primary anesthesiologist, region of the province, type of hospital
[academic or not], whether the surgery was elective or urgent/emergent, and the type of surgery performed).
c RDs and RRs are for the complete handover group relative to the no handover group. For example, the RD for
the primary outcome of 6.8% indicates that the complete handover group had a 6.8% absolute increase of
all-cause death, hospital readmission, or complication within 30 days compared with the no handover group
(or [equivalently], for every 15 patients exposed to a complete handover, 1 additional patient would be expected
to experience the primary outcome). Potential outcome means reflect the outcomes in the inverse probability
of exposure-weighted pseudosample (ie, postadjustment) and therefore were not directly observed outcomes.6
dRRs are calculated for binary outcomes.
e Outcomes for the 3 components of the composite primary outcome (all-cause death, readmission, or major
complication, all within 30 days) were not mutually exclusive. Therefore the sum of the events in the
components is greater than the composite event rate. Diagnostic and intervention codes used to define
outcomes are specified in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
f Values indicate number of days for hospital length of stay and No. of ED visits (not percents as displayed with
other values in the same column).
g Indicates ED visits within Ontario.

 mean number of ED visits within 90 days of the index sur-
gery, postoperative admissions to an ICU, and the proportion
of the study cohort with any ED visit (Table 2).
Adjusted Main Outcomes
After adjustment, a complete handover of anesthesia care re-
mained statistically significantly associated with an increased
incidence of the primary outcome (Table 2; adjusted risk dif-
ference [aRD], 6.8% [95% CI, 4.5% to 9.1%]) and an increase in
all-cause death and major complications within 30 days of the
indexsurgerybutnotwithhospitalreadmissions.Themeanhos-
pital length of stay was longer in the complete handover group,
as was the incidence of postoperative ICU admission (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
Across multiple sensitivity analyses, similar point estimates
and 95% CIs were found, including when the variable with the
most missing data was excluded from the statistical models
(allowing for analysis of 308 014 patients), when multiple im-
putation was performed (allowing for analysis of 313 066 pa-
tients), and when age and/or duration of surgery were incor-
porated into the analysis as polynomial variables (eTable 4 and
eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Secondary Outcomes
After adjustment in exploratory analyses, complete handover
was statistically significantly associated with a higher inci-
dence of postoperative ventilation for 48 hours or more, a ma-
jor disruption of the surgical wound, bleeding, pneumonia,
an unplanned return to the operating room, and new-onset
hemodialysis (Table 3).
Subgroup Analyses
In subgroup analyses, heterogeneity was observed in the sub-
group of year of surgery for the hospital readmission and ma-
jor complication outcomes, for the subgroup of type of sur-
gery for the primary outcome, and for the all-cause death and
majorcomplicationoutcomes.Nostatisticallysignificanthetero-
geneity was observed between elective or urgent/emergent
surgeries (Figure 2; and eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this large population-based study, a clinically important and
statistically significant detrimental association between the
completehandoverofanesthesiacareduringmajorsurgeryand
adverse postoperative outcomes was found. On average, for
every 15 patients exposed to a complete anesthesia handover,
1 additional patient would be expected to experience the pri-
mary outcome. Intraoperative handovers were also associ-
ated with an increase in ICU admissions and longer hospital
lengths of stay.
In Ontario, the absolute number of complete handovers
is increasing year-by-year. Knowing that fatigue exacerbates
many human limitations,9 some departments have imple-
mented policies of restricted duty hours for medical staff,
residents, or both.10 It is likely that these policies have some

difference of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3 to 1.3%) for new-onset hemodialysis indicates that after adjustment, the

the no handover group.

 effect on the increase in the volume of handovers (since the
policies may require anesthesiologists to hand over the care
of more partially completed surgeries to colleagues when their
working hours end).
Previous studies were from single institutions and in-
cludedpatientsundergoingeithernarrow11,12orbroad13,14ranges
of surgeries. Three studies11-13 had CIs for the primary out-
come that were consistent with a significant association be-
tween handovers and harm, the largest of which13 found that
each anesthesia care transition was associated with increased
oddsofin-hospitalmortalityandmajorcomplications(oddsra-
tio 1.08 for each transition [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.10]). The fourth
study14 was compatible with the others since its 95% CI for the
odds of the primary outcome (0.90 to 1.02), while not statisti-
cally significant, included a potentially clinically important ef-
fect. Most studies were conducted in the United States, where
anesthesia care involves certified registered nurse anesthe-
tists, physicians, or both. This differs from some other coun-
triesincludingCanada,15wherephysicianstypicallycareforone
patient directly.
The congruity of these results with the majority of the pre-
vious research suggests that anesthesia handovers during ma-
jor surgeries are associated with unintended harmful conse-
quences. If the percentage of handovers observed in the final
yearofthisstudycohort(2.9%)werereflectedworldwide,more
than 9 million patients per year would potentially undergo sur-
gery with a complete anesthesia handover.16 Given the large
number of patients and the increase in adverse outcomes ob-
served in this study, the public health implications of its find-
ings are concerning. The most prudent approach at the current
time may therefore be to invoke the precautionary principle17
and minimize unnecessary anesthesia handovers until future
research has demonstrated that these harmful associations
havebeenattenuated.However,determiningwhichhandovers
are unnecessary remains a significant challenge. For example,
since fatigue will, at some point, have a measureable and det-
rimental effect on clinicians,9 handovers performed for rea-
sons of fatigue may be reasonable. Determining when the risk
of a fatigued clinician exceeds the potential risk of a complete
handover is an important subject for future research.
It is possible that an improved system of anesthesia
handovers(inwhichcriticalcomponentsofhandoversareman-
dated by a checklist) would eliminate the signal of harm while
maintaining lifestyle benefits for clinicians. Although attempts
to improve the quality of handovers are common and invoke
manydifferingtheoreticalframeworks(eg,informationprocess-
ing, stereotypical narratives, distributed cognition), no unified
approach has been identified.18 The potential for important in-
tangible information loss during handover remains a latent
threat.Attemptingtodemonstrateimprovedoutcomeswiththe
use of handover tools is an important area of research.
Subgroup analyses demonstrated statistical evidence of
heterogeneityforsomeoftheoutcomes,particularlyforthetype
ofsurgeryperformed.However,themajorityofpointestimates
indicateanassociationbetweenhandoversandboththeprimary
and all-cause death outcomes. Although the absolute risks of
these outcomes may differ among surgery types, these results
indicate consistent findings of harm among most subgroups.
A strength of this study is its large sample of patients rep-
resenting a wide variety of surgeries at many hospitals. This
is important since the majority of previous studies excluded
importantpatientpopulations(oftencardiacsurgery)andwere
conducted at single centers. Many outcome events occurred,
increasing the statistical power to detect important differ-
ences. Because this was a population-based study based in the
largestCanadianprovince,patientsinthiscohortarelikelyrep-
resentative of other Canadians in terms of sex, age, socioeco-
nomic groups, comorbidity distributions, and other impor-
tant prognostic factors. Unlike other countries where there are
distinct regional differences in anesthesia practice (eg, the use
of nurse anesthetists), this cohort involved only physician an-
esthesiologists. This allowed the research to focus more di-
rectly on the issue of handovers rather than on the types of cli-
nicians involved.
This study has several limitations. Because the exposure
of complete handover was determined using a billing code,
there is a risk of misclassification if the code was used improp-
erly. ICD-10 diagnostic codes may not have captured all ad-
verse postoperative outcomes. The primary anesthesiolo-
gist’
s career experience was controlled for, but the career
experience of the replacement anesthesiologist and the sur-
geon was not. It was not possible to determine the precise time
ofhandoverbecausethisinformationwasnotcapturedbyphy-
sician billings, which limited the ability to investigate the ef-
fect of the handover’
s time of day on outcomes. Cases in which
a primary anesthesiologist had the assistance of a second an-
esthesiologist or took breaks during an operation and then re-
turned to the operating room were not identified; nor was the
presence of anesthesia trainees during the surgeries.
Conclusions
Among adults undergoing major surgery, complete handover
of intraoperative anesthesia care compared with no handover
was associated with a higher risk of adverse postoperative out-
comes. These findings may support limiting complete anes-
thesia handovers.
