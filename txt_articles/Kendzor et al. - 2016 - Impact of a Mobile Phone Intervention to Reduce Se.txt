Abstract
Background: Greater time spent sedentary is linked with increased risk of breast, colorectal, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate
cancers. Given steadily increasing rates of mobile phone ownership, mobile phone interventions may have the potential to broadly
influence sedentary behavior across settings.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the short-term impact of a mobile phone intervention that targeted sedentary
time in a diverse community sample.
Methods: Adults participated in a quasi-experimental evaluation of a mobile phone intervention designed to reduce sedentary
time through prompts to interrupt periods of sitting. Participants carried mobile phones and wore accelerometers for 7 consecutive
days. Intervention participants additionally received mobile phone prompts during self-reported sitting and information about the
negative health impact of prolonged sedentariness. The study was conducted from December 2012 to November 2013 in Dallas,
Texas. Linear mixed model regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of the intervention on daily
accelerometer-determined estimates of sedentary and active time.
Results: Participants (N=215) were predominantly female (67.9%, 146/215) and nonwhite (black: 50.7%, 109/215; Latino:
12.1%, 26/215; other: 5.6%, 12/215). Analyses revealed that participants who received the mobile phone intervention had
significantly fewer daily minutes of sedentary time (B=–22.09, P=.045) and more daily active minutes (B=23.01, P=.04) than
control participants.

Introduction
Sedentary behavior has been defined as any activity that requires
an energy expenditure no greater than 1.5 metabolic equivalents
(METs) that is performed while sitting or reclining [1].
Exploring the health effects of sedentary behavior, independent
of physical activity, has been a relatively new scientific pursuit,
with a proliferation of studies published in the past decade.
Evidence to date suggests that prolonged sedentary time is
associated with increased risk for a variety of adverse health
outcomes [2-12], including cancers of the breast, colon/rectum,
ovaries, endometrium, and prostate [11-14]. In addition, greater
sedentary time among adults is associated with weight gain,
higher body mass index (BMI), and obesity [15-20], which is
a known risk factor for cancer [21]. Nevertheless, adults in the
United States are excessively sedentary with an average of
approximately 8 hours per day spent sedentary during waking
hours [22]. This high level of sedentary time has been observed
in both men and women and across several racial/ethnic groups
[22]. Emerging research has indicated that inactive-to-active
transitions (henceforth “sedentary breaks”) are linked with lower
waist circumference, BMI, triglycerides, 2-hour glucose levels,
and blood pressure [23-25]. Thus, interventions designed to
reduce total sedentary behavior by interrupting prolonged
sedentary bouts may have a substantial impact on health.
Despite the accumulating evidence supporting the deleterious
health effects of prolonged sedentariness, few interventions
have specifically focused on decreasing and interrupting
sedentary time. Because engaging in habitual physical activity
often requires significant effort and planning, it seems likely
that modifying sedentary behavior through periodic interruptions
during waking hours may be more achievable and sustainable
over time. It is possible that modifying sedentary behavior
represents a less complex behavior change, especially for
inactive individuals [26,27]. Notably, Bond et al [28] recently
reported promising initial findings demonstrating that a mobile
phone intervention was associated with reductions in sedentary
time among overweight/obese adults. The findings of a recent
meta-analysis provide initial evidence that sedentary behavior
interventions significantly reduce sedentary time [29], although
most intervention studies have focused specifically on reducing
occupational sitting time or screen time rather than total daily
sitting time.
Recent research indicates that 64% of US adults owned mobile
phones in 2015 [30], suggesting that mobile phone interventions
have the potential to broadly influence sedentary behavior
among adults across diverse settings. Thus, the purpose of the
current study was to characterize the impact of a mobile
phone-based sedentary behavior intervention that incorporated
education, self-monitoring, and prompting in a community
sample of adults. It was hypothesized that participants who
received mobile phone prompts to decrease sedentary time
would have significantly less sedentary time, more active time,
and more sedentary breaks than those who did not receive
mobile phone prompts over a 7-day period. In addition, it was
anticipated that participants who received prompts to increase
activity would be more acutely active following self-reported
sitting than those who did not receive prompts.
Methods
Participants
A total of 248 adults were recruited from the Dallas metropolitan
area through flyers posted on the University of Texas
Southwestern campus (Dallas, TX), local advertising circulars,
and word of mouth. Individuals were eligible to participate in
the study if they were at least 18 years of age, possessed a valid
home address and a functioning telephone number, and
demonstrated greater than 6th grade English literacy level on
the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM)
[31,32]. Of those screened, 10 were excluded because they were
not able to demonstrate the minimum reading level, leaving a
total study sample of 238 participants. Data collection began in
December 2012 and concluded in November 2013.
Measures
Socioeconomic Status/Demographic Variables
Race/ethnicity, sex, age (in years), and educational attainment
were assessed.
Body Mass Index
Participant’s BMI was calculated based on objective
measurements of height and weight using the standard formula
(kg/m2).
Smoking
Expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels were measured with a
portable Vitalograph ecolyzer, which provided an objective
indicator of current smoking status and level of smoking. CO
levels of ≥8-10 parts per million (ppm) suggest recent cigarette
smoking with a sensitivity and specificity of approximately
90% [33].
Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity
Sedentary time at baseline was based on responses to 2 items
from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
The IPAQ assessed usual time spent sitting on a weekday and
on a weekend day during the past week [34]. Weekday estimates
were multiplied by 5, weekend day estimates were multiplied

 by 2, and the resulting values were summed and divided by 7
to calculate the mean daily time spent sitting during the past
week.
Physical activity and sedentary time were directly assessed
using Actigraph GT3X (Pensacola, FL) triaxial accelerometers.
Accelerometers were initialized via ActiLife6 software to begin
data collection at midnight on the day of the baseline visit.
Participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer on the
waist and in line with their right hip, secured using an elastic
belt during all waking hours for 7 consecutive days. Participants
were asked to remove the accelerometer when sleeping, bathing
or showering, and during all water activities. After the 7-day
data collection period was completed, the monitors were
returned at a second in-person visit and data were downloaded
via ActiLife6 software. Before data reduction and processing,
the downloaded data files were reintegrated and expressed as
60-second epochs. A 60-second epoch was used for consistency
with previous research in nationally representative samples [22].
Research has shown that associations of activity estimates with
key outcomes are not markedly different when shorter or longer
epochs are used [35].
During the data reduction and processing stage, data were
screened for periods of nonwear using established methods
[36,37]. Nonwear periods were removed from further analysis.
Total activity counts per day were calculated using summed
daily counts detected over wear periods. Minutes spent in
sedentary activity, as well as light and moderate lifestyle
intensity activity were estimated using Matthews cut-points for
all days with 10 hours or more per wear time [38]. Specifically,
activity count ranges were 0 to 99 counts per minute for
sedentary activity, 100 to 759 counts per minute for
light-intensity activity, and 760 to 1951 counts per minute for
moderate lifestyle intensity activity. An estimate reflecting total
time spent active was also created using accumulated time ≥100
counts per minute. Sedentary breaks were defined as any period
of sedentary time (ie, <100 counts/minute) that was immediately
followed by a minute or more of active time (≥100 counts) [24]
and sedentary breaks were summed across all waking hours.
Mobile Phone Assessments
All participants were provided with an Android mobile phone
on which they were prompted to complete daily diary
assessments and random assessments of health behavior and
psychosocial variables (as part of a parent study; see Procedure
section) over a 7-day observation period. Participants completed
daily diary assessments once daily, 30 minutes after their
self-reported usual wake time. In addition, participants were
randomly prompted to complete assessments 4 times per day
during self-reported waking hours. Participants were required
to complete mobile phone assessments within 15 minutes,
although they were allowed to postpone assessments by 5
minutes for a total of 3 times. Of relevance to the current
analyses, participants responded to the following daily diary
and random assessment items, respectively: (1) “How many
hours did you spend sitting yesterday?” and (2) “What were
you doing right before your phone rang/vibrated?” Response
options included sitting, talking, standing, walking/exercising,
sleeping/resting, or other.
Procedure
The current study was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center.
The sedentary behavior intervention described here was a post
hoc addition to an observational prospective 7-day study. The
parent study was designed to characterize proximal predictors
of health behavior using mobile phone–based ecological
momentary assessment. Thus, the current study had a
quasi-experimental (nonrandomized) design whereby the first
131 consecutive participants who did not receive the intervention
served as the control group. Control participants completed
mobile phone assessments and wore an accelerometer to
measure sedentary and active time over 7 consecutive days. The
subsequent 107 participants who enrolled in the study
additionally received the sedentary behavior intervention on
the mobile phone. Participant recruitment and group allocation
are depicted in Figure 1.
Potential participants were provided with the details of the study
over the telephone and their interest in participating was
assessed. Interested individuals were briefly screened by phone
for eligibility and those eligible were scheduled to attend the
initial study visit. The details of the study were reviewed at the
first visit and informed consent was obtained from all
participants. Reading level was assessed and participants who
were unable to demonstrate greater than 6th grade reading level
on the REALM were excluded from the study and compensated
for their time with a US $20 gift card and a parking token.
Eligible participants completed study questionnaires on laptop
computers. Height, weight, and CO were measured by trained
staff. Participants were provided with a mobile phone and an
accelerometer, instructed in their use, and asked to wear/carry
the devices for 7 days. Participants received a US $50 gift card
and a parking token for the completion of the baseline visit.
Participants returned for a final visit and received up to US $80
in gift card compensation depending on the percentage of mobile
phone assessments completed. A mobile phone assessment
completion rate of 80% and the return of study mobile phones
and accelerometers were required to earn the maximum
compensation.

Intervention
Intervention information and prompts used in the current study
were based on previously developed messages and materials
[39,40]. The intervention group received a 1-page printed
handout at the first visit describing the health-related importance
of limiting sedentary time and increasing activity. The handout
included suggestions about ways to reduce sedentary time and
increase light-intensity activity throughout the day (eg, by
moving around in the office). In addition, a daily message used
in previous research [39] appeared on each participant’s mobile
phone at the end of daily diary assessment for 7 days:
“Remember to STAND UP, SIT LESS, and MOVE MORE
today!”
During the 7-day intervention period, participants who reported
more than 2 hours of sitting during the previous day via the
morning daily diary assessment received the following message:
“Medical research has shown that long periods of uninterrupted
sitting increase the likelihood of several health problems,
including obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Make an effort to Stand
Up more, Sit Less, and Move About more. This can be achieved
by taking frequent standing and walking breaks (at least one
break for every half hour of sitting), standing up when talking
on the phone (at work or home), checking emails, etc, and
replacing blocks of sitting time with standing time, such as
doing household chores while watching TV.” This message was
adapted from previous research [39].

 Participants who reported that they were sitting during any
random mobile phone assessment received the following
message: “Medical research has shown that long periods of
uninterrupted sitting increase the likelihood of several health
problems, including obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Please consider
standing up now and moving about for 5 minutes. Make an
effort to improve your health by standing up and moving around
your home or office every half hour during periods of sitting.”
Note that both intervention and control participants completed
mobile phone, questionnaire, anthropometric, and accelerometer
assessments. However, only intervention participants received
the education and mobile phone messages prompts.
Statistical Analyses
A series of linear mixed model (LMM) regression analyses were
conducted to evaluate the influence of the sedentary behavior
intervention 
(relative 
to 
the 
control 
group) 
on
accelerometer-measured daily active minutes as well as daily
minutes of sedentary, light, and moderate lifestyle activity over
7 days. Model 1 adjusted for daily minutes of wear time and
study day. Model 2 adjusted for race (white vs nonwhite),
education (≤high school vs >high school), CO level (ppm), age
(in years), daily minutes of wear time, and study day (day 1-7).
Total number of daily sedentary breaks was also examined as
an outcome, with daily minutes of sedentary time additionally
included in the models. Participants who did not have at least
2 days of accelerometer wear time of at least 10 hours per day
were excluded from these analyses (n=23), leaving an analytic
sample of 215 participants.
Additional analyses were conducted to compare active minutes
and accelerometer counts between the groups during the 10
minutes following random mobile phone assessments where
sitting was reported. A total of 5 participants did not endorse
sitting during any random assessments and, therefore, the sample
size was reduced to 210 participants in these analyses only.
Model 1 adjusted for total random assessments completed, daily
minutes of wear time, time of random assessments when sitting
was endorsed, and study day. Model 2 adjusted for race,
education, CO level (smoking), age, daily minutes of wear time,
time of random assessments when sitting was endorsed, and
study day.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Participants (N=215) were predominantly female (67.9%,
146/215) and nonwhite (black: 50.7%, 109/215; Latino: 12.1%,
26/215; other: 5.6%, 12/215). See Table 1 for participant
characteristics overall and by intervention group. Participants
in the intervention group (n=95) were older, had higher CO
levels, were more likely to be nonwhite, and were less likely to
have completed greater than a high school education than those
in the control group (n=120). Participants did not differ
significantly by intervention group on self-reported mean daily
sitting at baseline (mean 6.90 hours per day, SD 3.71), mean
daily accelerometer wear time during the study (mean 843.63
minutes per day, SD 99.38), or days of accelerometer wear
(mean 5.87 days, SD 1.45). Overall, participants completed
87.2% (mean 24.42, SD 4.15) of 28 possible random
assessments via mobile phone over the 7-day study period,
although control group participants had a slightly higher
completion rate than those in the intervention group (mean
24.93, SD 3.35 vs mean 23.80, SD 4.90 completed assessments,
P=.049).
Descriptive analyses of accelerometer estimates overall and by
intervention group are presented in Table 2. Note that unadjusted
comparisons indicate that intervention participants had
significantly fewer daily accelerometer-measured sedentary
minutes, spent less of their total accelerometer wear time in
sedentary activity, and spent more of their daily accelerometer
wear time active and engaged in light-intensity activity. Active
minutes and total accelerometer counts in the 10-minute
postprompt period were also greater in the intervention group.

Intervention
The LMM regression analyses indicated that participants who
received the sedentary behavior intervention had significantly
fewer accelerometer-measured daily minutes of sedentary time
and more daily active minutes over the 7-day study period than
participants who did not receive the intervention in adjusted
models 1 and 2 (see Table 3). Analyses indicated that those
included in the mobile phone intervention group engaged in
significantly more minutes of light-intensity activity than control
group participants in model 1 only. Daily minutes of moderate
lifestyle intensity activity and total daily sedentary breaks did
not differ significantly between groups in either model.
Additional analyses indicated that intervention participants had
significantly more active minutes (B=0.33, P=.01) and
accelerometer counts (B=350.67, P=.01) than control

Discussion
The current study was among the first to evaluate a mobile
phone intervention aimed at reducing sedentary behavior among
adults of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Findings indicated
that intervention participants had significantly fewer minutes
of daily sedentary time and more daily minutes of active time
than controls over the 7-day study period. Daily minutes of
light-intensity activity was significantly higher among

 intervention participants than those assigned to the control group
in the partially adjusted model, although differences did not
reach statistical significance in the fully adjusted model.
Additionally, supplementary analyses indicated that activity
was greater in the 10 minutes following self-reported sitting
among intervention participants who received activity prompts
than among control participants who did not receive prompts,
although differences did not reach significance in the fully
adjusted models. Overall, simple mobile phone prompts appear
to be a promising strategy for reducing sedentary behavior and
increasing activity, although adequately powered and
well-designed studies will be needed to confirm these
preliminary findings.
Intervention participants evidenced 3% less objectively
measured sedentary time (of total accelerometer wear time) than
control participants. To illustrate, 3% of 14 hours of mean wear
time equals 25 minutes of time spent engaged in activity rather
than in sedentary behavior. Differences in sedentary time noted
in the current study are similar to the reductions reported with
other types of sedentary intervention strategies [41,42]. Bond
et al [28] specifically evaluated a mobile phone-based
intervention using a within-subjects design and showed 3.3%
to 5.9% decreases in sedentary time and 1.9% to 3.9% increases
in light physical activity across 3 variations of the intervention.
Although it is not certain whether these reductions in sedentary
time (and increases in activity) have a significant impact on
health, it is notable that differences in the current study were
found using a very simple intervention which entailed (1) a
printed handout, (2) a mobile phone reminder to “stand up, sit
less, and move more” each morning, and (3) mobile phone
prompts triggered by self-reported sitting several times daily.
It is unclear why the intervention did not seem to impact
sedentary breaks, although one possible explanation may be
that the intervention was not intensive enough. Mobile phone
interventions that are more intensive and those that use prompts
based on real-time activity monitoring may have a greater impact
on behavior.
Utilizing mobile phones to modify sedentary behavior is
advantageous because phones can be used in most settings where
individuals are sedentary, such as in the home or workplace
[43]. In addition, rates of mobile phone ownership are steadily
increasing, with the majority of US adults reporting that they
owned a mobile phone in 2015 [30]. Although mobile phone
interventions have the potential to broadly influence lifestyle
behaviors, they have not been widely employed to modify
sedentary behavior among adults. To date, most sedentary
behavior interventions have focused primarily on reducing
occupational sitting through the introduction of sit-stand desks
and encouragement to use them throughout the day [39,44].
Although the workplace is an important place to target sedentary
behavior, mobile phones offer the potential to influence
sedentary behavior across settings where sedentary behavior is
likely to take place. Plausibly, substantial reductions in sedentary
behavior may reduce the likelihood of developing cancer and
other diseases.
Study findings complement the findings of Bond et al [28], who
tested 3 versions of a mobile phone intervention that provided
feedback about time spent in objectively measured sedentary
behavior and prompted activity breaks following periods of
continuous sedentariness in a sample of overweight/obese adults
who were predominantly white and female. Notably, all versions
of the mobile phone intervention were associated with
within-subjects decreases in sedentary time, although mobile
phone prompts to engage in 3 minutes of activity after 30
minutes of sedentary time were associated with greater
reductions in sedentary time than prompts to engage in 12
minutes of activity after 120 minutes of sedentary time. Future
research will be needed to determine whether mobile phone
interventions have a sustained impact on sedentary behavior
and to determine the optimal scheduling of prompts in
longer-term interventions.
This study has notable strengths and limitations. Strengths
include the application of novel technology that is scalable and
has the potential to modify sedentary behavior across settings.
In addition, although previous intervention research has
primarily focused on reducing occupational sitting [39,44,45],
the current intervention emphasized reducing sitting and
promoting activity among adults across settings. Additionally,
accelerometers were used to provide an objective measure of
sedentary and active time; however, the accelerometers used in
the study are not able to differentiate between sitting and
standing. Because the mobile phone intervention messages
encouraged both standing and moving around, it is noteworthy
that the accelerometers used in this study did not have the
capability of capturing increased time spent standing unless
individuals were also moving around. Thus, it is possible that
the impact of the mobile phone intervention on sedentary
behavior was underestimated. It is also notable that mobile
phone prompts to interrupt sedentary behavior were triggered
based on self-reported sitting during random assessments
throughout the day rather than objective activity monitoring.
A major limitation of the study was the quasi-experimental
design (ie, nonrandom assignment). Sequential assignment of
participants to the groups resulted in differences in participant
characteristics including race, age, education, and smoking
level. Although we attempted to control for differences in
participant characteristics, randomization will be required to
confirm study findings. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that
intervention participants seemed to be more vulnerable in many
ways than the control group (eg, less education, more nonwhite,
more smoking) and it seems promising that the intervention
appeared to have a positive impact. Another limitation was that
the intervention started during the first study visit (because it
was embedded in the larger parent study) and, as a result, there
was no baseline accelerometer measurement period. As such,
we are unable to determine whether there were differences in
objectively measured sedentary time between groups before the
initiation of the intervention, although preintervention
self-reports of daily sitting did not differ between groups.
Finally, the study is limited by the short duration of the
intervention (7 days). Randomized controlled trials will be
needed to confirm these pilot study findings and determine the
longer-term effectiveness of using mobile phone interventions
to modify sedentary time.
In summary, although evidence indicates the importance of
reducing and breaking up sedentary time throughout the day, it

 remains unclear how to most effectively reduce sedentary
behavior. This study evaluated the impact of an intervention
that used mobile phone technology to prompt adults to reduce
and break up their sedentary time and thereby increase activity.
Intervention participants had less sedentary and more active
time than control participants did during the 7-day study period.
Findings also suggest that simple mobile phone messages may
acutely increase activity in the 10 minutes following the prompt.
These findings, although preliminary, underscore the potential
impact of mobile phone interventions to modify sedentary
behavior and positively influence health. Effective mobile phone
interventions for sedentary behavior could be a practical and
wide-reaching tool for cancer and disease prevention.
