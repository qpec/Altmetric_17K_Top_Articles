the Use of Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 
Inhibitors – Real-world Data

T
ype 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with numerous comorbidities that significantly reduce quality of life, increase mortality and 
complicate treatment decisions. In a recent cardiovascular outcomes trial, Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 
2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin was shown 
to reduce cardiovascular (CV) mortality and heart failure in high-risk patients with T2D with a previous CV event or with established CV 
disease (CVD). Recently published data from the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS-PROGRAM) study suggested that 
the cardiovascular benefits of empagliflozin are also seen with the SGLT2-inhibitor canagliflozin, indicating a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. 
Evidence for a class effect has also been shown by meta-analyses and real-world studies, including the Comparative Effectiveness of 
Cardiovascular Outcomes in New Users of SGLT-2 Inhibitors (CVD-REAL) and The Health Improvement Network (THIN) databases. These 
findings also suggest the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME can be applied to patients with T2D with a broader CV risk profile, including people 
at low risk of CVD.

People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have a two- to four-fold increased risk for coronary heart 
disease compared to those without diabetes,1–3 as well as other vascular disorders (consisting of 
heart failure [HF], cardiac dysrhythmia, sudden death, hypertensive disease, pulmonary embolism, 
and aortic aneurysm). Heart failure is a particularly common complication of T2D and is associated 
with poor outcomes.4,5 The risk associated with diabetes is higher at younger ages and lower at 
higher ages. For instance, at the age of 60 years, a patient with T2D and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) has a reduced life expectancy of 12 years compared with the general population, according 
to a study by the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (689,300 participants; 91 European cohorts),6 
and of 2 years at age 67 years in Sweden.3 There is, therefore, a need for novel treatments for T2D 
that not only improve glycaemic control but also reduce the risk of CVD.
Historically, the aim of glucose-lowering therapy in diabetes was to reduce microvascular 
complications and interventional studies focused on intensive glucose reduction in T2D have 
only had a minor or no effect in reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk.7–9 In 1998, the UK Prospective 
Diabetes Study (UKPDS) found that a subgroup of obese patients randomised to metformin had 
a reduction in myocardial infarction (MI).10 Metformin has since become the standard first-line 
drug treatment for T2D.11 However, most people taking metformin ultimately require intensified 
treatment due to disease progression and insufficient glycaemic control. In the last two decades, 
numerous therapeutic options have emerged for T2D, including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors 
(DPP-4i), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors. 
In 2008, following the withdrawal of rosiglitazone from the market because of its association with 
increased risk of HF and MI,12 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated CV outcome 
trials (CVOTs) on glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs).13 In 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
also published a guideline requiring CVOTs for new GLDs for which specific CV claims are made 
or that are suspected of having detrimental CV effects.14 As a result, two drugs – empagliflozin (an 
SGLT2 inhibitor) and liraglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) – have a level A recommendation in the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2018 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes.15 This article 
discusses the findings of the two completed CVOTs on SGLT2 inhibitors to date, their applicability 
to real-world clinical practice, and the findings of real-world studies that included patients with T2D 
with a broader CV risk profile.

Cardiovascular outcome trials on sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors
Early CVOTs of saxagliptin,16 alogliptin,17 sitagliptin18 and lixisenatide19 
demonstrated the safety of GLDs but did not show superiority in 
CV outcomes compared with placebo. In 2015 the Empagliflozin 
Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients 
(EMPA-REG OUTCOME),20 showed a 38% relative risk reduction in CV death 
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49–0.77; p<0.001) 
and a 32% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 
0.57–0.82, p<0.001), as well as a 55% reduction in HF hospitalisations (HR, 
0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.85; p=0.002). The effects were similar for both doses 
of empagliflozin, 10 mg or 25 mg once daily. These were surprising and 
unprecedented findings and attracted considerable attention. The EMPA-
REG OUTCOME study involved 7,020 patients with T2D and established 
CVD who were on standard-of-care medications for both hypertension 
and dyslipidaemia. The size of the effect and the rapid onset of action 
of empagliflozin were almost certainly not due to glucose lowering, and 
prompted questions about its underlying cardioprotective actions, and 
whether the reported CVD benefits were intrinsic to empagliflozin or 
represented a class effect common to all SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, 
EMPA-REG OUTCOME involved predominantly older patients with 
long-standing diabetes and 99% with a prior CVD event (MI, stroke, 
amputation, multivessel coronary artery disease, or coronary artery 
bypass graft), including HF in 10% of subjects. This led to speculation 
about the potential CV benefits of empagliflozin in lower risk patients.
As a class, the SGLT2 inhibitors – empagliflozin, dapagliflozin and 
canagliflozin are currently approved by the FDA and EMA although others 
are in clinical development – share the same mechanism of action. They 
all decrease renal reabsorption of glucose and induce an increase in 
glycosuria (Table 1).21–23 Approximately 90% of filtered glucose is absorbed 
by SGLT2 with the remaining 10% absorbed by SGLT1.23 By inhibiting this 
process, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce renal glucose reabsorption, increase 
urinary glucose excretion and reduce serum glucose concentration. 
They also affect several CV risk factors, including lowering glucose and 
blood pressure (BP), altering fasting lipid parameters, decreasing arterial 
stiffness, weight and visceral adiposity, and decreasing albuminuria and 
serum uric acid levels (Table 1).21,24–30 No significant differences have been 
observed in glucose lowering, body weight loss, and BP reduction among 
the individual SGLT2 inhibitors.21 It has also been suggested that treatment 
with SGLT2 inhibitors ameliorates oxidative stress31 and encourages 
a shift in fuel metabolism from fatty acids to beta-hydroxybutyrate in 
the heart, as well as other organs.32 Other hypotheses focus on the 
potential haemodynamic benefits including reduced pre- and afterload, 
enhanced myocardial oxygen supply and potential improvements of 
SGLT2 inhibitors in cardiac systolic and diastolic function.33 An additional 
interesting hypothesis is that empagliflozin reduces sodium and calcium 
overload in the myocardial cell and increases concentration of calcium 
in the myocardial mitochondria and thereby reducing HF development.34 
If the observed CV benefits are related to the glucuretic/natriuretic effect 
and subsequent volume depletion together with reduction of systolic 
BP or via metabolic effects, they are likely to be common to all SGLT2 
inhibitors. However, different drugs may have different specificity for 
SGLT2 and SGLT1,35 as well as different benefit/risk profiles, therefore it 
is impossible to draw conclusions based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
study alone.
The Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS-PROGRAM) 
was published in June 2017 (Table 2).36 The rate of the primary endpoint, a 
composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal 
stroke, was significantly lower with canagliflozin than with placebo for 
both doses pooled (26.9 versus 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-
years; HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.97; p<0.001 for noninferiority; p=0.02 
for superiority). While these data suggest that a class effect of SGLT2 
inhibitors is likely, unlike in EMPA-REG OUTCOME the reductions in the 
individual end points of all-cause and cardiovascular death were not 
significant in CANVAS-PROGRAM, although the point-estimates were 
in the same direction as in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME. One possible 
explanation for this is that, while almost all of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
subjects had established CVD, approximately 20% of the CANVAS-
PROGRAM were at increased risk for cardiovascular events and around 
two-thirds had no prior history of CVD and were accordingly at lower 
CV-risk and event rates, reducing the statistical power. However, there 
were some notable differences between the safety findings of the 
two trials, with an increased risk of amputation with canagliflozin (6.3 
versus 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41–
2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. 
This was an unexpected finding, raising the question of whether it was 
a random finding or compound-specific, suggesting that important 
differences may exist between the SGLT2 inhibitors, and requires 
further investigation. 
The ongoing large CV outcome trial Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular 
Events (DECLARE)-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-58 
is investigating the effect of dapagliflozin on CV outcomes in a broad 
population of patients with either established CVD (40% have had a prior 
CV event) or multiple CV risk factors, with an estimated completion date 
of 2019 and will give further answers to the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in a 
low risk T2D population and whether a class effect exists (NCT01032629). 
Meta-analyses
A recent meta-analysis and systematic review included data from six 
regulatory submissions (n=37,525) and 57 clinical trials (n=33,385) and 
involved seven different SGLT2 inhibitors. The SGLT2 inhibitors were 
found to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events (MACE; relative risk 
0.84 [95% CI 0.75–0.95]; p=0.006), CV death (relative risk 0.63 [0.51–0.77]; 
p<0.0001), HF (0.65 [0.50–0.85]; p=0.002), and death from any cause 
(relative risk 0.71 [0.61–0.83]; p<0.0001). While the efficacy results were 
largely driven by empagliflozin, results for other SGLT2 inhibitors were 
not clearly different, supporting the hypothesis that that the CV benefits 
of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent across the drug class.37 In addition, a

meta-analysis investigating the CV safety of dapagliflozin analysed data 
from 21 clinical trials (n=9,339), including five phase IIb studies of 12 to 
24 weeks duration and 16 phase III studies of up to 208 weeks duration. 
At baseline, 3,214 patients (34.4%) had a history of CVD (coronary 
artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease or 
congestive HF). The results showed that dapagliflozin was not associated 
with increased CV risk and may have a beneficial effect both in the overall 
population, although confidence limits were overlapping 1.00 (HR 0.77; 
95% CI 0.54–1.10 for MACE) and in those with a history of CVD (HR 0.80; 
95% CI 0.53–1.22).38 These results are consistent with meta-analyses of 
the CV effect of other SGLT2 inhibitors.39
Real-world evidence
As analytical tools continue to grow in power and sophistication, 
real-world evidence is an important component of pharmaceutical 
product development and is increasingly used to support regulatory 
decision-making.11,40–42 Real-world studies are considered statistically 
less rigorous than randomised controls and may have inadvertent 
biases. Two important forms of bias in this respect that may lead to 
overestimation of differences between two treatment strategies are 
the so-called immortal time bias and the time-lag bias.43  Furthermore, 
there can be differences between studies in clinical practice and 
the quality and detail of the data, making studies hard to interpret.44 
Despite these limitations, however, real-world data have the potential 
to improve clinical outcomes by increasing the understanding of how 
best to incorporate new therapies into everyday clinical practice. These 
data help fill the knowledge gap between clinical trials and actual 
clinical practice.45 While clinical trials remain the gold standard for drug 
approval, real-world studies can provide valuable information on how 
drugs perform within specific subgroups often excluded in clinical trials 
(age, gender, differences in disease severity, comorbidities, differences 
in therapeutic adherence). Real-world studies are useful for assessing 
long-term response and safety, as well as for generating hypotheses to 
guide future clinical directions.

 The Cardiovascular Benefits Associated with Use of Sodium-glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors
21
EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
Four recent real-world studies have added to the body of evidence 
in support of the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitors exert their CV 
benefits via a class effect (Table 2). The Comparative Effectiveness of 
Cardiovascular Outcomes in New Users of SGLT-2 Inhibitors (CVD-REAL) 
study is the first large real-world study of patients with T2D.46 It collected 
real-world data from six countries and more than 300,000 patients, 
87% of whom did not have a history of CVD. Inclusion criteria were 
new users receiving a SGLT2 inhibitor or other GLDs with established 
T2D on or prior to the index date, age ≥18 years and availability of >1 
year (6 months in Germany) historical data prior to the index date. The 
study period and inclusion of patients was 2012–2015, thus in large 
part before the publication of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study and not 
influenced by the results or inclusion criteria in that study. Patients in 
the SGLT2 inhibitor and GLD groups were matched by propensity score 
analysis. In the primary analysis, patients prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors 
had a 39% lower associated risk for HF hospitalisation compared with 
other GLDs (HR 0.61, p<0.001). For all analyses (multivariable adjusted, 
intention to treat, stepwise removal of thiazolidinedione, insulin and 
sulfonylurea from the control group), SGLT2 inhibitors showed lower 
incidences of HF hospitalisations than other GLDs (p<0.001). In 
addition, patients in the SGLT2 inhibitor group had lower associated 
risk of all-cause death compared with other GLDs (HR 0.49, p<0.001).46
One limitation of the CVD-REAL study was that other CV events such as 
MI and stroke were not examined, however HF is the most common CV 
comorbidity in T2D.4 Importantly, there was no significant heterogeneity 
in findings across countries, despite geographic variations in the use of 
SGLT2 inhibitors (76% canagliflozin in the US and ~92% dapagliflozin in 
Europe, with empagliflozin accounting for <7% of total exposure time; 
Figure 1). Furthermore, there is no information of the dose distribution of 
the patients treated with canagliflozin and empagliflozin.46 These findings 
suggest that the observed CV benefits are likely to be class related. 
The benefits in terms of HF hospitalisation and all-cause mortality were 
strikingly similar to those reported in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (where both 
doses of empagliflozin had very similar effects), suggesting that the 
benefits translate to real-world clinical practice. In addition, the study 
involved a broad population of patients with T2D, the majority (87%) of 
whom did not have known CVD, suggesting that the benefits of SGLT2 
inhibitors might extend to those with a lower risk of CVD. The CVD-REAL 
study thus suggests that the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may 
be extended to broader and lower risk group of patients with T2D than 
previously evaluated in clinical trials.
The CVD-REAL Nordic study identified all patients with T2D who were 
prescribed GLDs between 2012 and 2015 from the Prescribed Drug 
Registries and linked them with the National Patient Registry and 
Cause of Death Registry in Denmark, Norway and Sweden (n=91,320). 
This represented a broad T2D population and included 25% with 
prior registered established CVD. New use of SGLT2 inhibitors was 
associated with lower risk of MACE compared to new use of another 
GLD, and in a similar magnitude as in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and 
CANVAS-PROGRAM.47
 
Recently the CVD-REAL Nordic study group presented data showing 
that, compared with new use of DPP-4i, new use of dapagliflozin was 
associated with lower risk for HF hospitalisation (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50–
0.77 p<0.001); MACE (HR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; p=0.006); and all-cause 
mortality (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49–0.72 p=0.004).48 Again, these findings 
were similar to those in EMPA-REG OUTCOME but in contrast to a placebo 
as a comparator, the comparator was single group of compounds with 
CV-safe data – the DPP-4i.
Another study investigated all-cause mortality in patients with T2D 
taking dapagliflozin from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) 
database. This was a UK population-based, retrospective open cohort 
study (n=22,124) that compared outcomes in patients with T2D taking 
dapagliflozin with matched controls with T2D who were taking other 
GLDs.49 The study included any patient administered dapagliflozin

after treatment initiation. The mean age of participants was 58.4 
years and the mean duration of diabetes was approximately 9 years. 
 
Approximately 20% of the study population (n=4,350) had a previous CV 
event (ischaemic heart disease, stroke and/or HF).
Data from THIN over a median observation period of 1 year showed that 
all-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients taking dapagliflozin 
than those taking other GLDs (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.50, 
95% CI: 0.33–0.75, p=0.001), similar to the mortality reductions reported 
in EMPA-REG OUTCOME.49 The risk of all-cause mortality was also lower 
in patients taking dapagliflozin in the low CV risk population, (IRR 0.44, 
95% CI: 0.25–0.78, p=0.002). The low risk population was defined as the 
absence of all CVD outcomes (MI and ischaemic heart disease, stroke 
and transient ischaemic attack [TIA] and HF) at baseline. Although 
showing a similar numerical trend, no significant difference in the risk 
of CV events was detected between low risk patients who received 
dapagliflozin and matched controls receiving GLDs. This observational 
study therefore suggested that the CV benefits of empagliflozin in the 
EMPA-REG OUTCOME study are seen with dapagliflozin in both high as 
well as low risk patients.
A report of a Swedish registry study that investigated the association 
of oral GLDs, compared with that of insulin, with the risk of all-cause 
mortality, CVD and severe hypoglycaemia has also been published 
recently.50 The study included all patients with T2D who were new users 
of either DPP-4i or SGLT2 inhibitors (only dapagliflozin was available 
in Sweden during the study period) during 2013–2014. Of 37,603 
participants, 21,758 were matched 1:1 to DPP-4i/dapagliflozin versus 
insulin groups, with median follow-up times of 1.51 years and 1.53 
years respectively. The DPP-4i/dapagliflozin group was associated with a 
reduced risk of all-cause mortality, CVD and hypoglycaemia compared to 
the insulin group (HR [95% CI] 0.56 [0.49–0.64]), 0.85 [0.73–0.99] and 0.26 
[0.12–0.57] respectively. In separate analyses for the two drug classes, 
dapagliflozin was associated with lower risks of both all-cause mortality 
and CVD (HR 0.44 [0.28–0.70]) and 0.51 [0.30–0.86]) respectively, while 
DPP-4i use was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.59 
[0.51–0.67]), but not with CVD (HR 0.87 [0.75–1.01]).50
Finally, another recently published retrospective cohort study in the 
US (118,018 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors, including 73,024 taking 
canagliflozin) found no evidence of increased risk of below-knee lower 
extremity amputation for new users of canagliflozin compared with 
non-SGLT2 inhibitor antihyperglycaemic agents in a broad population of 
patients with T2D.51
Clinical implications of the totality of evidence
The findings of EMPA-REG OUTCOME are potentially paradigm changing, 
for the first time showing a reduction in CV events and mortality in 
patients with T2D with established CVD and have already influenced 
diabetes and cardiovascular guidelines.52–54 The recent CANVAS-
PROGRAM data suggest that the cardiovascular benefits observed 
in EMPA-REG OUTCOME is likely to be a class effect, and its broader 
inclusion criteria suggests that the CV benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors may 
extend to lower risk patients. Real-world studies have further extended 
the inclusion criteria of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS-
PROGRAM. These data suggest that the CV benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors 
may also be applicable to the general diabetic population, not only those 
with established CVD, a finding that should be confirmed in a clinical trial 
setting. The CVD-REAL data were consistent across countries although 
there was considerable heterogeneity of use of specific SGLT2 inhibitors, 
adding to the body of evidence in favour of a class effect. Of note, the 
results of CVD-REAL were unchanged after the sequential removal of 
several GLD classes from the comparator group, suggesting that the 
findings reflect the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors rather than 
adverse effects of comparator GLDs.55 A major limitation so far with real 
life data is the limited information on safety data and future real life 
analyses should also include such information. However, data from the 
DECLARE study is needed before any firm conclusions about a class 
effect can be made.
Summary and concluding remarks
Reduction of cardiovascular complications has become an important 
treatment goal in T2D and for the first time there are licensed GLDs that 
also reduce CV event and mortality.20,36,56,57 While it must be emphasized 
that only empagliflozin is currently recommended by the ADA for CV risk 
reduction, the totality of evidence from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS-
PROGRAM and real-world studies suggest that the CV benefits observed 
with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study may be a class 
effect. There are some signals on increased risk of amputations with 
canagliflozin in the CANVAS-PROGRAM study that should be considered 
in high risk patients. However, in the absence of data from the ongoing 
prospective DECLARE study, it is not possible to conclude that a class 
effect exists. Individualisation remains the cornerstone for selection of 
therapy for hyperglycaemia in T2D.
Results from the CVD-REAL and THIN databases have demonstrated that 
data derived from rigorous, large international epidemiologic studies are 
a valuable addition to those generated by clinical trials, as they suggest 
effectiveness of treatments outside the limitation of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria in randomised controlled trials and in a broader 
patient population, that is more representative of those seen in primary 
care. It is important to note that retrospective studies have inherent 
limitations, possibility of selection bias and residual confounding and 
relatively short follow-up. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors have been used 
in real-world practice for a relatively limited time and long-term follow 
up will be needed to determine whether the observed CV benefits 
are sustained. There is also a need for further studies examining the 
mechanisms underlying the CV benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors although 
CV-mortality-preventive and CV-safe treatment should not be withheld 
awaiting such explanatory findings. q
