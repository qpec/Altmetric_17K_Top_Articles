Abstract
This study examined the association of chocolate consumption with insulin resistance and serum liver enzymes in a national sample of adults
in Luxembourg. A random sample of 1153 individuals, aged 18–69 years, was recruited to participate in the cross-sectional Observation of
Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg study. Chocolate consumption (g/d) was obtained from a semi-quantitative FFQ. Blood glucose
and insulin levels were used for the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Hepatic biomarkers such as serum
γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase (γ-GT), serum aspartate transaminase and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (mg/l) were assessed using standard
laboratory assays. Chocolate consumers (81·8 %) were more likely to be younger, physically active, affluent people with higher education
levels and fewer chronic co-morbidities. After excluding subjects taking antidiabetic medications, higher chocolate consumption was
associated with lower HOMA-IR (β = −0·16, P = 0·004), serum insulin levels (β = −0·16, P = 0·003) and γ-GT (β = −0·12, P = 0·009) and ALT
(β = −0·09, P = 0·004), after adjustment for age, sex, education, lifestyle and dietary confounding factors, including intakes of fruits and
vegetables, alcohol, polyphenol-rich coffee and tea. This study reports an independent inverse relationship between daily chocolate
consumption and levels of insulin, HOMA-IR and liver enzymes in adults, suggesting that chocolate consumption may improve liver enzymes
and protect against insulin resistance, a well-established risk factor for cardiometabolic disorders. Further observational prospective research
and well-designed randomised-controlled studies are needed to confirm this cross-sectional relationship and to comprehend the role and
mechanisms that different types of chocolate may play in insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disorders.
Key words: Insulin resistance: Liver enzymes: Chocolate consumption
Atherosclerotic CVD is the leading killer in the adult population
of Western societies(1). Obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance
are metabolic disorders and well-known risk factors for
CVD(2–4). Hyperinsulinaemia has been associated with an
increased cardiovascular risk in non-diabetic subjects, and has
been related to a number of other conditions such as
hypertension, dyslipidaemia and central body fat distribution(5).
These pathologies are escalating worldwide and constitute an
important concern to public health authorities.
Cocoa research has received much attention over recent
years. Chocolate may have beneficial cardiometabolic effects,
possibly due to cocoa polyphenols. Cocoa beans and its
derivatives contain different types of physiologically active
compounds including, among others, polyphenols and their
flavonoids subclasses(6,7). Cocoa, especially dark chocolate,
represents a noteworthy source of flavonoids as it contains
considerably higher concentrations of flavonoids per serving
than tea, apple and red wine(8,9), contributing to its higher
antioxidant capacity and, presumably, to its beneficial health
effects(10). Epidemiological data suggest that flavonoid intake
from different sources may reduce the risk of CHD(11–13) and
stroke(14) and is inversely associated with coronary mortality(15).
A recent experimental study on obese mice reported that

 obesity-related fatty liver disease, a condition implicated in
diabetes risk(16). In line with these findings, a small, short-term,
cross-over study has reported that cocoa ingestion improved
insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects(17). Another small rando-
mised trial showed increased insulin sensitivity in glucose-
intolerant,
hypertensive
subjects
after
15 d
of
consuming
high-polyphenol dark chocolate(18). Thus far, evidence regarding
a potential role of chocolate intake in insulin resistance and liver
function from human epidemiological studies is lacking.
In
the
present
study,
we
hypothesised
that
chocolate
consumption may have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity
and liver enzymes. Therefore, we examined whether daily
chocolate consumption may be associated with insulin resistance
and serum insulin and liver enzyme levels in a national sample of
adults in Luxembourg, taking into account potential confounding
lifestyle
and
dietary
factors,
including
the
simultaneous
consumption of polyphenol-rich tea and coffee beverages.
Methods
Study design and participants
Analyses were based on data from the Observation of Cardio-
vascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg (ORISCAV-LUX) survey, a
nationwide population-based, cross-sectional study of the adult
population in Luxembourg. More details of the study design,
sample selection and data collection have been previously
reported(19,20). In brief, a stratified random sample of 1432
participants,
aged
18–69
years,
was
recruited
between
November 2007 and January 2009. Trained research staff pro-
vided the participants with detailed instructions on how to
complete the self-administered FFQ(21,22), assisted them in
completing questions on dietary information and then checked
the completeness and accuracy of responses. After data
cleaning, particularly for poorly completed dietary data, 1352
participants were available for the present study. Analyses were
carried out with a set of 1153 subjects after eliminating those
who reported dieting during the survey period (n 199).
The ORISCAV-LUX study was conducted according to the
guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. All proce-
dures involving human subjects were approved by the National
Research Ethics Committee (N 200609/03) and the National
Commission for Private Data Protection. Written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects.
Insulin resistance and liver biomarkers
(dependent variables)
Standard
laboratory
assays
were
used
to
assess
several
biomarkers including fasting plasma glucose (FPG, mg/dl),
serum insulin (µg/l), glycated Hb (HbA1c) in percentage values
and
hepatic
biomarkers
(serum
γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase
(γ-GT), serum aspartate transaminase and serum alanine trans-
aminase (ALT) (mg/l)). Similar to most epidemiological studies,
the HOMA-IR was used as a feasible surrogate approach to
assess insulin sensitivity(23), and was calculated as follows:
HOMA-IR = (fasting glucose × fasting insulin/22·5). Lower
scores indicate higher insulin sensitivity.
Chocolate consumption (exposure-independent variables)
A semi-quantitative, 134-item FFQ was completed by the
participants, including questions on habitual daily consumption
of chocolate during the previous 3 months. The participants
reported their frequency of consumption from six response
options, ranging from ‘rarely or never’ (i.e. less than once per
month) to ‘two or more times per d’. They also selected the
serving size of chocolate based on a photographic manual(19)
provided as a reference (e.g. one portion is equal to one
pre-packaged bar of chocolate). Frequency of consumption
(times per d) × amount of chocolate consumed (g) represented
daily chocolate consumption (g/d). To facilitate data inter-
pretation, daily chocolate consumption was then multiplied by
100 to convert it to 100 g/d.
Covariates
Demographic and socio-economic data were obtained from
a
self-administered
questionnaire
(age,
sex,
education).
Education was grouped into primary, secondary or tertiary
levels. Detailed data regarding cigarette smoking were obtained
from the health questionnaire, and each participant was clas-
sified as current smoker or non-smoker. Self-reported time per
week spent engaging in physical activity was assessed using the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and was
used to classify the participants into ‘inactive’, ‘moderately
active’ or ‘active’, based on scoring criteria of the IPAQ’s
Research Committee.
BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of
height (m2), measured according to standard operating proce-
dures using a digital column scale (Seca 701; Seca). Waist cir-
cumference (WC, cm) was measured at the level midway
between the twelfth rib and the uppermost lateral border of the
iliac crest during normal expiration. Standard laboratory assays
were
used
to
assess
lipid
biomarkers:
TAG
(mg/dl),
HDL-cholesterol (mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol (mg/dl) and total
cholesterol (mg/dl). Blood pressure (BP) was measured using
an Omron MX3 Plus automated oscillometric blood pressure
monitor (O-HEM-742-E). Measurements were taken at least
three times with the participants in a seated position and with a
minimum interval of 5 min between each measurement. The
average of the last two readings was used in the analysis. All
these variables were measured according to ORISCAV-LUX
standardised protocols and have been described in detail in
previous publications(19,24,25).
Total daily energy intakes (kJ/d (kcal/d)), energy from total
carbohydrates, sugars and added sugar, from total fat and SFA
(all as %E) as well as from alcohol (ml/d), fruit and vegetable
consumptions (g/d) were obtained from the FFQ. These
variables have been described in detail elsewhere(25).
Statistical analysis
To
describe
chocolate
consumption
among
the
studied
population, participants were classified into two groups:
non-consumers and consumers. According to the type of vari-
able (continuous or categorical), the Wilcoxon’s and χ2 tests
1662
A. Alkerwi et al.
 were
used
to
compare
demographic,
lifestyle
and
cardiometabolic characteristics across the groups according to
daily chocolate consumption. For categorical variables, values
were expressed as numbers and percentages, and for con-
tinuous variables values were expressed as mean values and
standard deviations.
After exclusion of subjects taking hypoglycaemic medication
(twenty-five subjects; 2·17 %), linear regression analyses were
performed to assess the association between chocolate con-
sumption and FPG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, insulin and liver
enzymes. The coefficient of regression (b) was computed to
predict how much a 100 g increase in chocolate consumption
may increase or decrease each outcome variable. Three models
with progressive adjustment were used:
(1) Basic covariate set (model I): adjusted for age sex, and
education level (primary, secondary or tertiary).
(2) Full covariate set (model II): basic + further adjustment for
smoking status (smoker or non-smoker), physical activity
(metabolic
equivalent-min/week),
fruit
and
vegetable
intake (g/d), total daily energy intake (kJ/d (kcal/d)) and
alcohol consumption (ml/d).
(3) Extended covariate set (model III): full covariate set +
further adjustment for coffee and tea consumption.
Potential confounding factors were identified and included in
the models on the basis of two criteria: (1) had to show a
statistically significant association (P < 0·05) with both chocolate
consumption and any hepatic biomarker and (2) had to be
theoretically or clinically relevant. Although BMI met the first
criterion to be considered as a confounding variable, we deci-
ded not to include it in the multivariable models to avoid over-
adjustment bias, defined as control for an intermediate variable
(or a proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from
exposure to outcome(26). BMI is likely to act as a mediator (or a
proxy for another unmeasured intermediate variable), and thus
intervene in the causal pathway of the chocolate–biomarkers
relationships.
Plausible interactions between chocolate consumption and
BMI were tested and found to be not significant. Several sen-
sitivity analyses were performed to confirm the robustness of
the presented findings. Results were considered significant at
the 5 % critical level (P > 0·05, two-sided). All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.4.
Results
Chocolate consumption
More than 80 % of the participants reported chocolate con-
sumption, with an average daily consumption of 24·8 g/d
(minimum 0·66; maximum 500·7) and median intake of 10·7 g/d
(lower quintile = 5·4; upper quintile = 28·6).
Participant characteristics according to daily
chocolate consumption
Globally, daily chocolate consumption varied significantly
according to demographic, lifestyle and health factors of the
ORISCAV-LUX
participants
(all
P < 0·05),
except
for
sex
(P = 0·7) and tobacco consumption (P = 0·11). Non-consumers
were considerably more likely to have a lower education level,
to be living below the poverty threshold and be physically
inactive compared with chocolate consumers. Those who
consumed
chocolate
were
significantly
younger
(43·1
v.
48·3
years;
P < 0·0001).
Cardiometabolic
co-morbidities
(obesity,
diabetes
and
hypertension)
were
less
frequent
among chocolate consumers than non-consumers (Table 1).
Table 2 describes dietary and cardiometabolic variables
according to daily chocolate consumption. Chocolate con-
sumers
had
significantly
higher
intakes
of
total
energy
(P < 0·0001) and total fats including SFA (P < 0·0001), but lower
intakes of alcohol (P = 0·032), compared with their counter-
parts.
Glycaemic
parameters
including
FPG,
HbA1c
and
HOMA-IR as well as BMI, WC and total cholesterol levels were
significantly higher among non-consumers.
Association of chocolate consumptions with insulin
resistance and liver biomarkers
Table 3 shows the multivariable regression analysis, relating
chocolate consumption (100 g/d) to insulin resistance and
hepatic markers. A tendency for an inverse relationship
between all liver biomarkers and chocolate consumption was
observed, indicated by negative regression coefficients (b) for
all the models.
Daily chocolate consumption was significantly associated
with
lower
HOMA-IR
(P = 0·004),
serum
insulin
levels
(P = 0·003) and liver enzymes including γ-GT (P = 0·009) and
ALT (P = 0·004), after adjustment for age, sex, education, life-
style (smoking status and physical activity) and dietary intake of
fruits and vegetables, alcohol, coffee and tea (model III). Daily
consumption of 100 mg of chocolate was associated with a
reduction of HOMA-IR by 0·16, of serum insulin levels by
0·16 µg/l and of liver enzymes (γ-GT, ALT) by >0·10 mg/l. No
statistically significant associations of FPG or HbA1c with cho-
colate consumption were detected, despite the overall negative
regression coefficients.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional, population-
based study among apparently healthy adults to demonstrate an
inverse association between daily chocolate consumption and
insulin resistance, serum insulin and liver enzymes, indepen-
dent of age, sex and socio-economic, lifestyle and dietary
factors, including the simultaneous consumption of polyphenol-
rich tea and coffee beverages. Daily consumption of 100 mg of
chocolate was associated with lower HOMA-IR (by 0·16) and
serum insulin (by 0·16 µg/l). Likewise, liver enzyme levels were
reduced by about 0·10 mg/l.
Research into the health effects of cocoa has received much
attention over the past few years. Several systematic reviews
and meta-analyses of existing studies have generally agreed on
a potential beneficial association between chocolate con-
sumption and a lower risk for cardiometabolic disorders(6,30,31).
Daily chocolate consumption
1663
 In ORISCAV-LUX
participants,
there
was
no
sex-specific
difference in chocolate consumption. A higher number of
non-consumers were living below the poverty threshold, had
lower education levels and were more physically inactive
compared with regular chocolate consumers.
Chocolate is rich in sugar and fat, contributing to the
assumption that frequent consumption may boost obesity. In
contrast to traditional beliefs, the present study showed that
adiposity measures (BMI, WC), glycaemic parameters (FPG,
HbAc1 and HOMA-IR) and γ-GT were significantly lower
among chocolate consumers. In addition, obesity and other
cardiometabolic-related pathologies such as hypertension and
diabetes were significantly lower among daily chocolate
consumers. These findings are consistent with an American
study focused on candy consumption(32). Therefore, it is also
possible that chocolate consumption may represent an overall
marker for a cluster of favourable socio-demographic profiles,
healthier lifestyle behaviours and better health status. This
could explain, at least in part, the observed inverse associations
with insulin and liver biomarkers.
In the present study, daily chocolate consumers also had
diets higher in energy, with a greater contribution from total fat
and SFA. The lipid content of chocolate is relatively high;
however, one-third of the lipid in cocoa butter is composed of
the fat stearic acid, which exerts a neutral cholesterolaemic
response in humans(33). In addition, further adjustment for SFA
did not change the findings (data not shown).
Our findings are in line with two small-scale interventional
trials. The first study demonstrated that chocolate (cocoa
powder) may have specific insulinotropic effects, irrespective of
the food source or the overall macronutrient composition of the
food(34). The second one, a cross-over trial, showed that
consumption of flavanols-rich dark chocolate reduced insulin
resistance, as measured by three methods: HOMA, quantitative
insulin sensitivity check index and insulin sensitivity index(35).
Recently, data from a longitudinal study revealed that daily
chocolate intake was associated with reduced levels of liver
enzymes in HIV–hepatitis C virus co-infected patients(36).
Cocoa and its derivatives contain a specific class of poly-
phenols named flavanols, which are recognised as having
important
anti-inflammatory
properties,
possibly
reducing
the risk of CHD, cancer and other inflammatory-related
diseases(11,37). Cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants
than most foods. Antioxidant effects of cocoa may directly
influence insulin resistance and, in turn, reduce diabetes risk(38).
An additional potential mechanism through which cocoa might
exert its benefits on insulin sensitivity is dependent, at least in
part, on insulin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) release(39). In fact,
flavanols may stimulate production of NO from vascular
endothelium and mimic metabolic actions of insulin by using
signalling pathways partially overlapping with those regulating
vasodilator actions of insulin(40). Thus, flavanols and related
polyphenolic antioxidants may counteract insulin resistance by
increasing NO bioavailability(7,35). The observed association

 between increased chocolate consumption and lower levels of
ALT, also a marker of inflammation, indirectly confirms
previous in vitro results, suggesting that the mechanism through
which cocoa may be beneficial to liver cells is more related to
its inflammatory effect.
Although our findings and other similar cross-sectional
studies(41–43) have shown an association between daily choco-
late consumption and lower BMI, a more recent prospective
study, with 3-year follow-up among postmenopausal American
women aged 50–79 years, found a direct association between
chocolate–candy consumption and weight gain(44). The diver-
gent findings from these two types of studies could be due to
confounding effects of serious chronic diseases(44). Overweight
and obese subjects (presented with higher BMI) may tend to
decrease their energy-dense food consumption, owing to
associated cardiovascular illness or to stay fit. In addition,
chocolate intake is likely to be underestimated by those with a
higher BMI(30). In our analyses, we excluded participants who
were (at the period of the survey without specifically referring
to the number of years before the survey) on a diet. The par-
ticipants, via a self-reported question, were asked whether they
modified their dietary habits to stay in form or because of their
awareness of several pathologies (hypertension, lipid disorders,
hyperglycaemia or any other reason). This information regard-
ing dieting should help, to some extent, in minimising the
potential for reverse causation, and thus avoid a major bias in
the observed associations. In our studied sample, chocolate
consumption was higher among the younger age group of
participants.
The
relatively
healthy
profile
of
chocolate
consumers compared with non-consumers may be related to
their age, as younger age groups are still healthy and less
exposed to age-related pathologies such as diabetes, hyper-
tension and obesity. Adjusting for a wide range of variables
including age, sex and socio-economic, lifestyle and dietary
factors suggests an independent relationship of these potential
confounding factors. These measures may help reduce the
potential reverse causality bias.
All glycaemic and hepatic biomarkers of interest were also
significantly associated with BMI. After adjusting for BMI in
model III, the observed associations were no longer significant
(data not shown). In this study, we focused on the examination
of the total causal effect. Therefore, it is not only unnecessary but
also likely harmful to adjust for a variable (or a proxy of a
variable) on a causal path from exposure to disease(26).

 Schisterman et al.(26) suggest that one is fairly well protected from
analytic pitfalls by avoiding control for factors affected by the
exposure.
Metabolic benefits from dark chocolate consumption have
been demonstrated with regard to BP as well as total cholesterol
and LDL-cholesterol levels in short randomised trials(17,18). In
addition, chocolate consumption has been linked to lower
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in prospective observa-
tional studies(45). The scientific data indicating that cocoa flava-
nols may make an important contribution to cardiovascular
health continues to grow rapidly. Our findings extend favourable
associations of chocolate intake with cardiometabolic factors and
add evidence for an inverse association between daily chocolate
consumption and insulin sensitivity.
The present study has several important strengths. The data
were derived from a recent European nationwide population-
based sample. Extensive data on a wide range of potential
dietary and lifestyle confounding variables were considered for
the multivariable analyses, which have been rarely controlled
for in other prospective studies or intervention trials. Further-
more, this is the first study to assess the simultaneous
consumption of polyphenol-rich tea and coffee beverages,
although residual confounding by additional unknown or
unmeasured behavioural or other dietary factors cannot be
ruled out.
Multiple components in chocolate, particularly flavonoids,
may contribute to the complex interplay between nutrition and
health. Cocoa and chocolate contribute to trace-mineral intake,
which is necessary for optimum functioning of all biological and
vascular systems. In the context of nutrition, this research
should be pursued in parallel with further investigation of the
potential benefits from chocolate on cognitive and physical
health. Our findings add evidence to the growing scientific
interest to define nutritional recommendations for dietary
polyphenols. Cocoa-based products may offer an extraordinary
opportunity
to
successfully
improve
compliance
to
dietary recommendations. Potential applications of this knowl-
edge include recommendations by healthcare professionals to
encourage
individuals
to
consume
a
wide
range
of
phytochemical-rich foods, which can include dark chocolate in
moderate amounts(33). It is important to differentiate between
the natural product cocoa and the processed product chocolate,
which refers to the combination of cocoa, sugar and eventually
milk and other ingredients into a solid food product(7).
Chocolate is an energy-dense food and individuals must keep
energy intake and expenditure in mind when including it in
their diet, as any excess may cause an increase in weight.
Therefore, physical activity, diet and other lifestyle factors must
be
carefully
balanced
to
avoid
detrimental
weight
gain
over time.
The most predominant limitation of this study was the
cross-sectional design. Although the matter of causality cannot
be replied, these results may form the basis for generating new
hypotheses
regarding the relationship between chocolate
consumption and insulin resistance and liver enzymes. In
addition, despite the intensive efforts to minimise dietary

 reporting inaccuracies through staff training and extensive
control procedures(19), self-reported data may be subject to
misclassification and recall errors. Different chocolate products
yield different amounts of fat, sugar and energy content.
Unfortunately, no data were available about the types of cho-
colate consumed or the amount of flavanols present in finished
food products. Likewise, we do not have information about the
consumption of cocoa beverages such as milkshakes, hot cocoa,
etc., which may confer some drawbacks to our findings.
In conclusion, this study presents some novel findings,
supporting a potential beneficial effect of daily chocolate
consumption on insulin sensitivity and hepatic biomarkers. Taking
the cross-sectional study design into account, further observational
prospective research and well-designed randomised-controlled
studies are needed to confirm this relationship and to comprehend
the role and mechanisms that different types of chocolate may
play in insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disorders.
