Context: Physical activity (PA) is associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Both are
associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but their joint association with
ASCVD risk is unknown.
Objective: To examine the relationship between PA and 25(OH)D, and assess effect modification of
25(OH)D and PA with ASCVD.
Design: Cross-sectional and prospective study.
Setting: Community-dwelling cohort.
Participants: A total of 10,342 participants free of ASCVD, with moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA
assessed (1987 to 1989) and categorized per American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines
(recommended, intermediate, or poor).
Main Outcome Measures: Serum 25(OH)D levels (1990 to 1992) and ASCVD events (i.e., incident
myocardial infarction, fatal coronary disease, or stroke) through 2013.
Results: Participants had mean age of 54 years, and were 57% women, 21% black, 30% 25(OH)D
deficient [,20 ng/mL (,50 nmol/L)], and ,40% meeting AHA-recommended PA. PA was linearly
associated with 25(OH)D levels in whites. Whites meeting recommended PA were 37% less likely to
have 25(OH)D deficiency [relative risk, 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56, 0.71)]; there was no
significant association in blacks. Over 19.3 years of follow-up, 1800 incident ASCVD events occurred.
Recommended PA was associated with reduced ASCVD risk [hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65,
0.93) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62, 0.93)] among participants with intermediate [20 to ,30 ng/mL
(50 to ,75 nmol/L)] and optimal [$30 ng/mL ($75 nmol/L)] 25(OH)D, respectively, but not
among those with deficient 25(OH)D (P for interaction = 0.04).
Conclusion: PA is linearly associated with higher 25(OH)D levels in whites. PA and 25(OH)D may have
synergistic beneficial effects on ASCVD risk. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1227–1236, 2017)

 A
therosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the
leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide
(1, 2). ASCVD can be effectively prevented through
lifestyle modification and treatment of risk factors (3).
Engaging in regular physical activity (PA) is one of the
most commonly recommended methods to prevent
ASCVD; the inverse association between PA and car-
diovascular risk has been well established (4, 5). The
American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recom-
mend at least 150 min/wk of moderate to vigorous PA to
lower blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduce ASCVD risk (6).
Although vitamin D is primarily known for its role in
calcium homeostasis and bone health, epidemiologi-
cal evidence has linked serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
[25(OH)D] deficiency with increased ASCVD risk (7, 8).
Although the mechanisms underlying this association are
not fully elucidated, it is thought that vitamin D primarily
affects ASCVD risk factors such as hypertension, di-
abetes, and inflammation (7, 9). The association of
25(OH)D deficiency with ASCVD may also differ by
race, conferring greater ASCVD risk in whites despite
lower mean 25(OH)D levels in blacks (10–12).
Individuals with low PA are known to have lower
25(OH)D levels (13–19). Additionally, there is evidence
for a positive dose-response relationship between PA and
25(OH)D (14-16), but further studies are required with
larger and more diverse patient populations. Furthermore,
the nature of the association between PA and 25(OH)D
levels has not been fully explored. Much of this association
has been attributed to increased cutaneous vitamin D syn-
thesis from sunlight exposure while exercising outdoors
(13, 19). However, certain studies have found this relation-
ship to persist even with indoor PA and after accounting for
sunlight exposure (16). Meanwhile, biological and clinical
studies have suggested that vitamin D plays a role in muscle
function and postural stability (20–22). Thus, vitamin D may
also influence physical performance and lead to increased PA.
Despite abundant evidence that PA and 25(OH)D are
each individually related to cardiovascular outcomes,
their joint association with ASCVD outcomes has been
largely unexplored. A recent study by Donneyong et al.
(19) found evidence that outdoor recreational activity
and 25(OH)D may interact synergistically to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. However, fur-
ther studies must be done to formally test for an in-
teraction and to explore differences by race. Because both
25(OH)D and PA levels are potentially modifiable in
individuals, this information might help refine future
prevention strategies regarding ASCVD risk.
We examined the association between PA and 25(OH)D,
and the prospective association between PA and ASCVD
outcomes according to 25(OH)D status, in the Athero-
sclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We hy-
pothesized that there would be a linear dose-response
relationship between PA and 25(OH)D, with a plateau
at higher PA levels, that this association would be stronger
among whites compared with blacks, and that 25(OH)D
and PA would jointly influence ASCVD risk.
Methods
Study population
The ARIC Study is an ongoing, mostly biracial, prospective
cohort that enrolled 15,792 men and women aged 45 to 64 years
from four US communities—Forsyth County, North Carolina;
Jackson, Mississippi; suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and
Washington County, Maryland—at baseline/visit 1 (1987 to
1989) (23). Participants took part in up to four additional visits:
visit 2 (1990 to 1992), visit 3 (1993 to 1995), visit 4 (1996 to
1998), and visit 5 (2011 to 2013). We excluded from our analysis
those with prevalent coronary heart disease (n = 675), prevalent
heart failure (n = 558), or prevalent stroke at visit 1 (n = 461); those
missing PA data at visit 1 (n = 1309) or 25(OH)D data at visit 2
(n = 2174); and those missing covariate information (n = 181). We
also excluded nonblack or nonwhite race (n = 45) and blacks from
the Minnesota and Maryland centers (n = 47) because of small
numbers that precluded ability to adjust for race/center groups.
After exclusions, 10,342 participants were included in the ana-
lyses. The institutional review boards at all ARIC study sites and
the coordinating center approved study protocols. All participants
provided written informed consent at each study visit.
Physical activity
At both visits 1 and 3, a modified Baecke questionnaire was
used to assess sports, leisure, and work PAs (24). Data were used
from the sports questionnaire. Participants reported involvement
in up to four sports within the previous year, and the number of
hours per week and months per year spent on each sport. We
converted each sport into metabolic equivalents of task (METS)
per the Compendium of Physical Activities (25), calculated
minutes per week of moderate (3–6 METS) or vigorous ($6
METS) PA, and categorized these into three groups according to
the AHA guidelines as follows: “recommended” ($150 min/wk
of moderate intensity or $75 min/wk of vigorous intensity
or $150 min/wk of moderate plus vigorous intensity), “in-
termediate” (1 to 149 min/wk of moderate intensity or 1 to
74 min/wk of vigorous intensity or 1 to 149 min/wk moderate plus
vigorous intensity), or “poor” (0 min/wk of moderate or vigorous
exercise). We also calculated PA in METS 3 minutes per week
(METS*min/wk) to model PA continuously. We used the PA level
from visit 1 for our primary analyses. In a sensitivity analysis, we
examined the mean of PA levels of visits 1 and 3 in METS*min/wk
as a surrogate for PA levels at visit 2 (which were not available).
Vitamin D
From serum samples taken after fasting at visit 2 and frozen
at 270°C, 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels were measured
from 2012 to 2013 using liquid chromatography tandem high-
sensitivity mass spectrometry (Waters Alliance e2795; Waters,
Milford, MA). Prior studies have shown 25(OH)D to have
excellent long-term stability in frozen samples (26, 27). Using

 duplicate samples, the coefficient of variation for 25(OH)D2
was 20.8% and 6.9% for 25(OH)D3. The intraclass correlation
coefficients from the blind duplicate samples, calculated using the
function icc() in the R package irr (R project, https://www.
r-project.org/), were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95,
0.96) for 25(OH)D2 and0.91 (95% CI, 0.86, 0.92) for 25(OH)D3.
25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were added together for total 25(OH)D
concentration.
We adjusted for seasonal changes by computing residuals
from a linear regression model with 25(OH)D as the dependent
variable and month of visit as the independent variable. The
residuals were added back to the overall mean to determine an
estimated annual 25(OH)D value (18). To convert 25(OH)D
levels to nmol/L from ng/mL, values were multiplied by 2.496.
Using the Institute of Medicine guidelines (28), we considered
deficient 25(OH)D as ,20 ng/mL [,50 nmol/L] and adequate
as $20 ng/mL (28). We also considered three categories of
25(OH)D recommended by the Endocrine Society: ,20 ng/mL
(deficient), 20 to ,30 ng/mL (intermediate), and $30 ng/mL
(optimal) (29).
Covariates of interest
Participant characteristics were obtained from history,
physical examination, and laboratory data from visit 1, except
as otherwise noted. The main covariates included were age,
race/center (Minnesota-whites; Maryland-whites; North
Carolina-whites; North Carolina-blacks; Mississippi-blacks),
sex, education, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass in-
dex (BMI), diabetes (defined as fasting glucose $126 mg/dL or
nonfasting glucose $200 mg/dL, a self-reported physician di-
agnosis of diabetes, or current use of hypoglycemic medication).
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the mean calculated from the
second and third measurements of three obtained. Hypertension
was defined as SBP $140 mm Hg, or a diastolic BP $90 mm Hg,
or reported use of BP-lowering medications. Total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride
levels were measured using standardized enzymatic assays and
reported in milligrams per deciliter. Estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine from
blood samples collected at visit 2 using the Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (30).
Outcomes
The cross-sectional analysis of PA and 25(OH)D was non-
concurrent because PA was measured at visit 1 and 25(OH)D at
visit 2. For this analysis, the primary outcome was 25(OH)D
levels at visit 2. In the prospective analysis, the primary out-
come was incident ASCVD following visit 2, defined as definite
or probable myocardial infarction, definite coronary death, and
definite or probable stroke (defined as sudden or rapid onset of
neurologic symptoms that lasted for 25 hours or led to death in
the absence of another cause). Information on hospitalizations
was obtained from participants via yearly telephone calls, and
vital records were examined for all deaths. Additionally, ARIC
investigators conducted continuous surveillance for all car-
diovascular disease-related hospitalizations and deaths. An
ARIC committee adjudicated all ASCVD events. Study par-
ticipants contributed follow-up time from the date of the par-
ticipant’s visit 2 date [when 25(OH)D was measured] until the
date of incident ASCVD event, death, loss to follow-up, or the
end of follow-up (31 December 2013), whichever came first.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were progressively adjusted as follows: model 1
(our primary model) adjusted for demographics of age, sex, and
race/center, as well as confounding lifestyle factors such as ed-
ucation, smoking status, and alcohol intake. Model 2 addi-
tionally included potential mediating variables of the association
between PA or vitamin D and ASCVD risk: SBP, antihypertensive
medication use, diabetes, total and HDL cholesterol levels, use of
lipid-lowering medications, and eGFR. Model 3 additionally
included BMI, another potential mediator.
First, Poisson regression models [for binary 25(OH)D status] and
linear regression models [for continuous 25(OH)D] were used to an-
alyze the relationship between levels of PA at visit 1 and 25(OH)D
levels at visit 2. To determine if there was a linear dose-response, we
modeled the association between PA in METS*min/wk with the
difference in 25(OH)D levels (measured in nanograms per milliliter)
using restricted cubic spline models. In a sensitivity analysis, we
modeled the association of the average of visit 1 and visit 3 PA
levels with 25(OH)D concentrations.
Then, we performed prospective analyses to evaluate
25(OH)D as a potential effect modifier of the association be-
tween PA and incident ASCVD. We used progressively adjusted
Cox models to assess the association of PA categories at visit 1
with incident ASCVD events stratified by 25(OH)D status at
visit 2 (deficient, intermediate, and optimal). The comparator
reference for these analyses were those with both poor PA and
deficient 25(OH)D levels. An interaction term between PA and
25(OH)D categories was included in the Cox models, adjusted
for model 1 covariates, and the Wald test was used to test the
significance of the interaction and to determine if PA and
25(OH)D levels jointly influenced ASCVD.
We tested for interactions by race. All statistical analyses
were performed using Stata 12 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX). P # 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Cross-sectional association between PA
and 25(OH)D
Baseline characteristics of the study population at visit 1
by AHA categories of PA levels are presented in Table 1.
The mean age (6 standard deviation) was 53.8 6 5.7 years,
57.5% were women, 20.7% of participants were black, and
39.6% achieved AHA-recommended PA levels. The overall
mean 25(OH)D level at visit 2 was 24.7 6 8.5 ng/mL.
Those achieving recommended PA had a higher mean level
of 25(OH)D (26.6 6 8.3 ng/mL) compared with partici-
pants with intermediate and poor PA (24.4 68.2 and 22.7 6
8.3 ng/mL, respectively). Similarly, participants achieving
recommended PA levels had higher levels of HDL-C, lower
levels of triglycerides, lower BMI, and were less likely to be
hypertensive, diabetic and current smokers (all P , 0.001).
After accounting for differences in demographics and
lifestyle factors, participants with AHA-recommended
PA levels at baseline had a 31% lower risk of being
25(OH)D deficient at Visit 2 compared with those with a
poor PA level [relative risk 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.75),
Model 1; Table 2]. This association remained statistically

 significant even after additional adjustment for ASCVD
risk factors, including BMI. Participants with intermediate
PA had a tendency toward lower risk of 25(OH)D de-
ficiency, but this association was not statistically significant
[mean, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84, 1.00); model 1].
There was also a positive association between PA
categories and continuous 25(OH)D levels (Table 2).
Compared with the group with poor PA, among those
with intermediate and recommended PA levels, the
adjusted mean 25(OH)D levels were higher: 0.78 ng/mL
(95% CI, 0.39, 1.18 ng/mL) and 2.40 ng/mL (95% CI,
2.03, 2.77 ng/mL), respectively, independent of demo-
graphic and lifestyle factors (model 1). Again, similar
findings were seen when further adjusted for potential
mediators of this association.
PA level was also positively associated with 25(OH)D
concentrations when PA was modeled as a continuous
variable. In adjusted restricted cubic spline models, the

 association of PA (METS*min/wk) and 25(OH)D levels
was nearly linear (Fig. 1), with no evidence of a dose
threshold. However, this linear relationship was only
seen in whites. Among blacks, 25(OH)D levels plateaued
at higher PA levels, although this was based on fewer
observations (Fig. 2).
The association between PA levels and 25(OH)D was
significantly different by race (P for interaction , 0.001).
Whereas higher PA levels were associated with lower risk
of vitamin D deficiency among whites, this association
was not seen in blacks (Table 3). In fully adjusted models,
the relative risk of 25(OH)D deficiency for recommended
levels of PA compared with poor PA was 0.63 (95% CI,
0.56, 0.71) in whites and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90, 1.07) in
blacks. However, recommended PA was associated with
higher adjusted average 25(OH)D levels in both whites
and blacks; however, the average differences were larger
in whites (Table 3).
Because PA levels were assessed at visit 1 and 25(OH)D
levels measured at visit 2, in a sensitivity analysis, we also
explored the association between 25(OH)D and the mean

visit 2; Supplemental Table 1). The results were consistent
with the associations seen using only visit 1 PA levels
(Supplemental Table 2).
Prospective joint relationship between PA and
25(OH)D on ASCVD risk
Over a mean follow-up of 19.3 years, there were 1800
incident ASCVD events. The adjusted hazards of PA
groups with incident ASCVD, stratified by vitamin D
status, are summarized in Table 4. An interaction was
present between PA and 25(OH)D status on ASCVD risk
(P = 0.04). Among participants with optimal vitamin D
levels ($30 ng/mL), those achieving intermediate or
recommended PA levels [compared with those with poor
PA/deficient 25(OH)D] had .35% lower hazard of in-
cident ASCVD independent of demographic and lifestyle
factors [HR, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50, 0.83) and 0.62 (95%
CI, 0.51, 0.76), respectively; model 1]. This association
remained significant even after adjusting for additional
potential mediating factors, including BMI. Among

 participants with intermediate 25(OH)D levels (i.e., 20
to ,30 ng/mL), those who achieved recommended PA
levels compared with those with poor PA and deficient
25(OH)D levels had a 28% lower hazard of incident
ASCVD, independent of demographic and lifestyle fac-
tors. This remained significant after further adjusting for
additional potential mediators. Participants with inter-
mediate 25(OH)D levels and intermediate PA did not
show a statistically significant reduced hazard of inci-
dent ASCVD. Among those with deficient 25(OH)D,
achieving intermediate and recommended PA levels was
not associated with reduced ASCVD risk.
There was no effect modification by race in the as-
sociations of PA by 25(OH)D status for ASCVD events
(P for interaction = 0.67).
Discussion
This study provides information about the interrelation
between PA and 25(OH)D, both cross-sectionally and
prospectively, as they relate to ASCVD risk. Although
recommended PA was associated with higher mean
25(OH)D levels in both whites and blacks, the relationship
was more linear and much stronger among whites than

 blacks. We also provide information about the synergistic
benefit of combined higher PA and 25(OH)D levels on
reducing ASCVD risk. These findings suggest that future
clinical strategies to prevent ASCVD may be more effective
by increasing suboptimal levels of 25(OH)D in addition
to efforts to increase PA.
Cross-sectional association between PA
and 25(OH)D
Only ;40% of our study population achieved AHA-
recommended levels of PA at baseline and 30% were
25(OH)D deficient (,20 ng/mL), which is somewhat
consistent with the general US population. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported that ap-
proximately 52% of US adults met the guidelines for
aerobic activity in 2011 (31). The National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found .40%
of the US population was deficient in 25(OH)D (32).
PA was associated with elevated levels of 25(OH)D in
other studies (13–15, 17–19). Kluczynski et al. (17)
found a significant trend between incremental increases
in recreational PA and increased 25(OH)D. However,
their study was performed in a smaller sample size
(n = 1343) consisting of postmenopausal women; there-
fore, results might not be generalizable to a larger diverse
population. A larger study from NHANES (n = 6370)
also found evidence of a linear relationship between
objectively measured PA and 25(OH)D. Each additional
10 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day was
associated with 0.32 ng/mL higher serum 25(OH)D (16).
However, PA was only assessed categorically in that
study. Using a continuous model of PA, our study found
evidence of a positive linear dose-response relation-
ship between PA and 25(OH)D levels without a dose
threshold. However, this relationship was more signifi-
cant in whites.
There are several mechanisms by which PA can affect
vitamin D levels. One primary mechanism is through
outdoor exposure to sunlight. UV radiation interacts with
cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol to produce previtamin
D3, which then isomerizes to vitamin D3 (33). It is es-
timated that .90% of the vitamin D required comes from
sunlight exposure (34). Many studies analyzing the in-
terrelation between PA and 25(OH)D have attributed the
correlation to outdoor exercise exposure. A cross-
sectional analysis using NHANES-III data found no
correlation between indoor activity and 25(OH)D levels
(13). However, Wanner et al. (16) did not find a stronger
association between PA and 25(OH)D for outdoor ac-
tivities compared with indoor activities, suggesting there
may be other mechanisms by which PA and 25(OH)D
interact. BMI is inversely correlated with 25(OH)D
levels, which, in part, may be due to vitamin D seques-
tering in adipose tissue (35). Therefore, increased PA may
promote increased 25(OH)D levels by decreasing BMI.
However, even after adjusting for BMI (a potential me-
diator) in our analyses, we still found a correlation be-
tween PA and 25(OH)D.
Greater skin pigmentation reduces vitamin D produc-
tion in the skin (36); thus, increased outdoor PA might

 have a greater effect on increasing 25(OH)D levels in
whites compared with blacks. This phenomenon could
explain the lack of significant dose response between PA
and 25(OH)D level in blacks. Other studies have also
shown that PA is not significantly associated with
25(OH)D levels in blacks (37). In fact, one study found
that 25(OH)D levels in non-Hispanic blacks engaging in
regular outdoor activities were lower than that of inactive
non-Hispanic whites (13). Thus, increasing PA is not an
equally effective method for improving 25(OH)D de-
ficiency among different races, and alternative strategies
should be explored for targeting different populations.
Other studies have suggested a nonlinear association
between UVB exposure and 25(OH)D levels and there
may be a UVB-dose threshold in 25(OH)D production
(38, 39). Thus, the stronger linear relationship we saw in
whites may be due to other non-UVB sources of vitamin
D, such as dietary supplements; prior studies have shown
that blacks were less likely than whites to take supple-
ments (18, 40). Furthermore, those who are exercising
may also be more health conscious in general, and may be
more likely to take vitamin supplements. We did find that
vitamin D supplement use was higher among those with
increased PA. In summary, PA and 25(OH)D may be
associated through mechanisms other than UVB sun
exposure.
Prospective interrelation between PA and 25(OH)D
on ASCVD risk
Additionally, our study found evidence of an interac-
tion between PA and 25(OH)D on ASCVD risk. Our find-
ings show that the association between recommended
PA levels and lower hazard of ASCVD events was sta-
tistically significant among those who had optimal or
intermediate levels of 25(OH)D ($20 ng/mL) but not
among those with deficient levels of 25(OH)D. These
results suggest that both PA and vitamin D are modifying
factors in reducing incident ASCVD, and together they
have synergistic joint effects on ASCVD risk. Our find-
ings corroborate findings by Donneyong et al. (19) who
found that the observed joint effects (HR, 0.61) of out-
door recreational activity and 25(OH)D levels were
greater than the expected joint effects (HR, 0.71) on
cardiovascular disease mortality. However, their study
did not formally test for an interaction and was limited to
mortality outcomes; we have evidence of a formal in-
teraction
with
broad
ASCVD
outcomes,
including
myocardial infarction and stroke, in addition to
cardiovascular death.
One mechanism by which PA and vitamin D may
jointly prevent ASCVD is through inflammation re-
duction. Each bout of exercise promotes an anti-
inflammatory environment, and the overall reduction
in visceral fat decreases the release of proinflammatory
adipokines (41). Likewise, vitamin D has been known to
protect against inflammatory effects such as endothelial
dysfunction and foam cell formation, which precede
atherosclerosis (42). Thus, 25(OH)D may interact with
PA to synergistically prevent inflammation.
25(OH)D may also have an effect on PA itself. 25(OH)D
has been linked to muscle cell contractility, muscle strength,
and postural stability (21). A study of participants
.65 years old found that lower 25(OH)D levels were
associated with decreased coordination, strength, and a
weaker aerobic capacity (22). However, several trials re-
garding vitamin D supplementation and improved physical
performance and activity have had mixed results (43, 44).
Thus, further research regarding this association is needed.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. The analysis was
performed on a large, well-characterized, biracial cohort
of men and women. We were able to analyze outcomes
with a long-term follow-up of 19 years, and ASCVD
events were adjudicated by an expert panel. We
accounted for a number of potential confounders and
mediators with models of varying adjustment.
Nonetheless, there are several limitations to our study.
This was an observational study, limiting our ability to
make a causal inference. We also did not have in-
formation on other key determinants of 25(OH)D levels
such as sun exposure, whether the PA was indoors or
outdoors, or sunscreen use. We also did not have data
available about vitamin D supplement use at visit 2 (the
visit when 25(OH)D levels were measured); however,
data were collected about vitamin D supplements at visit
3. Vitamin D supplements can directly contribute to
25(OH)D levels in a causal manner. Another major
limitation to our study is that data on PA and 25(OH)D
levels were collected at different visits, with PA measured
at visits 1 and 3, whereas 25(OH)D was measured at visit
2 (2.5 years after visit 1). Behaviors such as PA could have
changed over the course of time between visits 1 and 2. To
account for this, we performed an additional analysis
considering a PA variable that was an average of PA from
visits 1 and 3 and similar trends were found. Also, PA was
self-reported, thus reporting bias may have occurred. The
Baecke questionnaire (24), although validated, has
known limitations. Finally, serum 25(OH)D was taken
as a single measurement, whereas 25(OH)D levels can
vary over time. We accounted for seasonality of 25(OH)D
concentrations in the analysis.In conclusion, PA is lin-
early associated with higher 25(OH)D levels without a
dose threshold, and this relationship is much stronger in
whites than in blacks. In this observational study, a
synergistic benefit was noted for combined higher PA

 and vitamin D levels for reduced ASCVD risk. Further
interventional studies are needed to determine whether
simultaneously targeting both improvements in PA
levels and 25(OH)D levels can synergistically improve
cardiovascular health.
