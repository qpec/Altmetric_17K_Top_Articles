Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 8–10% of the population, is characterized by chronic intermittent 
hypoxia (CIH), and causally associates with cardiovascular morbidities. In CIH-exposed mice, closely 
mimicking the chronicity of human OSA, increased accumulation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory 
metabolic M1-like macrophages highly expressing CD36, emerged in aorta. Transcriptomic and MeDIP-
seq approaches identified activation of pro-atherogenic pathways involving a complex interplay of 
histone modifications in functionally-relevant biological pathways, such as inflammation and oxidative 
stress in aorta macrophages. Discontinuation of CIH did not elicit significant improvements in aorta wall 
macrophage phenotype. However, CIH-induced aorta changes were absent in CD36 knockout mice, Our 
results provide mechanistic insights showing that CIH exposures during sleep in absence of concurrent 
pro-atherogenic settings (i.e., genetic propensity or dietary manipulation) lead to the recruitment of 
CD36(+)high macrophages to the aortic wall and trigger atherogenesis. Furthermore, long-term CIH-
induced changes may not be reversible with usual OSA treatment.
Obstructive sleep apnea is a common and highly prevalent disorder affecting 8–10% of the general population. 
Obesity constitutes a major risk factor of OSA, the latter being characterized by recurrent upper airway col-
lapse that occurs during sleep, and leads to episodic hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation1–3. Both epidemiologic 
and intervention-based studies have provided conclusive evidence indicating a causative link between OSA and 
cardiovascular morbidity, independently from associated obesity4–6. However, the mechanisms underlying the 
accelerated atherogenesis that is putatively ascribed to OSA remain elusive. Furthermore, a very recent large-scale 
multicenter randomized trial suggested that treatment of OSA in patients with moderate to severe disease did 
not prevent cardiovascular events in those with established cardiovascular disease, suggesting that long-standing 
OSA may lead to relatively irreversible vascular disease7.
Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) during the sleep period, has been used as a useful murine model of 
OSA, and promotes the presence of increased atherogenesis, particularly in conjunction with other predis-
posing risk factors such as transgenic ablation of LdlR or ApoE, or concurrent feeding of a high fat diet8–14. 
Macrophages are central to the processes mediating atherogenesis, and have been implicated in the initiation 
and progression of atherosclerosis through intrinsic activation, changes in polarity and phenotype, production 
of cytokines, and signaling to other cells in the vessel wall15–19. It is now well established that the presence of a 
pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophage phenotype is associated with increased plaque burden and adverse out-
comes15–19. Specifically, activation of aortic macrophages through scavenger receptor B3 (CD36) has been shown 
to mediate atherosclerosis development in other pro-atherogenic disease models20–22. Moreover, a novel metabol-
ically active M1-like macrophage phenotype has been recently described in the context of obesity-related adipose 
tissue inflammation and insulin resistance23, whereby positive CD36 surface labeling conclusively identified this 
metabolic M1 macrophage phenotype. Recent reports have also suggested that epigenetic modifications may

determine phenotype and activity profiles of macrophages, and more specifically the pro- or anti- atherogenic 
profile of macrophages in vascular areas prone to atherosclerosis, suggesting the possibility that epigenetic mech-
anisms may underlie aspect of macrophage M1 polarization in CIH24–26, as well as the potential reversibility of the 
atherogenic process following treatment26.
In the current study, we aimed to expand on our recent findings in which relatively short exposures of up 
to 6 weeks of CIH promote accumulation of CD36+ macrophages in the aorta of exposed wild type mice fed 
normal chow diet. Here, we extend murine CIH exposures to 20 weeks duration, more closely mimicking the 
usual chronicity of human OSA clinical disease. Through multi-omic approaches we show that the increased 
accumulation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in the murine aorta is characterized 
by a set of differentially expressed protein surface markers, global transcriptional changes and corresponding 
epigenetic modifications in these cells. Furthermore, transgenic CD36 ablation protects mice from the afore-
mentioned deleterious changes to the vasculature, thus providing mechanistic insights into the potential role of 
CD36 in CIH-induced atherogenesis. Finally, we examined the effect of treatment, i.e., cessation of CIH, on the 
reversibility of the morphological and macrophage changes.
Methods
Animals. 
All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the animal care committee at the 
University of Chicago (protocol # 72043). All methods were carried out in accordance with The Principles of 
Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication no. 85Y23, revised 1996). C57BL/6 J and C57BL/6 J CD36−/− mice 
(Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) had unrestricted access to water and regular chow diet, and were housed 
in standard conditions in a temperature-controlled room (24 ± 
 2 °C) with 12:12 h light–dark cycles (lights on 
at 07:00 AM). Transgenic B6.Cg-Tg (ACTB-mRFP1)1F1Hadj/J mice (termed RFP) weighing 22–25 g, were 
also purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). RFP mice express the red fluorescent protein 
(DsREDT3) under the control of a chicken beta-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer. Following expo-
sures, mice were sacrificed using CO2 intoxication and exsanguination via cardiac puncture. Aortas were perfused 
with 5–10 ml of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 20IU/ml heparin, dissected and cleaned under the microscope 
from surrounding adipose and lymphoid tissues.
CIH exposures. 
Animals were housed in identical commercially designed chambers (30′′ × 20′′ × 20′′) that 
can accommodate 24 mice each, and are operated under 12 hour light-dark cycle (Oxycycler model A44XO, 
Biospherix). A custom oxygen concentration profile for the 12 daylight hours was originally extrapolated from 
the saturation recordings of an adult patient with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, which consists of 
90 sec of 6.1% O2 balance nitrogen alternating with 90 sec 21% O2 (room air for 12 hours during the light phase. 
The O2 concentration in the chambers was continuously monitored and automatically adjusted throughout the 
12 hours of light time (07:00 a.m.–07:00 p.m.). For the remaining 12 hours of nighttime, oxygen concentrations 
were kept at 21% O2. Chronic intermittent hypoxia exposures lasted 20 weeks. Mice in the room air control group 
were housed in matching cages and exposed to 21% O2.
Flow Cytometry. 
Detailed protocol is provided as Supplementary Information. Dissected aortas were 
minced and incubated with an aorta dissociation cocktail. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were fixed and 
stained with specific antibodies. Data were acquired on a FACS CantoII cytometer using the FACS Diva 5.5 soft-
ware (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). In all of the 
experiments, macrophages were identified as CD11b-F4/80 double positive cells.
Cell isolation. 
Detailed protocols are provided as Supplementary Information. In brief, macrophages 
were isolated using magnetic beads with an EasySep positive selection kit (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., 
Vancouver, Canada). Monocytes were isolated from whole blood using a monocyte enrichment kit (STEMCELL). 
Bone-marrow derived monocytes were enriched in a similar fashion from cells isolated from perfused femurs 
and tibias of eight-week old transgenic B6.Cg-Tg (ACTB-mRFP1)1F1Hadj/J mice (termed RFP) male mice and 
matched wild-type controls.
Transcriptomics analysis. 
Total RNA were isolated from aorta macrophages using miRNeasy Mini 
Kit-column-based system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Purified total RNAs were processed for labeling 
using the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) 
and hybridized with whole-genome mouse Agilent microarrays (8 × 
 60 K). Microarray data was validated 
by qRT-PCR in a selected number of loci. Detailed protocols and data analysis methods are provided as 
Supplementary Information.
Epigenetic profiling. 
Detailed protocols are provided as Supplementary Information. Macrophages were 
isolated from aortas as described above. Immediately after isolation, cells were crosslinked and chromatin immu-
noprecipitated using the True MicroChip kit (Diagenode, Denville NJ) and antibodies specific for H3K9ac and 
H3K27me3 histone modifications. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the MicroPlex kit (Diagenode). 
Libraries were pooled and spike-in PhiX Control v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was added. Clusters were gener-
ated and sequenced using a HiSeq2000 instrument (Illumina). Sequencing data was submitted to the GEO data-
base (Accession number: GSE86851). Sequencing data was verified by single locus ChIP-qPCR analysis.
IHC and Image Processing. 
Carotid arteries were harvested from several mice in each treatment group and 
embedded in paraffin. Sections from each carotid artery were designated for H&E staining (at 1,000, 3,000, and 
5,000 μ 
m), and other staining protocols, as detailed in Supplementary Information.

Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS). 
The ECIS array enables assessment of morpho-
logical cell changes, cell locomotion, and other behaviors directed by the cell’s cytoskeleton. As cultured cells 
attach and spread on the electrode surface, impedance is altered, and serves as a measure for disruption of the 
endothelial cellular junction. This method is based on measuring non-invasively the frequency-dependent elec-
trical impedance of cell-covered gold-film electrodes along the time course of the experiment. Detailed protocol 
is provided as Supplementary Information.
Data Analysis. 
Results are presented as means ± 
 SD, unless stated otherwise. All numerical data were subjected 
to statistical analysis using independent Student t tests or analysis of variance followed by post-hoc tests (Tukey) 
as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 21.0; SPPS Inc., Chicago, Ill.). 
 
For all comparisons, a 2-tailed p < 0.05 was considered to define statistical significance.
Results
CIH promotes vascular remodeling, vascular wall inflammation and accumulation and proliferation 
 
of bone-marrow derived macrophages in murine aorta. 
Histological analyses of aortas from mice 
exposed to CIH demonstrated components of vascular dysfunction, characterized by increased intima-media 
thickness (IMT) (Fig. 1A) and disruption of the integrity of elastic laminae (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the histo-
logical findings, the semi-dry weight of cleaned aortas was significantly higher in CIH mice, a surrogate indicator 
of hypertrophic changes.
In agreement with a previous study27, exposures to CIH in C57BL/6 J mice being fed a regular chow resulted 
in a 25% increase in the number of aortic macrophages as measured by flow cytometry (4.1% ± 
 0.1% vs. 
5.1% ± 0.2%, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2A). In addition, aortic macrophages had increased proliferation rates as indicated 
by Ki-67 staining (MFI in RA: 2409 ± 260 vs. 3783 ± 513 following CIH, p = 0.004; Fig. 2B).
The increased proportion of aortic macrophages under CIH conditions consisted of Ly-6chigh (5.9% ± 
 0.6% vs. 
8.7% ± 0.9%, p = 0.02), thus indicating that these were myeloid cells originating from the bone-marrow and pro-
moting atheroma formation28. Moreover, the putative atheroprotective anti-inflammatory Ly-6clow macrophages29 
were less abundant in CIH aortas (70.8% ± 
 1.4% vs. 63.2% ± 
 1.5%, p < 
 0.001). Similarly, the proportion of

anti-inflammatory tissue-resident macrophages30, identified here as CD64+ 
 cells, was lower in CIH-exposed 
aortas (61.7% ± 2.5% vs. 54.6 ± 3%, p < 0.05). To further confirm the notion that bone-marrow recruitment pro-
vides a major source of increased macrophage accumulation in aorta wall following CIH exposures, we isolated 
bone-marrow monocytes from RFP mice and injected into RA- or CIH-exposed WT C57BL/6 J mice. One week 
after i.v. injection of RFP monocytes, blinded histological analysis of the aortas showed significantly increased 
homing of RFP-positive cells into CIH aortas (Fig. 2C). Similar to non-injected CIH exposed mice, the locations 
of RFP monocytes were primarily in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta regions.
To further ascertain aortic macrophage accumulation following CIH, we found similarly increased numbers of 
macrophages in the aortic wall of C57BL/6 J mice exposed to CIH using confocal microscopy imaging (Fig. 2D). 
As would be anticipated based on well-established atherosclerosis models9,31, the most pronounced effects of CIH 
occurred in vessel regions that are prone to development of atherosclerosis, i.e., aortic arch and lower abdominal 
aorta (Fig. 2E). Additionally, VCAM-1 expression, an adhesion molecule critical to the atherogenic process32, 
was increased in aortic sections of CIH mice. Interestingly, high magnification images revealed that the increased 
VCAM-1 expression localized to both macrophages and endothelial cells, reinforcing the concepts on the

macrophages among cells isolated from aorta was significantly higher in CIH-exposed mice than in RA

importance of interactions between activated endothelium and myeloid cells (Supplementary Figure S1). In con-
trast with nearly complete recovery of macrophage counts when CIH-exposed mice for 6 weeks were returned 
to normoxic conditions for an additional 6 weeks26, return of a subset of mice after 20 weeks of CIH (n = 
 6) to 
normoxia for 6 weeks revealed persistent and unaltered increases in aorta macrophage counts, VCAM1, and Ki67 
staining (Fig. 2).
CIH exposed blood monocytes exhibit increased ability to disrupt endothelial barrier ex-vivo. 
 
Activated monocytes display an increased ability to attach to the vascular lining, penetrate the endothelial barrier 
and migrate into the intima regions of the vessel. Circulating monocytes from CIH and RA-exposed mice were 
isolated and added to a monolayer Bend.3 endothelial cell culture in vitro, while assessing transcellular layer 
resistance using ECIS. Of note, the overall percentage of monocytes in peripheral blood and the relative propor-
tions of Ly-6chigh monocytes were similar in RA and CIH-exposed mice. However, monocytes from CIH-exposed 
mice readily disrupted the integrity of the monolayer to a much greater extent than RA-derived monocytes, as 
evidenced by larger reductions in monolayer resistance, thereby indicating functional activation consistent with 
the phenotypic changes in aortic macrophages described below (Fig. 3). In support of these findings, significant 
increases in the expression of genes representing monocyte transmigration processes across vessel wall, such as 
integrins (Itgb2), immunoglobulin superfamily members (Icam1, F11r, Amica1), selectins (Sell) and chemokine 
receptors (Ccr2)33 emerged in the transcriptome of aortic macrophages (see below).
CIH promotes M1-CD36+ metabolically active macrophage phenotype. 
Macrophage scavenger 
receptor B3 (CD36) participates in the uptake of oxLDL and promotes atherogenesis through increased myeloid 
cell accumulation in the arterial intima20. Recently, CD36 has been identified as a novel marker for macrophage 
activation in the context of metabolic stimuli such as free fatty acids (FFA) or hyperglycemia, rather than by bac-
terial infection-induced inflammation23, indicating a very unique subset of pro-inflammatory macrophages with 
a more specific role in processes such as atherogenesis. We should remark that CIH is characterized by significant 
dyslipidemia and metabolic dysfunction as well as by higher circulating levels of FFA34. We found that CD36+ 
macrophages were present in significantly higher numbers in CIH aortas (37.6% ± 
 2.6% in RA vs. 48.0% ± 
 1.7% 
in CIH, p = 
 0.007). Next, we tested aortic macrophages for surface expression of a classical M1 marker, CD8635, 
which serves as a co-stimulatory molecule expressed during foam cell formation (along with CD36), and is impli-
cated in the activation of T-cells in atherogenesis36. CD86 expression was significantly increased on the surface 
of aortic macrophages following CIH (17.1% ± 
 0.9 in RA vs. 21.4 ± 
 1.8 in CIH, p = 
 0.04). Interestingly, CD11c, 
a surface marker of M1 macrophages upregulated in adipose tissue macrophages following CIH37, was not dif-
ferent between CIH and RA conditions. This finding is consistent with previously published studies regarding 
lack of CD11c expression on murine aortic macrophages35,38. To further characterize the sub-populations of 
macrophages that exhibit increased CD36 surface expression: CD36 expression increased 2.3 fold on CD86+ 
macrophages as compared to CD86−, 3.1 fold in Ly-6chigh macrophages, and 1.14 fold in CD64− macrophages. 
Interestingly, proliferation rates, measured by Ki-67, were significantly higher in CD36+ vs. CD36− cells (2.6 fold 
increase, p < 
 0.001). Taken together, these data suggest that CIH induces increased CD36 expression in aortic 
macrophages, preferentially among proliferating bone-marrow derived M1 cells.

Aortic macrophages from CIH exposed mice change transcription of genes towards a 
pro-inflammatory, pro-atherogenic program. 
Based on the significant changes in a small number of 
a priori known macrophage activation markers, whole genome transcriptomic analyses were performed in CIH 
and RA-exposed aortic macrophages using microarrays. Bioinformatic analysis revealed significant differences 
involving ~16,000 genes (Fig. 4A), illustrating the extensive effect of CIH across a multiplicity of gene pathways. 
Unbiased hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated a clear segregation of CIH and RA samples (Fig. 4B. These 
findings were verified using RT-PCR techniques in a subset of genes previously implicated in the pathophysiology 
of atherosclerosis, such as increased in IL-6, iNOS, and CD36 expression, and reduced ABCA1 expression.
Next, we used a computer algorithm to systematically search PUBMED for studies describing a functional role 
in atherogenesis for each of the top 20 differentially expressed transcripts in CIH-exposed aortic macrophages. 
Interestingly, 4 of these 20 genes have been previously identified as atherogenesis-related. Finally, Ingenuity path-
way analysis (IPA) was used to study the interactions of the top differentially expressed genes ( ≥ 
 4-fold difference) 
Figure 4. Transcriptomic analysis of CIH-derived aorta macrophages. (A) Volcano plot showing 
differentially expressed transcripts between CIH-derived and RA-derived aorta macrophages (n = 8 per

to identify their putative biological and functional pathways. This process further indicated that these highly 
differentially expressed genes were all involved in atherosclerosis and inflammation-related canonical pathways 
(Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data provide evidence that the differential transcriptional program activated in aortic 
macrophages in vivo following exposures to CIH underlies a pro-atherogenic inflammatory phenotype, even in 
absence of other predisposing factors such as diet manipulation or genetic propensity.
CIH promotes epigenetic changes in aortic macrophages corresponding to expression profile. 
 
Large-scale epigenomic profiling by ChIP-Seq. To explore how CIH exposures affect the epigenetic landscape 
of the aorta macrophages, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to next-generation sequenc-
ing (ChIP-Seq) in macrophages isolated from aortas of mice exposed to CIH or RA conditions for 20 weeks. 
We investigated two known histone modification marks: acetylation of lysine 9 at histone 3 (H3K9ac) and 
tri-methylation of lysine 27 at histone 3 (H3K27me3). Presence of such marks have been associated to open and 
closed chromatin configurations, respectively39,40.
Given the little amount of cells available per condition (< 
10,000 cells per mouse), the data generated were 
limited and presented several challenges for the analysis. Overall, the quality of the sequencing reaction was 
good with the following yields: CIH-H3K9ac = 5.65 Gbases, RA-H3K9ac = 4.59 Gbases, CIH-H3K27me3 = 2.24 
Gbases, and RA-H3K27me3 = 
 1.55 Gbases (Supplementary Table S4). As detailed in the materials and methods 
section, we applied several levels of filtration to remove low complexity and blacklisted regions41. Additionally, 
the results from two Chip-seq analysis tools were combined in an attempt to identify the most well-supported 
differentially bound sites.
For the active mark H3K9ac, we identified 11,685 and 13,854 regions (peaks) showing significant enrichment 
(adjusted p-value < 0.01) in aorta macrophages isolated from mice exposed to CIH and RA, respectively. Among 
them, 7,096 and 7,485 were associated to annotated genes. To ensure that the peaks were representative of true 
epigenetic differences and not artefactual, we further reduced the list of candidate peaks by selecting the 1000 
peaks with the highest number of reads for CIH and RA samples, which were associated to 1,486 and 1,482 anno-
tated transcripts, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Downstream analyses were performed using the reduced 
list of candidate peaks. In turn, for the inactive mark H3K27me3, we identified 131 and 71 regions (peaks) with 
significant enrichment (adjusted p-value p < 
 0.01) in aorta macrophages isolated from mice exposed to CIH 
and RA, respectively, with 102 and 58 peaks associated to annotated genes. Given the limited number of peaks 
detected for the repressive mark, no further filters were applied and these candidate lists were used for down-
stream analysis (Supplementary Table S3).
To further investigate functional relations between the genes displaying active or repressive marks, we used 
a bioinformatics approach (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) to identify overrepresented biochemical pathways 
among the genes bearing the epigenetic marks. The software enabled the detection of canonical pathways or 
lists of molecules that are known to be involved in a particular type of molecular or cellular respond to a given 
agent (Ingenuity Tox lists), which are significantly over-represented in the candidate lists. We found significant 
over-representation (p < 
 0.05, hypergeometric test) of the active mark (H3K9ac) in diverse signaling pathways 
that are expected to be activated upon hypoxia exposures, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), p53, and TGF-β 
signaling (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we observed significant over-representation of NRF2-mediated oxidative stress 
response (Fig. 5A). For the repressive mark (H3K27me3), we detected significant over-representation (p < 
 0.05, 
hypergeometric test) in pathways related to oxidative stress activation by different pathways to that observed for 
the active mark (i.e. Glutamate receptor signaling and glutathionine redox reactions), as well as calcium and IL-22 
signaling (Fig. 5B). Next, we built unsupervised gene networks depicting the functional interactions between 
the genes associated to H3K9ac and H3K27me3 peaks. In both cases, we identified networks related to immune 
responses (Fig. 5C and D). However, whereas networks of genes associated with H3K9ac peaks (active mark) 
were centered on NF-kB and related to ATM and p53 signaling42–44 (Fig. 5C), networks of genes associated with 
H3K27me3 (repressive mark) were related to anti-inflammatory pathways which are protective against athero-
sclerosis, such as PPAR/RXR and LXR/RXR activation45,46 (Fig. 5D).
Single locus analysis. We assessed the differences in the two epigenetic marks (H3K9ac and H3K27me3) that 
occur in aorta macrophages after CIH exposures in 8 candidate genes (Fig. 5E, Supplementary Table S2). We 
selected 3 genes associated with peaks selected from the ChIP-Seq experiment: Foxo4 (ChIP-Seq Peak ID: 
2102356, increased H3K9ac after CIH; CIH-RA count difference = 113, p-value: 1.26 × 10−27), Lrtm2 (ChIP-Seq 
Peak ID: 1710745, decreased H3K9ac after CIH; CIH-RA count difference = 
 − 
125, p-value: 2.51 × 
 10−34), 
and Gabbr2 (ChIP-Seq Peak ID: 129982, decreased H3K27me3 after CIH; CIH-RA count difference = 
 − 
38, 
p-value:5.36 × 
 10−11). Moreover, we included 5 genes encoding proteins with a known function in macrophage 
biology and atherosclerosis from which we have previously shown in this study significant increased expression 
(Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 
 0.001) on aorta macrophages after CIH exposures (Supplementary Table S5): 
Cd36 (logFC = 1.80), Abca1 (logFC = 1.12), Il6 (logFC = 1.38), Vcam (logFC = 1.98), and Nos2 (logFC = 1.07).
We defined CHIP-qPCR-based assays (Supplementary Table S1) for these genes either at regions of reported 
enrichment for the H3K9ac mark (Cd36, Abca1, Il6, Vcam and Nos2) or within the peaks discovered during the 
ChIP-Seq experiment (Foxo4, Lrtm2, and Gabbr2). Notably, ChIP-qPCR assays for the Abca1 and Il6 genes were 
also located within the peaks identified by ChIP-Seq: Abca1 ChIP-Seq peak ID: 1397501, increased H3K9ac 
after CIH; CIH-RA count difference = 
 175, p-value = 
 3.97 × 
 10−15, and Il6 ChI-Seq peak ID: 1505644, increased 
H3K9ac after CIH; CIH-RA count difference = 106, p-value = 2.26 × 10−17.
Enrichment of both epigenetic marks (H3K9ac and H3K27me3) was studied in macrophages isolated from 
aortas collected from mice exposed to 20 weeks CIH or RA conditions. Figure 5E summarizes the results of 
the ChIP-qPCR experiments. Enrichment of the epigenetic marks were concordant between the ChIP-PCR

CD36 mediates the pro-inflammatory changes in aortic macrophages. 
We have previously 
reported that CIH in vitro upregulates transcription of CD36 mRNA in myeloid cells through activation of leu-
kotriene B4 receptor-1 pathways12. In the current study, up-regulation of both CD36 mRNA and protein levels 
in aortic macrophages in vivo emerged. To further explore the potential contributory role of CD36 to the aortic 
macrophage inflammatory process during CIH, we repeated the CIH exposures in mice with a genetic ablation of 
CD36. CD36−/− mice on a C57BL/6 J background were exposed to CIH and aortas were analyzed for macrophage 
content and inflammatory phenotype. Remarkably, CD36−/− mice exhibited decreased number of aortic wall 
macrophages (Fig. 6A), along with no changes in the proportions of the pro-inflammatory bone marrow-derived 
(Ly6chigh) (Fig. 6B), tissue-resident (CD64+) (Fig. 6C) and pro-inflammatory M1 (CD86+) (Fig. 6D) cells when 
compared to RA-exposed CD36−/− mice. Therefore, these findings suggest a mechanistic link between CD36 
expression and CIH induced aortic macrophage inflammation.
Discussion
This study shows that prolonged chronic exposures to intermittent hypoxia during sleep mimicking OSA elicit 
recruitment of bone marrow derived macrophages to the aortic wall even when the underlying exposures occur 
in the absence of a concurrent pro-atherogenic setting, such as genetic propensity or altered dietary intake

(e.g. atherogenic or high fat diets). In addition, discontinuation of intermittent hypoxia for a relatively long 
period is not accompanied by concurrent improvements in aortic wall cellular inflammatory characteristics. 
Furthermore, the dominant phenotypic polarization of CIH-exposed bone marrow derived macrophages is not 
only disruptive to the endothelial barrier, but further assumes a unique M1 metabolic profile that is recogniza-
ble by the heightened expression of CD3623. Transcriptomic approaches further illustrated the extensive effect 
of CIH on macrophages, whereby multiple previously recognized pro-atherogenic pathways are recruited in a 
CD36-dependent manner. Finally, assessment of epigenetic changes in aorta macrophages exposed to long-term 
CIH revealed a complex interplay of histone modifications activating and silencing the expression of genes in 
functionally relevant biological pathways, such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Noteworthy, we identified 
repressive and activating marks in functionally related gene networks, but identifying precise pathways leading to 
the pro-inflammatory phenotypes, revealing that CIH triggers specific epigenetically driven mechanisms during 
the atherogenic development (Fig. 5).
Before we discuss the potential significance of some of our major findings, some methodological issues deserve 
comment. First and in line with previous reports9, we implemented isolated CIH exposures for 20 weeks with-
out the concomitant imposition of additional risk factors (ApoE or LdlR knockout mice13,22 or high-fat diet10). 
Although such strategy did not result in development of frank atherosclerotic lesions, we found the presence of 
significant increases in IMT along with disruption of elastic laminae, both of which are considered as indicative 
of pro-atherogenic changes47,48. Indeed, IMT is a widely used non-invasive method in human studies to assess the 
extent of atherosclerotic burden both in the coronary49 and extra-coronary arteries50. Increases in IMT have also 
been described in hypertensive OSA patients51 and associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Similarly, elastic 
laminae are a key component of the normal vascular wall and help transduce pressure waves through the artery 
wall. Impairment of the normal transduction of the artery pressure wave resulting from disruption of elastic lam-
inae promotes turbulent flow in areas of increased pressure, around bifurcations and curves, and subsequently 
results in predisposition of these areas to atherosclerosis52,53. The elastic laminae changes described herein follow-
ing CIH are compatible with previously reported increases in systemic blood pressure elicited by CIH54 and are 
also present in the context of long-term sleep fragmentation exposures, another hallmark characteristic of OSA55. 
Second, our experiments using monocytes derived from the bone marrow of RFP mice cannot be viewed as 
conclusively providing evidence that the major source of aorta macrophages originates from the bone marrow in 
CIH-exposed mice. However, the marked increases in RFP macrophages in the aorta wall after their intravenous 
administration along with the increased presence of macrophages in the aorta wall bearing markers of their bone 
marrow origin point to the bone marrow myeloid cells as the major protagonist facilitating CIH-induced aorta 
inflammatory processes. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that changes in the number of circulating 
monocytes may have occurred among CIH-exposed mice and that some of the increases in macrophage counts in 
the aorta wall may be due to such changes. We surmise that such possibility is unlikely, particularly since similar 
findings were identified in mice exposed to CIH but then allowed to recover in normoxic conditions for 6 weeks. 
Finally, the changes induced by CIH-exposed circulating monocytes on endothelial barrier electrical impedance 
do not necessarily indicate that the full process of monocyte activation and transmigration occurred, but none-
theless provide compelling evidence as to the disruption of endothelial barrier integrity, a critical initial event in 
this process33,56,57. We should also remark that discontinuation of the intermittent hypoxia exposure for a period 
of 6 weeks did not result in major improvements in either elastic laminae distribution or aorta wall inflammatory 
cells. Although these findings are preliminary in nature, they clearly raise the possibility that either a 6-week 
recovery period is insufficient for reversal of 20-week CIH-induced changes, even if such reversal does occur 
after 6 weeks exposure26, or that the prolonged exposures to CIH epigenetically alter inflammatory cells such as 
macrophages within the aorta to perpetuate pro-atherogenic pathways.
In a previous study, we found that M1 pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in the context of high fat 
diet or hyperglycemic states involves metabolic pathways that are driven by independent pro-inflammatory 
and anti-inflammatory pathways, which regulate balance between cytokine production and lipid metabolism22. 
Indeed, we identified that in addition to PPARγ 
 and p62/SQSTM1, two key proteins that limit inflammation 
in metabolically activated macrophages, cell surface proteins specifically overexpressed by metabolic M1 mac-
rophages included ABCA1, CD36, and PLIN2, i.e., proteins involved in lipid metabolism22,58. Very interestingly, 
we detected in the gene network analysis that repressive marks are enriched in PPAR signaling genes (Fig. 5D), 
suggesting an epigenetic regulation for the PPAR pathway in macrophages upon CIH exposure. The deregulation 
of lipid metabolism by CIH59–61 and the relative similarities between CIH and other metabolic stressors linked 
to atherosclerosis prompted us to explore the possibility that early CIH may mimic the aforementioned transi-
tions in polarity exhibited by macrophages27,62. Relatively short-lasting exposures to CIH induced early emer-
gence of an increased population of CD36+ 
 macrophages exhibiting concurrent shift to M1 polarity markers27. 
Based on such findings, we surmise that CIH acts as a major potentiator of the coordinated interplay of multiple 
pro-inflammatory events that characterize atherosclerosis, including recruitment, activation, and transmigration 
of bone marrow derived monocytes into M1 macrophages with unique metabolic characteristics63–65.
Epigenetic regulation of pro-inflammatory phenotypes in aorta macrophages. 
To our knowl-
edge, this is the first time that genome-wide histone modification profiling is conducted in macrophages isolated 
from murine aortas. This task represented a technological challenge since the amount of recovered cells after the 
dissection of the mouse aorta is very low (less than 10,000 cells per animal). Despite the technical limitations, 
we successfully enriched the fractions corresponding to one active (H3K9ac) and one repressive (H3K27me3) 
chromatin marks in aorta macrophages from mice exposed to CIH and RA paradigms, prepared the libraries 
and sequenced them by NGS. Single locus analysis of selected candidate genes in a set of independent samples 
demonstrated that the epigenetic differences were not due to technical artifacts. Noteworthy, the number of peaks 
obtained for the H3K9ac mark, was considerable higher than those for the H3K27me3. This discrepancy may be

explained by the efficiency of the antibody in each IP, but most likely reflects an increased level of active marks 
and reduced level of repressive chromatin marks in the aorta macrophages, regardless of exposure. In this regard, 
it has been shown that the H3K27me demethylase Jmjd3 is expressed in migrated macrophages66. However, 
whether the increased number of the active mark H3K9ac in migrated macrophages results from increased acet-
yltransferase or reduced deacetylase activities remains to be determined. Further experiments are needed to elu-
cidate the molecular mechanisms leading to epigenetic alterations in mouse aorta macrophages, and how they are 
affected by exposures to CIH conditions.
In contrast with analysis of pre-determined candidate regions, genome-wide analyses enable the discovery 
of novel regions of epigenetic variations, as well as the identification of pathways and gene networks that are 
epigenetically modified. Here, we identified an over-representation of active marks (H3K9ac) in CIH-exposed 
macrophages in genes that are recognized as hypoxia-responsive pathways for transcriptional activation, 
such as hypoxia-inducible factor, p53, and TGF-β 
 signaling67 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, we detected significant 
over-representation of both the active (H3K9ac) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks in pathways associated to 
oxidative stress response, though the specific pathways differed. Whereas the H3K9ac was over-represented 
in NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, the H3K27me3 was over-represented in glutathione redox path-
ways (Fig. 5). Nrf2 has been reported as an important transcription factor involved in the induction of the 
scavenger receptor CD36 in murine macrophages and antioxidant stress genes in atherosclerosis68, hence 
epigenetic-mediated activation of this pathway may be involved in the establishment of the CIH-induced 
pro-atherogenic macrophage phenotype. In turn, glutathione redox pathway is one of the mechanisms that coun-
teract reactive oxygen species levels69, and current findings suggest that it may be epigenetically repressed upon 
CIH-exposure. Taken together, our results are compatible with the concept that epigenetic regulation of oxidative 
stress pathways in aorta macrophages of mice exposed to CIH might modulate the response in a pathway specific 
manner, and may dictate the extent of recovery potential upon discontinuation of CIH. Further molecular and 
cellular experiments are warranted to unravel the precise regulatory mechanisms and their role in the formation 
of the atherosclerosis plaque.
