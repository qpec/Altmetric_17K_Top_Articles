IMPORTANCE The requirement of a childhood onset has always been a key criterion for the
diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, but recently this
requirement has become surrounded by controversy.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether impaired young adults with ADHD symptoms always have
a childhood-onset disorder in a population-based longitudinal study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants belonged to the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort
Study, including 5249 individuals born in Pelotas, Brazil, in 1993. They were followed up to 18
to 19 years of age, with 81.3% retention. The data analysis was performed between August 8,
2015, and February 5, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ADHD status was first ascertained at 11 years of age
using a screening instrument (hyperactivity subscale of the Strength and Difficulties
Questionnaire) calibrated for a DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis based on clinical interviews with
parents using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. At 18 to 19 years of age, ADHD
diagnosis was derived using DSM-5 criteria, except age at onset. We estimated the overlap
between these groups assessed at 11 and 18 to 19 years of age and the rates of markers of
impairment in these 2 groups compared with those without ADHD.
RESULTS At 11 years of age, childhood ADHD (C-ADHD) was present in 393 individuals (8.9%).
At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals (12.2%) fulfilled all DSM-5 criteria for young adult
ADHD (YA-ADHD), except age at onset. After comorbidities were excluded, the prevalence of
YA-ADHD without comorbidities decreased to 256 individuals (6.3%). Children with C-ADHD
had a male preponderance not observed among children without ADHD (251 [63.9%] vs 1930
[47.9%] male, P < .001), whereas the YA-ADHD group had a female preponderance (192
[39.0%] vs 1786 [50.4%] male, P < .001). Both groups had increased levels of impairment in
adulthood, as measured by traffic incidents, criminal behavior, incarceration, suicide
attempts, and comorbidities. However, only 60 children (17.2%) with ADHD continued to
have ADHD as young adults, and only 60 young adults (12.6%) with ADHD had the disorder in
childhood.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study do not support the assumption that
adulthood ADHD is necessarily a continuation of childhood ADHD. Rather, they suggest the
existence of 2 syndromes that have distinct developmental trajectories.

A
ttention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder(ADHD)hasbeen
traditionally conceptualized as a neurodevelopmen-
tal disorder. Most recently, DSM-5 included ADHD in a
specificsectionunderthisumbrella.1Onthebasissolelyofclini-
cal wisdom, DSM-III introduced ADHD criterion B, requiring
symptoms to be present before the age of 7 years, and DSM-
IV-TRaddedthatimpairmentmustalsobepresentbythissame
age.2,3Asystematicreviewoftheliterature4challengedtheutil-
ity and validity of this criterion B. The DSM-5 scientific com-
mittee decided to change the criterion to require symptoms
before 12 years of age based on evidence that this threshold
wouldcapturealmosteverycasepresentedinchildhood,with-
out increasing the prevalence rate.1,5 Furthermore, DSM-5 in-
troduced the concept of adulthood ADHD as a disorder that be-
gins in childhood and requires symptoms to be present before
12 years of age.
A recent report by Moffitt et al6 presented data that di-
vergefromthistraditionalperspective.Inarepresentativebirth
cohort followed up to 38 years of age, prevalence rates of child-
hood ADHD (C-ADHD) and adulthood disorder were in accor-
dance with estimates from the literature (6% and 3.1%, respec-
tively). However, the 2 groups had only minimal overlap: 87%
of those with adulthood ADHD did not have prior C-ADHD, and
85% of those with childhood ADHD did not continue to have
ADHD in adulthood. Castellanos,7 in an editorial about the re-
port by Moffitt et al, emphasized the urgent need for replica-
tions to confirm or challenge these data.
In the present study, we report findings from a prospec-
tive, longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort in Bra-
zil. We hypothesize that (1) prevalence rates of ADHD in child-
hood and young adulthood will be similar to that reported in
the literature, (2) individuals with C-ADHD and adulthood
ADHD will have higher levels of impairment markers than in-
dividuals without ADHD, and (3) groups will have little over-
lap. We extended the study by Moffitt et al6 by examining the
effects of comorbid disorders on ADHD continuity.
Methods
Design and Sample
Individuals enrolled in this study were participants in the 1993
PelotasBirthCohort.Allchildrenbornin1993inthecityofPelo-
tas, Brazil (5249 individuals), were assessed at multiple time
points and followed up until 18 to 19 years of age, with a re-
tention rate of 81.3%. Further information on the cohort de-
sign can be found elsewhere.8,9 The institutional review board
of the Federal University of Pelotas approved the study. Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all participants, and
all data were deidentified.
The assessment at 11 years of age included data on child
mental health using the Brazilian Portuguese Version of the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), parent report
and self-report. A subsample of 280 individuals was inter-
viewedwiththeDevelopmentandWell-BeingAssessment,and
the optimal cutoff for ADHD was estimated to be 8 or more
pointsontheSDQhyperactivityscaleasratedbyparents.10The
SDQ instrument accurately predicted ADHD diagnosis with an
area under the curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.88), and the cut-
off of at least 8 points had 85.7% sensitivity and 67.4% speci-
ficity for the diagnosis.
In the last assessment, individuals at 18 to 19 years of age
were interviewed by trained psychologists using specific mod-
ulesformajordepressivedisorder(MDD),bipolardisorder(BD),
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and social anxiety disor-
der (SAD) modified from the Mini-International Neuropsychi-
atric Interview.11 The ADHD assessment was performed with
a structured interview according to DSM-5 criteria (eTable 1 in
the Supplement).12 For the present study, we did not require
DSM-5 criterion B (age at onset) for diagnosis of young adult
ADHD(YA-ADHD).WedefinedC-ADHDaspresentwhenscores
on the SDQ hyperactivity scale (parent report) were equal or
higher to 8 points and associated with impairment, defined by
at least 1 point in the impact supplement.
We also created a secondary category defined as YA-
ADHD without comorbidities (YA-ADHD-WC), which ex-
cluded from the YA-ADHD group those individuals with co-
morbidities, including MDD, BD, GAD, SAD, and regular use of
illicit drugs. This procedure was performed for secondary
analyses to reduce confounding by these comorbidities that
are likely to occur later in life and might contribute to inatten-
tive and/or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. We also ex-
cluded these comorbidities from comparison groups without
ADHD. The comparison groups were defined as those with-
out C-ADHD for childhood comparisons (C-ADHD vs those
without C-ADHD) and those without YA-ADHD for adulthood
comparisons (YA-ADHD vs those without YA-ADHD and
YA-ADHD-WC vs those without YA-ADHD and comorbidi-
ties).
Correlates
Trained interviewers assessed correlates of tobacco use,
illicit drug use, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases,
and criminal behavior using confidential questionnaires.
Suicide attempts were evaluated as part of the assessment of
MDD. We estimated IQ with an abbreviated version of the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition.13 Further
details of assessments of correlates can be found in eTable 2
in the Supplement.
Statistical Analyses
We estimated differences between groups using χ2 tests for the
following variables: percentage male, ADHD subtype, traffic
Key Points
Question Do young adults with a DSM-5 attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis always have a
childhood-onset disorder?
Findings In this birth cohort study, 5249 individuals were
assessed for ADHD at 11 and 18 to 19 years of age. Only 60 young
adults with ADHD (12.6%) had the diagnosis in childhood.
Meaning These findings do not support the assumption that
adulthood ADHD is necessarily a continuation of childhood ADHD.

incidents, illicit drug use, smoking, criminal behavior, correc-
tional institution, comorbidities, and teenage pregnancy. We
used one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables:
personal income, years of schooling, and IQ. Effect sizes (ESs)
for continuous variables were estimated with the Cohen d. All
analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software, ver-
sion 20.0 (SPSS Inc).
Results
Prevalence and Sex Distribution
At 11 years of age, C-ADHD was present in 393 individuals
(8.9%). At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals (12.2%) ful-
filled all DSM-5 criteria for YA-ADHD, except age at onset.
After comorbidities were excluded, the prevalence of
YA-ADHD-WC decreased to 256 individuals (6.3%). Children
with C-ADHD had a male preponderance not observed among
children without ADHD (251 [63.9%] vs 1930 [47.9%] male,
P < .001), whereas the YA-ADHD group had a female prepon-
derance (192 [39.0%] vs 1786 [50.4%] male, P < .001). This dif-
ference persisted after excluding comorbidities (115 males
[44.9%] in the group with YA-ADHD-WC and 1479 males
[51.5%] in the group without YA-ADHD-WC, P = .045) (Table).
Persistence and Overlap
Among the 393 children in the C-ADHD group, 60 (15.3%) con-
tinued to have YA-ADHD (31 [7.9%] with at least 1 comorbid-
ity and 29 [7.4%] with no comorbidity), 288 (73.3%) had no
YA-ADHD in the assessment at 18 to 19 years old, and 45 (11.5%)
were either unavailable for or lost to follow-up (Figure 1), re-
sulting in a persistence rate of 17.2%. Furthermore, most in-
dividualswithC-ADHDpresentedwithfewsymptomsinyoung
adulthood (Figure 2), making it unlikely that a lower symp-
tom cutoff would substantially change this result.
Among the 492 individuals in the YA-ADHD group, 60
(12.2%) had C-ADHD, 416 (84.6%) did not have C-ADHD, and
16 (3.3%) were not assessed with the SDQ at 11 years of age,

resulting in a prevalence of 12.6% of C-ADHD among the
YA-ADHD group. Considering the 256 individuals in the
YA-ADHD-WC group, 29 (11.3%) had C-ADHD, 220 (85.9%) did
not have C-ADHD, and 7 (2.7%) had not been assessed with the
SDQ at 11 years of age (Figure 1), resulting in a prevalence of
11.6% of C-ADHD among the YA-ADHD-WC group. See also the
secondary analyses in eTables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplement,
checking the robustness of our findings.
YA-ADHD Presentation
Inattentive presentation prevailed in all groups in young adult-
hood: those with C-ADHD who continued to have YA-ADHD
(31 [51.7%]), YA-ADHD (262 [53.3%]), and YA-ADHD-WC (151
[59.0%]) (see the Table for the other ADHD presentations).
Comorbidities and Suicide Attempts
Individuals with C-ADHD had significantly higher rates of co-
morbidities in young adulthood compared with those with-
out C-ADHD. At 18 to 19 years of age, rates of MDD (24 [7.2%]
vs 133 [3.8%], P = .003), BD (14 [4.2%] vs 52 [1.5%], P < .001),
GAD (36 [10.8%] vs 255 [7.2%], P = .02), SAD (34 [10.2%] vs 228
[6.5%], P = .01), illicit drug use (37 [10.8%] vs 243 [6.8%],
P = .007), and tobacco smoking (83 [25.9%] vs 448 [13.3%],
P < .001) were all higher in the C-ADHD group. The YA-ADHD
group had even higher levels of comorbidities, which were also
significantly different from those of individuals without YA-
ADHDforMDD(66[13.6%]vs93[2.7%],P < .001),BD(36[7.4%]
vs 32 [0.9%], P < .001), GAD (121 [24.9%] vs 179 [5.1%],
P < .001), SAD (98 [20.2%] vs 175 [5%], P < .001), and tobacco
smoking (87 [19%] vs 457 [13.7%], P = .003). However, we did
not find significant differences for illicit drug use (44 [9%] vs
246 [7%], P = .11). A self-reported suicide attempt in young
adulthood was more likely among children with ADHD than
in children without ADHD (35 [10%] vs 213 [6%], P = .003) and
among the YA-ADHD group than young adults without ADHD
(75 [15.2%] vs 180 [5.1%], P < .001). The difference remained
significant even after excluding comorbidities (17 [6.6%] in the
group with YA-ADHD-WC vs 101 [3.5%] in the group without
YA-ADHD-WC, P = .01) (Table).

even controlling for comorbidities (12 [4.7%] in the group with
YA-ADHD-WC vs 56 [1.9%] in the group without YA-ADHD-
WC, P = .004). The C-ADHD group did not have a statistically
significant different rate of sexually transmitted diseases com-
pared with children without ADHD (10 [2.9%] vs 92 [2.6%], re-
spectively; P = .72) (Table).

Personal Income and Years of Schooling
The C-ADHD, YA-ADHD, and YA-ADHD-WC groups did not dif-
fer from those without ADHD in terms of personal income and
completed years of regular schooling.
IQ Levels
The C-ADHD and YA-ADHD groups had lower IQ levels than
those without ADHD, and this difference was larger for the
C-ADHD group (97.17 vs 89.74, ES = 0.61, P < .001) than
for the YA-ADHD (96.7 vs 95.28, ES = 0.12, P = .01) and
YA-ADHD-WC (97.68 vs 95.59, ES = 0.17, P = .008) groups.
Discussion
The notion that adulthood ADHD is necessarily a continua-
tion of C-ADHD is an established assumption in the field.
Recently, a population-based birth cohort provided initial
evidence suggesting the opposite (ie, 87% of adulthood
ADHD cases without C-ADHD).6 In the current study, we
extended the findings of Moffitt et al6 for young adults using
a similar method. We identified that, among those with
YA-ADHD that had been assessed in childhood, 416 (87.4%)
did not have C-ADHD.

Inthecurrentstudy,youngadultswithself-reportedADHD
symptoms had a consistent pattern of higher impairment than
those without YA-ADHD, as determined by rates of traffic in-
cidents, self-reported violent crimes, incarceration in correc-
tional institutions, and comorbidities, which are analogous
withpreviousfindingsintheliterature.14-17Childrenandyoung
adults with ADHD had higher rates of suicide attempts than
their counterparts without the condition, which is also in ac-
cordance with the literature.18 Because comorbidities might
be responsible for the aforementioned differences, we ran the
same analyses excluding those with co-occurring disorders
from the ADHD group and similar results emerged, suggest-
ing that comorbid disorders do not explain the adulthood
ADHD impairments.
Although the expected prevalence rate of C-ADHD is ap-
proximately 5.3%,19 we observed a notably inflated rate, ap-
proximately 8.9%. However, our estimate is similar to that re-
ported by a prevalence study20 that also used a screening
instrument. Likewise, our adulthood ADHD prevalence rate
was 12.2%, compared with a 2.5% to 5.0% prevalence rate sug-
gested by meta-analyses.21,22 It is likely that this difference oc-
curred because of the lower symptom cutoff required by the
DSM-5 and because we did not require a childhood age at on-
set to make the diagnosis. Indeed, a previous report12 in the
same population found an ADHD prevalence rate of 3.5% using
the age-at-onset criterion. Our estimate is considerably higher
than that observed in the cohort of Moffitt et al,6 in which they
reported a 3.1% prevalence of ADHD in adults, even not re-
quiring childhood age at onset. Such a difference might be ex-
plained by the fact that their sample was composed of indi-
viduals 20 years older, and there is a tendency for prevalence
to decrease with increased age.23 A lower male to female ratio
is expected in adult samples compared with child ones, but we
found a particularly low male to female ratio of 0.64:1, which
may indicate that females are overrepresented in late-onset
ADHD groups.
Our observed persistence rate of ADHD was 17.2%. This
finding matched perfectly the persistence rate estimated by a
previous meta-analysis.24 Indeed, the cohort in the study by
Moffittetal6wasthefirstpopulation-basedlongitudinalsample
toreportanextremelylowpersistencerateofadulthoodADHD
(5%). Again, the difference with our estimate was expected be-
cause the cohort in the study by Moffitt et al6 is composed of
older adults. It is important to bear in mind that our C-ADHD
group continue to present significant impairments in adult life
despite not continuing to qualify for an adulthood ADHD di-
agnosis. Three alternative hypotheses have been proposed to
explain this finding: (1) impairments are a residual effect of the
disorder, (2) impairments are owing to the effects of persis-
tentcomorbidities,and(3)thereisanillusionarybias(eg,adults
with ADHD do not perceive their ADHD symptoms). Future
studies should try to elucidate these issues.
The main strengths of our study include a large repre-
sentative sample not biased by clinical referral. Trained
interviewers assessed our study participants at 11 and 18 to
19 years of age with substantial retention. Thus, we were
able to report estimates of the overlap between ADHD in
children and in adults, as well as their correlates, with rea-
sonable accuracy. On the other hand, some methodologic
limitations should be taken into account in the interpreta-
tion of the results. First, diagnosis of C-ADHD was made
using a screening instrument (SDQ hyperactivity scale).
However, psychologists using the Development and Well-
Being Assessment in a subsample of 280 individuals vali-
dated the SDQ hyperactivity scale cutoff scores against
ADHD diagnosis in clinical interviews.10 In addition, we
checked a lower cutoff score that continued yielding signifi-
cant lack of C-ADHD in those with YA-ADHD.
Second, we relied only on parent reports for C-ADHD
and self-report for YA-ADHD. This might artificially increase
diagnostic disagreement because of different information
sources. However, when self-reported SDQ hyperactivity
scores in childhood were used, both YA-ADHD groups
(YA-ADHD and YA-ADHD-WC) were far below the threshold
for C-ADHD diagnosis according to parent reports (score of
8), confirming that the individuals in the YA-ADHD group
had few ADHD symptoms in childhood. In addition, these
assessment procedures reflect more accurately what fre-
quently occurs in clinical practice, where C-ADHD diagnosis
relies much more on parent reports and adulthood ADHD
diagnosis on self-report.25 One could also question whether,
if we had used parent reports of adulthood ADHD, a different
group of ADHD cases in adulthood would have been identi-
fied. However, several previous investigations have found
high agreement between self-reports and parent reports for
ADHD diagnosis in adults.26 Moreover, our ADHD cases
defined by self-report have a clinical, comorbidity, and
impairment profile similar to the one previously described
for the disorder in adulthood. Finally, a recent report27 sug-
gests that even adult patients fulfilling DSM-5 ADHD diagno-
sis by self-report, for whom other informants did not report
ADHD symptoms in childhood, have the same clinical profile
and response to treatment as those whose coinformants
described ADHD symptoms in childhood.
Third, we did not have a formal diagnosis of some psychi-
atric disorders that could be the primary source of inatten-
tion and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity in adults, such as sub-
stance use disorders and personality disorders. Along the same
line, diagnoses were ascertained with a structured interview
rather than clinical judgment. Hence, the alternative expla-
nation that another disorder might explain symptoms and im-
pairment better than ADHD itself cannot be completely ruled
out. However, 256 (6.3%) of the adult sample had ADHD with-
out 4 important and frequent comorbidities or illicit drug use,
and those individuals remained impaired compared with in-
dividuals without ADHD and comorbidities.
Fourth, our impairment measure was based only on the
participant’
s perspective; a rater-derived score based on func-
tionalcorrelateswasnotused.However,physicianstendtosee
young adult patients without parents and to rely on self-
perception about impairment more than on scales.
Fifth, our results in a community sample cannot be ex-
trapolated to clinical samples in which most cases tend to be
ADHD combined type with at least moderate severity. A final
potential bias in our study, which indeed is inherent to most
population-based studies in psychiatry, is the so-called

false-positive paradox that occurs when the rate of false-
positive results based on the instrument used to assess the dis-
order is higher than the incidence of cases in the population.
Conclusions
In light of these findings, along with the study’
s strengths and
limitations, we can draw some meaningful implications for
practice and research. Above all, our findings do not support
the premise that adulthood ADHD is always a continuation of
C-ADHD. Rather, they suggest the existence of 2 syndromes
that have distinct developmental trajectories, with a late on-
set far more prevalent among adults than a childhood onset.
This finding would not mean that ADHD could not be concep-
tualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Neurodevelop-
mental disorders may have a later onset, as is the case for
schizophrenia.28 In both clinical practice and research, it is im-
portant to differentiate early- and late-onset disorders, and fu-
ture investigations should test whether they have different
pathophysiologic mechanisms, treatment response, and prog-
nosis. In addition, patients with late-onset adulthood ADHD
have clear impairments, and their clinical profile cannot ac-
count for only the effect of comorbidities.
