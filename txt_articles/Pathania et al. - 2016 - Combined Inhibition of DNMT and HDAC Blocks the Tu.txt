Abstract
Recently, impressive technical advancements have been
made in the isolation and validation of mammary stem cells
and cancer stem cells (CSC), but the signaling pathways that
regulate stem cell self-renewal are largely unknown. Further-
more, CSCs are believed to contribute to chemo- and radio-
resistance. In this study, we used the MMTV-Neu-Tg mouse
mammary tumor model to identify potential new strategies for
eliminating CSCs. We found that both luminal progenitor and
basal stem cells are susceptible to genetic and epigenetic mod-
ifications,
which
facilitate
oncogenic
transformation
and
tumorigenic potential. A combination of the DNMT inhibitor
5-azacytidine and the HDAC inhibitor butyrate markedly
reduced CSC abundance and increased the overall survival
in this mouse model. RNA-seq analysis of CSCs treated with
5-azacytidine plus butyrate provided evidence that inhibition
of chromatin modifiers blocks growth-promoting signaling
molecules such as RAD51AP1 and SPC25, which play key roles
in DNA damage repair and kinetochore assembly. Moreover,
RAD51AP1 and SPC25 were significantly overexpressed in
human breast tumor tissues and were associated with reduced
overall patient survival. In conclusion, our studies suggest that
breast CSCs are intrinsically sensitive to genetic and epigenetic
modifications and can therefore be significantly affected by
epigenetic-based therapies, warranting further investigation of
combined DNMT and HDAC inhibition in refractory or drug-
resistant breast cancer. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3224–35. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Cancer stem cells (CSC), a small subpopulation of cells within
tumors, have a characteristic feature of self-renewal, a process that
drives tumorigenesis and differentiation contributing to cellular
heterogeneity in tumors. CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy and are considered a major obstacle in cancer
treatment (1–3). This results in relapse of breast cancer in about
20%–45% of patients within years or decades after treatment.
Thus, an effective cancer therapy requires elimination of all
tumorigenic cells in the tumor (4). Breast tumors contain a
heterogeneous population of cells such as neoplastic epithelial
cells, mesenchymal stem cells, infiltrating immune cells, cancer-
associated fibroblasts, angiogenic vascular cells, and erythrocytes
(5). However, the molecular mechanisms that reprogram normal
stem cells into abnormal CSCs are poorly understood.
Stem cells have much longer life span compared with their
progeny and therefore, have a greater opportunity to accumulate
genetic mutations (6). Hematopoietic stem cells provide the best
evidence that normal stem cells could be the target of transform-
ing genetic mutations, which can render them independent of
growth signals and undergo uncontrolled proliferation and
tumorigenesis. Recent studies have shown that epigenome also
plays an important role in cancer initiation and propagation by
regulating stem cells (7, 8). For example, ARID1A, a member of
SWI/SNF family, is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers;
however, this mutation does not directly stimulate tumor forma-
tion, rather it determines the epigenetic changes that lead totumor
propagation (9). Thus, the tumorigenic potential of ARID1A
resides in its ability to alter the epigenetic profile rather than the
DNA sequence. In this context, our recent studies have shown that
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays a critical role in the
maintenance of mammary stem/progenitor cells and CSCs (10).
Using mammary gland–specific Dnmt1-knockout mice, we have
shown that DNMT1 is indispensable for mammary stem cells
(MaSC) formation and that Dnmt1 deletion protects mice from
mammary tumorigenesis by limiting CSC pool (10). Therefore,

 targeting the epigenetic modifiers like DNA methylation offers a
promising treatment option for human cancers.
Epigenetic modifications represent early events in tumorigen-
esis (11, 12). Interestingly, unlike genetic mutations, the epige-
netic alterations are reversible as proven by the reexpression of
tumor suppressor genes by DNMT inhibitors (13). 5-azacytidine
(5-AzaC, Vidaza) and 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine (5-AzaDC, decita-
bine) are the most successful epigenetic drugs that are most widely
used in clinics (14, 15). However, their use is restricted due to their
toxicity and poor stability. Interestingly, combinations of 5-AzaC
or 5-AzaDC with histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACi) have
been approved by FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA)
for treatment of hematologic malignancies (16). HDACs are
upregulated in a wide variety of cancers, and HDACi have long
been studied in clinical settings. These inhibitors produce a global
effect on the level of acetylation of histone proteins (17). Our
recent studies have shown that a combination therapy using
5-AzaC plus butyrate targets CSCs (10). However, the impact of
this drug combination on CSCs at genome level has not been
investigated. In the current study, we provide evidence that a
combination of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors not only reduces the
tumor mass but also targets CSCs and differentially regulates
genes that are involved in tumor growth. Thus, this combination
could be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for breast
cancer treatment. As this combination reduces the pool of drug-
resistant CSCs, it can also be used to treat breast cancer patients
who have developed resistance to hormone therapies such as
trastuzumab.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The human breast cancer cell line, CAL51, was obtained from
the DSMZ (Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Micro-
organisms and Cell Cultures) in October 2011. MCF10A4, an
invasive breast cancer cell line, was kindly provided by Dr. Fred
Miller at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI)
in April 2009. The mouse mammary tumor cell line 4T1 was
obtained from ATCC in July 2011. Cell lines from ATCC and
DSMZ have been thoroughly tested and authenticated and mor-
phology, karyotyping, and PCR-based approaches were used to
confirm the identity of the cell lines. CAL51 cells were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, glutamine (1%), and pen-
icillin (1%). MCF10A4 cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media
supplemented with Donor horse serum (5%), glutamine (1%),
penicillin (1%), EGF (20 ng/mL), insulin (10 mg/mL), and hydro-
cortisone (500 ng/mL). 4T1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine (1%), and penicillin
(1%). All these cell lines have been routinely tested for myco-
plasma contamination using the Universal Mycoplasma Detec-
tion Kit obtained from ATCC and the last mycoplasma test was
performed in July 2014. Mycoplasma-free cell lines were used in
all of our experiments.
Animals
Balb/cAnNCr (Stock #01B05) mice were obtained from the
National Cancer Institute. FVB/NJ (Stock #001800), MMTV-Neu-
Tg (Stock #005038), athymic Balb/c (Nu/Nu, Stock #007870),
and NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (Stock #00557) mice were
obtained from Jackson Laboratories. All these mice were bred and
maintained in Augusta University Animal Facility in accordance
with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Drug treatment
For syngeneic tumor transplant studies, 4T1 cells (0.1 � 106)
were injected into the mammary fat pad of Balb/c mice. Twenty-
four hours after the tumor cell injection, 5-AzaC (0.5 mg/21-days
release) and butyrate (10 mg/21-day release) tablets were
implanted using trochar (Innovative Research of America). Sim-
ilarly, in another group of mice, 24 hours after transplantation,
salinomycin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) treatment
was initiated. For in vitro studies, cells were treated with 5-AzaC
(1 mg/mL), 5-AzaDC (1 mg/mL), TSA (100 nmol/L), butryate
(1 mmol/L), and salinomycin (1 mg/mL).
RNA-seq analysis
RNA samples extracted from mammospheres and tumoro-
spheres were subjected to cDNA library construction (ScriptSeq
RNA-Seq Preparation v2 from Epicenter). The quality of the
sample was checked using Agilent Bioanalyzer and then subjected
to Illumina sequencing using HiSeq 2000 (paired end 50 cycles
V3). CASAVA1.8.2 was used to generate fastq files. To analyze the
genome, we used Top Hat 2.0.1 software and detected the dif-
ferential expression of transcripts (Cuffdiff/Cufflink 2.2.0). We
detected raw mapped reads and normalized reads per kilobase per
million mapped reads.
Details for single-cell preparation from mammary gland, gen-
eration of mammospheres and tumorospheres, flow cytometry,
immunofluorescence staining and microscopic imaging, RNA
isolation and real-time PCR, cell cycle, and clonogenic assays are
given in Supplementary Materials section.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using Student t test with two-
tail distribution by GraphPad Software. Biologic function
and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out using
DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), UCSC Cancer Browser
(https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/proj/site/hgHeatmap/), and
Ingenuity

software.
GraphPad,
Sigma Plot, and Excel were used to draw figures. Kaplan–
Meier analyses were used to determine group differences in
tumor-free survival (http://kmplot.com/analysis/). The web
interface of GOBO was used (http://co.bmc.lu.se/gobo/) for
gene set analysis and coexpressed genes.
Results
Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells have tumor-propagating and
metastatic potential
To distinguish normal MaSC and cancer-propagating stem cells
(CSC), we isolated mammary stem/progenitor enriched cell
populations from normal mammary glands (16-week-old) and
CSC cells from tumor tissues of MMTV-Neu-Tg mice (9-month-
old) using CD24/CD49f cell-surface markers. We observed
three distinct cell populations in normal mammary glands:
Lin�CD49fhighCD24þ (basal myoepithelial stem cells), Lin�
CD49fþCD24high
(luminal
progenitor
cells),
and
Lin�
CD49f�CD24� (stromal cells). In contrast, there were only two
distinct cell populations in tumor tissues: (Lin�CD49fþCD24þ
and Lin�CD49f�CD24�; Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the

 expression of CD49f and CD24 was dramatically increased in
tumor tissues compared with normal mammary glands. Previous
studies have shown that only a few cells within the tumor, the
CSCs, are tumorigenic and possess the metastatic phenotype (18,
19).
Thus,
to
test
the
tumor-forming
potential
of
Lin�
CD49fþCD24þ and Lin�CD49f�CD24� cells, we injected these
cells into mammary fat pad of 12-week-old NOD/SCID mice.
As shown in Fig. 1C, Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells were able to
form tumors while the Lin�CD49f�CD24� cells were not.
Furthermore,
we investigated
the
self-renewal
capacity
of
Lin�CD49fþCD24þ and Lin�CD49f�CD24� cells, using tumoro-
sphere-forming (primary and secondary) and tumor-forming
potentials (serial dilution, 102-105 cells). Lin�CD49fþCD24þ
cells were able to form tumorospheres and tumors (as few as
102 cells) but Lin�CD49f�CD24� cells were unable to form either
tumorospheres or tumors (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1A–
S1C). We also tested the mammosphere-forming potential of the
three distinct cell populations that were isolated from the normal
mammary glands and found that Lin�CD49fhighCD24þ cells
form larger size mammospheres than the Lin�CD49fþCD24low
cells, while Lin�CD49f�CD24� cells were unable to form spheres
(Supplementary Fig. S1D).
To test the metastatic potential of Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells,
we serially diluted these cells and injected into 12-week-old
NOD/SCID mice. As shown in Fig. 1E, the Lin�CD49fþCD24þ
cells (0.1 � 106) were able to form metastatic lesions in the
Figure 1.

of mice that were injected with Lin�CD49f�CD24� cells. These
findings suggest that Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells could play a
critical role in driving tumor metastasis to distant organs.
Overall, these results provide evidence that Lin�CD49fþCD24þ
cells are tumor-propagating and metastasis-driving CSCs.
Luminal progenitor and basal myoepithelial stem cells equally
contribute to mammary tumor development
Despite ample evidence showing that cancer arises from
populations of self-renewing stem cells, cancer can also arise
from progenitor cells that originate from stem cells. For exam-
ple, a mutation that enhances b-catenin signaling in granulo-
cyte–macrophage progenitor cells causes a blast crisis in
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (20). This suggests
that the mutated progenitor cells acquire the ability of self-
renewal, a feature thought to be specific to stem cells, and
undergo unlimited growth as cancer cells. To test the cell of
origin in mammary tumorigenesis, either from basal myoe-
pithelial stem cells or luminal progenitor cells, we used MMTV-
Neu-Tg mouse. About 50%–60% of MMTV-Neu-Tg mice devel-
op spontaneous mammary tumors after acquiring either addi-
tional mutations or epigenetic modifications (21). We analyzed
different cell populations in mouse mammary glands of
MMTV-Neu-Tg premalignant mice (3- to 12-month-old) with
no palpable tumors. Surprisingly, some mice as young as 3-
month-old showed an abrupt increase in luminal progenitor
population (Lin�CD49fþCD24high), whereas some 12-month-
old mice did not show this abnormal phenotype (Fig. 2A),
suggesting that these luminal progenitor cells might have
undergone genetic/epigenetic modifications.
To test whether this abnormal cell population leads to
formation of mammary tumor, we injected different cell types
(Lin�CD49fhighCD24þ,
Lin�CD49fþCD24high
and
Lin�
CD49f�CD24�) into mammary fat pad and found that both
transformed basal myoepithelial stem cells and luminal pro-
genitor cells were able to form mammary tumors around 120
and 100 days, respectively, whereas the Lin�CD49f�CD24�

 cells were unable to form mammary tumors (Fig. 2B and D and
Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). The transformed luminal
progenitor cells exhibit earlier onset of mammary tumorigen-
esis with accelerated tumor growth than the basal myoepithe-
lial stem cells (Fig. 2B and D and Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B). Interestingly, tumors that developed from MMTV-Neu-
Tg basal myoepithelial and luminal progenitor cell types are
indistinguishable from the spontaneous tumors that develop
in MMTV-Neu-Tg mice, indicating the stem cell–like property
of self-renewal (Supplementary Fig. S2C). To confirm this
observation further, we stained the tumors derived from basal
myoepithelial stem cells and luminal progenitor cells and
found that both tumors express keratin 14, basal epithelial
markers, and keratin 8, luminal epithelial markers (Fig. 2E).
We confirmed this observation further with additional basal
epithelial markers (p63 and Nestin) and luminal epithelial
marker (Gata3; Supplementary Fig. S2D; ref. 22). These results
confirmed that Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells are tumorigenic
and that both transformed basal myoepithelial stem cells
and luminal progenitor cells were able to form mammary
tumors.
Transformed luminal progenitor and basal myoepithelial stem
cells are susceptible to treatment with DNMT and HDAC
inhibitors
As shown in Fig. 2, both luminal progenitor and basal
myoepithelial stem cells contribute to mammary tumor devel-
opment in MMTV-Neu-Tg mice. However, previous studies
have shown that the luminal progenitors are the origin of
MMTV-Neu-Tg–driven mammary tumor (23) and that basal
stem cells are increased during later stages of the mammary
tumor development, which contributes to drug resistance and
metastasis (24, 25). Furthermore, we have shown that DNMTs,
especially DNMT1, play a critical role in regulation of luminal
progenitor and basal myoepithelial stem cells and that func-
tional inactivation of DNMT1 significantly reduces both of
these populations (10). Therefore, we analyzed the expression
of the three major DNMTs (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B)
in luminal progenitor and basal stem cells that were isolated
from premalignant MMTV-Neu-Tg mice. To confirm the purity
and free of cross contamination within the specific cell types,
we analyzed keratin 14 and keratin 8 in basal, luminal, and
stromal cells and found that there was no cross contamination
among these cell types (Fig. 3A). Then, we analyzed DNMT1,
DNMT3A, and DNMT3B in these cell populations and found
that both luminal progenitor and basal stem cells express
similar levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A but basal stem cells
express significantly more DNMT3B than luminal progenitor
cells (Fig. 3B). This suggests that DNMT3B could play a critical
role in regulation of basal stem cells. To test whether DNMT
inhibitors have any effect in these populations, we generated
tumorospheres from the tumor tissues derived from MMTV-
Neu-Tg mice and treated with pan-DNMTs inhibitors 5-AzaC
and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-AzaDC). We also used HDACi
TSA and butyrate (But), either alone or in combination
with DNMT inhibitors. We used salinomycin (Salino), the
known stem cell inhibitor, as a positive control. We found
that DNMT and HDACi significantly reduced CSCs (Fig. 3C
and D) but the combination of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors
(5-AzaC þ But) had much more profound effect in reducing
CSC populations.
We then tested whether the combination of 5-AzaC and buty-
rate can inhibit CSC signature in human breast cancer cell lines
using two metastatic human breast cancer cell lines, MCF10A4
(26) and CAL51 (27), and one mouse metastatic mammary
tumor cell line, 4T1 (28). We generated tumorospheres in the
presence and absence of 5-AzaC and butyrate. This combination
significantly reduced CSC pool (Fig. 3E and F) and colony
formation (Fig. Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). To confirm
the efficacy of this combination in vivo, we implanted 4T1 cells
into mammary fat pad of Balb/c mice and then treated with
5-AzaC þ butyrate as a combination therapy. Salinomycin was
used as a positive control. We found that 5-AzaC þ butyrate
significantly increased the overall survival compared with salino-
mycin treatment (Fig. 3G). Overall, these results provide evidence
that DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of
CSCs in MMTV-Neu-Tg–driven mammary tumor and that DNMT
and HDAC inhibitors can be used as a combination therapy to
reduce CSC pool.
Treatment with DNMT and HDAC inhibitors differentially
regulates genes that are involved in basal stem cell–driven
breast cancer
To test the efficacy of 5-AzaC þ butyrate on CSCs, we iso-
lated Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells from MMTV-Neu-Tg mouse
and injected into NOD/SCID mice (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Single-cell suspension prepared from the secondary tumors,
which were derived from these mice, were then used to generate
three-dimensional (3D) cultures. These 3D cultures were treated
with 5-AzaC (1 mg/mL) plus butyrate (1 mmol/L) for 72 hours.
This provided a unique opportunity to study the therapeutic
efficacy of 5-AzaC and butyrate on self-renewing CSCs (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4). We isolated RNA and performed RNA-seq
analysis. We found that 5-AzaC þ butyrate combination differ-
entially regulated genes that are involved in cell cycle, cell
division, kinetochore formation, chromosome segregation,
and mitosis (Fig. 4A and B). Using the Ingenuity System
Database (IPA) software, we analyzed signaling pathways
using the differential gene expression that were altered signif-
icantly at or above P < 0.05 level between control and treated
groups. This analysis identified cancer and organismal injury
and abnormalities as the top two disease and disorders path-
ways that were altered significantly (Fig. 4C). As IPA showed a
close association of genes that are affected in cancer, we per-
formed in-depth molecular and functional analyses that are
related to cancer. Interestingly, the top molecular functions
altered were cell-to-cell signaling, cellular movement and cell
morphology, cell-cycle regulation, programmed cell death,
DNA replication, posttranslational modification, and molecu-
lar transport (Fig. 4D).
We then investigated gene expression signature in different
breast cancer subtypes using UCSC cancer genome browser to
create heatmap for genes that were differentially expressed
between untreated and treated (5-AzaC þ butyrate) groups.
Interestingly, genes that were downregulated by 5-AzaC þ buty-
rate were significantly increased in human breast cancer samples,
whereas genes that were induced by 5-AzaC þ butyrate were
decreased in different breast cancer samples (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Furthermore, we found that expression of RAD51AP1,
NUSAP1, and SPC25 was very high in basal breast cancer subtype
compared with other subtypes. This suggests that these genes
could play a critical role in basal stem cell–driven breast cancer. To

 validate these observations, we selected two genes (RAD51AP1
and SPC25) and analyzed the expression of these genes in treated
and untreated groups. Combination of 5-AzaC þ butyrate inhib-
ited RAD51AP1 gene expression (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table
S1). Previous studies have shown that RAD51AP1 is associated
with DNA double strand break repair and homologous recom-
bination (29, 30). Many cancer drugs produce DNA lesions at
replication fork; cancer cells might use RAD51, RAD51AP1, and
other homologous recombination proteins to repair double
strand breaks and maintain the cellular integrity. It has been
shown that cell's ability to repair double strand breaks signifi-
cantly affects the outcome of cancer treatment, whereas cells
deficient in homologous recombination and DNA damage repair
mechanisms are hypersensitive to drug-induced cell death, result-
ing in a better chemotherapeutic response and outcome (31).
RAD51AP1 is highly expressed in basal breast cancer
Using the UCSC cancer genome browser and GOBO gene
enrichment application, we investigated RAD51AP1 expression
in normal and various breast cancer subtypes. We found that
RAD51AP1 expression was significantly higher in breast cancer,
especially in the basal subtype, than in normal mammary tissue
(Fig. 5A). Further detailed analysis of GOBO gene enrichment
analysis revealed that RAD51AP1 gene expression is higher in
triple-negative basal cell types and in HER-2–positive breast
cancer in comparison with hormone-responsive luminal subtypes

 (Figs. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Next, we investigated
RAD51AP1 gene expression in human tumor subtypes and
PAM50 tumor subtypes and found that basal cells express higher
levels of this gene (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6B). ER-
negative human breast tumor subtype expresses high levels of
RAD51AP1 (Supplementary Fig. S6C). GSA tumor analysis of
RAD51AP1 gene indicates high expression of this gene in grade III
histologic tumor types (Fig. 5C). To understand the prognostic
value of RAD51AP1 in overall survival, we investigated the
Kaplan–Meier plotter integrative bioinformatics interface analysis
and found a significant correlation between high RAD51AP1
expression and poor disease-free survival (Fig. 5D). To analyze
the expression status of RAD51AP1 in human breast cancer cell
lines, we investigated RAD51AP1 mRNA expression levels across
different breast cancer cell lines using the GOBO gene enrichment
cell line application. We found that triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) cell lines expressed higher levels of this gene than other
cell lines (Fig. 5F). Overall, these findings suggest that the com-
bination of 5-AzaC þ butyrate targets RAD51AP1, which in turn
affects basal stem cell formation and reduces tumor growth.
SPC25 expression is high in basal breast cancer
To establish the rationale for targeting genes that are in-
volved in basal stem cell–driven breast cancer, we also inves-
tigated the functional significance of SPC25 in human breast
cancer and how the expression of this gene responds to 5-AzaC
þ butyrate treatment (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
SPC25 is an essential component of kinetochore-associated
NDC80 complex (32). It has been well established that kinet-
ochore function is important for chromosome segregation

 during mitosis and for maintenance of chromosome stability
(33). Furthermore, chromosomal instability is one of the major
causes of heterogeneity observed in various human cancers
(34). We first tested the expression profile of SPC25 between
normal and various breast cancer subtypes using UCSC cancer
genome browser and GOBO gene enrichment application. We
found that SPC25 expression was significantly increased in
HER2-positive and basal tumors compared with normal coun-
terparts (Fig. 6A). SPC25 expression was particularly high in
basal tumor types, which represents more stem-like cells (Fig.
6B). Similar to RAD51AP1 gene, SPC25 gene is also highly
expressed in basal, ER-negative tumors (Fig. 6B and Supple-
mentary Fig. S7A). GSA tumor analysis shows higher histologic
grade and poor prognosis with higher expression of SPC25 (Fig.
6C). To understand the prognostic value of SPC25 in overall
survival, we used the Kaplan–Meier plotter analysis and found
a significant positive correlation between high SPC25 expres-
sion and poor disease-free survival (Fig. 6D). Finally, we
checked the expression of SPC25 across the human breast
cancer cell lines. We found that TNBC cell lines had high level
of SPC25 expression (Fig. 6E and F). Although RAD51AP1 and
SPC25 expressions were high in human breast tumor tissues
and cell lines and their expression downregulated by 5-AzaC
and butyrate, we do not have data to show that RAD51AP1 and
SPC25 expressions are directly regulated by DNA methylation
or histone acetylation. Further studies are needed to address
this issue.
Discussion
Breast CSCs have been successfully isolated from human breast
tumor tissues and from tumors from various spontaneous mouse
mammary tumor models. In our studies, we used CD24 and
CD49f cell-surface markers mainly because these two markers are
commonly expressed in both human and murine cancers and also
in various spontaneous mouse mammary tumor models.
Although these two markers do not yield pure luminal progenitor
and basal stem cell populations, our studies provide evidence that
CD49fhighCD24þ cells exclusively express K14 (a marker for basal
myoepithelial stem cells) and that CD49fþCD24high cells express

 K8 (a marker for luminal progenitor cells) without any cross
contamination (Fig. 2E). In our recently published studies, we
also used CD61 marker to differentiate mature myoepithelial,
mature luminal, and luminal progenitor cells (10). However, all
these three cell surface markers (CD49f, CD24, and CD61) are
unable to distinguish the normal MaSCs and CSCs. Additional
studies are warranted to find new cell-surface markers that are
capable of distinguishing between MaSCs and CSCs.
Previous studies have shown that a large majority of
mammary tumors, including the mammary tumors that
develop in MMTV-Neu-Tg mouse (19), are derived from the
luminal progenitor cell type (18, 21) rather than from the
basal cell type. However, a recent study has shown that
mammary tumors that develop in MMTV-Neu-Tg mouse can
originate from both luminal and basal cell types (35).
Although our present studies reinforce the previous observa-
tions, our findings provide further evidence that tumors
originating from the basal cell types are relatively slow
growing and are responsible for metastatic progression. Fur-
thermore, our studies provide evidence that both luminal and
basal cells require additional mutations to activate the unac-
tivated Neu-Tg to become the tumorigenic phenotype (Figs.
2A-C and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). This suggests
that a small portion of basal stem cell population may
acquire mutations or epigenetic modifications and serve as
the cancer-initiating stem cells in Neu-Tg–induced mammary
tumor and that such cells are capable of dedifferentiating into
luminal cells. This is supported by the observation that
tumors derived from the basal cell type express both K8 and
K14, suggesting a transition of basal stem cells into early
luminal progenitors (Fig. 2E).
One of the most interesting and unexpected findings of our
study is that basal stem and luminal progenitor cells isolated
from the premalignant mammary gland of younger mice (3-
month-old) were able to propagate mammary tumor in NOD/
SCID mice while same cell types isolated from older mice (12-
month-old) were unable to form tumors. This suggests that,
irrespective of the age, genetic/epigenetic events lead to acti-
vation of unactivated Neu-Tg into a transformed mammary
tumor–forming phenotype along with reprogramming of the
stem/progenitor cells into tumor-propagating cancer stem cells.
This is surprising because aging is the single biggest risk factor
for tumor development; however, our studies provide evidence
that genetic/epigenetic modifications reprogram the basal

 myoepithelial stem cells and luminal progenitor cells into
tumor-propagating CSCs and play a critical role in tumor
development. Furthermore, tumors derived from both luminal
and basal cell types of premalignant MMTV-Neu-Tg mice
showed similar self-renewing tumor-propagating CSC pheno-
type (Fig. 2B–D and Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition,
tumors developed from these two cell types were indistinguish-
able from the spontaneous tumors that developed in MMTV-
Neu-Tg mice, suggesting that basal cell type has similar tumor-
propagating capability as luminal cell type and that this tumor-
propagating potential of basal cell type could have a great
impact in drug resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer
patients treated with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab targets only
HER2-positive luminal progenitor cells but not HER2-negative
basal myoepithelial stem cells, which are multipotent and
quiescent in tumor. This raises the possibility that during
chemotherapy, especially in trastuzumab therapy, the tumor-
igenic basal myoepithelial stem cells escape or become unre-
sponsive to the therapy and then enter into circulation and
ultimately lead to tumor metastasis. This is further supported
by the previous findings that demonstrated the increased basal
cell populations in HER2-resistant tumor after chemotherapy
(23, 36). Therefore, it is obligatory to target both transformed
luminal progenitor cells and basal myoepithelial stem cells
when selecting chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.
Our findings also provide evidence that Lin�CD49fþCD24þ
cells are metastatic. We used 4T1 cell line, a metastatic cancer cell
line that mimics grade IV human breast cancer (36), to test the
metastatic potential of Lin�CD49fþCD24þ cells. 4T1 cell line
was established from the myoepithelial cells of a sponta-
neous mutation-driven mouse mammary tumor (37). Previous
studies showed that basal myoepithelial cells are leader cells
and that the basal myoepithelial enrichment program helps in
the process of metastasis (38, 39). These findings suggest that a
few basal myoepithelial stem cells dedifferentiate into tumor-
propagating luminal cell type. On the basis of these observa-
tions, we speculate that, in addition to epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), the basal tumorigenic cell types play a key
role in drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis. Further-
more, our findings provide strong evidence that the basal
myoepithelial stem cells play a critical role in metastatic spread,
either by themselves or by dedifferentiating into tumor-propa-
gating luminal cell type. Thus, 5-AzaC þ butyrate combination
could be a novel therapeutic strategy to target basal cell gene
signature.
The enhanced expression of RAD51AP1 in a majority of
breast cancers compared with normal counterparts suggests
the oncogenic role of this gene in human breast cancer. Pre-
vious studies have shown that RAD51AP1 expression is upre-
gulated in hepatocellular carcinomas (40), acute myeloid leu-
kemia with complex karyotypic abnormalities (41), and aggres-
sive mantle cell lymphoma (42). Furthermore, downregulation
of RAD51AP1 by gene-specific siRNA resulted in growth sup-
pression of cholangiocarcinoma cells. These results indicate
that RAD51AP1 expression is essential for the growth of tumor
cells and that its inhibition may be a novel therapeutic option
for the treatment of breast cancer. On the other hand, CpG
methylation of its promoter region leads to the reduced expres-
sion of RAD51AP1 in prostate cancer cells (43). Therefore, the
tumorigenic potential of RAD51AP1 may be cell type–depen-
dent. Similarly, SPC25 is highly expressed in human breast
tumor tissues and in breast cancer cell lines when compared
with normal controls. Although the role of SPC25 in tumor-
igenesis is unknown, studies have shown that it forms a
complex with NDC80, NUF2, and SPC24, localized at the
kinetochore outer plate after the G2 phase (44–47), and plays
a critical role in microtubule–kinetochore attachment and
spindle assembly checkpoint in mitosis (48). Furthermore,
genetic stability depends primarily on accurate chromosome
segregation during the cell cycle and kinetochores are essential
for this process. Thus, SPC25 function is required for tumor
cells to sustain the genomic stability by maintaining mitotic
spindle assembly for their eternal growth. Overall, our studies
demonstrate that tumor cell of origin and tumor-propagating
cells are regulated by DNA methylation and that inhibition of
DNMTs reverses the abnormal self-renewal properties of
tumor-propagating cells. Furthermore, our studies unequivo-
cally show that the combination of 5-AzaC and butyrate effi-
ciently blocks mammary tumorigenesis and reduces tumoro-
sphere-forming potential of tumor-propagating cells by reacti-
vating the tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, 5-AzaC/butyrate
combination could be an effective adjuvant therapy for the
treatment of breast cancer. This combination would not only
provide an effective strategy to prevent tumor growth but also
prevent relapse of the breast cancer.
