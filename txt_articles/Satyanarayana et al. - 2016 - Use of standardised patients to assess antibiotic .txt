Summary
Background India’s total antibiotic use is the highest of any country. Patients often receive prescription-only drugs 
directly from pharmacies. Here we aimed to assess the medical advice and drug dispensing practices of pharmacies 
for standardised patients with presumed and confi
 rmed tuberculosis in India.
Methods In this cross-sectional study in the three Indian cities Delhi, Mumbai, and Patna, we developed two 
standardised patient cases: fi
 rst, a patient presenting with 2–3 weeks of pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms (Case 1); 
and second, a patient with microbiologically confi
 rmed pulmonary tuberculosis (Case 2). Standardised patients were 
scheduled to present each case once to sampled pharmacies. We defi
 ned ideal management for both cases a priori as 
referral to a health-care provider without dispensing antibiotics or steroids or both.
Findings Between April 1, 2014, and Nov 29, 2015, we sampled 622 pharmacies in Delhi, Mumbai, and Patna. 
Standardised patients completed 1200 (96%) of 1244 interactions. We recorded ideal management (defi
 ned as referrals 
without the use of antibiotics or steroids) in 80 (13%) of 599 Case 1 interactions (95% CI 11–16) and 372 (62%) of 
601 Case 2 interactions (95% CI 58–66). Antibiotic use was signifi
 cantly lower in Case 2 interactions (98 [16%] of 601, 
95% CI 13–19) than in Case 1 (221 [37%] of 599, 95% CI 33–41). First-line anti-tuberculosis drugs were not dispensed 
in any city. The diff
 erences in antibiotic or steroid use and number of medicines dispensed between Case 1 and Case 2 
were almost entirely attributable to the diff
 erence in referral behaviour.
Interpretation Only some urban Indian pharmacies correctly managed patients with presumed tuberculosis, but most 
correctly managed a case of confi
 rmed tuberculosis. No pharmacy dispensed anti-tuberculosis drugs for either case. Absence 
of a confi
 rmed diagnosis is a key driver of antibiotic misuse and could inform antimicrobial stewardship interventions.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance is a global health emergency,1,2 
and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major 
driver.3,4 Although India ranks fi
 rst in total antibiotic use 
worldwide,2 the absence of data linking antibiotic use to 
underlying illnesses makes it hard to assess the 
appropriateness of such use in view of India’s high 
infectious disease burden. With some of the highest 
incidences of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens in the 
world, identifi
 cation of the sources and circumstances of 
antibiotic abuse as opposed to use is a crucial fi
 rst step to 
understanding what can be done about antibiotic overuse 
in India.4 Here, we develop a unique method to address 
this gap, focusing our attention on a specifi
 c illness, 
tuberculosis, and a specifi
 c source of health care—
pharmacies.
Our choice of tuberculosis, a disease that aff
 ects 
2·2 million Indians every year, as a lens through which 
to investigate antibiotic use is driven by several factors. 
The symptoms of early pulmonary tuberculosis are 
common, non-specifi
 c, non-severe, and persistent. In 
this case, assessment of pharmacist behaviour provides a 
realistic and externally valid estimate of unnecessary 
antibiotic use. Further, indiscriminate drug use can harm 
both the patient and the effi
  cacy of existing anti-tuber-
culosis treatments. For instance, tuberculosis symptoms 
subside temporarily with the use of fl
 uoroquinolones or 
corticosteroids, delaying diagnosis and leading to the 
possibility that patients receive several antibiotic courses 
for the wrong diagnosis.5 Partial courses of anti-
tuberculosis drugs can result in drug resistance.6 Finally, 
international and national guidelines for the optimum 
management of tuberculosis cases7,8 allow the assessment 
of the extent of antibiotic misuse.
Our focus on pharmacies is premised on the belief that 
their practices contribute to the availability and use of 
antibiotics in the population.4 This premise is partly the 
result of their widespread availability—more than 
750 000 private retail pharmacies provide easy access to 
drugs.9 However, our premise also refl
 ects the willingness

of pharmacists to provide prescription-only drugs to 
patients. Despite clear guidelines on the use of over-the-
counter versus prescription-only drugs,10 enforcement is 
widely believed to be suboptimum.11,12 Pharmacies are 
thought to be dispensing antibiotics and anti-tuberculosis 
drugs without prescriptions. Many tuberculosis patients 
do seek medical advice and drugs from pharmacies,13 
driven by the ease of access and the possibility of avoiding 
consultation charges by doctors.14
Tuberculosis is a major problem in all three cities 
studied (Delhi, Mumbai, and Patna), with notifi
 cation 
rates (offi
  cially reported) of 294, 210, and 77 per 100 000, 
respectively.15 However, these rates are probably 
underestimated because many cases treated in the 
private sector are not notifi
 ed.16 All three cities are 
experiencing rising rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis, 
especially in the city of Mumbai,17 and it is widely believed 
that pharmacists are a key component of the dispensing 
landscape and often a fi
 rst contact for primary care.
Guidelines for pharmacies are specifi
 ed under the 
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s Drugs and 
Cosmetics Rules Act, 1945.10 All antibiotics and steroids 
are listed under two diff
 erent schedules—Schedule H 
and Schedule H1. Schedule H drugs cannot be given to 
patients without a prescription from a qualifi
 ed 
medical practitioner. In 2013, regulations were further 
tightened, with anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, 
rifampicin, 
ethambutol, 
and 
pyrazinamide) 
and 
some fl
 uoro 
quinolones (such as moxifl
 oxacin and 
levofl
 oxacin, used in the treatment of tuberculosis) 
listed on a newly created Schedule H1. For H1 drugs, 
pharmacies require both a prescription from a qualifi
 ed 
medical practitioner and a separate register to record 
the name and address of the prescriber, the patient, the 
names of the drugs and the quantity supplied.18 
Schedule X, the most restrictive list, includes drugs 
such as narcotics, which require a prescription from a 
qualifi
 ed provider to be retained by the retailer for 
2 years.19
We have previously assessed the quality of tuberculosis 
care in India by health-care providers using standardised 
patients and use a similar method to study the practices 
of staff
  at pharmacies.20 Although standardised patients 
are routinely used to assess pharmacy practices in low-
income and high-income countries,21 to our knowledge, 
no study has used standardised patients to assess 
pharmacy practices for tuberculosis in India. In our 
previous study, we validated the use of standardised 
patients for tuberculosis and showed the viability and 
accuracy of this method for measuring quality of 
tuberculosis care along several dimensions, including 
very low likelihood of detection, minimum to no study 
participation risk for either standardised patients or 
health-care providers, and high levels of accurate recall of 
the clinical interaction among standardised patients. 
This study complements our previous validation study by 
extending the method to pharmacists. The method 
developed here addresses the dual objectives of, fi
 rst, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Antimicrobial resistance is a global health emergency, and, as 
the largest consumer of antibiotics, India is at highest risk. The 
standardised patient method can help to assess the extent and 
appropriateness of antibiotic use because such use can be 
directly related to the underlying illness of the patient. To 
identify previous research on this topic, we searched PubMed 
and Google Scholar using a combination of the terms 
“standardized patients” (“mystery clients”, “fake patients”, or 
“simulated patients”), “pharmacy” (“pharmacist” or “chemist”), 
and “tuberculosis” with and without the keyword “India” for 
articles published in English until March 31, 2015. Our search 
showed that previous studies of physician management of 
standardised patients in India have reported unnecessary 
antibiotic prescribing for various conditions, including 
tuberculosis, diarrhoea, asthma, and angina. However, these 
studies have not addressed antibiotic abuse by pharmacists, 
who respond to the health-care needs of a substantial 
proportion of India’s population.
Added value of this study 
We used standardised patients to quantify the extent of 
antibiotic overuse in pharmacists for patients with tuberculosis. 
We developed two standardised patient cases: fi
 rst, a patient 
presenting with 2–3 weeks of pulmonary tuberculosis 
symptoms (Case 1); and second, a patient with 
microbiologically confi
 rmed pulmonary tuberculosis (Case 2). 
Across all interactions, 319 (27%) of 1200 (95% CI 24–29) 
resulted in the use of an antibiotic although no pharmacy 
dispensed fi
 rst-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Ideal case 
management, defi
 ned as referrals without the use of antibiotics 
or steroids, was much lower in Case 1 interactions (13%) than 
Case 2 interactions (62%). Our study results add to the growing 
evidence on antibiotic abuse, but also underscore that the use 
and misuse of antibiotics are mediated by drug category and 
the information that patients present. Although antibiotic use 
is high and such use can delay diagnosis, none of the 
pharmacies dispensed fi
 rst-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, and the 
use of stronger fl
 uoroquinolone antibiotics and heavily 
restricted drug classes was low. Furthermore, the use of all 
antibiotics decreased sharply when the patient’s diagnosis was 
made available to the pharmacists. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Our fi
 ndings suggest that non-adherence to regulatory standards 
is higher when the patient’s condition is unknown, and that 
pharmacies prefer to treat in such cases rather than refer the 
patient to appropriate care. These fi
 ndings can inform 
interventions to engage pharmacies in tuberculosis control and 
antimicrobial stewardship.

assessment of pharmacists’ behaviour and drug use for a 
patient with a complaint, but no prescription. Second, it 
allows us to assess how case management and drug use 
diff
 ers when the diagnosis is unknown versus confi
 rmed.
Methods
Study design and setting
This cross-sectional study was done in Delhi, Mumbai, 
and Patna.
Through this multi-site study we aimed to assess the 
medical advice and drug dispensing practices of 
pharmacies for standardised patients presenting with 
either presumptive tuberculosis (Case 1) or micro-
biologically confi
 rmed tuberculosis (Case 2). By assessing 
the diff
 erence in antibiotic use across the two cases for 
the same pharmacists, we broke down the relative 
importance of antibiotic misuse arising from the lack of 
diagnosis (Case 1) versus antibiotic use despite a con-
fi
 rmed diagnosis for which antibiotics are contraindicated 
(Case 2). To set the benchmark for what pharmacists 
should do when faced with such patients, we used 
guidelines from the Government of India and the Indian 
Pharmaceutical Association. These guidelines specify 
that pharmacies should counsel patients about tuber-
culosis, identify and refer persons with tuberculosis 
symptoms to the nearest public health facilities for tuber-
culosis testing, and play a part in the provision of tuber-
culosis treatment.22 Therefore, pharmacists adhering to 
these guidelines should have referred the standardised 
patients to health-care providers without dispensing 
either antibiotics or steroids, both of which require a 
prescription.
Standardised patients
The two cases of standardised patients used in our study 
were adapted from our validation study in Delhi.15 
Standardised patients trained as Case 1 presented with 
2–3 weeks of cough and fever and were directly seeking 
drugs from a pharmacy. Diff
 erential diagnosis for this 
case 
included 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
infection, 
pneumonia, asthma and acute or chronic bronchitis; 
antibiotic use might be warranted for some of these 
conditions although not without a prescription from a 
doctor.
Standardised patients trained as Case 2 presented with 
1 month of cough and fever and a tuberculosis-positive 
laboratory report from a recent sputum smear test at a 
government dispensary. In this case, tuberculosis was 
confi
 rmed, although the standardised patients, who 
presented as uninformed patients, made it clear that they 
did not fully understand what the report said. In this 
situation, the pharmacist plausibly could know the correct 
diagnosis and could recognise that short-term antibiotics 
would not help, but also could realise that the patient 
would still purchase antibiotics if off
 ered because of their 
ignorance of the test results. Standardised patients did not 
present with drug prescriptions; table 1 shows their 
opening statements and case scenarios. After each 
pharmacy visit, standardised patients were debriefed with 
a structured questionnaire within 1 h of the visit. The 
accompanying appendix (pp 5, 6) provides more details on 
the development of the cases and the recruitment and 
characteristics of the standardised patients in the study. 
Cases are available from the authors by request.
Selection of pharmacies, standardised patient visits, 
and study size
Standardised patients visited 54 pharmacies in Delhi 
using a convenience sample from 28 low-income localities 
in April, 2014. This phase of the study validated the 
approach and provided key parameter estimates for power 
calculations employed in Mumbai and Patna. Based on 
these power calculations we sent standardised patients to 
308 randomly sampled pharmacies in Mumbai and 260 in 
Patna between Nov 5, 2014, and Nov 29, 2015. 1200 (96%)
of 1244 interactions were completed as planned, and we 
completed both cases for a sampled pharmacy in 1156 
(93%) of 1244 scheduled interactions. The appendix 
discusses the sample and sampling weights, case 
development, standardised patient recruitment, sample 
size calculations, drug identifi
 cation, and deviations from 
the sampling scheme (pp 2–8).
Case description
Presentation of standardised patient
Expected case management
Case 1
Classic case of presumed 
tuberculosis with 2–3 weeks 
of cough and fever and 
directly seeking care from a 
chemist or pharmacist
Case 1 presents with the opening statement, “Sir, I have cough and fever that is not getting better. Please give 
me some medicine.” At presentation, this case has had a 2–3 week cough, which occurred more during early 
morning and night, accompanied by a 2–3 week, on-and-off
 , low-grade fever. The patient was producing 
sputum that did not contain any blood. The case would admit to a loss of appetite and to his or her clothes 
becoming a bit loose if prompted by the chemist. If the chemist asked about taking medicines for this illness, 
the patient would say no
Verbal or written referral to a DOTS 
centre or a health-care provider 
without dispensing any antibiotics 
(including anti-tuberculosis drugs and 
fl
 uoroquinolones) or steroids
Case 2
Chronic cough with a positive 
sputum smear report for 
tuberculosis from a 
government dispensary and 
directly seeking care from a 
chemist or pharmacist
Case 2 presents with a positive sputum smear result visiting a chemist, presenting with the opening statement, 
“Sir, I am having cough for nearly a month now and also have fever.” While showing a positive sputum report 
to the chemist, the patient continues, “I went to the government dispensary and they asked me to get my 
sputum tested. I have this report. Can you please give me some medicine?” At presentation, this case has had a 
cough for 1 month and produces sputum without blood, accompanied by a 1 month, on-and-off
 , low-grade 
fever, which was more during evening times. Similar to Case 1, the case would admit to a loss of appetite and to 
his or her clothes becoming a bit loose if prompted by the chemist. If the chemist asked about taking 
medicines for this illness, the patient would say no
Verbal or written referral to a DOTS 
centre or a health-care provider 
without dispensing any antibiotics 
(including anti-tuberculosis drugs and 
fl
 uoroquinolones) or steroids

We obtained approvals from the ethics committees of 
McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada, and 
the Institute of Socio-Economic Research on Development 
and Democracy (ISERDD) in New Delhi. Both ethics 
committees approved a waiver from obtaining informed 
consent from pharmacies in Mumbai and Patna. All 
individuals who participated as standardised patients were 
hired as staff
  and trained to protect themselves from any 
harmful medical interventions, such as avoiding injections, 
invasive tests, or consuming any drugs at the pharmacy.
Statistical analysis
Our unit of analysis was a pharmacy-standardised patient 
 
interaction irrespective of who (pharmacy owners, 
pharmacists, or pharmacy assistants) the standardised 
patient interacted with. Whether the case was correctly 
managed was assessed from a tuberculosis perspective, 
consistent with Standards for Tuberculosis Care in India 
and International Standards for Tuberculosis Care.7,8 We 
regarded ideal management for both cases as verbal or 
written referral to a health-care provider (public or 
private), without dispensing any antibiotics, including 
anti-tuberculosis drugs and fl
 uoroquinolones, or steroids 
(table 1).
We calculated the proportion and 95% CI for our 
primary outcome, the proportion of interactions that 
resulted in ideal management, as well as the proportion 
of interactions resulting in antibiotic, fl
 uoroquinolone, 
and steroid use with appropriate sampling weights 
(appendix p 3).
To assess the diff
 erence in case management and the 
use of drugs across the two cases, we used a random 
intercept logit model with indicator variables for each 
city as additional controls. In view of the study design 
and since every sampled pharmacy was attempted by 
both cases, the choice of model (logit, logit with fi
 xed 
eff
 ects, or logit with random intercepts) should have 
yielded similar unbiased estimates, with diff
 erences 
arising only from the small portion of pharmacies that 
received one case but not the other. However, coeffi
  cients 
from the random-intercepts model are more precisely 
estimated. The appendix (pp 10–13) provides a series of 
alternate estimates, with both marginal eff
 ects and odds 
ratios from diff
 erent model specifi
 cations and confi
 rm 
that the results are very similar across specifi
 cations. All 
analyses were done using Stata (version 13).

Results
96 (16%) of 599 pharmacies (95% CI 13–19) referred 
Case 1 interactions to health-care providers, but because 
in 16 (17%) of these 96 cases the standardised patient was 
also given an antibiotic or steroid (95% CI 11–25), ideal 
case management (referral to a health-care provider 
without any antibiotics and steroids) occurred in 80 (13%) 
of 599 Case 1 interactions (95% CI 11–16). Overall, 
antibiotics were used in 221 (37%; 95% CI 33–41) of 
599 interactions, steroids in 45 (8%; 95% CI 6–10), and 
fl
 uoroquinolones in 61 (10%; 95% CI 8–13). Because 
Schedule H drugs also include prescription-only drugs 
that are not antibiotics or steroids (eg, ibuprofen or 
cetirizine), the use of these drugs was higher (401 [67%] of

599 interactions, 95% CI 63–71). The use of Schedule H1 
drugs was notably lower (37 [6%] of 599, 95% CI 4–8) and 
Schedule X drugs and anti-tuberculosis drugs were never 
given. Table 2 provides the mean proportions of the key 
outcome variables in all cities combined for Case 1 and 
Case 2. Since the sampling scheme was diff
 erent for 
Delhi compared with Mumbai and Patna, we also provide 
results excluding Delhi (table 2), and for each city by case 
(appendix pp 8,9).
By contrast with Case 1, 401 (67%) of 601 pharmacies 
(95% CI 63–70) referred Case 2 to a health-care provider 
(table 2). As before, some patients received antibiotics or 
steroids even with a referral, so ideal case management 
was recorded in 372 (62%) of 601 interactions (95% CI 
58–66). Antibiotics, steroids, and fl
 uoroquinolones were 
all used much less frequently, although Schedule H 
drugs were still given in 188 (31%) of 601 interactions 
(95% CI 28–35). As before, Schedule X and anti-
tuberculosis drugs were never used.
Figure 1 uses the random-intercept model together 
with indicator variables for each city to estimate the 
diff
 erence in pharmacy behaviour for the main outcome 
variables as odds ratios. All these diff
 erences were 
signifi
 cant and precisely estimated. For instance, the 
adjusted odds of pharmacies referring a standardised 
patient with a sputum smear-positive tuberculosis report 
to a health-care provider without dispensing antibiotics 
and steroids (ideal case management) was 21·03 (95% CI 
12·33–35·86; p<0·0001) for Case 2 relative to Case 1; the 
odds ratio for antibiotic use was 0·21 (0·15–0·31; 
p<0·0001) and for fl
 uoroquinolones 0·31 (0·18–0·53; 
p<0·0001). We also note that of the 497 referrals across 
the two cases, 301 (60%) were to doctors in the private 
sector and the remaining 40% were to the public sector 
(data not shown). In only three instances was the 
standardised patient referred specifi
 cally to a directly 
observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) centre.
In terms of behaviour conditional on referral, the 
diff
 erences between Case 1 and Case 2 refl
 ect, to a 
substantial degree, the large increase in referrals for 
Case 2. Figure 2 shows the proportion of interactions that 
received antibiotics or steroids, or both, or no drug 
separated by case and referral decision. Both for Case 1 
and Case 2, the use of antibiotics or steroids and the total 
number of drugs fell when the pharmacist referred the 
patient (0·75 for Case 1, 95% CI 0·48–1·02 vs 0·38 for 
Case 2, 0·29–0·46; data not shown). However, 
conditioning on the decision to refer, the diff
 erence in 
pharmacist behaviour across the two cases was much 
smaller.
The practice of pharmacies varied across cities, 
although caution is warranted in interpreting these 
results in view of the diff
 erent sampling methods used 
(appendix p 3). We noted similar patterns across the 
three cities of high use of Schedule H drugs, referrals, 
and ideal case management (fi
 gure 3). Two diff
 erences 
worth highlighting are that compared with Mumbai, the

use of antibiotics, steroids, fl
 uoroquinolones, and 
Schedule H1 drugs were all much higher in Patna; and 
that there was no fl
 uoroquinolone use in Delhi and little 
use in Mumbai compared with Patna. These diff
 erences 
are robust to adjustment for diff
 erences in the 
standardised patients used across diff
 erent cities, an 
analysis that we did by comparing outcomes only among 
the (smaller) group of standardised patients who were 
common to two or more cities (appendix pp 13,14).
In terms of type of drugs dispensed, for Case 1, 
pharmacies dispensed 2·09 drugs on average (95% CI 
1·99–2·20; fi
 gure 4). The most common classes of drugs 
dispensed were analgesics such as paracetamol and 
nimesulide, antibiotics, cough syrups, and anti-allergy 
drugs. Among antibiotics, amoxicillin was the most 
common, and 61 (10%) of 599 (95% CI 8–13) pharmacies 
dispensed fl
 uoroquinolones (eg, ciprofl
 oxacin, levo-
fl
 oxacin, ofl
 oxacin), whereas 45 (8%) of 599 gave steroids 
such as betamethasone and prednisolone (95% CI 6–10). 
For Case 2, pharmacies dispensed 0·98 drugs on average 
(95% CI 0·88–1·09). The classes of drugs dispensed for 
Case 2 were similar to Case 1, although the overall 
frequencies were much lower. This fi
 nding is again 
consistent with the result that the diff
 erence in behaviour 
between the two cases was driven, to a large extent, by the 
sharp increase in referrals for Case 2.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst study that used 
standardised patients to examine how pharmacies in 
India treat patients with tuberculosis symptoms and 
diagnosed tuberculosis, complementing our recent study 
that assessed tuberculosis management by health-care 
providers.20 Because the standardised patient method 
standardises the presentation of the underlying condition 
across diff
 erent providers,23 the results are reliable, valid, 
and comparable across pharmacies. The similar patterns 
we recorded across the three cities suggest that the 
results might be generalisable to other urban areas in 
India.
A key fi
 nding is that none of the pharmacies in our 
study dispensed fi
 rst-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. 
Concerns regarding the use of anti-tuberculosis drugs by 
pharmacies seem to be unfounded, at least in major 
cities, and pharmacies are unlikely sources of irrational 
drug use that contributes to multidrug-resistant tuber-
culosis. Why pharmacists do not dispense tuberculosis 
drugs requires further research, but the fact that 
tuberculosis drugs (unlike antibiotics such as amoxicillin) 
are considered toxic and that tuberculosis requires long-
term treatment might play a part. Proactiveness of the 
Indian National Tuberculosis Control Program in 
including tuberculosis drugs under Schedule H1 and the 
requirement to document tuberculosis drug prescriptions 
might also have reduced abuse.
However, our fi
 ndings showed that 38% of the 
pharmacies dispensed antibiotics or steroids to people 
with tuberculosis symptoms but no test results. The use 
of fl
 uoroquinolones in 7% and steroids in 5% of 
interactions is especially worrying because these drugs 
delay tuberculosis diagnosis.5,24 Additionally, fl
 uoro-
quinolones are also an essential part of multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens and emerging 
regimens, so quinolone abuse is a concern.5
The widespread use of antibiotics and steroids for 
respiratory symptoms also has implications for com-
munity-acquired infections more generally. Unnecessary 
use of fl
 uoroquinolones is a major risk factor for creating 
highly resistant Gram-negative enteric bacteria (eg, 
extended spectrum beta-lactamase resistance) that might 
cause diarrhoeal illness, bacteraemia, and other 
infections, especially in India.25 The common use of 
aminopenicillins (eg, amoxicillin) and macrolides (eg,

azithromycin) for respiratory symptoms identifi
 ed in our 
study might contribute to resistant strains of common 
respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae 
and Haemophilus infl
 uenzae.26 In addition to potentially 
delaying tuberculosis diagnosis, unnecessary use of 
steroids is associated with an increased risk of developing 
lower respiratory tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, 
and candidiasis.27
Our results also clearly show that a fi
 rst-order problem 
both in the management of tuberculosis and anti-
microbial resistance is the information that patients 
present to the pharmacist. Confi
 rmed diagnoses 
discipline what pharmacists do, with sharp increases in 
ideal management and large decreases in antibiotic use. 
This dramatic diff
 erence suggests that the main 
challenge faced by pharmacists is confusion about the 
likely diagnosis, in which case better training regarding 
tuberculosis symptoms and encouraging early referrals 
for patient with tuberculosis symptoms might help.
Lastly, our study shows the value of the standardised 
patient method in tracking inappropriate antibiotic use.28 
Although prescription audits can be used, prescriptions 
do not capture the off
 -prescription use of drugs and often 
do not include diagnoses.
Although the behaviour change in Case 2 suggests 
that pharmacists substantially decrease the use of 
unnecessary drugs when the diagnosis is known, it is 
unknown why some pharmacists give antibiotics and 
others do not; neither can we uncover the reasons why 
pharmacists are unwilling to follow regulations 
regarding drug use in these three cities. It is unclear 
whether the variation in our data is explained by the 
competence and qualifi
 cation of the person providing 
advice in pharmacies, which we did not track in the 
study. Qualitative evidence suggests that a combination 
of other factors might also be at play, including pharma-
ceutical industry marketing techniques, business 
models followed by local providers, and active demand 
from patients for medicines.11,29 Pharmacists in Delhi 
have described overstock, near-expiry, and undersupply 
as further factors precipitating misuse of antibiotics 
and restricted drugs.11
Second, we noted signifi
 cantly higher use of antibiotics 
and quinolones in Patna than in Mumbai pointing to 
some diff
 erences across cities. We are able to rule out 
that these diff
 erences refl
 ect the composition of 
standardised patients deployed across cities (appendix 
p 13), but with an eff
 ective sample size of only three 
cities, we cannot explain this variation. Also, our study 
does not provide evidence on how pharmacists in rural 
areas manage patients with tuberculosis or tuberculosis 
symptoms. Third, our study refl
 ects what happens when 
pharmacists receive a completely unknown patient as 
opposed to a known, regular client, or a client who 
returns to the pharmacist after one round of ineff
 ective 
treatment. We note though that only 5–6% of pharmacists 
asked the patient to return (if they did not feel better; 
appendix p 9). Fourth, diff
 erences between Case 1 and 
Case 2 could refl
 ect variation in the standardised patient 
profi
 le. Because diff
 erent standardised patients were 
assigned to the two cases with no crossover, we cannot 
assess this possibility. Generally, the inclusion of 
standardised patient characteristics has little eff
 ect on 
estimated coeffi
  cients in previous standardised patient 
studies and our coeffi
  cients remain stable when we 
account for standardised patient sex, height, and weight 
(appendix pp 13, 14).
To conclude, our study adds to the growing evidence in 
India on antibiotic abuse, but also underscores that the 
use of antibiotics is mediated by drug category and the 
information that patients present. Although antibiotic 
use is high and such use can delay diagnosis, none of the 
pharmacies dispensed anti-tuberculosis drugs and the 
use of stronger fl
 uoroquinolone antibiotics and heavily 
restricted drug classes was low. Furthermore, the use of 
all antibiotics decreased sharply when the patient’s 
diagnosis was revealed to the pharmacists. These 
fi
 ndings can inform interventions to engage pharmacies 
in tuberculosis control and antimicrobial stewardship.
