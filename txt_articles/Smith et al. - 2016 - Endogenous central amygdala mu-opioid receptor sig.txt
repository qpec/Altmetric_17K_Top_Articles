Due to the importance of dietary sodium and its paucity within
many inland environments, terrestrial animals have evolved an
instinctive sodium appetite that is commensurate with sodium
deficiency. Despite a well-established role for central opioid
signaling in sodium appetite, the endogenous influence of specific
opioid receptor subtypes within distinct brain regions remains to
be elucidated. Using selective pharmacological antagonists of
opioid receptor subtypes, we reveal that endogenous mu-opioid
receptor (MOR) signaling strongly drives sodium appetite in
sodium-depleted mice, whereas a role for kappa (KOR) and delta
(DOR) opioid receptor signaling was not detected, at least in
sodium-depleted mice. Fos immunohistochemistry revealed dis-
crete regions of the mouse brain displaying an increased number
of activated neurons during sodium gratification: the rostral por-
tion of the nucleus of the solitary tract (rNTS), the lateral para-
brachial nucleus (LPB), and the central amygdala (CeA). The CeA
was subsequently targeted with bilateral infusions of the MOR
antagonist naloxonazine, which significantly reduced sodium ap-
petite in mice. The CeA is therefore identified as a key node in the
circuit that contributes to sodium appetite. Moreover, endogenous
opioids, acting via MOR, within the CeA promote this form of
appetitive behavior.

odium is an essential dietary component and is required for a
range of general physiological and cellular functions and
specialized roles including blood volume/blood pressure regula-
tion and nerve conduction. However, environmental sources of
sodium are often scarce. Although rainwater derived from ma-
rine aerosols initially contains sodium, most of this is lost by 100–
200 km from the sea coast. In the absence of geological sources,
the soil and plants within a large portion of the earth’s conti-
nental interior, including jungle, mountain, and desert habitats,
are sodium deficient. Consequently, there has been a powerful
evolutionary selection pressure underlying the emergence of a
specific neural organization subserving sodium appetite (1). It is
an exemplar of a neural organization subserving instinctive be-
havior and is perhaps most conspicuous in ruminants.
A core feature of sodium appetite in terrestrial animals is that
sodium depletion induces neuronal changes such that dietary
sodium (e.g., food with high NaCl content) becomes highly
wanted or “craved” and is more hedonically palatable when
consumed (2). Consequently, substances with sodium concen-
trations that are so high they are usually avoided when an animal
is sodium-replete are nonetheless appetitively consumed in large
quantities when an animal is sodium-depleted. This phenomenon
has been reported in sodium-depleted humans [for example, with
Addison’s disease (3)] and is a feature of most long-established
empirical sodium depletion–gratification methods that have
quantified salt appetite in laboratory sheep (4), rats (5), and mice
(6). In rodent models, sodium depletion is readily achieved by
removing all sources of dietary sodium in combination with in-
fusions of a diuretic such as furosemide. Upon reintroduction of
a concentrated sodium source that is usually aversive (such as
0.3 M NaCl), rodents will consume a relatively large volume over
a short time frame. Notably, this behavior ceases sometime be-
fore renormalization of plasma osmolarity, and we therefore
operationally define this rapid consummatory act as gratification
of a sodium appetite. Measurement of the amount consumed
enables quantification of such a gratification response. There-
fore, the magnitude of sodium gratification is subject to the in-
fluence of multiple factors, such as changes in the palatability of
the sodium tastant and the incentive salience or motivation to
consume sodium (1, 2).
A role for opioids in sodium appetite is well established, in line
with a broader role that opioids play in food palatability and
ingestive behaviors (7). Early studies demonstrated that systemic
infusion of naltrexone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist,
reduced the amount of 3% (0.5 M) NaCl solution consumed by
sodium-depleted rats (8). However, multiple endogenous opioids
exist (such as enkephalins, dynorphins, and endorphins/endo-
morphins), which despite considerable promiscuity bind prefer-
entially to delta (DOR), kappa (KOR), and mu-opioid receptors
(MORs), respectively (9). In rats, selective pharmacological an-
tagonism of MOR (10), DOR (11), or KOR (12) signaling can
Significance
Sodium appetite is an important instinctive behavior with high
survival value. Although a role of opioid signaling in salt ap-
petite has been identified in rats, the exact contribution made
by different opioid receptor subtypes within specific brain re-
gions is not fully characterized. Here, we report that mu-opioid
receptor (MOR) signaling is intrinsically responsible for opioid-
dependent sodium appetite rendered by sodium deficiency in
mice. Furthermore, we identified that during gratification of
sodium appetite, the central amygdala is activated, and en-
dogenous MOR signaling within this region promotes sodium
intake in sodium-depleted mice. Accordingly, we reveal a key
nucleus within the endogenous opioid circuit that is likely to be
conserved across mammals and important in the control of
dietary sodium consumption.

 reduce sodium appetite. However, each opioid receptor subtype
is broadly expressed throughout a multitude of brain regions
(13, 14), and therefore characterizing the precise opioidergic
circuitries that contribute to sodium appetite is an important and
ongoing focus of research. Studies in which exogenous opioid
receptor agonists are infused into local regions of rat brain have
proven informative and, for example, have demonstrated that
increased MOR signaling within both the nucleus accumbens
and ventral pallidum enhances the hedonic palatability of NaCl
(15). However, experiments such as these fail to determine
whether such mechanisms act endogenously and are physiolog-
ically relevant during sodium deficiency. To address this, an al-
ternative approach has been to locally infuse opioid receptor
antagonists, which have revealed a role of endogenous MOR
signaling in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), a region
known to relay gustatory signals related to sodium consumption
from the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNTS) (16). Further
research to elucidate such endogenous nodes is important.
However, conducting longitudinal studies of salt appetite in rats
is confounded by the tendency of this species to sensitize to
multiple rounds of sodium deprivation/gratification (17). In
contrast, mice exhibit stable levels of salt gratification over
multiple trials and represent an important experimental model in
which the role of opioids in sodium appetite remains relatively
underexplored (18).
Here, we reveal that MORs are predominantly responsible for
driving opioid-mediated sodium appetite in sodium-depleted
mice. Analysis of Fos immunoreactivity revealed that three re-
gions within the mouse brain are most prominently activated
following gratification of sodium appetite: the central amygdala
(CeA), rNTS, and LPB. Local infusion of a selective MOR an-
tagonist (naloxonazine) within the CeA significantly reduced salt
appetite, identifying CeA MOR signaling as an endogenous in-
stinctive component of sodium appetite in mice. These findings
align well with the established role of CeA in sodium appetite
(19) and motivated consummatory behavior (20) and may have
wider implications for understanding the neuronal mechanisms
underlying the overconsumption of dietary sodium, which is as-
sociated with hypertension, obesity, and other diseases with sig-
nificant health burden (21).
Results
MOR Signaling Is Primarily Responsible for Endogenous Opioid-Driven
Sodium Intake in Sodium-Depleted Mice. The nonselective opioid
receptor antagonist naltrexone reduced the cumulative amount
of sodium consumed by sodium-depleted mice [main effect of
treatment, F(1, 14) = 75.3, P < 0.001; Fig. 1 A and F for nor-
malized 120-min totals]. Naltrexone had no effect on water
consumption following 24 h of water deprivation [main effect of
treatment, F(1, 13) = 0.1, P = 0.078; Fig. S1A], however reduced
food consumption following 24 h food deprivation was observed
[main effect of treatment, F(1, 12) = 13.0, P = 0.004; Fig. S1B].
The ability of naltrexone to reduce sodium intake is mostly
conferred via antagonism of MORs, as naloxonazine (MOR
antagonist) treatment reduced sodium intake to a similar extent
[main effect of treatment, F(1, 7) = 38.7, P < 0.001; Fig. 1B],
whereas neither nor-BNI [KOR antagonist; main effect of
treatment, F(1, 14) = 2.6, P = 0.131; Fig. 1C] nor naltrindole
[DOR antagonist; main effect of treatment, F(1, 14) = 0.5, P =
0.502; Fig. 1D] altered sodium intake. In line with an ability of
MORs to modulate this behavior in either direction, acute
morphine (predominantly a MOR partial agonist) significantly
increased sodium consumption [main effect of treatment, F(1, 12) =
11.5, P = 0.005; Fig. 1E].
Sodium Gratification Activates Neurons Within the CeA, rNTS, and
LPB. MORs are widely distributed throughout the mouse brain.
To determine which candidate regions are involved in the
sodium gratification response, brains were collected from
sodium-replete, sodium-depleted, and sodium-gratified mice
and assessed for Fos immunoreactivity (Table 1). The CeA
displayed a significantly increased number of Fos-positive
neurons following sodium gratification, relative to both
sodium-replete (P < 0.05) and sodium-depleted mice (P <
0.05). Within the brainstem, similar increases in Fos immu-
noreactivity following sodium gratification were observed
within the rNTS (P < 0.01 versus sodium-replete, P < 0.01
Fig. 1.
Systemic infusion of the MOR antagonist naloxonazine reduced
sodium gratification in sodium-depleted mice. (A) The i.p. preinfusion (30 min
before) of the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (1 mg/kg,
n = 8, red line) significantly reduced the cumulative amount of 0.3 M NaCl
solution drank (introduced at time = 0) by sodium-depleted mice, relative to
vehicle controls (n = 8; vehicle controls are represented by a blue line in A–E).
(B) A similar reduction in sodium gratification was achieved following ad-
ministration of the MOR antagonist naloxonazine (5 mg/kg, n = 5, red line;
vehicle, n = 4). In contrast, sodium gratification was not altered by the KOR
antagonist nor-BNI (10 mg/kg, n = 8, red line; vehicle, n = 8) (C) or the DOR
antagonist naltrindole (5 mg/kg, n = 8, red line; vehicle, n = 8) (D). (E) Infusion
of the MOR agonist morphine (1.5 mg/kg, n = 7, green line; vehicle, n = 7)
significantly increased sodium gratification. (F) Total amounts of 0.3 M NaCl
solution drank during the 120-min measurement period following each
treatment, normalized as a percentage of each corresponding vehicle control
group (which are assigned 100%). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Two-
way repeated-measures ANOVA, post hoc tests between treatments within

 versus sodium-depleted) and LPB (P < 0.01 versus sodium-replete,
P < 0.05 versus sodium-depleted).
MOR Antagonism Within the CeA Reduces Sodium Intake in Sodium-
Depleted Mice. Due to the increased Fos expression within the
CeA following sodium gratification (enriched within the medial
CeA, mCeA; Fig. 2), bilateral guide cannulae were surgically
implanted in mice to target the CeA (centered within the mCeA)
or the adjacent region directly medial as a control. Intra-CeA
infusion of naloxonazine significantly reduced sodium intake in
sodium-depleted mice compared with vehicle controls [main
effect of treatment, F(1, 23) = 10.3, P = 0.004; Fig. 3A]. This effect
was not due to generalized behavioral inhibition or sedation, as
intra-CeA naloxonazine treatment did not alter locomotor ac-
tivity [main effect of treatment, F(1, 15) = 1.2, P = 0.292; Fig. S2].
Furthermore, the ability of naloxonazine to reduce sodium in-
take was not due to antagonism of MORs within the nearby
globus pallidus (GP), as data from mice that received injections
centered within this region did not display reduced sodium
consumption (Fig. 3 B–D).
Discussion
Here we report that intra-CeA infusion of a selective MOR
antagonist reduced sodium intake in sodium-depleted mice.
Following early observations that bilateral CeA lesion abolishes
sodium appetite in rats (22), the CeA is now considered one of
several pivotal brain nuclei required for sodium appetite. The
present study extends this knowledge, showing that endogenous
MOR signaling within the CeA is a physiological mechanism to
increase sodium intake when sodium deplete. Moreover, our
finding that DOR and KOR signaling does not significantly
contribute to sodium appetite in sodium-deplete mice is in line
with previous studies where sodium-depleted beta-endorphin
knockout mice consumed ∼50% less 2% (wt/vol) NaCl than wild-
type controls (23) and suggests that this CeA MOR-dependent
mechanism may well be more highly conserved than mechanisms
involving DOR (11) and KOR (12) signaling that have been
identified in rats. Intra-CeA infusion of the exogenous MOR
agonist DAMGO [(D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol)-enkephalin] in-
creases sodium appetite in rats (24, 25); however, until now the
endogenous physiological relevance of this mechanism was un-
known. In conjunction with the current data, we suggest that
CeA MOR signaling is a mechanism to regulate sodium appetite
in rodents.

 Pharmacological enhancement of MOR signaling within the
nucleus accumbens shell and ventral pallidum increases the he-
donic palatability of sodium in rats (7, 15), which can be accu-
rately measured using taste reactivity tests that assess characteristic
hedonic and aversive orofacial gestures (26). In the present studies,
although local CeA infusion of the MOR antagonist naloxonazine
significantly reduced sodium consumption (by approximately one-
third), systemic naloxonazine infusion reduced sodium intake to
an even greater extent (approximately one half). This observa-
tion is therefore likely due to an ability of systemic naloxonazine
administration to additionally reduce MOR signaling within
the nucleus accumbens shell and ventral pallidum, and possibly
other key areas, which decreases sodium palatability or other-
wise impairs sodium appetite. In contrast to the role of endog-
enous MOR signaling in increasing hedonic palatability in extra-
CeA sites, the work of Berridge and others has demonstrated
that pharmacological MOR activation within the CeA of rats
increases the incentive salience of various goals or rewards such
as sucrose (how much sucrose is “wanted”), in response to cues
(27–29). However, CeA MOR activation does not increase the
palatability and hedonic reward value of sugar when it is tasted
(how much the sugar is “liked”) in slightly food-restricted rats
(20). In light of these findings, it seems probable that endoge-
nous MOR signaling within the CeA of sodium-depleted mice
increases the incentive salience of sodium (“wanting”) in re-
sponse to cues that indicate sodium availability (such as
reintroduction of the sodium solution and initial detection of the
sodium tastant), rather than by increasing the hedonic palatability
(“liking”) of sodium when consumed. This mechanism is in
agreement with our finding that the CeA was activated (displayed
an increased number of Fos-positive neurons) following sodium
gratification but not during sodium depletion when the sodium-
related cues were absent. However, as the mice used in these Fos
studies consumed large volumes of 0.3 M NaCl solution during
the 10 min in which access was provided, it is also possible that
the observed increase in CeA Fos may be due to indirect stim-
ulation from the mouth and gastrointestinal tract (via the NTS
and LPB) to signal the cessation of sodium consumption (30). A
similar pattern of Fos immunoreactivity has been reported in
rats, where sodium gratification also appeared to approximately
double the number of CeA Fos-positive neurons compared with
sodium-deficient rats that were killed 24 h after their last furo-
semide injection (a time point comparable to the present studies
in mice) (31). In contrast to the present study, however, sodium-
depleted rats display more Fos immunoreactivity throughout the
extended amygdala than sodium-replete controls, including in
the central subdivision of the lateral part of the CeA (CeLCn)
(19). Although this finding may suggest a physiological differ-
ence between species, the expression and detection of Fos im-
munoreactivity can be highly sensitive to subtle variations in
technical approach. For example, a previous mouse study that
used somewhat similar protocols reported that sodium depletion
significantly increased Fos immunoreactivity within the median
preoptic area, vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, and sub-
fornical organ (which together form the lamina terminalis) (32).
In contrast, our experimental protocols detected a statistically
significant increase only in the subfornical organ.
Dynamic and fast-changing incentive salience, which can sharply
increase upon detection of a cue (20), differs from the long-
established slow accumulation of sodium appetite mediated by
angiotensin II and circumventricular organs, including the lamina
terminalis (1, 2). Several putative mechanisms through which the
CeA might increase incentive salience have been suggested, in-
volving direct and indirect modulation of mesocorticolimbic (33,
34) and brainstem circuits (25, 35). Interestingly, in addition to
driving sodium and sucrose wanting, the CeA also plays a role in
inhibiting feeding in response to satiety cues, conditioned taste
aversion, and other anorexigenic signals (36); however, whether
these roles involve inhibiting MOR signaling or downstream effects
in this region remains to be determined. Intrinsic enkephalin
neurons are the major source of endogenous ligand for MORs
within the CeA (37, 38). The present findings suggest that these
neurons receive information pertaining to sodium depletion,
which may be derived indirectly via the circumventricular or-
gans responding to circulating angiotensin II (39) and/or HSD2
neurons (which express the 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 2 enzyme) within the NTS that detect plasma aldosterone,
project to the CeA, are activated during sodium depletion, and
promote sodium appetite (40).
Interestingly, the present studies revealed that within the CeA,
the medial portion is preferentially activated in response to so-
dium gratification. This finding fits with studies that demonstrate
the mCeA is a major output region for this structure and is
particularly important for selecting and initiating different be-
havioral strategies in response to cues (41). This ability of the
CeA to direct and refine instinctive behaviors in response to
learnt cues and experience has obvious evolutionary advantage.
In the context of sodium appetite, although it is important that a
gradual decline in homeostatic sodium levels is detected by the
brain via the circumventricular organs (1, 2, 39), an ability to
sharply elevate sodium wanting upon detection of a sodium
source represents a desirable survival strategy. From a technical
perspective, although our local infusion studies targeted the
mCeA, it is likely that the entire CeA was within the boundaries

 of drug/vehicle injections. Finally, we report here that the rNTS
and LPB were also activated in response to sodium gratification;
however, such a finding was expected given the known role
of these structures in receiving and processing sodium taste
information (42, 43).
In conclusion, our studies have revealed that endogenous
MOR signaling within the CeA increases sodium appetite in
mice. This finding builds upon the established role of the CeA in
contributing to the control of sodium appetite and in influencing
food consumption more broadly. Like other instinctive behaviors
that once performed adaptive roles but are now often ill-suited
to modern society, overconsumption of sodium can contribute to
hypertension and cardiac dysfunction (21). The present study
makes a significant contribution to furthering our understanding
of the circuitry that underlies sodium consumption and has im-
plications for both basic science and human health.

Australia Pty Ltd.; i.p. 1.5 mg/kg) were dissolved in vehicle consisting of either
0.9% NaCl (i.p. studies) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (147 mM NaCl, 4 mM
KCl, 0.85 mM MgCl2, and 2.3 mM CaCl2, for intra-CeA studies). Mice were
allowed at least 7 d of recovery between infusions. For i.p. studies, 0.1 mL/10 g
injection volumes were used.
Intra-CeA Infusions.
Stereotaxic implantation of indwelling intra-CeA guide cannula. Mice were anes-
thetized via isoflurane inhalation [Delvet; 4% (vol/vol) at 0.2 L/min for in-
duction and thereafter maintained at 2% (vol/vol)] and the head secured in a
small animal stereotaxic frame (Kopf). Analgesic was provided (Meloxicam,
Troy Laboratories, 20 mg/kg i.p.), and an incision was made to expose the
skull, which was cleaned and dried with 6% (vol/vol) hydrogen peroxide.
Three small screws (No. 087800, McCann Optical Parts) were secured into pits
drilled into the skull surrounding the location of the cannula pedestal to
anchor it in place, and small holes were drilled into the skull dorsal to the
mCeA (relative to bregma, anterior–posterior, –1.4 mm; medial–lateral, ±2.5 mm).
The bilateral guide cannula and pedestal (C235G/5.0/SPC, cut to 5.0 mm
length, PlasticsOne) was lowered into place (dorsal–ventral, –3.5 mm) such
that the ventral ends of the guide cannulae were 1.25 mm dorsal to the
center of the mCeA. The cannula and screws were fixed in place with self-
curing acrylic dental cement (Vertex-Dental), and a dummy cannula
(C235DC/5.0/SPC, cut to protrude guide cannula by 1.25 mm, PlasticsOne)
was inserted and secured with a cap (363DC, PlasticsOne). Mice were
allowed to recover for 1 wk before testing, and dummy cannulae were
loosened every 2–3 d to prevent blockage.
Intra-CeA infusions. Mice were carefully restrained, the dummy cannula re-
moved, and an injector (bilateral infusion internal cannula, C235I/5.0/SPC, cut
to protrude guide cannula by 1.25 mm, PlasticsOne) inserted that was con-
nected to a double polyethylene tubing connector assembly (C230C/SPC,
PlasticsOne) and two 1 μL microsyringes (Hamilton Instruments) mounted on
an infusion pump (11-Plus, Harvard). Simultaneous bilateral infusions of 250 nL
were delivered over 1 min and the injector left in place for a further 20 s
before being removed and replaced with the dummy cannula.
Histological target validation. At the conclusion of the studies, mice were culled
via i.p. infusion of pentobarbital (Nembutal, 100 mg/kg) and decapitated.
Brains were removed from the skull and fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde
for 24 h, before being cryoprotected in 20% (wt/vol) sucrose for 24 h, frozen
over dry ice, and stored at –80 °C. Sections 40 μm thick were cut using a
cryostat, mounted onto glass microscope slides, and counterstained with eosin
(1%, Amber Scientific), which was washed off with phosphate buffer (PB;
2.7 mM KCl, 11.2 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) after 20 s. Slides were
dried for 20 min, mounting media (Dako) added, and coverslipped. Bright
field micrographs were acquired, and the location of infusions determined
by an observer blinded to identity.
Sodium Depletion and Repletion. As mice display consistent sodium gratifi-
cation behavior across multiple rounds of sodium depletion/repletion (18),
cross-over experimental design was used such that vehicle (control) and drug
responses were assessed within the same individual animals. For each round,
mice were maintained on low-sodium food [0.02% (wt/wt) sodium, SF02-
020, Specialty Feeds Pty Ltd.] for 7 d before experimentation and provided
with a second water sipper containing 0.3 M NaCl that was removed 48 h
before experimentation. Additionally, mice were i.p. injected with the di-
uretic furosemide (Lasix, Sanofi-Aventis; 1.2 mg in 0.12 mL) at 48 h and 24 h
before experimentation. On the experimental day, mice were infused with
either opioid receptor antagonist or morphine or vehicle (between 1000 and
1100). Thirty minutes later, the 0.3 M NaCl sipper was reintroduced, and the
volume consumed was recorded every 15 min for 2 h.
Consummatory and Locomotor Activity Controls. To assess the effects of nal-
trexone on other consummatory behaviors, mice (sodium replete; maintained
on standard chow without a 0.3 M NaCl sipper) were deprived of either water
or food for 24 h. Thirty minutes after i.p. naltrexone infusion, water or food
was then reintroduced and the amount drunk/consumed was recorded every
15 min for 2 h. To determine whether intra-CeA naloxonazine infusion alters
locomotor activity, 30 min after infusions mice (sodium replete) were placed in
automated locomotor cells (Internal Length × Width, 27 × 27 cm; Tru Scan
Photobeam Arena, Coulbourn Instruments) for 1 h, and the floor plane distance
traveled was acquired in 5-min time bins using Tru Scan 2.0 software.
Fos Studies.
Tissue collection. Three groups of mice (each n = 6) were culled either sodium-
replete, following sodium depletion, or 90 min after sodium-depleted mice
were allowed 10 min of 0.3 M NaCl access (sodium gratification) to allow for
optimal Fos protein accumulation. To recapitulate the treatment schedule of
the previous i.p. studies, mice in this latter group were i.p. infused with
vehicle 30 min before 0.3 M NaCl was reintroduced, and to maintain con-
sistency, sodium-replete and sodium-depleted groups were also i.p. injected
with vehicle 130 min before being culled. Mice were culled by i.p. pento-
barbital (100 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 12 mL PB followed by
60 mL paraformaldehyde [4% (wt/vol), dissolved in PB] at a rate of 8 mL/min.
Brains were then removed, postfixed in ice-cold 4% (wt/vol) PFA for 1 h,
cryoprotected in 20% (wt/vol) sucrose at 4 °C overnight, dried, frozen over
dry ice, and stored at –80 °C. We cut 40-μm sections on a cryostat and stored
them free-floating in cryoprotectant [30% (vol/vol) glycerol, 30% (vol/vol)
ethylene glycol, 40% (vol/vol) PB] at –20 °C.
Fos immunohistochemistry. Cryoprotectant was washed off and sections per-
meabilized via 4 × 10 min washes in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and a
further 4 × 10 min in PB. Sections were blocked for 1 h in PB with 10% (vol/vol)
normal horse serum (NHS) before being transferred to PB containing 2%
(vol/vol) NHS and rabbit anti–c-Fos primary antiserum (cat. no. sc-52, Santa
Cruz, 1:4,000 dilution) overnight. The next morning, sections were washed
3 × 10 min in PB and transferred to PB containing 2% (vol/vol) NHS and
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antiserum (Vectastain Elite, Vector
Laboratories; 1:200 dilution) for 1 h. Sections were again washed 3 × 10 min
in PB and transferred to PB containing avidin/biotin ABC peroxidase complex
(Vectastain, 1:100 dilution) for 1 h. Following 3 × 10-min washes in PB,
sections were incubated in PB containing 0.01% H2O2 and 0.0625 mg/mL
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min, before 3 × 10-min washes
in PB. Sections were then transferred to dH2O with 1.8 g/L gelatin, mounted
onto glass microscope slides and dried overnight, before being dehydrated
and cleared in ethanol and xylene and cover-slipped with safety mount
mounting media (cat. no. 11 067, Trajan).
Imaging and counting. Brightfield digital images were captured using a Nikon
Microphot SA microscope, and Fos-positive cells were automatically counted
by a blinded observer using ImageJ software (1.47v) and the ITCN plugin using
threshold settings that provided counts that matched manual scoring in initial
validation studies. One or two 40-μm thick representative coronal sections
(location-matched across all subjects; n = 4–6 mice per group) were assessed
for each midline and bilateral brain region.
Statistical Analysis. Prism V6.01 software (GraphPad) was used to generate all
graphs and determine statistical significance (alpha P < 0.05), and all data are
expressed as mean ± SEM. Time course data were analyzed using two-way
