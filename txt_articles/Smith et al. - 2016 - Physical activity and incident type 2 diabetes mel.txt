Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Inverse associations between physical activ-
ity (PA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus are well known.
However, the shape of the dose–response relationship is still
uncertain. This review synthesises results from longitudinal
studies in general populations and uses non-linear models of
the association between PA and incident type 2 diabetes.
Methods A systematic literature search identified 28 prospec-
tive studies on leisure-time PA (LTPA) or total PA and risk of
type 2 diabetes. PA exposures were converted into metabolic
equivalent of task (MET)h/week and marginal MET(MMET)
h/week, a measure only considering energy expended above
resting metabolic rate. Restricted cubic splines were used to
model the exposure–disease relationship.
Results Our results suggest an overall non-linear relationship;
using the cubic spline model we found a risk reduction of 26%
(95% CI 20%, 31%) for type 2 diabetes among those who
achieved 11.25 MET h/week (equivalent to 150 min/week of
moderate activity) relative to inactive individuals. Achieving
twice this amount of PA was associated with a risk reduction
of 36% (95% CI 27%, 46%), with further reductions at higher
doses (60 MET h/week, risk reduction of 53%). Results for the
MMET h/week dose–response curve were similar for moder-
ate intensity PA, but benefits were greater for higher intensity
PA and smaller for lower intensity activity.
Conclusions/interpretation Higher levels of LTPA were asso-
ciated with substantially lower incidence of type 2 diabetes in
the general population. The relationship between LTPA and
type 2 diabetes was curvilinear; the greatest relative benefits
are achieved at low levels of activity, but additional benefits
can be realised at exposures considerably higher than those
prescribed by public health recommendations.

 Introduction
High fasting plasma glucose was recently ranked as the fifth
leading risk for death [1] and 6.8% of global excess mortality
was attributed to diabetes [2]. Prevalence of this metabolic dis-
order is predicted to reach nearly 600 million cases by 2035 [3],
posing both a substantial morbidity and mortality burden and a
large financial cost on individuals and healthcare systems [4, 5].
Evidence on the effects of physical activity (PA) on risk of
diabetes arises from interventional [6–9] and observational
studies [10–14]. Prevention trials conducted in patients with
impaired glucose tolerance provide some understanding of the
extent to which PA may confer a preventive effect on progres-
sion to type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations [6–9, 15].
However, the majority of these studies include both diet and
PA interventions, and isolation of the impact of PA itself is
rarely possible. It is also difficult to evaluate the benefit of the
whole PA exposure continuum from trials, as most interven-
tion studies focus on shifting participants’ behaviours towards
the recommended levels of exercise rather than assessing the
benefits of changes at the lowest ends of the normal PA spec-
trum, or the additional benefits gained at the highest level.
Therefore, although associated with a higher risk of confound-
ing, evidence from cohort studies in the general population
can provide complementary evidence of the dose–response
relationship between PA and diabetes, independent of diet.
Public health guidelines [16, 17] recommend a minimum of
150 min of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) or 75 min
vigorous PA (VPA) a week to maintain general health. Self-
report data suggest that around a third of adults globally are
not meeting these targets [18]. A fundamental consideration
in the formulation of PA guidelines, however, is the nature of
the dose–response relationship between PA and non-
communicable disease incidence.
Dose–response curves for PA and health outcomes, ranging
from cardiovascular disease to all-cause mortality, suggest a
non-linear dose–response shape [19–24], often with large gains
when low activity is compared with completely sedentary but
much smaller additional benefits beyond that. A recent review
suggested a non-linear relationship between PA and diabetes.
However, it found differently shaped dose–response curves
based on the different ways in which PA was reported in the
original studies [25]. Each of the dose–response analyses only
included a small portion of the total studies available in this area
of research, owing to a lack of data harmonisation and leaving
considerable uncertainty about the relative risk for any given
exposure since not all of the evidence could be considered.
Providing quantitative estimates regarding the dose–
response relationship is essential for approximating how
changes in levels of PA in the general population would
impact disease incidence, and would support more nu-
anced guidance to the public and evidence-based dia-
logue in clinical settings.
Calculating the dose of PA is associated with considerable
uncertainty and can be achieved using a variety of methods. In
deciding how to equate activities of varying intensity, one
issue is whether to include the resting metabolic rate. In this
review we investigate the dose–response relationship between
PA and type 2 diabetes via a systematic review and dose–
response meta-analysis. We report results quantifying PA
dose, both via inclusion and exclusion of the resting metabolic
rate in the summation of PA volume.
Methods
Search strategy PubMed and EMBASE were searched for
prospective cohort studies on the association between PA
and type 2 diabetes using a combination of medical subject
heading (MeSH) and indexed terms (details in electronic sup-
plementary material [ESM] Fig. 1). Search filters for observa-
tional studies were applied to refine the search output. The
reference list of past systematic reviews were manually
searched for further studies [26–32]. No restrictions on date
of publication were set and new results were included up until
December 2015.
Eligibility criteria Prospective studies were included if they:
(1) followed a cohort of adults; (2) excluded individuals with
type 2 diabetes at baseline; (3) ascertained levels of leisure-
time PA (LTPA) or total PA at baseline; and (4) reported RRs,
ORs or HRs for incidence of type 2 diabetes. Exclusion
criteria were: (1) studies which reported insufficient detail of
PA assessment to estimate PA dose in metabolic equivalent of
task (MET)h/week; (2) studies using measures of fitness as
the exposure; (3) studies reporting PA as a dichotomous var-
iable; and (4) duplicate data.
Two researchers (ADS and BR-S) screened titles and
abstracts for eligibility according to the pre-specified criteria.
When eligibility was ambiguous, the full text was retrieved.
To ensure no duplicate data were included, cohort name,
recruitment periods or protocols were compared, and only
the most complete publication was included. A third research-
er (O. Olayinka, London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine, London, UK) assessed the identified articles and
any disagreements were discussed until consensus was
reached. A breakdown of the literature search is shown in
ESM Fig. 2.
Data extraction and exposure harmonisation Data were
extracted (by ADS) from eligible studies on first author, pub-
lication date, geographical location, cohort size, sex and age
characteristics, cumulative incidence or incidence rate of type
2 diabetes, case count per category of PA exposure, total per-
sons or person-years per PA category, method and unit of PA
assessment, reported levels of PA exposure, ORs/RRs/HRs for
2528

 type 2 diabetes with 95% CIs for each PA category, and
covariates for which the analyses were adjusted. Overall study
quality score was derived using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale
(NOS); inter-rater reliability (between ADS and O. Olayinka)
was 86% (full NOS results are shown in ESM Table 1).
In prospective studies where HRs or ORs for type 2 diabe-
tes were reported, we assumed these approximated the RR
[33]. We pooled the most adjusted risk estimates both includ-
ing and excluding adjustment for BMI. Initially we
harmonised group-level exposure estimates to the common
unit of MET h/week, thereby allowing integration of activities
differing in intensity and duration amassed over the course of
a week. For the assignment of specific intensities to categories
of PA exposure, average intensity of MVPA and VPA was
defined as 4.5 and 8 METs (or 3.5 and 7 marginal METs
[MMETs]), respectively [34]. Studies reporting data indepen-
dently for men and women [35–39] or for multiple cohorts
within a study [35] were treated as separate observations.
Studies reporting risk estimates relative to the highest category
of PA were re-calculated to set the lowest PA [36, 40–42]
category as the referent [43].
When not directly reported, classic PA volume (MET
h/week) was calculated by multiplication of the median or
mid-point duration of the reported category with its assigned
gross MET value. Open-ended categories for average LTPA
duration were converted to point estimates by assuming that
the median of the open-ended category was equidistant from
the lower category boundary as half the interval width in the
neighbouring category [44]. For one study that reported PA as
PA level (PAL, a measure of energy expenditure expressed as
a multiple of 24 h resting metabolic rate), an approximation of
LTPA MET h/week was performed using descriptions of typ-
ical PA levels for each category [45]. If PA was reported only
as frequency of sessions per week, a single session was
assumed to consist of 45 min in the main analysis with an
assumption of 30 min tested in sensitivity analysis. Likewise,
if only average duration for PA (e.g. walking, cycling) was
reported, we assumed this was undertaken at an intensity of
4.5 METs. Marginalised PA volume (MMET h/week) was cal-
culated by discounting the resting metabolic rate of 1 MET in
the quantification of PA intensity. An overview of dose assign-
ment calculations is shown in ESM Table 2. For summary data,
we subtracted 1 MET h from each 1 h increment over which
total reported activity was performed. When the required data
were not reported in the original articles we emailed authors
from the identified cohorts to acquire further details, e.g. on
duration of PA and number of type 2 diabetes cases for each
PA exposure category. Following correspondence, updated
follow-up data [11, 13] and further details on PA behaviour
[11, 38, 46, 47] were obtained.
Statistical analysis Generalised least-squares (GLS) regres-
sion was performed to estimate study-specific dose–response
curves. GLS regression estimates the linear dose–response
coefficients taking into account the covariance for each expo-
sure category within each study, as they are estimated relative
to a common referent PA exposure category [48, 49]. Study-
specific dose–response coefficients were pooled using the
DerSimonian–Laird estimator in a random-effects model
[50]. First, a linear association was assumed; study-specific
RR estimates were calculated per 10 MET h/week increment
and subsequently pooled. Two cohorts [51, 52] did not pro-
vide sufficient data to be included in this model. However,
variance-weighted least-squares regression analysis was used
to estimate linear associations for both of these studies,
allowing us to quantify the influence of excluding these on
the overall effect estimates.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted by consecutive
removal of individual studies from the summary risk estimate
and via restriction to high-quality studies. The impact of
duration and intensity assumptions (when necessary) was
assessed by applying lower values. Subgroup analysis by
sex, study location, cohort size and follow-up time was under-
taken. Mediation by BMI was explored according to the de-
gree of adjustment (BMI adjusted vs non-BMI adjusted) and
participant obesity (BMI < 30 vs > 30 kg/m2). To further
reduce heterogeneity, we separately pooled risk estimates that
either focused on LTPA or the more inclusive measures of
total PA. Significance of subgroup and sensitivity analysis
was judged by the p value for heterogeneity [53].
In addition, we examined possible non-linear associations
by modelling PA using restricted cubic spline with three knots
located at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the distribu-
tion. Only studies reporting risk estimates for at least three PA
exposure levels for incident type 2 diabetes [54] were included
in this analysis. Departure from linearity of the final cubic
spline model was assessed using the Wald test for non-
linearity [55].
Publication bias was investigated by funnel plot and
Egger’s test for asymmetry. All reported p values were two
sided. All analyses were performed using Stata 13.1 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX, USA). Interactive dose–response
curves were visualised using R (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) [56].
Results
Literature search In total, 28 eligible cohort studies were
identified which returned a total of 32 independent observa-
tions on PA and incidence of type 2 diabetes. The majority of
studies (24 cohorts) yielded information on the association
between LTPA and type 2 diabetes (28 observations), while
four cohorts [39, 57–59] reported findings on total PA.
Overall, this review includes 1,261,991 individuals and
84,134 incident cases of type 2 diabetes.

 Study characteristics Cohort size ranged from 916 to
675,496 people, with cumulative type 2 diabetes incidence
ranging from 1.6% [42] to 27.5% [46]. Follow-up time varied
from 3 [42] to 23.1 [60] years. Twelve studies were conducted
in the USA [12, 14, 35, 38, 46, 58, 60–65], six in Asia [47, 57,
59, 66–68], two in Australia [40, 42] and eight across Europe
[13, 36, 37, 39, 41, 69–71]. All cohorts relied on self-reported
PA collected using questionnaires or by interview, apart from
one study in Hawaiians [58]. A descriptive summary of the
cohort characteristics can be found in Table 1.
Age was the only variable for which all cohorts had adjusted
their findings, with adjustment for other confounders varying
considerably. Four cohorts [14, 36, 58, 64] did not adjust for
BMI, a key variable believed to mediate the effect of PA on
type 2 diabetes. Overall, inverse associations between PA and
incident type 2 diabetes were observed for all identified cohorts.
Linear association between PA and incidence of type 2
diabetes Study-specific linear RRs (95% CI) for 10 MET h/
week increments of PA sorted by PA domain and publication
year, are shown in Fig. 1.
The mean pooled risk reduction for type 2 diabetes was
13% (95% CI 11%, 16%) per 10 MET h/week increment of
PA, albeit observed in the presence of high heterogeneity (I2
93.5%, pHet<0.001). Consecutive removal of single studies
indicated no significant impact of any one study on the overall
heterogeneity in the model (I2 88.3–92.3%, pHet < 0.001).
Likewise, restriction to studies rated as high quality did not
substantially influence model heterogeneity (I2 82%,
pHet<0.001, n=17).
Risk reductions for type 2 diabetes were considerably more
pronounced for LTPA compared with the benefits estimated for
total PA. Each 10 MET h/week increment of LTPA reduced type
2 diabetes risk by 17% (95% CI 13%, 21%) compared with 5%
(95% CI 2%, 7%) for each 10 MET h/week increment of total
PA. Benefits from VPA integrated over time to MET h/week
were much larger, with a decrease in risk of type 2 diabetes of
56% (95% CI 16%, 77%) per 10 MET h/week increment.
The effects appeared to be more pronounced in women
with a pooled RR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.77, 0.90, I2 89.5%,
pHet <0.001, n =10 observations) compared with a pooled
RR for men of 0.89 (95% CI 0.86, 0.93, I2 95.3%,
pHet < 0.001, n = 13 observations) per 10 MET h/week.
Studies conducted in Asia on average observed less benefit,
with a mean RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95, 0.98, I2 65.2%,
pHet<0.001, n=6 observations) per 10 MET h/week when
compared to the USA (0.85 [95% CI 0.79, 0.91, I2 96.6%,
pHet<0.001, n=13]) or Europe (0.83 [95% CI 0.77, 0.89, I2
80.6%, pHet<0.001, n=11 observations]). The two studies in
Australia reported, on average, the highest benefit (0.81 [95%
CI 0.65, 1.01, I2 77.1%, pHet<0.001]; see Table 2).
Adjustment for BMI appeared to attenuate the pooled pro-
tective effect size by around one-third, from 0.81 (95% CI
0.77, 0.84, I2 96.8%, pHet < 0.001, n = 21 observations) to
0.87 (95% CI 0.84, 0.90, I2 92.6%, pHet<0.001, n=27 obser-
vations). Stratification by participant BMI suggested the pro-
tective effect of activity was more pronounced in those with
BMI<30 kg/m2, with an observed mean RR of 0.75 (95% CI,
0.65, 0.95, I2 63.1%, pHet=0.01, n=4 observations) vs 0.88
(95% CI 0.80, 0.96, I2 0.00, pHet<0.001, n=3 observations)
for obese individuals. Inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s
test for asymmetry (p<0.001) did not indicate the presence of
publication bias or small studies effect (ESM Fig. 3).
Non-linear dose–response analysis In total, data from 23
cohorts were included in the restricted cubic spline analysis
and the ensuing pooling in a two-stage multivariate dose–re-
sponse model. A significant non-linear dose–response is
shown in Fig. 2a (pNon-linearity<0.001), with greater risk reduc-
tion at moderate exposures compared with higher ones.
Results from the cubic spline model suggest that individ-
uals who accumulate 11.25 MET h/week (equivalent to meet-
ing the recommended guidelines of 150 min/week of activity
at 4.5 MET) have a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes
equal to 26% (95% CI 20%, 31%) relative to completely in-
active individuals.
We found no indication of a substantial threshold effect or
plateau for the obtained benefit across increasing levels of PA.
Being active at a level corresponding to double that of the
recommended minimal PA (22.5 MET h/week) was associat-
ed with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes of 36% (95% CI
27%, 46%) with further reductions at higher doses (60 MET
h/week, risk reduction of 53%), in the cubic spline model.
For 8.75 MMET h/week (equivalent to 11.25 MET h/week
at a mean gross intensity of 4.5 MET) the pooled RR for type 2
diabetes was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69, 0.80), with risk being 0.64
(95% CI 0.56, 0.73) for those doing twice as much. Point risk
estimates of the pooled dose–response relation for LTPA (in
MET h/week) and type 2 diabetes are tabulated in Fig. 2 (also
available online as an interactive version at http://epiweb.mrc-
epid.cam.ac.uk/meta-analyses/pa/diabetes/).
Sensitivity analyses were run to assess the effect of as-
sumptions regarding duration or intensity of the PA exposure
used in the LTPA dose assignment procedure for those studies
where this information was not directly available; see Fig. 2 b-
d and ESM Fig. 4. The shape of the dose–response curve was
similar under these different assumptions. Benefits were larger
for a given exposure if duration and intensity were assumed to
be smaller in the original studies where these assumptions
were needed. Furthermore, we repeated the final cubic spline
model including variance-weighted linear dose–response gra-
dients of the two identified studies that could not be used in
the main model because of incomplete data. The impact of
excluding these studies was minimal on the overall final
result, with a risk reduction of 24% (95% CI 19%, 29%) at
2530

Discussion
Our results from a comprehensive literature search identifying
relevant longitudinal studies indicate an inverse association
between PA and incidence of type 2 diabetes, which was con-
sistently observed across the identified cohorts. Using the
restricted cubic splines model, accumulating an activity volume
which is commensurate with adherence to the current public
health recommendations of 150 min of MVPA per week com-
pared with sedentary individuals was associated with a reduc-
tion in the risk of type 2 diabetes by 26% (95% CI 20%, 31%)
in the general population.
Our results suggest that the benefits of higher activity levels
extend considerably beyond the minimum recommendations.
Using the restricted cubic spline model we found that a dou-
bling of activity volume from 11.25 MET h/week to 22.5
MET h/week would further reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes
by 10% to a total risk reduction of 36% compared with being
inactive. For an intensity of 4.5 MET, our results were very
similar under the MMET analysis. However, a greater benefit
would be gained from using MMETs for more intensive activ-
ity, whereas less intensive activity would gain smaller benefits.
Central to any dose–response analysis for assessing PA in
relation to health is the issue of uncertainty in the way by which
PA was assessed in free-living individuals. Self-reported PA
generally correlates significantly but weakly with objective
methods of PA ascertainment, with approximately 10% shared
variance [60]. A further crucial issue which may have affected
our findings is the substantial heterogeneity in the measurement
and reporting of PA behaviour, resulting from questionnaires
ascertaining different domains, timeframes and/or units of PA.
Methods of outcome assessment were also not consistent across
the identified cohorts and it is possible that diagnostic bias may
have distorted the results of some of the studies because of
differences in diabetes detection accuracy.
When interpreting the findings, the fact that most studies
were primarily conducted in samples of well-educated white
populations in high-income countries must be taken into
account. In the context of type 2 diabetes, earlier studies have
found that dose–response curves may be different for Asian

 Indians who may require more PA to be protected from their
relatively higher susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes [72,
73].
A potential strength of our present analyses is the expres-
sion of PA exposure dose in MMET h/week rather than just
MET h/week. There is a fine distinction between these two
measures; an individual expending 3 METs on a given activity
is using double the activity-related energy above rest than an
individual performing an activity at 2 METs. By setting the
starting point of the PA volume at 0 MMET h/week, better
mathematical properties (proportionality) of the exposure var-
iable are taken into account, allowing different intensities of
activity to be more fairly equated, both within and across
individuals and populations. This calculation gives a relatively
higher weighting to time spent in more vigorous activity com-
pared with classic METs. This means that doing more
intensive activity would equate to a relatively larger dose in
the MMET model than under the MET model. For example,
2.5 h/week of MVPA at 4.5 MET (equal to 11.25 MET h/
week) is volume equivalent to 1.41 h of 8 MET of intense
activity, while 2.5 h/week of MVPA at 3.5 MMET (equal to
8.75 MMET h/week) is volume equivalent to 1.25 h of 7
MMET of intense activity. Results for MVPA were similar,
but benefits were larger for more intense PA.
Most cohorts were not designed to specifically investigate
PA and the resulting paucity of comprehensive data on all PA
behaviours may have hindered our analysis. We used aggregat-
ed exposure measures across a range of reported activities from
each study, which relied on the originally assigned intensity
values for each activity by the primary study analysis alongside
aggregated durations, however it is likely that more accurate
MMET h estimates could be calculated with access to

 individual-level raw PA data. Nevertheless, expressing PA in
marginal MET units is a promising method to account for ac-
tivities of differing intensity and would be aided by better
reporting of intensity and duration characteristics for each
exposure group.
As a restricted cubic spline regression model was used to
study the shape of the dose–response relationship, we were
able to improve precision as to how the association between
PA and incident type 2 diabetes varies at different exposure
levels [49].
An earlier systematic review [25] also conducted dose–
response meta-analyses for PA and type 2 diabetes.
However, this review achieved far less data harmonisation
than in our paper. Aune et al report results separately for
MET h/week (five studies), hours per week (ten studies)
and energy expenditure (four studies). They found a larger

Fig. 2 (a–d) Dose–response association between LTPA and incidence of
type 2 diabetes modelled using restricted cubic splines and comparison of
predicted RR point estimates for type 2 diabetes using different dose-
assignment assumptions. LTPA converted to MET h/week with results
pooled in a two-stage random-effects model. RRs were derived from a
common lowest PA category within each study. Listed exposure levels
were chosen to represent meaningful and easy to interpret PA volumes
equivalent to the following: 30 min of MVPA; 1 h MVPA; rounded value
to allow for comparison with GLS PA exposure increment; 150 min PA/
current recommended guidelines; double the recommended guidelines
and two high PA exposure levels investigating the risk reductions at the
higher end of the LTPA spectrum. The bold lines indicate the pooled
restricted cubic spline model and the black dashed line indicates the
95% CIs of the pooled curve. Duration assumption was necessary in nine
out of 27 observations, applied as 45 min/session in scenarios (a) and (c),
and 30 min/session in scenarios (b) and (d). Intensity assumption was
necessary in 15 out of 27 observations, applied as low-intensity PA
(LPA) = 3 MET, MVPA = 4.5 MET and VPA = 8 MET in scenarios (a)
and (b), and LPA = 2 MET, MVPA = 3.5 MET and VPA = 7 MET in
scenarios (c) and (d)

 benefit (based on an assumption of moderate intensity
activity) and a more linear dose–response curve using the
time-based measure compared with the MET h measure.
Our results, which are derived from 23 studies, suggest
considerably larger benefits for the same PA exposure level,
e.g. RR of 0.65 vs RR of 0.76 at 20 MET h/week. Given
that our more extensive approach to harmonisation requires
more assumptions it is encouraging that our sensitivity
analysis found relatively small differences in the size of
the effects, and little difference in the shape of the dose–
response curve.
Previous research into PA and other health outcomes has
often provided evidence in favour of a strongly curvilinear
dose–response relationship [20–23, 74]. This curvilinear asso-
ciation has been the basis for further health impact modelling
studies [75] and, as such is used to estimate how much gain
there would be in population health from different PA interven-
tions or scenarios. Uncertainty about the dose–response shape
has been found to contribute substantially to uncertainty about
the final results of partaking in PA for disease prevention. Our
results indicate that for type 2 diabetes prevention, while prob-
ably curvilinear over a much wider exposure range, the rela-
tionship is much closer to linearity than that found previously
for all-cause mortality or ischaemic heart disease [21]. Our
effect estimates are likely to be conservative, given the diluting
impact that exposure measurement error stemming from a
single self-report measure of activity will have on the observed
associations. Even so, our results suggest a major potential for
PA to slow down or reverse the global increase in type 2 dia-
betes prevalence and should prove useful for health impact
modelling, which frequently forms part of the evidence base
for policy decisions (e.g. WebTAG for transport [76]).
Increasingly, PA research is incorporating the use of objec-
tive data, e.g. UK Biobank has recently collected
accelerometry data in 100,000 individuals who are also
followed up over time to link this data with health outcomes.
However, before such studies accrue enough major clinical
events to examine prospective relationships, self-report data
may be calibrated against objective measures to enhance
translation of findings based on self-report into public health
action [77].
Given the non-linear nature of the dose–response curve
between LTPA and type 2 diabetes, the effects of LTPA are
likely to depend on the exposure to non-leisure activity. Our
finding of a smaller effect for total PA is unexpected but was
based on a much smaller evidence base and may reflect dif-
ferences in measurement properties between domains.
Assuming, however, that the non-linear relationship holds
across all domains, the marginal effect of LTPAwill be greater
in a population that is less active in other domains and vice
versa. One way to address this would be to conduct a meta-
analysis of LTPA by level of non-leisure PA, e.g. occupational
grouping.
The results from this dose–response meta-analysis provide
evidence in support of the clinically meaningful role of PA in
the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes in the general
population. We highlight the necessity for progress in PA
measurement and reporting of PA of different intensities
and duration in cohort studies. Additionally, we recom-
mend investigations to consider the dose–response rela-
tionship of PA and type 2 diabetes prevention in more
ethnically diverse population groups.
Overall, we found the dose–response curve for PA and
incident type 2 diabetes is curvilinear. Our study suggests that
notable health benefits of PA can be realised even at relatively
low levels of PA but also that considerable additional
decreases in risk for type 2 diabetes are afforded when sub-
stantially exceeding the current PA guidelines.
Our meta-analysis supports the generally accepted notion
of a graded association between PA and health maintenance
[78, 79]. It favours a ‘some is good but more is better’ guide-
line, in which specific targets are mainly used for a psycho-
logical effect. There is no clear cut-off at which benefits are
not achieved and health protection increases at activity levels
well beyond current recommendations. Enabling cultures and
built environments to increase PA at the population-wide level
may prevent substantial personal suffering and economic bur-
den. Given the current obesity and diabetes epidemic, the
utility of such a strategy may reach beyond any present-day
approaches to improve population health.
