Abstract
Background: The high-fat and high-sugar Westernized diet that is popular worldwide is associated with increased body fat
accumulation, which has been related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Without treatment,
NAFLD may progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a cancer with a high mortality rate. The consumption of broccoli
in the United States has greatly increased in the last 2 decades. Epidemiologic studies show that incorporating brassica
vegetables into the daily diet lowers the risk of several cancers, although, to our knowledge, this is the first study to
evaluate HCC prevention through dietary broccoli.
Objective: We aimed to determine the impact of dietary broccoli on hepatic lipid metabolism and the progression of
NAFLD to HCC. Our hypothesis was that broccoli decreases both hepatic lipidosis and the development of HCC in a
mouse model of Western diet–enhanced liver cancer.
Methods: Adult 5-wk-old male B6C3F1 mice received a control diet (AIN-93M) or a Western diet (high in lard and sucrose,
19% and 31%, wt:wt, respectively), with or without freeze-dried broccoli (10%, wt:wt). Starting the following week, mice
were treated once per week with diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 45 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, 11,
and 12 wk). Hepatic gene expression, lipidosis, and tumor outcomes were analyzed 6 mo later, when mice were 9 mo old.
Results: Mice receiving broccoli exhibited lower hepatic triglycerides (P < 0.001) and NAFLD scores (P < 0.0001),
decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.0001), suppressed activation of hepatic CD68+ macrophages (P <
0.0001), and slowed initiation and progression of hepatic neoplasm. Hepatic Cd36 was downregulated by broccoli feeding
(P = 0.006), whereas microsomal triglyceride transfer protein was upregulated (P = 0.045), supporting the finding that
dietary broccoli decreased hepatic triglycerides.
Conclusion: Long-term consumption of whole broccoli countered both NAFLD development enhanced by a Western diet
and hepatic tumorigenesis induced by DEN in male B6C3F1 mice.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)6, the term to describe
a cluster of related liver diseases that range from uncomplicated
steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis,
and potentially to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is prevalent
in the United States today, but there are few early symptoms (1).
Almost 1 in every 2 adult Americans has some degree of NAFLD
(2). Liver cancer is lethal and is the fifth most common cancer in
men worldwide, with a 5-y survival rate of 17% (3, 4). This
cancer is relatively preventable, because many of the risk factors
for liver cancer are related to diet, lifestyle, and infection (5).
Although >50% of HCC cases are related to hepatitis B viral

 infection, hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination (6, 7). It
has been reported that there is not only a greater prevalence of
NAFLD in the obese population than in people with normal
body weight (BW), but also a greater risk of mortality from liver
cancer (8, 9). According to the newest report from the World
Cancer Research Fund International, ‘‘body fatness’’ has been
officially added to the list of factors that increase the risk of liver
cancer (10). Fortunately, adiposity can be reduced by changing
lifestyle, such as increasing physical activity and altering dietary
patterns (11, 12).
The so-called Westernized diet, which is high in saturated fats
and sugars, is well rooted in the lifestyle of the majority of
Americans. Over 35% of daily energy consumed by Americans is
from solid fat, including trans fats and saturated fats, and added
sugars (13). Excess consumption of saturated fats and sugars,
including sucrose, not only contributes to adiposity but also to
the progression of NAFLD. SFAs are a poor source of energy,
because they are not the primary substrate for b oxidation, and
tend to be directed toward storage (14). In the liver, SFAs can
increase endoplasmic reticulum stress and free radical produc-
tion in the mitochondria, promoting the development of NASH
(15). Moreover, fructose, which can be ingested directly or in the
form of sucrose, is a highly lipogenic nutrient, enhancing hepatic
lipid accumulation through de novo lipogenesis (16). Therefore,
a Westernized diet disrupts lipid homeostasis and oxidative
balance in the liver and worsens the development of NAFLD.
Broccoli, a brassica vegetable containing multiple bioactive
compounds, including vitamin C, flavonoids, and glucosino-
lates, has shown substantial market growth in the last 20 y (17,
18). Epidemiologic studies show that incorporating brassicas
into the daily diet can decrease cancer risk at several tissue
sites, including the bladder, breasts, prostate, and colon (19–22).
A clinical trial in China found that consuming tea from a
boiling-water infusion of broccoli sprouts may decrease urinary
concentrations of aflatoxin-N7-guanine, an aflatoxin–DNA
adduct metabolite and biomarker (23). This finding suggests
that brassicas may protect against liver cancer by decreasing
aflatoxin bioactivation, but there are no direct reports of
protection against liver cancer. However, preliminary studies
suggested that broccoli impedes the development of NAFLD by
decreasing hepatic triglyceride (HTG) accumulation in mice fed
a Western diet (WD) (Y-J Chen, unpublished results, 2013).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the long-term consumption
of broccoli could regulate hepatic lipid metabolism, and thus
decrease the amount of hepatic lipidosis that is typically
increased by a WD. We further hypothesized that broccoli
could hinder the initiation of liver tumorigenesis by the hepatic
carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). To approach our goal,
adult B6C3F1 mice, a carcinogen-sensitive strain, were used
to observe the impact of broccoli on both the initiation and
progression of liver tumorigenesis. The expression of hepatic
lipid-metabolizing enzymes was evaluated to determine how
dietary treatments (including a Westernized diet high in saturated
fats and sucrose with a broccoli intervention) might interact to
affect hepatic lipidosis.
Methods
Mice and diets. Male 4-wk-old B6C3F1 mice (C57BL/6J 3 C3H/HeJ
hybrid) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed
individually under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22�C and 60% humidity.
Water and feed were consumed ad libitum. Mouse care was in
compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
the University of Illinois, according to NIH guidelines.
A powdered control (CON) diet was prepared by following the AIN-
93M formula with adjustments (24). The WD was formulated by
modifying the AIN-93M diet, increasing the sucrose and saturated fat
content (Supplemental Table 1). Freeze-dried broccoli powder (10% by
weight; Brassica oleracea L. var. Green Magic), kindly provided by John A
Juvik, University of Illinois, was incorporated into the broccoli diets, and
macronutrients were replaced to balance the diet for the composition of the
broccoli. Glucoraphanin (4.0 mmol/kg freeze-dried broccoli) was estimated
by adding water to allow myrosinase-dependent hydrolysis to sulforaphane
as previously reported (25). Diet ingredients were bought from Harlan.
Experimental design. Seventy-two 4-wk-old male B6C3F1 mice were
acclimated for 1 wk to the AIN-93M diet before starting diet treatments.
At the age of 5 wk, mice were divided into 4 groups and provided a CON
diet, a CON plus 10% broccoli diet, a WD, or a WD plus 10% broccoli
(Supplemental Table 1). One week later, DEN (Sigma-Aldrich) in saline
was given to mice (n = 12/group) at a dose of 45 mg/kg intraperitoneally
1 time/wk for 6 wk, with saline given as a vehicle control (n = 6/group),
forming 8 treatment groups: Saline (S)–no broccoli (NB)–CON, S–broccoli
(B)–CON, S-NB-WD, S-B-WD, DEN-NB-CON, DEN-B-CON, DEN-
NB-WD, and DEN-B-WD. There was a 1-wk interval after 3 injections,
for better recovery from DEN treatment (Supplemental Figure 1). BW
and feed intake were monitored weekly. Two DEN-treated mice died
during the injection period; 6 mice (1 in the DEN-NB-CON group, 2 in
the DEN-B-CON group, 1 in the DEN-NB-WD group, and 2 in the DEN-
B-WD group) were euthanized before the end of the study because of
serious illness. Mice were anesthetized using ketamine:xylazine mixture
(87 mg/mL:13 mg/mL) at 6 mo after starting the DEN treatments for
collection of blood samples, and then killed by cervical dislocation,
without recovering consciousness, for tissue collection and liver nodule
count (diameter $1 mm). Liver tissue was divided for biochemical analysis
(stored at –80�C) and histology (fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin).
HTG content. Liver lipid was extracted by the Folch method (26), with
some modifications. Liver tissue was homogenized and lipid was extracted
into chloroform:methanol (2:1, vol:vol) containing 0.01% butylated
hydroxytoluene. The homogenate was washed with ultrapure water and
centrifuged at room temperature (1080 3 g for 20 min) to collect the organic
phase. Chloroform was evaporated from the organic phase of the lipid
extract with mild heating (50�C) and a stream of nitrogen gas. The remaining
lipid extract was reconstituted with absolute ethanol for quantification. The
HTG concentration was determined by the glyceride phosphate oxidase
method with the use of a reagent kit (Pointe Scientific).
Liver histology. Liver samples from the left, median, and right lobes were
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections
of each lobe from hilar to lobe edge (3 mm thick) were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histologic examination. All histology
was carried out at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of
Illinois. Murine NAFLD scores and microscopic hepatic neoplasm–related
lesions were determined by a trained pathologist, based on the H&E-
stained sections. The scoring criteria are shown in Supplemental Table 2.
Plasma alanine aminotransferase concentrations. Plasma alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations were determined with the use of
a reagent kit (Pointe Scientific) in a 96-well format according to the
manufacturer�s instructions.
Immunoblotting. Liver tissue was homogenized 1:10 (wt:vol) with lysis
buffer (0.15 mol/L NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM
dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor cocktail). The
protein extract was separated by centrifugation (13,400 3 g; 30 min; 4�C).
Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Liver protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Health Care). After blocking in
5% nonfat dried milk, membranes were incubated with primary antimouse
antibodies (1:500) with the use of goat polyclonal anti–microsomal
triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
polyclonal anti–acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC; a form) (Cell Signaling
Technology), or rabbit polyclonal anti–b-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz

 Biotechnology) overnight at 4�C, and then incubated with goat
antirabbit or donkey antigoat IgG HRP secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h. Enhanced chemilu-
minescence of the immunocomplex was detected with the use of a
detection kit (GE Health Care). Chemiluminescence was visualized and
quantified with the use of ImageQuant LAS 4000 and IQTL software
(GE Health Care).
Real-time qPCR. Liver RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent (Life
Technologies), following the manufacturer�s instructions. RNA integrity
was monitored by 1% bleach agarose gel electrophoresis (27). Synthesis of
cDNA from RNA was conducted with the use of a reverse transcription
reagent kit (Life Technologies). PrimeTime qPCR 5#Nuclease primer and
probe sets (Integrated DNA Technologies) and TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix (Life Technologies; 4324020) were used for real-time qPCR.
Hepatic gene expression of Cd36, Cd68, tumor necrosis factor (Tnf),
interferon g (Ifng), fatty acid synthase (Fasn), carnitine palmitoyltransfer-
ase 1a (Cpt1a), cytochrome P450 2E1 (Cyp2e1), and Gapdh (a house-
keeping gene), were quantified. Sequences for primer sets and probes are
shown in Supplemental Table 3. Thermal cycler procedures, including
50�C for 2 min, 95�C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95�C for 15 s and 60�C
for 1 min, were conducted with the use of the 7900HT Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Life Technologies). Data were analyzed with the use of the
comparative threshold cycle method, and expressed as fold change (28).
Statistical analysis. All results, except liver tumor– and neoplasm-
related lesion incidence, are expressed as mean 6 SD and were analyzed
by a 2- or 3-factor ANOVA for the effect of DEN, broccoli, WD, and
interactions, followed by Scheff´
e�s test when the differences were
indicated. Differences in liver tumor– and neoplasm-related lesion
incidence were evaluated by a Fisher�s exact test. Correlation between
liver and epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) weights among the high-BW
(final BW >40 g) mice (n = 53; 6 from the S-NB-CON group, 6 from the
DEN-NB-CON group, 6 from the S-B-CON group, 6 from the DEN-B-
CON group, 6 from the S-NB-WD group, 8 from the DEN-NB-WD
group, 6 from the S-B-WD group, and 9 from the DEN-B-WD group)
was analyzed by Pearson�s correlation coefficient. A P value of < 0.05
was considered to be significant in this study. All statistical analyses were
performed with the use of SAS 9.4 software.
Results
Dietary broccoli decreased relative liver mass but not BW.
Feed intake was decreased in the DEN-treated mice through the
age of 12 wk (the last DEN injection). Although the difference
was resolved when DEN administration concluded from 13 wk of
age, the effect of DEN was evident again by the end of the study
(week 36; Supplemental Table 4). Moreover, broccoli had no
impact on feed intake independent of DEN treatment and the WD
(Supplemental Table 4). Final BW was increased by the WD but
not influenced by broccoli (Table 1). However, DEN treatment
exerted a negative impact on BW, adversely affecting BW increase
during the period of DEN treatments, resulting in a decreased final
BW (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 2). Although broccoli
showed no impact on final BW, it did decrease relative liver mass
(Table 1). The WD not only increased body mass but also relative
liver mass, whereas DEN treatments had no influence on liver as a
percentage of BW (Table 1). Unexpectedly, relative EAT mass was
decreased by the WD but increased with DEN treatments (Table 1).
Upon further examination, it became evident that the absolute liver
and EAT masses were negatively correlated (r = 20.71, P < 0.0001,
data not shown), but only in the high-BW mice (final BW >40 g).
The WD resulted in liver damage and increased HTG
accumulation, whereas dietary broccoli blocked these
effects. Feeding a WD increased plasma ALT concentrations,
suggesting liver damage, but DEN treatments had no effect on

 plasma ALT (Figure 1). Dietary broccoli exerted a substantial
protective effect, with decreased plasma ALT, independent of
any effect from WD or DEN treatments (Figure 1). Moreover,
HTG density was decreased by broccoli, but there was no impact
of the WD or DEN treatment on HTG density (Table 1). HTGs
were decreased by broccoli, whereas the WD increased HTGs
(Table 1). However, DEN-treated mice had lower HTGs than
did S-treated mice (Table 1). Representative hepatic histologic
images are shown in Figure 2. The NAFLD scores, which were
graded based on H&E-stained liver sections, showed a pattern
similar to that of HTGs, being increased by the WD and
decreased by broccoli, but these scores were not influenced by
DEN treatment (Table 1). Furthermore, in reviewing the NAFLD
scores, there was an interaction between the WD and DEN
treatments in that DEN treatment decreased the NAFLD severity
score in the WD group, but not in the CON group (Table 1).
Dietary broccoli decreased the expression of hepatic Cd36
and MTTP. Hepatic lipid metabolism was influenced by DEN
treatment, broccoli, and the WD in this study. The expression of
Cd36, a major FA transporter for the uptake of lipids into the
liver, was increased by the WD but decreased by long-term
consumption of broccoli (Table 2). The DEN treatment also
decreased hepatic Cd36 expression, but there was an overall
interaction between all treatments (Table 2). This 3-way interaction
indicates that, in mice not receiving the DEN treatment, there was
a significant broccoli 3 WD interaction (P < 0.05), in which a
broccoli-dependent decrease was seen in hepatic Cd36 expres-
sion in the CON-fed mice (P < 0.05), but this did not occur in the
WD-fed mice. Furthermore, there was no broccoli 3 WD
interaction in Cd36 concentrations in the DEN-treated mice.
Fasn, a critical enzyme for de novo lipogenesis, was down-
regulated by both the WD and the DEN treatment but not by
broccoli (Table 2). A similar effect was found for the protein
concentration of ACC, in which the WD decreased ACC expres-
sion (Figure 3A).
Mitochondrial b oxidation is tightly controlled by carnitine
palmitoyltransferase, which was downregulated by broccoli
and upregulated by the WD, but there was no significant
treatment effect of DEN treatment, broccoli, or the WD on
hepatic Cyp2e1, which is responsible for microsomal v oxida-
tion (Table 2). However, there was an interaction between the
DEN treatment and the WD, indicating that DEN treatments
enhanced Cyp2e1 expression in the WD-fed mice (Table 2).
Moreover, broccoli may downregulate Cyp2e1 in mice receiv-
ing a WD because of a broccoli 3 WD interaction (Table 2).
Our data show that MTTP, which is essential for VLDL
excretion, was increased by broccoli but decreased by the WD
(Figure 3B).
Hepatic Cd68, a marker of macrophage activation, was
decreased by dietary broccoli. Activated hepatic macro-
phages (monitored as Cd68 expression), including Kupffer cells
(KCs) and infiltrating macrophages, were increased by the WD
and the DEN treatment (Table 2). However, the broccoli-fed
mice showed a decreased expression of hepatic Cd68 (Table 2).
Moreover, broccoli also downregulated Tnf expression in the
liver (Table 2). Hepatic Ifng, a cytokine that triggers the
activation of macrophages, was downregulated by broccoli as
well (Table 2). The interaction between broccoli and the DEN
treatment indicates that the suppression of Ifng expression by

 broccoli was greater when there was a DEN carcinogen
challenge (Table 2).
Long-term consumption of broccoli decreased liver nod-
ule numbers. The formation of liver nodules was induced by
DEN, and both liver nodule number and size, as well as hepatic
adenoma incidence, were increased by the WD (Table 3). However,
broccoli showed a substantial protective effect, decreasing liver
nodule numbers (Table 3). As expected, there were no microscopic
hepatic neoplasm–related lesions seen in liver sections from the
DEN-B-CON group, and a lower total hepatic neoplasm–related
lesion incidence in the DEN-B-WD group, compared with the
DEN-NB-WD mice (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, DEN administration retarded the growth of mice,
possibly because of decreased feed intake during administration.
DEN may have caused acute toxicity, leading to the temporary
reduction in feed intake that we observed. A similar result has
been reported for a DEN rat model, in which BWand feed intake
were both adversely affected immediately after DEN adminis-
tration (100 mg/kg BW) (29). In adult mice, a single high dose of
DEN (80 mg/kg BW) also has been reported to cause a loss of
BW (30). Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between
lipodystrophy as measured by EAT and hepatomegaly for mice
with a high BW, which also has been reported in a murine high-
fat diet model in which EAT mass increased with growing BW
during the first 12 wk of the diet; however, when BW was >40 g,
a negative correlation (r = 20.85) was observed (31). This
hepatomegaly-related lipodystrophy could be tissue-specific,
because the subcutaneous inguinal adipose mass has been
reported to increase with the feeding of a long-term high-fat
diet, showing no tendency toward weight loss, regardless of the
weight of the mice (31, 32).
This study revealed that broccoli had an impact on the HTG
pool by decreasing HTGs and lipidosis in both the CON and
WD groups, which is consistent with reports of the impact
of isolated bioactives from broccoli. Sulforaphane, the hydro-
lyzed glucosinolate product that is rich in broccoli, has been
reported to show the potential to decrease HTG concentrations
in mice receiving a high-fat diet, but the effect was not significant
(33). Our results suggest that the whole broccoli intervention
exerted a substantial beneficial health effect. Furthermore, the
broccoli diets in our study, which contained only 0.4 mmol
glucoraphanin/kg diet, showed a greater influence on hepatic
lipid regulation than pure sulforaphane, which was given at a
substantially greater dose (5.6 mmol/kg) (33). This phenomenon
has been noted for other endpoints in our previous study (34). A
recent clinical study has identified that 400 g broccoli/wk for
12 wk significantly decreases plasma LDL cholesterol (35).
Although that study did not include obese subjects, it suggests
that broccoli may affect hepatic lipid metabolism in humans. A
clinical study of obesity, NAFLD, and broccoli ingestion should
be carried out to translate our findings to human health.
Notably, the WD had opposing impacts on HTG concentra-
tions and NAFLD scores in the DEN-treated mice, showing that
the DEN-NB-WD group had lower NAFLD scores than did the
DEN-NB-CON group, but exhibited elevated HTGs. These
divergent results are possibly a distortion because of interference
by the presence of hepatic preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions.
It has been reported that it is rare for liver tumors to contain a
high quantity of fat in humans (36). Moreover, in the end stage

 of NAFLD, the initiation of HCC is considered to be related to
cirrhosis (37). It has also been observed that, in NAFLD
patients, once cirrhosis develops, hepatic lipid accumulation
decreases without BW loss (38). These reports suggested that
cirrhotic tissue or liver tumor tissue, which could be responsible
for a substantial amount of the liver weight in the DEN-NB-WD
group, may have relatively little TG compared with simple
(uncomplicated) steatosis, as found in the S-NB-WD mice.
Therefore, although the DEN-NB-WD mice had a greater liver
mass than the DEN-NB-CON mice, the lack of homogeneity in
liver tissue actually may have resulted in less total lipid. Also, the
decrease in NAFLD score that we observed in the DEN-NB-WD
group, as well as the loss in BW during the final month before the
end of the study (33–36 wk of age; Supplemental Figure 2), may
reflect the severity of liver tumorigenesis.
HTGs mainly derive from circulating nonesterified fatty acids
(NEFAs; 60%), whereas minor sources are de novo lipogenesis
(25%) and dietary fat (15%) (39). The liver can obtain NEFAs
from the circulation by both passive diffusion and facilitated
uptake by membrane FA transporters (40). The FA translocator
CD36 facilitates the hepatic uptake of long-chain FAs, and is
highly upregulated during the progression of NAFLD, compared
with other FA transporters, such as FA binding protein and
caveolin (41, 42). The present results show that broccoli
decreased hepatic Cd36 expression by as much as 35% (Table
2), which could have greatly reduced the influx of NEFAs, the
major source of HTGs. Moreover, an increased expression of
MTTP in broccoli-fed mice may imply enhanced excretion of
VLDLs, which also may contribute to the reduction of HTG
deposition. In contrast, the WD had a negative effect on MTTP.
Although plasma lipoproteins were not estimated in this study,
MTTP is critical for VLDL formation (43). Future studies could
determine whether plasma VLDLs are decreased in mice
receiving a WD, but elevated by broccoli feeding.
Several clinical studies suggest that de novo lipogenesis is
elevated in NAFLD. Liver biopsy shows that the expression of
the lipogenic enzymes Fasn and Acc are both upregulated in
patients diagnosed with NAFLD (44). Furthermore, people
diagnosed with NAFLD excrete more TGs generated from de
novo hepatic lipogenesis (45). However, in our study, long-term
broccoli consumption had no impact on Fasn or ACC, which
were significantly decreased, not increased, by the WD. Al-
though high-fat diets (with or without high carbohydrate) are
able to increase de novo lipogenesis in rodents (46), diet-induced
hepatic steatosis models have not always provided consistent
results (47–50). The cause of this discrepancy in reports is still
not understood, but it might relate to feedback mechanisms
from the high-fat diet that develop over time (51).
Our data indicate that the WD raised hepatic Cpt1a
expression, suggesting an increased influx of FAs into the
mitochondria for hepatic b oxidation, whereas broccoli exerted
the converse effect. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen
species (ROS) through incomplete reduction of oxygen in the
electron transport chain, releasing superoxide anions (52). High
dietary fat may cause the mitochondrial lipid overload and
increased uptake of oxygen needed for b oxidation, potentially
leading to enhanced superoxide production (53, 54). Further-
more, the metabolic enzyme Cyp2E1 not only oxidized FAs
through the v-oxidation pathway, but also generated ROS (55).
Therefore, although upregulated FA oxidation can promote the
utilization of lipid, it can also cause oxidative stress and increase
the production of ROS, a second hit known to cause liver
inflammation and damage in the 2-hit model for the develop-
ment of NASH (56, 57).
The bioactivation of DEN is highly controlled by Cyp2E1
(58), and a high-fat diet can increase hepatic Cyp2e1 expression
(59), suggesting that the WD might upregulate Cyp2E1- and
DEN-induced carcinogenesis. Separately, sulforaphane and
phenethyl isothiocyanate, isothiocyanates from broccoli, have
been reported to decrease Cyp2E1 activity (60–62). Further-
more, phenethyl isothiocyanate is also reported to inhibit
cytochrome P450 1A and cytochrome P450 3A activity (62).
Our results are consistent with broccoli protection from
increased DEN bioactivation by the WD. The nuclear factor
(erythroid-derived 2)–like 2 pathway, activated by broccoli
components and promoting phase-2 and antioxidant enzymes
(25), may be downregulated by DEN (63). Thus, a WD may
increase the bioactivation of DEN and support the promotion of
tumorigenesis, as was evident in this study.
Our results also show that the WD and DEN enhanced the
activation of hepatic macrophages, including KCs, whereas
broccoli exhibited a counter-effect, downregulating Tnf and

Broccoli protects against NAFLD and liver cancer

 suppressing the expression of the activated macrophage bio-
marker Cd68. The activation of KCs is considered to contribute
greatly to the progression of NAFLD (64, 65). Activated KCs
are also critical in triggering the development of NASH from
hepatic steatosis (66). C–C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCL2)
promotes TNFa production in KCs and the recruitment of bone
marrow-derived macrophages (66, 67). Furthermore, elevated
concentrations of circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein
1, the CCL2 ligand, have been reported in NASH patients (68).
Therefore, broccoli, by inhibiting KC activation, may impede
not only the promotion of hepatic steatosis, but also of NASH.
Future studies could determine whether CCL2 or its ligands are
altered by broccoli feeding.
As expected, the WD increased liver nodule size and number,
which was also reported in a similar model that used a high-fat
diet (30). It should be noted that this study uncovered an effect of
broccoli on both the initiation and progression of liver tumori-
genesis; there were no microscopic hepatic neoplasm–related
lesions in the DEN-B-CON group, indicating that broccoli can
suppress the initiation of hepatic neoplasms by DEN. However,
although the DEN-NB-WD and DEN-B-WD groups showed a
similar incidence of altered hepatic foci, which are preneoplastic
lesions that have the potential to progress to hepatic adenomas
and possibly HCC (69), there was a lower incidence of hepatic
adenoma in DEN-B-WD mice, suggesting a delay or inhibition of
the progression of preneoplasia to neoplasia, rather than a
complete blockage of tumorigenesis. To our knowledge, our study
is the first to show protection against murine liver cancer by the
consumption of broccoli, and adds support to the accumulating
knowledge showing that broccoli effects in whole-animal cancer
studies reflect the positive implications in human studies in which
broccoli-sprout tea possibly may slow or inhibit aflatoxin-
induced liver cancer (23). It would certainly be interesting to
carry out a study on the prevention of aflatoxin-induced liver
cancer with the use of broccoli in mice.
In conclusion, broccoli consumption decreased hepatic lipidosis
in mice receiving both the CON diet and the WD, without changing
body mass. The data support the possibility that the lowering of
HTGs by broccoli may be due to a decreased influx of NEFAs and
increased efflux or excretion of VLDLs. In this study, daily
consumption of broccoli was able to suppress the activation of
hepatic macrophages, decrease liver damage, and protect against the
initiation and progression of liver tumorigenesis. Broccoli promoted
liver health and countered NAFLD development. In this age during
which obesity is such a problem, including broccoli in the diet may
have substantial public health implications for maintenance of a
healthy liver, particularly in those who are greatly overweight.
