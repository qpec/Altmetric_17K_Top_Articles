ABSTRACT
Importance: Case reports describe persistent erectile dysfunction (PED) associated
with exposure to 5a-reductase inhibitors (5a-RIs). Clinical trial reports and the
manufacturers’ full prescribing information (FPI) for finasteride and dutasteride
state that risk of sexual adverse effects is not increased by longer duration of 5a-RI
exposure and that sexual adverse effects of 5a-RIs resolve in men who discontinue
exposure.
Objective: Our chief objective was to assess whether longer duration of 5a-RI
exposure increases risk of PED, independent of age and other known risk factors.
Men with shorter 5a-RI exposure served as a comparison control group for those
with longer exposure.
Design: We used a single-group study design and classification tree analysis (CTA)
to model PED (lasting �90 days after stopping 5a-RI). Covariates included
subject attributes, diseases, and drug exposures associated with sexual dysfunction.
Setting: Our data source was the electronic medical record data repository for
Northwestern Medicine.
Subjects: The analysis cohorts comprised all men exposed to finasteride or
dutasteride or combination products containing one of these drugs, and the
subgroup of men 16–42 years old and exposed to finasteride �1.25 mg/day.
Main outcome and measures: Our main outcome measure was diagnosis of
PED beginning after first 5a-RI exposure, continuing for at least 90 days after
stopping 5a-RI, and with contemporaneous treatment with a phosphodiesterase-5
inhibitor (PDE5I). Other outcome measures were erectile dysfunction (ED)
and low libido. PED was determined by manual review of medical narratives for all
subjects with ED. Risk of an adverse effect was expressed as number needed to
harm (NNH).
Results: Among men with 5a-RI exposure, 167 of 11,909 (1.4%) developed PED
(persistence median 1,348 days after stopping 5a-RI, interquartile range (IQR)

 631.5–2320.5 days); the multivariable model predicting PED had four variables:
prostate disease, duration of 5a-RI exposure, age, and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Of 530 men with new ED, 167 (31.5%) had new
PED. Men without prostate disease who combined NSAID use with >208.5 days of
5a-RI exposure had 4.8-fold higher risk of PED than men with shorter exposure
(NNH 59.8, all p < 0.002). Among men 16–42 years old and exposed to finasteride
�1.25 mg/day, 34 of 4,284 (0.8%) developed PED (persistence median 1,534 days,
IQR 651–2,351 days); the multivariable model predicting PED had one variable:
duration of 5a-RI exposure. Of 103 young men with new ED, 34 (33%) had
new PED. Young men with >205 days of finasteride exposure had 4.9-fold higher risk
of PED (NNH 108.2, p < 0.004) than men with shorter exposure.
Conclusion and relevance: Risk of PED was higher in men with longer exposure to
5a-RIs. Among young men, longer exposure to finasteride posed a greater risk of
PED than all other assessed risk factors.

INTRODUCTION
There is conflicting information about sexual dysfunction associated with finasteride
and dutasteride, the two 5a-reductase inhibitors (5a-RIs) marketed in the US. Isozymes
5a-R1 and 5a-R2 are expressed in adult male human prostate, epididymis, seminal vesicle,
testis, genital skin, and brain (Aumu
¨ller et al., 1996; Hellwinkel et al., 2000; Nonomura
et al., 1990; Thiele et al., 2005; Thigpen et al., 1993) and 5a-R3 is expressed ubiquitously
in adult tissues (Godoy et al., 2011). Androgen receptors are expressed in both stromal
and endothelial cells of adult male human corpus cavernosum (Schultheiss et al., 2003),
which is functionally androgen-dependent in adult male humans (Rossi et al., 1998).
Local conversion by 5a-R1 and 5a-R2 of testosterone to the more potent androgen,
5a-dihydrotestosterone (5a-DHT), is essential for development and maintenance of
the normal structure and function of male reproductive tissues (Mahony et al., 1998;
Oztekin et al., 2012; Tomada et al., 2013); local conversion by 5a-R3 of testosterone to
5a-DHT in adipose tissue (Fouad Mansour, Pelletier & Tchernof, 2016) contributes to
systemic 5a-DHT levels.
Clinical development of finasteride followed observations that prepubertal castration
prevents androgenic alopecia (Hamilton, 1942) and that male pseudohermaphrodites
have nonpalpable prostates, scanty beards, and have neither androgenic alopecia nor
acne (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1974; Imperato-McGinley & Peterson, 1976; Walsh
et al., 1974). Pseudohermaphroditism is caused by loss-of-function mutation of the
5a-R2 gene, resulting in impaired conversion of testosterone to 5a-DHT, with varying
degrees of genital ambiguity at birth. Pseudohermaphrodites are often raised as
female but unexpectedly virilize at puberty, with partial masculinization of external

2/31
 genitalia (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1974; Sinnecker et al., 1996). The chemical
composition-of-matter patent for finasteride describes finasteride and related compounds
as “antiandrogenic by virtue of their ability to inhibit testosterone-5a-reductase”
(Rasmusson & Reynolds, 1988). Exposure of men to finasteride mimics hereditary
5a-reductase deficiency by preferentially inhibiting 5a-R2 (Gormley et al., 1990), inducing
a sex steroid profile “strikingly similar to that of pseudohermaphrodites” (Imperato-
McGinley et al., 1990), with a 70% reduction in serum 5a-DHT (Drake et al., 1999;
Grino, Griffin & Wilson, 1990; Marchetti & Barth, 2013; Roberts et al., 1999), corresponding
to “circulating levels of 5a-DHT similar to those following castration” (Stoner, 1990).
Dutasteride inhibits both 5a-R1 and 5a-R2, reducing serum 5a-DHT by 90%
(Rittmaster et al., 2008).
There is conflicting information about the effect of 5a-RIs on testosterone in humans.
Men exposed to finasteride had an increase over baseline of plasma testosterone levels;
among men with baseline testosterone in the lowest tertile, plasma testosterone peaked
at 1 year, then steadily declined, but did remain above baseline during the entire 4-year
study (Roehrborn et al., 2003). Men with prostatic hyperplasia who were exposed to
dutasteride had an increase over baseline of serum testosterone levels at one year (Hong
et al., 2010). However, a long-term study found that men with prostatic hyperplasia who
were exposed to finasteride had a progressive, and clinically significant, decline in
testosterone over 45 months (Traish et al., 2015a). In men exposed to finasteride for
one week, effective androgen levels in the prostate are similar to those in castrated men
(Geller & Sionit, 1992). There is little available information about the effect of 5a-RI
exposure on non-prostate genital tissues in humans. Chronic 5a-RI exposure in rats
increases apoptosis and autophagy in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, attenuating
erectile function (Zhang et al., 2013). Given the pattern of expression and activity of
androgen receptors and of 5a-reductases in multiple tissues and the marked effect of
5a-RIs on local and systemic 5a-DHT levels, it seems implausible that the anti-
androgenic effects of 5a-RIs in men would be limited to prostate and scalp tissue.
The 5a-RIs also induce a global defect in C19 and C21 5a-metabolism, inhibiting
5a-reduction of progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone,
corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1985; Traish et al.,
2015b) and thereby reducing levels of the brain neurosteroids that increase libido and
sexual arousal (Finn et al., 2006; Melcangi et al., 2013; Torres & Ortega, 2003; Trost, 2013).
The FDA granted marketing approval for finasteride 5 mg in 1992, finasteride 1 mg
in 1997, and dutasteride 0.5 mg in 2001. Per the full prescribing information (FPI),
finasteride 5 mg is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, reduce the
risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk of the need for surgery including
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and prostatectomy. Per the FPI, finasteride
1 mg is indicated for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia)
(Merck, 2014b). Per the FPI, dutasteride 0.5 mg is indicated for the treatment of
symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, reduce the
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
3/31
 risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk for the need for BPH-related surgery
(GlaxoSmithKline, 2014a).
The FPI for finasteride 1 mg states that, regarding the clinical trial experience,
“(t)here is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of
treatment with (finasteride 5 mg)” and “resolution (of sexual adverse experiences)
occurred in men who discontinued therapy with (finasteride 1 mg) due to these (sexual)
side effects and in most of those who continued therapy” (Merck, 2014b). The FPI for
finasteride 5 mg states that, regarding the clinical trial experience, “There is no evidence of
increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with
(finasteride 5 mg) (Merck, 2014c).” The FPI for dutasteride states, “In the three pivotal
placebo-controlled BPH trials with (dutasteride), each 4 years in duration, there was no
evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions : : : with increased duration of treatment”
(GlaxoSmithKline, 2014a).
Our recent meta-analysis of reports of clinical trials of finasteride for androgenic
alopecia found that adverse event reporting was of poor quality, systematically biased,
not generalizable to routine practice, and that most subjects had �1 year of finasteride
exposure (Belknap et al., 2015). Fifteen systematic reviews or meta-analyses of 5a-RI
clinical trial reports each concluded that 5a-RI-associated sexual adverse events are
infrequent, mild, and reversible. None of these prior meta-analyses assessed the
adequacy of evaluation of adverse events in primary clinical trial reports (Boyle, Gould &
Roehrborn, 1996; Chin, 2013; Edwards & Moore, 2002; Gacci et al., 2014; Gupta &
Charrette, 2014; Jimenez Cruz, Quecedo Gutierrez & Del Llano Senaris, 2003; Mella et al.,
2010; Oelke et al., 2015; Park & Choi, 2014; Tacklind et al., 2010; Trost, 2013; Varothai &
Bergfeld, 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2015). A meta-analysis of
clinical trials in men with prostatic hyperplasia found that the risk of ED was significantly
increased with combined 5a-RI plus a2 adrenergic receptor blocker compared to a2
adrenergic receptor blocker alone (Favilla et al., 2016). However, an observational study
found that the risk of ED was not increased with combined 5a-RI plus a2 adrenergic
receptor blocker compared to a2 adrenergic receptor blocker alone (Hagberg et al., 2016).
A case-control study found that sexual and erectile function of men exposed to finasteride
1 mg daily did not differ from controls (Tosti, Piraccini & Soli, 2001), and an observational
study found that sexual function in men did not decline over the first 4–6 months of
exposure to finasteride 1 mg (Tosti et al., 2004). Some commentators still assert that
5a-RIs are safe (Hirshburg et al., 2016; Mondaini et al., 2007; Singh & Avram, 2014).
There is limited information available about the effects of prolonged 5a-RI exposure
on risk of persistent erectile dysfunction (PED). A 4-year study found that the rate
of severe sexual adverse events was similar in subjects randomized to finasteride or
placebo and that the rate of persistence of sexual dysfunction in finasteride subjects
did not significantly differ from that in placebo subjects. However, this study relied
on spontaneous reports of subjects for detection of sexual adverse events and did not
use a validated measure of sexual function (Wessells et al., 2003). A report of a 5-year
study found that about 10% of men with prostatic hyperplasia experienced erectile
dysfunction (ED) with finasteride exposure but this report omitted mention of
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
4/31
 persistence of ED (Hudson et al., 1999). Another long-term study found a progressive
and sustained worsening of erectile function in men with prostatic hyperplasia who
had continued exposure to finasteride, with a clinically significant decline of six to
eight points in international index of erectile function (IIEF)-EF score over 45 months
(Traish et al., 2015a).
There are a disproportionate number of spontaneous reports of finasteride-associated
persistent sexual dysfunction in the FDA’s adverse event reporting system (Ali, Heran &
Etminan, 2015; Guo et al., 2016). There are also reports from uncontrolled case series
of PED, low libido, loss of penile sensitivity, and lowered testosterone levels in young
men that did not resolve after stopping finasteride (Chiriaco et al., 2016; Irwig, 2012a,
2012b, 2014; Irwig & Kolukula, 2011). Some reports describe men with symptoms
beginning within days of initiating finasteride and persisting for years after stopping
finasteride (Traish et al., 2011). PED has also been reported to occur with dutasteride
exposure (Tsunemi et al., 2016). A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
study found that men with sexual adverse effects that persisted despite stopping
finasteride did not have systemic androgen deficiency but did have fMRI responses to
erotic stimuli that were consistent with diminished sexual arousal and depression
(Basaria et al., 2016).
Given uncertainty about the frequency and severity of 5a-RI-associated sexual
dysfunction, we analyzed existing clinical data for a large cohort of men prescribed
finasteride or dutasteride to identify predictors of new PED. We hypothesized that longer
5a-RI exposure duration would increase the risk of PED. In addition to new PED, we
also analyzed this data to identify predictors of new ED and new low libido.
METHODS
This is a stratified, multivariable quasi-experimental cohort study of sexual dysfunction
in men exposed to 5a-RIs. A cohort of men, all of whom had 5a-RI exposure, was
evaluated to determine the variables that predict the occurrence of new ED, new low
libido, and new PED. Those men with shorter 5a-RI exposure served as a comparison
control group for men with longer 5a-RI exposure. Variables included subject attributes,
diseases, and drug exposures associated with sexual dysfunction. We used existing data
from electronic medical records and a single-group study design. We also performed a
naı
¨ve analysis comparing men with and without exposure to 5a-RIs. Our data source
was the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW), an electronic
medical record (EMR) data repository for patients of Northwestern Medicine. The
Northwestern University Institutional Review Board granted approval to conduct this
research and granted a waiver of informed consent (Approval reference STU00037913).
The clinicians providing medical care to these subjects and the subjects themselves
were unaware of this study of existing data. Eligible subjects for evaluation for new ED and
new low libido were men 16–89 years old with at least one clinical encounter and one
diagnosis from January 1992 to September 2015. Eligible subjects for evaluation for new
PED were men 16–89 years old with at least one clinical encounter and one diagnosis from
January 1992 to September 2013.

 Exposure to 5a-RIs and other drugs
We used medication history and e-prescriptions to identify men prescribed 5a-RIs, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, antidepressants, acyclovir-type
antivirals, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), including combination forms
(e.g., dutasteride + tamsulosin). Medication history was typically recorded by a mid-level
practitioner with independent confirmation by a physician or other prescriber and is
considered reliable at this institution. E-prescribing began in 2010; e-prescriptions were
entered directly by prescribers. Prescription data included prescription dates, drug name,
dose, and days of supply. Exposure duration was calculated as days from initial 5a-RI
prescription to either onset of the adverse effect or last appearance in dataset, with
omission of duplicate prescriptions and exclusion of intervals without documented 5a-RI
exposure. The analysis included separate variables for finasteride �1.25 mg vs finasteride
5 mg; dutasteride vs finasteride; and finasteride �1.25 mg vs (finasteride >1.25 mg or
dutasteride at any dose). We classified finasteride dosing as either �1.25 mg or >1.25 mg
because tablet splitting of the 5 mg finasteride oral solid dosage form was commonly used
to lower costs when prescribed for androgenic alopecia. For drugs approved after January
1992, assessment for drug exposure began with date of FDA approval for marketing.
Diagnoses, adverse effects, and other attributes
We used the term “impotence” for the database searches because this is the target term
to which synonyms are mapped in international classification of diseases codes (ICD-9),
and was thereby the term used for encoding structured data on diagnosis into the
EMR that was our primary data source. The International Conference for the Ninth
Revision of the International Classification of Diseases met in 1975; final proposals for
ICD-9 were ratified in 1978. Thus, the terminology for ICD-9 reflects that in use in the late
1970s. The term “impotence” is now deprecated in medical parlance and has been
replaced with the term “erectile dysfunction.” “Male erectile dysfunction” is the term
used in ICD-10. We used the term “prostate disease” to aggregate ICD-9 terms for
hyperplasia of the prostate, including with or without urinary obstruction, and with or
without other urinary symptoms.
For each subject, we identified physician-determined diagnosis of impotence (ED), low
libido, alopecia, prostate disease, prostate cancer, prostate surgery, Peyronie’s disease,
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, alcoholism, tobacco
use, depression, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) infection, and HIV infection
using ICD-9. Surgical procedures were encoded using ICD-9 procedure codes, AMA
current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and institution-specific billing codes. For
manual review of narratives, impotence (ED) was defined as “inability to initiate and
maintain erection sufficient for sexual intercourse.” We calculated body mass index
from measured weights (kg) and heights (m). Laboratory data included glycosylated
hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and magnesium. We assessed
extent of healthcare utilization as number of clinical encounters before onset of the
adverse effect, and also between initial 5a-RI exposure and onset of the adverse effect.
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
6/31
 The adverse effect of ED required both a physician-determined diagnosis of ED and
a contemporaneous prescription for a PDE5I during 1998 or later—when sildenafil, the
first PDE5I, became available. The adverse effect of low libido required a physician-
determined diagnosis of decreased libido. Designation of either new ED or new low libido
additionally required that there be no prior diagnosis of ED, nor of PDE5I use, nor of
low libido before initial 5a-RI exposure. PED additionally required description by a
physician in the clinical narrative of new ED lasting �90 days after stopping 5a-RI
(per FDA criterion for PED; Kothary, Diak & McMahon, 2011), as determined by manual
review; a second reviewer independently assessed the relevant text and rare differences
between reviewers were reconciled by consensus. The date of resolution of ED was that
reported by the subject and recorded by the physician in the clinical narrative or the
first encounter where the physician documented resolution, or the last encounter
where the physician recorded that the subject continued to experience ED. Thus, PED
required the simultaneous presence of a new diagnosis of an adverse effect (ED),
discontinuation of the suspect drug (5a-RI), new use of an antidote (PDE5I), and
documented persistence of the adverse effect after stopping the suspect drug (5a-RI).
This case definition of 5a-RI-associated PED is analogous to trigger tools that have
demonstrated high reliability in drug safety studies (Classen et al., 2011; Naessens et al.,
2009; Resar, Rozich & Classen, 2003).
Definition of cohorts of men without prior sexual dysfunction and
exposed to a 5a-RI
For the cohort of all men, we identified men prescribed a 5a-RI with no recorded
diagnosis of ED nor of low libido nor a record of PDE5I use prior to initial prescription
of a 5a-RI. For the cohort of young men, we identified men with 5a-RI exposure who
were 16–42 years old, had exposure to finasteride �1.25 mg/day, had neither exposure to
finasteride >1.25 mg/day nor exposure to dutasteride, nor prostate surgery, nor ED, nor
low libido, nor PDE5I use prior to finasteride exposure.
Statistical analysis
We used a single-group study design for the main analysis. The source data did not satisfy
the assumptions underlying analytical methods that are based on the general linear
model or maximum likelihood function (Grimm & Yarnold, 1995, 2000). Accordingly, all
analyses used optimal discriminant analysis, an exact, non-parametric statistical method
(Arozullah et al., 2003; Belknap et al., 2008; Nebeker et al., 2007; Smart et al., 2008) to
model ED, low libido, and PED. Use of these non-parametric methods simplifies and
standardizes presentation and interpretation of statistical findings, avoids certain
ambiguities that arise with alternative multivariable analytic methods, ensures valid
p-values, and also identifies models that maximize predictive accuracy (i.e., as opposed
to models that maximize explained variation or that maximize the value of the likelihood
function; Grimm & Yarnold, 1995, 2000; Linden & Yarnold, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d,
2016e; Linden, Yarnold & Nallamothu, 2016; Yarnold & Soltysik, 2005). All calculations
were either computed exactly or were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation.
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
7/31
 Univariable analyses were conducted using optimal data analysis (ODA) software
(Yarnold & Soltysik, 2005), and multivariable analyses using classification tree analysis
(CTA) software (Ostrander et al., 1998; Yarnold & Soltysik, 2016; Yarnold, Soltysik &
Bennett, 1997). These analyses identify the model that explicitly maximizes predictive
accuracy as indexed by the effect strength for sensitivity (ESS) statistic—a chance-
corrected and maximum-corrected measure of classification accuracy for which 0 is the
discrimination accuracy expected by chance and 100 is perfect intergroup discrimination
(Linden & Yarnold, 2016c; Yarnold, Soltysik & Bennett, 1997). As ODA analyses require
no distributional assumptions about the data, permutation probability is used to compute
statistical significance as exact p-values. Where multiple statistical hypotheses were
tested, the S
ˇida
´k multiple comparisons method was used to ensure the statistical reliability
at the experimentwise (p � S
ˇida
´k criterion) or the generalized (per-comparison p � 0.05)
criterion (Yarnold & Soltysik, 2005, 2016).
Results for univariable analyses of the relationship between adverse effects and
exposure variables are presented in descending order by ESS. The multivariable
relationship between adverse effects and exposure variables was modeled using
hierarchically optimal CTA, an algorithm that chains ODA analyses over all strata and
over each branch of the classification tree to explicitly maximize ESS for the overall
model. As with ODA, CTA analyses also require no distributional assumptions about
the data, so permutation probability is used to compute statistical significance as exact
p-values (Yarnold & Soltysik, 2016; Yarnold, Soltysik & Martin, 1994). Multivariable
models identified by CTA drew potential predictors from a pool of demographic
variables, subject attributes, healthcare utilization measures, disease classifications,
and drug exposures (Table 3). Multivariable model endpoints were constrained a priori
to be at least 10% of overall cohort size to insure adequate statistical power as well as to
inhibit overfitting (i.e., identifying strata with insufficiently large sample size) and
thereby improve reproducibility of the findings (Linden & Yarnold, 2016c; Yarnold &
Soltysik, 2016; Yarnold, Soltysik & Martin, 1994). Under this minimum sample size
constraint, the CTA algorithm uses a search procedure that explicitly assures that the
reported classification tree achieves greater accuracy than any other possible alternative
classification tree. We prospectively validated the CTA models of ED and low libido
in the subcohort of 5a-RI exposed men who had no identified sexual dysfunction
during the main study interval by using data from the 6-month interval immediately
following the end of the main study interval.
RESULTS
Demographics and naïve analysis in exposed vs non-exposed men
The repository contained medical records for 691,268 men (Table 1) of whom 17,475
(2.5%) had 5a-RI exposure; of these, 15,634 (89.5%) had no prior diagnosis of ED nor of
low libido, nor of PDE5I use. Men exposed to 5a-RIs were more likely than unexposed
men to have the diagnosis of ED (number needed to harm (NNH) 17.3, ESS 6.4%,
p < 0.0001) and of low libido (NNH 73.5, ESS 4.0%, p < 0.0001) and to have been
prescribed a PDE5I (NNH 10.6, ESS 5.8%, p < 0.0001) (Table 2A). There were 327,437

5a-RIs for several characteristics relevant to the frequency or to the detection of sexual dysfunction. Notably, exposed men had more years in the cohort (i.e., longer duration
of time represented in the medical record). Men exposed to finasteride �1.25 mg daily were younger and were less likely to have prostate disease than men exposed to
finasteride >1.25 mg daily or exposed to dutasteride.

¨ve analysis men exposed vs unexposed to 5a-reductase inhibitors. (A). Men exposed to 5a-RIs had a higher risk of erectile dysfunction (based solely on ICD-9
code), PDE5I use, and low libido in the cohort of all men. The higher risk was found for all men exposed to 5a-RIs vs unexposed, men exposed to either finasteride >1.25 mg
daily or to dutasteride vs unexposed, finasteride >1.25 daily vs unexposed, finasteride �1.25 mg vs unexposed, or dutasteride vs unexposed. (B). Men younger than 42
exposed to finasteride �1.25 mg/day had a higher risk of erectile dysfunction (based on ICD-9 code alone), PDE5I use, and low libido compared with unexposed men.

a Adverse event of erectile dysfunction is the earliest occurrence of ICD-9 code 607.84 or v41.7 after exposure to 5a-RI with a concurrent prescription for a PDE5I, and not present prior to exposure.
b Based on prescription dates in the electronic medical record.
c Based on ICD-9 codes in the electronic medical record.
d Men <42: Males between 16 and 42 years old (at time of first exposure to any 5-aRI), either not exposed to any 5-a reductase inhibitor or exposed to low-dose finasteride, excluding high-dose
5a-RIs.

 men 16–42 years old, with 743 exposed either to finasteride >1.25 mg/day or to
dutasteride, and 5,582 (1.7%) exposed to finasteride �1.25 mg/day. Compared to young
men without 5a-RI exposure, those young men with exposure to finasteride �1.25 mg/
day were more likely to have the adverse effect of ED (NNH 31.1, ESS 6.7%, p < 0.0001)
and of low libido (NNH 51.0, ESS 7.2%, p < 0.0001) (Table 2B). Among 16,032 men
with prostatic hyperplasia and with an encounter and a diagnosis recorded during 2014
(the last complete year in the dataset), 3,890 (24.3%) had 5a-RI exposure.
New erectile dysfunction and new low libido in men exposed to a 5a-RI
Among the 15,634 men with 5a-RI exposure and without prior sexual dysfunction,
699 (4.5%) developed new ED and 210 (1.3%) developed new low libido.
Univariable predictors for new erectile dysfunction and new low libido in
all men exposed
5a-Reductase inhibitor exposure duration was a significant predictor of new ED
(cutpoint >90.5 days of 5a-RI exposure, NNH 29.7, ESS 19.6%, p < 0.0001). Of the
29 significant predictors of new ED, four were more accurate predictors than 5a-RI
exposure duration: prostate disease, prostate surgery, number of encounters, and
number of encounters after 5a-RI exposure (Table 3A). Of the 15 significant predictors
of new low libido, 5a-RI exposure duration was the most accurate predictor (cutpoint
>96.5 days of 5a-RI exposure, NNH 76, ESS 24.8%, p < 0.0001) (Table 3A).
Multivariable models for new erectile dysfunction and new low libido in
all men exposed
The best multivariable model predicting new ED had four variables: prostate disease,
number of encounters after initial 5a-RI exposure, 5a-RI exposure duration, and age (ESS
33.5%, all p � 0.0001; prospective validity on 6-month holdout sample ESS 30.8%)
(Fig. 1A). Among men without prostate disease and with > 11.5 encounters after 5a-RI
exposure, the NNH for new ED was 37.7 for longer vs shorter 5a-RI exposure duration
(cutpoint >106 days of 5a-RI exposure). The multivariable model predicting new low
libido had four attributes: 5a-RI exposure duration, age, NSAID exposure (Y/N), and
total number of clinical encounters (ESS 36.6%, all p � 0.003; prospective validity on
6-month holdout sample ESS 34.2%) (Fig. 1B).
New persistent erectile dysfunction in men exposed to a 5a-RI
Of the 11,909 men with 5a-RI exposure and without prior sexual dysfunction and who
were evaluated for new PED, 167 (1.4%) developed new PED lasting for �90 days after
stopping the 5a-RI (median 1,348 days after stopping 5a-RI, interquartile range (IQR)
631.5–2,320.5 days). Of the 530 men with new ED, 167 (31.5%) had new PED.
Univariable predictors for new persistent erectile dysfunction in all
men exposed
5a-Reductase inhibitor exposure duration was the third most accurate predictor of
PED (cutpoint >179.5 days of 5a-RI exposure, NNH 88.6, ESS 20.4%, p < 0.0001).
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020

 Table 3 Univariate risk factors for new erectile dysfunction, new low libido, and new persistent erectile dysfunction. (A). For men exposed to 5a-RIs, there were 29
statistically significant risk factors (p < 0.05) predicting new erectile dysfunction after exposure to 5a-RIs. Number of days of 5a-RI exposure was the fifth most important risk factor
for new erectile dysfunction. Men with >90.5 days of 5a-RI exposure had a 2.2-fold higher risk of new erectile dysfunction compared with men with �90.5 days of 5a-RI exposure.
There were nine statistically significant risk factors (p < 0.05) predicting new low libido after exposure to 5a-RIs. Number of days of 5a-RI exposure was the most important risk
factor for new low libido. Men with >96.5 days of 5a-RI exposure had a three-fold higher risk of new low libido compared with men with �96.5 days of 5a-RI exposure. (B). For
men exposed to 5a-RIs, there were 26 statistically significant risk factors (p < 0.05) predicting new persistent erectile dysfunction after exposure to 5a-RIs. Number of days of 5a-RI
exposure was the third most important risk factor for new persistent erectile dysfunction. Men with >179.5 days of 5a-RI exposure had a 2.3-fold higher risk of new persistent
erectile dysfunction compared with men with �179.5 days of 5a-RI exposure. For men younger than 42 years and exposed to 5a-RIs, there were nine statistically significant risk
factors (p < 0.05) predicting new persistent erectile dysfunction after exposure to 5a-RIs. Number of days of 5a-RI exposure was the most important risk factor for new persistent
erectile dysfunction. Men with >205 days of 5a-RI exposure had a 4.9-fold higher risk of new erectile dysfunction compared with men with �205 days of 5a-RI exposure.

Figure 1 Classification tree analyses for erectile dysfunction and low libido in men prescribed
5a-reductase inhibitors. The two classification trees shown are those that predicted, respectively,
new erectile dysfunction or new low libido after 5a-RI exposure with greater accuracy than any other
possible alternative classification tree given the pool of exposure variables in Table 3. (A) This optimally
predictive multivariable model for new erectile dysfunction had four variables: prostate disease, number
of encounters between 5a-RI exposure and onset of impotence, age, and number of days on 5a-RIs. Men
with no prostate disease, >11.5 clinical encounters, and >106 days of 5a-RI exposure had a 5.3% rate of
new erectile dysfunction. (B) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new low libido had four
variables: number of days of 5a-RI exposure, age, use of prescribed NSAIDs, and total number of clinical
encounters. Men with >96.5 days of 5a-RI exposure, age �73.5 years, and use of NSAIDs had a 3.5% rate
of new low libido.

 Of the 26 statistically significant predictors of PED, only prostate surgery and prostate
disease were more accurate predictors than 5a-RI exposure duration (Table 3B).

Figure 2 Classification tree analyses for persistent erectile dysfunction in men prescribed
5a-reductase inhibitors. The two classification trees shown are those that predicted new persistent
erectile dysfunction in, respectively, all 5a-RI exposed men or in all 5a-RI exposed men <42 years old
with greater accuracy than any other possible alternative classification tree given the pool of exposure
variables in Table 3. (A) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new persistent erectile
dysfunction in all men had four variables: prostate disease, number of days on 5a-RIs, age, and use of
prescribed NSAIDs. Men with no prostate disease, >208.5 days on 5a-RIs, and use of prescribed NSAIDs
had a 2.1% rate of new persistent erectile dysfunction. The median duration of new persistent erectile
dysfunction was 1,348 days. (B) This optimally predictive multivariable model for new persistent
erectile dysfunction in finasteride exposed men <42 years old had one variable: number of days on
finasteride. Men with >205 days on finasteride had a 1.16% rate of new persistent erectile dysfunction.
The median duration of new persistent erectile dysfunction was 1,534 days.
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
17/31
 NSAID exposure had a risk of new PED that was 4.8-fold higher than men with shorter
exposure (cutpoint >208.5 days of 5a-RI exposure, NNH = 59.8, all p < 0.002).
New persistent erectile dysfunction in men 16–42 years old and
exposed only to finasteride £1.25 mg/day
Of 4,284 young men exposed to finasteride �1.25 mg/day, and without prior sexual
dysfunction and who were evaluated for new PED, 34 (0.79%) developed PED (median
1,534 days after stopping 5a-RI, IQR 651–2,351 days). Of 103 young men with new
ED, 34 (33%) had new PED.
Univariable predictors for new persistent erectile dysfunction in young
men exposed to finasteride �1.25
Of the nine significant predictors of new PED in young men, duration of finasteride
exposure was the most accurate predictor (cutpoint >205 days of finasteride exposure,
NNH 108.2, ESS 28.1%, p < 0.004) (Table 3C).
Multivariable model for new persistent erectile dysfunction in young
men exposed to finasteride �1.25
The best multivariable model predicting new PED had one variable: duration of
finasteride exposure. Compared to young men with shorter exposure, those young
men with longer 5a-RI exposure had a 4.9-fold higher risk (cutpoint >205 days of
finasteride exposure, NNH 108.2, ESS 28.1%, p < 0.004) (Fig. 2B).
DISCUSSION
Among an estimated 14 million US men with symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia
(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2015), 5a-RI exposure
rose from 4.3% in 1993 to 15.2%, or 2.1 million men, in 2010 (Filson, Wei &
Hollingsworth, 2013). An estimated half-million additional men were prescribed
finasteride for androgenic alopecia in 2011 (Merck, 2011). Prescribers and patients might
reasonably expect that accurate information would be available about the frequency,
severity, and persistence of a common adverse effect of a drug approved for marketing
more than two decades ago and prescribed to an estimated 2.6 million men annually.
However, a meta-analysis of 34 reports of clinical trials of finasteride for androgenic
alopecia found inadequate safety reporting and systematic underreporting of adverse
events (Belknap et al., 2015), exemplifying a known flaw in the detection or reporting of
adverse drug effects in the medical literature (Kostoff, 2016). While a few reports of trials of
5a-RIs for prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms provide assessments of
sexual dysfunction using universal evaluation and validated instruments (Fwu et al.,
2014); most rely on spontaneous voluntary reporting for adverse event detection and on
global introspection for causality assessment (Belknap et al., 2013); these methods are
considered unreliable for detecting and evaluating adverse events in general (Arimone
et al., 2007; Koch-Weser, Sellers & Zacest, 1977; Kramer et al., 1985), and sexual dysfunction
in particular (Althof et al., 2013; Moore, 2015). Since the introduction of the IIEF in 1997
(Rosen et al., 1997, 1999), the IIEF has been routinely used in clinical trials of PDE5Is to
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
18/31
 assess their efficacy for treatment of sexual dysfunction (Vardi & Nini, 2007). In contrast,
the IIEF has rarely been used for assessing sexual adverse effects in clinical trials of 5a-RIs,
although many such trials occurred after 1997. An uncontrolled study in 55 men reported
that moderate to severe ED (IIEF score <17) was present in 38% of men after 1 month of
dutasteride exposure and in 22% of men after 12 months of dutasteride exposure (Chi &
Kim, 2011). Despite assertions to the contrary (Singh & Avram, 2014), there is scant
available clinical trial data bearing on persistence of sexual dysfunction after 5a-RI
exposure. In an oft-cited report on the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, some sexual
dysfunction variables apparently were not analyzed at all, and adverse effect outcomes
were not reported for those subjects who temporarily or permanently discontinued study
drug, even though sexual dysfunction was the most common reason for early termination
of subjects (Moinpour et al., 2007). In our previous study, we found that 20% of serious
adverse events that occur during cancer clinical trials are not reported to an Institutional
Review Board and likely were not detected at all by the investigators (Belknap et al., 2013).
Such flaws in the design and analysis of clinical trials of 5a-RIs have created a knowledge
gap regarding risk of 5a-RI-associated severe sexual dysfunction. Similar flaws in clinical
trials resulted in multi-decade delay in recognition of the high frequency of sexual
dysfunction associated with thiazide diuretics (Langford et al., 1990), b-adrenergic
antagonists (Doumas et al., 2006), and antidepressants (Khazaie et al., 2015).
Our data show that, in a cohort of men exposed to 5a-RIs, the duration of 5a-RI
exposure was a more accurate predictor of PED than many known risk factors, including
age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, ethanol abuse, obesity, and
depression. In our data, confounding by age or extent of healthcare utilization did not
account for the increased risk of PED associated with longer 5a-RI exposure duration
(Table 3, Figs. 2A and 2B). Also, duration of finasteride exposure proved to be a more
accurate predictor of sexual dysfunction than higher dose vs lower dose of finasteride,
likely reflecting that finasteride exerts near-maximal inhibition of 5a-DHT synthesis at a
dose of 1 mg (Drake et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 1999; Shukla, 2011).
A limitation of our study is the potential for confounding by factors associated with
5a-RI exposure. To address this limitation, our experimental design and statistical
analyses included provisions to avoid or mitigate such confounding. We included an
extensive set of potential confounders in the analyses, including measures of extent of
healthcare utilization, age, BMI, comorbid conditions, and concomitant drugs. We made
no a priori assumption about the structure of the predictive multivariable models. To
reduce heterogeneity, we used a single-group experimental design (Corrao et al., 2014),
excluding men who were not prescribed a 5a-RI. We required both diagnosis of ED and
prescription of a PDE5I for designation of ED as well as physician description in the
narrative for designation of PED. While unmeasured clinical or behavioral attributes may
exist, our finding of a consistent effect provides evidence of an intrinsic relationship
between duration of 5a-RI exposure and PED. We did not evaluate the extent to which
NSAID-associated sexual dysfunction represents either an adverse drug effect (Gleason
et al., 2011; Shiri et al., 2006) or confounding by indication for NSAIDs (Patel et al., 2015).
We did not evaluate other reported adverse effects associated with 5a-RI exposure,
Kiguradze et al. (2017), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.3020
19/31
 including other sexual effects (infertility, anorgasmia, and sexual anhedonia), genital
disorders (Peyronie’s Disease, penile or scrotal numbness, penile or scrotal shrinkage,
and infertility), physical effects (gynecomastia, muscle atrophy, thinning, and drying of
skin), cognitive disorders (memory impairment, slowed cognition, and confusion), or
psychological disorders (anxiety, depression, anhedonia, and insomnia) (Ganzer, Jacobs &
Iqbal, 2015).
The lower rate of detection of sexual dysfunction in older men likely reflects
diminished disclosure by older men and lower likelihood of inquiry about sexual health
by their physicians (Loeb et al., 2011). The predictor cutpoints for 5a-RI exposure
duration do not establish a safe threshold for exposure duration. Our use of a single-
group design for the primary analysis means that the observed NNH must be considered
as an upper bound, as all men in the study cohort were exposed to 5a-RIs. As our data
source was derived from an existing EMR system, detection of sexual dysfunction was
necessarily dependent on what clinicians entered into the medical record. Evaluations
using standardized instruments, such as the IIEF (introduced in 1997), were not routinely
recorded in the source medical record and thus was not reliably available for our study. We
expect that a clinical trial using randomization, placebo-control, universal evaluation,
and a validated measure of ED would give a higher attributable risk and therefore a
lower NNH.
Androgenic alopecia and prostatic hyperplasia are chronic, non-life-threatening
conditions. In 1994, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) provided a
guideline for assessment of the safety of drugs being developed to treat chronic, non-life-
threatening conditions. This guideline recommends that a cohort of 300–600 subjects
be exposed to the new drug for six months, and that 100 subjects be exposed for 1 year.
This guideline does not directly address the evaluation of resolution or persistence of
an adverse drug event (ICH, 1994). Although severe sexual dysfunction was a foreseeable
consequence of 5a-reductase inhibition, it is not clear if the pivotal clinical trials for
finasteride and dutasteride included assessment for persistent sexual dysfunction or other
severe sexual adverse effects. If there was meaningful assessment of persistent sexual
dysfunction in humans during the clinical development of the 5a-RIs, this does not
appear to have been reported in the medical literature, the FPI, or other publicly accessible
sources.
In conclusion, among men with 5a-RI exposure, duration of 5a-RI exposure was a
more accurate predictor of PED than all other assessed risk factors except prostate disease
and prostate surgery. Among young men with 5a-RI exposure, duration of 5a-RI
exposure was a more accurate predictor of PED than all other assessed risk factors. For
each 108 young men exposed for >205 days to the finasteride dose typically used for
androgenic alopecia (�1.25 mg/day), one additional young man experienced PED
when compared to those men with shorter exposure. The median duration of PED in
young men was 1,534 days. We expect that our finding of an association between
debilitating sexual dysfunction and exposure to finasteride or dutasteride will be of
particular interest to prescribers and patients considering medical management of
androgenic alopecia or symptomatic treatment of prostatic hyperplasia.
