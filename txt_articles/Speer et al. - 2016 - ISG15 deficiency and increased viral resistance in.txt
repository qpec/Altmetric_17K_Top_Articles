ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-a/b-induced ubiquitin-like protein. It exists as a free molecule,
intracellularly and extracellularly, and conjugated to target proteins. Studies in mice have
demonstrated a role for Isg15 in antiviral immunity. By contrast, human ISG15 was shown to
have critical immune functions, but not in antiviral immunity. Namely, free extracellular ISG15
is crucial in IFN-g-dependent antimycobacterial immunity, while free intracellular ISG15 is
crucial for USP18-mediated downregulation of IFN-a/b signalling. Here we describe
ISG15-deficient patients who display no enhanced susceptibility to viruses in vivo, in stark
contrast to Isg15-deficient mice. Furthermore, fibroblasts derived from ISG15-deficient patients
display enhanced antiviral protection, and expression of ISG15 attenuates viral resistance to
WT control levels. The species-specific gain-of-function in antiviral immunity observed in
ISG15 deficiency is explained by the requirement of ISG15 to sustain USP18 levels in humans,
a mechanism not operating in mice.

 I
nterferon-stimulated
gene
15
(ISG15)
is
an
interferon
(IFN)-a/b-inducible
ubiquitin-like
molecule.
It
has
two
ubiquitin-like domains and is synthesized from an immature
precursor by cleavage of a C-terminal extension peptide1. Mature
ISG15 has the LRLRGG sequence, which is also present at the C
terminus of mature ubiquitin. ISG15 exists in two distinct states:
as a free molecule (intracellular and extracellular) or conjugated
to target protein lysine residues (ISGylation)2–10. In a process
similar to ubiquitin ligation, ISGylation involves a conjugation
pathway including E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UBCH8) and E3 (HERC5,
EFP, HHARI) enzymes. ISGylation is reversed by the action
of the isopeptidase ubiquitin-specific
protease 18 (USP18;
UBP43)11,12. Accordingly, cells deficient in the conjugation
machinery
exhibit
absent
or
reduced
ISGylation,
while
Usp18-deficient cells exhibit high levels of Isg15 conjugates13.
All of the enzymes involved in ISGylation/de-ISGylation are
transcriptionally induced by IFN-a/b.
Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have ascribed an
antiviral role to ISG15. Mice lacking Isg15 exhibit enhanced
susceptibility to challenge with multiple viruses, including murine
gammaherpesvirus 68 (ref. 14), influenza A virus (IAV)14,
influenza B virus14,15, Sindbis virus14, vaccinia virus16, herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)14, Chikungunya virus17 and murine
norovirus18, yet no enhanced susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus19. In vitro
studies in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse lung
fibroblasts and RAW 264.7 cells have demonstrated an antiviral
role for Isg15 during Sindbis virus20, vaccinia virus16, Ebola
virus21, Dengue virus and West Nile virus22 infection, although
there are several reports of viruses exhibiting no enhanced
replication in the absence of Isg15 (murine gammaherpesvirus 68,
HSV-1, Sindbis virus, IAV14). ISG15 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown in human cells has also suggested an
antiviral
role
for
free
and/or
conjugated
ISG15
during
infection with numerous viruses, including IAV23, human
immunodeficiency virus24–26, Ebola virus21,27, human papilloma
virus28, VSV27, Japanese encephalitis virus15 and Sendai virus
(SeV)29. While these many studies have suggested an antiviral
role for ISG15, others have suggested no role at all; the one clear
exception is hepatitis C virus (HCV). In vitro studies of HCV
infection suggest that ISG15 exhibits proviral activity30,31. The
silencing of ISG15 in human hepatoma cells was found to lead to
an inhibition of HCV replication, increases in cell sensitivity
to IFN-a/b and accumulation of IFN-a/b-stimulated gene
products (ISGs).
Our studies on ISG15-deficient individuals have demonstrated
a critical role for free extracellular ISG15 in the induction of
IFN-g and protection against mycobacterial disease. These
findings were confirmed in Isg15-deficient mice9. Intriguingly,
there is no evident overlap in viral susceptibility phenotype
between mice
and
humans
lacking
ISG15.
Despite
being
serologically positive for numerous childhood viruses, such as
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein Barr virus, measles
virus, varicella-zoster virus, HSV-1 and -2, mumps virus, IAV
and hepatitis A virus, ISG15-deficient individuals exhibit no overt
susceptibility to viral disease9,10. We recently demonstrated that
human free intracellular ISG15 binds USP18, a negative regulator
of IFN-a/b signalling. This binding prevents the SKP2-mediated
degradation of USP18, and thus is critical for the accumulation of
USP18 and the appropriate regulation of IFN-a/b signalling.
Indeed, patients lacking ISG15, and consequently having low
USP18 levels, display higher steady-state levels of ISG transcripts
in whole blood than controls10,32.
We demonstrate that human cells deficient in ISG15 exhibit a
persistent elevation in ISG expression. We find that, not only
do humans deficient in ISG15 lack any overt susceptibility
to viral infection, but cells derived from these individuals
exhibit an enhancement of broad protection against viruses.
Complementation of ISG15-deficient cells with the wild-type
(WT) or conjugation-deficient DGG ISG15 alleles rescues both
WT levels of ISG expression and viral susceptibility. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that there is a species-specific interaction
between ISG15 and USP18. While humans require ISG15 for
USP18 stability and appropriate negative regulation of the IFN
response, mice lack this stable interaction and can regulate the
IFN response in the absence of Isg15.
Results
Persistent increase of ISG expression in cells lacking ISG15.
The ISG15-deficient individuals identified to date have been
infected with numerous childhood viruses, against which they
mounted a humoral immune response9,10. No overt viral illnesses
were documented in these patients, suggesting that ISG15 may
not be essential for immunity to these viruses. ISG15-deficient
patients may actually have a milder disease course than wild-type
individuals.
However,
this
is
difficult
to
demonstrate,
as
information about subclinical illness is often not transmitted by
patients to their doctors or noted by the doctors themselves. We
tested this hypothesis in vitro using hTert-immortalized dermal
fibroblasts derived from ISG15-deficient patients and relevant
WT controls. Human cells lacking ISG15 also have low USP18
levels (due to the lack of USP18 stabilization by ISG15) and high
levels of ISG transcripts, as documented ex vivo with leukocytes
from ISG15-deficient individuals10. We carried out in vitro
studies, monitoring the kinetics and persistence of ISG induction
by quantitative real-time PCR in WT and ISG15-deficient
fibroblasts during and after IFN priming, in which the cells
were pulsed with IFN-a2b for 12 h and then allowed to rest for
36 h. We determined mRNA levels for the IFN-induced protein
with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and myxovirus resistance
1 (MX1), from 12 h to 6 days post-IFN-a/b priming. The
expression levels of IFIT1 and MX1 transcripts during peak
induction and early dampening were similar between ISG15-
deficient and control cells (Fig. 1a). However, the time taken for
IFIT1 transcript levels to return to baseline after IFN priming
differed between control and ISG15-deficient cells. Specifically,
IFIT1 transcript levels remained significantly elevated for more
than 5 days in ISG15-deficient cells, whereas they returned to
basal levels within 2 days in control cells (Fig. 1a).
ISG15-deficient IFN-primed cells are resistant to viral infection.
ISG15-deficient patients had previously been infected with
HSV-1, HCMV and IAV, as indicated by the results of serological
tests10, but did not develop severe disease. We, therefore,
investigated whether the prolonged increase in ISG levels
affected the susceptibility of the patients’ cells to viral challenge.
When IFN-a/b-primed ISG15-deficient fibroblasts were infected
with HSV-1 (Fig. 1b), HCMV (Fig. 1c) or IAV (Fig. 1d) levels of
viral replication were significantly lower in ISG15-deficient cells
than in control cells. SeV, a murine paramyxovirus known to be
highly sensitive to human ISGs, also replicated significantly less
efficiently in IFN-a/b-primed ISG15-deficient cells (Fig. 1e).
Finally, we investigated whether ISG15-deficient cells were also
resistant to highly pathogenic viruses affecting humans that our
patients would have been unlikely to encounter, by infecting
control and ISG15-deficient fibroblasts with Rift Valley fever
virus (RVFV) and Nipah virus (NiV). Both of these viruses
also appeared to replicate less efficiently in IFN-a/b-primed
ISG15-deficient cells than in control cells (Fig. 1f,g), although
neither RVFV nor NiV reached statistical significance. Thus, the
prolonged induction of ISGs observed in ISG15-deficient human

 cells protects against viruses from multiple families, having both
RNA and DNA genomes, and causing both low and highly
pathogenic disease in normal healthy humans. These results
further suggest that viral infections in ISG15-deficient individuals
may follow an attenuated course with milder symptoms. Thus,
the in vivo clinical follow-up of ISG15-deficient individuals,
serological testing and the results of in vitro studies of
patient-derived cells all indicate a greater resistance to viral
challenge, consistent with a proviral role of ISG15 in humans.
WT or DGG ISG15 allele restores WT viral susceptibility. We
verified that the observed phenotype was due solely to the lack of
ISG15 by stably transducing ISG15-deficient patient and control
fibroblasts with lentiviral particles encoding ISG15 or control
luciferase10. The cells were subsequently infected with VSV,
another virus known to be sensitive to low levels of IFN-a/b.
Control fibroblasts displayed similar levels of VSV replication
with and without IFN-a/b priming, suggesting that most of the
ISG antiviral activity had declined during the post-priming rest
(Fig. 2a). By contrast, IFN-a/b-primed cells deficient in ISG15
displayed significantly lower levels of viral replication (Fig. 2a),
indicating a protracted antiviral state, as confirmed with other
viral challenges (Fig. 1b-g). The resistance phenotype was
confirmed using fibroblasts from the three ISG15-deficient

phenotypic
differences
in
viral
replication
were
observed
between control and ISG15-deficient fibroblasts infected with
VSV-expressing GFP (VSV–GFP), as assessed by fluorescence
microscopy (Fig. 2b,c). Complementation of ISG15-deficient
patient fibroblasts with WT ISG15, but not with control
luciferase, restored both ISG expression (Fig. 2d) and viral
replication (Fig. 2e) to the levels observed in the control cells.
We have previously shown that the conjugation-deficient mutant
of ISG15 (ISG15DGG) retains the ability to bind and stabilize
USP18, and is thus a functional negative regulator of IFN
signalling10. Accordingly, we used ISG15-deficient fibroblasts
transduced with ISG15DGG, which exhibit fully functional
downregulation
of
IFN
signalling
but
no
ISGylation,
to
determine the relative role of each function during viral
infection. As observed with WT ISG15, complementation with
ISG15DGG rescued both the ISG expression and VSV replication
phenotypes in ISG15-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 2d,e). Similar
results were obtained in A549 and Hela cells that were silenced
with siRNA targeting ISG15 or a non-silencing control. In both

 cell lines, knockdown of ISG15 enhanced ISG expression and
resistance to viral replication (Supplementary Fig. 2a-f). These
data demonstrate the dependence of the in vitro phenotype on
the ISG15 allele and suggest that, in human epithelial cells, the
dominant role of ISG15 during viral replication is the ISGylation-
independent downregulation of IFN-a/b signalling.
Isg15-deficient mice do not exhibit elevated ISG expression.
All of our observations, whether from the clinical history
of ISG15-deficient patients or from in vitro studies of ISG15-
deficient
patient-derived
cells,
point
to
a
lack
of
overt
susceptibility to viruses, and suggest that ISG15 may exhibit a
proviral role. We were unable to reconcile these data with the
numerous reports ascribing a critical antiviral role to Isg15 during
the infection of mice in vivo with multiple viruses (for example,
chikungunya virus17, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (ref. 14),
IAV14, influenza B virus14,33, Sindbis virus14, vaccinia16, HSV-1
(ref. 14) and murine norovirus18). We, therefore, analysed whole
blood from Isg15-deficient mice, to determine whether these
mice, like ISG15-deficient humans, also displayed elevated levels
of steady-state ISG expression in the absence of diagnosable
infection10. In unstimulated conditions, Ifit1 mRNA levels of
Isg15-deficient animals were similar to those of their age-matched
WT cagemates (Fig. 3a). This indicates a species-specific
difference in ISG regulation in the absence of ISG15. We then
hypothesized that, in natura, humans are constantly exposed to
environmental challenges that induce IFN-a/b, resulting in
persistently high levels of ISGs in ISG15-deficient individuals,
due to a lack of negative regulation. Our mice were not housed in
completely sterile conditions, but were nevertheless somewhat
shielded from true environmental exposure to microbes. IFN-a/b
induction was mimicked by injecting 10,000 U of type-I IFN
intraperitoneally into WT control and Isg15-deficient mice,
followed by analysis of the levels of ISG transcripts in whole
blood at multiple timepoints. As expected, the animals receiving
IFN injections displayed a robust increase in ISG expression
within 8 h that was fully resolved within 24 h. However, no
difference in ISG expression levels between Isg15-deficient and
WT mice was observed at any time point (Fig. 3b–d). For further
comparison with our results in human cells, primary MEFs
derived from both WT and Isg15-deficient mice were primed with
type-I IFN for 12 h, allowed to rest for 36 h and the levels of Ifit1
mRNA were analysed. No differences in Ifit1 expression levels
were observed between WT and Isg15-deficient cells at any time
point after IFN priming (Fig. 3e). These experiments suggest that
the impact of ISG15 on IFN-a/b-induced signalling may indeed
differ between humans and mice.
Isg15 does not sustain Usp18 levels in mice. Due to the
suboptimal levels of USP18, IFN-a/b signalling persists and ISG
transcripts accumulate in ISG15-deficient human cells10. We,
therefore, investigated whether late IFN-a/b signalling and Usp18
levels were also affected in Isg15-deficient murine cells. WT and
Isg15-deficient MEFs were subjected to prolonged stimulation
with IFN-b, and the levels of phosphorylated Stat2 and
IFN-stimulated proteins were measured by western blotting.
In contrast to what was observed for human fibroblasts, WT
and
Isg15-deficient
MEFs
accumulated
similar
levels
of
phosphorylated Stat2, Ifit2 and Usp18 over the time course of
the experiment (Fig. 4a). The IFN-a/b response was also studied
in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from WT,
Isg15-deficient or Ube1L-deficient (free Isg15 present, but no
ISGylation) mice. No major differences were observed between
the three strains, indicating that neither free, nor conjugated
Isg15 was required to stabilize Usp18 in mice (Fig. 4b). Similar
conclusions were drawn from studies of a murine fibroblast cell
line (LL171), in which Isg15 was silenced with siRNA (Fig. 4c).
These results provide strong evidence to suggest that, in the
mouse system, Isg15 is not involved in the Usp18-mediated
negative feedback loop.
USP18 stabilization by ISG15 is species-specific. The unique
properties of the USP18 or ISG15 orthologues, or of both of them,
may underlie the observed species-specific functional differences.

 79.7% similar. We confirmed that human ISG15 stabilizes
USP18 through ISGylation-independent binding10, since the
conjugation-deficient ISG15DGG mutant was able to stabilize
USP18 (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, co-expression of USP18 with
an unrelated protein (GFP) did not sustain USP18 levels
(Fig. 5b). The ISG15:USP18 complex could be detected by
co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP; Fig. 5c, lane 2) and was abolished
in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which alkylates
cysteine residues (Fig. 5c, lane 3). Yet, the ISG15:USP18 complex
retained NEM sensitivity even when we used the USP18-C64S
catalytic mutant, suggesting a role for cysteine residues outside of
the catalytic core (Fig. 5d).
Next, we tested whether murine Isg15:Usp18 complexes could
be detected by co-IP. Weak or completely absent interactions
between the two murine proteins was detected in co-IP assays
(Fig. 5e). However, USP18 is the cognate deISGylase both in
humans and mice. To further examine this interaction we used a
micropatterning approach to quantify the stability of the
ISG15:USP18 complex in living cells35. In this experimental
setup, the murine Usp18:Isg15 complex was observed, but it
exhibited reduced stability when compared to the human
complex
(Supplementary
Figs
3
and
4,
Supplementary
Movie 1 and Supplementary Methods). The controls for the
micropatterning and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
experiments are outlined in Supplementary Fig. 4. Next, we tested
whether transient co-expression of murine Isg15 and Usp18
influenced the levels of murine Usp18. Murine Isg15 failed to
sustain the level of murine Usp18 (Fig. 5f–h), in contrast to the
phenotype observed with the human orthologues. The inability of
overexpressed murine Isg15 to sustain murine Usp18 is consistent
with our functional data on the endogenous murine proteins
(Fig. 4) and with the comparable downregulation of IFN-a/b
responses in WT and Isg15-deficient mice in vivo (Fig. 3a–d).
Altogether, these results indicate that the difference in viral
susceptibility between ISG15-deficient humans and mice stems
from
the
need
for
ISG15
to
stabilize
USP18,
and
thus
downregulate the IFN-a/b response, in humans but not in mice.
Discussion
IFN-a/b signalling and ISG induction are controlled at multiple
levels by negative regulators, such as SOCS (suppressor of
cytokine signalling), PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT),
protein
phosphatases
(for
example,
SHP1)
and
USP18
(refs 36–38). However, we have shown that these regulators
are not sufficient, and that ISG15 is required for complete
downregulation of IFN-a/b signalling (Fig. 1a). Humans lacking
ISG15 consistently display high steady-state levels of ISGs in
whole blood, and in patient-derived fibroblasts following priming
with IFN-a/b (ref. 10). We hypothesized that this dysregulation

 of IFN-a/b signalling would account for the lack of an overt viral
susceptibility in humans, in contrast to what was observed in
mice. We show here that, unlike the antiviral activity of Isg15
observed in mice, human ISG15 promotes a proviral state
following IFN priming. The persistent ISG expression observed in
human ISG15-deficient cells imparts a resistance to infection with
multiple families of viruses with both RNA and DNA genomes.
These findings contrast from previous reports that have
ascribed an antiviral role to ISG15 in human cells. Shi et al.29
reported that, following silencing of ISG15 for 48 h in HEK-293
cells, SeV titres increased by B0.5 and B1.0 log at 6 h and 12 h
post infection, respectively. Tang et al.23 found that following
ISG15 silencing, A549 cells became Bfivefold more susceptible to
infection by IAV (A/PR/8/1934). While these studies point to an
antiviral role of ISG15 in human cells, our experiments with SeV
and IAV do not capture the small observed difference in viral
growth
when
comparing
WT
and
ISG15-deficient
hTert-
immortalized fibroblasts without IFN priming (Fig. 1). These
studies focused on early timepoints of the acute IFN response
induced by the virus, and did not capture the more powerful role
of ISG15 as a negative regulator of IFN signalling. Even if there
may be a small antiviral role for ISG15 during the acute IFN
response, it is clinically irrelevant in vivo and not readily captured
in vitro.
Interestingly,
we
observed
that
the
conjugation-deficient
ISG15DGG was as efficient as WT ISG15 in rescuing viral
replication in ISG15-deficient patient cells. One could have
predicted an even better rescue of both the ISG expression and

 infection phenotypes by ISG15DGG, since the latter should be
more readily accessible to mediate USP18 stability than the
conjugation-competent form of ISG15. However, this was not the
case, suggesting the possibility that ISG15DGG may have lower
USP18-binding affinity or that only a small amount of ISG15 is
required to stabilize USP18, and the increased availability of
ISG15DGG has no further effect. An additional possibility, albeit
less likely given the depth of work demonstrating the antiviral
role of ISGylation, is that ISG15 in the conjugated form may also
exhibit some proviral properties.
We have shown that free ISG15 associates with higher affinity
to USP18 in humans as compared with mice, although the
species-specific structural determinants involved in complex
formation have yet to be identified. Another species-restricted
complex involving free ISG15 has been described. The NS1
protein of influenza B virus binds non-covalently to human and
non-human primate ISG15, but not to murine Isg15 (refs 39–41).
Mutational and structural studies of the NS1:ISG15 complex have
shown that the molecular determinant of the binding specificity
(humans versus mice) lies in the small hinge region of ISG15
(refs 42,43). Further work is required to identify the domain(s)
responsible for the human ISG15:USP18 interactions that are
required to enhance stability and properly regulate the IFN
responses.
Unlike
humans,
mice
can
downregulate
IFN
signalling
regardless of ISG15 competency and it is currently unknown
whether
murine
Usp18
is
stabilized
by
another
protein,
IFN-stimulated or otherwise. Individuals lacking ISG15 exhibit
elevated ISG
expression,
which may
confer
an
enhanced
protection against viral infection, but do not exhibit any of the
side-effects associated with IFN treatment10. As such, the
USP18:ISG15 interaction is a potentially attractive target for
small molecule-based short-term treatments to boost endogenous
IFN activity.
Our findings raise interesting questions about the evolutionary
role of ISG15. Given the detrimental effects that inflammation
may cause in species with a longer lifespan, gain-of-function
binding mutations in ISG15 and/or USP18 may reflect an
evolutionary necessity in humans, and likely other mammals, to
more stringent tuning of the IFN system. On the other hand,
viruses have developed immune evasion strategies in parallel.
Indeed, many human viral pathogens were shown to oppose
ISGylation (influenza B virus NS139 and vaccinia virus E3L16,44
proteins) or induce de-ISGylation (numerous viral L proteins
containing ovarian tumour45 or papain-like protease46). Much of
the work characterizing these viral proteins has focused on the
inhibition/removal of conjugated ISG15 from viral and host
targets. However, in light of our data demonstrating that the
primary role of human ISG15 is to stabilize USP18 and
downregulate the IFN response, it may be that inhibition of
ISGylation and removal of conjugated ISG15 is a novel mode of
IFN antagonism. By enhancing the pool of free ISG15, these viral
proteins may enhance USP18 levels, dampen IFN signalling and
promote viral escape.
Based on current knowledge, murine Isg15 acts in an antiviral
manner (largely via ISGylation), while murine Usp18 functions in
a proviral manner (IFN negative regulation and de-ISGylation).
By contrast, human ISG15 and USP18 both appear to function in
an anti-inflammatory manner. Consequently, this makes them
proviral, although the ISGylation of cellular or viral proteins may
play a non-dominant antiviral role. However, if both ISGylation
and de-ISGylation are proviral (through provision of the free
ISG15 required for USP18 stabilization), this notion becomes
somewhat paradoxical. In humans then, this process may serve as
a mechanism for the temporal regulation of IFN-a/b-induced
signalling. We suggest that one of the roles of ISGylation at
early stages of viral infection in humans is to sequester free
ISG15, thereby allowing IFN signalling to occur. At later stages,
USP18-mediated de-ISGylation releases free ISG15, which in
turn stabilizes USP18 and tunes down IFN-a/b signalling and
inflammation.
Methods
Cells. Icahn School of Medicine IRB board has approved the use of human subject
cell lines. Dermal fibroblasts from ISG15-deficient patients (n ¼ 3) and WT
controls (n ¼ 5) were immortalized by stable transduction with hTert10. Patient
(n ¼ 3) and control (n ¼ 2) cells were stably complemented with ISG15, ISG15DGG
or luciferase by lentiviral transduction10. Transduced fibroblasts were sorted on the
basis of RFP expression (BD FACS Aria II). The stable expression of the transduced
constructs was periodically checked by western blotting. Murine embryonic
fibroblasts from WT C57BL6/J and Isg15-deficient mice were derived by
disaggregation of day 13.5 embryos from timed matings by trituration of the
embryos at 37 �C in trypsin19. Mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMM) were
generated by isolating bone marrow cells capable of adhering to non-tissue-culture
treated plates for 7 days in BMM media (Dulbeco’s Modified Eagle Medium, 10%
fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 2% supernatant derived from CMG14-12 cells)47.
LL171 cells (clonal isolate of murine L929 fibroblasts; from G. Uze
´, CNRS,
Montpellier, France), HEK293T (CRL-11268; ATCC), Vero-E6 (CRL-1586;
ATCC), Vero (CCL81; ATCC), HeLa (CCL-2; ATCC), A549 (CCL-185; ATCC),
murine embryonic fibroblasts and human fibroblasts were cultured in normal
growth medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.
All cells were cultured at 37 �C and 10% CO2. All cells were tested for mycoplasma
contamination using the PlasmoTest kit according to the manufacturer instructions
(Invivogen).
Priming. Untransduced, luciferase-, ISG15-, and ISG15DGG-transduced
fibroblasts (Figs 1–3) were primed by incubation with 0, 10, 100, or 1,000 IU ml � 1
IFN-a2b (Merck IntronA) in normal growth medium for 12 h. The IFN-a2b was
then eliminated by thorough washing with PBS and the cells were allowed to rest
for 36 h in normal medium before infection. Murine embryonic fibroblasts were
primed with 1,000 U universal type-I IFN (Fig. 3; PBL IFN) or 500 pM murine
IFN-b (Fig. 4; PBL IFN). Mouse bone marrow macrophages were primed with
250 pM murine IFN-a4 (Fig. 4; Calbiochem). LL171 cells were primed with 10 pM
murine IFN-b (Fig. 4; PBL IFN).
ISG Expression analysis. RNA was extracted from fibroblasts (Qiagen RNeasy) or
whole blood (PAXgene Blood RNA Kit) and reverse-transcribed (ABI High
Capacity Reverse Transcriptase) according to the instructions provided by the
manufacturer. Levels of ISG expression (IFIT1, MX1), relative to the 18S rRNA
housekeeper gene, were analysed by Taqman quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan
Universal Master Mix II w/ UNG, Roche LightCycler 480 II). The relative
expression levels of the ISGs were calculated by the DDCT method, with
comparison with the mean value for mock-treated controls.
Viral infections. All infections were performed 48 h after IFN treatment (12 h
priming, 36 h rest) in normal growth medium. The viruses and multiplicities of
infection used were as follows: VSV Indiana strain at an MOI of 1.0, rVSV–GFP
Indiana strain48 at an MOI of 10.0, rHSV-1 US11-GFP Patton strain49 at an MOI
of 1.0 (kindly provided by the laboratory of Ian Mohr), rHCMV IE2-YFP strain
AD169 (ref. 50) at an MOI of 2.0, rIAV A/PR/8/34 gLuc virus51 modified by the
introduction of a PTV1 2A cleavage site (PR8-gLuc-PTV1; kindly provided by
Nick Heaton) at an MOI of 10.0, rSeV-eGFP Fushimi strain52 modified by the
introduction of a gLuc-P2A cleavage site (rSeV-gLuc-P2A-eGFP; same method as
for NiV below) at an MOI of 0.1, RVFV strain ZH501 at an MOI of 0.01, and the
rNiV-gLuc-P2A-eGFP Malaysian strain52 at an MOI of 0.01. All work with
infectious RVFV and rNiV was carried out under biosafety level 4 (BSL-4)
conditions at the Robert E. Shope BSL-4 laboratory at the University of Texas
Medical Branch.
Analysis of viral replication. VSV-infected supernatants were removed 24 h.p.i.
and titered by determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose on Vero-E6 cells.
RVFV and rNiV-gLuc-P2A-eGFP-infected supernatants were collected at 48 and
24 h.p.i., respectively, and titered by plaque assays on Vero-CCL81 cells. Fibroblasts
infected with rVSV–GFP or rHSV-1-US11-GFP were fixed in 4% PFA 24 h.p.i. and
stained with 5 mg ml � 1 Hoechst 33342 in PBS. Cells were imaged and the results
were analysed (BioTek Cytation 3; Gen5 software). HCMV-IE2-YFP-infected
cells were fixed with 4% PFA 24 h.p.i., and imaging analysis was performed on an
Acumen Explorer plate cytometer. Fibroblasts infected with IAV PR8-gLuc-PTV1
were collected and washed with PBS at 24 h.p.i. The cells were lysed and
assayed for luciferase activity, according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega Renilla Luciferase Assay System; BioTek Cytation 3). We collected
rSeV-gLuc-P2A-eGFP-infected supernatants were collected at 24 h.p.i. Supernatant
samples were inactivated with lysis buffer, and assayed for luciferase activity

siRNA-mediated silencing. Murine LL171 cells were silenced by incubation for
24 h with 25 nM Isg15 siRNA (50-CACAGUGAUGCUAGUGGUACA-30; Sigma)
followed by priming with IFN. HeLa and A549 cells were silenced by incubation for
