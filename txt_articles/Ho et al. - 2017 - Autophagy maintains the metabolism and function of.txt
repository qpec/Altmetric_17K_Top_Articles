Abstract
With age, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lose their ability to regenerate the blood system, and 
promote disease development. Autophagy is associated with health and longevity, and is critical 
for protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. Here, we show that loss of autophagy in HSCs causes 
accumulation of mitochondria and an activated metabolic state, which drives accelerated myeloid 
differentiation mainly through epigenetic deregulations, and impairs HSC self-renewal activity and 
regenerative potential. Strikingly, the majority of HSCs in aged mice share these altered metabolic 
and functional features. However, ~ 1/3 of aged HSCs exhibit high autophagy levels and maintain 
a low metabolic state with robust long-term regeneration potential similar to healthy young HSCs. 
Our results demonstrate that autophagy actively suppresses HSC metabolism by clearing active, 
healthy mitochondria to maintain quiescence and stemness, and becomes increasingly necessary 
with age to preserve the regenerative capacity of old HSCs.
Aging is the greatest risk factor for many pathological conditions including cancers, 
neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes1. Physiological aging is a 
complex and multifactorial process that is regulated by both genetic and environmental 
factors2. Although tissues across the body are seemingly affected in different ways, one 
emerging hallmark of aging is that reduction in tissue function usually correlates with a 
reduction in stem cell activity3. The blood system is critical for many aspects of organismal 
health, and proper maintenance of blood production relies on the ability of HSCs to self-
renew and differentiate into all lineages of mature blood cells4. In adults, HSCs are rare and

 reside in specialized niches in the bone marrow (BM) cavity, where they are kept in a low 
metabolic, mainly glycolytic quiescent state unless called upon to regenerate the blood 
system5. With age, HSCs lose their regenerative abilities, but their overall expansion 
maintains blood production in old organisms, albeit with typical features of blood aging like 
anemia, immunosenescence, increased production of myeloid cells and higher predisposition 
to hematological cancers6. Yet, how old HSCs (oHSC) retain some functional abilities in an 
adverse aging BM microenvironment7,8 remains largely unknown.
Macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) is an essential proteostasis and stress response 
mechanism that maintains cellular health by regulating the quantity and quality of organelles 
and macromolecules through lysosomal degradation, and is activated in response to nutrient 
deprivation and other stressors to generate energy and allow survival9. Autophagy is 
controlled by a series of autophagy related genes (Atg) like the ATG12 conjugation system 
(Atg12-Atg5-Atg16), which are essential for the formation of double-membrane 
autophagosomes. Autophagy is regulated by important nutrient sensing pathways including 
the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK), which inhibits and activates autophagy, respectively. Autophagy is critical for the 
proper development of the blood system10,11, for HSC mobilization12, and to allow adult 
HSCs to survive acute metabolic stress13. Autophagy declines with age in many tissues14, 
and reduced autophagy levels in muscle stem cells directly contribute to decreased 
regenerative potential and muscle atrophy15. In contrast, we previously found increased 
basal autophagy in oHSCs13. Here, we set out to identify how autophagy controls HSC 
function, and how changes in autophagy levels affect HSC aging.
Accelerated aging phenotypes upon loss of autophagy in HSCs
To inactivate autophagy in adult HSCs, we used our previously described 
Atg12flox/flox:Mx1-Cre conditional knockout (Atg12cKO) mouse model13, and deleted Atg12 
with poly(I:C) (pIC) at 4 weeks of age (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, the blood system of Atg12cKO 
mice remained largely healthy, with no persisting anemia or lymphopenia observed over 
time as reported in other contexts10,11,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Similar to autophagy 
inactivation in fetal HSCs11, Atg12cKO mice showed increased cellularity in the peripheral 
blood (PB) and spleen, leading to a skewed ratio of circulating myeloid vs. lymphoid cells 
resembling the myeloid-bias observed in old mice (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1b–f). In 
contrast, Atg12cKO mice maintained normal numbers of phenotypic HSCs (Lin−/c-Kit+/
Sca-1+/Flk2−/CD48−/CD150+) over time, with expanded multipotent progenitor (MPP) and 
granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) compartments contributing to the myeloid 
expansion observed in Atg12cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 1g–k). These phenotypes were 
conserved in a distinct Atg5flox/flox:Mx1-Cre conditional knockout (Atg5cKO) model 
(Extended Data Fig. 2a–e), and demonstrated features of premature blood aging in adult 
autophagy-deficient mice.
To investigate the regenerative capacity of Atg12cKO HSCs, we first performed classical 
transplantation experiments with purified HSCs to directly measure their self-renewal and 
multilineage reconstitution activity (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Transplantation of 250 
Atg12cKO HSCs into lethally irradiated recipients led to significantly impaired engraftment,

 with reduced overall chimerism, myeloid-biased lineage distribution, and decreased numbers 
of regenerated HSCs (Fig. 1c). These features were further exacerbated upon secondary 
transplantation of 500 re-isolated Atg12cKO HSCs, and directly demonstrated defective self-
renewal activity in autophagy-deficient HSCs that closely resembles the functional 
impairment of oHSCs (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To address whether the need for autophagy 
changed with age, we next transplanted 2×106 BM cells from non-pIC treated animals into 
lethally irradiated mice, induced Atg12 deletion 2 months after transplantation, and followed 
the recipients for up to 16 months post-pIC treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Of note, 
Atg12cKO mice could not be aged past 8 months post-pIC due to hepatomegaly from off-
target deletion in the liver. Importantly, hematopoietic-specific deletion of Atg12 in 
transplanted mice led to a progressive age-related decline in donor-chimerism and myeloid-
biased lineage distribution (Fig. 1d), thus confirming the cell-intrinsic nature of these 
defects. These aging features were further exacerbated upon deletion of autophagy in mice 
transplanted with BM cells from 24 month-old animals (Extended Data Fig. 2i). 
Collectively, these results indicate striking similarities between autophagy-deficient HSCs 
and oHSCs with defective self-renewal activity and myeloid-biased differentiation potential, 
and demonstrate that autophagy is most critical for HSC function during aging and in 
conditions of intense regenerative stress like transplantation.
Autophagy regulates HSC metabolism
We next investigated how loss of autophagy impacts HSC function. Electron microscopy 
(EM) analyses revealed increased numbers of total and elongated, fused mitochondria in 
Atg12cKO HSCs, which was directly confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining for the 
mitochondria protein TOM20 and flow cytometry (FC) measurements of mitochondria mass 
with Mitotracker Green (MTG) (Fig. 2a–c, and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Atg12cKO HSCs 
also had expanded endoplasmic reticulum and golgi compartments, and increased numbers 
of small vesicles and lysosomes, confirmed by IF staining and FC dye measurements 
(Extended Data Fig. 3b–e). These cellular features, together with elevated levels of p62 
(Extended Data Fig. 3f) confirmed the loss of bulk autophagy in Atg12cKO HSCs, and 
suggest activation of alternative mechanisms of cellular recycling17 to allow HSC 
maintenance at steady state. Autophagy is known to degrade mitochondria through several 
pathways including the PINK1/PARK2 stress mitophagy pathway18, which specifically 
clears damaged mitochondria. HSCs from Park2−/− mice19 showed decreased levels of 
MTG, mitochondrial membrane potential dye tetramethylrhodamine-ethyl-ester (TMRE) 
and TMRE/MTG ratio, likely reflecting damaged mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 3g). In 
contrast, Atg12cKO HSCs had increased TMRE levels and TMRE/MTG ratio, indicating 
more active mitochondria (Fig. 2d, e). Further characterization of Park2−/− mice also 
revealed no similarities to the phenotypes of Atg12cKO mice, and normal function of 
Park2−/− HSCs in transplantation experiments (Extended Data Fig. 3h–n). These results 
indicate that autophagy is most important for the clearance of healthy, active mitochondria in 
HSCs, as opposed to stress-induced specific removal of damaged mitochondria via 
mitophagy as recently studied20,21.
To understand the link between autophagy regulation and mitochondrial activity, we next 
grew wild type HSCs or HSCs isolated from autophagy-reporter Gfp-Lc3 mice22 in

 cytokine-rich (+cyt) conditions to force them out of quiescence and investigate their 
activated state before their first cell division (Fig. 2f). As expected, mTOR was rapidly 
activated in +cyt conditions, whereas it remained inactive in cytokine-starved (−cyt) 
conditions, while AMPK was transiently induced (Fig. 2g, h, and Extended Data Fig. 4a). 
This was accompanied by a rapid reduction of GFP-LC3 levels reflecting autophagy 
activation in –cyt conditions, and increased GFP-LC3 and p62 levels indicating autophagy 
inhibition in +cyt conditions (Fig. 2i, Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). Furthermore, 
pharmacological mTOR inhibition or AMPK activation directly induced autophagy in Gfp-
Lc3 HSCs grown in +cyt conditions, while AMPK inhibition reduced autophagy induction 
grown in –cyt conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d). In +cyt conditions, we also found a 
steady increase in mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, reflecting mitochondrial 
activation, and cell size, NADH levels and glucose uptake suggesting increased metabolic 
activity (Fig. 2j). Seahorse metabolic flux analyses measuring oxygen consumption rates 
(OCR) confirmed dramatically increased OXPHOS levels in activated HSCs (aHSC) grown 
for 21hr in +cyt conditions compared to freshly isolated, quiescent HSCs (qHSC) (Fig 3a). 
Collectively, these results demonstrate that quiescent HSCs switch from a normally low 
OXPHOS state to a high mitochondria-driven OXPHOS state during activation.
Strikingly, Atg12cKO HSCs also exhibited these features of an activated HSC state, with 
increased cell size, NADH, ATP, and glucose uptake (Fig. 3b, c, Extended Fig. 4e). 
Furthermore, freshly isolated HSC-enriched Atg12cKO LSK cells (Lin−/c-Kit+/Sca-1+) 
displayed increased OXPHOS levels, specifically maximum capacity, with unchanged 
glycolysis levels measured by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Fig. 3d, Extended 
Data Fig. 4f). Similar to Atg12cKO LSKs, oHSCs also exhibited increased cell size, NADH 
and ATP levels, and elevated OXPHOS with decreased glycolysis (Fig. 3c, e, Extended Data 
Fig. 4e, g), suggesting an overactive oxidative metabolism. However, in contrast to 
Atg12cKO HSCs, oHSCs had decreased TMRE levels and TMRE/MTG ratios (Extended 
Data Fig. 4h), which could indicate the presence of some damaged mitochondria23. 
Collectively, these results demonstrate that HSC activation is directly associated with 
metabolic activation and increased mitochondrial OXPHOS, and that in the absence of 
autophagy, HSCs are kept in an activated state reminiscent of the alert state recently 
described for muscle stem cells24. They also show that oHSCs, like autophagy-deficient 
HSCs, are metabolically more active than young HSCs (yHSC).
Autophagy controls HSC quiescence and myeloid differentiation
We then explored the consequences of increased oxidative metabolism for Atg12cKO HSC 
fate decisions. Similar to aHSCs, Atg12cKO HSCs showed increased levels of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), which did not cause DNA damage or apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 
4i–k, 5a). As expected for more metabolically activated cells, Atg12cKO HSCs also had 
elevated protein synthesis rates and increased cell cycle activity (Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). 
In contrast, oHSCs showed reduced ROS levels and decreased protein synthesis rates, which 
contrasted with their OXPHOS-activated status, but is likely influenced by their replication 
stress features25 (Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). However, both Atg12cKO HSCs and oHSCs25 
displayed a similar loss of quiescence and pro-myeloid differentiation associated with 
increased unipotent mature colonies and decreased multipotent immature colonies formed in

 methylcellulose (Fig. 4a, b). Strikingly yHSCs treated with the autophagy inhibitor 
Bafilomycin A (BafA) and untreated oHSCs showed a matching reduction in multipotent 
colonies, which was greatly exacerbated in BafA-treated oHSCs (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, 
treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is known to ameliorate many 
ROS-mediated phenotypes26, did not rescue the precocious myeloid differentiation of 
Atg12cKO HSCs in methylcellulose, nor limit the myeloid expansion in Atg12cKO mice 
treated in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 5f–i). These data demonstrate that the non-cytotoxic 
increase in ROS levels observed in metabolically activated Atg12cKO HSCs has no major 
role in driving precocious myeloid differentiation in autophagy-deficient HSCs, in contrast 
to what has been shown in myeloid progenitors27. Altogether, these results indicate that the 
overactive metabolic state caused by loss of autophagy results in loss of quiescence and 
accelerated myeloid differentiation, which closely mirrors the deregulations observed in 
oHSCs.
Loss of autophagy perturbs HSC epigenetic poising
To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms affected by the loss of autophagy, we 
performed gene expression microarray analyses on HSCs and GMPs. While significant 
transcriptional differences were observed in Atg12cKO HSCs using a p-value < 0.01, 
surprisingly, apart from Atg12, no individual genes were significantly differentially 
expressed using a false discovery rate of 0.05 (Supplementary Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 
6a, b). However, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) revealed reduced expression of HSC-
identity genes28 and increased expression of both myeloid genes28 and genes elevated in 
oHSCs25 (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Complementary Fluidigm qRT-PCR analyses confirmed 
limited transcriptional changes in Atg12cKO HSCs, but also identified a small set of 
significantly downregulated genes that render them more similar to downstream MPPs (Fig. 
4d, Supplementary Table 2 and 3). DAVID analyses also showed changes in mitochondrial 
and other metabolic terms in Atg12cKO GMPs, confirming more significant gene expression 
alterations in progenitor cells (Extended Data Fig. 6d, Supplementary Table 1). Since 
metabolism has become increasingly linked to epigenetic regulation26, we also performed 
enhanced reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) analyses of DNA 
methylation. Strikingly, Atg12cKO HSCs showed a significantly altered DNA methylation 
profile, with 162 hypermethylated and 783 hypomethylated differentially methylated regions 
(DMR) (Fig. 4e). DAVID analyses identified phosphoproteins as the most enriched class of 
genes in hypomethylated DMRs (Supplementary Table 4). Taken together, these results are 
consistent with the idea that changes in fate decisions observed at steady state in autophagy-
deficient HSCs are the consequence of an epigenetic reprograming that begins to alter gene 
expression in HSCs, with amplification of transcriptional changes in downstream 
progenitors.
Metabolic activation directly leads to epigenetic remodeling and changes 
HSC fate
To gain a better understanding of the link between metabolic activation, epigenetic 
reprograming and control of HSC fate decisions, we conducted a more extensive analysis of

 21hr +cyt aHSCs vs. freshly isolated qHSCs, and performed both ERBBS analyses and 
Fluidigm qRT-PCR analyses. Strikingly, we also observed an altered DNA methylation 
profile, which was more restricted than in Atg12cKO HSCs, but also mainly consisted of 
hypomethylation events with 38 hypomethylated and 17 hyermethylated DMRs (Fig. 4f). 
Gene ontology (GO) analyses indicated enrichment for Stat3 regulation (Supplementary 
Table 5). Moreover, we found a clear overlap between the changes in gene expression in 
aHSCs and Atg12cKO HSCs suggesting activation of similar mechanisms of fate decision 
(Fig. 4d, Supplementary Table 2). To directly test the importance of metabolic-driven 
epigenetic remodeling in aHSCs, we added α-ketoglutarate (αKG), a necessary co-factor for 
many demethylases29, s-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a methyl donor cosubstrate for 
methylases30, and metformin (Mtf), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I31, to 
differentiating HSCs grown in +cyt conditions for 3 days, and analyzed lineage 
commitment. Strikingly, addition of αKG enhanced myeloid differentiation, while addition 
of SAM or Mtf preserved stemness in +cyt HSCs (Fig. 4g). These results indicate that even 
in the context of strong differentiation stimuli, the epigenetic remodeling associated with 
metabolic activation directly affects HSC fate decisions. Finally, we measured SAM and 
αKG cellular levels (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). While only trending in Atg12cKO HSCs, we 
observed a strong reduction in SAM levels in aHSCs, and found a large increase in αKG 
levels in both Atg12cKO and 21hr +cyt c-Kit-enriched BM cells. These results suggest that 
epigenetic remodeling and DNA demethylation are early consequences of increased 
oxidative metabolism, and play a direct role in HSC loss of stemness and accelerated 
myeloid differentiation. Collectively, they demonstrate an essential role for autophagy in 
clearing metabolically activated mitochondria and allowing HSCs to maintain a mostly 
glycolytic, quiescent state.
Autophagy levels define distinct subsets of old HSCs
While oHSCs share many deregulated features with Atg12cKO HSCs, we previously 
reported increased basal autophagy in oHSCs13. To address this discrepancy and to 
determine its significance, we profiled GFP-LC3 expression in various hematopoietic 
populations of young and old Gfp-Lc3 mice as a surrogate of autophagy levels. In 
unfractionated BM cells, mature B and T cells, and most of the progenitor populations 
including GMPs and MPP4, GFP-LC3 levels were increased with age indicating an overall 
decrease in autophagy activity, as already reported for T cells32 (Fig. 5a, b). Interestingly, 
this corresponded to populations that were either unchanged or decreased in number in old 
mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In contrast, expanded myeloid cells did not have altered GFP-
LC3 levels, and the enlarged MPP2/3 and HSC compartments both contained subsets with 
decreased GFP-LC3 expression. While the average GFP-LC3 expression and overall mTOR 
activity did not significantly change between young and old HSCs (Extended Data Fig. 7b), 
careful examination of oHSCs revealed an increase in cells with both lower and higher GFP-
LC3 levels reflecting the appearance of subsets with either high autophagy (AThi) or low 
autophagy (ATlo), respectively (Fig. 5c). Re-analysis of EM pictures13 (Fig. 5d) and 
measurement of autophagy with Cyto-ID dye (Extended Data Fig. 7c, d) also indicated that 
~ 1/3 of oHSCs had autophagosomes and activated autophagy. Thus, while most of the

 blood cells including the majority of the HSC compartment show no activation or a decline 
in autophagy with age, a fraction of oHSCs have increased autophagy levels.
To study the differences between AThi and ATlo oHSCs, we isolated cells with the 33% 
lowest and 33% highest GFP-LC3 levels, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 7e). This sub-
fractionation revealed no changes in nuclear FoxO3a, but uncovered decreased mTOR 
activity specifically in AThi oHSCs (Fig. 6a, Extended Data Fig. 7f), thus identifying the 
cause for autophagy induction in this subset. By EM analyses, oHSCs with autophagosomes 
displayed normal youthful organelle biology, while oHSCs without autophagosomes showed 
almost identical features to Atg12cKO HSCs, with expanded ER, Golgi and small vesicle 
compartments, and increased numbers of total and elongated mitochondria, that was 
confirmed by TOM20 IF staining in ATlo oHSCs (Fig. 6b, Extended Fig. 7g, h). ATlo oHSCs 
also had increased cell size and elevated TMRE, NADH, ATP, glucose uptake, and ROS 
levels (Fig. 6c–f, Extended Data Fig. 7i–k), remarkably similar to the overactive metabolic 
features of Atg12cKO HSCs. This resulted in increased cell cycling, over-proliferation in 
self-renewal conditions, and pro-myeloid differentiation specifically in ATlo oHSCs (Fig. 6g, 
Extended Data Fig. 7l, m). Strikingly, nucleolar γH2AX foci that are hallmarks of 
replication stress in oHSCs25 were almost exclusively found in ATlo oHSCs (Fig. 6h). In 
contrast, AThi oHSCs closely resembled healthy yHSCs for all of these characteristics. 
Taken together, these results indicate that by preventing entry into an activated state, 
autophagy preserves a subset of oHSCs from replication stress and associated cellular aging. 
This is actually very different from the functions of autophagy in muscle stem cell 
activation33 and prevention of senescence15.
Autophagy activation maintains healthier old HSCs
We next probed the functionality of these subsets and transplanted 250 ATlo or AThi oHSCs 
into lethally irradiated recipients (Extended Data Fig. 8a). While both subsets initially 
engrafted at similar levels, ATlo oHSCs rapidly declined and were unable to maintain 
efficient long-term reconstitution and HSC numbers (Fig. 6i). In contrast, AThi oHSCs 
exhibited a surprisingly robust long-term reconstitution and HSC regeneration. These 
functional differences persisted with a more restrictive 15% GFP-LC3 AThi/lo oHSC cutoff 
and upon secondary transplantation, although they became attenuated, perhaps due to 
normalization of autophagy levels in re-isolated oHSC subsets, potentially as a consequence 
of repeated exposure to a young BM microenvironment (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). They 
were also specific to oHSCs, as ATlo and AThi yHSCs isolated with the same 33% GFP-LC3 
cutoffs had no differences in regenerative abilities (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Collectively, 
these results demonstrate that ATlo and AThi oHSCs are functionally distinct subsets, with 
autophagy-activated oHSCs being the fittest aged stem cells responsible for the majority of 
the repopulation potential, and autophagy-inactivated oHSCs driving most of the blood 
aging phenotypes.
We also investigated the reversibility between ATlo and AThi oHSC subsets. Strikingly, there 
were no discernible differences in CD150 expression between these two subsets, and oHSCs 
were almost identical to yHSCs for both mTOR activation in +cyt conditions and 
pharmacological modulation of autophagy levels (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). In fact, ATlo

 and AThi oHSCs, despite initial differences in GFP-LC3 levels, were able to repress and 
activate autophagy to similar extents in ±cyt conditions, and upon glutamine starvation 
(Extended Data Fig. 9d–g). Furthermore, both ATlo and AThi oHSCs had equivalent 
autophagy flux, which was comparable to yHSCs (Extended Data Fig. 9f). These results 
demonstrate that while subsets of oHSCs with different mTOR and autophagy levels exist in 
vivo, they both maintain the ability to upregulate and downregulate autophagy upon strong 
stimulation.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate an essential function for autophagy in removing activated 
mitochondria and controlling oxidative metabolism, thereby maintaining HSC stemness and 
regenerative potential (Extended Data Fig. 10). They link metabolic reprogramming with 
epigenetic modifications in the control of HSC fate, and establish autophagy as one of the 
essential gatekeepers of HSC quiescence. This role becomes even more important during 
aging as the inability of the majority of oHSCs to activate autophagy in vivo results in an 
overactive OXPHOS metabolism that drives most of the aging blood phenotypes, including 
impaired engraftment and replication stress. While all oHSCs remain competent for 
autophagy induction, only ~ 1/3 of them activate autophagy in the aging BM 
microenvironment7,8, and maintain a low metabolic state with robust regeneration potential 
akin to yHSCs. Our findings have exciting implications for rejuvenation therapies as they 
identify a cellular characteristic that can be directly targeted to improve oHSC function and 
preserve the health of an aging blood system. In this context, understanding why some old 
stem cells activate autophagy and others do not, as well as identifying the environmental 
drivers for this differential adaptive response will help further our understanding of cellular 
aging, and develop more targeted approaches for improving organismal health during aging.
Online Methods
Mice
Young (6–12 weeks) and old (24–28 months) wild type C57Bl/6 mice of both genders were 
either bred and aged in house, or obtained from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) aged 
rodent colonies. Mx1-Cre34, Atg12flox/flox:Mx1-Cre [13], Atg5flox/flox [35], Park2−/− [19] 
and Gfp-Lc3 [22] and were all on a pure C57Bl/6 background and have been described 
previously. Atg5flox/flox:Mx1-Cre mice were generated by crossing Atg5flox/flox with Mx1-
Cre mice. Old (24–31 months) Gfp-Lc3 mice were aged in house. For Mx1-Cre-mediated 
deletion, 4-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) three times 2 days apart with 
125 μg poly(I/C) (pIC, GE Healthcare) in 100 μl PBS. pIC-injected Atg12flox/flox or 
Atg5flox/flox mice were used as controls (Cnt). pIC-injected Atg12flox/flox:Mx1-Cre and 
Atg5flox/flox:Mx1-Cre conditional knock-out (cKO) mice were used 2–3 months post-pIC 
injection, unless otherwise indicated. For deletion in transplanted mice, recipients were 
injected 2 months after transplantation with pIC as described above. For mouse studies, no 
specific randomization or blinding protocol was used, animals of both genders were utilized, 
and all experiments were performed in accordance with UCSF IACUC approved protocols.

 In vivo assays
For 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; Sigma-Aldrich) treatment, mice were injected i.p. with 150 mg/kg 
5-FU or vehicle (PBS) for four times once a month and analysed for blood parameters by 
regular bleeding every 3–5 days. For in vivo starvation experiments, mice were deprived of 
food for 24hr with free access to water. For transplantations experiments, 8–12 week old 
CD45.1 C57Bl/6-Boy/J recipient mice were lethally irradiated (11Gy, delivered in split 
doses 3hr apart) using a Cs137 source (J.L. Shepherd), and injected retro-orbitally with either 
250–1000 purified CD45.2 HSCs delivered together with 250,000 Sca-1-depleted helper 
CD45.1 BM cells, or just with 2×106 unfractionated CD45.2 BM cells. Transplanted mice 
were kept on antibiotic-containing water for 4 weeks, and analyzed for donor-derived 
chimerism by monthly bleeding. Peripheral blood (PB) was obtained via retro-orbital 
bleeding, and collected in 4 ml of ACK (150 mM NH4Cl/10 mM KHCO3) containing 10 
mM EDTA for flow cytometry analyses, or in EDTA-coated tubes (Becton Dickenson) for 
complete blood counts (CBC). CBC analyses were performed using a Hemavet hematology 
system (Drew Scientific). For EdU incorporation, mice were injected with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml 
5-ethynyl-2 deoxyuridine (EdU, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A00144) 3hr before sacrifice. For 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatments, mice were given water containing 1 mg/ml NAC 
(Sigma-Aldrich, A7250-100G) for 8 weeks starting on the day of the final pIC treatment.
Flow cytometry
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were analysed and/or isolated as described36. BM 
cells were obtained by crushing leg, arm and pelvic bones (with eventually sternum and 
spines for some experiments) in Hanks’ Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) containing 2% 
heat-inactivated FBS (staining media, SM), and single cell suspensions of splenocytes by 
mechanical dissociation between two slides of whole spleens. Erythrocytes were removed by 
ACK lysis, and single cell suspensions of BM cells were purified on a Ficoll gradient 
(Histopaque 1119, Sigma-Aldrich). BM cells were then enriched for c-Kit+ cells using c-Kit 
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-224) and an AutoMACS cell separator (Miltenyi 
Biotec) or MACS Separation LS Columns (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-401). For cell 
analyses, unfractionated BM cells were incubated with purified rat anti-mouse lineage 
antibodies (CD3 from BioLegend, and CD4, CD5, CD8, B220, Ter119, Mac-1 and Gr-1 
from eBioscience) followed by goat anti-rat-PE-Cy5 (Invitrogen, A10691) and subsequently 
blocked with purified rat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then stained with c-Kit-APC-
eFluor780 (eBioscience, 47-1171-82), Sca-1-PB (BioLegend, 108120), CD48-A647 
(BioLegend, 103416), CD150-PE (BioLegend, 115904) and Flk2-bio (eBioscience, 
13-1351-82) followed by either SA-PeCy7 (eBioscience, 25-4317-82) or SA-Qdot605 
(Invitrogen, Q10101MP) for HSC staining, or together with CD34-FITC (eBioscience, 
11-0341-85) and FcγR-PerCP-eFluor710 (eBioscience, 46-0161-82) for combined HSC/
myeloid progenitor staining. For Gfp-Lc3 mice analyses and dye staining requiring FITC 
and/or PE channels, HSCs were stained instead with Lin/PE-Cy5, Sca-1-PE-Cy7 
(BioLegend, 108114), CD48-PB (BioLegend, 1103418), CD150-APC (BioLegend, 
1115910), and Flk2-Bio followed by SA-PeCy7. For myeloid progenitor analyses in Gfp-
Lc3 mice, cells were separately stained with Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-APC-eFluor780, Sca-1-PB, 
FcγR-PerCP-eFluor710 and CD34-Bio (Biolegend, 119304) followed by SA-Qdot605. For 
HSC chimerism analyses, HSCs were stained with Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-APC-eFluor780,

 Sca-1-PB, CD48-A647, CD150-PE, and Flk2-bio followed by SA-Qdot605, together with 
CD45.2-FITC (eBioscience, 11-0454-85) and CD45.1-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, 25-0453-82). 
For mature cell analyses, unfractionated BM cells were stained with Mac-1-PE-Cy7 
(eBioscience, 25-0112-82), Gr-1-PB (eBioscience, 57-5931-82), B220-APC-Cy7 
(eBioscience, 47-0452-82), CD19-PE (eBioscience, 12-0193-82), CD4-FITC (BD 
Biosciences, 553729) and CD8-PE (Biolegend, 100908). For PB chimerism analyses, cells 
were stained with Mac-1-PE-Cy7, Gr-1-PB, B220-APC-Cy7, CD3-APC (eBioscience, 
17-0032-82) and Ter-119-PE-Cy5 (eBioscience, 15-5921-83) together with either CD45.2-
FITC or CD45.2-Bio follows by SA-Qdot605 and CD45.1-PE (eBioscience, 12-0453). 
Stained cells were re-suspended in SM with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) to exclude dead 
cells. Sorted or gated HSCs were analysed for cell size and NADH autofluorescence using 
forward scatter (FSC) and UV450/50 channels, respectively. For ROS, mitochondrial mass 
and ER analyses, sorted HSCs were washed with HBSS, incubated for 15 min at 37°C with 
dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA, 10 μM, Invitrogen, C400), Mitosox Red (MTR, 5uM, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, M36008), Mitotracker Green (MTG, 100 nM, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, M7514), or ER-Tracker Green (100 nM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, E34251) in 
HBSS. For mitochondrial membrane potential or autophagy analyses, sorted HSCs were 
incubated for 15 min at 37°C with tetramethylrhodamine-ethyl-ester (TMRE, 200 nM, Enzo, 
enz-52309) or Cyto-ID (1:1000, Enzo, ENZ-51031-0050) in SM. HSCs were then washed 
with SM, re-suspended in SM containing 1 μg/ml PI, and analyzed for dye fluorescence in 
the FITC or PE channels. For intracellular staining, sorted HSCs were washed in PBS, fixed 
in Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences), washed in PermWash (BD Biosciences), 
permeabilized with CytoPerm Plus (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature (RT), 
re-fixed in Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer for 10 min at 4°C, washed in PermWash and incubated 
in PermWash overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-phospho-
S6 (Cell Signaling, 2211) or anti-phospho-S6 A488 (Cell Signaling, 4854), and guinea pig 
anti-p62 (Progen, GP62-C). Cells were then washed in PermWash and incubated in 
PermWash for 2hr at 4°C with the appropriate secondary antibody: anti-rabbit A488 
(Invitrogen, A21206) or A594 (Invitrogen, A11037) and anti-guinea pig A488 (Invitrogen, 
A11073) or A647 (Abcam, ab150187). Cells were washed once more in PermWash and re-
suspended in PermWash for analyses. For intracellular bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining, 
Cytofix/Cytoperm treated HSCs were incubated for 30 min with 0.5 U/μl DNAseI in 3% 
BSA/0.2x PBS/5mM MgCl2/2mM CaCl2 at RT, washed in PermWash, incubated with 
mouse anti-BrdU primary antibody for 30 min at RT, washed in PermWash, incubated with 
APC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21241) secondary antibody 
for 30 min at RT, washed once more in PermWash and re-suspended for analyses. For 
intracellular Ki67 and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, 32670-5MG-
F) staining, unfractionated BM cells were first stained with Lin/PE-Cy5, c-Kit-APC-
eFluor780, Sca-1-PE-Cy7, CD150-PE and CD48-A647 as described above, and then stained 
with anti-Ki67 (eBioscience, 11-5698-80) in PermWash for 2hr at 4°C. Cells were then 
washed with PermWash, re-suspended in PBS/3% FBS containing 1 μg/ml DAPI, and 
incubated for 20 min prior to analysis. Cell isolation was performed on a FACSAria III 
(Becton Dickenson) using double sorting, and cell analyses were performed using a 
FACSAria or FACS LSR II using DIVA software (Becton Dickenson).

 Cell culture
All cultures were performed at 37°C in a 5% CO2 water jacket incubator (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Cells were grown in StemPro34 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 
penicillin (50 U/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and L-glutamine (2 mM), and with or without 
the following cytokines (±cyt): SCF (25 ng/ml), Flt3L (25 ng/ml), IL-11 (25 ng/ml), IL-3 
(10 ng/ml), GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), Epo (4 U/ml) and Tpo (25 ng/ml) (Peprotech). For self-
renewal cultures, only SCF, IL11, and Flt3L were used. Bafilomycin A (BafA, 5 nM, Sigma, 
B1793-2UG), rapamycin (Rapa, 200 nM, EMD Millipore, CAS 53123-88-9), Ink128 (200 
nM, gift from Dr. D. Ruggero), AICAR (5mM, Sigma, A9978), Compound C (CC, 40 μM, 
EMD Millipore, 171260) or corresponding vehicles (i.e., DMSO or water) were added to the 
±cyt media when indicated. For glutamine starvation experiments, L-glutamine was omitted 
from the +cyt medium. For apoptosis and ATP assays, HSCs (400 cells per well) were sorted 
directly into 40 μl of SM media in 384-well solid white luminescence plates and 40 μl of 
either Caspase-Glo 3/7 (Promega, G8091) or CellTiter-Glo (Promega, G7570) was then 
directly added to each well. Both assays were performed according to manufacturer’s 
instructions and read on a luminometer (Synergy2, BioTek). For colony forming unit (CFU) 
assays, unfractionated BM cells (10,000 cells per 1 ml in 3 cm dish) or sorted HSCs (100 
cells per 1 ml in 3 cm dish, or 1 cell in 100 μl per well of a 96-well plate) were cultured in 
methylcellulose (Stem Cell Technologies, M3231) supplemented with L-Glutamine, 
Penicillin/Streptomycin and the cytokines described above, together with BafA when 
indicated. Three 3 cm dishes or 60–72 individual cells in 96-well plate were scored per 
condition after 8 to 12 days of culture. For measurement of glucose uptake, HSCs (400–
2000 cells) were grown in +cyt media containing 100 μM 2-(n-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-
diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBD glucose, Invitrogen, N13195). Cells were then 
washed once in SM, re-suspended in SM containing 1 μg/ml PI, and analyzed for 2-NBD 
glucose fluorescence in the FITC channel. For measurement of glucose uptake in GFP-LC3 
HSCs, 6000 HSCs were cultured with 100 μM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) for 4hr and then 
processed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Glucose Uptake-Glo Assay, Promega, 
J1341). For BrdU incorporation assays, HSCs (1000–2000 cells) were directly sorted into 
96-well plates, cultured for 3hr with 60 μM BrdU (Sigma, B5002) and analysed by flow 
cytometry as described above. For measurement of nascent protein synthesis, HSCs were 
cultured with 20 μM O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-puro, Thermo Fisher Scientific, C10457) 
for 30 min in +cyt media, processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 
analysed by immunofluorescence staining as described below. For replication stress assays, 
cells were cultured with the same cocktail of cytokines and aphidicolin (50 ng/ml, Sigma, 
A4487) in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s media (IMDM) supplemented with 5% FBS 
(StemCell Technology, 06200), 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino 
acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol.
Immunofluorescence staining
HSCs (400–1500 cells) were sorted directly onto poly-lysine coated slides (VWR 
International, P-4981) and fixed in PBS/4% PFA for 10 min at RT. Slides were 
permeabilized in PBS/0.15% Triton-X100 for 2 min at RT and blocked in PBS/1% BSA for 
1hr at RT. Slides were then incubated in PBS/1% BSA with either rabbit anti-FoxO3a 
(Millipore, 07-1719), mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser139) (Millipore, 05-636), rabbit

 anti-53BP1 (Novus Biologicals, NB100-904), rabbit anti-FBL (Cell Signaling, 2639), mouse 
anti-RAD51 (Abcam, ab1837), mouse anti-LAMP1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma 
Bank, 1D4B), mouse anti-KDEL (Abcam, ab12223) or rabbit anti-TOM20 (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, sc-11415) for 1hr at 37°C. Slides were then washed three times in PBS and 
incubated for 1hr at 37°C in PBS/1% BSA with appropriate secondary antibodies (all from 
Life Technologies): A488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (A-11029), A594-conjugated goat 
anti-rabbit (A-11037), A594- or A488-conjugated goat anti-rat (A-11007, A-10528), and 
A488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (A-21202). Slides were finally washed three times in 
PBS and mounted using VectaShield (Vector Laboratories) containing 1 μg/ml DAPI. EdU 
incorporation was detected using A594-labeled azide click chemistry according to the 
manufacturer’s instruction (Life Technologies, Click-iT® EdU imaging assay, C10339). For 
OP-puro analysis, after processing, slides were stained with anti-phospho-H2AX and then 
A488-conjugated goat anti-mouse. Cells were imaged on a SP5 Leica Upright Confocal 
Microscope (20× or 63× objective), and images were processed using Volocity software (v.
4.4, Improvision, Waltham, MA, USA) and ImageJ. Between 5 to 8 z-stacks were taken per 
image, and total fluorescence per cell was measured using Volocity on ≥ 20 cells per 
condition.
In vitro assays
For Western blot analyses, sorted HSCs (~30,000-cells per condition) were lysed in RIPA 
buffer, run on standard 12% SDS-page gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-
Rad, 162-0232) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in blocking buffer (Li-
COR Biosciences, 927–40000) containing 0.1% Tween (BBT) for 1hr at RT according to 
standard protocols. Membranes were incubated for overnight at 4°C in BBT with primary 
antibodies in BBT, washed once with BBT, incubated for 1hr at 4°C in BBT with 
appropriate secondary antibodies, and detected on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-
COR Biosciences). Membranes were eventually stripped with NewBlot Stripping Buffer 
Nitro (Li-COR Biosciences, 928–40030) according to manufacturer’s instructions before 
being re-incubated with another primary antibody. Rabbit anti-phospho-AMPKα (Cell 
Signalling, 2535), rabbit anti-phospho-S6 (Cell Signalling, 2215), mouse anti-S6 (Cell 
Signalling, 2317), and rabbit anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A2066) were used as primary 
antibodies and IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Li-COR Biosciences, 926-32211) or 
IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Li-COR Biosciences, 926-32210) as secondary 
antibodies. For Seahorse metabolic flux experiments, oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and 
extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were measured using a 96-well Seahorse 
Bioanalyzer XF 96 according to manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Technologies). In 
brief, HSCs or LSK cells (75,000 cells per well) were sorted directly into 96-well plates pre-
coated for 3hr with poly-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, P4707) and containing cyt+ media. Plates 
were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm and media was replaced with 175 μl of 
temperature/CO2 pre-adjusted +cyt media. Plates were either immediately analyzed or 
cultured for 22hr prior analysis done according to manufacturer’s instructions with the 
following exceptions. For glycolysis assays, the starting +cyt media already contained 
glucose and 2 μM Oligoymycin followed by 1 M 2-DG were used. For OXPHOS assays, 1 
μM Oligomycin followed by 2 μM FCCP were used. For both assays, mix and read times 
were also extended to 7 min and 4 min, respectively. For electron microscopy (EM)

 analyses, cells (40,000–75,000 per condition) were pelleted for 5 min at 4°C at 600 g, fixed 
on ice for 30 min in 0.1M NaCacodylate, pH 7.4, containing 2% Glutaraldehyde and 1% 
PFA, and pelleted at 3000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Samples were then submitted to the 
Gladstone Institute (UCSF) Electron Microscopy Core Facility for standard transmission 
electron microscopy ultrastructural analyses. Mitochondria numbers and morphology were 
visually scored. For aKG measurements, 106 c-kit-enriched BM cells were processed 
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Biovision, K677-100). For SAM measurements, 
15,000 HSCs were processed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Mediomics, 
1-1-1004).
Gene expression analyses
For microarray analyses, RNA was purified from sorted HSCs and GMPs (7,000–20,000 
cells obtained from individual mice) using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit, 
amplified using Ovation Pico WTA System V2 (NuGEN, 3302-12), fragmented and 
biotinylated using the Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN, 4200-12), and hybridized on 
Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 microarrays according to manufacturers’ instructions. 
Transcriptome profiling was performed at the Gladstone Institute Genomics Core (UCSF). 
Gene expression was first measured at the probe set level (n = 241,619) using the RMA 
(Robust Multi-array Average) methodology followed by quantile normalization37. Quality of 
the data was assessed using principal component analysis (PCA) as well as unsupervised 
hierarchical clustering. Probe set annotation for the MoGene1.0st v1 array was downloaded 
from Affymetrix’s website and the 241,619 probe sets were mapped to the 28,853 main 
transcript set (excluding controls). This data set was used for all analyses. We used a family 
of generalized, linear models implemented with the R package, LIMMA, to assess 
differential expression between groups of interest38. Nominal p-values were corrected for 
multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05. Gene Set 
Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) were performed according to standard procedures on curated 
gene sets from previous publications. Normalized expression values for each replicate were 
used to generate an expression data set file, and GSEA was run using the weighted 
enrichment score. DAVID was used to functionally annotate the differentially expressed or 
methylated genes to GO terms. For Fluidigm analyses, the Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Array 
IFC were performed as previously described36. Briefly, HSCs or MPPs (100 cells/well) were 
directly sorted into 96 well-plates containing CellsDirect lysis buffer (Invitrogen, 
11753-100), reverse-transcribed and pre-amplified for 18 cycles using Superscript III 
Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, 18080-044) using a custom-made set of 96 
proprietary target-specific primers (Fluidigm). The resulting cDNAs were analyzed on a 
Biomark system (Fluidigm) using EvaGreen Sybr dye (Bio-Rad, 172-5211). Data were 
collected with Biomark Data Collection Software (Fluidigm) and analyzed using Biomark 
qPCR analysis software with a quality threshold of 0.65 and linear baseline correction. Melt 
curves and Tm values for each assay reaction were checked individually, and reactions with 
melt curves showing multiple peaks or poor quality were discarded, leaving 69 genes for 
further analyses. For gene expression quantification, data were exported as an Excel .csv file 
and analyzed by the ΔΔCt method using Actb normalization.

 Methylation analyses
DNA was isolated from sorted HSCs (4,000–24,000 cells obtained from individual mice) 
using the Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, 80204) and used for library preparation. 
Enhanced reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) was performed as 
previously described39, except for gel size selection as only fragments of 150–450 bp were 
excised due to the low input amount of starting DNA. Libraries were sequenced on an 
Illumina HiSeq 2500. Reads were aligned against a bisulfite-converted mouse genome 
(mm10) using Bowtie and Bismark (versions 2.2.6 and 0.14.5, respectively). After filtering 
and normalizing by coverage, differentially methylated cytosines (DMC) were identified 
using MethylKit (version 0.9.4) and R statistical software (version 3.2.1)40. Significant 
differentially methylated regions (DMR) were identified with eDMR (version 0.6.3.1) using 
the following parameters ≥ 2 DMC, ≥ 3 CpG, mean methylation difference ≥ 20, and DMR 
q-value ≥ 0.05. DMRs were annotated to the RefSeq genes as previously described41. 
DAVID was used to functionally annotate the differentially methylated genes to GO terms, 
SP_PIR_KEYWORDS, and KEGG Pathways with an FDR cutoff of 0.1. ChIP-enrich was 
used to functionally annotate the differentially methylated genes to GO terms and KEGG 
Pathways with an FDR cutoff of 0.05. Maximum gene set size was limited to 500, and DMR 
were annotated to the nearest gene
Statistics
All experiments were repeated as indicated. N indicates the numbers of independent 
biological repeats. Numbers of independent experiments are reported in the supplementary 
data. Data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (S.D.), or standard error of the 
mean (S.E.M.) as indicated when a group within an experiment had less than 3 independent 
repeats, and for all line graph visualization of results. Mice for transplantation were 
randomized, samples were alternated whenever possible, and no blinding protocol was used. 
No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. P-values were generated using 
two-tailed student’s t-test, and were considered significant when ≤ 0.05. All experiments 
were repeated as indicated. N indicates the numbers of independent biological repeats which 
are distinct individual or pooled mice, except when indicated otherwise in the figure legends.

 Extended Data Fig. 10. Model for the role of autophagy in HSC function and HSC aging
HSC activation is accompanied by mitochondria activation and a shift in metabolic activity 
from glycolysis to OXPHOS, which provides energy and increases the production of 
mitochondrial metabolites such as α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) that act as substrates/co-factors 
for epigenetic enzymes. Metabolically activated HSCs are poised to undergo lineage priming 
and produce differentiated progeny to regenerate the blood system. However, activated HSCs 
must also return to quiescence to maintain the stem cell pool. In this context, autophagy 
plays an essential role by clearing activate mitochondria to allow OXPHOS-driven HSCs to 
efficiently revert to a mostly glycolysis-based metabolic quiescence. Without autophagy, 
HSCs display an overactive OXPHOS-driven metabolism that promotes myeloid-biased 
differentiation and loss of stemness as a consequence of epigenetic reprogramming. Other 
mechanisms of mitochondria elimination likely allow some autophagy-deficient HSCs to 
return to quiescence during homeostasis, but they do not substitute for autophagy in 
maintaining HSC function in conditions of intense regeneration stress like transplantation. 
This role of autophagy becomes even more important with age as the inability of ~ 2/3 of 
oHSCs to activate autophagy results in an overactive OXPHOS metabolism that impairs self-
renewal, promotes proliferation and myeloid differentiation, and contributes to replication

 stress. These unhealthy oHSCs drive most of the aging blood phenotypes. In contrast, ~ 1/3 
of oHSCs activate autophagy, control their metabolic activity, and are the fittest old stem 
cells that retain functional abilities in an adverse aging BM microenvironment. As all oHSCs 
remain competent for autophagy induction, it will be exciting to test whether rejuvenation 
interventions aimed at activating autophagy in unhealthy autophagy-inactivated oHSCs will 
improve the health of the aging blood system.
