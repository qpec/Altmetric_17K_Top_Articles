Abstract
BACKGROUND—Patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that progresses after platinum-
based chemotherapy have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.
METHODS—In this open-label, international, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 542 patients 
with advanced urothelial cancer that recurred or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy to 
receive pembrolizumab (a highly selective, humanized monoclonal IgG4κ isotype antibody 
against programmed death 1 [PD-1]) at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or the investigator’s 
choice of chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine. The coprimary end points were 
overall survival and progression-free survival, which were assessed among all patients and among 
patients who had a tumor PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) combined positive score (the percentage of PD-
L1–expressing tumor and infiltrating immune cells relative to the total number of tumor cells) of 
10% or more.
RESULTS—The median overall survival in the total population was 10.3 months (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 8.0 to 11.8) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 7.4 months 
(95% CI, 6.1 to 8.3) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.91; 
P=0.002). The median overall survival among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive 
score of 10% or more was 8.0 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 12.3) in the pembrolizumab group, as 
compared with 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 7.4) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio, 0.57; 
95% CI, 0.37 to 0.88; P=0.005). There was no significant between-group difference in the duration 
of progression-free survival in the total population (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 
0.98; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.19; P=0.42) or among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive 
score of 10% or more (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.28; P =0.24). Fewer treatment-related 
adverse events of any grade were reported in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy 
group (60.9% vs. 90.2%); there were also fewer events of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity reported in the 
pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (15.0% vs. 49.4%).
CONCLUSIONS—Pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer overall survival (by 
approximately 3 months) and with a lower rate of treatment-related adverse events than

 chemotherapy as second-line therapy for platinum-refractory advanced urothelial carcinoma. 
(Funded by Merck; KEYNOTE-045 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02256436.)
Urothelial cancer is highly lethal in the metastatic state.1 Platinum-based combination 
chemotherapy remains the standard first-line treatment for metastatic disease. Carboplatin-
based combinations are associated with a median overall survival of 9 months,2 and 
cisplatin-based combinations with a median overall survival of 12 to 15 months.3 However, 
after platinum-based chemotherapy, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. 
Single-agent paclitaxel and docetaxel are commonly used worldwide,4,5 and in Europe, 
vinflunine has been approved on the basis of an overall survival advantage of 2 months over 
best supportive care.6,7 Because the median overall survival with second-line therapy is only 
6 to 7 months, effective options are needed in patients with previously treated advanced 
urothelial carcinoma.
Monoclonal antibodies against programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-
L2) have shown robust antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in many advanced 
malignant conditions,8 including urothelial cancer.9–14 Pembrolizumab, a highly selective, 
humanized monoclonal IgG4κ isotype antibody against PD-1, can disrupt the engagement of 
PD-1 with its ligands and impede inhibitory signals in T cells. Pembrolizumab showed 
antitumor activity in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma in the phase 1b 
KEYNOTE-012 study9 and the phase 2 KEYNOTE-052 study.12 In the international, 
randomized, open-label, phase 3 KEYNOTE-045 trial, we compared pembrolizumab with 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine as second-
line therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that progressed during or after 
the receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy.
METHODS
PATIENTS
Patients who were 18 years of age or older were eligible for enrollment if they had 
histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis, ureter, 
bladder, or urethra that showed predominantly transitional-cell features on histologic testing, 
had progression after platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced disease or recurrence 
within 12 months after the receipt of platinum-based adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for 
localized muscle-invasive disease, had received two or fewer lines of systemic chemotherapy 
for advanced disease previously, had at least one measurable lesion according to the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,15 and had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0, 1, or 2 (on a 5-point 
scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher numbers indicating greater disability). 
Patients who had an ECOG performance-status score of 2 (indicating that the patient is 
ambulatory and capable of all self-care but is unable to carry out any work activities and is 
out of bed more than 50% of waking hours) and had one or more of the established poor 
prognostic factors for second-line therapy (i.e., hemoglobin concentration of <10 g per 
deciliter, presence of liver metastases, and receipt of the last dose of most recent 
chemotherapy <3 months before enrollment)16,17 were excluded from enrollment. Patients 
were ineligible if they had received anti–PD-1, anti–PD-L1, or anti–CTLA-4 therapy

 previously. Full eligibility criteria are listed in the trial protocol, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org.
TRIAL DESIGN AND TREATMENT
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 
mg) or investigator’s choice of paclitaxel (at a dose of 175 mg per square meter of body-
surface area), docetaxel (at a dose of 75 mg per square meter), or vinflunine (at a dose of 
320 mg per square meter), all administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomization was 
stratified according to ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1 vs. 2), presence of liver 
metastases (yes vs. no), hemoglobin concentration (<10 g per deciliter vs. ≥10 g per 
deciliter), and time since the last dose of chemotherapy (<3 months vs. ≥3 months). 
Treatment assignment was not blinded. Treatment was continued until RECIST-defined 
disease progression,15 development of an unacceptable level of toxic effects, withdrawal of 
consent, decision by the investigator to discontinue treatment, or the completion of 2 years 
of pembrolizumab therapy.
Patients with disease progression, according to the investigator’s assessment of radiographic 
results, and a clinically stable status could continue to receive the therapy at the discretion of 
the investigator. Patients in the pembrolizumab group who had a complete response could 
discontinue treatment if they had received pembrolizumab for at least 24 weeks and for at 
least two doses beyond the time of initial complete response. There was no planned 
crossover on disease progression. Full information about guidance regarding the treatment 
decisions is provided in the protocol.
ASSESSMENTS
PD-L1 expression was assessed in formalin-fixed tumor samples at a central laboratory with 
the use of the commercially available PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Dako North 
America). The kits were purchased at full cost. Archival tumor samples and newly obtained 
core or excisional biopsy samples from nonirradiated sites were permitted. There were no 
restrictions on the age of the archival samples or on the number of intervening therapies 
received after the sample was obtained. All samples, regardless of whether they were 
archival or newly obtained, were analyzed by the central laboratory during the screening 
process, and only the patients whose samples could be evaluated for PD-L1 expression were 
permitted to enroll in the study. PD-L1 expression was categorized as the PD-L1 combined 
positive score, defined as the percentage of PD-L1–expressing tumor and infiltrating 
immune cells relative to the total number of tumor cells.12
Tumor imaging was scheduled for week 9, followed by every 6 weeks during the first year 
and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response to treatment was assessed according to RECIST15 
by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. During follow-up for survival, 
patients were contacted every 12 weeks for survival assessment. The full assessment 
schedule is provided in the trial protocol. All the adverse events and abnormalities were 
graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.0.

 END POINTS
At the second interim analysis, the coprimary end points were overall survival and 
progression-free survival, which were assessed in the total population and in the population 
of patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more. Overall 
survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Progression-
free survival was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death 
from any cause.
Secondary efficacy end points, which were assessed in the total population and in the 
population of patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more, 
included the objective response rate, defined as the percentage of patients who had a 
confirmed complete or partial response, and the duration of confirmed response, defined as 
the time from the first documented complete or partial response to disease progression or 
death. Safety in the total population was also a secondary end point. The full list of end 
points is provided in the protocol.
Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients 
who were assigned to a treatment group. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, 
which included all the patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
The trial was designed by academic advisors and employees of the sponsor (Merck). Data 
were collected by investigators and their site personnel and analyzed by statisticians who 
were employees of the sponsor. Results were interpreted by the academic authors, by authors 
who were employees of the sponsor, and by other employees of the sponsor who did not 
fulfill all the authorship criteria as outlined by the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors. An external data and safety monitoring committee oversaw the trial and 
assessed efficacy and safety at the time of prespecified interim analyses that were performed 
by statisticians from QuintilesIMS, with funding by the sponsor.
The trial protocol and all the amendments were approved by the appropriate ethics body at 
each center. The trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol and its amendments, 
with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and with the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. All the patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.
All the authors attest that the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol and all the 
amendments, attest that they had access to the data used for the writing of the manuscript, 
and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses. The first draft of the 
manuscript was written by the first and last authors, with input from authors who were 
employees of the sponsor. Assistance with manuscript preparation was provided by a 
medical writer employed by the sponsor. All the authors participated in reviewing and 
editing the manuscript and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response were estimated with the 
use of the Kaplan–Meier method. In the analysis of overall survival, patients who were alive

 or lost to follow-up had their data censored at the time of last contact. In the analysis of 
progression-free survival, patients who were alive and without disease progression or who 
were lost to follow-up had their data censored at the time of last tumor assessment. Between-
group differences in overall survival and progression-free survival were calculated with the 
use of a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals were 
calculated with the use of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model and Efron’s method 
of handling ties. Differences in the response rate were calculated with the stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen method. The same stratification factors that were used for 
randomization were applied to all stratified efficacy analyses.
The overall family-wise type I error rate was strictly controlled at a one-sided alpha level of 
2.5%. We calculated that enrollment of 470 patients would provide the study with 88% 
power to show a hazard ratio for death of 0.781 or better in the analysis of overall survival in 
the pembrolizumab group versus the chemotherapy group in the total population and 86% 
power to show a hazard ratio of 0.625 or better in the pembrolizumab group versus the 
chemotherapy group among patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 
10% or more.
The protocol specified two interim analyses before the final analysis. After reviewing the 
first interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring committee recommended continuing 
the study as planned. The second interim analysis was based on a cutoff date of September 
7, 2016, and was performed after 334 deaths had occurred in the total population and 104 
deaths had occurred in the population of patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive 
score of 10% or more. The data and safety monitoring committee reviewed the results of the 
second interim analysis on October 18, 2016, and recommended early termination of the 
trial because pembrolizumab met the superiority thresholds for overall survival in the 
coprimary populations (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). 
All the data reported herein are those from the second interim analysis. The full statistical 
analysis plan is available in the protocol.
RESULTS
PATIENTS AND TREATMENT
A total of 748 patients were screened for enrollment at 120 sites in 29 countries. Between 
November 5, 2014, and November 13, 2015, a total of 542 patients were randomly assigned 
to pembrolizumab (270 patients) or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (272). Of these, 
266 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 255 in the chemotherapy group received 
treatment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the chemotherapy group, 84 patients 
received docetaxel, 84 received paclitaxel, and 87 received vinflunine. The demographic and 
disease characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally balanced between the two 
treatment groups (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 164 
patients (30.3%), including 74 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 90 in the 
chemotherapy group, had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more (Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).

 The median duration of follow-up, defined as the time from randomization to September 7, 
2016, was 14.1 months (range, 9.9 to 22.1). In the as-treated population, the median duration 
of study treatment was 3.5 months (range, <0.1 to 20.0) in the pembrolizumab group and 1.5 
months (range, <0.1 to 14.2) in the chemotherapy group. A total of 49 patients (18.4%) in 
the pembrolizumab group and 3 (1.2%) in the chemotherapy group were still receiving study 
treatment at the time of data cutoff (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the 
intention-to-treat population, 68 patients (25.2%) in the pembrolizumab group and 91 
(33.5%) in the chemotherapy group received subsequent therapy, including 2 patients (0.7%) 
and 35 patients (12.9%), respectively, who received subsequent immunotherapy.
OVERALL SURVIVAL
As of September 7, 2016, a total of 334 deaths had occurred in the intention-to-treat 
population. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the 
chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 
0.91; P = 0.002) (Fig. 1A). The median overall survival was 10.3 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 
11.8) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.3) in the 
chemotherapy group. The estimated overall survival rate at 12 months was 43.9% (95% CI, 
37.8 to 49.9) in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 30.7% (95% CI, 25.0 to 36.7) 
in the chemotherapy group.
Pembrolizumab was also associated with significantly longer overall survival than 
chemotherapy in the coprimary population of patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined 
positive score of 10% or more (hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.88; P = 
0.005). The median overall survival was 8.0 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 12.3) in the 
pembrolizumab group, as compared with 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 7.4) in the 
chemotherapy group (Fig. S2A in the Supplementary Appendix). Pembrolizumab was 
associated with a benefit over chemotherapy in all the subgroups examined, including 
among patients with liver metastases and those who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive 
score of less than 1% (Fig. 2). In an analysis that considered the chemotherapy regimens 
separately, the benefit of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy was similar for each 
chemotherapy regimen (Fig. 2).
PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL
A total of 437 events of disease progression or death occurred in the intention-to-treat 
population, with no significant difference in the duration of progression-free survival 
between the pembrolizumab group and the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death or 
disease progression, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.19; P = 0.42) (Fig. 1B). The median 
progression-free survival was 2.1 months (95% CI, 2.0 to 2.2) in the pembrolizumab group 
and 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.3 to 3.5) in the chemotherapy group. The estimated progression-
free survival rate at 12 months was 16.8% (95% CI, 12.3 to 22.0) in the pembrolizumab 
group and 6.2% (95% CI, 3.3 to 10.2) in the chemotherapy group. There was also no 
significant between-group difference in the duration of progression-free survival among 
patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more (hazard ratio, 
0.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.28; P = 0.24) (Fig. S2B in the Supplementary Appendix).

 OBJECTIVE RESPONSE
In the total population, the objective response rate was significantly higher in the 
pembrolizumab group (21.1%; 95% CI, 16.4 to 26.5) than in the chemotherapy group 
(11.4%; 95% CI, 7.9 to 15.8) (P = 0.001). The median time to response was 2.1 months in 
each group. The median duration of response was not reached in the pembrolizumab group 
(range, 1.6+ to 15.6+ months) and was 4.3 months (range, 1.4+ to 15.4+) in the 
chemotherapy group (Fig. 3). (Plus signs indicate an ongoing response at data cutoff.)
At the time of data cutoff, 41 of 57 patients (72%) with a response in the pembrolizumab 
group and 11 of 31 (35%) with a response in the chemotherapy group continued to have a 
response. Treatment was ongoing in 36 of 57 patients with a response (63%) in the 
pembrolizumab group and in 2 of 31 (6%) with a response in the chemotherapy group (Fig. 
3). The estimated percentage of patients with a duration of response of at least 12 months 
was 68% in the pembrolizumab group versus 35% in the chemotherapy group. Results were 
similar in the population of patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 
10% or more. Details are provided in Table S4 and Figure S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to treatment occurred 
in 60.9% of the patients treated with pembrolizumab, as compared with 90.2% of those who 
received chemotherapy (Table 2). Treatment-related events of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity were 
less frequent in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (15.0% vs. 49.4% 
of patients), as was treatment-related discontinuation of therapy (5.6% vs. 11.0%). One 
pembrolizumab-treated patient died from treatment-related pneumonitis. Three other deaths 
in the pembrolizumab group were attributed by the investigators to study treatment, 
including one death related to urinary tract obstruction, one death related to malignant 
neoplasm progression, and one death of unspecified cause. In the chemotherapy group, 
treatment-related deaths were related to sepsis (in two patients), septic shock (in one), and 
unspecified cause (in one).
The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade were pruritus (19.5% of the 
patients), fatigue (13.9%), and nausea (10.9%) in the pembrolizumab group and alopecia 
(37.6%), fatigue (27.8%), and anemia (24.7%) in the chemotherapy group (Table 2). There 
were no treatment-related events of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity that occurred with an incidence 
of 5% or more in the pembrolizumab group. In the chemotherapy group, treatment-related 
events of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity with an incidence of 5% or more were neutropenia 
(13.3%), decreased neutrophil count (12.2%), anemia (7.8%), febrile neutropenia (7.1%), 
and decreased white-cell count (5.1%). A summary of all the adverse events with an 
incidence of 5% or more, regardless of whether they were attributed to treatment by the 
investigator, is provided in Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The adverse events of interest with regard to pembrolizumab, regardless of whether they 
were attributed to study treatment by the investigator, are shown in Table 2. The only events 
of grade 3, 4, or 5 severity that were observed in two or more patients who were treated with

 pembrolizumab were pneumonitis (2.3% of the patients), colitis (1.1%), and nephritis 
(0.8%); there was only one grade 5 event (0.4%), which was pneumonitis.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized, phase 3 study involving patients with advanced urothelial cancer that 
progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, pembrolizumab resulted in 
significantly longer overall survival — by approximately 3 months — than the investigator’s 
choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine (10.3 months vs. 7.4 months). Pembrolizumab 
had a better safety profile than did chemotherapy. The benefit of pembrolizumab over 
chemotherapy was seen in the total population, as well as in the coprimary population of 
patients who had a tumor PD-L1 combined positive score of 10% or more.
The overall survival benefit with pembrolizumab was observed across almost all the 
subgroups examined and was similar regardless of investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. In 
this trial, the benefit of pembrolizumab appeared to be independent of PD-L1 expression on 
tumor and infiltrating immune cells. The results of ongoing randomized, controlled trials 
currently being conducted in earlier lines of treatment may help elucidate the role of PD-L1 
expression as a biomarker in urothelial carcinoma. A relationship between smoking status 
and the relative benefit of pembrolizumab was observed. The relationship between smoking 
and the relative benefit of immunotherapy has also been observed in patients with other 
advanced cancers8,18 and may reflect a high mutational load in current and former 
smokers.19 Genomic analysis of this relationship is warranted. The median overall survival 
of 7.4 months that was observed with chemotherapy is consistent with historical data for 
second-line, single-agent treatment.4–7
Pembrolizumab resulted in a significantly higher objective response rate than chemotherapy. 
Most responses in patients in the pembrolizumab group occurred quickly and were reported 
at the first scheduled imaging assessment. Continued disease regression over time in some 
patients resulted in radiologically confirmed responses that were reported as long as 6.3 
months after the start of therapy. As compared with responses in the chemotherapy group, 
responses in the pembrolizumab group were durable, with a median duration of response 
that was not reached over a median follow-up of 14.1 months. On the basis of the Kaplan–
Meier estimates, 68% of the responses to pembrolizumab were ongoing at 12 months.
Durable responses in patients with advanced urothelial cancer have also been observed with 
the anti–PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab,10 durvalumab,13 and avelumab14 and the anti–
PD-1 antibody nivolumab.11 Atezolizumab and nivolumab are approved only in the United 
States for the treatment of advanced urothelial cancer that progressed during or after receipt 
of previous platinum-based chemotherapy. Accelerated approval of these two antibodies was 
based on objective-response data from single-group studies.10,11 Pembrolizumab has now 
been shown to result in a significant survival benefit over standard-of-care therapy in a large, 
randomized trial in this population.
Overall, there was no significant difference between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with 
regard to progression-free survival. Beyond 6 months, the progression-free survival curves

 diverged in favor of pembrolizumab. Similar findings have been observed with checkpoint 
inhibitors in other tumor types20–24 and suggest that in contrast to its use as a surrogate end 
point in historical chemotherapy studies, progression-free survival may not be a reliable 
surrogate end point for the clinical benefit of immunotherapy. The prolonged duration of 
response was seen only in patients who had a response to pembrolizumab, and because less 
than half the patients had a response, the therapy did not exert an effect on median 
progression-free survival. However, the duration of response in patients who had a response 
was much longer than the duration of response that was seen with chemotherapy.
The safety profiles that were observed with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were as 
expected, with no new or unexpected toxic effects. Immune-mediated adverse events with 
pembrolizumab were relatively infrequent and were mostly of grade 1 or 2 severity. Overall, 
the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was substantially lower with 
pembrolizumab than with standard chemotherapy, including fewer events of grade 3, 4, or 5 
severity and fewer events that resulted in the discontinuation of treatment. The number of 
treatment-related deaths was the same in the pembrolizumab group and the chemotherapy 
group, which probably reflects the poor prognosis of patients in this population. The better 
safety profile of pembrolizumab than of standard chemotherapy is important, considering 
that patients with recurrent or refractory urothelial carcinoma are generally older and have 
poor performance status and multiple coexisting conditions.
The survival benefit that was observed with pembrolizumab in this previously treated 
population of patients with a poor prognosis supports its study in earlier stages of disease. 
Currently, pembrolizumab and other PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are being evaluated as 
adjuvant therapy and as first-line therapy for advanced disease in ongoing clinical trials (e.g., 
ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02450331, NCT02516241, NCT02632409, NCT02807636, 
and NCT02853305).
In conclusion, pembrolizumab resulted in significantly longer overall survival — by 
approximately 3 months — than the investigator’s choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or 
vinflunine and was associated with a higher rate of objective response and a lower rate of

 Figure 1. Overall Survival and Progression-free Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival and progression-free survival 
according to treatment group. Tick marks represent patients who had data censored at the 
last time that they were known to be alive (Panel A) or who were known to be alive and 
without disease progression as assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 
version 1.1, by blinded, independent, central radiologic review (Panel B). The intention-to-
treat population included all the patients who underwent randomization. The one-sided 
superiority thresholds for pembrolizumab were a P value of 0.0123 in the analysis of overall 
survival and a P value of 0.0151 in the analysis of progression-free survival. The median 
overall survival was 10.3 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 11.8) in the pembrolizumab group, as 
compared with 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.3) in the chemotherapy group (44.8 weeks 
[95% CI, 34.8 to 51.3] vs. 32.2 weeks [95% CI, 26.5 to 36.1]). The median progression-free 
survival was 2.1 months (95% CI, 2.0 to 2.2) in the pembrolizumab group and 3.3 months 
(95% CI, 2.3 to 3.5) in the chemotherapy group (9.1 weeks [95% CI, 8.7 to 9.6] and 14.3 
weeks [95% CI, 10.0 to 15.2], respectively).

 Figure 2. Analysis of Overall Survival in Key Subgroups
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status scores range from 0 to 5, 
with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher scores indicating greater disability; a score of 2 
indicates that the patient is ambulatory and capable of all self-care but is unable to carry out 
any work activities and is out of bed more than 50% of waking hours. The programmed 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score was defined as the percentage of tumor and 
infiltrating immune cells with PD-L1 expression out of the total number of tumor cells. The 
upper tract was defined as the renal pelvis or ureter, and the lower tract as the bladder or 
urethra. Risk factors include the Bellmunt risk factors of an ECOG performance-status score 
above 0, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g per deciliter, and the presence of liver 
metastases,16 plus a time since the completion or discontinuation of previous therapy of less 
than 3 months.17 The number of patients in each of the subgroups of investigator’s choice of

 chemotherapy represents the number of patients who received at least one dose of that 
treatment (84 patients received docetaxel, 84 paclitaxel, and 87 vinflunine) plus the number 
of patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab (266). For all other subgroups, 
the intention-to-treat population was used. Data were missing as follows: ECOG 
performance-status score (10 patients), smoking status (4), histologic type (2), tumor PD-L1 
combined positive score 1% cutoff (14), tumor PD-L1 combined positive score 10% cutoff 
(16), location of primary tumor (1), location of metastases (2), liver metastases (1), 
hemoglobin concentration (13), number of risk factors (15), context of most recent therapy 
received (2), time since most recent chemotherapy (2), and type of previous platinum 
therapy (2). Data for 2 patients with other histologic type and for 2 patients with other 
previous platinum therapy are also not shown. The dashed line indicates the rate of overall 
survival in the entire trial population.
