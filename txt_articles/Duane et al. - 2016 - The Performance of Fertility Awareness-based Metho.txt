 BRIEF REPORT
The Performance of Fertility Awareness-based
Method Apps Marketed to Avoid Pregnancy

Introduction: In recent years there has been an explosion in the development of medical apps, with
more than 40,000 apps now available. Nearly 100 apps allow women to track their fertility and men-
strual cycles and can be used to avoid or achieve pregnancy. Apps offer a convenient way to track fertil-
ity biomarkers. However, only some use evidence-based fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs),
which with ideal use have rates of effectiveness similar to those of commonly used forms of hormonal
birth control. Since having a baby or preventing a pregnancy are important responsibilities, it is critical
that women and couples have access to reliable, evidence-based apps that allow them to accurately track
their fertility.
Methods: We developed a tool to evaluate and rate fertility apps. This tool is specifically designed to
help couples avoid pregnancy.
Results: Results showed that the majority of fertility apps are not based on evidence-based FABMs or
include a disclaimer discouraging use for avoiding pregnancy. However, at least 1 app in each FABM
category (except symptohormonal methods) had a perfect score on accuracy.
Conclusion: Relying solely on an app to use an FABM, without appropriate training in the method,
may not be sufficient to prevent pregnancy. (J Am Board Fam Med 2016;29:508–511.)

The field of women’s health and fertility tracking
applications (apps) has recently exploded, with
nearly 100 apps available to help women track
their cycle.1 The most popular apps have been
downloaded over 1 million times each, and up to
60% of women express interest in using natural
or fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs) to
prevent pregnancy.2 These methods are attrac-
tive because they lack medical side effects, are
effective, and can empower women with knowl-
edge about their bodies. For each evidence-based
method (Billings, Creighton, two-day, sympto-
thermal, symptohormonal, standard days, and
lactational
amenorrhea
methods),

studies that demonstrate that these methods,
when used correctly, have rates of effectiveness
similar to those of commonly used forms of hor-
monal birth control.3– 6
The effectiveness of FABMs depends on women
observing and recording fertility biomarkers and
following evidence-based guidelines. Apps offer a
convenient way to track fertility biomarkers, but
only some use evidence-based FABMs.2 Until now

 there have been no objective assessments of the
apps designed for use to avoid pregnancy.1 In this
study we developed a rating tool with specific cri-
teria to quantify an app’s response to real cycle data
based on the clinical guidelines evaluated in level 1
studies.
Methods
We identified 95 apps for study via iTunes,
Google, and Google Play searches. Of those, we
excluded 55 apps because they either had a dis-
claimer prohibiting use for avoiding pregnancy or
did not claim to use an evidence-based FABM as
described in Manhart et al.3
The rating system was developed based on cri-
teria used by Family Practice Management to evalu-
ate medical apps.7 We rated each app for 10 clearly
defined criteria (each on a 5-point scale), which
were weighted based on their level of importance
for avoiding pregnancy (Table 1).
A standardized data set of 7 cycles of daily fer-
tility observations, derived from real cycle data, was
used to determine the apps’ accuracy in identifying
potential days of fertility. For each cycle, evidence-
based fertile days (FDs) were determined by apply-
ing specific guidelines for each FABM, as evaluated
in peer-reviewed studies.3 The accuracy of each
app was determined by comparing evidence-based
FDs to the fertile days of each cycle as identified by
the app, called the app-defined FDs (Figure 1).
Apps that did not predict fertile days scored high
on accuracy only if they recommended prior
FABM training apart from the app.
Results
Of those reviewed, 30 apps predicted days of fer-
tility for the user and 10 did not. Table 2 ranks the
apps based on the mean accuracy and authority

*The data is representative of the apps at the time they were reviewed (Spring of 2015). Current versions of the app may be different.
†This app had either a perfect score on accuracy (app-defined fertile days � evidence-based fertile days) or no false negatives (days
of fertility classified as infertile).
‡Rhythm is not an evidence-based FABM.
Glow was originally included in the study because it did not appear to meet the exclusion criteria. However, the developers clarified
that the app is not a substitute for an FABM. Therefore, it should not be used by women attempting to avoid pregnancy through the
use of an FABM. FABM, fertility awareness-based method.

J Am Board Fam Med: first published as 10.3122/jabfm.2016.04.160022 on 7 July 2016. Downloaded from 
 scores, since the total scores include some reviewer
subjectivity (such as ease of use) and users may be
more concerned with accuracy. Only 6 apps
(marked with * in Table 2) had either a perfect
score on accuracy (app-defined FDs � evidence-
based FDs) or no false negatives (days of fertility
classified as infertile).
Discussion
The majority of fertility apps are neither designed
for avoiding pregnancy nor founded on evidence-
based FABMs. Several popular apps use their own
algorithms, which are difficult to assess because
they have not been evaluated in peer-reviewed lit-
erature. Attractive apps are not necessarily effective
and vice versa. At least 1 app had a perfect score on
accuracy in each FABM category except sympto-
hormonal methods. Apps that do not predict days
of fertility may be still useful for experienced
FABM users to electronically record their data.
Success using FABMs depends on many factors,
including the ability to accurately make and classify
daily observations. Relying solely on an FABM app
may not be sufficient to prevent pregnancy.
