ABSTRACT
Aim: Patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) whose intraocular pressure is not adequately con-
trolled by one medication have several treatment options in the US. This analysis evaluated direct costs
of unilateral eye treatment with two trabecular micro-bypass stents (two iStents) compared to selective
laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) or medications only.
Materials and methods: A population-based, annual state-transition, probabilistic, cost-of-care model
was used to assess OAG-related costs over 5 years. Patients were modeled to initiate treatment in year
zero with two iStents, SLT, or medications only. In years 1–5, patients could remain on initial treatment
or move to another treatment option(s), or filtration surgery. Treatment strategy change probabilities
were identified by a clinician panel. Direct costs were included for drugs, procedures, and
complications.
Results: The projected average cumulative cost at 5 years was lower in the two-stent treatment arm
($4,420) compared to the SLT arm ($4,730) or medications-only arm ($6,217). Initial year-zero costs
were higher with two iStents ($2,810) than with SLT ($842) or medications only ($996). Average mar-
ginal annual costs in years 1–5 were $322 for two iStents, $777 for SLT, and $1,044 for medications
only. The cumulative cost differences between two iStents vs SLT or medications only decreased over
time, with breakeven by 5 or 3 years post-initiation, respectively. By year 5, cumulative savings with
two iStents over SLT or medications only was $309 or $1,797, respectively.
Limitations: This analysis relies on clinical expert panel opinion and would benefit from real-world
evidence on use of multiple procedures and treatment switching after two-stent treatment, SLT, or
polypharmaceutical initial approaches.
Conclusions: Despite higher costs in year zero, annual costs thereafter were lowest in the two-stent
treatment arm. Two-stent treatment may reduce OAG-related health resource use, leading to direct
savings, especially over medications only or at longer time horizons.

Introduction
Glaucoma, which affects �60 million people worldwide and
more than 2.2 million people in the US, is the second leading
cause of blindness globally. Global trends show a growing
prevalence of total glaucoma and open angle glaucoma (OAG)
worldwide1,2. The most important risk factor for glaucoma is
elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Thus, a central goal of all
glaucoma therapy is IOP reduction3,4. The management of
patients with OAG should take into account the risks associ-
ated with therapy and other factors such as age, disease sever-
ity, comorbidities, tolerability of medications, desired post-
operative IOP, and cost5–7. Treatment options for OAG have
traditionally included medical therapy, laser trabeculoplasty,
incisional glaucoma procedures, and cyclodestructive surgery8.
Topical eye drops require adherence from patients and are not
always well-tolerated. Laser therapy such as Selective Laser
Trabeculoplasty (SLT) can provide a clinically significant reduc-
tion of IOP. Among OAG patients who range from newly diag-
nosed to those on maximally tolerated medical therapy, SLT
results in a 6.9–35.9% intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction and
complications are rare9.
However, the long-term results are
questionable, as failure rates have been reported in the range
of 33–74%9–11.

ces, is a heparin-coated, non-ferromagnetic, titanium stent
1 mm in length and 0.3 mm in height. The iStent Trabecular
Micro-Bypass is a “first in class” MIGS device that addresses
mild-to-moderate open-angle glaucoma, thereby potentially
filling an important gap in the current treatment algorithm for

 glaucoma3. The stent is designed to cannulate Schlemm’s canal
and create a communication from this space directly to the
anterior chamber, allowing aqueous humor to egress into
Schlemm’s canal more easily, thereby lowering IOP.
Understanding whether one of these treatment options
confers a greater value relative to the other is important for
many different stakeholders, including healthcare policy-mak-
ers, third-party payers, eye providers, and, most importantly,
patients. With the dramatically increasing costs of healthcare
in the US, it is essential to find ways to curtail costs, ideally
without sacrificing the quality of care provided. This analysis
evaluated the direct costs in the US of unilateral eye treat-
ment with two trabecular micro-bypass stents (two iStents)
compared to selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) or medica-
tions only over 5 years post-initiation.
Methods
An analysis of the cost impact of using the iStent device for
treatment of patients whose OAG was not adequately con-
trolled by one medication was built as a Markov model using
TreeAge modeling software. The analysis was a payer-per-
spective,
population-based,
state-transition,
probabilistic,
cost-of-care model with an annual cycle and a 5-year time
horizon. Direct costs were considered for OAG-related drugs,
procedures, and complications for the treated eye. Three
treatment arms were included in the analysis. Initiating treat-
ment with an iStent procedure was compared to two alter-
nate current treatment options: initiating treatment with an
SLT procedure, or initiating treatment with medications
alone.
Treatment transition probabilities
Treatment switching and other downstream filtering surgery
procedures were permitted in the analysis in subsequent
years (after 1 year post-initiation) (Figure 1). Filtering surgery
procedures considered included trabeculectomy, aqueous
shunt, and an ab externo drainage device without an extra-
ocular reservoir (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes
66170; 66180 with or without 67225; and 66183, respect-
ively); these procedures were selected and their distribution
identified based on an analysis of the 2013 CMS Standard
Analytical File. For each treatment arm in each cycle, the
probabilities of downstream procedures, and the probabilities
and numbers of concurrent medications were identified by a
panel of clinicians experienced in the care of patients with
glaucoma (Table 1). In establishing these probabilities, panel
discussion acknowledged and accounted for the difference
between effectiveness reported in clinical trials and effective-
ness observed in real-world settings where patient circum-
stance and adherence to medication were less controlled
and more varied.
Medications use
Medications considered in this analysis were prostaglandins,
beta-blockers,
carbonic
anhydrase
inhibitors,
and
alpha
adrenergic agonists (Table 2). The analysis allowed for treat-
ment with a mix of medications only, and for concurrent
medication(s) use with downstream iStents, SLT, or filtering
surgery procedures. During each cycle, patients being treated
with iStents, SLT, or filtering procedures could have 0–4 con-
current medications, and patients being treated with medica-
tions-only treatment could have 2–4 concurrent medications.
The market shares for drug manufacturers (branded and/or
generic) within each class of drug were from 2014 IMS data.
Direct costs
Drug acquisition costs were from 2016 RED BOOK. Drug dos-
ages from package inserts for each drug were applied.
Calculations for liquid mediation use rate assumed 20 drops
per mL based on previously published analyses of glaucoma
drug costs and liquid medications wastage with patient
administration11–13. These data, along with medications use
treatment patterns, were used to derive the annual costs for
glaucoma medications (Table 3).
Costs of procedures were from the 2016 Outpatient
Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Limited Data Set (LDS)
(Table 3). Complication costs were $0 for both the iStent and
SLT procedures based on published literature that demon-
strated
that
complications
risks
with
either
were
very
low14–16. Complications costs with filtering surgeries were
based on an analysis of the 2013 CMS Standard Analytical
File. All costs are reported in 2016 US dollars using the con-
sumer price indices reported by the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics17. Later-year costs were discounted to year 0 using
an annual time preference discount rate of 3% in accordance
with the Good Research Practices for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

Sensitivity analyses
One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the
effect of input uncertainty on the model’s results. Each input
was varied across a range of values, and the resulting
changes in the modeled 5-year cumulative costs were eval-
uated. Complication costs for all years were varied together
for each treatment. Complication costs with the SLT proced-
ure or the iStent procedure were varied between zero (base-
case), and 50% of the basecase complication costs with
filtering surgery (Table 3). Medication costs were varied
together as a group by ±25%. The annual time preference
discount rate was varied between 1–5% in accordance with
ISPOR guidelines. The probability of downstream procedures
(SLT, filtering surgery, or iStent procedure) after initial treat-
ment in each treatment arm was varied by ±50%. All other
cost
variables
were
adjusted
independently
by
±25%.
The maximum variation in results due to inputs uncertainty
was identified, as were the inputs whose uncertainty range
most influenced the results.
Results
The cumulative total costs over 5 years for patients initiating
treatment with medications only, SLT, and iStent procedures
were $6,217.08, $4,729.85, and $4,420.38 per patient on aver-
age, respectively (Figure 2). Cumulative cost-savings over
5 years with the iStent procedure compared to medications
only was estimated at $1,796.70 per patient on average. The
cumulative cost with the iStent procedure was approximately
equivalent to SLT only at 5 years ($309.47 lower with the
iStent procedure).
Of the three treatment options, the initial year 0 cost was
highest with the iStent procedure, due to initial device acqui-
sition cost and lowest with SLT. These were offset by the
annual marginal costs after initial treatment (years 1–5),
which were lowest with the iStent procedure, and highest
with medications only (Table 4). Costs in each year following
SLT or medications only initial treatments were more than
double that of the iStent procedure. In the first following
year (year 1), the annual marginal cost was 3.2-times higher
with SLT, and 4.9-times higher with medications only, com-
pared to the iStent procedure.
One-way
sensitivity
analyses
identified
the
variables
whose uncertainty most influenced the results (Table 5).
These demonstrated that the cost of the iStent procedure,
cost of medications, and probability of downstream proce-
dures in the SLT procedure arm were the variables whose
uncertainty most influenced the cost-comparison between
the iStent procedure and SLT (Figure 3(a)). For the cost-
comparison between the iStent procedure and medications-
only, the variables whose uncertainty had the most effect
were the cost of medications, cost of the iStent procedure,
and probability of downstream procedures in the iStent
procedure arm (Figure 3(b)).

 Discussion
Medications cumulative costs following initial treatment with
the iStent procedure is cost-saving compared to initial treat-
ment with medications-only by year 3. The cumulative cost-
savings continue to increase in subsequent years. Cumulative
costs with initial treatment with the iStent procedure reaches
breakeven with initial SLT treatment between years 4 and 5,
despite higher costs in year 0 with the iStent procedure. In
combination with the lower annual marginal costs in years
1–5 after iStent procedure compared to medications-only ini-
tial treatment strategies, this suggests that analyses with lon-
ger time horizons than 5 years may
show the iStent
procedure to be increasingly cost-saving compared to SLT.
Further research is needed to test these expectations and
confirm these results in real-world settings. Despite higher
costs in year zero, annual costs thereafter were lowest in the
two-stent treatment arm. Five-year cumulative costs in the
two-stent treatment arm were approximately equivalent to

There are several study limitations that need to be

 panel of clinicians experienced in the treatment of glaucoma.
These probabilities are based on years of clinical experience,
but are still theoretical. These inputs, and therefore this ana-
lysis, could be strengthened with real-world evidence. For all
model assumptions, we were able to use one-way sensitivity
analyses to examine the impact of changing the assumptions
on the findings. The probability of downstream procedures
(SLT, filtering surgery, or iStent procedure) after initial treat-
ment in each treatment arm was varied by ±50% (Figure 3).
Even with this high range, the results remain relatively stable.
In addition, mortality was not considered in this 5 year
model because glaucoma patients, regardless of treatment,
have similar mortality rates. Also, only direct medical costs
were considered. Glaucoma has a significant impact on
HRQoL, even in the early stages of disease19. HRQoL reflects
a person’s wellbeing and focuses on dimensions of physical
functioning, social functioning, mental health, and general
health perceptions. Ongoing visual field loss can impair
patients’ abilities to perform common daily activities (e.g.
driving, walking, and reading). Vision loss may impose an
increasing psychological burden on patients and their fami-
lies. As vision worsens, patients experience increasing psycho-
logical burden, along with a growing fear of blindness, social
withdrawal from impaired vision, and depression19.
This study confirms previous findings that OAG is a
chronic disease which incurs substantial annual costs that
increase over time as the disease progresses19,20. Inadequate
treatment results in disease progression, leading to appre-
ciable increases in resource utilization, costs for end-stage
therapy, and indirect costs21,22. A medication regimen typic-
ally continues for the rest of a patient’s life. The successful
management of a patient’s glaucoma, in terms of slowing the
disease progression, is dependent on the patient’s ability to
adhere to the recommended medication regimen and to per-
sist with the therapy. In fact, recent research has shown that
up to 90% of patients after 12 months in the US are non-
adherent with their ocular hypotensive drug therapies23. The
challenge with adherence has been documented in the litera-
ture, and is due to the inability to properly administer eye
drops, cost considerations, and a lack of awareness of the
slow but gradual loss of vision. Studies have shown that poor
medication adherence is associated with worsening glau-
coma. Progression rates, despite primarily medical treatment
from landmark long-term longitudinal studies, are available
and ranges up to 50% over 5 years or longer24. This high-
lights the difficulty with medical adherence and the inad-
equacy of medical treatment to maintain patients in a safe
IOP zone. Finally, caution is warranted when attempting to
generalize these study findings to patients with other forms
of glaucoma, those without health insurance, those outside
of the US, and patients who don’t have access to iStent or
SLT, as variables may differ considerably from those used in
the model for these groups.
Conclusion
This analysis shows that, despite higher costs in year zero,
annual
costs
thereafter
were
lowest
in
the
two-stent
treatment arm and showed savings compared to the medica-
tions only and SLT treatment arms. Two-stent treatment may

at longer time horizons.
