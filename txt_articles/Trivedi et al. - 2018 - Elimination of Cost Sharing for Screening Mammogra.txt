Abstract
BACKGROUND—The Affordable Care Act (ACA) required most insurers and the Medicare 
program to eliminate cost sharing for screening mammography.
METHODS—We conducted a difference-in-differences study of biennial screening 
mammography among 15,085 women 65 to 74 years of age in 24 Medicare Advantage plans that 
eliminated cost sharing to provide full coverage for screening mammography, as compared with 
52,035 women in 48 matched control plans that had and maintained full coverage.
RESULTS—In plans that eliminated cost sharing, adjusted rates of biennial screening 
mammography increased from 59.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.9 to 65.0) in the 2-year 
period before cost-sharing elimination to 65.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 69.0) in the 2-year period 
thereafter. In control plans, the rates of biennial mammography were 73.1% (95% CI, 69.2 to 77.0) 
and 72.8% (95% CI, 69.7 to 76.0) during the same periods, yielding a difference in differences of 
5.7 percentage points (95% CI, 3.0 to 8.4). The difference in differences was 9.8 percentage points 
(95% CI, 4.5 to 15.2) among women living in the areas with the highest quartile of educational 
attainment versus 4.3 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 8.4) among women in the lowest quartile. 
As indicated by the difference-in-differences estimates, after the elimination of cost sharing, the 
rate of biennial mammography increased by 6.5 percentage points (95% CI, 3.7 to 9.4) for white 
women and 8.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.5 to 14.4) for black women but was almost 
unchanged for Hispanic women (0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −7.3 to 8.1).
CONCLUSIONS—The elimination of cost sharing for screening mammography under the ACA 
was associated with an increase in rates of use of this service among older women for whom 
screening is recommended. The effect was attenuated among women living in areas with lower 
educational attainment and was negligible among Hispanic women. (Funded by the National

 An extensive body of evidence, including a landmark clinical trial, has shown that cost 
sharing — requiring people to pay for health care in the form of a deductible, copayment, or 
other out-of-pocket expense — reduces the use of health services.1–4 Cost sharing deters the 
use of effective, but often underused, preventive health care.4–7 On the basis of this 
evidence, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) required most private insurance plans and the 
federal Medicare program to eliminate cost sharing for preventive services that are 
recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).8 The elimination of 
cost sharing for preventive care was one of the first large-scale applications of value-based 
insurance design, which links the generosity of insurance coverage for a service to the value 
of that service in improving health.9
Out-of-pocket payments for preventive services disproportionately affect women. As 
compared with men, women have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care and are more 
likely to delay or avoid recommended preventive care because of costs.10 Of the 44 
preventive services recommended by the USPSTF for adults, 26 apply specifically to 
women, and none apply specifically to men.11 A requirement for even modest copayments 
for woman-specific preventive services, such as mammograms or Papanicolaou smears, 
reduces the number of women who receive this care.6,7,12 The negative effects of 
copayments are larger for mammography than for other preventive services and are more 
pronounced among women of lower socioeconomic status.7,12
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women and most 
commonly occurs among older women.13 Because age-appropriate screening can reduce 
mortality from breast cancer, the USPSTF recommends biennial screening for women 50 to 
74 years of age who are at average risk for breast cancer and has concluded that “women 
aged 60 to 69 years are most likely to avoid breast cancer death through mammography 
screening.”14 This study of Medicare Advantage plans, which enrolled 31% of the Medicare 
population in 2016,15 addressed two main questions. First, does the elimination of cost 
sharing increase rates of screening mammography among older women? Second, do the 
effects of eliminating cost sharing vary according to race, ethnic group, and socioeconomic 
status?
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES
We conducted a difference-in-differences study to compare rates of biennial screening 
mammography in Medicare Advantage plans that eliminated cost sharing for this service 
against matched control plans that had and maintained full coverage. We obtained the 
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) from 2007 through 2013 for 
Medicare Advantage plans and linked these data to the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File 
and information on the benefits of the health plans. The match rate between the HEDIS and 
the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File was 99.6%. To obtain data on area-level 
socioeconomic status, we linked enrollees’ ZIP Codes to 2010 Census data. The study 
protocol was approved by the Brown University Human Research Protections Office and the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Privacy Board.

 IDENTIFYING INTERVENTION AND CONTROL PLANS
Among plans with at least 4 years of continuous participation in the Medicare Advantage 
program from 2007 through 2013, we identified 24 plans that required cost sharing for 
screening mammography for at least 2 years before its elimination. These plans are hereafter 
referred to as “intervention plans.” We defined cost sharing as a requirement for an out-of-
pocket payment (i.e., copayment or coinsurance) for screening mammography. Because the 
health reform legislation was passed in the Senate in 2009 and by the House of 
Representatives in 2010 and was officially signed into law in 2010, we included plans that 
eliminated cost sharing in 2009 (17 plans), 2010 (4 plans), and 2011 (3 plans).
We identified 239 potential control plans that provided full coverage of mammography 
before and after the ACA mandate and operated in the same state as the intervention plans or 
in a bordering state. We randomly ordered the 24 intervention plans and matched each of 
them to 2 randomly chosen control plans that operated in the same state. For 4 intervention 
plans, we could not identify 2 control plans in the same state; in those cases, we instead 
selected one or both controls from a bordering state. We matched plans without replacement, 
which yielded 24 intervention plans and 48 matched control plans. We matched plans 
without awareness of information on mammography utilization.
STUDY POPULATION
Our study population included women 65 years of age or older who were eligible for the 
HEDIS quality measure for breast-cancer screening. The measure required women to have 
been enrolled in the Medicare Advantage plan for 2 years with no gap in coverage exceeding 
45 days. Before 2012, the upper age limit for the HEDIS indicator was 69 years; from 2012 
onward, the upper age limit was 74 years. We excluded women who were dually eligible for 
Medicare and Medicaid coverage.
OUTCOMES AND COVARIATES
The outcome variable was a dichotomous variable (yes or no) indicating whether at least one 
screening mammogram had been received in a given calendar year or the year before (i.e., 
biennial screening). Women could contribute more than one observation if they were 
sampled for the HEDIS indicator in different calendar years. Our primary independent 
variable was the product term of enrollment in an intervention plan and time period (before 
or after the elimination of cost sharing). Because our outcome was biennial screening, we 
restricted the post-policy observations to those that occurred during the second full calendar 
year after the elimination of cost sharing, in order to capture a period during which all 
screening mammograms were free.
We obtained information on the following covariates: age (in years), race and ethnic group 
(based on a validated algorithm16), the proportion of persons 65 years of age or older living 
in the enrollee’s ZIP Code who completed high school, the proportion of persons 65 years of 
age or older living below the federal poverty level in the enrollee’s ZIP Code, and calendar 
year. We assigned women to quartiles of ZIP Code–level poverty and ZIP Code–level 
educational attainment, using our study cohort to determine quartile cutoff points. We did 
not include plan-level covariates because they did not vary over time.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We estimated treatment effects with generalized linear models in which receipt of biennial 
screening was the outcome, using a binomial distribution and the identity link function. We 
adjusted treatment effects for the covariates described above and obtained standard errors 
that accounted for clustering of observations at the level of the health plan.17 We excluded 
from our regression analyses 1406 women (1.8%) for whom ZIP Code–level socioeconomic 
data were missing. Our main analyses included data from the calendar year before cost 
sharing was eliminated and from the second full calendar year after the copayment was 
eliminated. Sensitivity analyses included all observations from plans up to 2 years before 
and 3 years after cost sharing was removed. To examine changes in the rates of biennial 
mammography that occurred before the elimination of cost sharing, we graphed screening 
rates in intervention and control plans over time and tested an interaction between 
intervention and time, using data from the period before the elimination of cost sharing. 
Further information about the regression specification and additional sensitivity analyses is 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
We examined whether effects varied across the 24 matched groups of intervention and 
control plans. We also examined effect modification according to race and ethnic group, 
quartile of ZIP Code–level poverty, and quartile of ZIP Code–level educational attainment, 
using three-way product terms (“interactions”) between intervention status, time, and the 
effect modifiers. Analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION
The study population included 16,202 observations from 15,085 women in intervention 
plans and 61,164 observations from 52,035 women in control plans. Of the 48 control plans, 
43 were located in the same state as the matched intervention plan; the remaining 5 were in a 
bordering state. As compared with women in control plans, women in intervention plans 
were significantly younger, less likely to be a member of a racial or ethnic minority group, 
and more likely to be living in areas with lower rates of high-school completion and higher 
rates of poverty (P<0.001); the magnitudes of these differences were modest (Table 1). Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix provides additional description of the included plans. Of 
the 24 intervention plans, 2 eliminated coinsurance of 20%, and the remaining 22 eliminated 
copayments of either $25 or $30.
CHANGES IN RATES OF BIENNIAL SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY
In intervention plans, rates of biennial screening mammography increased from 59.9% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 54.9 to 65.0) in the 2-year period before cost sharing was 
eliminated to 65.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 69.0) in the 2-year period after cost sharing was 
eliminated (Table 2). In control plans, the rates of biennial screening were 73.1% (95% CI, 
69.2 to 77.0) in the prepolicy period and 72.8% (95% CI, 69.7 to 76.0) in the postpolicy 
period. The adjusted difference in differences between the intervention and control plans 
was 5.7 percentage points (95% CI, 3.0 to 8.4). In analyses stratified according to the year of

 cost-sharing elimination, we found adjusted difference-in-differences estimates of 5.4 
percentage points (95% CI, 2.3 to 8.5) for the 17 plans that eliminated cost sharing in 2009, 
6.8 percentage points (95% CI, 1.3 to 12.3) for the 4 plans that eliminated cost sharing in 
2010, and 5.8 percentage points (95% CI, −3.7 to 15.4) for the 3 plans that eliminated cost 
sharing in 2011.
Trends in adjusted screening rates throughout the study period are shown in Figure 1, and 
Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix shows trends in adjusted difference-in-differences 
estimates for the intervention and control plans. Relative to concurrent screening rates in 
control plans, screening rates in intervention plans declined significantly during the 2 years 
before cost-sharing elimination and then increased significantly after cost-sharing 
elimination. The difference-in-differences estimates were not significant thereafter.
Figure 2 shows adjusted difference-in-differences estimates in each of the 24 groups of 
intervention and control plans. The median difference-in-differences estimate was 6.0 
percentage points (interquartile range, 0.0 to 9.2). For 18 of the 24 groups, the difference-in-
differences estimate was positive, indicating an increase in the rate of screening in the 
intervention plan as compared with the rates in matched control plans.
Our findings were stable in sensitivity analyses (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) 
that used different model specifications, excluded women contributing multiple observations 
to the analyses, excluded matched groups with extreme results, restricted the analysis to for-
profit plans, treated socioeconomic covariates as categorical terms, and used alternative 
approaches for handling missing socioeconomic data.
CHANGES IN RATES ACCORDING TO RACE OR ETHNIC GROUP, EDUCATION, AND 
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
Table 3 shows the difference-in-differences estimates for screening rates in intervention 
plans as compared with those in control plans according to race, ethnic group, and area-level 
socioeconomic status. The elimination of cost sharing was associated with a greater increase 
in the rate of biennial mammography among women living in areas in the highest quartile of 
educational attainment than among those living in areas in the lowest quartile (difference-in-
differences estimate, 9.8 percentage points [95% CI, 4.5 to 15.2] vs. 4.3 percentage points 
[95% CI, 0.2 to 8.4]; P = 0.03 for interaction). The elimination of cost sharing was also 
associated with a greater increase in screening rates among women living in areas in the 
lowest quartile of poverty than among those living in areas in the highest quartile, although 
the differential effect according to quartile of poverty was not significant (difference-in-
differences estimate, 8.5 percentage points [95% CI, 4.5 to 12.5] vs. 2.2 percentage points 
[95% CI, −1.6 to 5.9]; P = 0.24 for interaction). As indicated by the difference-in-differences 
estimates, the elimination of cost sharing led to increases of 6.5 percentage points (95% CI, 
3.7 to 9.4) and 8.4 percentage points (95% CI, 2.5 to 14.4) among white and black women, 
respectively, but almost no change among Hispanic women (difference-in-differences 
estimate, 0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −7.3 to 8.1), although the differential effect 
according to race and ethnic group was not significant (P = 0.18 for interaction).

 DISCUSSION
This study of the effects of eliminating cost sharing for screening mammography has three 
main findings. First, among Medicare Advantage plans that eliminated cost sharing, rates of 
screening mammography increased by approximately 6 percentage points as compared with 
matched control plans that maintained full coverage for mammography. Second, the 
increases in screening occurred during the immediate 2-year period after cost sharing was 
eliminated, with little increase after that time. Third, cost sharing elimination appeared to 
have attenuated effects among women living in areas with lower educational attainment and 
negligible effects among Hispanic women.
Our findings extend those of previous studies showing that, among older women, receipt of 
screening mammography is sensitive to out-of-pocket costs and the presence of 
supplemental coverage. For instance, we previously reported that copayments of 
approximately $20 were associated with reductions in rates of breast-cancer screening of 8 
to 11 percentage points.7 Another study reported that female Medicare beneficiaries with 
supplemental insurance coverage were twice as likely as women who lacked supplemental 
coverage to receive mammography in the first 2 years that Medicare began covering this 
service.18 The absolute magnitude of these reductions was larger than the increases in 
mammography rates observed in our study after the elimination of copayments. The 
difference in magnitude is consistent with economic theory suggesting that removal of cost 
sharing for health services will generally have a smaller (absolute) effect than the imposition 
of cost sharing of the same value.19
Several before-and-after studies have shown minimal changes in the rates of use of 
mammography and other preventive services after the implementation of the ACA.20–24 
These studies examined population trends without specifically identifying groups that were 
relieved of cost-sharing requirements. Two quasi-experimental studies, each using data from 
a single insurer, have reported mixed findings. The first study did not detect increases in the 
use of diagnostic and screening mammography in the first 9 months after the 
implementation of the ACA among Humana beneficiaries.25 The second study reported 
smaller declines in rates of screening mammography among Medicare Advantage enrollees 
in Kaiser Northern California who had copayments removed than among enrollees with 
continuously free mammography.26 Our study extends this research by applying a quasi-
experimental design to a national sample of 72 Medicare Advantage plans.
Our finding that women living in areas of lower educational attainment were less responsive 
to the cost-sharing reduction may seem counter-intuitive. It is consistent, however, with 
emerging evidence about vulnerable patients’ awareness of features of health insurance and 
the ACA. For instance, a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that in 2014, 
just 43% of respondents were aware that the ACA eliminated cost sharing for preventive 
care.27 Among persons with income near the poverty level, only 22% reported hearing 
“some” or “a lot” about the availability of preventive care without copayments or 
coinsurance.28 Latino patients have been found to have less awareness of the ACA than the 
general population.29 Furthermore, studies within the past 5 years have documented 
socioeconomic disparities in knowledge of basic concepts of health insurance.30–33 An

 American Life Panel survey reported that approximately 30% of persons with an income at 
or below the federal poverty limit could correctly describe a deductible.32 These findings, 
along with the results of our study, support the importance of outreach to Hispanic women 
and socioeconomically vulnerable populations about reductions in cost sharing for 
preventive care and other similar value-based changes in insurance policies. Otherwise, such 
strategies may paradoxically increase disparities if affluent and better-educated patients are 
more likely to understand and respond to them.
Our study has additional policy implications. Since screening rates in the plans that 
eliminated cost sharing remained below those in plans with full coverage and less than three 
quarters of women in control plans received biennial breast-cancer screening, the removal of 
out-of-pocket payments alone may not raise screening rates to desired levels. Furthermore, 
our findings must be considered in the context of the potential repeal of the ACA. If the cost-
sharing provisions of the ACA are rescinded, our results raise concern that fewer older 
women will receive recommended breast-cancer screening.
The primary limitation of this study is that women were not randomly assigned to 
intervention and control plans and plans were not randomly assigned to the policy change. 
We attempted to mitigate this bias by matching intervention and control plans 
geographically and by using a difference-in-differences design that controls for time-
invariant plan characteristics. Of note, screening rates in intervention plans remained lower 
than those in control plans even after cost sharing was eliminated. This finding suggests that 
intervention plans differed from control plans in ways other than coverage of screening 
mammography. For instance, control plans may have used more effective quality-
improvement strategies to raise mammography rates. To account for our findings, however, 
these efforts or other unobserved differences between intervention and control plans would 
need to have occurred after the elimination of cost sharing and to have affected the rate of 
mammography only during the immediate 2-year period when screening mammography first 
became free.
An additional limitation is the use of ZIP Code–level measures of income and education, 
which are imperfect proxies for individual-level measures.34 Our data lacked information to 
further characterize Hispanic subgroups; rates of mammography vary widely among 
Hispanic Americans according to area of origin and length of U.S. residency.35,36 We could 
not assess the clinical appropriateness of screening decisions for women with limited life 
expectancy or screening rates for women at increased risk for breast cancer. Some guidelines 
recommend more frequent screening or the addition of other modes of screening for women 
at higher-than-average risk for breast cancer.37 Finally, our findings may not be 
generalizable to other preventive services or non–Medicare Advantage plans.
In conclusion, the elimination of cost sharing for screening mammography in Medicare 
Advantage plans was associated with increased use of this service among older women for 
whom screening is recommended. The increase was attenuated among women living in areas 
with lower educational attainment and was negligible among Hispanic women.

 Figure 1. Trends in Adjusted Rates of Biennial Screening Mammography in Intervention and 
Control Plans
Intervention plans were 24 Medicare Advantage plans that eliminated cost sharing for 
mammography, and control plans were 48 matched Medicare Advantage plans that 
maintained full coverage of mammography.

 Figure 2. Adjusted Difference-in-Differences Estimates for Rates of Biennial Screening 
Mammography across 24 Matched Groups of Intervention and Control Plans
Shown are point estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for adjusted 
difference-in-differences estimates (arranged in ascending order) comparing each 
intervention plan with the two matched control plans in the 2-year period before and the 2-
year period after the elimination of cost sharing. Values greater than zero (above the dashed 
line) indicate increases in screening mammography rates for the intervention plan as 
compared with the matched control plans.
