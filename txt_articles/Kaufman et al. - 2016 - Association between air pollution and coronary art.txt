 Background—Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter less than 2·5 μm in diameter 
(PM2·5) and traffic-related air pollutant concentrations are associated with cardiovascular risk. The 
disease process underlying these associations remains uncertain. We aim to assess association 
between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and progression of coronary artery calcium 
and common carotid artery intima-media thickness.
Methods—In this prospective 10-year cohort study, we repeatedly measured coronary artery 
calcium by CT in 6795 participants aged 45–84 years enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) in six metropolitan areas in the USA. Repeated 
scans were done for nearly all participants between 2002 and 2005, for a subset of participants 
between 2005 and 2007, and for half of all participants between 2010 and 2012. Common carotid 
artery intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasound in all participants at baseline and in 
2010–12 for 3459 participants. Residence-specific spatio-temporal pollution concentration models, 
incorporating community-specific measurements, agency monitoring data, and geographical 
predictors, estimated concentrations of PM2·5 and nitrogen oxides (NOX) between 1999 and 2012. 
The primary aim was to examine the association between both progression of coronary artery 
calcium and mean carotid artery intima-media thickness and long-term exposure to ambient air 
pollutant concentrations (PM2·5, NOX, and black carbon) between examinations and within the six 
metropolitan areas, adjusting for baseline age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, 
cardiovascular risk factors, site, and CT scanner technology.
Findings—In this population, coronary calcium increased on average by 24 Agatston units per 
year (SD 58), and intima-media thickness by 12 μm per year (10), before adjusting for risk factors 
or air pollutant exposures. Participant-specific pollutant concentrations averaged over the years 
2000–10 ranged from 9·2–22·6 μg PM2·5/m3 and 7·2–139·2 parts per billion (ppb) NOX. For each 
5 μg PM2·5/m3 increase, coronary calcium progressed by 4·1 Agatston units per year (95% CI 1·4–
6·8) and for each 40 ppb NOX coronary calcium progressed by 4·8 Agatston units per year (0·9–
8·7). Pollutant exposures were not associated with intima-media thickness change. The estimate 
for the effect of a 5 μg/m3 higher long-term exposure to PM2·5 in intima-media thickness was −0·9 
μm per year (95% CI −3·0 to 1·3). For 40 ppb higher NOX, the estimate was 0·2 μm per year (−1·9 
to 2·4).
Interpretation—Increased concentrations of PM2·5 and traffc-related air pollution within 
metropolitan areas, in ranges commonly encountered worldwide, are associated with progression 
in coronary calcification, consistent with acceleration of atherosclerosis. This study supports the 
case for global efforts of pollution reduction in prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
Funding—US Environmental Protection Agency and US National Institutes of Health.
Introduction
Particulate air pollution and traffic-related air pollutants are associated with overall 
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular disease events. In particular, long-
term exposure to high concentrations of air pollutants has been associated with risk of 
myocardial infarction and stroke.1 However, previous studies of cardiovascular disease and 
air pollution have had short follow-up duration, have often been limited by between-city 
exposure contrasts without precisely accounting for within-city variation, and have 
comprised secondary analyses of existing datasets collected to test other hypotheses.

 Furthermore, the underlying pathological process has not been well established, leaving the 
biological plausibility of these findings open to question.
To reduce uncertainties in the understanding of the potential health effects of ambient air 
pollutants, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supported an unprecedented 
effort to characterise pollutant exposures in participants of the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute's Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).2 The resultant study (the 
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution, [MESA Air])3 tested a priori the 
associations of air pollution concentrations, specifically particulate matter of less than 2·5 
μm in diameter (PM2·5), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and black carbon, with progression of 
subclinical arteriosclerosis. We report the association between long-term exposure to 
ambient air pollution and progression of coronary artery calcium and common carotid artery 
intima-media thickness.
Methods
Study design and participants
The designs of the MESA2 and MESA Air3 studies have been described previously. Briefly, 
MESA recruited a cohort of 6814 participants with no history of clinical cardiovascular 
disease from four ethnic groups (Hispanic, black, white, and Chinese), with sex balance and 
uniform age distribution (range 45–84 years at recruitment) in six areas of the USA: 
Baltimore, MD; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles County, CA; New York City, NY; St Paul, MN; 
and Winston-Salem, NC. Community-based strategies that varied by clinical centre were 
used to recruit participants. Recruitment and baseline examinations were done between July 
17, 2000, and Aug 29, 2002. Between Feb 22, 2005, and May 9, 2007, MESA Air recruited 
257 additional participants in Rockland County, NY (grouped as being from the same area 
as New York City, NY participants); Riverside County, CA (grouped as being from the same 
area as Los Angeles County, CA participants); and a coastal area of Los Angeles County, 
CA, to add heterogeneity in air pollution exposures. The study protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board at each of the six study centres, and participants provided written 
informed consent upon their arrival at the study clinic.
Procedures
All participants received CT scans at baseline to measure coronary artery calcium as 
previously described.4 Repeated scans were done for nearly all participants between 2002 
and 2005, for a subset of participants between 2005 and 2007, and for half of all participants 
between 2010 and 2012. CT technology differed between clinical centres and over time.5 A 
four-density calibration phantom was imaged with each scan to enhance comparability of 
images between scanners and to scale the voxels in each composite scan before the 
calculation of coronary artery calcium scores. Scans were scored in the Harbor-UCLA Los 
Angeles Biomedical Research Institute by the Agatston method.4
To measure the common carotid artery intima-media thickness, one ultrasound and 
transducer model (Logiq 700, M12L, GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA) were used 
at all sites in all examinations.6 Images were read by the University of Wisconsin Carotid

Exposure assessment
The MESA Air pollution measurement and modelling methods have been described 
previously.3,7,8 MESA Air measured ambient PM2·5, NOX, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and 
black carbon (assessed by light absorption) at 27 long-term sites, 771 community snapshot 
locations (simultaneous 2-week measurements collected on three occasions), and outside 
697 participants’ homes between 2005 and 2009 to sup ple ment measurements from 
Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System monitoring locations.
Participants reported all residential addresses from 1980 to 2012. Community-specific 
spatio-temporal models were developed to predict pollutant concentrations at participants’ 
residences for each fortnight from 1999 to 2012, with statistical methods to accommodate 
irregular monitoring data and incorporate all monitoring results. These models explained 
90–97% of the variation (model-fit R2) in measurements at participant homes. The cross-
validated R2 values (assessing out-of-sample validation) for predictions from the area-
specific models at residence locations varied by site. Median (range) R2 values for these 
models were 0·79 (0·54– 0·85) for PM2·5, 0·78 (0·45–0·90) for NO2, 0·72 (0·50–0·92) for 
NOX, and 0·67 (0·51–0·78) for black carbon. These R2 values at participants’ homes 
leverage temporal as well as spatial variability. R2 values from the cross-validation of the 
measured long-term fixed sites were similar.8
MESA Air participants completed detailed questionnaires at recruitment and after life 
changes, including moving homes. Examples of items queried included heating choices, air 
conditioner use, and window opening, and time spent indoors and outdoors, during summer 
and winter.9 Responses, meteorology, and an outdoor PM2·5 tracer (particulate sulphur 
assessed in concurrent samples inside and outside selected homes) were used to predict the 
fraction of ambient PM2·5 infiltrating homes.10 Indoor PM2·5 exposures were calculated as 
the predicted fortnight's outdoor PM2·5 concentration multiplied by the weather-specific and 
residence-specific infiltration fraction. An individually-weighted exposure to ambient-
derived PM2·5(PM2·5iwa) for each fortnight was calculated by time-weighting the outdoor 
concentration by time spent outdoors, and indoor exposure by time spent indoors.
Long-term exposures were the average of fortnightly residence-specific predictions from 
recruitment to follow-up for each examination. Year 2000 concentrations at the baseline 
address were used to model baseline cross-sectional relationships. Outdoor concentrations of 
black carbon were generated only for the years 2006–08 because comparable air quality 
system data were not available at other times (EPA's measurement method for black carbon 
was not comparable to the study-specific measurement method). Long-term black carbon 
averages were calculated by weighting the residence-specific 2006–08 means by the amount 
of time participants lived at each location between their examinations.

 Statistical analysis
The study was designed to be adequately powered to detect air pollutant effects of 2 
Agatston units per year or 7 μm per year intima-media thickness per 10 μg per m3 PM2·5, 
based on pollution contrasts observed between MESA communities before 2003.
The associations of progression of coronary artery calcium and mean intima-media thickness 
with long-term average outdoor pollutant concentrations (PM2·5, NOX, and black carbon) 
were the primary interests, with NO2 and ambient-derived PM2·5 assessed as secondary. The 
primary adjustment model included baseline age, sex, ethnicity, site, CT scanner type (in the 
coronary artery calcium analysis), body-mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking and 
second-hand smoke exposure (both time-varying), employment outside the home, total 
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, statin use (time-varying), 
neighbourhood socioeconomic index, level of education, income, and the interactions 
between these variables and study time. Participants were censored at the time of coronary 
revascularisation procedures for analysis of coronary artery calcium. Additional models 
incorporated information on blood pressure and diabetes.
A mixed model jointly analysed both the cross-sectional association between air pollution 
and the outcomes at baseline examination and the relationship between air pollution and the 
rate of progression.11 Repeated measurements were modelled as a function of study time, 
with time-varying exposures modelled as an interaction with time to obtain a rate. 
Participant-specific random intercepts and slopes were included, along with random 
intercepts for neighbourhood clusters. We investigated potential effect modification by sex, 
ethnicity, obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2 vs BMI ≥30 kg/m2), age category (10-year intervals), 
smoking status, hypertensive status, diabetes status, HDL cholesterol concentration (HDL 
cholesterol <1·03 mmol/L vs HDL cholesterol ≥1·04 mmol/L), total cholesterol (total <5·17 
mmol/L, total 5·17–6·21 mmol/L, or total >6·21 mmol/L), and LDL cholesterol 
concentration (LDL cholesterol <2·59 mmol/L, LDL cholesterol 2·59–3·36 mmol/L, LDL 
cholesterol 3·36–4·14 mmol/L, or LDL cholesterol >4·14 mmol/L). Evidence for effect modi 
fication was assessed by including three-way inter action terms between study time, the 
effect modifier, and air pollution concentration. A concentration-response curve was 
generated using a thin plate regression spline with five degrees of freedom for long-term 
average PM2·5 concentrations.
We also examined the relationship between pollutants and relative progression of coronary 
artery calcium, using a ln(Agatston score plus 25) transformation of the outcome.

 Results
Of the 7060 participants initially enrolled, 5834 underwent at least two examinations and 
had suffcient data to be included longitudinally in the analysis of coronary artery calcium. 
961 participants were included only at baseline. The mean age of the cohort at baseline was 
62 years (SD 10), and 3593 (53%) of the 6795 participants assessed were women. Overall, 
the cohort included 2678 (39%) white, 795 (12%) Chinese, 1824 (27%) black, and 1498 
(22%) Hispanic participants (table). The differences in population characteristics between 
sites, notably in ethnicity and level of education, reflect purposefully implemented sampling 
strategies; differences in smoking rates reflect community differences. Mean follow-up time 
for participants with at least two coronary artery calcium measurements was 6·2 years (SD 
3·5) and for those with intima-media thickness measurements from at least two timepoints 
was 9·2 years (1·8).
Figure 1 shows summary statistics of air pollutant concentrations in the year 2000 and over 
follow-up. Long-term average levels of pollution were lower than levels of pollution in 2000. 
Mean concentrations also varied between sites by pollutant, with PM2·5 concentrations being 
highest in Los Angeles County and lowest in St Paul, and NOX and NO2 being highest in 
New York City and lowest in Winston-Salem (figure 1). Figure 2 shows between-city and 
within-city exposure contrasts of concentrations of PM2·5 and NOX in 2005 (appendix p 11).
The mean progression rate over follow-up for coronary artery calcium was 24 Agatston units 
per year (SD 58) and for intima-media thickness was 12 μm per year (10); at baseline, 
coronary artery calcium scores were 145 Agatston units (407). Because the intima-media 
thickness analysis was restricted to participants who returned for ultrasound scans during the 
last examination, participants with intima-media thickness data were on average 2 years 
younger, more educated, and less likely to have diabetes than were those included in the 
coronary artery calcium analysis (appendix p 15).
In the primary analysis adjusted for potential confounders, a 5 μg/m3 higher PM2·5 
concentration was associated with 4·1 Agatston units per year (95% CI 1·4–6·8) increased 
rate of coronary artery calcium progression (figure 3). A 40 parts per billion (ppb) higher 
NOX concentration was associated with a 4·8 Agatston units per year (0·9–8·7) increased 
rate of coronary artery calcium progression, and a 10 ppb higher NO2 concentration was 
associated with 2·7 Agatston units per year (−0·3 to 5·7) increased rate of coronary artery 
calcium progression. Neither black carbon nor ambient-derived PM2·5 were associated with 
coronary artery calcium progression (0·1 Agatston units per year for a 0·5 μg/m3 higher 
black carbon concentration [−3·8 to 4·1] and 1·0 Agatston units per year for a 5 μg/m3 
higher ambient-derived PM2·5 exposure [−1·9 to 3·9]). Results were similar in models 
incorporating blood pressure and diabetes status.
Pollutant exposures were not associated with intima-media thickness change. The estimate 
for the effect of a 5 μg/m3 higher long-term exposure to PM2·5 in intima-media thickness 
was −0·9 μm per year (95% CI −3·0 to 1·3). For 40 ppb higher NOX, the estimate was 0·2 
μm per year (−1·9 to 2·4).

 Results for both outcomes were consistent in sensitivity analyses. The associations of PM2·5 
and NOX with coronary artery calcium progression were attenuated with widened 
confidence intervals if one was adjusted for the other. Exposure to outdoor PM2·5, NOX, 
NO2, and ambient-derived PM2·5 were all positively associated with relative coronary artery 
calcium progression (appendix p 13).
The concentration-response function between outdoor PM2·5 and coronary artery calcium 
progression concentration suggests attenuation of the association at higher concentrations 
(figure 3). Evidence for effect modification by several factors was weak and inconsistent 
between PM2·5 and NOX, although it suggested that the effects of exposures to these 
pollutants might be greater in older, non-obese, and hypertensive individuals (figure 4).
Discussion
In this multi-ethnic prospectively studied population, ambient concentrations of PM2·5 and 
NOX were strongly associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, as shown by assessment of 
coronary artery calcium over a 10-year period. Air pollution was not associated with 
progression of intima-media thickness. This study benefited from state-of-the-art exposure 
estimation at the time and location of each residence during follow-up and incorporated 
high-quality information about potential confounding factors, including time-varying 
covariates such as statin use. The cohort-focused air quality monitoring effort and spatio-
temporal modelling methods enabled us to generate individually resolved exposures and 
examine relationships between atherosclerosis progression and air pollution over time, using 
within-city contrasts with an unprecedented level of accuracy. These results provide 
important evidence that long-term exposure to these ambient air pollutants is associated with 
atherosclerosis progression in the coronary arteries and can explain previous findings that 
pollutants are associated with cardiovascular events and mortality.
Exposures during follow-up of this cohort were low by historical and international standards. 
The present US National Ambient Air Quality Standards12 permit annual average PM2·5 
concentrations of 12 μg/m3 and the European Union Air Quality Standards13 permit 25 
μg/m3, whereas the mean ambient PM2·5 concentration that participants in our study were 
exposed to over 2000–10 was 14·2 μg/m3 (range 9·2–22·6). The concentrations in rapidly 
industrialising countries are substantially higher.14
Calcified plaques in the coronary arteries have been consistently associated with 
cardiovascular disease in both clinical trials and observational research.15 Coronary artery 
calcium is a very strong risk marker of future ischaemic vascular events. Although most 
often studied as a one-time measure of atherosclerotic extent and plaque burden,16 change in 
coronary artery calcium also predicts subsequent ischaemic events.2 Risk factors that 
accelerate coronary artery calcium progression (including age, male sex, adiposity, systolic 
blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes) are also strong predictors of subsequent ischaemic 
events.17 Coronary artery calcium meas urements might represent more mature athero-
sclerotic lesions than forming or vulnerable plaques.18

 The association between coronary artery calcium progression and air pollution has not been 
reported, although the plausibility of a causal relationship between air pollution and 
atherosclerosis is suggested through several mechanisms.19 In a cross-sectional analysis in 
the the Heinz-Nixdorf Recall study,20 coronary artery calcium was higher in individuals 
living near roads than in those who did not live near major roads. Our findings provide 
evidence that exposure to air pollution is associated with coronary artery calcium 
progression.
Although coronary artery calcium progression was associated with PM2·5 and NOX, it was 
not associated with black carbon. Unlike the other pollutants, for which exposures were 
estimated between 1999 and 2012, black carbon exposures were limited to only spatial 
contrasts in 2006–08; hence, analyses could not capture the decreasing trends in pollutant 
concentrations recorded during follow-up.21 Additionally, coronary artery calcium 
progression was not as strongly associated with NO2 as it was with total NOX. The total 
NOX is highest in the most near-road environments (measured in previous research as 
proximity to a major roadway or time in traff c),22 and might better represent the group of 
primarily emitted traff c-related air pollutants present in these locations. Therefore, 
characterisation of NOX exposure might be a better way to capture the effects of the near-
road environment on health.
We noted a somewhat stronger association between PM2·5 and coronary artery calcium 
progression in hypertensive, in non-obese, and in individuals older than 65 years. The 
findings with age and hypertension suggest a synergistic association between air pollutants 
and these two strong risk factors for progression of atherosclerosis, though this association 
was not found for other strong risk factors such as diabetes or elevated cholesterol levels. 
The finding that pollutant associations with coronary artery calcium progression appeared 
stronger in non-obese participants is not what would be expected because inflammatory and 
metabolic consequences of obesity are thought to share mechanistic pathways with those of 
air pollutants.19 Although this study's sample size and precision provided adequate statistical 
power for the primary comparisons, analyses of effect modification were less well powered.
Our findings for the effect of pollutants on coronary artery calcium progression were robust 
to a variety of sensitivity analyses and did not differ depending on stages of control of 
potential confounding variables. This result strengthens our confidence in these associations. 
In addition, air pollutant relationships were recorded whether the outcome was measured as 
an absolute or relative change in calcification. Although absolute change in the extent of 
calcifications was our a-priori outcome choice, assessment of the outcome as a relative 
change did suggest additional associations with NO2 and ambient-derived PM2·5 that were 
not observed with the absolute change outcome.
An association between air pollution and progression of carotid wall thickness has been 
noted in some, but not all, previous studies.23,24 An interim analysis25 in MESA showed that 
exposure to a 2·5 μg/m3 higher PM2·5 concentration was associated with a 5 μm per year 
increase in intima-media thickness progression; the interim study used a different approach 
to image analysis, a less-developed approach to exposure estimation, and a much shorter 
period of follow-up. An observational study26 within clinical trial data showed associations

 between PM2·5 and intima-media thickness progression in some subgroups. Carotid wall 
thickness is a challenging outcome for observational studies because the change in intima-
media thickness over time is small relative to the measurement error at each timepoint. The 
mechanism by which air pollution might accelerate atherosclerosis might also be unrelated 
to intima-media thickness, which is a marker of arterial injury rather than atherosclerosis per 
se.27 Unlike coronary artery calcium, change over time in intima-media thickness is not 
predictive of subsequent cardiovascular disease events in observational studies, although it is 
a commonly used outcome in pharmaceutical studies.28,29 In MESA participants, coronary 
artery calcium has been a much stronger predictor of subsequent coronary heart disease 
events than intima-media thickness.30
The MESA cohort provides an extraordinarily well characterised population in terms of 
potential confounders of the relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular disease. 
Nevertheless, residual confounding by unmeasured factors remains a possibility. 
Additionally, though we chose a-priori exposures and outcomes of interest, the presence of 
more than one exposure and outcome in our analyses could be criticised for including 
multiple comparisons.
This study focused on the health effects of ambient-derived air pollutants on cardiovascular 
health. Our primary exposure metrics focused on concentrations of pollutants outside homes, 
although individuals spend time in specific micro-environments, including indoors. We 
developed the ambient-derived PM2·5 measure specifically to address this issue, to better 
characterise actual exposure to ambient PM2·5 by adjusting outdoor concentrations by time 
spent indoors and infiltration of particles into the home. Because these predictions represent 
the product of two different modifiers of outdoor concentration (each imperfectly assessed 
and not available for all study participants) we believe that the additional error in exposure 
estimation was the primary driver for the weak associations reported for ambient-derived 
PM2·5. Full characterisation of time–location patterns and indoor exposures is notoriously 
diff cult. Ascertainment of highly resolved, individualised micro-environmental exposure 
estimates over several years of follow-up is elusive, hence our primary exposure estimation 
approach relies on outdoor concentrations.
In conclusion, evidence from this study provides strong biological support for the 
observation that long-term exposures to outdoor particulate matter and traff c-related air 
pollution, specifically PM2·5 and NOX, are related to the development of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
At study launch, there was no literature on progression of atherosclerosis in relation to 
long-term exposure to air pollution; the study was in response to the US Environmental 
Protection Agency's Request For Applications for a prospective observational study of 
cardiovascular disease initiation and progression associated with long-term exposure to 
ambient particulate matter and other air pollutants in a population-based sample. 
Although previous research has been considered to be consistent with a causal 
relationship between particulate matter air pollution and ischaemic heart disease events 
and mortality, these studies had substantial limitations and biological plausibility has 
continued to be questioned. Previous studies have had short follow-up durations, little 
attention to fine-scale variation in pollutant exposure, and comprised secondary analyses 
of existing datasets collected to test other hypotheses.
Added value of this study
This study provides important new information about the underlying biological processes 
of long-term exposure to air pollutant concentrations and their association with 
cardiovascular disease, through repeated assessment of coronary artery calcification by 
CT (a surrogate of atherosclerosis extent) in a cohort and with an unprecedented effort to 
characterise air pollutant exposures. The study was specifically designed to address the 
hypothesis that air pollutants would be associated with progression in subclinical 
atherosclerosis.
Exposures assessed in this study are low and relevant for understanding the health effects 
of ambient environments occurring nowadays in high-income, low-income, and rapidly 
industrialising countries.
Implications of all the available evidence
Together with accumulating observational evidence of the relationship between ambient 
pollutants and cardiovascular disease events, this study substantially advances the case 
for global efforts to reduce exposures to ambient air pollutants.

 Figure 1. Long-term outdoor air pollutant concentrations by area
Pollutant concentrations are averaged over the time between the first and last CT scan, 
rounded to the nearest full year. Boxes cover the 25–75th percentile (IQR) with a centre line 
for the median concentration. Whiskers extend to the highest observation within 3 IQR of 
the box, with more extreme observations shown as points. Black carbon was measured by 
light absorption coeff cient, where 0·5 × 10−5 m−1 was approximately equivalent to 0·5 
μg/m3 of elemental carbon. PM2·5=fine particulate matter less than 2·5 μm in diameter. 
NOX=nitrogen oxides. NO2=nitrogen dioxide. ppb=parts per billion.

 Figure 3. Long-term average air pollutant concentrations and coronary artery calcium 
progression
(A) The linear longitudinal association of fine particulate matter (PM2·5), nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and black carbon, with coronary artery calcium progression 
(Agatston units per year), from linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, city, 
income, employment outside the home, smoking status, second-hand smoke exposure, 
physical activity, adiposity, cholesterol, statin use, neighbourhood socioeconomic index, 
income, education and scanner type. (B) The concentration-response curve with 95% CIs for 
the overall change in and coronary artery calcium (progression rate associated with long-
term average PM2·5 concentrations). The curve is based on a mixed model that includes a 
thin plate regression spline with five degrees of freedom to more flexibly assess the 
potentially non-linear association. The relationship at the extremes is less certain and might 
rely on concentrations that are recorded only in one geographical region; the highest and 
lowest 5% of overall concentrations have been trimmed for visualisation. The histogram at 
the bottom of the right panel shows the relative overall distribution of long-term PM2·5 
concentrations in the cohort, with different colours representing each clinic location. *Black 
carbon as measured by light absorption coefficient, where 0·5 × 10−5 m−1 is approximately 
equivalent to 0·5 μg/m3.
