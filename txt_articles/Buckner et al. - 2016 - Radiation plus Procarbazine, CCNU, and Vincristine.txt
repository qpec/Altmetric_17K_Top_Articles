Abstract
BACKGROUND—Grade 2 gliomas occur most commonly in young adults and cause progressive 
neurologic deterioration and premature death. Early results of this trial showed that treatment with 
procarbazine, lomustine (also called CCNU), and vincristine after radiation therapy at the time of 
initial diagnosis resulted in longer progression-free survival, but not overall survival, than radiation 
therapy alone. We now report the long-term results.
METHODS—We included patients with grade 2 astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, or 
oligodendroglioma who were younger than 40 years of age and had undergone subtotal resection 
or biopsy or who were 40 years of age or older and had undergone biopsy or resection of any of 
the tumor. Patients were stratified according to age, histologic findings, Karnofsky performance-
status score, and presence or absence of contrast enhancement on preoperative images. Patients 
were randomly assigned to radiation therapy alone or to radiation therapy followed by six cycles 
of combination chemotherapy.
RESULTS—A total of 251 eligible patients were enrolled from 1998 through 2002. The median 
follow-up was 11.9 years; 55% of the patients died. Patients who received radiation therapy plus

 chemotherapy had longer median overall survival than did those who received radiation therapy 
alone (13.3 vs. 7.8 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; P=0.003). The rate of progression-free 
survival at 10 years was 51% in the group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy 
versus 21% in the group that received radiation therapy alone; the corresponding rates of overall 
survival at 10 years were 60% and 40%. A Cox model identified receipt of radiation therapy plus 
chemotherapy and histologic findings of oligodendroglioma as favorable prognostic variables for 
both progression-free and overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS—In a cohort of patients with grade 2 glioma who were younger than 40 years 
of age and had undergone subtotal tumor resection or who were 40 years of age or older, 
progression-free survival and overall survival were longer among those who received combination 
chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy than among those who received radiation therapy 
alone. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT00003375.)
Grade 2 gliomas are relatively uncommon, constituting 5 to 10% of all primary brain tumors 
in adults. Progressive neurologic symptoms eventually develop in nearly all patients, and 
nearly all patients die prematurely. At the time of the initiation of our trial, studies had 
shown that chemotherapy caused tumor regressions in patients with recurrent low-grade 
gliomas, with regimens that included procarbazine, lomustine (also called CCNU), and 
vincristine,1 carmustine (also called BCNU) plus interferon,2 and mechlorethamine, 
vincristine, and procarbazine.3 Similarly, the combination of procarbazine, CCNU, and 
vincristine, when administered as initial therapy, has been shown to result in tumor 
regressions.4–6
The initial report that provided the efficacy analysis as specified in the protocol was 
published in 2012.7 (The protocol is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) 
At the time of that analysis, 38% of the patients had died, with a median follow-up time of 
5.9 years. Here we report the results of a phase 3 trial with long-term follow-up.
METHODS
TRIAL OVERSIGHT

an institutional review board, and each patient provided written informed consent. The 
principal investigators listed in the protocol were responsible for the design and oversight of 
the trial and for the development of the protocol. The NRG Oncology Statistics and Data 
Center was responsible for the collection and maintenance of the data. The confidentiality of 
the data is governed by the policy of the National Institutes of Health. There were no 
commercial sponsors of this trial. All the authors participated in the analysis of the data, the

 KEY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Patients were eligible for this trial if they had supratentorial grade 2 astrocytoma, 
oligodendroglioma, or oligoastrocytoma that was histologically confirmed on pathological 
review by a central laboratory before randomization. Patients who were 18 to 39 years of 
age were eligible if they had undergone a subtotal resection or biopsy, and those who were 
40 years of age or older were eligible if they had undergone biopsy or resection of any of the 
tumor. All the patients had to have a Karnofsky performance-status score of 60 or more (on a 
scale from 0 to 100, with lower numbers indicating greater disability) and a neurologic-
function score of 3 or less (on a scale from 0 to 5, with lower numbers indicating better 
neurologic function) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). 
Patients were excluded from trial participation if they had tumor that had spread to 
noncontiguous leptomeninges, if they had gliomatosis cerebri, if they had had synchronous 
cancer within the previous 5 years (except for in situ cervical carcinoma or nonmelanoma 
skin cancer), if they had received prior radiation therapy to the brain or head and neck 
region, if they had received prior chemotherapy for any reason, if they had chronic lung 
disease (unless pulmonary-function tests revealed a carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of 
60% or more of the predicted value), if they had active infection, or if they were pregnant, 
breast-feeding, or unable or unwilling to consider the use of effective contraception during 
treatment.
TREATMENT
The radiation dose was 54 Gy, administered in 30 fractions of 1.8 Gy each (prescribed to the 
isocenter) over a period of 6 weeks. The radiation volume was defined according to the 
abnormality on the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal, including any 
surgical defect. Patients who had been randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy received 
the treatment after they completed radiation therapy. Chemotherapy consisted of six cycles 
of procarbazine (at a dose of 60 mg per square meter of body-surface area orally per day on 
days 8 through 21 of each cycle), CCNU (at a dose of 110 mg per square meter orally on day 
1 of each cycle), and vincristine (at a dose of 1.4 mg per square meter [maximum dose, 2.0 
mg] administered intravenously on days 8 and 29 of each cycle). The cycle length was 8 
weeks.
EVALUATION AND FOLLOW-UP OF THE PATIENTS
A pathological review of all tumor samples was performed at a central laboratory before the 
initiation of treatment; tumor blocks, cores, or slides were requested for correlative 
laboratory studies. Patients underwent a Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) as well as 
preoperative and postoperative MRIs that were performed with and without the use of 
contrast material. MRIs and the MMSE were repeated before cycles three and five, after the 
completion of therapy, and then every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and 
every year thereafter until tumor progression.
LABORATORY METHODS
To determine IDH1 mutational status, we performed immunohistochemical testing with the 
mutation-specific monoclonal antibody IDH1 R132H (Dianova; dilution, 1:50) for 30

 minutes at room temperature. All immunostaining was performed with the use of a Bond RX 
autostainer and included the Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (for 20 minutes) and the 
Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (all from Leica Biosystems). Immunoreaction was 
scored as positive when tumor cells showed cytoplasmic staining for IDH1 R132H mutation. 
Staining of macrophages was not scored as positive.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In the initial analysis,7 overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated with the 
use of the Kaplan–Meier method,8 and differences between treatment groups were tested 
with the use of the modified Wilcoxon test,9 as specified in the protocol. In this exploratory 
analysis with long-term follow-up, overall survival and progression-free survival were 
assessed with the use of the log-rank test, which has the ability to consider late separation in 
the survival curves.10
Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death or the last 
follow-up date on which the patient was reported to be alive. Progression-free survival was 
measured from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death or the 
last follow-up date on which the patient was reported to be alive. Patients who did not 
receive treatment according to the protocol or who discontinued treatment were followed 
until death. Patients who were lost to follow-up had their data censored on the last date of 
contact.
Cox proportional-hazards models11 were used to assess the effect of treatment, histologic 
findings, age, sex, IDH1 R132H mutation status, Karnofsky performance-status score, 
contrast enhancement, and extent of surgery on progression-free survival and overall 
survival. Since the proportionality assumption of the Cox proportional-hazards model is not 
reasonable for both progression-free survival and overall survival, a time-varying treatment 
effect was added to the models. The cutoff point for this effect was chosen to be 1 year on 
the basis of the largest log (partial) likelihood. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
determine the effect that patients who were lost to follow-up had on the treatment effect for 
overall survival.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS
Between October 31, 1998, and June 27, 2002, a total of 254 patients underwent 
randomization; 128 patients were assigned to radiation therapy alone, and 126 to radiation 
therapy plus combination chemotherapy with procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine. Two 
patients in the group that received radiation therapy alone were found to be ineligible (in 1 
patient, pathological review was not performed before randomization, and in another patient, 
results from the pathological review did not meet the criteria for eligibility), and 1 patient in 
the group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy was found to be ineligible (no 
postoperative MRI was available). The 251 remaining patients had data that could be 
evaluated for treatment outcomes and toxic effects.

 The median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 11.9 years; at the time of analysis, 
67% of the enrolled patients had had tumor progression, and 55% had died (Fig. 1). As 
summarized in Table 1, patients in the two groups were balanced with regard to previously 
verified prognostic variables, including age, Karnofsky performance-status score, neurologic 
function, MMSE score, extent of surgery (as assessed by the operating neurosurgeon), 
histologic findings, and IDH1 R132H mutation status.
TREATMENT DELIVERED
In the group that received radiation therapy alone, 98% of the patients received it per 
protocol or with an acceptable variation. In the group that received radiation therapy plus 
chemotherapy, 93% of the patients received radiation therapy per protocol or with an 
acceptable variation and 56% received chemotherapy per protocol. The median number of 
chemotherapy treatment cycles was three for procarbazine, four for CCNU, and four for 
vincristine.
IDH1 MUTATION AND 1P/19Q CODELETION
Tumor blocks, cores, or slides were submitted for 117 patients and were suitable for IDH1 
R132H immunohistochemical interpretation for 113 (57 of 126 patients [45%] in the group 
that received radiation therapy alone and 56 of 125 [45%] in the group that received 
radiation therapy plus chemotherapy). IDH1 R132H mutations were detected in 35 of 57 
patients (61%) in the group that received radiation therapy alone and in 36 of 56 (64%) in 
the group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy (Table 1). IDH1 R132H 
mutations were detected in 78% of patients with oligodendroglioma, 54% of those with 
oligoastrocytoma, and 48% of those with astrocytoma (Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Tissue that was sufficient for the determination of other IDH mutations or the 
codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) was available for analysis in 
63 patients (29 patients in the group that received radiation therapy alone and 34 in the 
group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy). Because the number of samples 
and events in each subgroup was so small, reliable assessment could not be made of the 
effect of these molecular markers on outcomes.
PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL
Consistent with what was noted in the previous report,7 patients receiving radiation therapy 
plus chemotherapy had longer progression-free survival than did those who received 
radiation therapy alone (Fig. 2A). The median progression-free survival was 10.4 years 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1 to not reached) among patients in the group that received 
radiation therapy plus chemotherapy versus 4.0 years (95% CI, 3.1 to 5.5) among those who 
received radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 
P<0.001). The rate of progression-free survival at 5 years was 61% (95% CI, 53 to 70) 
among patients who received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy versus 44% (95% CI, 35 
to 53) among those who received radiation therapy alone; the corresponding rates at 10 years 
were 51% (95% CI, 42 to 59) versus 21% (95% CI, 14 to 28). There did not appear to be a 
between-group difference in progression-free survival during the first 2 years after 
randomization; however, the difference became apparent after approximately 25% of 
patients had disease progression, and the difference continued to increase over time.

 In an exploratory analysis of progression-free survival according to individual histologic 
type, patients who received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy had apparently longer 
progression-free survival than did patients who received radiation therapy alone, regardless 
of histologic type (Fig. 2B, 2C, and 2D). In a second exploratory subgroup analysis of 
progression-free survival according to IDH1 R132H mutation status, patients with tumoral 
IDH1 R132H mutations had significantly longer progression-free survival than did those 
without the mutation (P = 0.003) (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix), regardless of 
treatment. Among patients with tumoral IDH1 R132H mutations, those in the group that 
received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy had longer progression-free survival than did 
those who received radiation therapy alone (P<0.001) (Fig. 2E). The number of events 
among patients without the IDH1 R132H mutation was too small to determine an 
association with treatment effect in this subgroup.
In a multivariable analysis of progression-free survival at 1 year of follow-up, the following 
were identified as favorable prognostic variables: radiation therapy plus chemotherapy 
(hazard ratio for the comparison with radiation therapy alone, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.45; 
P<0.001), histopathological findings of oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio for the comparison 
with oligoastrocytoma, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.98; P = 0.04; hazard ratio for the comparison 
with astrocytoma, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.95; P = 0.04), and IDH1 R132H mutation (hazard 
ratio for the comparison with no IDH1 R132H mutation, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.93; P = 
0.02) (Table S3A in the Supplementary Appendix). IDH1 R132H mutation was identified as 
an independent prognostic variable.
OVERALL SURVIVAL
In contrast to outcomes reported previously,7 in the analysis with additional follow-up, 
patients who received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy had longer overall survival than 
did those who received radiation therapy alone (Fig. 3A). The median overall survival was 
13.3 years (95% CI, 10.6 to not reached) with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy versus 
7.8 years (95% CI, 6.1 to 9.8) with radiation therapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.59; P = 
0.003). The rate of overall survival at 5 years was 72% (95% CI, 64 to 80) in the group that 
received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy versus 63% (95% CI, 55 to 72) in the group 
that received radiation therapy alone. The corresponding rates at 10 years were 60% (95% 
CI, 51 to 69) and 40% (95% CI, 31 to 49). Similar to the distributions for progression-free 
survival, the distributions for overall survival did not begin to show clear differences 
between the treatment groups until approximately 4 years after randomization, by which 
time approximately 25% of the patients had died. Thereafter, the survival distributions 
continued to diverge in favor of the group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy 
(Fig. 3A).
The significant treatment effect was maintained in a sensitivity analysis that categorized all 
the patients in the two groups who were lost to follow-up as having died (hazard ratio for 
death in the group that received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy, 0.72; P = 0.03). 
However, the significant treatment effect was not maintained in a sensitivity analysis in 
which only patients who received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy and were lost to 
follow-up were categorized as having died and the patients in the group that received

 radiation therapy alone had their data censored (hazard ratio, 0.85; P = 0.32). The significant 
treatment effect was maintained in an analysis that balanced the number of patients who 
were lost to follow-up in the groups (so that each group would have the same number of 
patients lost to follow-up) by changing the status of 12 patients in the group that received 
radiation therapy plus chemotherapy and were lost to follow-up to the status of having died 
(hazard ratio, 0.68; P = 0.02) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In an exploratory analysis of overall survival according to individual histologic type, the 
superiority of radiation therapy plus chemotherapy over radiation therapy alone was seen 
with all histologic diagnoses, although the difference did not reach significance among 
patients with astrocytoma (Fig. 3B, 3C, and 3D). In a second exploratory subgroup analysis 
of overall survival according to IDH1 R132H mutation status, patients with tumoral IDH1 
R132H mutations had significantly longer overall survival than did those without the 
mutation, regardless of treatment (P=0.02). The median survival was 13.1 years (95% CI, 
10.1 to not reached) among patients with the mutation versus 5.1 years (95% CI, 1.9 to 11.5) 
among those without the mutation (Fig. S1B in the Supplementary Appendix). Among 
patients with tumoral IDH1 R132H mutations, those who received radiation therapy plus 
chemotherapy had longer overall survival than did those who received radiation therapy 
alone (P = 0.02) (Fig. 3E). The number of events among patients without the IDH1 R132H 
mutation was too small to determine the association of treatment effect in this subgroup.
Multivariable analyses of overall survival revealed the following favorable prognostic 
variables: radiation therapy plus chemotherapy after 1 year of follow-up (hazard ratio for 
death for the comparison with radiation therapy alone, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.66; P = 
0.001), histologic findings of oligodendroglioma (hazard ratio for the comparison with 
oligoastrocytoma, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.66; P = 0.001; hazard ratio for the comparison 
with astrocytoma, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.81; P = 0.01), and age of less than 40 years 
(hazard ratio for the comparison with age of ≥40 years, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.87; P=0.01) 
(Table S3B in the Supplementary Appendix). IDH1 R132H mutation was forced into the 
model, but the results were not significant (hazard ratio for the comparison with no 
mutation, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.12; P=0.12).
TREATMENT AFTER DISEASE PROGRESSION
In conjunction with other data items collected after disease progression, treatment after 
disease progression was reported prospectively. More patients who received radiation 
therapy alone than patients who received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy underwent 
surgery or reirradiation or received chemotherapy after tumor progression (Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
TOXIC EFFECTS AND MMSE RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes toxic effects according to treatment group. The most common 
symptomatic toxic effects were fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, which were 
primarily of grade 1 or 2. Three patients required red-cell transfusions, and one required 
platelet transfusions. There was one case of neutropenic fever. All these events occurred in 
Buckner et al.

 patients who were treated with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy. There were no grade 5 
toxic effects or reports of myelodysplasia or leukemia.
Late events that were attributed to radiation therapy, as assessed by the Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group (RTOG)–European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix),12 occurred in 245 patients and included toxic effects in the brain in 54 patients 
(22%): grade 1 events in 38 patients (15%), grade 2 events in 14 (6%), grade 3 events in 1 
(<1%), and grade 4 events in 1 (<1%).
Changes in cognitive status, as measured by the MMSE, have been reported in detail 
previously.13 As compared with their baseline score, patients treated either with radiation 
therapy alone or with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy had a significantly higher average 
MMSE score during the first 5 years after randomization. No MMSE data were collected 
after 5 years.
DISCUSSION
This phase 3 trial showed a survival benefit among patients with grade 2 glioma who were 
treated with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy, as compared with those who received 
radiation therapy alone. The treatment effect appeared to be largest in patients with 
oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma and in patients with IDH1 R132H mutations. The 
differences in survival cannot be explained on the basis of treatment after tumor progression 
because patients who received radiation therapy alone had a shorter time to progression and 
more therapeutic interventions after progression than did those who received radiation 
therapy plus chemotherapy.
The separation of the progression-free survival curves of the two treatment groups did not 
begin until 2 to 3 years after randomization, although approximately 25% of the patients in 
each group had disease progression by then. The differences in outcomes became apparent, 
as shown by the separation of the progression-free survival curves and the overall survival 
curves, within each histologic diagnosis category after approximately 15% of patients with 
oligodendroglioma and approximately 30% of those with either oligoastrocytoma or 
astrocytoma had disease progression. There was also a delay in the separation of the 
progression-free survival curves among patients with IDH1 R132H mutations; the same 
trend of delayed separation was apparent in the overall survival curves. If radiation therapy 
plus chemotherapy is effective in all patients, we would expect the curves to begin 
separation much sooner.
In two recently updated phase 3 trials (R940214 and EORTC 2695115), both of which 
compared radiation therapy alone with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy in patients with 
newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma, patients whose tumors had 1p/19q 
codeletion, IDH mutations, or both had longer progression-free survival and longer overall 
survival with radiation therapy plus chemotherapy than with radiation therapy alone. In 
patients with tumors with neither alteration, there was no significant difference in outcomes 
between the two treatment groups. However, even in patients with 1p/19q codeletion or IDH

 mutations, the separation of the progression-free survival curves did not begin until 
approximately 25% of the events had occurred. Although it is apparent that the patients in 
the current trial who had IDH1 R132H tumoral mutations also benefited from radiation 
therapy plus chemotherapy, we cannot determine whether radiation therapy plus 
chemotherapy was beneficial for patients with wild-type tumoral IDH because of the small 
number of events in these patients.
A previous retrospective analysis involving patients with low-grade oligodendrogliomas who 
were treated in clinical trials showed longer survival among patients whose tumors had 
1p/19q codeletion than among those whose tumors did not have 1p/19q codeletion.16 Since 
IDH mutations are associated with the CPG island methylator phenotype, and since most 
tumors with 1p/19q codeletions also have IDH mutations, it is plausible that DNA-repair 
enzymes that repair alkylator damage, such as O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase, 
are silenced by promotor methylation, which results in greater sensitivity to alkylating 
agents.
As expected, the frequency and severity of toxic effects were greater in the group that 
received radiation therapy plus chemotherapy than in the group that received radiation 
therapy alone. Most toxic effects were of grade 1 or 2; toxic effects of grade 3 or 4 were 
uncommon, except for neutropenia, and were consistent with the toxic effects of other 
multiagent chemotherapy regimens that have been administered to patients with other 
cancers. In this trial, which used the RTOG–EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring 
Scheme,12 late toxic effects in the central nervous system were reported in 22% of the 
patients, including grade 1 (mild) events in 15% and grade 2 (moderate) events in 6%. Late 
toxic effects in the central nervous system that were of grade 3 or 4 were reported in less 
than 1% of the patients. MMSE scores at 5 years after treatment were as likely to show 
improvement after treatment as decline.13
Although there appears to be a small cohort of patients with grade 2 glioma who do not 
benefit from radiation therapy plus chemotherapy, the identification of those patients 
remains elusive. The magnitude of treatment benefit from combined chemotherapy plus 
radiation therapy is substantial, but the toxic effects are greater than those observed with 
radiation therapy alone. Patients and their physicians will have to weigh whether the longer 
survival justifies the more toxic therapeutic approach.

 Figure 2. Progression-free Survival, According to Treatment Group
All hazard ratios for the comparison of radiation therapy alone (RT) or radiation therapy plus 
PCV in the analyses of progression-free survival are for disease progression or death, and all 
P values are two-sided. Tick marks indicate censored data. There were too few events among 
patients without the R132H mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1)to assess 
the association with treatment.

*There were no significant between-group differences at baseline. IDH1 denotes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene, and PCV procarbazine, 
lomustine (also called CCNU), and vincristine.
†Race or ethnic group was self-reported.
‡Karnofsky performance-status scores range from 0 to 100, with lower numbers indicating greater disability.
§Scores on the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) range from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating poor cognitive performance. Scores of 27 
to 30 are considered to be in the normal range; a score of less than 27 is considered to be abnormal.
