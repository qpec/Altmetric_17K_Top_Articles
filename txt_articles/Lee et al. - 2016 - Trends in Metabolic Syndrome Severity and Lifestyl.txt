Trends in Metabolic Syndrome 
Severity and Lifestyle Factors 
Among Adolescents

abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Childhood metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a risk factor for adverse 
outcomes later in life. Our goal was to identify temporal trends among US adolescents in the 
severity of MetS, its individual components, and factors related to diet and physical activity.
METHODS: We analyzed 5117 participants aged 12 to 19 from NHANES. We used regression 
analysis of individual waves of data, 1999 to 2012. MetS severity was calculated using a 
gender- and race/ethnicity-specific MetS severity z score.
RESULTS: There was a linear trend of decreasing MetS severity in US adolescents from 1999 
to 2012 (P = .030). This occurred despite a trend of increasing BMI z score (P = .005); 
instead, the decrease in MetS severity appeared to be due to trends in increasing high-
density lipoprotein (HDL; P < .0001) and decreasing triglyceride (P = .0001) levels. In 
considering lifestyle factors, there was no change in physical activity over the time period. 
Regarding dietary patterns, total calorie consumption and carbohydrate consumption were 
positively associated with triglyceride levels and negatively associated with HDL levels, 
whereas unsaturated fat consumption exhibited the opposite associations. Consistent 
with these associations, there was a trend of decreasing total calorie consumption 
(P < .0001), decreasing carbohydrate consumption (P < .0001), and increasing 
unsaturated fat consumption (P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: The healthier trend of declining MetS severity in adolescents appeared to be due 
to favorable increases in HDL and decreases in fasting triglyceride measurements. These 
were in turn associated with favorable changes in dietary patterns among US adolescents. 
Future studies should investigate the causality of dietary differences on changes in MetS 
severity in adolescents.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The prevalence 
of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently 
appeared to be decreasing in adults. There has been 
a plateauing of obesity in adolescents, but temporal 
trends of the MetS prevalence and severity in this 
age range are unclear.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The severity of MetS 
decreased in adolescents from 1999 to 2012 because 
of decreases in abnormalities in high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Over 
the same time frame, there were improvements 
in dietary intake, potentially related to these 
improvements.

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is 
characterized by central obesity, 
high fasting glucose, high fasting 
triglycerides, high blood pressure 
(BP), and low high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL). Traditional 
MetS criteria, such as those 
developed for adults by the National 
Cholesterol Education Program 
Adult Treatment Panel (ATP-III)1 or 
adolescent adaptations,2 define MetS 
diagnosis as presence of at least 3 
abnormalities among these 5 clinical 
components. MetS is a priority to 
characterize because it is a significant 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM).3–7
However, the binary nature of the 
ATP-III MetS diagnostic criteria has 
limitations in epidemiologic studies. 
The ATP-III criteria give no indication 
of disease severity, limiting their 
ability to track MetS severity over 
time.8 The ATP-III criteria also 
do not account for differences in 
MetS by race/ethnicity and gender, 
resulting in MetS underdiagnosis in 
specific groups, such as non-Hispanic 
blacks.9–14 This is a concern because 
non-Hispanic-black individuals 
have higher rates of T2DM and CVD 
despite low rates of ATP-III MetS 
diagnosis.15–19
The recently developed MetS Severity 
Score (MetS z score) calculator 
addresses the epidemiologic 
limitations of the ATP-III criteria.20,21 
This tool accounts for differences in 
MetS by race/ethnicity and gender. 
It is reflective of severity, with a 
higher score correlating to more 
severe MetS and increased odds for 
associated risk factors.20,21 Childhood 
MetS z score elevations are 
associated with risk for adult T2DM 
and CVD.22,23
Recent reports have shown a 
decrease in the prevalence of 
MetS among US adults, attributed 
to increased awareness and 
pharmaceutical treatment of the 
individual components of MetS.24,25 
The goal of the current study was 
to investigate for trends in MetS 
prevalence (by using modified ATP-
III criteria) and severity (using MetS 
z scores20) in US adolescents. Our 
hypothesis was that the decreasing 
trends observed in adults would 
not be observed in US adolescents 
because of the persisting childhood 
obesity epidemic.26,27 Our secondary 
goal was to evaluate for trends in 
physical activity and overall dietary 
factors that may be related to any 
changes in MetS. These studies may 
help gauge how the United States is 
responding to childhood MetS.
METHODS
We examined participant data from 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) NHANES (1999–
2012). NHANES is a cross-sectional, 
national, stratified, multistage 
probability survey conducted in 
2-year waves with randomly selected 
noninstitutionalized US civilians. 
NHANES oversampled racial/ethnic 
minority groups as well as those at 
or below 130% of the federal poverty 
level. Calculated sample weights 
accounted for this oversampling 
as well as different response rates 
among groups to ensure nationally 
representative estimates. This 
study was approved by the National 
Center for Health Statistics ethics 
review board. Participants provided 
informed consent. Laboratory and 
clinical measurements were obtained 
by using controlled equipment 
and protocols.24,28,29 Fasting blood 
samples were obtained from 
participants who attended morning 
sessions at CDC NHANES mobile 
examination centers. HDL was 
measured by direct immunoassay. 
Fasting glucose was measured by 
using an enzyme hexokinase method. 
Triglycerides were measured by 
using a timed-end point method. BMI 
z scores were calculated according to 
the US CDC 2000 growth reference 
adjusting for age and gender.30 High 
BP was defined as systolic or diastolic 
BP exceeding the 90th percentile for 
gender, age, and height.31
We examined data from 5117 
adolescents aged 12 to 19 with 
complete data regarding MetS and 
not meeting exclusion criteria. 
Participants were excluded for the 
following conditions that may affect 
participants’ laboratory measures 
in a way that is unlikely to be 
associated with the lifestyle factors 
we were evaluating: nonfasting 
status, pregnancy, active hepatitis B 
infection (n = 8), physician-diagnosed 
diabetes (n = 66), or current use of 
antidiabetic or antihyperlipidemic 
medication (n = 42). Participants 
taking antihypertensives were 
classified as having elevated BP (n = 
69).
There are no official criteria for 
evaluating MetS in children and 
adolescents. Multiple sets of criteria 
have been proposed and used.32,33 
We elected to use the adolescent 
adaptation of the ATP-III criteria 
because these are based on the NCEP 
ATP-III definition of MetS in adults.1 
MetS was defined as having at least 3 
of the following: BMI z score ≥1.645, 
fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL, fasting 
triglycerides ≥110 mg/dL, HDL ≤40 
mg/dL, and systolic or diastolic BP 
exceeding the 90th percentile for 
height, age, and gender.2
MetS severity was calculated by using 
the Pediatric MetS z Score (http:// 
mets. 
health- 
outcomes- 
policy. 
ufl. 
edu/ 
calculator).20 This set of scores 
was formulated previously by using 
data from non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic 
adolescents aged 12 to 19 years 
participating in NHANES 1999 to 
2010. We used confirmatory factor 
analysis on individual gender- and 
racial/ethnic group, generating 
equations to calculate a z score 
estimating the severity of MetS. 
These scores thus use the same 
clinical measurements as the ATP-III 
criteria, but with race/ethnicity- and 
gender-specific loading factors to 
account for the unequal contributions

to MetS of each clinical factor across 
different groups.20 These scores 
highly correlate with other surrogate 
markers of MetS risk, including 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 
uric acid, and the homeostasis 
model of insulin resistance.20,21 In a 
longitudinal study of 629 children 
and adolescents followed into 
adulthood, MetS z score correlated 
with 27- and 37-year later risk of 
developing CVD and T2DM.22,23
Dietary intake was determined from 
a 24-hour food recall administered 
by a trained dietary interviewer by 
using a 4-step multipass approach 
in the mobile examination center on 
the examination day. Interview data 
were processed and coded based 
on individual foods and portion 
sizes to determine specific nutrient 
intake based on US Department 
of Agriculture’s National Nutrient 
Database for Standard Reference.34 
Specific food group consumption was 
reported as percentage of calories 
accounted by specific food group.29 
The equations were as follows: % 
total energy from carbohydrates = 
(4 * grams of carbohydrates)/total 
calories, % total energy from fats = (9 
* grams of fat)/total calories, % total 
energy from protein = (7 * grams of 
protein)/total calories.
From 2007 to 2012, physical 
activity was assessed as minutes 
per week of moderate to vigorous 
physical recreational activity 
per day. Participants were first 
asked if they did any vigorous/
moderate-intensity sports, fitness, 
or recreational activities that cause 
large increase in breathing or heart 
rate, such as running or basketball 
for at least 10 minutes continuously. 
If they answered yes, they were 
further questioned for how many 
minutes per typical day they do these 
activities.
Statistical significance was defined 
as P < .05. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SAS (version 9.4, 
Cary, NC). SAS survey procedures 
were used to account for the 
complex survey design to obtain 
population-based estimates. Linear 
regression was used to estimate 
means of quantitative measurements 
across each NHANES period and 
assess for temporal linear trends. 
Fasting plasma triglyceride data 
were log transformed for regression 
analysis and back-transformed for 
data presentation. Temporal linear 
trends in prevalence of clinical 
abnormalities were assessed with 
logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS
Prevalence and Trends in MetS
We analyzed data from 5117 
adolescents with complete MetS 
data, including 1490 non-Hispanic 
whites, 1655 non-Hispanic blacks, 
and 2018 Hispanics (Table 1). The 
overall prevalence of ATP-III MetS 
in this time period was 9.83%. This 
overall prevalence varied by gender 
(males 10.90%, females 6.29%, P < 
.0001) and race/ethnicity (Hispanics 
9.97%, non-Hispanic whites 9.04%, 
and non-Hispanic blacks 4.45%, P < 
.0001).
Overall mean (SD) MetS z score in 
this time period was –0.05 (0.02). 
Mean MetS z score varied by race: 
Hispanics 0.04 (0.03), non-Hispanic 
whites –0.04 (0.02), and non-
Hispanic blacks –0.19 (0.03).
Tables 2 and 3 and Fig 1 display 
overall temporal trends in MetS 
and its individual components, 
along with variations by gender 
and race/ethnicity. Overall, there 
were temporal trends of decreasing 
MetS z score (P = .030) and fasting 
triglyceride measurements (P = 
.0001). There were further temporal 
trends of increasing BMI z score (P 
= .005) and HDL levels (P < .0001). 
There were no significant trends in 
overall fasting glucose and mean 
systolic BP measurements. There 
were no associated trends in the 
prevalence of ATP-III MetS and 
obesity. There were decreasing 
trends in the proportion of children 
with high fasting triglycerides (P < 
.0013) and low HDL prevalence (P < 
.0001).
In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated 
the linear regression analyses 
assessing trends in MetS z score and 
the laboratory values versus time in 
a sample that included adolescents 
with diagnosed diabetes or taking 
antidiabetic or antihyperlipidemic 
agents. There were no significant 
differences with the previous 
analyses when these previously 
excluded adolescents were included 
(data not shown).

Lifestyle Trends Among US 
Adolescents
Given the changes in fasting 
triglycerides, HDL, BMI z score, 
and improvements in overall MetS 
severity among adolescents, we next 
evaluated for potentially related 
trends in dietary intake and physical 
activity.
Overall temporal trends in calorie 
consumption and food group intake 
and their variations by gender and 
race/ethnicity are reported in Table 
4 and Fig 2. Overall, there were 
temporal trends of decreasing total 
calorie consumption, decreasing 
carbohydrate consumption, 
and increasing unsaturated fat 
consumption.
Mean calorie consumption was 
positively associated with fasting 
triglyceride levels (P = .003) and 
inversely associated with BMI z score 
(P < .0001) and HDL (P = .0009).
Carbohydrate intake was directly 
associated with fasting triglyceride 
levels (P = .0004) and inversely 
associated with HDL levels (P < 
.0001). There was no association 
between carbohydrate intake and 
BMI z score.
Unsaturated fat intake was inversely 
associated with fasting triglyceride 
levels (P < .0001) and directly 
associated with HDL levels (P < 
.0001). There was no association 
between unsaturated fat intake and 
BMI z score.
Percentage of total calories from 
saturated fats did not change over 
time (data not shown). Saturated fat 
intake was directly associated with 
HDL levels (P = .015). There was no 
association between saturated fat 
intake and fasting triglyceride levels 
or BMI z score.
Percentage of total calories from 
protein was 13.2% in 1999–2000 
and 14.7% 2011–2012, representing 
a significant increasing trend over 
time (P < .0001). Protein intake was 
directly associated with BMI z score 
(P = .005). There was no association 
between protein intake and fasting 
triglyceride or HDL levels.
Physical activity data were only 
available in a consistent format from 
2007–2012. During this time period, 
there were no trends in minutes 
per week of moderate to vigorous 
physical recreational activity. There 
was a significant decreasing trend 
in minutes per week of moderate 
to vigorous physical recreational 
activity in non-Hispanic black 
adolescents (P = .036). Physical 
activity was not associated with MetS 
z score (P = .377).
DISCUSSION
In evaluating temporal trends 
regarding MetS, previous studies 
have reported on changes in the 
prevalence of MetS. In using ATP-
III criteria, the prevalence of MetS 
appears to be stable or decreasing 
among US adults.24,25 We found in 
using an adolescent modification 
of these criteria that there was no 
change in MetS prevalence over this 
time period. Although MetS criteria 
have advantages in identifying future 
risk for disease in the presence of 
MetS,35,36 simple binary criteria 
have disadvantages in being unable 
to follow for changes in these 
metabolic derangements over time. 
We additionally used a MetS severity 
z score to assess for these changes, 
revealing a decline in MetS severity 
in US adolescents from 1999–2012. 
Given that MetS severity in childhood 
has been linked to risk for future 
T2DM23 and CVD,22 these trends may 
represent a turning point in future 
disease risk in this age group.
We sought to identify which clinical 
components of MetS could account 
for the decreasing trend in MetS z 
score. Interestingly, the decreasing 
trend in MetS z score was observed 
despite a significant increasing 
trend in BMI z score. The overall 
decreasing trend in MetS z score is 
likely secondary to the increasing

trend in HDL measurements 
and decreasing trend in fasting 
triglycerides measurements, 
which is consistent with previous 
findings.37 These individual MetS 
components trends were also 
observed in US adults and attributed 
to increased usage of antidiabetics 
and antihyperlipidemics.24 However, 
because we excluded all adolescent 
participants using antidiabetics 
and antihyperlipidemics, the trends 
observed in US adolescents must be 
attributable to other factors.
It is important to understand what 
may be contributing to this US 
adolescent population improvement 
in MetS severity because identifying 
the contributing factors could 
aid in ensuring their continued 
effectiveness, with potential 
beneficial implications for upcoming 
generations of children with respect 
to long-term health outcomes. We 
sought to identify trends in lifestyle 
factors that could be associated 
with the trends in MetS and its 
individual components. Percentage 
of total calories accounted for by 
carbohydrate or unsaturated fat 
intake were correlated with fasting 
triglyceride and HDL measurements. 
The increasing trend in HDL and 
decreasing fasting triglyceride 
measurements could be attributable 
in part to the trends of decreasing 
carbohydrate intake and increasing 
unsaturated fat intake. The Lyon 
Diet Heart Study, a randomized 
interventional trial, has shown 
that adherence to a Mediterranean 
diet, which emphasizes lower 
carbohydrate intake and greater 
unsaturated fat intake, resulted in 
significant reductions in CVD risks 
among adults <70 years old.38
Carbohydrate and unsaturated fat 
consumption were not significantly 
correlated with BMI z score. It 
was curious that total calorie 
consumption was significantly 
negatively correlated with BMI 
z score. Recent findings suggest 
that participants with higher 
BMI tended to underreport their 
calorie consumption.39 It could 
also potentially relate to reverse 
causation in which heavier children 
sought to reduce their total calorie 
consumption.40 Finally, despite 
the fact that we were limited in 
our ability to assess for changes in 
physical activity due to alterations in 
the assessment technique over the 
time period, data from the Youth Risk 
Behavior Surveillance system showed 
that there is increasing sedentary 
behaviors among US adolescents.41 
The lower calorie requirements 
associated with sedentary activities 
could offer an explanation for 
our data that obesity prevalence 
increased over time despite a 
significant decrease in total calorie 
consumption. This explanation 
would also corroborate our finding 
that total calorie consumption is 
indeed decreasing temporally in US 
adolescents.
As alluded to earlier, we were 
unable to attribute the trends in 
MetS severity and its individual 
factors to physical activity factors. 
Our analysis of physical activity 
data was limited because NHANES 
did not have a consistent variable 
assessing physical activity from 
1999 to 2012. Additionally, there 
are questions about the validity 
of quantifying adolescent physical 
activity data. There have been 
findings that adolescent self-reported 
physical activity data are significantly 
correlated to accelerometer 
data.42 However, adolescent 
accelerometry data also has 
limitations with respect to bias and 
generizability.43
There were additional limitations 
to our study. The ATP-III criteria 
lead to underdiagnosis of MetS 
in specific racial/ethnic groups.9 
This could result in an overall 
underestimate of MetS prevalence 
in the US adolescent population, 
particularly among African American 
adolescents. However, other sets 
of MetS criteria, which differ

largely in individual component 
cutoffs, have also had racial/ethnic 
discrepancies noted.15 We do not 
believe the use of a different set 
of MetS criteria would have had 
a significant effect on our results 
regarding trends in MetS diagnosis. 
Instead, we attempted to overcome 
the epidemiologic limitations by use 
of a MetS severity score that uniquely 
addresses differences in MetS by 
race/ethnicity. These MetS severity z 
scores have been validated, although 
they currently lack absolute cutoffs 
that correspond to particular risk 
for outcomes. There are current 
and future research efforts directed 
at achieving this goal. We were 
unable to assess causality due to the 
cross-sectional nature of NHANES. 
We correlated trends in MetS with 
lifestyle factors, but this can only 
be interpreted as association with 
unclear links to causality. Future 
studies should be directed at 
investigating the causality of lifestyle 
factors in improvements of MetS 
severity. Diet quality assessment 
was limited by its dependence on 
participant accurate reporting and 
bias.
CONCLUSIONS
This study has importance in that 
it is nationally representative for 
the US adolescent population, is 
novel in its temporal assessment of 
MetS severity, and explores possible 
lifestyle factors contributing to 
population health trends. These 
data further confirm the need 
for research, public health, and 
clinical collaboration in combatting 
childhood MetS.
