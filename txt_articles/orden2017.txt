Summary
Different studies have suggested that the sand of public playgrounds could have a role 
in the transmission of infections, particularly in children. Furthermore, free access of 
pets and other animals to the playgrounds might increase such a risk. We studied the 
presence of Clostridium difficile in 20 pairs of sandboxes for children and dogs located 
in different playgrounds within the Madrid region (Spain). Clostridium difficile isolation 
was performed by enrichment and selective culture procedures. The genetic (ribotype 
and amplified fragment length polymorphism [AFLP]) diversity and antibiotic suscepti-
bility of isolates was also studied. Overall, 52.5% (21/40) of samples were positive for 
the presence of C. difficile. Eight of the 20 available isolates belonged to the toxigenic 
ribotypes 014 (n = 5) and 106 (n = 2), both regarded as epidemic, and CD047 (n = 1). 
The other 12 isolates were non- 
toxigenic, and belonged to ribotypes 009 (n = 5), 039 
(n = 4), and 067, 151 and CD048 (one isolate each). Nevertheless, all isolates (even 
those of a same ribotype) were classified into different AFLP genotypes indicating 
non- 
relatedness. In conclusion, our results revealed the presence of epidemic ri-
botypes of C. difficile in children’s and dog’s sandboxes located nearby, which consti-
tutes a major health risk.

1 | INTRODUCTION
The soil of playgrounds is a reservoir of diverse parasites and infec-
tious agents (Dado et al., 2012; Gotkowska- 
Płachta & Korzeniewska, 
2015; Martínez- 
Moreno et al., 2007; Staley, Robinson, & Edge, 2016). 
Furthermore, free access of domestic and wild animals to recrea-
tional areas can increase the burden of microbiological contamination 
(Dado et al., 2012; Gotkowska- 
Płachta & Korzeniewska, 2015; Haag- 
Wackernagel & Moch, 2004; Martínez- 
Moreno et al., 2007; Staley 
et al., 2016). Children are generally regarded as the main group at 
risk for environmental exposure to pathogens, not only because they 
are frequent users of playgrounds, but also due to the high preva-
lence of geophagia (i.e. consumption of sand) within this group, and 
the immaturity of their immunological, neurological and digestive 
systems (Dado et al., 2012; Gotkowska- 
Płachta & Korzeniewska, 
2015; Nwachuku & Gerba, 2004).
Clostridium difficile is a Gram- 
positive, anaerobic bacterium of 
widespread distribution in the environment, where it can survive 
under adverse conditions through the production of spores (Hensgens 
et al., 2012; Smits, Lyras, Lacy, Wilcox, & Kuijper, 2016). This bacterial 
species was traditionally regarded as a primarily nosocomial pathogen, 
but this view has been challenged as the incidence of C. difficile infec-
tion (CDI) in people outside hospitals started to increase (Hensgens 
et al., 2012; Smits et al., 2016). In this context, diverse animal spe-
cies, food products and environmental sources have been suggested 
to play a role in the transmission of the C. difficile and, in particular, 
of some epidemic genotypes such as ribotype 078 (Hensgens et al., 
2012; Smits et al., 2016). However, to the best of our knowledge, the 
 2  |

presence of C. difficile in sandboxes of playgrounds has only been ex-
plored in a limited number of studies (al Saif & Brazier, 1996; Båverud, 
Gustafsson, Franklin, Aspán, & Gunnarsson, 2003; Higazi, AL- 
Saghir, 
Burkett, & Pusok, 2011).
In this study, we determined the presence of C. difficile in 20 pairs 
of recreational sandboxes for children and dogs located in different 
playgrounds within the Madrid region (Spain). In addition, we com-
pared the isolates recovered from children’s and dog’s sandboxes in 
terms of genetic characteristics and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Sampling scheme
Sampling was carried out on two consecutive days (1 July 2015 to 
2 July 2015) in 20 pairs of children’s and dog’s sandboxes located 
nearby (within 94 m in all cases, mean ± SD = 35.1 ± 20.5 m; Table 1) 
in public playgrounds scattered throughout three zones (A, M and V; 
postal codes: E- 
28047, E- 
28222/E- 
28221/E- 
28220 and E- 
28400, re-
spectively) within the Madrid region (central Spain; Fig. S1). Therefore, 
a total of 40 sandboxes (20 for children and 20 for dogs) were ana-
lysed. The number and distribution of samples per sampling zone and 
sampling point is indicated in Table 1.
A 200- 
g sand sample was obtained from each sampling point ac-
cording to the procedure described in Córdoba et al. (2002). Briefly, 
four 50- 
g sand samples were collected from different locations within 
the sampling point using a sterile plastic container (Nirco, Madrid, 
Spain). All four sand samples were then thoroughly mixed in a sterile 
plastic bag (Nirco), which was transported to the laboratory and kept 
frozen (−20°C) until analysed.
2.2 | Microbiological analyses
Sand samples (50 g each, taken and aseptically weighted from the 
200- 
g mixtures kept in the freezer) were transferred into sterile one- 
litre glass bottles, diluted 1:10 in peptone water (Laboratorios Conda, 
Madrid. Spain) and incubated under agitation (200 rpm) for 15 min at 
room temperature. These suspensions were then allowed to settle for 
5 min, and the supernatants were filtered through filter membranes 
(0.45 μm of pore size; Filter Lab, Barcelona, Spain) following the pro-
cedure detailed in Álvarez- 
Pérez, Blanco, Peláez, Martínez- 
Nevado, 
and García (2016). Filter membranes were then introduced into 10- 
ml 
glass tubes containing 5 ml of selective broth for enrichment of C. dif-
ficile (TecLaim, Madrid, Spain; see recipe in Blanco, Álvarez- 
Pérez, & 
García, 2013). After 7 days of incubation at 37°C under anaerobiosis, 
2 ml of the enrichment culture were mixed 1:1 with absolute etha-
nol (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) in 5- 
ml sterile plastic tubes (Nirco) and 
left for 1 hr under agitation (200 rpm) at room temperature. Finally, 
tubes were centrifuged at 1,520 g for 10 min, the supernatants were 
discarded, and precipitates were spread with a sterile cotton- 
tipped 
swab (Nirco) onto a plate of CLO agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, 
France), which contains cycloserine and cefoxitin as selective agents. 
Inoculated plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 72 hr 
at 37°C, and suspected colonies were identified as C. difficile by colony 
morphology, the typical odour of this micro- 
organism, and a positive 
result in a rapid specific immunoassay for detection of the constitutive 
antigen glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; C. Diff Quik Chek Complete; 
TECHLAB Inc., Blacksburg, VA, USA). The same immunoassay was 
used to determine the toxigenic/non- 
toxigenic status of isolates, as it 
detects production of C. difficile toxins A and B. A single C. difficile iso-
late was selected from each primary culture and subcultured on CLO 
agar to obtain axenic cultures that could be used in subsequent tests.
2.3 | Molecular characterization of isolates
Possession of tcdA and tcdB genes (which encode for toxins A and B, 
respectively), and cdtA and cdtB (which encode for the two compo-
nents of binary toxin (CDT), respectively), was analysed by conven-
tional PCR protocols (Álvarez- 
Pérez et al., 2009, 2014, 2015).
Genotyping of isolates was performed by high- 
resolution capil-
lary gel- 
based electrophoresis PCR ribotyping, following the proce-
dures described in Fawley et al. (2015). Ribotypes were designated 
according to the nomenclature of the Leiden (Prof. Ed Kuijper; the 
Netherlands)- 
Leeds (Dr. Warren Fawley and Prof. Mark Wilcox; UK) 
database. Novel ribotypes were named using internal reference codes 
(prefix “CD” followed by a number).
Isolates were further genetically characterized by amplified frag-
ment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting, using the protocol 
detailed in Álvarez- 
Pérez, Blanco, Harmanus, Kuijper, and García (2017). 
A binary 0/1 matrix was created based on the absence/presence of 
AFLP markers, and a dendrogram of AFLP patterns was created with 
PAST v.3.11 software (Hammer, Harper, & Ryan, 2001) using Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients and the unweighted- 
pair group method with 
arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering algorithm. Isolates clustering 
with <86% similarity were considered to represent different AFLP gen-
otypes (Álvarez- 
Pérez et al., 2017; Killgore et al., 2008).
2.4 | Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
In vitro susceptibility of isolates was determined by the Etest (bioMé-
rieux) on pre- 
reduced Brucella agar supplemented with vitamin K1 and

haemin (bioMérieux), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Plates were incubated anaerobically at 37°C and examined at 48 hr. 
Tested antimicrobial compounds and break points for antimicrobial 
resistance were as follows: penicillin G, ≥2 μg/ml; teicoplanin, >2 μg/
ml; rifampicin, ≥4 μg/ml; linezolid and tigecycline, >4 μg/ml; clindamy-
cin, erythromycin and levofloxacin, ≥8 μg/ml; imipenem, minocycline 
and tetracycline, ≥16 μg/ml; amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ≥16/8 μg/ml; 
and metronidazole and vancomycin, ≥32 μg/ml. (Álvarez- 
Pérez et al., 
2013, 2014, 2015, 2017; CLSI, 2012; Peláez et al., 2013).
To detect possible metronidazole heteroresistance, which is man-
ifested as a slow growth of resistant subpopulations within the inhi-
bition halo in the Etest at concentrations above the resistance break 
point, metronidazole test plates were further incubated anaerobically 
at 37°C for 5 additional days (Peláez et al., 2008).
2.5 | Data analysis
Fisher’s exact test and Pearson’s chi- 
square test were used for statis-
tical analysis of categorical data where appropriate. p- 
values of <.05 
were considered to be statistically significant in all cases.
3 | RESULTS
Clostridium difficile was recovered from 21 (52.5%) of the sand samples 
analysed, collected from 12 and nine sandboxes located in recreational 
areas for dogs and children, respectively (Table 1). The distribution of 
isolates by sampling (sub)zone and type of sample (children’s or dog’s 
sandboxes) is shown in Table 1. There was no difference in C. diffi-
cile prevalence between children’s and dog’s sandboxes (p = .527) or 
among sampling zones (p = .203). A positive culture result for both 
samples of each pair was obtained in five cases, whereas C. difficile 
was recovered only from one sandbox of the pair in 11 cases (four 
from children’s sandboxes and seven from dog’s sandboxes) and a 
negative culture result for both samples was obtained in four cases 
(Table 1).
One C. difficile isolate (obtained from a children’s sandbox in zone 
A [sample A- 
N- 
2], Table 1) was lost during subculturing in the labora-
tory. Eight of the 20 remaining isolates (six from dog’s and two from 
children’s sandboxes) were toxigenic and belonged to ribotypes 014 
(A+B+CDT−, n = 5), 106 (A+B+CDT−, n = 2) and CD047 (isolate M- 
P- 
4, A+B+CDT−; Tables 1 and S1, Figure 1). The other 12 isolates were 
non- 
toxigenic (i.e. A−B−CDT−) and belonged to ribotypes 009 (n = 5), 
039 (n = 4), and 067, 151 and CD048 (one isolate each; Tables 1 and 
S1, Figure 1). Further genetic characterization of isolates by AFLP 
fingerprinting classified each one of these into a different genotype 
(Figure 1 and Table S1). Notably, clustering of isolates in the UPGMA 
dendrogram obtained from AFLP data was independent from the or-
igin (both at the “(sub)zone” and “children vs. dog areas” levels) and 
ribotype of isolates (Figure 1).
Regardless of their origin and genotype, all studied isolates 
showed resistance to imipenem and levofloxacin (Figure 1 and Table 
S1). Additionally, the isolates of ribotypes CD048 and 151 (A- 
N- 
8 and 
V- 
N- 
1, respectively) displayed resistance to clindamycin and erythro-
mycin, and a ribotype 014 isolate (A- 
P- 
3) was resistant to penicillin 
(Figure 1 and Table S1). MICs to the other antimicrobial compound 
tested were generally low and fell below the resistance break point in 
all cases (Table S1).
Notably, the samples obtained from a pair of children’s and dog’s 
sandboxes in zone V (V- 
N- 
2/V- 
P- 
2; Figure 2) yielded C. difficile isolates 
of a same toxigenic ribotype (014) and which showed a similar anti-
microbial susceptibility profile, but the AFLP profiles of such isolates 
displayed limited similarity (Pearson’s correlation = 0.126; Figure 1). 
In contrast, four pairs of sand samples (A- 
N- 
3/A- 
P- 
3, A- 
N- 
4/A- 
P- 
4, 
A- 
N- 
5/A- 
P- 
5 and V- 
N-

P- 
1) yielded C. difficile isolates of different 
ribotypes.
4 | DISCUSSION
The growing number of pets and other animals leaving excrements 
in the sandboxes of playgrounds and other recreational areas con-
stitutes a serious epidemiological threat (Gotkowska- 
Płachta & 
Korzeniewska, 2015; Martínez- 
Moreno et al., 2007; Staley et al., 
2016). Current tests for assessing the sanitary conditions of sand-
boxes focus on detecting some select pathogenic parasites and 
bacterial indicators of faecal contamination (Gotkowska- 
Płachta & 
Korzeniewska, 2015; Martínez- 
Moreno et al., 2007; Staley et al., 
2016), but mostly neglect the possible presence of other emerging 
pathogens such as C. difficile.
Reports of C. difficile presence in recreational sandboxes are still 
limited in number and of variable scope. For example, al Saif and 
Brazier (1996) reported the isolation of C. difficile from a 21% of soil 
samples taken from public parks, gardens, playgrounds and other lo-
cations in the suburbs of Cardiff, UK. Subsequent characterization 
of some of those soil isolates by PCR ribotyping and pyrolysis mass 
spectrometry (PyMS) fingerprinting revealed the presence of toxin 
producers and different ribotypes (Al- 
Saif, O’Neill, Magee, Brazier, & 
Duerden, 1998). Similarly, Higazi et al. (2011) investigated by a PCR- 
based approach the presence of C. difficile in soil samples from public 
parks and elementary school playgrounds in a Midwestern town of the 
USA and reported an overall prevalence of 6.5%, but bacterial isolates 
were only obtained in some cases and these were not genotyped nor 
tested for antimicrobial resistance. Finally, Båverud et al. (2003) ob-
served an overall C. difficile prevalence of 4% in soil samples obtained 
from public parks, playgrounds, gardens and cultivated fields, but the 
origin and characteristics of recovered isolates were not detailed in 
their paper.
In this study, we demonstrated that C. difficile is widely distributed 
in soils samples from both children’s and dog’s sandboxes located 
within the metropolitanean area of Madrid. Furthermore, our results 
revealed that recovered isolates were genetically diverse and dis-
played resistance to several antibiotics (≥2 drugs, including in all cases 
imipenem and levofloxacin). Notably, analysis of AFLP fingerprinting 
results showed high genetic variation even among isolates obtained 
from a same sampling (sub)zone.

ORDEN Et al.
Most C. difficile isolates recovered in this study from sandboxes 
belonged to ribotypes 014 and 009. The toxigenic ribotype 014 is 
one of the most prevalent genotypes isolated from human patients 
and animals in Europe (including Spain) and other countries such as 
Australia, Brazil and the USA (Alcalá et al., 2012, 2015; Bauer et al., 
2011 ; Freeman et al., 2015; Janezic, Ocepek, Zidaric, & Rupnik, 2012; 
Janezic et al., 2014; Knight, Giglio, et al., 2015; Knight, Squire, & Riley, 
2015; Koene et al., 2012; Silva, Rupnik, Diniz, Vilela, & Lobato, 2015; 
Tickler et al., 2014). Non- 
toxigenic ribotype 009 is also prevalent 
in both human and animal hosts in some countries including Brazil 
(Silva et al., 2015), but it is rarely reported in Spain and the rest of 
Europe (e.g. Álvarez- 
Pérez et al., 2015; Koene et al., 2012; Wetterwik, 
Trowald- 
Wigh, Fernström, & Krovacek, 2013).
Other ribotypes found in this study such as 039 and 106 are also 
frequently isolated from human and/or animal faecal samples (Alcalá 
et al., 2012, 2015 ; Bauer et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 2015; Koene 
et al., 2012; Tickler et al., 2014). In particular, ribotype 106 has been 
implicated in outbreaks of human disease in the UK (Ratnayake et al., 
2011) and is also relatively common in continental Europe and North 
America (Alcalá et al., 2012,2015; Bauer et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 
2015; Tickler et al., 2014). We recently obtained several ribotype 
106 isolates from the faeces of dogs with diverse digestive disorders 
(Orden et al., 2017). Curiously, despite the frequent shedding of C. dif-
ficile ribotype 078 by animals previously observed in Spain (Álvarez- 
Pérez et al., 2013, 2014, 2015; Peláez et al., 2013) and many other 
countries (Janezic et al., 2014), we did not found any isolate of this

epidemic ribotype in the present study. Nevertheless, as a single C. dif-
ficile isolate from each primary culture was selected for detailed phe-
notypic and genetic characterization, we cannot discard the possibility 
that this and other ribotypes might have been overlooked.
Finally, all isolates characterized in this study displayed high- 
level 
in vitro resistance to imipenem and levofloxacin, a phenotype which 
is fairly common among diverse ribotypes of C. difficile from differ-
ent geographic locations (Alcalá et al., 2012; Freeman et al., 2015; 
Keessen et al., 2013; Pirš et al., 2013). As carbapenems and fluoro-
quinolones are widely used in human and veterinary medicine to 
treat a diversity of infections (Papich, 2016; Papp- 
Wallace, Endimiani, 
Taracila, & Bonomo, 2011; Redgrave, Sutton, Webber, & Piddock, 
2014), monitoring the resistance to these compounds in C. difficile and 
other emerging pathogens should be a priority. Furthermore, some 
isolates were found to be resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin and 
penicillin G, all of which are of common use in clinical practice (Papich, 
2016). Although we did not detect any isolate with decreased suscep-
tibility or heterogeneous resistance to metronidazole, we recommend 
to determine MIC values to this antibiotic even for environmental iso-
lates, as metronidazole is still considered a first- 
line drug for the treat-
ment of anaerobe infections in human and animal medicine (Dhand & 
Snydman, 2009; Löfmark, Edlund, & Nord, 2010; Papich, 2016) and 
(hetero)resistant strains of C. difficile and other clostridia have been 
reported by different authors (Álvarez- 
Pérez et al., 2013, 2014, 2015, 
2017; Peláez et al., 2008, 2013; Wetterwik et al., 2013).
5 | CONCLUSIONS
In summary, our results revealed the presence of epidemic ribotypes 
of C. difficile in children’s and dog’s sandboxes, which constitutes a 
major health risk. Due to the zoonotic potential attributed to some ri-
botypes of C. difficile, the possible presence of this emerging pathogen 
should be considered in any environmental risk assessment.
