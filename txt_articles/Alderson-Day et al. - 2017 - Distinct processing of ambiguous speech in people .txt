Auditory verbal hallucinations (hearing voices) are typically associated with psychosis, but a minority of the general population
also experience them frequently and without distress. Such ‘non-clinical’ experiences offer a rare and unique opportunity to study
hallucinations apart from confounding clinical factors, thus allowing for the identification of symptom-specific mechanisms. Recent
theories propose that hallucinations result from an imbalance of prior expectation and sensory information, but whether such an
imbalance also influences auditory-perceptual processes remains unknown. We examine for the first time the cortical processing of
ambiguous speech in people without psychosis who regularly hear voices. Twelve non-clinical voice-hearers and 17 matched
controls completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while passively listening to degraded speech (‘sine-wave’
speech), that was either potentially intelligible or unintelligible. Voice-hearers reported recognizing the presence of speech in the
stimuli before controls, and before being explicitly informed of its intelligibility. Across both groups, intelligible sine-wave speech
engaged a typical left-lateralized speech processing network. Notably, however, voice-hearers showed stronger intelligibility re-
sponses than controls in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the superior frontal gyrus. This suggests an enhanced involve-
ment of attention and sensorimotor processes, selectively when speech was potentially intelligible. Altogether, these behavioural
and neural findings indicate that people with hallucinatory experiences show distinct responses to meaningful auditory stimuli. A
greater weighting towards prior knowledge and expectation might cause non-veridical auditory sensations in these individuals, but
it might also spontaneously facilitate perceptual processing where such knowledge is required. This has implications for the
understanding of hallucinations in clinical and non-clinical populations, and is consistent with current ‘predictive processing’
theories of psychosis.

 Introduction
Auditory verbal hallucinations are typically studied in the
context of schizophrenia. However, the presence of other
clinical factors, such as additional symptoms or the use of
medication, makes it challenging to investigate neurocogni-
tive mechanisms that are hallucination-specific. One solu-
tion is to study auditory verbal hallucinations—or more
commonly ‘voice-hearing’—in the minority of the general
population who have such experiences without need for
care (Johns et al., 2014). The existence of ‘non-clinical’
voice-hearing has been noted for many years and is
strongly argued for by community groups (Romme and
Escher, 1989; Corstens et al., 2014). Estimates for voice-
hearing in the general population vary from 5% to 15%
(Beavan et al., 2011), but rates for frequent and complex
voices appear closer to 1–2% (Johns et al., 1998; Kra
˚kvik
et al., 2015). Such non-clinical voice-hearing (NCVH) is
featurally
similar
to
auditory
verbal
hallucinations
described in psychosis, but usually more controllable and
positive in content (Daalman et al., 2011). Many non-clin-
ical voice-hearers value their experiences and may seek to
cultivate them over time (Baumeister et al., 2017; Powers
et al., 2017).
Concerns about stigma make the recruitment of non-clin-
ical voice-hearers extremely challenging: consequently, only
a handful of studies have sought to examine the neurocog-
nitive features of NCVH (Linden et al., 2011; Kompus
et al., 2013). The most successful of these was conducted
in Utrecht, Holland, which initially identified 103 people
with frequent NCVH who did not qualify for a psychiatric
diagnosis (Sommer et al., 2010). To date, this remains the
only project to have carried out neuroimaging studies in
NCVH samples greater than 10 (Diederen et al., 2012; de
Weijer et al., 2013; van Lutterveld et al., 2014). These
studies have shown that when hearing voices, people with
NCVH and clinical auditory verbal hallucinations engage
similar brain networks associated with speech and language
processing, including the bilateral superior temporal gyrus
(STG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior insula
(Diederen et al., 2012). The experience of NCVH likely
also involves regions associated with the generation and
monitoring of speech-motor imagery, as well as sensori-
motor processes, such as the supplementary and pre-sup-
plementary motor areas (SMA/pre-SMA; Linden et al.,
2011; Lima et al., 2016). Atypical modulation of sensory
cortex, by attention/monitoring and sensorimotor processes
in the SMA/pre-SMA and adjacent anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), has been proposed as a potential mechanism under-
lying the experience of auditory verbal hallucinations (Allen
et al., 2007).
In behavioural studies, people with NCVH appear to be
particularly
susceptible
to
semantic
expectation
effects
when instructed to monitor for speech in white noise
(Daalman et al., 2012), a result similar to effects seen in
clinical
voice-hearers
and
members
of
the
general
population who report milder, hallucination-like experi-
ences (Fernyhough et al., 2007; Vercammen et al., 2008;
Vercammen and Aleman, 2010; Varese et al., 2012). Such
effects have been interpreted as evidence of a bias in the
perceptual processing of people with NCVH: a prior ex-
pectation for linguistic, meaningful percepts that would be
sufficient to propagate internally-generated representations
(e.g. speech imagery) down through speech and language
networks,
leading
to
non-veridical
speech
perception
(Vercammen and Aleman, 2010; Daalman et al., 2012).
However, if such ‘priors for speech’ are the mechanism
underlying NCVH, their influence could be evident not just
in speech monitoring tasks but also in speech processing
more broadly, particularly when speech perception depends
upon prior knowledge to disambiguate a degraded signal.
An atypically strong prior for speech could actually facili-
tate processing, either spontaneously (allowing the hearer
to identify potentially meaningful signals more easily) or
when specifically directed by instructions (in turn enhan-
cing the discrimination of speech from non-speech). This
is consistent with recent evidence reported by Teufel et al.
(2015) for visual processing in psychosis. People with an ‘at
risk’ mental state (i.e. in early stages of psychosis) outper-
formed controls in their ability to identify objects in am-
biguous, Mooney-style visual stimuli (Mooney, 1957), but
only once they were given priming information about the
objects. That is, people with hallucinations gained more
from prior knowledge that could modulate their sensory
predictions, leading to better skills in drawing meaning
from noise. A similar effect in voice-hearers has never
been demonstrated for the auditory domain, but can be
tested using an ambiguous auditory stimulus: sine-wave
speech (SWS).
SWS is a form of acoustically degraded speech, derived
by synthesizing tones that track the amplitude and fre-
quency of speech formants (Remez et al., 1981). This can
be used to produce potentially intelligible and unintelligible
stimuli, based on whether the frequency and amplitude are
drawn from the same or different original sentences (Rosen
et al., 2011). SWS is typically unintelligible on first expos-
ure and may not be noticed as being speech-like (often
sounding like ‘aliens’ or birdsong). Once the listener
knows that it is potentially intelligible, though, relatively
high levels of comprehension can be achieved (Remez
et al., 2011; Rosen et al., 2011). Following training, SWS
engages a left-lateralized ‘speech mode’ network including
anterior and posterior temporal cortex (STG and middle
temporal gyrus), IFG and insula (Vouloumanos et al.,
2001; Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2005; Benson et al.,
2006; Mo
¨tto
¨nen et al., 2006; McGettigan et al., 2012).
Effects of prior knowledge and training on the processing
of SWS and similar stimuli are reflected in the greater in-
volvement of inferior frontal cortex (Davis and Johnsrude,
2003), pre-SMA, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Eisner
et al., 2010; Rosen et al., 2011), while posterior temporal
cortex appears to track changes in sensory detail (Sohoglu
et al., 2012) and predictability (Gagnepain et al., 2012).

 Here we used SWS to study whether potential priors for
speech in NCVH modulate the spontaneous processing of
ambiguous sounds. NCVH participants and matched non-
voice-hearing controls passively listened to intelligible and
unintelligible SWS while being scanned in functional MRI,
in a paradigm adapted from a study by Shanmugalingam
et al. (2012). To disguise the presence of speech, partici-
pants were instructed to listen for a target cue (an equiva-
lent noise-vocoded, unintelligible SWS stimulus, which
sounded ‘noisier’ and ‘rougher’), and were told that the
other sounds (intelligible and unintelligible SWS) were ‘dis-
tractor’ stimuli (Fig. 1). After 20 min of scanning (Run 1),
participants were asked if they had noticed any words or
sentences in the distractor stimuli, and if so, when this
occurred during the scan (visual markers were displayed
during scanning to assist this, e.g. Block 1, 2 etc.).
Participants were then explicitly told that there was actu-
ally speech in some of the stimuli (the ‘reveal’), were
trained to understand the SWS sentences within the scan-
ner, and the scan was repeated, with the same set of stimuli
and instructions (Run 2). After scanning, we tested the
ability of participants to discriminate between intelligible
SWS and unintelligible SWS (d’), their bias in classifying
speech and non-speech (�), and accuracy (number of key
words correct).
We
anticipated
that
voice-hearers
would
show
an
enhanced ability to identify intelligible information in
SWS when it was present, and our design allowed us to
explore when and how this occurred. Behaviourally, if
voice-hearers had a pre-existing prior for linguistic per-
cepts, then this could be evident in an earlier recognition
point for spontaneously identifying speech in the SWS sti-
muli. Alternatively, if voice-hearers were more likely to re-
spond to the stimuli as speech-like only when their prior
expectation for speech was explicitly modulated (following
the reveal and training), this would result in no differences
in recognition point, but potentially greater behavioural
discrimination of speech and non-speech in the post-scan-
ner task.
Neurally, potentially enhanced predictive representations
of speech would be evident in a greater involvement of
regions associated with prior knowledge effects on speech
Figure 1 Experimental design and behavioural results. Participants were scanned in functional MRI while (A) listening to intelligible SWS,
unintelligible SWS, or noise-vocoded, unintelligible target sounds; (B) listening and rest trials were presented in a pseudo-random order across two
20-min runs, divided by a ‘reveal’ period including training to understand SWS stimuli; (C) each trial lasted 8.4 s, including jitter, a 2 s stimulus and 3.4 s
of volume acquisition; (D) NCVH participants recognized speech being present earlier than control participants during Run 1 (left), and this
correlated with voice-hearing during the previous week (PSYRATS – Physical Characteristics subscale). PSYRATS = Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale.

 perception, including left inferior frontal cortex, pre-SMA
and adjacent areas. If this reflected a spontaneous mechan-
ism, then it would be seen before the reveal, and potentially
also after; in other words, a general enhancement of the
intelligibility response would be evident for NCVH partici-
pants. Alternatively, if it required explicit modulation, it
would result in an enhancement of the intelligibility re-
sponse only after the reveal. Both possibilities stand in con-
trast to the notion that the effect would be driven by
differences in low-level auditory processes alone: a low-
level effect (contrary to our expectations) would be evident
in differential activation of sensory cortical regions (pri-
mary auditory cortex) across groups.
Materials and methods
Participants
The study included 12 NCVH participants and 17 non-voice-
hearing control participants, matched for age, sex, handedness,
education, and National Adult Reading Test scores (Nelson,
1982) (Table 1). All participants were aware that the study
involved voice-hearers, but the project was described as focus-
ing on ‘how the brain processes unusual sounds’, with study
materials making no other reference to voices or speech.
Non-clinical voice-hearers were recruited in response to an
online article for a national newspaper (Alderson-Day, 2014)
and via social media, word of mouth, adverts with spiritual
organizations, and previous participation in a related project
(n = 4; the UNIQUE project; Peters et al., 2016). Participants
were included if they were over 18, had never received a psy-
chiatric diagnosis in relation to voice-hearing, and endorsed
any of three items derived from the revised Launay-Slade
Hallucination
Scale
(LSHS;
Bentall
and
Slade,
1985;
Morrison et al., 2000): ‘In the past I have had the experience
of hearing a person’s voice that other people could not hear’, ‘I
have heard a voice on at least one occasion in the past month’,
or ‘I have been troubled by hearing voices in my head’.
Following Sommer et al. (2010), a phone screener was used
to establish that (i) voices were distinct from thoughts and had
a ‘hearing quality’; (ii) voices were experienced at least once a
month; (iii) voices were unrelated to drug or alcohol abuse;
and (iv) no psychiatric diagnosis or treatment other than anx-
iety or depression in remission. Over an 18-month recruitment
period, this identified 12 individuals who were then inter-
viewed in more detail about their experiences (either at the
participant’s home or at a university location) and completed
a functional MRI scanning session (see Supplementary material
for interview details). Home visits were necessary due to the
large geographical spread of participants across the UK.
Stimuli
The SWS stimuli were drawn from a stimulus set developed by
Rosen et al. (2011) and used in McGettigan et al. (2012).
Intelligible SWS and unintelligible SWS were identical to
those previously used apart from being further noise-vocoded
(Shannon et al., 1995), a step we deliberately omitted to make
them less noticeably speech-like. The only exception was the
‘target’ sounds, which were created by noise-vocoding a subset
of 10 unintelligible SWS to change their timbre and make them
distinctive from other stimuli. All SWS stimuli were derived
from Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentences (e.g. ‘The clown had a
funny face’; Bench et al., 1979) and recorded by an adult male
speaker of standard Southern British English in an anechoic
chamber. Frequency and amplitude from the first two formant
tracks of each sentence were tracked and modelled with a sine
wave tone using a semi-automatic procedure in MATLAB (The
Mathworks, Natick, MA). Tracks were reviewed and hand-
edited using custom software to ensure accurate tracking
(Remez et al., 2011; Rosen et al., 2011). See Supplementary
material for full details of the SWS preparation methods.
Pre-scan training
All training was conducted without mention of ‘voices’ or
‘speech’. Participants were told that they would be listening

 to a range of sounds in the scanner, and instructed to listen
out for a target sound that would sound ‘different’ or ‘noisier’
than the others. We did not provide information about the
potential vocal/speech nature of the stimuli, and did not per-
form a pre-scan task to assess speech perception abilities, in
order to ensure that participants remained naı
¨ve regarding our
key manipulation, so that spontaneous responses to the stimuli
could be examined in the scanner. Participants were played an
example target sound three times over Sennheiser HD25 head-
phones, and then played three more examples of target sounds
along with five non-vocoded unintelligible SWS stimuli, in a
random order. Participants indicated with a button-press when
they heard a target sound, and the stimulus set was repeated
until participants could consistently discriminate targets from
non-targets (no participant required the sequence to be re-
peated more than three times).
Functional MRI task
Participants listened to the SWS sounds across two identical
runs of 20 min, broken up into six ‘blocks’ that were marked
with a visually presented text stimulus (Block 1, Block 2, etc)
(Fig. 1). Each run contained 45 intelligible SWS trials, 45 un-
intelligible SWS trials and 18 target sounds, presented quasi-
randomly (one stimulus per trial). Target sounds and 19 silent
trials were distributed such that they were presented regularly
but unpredictably across the run, with no more than two trials
from the same condition occurring sequentially. For each run
they were instructed to listen closely for the target sounds and
press a button each time one was heard.
After the first run, while still in the scanner, participants
were asked the following questions: (1) Did you notice any
words or sentences in the sounds you heard? (2) If so, do
you know when you first noticed them? (3) Could you under-
stand the words? and (4) Could you repeat any of the words?
For question 2, participants were asked to estimate when they
first noticed that words were present, using the visual markers
displayed periodically during the run. This was scored to the
nearest block (1–6); for example, if someone reported hearing
speech ‘from the start of block 4 onwards’, they would receive a
4. If participants specifically stated noticing halfway through a
block, or were unsure but offered a range (e.g. ‘some time
around block 3 or block 4’), they were allocated a half score
(e.g. 3.5, 4.5) in an attempt to be more precise. This score was
then used as their individual ‘recognition point’ and treated as a
continuous variable for subsequent analyses. Participants were
then told that the first run included some potentially intelligible
sentences in the non-target stimuli (the reveal), before being
played six new intelligible SWS sentences. Participants were
played each sentence once, asked to repeat any words they
could back to the experimenter, showed a written presentation
of the sentence, and then played the sentence two more times,
along with the written presentation of the sentence. This com-
bination of distorted auditory presentation and clear written
feedback has previously been used to demonstrate effective intel-
ligibility training effects on similar degraded stimuli (Davis et al.,
2005). This process was repeated a maximum of twice (for all
six sentences) to ensure that participants could decode the po-
tentially intelligible SWS sentences in Run 2. The instructions for
Run 2 were the same as run 1, i.e. participants were not in-
structed to pay attention to the now intelligible SWS sentences
and instead to just listen for the target sounds.
Participants also completed two 5-min resting state scans before
and after the passive listening run as part of a separate study.
Post-scan behavioural task
Following scanning, participants were played 50 SWS stimuli
in a random order (25 intelligible SWS, 25 unintelligible SWS).
For each stimulus, participants told an experimenter (i) if
speech was present; and (ii) if so, what was being said. To
check that participants could decode new sentences and not
just recognize repeated sentences, 20% of the stimuli were new
to the participants. Following prior studies, the main outcomes
were ‘keyword accuracy’ (number of key words correctly iden-
tified in intelligible SWS), d’ (sensitivity to speech versus non-
speech), and � (bias in identifying speech as present or absent).
The post-scanner task was self-paced and took �15 min.
MRI acquisition
MRI scanning was completed on a 1.5 T Siemens Avanto using
a
32-channel
birdcage
headcoil.
Whole-brain
echo-planar
images were collected in two runs of 147 volumes each,
using a sparse-sampling routine in which auditory stimuli
were presented during the silent gap between brain acquisi-
tions (Hall et al., 1999). The following parameters were
used:
repetition
time = 8.4 s;
acquisition
time = 3.4 s,
echo
time = 0.5 s, flip angle = 90�, 40 axial slices, 3 mm3 in plane
resolution. For localization, high resolution anatomical images
were also acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization pre-
pared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (MP-RAGE;
repetition time = 2.73 s, echo time = 3.57 ms, flip angle = 7�,
176 sagittal slices, voxel size = 1 mm3).
Auditory onsets occurred 5 s (�0–1-s jitter) before the begin-
ning of the following volume acquisition. The stimuli were pre-
sented
using
Psychtoolbox
(Brainard,
1997),
running
in
MATLAB, via a Sony STR-DH510 digital AV control center
(Sony) and MRI-compatible insert earphones (Sensimetrics
Corporation). The sound volume was individually adjusted to
a comfortable hearing level prior to scanning. All participants
reported being able to hear the sounds without any difficulty.
MRI analysis
MRI analysis was conducted using
Statistical Parametric
Mapping software (SPM version 8; Wellcome Trust Centre
for Neuroimaging, London, UK). The first two volumes of
each run were discarded to allow longitudinal magnetization
to ensure signal equilibrium. Functional images were realigned
with the first volume per run and the anatomical T1 image was
then co-registered to the mean functional image. Functional
images were then spatially normalized to MNI space using
the parameters acquired from segmentation, resampled to 2
mm3 voxels, and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of 8
mm3 full-width at half-maximum to ameliorate differences in
intersubject localization. Responses for events of interest were
modelled using a canonical haemodynamic response function.
Intelligible SWS, unintelligible SWS, target sounds and visual
stimuli (block titles) were modelled from their onsets with dur-
ations of 2 s, with silent trials acting as an implicit ‘rest’ base-
line. Within each run, individual conditions were modelled as
separate regressors in a generalized linear model (GLM), along
with six movement parameters derived from realignment (three

 translations, three rotations), that were included as regressors
of no interest.
At the first-level (single-subject), T-contrast images were gen-
erated for the comparison of each of the conditions (intelligible
SWS, unintelligible SWS, vigilance targets) against the implicit
rest baseline. The following planned contrasts were also gen-
erated during first-level analyses:
(i) (intelligible SWS Run 1 + intelligible SWS Run 2) � (unintelli-
gible SWS Run 1 + unintelligible SWS Run 2), corresponding to
the general effect of intelligibility across runs. If NCVH partici-
pants spontaneously responded to intelligible stimuli in a distinct
manner, group differences would be expected for this contrast.
(ii) (intelligible SWS Run 2 � unintelligible SWS Run 2) � (unintel-
ligible SWS Run 1 � intelligible SWS Run 1), corresponding to a
larger intelligibility response on Run 2 versus Run 1, once intel-
ligible SWS were explicitly revealed as speech and participants
were trained to understand it. If explicit modulation of expect-
ations was required to trigger a distinct processing of intelligible
stimuli in NCVH participants, group differences would be ex-
pected for this contrast.
(iii) intelligible SWS Run 1 � unintelligible SWS Run 1, correspond-
ing to the intelligibility response prior to the reveal. Finding
group differences for this contrast would further support the ar-
gument that NCVH spontaneously respond to intelligible stimuli
in a distinct manner, and it would establish that the reveal and
training are not required for group differences to emerge.
(iv) intelligible SWS Run 2 � unintelligible SWS Run 2, correspond-
ing to the intelligibility response post-reveal. Group differences
could also be seen for this contrast, but would not directly estab-
lish or refute differences in spontaneous processing as participants
had already been told about the existence of speech in the intel-
ligible SWS.
These images were taken up to second-level random effects
analyses for group inferences. Where group differences were
observed, analyses were repeated controlling for any behav-
ioural differences between the groups (i.e. a difference in
recognition point) by including them as covariates in the
second-level analyses. We also carried out exploratory individ-
ual differences analyses in SPM, to examine associations be-
tween neural responses and behavioural performance. All
statistical maps were thresholded at P 5 0.001 peak-level un-
corrected, cluster corrected with a family-wise error (FWE) at
P 5 0.05 across the whole-brain. All co-ordinates are reported
in MNI space. Anatomical labels are based on the SPM
Anatomy toolbox (Eickhoff et al., 2005) and the Human
Motor Area Template (HMAT; Mayka et al., 2006), with
images produced using SPM and MRIcroGL. Parameter esti-
mates were extracted for plotting using the MarsBaR toolbox
(Brett et al., 2002) with regions of interest based on the full
cluster extent of activated regions in the above analyses.
Between-groups comparison of behavioural data was analysed
using two-tailed t-tests at P 5 0.05, unless otherwise specified.
Results
Behavioural analyses
During the training phase, some participants described the
sounds as being ‘a bit like a robot’ or ‘like the Clangers’,
but no participants described either the target or unintelli-
gible SWS sounds as being speech or voice-like. However,
while being scanned, the majority of NCVH participants
reported perceiving speech in the SWS stimuli before the
mid-scan reveal, with one participant reporting hearing
speech from the first ‘three or four words’ of Run 1. A
significant difference was evident for the recognition point
when participants reported first noticing words in the SWS:
on average, the NCVH group heard them a block earlier
than controls, as shown in Fig. 1D [mean = 3.71 and 4.94
for
NCVH
and
control
participants,
respectively;
t(27) = �2.17, P = 0.039]. [Due to non-normal data in the
control group this comparison was also run using a per-
mutation test in the perm package for R, producing similar
results (mean difference = �1.23, P = 0.041), Monte Carlo
method used with 2000 replications.] Overall, 9/12 NCVH
participants (75%) reported realizing that there were words
present compared to only 8/17 controls (47%). Of these,
seven NCVH and five control participants additionally
mentioned that they could understand the words, with five
in each group being able to accurately recall some of them.
During scanning, all participants remained awake and
responsive to the target stimuli, as indicated by the
button-press data. However, button-press responses for
four participants (one participant with NCVH, three con-
trol subjects) did not record correctly and one NCVH par-
ticipant accidentally pressed a button for every trial. There
were no group differences in total button presses, whether
or not the latter participant was included (all t 5 1.4, all
P 4 0.19). Participants with irregular button-press data
were marked and checked for their influence on group
comparisons of functional MRI data (see below). Only
one NCVH participant reported experiencing a hallucin-
ation during scanning (a visual hallucination, occurring
midway through Run 2); however, they did not report
this affecting their ability to complete the task.
On the post-scan behavioural task (i.e. after all partici-
pants had been trained to understand the SWS sentences),
no differences were observed between the groups, with
similar performance for speech discrimination (d’), the abil-
ity to comprehend intelligible SWS (keyword accuracy),
and bias to classify stimuli as speech (�; Supplementary
Table 2).
Functional MRI
Responses to intelligible and unintelligible sine-wave
speech over rest
Compared to rest, responses to intelligible (Fig. 2A) and
unintelligible (Fig. 2B) SWS activated an extensive bilateral
fronto-temporo-parietal network, including primary audi-
tory cortex, IFG, SMA, inferior parietal lobule, and poster-
ior
STG.
No
supra-threshold
group
differences
were
evident for either the combination of intelligible and unin-
telligible SWS versus rest (i.e. the main effect of group
during listening to sounds), nor any simple effects (i.e. the

 main effect of group during listening to intelligible-only
SWS versus rest and unintelligible-only SWS versus rest).
Intelligibility effect
Across both runs and groups, several regions were more
active for intelligible compared to unintelligible SWS, includ-
ing the left and right STG, the left middle temporal gyrus,
insula, precentral gyrus and IFG, as well as medial regions,
namely the pre-SMA, ACC, and superior frontal gyrus
(Table 2 and Fig. 2C). Between-groups comparisons of the
intelligibility
response
[Intelligible4 Unintelligible
SWS,
planned contrast (i)] indicated that NCVH participants
showed greater activation than controls in a cluster with
peaks in rostral ACC, extending to the pre-SMA, middle
cingulate cortex, and superior frontal gyrus (Table 2 and
Fig. 3C). That is, NCVH showed an enhanced discrimin-
ation between intelligible and unintelligible SWS within
these regions. Plotting the response of this cluster indicated
that the effect was mostly driven by increased responses to
intelligible SWS in NCVH (Fig. 3C, right). To further test
this observation, we directly compared the groups’ beta
values for this cluster within each SWS condition: voice-
hearers showed significantly greater responses than controls
for intelligible SWS [t(27) = 2.98, P = 0.006], but the groups
were
similar
for
unintelligible
SWS
[t(27) = �1.05,
P = 0.301]. The reverse contrast (Controls 4 NCVH) yielded
no significant clusters.
As some participants reported hearing speech before the
reveal, it could be that group differences evident in the
intelligibility response simply reflected NCVH participants
having more opportunity to listen to intelligible SWS in
‘speech mode’. To examine this, we reran the group com-
parison of Intelligible 4 Unintelligible SWS with the timing
of
participants’
noticing
of
speech—their
recognition
point—included as a covariate. The group difference in
ACC remained significant (MNI coordinates for peak
voxel:
�2,
32,
26,
k = 467,
t = 5.27,
z = 4.31,
PFWE 5 0.001), indicating that greater recruitment of this
region by NCVH participants was unlikely to simply reflect
a confound resulting from an earlier switch to speech
mode. We also confirmed that the pattern of findings re-
mained unchanged when excluding the participant who
pressed a button on every trial and those without a full
record of button presses; as such, all participants were re-
tained for the remainder of analyses.
The effect of the reveal: interaction between run and
intelligibility
With the two groups combined, there was a significant
interaction for the intelligibility response from Run 1 to
Run 2 in left pSTG (MNI coordinates for peak voxel:
�50, �48, 10, k = 790, t = 5.65, z = 4.55, PFWE 5 0.001;
see Fig. 3D). This change was specific to intelligible stimuli,
i.e. no effect was evident for the change in responses to
unintelligible stimuli (Fig. 3D, right). This pattern was con-
firmed in a follow-up analysis, after extracting beta values
for this cluster: responses to intelligible SWS were stronger
in Run 2 than in Run 1 [t(28) = �4.08, P 5 0.001], but
responses to unintelligible SWS were similar across runs
[t(28) = 0.12, P = 0.909].
There were no supra-threshold group differences for an
interaction effect from Run 1 to Run 2 [i.e. planned con-
trast (ii)]. That is, NCVH participants did not show a spe-
cific benefit in intelligibility once trained to listen for
speech, indicating that the effect of the reveal and subse-
quent training had a broadly similar influence on intelligi-
bility responses across groups. Even with a more liberal
threshold (P 5 0.001 peak level, uncorrected), no clusters
over 50 voxels were observed within grey matter.
In the separate analyses for Runs 1 and 2 [planned con-
trasts (iii) and (iv)] a clear intelligibility network was
observed for Run 2 but not Run 1 for both groups (Table
3), consistent with the non-significant interaction observed.
Contrary to what would be expected if group differences
were dependent on the explicit modulation of expectation,
NCVH already showed a stronger intelligibility response
than controls in Run 1, in the same ACC region as in the
overall analysis (MNI coordinates for peak voxel: 2, 36, 28,
k = 241, t = 5.14, PFWE = 0.008) and in left middle frontal
gyrus (MNI coordinates for peak voxel: �36, 54, 0, k = 190,
t = 4.91, PFWE = 0.024). Group differences in ACC for intel-
ligibility were also evident in Run 2, albeit at subthreshold
levels (MNI coordinates for peak voxel: �4, 38, 20, k = 51,
t = 4.12, P 5 0.001 uncorrected), which was consistent with
the general enhancement of an intelligibility effect across the
whole scanning session.

 Comparing responses in primary auditory cortex
The lack of supra-threshold group differences in responses
to intelligible or unintelligible stimuli over rest indicated
that basic auditory processes were broadly similar in con-
trols and NCVH. To explore this further, we extracted
average responses to intelligible and unintelligible sounds
in the bilateral primary auditory cortices (defined as TE
1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 based on the SPM Anatomy Toolbox)
and conducted Bayesian inference testing on effects of
group, intelligibility, and run. A Bayesian mixed ANOVA
was conducted using JASP (JASP Team, 2017), with the
default priors (Rouder et al., 2017). When a model con-
taining the group effect was compared to one without it
(i.e. the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor was 0.54, or
1:1.86 in favour of the null (in other words, the data
were almost twice as likely to occur under the null hypoth-
esis). Evidence for any group-related interaction effects was
even weaker: Bayes Factor values of 0.26, 0.26 and 0.57
were
observed
for
models
containing
group � run,
group � intelligibility, and group � run � intelligibility, re-
spectively (i.e. 1:3.85, 1:3.85 and 1:1.75 in favour of the
null). Bayes Factor values for each model were calculated
by comparing to the next most complex models lacking
those terms (i.e. the three-way interaction model was com-
pared with a model containing all two-way interactions;
Rouder et al., 2017). These values only reflect anecdotal
to substantial evidence in favour of the null hypothesis
(Jarosz and Wiley, 2014), but they nevertheless offer no
evidence at all in favour of potential group differences in
primary auditory cortex signal.

 Individual differences in intelligibility responses
To explore how early responders may have been identifying
speech in the SWS, we ran a whole-brain individual differ-
ences analysis, including recognition point as a regressor in
the Intelligible 4 Unintelligible SWS contrast. The intelligi-
bility response across Runs 1 and 2 in left IFG was nega-
tively related to the recognition point (indicating that those
who noticed speech earlier showed greater activation in
these regions; Fig. 4A and Table 4). For Run 1 only (i.e.
before all participants were in ‘speech mode’), the recogni-
tion point was negatively related to responses in the middle
cingulate cortex extending to parietal areas (Fig. 4B) and
positively related to activation in medial prefrontal cortex
(Fig. 4C). We also ran the same analysis for an index of
voice-hearing
in
the
NCVH
participants
(PSYRATS
Physical Characteristics from the past week; Haddock
et al., 1999; see Supplementary material); this indicated
no significant whole-brain correlations. However, a behav-
ioural correlation was observed between voice-hearing in
the past week and recognition point (r = �0.582, n = 12,
P = 0.047), such that a greater tendency to hear voices
was associated with noticing speech earlier in Run 1 (Fig.
1D). This correlation directly links auditory-perceptual pro-
cesses, as evaluated in the current study, with the magni-
tude of recent auditory verbal hallucinations.
Discussion
Despite decades of work on hallucinations, little is known
about how they relate to everyday perceptual mechanisms.
Our research aimed to address this by studying the inter-
action of expectation and perception in non-clinical voice-
hearers. Knowledge and expectations help us to interpret
ambiguous signals in a range of contexts; in some cases,
this might lead to non-veridical sensations, but in other
situations—such as hearing sine-wave speech—such expect-
ations might contribute to divining meaningful signal from
apparent noise (Davis and Johnsrude, 2007).
Behavioural evidence of NCVH hearing semantically con-
gruent (but absent) speech in white noise (Daalman et al.,
2012) and signal detection biases in people prone to hallu-
cinations (Brookwell et al., 2013) has been used to argue
for the existence of attentional factors—such as expectation
and prior knowledge—having a greater influence on per-
ception in people who hear voices. Our design, by initially
disguising the presence of speech from participants, allowed
us to examine whether such an influence can act spontan-
eously in NCVH, or requires the specific modulation of
expectation (in essence, a suggestibility effect). The subject-
ive behavioural responses of voice-hearers here—reporting
the detection of speech content in the acoustics of SWS
earlier than controls—suggest a spontaneous tendency in
this group to extract meaningful linguistic information
from ambiguous signals. Importantly, this finding is com-
plemented by distinct responses seen in brain activity, as
indicated by a stronger neural discrimination between in-
telligible and unintelligible SWS in NCVH participants.
This effect could be seen even before the reveal and train-
ing, so was therefore not dependent on the modulation of
expectation. Indeed, the comparable levels of discrimin-
ation and accuracy in the post-scanner task, and the ab-
sence of group differences in how the reveal and training
affected brain responses, suggest that the explicit modula-
tion of expectation does not play a major role in how
NCVH process ambiguous speech.
This appears to contrast with the evidence reported by
Teufel et al. (2015) that people with hallucinations benefit
more from the modulation of prior knowledge, although
both findings are potentially consistent with attention and
expectation playing a role in unusual perceptions. Under

 recent ‘predictive processing’ approaches (Clark, 2013),
perception is understood as the balanced product of expect-
ation-driven predictions (priors) about the external envir-
onment, and prediction error signals prompted by new
sensory information (Rao and Ballard, 1999; Hohwy,
2014). Most predictive processing models—of hallucination
specifically and psychosis more generally—posit a shift to-
wards prior expectations, perhaps as a response to inher-
ently unreliable prediction errors, or a top-down failure to
modulate their precision (Grossberg, 2000; Friston, 2005;
Fletcher and Frith, 2009; Adams et al., 2013; Corlett et al.,
2016; Powers et al., 2016). This is not always the case,
however: the circular inference model (Jardri and Dene
`ve,
2013a), for example, proposes that hallucinations and de-
lusions can result from an over-counting of sensory evi-
dence
instead,
leading
to
a confusion
of
priors
and
prediction errors (see also Jardri and Dene
`ve, 2013b;
Leptourgos et al., 2015; Jardri et al., 2016). Had our
data only indicated a modulatory effect of the reveal on
participants’
responses,
then
it
would
have
directly
supported an enhanced influence of new prior knowledge
in the perceptual processing of NCVH (as in Teufel et al.,
2015). Instead, the spontaneous orientation towards speech
that we observed could either be an indirect indicator of a
pre-existing prior for speech, or be explained by differences
in how the sensory signal is weighted. We did not observe
significant group differences in primary sensory regions,
either in whole-brain analysis or in follow-up Bayesian ana-
lysis. However, potential subtle differences in sensory
weighting cannot be definitely ruled out using the present
design. Further investigation of the intelligibility response
using a paradigm that measures prior probability, sensory
signal and participant response on a trial-by-trial basis
would be required to examine this (for a recent example
from decision-making, see Jardri et al., 2017).
Given the subjective nature of our in-scanner ‘recognition
point’ measure, the finding that group differences in the
neural responses to SWS were specific to potentially intel-
ligible signals is key. It suggests that NCVH were not
simply biased to report perceiving speech in any signal,

 and constrains the discussion of the potential mechanisms
driving speech perception in voice-hearers. The lack of dif-
ferences for any of the separate conditions versus rest, or
any differences specific to primary auditory cortical regions,
suggests that early auditory processes alone were unlikely
to be driving group differences in intelligibility. However,
speech areas that are usually associated with effects of prior
knowledge and expectation—such as left inferior frontal
cortex (Obleser and Kotz, 2010)—also showed no group
differences. Instead, differences were seen in a region of
rostral ACC, extending dorsally and caudally to reach the
anterior pre-SMA and superior frontal gyrus.
Although part of the evolutionarily older midline vocal-
ization network (Schulz et al., 2005), the ACC is not a
classical speech processing area. Nevertheless, ACC re-
sponses have been observed for listening to distorted
speech (Davis and Johnsrude, 2003), and ACC activation
correlates with the accurate categorization of phonemes
under adverse listening conditions (Du et al., 2014). In hal-
lucinations research, the ACC has been associated with the
monitoring and generation of internal and external speech
(Simons et al., 2010), and linked to the occurrence of audi-
tory verbal hallucinations, via atypical modulation of sen-
sory regions (for a review see Allen et al., 2007). ACC
activation has been observed during epochs of spontaneous
activity in voice-selective areas of auditory cortex in healthy
individuals (Hunter et al., 2006), ‘self-induced’ auditory
hallucinations in hypnosis-prone people (Szechtman et al.,
1998), and auditory attention in people with sleep-related
hallucinations (Lewis-Hanna et al., 2011). ACC involve-
ment was also observed in a number of early symptom-
capture
studies
of
people
hearing
voices
while
being
scanned (Shergill et al., 2000), although later meta-analyses
have failed to consistently identify this region during the
hallucinatory state (Jardri et al., 2011; Ku
¨hn and Gallinat,
2012; Zmigrod et al., 2016).
The ACC is associated with a range of processes includ-
ing attention, error monitoring, affect, and cognitive con-
trol (Devinsky et al., 1995). The dorsal, ‘cognitive’ ACC
has been proposed to monitor task responses and attention,
modulating selection bias and rule application in lateral
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and inferior frontal cortex respect-
ively (Langner and Eickhoff, 2013). Rostral areas of dorsal
ACC appear sensitive to conflicts in response driven by
irrelevant stimuli, while more caudal areas manage the al-
location of attention (Orr and Weissman, 2009). The ex-
tension of this cluster into parts of pre-SMA is also notable
given this area’s prior implication in symptom-capture stu-
dies of auditory verbal hallucinations (Linden et al., 2011;

 Raij
and
Riekki,
2012),
monitoring
of
inner
speech
(McGuire et al., 1996), and the generation of sensorimotor
predictions that guide and optimize perceptual processes
(Lima et al., 2016). The presence of dorsal ACC and pre-
SMA together in the voice-hearer response may imply a
greater attentional capture and sensorimotor processing of
speech-like stimuli.
The individual difference results also provide clues as to
how participants in both groups were able to identify
speech in the SWS. Relationships between the recognition
point when speech was noticed and activity in left IFG,
medial PFC, and middle cingulate cortex (MCC) imply
the
involvement
of
both
speech-motor
processes
and
amodal, ‘default mode’ regions (Raichle et al., 2001). The
negative correlation with left IFG activation is consistent
with the deployment of this region for parsing speech in
adverse listening conditions, and may reflect the accessing
of word meanings and segments to support perception via
prior knowledge (Davis and Johnsrude, 2003; Obleser and
Kotz, 2010; Sohoglu et al., 2012; Du et al., 2014). For
instance, Eisner et al. (2010) found that the recruitment
of the left IFG predicts individual differences in the lis-
teners’ ability to decode vocoded and spectrally shifted
speech. Activity in the medial PFC, in contrast, is often
linked with the default mode network (DMN) and would
be consistent with participants taking longer to notice po-
tentially intelligible SWS due to a lack of external engage-
ment (Buckner et al., 2008). The MCC cluster observed
here is at the rostral border of the posterior cingulate
cortex (PCC) and is sometimes classified as part of the
dorsal subdivision of Brodmann area 23 (Cauda et al.,
2010), which is distinguished from ventral PCC regions
posterior to the splenium (Vogt, 2016). Although the
PCC and surrounding posterior midline structures are
also associated with DMN-like task-negative activity, its
dorsal subcomponents have been linked to networks re-
sponsible for cognitive control and external attention
(Cauda et al., 2010; Leech et al., 2011; Leech and Sharp,
2014).
Some limitations of the present study must be acknowl-
edged. First, for practical reasons—and because of the
goals of the experiment—the behavioural assessment of
participants’ ability to discriminate and understand SWS
had to be conducted outside the scanner and followed a
long period of training and exposure to the stimuli. As
such, it is possible that any post-scan group differences
were masked or trained out as a result of the procedure,
given that decoding of other kinds of degraded auditory
stimuli—such as noise-vocoded speech—can improve over
time and with training (Davis et al., 2005). However, nei-
ther group performed at ceiling on the post-scan task: key-
word accuracy after scanning was reasonably low in both
groups compared to prior studies using distorted speech
(McGettigan et al., 2012), despite the fact that speech/
non-speech discrimination was good. In future studies it
will be important to assess NCVH participants’ abilities
to decode SWS under a variety of listening conditions to
measure decoding skill and adaptation more directly.
Second, we are reliant on the accuracy of participants’
self-reports to gauge when participants noticed speech
during Run 1, and cannot know for sure what participants
were responding to when ‘hearing’ speech. Relying on self-
report data is not uncommon in hallucinations research
and retrospective reporting of events in the scanner has
been used successfully to identify periods of voice-hearing
(Jardri et al., 2013). Nevertheless, it is possible that NCVH
participants were just more likely to class any unusual sti-
muli as speech, rather than intelligible stimuli specifically.
Two pieces of evidence militate against such an interpret-
ation, though: first, the lack of any general group differ-
ences in the neural response to stimuli versus baseline (i.e.
across both intelligible and unintelligible SWS), and second,
the lack of any evident speech bias on the post-scan behav-
ioural task. Notably, our brain data provide evidence in
favour of a selective effect for the discrimination of intelli-
gible stimuli: an effect that is hard to account by positing a
non-specific response bias. Future studies could further ad-
dress the selectivity of the behavioural effect by testing
whether differences in recognition point also exist for a
run without potentially intelligible SWS (this would be evi-
dence for a non-specific bias), or by assessing degraded
speech perception skills more comprehensively prior to
training (e.g. Boebinger et al., 2015). Including such condi-
tions in the current study would have compromised our
ability to test naı
¨ve participants’ spontaneous responses to
ambiguous stimuli.
Finally, we were restricted to a smaller sample of partici-
pants in the present study than is generally recommended
for clinical functional MRI research (Carter et al., 2008)
and for group comparisons in general functional MRI stu-
dies (Poldrack et al., 2017). Recruitment for neuroimaging
studies with NCVH groups is extremely challenging: the
present sample size is larger than other recent studies
(Linden et al., 2011; Kompus et al., 2013), with the excep-
tion of the Utrecht cohort (Diederen et al., 2012). Prior
NCVH imaging studies have largely confined task-based
functional
MRI
investigations
to
symptom
capture
(Linden et al., 2011; Diederen et al., 2012) or basic cogni-
tive paradigms, such as dichotic listening (Kompus et al.,
2013) or verbal fluency (Diederen et al., 2010), often with
recourse to region of interest analysis and other methods of
constraining analysis (and statistical corrections) to selected
brain regions. To our knowledge, this is the first NCVH
study to have successfully combined a complex behavioural
paradigm with imaging data to examine a potential mech-
anism underlying hallucination, and while maintaining con-
servative
whole-brain
corrections.
Nevertheless,
small
sample sizes in neuroimaging research with clinical and
non-clinical voice-hearers is an enduring problem. As we
have advocated elsewhere (Alderson-Day et al., 2016) the
combination of functional MRI data from multiple labora-
tories provides one means of addressing this issue. The

 (ICHR) is currently supporting ongoing mega-analytic pro-
jects involving the combination of task-based, resting-state
and structural MRI data from people with auditory verbal
hallucinations (Thomas et al., 2016).
Notwithstanding the small sample size of the present
study, it is also important to note that the general response
to
intelligibility—and
general
effects
of
training
with
SWS—involved regions consistent with previous research
on distorted speech. The primarily left-lateralized network
seen across both groups is consistent with intelligibility ef-
fects using very similar stimuli (McGettigan et al., 2012), as
is the involvement of the SMA (Rosen et al., 2011). The
involvement of left posterior STG seen specifically follow-
ing
training
also
replicates
prior
findings
using
SWS
(Mo
¨tto
¨nen et al., 2006). Thus, in general, these two
groups of participants showed plausible responses to the
challenge of interpreting SWS.
In conclusion, the present study represents a first step in
the understanding of atypical auditory-perceptual processes
in people who regularly hear voices but do not require
mental health support. Such individuals do not appear to
be differentially affected by explicit modulations of expect-
ation—instead, people in this group report being able to
spontaneously extract speech from degraded auditory sig-
nals (and report doing so earlier than matched controls).
This finding is broadly consistent with predictive processing
models of hallucination and perception. The functional
MRI results indicate that this capacity appears to rely less
on enhanced speech-specific feedback to auditory regions,
and more on the engagement of sensorimotor and domain-
general attentional resources, selectively for potentially in-
telligible speech stimuli. This suggests that the fundamental
mechanisms underlying hallucination involve—and may de-
velop from—ordinary perceptual processes, illustrating the
continuity of mundane and unusual experience. It has im-
plications not only for ‘continuum’ views of experiences
usually associated with psychosis (Johns and van Os,
2001), but also for the normalization, interpretation, and
public
understanding
of
a
seriously
misunderstood
phenomenon.
