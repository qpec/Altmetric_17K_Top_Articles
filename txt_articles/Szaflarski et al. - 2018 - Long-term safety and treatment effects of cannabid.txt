Summary
Objective: Since 2014, cannabidiol (CBD) has been administered to patients with
treatment‐resistant epilepsies (TREs) in an ongoing expanded‐access program
(EAP). We report interim results on the safety and efficacy of CBD in EAP
patients treated through December 2016.
Methods: Twenty‐five US‐based EAP sites enrolling patients with TRE taking
stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included. During the
4‐week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure
types. Patients received oral CBD starting at 2‐10 mg/kg/d, titrated to a maximum
dose of 25‐50 mg/kg/d. Patient visits were every 2‐4 weeks through 16 weeks and
every 2‐12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy endpoints included the percentage change
from baseline in median monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency, and per-
centage of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in seizures vs base-
line. Data were analyzed descriptively for the efficacy analysis set and using the
last‐observation‐carried‐forward method to account for missing data. Adverse
events (AEs) were documented at each visit.
Results: Of 607 patients in the safety dataset, 146 (24%) withdrew; the most com-
mon reasons were lack of efficacy (89 [15%]) and AEs (32 [5%]). Mean age was
13 years (range, 0.4‐62). Median number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range, 0‐10).
Median CBD dose was 25 mg/kg/d; median treatment duration was 48 weeks. Add‐
on CBD reduced median monthly convulsive seizures by 51% and total seizures by
48% at 12 weeks; reductions were similar through 96 weeks. Proportion of patients
with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions in convulsive seizures were 52%, 31%, and
11%, respectively, at 12 weeks, with similar rates through 96 weeks. CBD was gener-
ally well tolerated; most common AEs were diarrhea (29%) and somnolence (22%).

INTRODUCTION
Antiseizure drugs, referred to commonly as antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs), provide only partial relief of seizures in treat-
ment‐resistant epilepsies (TRE), frequently at the cost of
severe adverse effects (AEs). Newer AEDs seek to improve
efficacy and/or reduce these AEs. To date, a pharmaceutical
formulation of highly purified cannabidiol (CBD) has
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile,1–4 but additional
long‐term safety and efficacy data are needed.
The therapeutic potential of CBD as an AED has been
of great interest, particularly for TREs. Preclinical studies
in animal models5,6 and open‐label studies2,7,8 suggest that
CBD has antiseizure properties in a broad range of epilep-
sies. Recent findings from 3, phase 3 clinical trials showed
that add‐on CBD was efficacious for seizures associated
with
Lennox‐Gastaut
syndrome
(LGS)3,4
and
Dravet
syndrome (DS).1
In January 2014, an expanded access program (EAP)
was initiated to provide CBD to patients with TRE. During
the first year of the study, the primary objective was to
establish the safety and tolerability of CBD, and the sec-
ondary objective was to obtain preliminary efficacy data,
which have been reported previously.2 Herein we provide
an update, reporting pooled results for safety outcomes up
to 144 weeks and efficacy endpoints up to 96 weeks in
more than 600 patients treated through December 2016.

METHODS
2.1 | Study design and patient population
This open‐label EAP included 29 individual physician‐ or
state‐initiated Investigational New Drug (IND) applications,
conducted at 25 US‐based epilepsy centers. Patient eligibility
criteria and endpoints varied by site‐specific protocols, but
all patients had TRE and were receiving stable doses of
AEDs for ≥4 weeks before enrollment. An institutional
review board at each site approved the study protocols, and
patients or parents/caregivers provided written informed con-
sent before any study‐related assessments were performed.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice
guidelines, and local standard operating procedures.
2.2 | Procedures
During the 4‐week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept
diaries of all countable seizure types.
Data were collected on convulsive and total seizures.
Convulsive seizures were defined as tonic, clonic, tonic–
clonic, atonic, or secondary generalized. Not all patients
reported convulsive seizures. Nonconvulsive seizures were
defined as myoclonic, absence, or myoclonic‐absence sei-
zures, and focal seizures with or without impaired con-
sciousness. Concomitant AEDs were recorded at baseline;
dose modifications were allowed and recorded during fol-
low‐up. After the baseline observation period, patients
received a plant‐derived, pharmaceutical formulation of
purified CBD (100 mg/mL) in oral solution (Epidiolex;
GW Research Ltd) at a gradually increasing dose starting
at 2‐10 mg/kg/d until tolerability limit or a maximum dose
of 25‐50 mg/kg/d, depending on the site.
Patients were seen every 2‐4 weeks through week 16
and every 2‐12 weeks thereafter. For each visit, there was
a prespecified target day and visit window. If more than 1
visit occurred within a particular window, the data from
the visit closest to the target day were used. If there were 2
visits within equal distance from the target day, the data
Key Points
• Of the 607 patients treated (median treatment
duration 48 weeks; range 2-146 weeks), 76% of
patients remained on treatment
• Cannabidiol (CBD) was associated with 51% and
48% reductions in median monthly convulsive
and total seizures, respectively, after 12 weeks of
treatment
• Reductions in median monthly convulsive and
total seizures were similar among visit windows
through 96 weeks of treatment
• At visits between weeks 12 and 96, inclusive,
the ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% response rates were
notable and similar among time points
• Overall, CBD was generally well tolerated; treat-
ment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were con-
sistent with those reported previously

 were averaged for these visits. Some sites collected data at
2 and 4 weeks; therefore, it was assumed that the 4‐weeks
of data were reported as weeks 2‐4, for the most conserva-
tive estimate.
2.3 | Assessment of efficacy
Seizure frequency per week since the previous visit was
provided by each site. For this report, all efficacy outcomes
were assessed for the 12‐, 24‐, 48‐, 72‐, and 96‐week visit
windows based on data available since the prior visit. For
convulsive and total seizures, weekly seizure frequency
was converted to frequency per 28 days (weekly fre-
quency × 4). Percentage change in seizure frequency for
each patient was calculated as ([seizure frequency per
28 days] − [seizure frequency at baseline]) / [seizure fre-
quency at baseline] × 100. Due to the wide interpatient
variability, median percentage changes in seizure frequency
were calculated. Response rates were calculated as the pro-
portions of patients who had at least 50%, 75%, and 100%
reduction in monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency
compared to baseline.
2.4 | Assessment of dose
The use of concomitant AEDs was evaluated for 8 of the
most commonly used agents (clobazam, lamotrigine, topira-
mate, rufinamide, valproic acid, levetiracetam, stiripentol,
and felbamate). Total daily dose, summarized on a continu-
ous scale, was recorded at baseline and during the treat-
ment period. For each AED, results are presented for
the number of patients with a stable dose at each visit, the
number of patients with reduced dose at any time, and the
number of patients with increased dose at any time.
2.5 | Assessment of safety
Treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) were monitored and
classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA, V17.1). Clinical laboratory parame-
ters and vital signs were evaluated at regular time points
during the study. Incidences of AEs, serious AEs, AEs
leading to discontinuation, and AEs occurring in >10% of
patients were assessed. In addition, the incidence of somno-
lence/sedation was assessed by concomitant clobazam use.
2.6 | Analysis
Sample size was not predetermined but based on patient
enrollment at the study sites. The safety analysis set was
composed of all patients who had ≥1 dose of CBD and ≥1
postbaseline evaluation. All patients in the safety analysis
set who had >0 seizures at baseline and seizure data for
≥1 postbaseline visit were included in the efficacy analysis
set. A last‐observation‐carried‐forward (LOCF) analysis
was performed using the data from the last available visit
window for all patients with postbaseline efficacy data for
convulsive seizures (462/580) and total seizures (575/580).

RESULTS
Between January 15, 2014 and December 16, 2016, 607
patients were enrolled in the EAP at US‐based sites; the
median number of patients per site was 18 (range 1‐61).
The safety analysis included 607 patients; the efficacy anal-
ysis included 580 patients. Of 607 patients in the safety
dataset, 146 (24%) withdrew, mostly due to lack of efficacy
(89 [15%]) or AEs (32 [5%]; Figure 1). Withdrawals were
spread evenly across the treatment windows (Table S1).
Because the EAP is ongoing, this analysis includes patients
with a range of treatment duration (2‐146 weeks); median
(25th percentile [Q1], 75th percentile [Q3]) treatment dura-
tion was 48 (23, 95) weeks, with efficacy data available
through 96 weeks for 138 patients. Table 1 shows the base-
line demographic and clinical characteristics of patients
included in the safety and efficacy analyses. In both
groups, mean age was 13 years (range 0.4‐62 years), and
52% of patients were male. A broad range of etiologies
were included. The median number of concomitant AEDs
taken at baseline was 3 (range 0‐10), and the most com-
mon
medications
were
clobazam
(51%),
levetiracetam
(34%), and valproic acid (29%; including semi‐sodium val-
proate, sodium valproate). A full listing of concomitant
AEDs taken by ≥3% of patients is provided in Table S2.
At baseline, the median (Q1, Q3) monthly frequency of
convulsive and total seizures was 43 (12, 112) and 72 (22,
196), respectively (Table 1). After 12 weeks of treatment,
the median monthly frequency of convulsive seizures was
reduced by 51% and the frequency of total seizures was
reduced by 48% (Figure 2A). For both convulsive and total
seizures, median percentage reductions in monthly fre-
quency were similar at each visit window through 96 weeks.
Results from the LOCF analysis of median percentage sei-
zure reduction showed that the observed reductions in sei-
zure frequency were not affected by dropouts (Figure 2B).
For convulsive seizures, the percentage of patients with
≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reductions compared to baseline
were 52%, 31%, and 11%, respectively, at week 12. For
total seizures, the percentage of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%,
and 100% reductions were 49%, 30%, and 6%, respectively,
at week 12 (Figure 3A). Response rates for convulsive and
total seizures were similar during the 12‐ through 96‐week
visit windows even when accounting for withdrawals in the
LOCF analysis (Figure 3B). The percentage of patients
with an increase in seizure frequency (ie, >0% change from
1542 |

 baseline) was similar for the 12‐, 24‐, 48‐, 72‐, and 96‐
week visit windows, ranging from 20%‐27% for convulsive
seizures and 19%‐25% for total seizures. Corresponding
ranges for the LOCF analysis were 23%‐29% and 24%‐
27%, respectively.
The median dose of CBD between weeks 12 and 96 (in-
clusive) was 25 mg/kg/d. Fifty‐five percent (330/605) of
patients reduced their dose of CBD at any time during fol-
low‐up. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation [SD])
doses were 32 (19) mg/d for clobazam and 891 (528) mg/d
for valproate. Approximately half of the patients taking
concomitant clobazam (181/305) and valproate (88/176)
reduced their dose from baseline during the study. Among
those taking concomitant levetiracetam, most remained on
their
baseline
dose
(mean
[SD],
1986
[1552] mg/d;
Table 2).
In the safety analysis group, with a median treatment
duration of 48 weeks (range 2‐146 weeks), 88% of all
patients experienced treatment‐emergent AEs and 33% expe-
rienced serious AEs (Table 3). The most commonly reported
all‐cause AEs were diarrhea (29%), somnolence (22%), and
convulsion (17%). The most common all‐cause serious AEs
were convulsion (9%), status epilepticus (7%), pneumonia
(5%), and vomiting (3%). Abnormal liver AEs (ie, alanine
aminotransferase/aspartate
aminotransferase
>3 × upper
limit of normal) were reported for 10% (61/607) of patients;
of these, 46 (75%) were on valproate. Ten percent (61/607)
of patients had ≥1 of the MedDRA Preferred Terms for
pneumonia; no patients discontinued treatment due to pneu-
monia. Of patients taking concomitant clobazam, 38% (123/
320) experienced somnolence compared to 14% (40/287)

DISCUSSION
This second interim analysis of the pooled EAP data, in
which 138 patients had efficacy data available through
96 weeks, demonstrates that add‐on CBD can provide clini-
cally meaningful and sustained reductions in the frequency
of convulsive and total seizures across multiple epilepsy
etiologies. The high proportions of patients achieving
≥50% and ≥75% reductions in seizure frequency were con-
sistent at each visit window. Even in this highly treatment‐
resistant
population,
during
each
visit
window,
some
patients reported 100% seizure reduction from baseline for
the period since their prior visit.
Cannabidiol was generally well tolerated. AE rates were
similar to those reported in the initial analysis of the EAP,
as well as to those reported in randomized controlled trials,
with the most common AEs being somnolence and diar-
rhea. The most common serious AEs were convulsion
(9%), status epilepticus (7%), pneumonia (5%), and vomit-
ing (3%), which is consistent with previous reports on
patients with severe TREs.1–4 The overall incidence of AEs
was markedly lower in the <10 mg/kg/d group than the
other dose groups. In addition, the incidences of somno-
lence and diarrhea tended to increase with increasing dose,
suggesting a dose effect.
During the follow‐up period, which extended through
2 years for some patients (median treatment duration of
48 weeks), 76% of patients remained on treatment. This
retention rate compares favorably to other AED trials in
TREs (63%‐72%).9,10 This is possibly due to maintenance
of long‐term efficacy and/or adverse events that were gen-
erally mild; improvements in quality of life11,12 and seizure

 severity13 also have been reported with CBD, likely result-
ing in better retention. Withdrawals were spread relatively
consistently through the study follow‐up period, and the
LOCF sensitivity analysis demonstrated consistent reduc-
tions in seizure frequency when data from withdrawn
patients were carried through the 96‐week visit window.
Although CBD dose fluctuated during the study with over
half of the patients reducing their dose at some point, the
median dose remained stable (25 mg/kg/d) at all time
points assessed. Unfortunately, the reasons for CBD dose
decreases were not consistently recorded.
Cannabidiol has a bidirectional drug–drug interaction
with clobazam. It inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19
and increases levels of the nordesmethyl metabolite of clo-
bazam, which has biologic activity.14 In addition, clobazam
has been shown to increase levels of CBD's metabolite, 7‐
hydroxy‐CBD.15 Our patients on concomitant clobazam
reported over twice the incidence of somnolence than those
not taking clobazam. However, only 1 patient discontinued
treatment due to somnolence.
Seventy‐five percent of the patients with liver‐related
AEs
were
taking
concomitant
valproic
acid.
Several
patients who experienced elevation of liver function tests
during the EAP were re‐titrated to the baseline CBD dose
after valproic acid was discontinued and did not experience
any further liver enzyme abnormalities,14 although it should
be noted the data related to re‐titration were not consis-
tently collected. A dose‐ranging safety study of CBD in the
treatment of the DS showed that CBD had no effect on
systemic levels of valproate, which suggests that the inter-
action between CBD and valproic acid may be pharmaco-
dynamic rather than pharmacokinetic.16
Most patients taking concomitant clobazam and valproate
reduced their doses during the follow‐up, potentially reflect-
ing either the higher incidence of certain AEs observed when
these AEDs are administered concomitantly with CBD or
the desire of patients to wean from poly‐drug therapy when
seizures become better controlled. In addition, a possible

 interaction between CBD and warfarin necessitating Interna-
tional Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring in 1 patient from
this EAP has been described previously.17
The study has several limitations. The EAP is not pla-
cebo‐controlled and the investigators and the patients are
not blinded. Moreover, there was intersite variability in
reporting methods, and information such as the reasons for
AED dose reductions was not captured. Although parents/
caregivers reported only the specific seizures that were
countable, some seizure types that can be difficult to count
(eg, absence) were included in the total seizure frequency
data. In some of the site protocols, enrollment was depen-
dent
on
predetermined
seizure
frequency,
which
was
known to possible participants; hence, baseline overreport-
ing cannot be completely excluded in this prospective data
collection. Nevertheless, the pooled data across the EAP
provides initial insights on the long‐term treatment effect
of CBD that support the recent evidence from rigorous,
double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials showing meaningful
reductions in seizure frequency for patients who received
add‐on CBD vs placebo.
