BACKGROUND
Thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke with a lower-than-standard dose 
of intravenous alteplase may improve recovery along with a reduced risk of intra-
cerebral hemorrhage.
METHODS
Using a 2-by-2 quasi-factorial open-label design, we randomly assigned 3310 patients 
who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy (median age, 67 years; 63% Asian) to low-
dose intravenous alteplase (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or the standard dose 
(0.9 mg per kilogram); patients underwent randomization within 4.5 hours after the 
onset of stroke. The primary objective was to determine whether the low dose would 
be noninferior to the standard dose with respect to the primary outcome of death or 
disability at 90 days, which was defined by scores of 2 to 6 on the modified Rankin 
scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Secondary objectives were to determine 
whether the low dose would be superior to the standard dose with respect to centrally 
adjudicated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and whether the low dose would be 
noninferior in an ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale scores (testing for an im-
provement in the distribution of scores). The trial included 935 patients who were also 
randomly assigned to intensive or guideline-recommended blood-pressure control.
RESULTS
The primary outcome occurred in 855 of 1607 participants (53.2%) in the low-dose 
group and in 817 of 1599 participants (51.1%) in the standard-dose group (odds ratio, 
1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.25; the upper boundary exceeded the non-
inferiority margin of 1.14; P 
= 
0.51 for noninferiority). Low-dose alteplase was noninfe-
rior in the ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale scores (unadjusted common odds 
ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13; P 
= 
0.04 for noninferiority). Major symptomatic intra-
cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1.0% of the participants in the low-dose group and in 
2.1% of the participants in the standard-dose group (P 
= 
0.01); fatal events occurred 
within 7 days in 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively (P 
= 
0.01). Mortality at 90 days did not dif-
fer significantly between the two groups (8.5% and 10.3%, respectively; P 
= 
0.07).
CONCLUSIONS
This trial involving predominantly Asian patients with acute ischemic stroke did 
not show the noninferiority of low-dose alteplase to standard-dose alteplase with 
respect to death and disability at 90 days. There were significantly fewer symptom-
atic intracerebral hemorrhages with low-dose alteplase. (Funded by the National

hrombolytic therapy with intrave-
nous alteplase (recombinant tissue-type 
plasminogen activator) at a dose of 0.9 mg 
per kilogram of body weight is an effective treat-
ment for acute ischemic stroke, despite increasing 
the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage.1-3 However, 
the Japanese drug safety authority has approved 
the use of alteplase at a dose of 0.6 mg per kilo-
gram after an uncontrolled, open-label study 
showed that this dose resulted in equivalent clini-
cal outcomes and a lower risk of intracerebral 
hemorrhage than that reported in published stud-
ies in which the 0.9-mg-per-kilogram dose was 
used.4 Other registry studies in Asia5-11 have shown 
inconsistent results, but a high risk of symptom-
atic intracerebral hemorrhage was observed among 
Asian patients treated with 0.9 mg of alteplase per 
kilogram in the United States.12 Differing perceived 
risks of intracerebral hemorrhage and treatment 
affordability have led to variations in the doses of 
intravenous alteplase used to treat patients with 
acute ischemic stroke in Asia.8-11
The Enhanced Control of Hypertension and 
Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) was 
designed to compare low-dose with standard-dose 
intravenous alteplase in patients with acute ische-
mic stroke. Using a quasi-factorial design, we are 
also assessing the effects of early intensive low-
ering of blood pressure as compared with guide-
line-recommended management in patients with 
elevated blood pressure; this part of the trial is 
scheduled to be completed in 2018. We report the 
results of the alteplase part of the trial, which was 
completed in December 2015.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
In an international, multicenter, prospective, ran-
domized, open-label trial with blinded outcome 
evaluation, two doses of intravenous alteplase were 
compared in patients with an acute ischemic 
stroke who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy; 
administration of the drug was commenced within 
4.5 hours after the onset of the stroke. Patients 
with elevated systolic blood pressure (range, 150 to 
220 mm Hg) could also be randomly assigned to 
early and intensive lowering of blood pressure (tar-
get systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg within 
1 hour) or conventional guideline-directed man-
agement of blood pressure (target systolic blood 
pressure <180 mm Hg) with the use of locally 
available intravenous agents.
Details of the design and statistical analysis 
plan of the trial have been published previously.13,14 
An international steering committee, whose mem-
bers designed the trial with an advisory commit-
tee, was responsible for the conduct and report-
ing of the trial. The George Institute for Global 
Health coordinated the trial, managed the data-
base, and performed the analyses. The study drug 
used (alteplase) was that available for routine use 
at clinical centers; there was no commercial input 
into any aspect of the trial. The first author wrote 
the first and subsequent drafts of the manuscript. 
All the authors commented on drafts of the manu-
script, approved the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication, and vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and for the fidelity 
of this report to the trial protocol (available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
The trial protocol was approved by all appro-
priate regulatory authorities and ethics commit-
tees at the participating centers. All participants, 
or an approved surrogate for those who were too 
unwell to comprehend the information, provided 
written informed consent. Details of the moni-
toring procedures are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix (available at NEJM.org).
Patients and Procedures
Patients were recruited at 111 clinical centers in 
13 countries. Patients were eligible if they were 
18 years of age or older, had an acute ischemic 
stroke, and met guideline-recommended criteria 
for treatment with intravenous alteplase. For de-
tails of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, see 
the Supplementary Appendix.
After confirmation of patient eligibility, ran-
domization was performed centrally with the use 
of a minimization algorithm according to center, 
time from stroke onset (<3 vs. ≥3 hours), and se-
verity of neurologic impairment (score of <10 vs. 
≥10 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke 
Scale [NIHSS]; range, 0 to 42, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity of stroke). Participants 
were randomly assigned to receive either a stan-
dard dose of intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg per ki-
logram of estimated, or measured, body weight; 
10% as a bolus and 90% as an infusion over a pe-
riod of 60 minutes; maximum dose, 90 mg) or a 
low dose (0.6 mg per kilogram, 15% as a bolus and 
85% as an infusion over a period of 60 minutes; 
maximum dose, 60 mg), to be commenced within 
4.5 hours after symptom onset. Concomitant 
therapy followed national practice guidelines, in-

cluding the use of endovascular thrombectomy 
devices, where approved.
Demographic and clinical data were obtained 
at the time of randomization. Follow-up data were 
obtained at 24 and 72 hours (including repeat 
NIHSS scores and measured body weight) and at 
7 days (or hospital discharge, if sooner), 28 days, 
and 90 days, unless death occurred earlier. The 
28-day and 90-day evaluations were conducted in 
person or by telephone, by trained and certified 
staff who remained unaware of the randomized 
treatment assignments. Brain imaging was per-
formed at trial entry and at 24 hours, and addition-
ally if clinically indicated, and was analyzed cen-
trally for any hemorrhage by expert assessors who 
were unaware of the treatment assignments 
(see the Supplementary Appendix).
Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome was the com-
bined end point of death or disability at 90 days, 
which was defined by scores of 2 to 6 on the 
modified Rankin scale,15 a global seven-level mea-
sure of functioning in which scores of 0 or 1 in-
dicate a good outcome with no or minimal neu-
rologic symptoms, scores of 2 to 5 indicate a poor 
outcome with increasing degree of disability, and 
6 indicates death. The key secondary outcome, 
which was also designated as a safety outcome, 
was intracerebral hemorrhage, defined according 
to criteria from a number of other studies (see the 
Supplementary Appendix); the main definition of 
intracerebral hemorrhage that we used was the 
definition in the Safe Implementation of Throm-
bolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST)16: 
a large local or remote parenchymal pattern 
(>30% of the infarcted area affected by hemor-
rhage, with mass effect or extension outside the 
infarct) and neurologic deterioration from base-
line (increase of ≥4 points in the NIHSS score) 
or death within 36 hours. This definition was 
finalized and described in the statistical analysis 
plan of our trial after publication of the original 
protocol.
Other secondary efficacy outcomes were the 
distribution of modified Rankin scale scores at 
90 days,17 major disability (modified Rankin scale 
score >2) at 90 days, deaths at 7 days and 90 days, 
neurologic deterioration (increase of ≥4 points 
in the NIHSS score) during the 72 hours after 
randomization, death and neurologic deteriora-
tion (increase of ≥4 points in the NIHSS score) 
during the 72 hours after randomization, health-
related quality of life on the EuroQoL Group 
5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D; 
summary health utility scores range from −0.109 
to 1, with higher scores indicating better health)18 
at 90 days (for details on scoring, see the Supple-
mentary Appendix), length of initial hospital stay, 
recurrent acute myocardial infarction and recur-
rent ischemic stroke, admission to a long-term 
residential care facility at 90 days, and use of 
health services (for economic analyses that have 
not yet been conducted). Prespecified safety out-
comes were all serious adverse events reported 
until trial completion. Tertiary outcomes included 
all-cause mortality, place of death, trends in modi-
fied Rankin scale scores during follow-up, length 
of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), rate of 
thrombectomy, and individual items of the EQ-5D.
Statistical Analysis
We designed the trial to assess the effects of two 
treatment variables — alteplase dose and inten-
sity of blood-pressure control — on clinical out-
comes, accounting for their potential interaction.14 
Differential patient recruitment resulted in the 
part of the trial dealing with alteplase dose be-
ing completed faster than the part dealing with 
intensity of blood-pressure control. For the pri-
mary analysis, we used an unadjusted logistic-
regression model to test whether low-dose al-
teplase was noninferior to the standard dose. To 
satisfy the noninferiority hypothesis, the upper 
boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the 
odds ratio of the outcome with low-dose alteplase 
as compared with standard-dose alteplase had to 
fall below a margin of 1.14; this noninferiority 
margin was derived from a Cochrane meta-analy-
ses of alteplase trials with effects on poor out-
comes reported.19,20 We estimated that a sample 
size of 3300 patients would provide at least 90% 
power to evaluate noninferiority, assuming 5% 
dropout and potential negative interaction be-
tween intensive blood-pressure control and low-
dose alteplase, and would also provide at least 80% 
power to detect superiority of low-dose alteplase 
in achieving a 40% lower risk of symptomatic 
intracerebral hemorrhage than that with standard-
dose alteplase, with 5% dropout. Consistency of 
treatment effect across 10 prespecified subgroups 
was assessed through tests for interaction.
A secondary efficacy analysis was a compari-
son of ordinal scores on the modified Rankin 
scale to test for the noninferiority of the low dose 
to the standard dose with the use of ordinal lo-

gistic regression, after the assumption of propor-
tionality of the odds was confirmed in a likeli-
hood-ratio test.17 A new assumption-free approach21 
was used to confirm the conclusion. We also 
performed secondary analyses of the primary 
outcome with adjustment for minimization and 
key prognostic covariates14, as well as secondary 
analyses in the per-protocol population according 
to criteria outlined in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. Multiple imputation was to be used if more 
than 10% of observations were missing. An inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring board moni-
tored the trial progress and safety with the use 
of formal stopping boundaries. For ease of inter-
pretation, all reported P values for noninferiority 
are multiplied by 2 so that an alpha of 0.05 can 
be used in analyses. The other P values (those for 
superiority) are two-sided. All P values were pre-
specified not to be adjusted. SAS software, version 
9.3 (SAS Institute), was used for analyses.
Results
Patients
From March 2012 through August 2015, a total 
of 3310 of the 69,325 patients who were screened 
underwent randomization (Fig. S1 and Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix); 1654 patients 
were assigned to low-dose alteplase and 1643 to 
standard-dose alteplase. There were no significant 
differences between the low-dose group and the 
standard-dose group in baseline demographic 
and clinical characteristics (Table 1, and Table S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix), nor in the num-
ber of patients assigned to each of the blood-
pressure-lowering groups. The median age of 
the patients was 67 years (14% were ≥80 years of 
age), and 38% were women. Approximately two 
thirds of the patients were Asian, and 43% were 
recruited from China. The median NIHSS score 
before treatment was 8 (range, 0 to 42; inter-
quartile range, 5 to 14), and the median time 
from stroke onset to randomization was 2.7 hours 
(interquartile range, 2.0 to 3.5).
Interventions
In both groups, the mean time from the onset 
of stroke to administration of alteplase was 170 
minutes; the mean dose of alteplase adminis-
tered as an infusion was 35.5 mg in the low-dose 
group and 56.0 mg in the standard-dose group 
(P<0.001) (Table 1). The distribution of dosing

tary Appendix. Postrandomization management, 
including endovascular thrombectomy and rates 
of recanalization, was similar in the two groups 
during the first 7 days (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Outcome at 90 days was 
assessed by telephone in 84.6% of the patients in 
the low-dose group and in 83.6% of the patients 
in the standard-dose group; the rest of the pa-
tients were assessed by in-person examination. 
The sources of information for the modified 
Rankin scale scores were balanced between the 
groups (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Blood-Pressure Control
In the part of the trial dealing with blood-pres-
sure control that included 935 patients with el-
evated systolic blood pressure (range, 150 to 220 
mm Hg), 224 patients in the low-dose group 
(13.5%) and 232 in the standard-dose group (14.1%) 
were assigned to rapid blood-pressure reduction. 
In both alteplase dose groups, the mean systolic 
blood pressure levels were significantly lower, by 
7 to 9 mm Hg, with intensive blood-pressure 
control than with standard blood-pressure man-
agement at 1 hour and 6 hours after randomiza-
tion (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
Scores on the modified Rankin scale for assess-
ment of the primary outcome could not be ob-
tained, owing to withdrawal of consent or loss 
to follow-up, in 47 of the patients assigned to 
low-dose alteplase and 44 assigned to standard-
dose alteplase (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In the modified intention-to-treat analy-
sis, the primary outcome (scores of 2 to 6 on the 
modified Rankin scale) occurred in 855 of 1607 
patients (53.2%) in the low-dose group and in 
817 of 1599 patients (51.1%) in the standard-dose 
group (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.95 to 1.25; the upper boundary of the 95% 
confidence interval exceeded the prespecified 
boundary for noninferiority of 1.14; one-sided 
P 
= 
0.51 for noninferiority) (Table 2, and Fig. S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). In an adjusted 
analysis of the intention-to-treat population, the 
rate was 53.3% in the low-dose group and 50.9% 
in the standard-dose group (odds ratio, 1.13; 
95% CI, 0.97 to 1.31; P 
= 
0.88 for noninferiority); 
in an adjusted analysis in the per-protocol popu-
lation, the rates were 53.5% and 51.3%, respec-
tively (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.32; 
one-sided P 
= 
0.89 for noninferiority). There was 
no heterogeneity of effect between patients who 
began alteplase treatment less than 3 hours after 
stroke onset and those who began treatment 3 or 
more hours after stroke onset (Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), and there was no sig-
nificant interaction between intensity of blood-
pressure lowering and alteplase dose (P 
= 
0.29).
Secondary Outcomes
In an unadjusted ordinal analysis of the distribu-
tion of modified Rankin scale scores in the two 
groups, the odds ratio with low-dose alteplase as 
compared with standard-dose alteplase was 1.00 
(95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13; P 
= 
0.04 for noninferiority) 
(Table 2). The assumption-free, adjusted, and per-
protocol alternative approaches were consistent 
in showing no significant difference in the treat-
ment effect for overall functional outcome on the 
modified Rankin scale between doses of alteplase 
(Fig. 1, and Figs. S3, S4, and S6 and Tables S8, S9, 
and S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Major symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage 
according to SITS-MOST criteria occurred in 17 of 
1654 patients (1.0%) in the low-dose group and 
in 35 of 1643 patients (2.1%) in the standard-dose 
group (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.86; 
P 
= 
0.01) (Table 2). There was no significant in-
teraction between intensive blood-pressure low-
ering and alteplase dose group with respect to the 
risk of major symptomatic intracerebral hemor-
rhage (P 
= 
0.71). Symptomatic intracerebral hem-
orrhage according to other criteria also occurred 
significantly less frequently in the low-dose group 
than in the standard-dose group (Table 2, and 
Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix); for ex-
ample, the rate of fatal events within 7 days was 
0.5% in the low-dose group and 1.5% in the 
standard-dose group (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 
0.17 to 0.80; P 
= 
0.01). There was no heterogene-
ity in the effect of alteplase dose on the risk of 
symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage between 
Asians and non-Asians (Fig. S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Mortality at 7 days was 3.6% in the low-dose 
group versus 5.3% in the standard-dose group 
(odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94; P 
= 
0.02), 
and mortality at 90 days was 8.5% versus 10.3% 
(odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.07) 
(Fig. S9 and Table S11 in the Supplementary Ap-

§ 
 
Disability was defined by a score of 2 to 5 on the modified Rankin scale, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of disability. Death was defined by a modified Rankin scale score of 6.
¶  
The main definition of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage used in the study was the definition from the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study (SITS-
MOST): a large local or remote parenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage (>30% of the infarcted area affected by hemorrhage with mass effect or extension outside the infarct) in combi-
nation with neurologic deterioration from baseline (increase of ≥4 in in the NIHSS score) or death within 36 hours.
‖ 
 
Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was also assessed according to National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) trial criteria: any intracerebral hemorrhage 
with neurologic deterioration (increase of ≥1 in the NIHSS score) from baseline or death within 36 hours.
**  
The common odds ratio was estimated from an ordinal logistic-regression model and indicates the odds of a decrease of 1 in the modified Rankin scale score, with a common odds 
ratio greater than 1 favoring standard-dose alteplase.
††  
Major disability was defined by a score of 3 to 5 on the modified Rankin scale.
‡‡  
The EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D) covers five domains of health-related quality of life: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain–discomfort, and anx-
iety–depression. Scores from these levels are combined to provide an overall health utility score ranging from −0.109 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health. Data were avail-
able for 1594 patients in the low-dose group and 1591 patients in the standard-dose group.

¶¶  
Neurologic deterioration was defined as an increase from baseline of at least 4 in the NIHSS score.

Serious adverse events were defined by standard criteria and included those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an exist-
ing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or substantive disability or incapacity, or resulted in a medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or 
function. Details on serious adverse events are provided in Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix.

Subgroup Analyses
There was no significant heterogeneity of treat-
ment effect on the primary outcome across 
prespecified subgroups (Fig. 2). The interaction 
between alteplase dose and aspirin or other anti-
platelet therapy was not significant (P 
= 
0.05); 
however, this interaction was significant (P 
= 
0.02) 
in a post hoc unadjusted ordinal analysis of modi-
fied Rankin scale scores (Fig. S10 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Post hoc analyses showed 
consistency in the effect of alteplase dose on 
death at 90 days across subgroups and no clear 
relation with baseline NIHSS score (Fig. S11 and 
S12 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
There was no significant difference between the 
low-dose group and the standard-dose group in 
the overall reported rate of serious adverse events, 
which occurred in 25.1% and 27.3% of the pa-
tients, respectively (P 
= 
0.16). However, signifi-
cantly fewer patients in the low-dose alteplase 
group than in the standard-dose alteplase group 
had (unadjudicated) fatal cerebral hemorrhage 
events (1.3% vs. 2.5%, P 
= 
0.02). All serious adverse 
events are listed in Table S12 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Discussion
In patients with acute ischemic stroke who met 
guideline-recommended criteria for thrombolytic 
reperfusion treatment, a dose of 0.6 mg of al-
teplase per kilogram was not shown to be non-
inferior to a dose of 0.9 mg of alteplase per kilo-
gram with respect to the primary outcome of death 
or disability at 90 days. Our trial was driven by 
concern about high risks of intracerebral hemor-
rhage with alteplase, particularly among Asians, 
because preliminary studies have had differing 
results with respect to the effectiveness and risks 
of this treatment.8,11 Using several definitions of 
symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage,22 we ob-
served fewer clinically important cases in the 
group assigned to low-dose alteplase than in the 
group assigned to standard-dose alteplase, and 
the difference in risk was consistent in Asians 
and non-Asians.
The distribution of modified Rankin scale 
scores in the two groups at 90 days indicates 
that the lower rate of death with low-dose al-
teplase than with standard-dose alteplase was 
accompanied by more patients surviving with 
mild to moderately severe grades of residual dis-
ability. There was no heterogeneity of treatment 
effect on the primary outcome in prespecified 
subgroups, but these analyses had low statistical 
power. One fifth of our trial population were re-
ceiving antiplatelet therapy. Previous studies have 
shown an increased risk of intracerebral hemor-
Figure 1. Functional Outcomes at 90 Days, According to Score on the Modified Rankin Scale.
Shown is the raw distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days in the group that received a low 
dose of alteplase (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) and the group that received the standard dose of alteplase 
(0.9 mg per kilogram). Scores on the modified Rankin scale range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms,  
1 symptoms without clinically significant disability, 2 slight disability, 3 moderate disability, 4 moderately severe  
disability, 5 severe disability, and 6 death.

Low-Dose versus Standard-Dose Intravenous Alteplase
rhage with standard-dose alteplase among pa-
tients receiving antiplatelet therapy.23,24 In our 
prespecified analysis, there was no significant 
interaction between alteplase dose and antiplate-
let treatment with respect to a poor outcome; 
however, the interaction was significant in a post 
hoc ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale 
scores. The ongoing part of this trial is testing 
the effectiveness of intensive and early reduction 
of elevated systolic blood pressure on outcomes 
in patients with ischemic stroke. Analyses did 
not indicate any significant interaction between 
early intensive blood-pressure lowering and al-
teplase dose.
Efforts to minimize reporting biases in this 
open-label trial included the measurement of 
Figure 2. Effects of Low-Dose Alteplase as Compared with Standard-Dose Alteplase on the Primary Efficacy Outcome, According to  
Prespecified Subgroups.
The primary efficacy outcome was death or disability at 90 days, defined by scores of 2 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (range,  
0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) range from 0 to 42, with higher  
scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. For subcategories, black squares represent point estimates (with the area of the 
square proportional to the number of events), and horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals. For systolic blood pressure  
and NIHSS score, values are equal to or above the median of distribution versus below the median of distribution. CT denotes  
computed tomography.

body weight, blinded central adjudication of in-
tracerebral hemorrhage, and blinded evaluation 
of clinical outcomes with the use of established 
criteria. Imprecision in estimates of the treat-
ment effect may have arisen from interobserver 
variability in determining the scores on the 
modified Rankin scale,15,25 which was adminis-
tered principally by telephone. Analysis of the net 
change in functional outcome was based on equal 
weights assigned to each score (0 through 6) on 
the modified Rankin scale, but patient and pro-
vider assessments can vary across health transi-
tions,26 and functional recovery can continue be-
yond 90 days.27 In our trial, selection bias was 
due to the inclusion of patients who had a pre-
dominantly mild severity of neurologic impair-
ment and who were treated at a later time point 
after symptom onset than in other trials1,3,4 and 
than in quality-assurance studies12,16,28 of the use 
of alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke. 
The high percentage of Asian participants and 
concurrent intensive blood-pressure control in 
some patients may also raise concerns about 
generalizability, despite the finding that there were 
no significant interactions observed between 
Asians and non-Asians, nor with intensity of 
blood-pressure control.
In conclusion, in a group of predominantly 
Asian patients with acute ischemic stroke who 
were eligible for thrombolysis reperfusion thera-
py, a dose of alteplase of 0.6 mg per kilogram 
was not shown to be noninferior to the standard 
dose of 0.9 mg per kilogram with respect to the 
primary outcome of death and disability. Fewer 
patients treated with low-dose alteplase than 
with standard-dose alteplase (1% vs. 2%) had the 
secondary outcome of symptomatic intracerebral 
hemorrhage.
