Exercise Prevents Diet-Induced
Cellular Senescence in Adipose Tissue
Diabetes 2016;65:1606–1615 | DOI: 10.2337/db15-0291
Considerable evidence implicates cellular senescence
in the biology of aging and chronic disease. Diet and
exercise are determinants of healthy aging; however,
the extent to which they affect the behavior and accre-
tion of senescent cells within distinct tissues is not
clear. Here we tested the hypothesis that exercise pre-
vents premature senescent cell accumulation and sys-
temic metabolic dysfunction induced by a fast-food
diet (FFD). Using transgenic mice that express EGFP
in response to activation of the senescence-associated
p16INK4a promoter, we demonstrate that FFD consump-
tion causes deleterious changes in body weight and com-
position as well as in measures of physical, cardiac,
and metabolic health. The harmful effects of the FFD
were associated with dramatic increases in several
markers of senescence, including p16, EGFP, senescence-
associated b-galactosidase, and the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) specifically
in visceral adipose tissue. We show that exercise pre-
vents the accumulation of senescent cells and the ex-
pression of the SASP while nullifying the damaging
effects of the FFD on parameters of health. We also
demonstrate that exercise initiated after long-term
FFD feeding reduces senescent phenotype markers in
visceral adipose tissue while attenuating physical impair-
ments, suggesting that exercise may provide restorative
benefit by mitigating accrued senescent burden. These
findings highlight a novel mechanism by which exercise
mediates its beneficial effects and reinforces the effect of
modifiable lifestyle choices on health span.
Unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyles are factors
fueling the obesity epidemic, wherein ;35% of middle-
aged Americans are obese (1). Heavily implicated in this
public health issue is routine consumption of calorie-dense,
nutrient-poor fast foods and sugar-sweetened beverages,
akin to a fast-food diet (FFD) (2). Nutrient excess leading
to metabolic dysfunction increases the risk for and acceler-
ates the onset of numerous age-related conditions, including
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and
cancer (3,4). Fat mass distribution further influences
chronic disease risk, with visceral adiposity serving as a
stronger predictor of all-cause mortality relative to sub-
cutaneous adiposity (5). In contrast, exercise positively
affects body composition, enhances physical fitness, and
is protective against numerous age-related diseases (6).
Despite the widely recognized effects of diet and exercise
on health span, the fundamental mechanisms by which
they influence the biology of aging and chronic disease
remain elusive.
Cellular senescence is a state of stable growth arrest
triggered by telomere erosion, DNA lesions, reactive oxygen
species, and other mitogenic and metabolic stressors. It is
mediated by the inhibition of cell cycle progression through
p16INK4a/retinoblastoma protein and/or the activation of
cell cycle arrest through p53/p21. Characteristic gene ex-
pression signature and morphological shifts define the
transition into a senescence state, but the functional role
of senescent cells within a given tissue milieu is highly de-
pendent on cell type, concentration, and context (7). Multiple

OBESITY STUDIES
 lines of evidence implicate cellular senescence in the bi-
ology of aging and the genesis of age-related conditions
(8,9). In particular, biomarkers of senescent cells, includ-
ing p16 and senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-
b-gal) levels, increase in multiple tissues with advancing
age and in the context of chronic disease (10).
Senescent cells actively secrete a broad repertoire of
cytokines, chemokines, matrix-remodeling proteases, and
growth factors, collectively referred to as the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (11). Despite their
cell-autonomous role in the prevention of malignant
transformation, through the SASP, senescent cells damage
neighboring cells, paradoxically fuel the aberrant growth
and invasion of malignant cells, and promote inflammation
(7,8). Senescent cells and the SASP are thus believed to
drive degenerative, hyperproliferative, and inflammatory
conditions of aging (12). This premise is further sup-
ported by studies demonstrating that targeted deletion
of senescent cells expressing p16INK4a delays the onset
of several age-related phenotypes, including thymic invo-
lution (13), and, in a mouse model of accelerated aging,
cataracts, lordokyphosis, and diminished exercise capacity
(14). More recently, senolytics, the term given to pharma-
cological agents selected for their ability to kill senescent
cells or inhibit the SASP, have shown therapeutic benefit
on parameters of physical health and function when admin-
istered to chronologically aged, progeroid, and/or irradiated
mice (15,16).
Whether and how lifestyle choices in middle age
influence the premature genesis of proaging senescent
phenotypes in distinct tissues remains unclear. Accord-
ingly, we sought to determine the extent to which nutrient
excess and exercise affect the onset and progression of
cellular senescence and the SASP using adult transgenic
mice that express a construct harboring EGFP in response
to the senescence-sensitive promoter, p16INK4a.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Mice and Experimental Interventions
Mice harboring the p16INK4a-EGFP transgenic construct
(14) were generated on a genetically heterogeneous back-
ground (four-strain cross, as previously detailed [17]). For
the prevention study, 8-month-old male mice were divided
into four groups of comparable mean body weights. The
groups were randomly assigned to one of the following 16-
week interventions: normal diet (ND) (13% energy as fat;
PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 [5053]; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO),
FFD (40% energy as fat [milk fat, 12% saturated] with
0.2% cholesterol; Western Diet [5342]; TestDiet, St. Louis,
MO), and high-fructose corn syrup in the drinking water
(42 g/L; see [18]), ND plus exercise, or FFD plus exercise.
For the treatment study, 5- to 6-month-old male mice
were provided ND or FFD for 16 weeks. FFD mice were
then randomized to sedentary or exercise groups based on
body weight, for a total of three groups, which were
monitored for an additional 14 weeks. Thus, all mice in
the prevention and treatment studies were ;1 year old at
necropsy. All mice were individually housed in ventilated
cages and provided food and water ad libitum. Exercised
mice were provided wireless running wheels, and exercise
behavior was monitored using Wheel Manager Data Acqui-
sition Software (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Experi-
ments were performed under protocols approved by the
Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Body Composition and Health Span Measures
Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. Body
composition (total body lean and fat mass) was assessed
monthly in unanesthetized mice by quantitative MRI
(EchoMRI-100; Houston, TX), as previously described (19).
At the end of the study, subcutaneous and visceral fat in
the lumbar region was quantified in anesthetized mice
using microcomputed tomography (vivaCT 40; Scanco
Medical, Wayne, PA). As a measure of physical function,
exercise capacity was determined on a motorized tread-
mill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH), as previ-
ously described (20). Cardiac function in mice under light
isoflurane anesthesia was assessed by echocardiography
using the Vevo 2100 system (FUJIFILM VisualSonics,
Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada), as recently described (21).
For metabolic function, glucose and insulin concentrations
and glucose tolerance after a 6-h fast were assessed, as
previously described (22).
Tissue Assessments
Individual tissues were harvested, weighed, and processed
for downstream analyses. Portions of individual adipose
tissue depots were fixed in PBS containing 2.0% formal-
dehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for cell size determination
and SA-b-gal activity. The sizes of adipocytes in fat tissue
were determined using Metamorph software (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Liver tissue was fixed in 10%
formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Liver
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
overall morphology. A pathologist who was not aware of
treatment assignments gave grades of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to
sections in which 0, 1–4, 5–30, 31–60, and 61–100% of he-
patocytes, respectively, had lipid macrovesicles. Grades of 0, 1,
2, and 3 were assigned to liver sections with 0, 1–30, 31–60,
and 61–100% of hepatocytes containing lipid microvesicles.
Liver ceramides were quantified using ultraperformance liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, as recently de-
scribed (23). Pancreata were embedded and frozen in Optimal
Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.,
Torrance, CA). Immunostaining of cryosections and quantifi-
cation of insulin-positive mass was performed, as previously
described (24).
Markers of Cellular Senescence and the SASP
For transcriptional analysis, TRIzol-based extraction was
used to isolate RNA from whole mouse tissues, which
were subjected to nanodrop concentration and purity
analysis before cDNA synthesis. TaqMan quantitative
PCR (qPCR) assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were
used for detection of p16 (Mm00494449_m1), monocyte

 chemoattractant protein 1 (Mcp1; Mm00441243_g1), and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1; Mm00439561_m1).
PrimeTime 59 nuclease qPCR assays (Integrated DNA Tech-
nologies, Coralville, IA) were used for detection of p21
(Mm.PT.56a.17125846), p53 (Mm.PT.56a.44013092), in-
terleukin 6 (Il6; Mm.PT.56a.10005566), plasminogen activa-
tor 1 (Pai1; Mm.PT.58.6413525), matrix metalloprotease 3
(Mmp3; Mm.PT.58.9719290), CD68 (Mm.PT.58.32698807),
and Tbp (Mm.PT.39a.22214839). A SYBR qPCR assay (In-
tegrated DNA Technologies) was used for detection of
EGFP (forward 59-CAA CTA CAA CAG CCA CAA CG-39;
reverse 59-GGT CAC GAA CTC CAG CAG-39). Adipose tissue
depots were stained for SA-b-gal activity, as previously de-
scribed (25).
Statistical Analysis
Significant differences between groups for the dependent
variables of diet (ND and FFD) and behavior (sedentary
and exercise) were tested using one- or two-way ANOVA.
The Tukey multiple comparisons test was used for post
hoc analyses for between-group comparisons. Analyses
were conducted using GraphPad Prism Statistical Soft-
ware Version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).
RESULTS
Exercise Prevents Multiple Indices of Diet-Induced
Metabolic Dysfunction
To investigate the potential role of cellular senescence in
diet-induced dyshomeostasis, which may be attenuated by
exercise, we provided 8-month-old male mice harboring
an EGFP transgene driven by the p16INK4a promoter with
an ND or a high-fat diet enriched with saturated fat,
cholesterol, and high fructose corn syrup, equivalent to
an FFD, for 4 months. Subsets of ND- and FFD-fed mice
were provided with running wheels. Mice provided with
the FFD consumed more total calories within the first
weeks of the study, but within 1 month, total calorie in-
take was not different among any of the groups (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1A). Increased energy intake in exercising
FFD mice corresponded to elevated average daily running
distances, albeit nonstatistically significant, within the
first 2 months of the study (Supplementary Fig. 1B).
We assessed whether clinically relevant health indices,
including body weight, adipose mass, physical activity,
circulating insulin and glucose concentrations, cardiac
function, and liver health were altered by diet and exercise.
At study onset, average body weight and fat mass were
equivalent among ND- and FFD-fed mice, but after 4
months, FFD-fed mice weighed 31% more and accumulated
twice the total fat of ND-fed mice (Fig. 1A and B). Differ-
ences between ND- and FFD-fed mice in subcutaneous
and visceral fat were evident by weight (Supplementary
Fig. 2A) and in microcomputed tomography scans of the
lumbar region (Fig. 1C). The visceral fat of FFD-fed mice
was composed of significantly larger adipocytes and a
greater percentage of large adipocytes than that of ND-
fed mice (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Exercise blunted the
ND- and, more dramatically, the FFD-induced accretion
of body weight and fat mass (Fig. 1A–C and Supplementary
Figure 1—Nutrient excess and exercise exert opposing effects on body composition and physical endurance. Compared with mice fed an
ND, mice fed an FFD for 16 weeks exhibited marked gains in body weight (A) and fat mass as determined by quantitative MRI (B). C: FFD-
induced obesity was further evident in volumes of visceral (pink) and subcutaneous (gray) fat in the lumbar region of mice as assessed by
computed tomography. D: Exercised mice fed the ND or FFD exhibited significantly greater distances run to exhaustion on a treadmill than
sedentary mice fed either diet. For all analyses, n = 6–7 mice/group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

 Fig. 2A). In fact, the visceral and subcutaneous fat weights
of exercised FFD-fed mice were not statistically different
from those of ND-fed mice (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Exer-
cise also prevented the FFD-induced hypertrophy of adipo-
cytes (Supplementary Fig. 2B).
Assessment of physical function using a treadmill test
revealed that the FFD diet alone caused a modest but
nonsignificant decrease in physical performance, whereas
exercised mice fed the ND and FFD both ran a signifi-
cantly greater distance to exhaustion than sedentary
peers (Fig. 1D). Exercised mice also had positive cardiac
adaptations relative to sedentary peers, including increased
heart weight–to–body weight ratios, indicative of physio-
logical hypertrophy (Supplementary Fig. 3A), and improved
ejection fractions measured by echocardiography (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3B). Sedentary mice fed the FFD exhibited
poorer values for both of these parameters of cardiac
health (Supplementary Fig. 3A and B) and a deleterious
increase in the left ventricular end diastolic dimension
relative to mice fed the ND and exercised FFD-fed peers
(Supplementary Fig. 3C).
With respect to metabolic function, no differences in
fasting glucose were observed between groups (data not
shown); however, sedentary mice fed the FFD had dra-
matically increased insulin concentrations. This hallmark
of diet-induced insulin resistance was robustly reduced by
exercise (Fig. 2A). Correspondingly, we observed grossly
enlarged b-cell masses and insulin-positive areas in the
pancreata of sedentary but not exercised FFD-fed mice
(Fig. 2B and C). Further evidence of preserved insulin
action in exercised mice fed the FFD was apparent in a
glucose tolerance test, in which they were indistinguish-
able from mice fed the ND (Fig. 2D). In contrast, seden-
tary mice fed the FFD had more pronounced excursions
and impaired clearance of circulating glucose.
Nutrient excess can lead to adipocyte dysfunction,
reflected in impaired triglyceride deposition, increased
lipolysis and lipotoxicity, or the accumulation of lipids
in peripheral tissues (26). As expected, liver weights of
sedentary FFD-fed mice were significantly greater than
ND-fed mice (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Also significantly
elevated in the livers of sedentary mice were longer chain
ceramides, C16 and C24:1, and liver triglycerides, which
are associated with insulin resistance (27) (Supplementary
Fig. 4B and C). These markers of hepatic lipotoxicity were
prevented by exercise (Supplementary Fig. 4B and C), as
Figure 2—Diet-induced deterioration of metabolic health is attenuated by exercise. A: Compared with sedentary and exercised mice fed
the ND, sedentary FFD-fed mice exhibited significantly higher circulating insulin concentrations. B and C: Correspondingly, cross sections
of the pancreata of sedentary FFD-fed mice exhibited markedly greater b-cell masses and insulin-positive areas (representative images, B).
A–C: Remarkably, these features of insulin resistance in FFD-fed mice were abrogated by exercise. D: Compromised and improved insulin
actions in sedentary and exercised FFD-fed groups, respectively, were apparent in a glucose tolerance test. Namely, the higher peak
and greater excursions in glucose concentrations observed in sedentary FFD-fed mice relative to ND-fed mice were erased by exercise. For
all analyses, n = 6–7 mice/group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

 were select FFD-induced gross morphological changes
(Supplementary Fig. 4D). Compared with ND-fed mice,
livers of sedentary and exercised FFD-fed mice demon-
strated increases in the percentage of hepatocytes with
lipid macrovesicles in their cytoplasm, an early event in
the pathogenesis of steatosis (Supplementary Fig. 4E).
Most of the hepatocytes in the livers of sedentary mice
fed the FFD also had highly abundant lipid microvesicles,
a feature associated with mitochondrial injury or dysfunc-
tion (28). This consequence of the FFD was abrogated by
exercise (Supplementary Fig. 4F). Collectively, these data
underscore the salutary influence of exercise on several
parameters of health and its ability to prevent multiple
harmful effects of nutrient excess.
The Detrimental Effects of Nutrient Excess on
Senescent Cell Burden and the SASP in Visceral Fat
Are Prevented by Exercise
Although accumulation of senescent cells occurs with
advancing age, prematurely elevated senescent cell burden
may be both a cause and consequence of metabolic dysfunc-
tion (9,29). We hypothesized that routine FFD consumption
in middle age promotes accretion of senescent cells, and
accordingly, we probed expression of senescent biomarkers
p16, p21, and p53 within discrete tissues. Compared
with ND-fed mice, the visceral fat of sedentary FFD-fed
mice contained significantly higher mRNA levels of p16
(Fig. 3A) and p53 (Fig. 3B) as well as p21 (Fig. 3C), its
downstream target, indicating pronounced activation of
senescence effectors. Exercise completely blocked FFD-
induced increases in p53 and p21 (Fig. 3B and C). The
expression of p16 in subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, kidney, heart (left ventricle),
and aorta was not altered in response to diet or exercise
(Fig. 3A). Similar outcomes were observed for the expres-
sion of p53, which, in addition, was higher in the subcuta-
neous fat of FFD-fed mice relative to that of exercised
ND-fed mice (Fig. 3B). Expression of p21 was significantly
elevated in subcutaneous fat and liver of sedentary FFD-fed
mice, an effect that was prevented by exercise (Fig. 3C).
These findings suggest that nutrient excess in middle age
activates expression of prosenescence markers in visceral
adipose tissue and that this effect is robustly attenuated
by exercise. To a lesser degree, senescent signaling may
also occur in tissues other than visceral fat and may be
prevented by exercise. However, this likely involves mech-
anisms other than p16, such as the p53/p21 pathway.
Elevated expression of senescence markers distinctly
within visceral adipose led us to further investigate the
influence of nutrient excess and exercise on additional
indicators of cellular senescence and the SASP in this
tissue. Quantification of EGFP expression confirmed that
FFD-feeding greatly enhanced p16INK4a promoter activity,
which was strongly prevented by exercise (Fig. 4A). To
validate expression-based data, we stained visceral
adipose tissue for the classic biomarker of senescence,
SA-b-gal. In sedentary and exercised mice fed the ND, ;2%
of cells stained were positive for SA-b-gal (Fig. 4B and C).
In comparison, more than 12% of cells in sedentary mice
fed the FFD stained positively. Strikingly, exercise nulli-
fied this effect of the FFD, and as a result, the percentage
of cells positive for SA-b-gal in exercised FFD-fed mice
was identical to that of ND-fed middle-aged mice (Fig.
4B and C).
Senescent cells partly disrupt a tissue’s structure and
function and affect the systemic environment through the
factors they secrete. Indeed, FFD-fed mice demonstrated
significant increases in the expression of proinflammatory
SASP markers, including Il6, Pai1, and Mcp1 (Fig. 3D). We
also observed significantly increased expression of Mmp3,
a matrix remodeling protein and SASP component, within
visceral fat after FFD-feeding. No significant differences
were found in Igf1 (Fig. 4D). With the exception of Pai1,
exercise prevented the induction of the SASP by the FFD.
SASP signaling may instigate senescence in a paracrine
manner while recruiting inflammatory cells (30), ultimately
Figure 3—The effects of diet and exercise on senescence markers
in multiple tissues. To determine the extent to which nutrient excess
and exercise affected cellular senescence in middle-aged mice, we
compared the expression of p16 (A), p53 (B), and p21 (C) by qPCR
in multiple tissues, including visceral (Vis) fat, subcutaneous (SQ)
fat, liver, gastrocnemius (gastroc), pancreas (panc), kidney, heart,
and aorta. For all analyses, n = 6–7 mice/group. *P < 0.05, **P <
0.01, ***P < 0.001.

 propagating sterile inflammation (31). Indeed, we ob-
served a 7.5-fold increase in the expression of the pan-
macrophage marker, CD68, in visceral adipose (Fig. 4D).
Exercise completely abrogated CD68 induction (Fig. 4D).
These findings indicate that diet and exercise are potent
mediators of cellular senescence and the SASP, which may
be a central mediator of obesity-induced inflammation in
visceral adipose tissue.
Exercise Reduces Markers of Cellular Senescence and
the SASP in Diet-Induced Obese Mice
Given the efficacy of exercise at preventing the molecular
phenotype of senescence in the visceral fat of FFD-fed
mice, we next tested whether exercise may be leveraged to
revert these consequences. Accordingly, we provided mice
with the ND or FFD for 16 weeks, during which the FFD
led to gains in total body weight (Fig. 5A) and fat mass as
measured by quantitative MRI (Fig. 5B). The FFD mice
were then randomized to voluntary wheel running or sed-
entary groups. Over the subsequent 14 weeks, body
weight (Fig. 5A) and fat mass (Fig. 5B) declined in exer-
cising mice. Microcomputed tomography scans further
showed that exercise-mediated fat mass reductions
occurred in visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots
(Fig. 5C). Exercise adaptations were corroborated by a
forced-run treadmill test to exhaustion, during which ex-
ercised mice ran 126% farther than sedentary FFD-fed
peers (Fig. 5D).
To explore whether exercise mitigates diet-induced
cellular senescence, we conducted gene expression pro-
filing on visceral adipose extracts. Similar to the pre-
vention study, exposure to the FFD for 30 weeks resulted
in a significant fourfold increase in p16 expression in
visceral fat of sedentary mice (Fig. 5E). Despite continued
consumption of the FFD, the treatment of obese mice
with exercise for 14 weeks reverted this effect, as
evidenced by reduced expression of p16 to levels that
were not different from ND-fed control mice. Expression
of p53 and p21 did not significantly differ between
ND- and FFD-fed mice (Fig. 5E), suggesting that p16
rather than p53/p21 signaling may drive long-term senes-
cence maintenance. Consistent with induction of the se-
nescence biomarker p16, we observed significant increases
in the SASP component, Pai1, in sedentary FFD-fed mice.
Increases in Mcp1 were not significant (Fig. 5F). CD68
transcriptional levels were also higher in sedentary FFD-
fed mice than in ND-fed peers (Fig. 5F). Treatment of
FFD-fed mice with exercise attenuated elevated Pai1 and

 CD68 levels (Fig. 5F). Cumulatively, these results point to
diminution of a diet-induced senescent phenotype in vis-
ceral adipose tissue as a means by which exercise provides
restorative benefit to abate chronic disease after long-
term sedentary behavior and nutrient excess.
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates the robust effects of
modifiable lifestyle factors on the accumulation of senes-
cent cells and the expression of the SASP in middle age.
Our data highlight the harmful consequences of nutrient
excess and the remarkably protective influence of exercise
on this biological process and, in turn, measures of
physical, cardiovascular, and metabolic function. In the
face of population aging, an obesity epidemic, and global
reductions in physical activity, these findings have signif-
icant implications for human health.
Obesity is, fundamentally, a condition of energy im-
balance caused by the consumption of more energy than
is expended. The increased storage demands placed on
adipocytes in the face of nutrient excess ultimately com-
promise their function, reflected in impaired storage of
lipids and augmented release of free fatty acids and
inflammatory mediators (26). Our data support the premise
Figure 5—Exercise initiated after long-term FFD feeding improves physical parameters and attenuates markers of visceral adipose senes-
cence. After 16 weeks of FFD feeding and sedentary lifestyle, exercise “treatment” in the form of voluntary running wheels for a subsequent 14
weeks (FFD → FFD + Exercise) led to reductions in total body weight (A) and fat mass (B). C: Computed tomography assessment of the lumbar
region at end point revealed that exercise-mediated reductions corresponded to both visceral (pink) and subcutaneous (gray) adipose depots.
D: Exercise capacity determined by treadmill testing dramatically increased in FFD-fed mice switched from sedentary to running wheel
exercise, relative to both ND- and FFD-sedentary groups. qPCR was used to compare expression of senescence induction factors p16,
p53, and p21 (E) and SASP and inflammatory factors Pai1, Mcp1, and CD68 (F). For all analyses, n = 5–7 mice/group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

 that visceral adipose tissue dysfunction and its sequelae
are partly mediated through cellular senescence (12). The
stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue is rich in pro-
genitor cells, or preadipocytes, that are prone to senes-
cence and exhibit a proinflammatory profile (12,16,29).
We show that nutrient excess markedly increased the
expression of p16 and other markers of senescence, in-
cluding p53 and p21 and the activity of SA-b-gal. These
changes were associated with induction of proinflammatory
cytokines, chemokines, and matrix remodeling proteins (e.g.,
Il6, Mcp1, Pai1, and Mmp3, respectively), collectively re-
ferred to as the SASP.
SASP factors mechanistically contribute to metabolic
disease. Knockout of Pai1 abrogates insulin resistance and
obesity brought on by high-fat feeding (32). Similarly, block-
ade of adipose Mcp1 signaling exerts anti-inflammatory ef-
fects (33), and ablation of the Mcp1 receptor (C-C motif
chemokine receptor 2 [Ccr22/2]) increases adiponectin
levels and improves glucose homeostasis after high-fat
feeding relative to Ccr2+/+ controls matched for adiposity
(34). SASP signaling has been further implicated as a
means of senescence transmission to neighboring cells
(30), suggesting that the SASP may be responsible for in-
duction and amplification of inflammation arising from
nutrient excess. We demonstrate that FFD feeding strongly
induces visceral adipose expression of Pai1, Mcp1, and
CD68 coincident with increases in p16 expression and cells
positive for SA-b-gal, which is prevented by exercise. Sim-
ilarly, we show that treatment of obese mice with voluntary
exercise is able to revert aspects of this molecular pheno-
type. Our data and prior evidence support the premise that
senescent cells may be a primary source of obesity-associated
inflammation, which is central to the pathogenesis of type
2 diabetes and its complications (9) and highlights the
potential of exercise as an effective intervention.
In agreement with our findings, Minamino et al. (35)
reported that senescent cells accumulate in the adipose
tissue of younger mice with ectopic expression of agouti
peptide, which leads to excessive nutrient intake, obesity,
and diabetes. However, a more recent study failed to show
that high-fat feeding accelerates age-related p16INK4a ex-
pression as quantified by whole-body luciferase imaging
or mRNA abundance in isolated livers or spleens (36). It is
plausible that imaging was not adequately sensitive to de-
tect diet-induced changes in the abundance of p16INK4a-
positive senescent cells in vivo. Furthermore, nutrient excess
may more potently induce the accumulation of p16INK4a
and/or p53-positive senescent cells in adipose tissue com-
pared with other organs. Our results show that a senescence
phenotype is readily activated specifically within visceral fat
and, to a lesser degree within subcutaneous fat, in middle
age by the FFD. Because visceral adipose is a stronger driver
of metabolic-induced morbidity, relative to other depots
(5), senescent signaling may mediate this organ’s unique
role in sensing and negatively affecting the body in response
to nutrient excess, particularly regarding the inflammatory
component of obesity-induced dyshomeostasis. The causal
role of senescent cells and the SASP in the genesis of
obesity-associated conditions and the therapeutic efficacy
of their removal, therefore, requires further examination.
The tissue specificity and temporal induction of cellular
senescence warrants further consideration. Other groups
have demonstrated increased senescence markers in vari-
able tissues in response to nutrient excess, including
elevated aortic p16 levels after 20 weeks of high-fat feeding
in 4-week-old C57BL/6 J mice (37), elevated hepatic p16
and p21 levels after 13 weeks of high-fat feeding in 5-week-
old rats (38), and elevated pancreatic p38 and SA-b-gal
levels after 12 months of high-fat feeding in 4-week-old
C57BL/6 J mice (39). We conducted analyses in 12-month-
old mice administered dietary and/or exercise intervention
for the previous 16 or 30 weeks, and our experiments
used a diet that was high in sugar and fat. We observed
robust induction of p16 and p53 in visceral adipose and
induction of p21 in visceral and subcutaneous adipose
and liver. Expression of these markers also appeared to
increase in other tissues, including the pancreas, but did
not reach statistical significance. Given the differences in
age, genetic background, and diet composition between
our study and the noted reports, that others have identi-
fied senescence signatures in tissues that were not prom-
inent in our exploration is not surprising. However, the
composite results unanimously show that nutrient excess
leads to induction of senescence in multiple tissues re-
sponsible for coordinating metabolic health and cumula-
tively highlight the need for additional work to tease out
the time course of this progression in uniform contexts.
The beneficial effects of exercise on health span are
irrefutable; however, the biological mechanisms through
which they act are not completely understood. Our findings
confirm that exercise can positively affect multiple param-
eters of physical, cardiac, and metabolic health in middle-
aged mice and, importantly, overcome the damaging effects
of nutrient excess. Moreover, using established biomarkers,
we show for the first time that exercise prevents and
reduces indicators of cellular senescence in visceral adipose
tissue induced by an FFD. This is significant given the
considerable evidence implicating senescent cells and the
SASP in the biology of chronic diseases (8) and the bene-
ficial effects of their removal on several parameters of
health, at least in a model of accelerated aging (14). There
are three possibilities by which exercise prevented the diet-
induced accumulation of senescent cells:
First, the increased energy demands and use of dietary
macronutrients during bouts of exercise may have limited
the metabolic and replicative stresses experienced by cells
in adipose tissue and, consequently, their transition into a
senescent state. Smaller adipocytes and fat depots as well
as lower liver weights and abundance of liver ceramides in
exercised FFD-fed mice, compared with their sedentary
peers, may reflect this.
Second, it is plausible that exercise may have augmented
the clearance of senescent cells. Their fate is highly variable.
In benign melanocytic nevi, senescent cells can persist for

 decades (40), whereas senescent liver carcinoma cells
acutely activate the innate immune system to mediate their
clearance and limit tumor growth (41). This possibility is
supported by our data showing exercise reduces p16 ex-
pression in mice even after obesity and its consequences
have been established.
Third, exercise could have invoked protective responses
against triggers of cellular senescence in the context of
nutrient excess, because exercise counters DNA damage
(42), telomere erosion (43), oxidative stress (44), protein
aggregation (45), and mitochondrial dysfunction (46) in
multiple cell types. We speculate that exercise may have
induced such defense systems to prevent adipose tissue
cells from senescing. Indeed, additional work is needed to
better understand how and when to leverage exercise to
affect the accumulation, behavior, and persistence of se-
nescent cells in the context of nutrient excess.
Adipose tissue is a critically important tissue in organis-
mal health and aging. In contrast to the associations between
obesity and phenotypes suggestive of accelerated aging,
reductions in fat mass through calorie restriction (47),
surgery (48), mutations in the insulin-signaling pathway
(49), or exercise, as shown here, enhance health span in
various organisms. Our findings lend support to the con-
cept that the SASP is a major determinant of the secretory
profile, or endocrine function, of adipose tissue. In aging
and obesity, adipose tissue is a primary source of inflam-
matory mediators implicated in the genesis of diabetes
and other chronic diseases (12). We previously demon-
strated that the expression of components of the SASP,
including Pai1 and Il6, were distinctly higher in p16INK4a-
positive senescent cells than nonsenescent cells residing
in adipose tissue (9). In the current study, our results
show that exercise prevents the SASP within visceral ad-
ipose tissue, and remarkably, reduces aspects of the SASP
when initiated after its accumulation. We propose this is
an unappreciated mechanism through which physical ac-
tivity interventions may affect health span, particularly in
those who are overweight or obese. Of note, the associa-
tion between obesity-associated subclinical inflammation
and the genesis of type 2 diabetes has been reported to be
stronger in women than in men (50). Additional work is
needed to determine the extent to which senescent cell
burden and the SASP may account for this sex difference
and whether exercise is as protective in females as we
observed in males. Therapeutic approaches to suppress
the SASP, such as exercise, may offer a means to negate
the deleterious systemic effects of senescent cells in the
genesis of obesity- and age-related chronic diseases.
In sum, our data highlight a novel and significant
mechanism by which exercise positively affects organis-
mal health. Given the considerable evidence that cellular
senescence is a fundamental mechanism of aging and the
genesis of chronic diseases, our findings reinforce the
notion that lifestyle choices are powerful determinants of
health span. Additional studies are necessary to determine
the mechanisms by which exercise prevents and reverses
cellular senescence and the SASP and at what ages and in
what disease states it is most effective.
