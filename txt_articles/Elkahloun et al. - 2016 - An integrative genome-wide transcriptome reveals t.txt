and a candidate therapeutic for Alzheimer’s
disease

Abstract
Background: Alzheimer’s disease is the most frequent age-related dementia, and is currently without treatment. To
identify possible targets for early therapeutic intervention we focused on glutamate excitotoxicity, a major early
pathogenic factor, and the effects of candesartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker of neuroprotective efficacy in cell
cultures and rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease. The overall goal of the study was to determine whether gene
analysis of drug effects in a primary neuronal culture correlate with alterations in gene expression in Alzheimer’s
disease, thus providing further preclinical evidence of beneficial therapeutic effects.
Methods: Primary neuronal cultures were treated with candesartan at neuroprotective concentrations followed by
excitotoxic glutamate amounts. We performed genome-wide expression profile analysis and data evaluation by
ingenuity pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis, compared with alterations in gene expression from two
independent published datasets identified by microarray analysis of postmortem hippocampus from Alzheimer’s
disease patients. Preferential expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells or neurons was analyzed by comparison to
published gene expression in these cells isolated from human cortex by laser capture microdissection.
Results: Candesartan prevented glutamate upregulation or downregulation of several hundred genes in our cultures.
Ingenuity pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that inflammation, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes signal transduction pathways and amyloid β metabolism were major components of the neuronal response to
glutamate excitotoxicity. Further analysis showed associations of glutamate-induced changes in the expression of several
hundred genes, normalized by candesartan, with similar alterations observed in hippocampus from Alzheimer’s disease
patients. Gene analysis of neurons and cerebrovascular endothelial cells obtained by laser capture microdissection revealed
that genes up- and downregulated by glutamate were preferentially expressed in endothelial cells and neurons, respectively.
Conclusions: Our data may be interpreted as evidence of direct candesartan neuroprotection beyond its effects on
blood pressure, revealing common and novel disease mechanisms that may underlie the in vitro gene alterations
reported here and glutamate-induced cell injury in Alzheimer’s disease. Our observations provide novel evidence for
candesartan neuroprotection through early molecular mechanisms of injury in Alzheimer’s disease, supporting testing
this compound in controlled clinical studies in the early stages of the illness.

 Background
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common age-related de-
mentia and a major and increasing burden for our soci-
ety [1]. This disorder is currently without treatment, and
therapies to ameliorate alterations in amyloid beta (Aβ)
or tau metabolism, initiated too late in the disease
course, have proven disappointing [2]. For this reason
the search for early pathogenic mechanisms susceptible
to therapeutic intervention is a medical necessity.
Emerging evidence indicates a role for multifactorial
mechanisms involved in the early stages of the disease
and preceding diagnosis. These mechanisms include
genetic factors, possibly of cumulative impact [3], risk
factors, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [4, 5],
alterations in the microvasculature [4–6], chronic dysreg-
ulated inflammation [6, 7] and glutamate-mediated excito-
toxicity [3, 8–10].
In the present report we focused on glutamate excito-
toxicity. Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neuro-
transmitter in the mammalian brain and participates
in mechanisms associated with long-term potentiation
and synaptic plasticity [11]. Excessive production and
release of glutamate, however, leads to neuronal injury
and is a major pathogenic factor in many acute and
chronic brain conditions, including Alzheimer’s dis-
ease [3, 8–10, 12].
In our search for novel compounds with neuroprotec-
tive effects against glutamate neurotoxicity, we focused
in a class of compounds, the angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs) or sartans, that effectively blocks the
physiological AT1 receptor (AT1R) and therefore the ef-
fects of angiotensin II, the main active factor of the
renin–angiotensin system [13] both in the periphery and
the brain [14]. Excessive peripheral AT1R activity associ-
ates with hypertension, heart and kidney failure, periph-
eral vascular and tissue inflammation, and metabolic
abnormalities such as insulin resistance [15–17]. Conse-
quently, the use of sartans, because of their beneficial ef-
fects on inflammatory and metabolic alterations beyond
their effect on blood pressure control, has become a
cornerstone for the treatment of cardiovascular and
chronic kidney disease [18]. In turn, increased brain
AT1R stimulation associates with brain ischemia, blood–
brain barrier breakdown, Aβ production and toxicity,
brain inflammation, traumatic brain injury and glutam-
ate excitotoxicity, risk factors leading to neuronal injury,
cognitive decline, and the incidence and progression of
neurodegenerative diseases [19–26]. For this reason it is
not surprising that sartans have been found to be effect-
ive neuroprotective compounds. In vitro experiments
demonstrated that sartans ameliorate neuronal injury
produced by glutamate excitotoxicity and high levels of
interleukin (IL)-1β, and microglia activation as a result
of
systemic
administration
of
bacterial
endotoxin
(lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) [25, 27–29]. In rodent models
of Alzheimer’s disease, sartans (candesartan, losartan,
valsartan and telmisartan) ameliorate all risk factors for
human Alzheimer’s disease, including protecting cere-
bral blood flow and cognition during stroke, decreasing
inflammation and Aβ neurotoxicity, and reducing trau-
matic brain injury [24, 26, 27, 30–37]. Furthermore, clin-
ical studies indicate that ARBs protect cognition after
stroke and during aging [15, 22, 38, 39], and cohort ana-
lyses reveal that treatment of hypertension with sartans
significantly reduces the incidence and progression of
Alzheimer’s disease [40, 41].
To clarify the role of glutamate excitotoxicity, we used
primary rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) in vitro. This
is a well-characterized and reliable primary neuronal
model to analyze mechanisms and excitotoxic neuronal
damage and neuroprotection [42, 43]. Although in
humans CGCs are not primary targets for Alzheimer’s
disease, rat CGCs are very sensitive to glutamate excito-
toxicity, a major early injury factor in this illness, and
are extensively used in Alzheimer’s disease research
[44–46]. We selected the ARB candesartan for our
study because of its demonstrated neuroprotective effects
on cultured primary cortical neurons, microglia and cere-
brovascular endothelial cells, and its amelioration of brain
inflammation in vivo [27] including reducing glutamate-
induced apoptosis in cultured CGCs [25].
Our study was initially designed to provide mechanis-
tic insight into the potential targets and pathways that
may underlie glutamate-induced cell injury and its pos-
sible reversal by the neuroprotective action of candesar-
tan. To this aim, we performed genome-wide expression
analysis and evaluated the data with several pathway
analysis programs: ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA),
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [47, 48] and Kyoto
encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG).
The strong correlation of our findings with many sig-
nal transduction mechanisms and pathways associated
with Alzheimer’s disease prompted us to determine
whether there was an association between the changes
in gene expression in our study with those found in
postmortem brain samples from patients who suffered
from Alzheimer’s disease. To this end, we compared our
results with alterations in gene expression published in
two independent microarray studies of hippocampal
samples obtained postmortem from brains of patients
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Because of evi-
dence of cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction in
Alzheimer’s disease, we wanted to establish which of
the genes altered in Alzheimer’s disease patients were
predominantly expressed in cerebrovascular endothelial
cells or in neurons. To clarify this point, we compared
gene expressions altered in published Alzheimer’s disease
patients with published analysis of predominant gene

 expression in human cerebrovascular endothelial cells and
neurons obtained by laser capture microdissection from
postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples and
then we looked at the effect of candesartan on these gene
signatures in our CGC study.
Methods
Culture of primary neurons
Animal housing, handling and experimentation were in
compliance with guidelines and protocol approval by the
NIMH (NIH) Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee (protocol MH002762-17), and followed guidelines
of the US National Institute of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the
US National Academy of Sciences (http://oacu.od.nih.
gov/regs/index.htm).
We used primary cultures of rat primary CGCs,
which are very sensitive to glutamate excitotoxicity
and extensively used in Alzheimer’s disease research
[44–46]. CGCs were isolated from 8-day old Sprague
Dawley rat pups (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington,
MA, USA) as described previously [49, 50] which
were euthanized by decapitation. Brains were dis-
sected immediately and the cerebella were collected
and placed in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After removal of the
meninges, the cerebella were dispersed into the same
buffer containing 0.025 % trypsin (Invitrogen) and
digested for 15 min at 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was
stopped by adding the same volume of Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen), supplemented
with
10
%
fetal
bovine
serum
(Invitrogen)
and
0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). After gentle trituration, digested tissues were
centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets
were suspended in the complete Neurobasal culture
medium supplemented with 2 % B27 (Invitrogen) and
0.5 mM GlutaMax (Invitrogen). After filtration through a
70 mm cell restrainer (BD Falcon, Vernon Hills, IL,
USA), cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml
onto poly-L-lysine coated plates (Becton Dickinson and
Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) or chamber glass
slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL, USA).
Cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of
5 % CO2 95 % air at 37 °C. Cytosine arabinofuranoside
(Invitrogen) (10 µl) was added to the cultures 24 h after
plating to arrest the growth of non-neuronal cells. Cul-
tures of 6 to 7 days in vitro were used in this study.
Immunocytochemical validation with antimicrotubule-
associated protein-2 antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) and 4-6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen)
revealed that more than 95 % of the cells in our culture
system were neurons at the time of experiment (data not
shown).
Cell culture treatments
We performed microarray analysis of gene expression in
four sets of rat primary neuronal cultures: controls;
treated with candesartan at concentrations in the range
of blood levels obtained in humans after oral administra-
tion [51]; exposed to excitotoxic glutamate concentra-
tions [25]; and treated with candesartan before the
exposure to glutamate. Excitotoxicity was induced by ex-
posing cultures to 100 μM glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich)
and pretreated for 1 h with vehicle (0.1 % saline and
0.1 N Na2CO3 at pH 7.4), or the AT1R blocker candesar-
tan (10 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 0.1 N Na2CO3,
pH 7.4. After addition of candesartan, the compound
was not removed and was present throughout the incu-
bation. Candesartan and glutamate concentrations and
timing of the experiments were selected on the basis of
prior studies demonstrating protection of cultured neu-
rons from inflammation and glutamate-induced injury
[25, 27]. Figure 1 is a flow chart for data analysis.
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted from CGC treated with vehicle,
CGC treated with candesartan, CGC treated with glutam-
ate and CGC treated with candesartan and glutamate.
Each group consisted of five independent experiments.
Standard procedures for labeling, hybridization, washing
and staining were as per manufacturer’s recommendation
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Briefly, the RNA was
purified using a RiboPure Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and
quantity of RNA were ensured using the Bioanalyzer
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and NanoDrop (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. For RNA la-
beling, total RNA (300 ng) was used in conjunction with
the Affymetrix-recommended protocol with the WT Plus
Reagent Kit catalog #902280. The hybridization cocktail
containing the fragmented and labeled complementary
DNAs (cDNAs) was hybridized to the Rat GeneChip 2.0
ST chips. The chips were washed and stained by the Affy-
metrix Fluidics Station using the standard format and pro-
tocols from Affymetrix. The probe arrays were stained
with
streptavidin
phycoerythrin
solution
(Molecular
Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and enhanced by using an
antibody solution containing 0.5 mg/ml biotinylated anti-
streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
The probe arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix Gene
Chip Scanner 3000. Gene expression intensities were cal-
culated using the Gene Chip Operating software 1.2 (Affy-
metrix). A GC-corrected robust multichip analysis (RMA)
normalization model was used to correct for background,
and nonspecific binding. All analyses were performed
using Partek Genomics Suite (Fig. 1). The raw data is sub-
mitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under acces-
sion GSE67036.

 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Aliquots from samples from the same experiment were
used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reac-
tion (qPCR) and for microarray analysis. For qPCR we
studied three individual independent samples, and each
sample was analyzed in triplicate.
To determine gene expression, total RNA was isolated
as indicated using 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen), followed by
purification using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Synthesis of cDNA was performed using 0.6 mg total
RNA and Super-Script III first-Strand Synthesis kit (Invi-
trogen). qPCR was performed on DNA Engine Opticon
(MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) with SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). qPCR was performed in a 20 μl reaction mixture
containing 10 μl SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, 4 μl
cDNA and 0.3 μM of each primer for a specific target.
Primers for qPCR were synthesized by BioServe (Beltsville,
MD, USA). The specific primers are listed in Additional
file 1 (Table S1). The remaining reagents for RNA isola-
tion and reverse transcription were from Invitrogen. The
amplification conditions consisted of one denaturation/
activation cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles
at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Serial dilutions of
cDNA from the same source as samples were used to
obtain a standard curve. The individual targets for
each sample were quantified by determining the cycle
threshold and by comparison with the standard curve.
The relative amount of the target mRNA was normalized
with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase.
Multiple group comparisons for data obtained by
qPCR were performed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls post-test. Statis-
tical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism
5 Software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
In all cases, data are accepted as statistically significant
given a probability value of ≤0.05.
Datasets description and microarray data mining
To compare our data to published datasets, we used GSEA
[52] (Fig. 1). The GSEA algorithm computes a ranked list
of all genes from a microarray comparison between two
conditions and identifies whether individual members of an
a priori functionally defined gene set (black vertical bars)
are enriched at either the top (red area) or bottom of the
ranked genes (blue area) or randomly distributed across the
whole ranked gene list, using a modified Kolmogorov-
Smirnov statistic. These predefined gene sets are part of a
functionally well-established and/or published pathway
from databases such as KEGG [53], BioCarta [54], Reac-
tome [55] and gene ontology. An enrichment score (green
graph) is calculated based on the level to which a gene set

 is overrepresented at the top (positive correlation) or bot-
tom (negative correlation) of the ranked gene list and is
calculated as the maximum deviation from zero. Genes
occurring at the very extreme (dark red or dark blue area)
on either side of the ranked list are weighted more heavily
compared with genes occurring in the middle (light red or
light blue area) of the ranked gene list that contain genes
that are not differentially expressed. Statistical significance
is defined by the p-value, which is also adjusted for mul-
tiple hypothesis testing. A gene set-based permutation test
of 1000 permutations was applied and genes were ranked
according to Student’s t statistic. All other parameters
were set to GSEA defaults [47, 48]. For a more compre-
hensive description of the GSEA [47, 48, 52] and the
Broad Molecular Signatures Database v5.0 (MSigDB) [56]
see [47, 48, 52]. The MSigDB actually consists of over
4000 different gene sets. Alternatively, we used microarray
datasets from the GEO database [57] to derive gene sets
that we then used for GSEA analysis. IPA [58] (Ingenuity
Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA) was used to identify
canonical pathways associated with the differentially
expressed genes. All of the differentially expressed genes
were included in the analysis.
Datasets from normal/Alzheimer’s disease whole hippo-
campus tissue comparisons (GSE1297 [59] GSE48350
[60], and GSE36980 [61]) and from laser capture micro-
dissected normal neuronal/endothelial cell comparisons
(GSE12679 [62] and GSE12293 [63]) were downloaded
from NCBI’s GEO database [57] and imported into Partek
Genomics Suite software (Partek, Inc., St. Louis, MI, USA)
(Fig. 1). After RMA normalization, differential gene ex-
pression was accessed by one-way ANOVA. For micro-
array cross-platform comparisons we used a p value of
<0.05 and a 1.2-fold change cutoff. Raw data from these
datasets were analyzed with Partek Genomics Suites under
similar conditions used for the CGC data. In order to
avoid cross-platform heterogeneity we focused only on
datasets generated on the Affymetrix chips.

postmortem normal and 22 Alzheimer’s disease patients

Results
Global gene expression analysis
Candesartan prevents glutamate-induced upregulation or
downregulation of multiple genes in primary neurons
Differential gene expression comparing results from
glutamate-treated neurons with those of vehicle-treated
neurons yielded over 1100 transcripts significantly up-
or downregulated by glutamate (Additional file 2: Table
S2). Differential gene expression shows over 800 tran-
scripts (including microRNAs and noncoding RNAs)
that are up- or downregulated when candesartan was
added prior to glutamate, as compared with those ex-
posed to glutamate only (Additional file 2: Table S2).
Candesartan
completely
prevented
the
glutamate-
induced up- or downregulation of 501 of these transcripts
(twofold or higher, p < 0.05; Additional file 2: Table S2).
Interestingly, the comparison of neurons treated with can-
desartan to the control untreated neurons generated only
a few genes with no functional annotation that may repre-
sent the system noise, confirming the fact that candesar-
tan does not have any significant effect on normal
neurons (Additional file 2: Table S2).
Confirmation of microarray results by qPCR
Candesartan prevents glutamate-induced gene
upregulation
We confirmed microarray results by determination of ex-
pression of a number of genes upregulated by glutamate

 exposure by qPCR. In all these genes, candesartan pretreat-
ment very significantly, and in many cases completely, pre-
vented glutamate-induced upregulation. The exception was
superoxide dismutase 2; in this case there was a clear trend,
but the results were not statistically significant (Fig. 2;
Additional file 3: Figure S1, Additional file 4: Figure S2 and
Additional file 5: Figure S3).
Pathway analysis
Specific diseases and functions, and upstream regulators
associated with glutamate exposure and candesartan
treatment
The list of functionally annotated genes from the glu-
tamate
versus
glutamate + candesartan
(423
unique
genes) was submitted to IPA analysis [58]. As a result,
cell movement, cell death and lesion formation, inflam-
mation and synthesis of reactive oxygen species, diabetes
and glucose metabolism, vascular disease and blood ves-
sel development came top of the list of diseases and
functions (Table 1; Additional file 6: Table S3). Many
genes within these pathways were up- or downregulated
by glutamate, and these changes were significantly pre-
vented by candesartan (Additional file 2: Table S2).
Within the IPA program, analysis of upstream regula-
tors of these differentially expressed genes included the
well-known inflammatory associated cytokines tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, IL-1β and interferon (IFN)
gamma, LPS, the growth factor transforming growth fac-
tor (TGF) beta-1, and five upstream regulator drugs
PD98059, SB203580, U0126, SP600125 and LY294002
(Table 2; Additional file 7: Table S4). Additional up-
stream regulators were amyloid precursor protein (APP),
retinoid acid (Tretinoin) and apolipoprotein E (APOE)
(Table 2; Additional file 7: Table S4).
Gene set enrichment analysis
Association with Alzheimer’s disease
To further define candesartan molecular and functional
pathways, we ran our glutamate versus glutamate + cande-
sartan CGC microarray data through GSEA [52]. As pre-
dicted, inflammatory pathways associated with IFN-γ,
TNFα, IL-1β and LPS, and several mechanisms of apoptosis

 were the most statistically relevant pathways (Fig. 3;
Additional file 8: Table S5 and Additional file 9: Table S9).
Genes upregulated by excitotoxic concentrations of glutam-
ate are associated with genes upregulated by the IFN-γ, IL-
6, IL-1β, TNFα and LPS-induced inflammation, involving
chemokine signaling, focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton,
apoptosis by nutrient deprivation and extracellular matrix
receptor interaction pathways. The glutamate-induced
upregulation of these genes was normalized by cande-
sartan treatment. Conversely, candesartan prevented
the glutamate-induced downregulation of genes associated
with neuronal function (cholinergic, dopamine and gamma-
aminobutyric acid A receptors) (Additional file 8: Table S5).
At the disease level, the GSEA shows a striking associ-
ation with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Additional
file 8: Table S5 and Additional file 9: Table S9). Genes that
are upregulated in a published dataset (GSE36980 [61];
Fig. 1) of hippocampus samples obtained from Alzheimer’s
disease patients strongly correlate with genes upregulated
in neurons exposed to glutamate (p value = 0.0, FDR = 0.09,
enrichment score = 0.75) (Fig. 4; Additional file 8: Table
S5 and Additional file 9: Table S9). Conversely, genes that
are downregulated in this published dataset strongly correl-
ate with genes downregulated in neurons exposed to glu-
tamate (Figs. 1 and 4; Additional file 8: Table S5 and
Additional file 9: Table S9).
Correlation of changes in gene expression in rat CGCs with
those reported in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease
Association of candesartan treatment in CGCs and captopril
treatment in APPswe mice
Gene expression affected by glutamate and glutamate–can-
desartan in our model shows perfect correlation with the
alterations in gene expression observed in the APPswe
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease treated with the ACEI
captopril (GSEA 46871) [64]. Genes that were upregulated
by glutamate in our study (effects prevented by candesar-
tan) have been reported to be downregulated by captopril
(p value = 0.0, FDR = 0.0, enrichment score = 0.60) and, in-
versely, genes downregulated by glutamate (this effect being
prevented by candesartan in our model) were upregulated
by captopril treatment in the APPswe mice (p value = 0.0,
FDR = 0.0, enrichment score = −0.30) (Figs. 1 and 5).
KEGG analysis
Association of differentially expressed genes in rat CGCs
and Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus
We used the KEGG [53] Alzheimer’s disease pathways
gene set to compare to genes differentially expressed in
postmortem hippocampus from Alzheimer’s disease pa-
tients (GSEA 48350) [60] (Fig. 1) and their counterpart in
our rat CGC study (Fig. 1). As seen in Table 3, within the
KEGG Alzheimer’s disease 56 genes network, 23 of them
are down regulated in hippocampus from Alzheimer’s dis-
ease patients (changes observed in GSE48350) and eight of
them are also downregulated by glutamate in our rat neur-
onal study. Changes in seven of these eight genes are pre-
vented by treatment with candesartan in our rat neuronal
study. Moreover, of the 14 genes upregulated in hippocam-
pus from Alzheimer’s patients, 12 were upregulated also by
glutamate in our study, and in turn all these changes were
prevented by candesartan treatment (Fig. 1 and Table 3).

 from Alzheimer disease patients and their preferential ex-
pression in neurons or endothelial cells and the possible
differential regulation of these genes by glutamate and glu-
tamate–candesartan in our neuronal study. To this end we
compared gene expression of two datasets generated from
hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease patients and normal
controls (GSE48350 [60] and GSE36980 [61]) with two
datasets generated from neurons and cerebrovascular endo-
thelial cells from normal human dorsolateral prefrontal cor-
tex, specifically isolated by laser capture microdissection
(GSE12293 and GSE12679) [62, 63]. We then compared
the
genes
predominantly
expressed
in
neurons
and
cerebrovascular cells in the Alzheimer’s samples with genes
regulated in our neuronal cultures by glutamate and by glu-
tamate–candesartan.
Using a 1.2-fold change cutoff and a p value below
0.05, we found 580 genes commonly up regulated in
both Alzheimer patient datasets (Fig. 6). Of these 580
upregulated genes, 166 and 124 were predominantly
expressed in cerebrovascular endothelial cells compared
to 19 and 6 for neurons within GSE12293 [63] and
GSE12679 [62] datasets, respectively. On the other
hand, there are 1430 genes commonly downregulated in
Alzheimer’s disease tissues. Of these, 381 and 329 were

 more expressed in neurons and only 38 and 27 were
expressed in cerebrovascular endothelial cells within
GSE12293 and GSE12679 datasets, respectively (Fig. 6).
We found striking correlations when we considered
the preferential cellular expression, as revealed by the
laser capture detection studies, with the gene expression
in hippocampus from Alzheimer’s disease patients and
with the results of our neuronal study. Most of the genes
upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus and by
glutamate in our neuronal study that were normalized
when candesartan was added to glutamate were of endo-
thelial origin (70 versus 4 and 48 versus 2 in GSE12293

FDR = 0, enrichment score = 0.83). Genes upregulated by IFNG, LPS and TNF are also upregulated by glutamate with the highest
enrichment score, p value and FDR (see Additional file 8: Table S5 and Additional file 9: Table S9 for more detail)

disease patients are upregulated by glutamate (p value = 0, FDR = 0, enrichment score = 0.75) and genes downregulated in Alzheimer’s disease
patients are also downregulated by glutamate (p value = 0, FDR = 0.31, enrichment score = −0.32)

 [63] and GSE12679 [62], respectively). Conversely, most
of the genes downregulated in hippocampus from
Alzheimer’s disease patients and by glutamate in our rat
CGC study, changes normalized when candesartan was
added to glutamate, were of neuronal origin (122 versus
18 and 74 versus 4 in GSE12293 [63] and GSE12679 [62],
respectively) (Fig. 6).
For the genes upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease and
by glutamate in our study, downregulated by candesartan,
and, predominately expressed in endothelial cells, the
pathway analysis revealed cellular movement/migration,
extracellular matrix proteins, apoptosis, angiogenesis and
vasculogenesis, and their most significant upstream regu-
lators are beta-estradiol and TGFβ1 (Additional file 10:
Figure S4, Additional file 11: Table S6 and Additional file
12: Table S7). On the other hand, genes upregulated in
Alzheimer’s disease and downregulated by candesartan
that are predominately expressed in neurons did not show
any pathway significance, most probably due to the low
number of genes.
Conversely,
genes
downregulated
in
Alzheimer’s
disease and by glutamate in our neuronal study,
which are upregulated by candesartan in our cultures,
were predominately expressed in neurons. Pathway ana-
lysis revealed neurological diseases, neurodegeneration,
neuronal apoptosis and disorders of
basal ganglia
(Additional file 13: Figure S5), and the most signifi-
cant upstream regulator was the nuclear factor, eryth-
roid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2, Nrf2) gene (Additional file 14:
Table S8).
Discussion
The overall goal of the study was to determine whether
glutamate-induced alterations in gene expression in our
primary neuronal culture were normalized by candesar-
tan, and whether these changes correlated with alter-
ations in gene expression in postmortem hippocampus
of Alzheimer’s disease patients. We hypothesized that, if
present, significant correlations would provide major
preclinical evidence of beneficial therapeutic effects of
candesartan.
There were several major findings in our study. Based
on our results, we propose that candesartan may be neu-
roprotective
on
neuronal
glutamate-induced
injury.
There
were
multiple
functionally
annotated
genes
strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease and impres-
sively correlated with alterations in gene expression in
autopsy samples from Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus.
We found novel functions differentially associated with

genes comparing the glutamate versus glutamate + candesartan groups in comparison with a list of genes upregulated (left) or downregulated

glutamate in our neuronal culture are downregulated by treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in the APPswe mouse
model (p value = 0, FDR = 0.0, enrichment score = −0.60). Inversely, genes downregulated by glutamate in our neuronal culture are upregulated
by treatment with an ACE inhibitor in the APPswe mouse model (p value = 0, FDR = 0, enrichment score = −0.30)

 genes predominantly expressed in neurons and in cere-
brovascular endothelial cells.
Candesartan profoundly influenced glutamate-induced
neuronal injury, since candesartan prevented glutamate-
induced alterations in gene expression in about 800 of
the over 1100 transcripts upregulated or downregulated
by glutamate (Additional file 2: Table S2). Candesartan
effects were unrelated to the proposed stimulation of
angiotensin II (AT2) receptors by AT1R blockade, since
AT2 receptors are not expressed in CGCs [25].
Using qPCR, we confirmed glutamate-induced upregu-
lation, normalized by candesartan, of a number of these
genes, including several factors with fundamental roles
in APP metabolism and Alzheimer’s disease, such as
ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 [65–67] and APOE
[68–72] (Fig. 2; Additional file 3: Figure S1, Additional
file 4: Figure S2 and Additional file 5: Figure S3).
Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogen-
esis of Alzheimer’s disease [6, 7, 73, 74]. Glutamate
excitotoxicity
upregulated
many
pro-inflammatory
genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease [25, 75–89]
and were normalized by candesartan (Fig. 2; Additional
file 3: Figure S1, Additional file 4: Figure S4 and
Additional file 5: Figure S3). Glutamate also upregu-
lated the expression of some genes involved in anti-
inflammatory processes, and candesartan prevented
these changes (Fig. 2; Additional file 3: Figure S1,
Additional file 4: Figure S2 and Additional file 5: Figure
S3) [31, 90–93]. We hypothesize that while glutamate
increases inflammation, at the same time it sets in mo-
tion a powerful anti-inflammatory response that is not
necessary when the inflammatory response is prevented
by candesartan.
Under the conditions of our experiments, we found
that, when added after glutamate injury, candesartan
does not protect neurons from cell injury [25]. We inter-
preted that candesartan administration, although it may
not reverse glutamate-induced cell injury which has
already occurred, will prevent further glutamate-induced
injury. Since glutamate excitotoxicity is a long-term
process during progression of Alzheimer’s disease [3, 8–
10, 12], we believe our results are translationally rele-
vant.
The IPA analysis of the
list
of functionally
annotated genes with their expression altered by glutam-
ate and normalized when compared with the glutamate
+ candesartan group (over 400 genes) supported the pro-
posed key role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer’s disease, [6, 7], agreed with the demonstrated
major anti-inflammatory effect of candesartan [22, 27],
and revealed many additional and novel diseases and
functions, such as cell death and lesion formation,
diabetes and glucose metabolism and vascular disease

Alzheimer’s
disease
[4,

(Table 1; Additional file 6: Table S3).
Furthermore, IPA analysis of upstream regulators of
these genes included APP, APOE and retinoic acid (Tre-
tionin), which play major roles in Alzheimer’s disease
[65–72] (Table 2; Additional file 7: Table S4) and re-

 over inflammatory genes was similar to that revealed by
candesartan in our study [94, 95]. In support of the
present findings, we have earlier reported that AT1R
blockade prevents glutamate-induced ERK1/2, JNK and c-
Jun activation [25, 29], demonstrating that the effect of
candesartan is upstream of ERK1/2-p38MAPK.
GSEA supported the findings revealed by IPA. Inflam-
matory, chemokine signaling, focal adhesion, actin cyto-
skeleton, apoptosis and extracellular matrix receptor
interaction pathways were most relevant, and the ex-
pression of the associated genes, upregulated by glutam-
ate, was normalized by candesartan (Fig. 3; Additional
file 8: Table S5). Conversely, candesartan prevented the
glutamate-induced downregulation of genes associated
with neuronal function (Additional file 8: Table S5).
Many genes (19 out of 53) in the KEGG Alzheimer’s
disease reference pathway were altered in postmortem
Alzheimer’s disease patients and by glutamate and
normalized by candesartan. The pathways included
mitochondrial dysfunction, APP processing, including
β-secretase (BACE1), apoptosis, DNA damage, lipid
peroxidase, Ca2+ signaling pathway and Ca2+ overload
(Table 3).
Most remarkably, GSEA showed a striking association
between changes observed in our neuronal culture and
those observed in published datasets of hippocampal
samples obtained from Alzheimer’s disease patients.
Genes up- or downregulated in Alzheimer’s disease
hippocampus [59–61] strongly correlated with genes up-
or downregulated in neurons exposed to glutamate and
prevented by candesartan (Fig. 4 and Table 3; Additional
file 8: Table S5 and Additional file 9: Table S9).
Our results indicate that although the primary neurons
studied here, CGCs, are not the primary targets for
Alzheimer’s disease [44–46], upon glutamate injury they

Fig. 6 Cellular origin of gene expression in Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus. There are 580 genes upregulated (red) and 1430 downregulated
(blue) differentially expressed transcripts in hippocampus from Alzheimer’s disease patients which are common to both GSE48350 and GSE1297
datasets. On the top side (blue block), the expression of these genes is then looked up in two datasets (GSE12293 and 12679) of normal laser
capture microdissected neurons and cerebrovascular endothelial cells. On the bottom side (green block), the expression of these genes is
compared to those differentially expressed in rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) treated with glutamate alone versus glutamate + candesartan and
then looked-up in the two datasets (GSE12293 and 12679) of normal laser capture microdissected neurons and cerebrovascular endothelial cells
(orange block). Note that the majority of the commonly expressed genes downregulated in Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus and upregulated by
candesartan have a predominant expression in neurons. Conversely, the majority of the commonly expressed genes upregulated in Alzheimer’s
disease hippocampus and downregulated by candesartan have a predominant endothelial expression

 those revealed in human hippocampal autopsy samples.
Some of the glutamate-induced injury mechanisms ob-
served in CGCs have been replicated in primary cortical
neuronal cultures [25]. While analysis of postmortem
samples has limitations because of the premortem ago-
nal process and postmortem changes in glutamate me-
tabolism, there was a striking correlation in alterations
in gene expression between the two independent pub-
lished datasets evaluated in our study. Furthermore, the
normal
controls
used
for
the
Alzheimer’s
disease
postmortem samples were also postmortem samples
normalized for age and gender. Moreover, there were
impressive correlations between our neuronal culture
findings and those revealed in a mouse model of Alzhei-
mer’s disease (Fig. 5), supporting the validity of our com-
parative analysis.
The predominant cellular expression of the genes
altered in Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus and in
our neuronal culture revealed two different patho-
logical processes (Fig. 6). Multiple genes, upregulated
in Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus and by glutamate
in our neuronal culture, and normalized by candesar-
tan, were predominantly expressed in human cerebro-
vascular endothelial cells when compared to neurons.
IPA analysis of these genes revealed cellular move-
ment/migration, extracellular matrix proteins, apop-
tosis,
angiogenesis
and
vasculogenesis
as
principal
functions controlled by these genes, and their most
significant upstream regulators were TGFβ1 and beta-
estradiol. TGFβ1 has been strongly associated with
microvascular alterations in Alzheimer’s disease [99].
There is substantial evidence for a role of beta-estradiol,
and in particular hippocampus-synthesized 17β-estradiol
in synaptic plasticity and cognition [100, 101] and for neu-
roprotective effects of nonfeminizing estrogens [102]. The
glutamate-induced upregulation of genes selectively over-
expressed in cerebrovascular endothelial genes strongly
supports the proposed role of alterations in the mi-
crovasculature in Alzheimer’s disease, not only as a
risk factor but also playing a major role in its patho-
genesis [4, 103–108].
Conversely, pathway analysis of genes predominantly
expressed in human neurons when compared to human
cerebrovascular endothelial cells and downregulated in
Alzheimer’s disease hippocampus and by glutamate in
our
neuronal
cultures,
normalized
by
candesartan
(Fig. 6), revealed neurological diseases, neurodegenera-
tion, neuronal apoptosis and disorders of basal ganglia
as principal related diseases. For these genes, the most
significant upstream regulator was the NFE2L2 or Nrf2
gene that has been associated with the early stages of
Alzheimer’s disease [109]. These results are concordant
with the well-known loss of neural function in Alzheimer’s
disease.
It is tempting to speculate that pathological processes
in Alzheimer’s disease may be based on two sequential
and/or concomitant processes: enhanced inflammation
in microvascular endothelial cells and neuronal injury.
Although candesartan is a drug that was designed to
work on the hypertensive endothelial vascular system,
our data indicates that candesartan may directly protect
neurons from injury, a proposal supported by a previous
observation [27].
Our report adds novel findings to the substantial body
of evidence strongly suggesting that blockade of AT1R is
a new avenue for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease
[22, 110]. Preclinical experiments indicate that excessive
brain angiotensin II activity through overactivation of
brain AT1R leads to cognitive loss associated with hip-
pocampal long-term potentiation blockade, inhibition of
the cholinergic system and stimulation of Aβ production
and tau phosphorylation [22, 26, 111]. Of note, AT1R
gene expression is upregulated by glutamate, and this
change is normalized by candesartan (Additional file 2:
Table S2).
Conversely, in preclinical models, AT1R blockade
ameliorates hypertension, traumatic brain injury, brain
ischemia and diabetes, the main modifying risk factors
for Alzheimer’s disease, effects that include reduction of
cognitive loss [22]. In addition, AT1R blockade amelio-
rates cognitive loss in most of the rodent models of
Alzheimer’s disease by reducing brain inflammation, ex-
cessive oxidative stress and in some cases decreasing Aβ
production, oligomerization, tau phosphorylation and
reducing blood flow [22, 26, 31, 110–114].
Supporting the role of enhanced AT1R activity in
Alzheimer’s disease, there was a correlation between
alterations in gene expression in the APPswe mouse
model of Alzheimer’s disease treated with captopril, an
ACEI reducing angiotensin II formation, and those
found in our study [64] (Fig. 5). ARBs reduce inflam-
mation in human circulating monocytes exposed to
LPS [28, 115], and prevent glutamate-induced neuronal
apoptosis [25]. Clinical studies demonstrate that AT1R
blockers reduce major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease,
[22, 110, 116]; observational and cohort studies reported
that AT1R blockade delayed development of Alzheimer’s
disease and protect cognition [22, 117]. There are increas-
ing calls to conduct randomized controlled trials to effect-
ively test the hypothesis that AT1R blockade may be a
novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease [22, 117–119], and in particular including patients
at the very early stages of the disease [120].
The mechanism of candesartan neuroprotection from
glutamate excitotoxicity has been associated with block-
ade of the glutamate NMDA receptor [25]. In addition,
candesartan neuroprotection may involve an increase in
glutamate uptake into the cell [121]. Furthermore, AT1R
Elkahloun et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy  (2016) 8:5 
Page 14 of 18
 blockade may not be the only mechanism responsible
for the neuroprotective effect of candesartan. Some
ARBs, in particular telmisartan and candesartan, are
powerful activators of a major neuroprotective mechan-
ism,
the
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma (PPARγ) [22, 25, 28, 33], and PPARγ activation
plays a significant role in neuroprotection from glutam-
ate excitotoxicity in cultured CGCs [25].
Our gene analysis revealed major associations of the
gene alterations reported here with Parkinson’s disease,
neurological diseases and neurodegeneration. These ob-
servations support the hypothesis that ARB neuroprotec-
tion may not only be effective in Alzheimer’s disease, but
also in other neurodegenerative diseases [22, 23, 110].
Conclusions
Our data may be interpreted as evidence of direct neu-
roprotective effects of candesartan in neurons, and of
common disease processes that may underlie the in vitro
acute gene alterations reported here and long-term
mechanisms of cell injury in the late stages of Alzheimer’s
disease. We provide novel evidence for candesartan neu-
roprotection through early molecular mechanisms of in-
jury in this illness, such as glutamate-induced neuronal
injury. Candesartan not only prevents inflammation but
also novel pathogenic mechanisms such as risk factors for
the disease and alterations in APP processing and mito-
chondrial function. The differential glutamate-induced
alterations in genes preferentially expressed in cere-
brovascular endothelial cells or neurons indicate the
possibility of two different and interrelated pathogenic
mechanisms, revealing multiple targets for candesar-
tan neuroprotection. Our report supports the proposal to
use ARBs as drugs of choice for the treatment of early
cognitive loss.
