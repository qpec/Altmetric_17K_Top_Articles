Case Report
Introduction
Skin disorders are among the most common medical conse-
quences of short visits to developing countries.1 Myiasis or 
cutaneous infestation by developing larvae (Greek, myia = a 
fly) is the fourth most common travel-associated skin disease.2 
Dermatobia hominis, commonly known as human botfly, is 
found in Central and South America, from Mexico to Northern 
Argentina, excluding Chile.3 We present the case of a patient 
who acquired D hominis while she was on a short vacation in 
Belize. In this report, we discuss the presentation, differential 
diagnosis, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic approaches of 
human botfly lesion to raise the awareness about human botfly.
Presentation
The patient is a 36-year-old female, presenting to the 
Department of Internal Medicine in Tampa General Hospital, 
reporting a lesion in her left inguinal area that she noticed 2 
months prior after returning from her trip to Belize. She 
stated that she might have been bitten by an insect; however, 
she was unsure. While she was in Belize, she went horseback 
riding after which she found a tick on her back. She removed 
the tick immediately and states that it was present on her for 
no more than an hour. Once she returned to the United States, 
she went to her previous primary care physician who 
prescribed antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole. She completed the 
antibiotic course, but only saw a 50% improvement in the 
erythema surrounding the lesion without papule resolution. 
She requested her medical care to be transitioned to Tampa 
General Hospital where she reported the lesion (Figure 1A) 
initially had surrounding erythema, which has resolved. 
However, there was an indurated papule with a central open-
ing that expressed opaque fluid on manipulation. The patient 
reported that it was previously pruritic. She denied previous 
similar lesion, contact to similar lesion, rashes, fevers, chills, 
bleeding, fatigue, or any other new-onset symptoms. Possible 
cyst, infectious, or foreign body/ingrown hair were consid-
ered as differential diagnoses. Previous attempt to remove 
suspected foreign body or hair has been unsuccessful. The 
internist referred the patient for a dermatologist for consulta-
tion and further evaluation.
This consultation was unsatisfactory as the patient inde-
pendently sought a second opinion from our wound care 
facility at Memorial Hospital. Reexamination of the lesion

Abstract
Dermatobia hominis, commonly known as the human botfly, is native to Tropical America. As such, cutaneous infestation 
by its developing larvae, or myiasis, is quite common in this region. The distinct dermatological presentation of D hominis 
myiasis allows for its early recognition and noninvasive treatment by locals. However, it can prove quite perplexing for 
those unfamiliar with the lesion’s unique appearance. Common erroneous diagnoses include the following: folliculitis, benign 
dermatocyst, and embedded foreign body with localized infection. We present a patient who acquired D hominis while she 
was in Belize. In this report, we discuss the presentation, differential diagnosis, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic approaches 
of human botfly lesion to raise the awareness about human botfly.

by a wound care specialist yielded evidence of a small hard 
mass underlying the papule on palpation. With this new find-
ing, the patient was referred to a general surgeon for mass 
extraction. Following local anesthesia, a 5 mm surgical inci-
sion across the lesion was made and the suspected foreign 
object was removed (Figure 1B). The foreign object was sub-
sequently sent to pathology for identification and analysis. 
Pathology identified the object as a human botfly larva. With 
the larva removed, the lesion completely resolved by the 
patient’s follow-up visit at the wound care facility a week 
later.
Discussion
Myiasis caused by D hominis is rarely seen in the United 
States. However, it is very common among residents and 
visitors of the tropical regions of the Americas.4 The female 
human botfly lays her eggs on the body of an intermediate 
host (eg, a mosquito or a fly), which acts as a vector onto the 
human skin when it feeds.5 The heat of the skin causes the 
eggs to hatch into larvae, which breathe through a central 
punctum. Unlike other family members of botflies, the larva 
of the human botfly does not migrate far into the skin from 
its point of entrance.6,7 The larval stage in the skin tissue can 
last between 27 and 128 days before the adult larva drops to 
the ground where it pupates for between 27 and 78 days 
before maturing into an adult botfly. The adult form of the 
human botfly is rarely seen and ranges between 1 and 3 cm 
long. The whole life cycle lasts between 3 and 4 months.8
Furuncular myiasis, caused by D hominis larvae, presents 
as a hard raised lesion in the skin with central necrosis—
sometimes painful and pruritic. It mostly affects the limbs, 
though presentation on the genitals, scalp, breast, and eye 
has been reported.9-12 In some cases, the patients can feel the 
larvae moving when they shower or cover the wound.13 
Because of the unspecific symptoms and low incidence of D 
hominis in the United States, misdiagnosis or delayed 
treatment of the lesion happens frequently as our patient 
experienced. High clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose 
these types of lesions.
Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of fly larvae or 
maggots. However, complete blood cell count may show 
elevated levels of leukocytes and eosinophils as the pres-
ence of the larva in the skin often triggers a local inflamma-
tory response with the migration and proliferation of 
inflammatory cells including neutrophils, mast cells, eosin-
ophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.14-16 Imaging may 
be needed for patients with atypical presentations in unusual 
anatomical sites.17 Magnetic resonance imaging can be used 
in cases of cerebral, breast, facial, orbital, and furuncular 
myiasis. Computed tomography scan has also been sug-
gested.18 Additionally, ultrasonography is very useful in 
establishing the diagnoses and in determining the size of the 
larvae. Quintanilla-Cedillo et al19 have described using 
Doppler ultrasonography utilizing a high-resolution (10-
MHz) soft-tissue transducer. This allowed for early visual-
ization of the larvae to confirm myiasis when lesions were 
small, had minimal secretions, and the punctum was absent, 
a point where the lesion can often be mistaken for a simple 
insect bite. In these cases, high-resolution Doppler ultraso-
nography was demonstrated to be both 100% sensitive and 
specific in diagnosis.
In a review of tropical myiases, McGarry20 stated that the 
slowly growing, often painful boil-like furuncular lesion of 
D hominis, which contains a deeply embedded maggot, 
requires surgical removal. However, most cases of D hominis 
do not require invasive surgery and can be treated by the 
patients themselves through noninvasive approaches. Local 
residents in Belize suffocate the larvae by applying occlusive 
substances,21 for example, placing petroleum jelly, bacon 
strips, nail polish, or plant extracts over the central punctum. 
Several hours after occlusion the larvae will emerge head-
first seeking air, at which time, tweezers may be used to 
physically extract it or apply pressure around the cavity

aiding in the larvae expulsion. Generally, larvae emerge 3 to 
24 hours after application of the occluding agent.22,23 Despite 
the fact that these approaches affect the oxygen requirements 
of the larvae and encourage migration on their own, some-
times the larvae suffocate without migration from the skin 
and this might lead to incomplete extraction and secondary 
infection that precipitate surgical removal.
Surgical removal with local anesthesia is the treatment of 
choice for D hominis lesion. During surgical removal, a 
local anesthetic is applied and the lesion is excised; the 
wound is then debrided of remaining necrotic tissue and 
closed. This achieves complete removal of the larvae and 
prevents a secondary infection. Another method involves 
the injection of lidocaine into the base of the lesion. This 
creates a buildup of fluid pressure that forces the larvae out 
of the punctum.24 Alternatively, a 4- to 5-mm punch exci-
sion of the overlying punctum and surrounding skin may be 
performed. This grants greater visibility and better access to 
the larva, which can then be removed using toothed for-
ceps.25 These methods are necessary as the larva cannot be 
removed through the central punctum; the larvae have 
evolved a tapered shape and rows of spines and hooks that 
prevent simple extraction. If attempted, simple extraction 
may result in retained portions of the larvae resulting in 
infection or an inflammatory reaction. Whichever technique 
is applied, it is recommended to thoroughly clean the result-
ing wound and apply an antiseptic dressing. Should the pro-
cedure result in a secondary infection, oral or topical 
ivermectin (1% solution) is indicated. Although it is quite 
rare to see cases of botfly lesions in the United States, their 
accurate diagnoses and early treatment is critical to avoid 
any possible complications or mistreatment.
