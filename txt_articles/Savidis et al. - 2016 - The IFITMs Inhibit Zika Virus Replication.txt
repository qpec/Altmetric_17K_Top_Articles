In Brief
Savidis et al. find that the IFITMs block
Zika virus replication, including that of a
recently isolated strain from Cambodia.
Importantly, this protection translates
into a large reduction in Zika-virus-
induced cell death. The authors develop
an imaging assay and determine that
IFITM3 blocks the very earliest stages of
Zika virus infection.

SUMMARY
Zika virus has emerged as a severe health threat with
a rapidly expanding range. The IFITM family of re-
striction factors inhibits the replication of a broad
range of viruses, including the closely related flavi-
ruses West Nile virus and dengue virus. Here, we
show that IFITM1 and IFITM3 inhibit Zika virus infec-
tion early in the viral life cycle. Moreover, IFITM3 can
prevent Zika-virus-induced cell death. These results
suggest that strategies to boost the actions and/or
levels of the IFITMs might be useful for inhibiting a
broad range of emerging viruses.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus has emerged as a severe health threat by virtue of its fast
paced global spread and its associated morbidities, including
microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome (D’Ortenzio et al.,
2016;Driggersetal.,2016;Haugetal.,2016;LazearandDiamond,
2016;Mussoand Gubler,2016;Rasmussenetal.,2016).Zikavirus
was initially isolated from an infected macaque in Uganda in 1947,
and the first human cases were reported in 1952. Similar to the
closely related dengue virus, Zika virus is primarily spread via
the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. In 2007, Zika virus
emerged in Micronesia and expanded its range to Southeast
Asia. Zika virus was identified in Brazil in May 2015 and has since
led to widespread infection in Central and South America.
Zika virus illness has been described as self-limited and mod-
erate in severity with the common findings of malaise, headache,
fever, joint aches, a maculopapular rash, and inflammation of the
conjunctiva (Haug et al., 2016; Lazear and Diamond, 2016). How-
ever, an alarming number of birth defects, including micro-
cephaly, have been attributed to Zika virus infection occurring
in the first two trimesters of pregnancy (Driggers et al., 2016;
Haug et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016). In addition, an up-
surge in reported cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which man-
ifests as a symmetric ascending flaccid paralysis, have recently
been associated with Zika virus infection. Multiple reports have
demonstrated that Zika virus can be sexually transmitted via in-
fected seminal fluid, with resultant infection of pregnant mothers;
the risk of sexual transmission may persist for months after
remission of clinical illness (D’Ortenzio et al., 2016). These events
have led to Zika virus being declared a public health emergency
by the World Health Organization.
We andothers havefound thatthesmallmembrane-associated
interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) can inhibit
the replication of a wide range of pathogenic viruses, including all
flaviviruses tested to date, includingWest Nilevirus, dengue virus,
and reporter viruses carrying the envelope of the Omsk hemmo-
rhagic fever virus (Bailey et al., 2014; Brass et al., 2009; Chesarino
et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2015; Everitt et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2011;
Perreira et al., 2013; Tartour et al., 2014). Murine models of Zika
virus pathogenesis require an absence of type I interferon (IFN)
signaling, suggesting that IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) can pre-
ventheightened levels ofinfection(Lazearet al.,2016).Furtherev-
idence for the protective role of ISGs comes from work showing
that placental cells can resist Zika virus infection due to actions
of IFN-l (Bayer et al., 2016). In light of these data, and given
that IFITMs are potent inhibitors of flaviviral infection, we wished
to determine their effect on Zika virus replication. Using both
loss- and gain-of-function examples, we found that both IFITM3
and IFITM1 inhibit the replication of a prototype lab strain of
Zika virus first isolated in Africa in 1947 (MR766) (Dick et al.,
1952), as well as a more recent strain isolated from a child in
Cambodia in 2010 (FSS13025) (Haddow et al., 2012). We found
IFITM3 to be more potent than IFITM1 in its inhibition of Zika virus
replication. Consistent with this, the loss of a specific endocytosis
motif required for the proper localization of IFITM3 is necessary
for maximal viral restriction (Jia et al., 2014; John et al., 2013).
We also revealed that Zika virus causes a cytopathic effect in
HeLa cells and that IFITM3 modulates this phenotype. These
data examine the role that specific ISGs might play in the intrinsic
immune system’s defenses against Zika virus and further extend
the important role played by the IFITMs against viral infection. Our
data,andthoseofothers,alsosuggestthatmethodsofenhancing
the actions of IFITMs could serve to ameliorate the global impact
on human health created by the expansion of Zika virus, as well as
the challenges posed by other emerging viral infections.
RESULTS
IFITM3 Modulates Zika Virus Replication and
Cytopathicity
In view of the established role of the IFITMs in the anti-viral
response against multiple flaviviruses, we wished to examine
the effect of IFITM3 on Zika virus infection (Brass et al., 2009;
Cell Reports 15, 2323–2330, June 14, 2016 ª 2016

 John et al., 2013). We found that depletion of IFITM3 via a
stably transduced short hairpin RNA (shIFITM3) in human cervi-
cal carcinoma (HeLa) cells increased Zika virus replication as
demonstrated by increased expression of Zika-virus envelope
(E) protein staining with a flavivirus cross-reactive antibody that
recognizes the E protein, 4G2 (Figure 1A). We obtained similar re-
sults by assessing viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with a re-
combinant J2 (rJ2) monoclonal antibody (data not shown). In
keeping with these results, IFITM3-overexpressing cells potently
blocked viral infection as compared to the shScramble control
cells (Figure 1A). We note that the shIFITM3 used in this study
spares IFITM1 expression but targets a nearly identical region
of both IFITM2 and IFITM3, which differ by only 11 amino acids
(Figure S1A) (Feeley et al., 2011; Perreira et al., 2013). Further-
more, we have not found an antibody that can discriminate be-
tween endogenous IFITM2 and IFITM3, therefore the increased
susceptibility of the shIFITM3 cells to Zika virus infection repre-
sents the depletion of both endogenous IFITM2 and IFITM3,
with the latterlikely playing the predominant role (see Discussion).
Zika virus infection has been reported to cause the death of
Vero cells but not of human or murine fibroblasts (Way et al.,
1976). We therefore wanted to confirm that Zika virus infection

immunostained for the viral envelope (E) protein
using monoclonal antibody 4G2 (green). The

caused the death of HeLa cells and
whether the loss or gain of IFITM3
impacted this effect. We found that there
was a moderate amount of cell death de-
tected after Zika virus infection of the
shScramble control cells and that this ef-
fect was ameliorated with overexpression
of IFITM3 (Figures 1B and 1C). Impor-
tantly, the loss of IFITM2 and IFITM3 (shI-
FITM3 cells) enhanced the susceptibility
of the cells to viral cytopathic effect. We
saw similar results when using both the MR766 and FSS13025
strains, with the MR766 strain displaying a stronger cytopathic ef-
fect. We conclude that IFITM2 and IFITM3 are required for cellular
resistance to Zika virus replication and cytopathicity and that the
overexpression of IFITM3 can potentiate this protection.
IFITM1 Inhibits Zika Virus Replication, and the Proper
Localization of IFITM3 Is Needed for Its Full Restriction
of Viral Replication
We next tested whether overexpression of the IFITM3 paralog,
IFITM1, impacted Zika virus replication. IFITM1 and IFITM3
have been shown to have partially overlapping specificities of
viral inhibition, with IFITM1 being more potent against viruses
that enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomal pathway
and IFITM3 preferentially acting more strongly against viruses
that enter in the late endosomal pathway, such as dengue virus
or influenza A virus (Bailey et al., 2014; Chesarino et al., 2014b;
Perreira et al., 2013). In keeping with these observations, over-
expressed IFITM1 did inhibit Zika virus replication (MR766
and FSS13025 strains), but to a lesser extent than IFITM3,
with the caveat that we cannot compare the levels of these
two untagged proteins directly (Figures 2A–2C). An IFITM3

 mutant, Y20A, which harbors a mutation in a clathrin-mediated
endocytosis motif required for proper protein localization in the
endosomal pathway, also demonstrated a moderately reduced
ability to block viral replication (Jia et al., 2014; John et al.,
2013).
Deletion of the Murine Ifitm3 Locus Leads to Increased
Zika Virus Infection In Vitro
Murine Ifitm3 has been shown to prevent viral replication in vitro
and also to stop severe influenza in vivo (Brass et al., 2009; Ever-
itt et al., 2012; Feeley et al., 2011). Therefore, we compared
Ifitm3+/+, Ifitm3�/�, and Ifitm3�/�Ifitm3 mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts (MEFS) in the setting of Zika virus infection (MR766 strain),
with the latter null cells complemented in trans with a stably
transduced murine Ifitm3 cDNA (Lin et al., 2013). These studies
revealed an increase in infection in the Ifitm3�/� cells, which
was prevented by exogenously expressed Ifitm3 (Figures 3A–
3C). We conclude that Ifitm3 protects mouse cells from Zika
infection, similar to its role in human cells.
IFITM3 Inhibits the Early Stages of Zika Virus Replication
The IFITMs have been shown to restrict viral replication by block-
ing fusion-pore formation and the entry of the viral genome and
its associated proteins into the cytosol (Bailey et al., 2014; Brass
et al., 2008; Feeley et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013;
Perreira et al., 2013). Therefore, we tested whether altering the
levels of IFITM3 could inhibit the early stages of Zika virus infec-
tion by using an imaging assay we designed to detect Zika virus
RNA. Zika virus (MR766, MOI 50–100) was incubated on ice with
HeLa-shScramble, -shIFITM3, and -IFITM3 cells to permit viral
binding but prevent endocytosis. Warm media was then added,
and at the indicated time points, the cells were washed with cold
PBS, incubated with or without trypsin, fixed, immunostained,
and confocally imaged with a probe set that recognizes Zika

 virus RNA. We found that the loss of IFITM3 resulted in increased
viral RNA signals (in terms of both intensity and number) as
compared to the shScramble control cells (Figures 4A and 4B,
Figure S1B). Consistent with this, the overexpression of IFITM3
resulted in little to no detectable viral RNA signals in the cytosol.
Given that IFITM3 prevents the fusion of multiple viruses, these
results suggest that this assay only recognizes viral RNA once
it has exited the viral particle and entered the cytosol subsequent
to fusion-pore formation; attempts to detect viral RNA fixed to
the cell surface in time-zero samples not treated with trypsin
showed little to no viral RNA signal, supporting this notion
(data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility
that some viral RNA transcription occurred at these early time
points post-infection, and thus it remains possible that the
IFITMs act after viral fusion but prior to early viral RNA
transcription.

tion of Zika Virus
(A) HeLa cell lines were incubated on ice with Zika
virus MR766 (Uganda, 1947) at an MOI of 100. At
time zero, warm media was added and the cells

capture a centrally located area within the cells.

mean intensity of the red viral RNA signals of n = 3

was used to calculate the indicated p value shown
in the table.
Of note, at time zero we saw no differ-
ences in viral binding (either in signal in-
tensity or number) to the cell surface
across the three cell lines when using
samples that were incubated with virus
then immediately fixed and immuno-
stained for viral E protein (Figures S1C–
S1F). We also estimate that the larger
‘‘spots’’ of viral signals (E protein and viral
RNA) represent multiple viruses or viral
RNAs that are close together and beyond
the resolution of this assay, which is
360 nm for the E protein and 400 nm for
the viral RNA. Therefore, with individual
Zika viruses estimated to be z50 nm in
size, our imaging assays are not capable
of discriminating between individual vi-
rions and are thus useful for evaluating
the relative level of viral signals rather
than
their
absolute
numbers.
Taken
together, these studies reveal that IFITM3
inhibits the early stages of Zika virus
infection that occur after viral-host binding but before either
the viral RNA’s cytosolic entry or its early transcription.
DISCUSSION
Zika virus has emerged as a threat to global health, with the most
severe effects being seen in resource-limited areas (Lazear and
Diamond, 2016; Musso and Gubler, 2016; Rasmussen et al.,
2016). Therefore it is important to learn all that we can about
preventing and treating Zika virus infections. Toward that goal,
we have tested the effect of the anti-viral proteins, IFITM3 and
IFITM1, on Zika virus replication.
These studies showed that both IFITM1 and IFITM3 inhibit
Zika virus infection. Moreover, IFITM3 is likely the more potent
of the two restriction factors when cells encounter Zika virus,
and its effect is dependent on its proper localization within the

 endosomal pathway. Although the shIFITM3 used in this work
targets both IFITM2 and IFITM3, the Ifitm3�/� MEF studies argue
that IFITM3 plays the predominant role in blocking Zika virus
replication. These findings are in keeping with our earlier studies
that revealed the anti-viral actions of the IFITMs against the
closely related flaviruses West Nile virus and dengue virus (Brass
et al., 2009; John et al., 2013). Together, these data clearly
demonstrate that IFITMs are potent inhibitors of several major
emerging viruses and as such warrant further investigation into
strategies to enhance their levels and/or actions. Further studies
using Ifitm-deficient mice to assess the in vivo implications of
these findings are warranted (Everitt et al., 2012; Lange et al.,
2008).
IFITM3 has been shown to be required to prevent influenza
A virus infections in both humans and mice (Bailey et al., 2012;
Brass et al., 2009; Everitt et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; Perreira
et al., 2013). Individuals homozyogous for the IFITM3 allele,
rs12252-C, are at increased risk of severe influenza (Everitt
et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013). While rare in
individuals of European ancestry, the rs12252-C allele is more
prevalent in Asia and Micronesia. Given the recent expansion
of Zika virus into these regions, it will be of interest to determine
whether this allele is also a risk factor for more severe infections
in both mothers and fetuses and whether this might in any way
contribute to the risk of Zika-virus-associated birth defects.
Our data show that IFITM3 inhibits the early stages of Zika
virus replication. The exact mechanism of IFITM-mediated re-
striction is unknown; however, the results of orthologous exper-
imental approaches suggest that the IFITMs directly alter the
properties of the cell and/or viral membrane, resulting in a block
to fusion-pore formation (Brass et al., 2009; Desai et al., 2014;
Feeley et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Perreira
et al., 2013; Tartour et al., 2014). Given that our studies show
that IFITM3 elicits a profound decrease in the early intracellular
levels of Zika virus RNA, a similar mechanism of action most
likely underlies this inhibition. IFITM3’s relatively higher basal
level of expression as compared to IFITM1, together with its early
block to viral replication, suggests that IFITM3 may provide an
important initial defense against Zika virus infection, prior to
the induction of a full complement of ISGs. More work is now
required to better understand how the flaviviruses are blocked
by the IFITMs in the hope that this knowledge can be used to pre-
vent and treat a broad range of expanding viral infections that
now threaten human health.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cells and Culture Conditions
TZM-bl HeLa cells (Figures 4 and S1, NIH AIDS Reagent Repository no. 8129,
from John Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu), H1 HeLa cells (Figure 1, ATCC), and Vero
(ATCC) and A549 cells (ATCC) were grown in complete DMEM (Sigma) with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen).
Viruses
Zika virus strains were kindly provided by Robert Tesh at the World Reference
Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Med-
ical Branch in Galveston, Texas: FSS13025, isolated from a patient in
Cambodia in 2010 (Haddow et al., 2012) and MR766, originally obtained
from a Rhesus macaque in Uganda in 1947. Zika viruses were propagated in
Vero cells (ATCC) (Dick et al., 1952), and the titer was determined by standard
plaque assays and immunofluorescence imaging assays for E protein expres-
sion (Brass et al., 2009; John et al., 2013).
Plasmids
The following shRNA sequence (sense strand, shIFITM3) was cloned into the
pLK0.1 shRNA puro lentiviral vector to create retroviruses used to stably trans-
duce cells as described (Feeley et al., 2011): 50-CCTCATGACCATTCTGCT
CATC-30. Alignment of this shRNA sequence with IFITM3 is as follows:

MEFs
Adult Ifitm3+/� mice were intercrossed, and MEFs were derived from embryos
at day 13.5 of gestation to produce homozygous Ifitm3�/� and the matching
wild-type control MEFs (Everitt et al., 2012). The stable exogenous expression
of Ifitm3 in the null cells has been previously described (Everitt et al., 2012).
MEFs were cultured in DMEM with the addition of MEM, non-essential amino
acids, sodium pyruvate, 2-Mercapto-ethanol (GIBCO), and 15% FBS and
2mM L-glutamine.
Cell Viability Assays
Equivalent numbers of H1 HeLa cells (HeLa-shScramble, -shIFITM3, or
-IFITM3) were plated on white 96-well plates (Corning) and 24 hr later were
infected with either Zika virus MR766 Uganda 1947 or Zika virus FSS13025
Cambodia 2010 at an MOI of 1. After 3 days of infection, the plates were
removed from the incubator and after equilibration to room temperature,
Cell Titer Glo reagent was added (diluted 1:16 in D-PBS). After 20 min incuba-
tion, the relative light units were read with a Luminoskan Ascent Microplate
Luminometer (Thermo Fisher, kindly provided by Peter DiStefano, Elixir
Pharmaceuticals).
Immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysates were prepared with Laemmeli buffer and resolved by SDS-
PAGE. The samples were then transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Milli-
pore) and probed with the indicated antibodies. Anti-IFITM3 anti-sera (Abgent,
AP1153a) was used at 1:250. Anti-IFITM3 from Abcam (Anti-Fragilis (ab15592))
was used at 1:500. Anti-IFITM1 (Proteintech, catalog no. 60074-1-Ig) was used
at 1:1,000. Actin (Sigma, catalog no. A2228-200UL) was used at 1:5,000. Sec-
ondary anti-Rabbit HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson Immuno Research,
211-062-171) and anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson Immuno
Research, 115-035-003) were used at 1:10,000.
Immunofluorescence Studies
Cells were fixed in 4% formalin (Sigma) in D-PBS (Sigma) for 10 min, followed
by a wash with D-PBS. Blocking was performed for 30 min in 1% BSA
(BioPharm, 71-010) in D-PBS containing 0.3 M glycine (Sigma, G7126). Cells
were next incubated in the 4G2 hybridoma supernatant diluted 1:2 (clone
D1-4G2-4-15; Millipore, MAB10216) or recombinant J2 (rJ2) anti-dsRNA anti-
body (Kerafast, ES2001) in 1% BSA in D-PBS for at least 1 hr, followed by three
washes with D-PBS. Cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies
Alexa Fluor Goat anti-mouse 488 (Life Technologies, A11001) diluted
1:1,000 in D-PBS containing 1% BSA. Cells were washed three times with
D-PBS before being mounted to slides using Vectashield with DAPI (4’, 6’-di-
amidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories, H-1200). Samples were then
imaged with either a confocal microscope or an Image Xpress Micro (IXM)
2328

 scanning microscope. Using a pinhole of 0.9 a.u. on the confocal microscope,
the resolution of the imaging assay for viral E protein and viral RNA is 360 nm in
the 488 channel (E protein) and 400 nm in the 550 channel (viral RNA); flavivi-
ruses are estimated to be 50 nm, so we are not able to discriminate individual
virions by using this confocal microscope. All microscope settings were kept
constant throughout the entirety of a given experiment.
Zika Virus RNA Imaging Assay
Cells were fixed in 4% formalin in D-PBS for 10 min, followed by a wash with
D-PBS. The staining was done with the QuantiGene ViewRNA ISH Assay Kit
(Panomics, Affymetrix, QVC0001) and a Zika virus RNA probe (Panomics,
Affymetrix, VF1-19981). Samples were permeabilized in 13 detergent (Pano-
mics, Affymetrix) (103 stock diluted in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature, fol-
lowed immediately with two washes in 13 PBS. Samples were then treated
with protease (Panomics, Affymetrix) diluted 1:1,000 in 13 PBS for 15 min at
room temperature, then immediately washed three times with 13 PBS. Zika
virus probe set was diluted 1:50 in pre-warmed (40�C) probe set diluent
and added to samples which were then incubated at 40�C for 3 hr in a
humidified chamber. Samples were washed three times with ViewRNA
wash buffer (Panomics, Affymetrix). Pre-Amp was diluted 1:25 in pre-
warmed (40�C) amplifier diluent and added to samples for 30 min at 40�C in
a humidified chamber. Samples were washed three times with ViewRNA

Samples were washed three times with ViewRNA wash buffer. Label probe
was diluted 1:25 in pre-warmed (40�C) label probe diluent and added to
samples for 30 min at 40�C in a humidified chamber. Samples were washed
three times with ViewRNA wash buffer before being mounted to slides using
Vectashield with DAPI (4’, 6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories,
H-1200).
Confocal Image Quantification
Fluorescence intensity was quantified with FIJI software. The intensity was
measured as the average fluorescence intensity per cell. First, the image file
was opened in the FIJI software, and the cell to be measured was outlined
with the ‘‘freehand selections’’ tool to define the ROI (region of interest), using
the differential interference contrast (DIC) image as a guide. After setting
the ROI, the intensity was quantified with the measure tool (selected from
Analyze > Measure). Next, a region outside of the cells was selected to
determine the background fluorescence of the image. The measured values
were then recorded into a Microsoft Excel file for further analysis. The intensity
value measured for the cell had the background intensity subtracted to obtain
the net intensity for the cell. Multiple cells (n > 12) for each condition were
measured and the average ± SD of the net intensity was calculated for each
condition across the experiment. To make differences across the conditions
easier to appreciate, the average net intensity values were then normalized
to the control condition of each experiment by dividing the average and SD
for each condition by the average of the control condition. Data were then rep-
resented graphically.
Zika Virus E Protein and Viral RNA Signal Quantification
12-bit multichannel images were opened with the free online software program
FIJI. The cell of interest was outlined with the freehand selections tool, using
the DIC channel as a guide. The threshold was set to a minimum of 900
and maximum of 4,096 for the viral staining (E protein or viral RNA). The
number of individual foci was quantified with the analyze particles tool
(Analyze > Analyze Particles). The size range of counted foci was 1-infinity
pixels, to remove background in the quantification. Foci counts per cell were
recorded for all cells in each condition (R12 cells per condition per experiment)
in a Microsoft Excel document and represented as a bar graph using the mean
and SD.
