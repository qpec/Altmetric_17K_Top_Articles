Adoptive cell transfer utilizing tumour-targeting cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is one of the
most effective immunotherapies against haematological malignancies, but significant clinical
success has not yet been achieved in solid tumours due in part to the strong immunosup-
pressive tumour microenvironment. Here, we show that suppression of CTL killing by
CD4 þCD25 þFoxp3 þ regulatory Tcell (Treg) is in part mediated by TGFb-induced inhibition
of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production, leading to a decrease in T cell receptor
(TCR)-dependent intracellular Ca2 þ response. Highly selective optical control of Ca2 þ
signalling in adoptively transferred CTLs enhances T cell activation and IFN-g production
in vitro, leading to a significant reduction in tumour growth in mice. Altogether, our findings
indicate that the targeted optogenetic stimulation of intracellular Ca2 þ signal allows for
the remote control of cytotoxic effector functions of adoptively transferred T cells with
outstanding spatial resolution by boosting T cell immune responses at the tumour sites.

 T
cell-based immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful
treatment option for several types of cancer1. However, this
success has not yet been transferred to solid tumours,
due
in
part
to
the
strong
immunosuppressive
tumour
microenvironment2–6. Systemic or intratumoural delivery of an
immune-boosting molecule to overcome local suppression has
been proposed, but the full potential of this approach is limited by
non-specific stimulation of tumour growth, metastasis and
angiogenesis7–9.
During normal immune responses, Tregs suppress T cell
effector functions by generating immunosuppressive adenosine,
cyclic AMP (cAMP), or anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10,
TGF-b, IL-35), and by consuming IL-2 (refs 10,11). Furthermore,
Tregs can cause effector T cell death via granzyme and perforin,
and
suppress
activation
of
T
cells
by
downregulating
costimulatory molecules on antigen presenting cells (APCs) via
CTLA-4 (refs 10,11). In addition to this indirect regulation,
Tregs have been shown to directly impair CD8 þ T cell effector
functions by compromising the release of lytic granules on
recognition of antigens on target cells12,13. Although, active
regulation by Tregs plays a critical role in modulating host
immunity,
growing
evidence
suggests
that
FoxP3 þTregs
negatively affect overall survival in the majority of solid
tumours14. In particular, decreased ratios of CD8 þ T cells to
Foxp3 þ Treg cells among tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes have
been directly correlated with poor prognosis in ovarian, breast
and gastric cancers15–17. Despite its key regulation of anti-tumour
immune responses, the molecular mechanisms underlying Treg-
mediated immune suppression in the tumour microenvironment
are unclear. In this study, we used an optogenetic approach to
control cytotoxic functions of CTLs with light stimulation. Our
study revealed that highly selective optical control of Ca2 þ
signalling in adoptively transferred CTLs was sufficient to
overcome Treg-mediated immunosuppression at the tumour
site, leading to a significant reduction in tumour growth in the
mouse melanoma model.
Results
Suppression of CTL-mediated cytotoxicity by Tregs. To deter-
mine the mechanisms of Treg-mediated immune suppression at
the tumour site, we first measured the kinetics of Treg responses
in a mouse melanoma model. C57BL/6 mice injected intrader-
mally in the ear with B16F10 tumour cells developed solid
tumours with steady increases in both absolute numbers
and ratios of Foxp3 þCD4 þ Treg cell population (Fig. 1a;
Supplementary Fig. 1). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the
majority of Tregs in the tumour showed activated and terminal
effector
Treg
phenotypes
(CD25highICOShighCTLA-4high18;
Fig. 1b). The increased effector Treg cell counts in the tumour
implied that these cells might play a key role in the loss of
concomitant tumour immunity.
When exposed to target tumour cells, CD8 þ cytotoxic T cells
(CD8 þ
Tc) directly release cytotoxins, including perforin,
granzymes and granulysin. Granzymes enter the cytoplasm of
the tumour cell through a pore formed by perforin, and the serine
protease function activates caspase cascades leading to tumour
cell apoptosis. Therefore, the release of granule contents accounts
for the most direct and final step in CD8 þ Tc effector function.
Although
multiple
mechanisms
underlying
Treg-mediated
immune suppression have been proposed19, little is known
about the role of Treg in regulation of the direct tumour killing
process of CD8 þ Tc. To address this, we first seup an in vitro
three cell killing assay, where OVA-loaded murine lymphoma
EL-4 cells were co-cultured with CD8 þ Tc prepared from OT-I T
cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice in the presence of resting
naive (rTreg) or activated effector (aTreg) Tregs. CD8 þ Tc alone
displayed
strong
cytotoxicity
(Annexin-V þ
or
Propidium
iodide þ) against peptide-pulsed EL-4 (Fig. 1c). Preincubation
of CD8 þ Tc with aTreg for 16 h completely abolished the
tumouricidal functions of CD8 þ Tc, while incubation with rTreg
had a lesser effect on the levels of cytotoxicity (Fig. 1c).
Importantly, expression of key effector molecules that directly
induce CD8 þ Tc-mediated tumour killing, such as perforin and
granzyme B, was not changed by co-incubation of CD8 þ Tc with
aTreg (Fig. 1d). Instead, the impaired cytotoxicity was mainly
associated with a decrease in granule exocytosis as measured by
surface expression of CD107a (Fig. 1e). First, we suspected that
the observed suppression of granule exocytosis and cytotoxic
functions of CD8 þ Tc could be attributed to the Treg-mediated
inhibition of the TCR itself or TCR-proximal signals (Fig. 1f).
However, rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3z in OT-I
CD8 þ Tc on incubation with OVA-loaded EL-4 cells was not
suppressed by co-incubation with aTreg (Fig. 1g). In addition, we
detected similar levels of ZAP-70 phosphorylation in CD8 þ
Tc both in the absence and presence of aTreg (Fig. 1g).
The granule-mediated target cell killing of CD8 þ
Tc is
strictly calcium-dependent and requires store-operated Ca2 þ
entry (SOCE)20–22. Orai1 and stromal interaction molecule 1
(STIM1) were identified as the molecular constituents of the
calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel in T cells
(Fig. 1f)23,24. Therefore, we next turned our attention to T cell
store-operated Ca2 þ entry activity and assessed whether Tregs
suppress CD8 þ Tc lytic granule exocytosis by directly down-
regulating Orai1 and/or STIM1 expression. Again, co-incubation
of CD8 þ Tc with aTreg did not affect Orai1 and STIM1
expression levels (Fig. 1g). These results suggest that Tregs have a
minimal impact on TCR activation and CRAC expression.
TCR activation induces hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-
(4,5)-bisphosphate into inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) by
PLCg, which induces the release of Ca2 þ from ER stores by
activating
IP3-receptor
(Fig.
1f).
However,
Tregs
did
not
significantly
change
IP3-receptor
expression
in
CD8 þ
Tc
(Fig. 1h, left). Surprisingly, Tregs caused a significant decrease
in TCR-induced IP production in CD8 þ Tc (Fig. 1h, right),
which led to a dramatic reduction of both TCR (first peak)- and
ionomycin (second peak)-induced intracellular Ca2 þ responses
in CD8 þ Tc (Fig. 1i) and NFAT1 dephosphorylation (an effector
molecule downstream of Ca2 þ signals in T cells) (Fig. 1j). Earlier
studies reported that Treg cells directly suppress tumour-specific
CD8 þ
T
cell
cytotoxicity
through
TGFb
signals25,26.
Importantly, it was shown that TGFb suppresses Ca2 þ influx
in activated T cells in part through the inhibition of interleukin-2
tyrosine
kinase
(ITK)-mediated
PLCg
activation27,28.
Similarly,
aTreg-mediated
suppression
of
CD8 þ
Tc
anti-
tumour cytotoxicity was significantly decreased by the TGFb
superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase receptor inhibitor

(Fig.
1k),
suggesting
that
the

suppression
of tumour killing through intracellular Ca2 þ
signals is, at least in part, TGFb-dependent.
Ca2 þ signal and CD8 þ T cell cytotoxic functions. The finding
that Tregs directly inhibit the TCR-dependent granule exocytosis
and tumouricidal functions of CD8 þ Tc by suppressing IP3
production, and Ca2 þ influx suggests that strong intracellular
Ca2 þ signals in CD8 þ Tc can enhance release of cytotoxic
granules and thus boost CTL functions at tumour sites. To study
the effects of increased intracellular Ca2 þ on T cell effector
functions, we used the well-characterized OT-I TCR transgenic
mouse and altered peptide ligand (APL) system (OVA257–264; N4:
SIINFEKL & G4: SIIGFEKL). G4 peptide is an OVA variant
peptide with a single amino acid change at the highly exposed

production and degranulation in response to the weak-affinity
antigen G4 (Fig. 2b–d, Supplementary Fig. 2). Consistently,
ionomycin treatment improved the killing of G4-loaded EL-4
target cells to a level close to that achieved against a high-affinity
antigen (N4)-loaded EL-4 cell (Fig. 2e).
Local immunosuppressive cells, such as Tregs, can impair the
effector functions of CTLs by inhibiting lytic granule release after
recognition of the target cell12,30. Therefore, our data led us to
hypothesize that boosting intracellular Ca2 þ signals in CTLs may
augment the lytic granule-dependent killing of target cells, even
under the strong suppression by Tregs. To test this hypothesis, we
co-cultured N4 peptide-loaded EL-4 cells with OT-I CD8 þ Tc in
the presence of activated effector Tregs (aTregs). Preincubation of
CD8 þ Tc with aTreg significantly reduced the tumouricidal

 effects (Fig. 2f). However, unlike our prediction, we failed
to detect any improved cytotoxic activity of CD8 þ Tc after
stimulation with ionomycin. Surprisingly, addition of ionomycin
in the assay further suppressed CD8 þ Tc-mediated target cell
killing (Fig. 2f). This suppression in the CD8 þ Tc response by
ionomycin
treatment
was
likely
due
to
the simultaneous
activation of Treg functions, as measured by the increased total
TGF-b release from Tregs in the presence of ionomycin (Fig. 2g).
Our data strongly suggest that delivery of non-specific Ca2 þ
agonists to the tumour site will not provide the expected level of
antitumour cytotoxicity by CD8 þ Tc. Instead, it may cause
aberrant activation of local immune suppressive cells and thus a
stronger suppression of CD8 þ Tc functions. Therefore, a more
targeted and deliberate approach to selectively boost Ca2 þ signals
only in CD8 þ Tc at the tumour site is needed.
Optical control of intracellular Ca2 þ signal in CD8 þ T cells.
In hippocampal neurons, expression of CatCh, a new variant of
channelrhodopsin, showed an accelerated membrane Ca2 þ per-
meability, with 70-fold greater light sensitivity compared to that
of wild-type channelrhodopsin 2, resulting in superior optoge-
netic control of intracellular Ca2 þ influx31. In this study, we used
CatCh to selectively deliver Ca2 þ activation signals only to the
adoptively transferred CTLs in vivo, without interfering with
endogenous Ca2 þ signals in other cell types in the tumour
microenvironment. To test the specific Ca2 þ signals controlled
by CatCh, we imaged (Ca2 þ)i in HEK293 cells transfected with
CatCh. Fluorescence imaging of (Ca2 þ)i demonstrated that

 functional expression of CatCh (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Movie 1).
Furthermore, light stimulation of CatCh-expressing OT-I CD8 þ
Tc
was
sufficient
to
drive
prominent
intracellular
dephosphorylation of NFAT1 and cytokine production (IFNg)
in CatCh-expressing cells, but not in WT control cells or under
dark conditions, indicating the feasibility of the remote activation
of T cell Ca2 þ signaling by light stimulation (Fig. 3b,c). The
ability of CatCh to control the cytotoxic functions of CD8 þ Tc
was further confirmed by light stimulation of CatCh-expressing
OT-I CD8 þ Tc during co-incubation with G4-loaded EL-4 target
cells. Optical stimulation of CatCh-expressing OT-I CD8 þ Tc
yielded a significant increase in target cell killing comparing
to dark condition (Fig. 3d). An important advantage of CatCh is
its ability to deliver highly selective Ca2 þ stimulation in CTLs
and thus boost their effector functions without activating other
immunosuppressive cells, such as Tregs, at the tumour site. We
demonstrated
this
ability
by
light
stimulation
of
CatCh-
expressing
OT-I
CD8 þ
Tc
during
co-incubation
with
N4-loaded EL-4 target cells in the presence of aTregs. Light
activation of CatCh-expressing OT-I CD8 þ Tc significantly
increased killing of target cells, allowing them to successfully
overcome the Treg-mediated suppression (Fig. 3e).
TCR activation induces IP3–mediated release of Ca2 þ from ER
stores. After depletion of these Ca2 þ stores, the Ca2 þ sensor
STIM1 activates highly selective Orai1 Ca2 þ channel. This
channel is located at the plasma membrane, and is responsible for
store-operated Ca2 þ entry from outside of the T cell. In contrast,
CatCh is a cell-membrane calcium channel that can bypass the
IP3 generation and the depletion of Ca2 þ stores and induce
Ca2 þ influx directly through the membrane. Therefore, the
different modes of Ca2 þ signaling may induce different down-
stream signaling responses in T cells. To test whether induction of
Ca2 þ influx by light stimulation of CatCh can recapitulate the
physiological functions of Orai1 channels during CTL killing, we
generated T cell specific Orai1 conditional knockout (KO) mice
by crossing Orai1fl/fl mice32–35 to Cd4-Cre mice. Deletion of
Orai1 gene expression in CD8 þ T cells was validated by PCR
(Supplementary Fig. 3). CD8 þ T cell differentiation, activation,
and expression of effector molecules (perforin and granzyme B)
in Orai1 KO CD8 þ Tc were comparable to those in WT CD8 þ
T cells (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 4). However, lytic granule
exocytosis and killing of target EL-4 cells were severely altered in
Orai1 KO CD8 þ Tc (Fig. 3f,g). Importantly, light stimulation
of CatCh-expressing Orai1 KO CD8 þ Tc partially restored

 the cytotoxic function of CTLs (Fig. 3h). These results, in
combination with the earlier Treg data, support the conclusion
that CatCh can be functionally expressed in CD8 þ T cells to
allow photoactivatable control of Ca2 þ signals and boost T cell
mediated tumour killing using remote light stimulation within the
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment.
Optical control of CD8 þ T cell functions at the tumour sites.
To demonstrate the clinical implications of CatCh-mediated
immune boosts, we examined the ability of CatCh to enhance the
cytotoxicity of adoptively transferred tumour-specific CD8 þ Tc
and to improve antigen-specific tumour regression. In this study,
we used the Pmel-1 TCR transgenic mouse model, a well char-
acterized mouse tumour model for low-immunogenicity, which
expresses the Va1Vb13 TCR that recognizes an H-2Db-restricted
epitope corresponding to amino acids 25–33 of mouse gp100
(mgp100) on the B16 melanoma cells36. B16 melanoma cells
grow at a normal rate in Pmel-1 mice despite the presence of
overwhelming numbers of mgp100-specific CD8 þ T cells36
(Fig. 4a). Furthermore, antigen-specific vaccination with a self-
antigen, mgp100 or a mgp100 altered peptide ligand (for example,
human
gp100;
hgp100)
is
not
sufficient
to
improve
the
antitumour effects of adoptively transferred Pmel-1 T cells
against
B16
tumours
due
to
an
increase
in
the
local
CD4 þFoxP3 þ Treg cell population36,37. To determine whether
the activation of adoptively transferred CD8 þ Tc could be
enhanced in order to treat established solid tumours, we first
demonstrated that light stimulation of CatCh could deliver highly
selective Ca2 þ stimulation in Pmel-1 T cells and thus boost their
effector functions under the Treg-mediated suppression. Light
activation of CatCh-expressing Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc significantly
increased killing of hgp10025–33 peptide (KVPRNQDWL)-loaded
B16 target cells, allowing them to successfully overcome the
Treg-mediated suppression (Supplementary Fig. 5A). For in vivo
experiments, Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc expressing CatCh were adoptively
transferred
into
C57BL/6
mice
bearing
subcutaneous
B16
tumours established for 7 days, followed by vaccination with
mgp10025–33 (EGSRNQDWL) or hgp10025–33 peptide (Fig. 4b
and Supplementary Fig. 5B). Subsequently, the visible and
palpable tumour area was illuminated for 7 days, and tumour
growth
was
measured
for
an
additional
7
days
without
illumination. For long-term in vivo light exposure in freely
moving animals, a battery-powered wireless blue light emitting
diode (LED; 470 nm) was glued to the mouse ear skin (Fig. 4c and
Supplementary Fig. 6). The peak light output during light
stimulation was determined empirically at 0.1–5 mW
mm � 2
(470 nm, 3.67 mW
mm � 2 on average) at the surface of LED.
Dark mice were treated equally for a total of 21 days without light
stimulation. Localized light stimulation dramatically decreased
tumour growth in mice vaccinated with hgp10025–33 peptide
(Fig. 4d). Despite the low affinity for H-2 Db and brief half-life of
MHC complexes38,39, light stimulation of CatCh-expressing
Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc was also marginally effective in controlling
the tumour growth in mice vaccinated with the low avidity self-
peptide mgp10025–33 (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Light stimulation
of mice that received GFP-transfected Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc did not
alter tumour growth, indicating that the effect of 470-nm LED
light alone is not detrimental to the tumour cells (Fig. 4e). Flow
cytometry analyses of B16 tumours confirmed that local light
stimulation did not significantly change total T cell numbers nor
intratumoural Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc infiltration, compared to the
dark mice (Fig. 4f,g). However, local light activation substantially
increased the level of IFN-c expression (Fig. 4g).
To further test whether localized light activation of CatCh-
expressing CD8 þ Tc induces systemic effects and thus controls
non-illuminated tumour growth at a distal secondary site, we
adoptively transferred Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc expressing CatCh into
C57BL/6 mice bearing two subcutaneous B16 tumours at the ear
and flank, followed by vaccination with hgp10025–33 peptide.
Subsequently, the visible and palpable tumour area at the ear was
illuminated for 7 days, and tumour growth was measured at the
flank. Localized light activation dramatically increased the cell
surface expression of CD107a on Pmel-1 CD8 þ Tc at the
illumination site (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the enhanced Ca2 þ
signals in CatCh-expressing CTLs by light stimulation can not
only improve the cytokine production (Fig. 4g), but also promote
cytotoxic functions of CD8 þ Tc responses by inducing granule
exocytosis. The enhanced local CD8 þ Tc effector functions by
light stimulation at the ear significantly decreased tumour growth
both at the illuminated ear and non-illuminated flank (Fig. 5b).
These results strongly suggest that light stimulation of local
CD8 þ Tc function may trigger systemic effects and induce anti-
tumour responses outside the illumination field. Clinically, this
may be an important concept, and more investigation is needed
to determine the mechanism because, in view of the envisaged
application
of
our
approach,
treatment
of
solid
tumours
established in their metastases is equally important.
Growing evidence suggests that Tregs do not use only one
universal mechanism of immune suppression at the tumour
microenvironment, but rather execute suppressive functions
through several different modes19. Therefore it is possible that
the improved antitumour activity of CatCh-expressing CD8 þ Tc
by light stimulation in vivo may mediate a combination of
multiple processes other than direct induction of lytic granule
exocytosis from CTLs seen in our in vitro assays. Indeed, several
mechanisms have been proposed for the Treg-mediated direct
suppression of CD8 þ T cell anti-tumour effector functions,
which
include
Fas/FasL-dependent
T
cell
apoptosis40
and
suppression of effector T cells by releasing adenosine (Ado) and
PGE2 (refs 19,41). We addressed this possibility by light
stimulation
of
CatCh-expressing
OT-I
CD8 þ
Tc
in
the
presence of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), CGS21680 (A2A receptor
agonist) or PGE2. Light activation allowed CatCh-expressing
OT-I CD8 þ Tc to successfully overcome A2A receptor- and
PGE2-mediated suppression of T cell activation in the presence of
Ag-loaded APC, but failed to reverse sFasL-mediated T cell
apoptosis (Fig. 5c–e).
In addition to Treg, tumour-resident myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells (MDSCs) can further counteract proper CTL effector
functions at the tumour microenvironment. To test whether
optical stimulation of Ca2 þ signals can reverse MDSC-induced
CTL killing inefficiency, we stimulated CatCh-expressing OT-I
CD8 þ Tc with light during co-incubation with N4-loaded EL-4
target cells in the presence of MDSCs. Light activation of CatCh-
expressing OT-I CD8 þ Tc significantly increased killing of target
cells, allowing them to partially overcome the MDSC-mediated
suppression (Fig. 5f). Therefore, our data suggest that light
stimulation of CatCh in vivo not only improves the lytic granule
exocytosis (Fig. 5a), but also boosts suppressed CTL responses by
multiple inhibitory factors derived from both Treg and MDSC.
Discussion
In conclusion, we discovered that Treg-mediated suppression of
CTL killing in vitro is not associated with changes in several
important TCR-proximal signals but is in part mediated by
TGFb-induced inhibition of IP3 production, which directly
decreases intracellular Ca2 þ responses and T cell degranulation
in vitro. Highly selective optical control of Ca2 þ signals in CTLs
at the tumour site was sufficient to overcome Treg-induced
immunosuppression and dramatically improve the efficacy of
adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy in vivo. Although direct

chimeric antigen receptors has emerged as a powerful treatment
option mainly for lineage restricted, non-essential targets in
haematologic cancers1, the results of clinical trials focusing on
solid tumours have been much less encouraging42 in part due to

However, as a result of their pleiotropic effects, systemic delivery
often has severe side effects that have greatly limited their use.

 interference with normal functions43. Importantly, light offers
outstanding spatial resolution, allowing access to specific cellular
subtypes and even the smallest subcellular domains. Therefore,
our optogenetic approach described in this study will allow the
remote control of CTL effector functions at tumour sites with
outstanding specificity and temporospatial resolution.
A potential caveat of our approach is that the computed
average of vertical light penetration into the mouse skin can reach
only 300 mm in depth according to the light-power density
profiles of our in vivo tissue illumination system43. This result
suggests that our optical stimulation (Fig. 4c) can deliver a
functionally active light gradient only to a tumour established in
the surface of organs (for example, the skin dermis). Another
significant constraint in the current system is that the LED has to
be wired to the main power source to generate stable light
emission. In view of the clinical application of our approach,
treatment of solid tumours established in deep tissues and/or
their metastases may be equally important. Recently several
groups developed fully wireless and implantable optogenetic
stimulation tools44,45. These small size optoelectronics consists of a
power receiving coil, circuit and LED and can be fully implanted
into deep tissues. Importantly, this miniaturized wireless device
allows subjects to move freely. It could be the subject of a future
study to determine whether this completely wireless, ultrathin,
biocompatible LED can deliver light to a tumour established in
patient’s deep soft tissues and activate T cells at the tumour site.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6J, TCR-transgenic OT-I mice and CD4-cre mice were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory. The Orai1 floxed (C57BL/6 background) mice were a
generous gift from Drs Yousang Gwack and Sonal Srikanth. Orai1fl/fl mice were
bred to CD4-Cre mice to yield T cell-specific Orai1–deficient mice. Orai1fl/flCD4-
Cre mice were bred to TCR-transgenic OT-I mice to yield Orai1fl/flCD4-Cre
OT-I mice. The mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions. All mouse
experiments were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources at
the University of Rochester.
Cell lines culture. EL-4 mouse lymphoma cell line (American Type Culture
Collection) and B16F10 mouse melanoma cell line (American Type Culture
Collection) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin-
streptomycin. Around 293 T cells (American Type Culture Collection) and
Phoenix cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U
ml � 1 penicillin, 100 mg
ml � 1 streptomy-
cin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES buffer, 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino
Acid and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Cells lines were tested for mycoplasma con-
tamination by PCR analysis.
B16F10 tumour model. Approximately 2 � 105 B16F10 cells in 10 ml PBS were
intradermally injected into one ear pinna of a recipient C57BL/6 mouse. Twelve
weeks old mice of both genders were used in this study. Tumour growth was
monitored every week from day 7 after tumour injection. Tumour volume was
calculated as width2 � length � 0.52. The mice were killed on days 7, 14 and 21
post tumour injection. To analyse tumour samples, mouse ear tumours were cut
into small pieces and digested with collagenase/dispase (Roche, 10269638001) at
37 �C for 30 min.

were used for calcium imaging and the antibodies were cross-linked with goat anti-
hamster IgG ( #855397; 5 mg
ml � 1, MP Biomedicals).
T cell purification and activation. OT-I CD8 þ T cells were purified from single-
cell suspensions of lymph nodes of OT-I mice. Single-cell suspensions were pre-
pared by mechanical disruption using a cell strainer. OT-I CD8 þ T cells were then
enriched by magnetic-bead depletion with anti-mouse MHC Class II antibody
(M5/114) and anti-mouse CD4 antibody (GK1.5), followed by Low-Tox-M Rabbit
Complement (Cedarlane CL3051) and sheep anti-rat IgG magnetic beads (Invi-
trogen11035). For effector T cell differentiation, cells were stimulated with OVA
peptide (4 mg
ml � 1) and irradiated splenocytes for 5 days in IL-2 (50 U
ml � 1)
containing media. Regulatory T cells were purified from single-cell suspensions of
lymph nodes and spleens of 8-12 week-old C57BL/6J mice and enriched with a
CD4 þCD25 þ Regulatory T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-091-041)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To generate activated Tregs, purified
Tregs were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (3 mg
ml � 1) and anti-CD28
(3 mg
ml � 1) for 48 h in IL-2 (20 U
ml � 1) containing media.
Cytotoxicity assay. OT-I CTLs were co-cultured without with or without Tregs in
the presence of IL-2 (20 U
ml � 1) for 16 h. To measure OT-I CTL cytotoxicity,
fluorescent dye (CFSE or PKH-26)–labeled target EL4 cells were pulsed with Ova
peptide (N4 or G4) for 2 h. After washing EL-4 cells three times with PBS, EL-4
cells were added to OT-I CTLs with or without Tregs. After 5 h, cytotoxicity was
measured by flow cytometry after Annexin-V staining. MDSCs were isolated from
solid tumours using Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi
Biotec, 130-094-538). Approximately 2 � 106 EL-4 cells 100 ml PBS were injected
subcutaneously in the flank of recipient C57BL/6 mouse. After 24 days, tumours
were chopped into small pieces using scissor and digested with collagenase/dispase
(3 mg
ml � 1) for 1 h at 37 �C. Single cells were prepared by filtering through a
70 mm cell strainer. Gr-1 þ cells were isolated by using biotinylated anti–Gr-1
antibody and anti-biotin microbeads with LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-042-401).
Western blot. CFSE-labeled OT-I CTLs were isolated using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) from unlabeled EL-4 and aTreg in co-culture experiments.
For protein extraction, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, #89900)
and 1 � Halt protease & phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
#78440). Electrophoresis was performed on PAGEr Gold Precast Gels (Lonza,
#58522), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo
scientific, #88018). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk, the blots were incu-
bated overnight with the different primary antibodies used. All secondary anti-
bodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). SuperSignal West pico
(Thermo scientific, #32106) and Supersignal West Femto (Pierce, #34095) were
used to detect HRP on immunoblots with X-ray film (Pierce, #34090). Films were
scanned using a LiDE 210 Scanner (Canon). Important uncropped western blots
are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.
Inositol phosphate assay. After coculture with or without aTregs, OT-I CTLs
were labeled by adding 4mCi of [3H] inositol for 24 h in inositol-free F-10 media.
After labeling, LiCl was added directly to the labeling media at a final concentration
of 10 mM. After 10 min, peptide pulsed EL-4 were added to the plate. The final
volume of each well was 1 ml. The plates were placed back in to the incubator at
37 �C for 30 min. The cells were then washed were washed twice with cold PBS.
Ice-cold 50 mM formic acid, 1 ml, was added to the cells, which were placed on ice
for 30 min. After the incubation, the lysates were applied to Dowex AX1-X8 col-
umns and allowed to flow all the way through the column. The columns were
washed with 50 and 100 mM formic acid, followed by elution of the inositol
phosphate (IP)-containing fraction with 3 ml of 1.2 M ammonium formate/0.1 M
formic acid. The eluted fraction was mixed with 10 ml of scintillation fluid and
measured by liquid scintillation counting.
Calcium imaging. HEK293T cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-CatCh-
mCherry plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-030) on a Delta T
culture dish (Bioptechs, 04200417C). PKH-26-labeled OT-I CTLs were cocultured
with or without pre-activated Tregs before TCR stimulation. To measure intra-
cellular calcium release, the cells were loaded with 2 mg ml � 1 Fluo-4 AM
(Molecular Probes) at 37 �C for 30 min. The cells were resuspended in Leibovitz’s
L15 medium (Gibco) containing 2 mg
ml � 1 glucose and mounted on Delta T
culture dish (Bioptech). To excite Fluo-4 AM and stimulate CatCh, the cells were
imaged under FITC fluorescence filter for 15 min. Later, 2 mM ionomycin
(Invitrogen) was added to induce the release of maximum intracellular calcium.
CatCh expression in T Cells. CatCh sequence was cloned into the pMIGR-GFP
vector. CatCh and GFP control retroviruses were generated using the Phoenix-
ecotropic packaging cell line. For retroviral transductions, Phoenix cells were
transfected with the above plasmids to produce retroviruses using the calcium
phosphate transfection method. Virus-containing supernatant was collected at
2 and 3 days after transfection. OT-I CD8 þ T cells or Pmel-1 CD8 þ T cells were
transduced on day 1 after activation in the presence of 8 mg ml � 1 polybrene. The
cells were sorted based on GFP expression.
Light stimulation. Approximately 2 � 105 B16F10 cells in 10 ml PBS were intra-
dermally injected into one ear pinna of a recipient C57BL/6 mouse. Tumour size
was measured at day 7, and mice with a similar size tumour were selected for
experiments. Mice were vaccinated by intradermal injection of mouse ear skin with
10 ml PBS/IFA (Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant) emulsion containing 10 mg of
hgp10025–33 peptide (KVPRNQDWL). Then, 2 � 106 CatCh-expressing Pmel-1
CTLs or GFP-expressing Pmel-1 CTLs were injected either via tail vein or retro-
orbital injection. Blue LED emitters (Future electronics, LXML-PB01-0030) were
attached to the tumour site with glue. Lithium batteries were connected to blue
LED emitters and replaced daily. The design of the Battery-powered wireless LED
is described in Supplementary Fig. 5.
For in vitro light stimulation, an optical fiber was installed in CO2 incubator.
The fiber was coupled to an LED system (Doric Lens, LEDRV_2CH_1000) through
a blue LED module (Doric Lens, LEDC1-B_FC). The peak light output during 463-
nm light stimulation was estimated to be 17 mW
cm � 2 at the tip of the optic
fiber. Blue light pulses (1 Hz, 500 ms on, 500 ms off) were delivered by
Optogenetics TTL Pulse generator (Doric Lens, OTPG_4). The cells were cultured
in glass bottom 96-well plate (MatTek, P96G-1.5-5- F) for light illumination.
RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from collagenase/dispase-treated tumour
samples using RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, #74104). Complementary DNA(cDNA)
was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III First-Strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Invitrogen, #18080051). Real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler IQ5
system and SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, #1725201) using the following
primer pairs: GAPDH (forward: 50-CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTA-30 and
reverse: 50-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT-3), perforin (forward: 50-GAGAA-
GACCTATCAGGACCA-30 and reverse: 50-AGCCTGTGGTAAGCATG-30),
granzyme B (forward: 50-CCTCCTGCTACTGCTGAC-30 and reverse: 50-
GTCAGCACAAAGTCCTCTC-30), IL-2 (forward: 50-CCTGAGCAGGATGGA-
GAATTACA-30 and reverse: 50-TCCAGAACATGCCGCAGAG-30), IFN-g
(forward: 50-GGATGCATTCATGAGTATTGC-30 and reverse: 50-
CCTTTTCCGCTTCCTGAGG-30) and TNF-a (forward: 50-GACGTGGAACT-
GGCAGAAGAG-30 and reverse: 50-TTGGTGGTTTGTGAGTGTGAG-30). b-actin
(forward: 50-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-30 and reverse: 50-CCAGTTGG-
TAACAATGCCATGT-30) and Orai1 (forward: 50-GATCGGCCA-
GAGTTACTCCG-30 and reverse: 50-TGGGTAGTCATGGTCTGTGTC-30).
Statistical analysis. All statistical tests were done with GraphPad Prism and Jmp
Software (SAS). Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA with a
Bonferonni post-test, unpaired t-test, and Mann–Whitney when appropriate.
Differences were considered significant when P values were o0.05.
