IMPORTANCE Providing culturally competent care to the growing number of limited–English
proficiency (LEP) Latinos with diabetes in the United States is challenging.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate changes in risk factor control among LEP Latinos with diabetes who
switched from language-discordant (English-only) primary care physicians (PCPs) to
language-concordant (Spanish-speaking) PCPs or vice versa.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This pre-post, difference-in-differences study selected
1605 adult patients with diabetes who self-identified as Latino, whose preferred language
was Spanish, and who switched PCPs between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2013.
Study participants were members of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care
system (an integrated health care delivery system with access to bilingual PCPs and/or
professional interpreter services). Spanish-speaking and English-only PCPs were identified by
self-report or utilization data.
EXPOSURES Change in patient-PCP language concordance after switching PCPs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 8%),
poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 9%), low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) control (LDL < 100
mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) control (SBP < 140 mm Hg).
RESULTS Overall, 1605 LEP Latino adults with diabetes (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [13.1] years)
were included in this study, and there was a significant net improvement in glycemic and LDL
control among patients who switched from language-discordant PCPs to concordant PCPs
relative to those who switched from one discordant PCP to another discordant PCP. After
adjustment and accounting for secular trends, the prevalence of glycemic control increased
by 10% (95% CI, 2% to 17%; P = .01), poor glycemic control decreased by 4% (95% CI, −10%
to 2%; P = .16) and LDL control increased by 9% (95% CI, 1% to 17%; P = .03). No significant
changes were observed in SBP control. Prevalence of LDL control increased 15% (95% CI, 7%
to 24%; P < .001) among LEP Latinos who switched from concordant to discordant PCPs.
Risk factor control did not worsen following a PCP switch in any group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We observed significant improvements in glycemic control
among LEP Latino patients with diabetes who switched from language-discordant to
concordant PCPs. Facilitating language-concordant care may be a strategy for diabetes
management among LEP Latinos.

T
hirty percent to 40% of the more than 50 million Lati-
nos in the United States speak English less than “very
well” and may have limited English proficiency (LEP).1,2
For LEP Latinos seen by primary care physicians (PCPs) who
do not speak Spanish, language discordance may impede
delivery of culturally competent health care.3-5 Patients
with language-concordant PCPs have potentially better
communication, interpersonal process of care, patient-
centeredness, trust, and satisfaction with quality of care.6-11
However, the effectiveness of matching LEP patients to
language-concordant PCPs to improve health outcomes or re-
duce health inequalities has not been evaluated to our knowl-
edge and will unlikely be studied in a randomized trial due to
ethical and legal constraints.
Among patients with diabetes, LEP Latinos have higher
rates of poor glycemic control than English-speaking Latinos
or whites, but this inequality might be mitigated by care from
Spanish-speaking (ie, language-concordant) PCPs.12 In an in-
tegrated health care system with access to interpreter ser-
vices,wepreviouslyreported12thatLEPLatinoswithlanguage-
concordant PCPs had lower rates of poor glycemic control
compared with LEP Latinos with English-only PCPs (16% vs
28%). LEP Latinos with language-concordant PCPs have been
found to have better adherence to cardiometabolic medica-
tions than those with discordant PCPs.13 However, causal in-
ferences from such cross-sectional studies are limited by the
inability to establish that the exposure (ie, language barriers)
preceded the outcome of interest (ie, health outcomes).
We used a natural experiment to examine changes in gly-
cemic, lipid, and systolic blood pressure control among pa-
tients with diabetes who switched PCPs, focusing on LEP La-
tinos who switched from English-only (discordant) PCPs to
Spanish-speaking (concordant) PCPs (and vice versa) com-
pared with other PCP switches.
Methods
Study Setting and Cohort Construction
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) provides care
to approximately 3.9 million members in Northern Califor-
nia. Professional interpreter services are available at all medi-
cal facilities and departments, including the pharmacy and
laboratory; some facilities offer clinics staffed with bilingual
PCPs and employees and many written materials are avail-
able in Spanish.
Eligible study participants were adults from the KPNC
Diabetes Registry,14 who self-identified as Latino, whose pre-
ferred language was Spanish, and who switched PCPs at least
once. Patients were identified as LEP if Spanish was indi-
cated as their preferred spoken language in the KPNC elec-
tronic medical record.
There were 3511 patients who: (1) switched PCPs between
January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013; (2) were empaneled
with both the preswitch and postswitch PCP for at least 12
months; and (3) had continuous membership and prescrip-
tiondrugbenefits.Theswitchdatewastheadministrativestart
date (ie, date of empanelment) with a new PCP and marked
the end of care with the previous PCP. We excluded 525 pa-
tients who did not have at least 1 outpatient visit with each PCP
and excluded 1381 for whom we lacked Spanish proficiency
data for either the preswitch or postswitch PCP. This left a co-
hort of 1605 participants (1760 PCP switches).
Primary care physicians were identified as Spanish speak-
ing if they self-reported “high” fluency in Spanish15,16 or there
was evidence from utilization data that the PCP delivered care
inSpanishwithouttheaidofinterpreters.Self-reportdatacame
from the KPNC human resources department, which in-
quired about language proficiency at the time of hire or, sec-
ondarily, a PCP language research survey administered in
2012.17
In the absence of self-report, we relied on utilization data
that identified encounters with bilingual PCPs. If a PCP had 5
ormorevisitswithLEPLatinosduringtheyearandatleast80%
of those visits were coded “in-language care provided from bi-
lingual physician,” then the PCP was categorized as Spanish
speaking. If no visits were coded in that way, then the PCP was
categorized as English only (ie, did not speak Spanish). Pri-
mary care physicians who did not fall into either category were
classified as missing Spanish language proficiency. We con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis among PCPs for whom we had
both self-reported Spanish fluency (assumed to be gold stan-
dard) as well as utilization data and found that this algorithm
had 93% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Of the 1498 PCPs who
cared for the 3511 eligible patients, we identified Spanish lan-
guageproficiencyfor1044(44%fromself-reportand56%from
utilization data); 160 PCPs (15%) were Spanish speaking and
884 (85%) were English only.
EachLEPpatientwasclassifiedashavingeitheralanguage-
concordant (ie, bilingual, Spanish-speaking) PCP or language-
discordant (ie, English-only) PCP during the preswitch and
postswitchperiods.TheKPNCandUniversityofCalifornia,San
Francisco, institutional review boards approved this study,
waiving written informed consent.
Exposures
The exposure of interest was a change in language concor-
dance as a result of switching PCPs (ie, from discordant to con-
cordant or from concordant to discordant). LEP Latinos who
experienced a change in PCP language concordance were com-
pared with reference patients made up of LEP Latinos who
Key Points
Question Does glycemic control improve for limited–English
proficiency (LEP) Latinos with diabetes who switch from
English-only to Spanish-speaking primary care physicians (PCPs)?
Findings In this pre-post comparative study of 1605 LEP Latino
patients with diabetes who switched PCPs, it was found that there
was a significant 10% increase in the proportion of patients with
glycemic control among those who switched from an English-only
to a Spanish-speaking PCP compared with those who switched
from one English-only PCP to another.
Meaning Facilitating language-concordant care may be an
effective strategy for diabetes management among LEP Latinos
with diabetes.

switched PCPs with no change in concordance (ie, from dis-
cordant to discordant or from concordant to concordant).
Outcomes
We collected each patient’
s glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low-
density lipoprotein (LDL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) at
2 time points: the last recorded value prior to the switch date
andthelastvaluewithin12monthspostswitch.Themeantime
between the pre and post measures was approximately 1 year.
These continuous measures were categorized using recog-
nized cut-points based on the Healthcare Effectiveness Data
and Information Set (HEDIS) and American Diabetes Associa-
tion guidelines: glycemic control (HbA1c < 8%), poor glyce-
mic control (HbA1c > 9%), LDL control (LDL < 100 mg/dL), and
systolic blood pressure control (SBP < 140 mm Hg).18,19
Covariates
Data were collected from the KPNC electronic medical rec-
ordsandadministrativedatabases.Patientdemographicswere
self-reported in the electronic medical record. Primary care
physician age, sex and race/ethnicity came from the human
resources database. The reason for each PCP switch was ob-
tained from the administrative database, and we categorized
these as: administrative (eg, PCP changed medical facility or
left health plan), language or communication issues (eg, mem-
ber language preference), other member requests (eg, mem-
ber desired same PCP as family), or unknown. We calculated
the previously validated neighborhood deprivation index,20
a contextual measure of socioeconomic status, by linking each
patient’
s geocoded residential address to census tract level
socioeconomic indicators from the 2010 American Commu-
nity Survey.
Statistical Analysis
We used a difference-in-differences framework to study how
changes in patient-PCP language concordance impacted the
change in risk factors preswitch to postswitch. The difference-
in-differences method is a quasi-experimental approach that
measures the change in an outcome due to an intervention
and/or exposure (first difference), after subtracting the back-
ground change (second difference; eg, owing to secular trends
or discontinuity in care due to switching irrespective of lan-
guage concordance).21,22 Difference-in-differences rests on the
counterfactualassumption;namely,ifLEPLatinoswhoswitched
from discordant to concordant PCPs had instead switched to
otherdiscordantPCPs,weassumethatthechangesintheirclini-
cal measures would be similar to the changes observed in the
reference group (ie, LEP Latinos who did not change concor-
dance status). To adjust for case mix imbalances between ex-
posure and reference groups, we included patient characteris-
tics (ie, age, sex and socioeconomic status) as well as PCP
characteristics(ie,age,sex,andrace/ethnicity),andtheyearand
the reason for the PCP switch as fixed effects.
Our repeated measures data had a hierarchical structure.
Some patients switched PCPs more than once and all patients
were nested within PCPs (ie, multiple patients were empan-
eled with each PCP). We specified hierarchical linear mixed
models to estimate the net difference-in-differences effect.
Both patient and PCP were specified as random effects in ran-
dom intercept models to account for nonindependence of the
residual error and to correctly adjust the variance estimates.
We also conducted 3 sensitivity analyses. We modeled changes
in glycemic control after excluding 121 patients whose pre-
switch and postswitch measures were less than 90 days apart
since HbA1c measures average plasma glucose levels during the
prior 3 to 4 months. We also ran the models in the subset of
patients who switched PCPs due to administrative changes
only; this restricted the analysis to patients who were less vul-
nerable to self-selection bias because they did not initiate the
PCP switch on their own. In the third sensitivity analysis, we
required a “wash-out” period after the switch (ie, only using
postswitch measures that were at least 30 days after the first
in-person visit with the postswitch PCP), to ensure that the
postswitch measure was collected after the patient had estab-
lished a relationship with the new PCP.
Forunadjustedcomparisons,χ2statisticswereusedforcat-
egorical variables, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t tests
wereusedforcontinuousvariables.Thedifference-in-differences
models were run using mixed models; the significance of the
difference-in-differences parameter estimate was based on the
t distribution. The level of significance was set at .05.
Results
The cohort consisted of 1605 LEP Latinos. Before switching,
46%oftheLEPLatinoswereempaneledwithaconcordantPCP
and 54% with a discordant PCP; 59% of LEP Latinos with con-
cordant PCPs switched to another concordant PCP, while 48%
of LEP Latinos with discordant PCPs switched to a concor-
dant PCP. LEP Latinos with discordant PCPs who switched to
concordant PCPs were more likely to have changed due to lan-
guage or communication issues than patients who switched
to another discordant PCP (30% vs 9%, respectively). These 2
groups were similar in regards to demographics and baseline
risk factor control (Table 1). LEP Latinos with concordant PCPs
who switched to discordant PCPs had better rates of pre-
switch LDL and SBP control than patients who switched to an-
other concordant PCP. However, these 2 groups were mostly
similar in regards to demographics and there were no differ-
encesintheprevalenceofpreswitchglycemiccontrol.Spanish-
speaking PCPs were more likely to identify as Latino (51%) than
English-only PCPs (2%) but were similar in terms of sex (54%
female) and age (29% ≥ 45 years old).
Most groups experienced slight improvements in the
prevalence of glycemic control (HbA1c < 8%) and poor glyce-
mic control (HbA1c > 9%) in the year after switching PCPs
regardless of the change in language concordance (Figure 1).
However, the largest improvement was observed among LEP
Latinos who switched from discordant to concordant PCPs;
glycemic control increased 11% (from 63% to 74%) while poor
glycemic control decreased 7% (from 20% to 13%). In
adjusted difference-in-differences models, there was a 10%
(95% CI, 2% to 17%; P = .01) net increase in the prevalence of
good glycemic control and a −4% (95% CI, −10% to 2%;
P = .16) net decrease in the prevalence of poor control among

(Table 2). When modeled as a continuous outcome, the
change in mean HbA1c was −0.22 (95% CI, −0.45 to 0.01;
P = .06; data not shown). Among LEP patients who switched
from a concordant to a discordant PCP, there were no signifi-

adjusted difference-in-differences models, the prevalence of
LDL control (LDL < 100 mg/dL) increased by 9% (95% CI, 1%
to 17%; P = .03) among LEP patients switching from a discor-
dant to concordant PCP and by 15% (95% CI, 7% to 24%;
P < .001) among LEP patients switching from a concordant to
discordant PCP. Mean LDL decreased by 6.1 mg/dL (95% CI,
−11.4 to −0.8; P = .02) in the latter group but not the former.
We did not find evidence of significant differences in changes
in SBP control by concordance status.
There were qualitatively similar effect sizes in the subset
of patients who switched PCPs due to administrative
changes, but the estimates were not statistically significant:
11% (95% CI, 2% to 24%; P = .08), 8% (95% CI, −5% to 22%;
P = .24) and 11% (95% CI, −3% to 14%; P = .23) net increases
for glycemic, LDL and SBP control, respectively among LEP
Latinos switching from discordant to concordant PCPs; a
mean drop of 0.27% points (P = .17) in HbA1c was also
observed. Among LEP Latinos switching from concordant to
discordant PCPs, there was a 24% (95% CI, 12% to 35%;
P < .001) net increase in LDL control and nonsignificant
changes of 9% (95% CI, −1% to 18%; P = .07) and 11% (95% CI,
−2% to 24%; P = .11) in the prevalence of glycemic and sys-
tolic blood pressure control, respectively. The sensitivity
analyses that required a “wash-out” period after the switch
also generated qualitatively similar results as the main mod-
els, but the 9% increase in the prevalence of LDL control
among LEP patients who switched from discordant to con-
cordant PCPs was no longer significant (P = .08; data not

concordant (ie, bilingual, Spanish-speaking) PCPs experi-
enced a 10% increase in the prevalence of glycemic control
after accounting for changes observed among LEP patients
switchingfromonelanguage-discordantPCPtoanother.There
was no significant change in SBP control, and overall, we found
no deleterious effects on any of the 3 clinical outcomes fol-
lowing any PCP switch, including for those patients switch-
ingfromconcordanttodiscordantPCPs.Unexpectedly,wealso
observed an increase in the prevalence of good LDL control
among those switching from concordant to discordant PCPs.
To our knowledge, this is the first report to use a longitudi-
nal, quasi-experimental study design to examine the impact
of changes in language concordance on risk factor control
among LEP Latinos with diabetes.
We found clinically meaningful effects with respect to im-
provement in glycemic control. These findings are generally
consistent with those from a study of Latino youth with type
1 diabetes that found a 0.5 point decrease in mean HbA1c in the
year after joining a Spanish language clinic.23 We found a 0.22
point decrease in mean HbA1c following a switch to a language-
concordant PCP. Improvements in risk factor control after
switching to a language-concordant PCP were previously
documented in a small cohort of Russian immigrants with
diabetes.24Whilenotarandomizedclinicaltrial,ourdifference-
in-differencesstudydesignhasstrongcausalvalidity.Ashealth
plans and regulatory agencies strive to improve population
health and reduce disparities, it is noteworthy that a 10% im-
provement in prevalence of HbA1c less than 8% among lan-
guage-discordant LEP Latinos was achieved by simply switch-
ing PCPs and without the creation of costly new programs; in
short,itsuggestsapracticalstrategyforimprovingHEDISmea-
sures for glycemic control in settings with relatively large num-
bers of Spanish-speaking PCPs.25
There are a few possible explanations for our findings. La-
tino patients with concordant PCPs were previously shown to
be twice as likely to receive counseling about diet and exer-
cise as Latino patients with discordant PCPs.26 LEP patients
switching to concordant PCPs may find it easier to discuss diet
and exercise recommendations or complex treatments com-
pared with using interpreters. Patients with concordant PCPs
might communicate using secure messaging in their pre-
ferred language, thus facilitating dialogue between office vis-
its. Language concordance might be a proxy for a mutual cul-
tural affinity, facilitating rapport, and communication.27
Finally, patients often resist initiating insulin when recom-
mended, and better communication with Spanish-speaking
PCPs might ease the concerns of LEP patients.28
Similar to LEP patients who changed from discordant to
concordant PCPs, those who changed from concordant to dis-
cordant PCPs experienced improvements in LDL control. The
effect sizes in both groups were of the same order of magni-
tude with overlapping 95% CIs. While the results in the dis-
cordant to concordant group support our hypothesis that im-
proved communication leads to better clinical outcomes, it is
difficult to apply this logic to the concordant to discordant
group. Rather, we suspect that some other closely linked but
unmeasured aspect of care improved (eg, patient satisfaction
ortrustinPCP)despiteswitchingtoalanguage-discordantPCP.
The KPNC health plan, a setting with uniform access to pro-
fessional translation services and electronic medical records
thatintegratepharmacy,laboratory,specialtyandprimarycare
services, provides good continuity of care following a PCP
switch; even among Spanish-speaking LEP patients switch-
ing to discordant PCPs.
Our quasi-experimental, differences-in-differences study
design provides stronger evidence of causality than previous
cross-sectional studies and minimizes potential confounding
from measured and unmeasured risk factors because it uses
each individual as his or her own control. We ran sensitivity
analyses among patients whose PCP switch was initiated ad-
ministratively.Thisrestrictedtheanalysistopatientswhowere
less vulnerable to self-selection bias because they did not ini-
tiate the PCP switch on their own, resembling a natural ex-
periment. In this sensitivity analysis, we found qualitatively
similar effect sizes. Some of the estimates were no longer sta-
tistically significant due to the reduced sample size and loss
of power. These consistent findings assuage concerns about
observational self-selection bias.

Limitations
Some limitations should be mentioned. These results may
underestimate the effect of language barriers in populations
with fewer bilingual PCPs or less comprehensive interpreter
services. While professional interpreter services were avail-
able at all KPNC facilities, we cannot verify the extent of their
use. Underuse has been documented in other settings with
uniform availability of such services.29-31 We could not deter-
mine Spanish language proficiency for 30% of KPNC PCPs;
these PCPs and their patient panels were excluded from the
study. Although excluded PCPs were more likely to be non-
Hispanic, and excluded patients were more likely female,
excluded and included patients were similar with respect to
age, neighborhood level socioeconomic status, baseline risk
factor control and pre-post changes in glycemic control, LDL
levels, and SBP. Thus, we believe that the exclusions intro-
duced no systematic bias. We could not verify that LEP
patients with concordant PCPs were communicating with
their PCPs in Spanish. Latinos preferring to speak Spanish but
proficient in English may have been misclassified as LEP. We
compared our administrative measure with self-report of LEP
on the DISTANCE survey6,12,32 and estimated this misclassifi-
cation rate to be about 20%. However, this misclassification
is likely nondifferential with respect to the direction of
switch and PCP concordance, thus biasing the findings
toward the null and making the estimates conservative. Lack-
ing an objective measure of PCP fluency in Spanish, we relied
on PCP self-report or utilization data recording bilingual care
delivery, and misclassification is possible. The majority of the
literature concurs that self-report at the high end of the scale
is an acceptable proxy in the absence of formal testing,15,17,33
and therefore we only categorized PCPs who self-reported
“high” fluency as Spanish speaking. There are limitations to
using utilization data to categorize PCP Spanish fluency as
these do not directly measure proficiency level. However, the
utilization data clearly state that the PCP is bilingual, and
these data are used for HEDIS reporting purposes. The high
sensitivity (93%) and specificity (91%) of this measure pro-
vide reassurance that misclassification is minimal. Moreover,
misclassifying PCPs would likely bias our results toward the
null.
Conclusions
We found improvements in the prevalence of glycemic con-
trolamongLEPLatinoswithdiabeteswhoswitchedfromalan-
guage-discordant PCP to a language-concordant PCP after ac-
counting for expected background changes. There was no
evidence of harm after switching from concordant to discor-
dant PCPs, and in the case of LDL control, these switches also
resulted in improvement. There are several compelling non-
clinical reasons for providing language-concordant care when
possible, including increased patient satisfaction and facili-
tating communication. Our study suggests that health sys-
tems caring for LEP Latinos with diabetes may also improve
glycemiccontrolbyfacilitatinglanguage-concordantcare,even
if it means switching PCPs.
