 adopted as an alternative to smoking combusted products, primarily cigarettes. Considerable 
controversy has accompanied their marketing and use. We propose a framework that describes and 
incorporates patterns of VNP and combustible cigarette use in determining the total amount of 
toxic exposure effects on population health. We begin by considering toxicity and the outcomes 
relevant to population health. We then present the framework and define different measures of 
VNP use, namely, trial and long-term use for exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive VNP and dual 
(cigarette and VNP) use. Using a systems thinking framework and decision theory we considered 
potential pathways for current, former and never users of VNPs. We then consider the evidence to-
date and the likely impacts of VNP use on public health, the potential effects of different policy 
approaches, and the possible influence of the tobacco industry on VNP and cigarette use.
INTRODUCTION
In the United States, smoking rates have fallen by 50% since their peak in the 1960’s as a 
result of tobacco control policies (1), but smoking still contributes to high rates of premature 
mortality. The 2014 Surgeon General’s Report stated, “the burden of death and disease from 
tobacco in the U.S. is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco 
products; rapid elimination of their use will dramatically reduce this burden.”
While all are agreed that efforts to discourage combustible tobacco products, especially 
cigarettes should continue, there is more controversy about the marketing of new vaporized 
nicotine products (VNPs), especially e-cigarettes, because of disagreements about whether 
they will complement or undermine successful tobacco control efforts (2, 3). VNP use has 
increased markedly in many high income countries (4–7) as a result of increased marketing 
(8, 9), the use of VNPs for smoking cessation (10), and policies that have made cigarettes 
less affordable (11). In the U.S., increasing e-cigarette use (5, 6) has been accompanied by 
an unusually large reduction in adult (12) and youth (6, 13) smoking prevalence.
Although the types of available VNPs vary and are rapidly evolving (14, 15), these products 
expose users to substantially lower levels of toxicants than combustible cigarettes (16–18). 
Consequently, VNPs could reduce harm to never smokers who would have otherwise 
initiated long-term cigarette use, and reduce harm to current smokers by helping them to 
quit, to switch to exclusive VNP use, or to substantially reduce their smoking. If, however, 
VNP use encourages the long-term use of cigarettes, or VNPs are used by those who would 
not have otherwise smoked, the net societal benefit would be diminished and VNPs could 
incur population level harm.
Despite growing evidence of the possible benefits of VNPs, 55 of 123 countries surveyed 
(19) have bans or laws that prohibit or restrict the sale of VNPs and 71 have laws that 
regulate the minimum purchase age, marketing, or taxation of VNPs. In April 2014, the U.S. 
FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products proposed deeming regulations that would assert their 
jurisdiction over e-cigarettes (20). Before imposing these regulations, the FDA must 
consider scientific evidence on the likely benefit and harm to individuals and the population 
as a whole.

 This paper proposes a systems level model (21) of the possible harm-increasing and harm-
reducing effects that is used to estimate the potential net effects of VNPs on population 
health. This framework employs decision theory to consider potential pathways of cigarette 
and VNP product use by current, former, and never smokers. We begin by considering the 
toxicity of VPN. We then present the framework and consider different measures of use, 
distinguishing trial from different forms of long-term use. Finally, we consider the available 
evidence and likely impacts on public health, the potential effects of different policies, and 
the possible influence of the tobacco industry on VNP and cigarette use. We focus on the 
US, where VNPs are now largely unregulated.
MORTALITY RISKS OF EXCLUSIVE AND DUAL VNP USE
A multi-criteria decision analysis (22) estimated that exclusive VNP use is associated with 
5% of the mortality risks of smoking. This is comparable to the estimated risks of low-
nitrosamine smokeless tobacco (23). In the absence of long term experience, the precise 
percentage of reduced harm may be difficult to quantify but studies using major biomarkers 
of cancer and other chemicals in e-cigarettes indicate substantially lower (e.g. 9–450 times) 
levels compared to cigarette smoke (16–18).
For dual users, VNP use may translate to a lower quantity and duration of cigarettes smoked. 
Both may decrease lung cancer and COPD risk (24, 25), with the amount depending on the 
proportion of total harm exposure obtained from each source. Studies find considerable 
variation in VNP use and quantity of cigarettes smoked (26), including ≥ 50% reduction in 
consumption. The potential to reduce risk is likely to depend on the age of initial dual use. 
Although much use now begins at later ages, VNP use is likely to occur at earlier ages in 
more recent cohorts of smokers, and thereby provide a greater reduction in cigarette use and 
toxic exposures over longer periods of use. In addition, initiating VNP use before cigarette 
smoking may delay or prevent smoking initiation and thereby reduce smoking risks.
FRAMEWORK AND MEASURES OF USE
The use of tobacco products over a prolonged period is necessary to detect reductions in life 
expectancy (25, 27). This is also likely to apply to the use VNPs. We consider short-term 
(“trial”) use, which may determine transitions to long-term (“prolonged”) use and may help 
gauge the immediate effects of public policies. Possible transitions are shown for never, 
current and former smokers in Figures 1–3. Harm-reducing effects are indicated by a “+” 
and harm-increasing effects by a “−.” A “?” indicates that the amount of change depends on 
the pattern of use. In each case, the impact on population health will depend on how VNP 
use influences the long-term prevalence of: exclusive cigarette smoking, exclusive VNP use, 
dual use, and abstinence compared to the counterfactual scenario in the absence of VNPs.
Studies on e-cigarettes to date have mostly measured “ever-use” or “past 30-day use”(28), 
with the ratio of current to ever use averaging 30% across 27 European countries (29) in 
2012 and 30% among US college students (30) and adults (31). While current use is often 
described by past-30 day use, evidence suggests that much reported use is infrequent (31) 
and so unlikely to lead to substantial harm to health. Harm is determined by how many users

 transition to more frequent use of cigarettes or VNPs. More established use can be assessed 
by inquiring about the number of days used in the last month (29, 32), daily use (33) and 
number of times used (34–36).
Accurate measures of long-term exclusive and dual use require sufficient time to transition 
from smoking, possibly through dual use, to final use states (e.g., abstinence from either 
cigarettes or from VPNs or both) (37). For example, recent former cigarette smokers (quit ≤ 
1 year) were twice as likely as longer-term former smokers (quit 2–3 years) and four times 
as likely as current cigarette smokers (31) to be daily VNP users. In addition, transitions 
may differ by cohort depending on perceived risk, ability to satisfy cravings or withdrawal 
symptoms, differences between early and late adopters, socio-economic status and current 
tobacco control policies (38, 39).
TRANSITIONS FROM NEVER SMOKER
As shown in Figure 1, a never smoker may transition from trying VNP to exclusive VNP 
use, exclusive cigarette use, dual use, or quit using cigarettes and VNPs. The population 
health impact depends critically on whether the never smoker who tries VNPs would have 
smoked cigarettes in the absence of VNPs. Health impacts are harm-increasing when VNPs 
lead to someone who would otherwise never smoke to initiate cigarette smoking. VNP and 
dual use and are harm-reducing when those who would otherwise smoke cigarettes transition 
to no use, substantially reduce their cigarette use, or exclusively use VNPs.
Studies indicate that adolescents and young adult VNP users are far more likely to have 
already smoked cigarettes than to have never smoked (40). A 2014 Great Britain survey 
(ages 11–18) found past month use at 0.2% among never smokers and 13.5% among 
smokers. Only 8.2% of those who ever used a VNP smoked a cigarette for the first time after 
using VNPs compared to 69.8% who smoked a cigarette before trying a VNP (41). Studies 
of youth and young adults use from the US (42–44) and other countries (45–48) using 
different use measures have found current smokers at least 15 times more likely to use VNPs 
than never smokers.
Only a few studies have considered more established VNP use (49, 50). Of 13.4% of high 
school students reporting any past 30-day VNP use, 74% had tried VNPs on 1 to 9 days, 
while ≥20 days use was reported by only 15.5% of users who comprised 2% of the 
population (49). Among college students, cigarette smokers were more likely to continue 
VNP use (8.0%) than non-smokers (0.4%), and more non-smokers who tried VNPs were 
non users at follow-up (96.8%) than smokers (68.1%) (50).
Adolescents and young adult who use VNPs are most likely to be those at higher risk of 
initiating cigarette smoking (51, 52). Young VNP experimenters are more likely to engage in 
other risky behaviors (30, 53, 54) and have executive function deficits (55, 56) like those 
found in cigarette smokers (56, 57). These findings suggest a common liability model is 
more plausible than a gateway from VNP use to cigarette smoking (58, 59). In testing the 
role of common liability and gateway effects of VNP use, statistical techniques are required 
to adequately control for the factors that determine initial VNP use and the transition from

 experimental to regular use, i.e., those that correct for confounding and selection bias (60, 
61).
TRANSITIONS FROM CURRENT CIGARETTE SMOKING
Figure 2 shows that the public health impact on VNP use on cigarette smokers will depend 
on how VNP use affects the likelihood of quit success, i.e., how many smokers would quit in 
their absence. The effect of VNPs on cessation is likely to depend on their desirability and 
the ability to deliver nicotine at a sufficient dose to reduce craving or withdrawal symptoms 
from cigarettes (4, 62). Both may vary with product type and preparedness of smokers to use 
them for prolonged periods. Several studies have reported higher smoking cessation rates 
among users of VNP tank systems (62). Other studies indicate that more regular use (e.g., 
daily) of VNPs is correlated with being an ex-smoker (31, 33, 34), increased numbers of quit 
attempts and greater reductions in number of cigarettes smoked (63).
Two randomized controlled trials have found that VNPs can help some smokers to quit or 
reduce their cigarette consumption (64, 65). Rates of smoking cessation in the VNP groups 
were similar to those seen in clinical trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (66). In 
uncontrolled prospective studies, one with carbon monoxide (CO) testing found a similar 
success rate (67) while four others found higher rates of smoking abstinence (68–71). One 
review (72) that reported lower cessation rates among VNP users included studies that were 
not prospective, defined ever-use or past 30 day use as sufficient exposure to VNPs to 
impact abstinence, and suffered from other methodological weaknesses (e.g., selection bias). 
A more recent review (73) concluded, “Smokers who have tried other methods of quitting 
without success could be encouraged to try e-cigarettes to stop smoking…There is evidence 
that EC can encourage quitting or cigarette consumption reduction.”
Because VNPs are more widely available and often more appealing to smokers than 
conventional NRT (10), they have the potential for having a larger impact on the rate of 
smoking cessation in the population (2, 74). However, evidence suggests that VNPs are not 
especially attractive to longer-term ex-smokers; only 0.8% of long-term former smokers who 
had quit for more than four years used VNPs compared to 13% of recent quitters (31).
Ultimately, the ability to identify the public health impact of VNP use will depend on 
measurement of factors that predict willingness to try VNPs and transitions to long-term 
VNP use by different groups (i.e., current smokers, ex-smokers, never smokers). For 
example, quit success may depend on intent (e.g., whether it is used to quit) and on whether 
smokers who use VNPs are more addicted or have a history of unsuccessful use of other 
cessation techniques (10, 62, 75, 76). Studies (29, 76, 77) find that current VNP use is 
associated with past quit attempts. One study found that the relationship between VNP use 
and cigarette smoking cessation depended upon the ability to statistically control for factors 
related to success of past quit attempts and intention to quit (75).
TRANSITIONS FROM FORMER SMOKER
Figure 3 shows that VNP use may increase harm for former smokers who would not have 
otherwise relapsed if after trying VNPs they relapse to exclusive or dual cigarette use. It will

 reduce harm in former smokers who use VNPs to prevent a relapse to cigarette smoking. 
Beneficial effects of VNP use are suggested by a longitudinal observational study (78) that 
found 6% of former smokers who used VNP daily at baseline relapsed to cigarette smoking 
at one month and 6% at one year. Eight percent of recent quitters relapsed to occasional 
smoking at one month and 5% at one year but none relapsed to daily smoking. These rates 
compare favorably to typical relapse rates for smoking after cessation using other methods 
(79). However, we do not yet have enough evidence on the effects of VNP use on relapse, 
because of their limited use by former smokers who did not use VNPs before quitting (80, 
81).
THE ROLE OF POLICY: INTENDED AND UNINTENDED EFFECTS
Any assessment of the effect of policies towards VNPs depends on understanding that 
cigarettes and VNPs are potentially substitutable goods (82–84). Liberal regulation of VNPs 
may mean that transitions to VNPs result in more long term VNP use rather than their short 
term use as cessation aids. On the other hand, restrictive policies towards VNPs may mean 
that cigarette smokers are less likely to switch to VNPs. A recent study (84), for example, 
found that states with minimum VNP purchase age laws had lower rates of VNP uptake and 
more cigarette uptake than states without such restrictions.
Stronger cigarette control policies (e.g., bans on menthol and other flavors to reduce their 
appeal, toxicity or addictiveness) may encourage cessation by those smokers who are more 
likely to quit. As many as 40% of smokers make a quit attempt each year in most high 
income nations but only 3%–5% remain abstinent for 6-months or longer (85, 86), indicating 
that many smokers who try to quit soon relapse to smoking. Studies (32, 76) indicate that 
most smokers use VNPs with the intention of quitting smoking cigarettes. While stronger 
cigarette policies may initially lead to dual use, they may also lead to complete cessation of 
cigarettes if the policies are sufficiently strong.
The effect of policies towards VNPs will depend on how they affect dual versus exclusive 
use. Product regulations that limit toxicity may increase VNP use as a substitute for 
smoking, especially if that information is publicized, and thereby substantially reduce risk 
per unit exposure. However, if regulations discourage VNP innovations that make VNPs 
more attractive to smokers, they reduce cessation among smokers who would use better 
VNPs. Outright bans on VNP sales may be more likely to discourage cessation than reduce 
VNP use, as indicated by their use in countries where VNP sales are prohibited (87, 88). 
Bans may not stop some young people from taking up vaping, as experience with cannabis 
use shows.
Concerns have been raised that cigarette smoking will be re-normalized by VNP use (89, 
90). This issue can be addressed by the media and public health campaigns that encourage 
norms that are hostile to cigarette smoking and at the same time distinguishing clearly 
between VNP and cigarette risks, discourage dual use and encourage exclusive VNP use. 
Indeed, the availability of VNPs may provide a justification for stronger policies to 
discourage cigarette smoking because smokers, particularly those of lower socio-economic

 status and with mental health issues, are given a less risky and potentially less costly 
alternative way to service their need for nicotine.
THE ROLE OF THE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO AND VAPING INDUSTRIES
In coordinating tobacco and VNP control strategies, we need to gauge how they will 
influence the 4-Ps of tobacco marketing: Product, Price, Promotion and Place (91, 92).
The VNP industry is made up of many different manufacturers, most of whom are not 
affiliated with cigarette companies. By contrast the cigarette, cigar, and smokeless tobacco 
industries are largely consolidated and controlled by a few large multinational cigarette 
companies. With the rapid growth of the VNP market (93), major cigarette makers such as 
such as Phillip Morris (MarkTen, IQOS, Marlboro Heat Stick), Imperial (Blu), Reynolds 
American (Vuse, Revo), and BAT (Vype) have introduced VNP products. However, cigarette 
companies do not control VNPs like they do the rest of the tobacco business; many 
manufacturers of e-cigarettes like NJOY do not sell cigarettes and there are thousands of 
vape shops that are independent of the cigarette industry. The diversity of the VNP business 
influences the distribution channels and the cost differential between VNP and conventional 
tobacco products.
Cigarette companies that have entered the smokeless tobacco market (94, 95) have 
encouraged dual rather than exclusive use and are likely to do the same with VNPs. By 
contrast VNP companies that are unaffiliated with cigarette manufacturers want smokers to 
switch completely from cigarettes to VNPs. Product content regulations that create 
regulatory hurdles that only large firms can get over are likely to favor the cigarette industry 
and discourage innovation by firms outside the cigarette industry. For example, a regulation 
restricting VNP tank devices will favor firms selling the “cigalike” VNPs sold by cigarette 
companies (71) that are less attractive to smokers (63).
Increasing VNP prices by taxing them the same way as cigarettes will discourage youth 
VNP use, but also discourage use by smokers of lower socioeconomic status who are trying 
to switch or quit. However, if VNP taxes are accompanied by even higher cigarette taxes, 
youth VNP use may be reduced and initiation into smoking discouraged, while switching 
and cessation among current smokers would be encouraged (96). In the case of marketing 
restrictions, retailer point-of-sale restrictions, which limit subsidies by cigarette 
manufacturers to provide shelf space and price promotions, can reduce price discounting and 
discourage advertisement displays (97). This could provide greater shelf space for VNP 
products to be sold by independent firms.
FINAL COMMENTS
From a public health perspective, VNP policies should aim to discourage experimental and 
regular use of VNPs by never smokers who would not have otherwise smoked while 
encouraging innovations in VNP products that promote smoking cessation. The evidence 
suggests a strong potential for VNP use to improve population health by reducing or 
displacing cigarette use in countries where cigarette prevalence is high and smokers are 
interested in quitting. Rising VNP use is a global phenomenon in low- and middle-income

 countries as well as in high-income countries (87). Yet evidence is lacking on their impact in 
countries where cigarette smoking prevalence is low (e.g., Sub-Saharan African countries) or 
where interest in quitting among smokers may be low (e.g., China).
The primary aim of tobacco control policy should therefore be to discourage cigarette use 
while providing the means for smokers to more easily quit smoking, even if that means 
switching for some time to VNPs rather than quitting all nicotine use. Countries whose 
policies discourage VNP use run the risk of neutralizing a potentially useful addition to 
methods of reducing tobacco use. We must collect better information on VNP use and its 
consequences to better assess this potential. Although large cross-sectional surveys can be 
used to estimate transition probabilities (98), we need longitudinal data, such as the large-
scale longitudinal US Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) survey and the 
International Tobacco Control surveys (87), to more directly track transitions to and from 
VNP use. As we gain better knowledge of the effects of cigarette-oriented and VNP-oriented 
policies, a long-term view that reduces the use of the most toxic combusted tobacco nicotine 
delivery products will become a more realistic goal.
Our framework identifies the critical information required, but this information will need to 
be continually updated. VNPs will change over time, and the extent of product innovation 
will depend on industry structure and how tobacco control policies are applied to cigarettes 
and VNPs. As the product and population of users change, the characteristics of 
experimenters and long-term VNP users, their transitions to exclusive and dual cigarette and 
VNP use and associated health risks may change. While there is more uncertainty about the 
health risks of exclusive and dual VNP use than of cigarette use, the substantially lower 
levels of toxins than cigarettes make VNPs far less harmful, although by exactly how much 
is unclear. If the harms of VNP use are substantially more than indicated by current 
evidence, then policies will be needed to discourage long term VNPs use.
Clearly, we need better measures of longer-term and longitudinal patterns of VNP use, 
product toxicity and addictive potential, and appropriate methods to study critical transitions 
in patterns of VNP and cigarette use. With multiple potential interactions between VNP and 
cigarette use and the differential effects of policies on these use rates, modeling provides a 
“virtual population laboratory” to synthesize existing evidence, to project the likely impacts 
without regulatory action, and to compare the impact of different possible interventions (99–
102). However, until better data are available, our ability to understand the impact of VNP 
use will be need to be based on careful and prudent extrapolations of their likely benefits and 
harms from shorter term evidence.
