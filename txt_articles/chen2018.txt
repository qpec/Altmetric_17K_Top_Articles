Abstract 
Background: We have previously shown that vitamin D supplementation increases 
telomerase activity, suggesting an anti-aging effect. In this study, we aim to test the 
hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation would slow down epigenetic aging, a new 
marker of biological aging. 
Methods: A randomized clinical trial was previously conducted among 70 
overweight/obese African-Americans with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
[25(OH)D]<50 nmol/L, who were randomly assigned into four groups of 600 IU/day, 
2000 IU/day, 4000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplements or placebo followed by 16-
weeks interventions. Whole genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted 
in 51 participants. DNA methylation ages were calculated according to the Horvath 
and the Hannum methods. Methylation-based age acceleration index (∆Age) is 
defined as the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age in 
years. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the treatment effects. 
Results: Fifty-one participants (aged 26.1 ± 9.3 years, 16% are male) were included 
in the study. After the adjustment of multi-covariates, vitamin D3 supplementation of 
4000 IU/day was associated with 1.85 years decrease in Horvath epigenetic aging 
compared with placebo (p-value=0.046), and 2000 IU/day was associated with 1.90 
years decrease in Hannum epigenetic aging (p-value=0.044). Serum 25(OH)D 
concentrations were significantly associated with decreased Horvath ∆Age only (p-
values = 0.002), regardless of treatments. 
Conclusions: Our results suggest that vitamin D supplementation may slow down 
Horvath epigenetic aging. But the effect on Hannum epigenetic aging is not

Introduction 
In recent years, the concept of epigenetic aging has emerged. In 2013, Horvath's 
epigenetic clock was developed by Horvath et al. which predicts DNA methylation 
(DNAm) age based on 353 CpG sites 1. In the same year, Hannum et al. also 
formulated a quantitative model of aging based on the methylation levels of 71 CpG 
sites 2. Since then, epigenetic aging has been associated with several aging diseases, 
such as obesity 3,4, Down syndrome 5, Huntington’s disease 6, Werner syndrome 7 and 
schizophrenia in observational studies 8. Whether epigenetic clock is sensitive to 
changes in response to a geroprotective intervention remains unknown. 
DNAm age measures the cumulative effect of the epigenetic maintenance 
system. The difference between DNAm age and chronological age has been defined 
as an index of disproportionate aging. Although it is not yet fully understood what 
exactly is measured by DNAm age, its relation to individual health and longevity has 
been observed in several studies. DNAm age acceleration is found to be related to 
increased incidence of frailty, dementia, cancer and mortality 9-13.  
Some factors are suggested to influence epigenetic aging. Epigenetic age 
accelerators were found in observational studies, which include obesity 4,14, virus 
infection 15, stress 16,17 and exposure to violence 18. Fish intake 14 and exercise 14 may 
slow down epigenetic aging. Beneficial effects of vitamin D have been widely studied 
for decades, including improving bone 19 and cardiovascular health 20-22, reducing the 
risk of diabetes 23,24, autoimmune disease 25-27, cancer 28, and even overall mortality 29. 
Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation may be one of the underlying 
mechanisms. We have previously conducted a series of epigenome-wide association 
studies in youth and young adults, and have shown that vitamin D deficiency is

associated with global DNA hypomethylation 30 and locus-specific leukocyte DNA 
methylation changes 31. In addition, we found that 16 weeks of vitamin D3 
supplementation increased global methylation level in a dose-dependent manner 30. 
Furthermore, we demonstrated that 16 weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation increases 
telomerase activity, suggesting an anti-aging property 32. 
Therefore, in this study we tested the hypothesis that vitamin D 
supplementation would slow down epigenetic aging by taking advantage of a 
previously completed randomized clinical trial (RCT) among overweight/obese 
African-Americans with suboptimal vitamin D status [25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L].  
Materials and Methods 
Participants 
As previously described 33, 70 overweight/obese African-Americans residing 
in Augusta, Georgia and surrounding areas were randomized into a double-blinded 
and placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT01583621) during December 2011 and 
November 2012. Inclusion criteria were self-reported African-American race, aged 
between 13-45 years, overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m² for adults and ≥85th 
percentile for age and sex otherwise), no pregnancy, no known acute or chronic 
illnesses, no use of any prescription medications, birth control pills, herbal, multi-
vitamin or mineral supplementations, and suboptimal vitamin D status [serum 
25(OH)D concentrations of ≤50 nmol/L]. A total of six participants were lost during 
the follow-up. The genome-wide DNA methylation was performed in 64 subjects with 
DNA available samples. Fifty-one participants (aged 26.1 ± 9.3 years, 16% are male) 
with 99 observations were finally included in this study with completed data of both 
DNA methylation data and laboratory measurements, among which 48 participants

had both baseline and posttest data and were included in the pre-post paired tests, 
while another 3 participants only had baseline data or posttest data. In accordance 
with the intention to treat principle, all 99 observations were included in the mixed-
effects models 34. Informed consents were obtained from the adults and the guardians 
of adolescents. The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the 
Augusta University. 
Randomization and treatments 
The participants were randomly assigned to any one of the four groups 18,000 
IU/month (~600 IU/day), 60,000 IU/month (~2000 IU/day), 120,000 IU/month 
(~4000 IU/day) of vitamin D3 or placebo, and the interventional capsules were 
provided to the participants by supervised dosing for 16-weeks to maximize 
compliance. The vitamin D3 and placebo capsules were provided by the Bio-Tech 
Pharmacal, Fayetteville, AR, and the AU clinical research pharmacy generated the 
randomization codes and dispensed the study capsules. The AU clinical pharmacy 
maintained the randomization codes until the end of the study and did not have any 
direct role in the data collection 33.  
Measurements and laboratory assessments 
Height and weight were obtained according to standard procedures and BMI 
was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2). Fasting blood samples were 
obtained at baseline and 16-week, which were frozen and stored at −80 °C until 
assayed. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured using enzyme immunoassay 
(Immunodiagnostic Systems, Fountain Hills, AZ). The intra- and inter-assay 
coefficients of variation (CV) were 5.6 and 6.6 %, respectively. Our laboratory is 
certified by the vitamin D3 external quality assessment scheme (DEQAS), an

international program monitoring accuracy of 25(OH)D measurements. Peripheral 
blood was collected and sent to the clinical pathology core lab at the Medical College 
of Georgia within 2 hours for the complete blood count with differential, which 
included the total leukocyte count and percentages of peripheral blood cell types 
including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Immune 
phenotype (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) was performed using flow cytometry. 
Genome-wide DNA methylation and DNAm age calculation 
DNA was extracted from stored buffy coat samples using the QIAamp DNA 
Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were 
analyzed by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850K Beadchip (Illumina Inc., 
Denver, CO). In the quality control stage, DNA methylation data was processed using 
the Minfi package 35. Detectable probes were defined as the probes with detection p-
value < 1E-16 in more than 95% samples; detectable samples were those with 
detection p-value < 1E-16 in more than 95% CpG sites.  
Horvath DNAm age is defined as a prediction of age based on the DNA 
methylation levels of 353 CpG sites using the statistical pipeline developed by 
Horvath where background-corrected β values were pre-processed using the 
calculator’s internal normalization method 1. Hannum DNAm age is calculated based 
on 71 CpG sites using the prediction function developed by Hannum and colleagues 2. 
Beta values were normalized via the beta-mixture quantile normalization method 36. 
Methylation-based age acceleration index (∆Age) is defined as the difference 
between DNA methylation age and chronological age in years (∆Age = DNAm age – 
chronological age). Therefore, a negative ∆Age suggests that an individual is 
biologically younger than the chronological age, while a positive ∆Age means

accelerated aging. DNA methylation data processing and DNAm age calculation were 
accomplished using R version 3.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing Vienna, 
Austria). 
Statistical analysis 
The general characteristics of the subjects are presented as mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) for continuous variables and N (%) for categorical variables. Normality of each 
continuous variable was tested based on a combination test statistics of skewness and 
kurtosis. Baseline group differences were determined by analysis-of-variance 
(ANOVA) for normally distributed variables or by Kruskal-Wallis test, otherwise. 
Group differences in proportions at baseline were tested by Fisher’s exact test. To test 
for changes of continues measurements from baseline to posttest, two-tailed paired t-
test was conducted for variables with normal distribution. Wilcoxon matched-pairs 
signed-ranks test was used instead to test for non-normal distributed variables. 
Mixed-effects regression models for repeated measures were used in an 
intention-to-treat analysis using all available data. Models for epigenetic aging 
included the fixed effects of intervention groups (placebo, 600 IU/day, 2000 IU/day, 
or 4000 IU/day), measurement time (baseline or posttest) and their interaction. 
Participant nested within group was considered a random effect. Previous studies have 
shown that male 37, obesity 3 and immune function 38 may be associated with the 
aging process. In addition, a strong negative association between CD4 cells and 
Hannum aging predictor has been observed in previous studies 9. Therefore, the 
models were also adjusted for gender, BMI and CD4 percent. As shown in this study 
as well as other studies 39, since vitamin D may also affect the immune function, so to 
estimate the total effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on epigenetic aging, only the

baseline level of CD4 percent was included. Month of visit was also included in the 
model to account for the seasonal effect. Baseline 25(OH)D concentration was also 
included in the regression model. Khoury et al. observed that a decrease in slope of 
the predicted epigenetic age by Horvath clock took place at approximately 60 years, 
indicating that some loci in the model may change differently with age and that age 
acceleration measures will themselves be age-dependent. Thus age was further 
included in the regression model 40. 
We also tested the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and DNAm age. 
Mixed-effects models were carried out using natural log transformed 25(OH)D 
concentration as the independent variable, and adjusted for sex, BMI and CD4 
percent.  
As we assume that the causal effects of the vitamin D3 supplementations are 
mediated by increasing the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, we further tested the 
effects using the contamination adjusted intention to treat (CA ITT) technique 41. 
Instrumental variable (IV) regression analysis was carried out, which took serum 
concentration of 25(OH)D as endogenous variable, and intervention groups as IVs 
estimated by limited-information maximum likelihood (LIML). All statistical analysis 
was performed using Stata version 12.0 (College Station, Texas 77845 USA).

chronological age (Horvath DNAm age r=0.90, p-value < 0.001, Hannum DNAm age 
r=0.82, p-value < 0.001) as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The correlations were 
higher in the baseline (Horvath r=0.92, p-value < 0.001, Hannum DNAm age r=0.82, 
p-value < 0.001) than those at posttest (Horvath r=0.88, p-value < 0.001, Hannum 
DNAm age r=0.81, p-value < 0.001) in both DNAm ages. There was no difference in 
age, DNAm ages, Horvath ∆Age, gender, BMI, 25(OH)D, CD4 percent and CD4 
count among the four groups at baseline (p-values > 0.05). However, Hannum ∆Age 
was significantly different among the four groups ranging from -0.7 years in placebo 
group to 5.6 years in 2000 IU/day group (p-value=0.012). 
Changes in epigenetic aging and serum 25(OH)D from pre to post vitamin D3 
supplementation 
In Table 2, we compared the changes in ∆Age and 25(OH)D concentration before and 
after treatment. Average serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly raised by 
22.10, 47.01 and 47.20 nmol/L in 600 IU/day, 2000 IU/day and 4000 IU/day groups 
(p-values < 0.001) as we previously reported 42. Horvath ∆Age was decreased by 1.83 
years (p-value = 0.002) and 1.62 years (p-value = 0.031) in 2000 IU/day and 4000 
IU/day groups after the treatment, respectively. Changes in Hannum ∆Age were not 
significant (p-values>0.05). 
Effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on epigenetic aging 
In Table 3, model 1 reassigned participants into two groups (assignment 1), which 
were group 1 including placebo and 600 IU/day, and group 2 including 2000 IU/day 
and 4000 IU/day. Assignment 2 in model 2 was the original assignment of this study, 
which split the participants into four groups. Effect 1 derived from model 1 was the 
interaction term of wave and assignment 1, the coefficient of which represented the

treatment effect of group 2 compared with group 1. Effect 2 derived from model 2 
was the interaction of wave and assignment 2, which reflected dose-response of 
vitamin D3 supplementation on epigenetic aging. Model 1 and model 2 were both 
adjusted for sex, BMI, group assignment, measure time, month of visit, baseline 
25(OH)D concentration and CD4 percent. In model 1, treatment was associated with 
1.49 years (p-value = 0.023) decrease in Horvath ∆Age, not with Hannum ∆Age. In 
model 2, vitamin D3 supplementation was also associated with decreased ∆Age in 
both epigenetic clocks, but only significant with Horvath ∆Age in 4000 IU/day group 
(p-value = 0.046), and Hannum ∆Age in 2000 IU/day group (p-value = 0.044). We 
further adjusted for chronological age in the models, and the effects of vitamin D3 
supplementation on epigenetic aging remained unchanged. A set of regressions were 
also performed to investigate the interaction of age by including the interaction terms 
of chronological age and treatment, which were not significant.
Association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and epigenetic aging  
In Table 4, regardless of treatment, the increase in serum 25(OH)D concentrations 
were only significantly associated with decreased Horvath ∆Age (p-values = 0.002), 
and the association remained significant after the adjustment of gender, BMI and CD4 
percent (p-values = 0.002). There was no association between Hannum clock and 
changes in serum 25(OH)D concentrations.  
Dose-effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the Horvath epigenetic aging 
mediated by the changes of serum 25(OH)D concentration  
To test whether serum 25(OH)D mediated the dose-response of vitamin D3 
supplementation on epigenetic aging, we conducted the IV regression analysis using

the Horvath clock since that only the Horvath clock was associated with serum 
25(OH)D as mentioned above. The dose responsive increases in serum 25(OH)D 
concentration induced by vitamin D3 supplementations were significantly associated 
with the decreased Horvath epigenetic aging in both IV regression models, which 
used assignment 1 as IV in model 1 (p-value = 0.019), and assignment 2 as IV in 
model 2 (p-value = 0.038). 
Discussion 
 
In this study, we found that the DNAm age estimated by either Horvath clock or 
Hannum clock was highly correlated with chronological age in African Americans 
with suboptimal vitamin D status at the baseline. Vitamin D3 supplementation 
decreased DNA methylation aging. More specifically, the epigenetic aging was 
significantly decreased by 4000 IU/day vitamin D3 supplementation according to the 
Horvath clock, and 2000 IU/day was more effective according to the Hannum clock. 
Moreover, serum 25 (OH)D levels were only negatively associated with DNA 
methylation aging measured by the Horvath clock.  
Studies in mice suggest that caloric restriction slows epigenetic aging and 
DNA methylation drift 43,44. However, whether epigenetic clock changes in response 
to a geroprotective intervention in humans remains unknown. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation 
on epigenetic aging in humans using a RCT design. 
DNAm age is a prediction of age based on individual DNA methylation levels 
with high accuracy 1, and has been employed by a number of studies and validated 
with a high correlation between DNAm age and chronological age 8,45. In the present

study, we observed that DNA methylation age calculated by either the Horvath 
method or the Hannum method was both highly correlated with chronological age in 
African Americans. The unadjusted correlation analysis showed that this correlation 
was higher at the baseline than posttest, suggesting that the vitamin D3 
supplementation may have driven the DNAm age to deviate from the chronological 
age. 
The present study explored the treatment effect of vitamin D3 supplementation 
on three doses (600 IU/day, 2000 IU/day and 4000 IU/day). Compared with placebo, 
both 2000 IU and 4000 IU group decreased epigenetic aging by either clock. 
However, the associations between vitamin D3 supplementations and epigenetic aging 
were different between the Horvath and Hannum clocks. The epigenetic aging was 
significantly decreased by 4000 IU/day vitamin D3 supplementation according to the 
Horvath clock, and 2000 IU/day was more effective according to the Hannum clock. 
This discrepancy may be due to the fact that only 6 CpG sites overlap between these 
two epigenetic clocks 9. In addition, they were built to represent different tissues. 
Horvath is a multi-tissue clock built to capture more variation while Hannum only 
applies to blood leukocytes 45. It may also due to the small sample size. In addition, 
the increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration by vitamin D3 supplementations was 
associated with the decrease in Horvath epigenetic aging regardless of groups. Future 
large-scale studies are needed to confirm our findings. 
Accelerated epigenetic aging was considered a predictor of mortality 46, and 
was associated with higher all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and cardiovascular 
mortality 10. Meta-analyses have shown that vitamin D supplementation was 
associated with decreased overall mortality 47,48. We have also shown that vitamin D

supplementation increases telomerase activity, which may help slow down the cellular 
aging process in the African American population 32. The present study suggests that 
vitamin D supplementation may also slow down the epigenetic aging process. 
 Most of previous studies on epigenetic aging are cross-sectional, which 
cannot establish causal relationships between risk factors, such as nutrients, physical 
measurements and environments, and epigenetic aging, and unable to observe the 
changes of DNAm age overtime 14,16. Some studies have tracked down the 
longitudinal changes of epigenetic aging and transcriptional response, however,  
RCTs can establish causal relationships 4,18,49,50. In this study, an RCT was carried out 
and measurements were taken both before and after the intervention, which allowed 
us to observe the longitudinal changes of the epigenetic aging, and infer the causal 
relationship between vitamin D supplementation and epigenetic aging.  
We tested the test-retest reliability of these two epigenetic clocks in our study 
(Supplementary Table S1). The coefficients of variation (CV) between the baseline 
and posttest measurements were 8.36% for the Horvath clock and 8.74% for the 
Hannum clock suggesting that the measurements of epigenetic clock between the two 
visits were highly correlated and reproducible. The correlation between the baseline 
and posttest of the Horvath clock was the highest in the placebo group, possibly due 
to that fact that vitamin D supplementation may have driven the DNAm age to deviate 
from the chronological age. 
There are several strengths in our study. First, to the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first study to evaluate the effect of a nutritional intervention on epigenetic 
aging utilizing a randomized controlled clinical trial design, which could help to 
establish a causal relationship. Second, our study focused on the African American

population with suboptimal vitamin D status and who are prone to higher risk for age-
related diseases 51. However, our power for repeated measurements was estimated to 
be modest with 16% to detect the difference in ∆Age changes between placebo and 
the 4000IU/day group, and 70% to detect the difference in ∆Age changes between 
two groups (placebo/600 IU/day vs. 2000/4000IU/day). Of note, this is an ancillary 
study, which was not originally designed to test this hypothesis. Therefore, there is a 
considerable likelihood of both false-positive and false-negative results. Further large-
scale studies are needed to validate our results and address dose-response effects of 
vitamin D supplement on epigenetic aging. We observed a decreased epigenetic aging 
by 16-week vitamin D supplementation in overweight African American population. 
Whether this geroprotective effect of vitamin D supplementation can be sustained 
over longer period is unknown. Also unknown is whether this anti-biological aging 
effect exists in other populations. Future longer term RCTs in other populations are 
warranted.  
Biological aging measures have been proposed as proxies for extension of 
healthy lifespan. Belsky et al. found that biological aging measured by two other 
clinical algorithms are sensitive enough to detect effects of geroprotective therapy in a 
small randomized trial 52. We were also able to detect significant changes in DNA 
methylation aging induced by vitamin D3 supplementation in a relatively small RCT, 
which suggest that markers of biological aging such as epigenetic aging can be used 
as endpoints in RCTs that aim to extend healthy lifespan. 
Conclusion 
For the first time, our results suggest that vitamin D3 supplementation may 
slow down the Horvath epigenetic aging process in overweight/obese African

aging is not conclusive. Future longer term and large scale RCTs in other populations 
are warranted to validate our findings.

Figure legend 
Figure 1. Correlation of Horvath DNA methylation age and chronological age. 
Y-axis is Horvath DNAm age, and X-axis is chronological age. Round symbols 
represent baseline observations, while the triangle symbols represent posttest 
observations. Lines linking round symbols to triangle ones represent changes of each 
participant from baseline to posttest. Overall pairwise correlation coefficient of 
Horvath DNAm age and chronological age is 0.90 (p-value < 0.001). The correlation 
was higher in the baseline (r=0.92, p-value < 0.001) than posttest (r=0.88, p-value < 
0.001). 
Figure 2. Correlation of Hannum DNA methylation age and chronological age. 
Y-axis is Hannum DNAm age, and X-axis is chronological age. Round symbols 
represent baseline observations, while the triangle symbols represent posttest 
observations. Lines linking round symbols to triangle ones represent changes of each 
participant from baseline to posttest. Overall pairwise correlation coefficient of 
Hannum DNAm age and chronological age is 0.82 (p-value < 0.001).

Note: Totally 99 observations of 51 participants. Models were adjusted for sex, BMI, group assignment, measure time, month of visit, 
baseline 25(OH)D concentration and CD4 percent. Model 1 used assignment 1 that reassigned participants into two groups, which were 
group 1 including placebo and 600 IU/day, and group 2 including 2000 IU/day and 4000 IU/day. Effect 1 was the interaction term of
