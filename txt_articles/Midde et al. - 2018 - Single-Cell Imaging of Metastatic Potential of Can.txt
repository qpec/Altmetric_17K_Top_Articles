SUMMARY
Molecular imaging of metastatic ‘‘potential’’ is an unvanquished challenge. To engineer biosensors
that can detect and measure the metastatic ‘‘potential’’ of single living cancer cells, we carried out
a comprehensive analysis of the pan-cancer phosphoproteome to search for actin remodelers required
for cell migration, which are enriched in cancers but excluded in normal cells. Only one phosphoprotein
emerged, tyr-phosphorylated CCDC88A (GIV/Girdin), a bona fide metastasis-related protein across a
variety of solid tumors. We designed multi-modular biosensors that are partly derived from GIV, and
because GIV integrates prometastatic signaling by multiple oncogenic receptors, we named them ‘‘‘in-
tegrators of metastatic potential (IMP).’’ IMPs captured the heterogeneity of metastatic potential
within primary lung and breast tumors at steady state, detected those few cells that have acquired
the highest metastatic potential, and tracked their enrichment during metastasis. These findings pro-
vide proof of concept that IMPs can measure the diversity and plasticity of metastatic potential of tu-
mor cells in a sensitive and unbiased way.
INTRODUCTION
Metastasis is the dissemination of highly invasive cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant vital organs
and the principal cause of cancer-related deaths (McAllister and Weinberg, 2014). However, not all tumors
are metastatic, and determining the metastatic proclivity of single tumor cells remains a major challenge
due to several reasons. First, and arguably the biggest, hurdle is tumor molecular heterogeneity because
finding the few cells (0.02% [McAllister and Weinberg, 2014]) that have the potential to metastasize, inter-
spersed within a mass of tumor cells that will not metastasize, requires precise tools that can pick up a few
‘‘signals’’ amid the thunderous ‘‘noise.’’ Second, our understanding of what imparts metastatic potential
remains incomplete despite increased comprehension of a more detailed signaling network with central
control nodes (McAllister and Weinberg, 2014) and biomarkers that can detect such potential across
different carcinomas are still lacking. Third, the genome of the cancer cell is rewired and signaling networks
are reprogrammed during this process of metastatic progression, either to adapt to the changing tumor
microenvironment or to overcome the cytotoxicity of drugs (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), and bio-
markers/tools that monitor any given pathway may lose significance due to the changing/evolving tumor
dependency from that pathway to unknown pathway(s) (the so-called addiction switch) (Weinstein,
2002). Consequently, pathway-specific biomarkers that monitor the ‘‘known’’ in the setting of the so-called
unknown-unknowns of tumor biology introduce bias in the short run and prove ineffective in the long run.
Last, but not least, single-cell studies have shown that when stochastic, invasive, and proliferative events
are triggered by perturbations (e.g., mechanical or chemical signals), each individual cell adapts on its
own, i.e., cancer cells go solo (Chung et al., 2017; Ellsworth et al., 2017; Ferronika et al., 2017; Kimura
et al., 2010; Kubota et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2014; Lorentzen et al., 2018; Ramapathiran et al., 2014; Su
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018). Hence, any effective biomarker/assay must be sensitive enough to detect
the plasticity of metastatic programming within a few sparsely distributed tumorigenic cells, i.e., cells
that can metastasize and initiate new tumors at distant sites, within a large population of non-tumorigenic
cells.
Despite these shortfalls, experts agree that estimating the metastatic ‘‘potential’’ is a problem that only
molecular imaging can resolve, rather than conventional techniques, e.g., immunohistochemistry (IHC)
(Winnard et al., 2008). So far, improved imaging platforms have helped detect established metastases (Fran-
gioni, 2008) and assessed tumor cell properties as surrogate markers of metastatic potential (e.g., glucose
consumption, hypoxia, angiogenesis, integrin expression patterns, or matrix metalloproteinase activities;
reviewed in Winnard et al., 2008) and even visualized the metastatic process in real time in vivo (Sahai,
2007). However, single-cell-based assays to measure the dynamic prometastatic signaling programs that

 contribute to the ‘‘potential’’ for metastasis remains a Holy Grail. This is largely because conventional
approaches (immunofluorescence and IHC) employed to study most biomarkers on fixed tissues are fraught
with technical limitations (Sato et al., 2002; Veeriah et al., 2014). Even when live cells or tissues are used in the
above-mentioned approaches, one serious flaw remains, i.e., the loss of vital information pertinent to
individual cells due to averaging over an ensemble of readouts (Ray, 2013). The concept of single-cell
studies has gained traction in the fields of metabolomics (Zenobi, 2013) and signal transduction (Clister
et al., 2015; Philips, 2005) and among cell biologists who seek to explore how cellular processes are orga-
nized and regulated in vivo (Midde et al., 2013), but has not been applied to study metastatic potential.
Here we report the development of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors that mea-
sure the metastatic potential of single living cancer cells by overcoming both aforementioned limitations,
i.e., they account for the unknown-unknowns of an evolving tumor biology and eliminate averaging losses
during conventional molecular imaging.
RESULTS
Pan-cancer Phosphoproteome Reveals that Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Girdin Is a Putative
Metastasis-Related Phosphoevent
In search of an ideal target, first we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the pan-cancer phosphopro-
teome using the NIH-supported, continuously curated, and interactive systems biology resource,
PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2004, 2012, 2015) to study experimentally observed post-translational
modifications in the regulation of biological processes. Using powerful gene ontology (GO)-analytical tools
(PANTHER [Mi et al., 2017], GOrilla [Eden et al., 2009], and REVIGO [Supek et al., 2011]) for mining, inter-
preting, and visualizing this data, we noted that several pathways and biological processes were overrep-
resented in the pan-cancer phosphoproteome above the pan-human phosphoproteome set as reference
(see Figure S1, Table S1). To identify phosphoproteins that are selectively seen in cancers, we searched for
phosphopeptides that are present in cancers, but not in normal tissues. A handful of pathways (Figure S2A)
and biological processes (Figures S2B and S2C) were over- or under-represented over the reference set,
and only one GO term enriched over the others, i.e., negative regulators of apoptosis (Figure S2D).
Because high-resolution imaging of metastasizing cancer cells has underscored the importance of actin
cytoskeleton remodeling as a fundamental prerequisite for cancer invasion (Sahai, 2007), next we searched
the pan-cancer phosphoproteome using a combination of different criteria for enriching for either ‘‘cellular
processes’’ (the largest GO biological process enriched in cancer-specific phosphoproteins; S2b), actin
binders/modulators and those involved in cell migration (the most important property of tumor cells
that has marked effects on tumor growth, resistance, and spread [Waclaw et al., 2015]), but are excluded
from normal tissues (Figure 1A; Tables S2, S3, S4, and S5). Only one phosphopeptide, pY1798, in a protein
named GIV/GRDN (Ga-interacting vesicle-associated; a.k.a. Girdin; gene: CCDC88A) fits all the criteria.
Girdin (a.k.a, GIV, APE, HkRP1) is essentially a large, multi-modular, cytosolic signal transducer that was co-
discovered by four groups nearly simultaneously (Anai et al., 2005; Enomoto et al., 2005, 2006; Simpson

 et al., 2005). It has been recognized as a bona fide driver of metastasis because of its ability to enhance
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signals and couple them to cytoskeletal remodeling (Takahashi
et al., 2015; Weng et al., 2010), an essential feature for tumor cell invasion. Girdin also serves another
role, that of a guanine nucleotide exchange modulator, which integrates signals downstream of multiple
classes of receptors by coupling ligand-activated receptors to activation of trimeric GTPases (Aznar
et al., 2016; DiGiacomo et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2017). Consequently, receptor-initiated signals are modu-
lated by G protein intermediates (Garcia-Marcos et al., 2015). Ligand stimulation of a variety of receptors
directly (as in the case of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases [RTKs]) or indirectly (via non-RTKs, as in the
case of G-protein coupled receptor [GPCRs], Toll-like receptors, integrins) trigger phosphorylation of GIV
on two key tyrosines (Y1764 and Y1798) within its C terminus (Figure 1B) (Dunkel et al., 2016; Kuga et al.,
2017; Lin et al., 2011; Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2015; Mizutani et al., 2018; Omori et al., 2015), which directly
bind and activate Class 1 PI3Ks, and subsequently, Akt (Lin et al., 2011) (Figure S3A). Multiple groups
have independently validated the role of this multi-receotor-GIV-PI3K axis in driving metastasis and/or
enhancing prometastatic features of tumor cells across a variety of solid cancers (summarized in Ghosh,
2015; Ghosh et al., 2011; Takahashi et al., 2015; Weng et al., 2010). These studies have established causal
links between GIV and several ominous traits that aid in the acquisition of metastatic potential, e.g., collec-
tive migration/invasiveness, survival, stemness, and chemoresistance (summarized in Aznar et al., 2016;
Takahashi et al., 2015).
Rationale Design and Validation of FRET Probes that Measure Functional Phosphorylation
of Girdin
We hypothesized that the measurement of the intensity of functional phosphorylation of GIV within the
multi-receptor-GIV-PI3K axis in individual living cells will serve as a surrogate to assess the extent of
multi-receptor-driven prometastatic signaling via the GIV-PI3K node. To achieve this goal, we designed
intramolecular FRET probes with two modules (Figure 1C): (1) short stretches of GIV flanking either one
or both critical tyrosines, Y1764 and Y1798 (Figure S3B) and (2) N-Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of
p85a(PI3K); the former serves as a target substrate for multiple tyrosine kinases, and when phosphorylated
serves as the ligand for recognition by N-SH2- p85a(PI3K). The two modules are separated by a flexible linker
and sandwiched by eCFP (donor) and eYFP (acceptor) proteins, such that binding of the N-SH2- p85a(PI3K)
to phosphotyrosine (pY) GIV ligand leads to folding of the probe bringing the donor and acceptor fluores-
cent proteins into close proximity, with resultant gain in FRET. Because these synthetic probes were built to
assess multi-receptor-GIV-PI3K signaling, we named them ‘‘integrators of metastatic potential (IMPs).’’
We first validated the IMP probes biochemically by confirming that they are expressed as fluorescent-
tagged proteins of expected size and that they are phosphorylated on tyrosines after ligand (epidermal
growth factor [EGF]) stimulation (Figure 1D). Ligand-dependent phosphorylation was virtually abolished
when the corresponding phosphorylation-deficient IMPs were expressed in which Tyr (Y) was substituted
by Phe (F) (henceforth referred to as YF) (Figures 1E, S4A, and S4B). Consistent with the fact that multiple
pathways converge on GIV, IMPs were phosphorylated upon stimulation with multiple growth factors (EGF,
insulin, platelet-derived growth factor) (Figures 1F, S4C, and S4D), non-RTKs Src and FAK (Figures 1G, 1H,
S4E, and S4F), and ligand for LPAR, a GPCR (Figure 1I). As expected, the expression of catalytically active
SHP1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates GIV’s tyrosines (Mittal et al., 2011), abolished
tyrosine phosphorylation of IMPs (Figures 1J and S4G). Finally, because ideal biosensors do not perturb the
system under test (Haugh, 2012), and isolated domains of GIV that can bind RTKs or activate G proteins can
display a range of biological activity (Midde et al., 2015) and alter the ratio of Akt and ERK signals, we asked
which IMP construct is the least perturbing. In the presence of a functional SH2-like or GEF module (Lin
et al., 2014; Midde et al., 2015) IMP-SH2 and IMP-GIV-C-terminus (IMP-CT) constructs (shown in Figure S3B)
altered the levels of Akt and ERK signals at baseline steady states, whereas under the same conditions the
IMP-1764 or IMP-1798, constructs that contain merely 13 amino acids of GIV appeared inert (Figure 1K).
Hence, these two minimalist IMPs were deemed appropriate for further evaluation. Consistent with their
predicted inertness, overexpression of either IMP-1764 or IMP-1798 or their non-phosphorylatable YF mu-
tants did not affect 2D migration in scratch wound assays (Figure S5). Although both Y1764 and Y1798
cooperatively activate PI3Ks, because Y1764 is a target for both RTKs and non-RTKs, whereas Y1798 is
exclusively phosphorylated by non-RTKs (Lin et al., 2011), we focused heavily on IMP-1764.
Next we validated these probes in live cells to determine if ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was
also accompanied by intramolecular folding and FRET. FRET signals were analyzed exclusively at the

 plasma membrane (PM) because Class IA PI3Ks activated by tyrosine-phosphorylated GIV transduce sig-
nals primarily by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate at the PM (Engelman, 2009),
and because tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV (as determined by immunofluorescence using anti-pYGIV
antibody [Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2014]) coincided temporally and spatially with the activation of PI3K (as
determined using the fluorescent reporter, YFP-tagged PH-domain of Akt [Lin et al., 2011]) on microdo-
mains at the PM (Figure 2A). These temporal and spatial patterns were reproduced using IMP probes in
living cells responding to either EGF (Figures 2B and 2C; Videos S1, S2, S3, and S4) or lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) (Figures 2D and 2E; Videos S5 and S6). Regardless of the pathway activated, FRET was observed
at the PM within 2–2.5 min for both IMP-1764 and IMP-1798, albeit with a few notable differences. FRET at
the PM was transient in the case of growth factors, whereas a more delayed (peak 4.5 min) and sustained
response was seen in the case of LPA. These findings are consistent with the differential kinetics of Akt acti-
vation downstream, i.e., Akt phosphorylation typically peaks at 5 min after stimulation with growth factors,
but at 15 min after stimulation of GPCRs (Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009). No FRET was observed when each IMP
was substituted in the above-mentioned assays with its non-phosphorylatable YF counterpart, indicating
that ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV is essential for gaining FRET in each instance.
Furthermore, compared with starved (0% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) cells, increased ambient signals in
serum-fed cells (10% FBS) were accompanied by a higher steady-state probe phosphorylation (Figure 2F)
and FRET efficiency (F.E) (Figures 2G and 2H), indicating that IMPs can detect ambient multi-receptor-
driven signal flow at a steady state without the need to acutely activate a given receptor/pathway. Further-
more, depletion of GIV in MDA-MB-231 cells, which require GIV for their ability to form lung metastases
when xenografted in nude mice (Jiang et al., 2008), was accompanied by a reduction in F.E (Figures
2I–2K). Together, these findings demonstrated that IMPs are the minimal platforms that can measure the
timing, intensity, and location of functional phosphorylation of GIV in living cells at steady state.
Single-Cell Imaging of Signaling through the GIV-PI3K Axis Reveals the Heterogeneity in
Metastatic Potential and Tracks the Increasing Potential during Metastasis
Next we asked if the IMPs can measure the steady-state ambient multi-receptor signaling via the GIV-PI3K
axis. If F.E. were to be measured at steady state, we assumed such measurement to reflect the equilibrium
between the activity of multiple tyrosine kinases (i.e., forward reaction), the antagonistic dephosphorylat-
ing action of PTP and SHP1 (i.e., reverse rate reactions), and any upstream triggers to both enzymes. Hence,
a high F.E observed would imply the activation of multiple pathways that trigger the prometastatic tyrosine
kinase signaling pathways as well as those that suppress SHP1’s protein phosphatase activity and would
indicate overall hypersignaling via the TK-GIV axis. We specifically asked if such steady-state measure-
ments can serve as a readout of the aberrant TK-GIV prometastatic signaling during the acquisition of met-
astatic potential. If so, we predicted that such measurement should come with three key advantages: (1)
eliminate the need to know to which upstream pathways (drivers versus hitchhikers) a given tumor is ad-
dicted; (2) avoid perturbing the intrinsic pathologic pathways with extrinsic ligands that introduce unde-
sired bias, and (3) ensure continued usefulness despite changes in tumor dependency on a given pathway,
as during metastatic progression or development of drug resistance. To test these, we first validated the
IMPs using three well-characterized metastatic breast and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-
231, PC-9, and H2030, and their corresponding highly metastatic subclones (BrM) that were selected in
mice and display �10-fold enhanced ability to metastasize to the bone and brain (Nguyen et al., 2009;
Valiente et al., 2014) (Figure S6A). Despite their diverse genetic backgrounds (Figure S6B), all BrM clones
consistently displayed one common feature compared with their parental counterparts: higher Akt activity
(Figures 3A–3C), whereas the patterns of immunofluorescence staining for tyrosine-phosphorylated GIV
(pY1764GIV) showed only minor differences (Figure S7). Using the IMP-Y1764 probe, we found that the

 steady-state F.E. in individual cells varied over a range in these cells (Figures 3D–3F); the variance is in keep-
ing with the expected heterogeneity in metastatic potential within a given population of cells (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). However, the mean F.E. of the BrM cells was consistently �2-fold higher than that of their
parental counterparts (Figures 3D–3F). Gaussian fits of the histograms of the FRET efficiencies of individual
cells from these paired cell lines revealed that parental cells were more heterogeneous (wider spread of F.E
with two peaks), whereas their BrM counterparts were less heterogeneous (a single narrow peak), and that a
subset of parental cells behaved just like BrM cells (partial overlap between second peak of parental cells
and the BrM cells). Because a feature of quantitative single-cell imaging is to allow the measured entity to
be quantified by choosing a cutoff value for the histogram of overlap integrals, the data in Figure 3G sug-
gest that 0.14 is a reasonable cutoff; values below or above 0.14 would indicate that the potential for metas-
tasis is low or high, respectively. Because some cells in the parental population displayed F.E. > 0.14 and
overlapped with BrM cells, these findings validate that single-cell steady-state F.E. measured using IMP-
Y1764 can detect those subpopulations of parental cells that have acquired the metastatic potential, but
risk being obscured by averaging (mean F.E. of parental cells = 0.125, which is below the 0.14 cutoff).
We also confirmed that the high F.E. observed in BrM cells required a phosphorylatable tyrosine within the
IMP-Y1764 probe (Figures S8A and S8B) and yet did not merely reflect a generalized hyperactivation of
tyrosine-based signaling (Figure S8C). Furthermore, replacement of the GIV sequence in IMP-Y1764 with
a stretch of residues that flank Y941 on IRS1 (Figure S8D), which is phosphorylated by multiple RTKs and
binds p85a(PI3K) (Sato et al., 2002), abolished the probe’s ability to distinguish parental from their BrM
counterparts (Figures S8E and S8F). These results demonstrate the functional specificity of tyrosine-phos-
phorylated GIV as a portal for the integration of prometastatic PI3K signaling downstream of multiple re-
ceptors; findings were not reproducible by other phosphotyrosine substrate that also serve as ligand for
p85a(PI3K).
Next we interrogated the ability of the IMP-Y1764 probe to distinguish between the MCF7 and MDA-MB-231
cells, two lines frequently studied for their contrasting metastatic potential (Winnard et al., 2008). MDA-
MB-231 cells express full-length GIV (Figure S9A) and metastasize at a frequency approaching �100%
(100% to LN, 40%–70% to lungs), whereas the MCF7 cells do not metastasize (Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011;
Ghosh et al., 2010; Jenkins et al., 2005). We found that that the extent of phosphorylation of IMP-Y1764 (Fig-
ure S9B) and the mean F.E. in MCF7 (0.06 G 0.01) and MDA-MB-231 cells (0.24 G 0.05) (Figures S9C and S9D)
were in keeping with their contrasting metastatic potentials. These results suggest that the IMP probe may be
able to distinguish tumor cells with high metastatic potential from the others. Despite the fact that one major
outcome of tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV and its ability to bind PI3K is the enhancement of Akt signals, the
IMP-Y1764 probe did not capture all forms of ambient Akt signals in cells because we noted that the F.E. in
MCF7 cells was low, despite high levels of Akt phosphorylation (Figure S9A). These findings suggest that
F.E of IMP-Y1764 can somehow distinguish prometastatic GIV-PI3K-Akt signals from other Akt signals.
Single-Cell Imaging of Signaling through the GIV-PI3K Axis Maintains Its Usefulness in
Tracking Metastatic Potential Despite Tumor Evolution and Onset of Chemoresistance
Next we asked if the IMP-Y1764 probe retains its ability to detect the metastatic potential of tumor
cells despite evolving signaling programs and tumor biology. Such evolution is encountered under two
circumstances:(1) during metastatic progression in humans and (2) during the development of drug resis-
tance. To study the first, we used the 21T lines that were derived from the same patient during breast cancer
progression (Band et al., 1990) (Figure 3H) and display an array of changing epigenetic, proteomic, and
signaling programs during progressive acquisition of metastatic potential (Figure S10A). Enhanced Akt

 signaling during metastatic progression in 21T cells (Qiao et al., 2007) has previously been shown to track
well with increased expression of GIV mRNA and protein (Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011) as well as enhanced
tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV at Y1764/98 (Lin et al., 2011). Here we found that F.E using the IMP-Y1764
probe was low in normal (PT-ci; 0.08 G 0.01) but high in primary (NT-ci; 0.28 G 0.07) and metastasized
(MT-1; 0.38 G 0.03) cells (Figures 3I and S10B), indicating that the probe could effectively categorize
both NT-ci and MT-1 as cells with ‘‘high’’ potential for metastasis regardless of the changes in tumor
biology incurred during disease progression over 1 year and cytotoxic chemotherapy received by the pa-
tient (Band et al., 1990). Furthermore, as in the case of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the chosen cutoff F.E.
of 0.14 was effective in accurately detecting the metastatic potential of 21T cells (Figure S11).
To study the impact of changing tumor biology during the acquisition of drug resistance, we used three breast
and lung cancer lines (Figures S12A and 4A–4C) with variable resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy (docetaxel)
or inhibitors of RTKs (erlotinib and lapatinib). Compared with the sensitive clones, both pY1764GIV (Fig-
ure S12B) and Akt phosphorylations (Figures 4A–4C) were consistently enhanced and their expressions were
upregulated in their resistant counterparts. This is in keeping with the fact that invasiveness/epithelial-mesen-
chymal transition (EMT) and stemness, two features of drug resistance, are both modulated by GIV (Singh and
Settleman, 2010). The F.E measured using IMP-Y1764 was similarly elevated �2- to 3-fold in the resistant clones
(Figures 4D–4F), indicating that the probe accurately detected the acquisition of higher metastatic potential
that coincides with drug resistance. Such detection was possible regardless of the unknown-unknowns of
evolving tumor biology during the acquisition of resistance (Figure S12A).
In conclusion, IMP-Y1764 features three properties that make it ideal for molecular imaging: (1) a unique target,
i.e., GIV, whose functional phosphorylation broadly reflects the intensity of convergent signaling from multiple
upstream pathways via the prometastatic PI3K-Akt pathway; (2) usefulness in a FRET-based approach that
retains single-cell information; and (3) ability to fulfill an urgent and unmet need, i.e., measure metastatic
potential inasensitive,specific,objective,andunbiasedwaybyovercomingthelimitationsoftheunknown (Fig-
ures 4G and 4H). That IMP-Y1764 detected the ‘‘high’’ potential for metastasis of 21T-NT-ci cells at diagnosis
and 1 year before metastasis to the lungs/pleura (Band et al., 1990) suggests that F.E readouts using the
IMP-Y1764 probe and the cutoff of 0.14 may be further developed for use ex vivo or in vitro in assays investi-
gating personalized cancer therapeutic response, such that the sensitivity of any tumor to any small molecule
will be studied specifically against those cells with the highest metastatic proclivity in any given tumor.
DISCUSSION
One key goal of the National Cancer Institute’s Precision Medicine Initiative focuses on the development of
new tools to tailor cancer therapy to the disease status and risk of metastasis—patients at high risk for met-
astatic disease would receive aggressive, frequently molecularly targeted therapy, whereas those with low
risk for metastatic disease would be treated with appropriate local therapies, sparing them toxic side ef-
fects of therapy while maintaining high likelihood for cure. One of the main challenges preventing the im-
plementation of precision medicine for metastasis is the limited understanding of signaling molecules and
pathways that confer high metastatic potential to a small subset of cancer cells, the so-called unique subset
of cancer cells, designated as metastasis-initiating cells (MICs) within a larger, heterogeneous tumor. The
identity of MICs remains largely unknown, which poses two critical challenges for cancer therapy. (1) Devel-
opment of drugs to block metastasis: The ability of disseminated cancer cells to produce clinically evident
metastases defines a central bottleneck in disease progression. Targeting key drivers of this process rep-
resents an ideal opportunity to stop metastatic disease, even for malignant cells that disseminated before
the detection of a primary tumor. (2) Stratification of patients for treatment: Only a subpopulation of
patients with cancer develop metastases. Lack of reliable markers to identify MICs and patients at high
risk for metastasis leads to over-treatment, causing toxic side effects without benefit to a patient.

iScience 10, 53–65, December 21, 2018
 Identifying MICs remains daunting because of the molecular heterogeneity of cancer cells, uncertainty
about what molecules and signaling pathways confer metastatic potential, and dynamic re-wiring of
signaling during metastasis. Detection of MICs as a biomarker for risk of metastasis offers the potential
to advance cancer research, drug discovery and development, and patient care.
Our major accomplishment here is that we have engineered IMP biosensors that can detect and measure
the metastatic ‘‘potential’’ of single living cancer cells (presumably any type of cancer) at a steady state.
However, perhaps more importantly, we provided evidence that these biosensors can do so while remain-
ing agnostic to the numerous unknown-unknowns of the tumor’s biology, such as any genetic aberration or
the epigenetic aberrations of any specific ligand/pathway. Consequently, these sensors maintain their
effectiveness despite the evolving changes in the tumor cells during the natural progression of disease,
or during progression under the selection pressure of anti-cancer therapies. Thus, our findings provide
proof of concept that the IMP biosensors can measure the diversity and plasticity of metastatic potential
of tumor cells in a sensitive and unbiased way, and in doing so, may serve as effective tools to visualize,
track, and enrich (by sorting) the MICs.
LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Despite our success in validation of the IMP probes in cultured tumor cells, further evolution of the probes is
a must before they can be used for in vivo imaging studies (e.g., use of better fluorophores for deep tissue
imaging explants in nude mice). Because the signaling event (tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV) specifically
localizes to focal adhesions, it may be critical that any sorting-related application does so while maintaining
cell-extra-cellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Despite our use of OxyFluor to minimize reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS)-induced photobleaching, it is possible that increased ROS production in tumor cells affect either
the signaling pathways monitored with IMPs or the IMP probes themselves, or both. Finally, the commonly
used dimerization-preventing mutation (A206K) was not present in IMPs (see details in Methods). Because
on and off rate balance in IMPs at steady state critically depends on the intramolecular affinities of fluores-
cent proteins (FPs), any further optimization of the IMPs (either by design, or change in FPs, or based on the
proposed mode of use, i.e., at steady state versus after an acute stimuli) will require considering how these
rates may affect readouts. Such optimization and thoughtful considerations are warranted because suc-
cessful validation of tools to detect MICs will be a transformative advance for cancer cell biology. For
example, IMPs could be adapted and evolved for the development of an imaging-based ex vivo screening
platform for assessing the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs in killing the MICs within any tumor type; they
could define quantitative metrics for activation of GIV that correlates with metastatic potential, providing
the foundation needed to advance GIV as a prognostic biomarker for metastasis and potential drug target
to eliminate MICs. Ultimately, these efforts could enable the clinical implementation of precision cancer
therapy to improve the treatment and quality of life for patients.

 TRANSPARENT METHODS: 
 
Reagents and Antibodies: All reagents used in this study are of research grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. Cell culture media were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). EGF
(Invitrogen), Insulin (Novagen), Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA) (Sigma) and PDGF (Invitrogen) were obtained 
commercially. The Src inhibitor PP2 was obtained from Calbiochem. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors Erlotinib
(ChemieTek, Indianapolis, IN. Cat # CT-EL002) and Lapatinib (LC laboratories. Cat # L-4899) drugs were 
generously donated by Frank Furnari (Ludwig Cancer Institute - UCSD). Docetaxel was commercially obtained from
Sigma Aldrich (cat # 01885). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against pTyr (BD Biosciences, cat # 610000), GFP
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (Covance), total (t)ERK (Cell Signaling) and tubulin (Sigma) were purchased from
commercial sources. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GIV-CT (Girdin T-13, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
phospho-Akt S473 (Cell Signaling), and phospho-ERK 1/2 (Cell Signaling) were obtained commercially. Rabbit 
monoclonal antibodies against pY1068 EGFR and total (t)Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling and anti-pY1764 
GIV antibodies were obtained from Spring Biosciences (Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2014). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit 
Alexa-594- and Alexa-488-coupled goat secondary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence. Goat anti-rabbit 
and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 680 or IRDye 800 F(ab')2 for immunoblotting were from Li-COR Biosciences 
(Lincoln, NE). Rabbit or mouse IgGs used as negative controls in immunoprecipitation was purchased from BioRad
(Hercules, CA) and Sigma (St. Louis, MO), respectively.   
  
Plasmid Constructs: IMP-FRET probes encoding different stretches of GIV's C-terminus encompassing either one 
or both critical tyrosines, Y1764 and Y1798 of GIV were generated using the cloning strategy previously described
for the ‘phocus-2nes’ FRET probe that was used to measure functional phosphorylation of the adaptor protein IRS-
1 (Sato et al., 2002). Briefly,  fragment cDNAs of mutant ECFP (mutations are F64L, S65T, Y66W, N146I, M153T,
V163A and N212K), mutant EYFP (mutations are S65G, V68L, Q69K, S72A and T203Y), various stretches of
substrate domain from human GIV (Accession# BAE44387; see Fig S3b), phosphorylation recognition domain [the 
N-terminal SH2 domain,  residues 330-429 from the p85α subunit of bovine PI3K (Accession# NM_174575), which 
is reported to bind both critical tyrosines within GIV's C-terminus (Lin et al., 2011)] were generated by standard PCR
and cloned into the restriction sites shown in Fig 1c. A nuclear-export signal sequence (NES) – LPPLERLTL (Ullman 
et al., 1997), was inserted to retain the IMP probe in cytosol. Amino acid sequences of flexible linker LnL10 and 
LnL20 are GNNGGNGGSNNGGNNGNGG and GNNGGNGGSNNGNGGNGNNGGNNGNGG, respectively.
Various IMP constructs, as illustrated in Fig S3b, were subcloned between HindIII and XbaI sites of  pcDNA 3.1(+)
vector (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA) using Fast Cloning Technique (Li et al., 2011). There are two noteworthy
specifics in our chosen paired fluorophores: 1) Q69K mutation in eYFP: Q69 is fairly close to the chromophore anion 
inside the β-barrel of YFP. It was previously reported that Q69K could promote the anionic form of the chromophore
to hinder its protonation, and therefore reduce the apparent pKa to 6.1, with little effect on its other sensitivities
(Griesbeck et al., 2001). 2) The commonly used dimerization preventing mutation (A206K) was not present in our
construct. Prior work has carefully documented that this mutation renders probes that require conformational 
changes to monitor dynamic signaling events non-functional because such conformational changes depend on the
weak dimerization, and yet, does not produce significant artifacts of intermolecular dimerization-related FRET (Jost 
et al., 2008; Kotera et al., 2010). The sequences of primers that were used for cloning IMP constructs are available 
upon request. GFP-Akt-PH was obtained from R. Tsien (UCSD) and previously used as a reporter to study GIV-
dependent activation of PI3K in cells (Lin et al., 2011). C-terminal HA-tagged c-Src for mammalian expression was 
generated by cloning the entire coding sequence into pcDNA 3.1 between Xho I and Eco RI. HA tagged SHP-1 was 
used and validated previously (Mittal et al., 2011). All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing prior to their 
use in various assays. 
 
Cell Lines: MDA-MB-231, PC-9 and H2030 parental and their brain metastatic (BrM) counterparts listed in Fig. S5b
were generous gifts from Joan Massagué (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Briefly, metastatic
cells were isolated from either lymph node or pleural effusions of cancer patients and selected in nude mice to
 generate the BrM subclones, which are known to exhibit higher invasiveness and metastatic proclivity to brain and
bone (Nguyen et al., 2009; Valiente et al., 2014). The 21T series (16N, NT and MT2) cancer cell lines isolated from
different stages of breast cancer progression were generous gifts from Arthur B. Pardee (Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute, Harvard Medical School) and cultured as described earlier (Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011; Souter et al., 2010). 
Hs578T cells were obtained from ATCC, and their Docetaxel-resistant subclones were generated according to the
protocol developed by Andrew C. Schofield et al (Brown et al., 2004). Briefly, cells were exposed to incremental 
concentrations of sub-lethal doses of docetaxel on a daily-basis for 1 hr, followed by splitting and recovery until 
stable revival of growth in media with drug concentration of 30 µM was achieved. Erlotinib and Lapatinib resistant
HCC827 were generous gifts from Frank Furnari (Ludwig Cancer Institute – UCSD).  Unless mentioned otherwise, 
cell lines used in this work were cultured according to ATCC guidelines, or guidelines previously published for each
line. 
 
Transfection and Cell Lysis: Transfection was carried out using Genejuice (Novagen) or Mirus LT1 (Mirus) for
DNA plasmids as previously described (Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009; Ghosh et al., 2010). Lysates were prepared by
resuspending cells in lysis buffer [20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mM Mg-acetate, 125 mM K-acetate, 0.4% Triton X-100, 
1 mM DTT, supplemented with sodium orthovanadate (500 µM), phosphatase (Sigma) and protease (Roche)
inhibitor cocktails], after which they were passed through a 30G needle at 4°C, and cleared (10-14,000 g for 10 min) 
before being used in subsequent experiments.  
 
In cellulo phosphorylation assays: Cos7 cells expressing the indicated IMP probes in various assays were
starved overnight at ~30 h after transfection, and subsequently treated with 0.2 mM Na3VO4 for 1 h prior to 
stimulation with growth factors or GPCR ligands. Cells were then washed with chilled PBS at 4˚C that was 
supplemented with 500 µM Na3VO4, lysed using ~400 µl of lysis buffer, and equal aliquots of lysates (~1-2 mg of 
total protein) were incubated for 4 hours at 4°C with either anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (1 µg) (Lane et al., 
2008) or control mouse IgG. Protein G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were then added to the lysates and
incubated at 4°C for additional 60 min. Beads were then washed 3 times using 1 ml of lysis buffer, and immune 
complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli's sample buffer. For steady state in vivo phosphorylation assays, IMP
probes were co-transfected with Src or SHP1 constructs, and after 48 h of transfection cells were lysed and
immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP mAb exactly as described for assays using ligand stimulation. In all assays
tyrosine phosphorylation of IMP probes was detected by dual color immunoblotting with anti-pTyr mAb (BD 
Biosciences; Cat # 610000) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP using LiCOR Odyssey. Presence of yellow pixels on
overlay of pTyr (green) and GFP (red) was interpreted as tyrosine phosphorylation of the IMP probe. 
 
Scratch-wound healing assays: Sub-confluent (~85-90%) monolayers of HeLa cells were transiently transfected
(exactly as outlined above) within 6-8 h after splitting with IMP constructs, grown to confluence over 24-30 h prior 
to scratch-wounding with the tip of a 200 µl pipette. The media was changed immediately afterwards to remove the
scraped cells and avoid them from settling down. Wounds were imaged immediately after wounding at designated 
spots. The exact same coordinate was imaged again after 12 and 24 hours by light microscopy. Images were 
analyzed using ImageJ by outlining the borders of the wound at the beginning and end of the assay time points.
 
Fӧrster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) studies: Intramolecular FRET was detected by sensitized emission 
using the three-cube method were performed as previously reported by Midde et al (Midde et al., 2015). All 
fluorescence microscopy assays were performed on single cells in mesoscopic regime to avoid inhomogeneities
from samples as shown previously by Midde et al. (Borejdo et al., 2012; Midde et al., 2014).  Briefly, cells were 
sparsely split into sterile 35 mm MatTek glass bottom dishes and transfected with 1 µg of various IMP constructs
illustrated in Fig. S3b. An Olympus IX81 FV1000 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope was used for live cell
FRET imaging (UCSD-Neuroscience core facility). The microscope is stabilized on a vibration proof platform, caged
 in temperature controlled (37°C) and CO2 (5%) supplemented chamber. A PlanApo 60x 1.40 N.A. oil immersed 
objective designed to minimize chromatic aberration and enhance resolution for 405-605 nm imaging was used.
Olympus Fluoview inbuilt software was used for data acquisition. A 515 nm Argon-ion laser was used to excite 
EYFP and a 405 nm laser diode was used to excite ECFP as detailed by Claire Brown's group (Broussard et al., 
2013). Spectral bleed-through coefficients were determined through FRET-imaging of donor-only and acceptor-only 
samples (i.e. cells expressing a single donor or acceptor FP). Enhanced CFP emission was collected from 425-500 
nm and EYFP emission was collected through 535-600 nm and passed through a 50 nm confocal pinhole before
being sent to a photomultiplier tube to reject out of plane focused light. Every field of view (FOV) is imaged
sequentially through ECFPex/ECFPem, ECFPex/EYFPem and EYFPex/EYFPem (3 excitation and emission
combinations) and saved as donor, FRET and acceptor image files through an inbuilt wizard. To obtain the FRET
images and efficiency of energy transfer values a RiFRET plugin in Image J software was used (Roszik et al., 2009). 
Prior to FRET calculations, all images were first corrected for uneven illumination, registered, and background-
subtracted. Manual and automatic registration of each individual channel in ImageJ was critical to correct for motion
artifacts associated with live cell imaging. Controls were performed in which images were obtained in different
orders. The order in which images were obtained had no effect. FRET images were obtained by pixel-by-pixel 
ratiometric intensity method and efficiency of transfer was calculated by the ratio of intensity in transfer channel to
the quenched (corrected) intensity in the donor channel. The following corrections were applied to all FOVs imaged:
For cross-talk correction, cells transfected with CFP or YFP alone were imaged under all three previously mentioned
excitation and emission combinations. FRET efficiency was quantified from 3-4 Regions of Interests (ROI) per cell 
drawn exclusively along the P.M. Because expression of FRET probes may have a significant impact on FRET
efficiency, cells that expressed similar amounts of probes, as determined by computing the fluorescence 
signal/intensity by a photon counting histogram were selectively chosen for FRET analyses. Furthermore, 
untransfected cells and a field of view with-out cells were imaged to correct for background, autofluorescence and
light scattering. To avoid artifacts of photobleaching, Oxyfluor (www.oxyrase.com) was used to minimize the
formation of reactive oxygen species.  
 
Statistical Analyses: Data presented is representative of at-least 3 independent experiments and statistical 
significance was assessed by student t test, where p value < 0.05 at 95% was considered statistically significant. 
Statistical plots, including the Gaussian kernel density plot to the histogram were generated using GraphPad or 
OriginLab softwares.

 SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES AND LEGENDS 
 
Figure S1. Mining the PhosphositePlus® (PSP) database for pan-cancer phosphoproteome [Related to Figure 1]. A 
list of 324 proteins whose phosphosites are observed in cancers (see Table S1) were subjected to an enrichment analysis 
using analysis tools from the PANTHER Classification System (Mi et al., 2013). Pathways (a) and GO-biological processes 
(b) enriched among these 324 proteins compared to the entire human phosphoproteome as reference are displayed. % of 
protein in the category is calculated for each list (the human phosphoproteome reference list and the pan- cancer 
phosphoproteome list) as: (# proteins for the category/ # proteins in the list) X 100. Underrepresented pathways are 
highlighted in green.  
  
Figure S2. Mining the PhosphositePlus (PSP) database and visualizing GO enrichment in the cancer-specific 
phosphoproteome [Related to Figure 1]. (a-b) A list of 72 phosphoproteins from the PSP database that fit the criteria for 
being found in cancers but excluded in normal tissues (see Table S2) were subjected to an enrichment analysis using 
analysis tools from the PANTHER Classification System (Mi et al., 2013). Pathways (a) and GO biological processes (b) 
enriched among these 72 proteins compared to the entire human phosphoproteome as reference are displayed. (c-d) The 
list of phosphoproteins observed in cancers (Table S1) and the list of phosphoproteins observed in cancers but excluded 
in normal tissues (Table S2) were submitted to the Reduce + Visualize Gene Ontology (REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011)) 
analysis tool and GO terms were visualized in a semantic similarity-based scatterplots on left and right, respectively. GO-
biological process enriched in the pan-cancer phosphoproteome (left) is notable for regulators of cell cycle, DNA replication 
and multiple metabolic pathways. By contrast, negative regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway is the only GO-biological 
process that is enriched in the cancer-specific phosphoproteome (i.e., phosphoproteins observed in cancers, not in normal 
tissues). The colors do not reflect pathway direction but rather the degree of statistical significance. Red circles indicate 
regulated pathways that are different to a highly significant degree; green and blue also indicate significant difference, but 
to a lesser degree. The color intensity represents the negative log10 p value for each of the statistically enriched pathways 
shown on the scatterplot.   
 
  
 
 
Figure S3. Rationale for the modular design of IMP probes [Relevant to Figure 1]. (a) Previously validated (Lin et al., 
2011) structural basis for activation of PI3K by GIV is displayed. Phosphotyrosines 1764 and 1798 on GIV directly bind 
p85α (SH2-domains) and activate Class 1 PI3Ks. (b) Various GIV-derived IMPs generated and tested in this work; they 
either contain the two short stretches of sequence flanking either tyrosine 1764 or 1798 alone, or together (entire SH2 
module) or in combination with GIV’s GEF module (entire C-Term). Non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine mutants were 
generated in each case to serve as negative controls. These GIV substrates were inserted within the IMP probe shown in 
Fig 1c.  
  
Figure S4. GIV-derived IMP probes are reversibly tyrosine phosphorylated in cells [Related to Figure 1]. (a) 
Immunoblots showing the phosphorylation status of WT IMP-GIV-SH2 and its corresponding YF mutant after EGF 
stimulation. Only WT IMP peptides are phosphorylated but not its corresponding YF mutants. (b) Immunoblots showing the 
phosphorylation status of WT IMP-GIV-CT and their corresponding YF and YF/FA mutants after EGF stimulation. Only WT 
IMP-GIV-CT probe gets phosphorylated but not its corresponding YF mutant (c) Serum-starved Cos7 cells expressing WT 
IMP-GIV-SH2 were stimulated with various growth factors prior to lysis. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP 
mAb and tyrosine phosphorylation of IMP-GIV-SH2 probe was analyzed by immunoblotting (IB). Phosphorylation of the 
peptide was observed in fed state (10% FBS) or when stimulated with EGF or Insulin or PDGF but not in overnight starved 
conditions. (d) Serum-starved Cos7 cells expressing WT IMP-GIV-CT were stimulated with EGF or Insulin prior to lysis. 
Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP mAb and tyrosine phosphorylation of IMP was analyzed by immunoblotting 
(IB). Phosphorylation of the IMP-GIV-CT-WT probe was only observed in cells when stimulated with either EGF or insulin 
but not in starved cells. (e) Lysates of Cos7 cells co-expressing IMP-GIV-SH2 and wild-type (WT) or kinase-dead (KD) Src-
HA were immunoprecipitated and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of IMP as in d. Phosphorylation of the IMP-GIV-
SH2 probe was only observed in cells co-transfected with Src-HA-WT but not in cells transfected with kinase dead Src-HA-
KD cells. (f) Lysates of Cos7 cells expressing IMP-GIVY1798 and wild-type (WT) or Kinase Dead (KD) FAK-HA were 
immunoprecipitated and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of IMP as in d. Phosphorylation of the IMP-GIV-SH2 probe 
was only detected in cells expressing WT-FAK-HA but in kinase dead FAK-HA expressing cells. (g) Lysates of Cos7 cells 
expressing IMP-GIV&1798 and wild-type (WT) or catalytically dead (CD) SHP1-HA were immunoprecipitated and analyzed 
for tyrosine phosphorylation of IMP as in d. Phosphorylation of the IMP-GIVY1798 probe was only detected in cells 
expressing SHP1-HA-CD but in SHP1-HA-WT expressing cells. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure S5. Transient overexpression of IMP 1764 and IMP1798 does not alter 2D cell migration in scratch-wound 
assays [Related to Figure 1]. Sub-confluent (~85-90%) monolayers of HeLa cells transiently transfected with the indicated 
IMP constructs were grown to confluence over 30 h prior to scratch-wounding. Wounds were imaged immediately after 
wounding and again, after 12 and 24 hours by light microscopy. Bar graphs display the % wound closure, as determined by 
tracing the exposed wound area at the beginning and at 24 h using ImageJ was measured. Error bars represent ±SEM; n 
= 4-5 wounds per cell line, per experiment, from 3 independent biological repeat experiments.   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure S6. Sources of various paired cancer cell lines used in the study [Related to Figure 3]. (a) Schematic 
representing the technique that was employed by Massague et al (Nguyen et al., 2009) to generate paired primary and 
Brain metastatic clones. Briefly, 105 of metastatic lung or breast cancer cells isolated from lymphatic duct or pleural effusions 
of cancer patients were injected into arterial circulation of nude mice. Subsequently, tumor cells were isolated from lesions 
formed at secondary site i. e. brain or bone, followed by expansion of the cells and reinjection of the cells into mice circulation 
for two more rounds to select for highly metastatic clones. (b) List of paired (parental and brain mets) lung and breast cancer 
cell lines with variable metastatic proclivity used in the study, their varying genetic background, and known mutations and 
the sources of cells.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
Figure S7. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV is indistinguishable among paired primary and BrM breast and lung 
cancer cells by Immunofluorescence [Related to Figure 3]. PC-9, H2030, MDA-MB-231 primary and their BrM 
counterparts were fixed, stained for tyrosine phosphorylated GIV (pYGIV; red) and DAPI (nucleus; blue) and analyzed by 
confocal microscopy. Representative images of cells are shown. Although cell-to-cell heterogeneity in intensity of staining 
was encountered, no discernable differences in patterns of staining was observed between the parental and BrM clones. 
Bar = 10 µm. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Figure S8. Control experiments that show the specificity of IMP probes to detect meaningful, context-dependent 
signals [Related to Figure 3]. (a-b) Representative steady state FRET images of PC-9 parental and BrM cells expressing 
IMP-Y1764F mutant probe. IMP Y1764F mutant peptide shows no differential FRET signal when expressed in paired cancer 
cell lines; very little FRET was observed in both the parental and BrM PC-9 cell groups at steady state in 10% serum, 
indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of the IMP probe is essential for the differential FRET observed in these cells using 
the WT probe 2e. (b) Scatter plots display the FRET efficiency at the PM in a. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. (c) 
Whole cell lysates from paired PC-9, H2030 and MDA-MB-231 cells were immunoblotted with total phosphorylated tyrosine 
antibody. Full-length phosphotyrosine immunoblot shows no discernable differences in either global tyrosine 
phosphorylation or tyrosine phosphorylation at any given molecular weight between the parental and the BrM clones. 
Results indicate that the differences in FRET in these paired cells observed using the IMP-Y1764 probe in 2d-f does not 
merely reflect global differences in tyrosine phosphorylation. (d-f) Replacement of the GIV substrate sequence with a 
sequence derived from IRS1 abolishes the ability of IMP probes to distinguish cancer cells with high from low metastatic 
potential. (d) Schematic showing the substrate sequence of GIV used in IMP-Y1764 and IMP-Y1798 probes, and the 
sequence of IRS1 that was used to substitute the residues flanking the Y substrate. Previous work has shown that this site 
is phosphorylated by multiple growth factors (EGF, PDGF and Insulin) (Sato et al., 2002) and is a binding site for p85α(PI3K) 
(Yonezawa et al., 1992) and induces FRET when used in similar probe design as IMPs (Sato et al., 2002). (e) Parental and 
brain metastatic (BrM) clones of PC-9 lung cancer cells expressing IMP-Y941 IRS were analyzed for steady-state FRET by 
confocal live-cell imaging. Representative CFP, YFP and FRET images are shown. Boxed area on the left is magnified on 
the right. FRET is frequently observed at the PM in parental, but not in BrM clones. (f) Scatter plots display the FRET 
efficiency at the PM in e. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D.  
 
  
 
 
 
Figure S9. IMP sensors can distinguish between MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, two breast cancer cell lines with 
contrasting metastatic proclivities [Related to Figure 3]. (a) Whole cell lysates of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were 
analyzed for GIV, phospho(p)Akt, total(t)Akt and tubulin by immunoblotting (IB). (b) Immunoprecipitation was carried out 
from lysates of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing IMP-Y1764 with anti-GFP mAb and analyzed for tyrosine 
phosphorylation of IMP by immunoblotting (IB). (c) MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing IMP-Y1764 were analyzed for 
steady-state FRET by confocal live-cell imaging. Representative CFP, YFP and FRET images are shown. Boxed area on 
the left is magnified on the right. (d) Bar graphs display the FRET efficiency (F.E) in c. The cut-off F.E of 0.14 (based on the 
cumulative histograms in Fig 3g) denotes that MCF7 cells with low F.E and MDA-MB-231 cells with high F.E have low and 
high metastatic potentials, respectively. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. 
  
 
Figure S10. IMPY1764 sensor retains its ability to detect metastatic proclivity despite the evolving genetic and 
epigenetic shifts in tumor cells during the course of metastatic progression [Related to Figure 3]. (a) Schematic 
summarizing the characteristics of the 21T series of breast cancer cells. These isogenic cells were derived from the same 
patient (#21) during breast cancer progression (Band et al., 1990) (Fig 3h). The array of evolving epigenetic (Liu et al., 1994; 
Santos et al., 2014; Souter et al., 2010), proteomic (Xu et al., 2010) and signaling (MacMillan et al., 2014; Qiao et al., 2007) 
programs during progressive acquisition of metastatic potential are summarized. (b)  21T cells expressing IMP-Y1764 were 
analyzed for steady-state FRET by confocal live-cell imaging. Representative FRET images are shown as a montage of 
single-cells images. Quantifications are displayed as scatter plots in Fig 3i.

3g is displayed here with the position of various cell lines (mean FRET) studied in this work indicated on the gaussian curve.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
Figure S12. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV at the PM is enhanced during drug resistance [Related to Figure 4]. 
(a) Table lists the paired (sensitive vs resistant) breast (Hs578T) and lung (HCC827) cancer cells used in this study, the 
underlying pathways implicated in the development of drug resistance, the genetic background and the source of cells. (b) 
Docetaxel (DTX)-sensitive and resistant pairs of Hs578T, and Lapatinib/Erlotinib sensitive and resistant pairs of HCC827 
cells were fixed, stained for tyrosine phosphorylated GIV (pYGIV; red) and DAPI (nucleus; blue) and analyzed by confocal 
microscopy. Representative images of cells are shown. Bar = 10 µm. 
 
 
  
SUPPLEMENTARY MOVIE CAPTIONS 
 
SM1. Dynamic changes in FRET at the PM upon EGF stimulation of Cos7 cells expressing the IMP-
pY1764 probe [Related to Figure 2]. Movie shows ligand-dependent signaling via the GIV-PI3K axis as 
visualized through FRET imaging in living Cos7 cells expressing the wild type IMP-Y1764 sensor.  
 
SM2. Loss of dynamic changes in FRET upon EGF stimulation [Related to Figure 2]. Movie shows loss of
