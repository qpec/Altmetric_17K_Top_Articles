Abstract
This study investigated the relationship between education and physical activity and the difference 
between a physiological prediction of age and chronological age. Cortical and subcortical grey 
matter regional volumes were calculated from 331 healthy adults (range: 19-79 years). 
Multivariate analyses identified a covariance pattern of brain volumes best predicting 
chronological age (CA)(R2 = 47%). Individual expression of this brain pattern served as a 
physiologic measure of brain age (BA). The difference between CA and BA was predicted by 
education and self-report measures of physical activity. Education and the daily number of flights 
of stairs climbed were the only two significant predictors of decreased brain age. Effect sizes 
demonstrated that brain age decreased by 0.95 years for each year of education and by 0.58 years 
for one additional daily FOSC. Effects of education and FOSC on regional brain volume were 
largely driven by temporal and subcortical volumes. These results demonstrate that higher levels 
of education and daily FOSC are related to larger brain volume than predicted by chronological 
age which supports the utility of regional grey matter volume as a biomarker of healthy brain 
aging.

1 Introduction
Grey matter volume decline is a highly visible aspect of the chronological aging process 
resulting from neural shrinkage and neuronal loss (Terry et al., 1987). These neural changes 
are detectable with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as volumetric declines in subcortical 
regions and throughout the cortical mantel (Dale et al., 1999; Sowell et al., 2004). Although 
volumetric decline is a common aspect of aging, the rate and degree of decline is highly 
variable across regions of the brain and between individuals (Raz et al., 2010). Furthermore, 
differences in lifetime exposures, such as years of education or physical activity, have been 
associated with differential amounts of grey matter volumetric decline with advancing age 
(Ahlskog et al., 2011; Erickson et al., 2010; Nithianantharajah and Hannan, 2009).
Interindividual variability in genetics and development along with positive and negative 
effects of lifetime exposure will result in different quantities of brain volume loss. Several 
investigators have suggested the concept of physiological brain age where the difference 
between chronological age and predicted age, based on brain measures, serves as a more 
informative marker of brain health than chronological age alone (Franke et al., 2010; Irimia 
et al., 2014). Regional brain volume measures would be useful for calculating a 
physiological brain age measurement.
In this study we used regional measures of grey matter volume from 331 healthy adults 
across the lifespan to derive a biomarker of brain age. We defined the difference between 
chronological age and brain age as a marker of whether the brain is younger or older than 
expected. We then investigated whether this difference was related to lifetime exposures 
including years of education and self-reported assessments of physical activity. Such 
relationships would suggest that certain lifetime exposures help maintain the brain in a more 
“youthful” state.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Participants
Data from 331 healthy adults between the ages of 19 and 79 were included in this study. 
Participants were drawn from three different studies from our laboratory using the same 
testing apparatus, procedures and MRI. Table 1 lists the number of participants by decade, 
sex and study. Participants were recruited using market-mailing procedures from within 10 
miles of our northern Manhattan, New York USA site to equalize the recruitment 
approaches across the lifespan. Participants who responded to the mailing were telephone 
screened to ensure that they met basic inclusion criteria (right handed, English speaking, no 
psychiatric or neurological disorders, normal or corrected-to-normal vision). All participants 
found eligible via the initial telephone screen were further screened in person with structured 
medical, neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychological evaluations to ensure that they 
had no neurological or psychiatric disease or cognitive impairment. The screening procedure

 included a detailed interview that excluded individuals with a self-reported history of major 
or unstable medical illness, significant neurological history (e.g. epilepsy, brain tumor, 
stroke), history of head trauma with loss of consciousness for greater than five minutes or 
history of Axis I psychiatric disorder (Association, 1994). Individuals taking psychotropic 
medications were also excluded. Global cognitive functioning was assessed with the Mattis 
Dementia Rating Scale, on which a score of at least 133 was required for retention in the 
study (Mattis, 1988). This study was approved by the Internal Review Board of the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants prior to study participation, and after the purpose and risks of 
the study were explained. Participants were compensated for their participation in the study.
2.2 Measures of Lifetime Exposures
Lifetime exposures included measures of education and physical activity. Education was 
assessed as the number of years engaged in formal education. Physical activity was assessed 
using a questionnaire containing nine questions about the amount of time spent doing 
various physical activities. These activities included: walking/hiking, jogging, running, 
bicycling, aerobic exercise, lap swimming, tennis/squash/racquetball, low intensity exercise 
and flights of stairs climbed daily (FOSC). The flights of stairs climbed daily was coded as: 
None, 1-2, 3-4, 5-9, 10-14 and more than 15. These values were coded as 0, 1.5, 3.5, 7, 12 
and 16. The other questions referred to the amount of time spent within a week and were 
coded as: None, 1-19 minutes, 20-50 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2-3 hours, 4-6 hours and 
over 7 hours. This questionnaire is similar to that used in other assessments of physical 
activity (Chao et al., 2004; Thacker et al., 2008). For all physical activities these measures 
were converted to Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) (Ainsworth et al., 2000; Bassett et 
al., 1997) and a total MET score was calculated.
2.3 Image Acquisition Procedure
MRI images were acquired in a 3.0T Philips Achieva Magnet using a standard quadrature 
head coil. A T1-weighted scout image was acquired to determine the participant's position. 
One hundred sixty five contiguous 1 mm coronal T1-weighted images of the whole brain 
were acquired for each participant with an MPRAGE sequence using the following 
parameters: TR 6.5 ms, TE 3 ms; flip angle 8°, acquisition matrix 256 × 256 and 240 mm 
field of view. A neuroradiologist reviewed the anatomical scans to identify any potentially 
clinically significant findings.
2.4 FreeSurfer Methods
Each participant's structural T1 scans were reconstructed using FreeSurfer (Fischl, 2012) 
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The accuracy of Freesurfer's subcortical segmentation 
and cortical parcellation (Fischl et al., 2004, 2002) has been reported to be comparable to 
manual labeling. Each participant's white and grey matter boundaries as well as grey matter 
and cerebrospinal fluid boundaries were visually inspected slice by slice by an experienced 
user, manual control points were added in the case of any visible discrepancy, and 
reconstruction was repeated until we reached satisfactory results within every participant. 
The subcortical structure borders were plotted by Freeview visualization tools and compared

 against the actual brain regions. In case of discrepancy, they were corrected manually. In 
total this procedure quantified 84 regions, 16 subcortical and 68 cortical.
2.5 Scaled subprofile modeling
We used the scaled subprofile modeling (SSM) (Moeller et al., 1987; Spetsieris and 
Eidelberg, 2010) approach to calculate physiological brain age (BA) based on regional grey 
matter volumes from cortical and subcortical locations using the principal components 
analysis (PCA) toolbox (http://groups.google.-com/group/gcva) (Habeck et al., 2005; 
Habeck and Stern, 2007). Briefly, the eighty-four grey matter volume regions of interest 
were subjected to a principal component analysis. This produced a series of principal 
component images, vi, and their respective subject scaling factors (SSFi), which are each 
individual's expression of that respective principal component. The number of components 
comprising approximately 95% of the variance of the structural data were retained. 
Predicted Age (pAge) was calculated by regressing the SSF's taken from this subset of 
principal components against chronological age (CA) controlling for total intracranial 
volume, study (which of the studies they were recruited for) and sex:
Both sex and study were dummy-coded, with female and study 1 as the references. The 
weights from the SSF variables were used to combine the respective eigenimages, vi, to 
produce an age-related brain covariance pattern. This was then projected back into the 
original data to calculate the expression of this pattern for each participant. This value 
served as the Brain Age (BA) measure. The stability of the regions within the resultant 
pattern was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap resamples and tested with bias-corrected, 
accelerated confidence intervals.
For each individual, CA-BA indicated whether their brain age was older or younger than 
their chronological age. Positive values indicate their brain age was younger than their 
chronological age would predict, while a negative value indicates the brain age is older than 
their chronological age. We then tested whether the measures of education and physical 
activity were related to this difference.
Similar to assessing regional contributions to the BA map, regional contributions to the CA-
BA relationship with education and physical activity were also calculated. The stability of 
the regions was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap resamples and tested with bias-corrected, 
accelerated confidence intervals. Regions were identified as being significantly related to the 
lifetime exposure measures if they had a Z score magnitude greater than 2 and had effect 
sizes greater than 1/84 of the total effect. An effect size of 1/84 of the total effect for each 
brain region signifies that each brain region is contributing equally to the overall covariance 
pattern and there is no regional concentration of the effect.

 3 Results
3.1 Global Results
The first thirty-eight principal components comprised 95% of the total variance in the 
regional grey matter volume structural data. In total 64% of chronological age related 
variance was accounted for, 47% by the individual expression of the covariance pattern and 
an additional 17% by the nuisance regressors of total intracranial volume, study and sex. 
Statistics for the nuisance regressors were: Total intracranial volume (B = 58.7, t(324) = 
5.52, p < 0.001), sex (B = 9.81, t(324) = 6.89, p < 0.001) and study (R2 = 0.007, F(3,324) = 
2.10, p = 0.10). Study was dummy coded according to which study the participant was part 
of or whether they were part of two studies, see Table 1. A scatter plot of chronological age 
versus brain age is shown in Figure 1.
Education and MET scores for each of the nine physical activities were regressed against the 
difference between chronological age and brain age (CA - BA). The overall F-test was 
significant for this model (F(10, 320) = 2.14, p = 0.021). CA-BA was significantly related to 
education (B = 0.95, t(320) = 2.84, p = 0.0048) and FOSC (B = 0.58, t(320) = 2.84, p = 
0.0048). All other measures were non-significant: walking/hiking (B = 0.041, t(320) = 0.40, 
p = 0.69), jogging (B = 0.16, t(320) = 1.32, p = 0.19), running (B = -0.042, t(320) = -0.36, p 
= 0.72), bicycling (B = 0.055, t(320) = 0.56, p = 0.57), aerobic exercise (B = -0.063, t(320) = 
-0.82, p = 0.41), lap swimming (B = -0.072, t(320) = -0.55, p = 0.58), tennis/squash/
racquetball (B = 0.004, t(320) = 0.027, p = 0.98) and low intensity exercise (B = -0.031, 
t(320) = -0.13, p = 0.90). The combined effect of one additional year of education combined 
with one additional flight of stairs climbed per day was related to a 1.53 year younger brain 
than chronological age would predict.
The non-significant regressors were removed and the regression analysis redone. The overall 
F-test was still significant for this model (F(2, 328) = 9.45, p < 0.001). CA-BA was 
significantly related to education (B = 0.99, t(328) = 3.014, p = 0.0028) and FOSC (B = 
0.60, t(328) = 3.06, p = 0.0024). The reduction in variance accounted for was not significant 
(difference in R2 = 0.0083, F(8, 320) = 0.36, p = 0.94).
The correlation table between the nine physical activity measures and age is shown in Table 
2. With increasing age there is a decrease in the amount of time engaged in jogging, running 
and aerobic exercise. Also included in Table 2 is the proportion of participants engaged in 
each activity after a median split (age 52) into young and old adults. This reiterates the age 
effect on the activities, but it also demonstrates that walking and stair climbing are activities 
engaged in by the vast majority of participants regardless of age. The significant 
relationships between FOSC and BA-CA demonstrate a dose effect of stair climbing.
3.2 Regional Results

 For FOSC, the effects were observed in the right amygdala, right accumbens, right rostral 
middle frontal gyrus, bilateral caudal anterior cingulate, right rostral anterior and posterior 
cingulate, left precuneus, right paracentral gyrus, right inferior and transverse temporal 
gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and the right insula.
4 Discussion
Brain aging can be conceptualized as comprising two mechanisms, the inevitable and 
universal effects of advancing age and the effects resulting from a lifetime of exposures. 
Lifetime exposures comprise both negative effects related to unhealthy lifestyle and injuries 
and positive effects resulting from a healthy lifestyle and enriched environments. The 
culmination of a lifetime of genetic, developmental and lifetime exposures produces large 
variation in the physiological age of our brains. Having a physiological measurement of the 
age of the brain provides a means for assessing the effect of a lifetime of exposures on the 
brain. Not only does the CA-BA measure provide a more individualistic assessment, it could 
also provide a means of identifying exposures associated with maintenance of a more 
youthful brain in late life.
The current work used grey matter regional brain volumes as measures to compute a 
physiological age, (i.e. brain age). This approach may be generalized to include other brain-
based measures (e.g. white matter volumes, white matter hyperintensity burden, amyloid 
buildup) as well as non-brain based measures such as blood-based markers (e.g., complete 
blood count (CBC) panels). Inclusion of additional measures would provide a more global 
estimation of physiological age and will likely account for a larger amount of the variance in 
chronological age.
The results of this study suggest that individual levels of education and FOSC have a 
positive effect on the brain. Increased values on either of these lifetime exposure measures 
were associated with significant increases in the CA-BA measure. Maintaining the structure 
of the brain in a younger state may have profound effects on delaying the onset of age-
related neurodegenerative diseases.
Education and FOSC are associated with larger brain volume than predicted by 
chronological age supporting the idea of brain maintenance (Nyberg et al., 2012). Brain 
maintenance describes the preservation of brain measures (including cellular, 
neurochemical, volumetric and systems-level activation patterns) in the face of advancing 
age and is argued to be a primary indicator of successful cognitive aging. Therefore, higher 
levels of education and FOSC daily are related to larger regional brain volumes, with respect 
to others with lower education and FOSC. Thus suggesting that education and FOSC lead to 
the maintenance of brain volumes at a more youthful state.
It is important to stress that the current data are from a cross-sectional study; therefore, 
causality cannot be tested. The theoretical framework underlying the present study is based 
on literature showing that certain lifetime exposures, such as education and physical activity, 
have a positive effect on the aging brain. The findings from the present study support this 
theory. However, it is also possible that larger brain volumes may predispose individuals to 
obtain greater levels of education and to seek out physical activity. Longitudinal and

 intervention studies may address the causal nature of the current findings and tease apart the 
concepts of predisposition and maintenance. For instance, brain age, calculated using 
measurements obtained early in life, compared to lifetime educational attainment and levels 
of physical activity, obtained later in life, could be used to address the question of 
predisposition. A natural experiment comparing brain age measures at the start of adulthood 
to brain age measures calculated after completion of educational attainment, would be useful 
in understanding whether educational attainment altered brain age. This would test the 
theory that education contributes to brain maintenance. Likewise, an intervention study over 
a shorter time scale, using a physical activity protocol, could identify whether or not the 
intervention altered the rate of brain age decline, helping to further our understanding of 
brain maintenance.
The pattern of brain regions showing a relationship with lifetime exposures is similar to the 
pattern of brain regions demonstrating the most substantial age-related declines (Raz et al., 
1997). This suggests that these brain regions, in particular the temporal cortex, are more 
sensitive to the effects of aging, but also sensitive to the lifetime exposures which may 
counteract some of the aging effects. The temporal cortex had significantly large 
contributions to the education and FOSC related increases in the CA-BA measure. A 
previous aerobic walking study with older adults showed that increased functional 
connectivity was found within the temporal gyri and was associated with increased levels of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Voss et al., 2012). Atrophy within these regions has also 
been implicated as an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease (Convit et al., 2000). Exercise is 
noted to moderate the amount of age-related atrophy within the temporal gyri (Bugg and 
Head, 2011). The volume of these regions also mediate age-related cognitive performance 
on memory strategies (Kirchhoff et al., 2014). Furthermore, greater walking distance 
predicted greater amounts of grey matter volume in regions of the occipital, temporal and 
frontal lobes (Erickson et al., 2010).
Identification of biomarkers of healthy normal aging is an important step in understanding 
neurodegenerative decline (Jack et al., 2010). Using biomarkers of healthy aging could 
provide a measurement scale to identify deviation from normal. Their use may be 
particularly informative with respect to intervention studies. A biomarker of healthy aging 
could also provide a metric for identifying the effects of intervention programs.
Years of education and daily number of flights of stairs climbed are both straightforward 
measures. The ease of collecting these measurements is to their advantage; however, they 
also each have drawbacks. Years of education does not assess quality of education (Manly et 
al., 2002). It also does not include age of acquisition of education. While a large bolus of 
education is typically acquired early in life, the acquisition of higher education is not 
mandated to the young. Individuals that acquire 16 continuous years of education may differ 
from those that acquired their higher education later in life. Unfortunately, our measure does 
not make such distinctions.
The number of flights of stairs climbed daily represents a proxy of a type of physical activity 
that has been used as a health-related fitness tool (Kennedy et al., 2007). These authors 
demonstrate that stair climbing enhances cardiovascular fitness. Stair climbing as an

 exercise also meets the minimum requirements for cardiorespiratory benefits and serves as a 
viable exercise, suitable for promoting physical activity (Teh and Aziz, 2002). In 
assessments of the validity of stair climbing, it was shown to not be significantly related to 
VO2 max assessed using a treadmill test in 138 participants (Resnicow et al., 2003). In 
another study of 76 post-menopausal, sedentary women using the P-PAQ, sweat index was a 
better marker of measured kilocalories of energy expenditure than stair climbing (Laporte et 
al., 1983). The greatest support for the FOSC measure comes from the Harvard Alumni 
Health Study. This study demonstrated that in 13,485 participants, the number of flights of 
stairs climbed and distance walked independently and significantly were related to decreased 
mortality rates by up to 25 percent. Physical activity at light, moderate or vigorous levels 
had no significant effects (Lee and Paffenbarger, 2000). Despite the validity of stair 
climbing as a physical activity, we measured it as a self-report which is inherently 
problematic (Prince et al., 2008). Despite this limitation, the other measures of physical 
activity were also self-report and were not significantly related to our difference between 
chronological age and brain age.
The assessment of flights of stairs climbed is an item from the Paffenbarger Physical 
Activity Questionnaire (P-PAQ) (Paffenbarger et al., 1993). Overall this is reliable and valid 
assessment of physical activity; however, there is limited evidence comparing the self-
reported number of flights of stairs climbed against measured flights climbed. Future 
research will need to validate self reported stair climbing against actual measurements, when 
accuracy of pedometers increases for free-living conditions (De Cocker et al., 2012; Zhu and 
Lee, 2010).
Our results demonstrate that years of education and stair climbing, not other measures of 
physical activity, were related to the difference between chronological age and brain age. 
This raises the question of what makes stair climbing different from other forms of physical 
activity in its relationship with brain health. One difference between stair climbing and other 
activities may be motivational. Many physical activities, e.g. running or swimming, are done 
out of personal desire. Climbing a flight of stairs may also be motivated from personal 
desire, e.g. for health reasons, and may be considered engagement in optional physical 
activity. On the other hand, climbing the stairs may be a physical activity engaged in out of 
necessity. In our cohorts, climbing stairs may reflect housing or transportation situations. 
The cohorts for this study were recruited from northern Manhattan, with a predominance of 
apartment buildings, and residential northern New Jersey, with a predominance of single 
family homes. Someone may live in a multi-level home and going up and down stairs is 
simply a fact of daily life. Someone may also live in a multi-level apartment building, with 
no elevator, where again climbing flights of stairs is a fact of daily life. Public transportation 
in this region often involves ascending and descending flights of stairs to reach train 
platforms. A potentially complicating factor is that differences in housing may represent 
socio-economic differences. In an observational study, pedestrians in higher socio-economic 
regions had a significantly higher rate of optionally taking the stairs than pedestrians in 
lower socio-economic regions (Ryan et al., 2011).
The nature of stair climbing also differs from many other forms of physical activity. 
Climbing stairs is often done repeatedly throughout the day, on most if not all days of the

 week, and represents small bouts of moderately intense physical activity. Engagement of the 
other activities we assessed typically occur less frequently throughout a typical week and for 
longer durations. Future work with measures of stair-climbing will attempt to tease apart the 
motivation and socio-economical differences behind taking the stairs. This will be useful in 
determining which aspect has the greatest impact on brain age.
Stair-climbing is also used as a marker of mobility. In a large sample of older adults, 
education was significantly related to stair-climbing (Sainio et al., 2007). The authors 
discussed that the pathway of this effect appeared to be common chronic diseases, such as 
smoking and obesity. The lower educated participants had greater levels of these common 
diseases which limited their stair climbing ability. In our sample there was no significant 
relationship between education and FOSC (r = 0.02), likely due to our eligibility screening.
Even with the limitations of the education and FOSC measures, they are both significantly 
related to the difference between chronological and biological age. Future work will 
improve the quantification of education and physical activity to more deeply probe the roles 
of these lifetime exposures, as well as exploring dosage effects of education and physical 
activity (Erickson et al., 2010).
Interestingly, engagement differs across the various physical activities. There are also 
correlations between the various measures and age. The more vigorous activities have lower 
numbers of participants engaging in them with advancing age. However, energy expenditure 
due to FOSC is unrelated to age. Engagement in FOSC, regardless of duration, is also 
unaffected by age. Therefore, FOSC is a physical activity that is engaged in by a majority of 
adults. Current results suggest there may be a dose response with respect to estimated brain 
age. Many people are already climbing the stairs at least once per day, our results suggest 
that climbing more flights of stairs per day may offer even greater benefit. This is 
encouraging because it demonstrates that FOSC has great potential as an intervention tool to 
promote brain health. There already exist many “Take the stairs” campaigns in office 
environments and public transportation centers. The current results demonstrate that these 
campaigns should also be expanded for older adults.
Prediction of chronological age using physiological measurements is gaining interest and is 
demonstrating its usefulness in the literature. Currently, there are multiple methods of 
deriving a brain age estimate which are applicable for identifying differential rates of aging 
(Bunge and Whitaker, 2012; Franke et al., 2010; Wachinger et al., 2015), tracking recovery 
from traumatic brain injuries (Cole et al., 2015) and in measuring brain development in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (Aubert-Broche et al., 2014). When predicting chronological 
age, other methods have explained more variance in their data then in the methods employed 
in this work (Cole et al., 2015; Franke et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014). This is likely due to 
the voxel/vertex wise nature of their approaches employing hundreds of thousands of brain 
measurements per participant. These techniques are quite powerful; however, they suffer 
from high sensitivity to accurate registrations between data and templates and processing 
steps. Franke et al. (2010) discuss and demonstrate the sensitivity of their measure to 
preprocessing choices (Franke et al., 2010).

 The current approach used 84 brain measurements per participant using FreeSurfer 
extraction of regional volumes. This attempts to circumvent error due to preprocessing 
sensitivity using a robust extraction method that preserves the data in the original native 
collected space without excessive transformations. The current work also used the scaled 
subprofile modeling approach (Moeller et al., 1987). This method is straightforward and 
well established in the imaging field with demonstrated reproducibility (Moeller et al., 
1999). Derived covariance patterns, like those produced here, can serve as biomarkers of the 
healthy aging brain and may be forward applied to new datasets (Brickman et al., 2008). 
This is in common with the other described brain age calculations.
Using 95% of the variance in the brain data, this approach accounted for 47% of the 
variance in chronological age. While other methods may account for larger amounts of 
variance in their data, our preference was to minimize sensitivity to processing choices and 
to use established methods from the literature. It is also anticipated that the greatest increase 
in variance accounted for in chronological age will come from the combination of multiple 
physiological measurements.
5 Conclusions
Differences between chronological and brain age were significantly related to years of 
education and the daily number of flights of stairs climbed. These results support the idea 
that more education and climbing a greater number of stairs are healthy lifestyle habits as 
reflected by regional brain volumes being larger than expected by chronological age. The 
identified full brain pattern of brain age also provides a biomarker which may be useful for 
predicting whether brain age is consistent or inconsistent with chronological age.

 Highlights
•
Four years of education is related to reduced predicted age of the brain by nearly 
four years.
•
One additional flight of stairs climbed per day is related to a decreased predicted 
brain age by 7 months.
•
Education and physical activity appear to help maintain the brain at a more 
youthful state.
