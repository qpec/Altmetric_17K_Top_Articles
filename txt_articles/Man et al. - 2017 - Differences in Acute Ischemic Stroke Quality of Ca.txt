T
o improve stroke care, the Brain Attack Coalition recom-
mended that Primary Stroke Centers (PSC) capable of 
meeting certain standards and providing evidence-based care 
for stroke be established and that they preferentially provide 
care for stroke patients.1 The Joint Commission (JC) began 
certifying PSCs in 2003. Other national organizations, includ-
ing Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP) and 
Det Norske Veritas (DNV), started providing PSC certifica-
tion later. Several states also passed legislation to designate 
hospitals as PSCs. The basic standards for providing PSC 
certification are similar for each organization providing PSC 
certification; yet, there may be important differences in how 
these standards are assessed and applied. For example, the 
JC requires extensive documentation that standards are met, 
including in-person site visits, whereas other organizations do 
not require site visits or even allow hospitals to self-designate.
Current evidence suggests that certified stroke centers pro-
vide higher quality of care and better outcomes than hospi-
tals that are not PSC certified.2,3 However, whether there are 
differences in care quality and outcomes among PSCs cer-
tified by different organizations has not been studied. The 
majority of PSCs participate in the Get With The Guidelines 
Background and Purpose—Primary stroke center (PSC) certification was established to identify hospitals providing 
evidence-based care for stroke patients. The numbers of PSCs certified by Joint Commission (JC), Healthcare Facilities 
Accreditation Program, Det Norske Veritas, and State-based agencies have significantly increased in the past decade. This 
study aimed to evaluate whether PSCs certified by different organizations have similar quality of care and in-hospital 
outcomes.
Methods—The study population consisted of acute ischemic stroke patients who were admitted to PSCs participating in Get 
With The Guidelines-Stroke between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Measures of care quality and outcomes 
were compared among the 4 different PSC certifications.
Results—A total of 477 297 acute ischemic stroke admissions were identified from 977 certified PSCs (73.8% JC, 3.7% Det 
Norske Veritas, 1.2% Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, and 21.3% State-based). Composite care quality was 
generally similar among the 4 groups of hospitals, although State-based PSCs underperformed JC PSCs in a few key 
measures, including intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator use. The rates of tissue-type plasminogen activator 
use were higher in JC and Det Norske Veritas (9.0% and 9.8%) and lower in State and Healthcare Facilities Accreditation 
Program certified hospitals (7.1% and 5.9%) (P<0.0001). Door-to-needle times were significantly longer in Healthcare 
Facilities Accreditation Program hospitals. State PSCs had higher in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality (odds ratio 1.23, 
95% confidence intervals 1.07–1.41) compared with JC PSCs.
Conclusions—Among Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals with PSC certification, acute ischemic stroke quality of 
care and outcomes may differ according to which organization provided certification. These findings may have important 
implications 
for 
further 
improving 
systems 
of 
care.

(GWTG)-Stroke program, which collects prospective data for 
evidence-based, guideline-directed process measures, safety 
measures, efficacy measures, and in-hospital outcomes, pro-
viding an opportunity to compare performance as a function 
of which organization provided PSCs certification.4,5
Methods
GWTG-Stroke is an ongoing voluntary Web-based registry and per-
formance improvement initiative that collects patient-level data on 
characteristics, diagnostic testing, treatments, adherence to quality 
measures, and in-hospital outcomes in patients hospitalized with 
stroke. Details of the design and conduct of the GWTG-Stroke pro-
gram have been previously described.4,6 The GWTG-Stroke pro-
gram was made available in April 2003 to any hospital in the United 
States.4,6 Trained hospital personnel are instructed to ascertain 
consecutive patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke by either 
prospective clinical identification, retrospective identification using 
International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision discharge 
codes, or a combination.4,6 The eligibility of each acute ischemic 
stroke admission was confirmed through chart review by trained hos-
pital personnel. Additional descriptions of the case ascertainment, 
data collection, and quality auditing methods have been previously 
published.4,6,7 Each participating hospital received either human 
research approval to enroll cases without individual patient consent 
under the common rule or a waiver of authorization and exemption 
from subsequent review by their institutional review board. The Duke 
Clinical Research Institute serves as the data analysis center and has 
an agreement to analyze the aggregate deidentified data for research 
purposes.
Patient Population
The study population consisted of patients who were admitted to PSCs 
that participated in the GWTG-Stroke program between January 1, 
2010, and December 31, 2012, with a final diagnosis of acute isch-
emic stroke. During the study period, there were 4791 acute care hos-
pitals in the United States. Among them, 1356 hospitals were certified 
as PSCs and 977 (72.1%) were participating in the GWTG-Stroke 
program. Patients without ischemic stroke diagnosis (n=1 086 119) 
and discharge status missing or left against medical advice (n=5580) 
were excluded. We excluded 88 369 transfer-in cases. The final study 
population consisted of 477 297 ischemic stroke hospitalizations, 
≈50% of all ischemic stroke hospitalization in the United States dur-
ing the study period.
Hospital Classification
The hospitals that were listed as having maintained or obtained the 
PSC certification by JC, HFAP, and DNV during the study period 
were publicly available online at http://www.qualitycheck.org, http://
www.hfap.org, and http://dnvglhealthcare.com. The list of PSCs cer-
tified by state agencies was obtained from the state health department 
websites. The policies of each organization and state for PSC certi-
fication are detailed in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement.

PSCs certified by both JC and state were counted as JC PSCs in this 
study (158 sites). PSCs certified by both DNV and state certification 
were counted as DNV PSC (12 sites). PSCs certified by both JC and 
DNV were counted as JC PSC (2 sites). Hospitals in New Jersey that 
were classified as state Comprehensive Stroke Centers and not oth-
erwise certified by JC/DNV/HFAP were included as State PSCs (10 
sites). There were 3 Texas state–certified PSCs that required another 
certification, which we were unable to identify and, thus, could 
not be accurately assigned to a PSC category were excluded from 
this analysis. Twenty-three PSCs had <25 patients during the study 
period. Among them, 12 were JC PSCs, 1 were DNV PSC, and 10 
were state-certified PSCs. Data on hospital characteristics (ie, bed 
size, academic status, and geographical region) were obtained from 
the American Hospital Association database.
Stroke Measure Definitions
The GWTG-Stroke program developed a set of process-based per-
formance measures to quantify the quality of care for acute isch-
emic stroke patients. In 2007, the American Heart Association/
American Stroke Association came to an agreement with The JC’s 
PSC certification program and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention Coverdell Registry to jointly release a set of standardized 
stroke performance measures.4,8 These performance measures have 
been endorsed by the National Quality Forum, and the detailed mea-
sure specifications were previously published.4,8 The 7 performance 
measures that were selected as primary targets for stroke quality 
improvement efforts in GWTG-Stroke are as follows4–6: intravenous 
tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV tPA) treated within 3 hours in 
patients who arrive within 2 hours after symptom onset, antithrom-
botic medication within 48 hours of admission, deep vein throm-
bosis prophylaxis within 48 hours of admission for nonambulatory 
patients, discharge use of antithrombotic medication, discharge use 
of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, treatment for low-density 
lipoprotein ≥100 mg/dL in patients meeting National Cholesterol 
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and coun-
seling or medication for smoking cessation. Two different measures 
were used to summarize the overall conformity with acute and dis-
charge performance measures for each hospital. An all-or-none mea-
sure of care (also termed defect-free care) was used, which is defined 
as the proportion of patients who received all of the 7 performance 
measure interventions for which they were eligible. A composite 
measure of care, defined as the total number of 7 performance mea-
sure interventions performed among eligible patients divided by the 
total number of possible performance measure interventions among 
eligible patients, was also calculated.4–6
An additional 8 measures, referred to as GWTG-Stroke quality 
or reporting measures by the program, were also used to compare 
the processes of care provided to patients, as previously described.4,5 
These additional measures were intravenous tPA treated within 4.5 
hours in patients who arrive within 3.5 hours after symptom onset, 
door-to-brain imaging time ≤25 minutes, door-to-needle (DTN) time 
≤60 minutes, documented National Institutes of Health Stroke Score, 
door-to-arrival time, DTN time, annual volume of IV tPA, and the 
rate of ischemic stroke patients treated with IV tPA. Summary and 
defect-free composite measures were also analyzed.4,5 The in-hospital 
outcome measures used in this study were mortality, length of stay, 
independent ambulatory status at discharge, and discharge home rate.
Statistical Analysis
The patient characteristics, hospital characteristics, and measures of 
care for acute ischemic stroke were compared among the 4 PSC cer-
tification mechanisms: JC, DNV, HFAP, and state-based. Differences 
in these characteristics were compared using Pearson χ2 tests for 
categorical row variables and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests for con-
tinuous row variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were 
performed to examine the relationship between PSC certification 
mechanism and quality measures or outcomes of interest using JC 
PSC as the reference group. Unadjusted and adjusted models using 
generalized estimating equations to account for in-hospital cluster-
ing were created for each binary outcome. The adjusted model con-
trolled for potential confounders: age, sex, race, medical history of 
atrial fibrillation/flutter, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, 
coronary artery disease/prior myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis, 
diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, dyslipid-
emia, smoking, heart failure, arrival by emergency medical service, 
arrival during off hours (versus regular hours), National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale score, hospital type, geographic region, number 
of beds, annual ischemic stroke volume, and rural location. Multiple 
imputation was used to handle missing data in the models. Hospital 
characteristics were not imputed. The collinearity between all covari-
ates in the models were assessed using variance inflation factors; all 
variance inflation factors were <5, indicating collinearity was not a 
problem in the models. A sensitivity analysis was performed where 
the PSCs certified by >1 organizations were excluded. An additional 
sensitivity analysis was performed where hospitals with <25 patients 
during the study period were excluded. We further analyzed process 
measures and outcomes for those states with ≥5 state-certified PSCs. 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 soft-
ware (SAS Institute). All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, with P<0.05 
considered statistically significant.
Results
This study included 477 297 acute ischemic stroke admissions 
from 977 certified PSCs. Among them, 78.3% were treated at 
JC PSCs (n=721), 16.7% were treated at State PSCs (n=208),

4.0% were treated at DNV PSCs (n=36), and 1.0% were 
treated at HFAP PSCs (n=12). The 977 PSCs included in this 
study represented 72.1% of all US PSC–certified hospitals in 
2012 (n=1356). The 977 PSC-certified hospitals included in 
this study represented 69.5% of all JC PSCs (n=1038), 79.7% 
of all State PSCs (n=261), 83.7% of all DNV PSCs (n=43), 
and 85.7% of all HFAP PSCs (n=14).
Patient characteristics are provided in Table 1. The patients 
who were treated in the 4 groups of PSCs showed little differ-
ences in their demographic characteristics or comorbidities. 
There were moderate differences observed in race/ethnicity 
distribution. Hospital characteristics did show some marked 
differences among the 4 PSC groups (Table 2). State-based 
PSCs were smaller (fewer beds) than PSCs certified by the 
other 3 organizations. The annual stroke volume was higher 
in DNV and JC PSCs and lower in HFAP and State PSCs 
(Median 276, 233, 175, and 173, respectively).
We examined the performance, quality, and outcomes mea-
sures among the 4 PSC groups (Table 3). Overall, all the hos-
pitals had high conformity with the 7 performance measure. 
HFAP programs had modestly lower defect-free care perfor-
mance conformity than the other 3 mechanisms (88.5% versus 
91.5%, 91.1%, 90.9%, respectively, P<0.0001). There were 
significant differences in several process measures among

groups, especially in IV tPA use and timing (Figure). DNV 
PSCs had much higher annual IV tPA volume, followed by JC 
PSC, State PSC, and HFAP PSC (median 22, 18, 12, and 8, 
respectively; P<0.0001). The rate of IV tPA utilization among 
all ischemic stroke admissions was highest at DNV PSCs, fol-
lowed by JC PSCs, State PSCs, and HFAP PSCs (9.8%, 9.0%, 
7.1%, and 5.9% respectively, P<0.0001; Table 3).
For patients who arrived by 2 hours of stroke onset with-
out IV tPA contraindications, more patients at DNV PSCs 
received IV tPA within the 3-hour time window, followed by 
JC PSC, State PSCs, and HFAP PSCs (90.1%, 85.6%, 82.2%, 
and 76.5%, respectively). Similarly, a greater percentage of 
patients who arrived by 3.5 hours of stroke onset received IV 
tPA by 4.5 hours at DNV PSCs, followed by JC PSCs, State 
PSCs, and HFAP PSCs (75.8%, 68.9%, 62.4%, and 53.1% 
respectively). The percentages of patients received IV tPA 
with DTN times within 60 minutes were higher in DNV, JC, 
and State PSCs than in HFAP PSCs (36.6%, 35.9% 35.5%, 
and 16.8%, respectively; Table 3). Analyses of stroke care 
process measures for those states with ≥5 state-certified PSCs 
reveal important differences in performance between states 
(Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to 
examine the association between the type of PSC certification 
and conformity with specific quality measures and patient-cen-
tered outcomes, using JC PSC as the reference group (Table 4). 
After adjustment of patient and other hospital characteristics, 
conformity to defect-free performance measure was compa-
rable. However, the type of PSC certifying organization was 
independently associated with some individual quality mea-
sures. Patients with ischemic stroke were less likely to receive 
IV tPA at State PSCs (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 0.68–0.86). Patients who arrived by 3.5 
hours were less likely to receive IV tPA within 4.5 hours at 
State PSCs in both unadjusted and adjusted model (Table 4). 
Compared with JC PSCs, HFAP PSCs had a lower IV tPA rate 
in the unadjusted model but not in the adjusted model. HFAP 
PSCs were less likely to achieve DTN time of ≤60 minutes in 
both unadjusted (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29–0.74) and adjusted 
model (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31–0.77). DNV PSCs did not dif-
fer from JC PSCs in most measures in the regression analysis. 
Patients at DNV PSCs were more likely to start antithrombot-
ics early in both unadjusted and adjusted models.
The in-hospital outcome measures also showed some dif-
ferences (Table 3). Prior to risk adjustment, HFAP PSCs had 
lower unadjusted in-hospital mortality, followed by JC PSCs, 
DNV PSCs, and State PSCs (P<0.0001). After adjustment, 
HFAP PSCs had lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.66, 95% 
CI 0.47–0.92), whereas State PSCs had higher in-hospital 
mortality (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07–1.41) compared with JC 
PSCs (Table 4). More patients at HFAP PSCs gained inde-
pendence at discharge, followed by DNV PSCs, JC PSCs, and 
State PSCs (Table 3). Analysis among state-certified PSCs 
also reveal differences in outcomes between states (Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
The sensitivity analysis where the PSCs certified by >1 orga-
nizations were excluded generated similar finding (Table III in 
the online-only Data Supplement) as did a sensitivity analysis 
where PSCs with <25 patients were excluded (data not shown).
Discussion
PSC certification was established to provide the best evidence-
based care to stroke patients from acute stroke care to second-
ary prevention, rehabilitation, and return to community. Our 
study suggests that PSC certified by different certification 
bodies differed in performance and outcome. PSCs certified 
by JC and DNV, in general, showed comparable adjusted per-
formance and outcome measures. But PSCs certified by state-
based agencies as a group underperformed JC sites in some 
key measures. State-based PSCs had significantly lower rate 
of IV tPA utilization and less likely to reach DTN time of ≤60 
minutes. Patients who arrived at State PSCs within the eligible 
time window from symptom onset had a lower probability of 
receiving tPA than those at JC PSCs. State PSCs had higher 
in-hospital mortality and lower chance of independence at dis-
charge. While state-based certified PSCs overall showed lower 
performance on many measures, when analyzed by individual 
states, certain State PSCs did have performance that matched 
or exceeded that of other certifying bodies. These findings 
may have important implications for stroke or other systems 
of care continue to evolve, with potential opportunities to cre-
ate more uniform and rigorous standards for PSC certification.

 418  Stroke  February 2017
Intravenous tPA has been proven to improve the outcome of 
acute ischemic stroke.9,10 Earlier thrombolytic treatment was 
associated with reduced mortality and symptomatic intracra-
nial hemorrhage and higher rates of independent ambulation at 
discharge and discharge to home after acute ischemic stroke.11 
This study suggests that there is opportunity for State PSCs 
and certification bodies to improve the identification of hos-
pitals that are more effectively delivering acute stroke diagno-
sis and thrombolytic therapy. For example, HFAP PSCs had 
lower IV tPA utilization and less likely to achieve DTN time 
within 60 minutes. Further analysis of PSCs certified by differ-
ent states are needed given the disparities in several key mea-
sures among different states. This information may be useful 
because those organizations that certify PSCs examine ways 
to improve stroke care processes and standards being assessed.
The present study finds that PSCs certified by state agencies 
had higher in-hospital mortality, while HPAP PSCs had lower 
in-hospital mortality. The reasons for these differences in mor-
tality are not clear. The hospital quality of care and preventing 
and managing complications may impact in-hospital mortal-
ity. Differences in use of comfort care, transfer patterns, dis-
charge policy, and geographic location may be confounding 
these findings.12,13 It is unlikely that lower IV tPA use or longer 
DTN times in HFAP PSCs is contributing to these observa-
tions given that State PSCs also had lower tPA use and longer 
DTN times, but higher mortality. It is also possible that preex-
isting quality of care may lead hospitals to seek certification 
from certain organizations. Further study is needed to identify 
the potential contributing factors along with devising effective 
approaches to improve stroke mortality.
There are important differences in how stroke care is orga-
nized in different countries and healthcare delivery systems. 
We note that the average stroke volume in US PSCs is lower 
than that reported by some Canadian and European regional 
stroke centers.14 Although the population density in Europe 
is much higher than that in the United States, there may be 
important opportunities to further regionalize acute ischemic 
stroke care among higher performing PSCs. Some European 
stroke centers have also reported higher overall IV tPA rates 
than that reported in the present study of PSCs in the United 
States.15 This may reflect differences in systems of care and 
geographic differences that contributes to variances in trans-
portation times and percentages of patients arriving within IV 
tPA eligible time window.
There are important limitations to this study. Data on 
patient characteristics and quality measures were self-
reported by participating hospitals without external valida-
tion. However, prior quality audits of GWTG-Stroke data 
show high concordance rates with source documentation.7 
PSCs that did not participate in GWTG-Stroke program were 
not included in this study (estimated to be 30% of PSCs in 
2012). There may be unmeasured confounders that influ-
ence which organization a hospital chose for its type of 
PSC certification program, and these may contribute to the 
measured stroke care quality. Because GWTG-Stroke par-
ticipation may directly impact stroke care quality and out-
comes, there may have been more limited ability to identify 
differences among the 4 groups of PSC-certified hospitals. 
The sample might be underpowered to show differences in 
individual measures because of the small number of DNV 
and HFAP PSCs. We did not analyze Comprehensive Stroke 
Centers or whether longer duration of PSC certification was 
associated with differences in quality measure conformity 
or outcomes. Residual measured and unmeasured confound-
ing may influence the results of the multivariable analyses. It 
was not possible to account for stroke severity in all patients 
because the National Institutes of Health Stroke Score is not 
documented for all patients in the database, and so National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Score inclusion in the sensitiv-
ity analyses may have introduced selection bias. Although 
in-hospital mortality is an important outcome measure, and 
we adjusted for comorbid conditions and other risk factors, 
it can be influenced by stroke severity, transfer out policies, 
length of stay, and other unmeasured confounding factors. 
Other measures to assess care quality were not collected in 
this study, including other process measures, functional out-
comes, procedure complications, health status, patient satis-
faction, and post discharge outcomes, such as mortality and 
preventable readmissions. Additional studies should be per-
formed to access the relationship between which organiza-
tions provide PSC certification and these additional quality 
measures and outcomes.

Conclusions
In summary, using GTWG-Stroke data, this study showed 
some differences in quality measures and in-hospital outcomes 
among hospitals that received PSC certifications depending 
on which organization provided certification. PSCs certified 
by the state and HFAP had lower IV tPA utilization rate, and 
HFAP PSCs were less likely to achieve DTN times within 60 
minutes. State agency–certified PSC hospitals had higher risk-
adjusted in-hospital mortality rates and HFAP lower mortality 
rates. These findings have important implications for the PSC 
certification process and optimizing stroke, and potentially 
other, systems of care.
