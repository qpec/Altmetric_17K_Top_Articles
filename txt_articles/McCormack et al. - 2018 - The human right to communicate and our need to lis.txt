Abstract
Purpose: In 2013, the Australian Government Senate formed a committee for inquiry and report into the prevalence of
speech, language, and communication disorders and speech pathology services in Australia. Submissions were sought from
individuals and organisations. In this paper, submissions made by individuals with a history of childhood communication
disorder were examined to explore their life experiences and the impact on their lives when the right to communicate could
not be enacted.
Method: There were 305 submissions to the Australian Government Senate Committee Inquiry, of which 288 were
publically accessible. In this study, the submissions (n ¼ 17) from children or adults with a history of communication
disorder (including speech, language and stuttering), who provided personal accounts of their experiences, were analysed
using an interpretative phenomenological approach.
Result: Four themes emerged relating to: personal identity, life with communication disorder, the importance of help, and
how life would be different without a communication disorder.
Conclusions: This paper gives voice to children and adults with communication disorder. In listening to these voices, the
impact of communication disorder on the right to communicate and on other human rights can be heard, and the need for a
response is clear. However, the challenge is to determine how the voices of these individuals, and others like them, can be
enabled to exert real influence on practice and policy so communication disorder will no longer be a barrier to attainment of
their human rights.

Introduction
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (United Nations, 1948) states that ‘‘Everyone
has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart infor-
mation and ideas through any media and regardless
of frontiers’’. The right can be conceived in two
ways: (1) the right to communicate (e.g. to share
ideas and information with others), and, implied by
this, (2) the right to be able to communicate (e.g. to
have a mode of communication). That is, according
to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
individuals have a right to voice opinions and have
those opinions heard, but they also have a right to a
voice and for that voice to be understood.
Yet 70 years after the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights was written, the right to freedom of
opinion and expression is not available to all.
Challenges to Article 19 are most often recognised
when the right to communicate is stifled through
inequalities related to race, sex, religion, or status.
That is, when the right of individuals to voice opinions
is challenged due to discrimination. However, chal-
lenges to Article 19 are relevant to another group,
those whose right to communicate is stifled due to
communication disorder. Communication disorder
refers to difficultieswith producing orcomprehending
messages in oral and/or written form. Individuals
(children and adults) with communication disorder
are doubly disadvantaged; their lack of voice (i.e. an
effective mode of communication), means their voice
(i.e. what they want to communicate) goes unheard.

 Their right to communicate is challenged by their
impaired ability to communicate, and the impact can
be broad and long-lasting.
People with communication disorder experience
challenges across many life areas (McCormack,
McLeod, McAllister, & Harrison, 2009). For exam-
ple, large group studies of children with a communi-
cation disorder have reported poorer academic
performance, reading difficulties, more bullying,
poorer peer relationships, and higher rates of psycho-
social difficulties compared to typically developing
peers (Lewis et al., 2016; McCormack, Harrison,
McLeod, & McAllister, 2011). When examined
through the lens of human rights, these studies show
the impact of communication disorder extends far
beyond Article 19 to other Articles of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, including the right to
work (Article 23), the right to education (Article 26),
and the right to participate in the cultural life of the
community (Article 27).
The right to communicate was described by
Lundy
(2007),
in
her
analysis
of
the
United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, as
having ‘‘transformative potential . . . since, when it is
implemented effectively, other rights fall into place
naturally’’ (p. 940). The impact of childhood com-
munication disorder shows how other rights fall out
of place when the right to communicate is challenged
by the child’s lack of an effective communication
mode. Thus, we begin to see the importance of
supporting individuals with communication dis-
order; not just to provide them with a voice (i.e.
enact the right to communicate), but so they may
use that voice to participate in daily life (i.e. enact all
their human rights).
Human rights and speech-language pathology
When we seek to address violations of human rights,
we respond to a call to arms for the promotion and
securing of those rights. The Preamble to the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that
‘‘every individual and every organ of society. . . shall
strive by teaching and education to promote respect
for these rights and freedoms and. . .to secure their
universal and effective recognition and observance’’.
With
the
70th
anniversary
of
the
Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, it is timely for
health/education professionals who work with indi-
viduals with communication disorder to reflect on
how well we undertake our role in promoting and
securing the right to communicate for the individ-
uals with whom we work.
Lundy (2007) suggested a framework that might
aid this reflection. According to this framework, the
degree to which all individuals have the right to
communicate can be evaluated according to the
degree to which they are provided with space, voice,
audience, and influence. In a sense, this framework
combines Article 19 with the Preamble, recognising
that the securing of any individual’s human rights is
dependent on the action of other individuals. Thus, a
person’s right to communicate is only partially
secured when they have a voice (or means of commu-
nication). The right also requires that others provide
anopportunityfor thepersontousethatvoice(space),
andlisten towhattheysay(audience),andrespond ina
way that demonstrates the person’s communication
has been heard and given due weight (influence). So,
when we consider how well we have secured the right
to communicate for individuals with communication
disorder, weneed to consider not just whether wehave
supported them to be able to communicate, but
whether we have listened and responded to what they
had to sayand encouraged/assisted others to do so too.
Space and voice: Having the opportunity to
speak
As health/education professionals working with indi-
viduals with communication disorder we aim to
provide opportunities for expression (space) and
modes (voice) to express ideas and experiences as a
core component of our daily clinical activities. As
health/education researchers, we have examples of
this too. In particular, qualitative studies offer space
and voice for individuals with a history of childhood
communication disorder to share their lived experi-
ences, and their insights can be challenging and
thought-provoking.
For instance, interviews with pre-school children
with communication (speech) disorder have revealed
differences in the nature of the problems they
experience:
for
some,
speaking
intelligibly;
for
some, being heard/understood; and for others, the
frustration
of
communication
breaking
down
(McCormack, McLeod, McAllister, & Harrison,
2010). Interviews with school-aged children have
revealed similar differences in their understanding of
their difficulties and the purpose of intervention
(Owen, Hayett, & Roulstone, 2004). Longitudinal
case studies of children have illustrated the complex,
and ongoing nature of difficulties (Brinton, Fujiki, &
Robinson, 2005), as have single case studies of
adolescents/adults with a history of childhood com-
munication
disorder
(Carrigg,
Baker,
Parry,
&
Ballard, 2015; McCormack, McAllister, McLeod,
& Harrison, 2012). From the individuals in these
studies, we can begin to understand the persistent
and pervasive impact of childhood communication
disorder on academic attainment, social relation-
ships, education and employment prospects. We can
also see the impact on emotional and mental health.
For instance, Carrigg et al. (2015) reported 22-year-
old BJ’s reflection on his experience of living with
communication disorder. He recounted: ‘‘I often felt
left out because I wasn’t able to talk with other
people, I wasn’t able to tell other people my thoughts
or if I needed something. It was heartbreaking
because I knew what I wanted to say, but I couldn’t
The human right to communicate and our need to listen
143
 say it’’ (p. 46). The impact for BJ was so profound
that by 18 years, he had attempted suicide on three
different occasions.
In their pioneering text Listening to Children and
Young
People
with
Speech,
Language,
and
Communication Needs, Roulstone and McLeod
(2011) compiled other first-person accounts from
children, teenagers and young adults who live with
communication disorder. Their accounts provide
vivid insight into their lived experience, and in doing
so, demonstrate the challenge of enacting the right to
communicate when an effective mode of communi-
cation (voice) is absent, and the subsequent impact
of communication disorder on other human rights.
When sought and shared, these individual voices
cause us to reflect on what we do and how we could
do it better (Roulstone & McLeod, 2011). However,
for these voices to inform policy and practice, they
need to be heard.
Audience and influence: Having people to listen
As
health/education
professionals
working
with
individuals with communication disorder, listening
to our clients is core to our daily clinical work.
Qualitative researchers aim to do this too. However,
it is useful to reflect on the extent to which our
clinical interactions and research insights influence
what we do, particularly in an advocacy role.
Qualitative research is usually focussed on a small
select
sample,
guided
by
the
agenda
of
the
researchers
and
accessed
by
a
relatively
small
audience of other researchers and clinicians. In
order for this research to be truly reflective of
individual
perspectives
and
responsive
to
their
priorities, there is a need for individuals to deter-
mine the focus of the research and the content to
be shared. There is also a need for the information
to be shared with a broad audience, and a need for
the information that is shared to be acted upon by
that audience. As the Honourable John Bercow
stated in the foreword to Roulstone and McLeod’s
book, ‘‘the fundamental principle. . .is that children
and
young
people
with
speech,
language
and
communications
needs
have,
potentially,
within
them many of the answers to the questions which
others are posing about them. Despite this, they
tend to be ignored. . .’’ (Bercow, 2011, p. xxvii).
Lundy
offered
her
framework (space,
voice,
audience and influence) as a potential model for
‘‘informing understanding, developing policy and
auditing existing practice’’ with regards to enacting
the right to communicate (p. 941). While health/
education professions in Australia have provided
some space and voice for individuals with commu-
nication disorder, our provision of an audience and
advocacy for their influence has perhaps been less
apparent.
Context of this study: The Australian
Government Senate Committee
In 2013, the Australian Government Senate formed
a Community Affairs References Committee for
inquiry and report into the prevalence of speech,
language and communication disorders and speech-
language
pathology
services
in
Australia
(Commonwealth of Australia, 2014). Submissions
were sought from individuals and organisations in
2014. The terms of reference for the inquiry related
to: the prevalence of different types of communica-
tion and swallowing disorder, the incidence within
specific demographic groups, the availability/ade-
quacy
of
public
and
private
speech-language
pathology services, the social and economic cost of
failing to provide intervention and the projected
demand for speech-language pathology services.
Those wishing to make a submission were encour-
aged to address one or all terms of reference,
highlight their own perspective, and suggest how
any identified problems could be addressed. Thus,
the
Australian
Government
Senate
Committee
provided a space for children and adults with a
history of communication disorder to voice their
lived experience to a wide audience. Accessing, and
engaging with, these submissions then provides a
valuable starting point for reflecting on how the
voice of individuals can influence understanding,
practice, and advocacy for policy change.
Aim
Having
applied
Lundy’s
framework
to
current
research and practice in speech-language pathology,
we identified some gaps in the extent to which
individuals with communication disorder have been
provided with a space, voice, audience and influence
in the past. In this paper we attempt to address those
gaps. Specifically, the aim of this paper is to examine
the voices of Australian children and adults with a
history of communication disorder in childhood; to
consider their lived experience, and the impact of
their communication disorder on their right to
communicate,
and
on
other
human
rights.
Through
this
paper,
the
value
of
first-person
accounts in understanding communication disorder
and the potential power of individuals’ voices in
influencing clinical practice and policy, to better
enact the right to communicate, is emphasised.
Method
Participants1
There were 305 submissions to the Australian
Government
Senate
Committee,
of
which 288
were publically accessible (Parliament of Australia,
2014). For the purpose of this study, submissions
were excluded if (1) the topic was not childhood
communication disorder, (2) an account of living
with communication disorder was not included,
144
J. McCormack et al.
 and/or (3) the account was not given by the
individual with communication disorder.
There were 245 submissions related to childhood
communication disorder, but the majority of these
(n ¼ 231) were made by academics who research in
the field of childhood communication disorder,
speech-language pathologists, associations/organisa-
tions that support people with communication
needs, family members, teachers/principals, and
other health professionals. These submissions were
excluded as the purpose of this study was to explore
first-person accounts from individuals with commu-
nication disorder. Of the remaining 14 submissions,
two described general experiences of people with
communication disorder only, rather than present-
ing a first-person account. As such, they were
removed from the analysis. The final sample con-
sisted of 12 submissions that included 17 first-
person accounts of communication disorder in
childhood made by either children or adults (one
submission included letters from six children).
The children/adults who wrote the accounts
experienced a range of communication disorder:
speech and/or language and/or literacy difficulties
(n ¼ 10), childhood apraxia of speech (n ¼ 1), com-
munication disorder associated with cleft lip/palate
(n ¼ 1), and stuttering (n ¼ 5). The authors ranged
in age from children in the early years of school,
adolescents, young-middle aged adults and older
adults. Some noted their communication disorder
was resolved, while others continued to experience
difficulties. The submissions ranged in length from
two to three sentences (from the youngest children)
to multiple pages.
Procedure
The
submissions
received
by
the
Australian
Government Senate Committee investigating the
prevalence of speech, language, and communication
disorders and speech-language pathology services in
Australia were accessed via the public website
(Parliament of Australia, 2014). Every submission
was read by one or more of the researchers to
determine suitability for inclusion. All researchers
then read and confirmed the appropriateness of the
final 17 personal accounts for addressing the aims of
this research.
Analysis
An interpretative phenomenological analysis was
used in which six steps were undertaken to examine
individual experiences and explore patterns across
individuals’ accounts (Smith, Flowers, & Larkin,
2009):
Step 1: Reading and re-reading the case
All researchers read each of the 17 personal accounts
multiple times over a period of one to two weeks in
order to gain a sense of the individual’s experience.
This
enabled
immersion
in
each
individual’s
accounts and a heightened awareness of each indi-
vidual’s key messages.
Step 2: Initial noting: Exploratory
comments
Notes (typically in the form of codes) were made
alongside the written accounts in order to identify
the key messages individuals conveyed, particularly
through their vocabulary and phrases (linguistic
choice) and/or
the particular focus within
the
account (semantic choices). All researchers noted
comments on an initial sample of six submissions
and met to discuss the key messages that they had
identified and the consensus of their coding. The
researchers had identified the same key messages
although these were sometimes labelled differently.
A single researcher then coded the remaining sub-
missions (steps 3–5).
Step 3: Developing emergent themes
Codes were transformed into emergent themes to
capture the core meaning being conveyed by each
individual. Themes emerged as the researcher read
and reflected on the codes from step 2, examined
connections and contradictions, and determined
words/phrases that encapsulated the message, draw-
ing on the individual’s own words where possible.
Emergent themes from each individual’s account
were entered into a spreadsheet with one or more
quotes that illustrated the meaning.
Step 4: Searching for connections across
emergent themes
The list of emergent themes was interrogated to
examine associations between themes. This involved
re-examining the list of emergent themes and quotes
approximately one week after the themes were
developed, looking for overlaps and/or similarities
in the meanings expressed by the themes and re-
reading the illustrative quotes to determine whether
these
reflected
the
sense
of
connection.
Superordinate themes, sub-themes, and intercon-
nections between themes emerged through this
process of reflection and interpretation.
Step 5: Moving to the next case
Once this process had been completed for one
individual’s account it was repeated for all others
using the same interpretative phenomenological
analysis approach. Initial ideas generated by the
analysis of previous accounts were bracketed to
prevent interference with subsequent analyses. All
researchers met to discuss the emergent themes; they
reflected
on
the
illustrative
quotes,
considered
whether
the
themes
captured
the
messages
The human right to communicate and our need to listen
145
 adequately and with appropriate emphasis, and
reached a final consensus through this reflective
process.
Step 6: Looking for patterns across cases
Finally, the list of each individual’s super-ordinate
themes was scrutinised to look for patterns across
the sample. Individual Excel datasheets were gener-
ated for each theme and notes and quotes from each
submission that reflected the particular theme were
added to the datasheet to enable an exploration of
consistencies and differences. A model was gener-
ated that illustrated the themes and connections.
Each theme and each individual’s account were then
examined in light of the model to determine whether
they were still represented. The model was shared
with the research team and confirmed as reflective of
the
team’s
interpretation
of
the
individuals’
experiences.
Results and discussion
Four themes arose from the analysis, which will be
described and discussed in this section with refer-
ence to sections of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (United Nations, 1948), to Lundy’s
(2007) framework, and other literature. The themes
were:
(1) I am a person; I have a communication disorder.
(2) My communication disorder impacts how I interact
with others, and how they interact with me.
(3) Help can change me, change communication dis-
orders, and change lives.
(4) My life would be different if I didn’t have a commu-
nication disorder.
Theme 1: I am a person; I have a
communication disorder
The first theme identified the individuality of people
with communication disorder, while recognising
similarities in the way in which these difficulties
presented; often hidden to others or the individuals
themselves. As such, two subthemes emerged: Me
and Hidden (Figure 1).
Me: ‘‘I am an intelligent adult with a series
of communication issues’’
Across all of the submissions authored by adults
(n ¼ 9) and half of those authored by children
(n ¼ 4), a sense of individuality, competence, and
humanity was emphasised. Many of the individuals
commenced their submissions with an introduction
of who they were; their name, age, occupation,
qualifications, married status, family composition,
and/or cultural background. While inclusion of this
information may reflect the purpose for which they
were writing (i.e. providing background to context-
ualise their submission) this information overlaps
with many facets of human diversity that the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises
and protects in Article 2. For the individuals,
including this information also reflected their sense
of themselves as unique, intelligent, and capable
individuals first, and as people with communication
disorder second. One child commented; ‘‘I may have
had no speech but I was really quite smart’’
(S170D), while an adult made a similar point: ‘‘I
believe I am a very intelligent person who has great
potential to achieve greater goals in life and serve the
community in a very productive manner’’ (S07).
This idea that people with a communication dis-
order are individuals first and foremost resonates
with other personal accounts in the literature. For
instance, Sadruddin and Wahab (2013) reported
meeting Joseph, a man with mild intellectual impair-
ment, who wanted his researchers to know ‘‘I am a
NORMAL human being. . . Though I have minor
physical disability and can’t communicate clearly;
that doesn’t mean that I am abnormal.’’ Joseph, like
the adults and children in the current paper, wanted
to be recognised as individuals, not communication
disorders.
When they did describe their communication
disorder, the individuals did so in terms of the
diagnosis and/or the symptoms they experienced, for
instance; ‘‘I have a stutter’’ (S133), ‘‘I have never
been able to spell’’ (S11), ‘‘I couldn’t talk good’’
(S99Z). For some, these difficulties were still a part
of who they were, but only a part: ‘‘I am an
intelligent adult with a series of communication
issues’’ (S11). However, they did note the way in
which
the
communication
disorder
resulted
in
feelings of inadequacy (‘‘I always thought I was
dumb’’ (S56)), sadness, or frustration that others
failed to look beyond the communication disorder to
see them as real people; ‘‘They treat me like I’m
mentally challenged and incapable of doing any
meaningful work and earning an income’’ (S133).
The experiences that individuals describe show the
emotional and behavioural consequences of their
right and ability to communicate being challenged,
which has been widely reported in the research
literature
(Brinton,
Fujiki,
&
Robinson,
2005;
Carrigg et al., 2015; McCormack et al., 2010,
2012).
Hidden: ‘‘Years of holding back from
showing the real you’’
It was evident from the submissions that when a
communication disorder is present, it can hide an
individual’s skills, abilities and indeed a part of their
humanity. As one child described it: ‘‘your child
might be like me and have lots of ideas hidden in a
secret place in their brain’’ (S170D). At times, the
cause of their communication disorder was hidden
from the individual themselves: ‘‘It is hard to explain
what is going on inside my head when I am often
146
J. McCormack et al.
 unaware
of
it
myself’’
(S11).
Some
children
explained the ‘‘frustration’’ associated with this:
‘‘I couldn’t say anything right . . . I couldn’t hear
what I said wrong’’ (S99R). The frustration asso-
ciated with communication disorder has been pre-
viously
identified
in
research
with
pre-school
children, and the cause of the frustration (both
‘speaking’, and ‘‘listening’’ problems) was similar
too (McCormack et al., 2010).
At other times, individuals attempted to hide their
communication disorder in a desire to fit in. This
was particularly evident among the individuals with
fluency disorders: ‘‘I used to substitute the words I
couldn’t get out . . . I often pretended to go to the
bathroom before it was my turn [to read class novel
aloud]’’ (S06). Individuals described the ‘‘fear’’ of
being found out and the subsequent ‘‘embarrass-
ment’’ if they were. As a consequence, some indi-
viduals
noticed
themselves
‘‘withdrawing’’
from
interactions with others and ‘‘holding back from
showing the real you’’ (S21). This idea that a
communication disorder can mask the real person,
constraining the ability or desire to share thoughts,
needs, and feelings is consistent with previous
personal
accounts
(Carrigg
et
al.,
2015;
McCormack
et
al.,
2012).
Collectively,
such
accounts reveal how the hidden nature of commu-
nication disorder and the consequences of that
disorder ironically conceal the challenge to the
right to communicate being enacted. Furthermore,
when the problem is hidden, the need for solutions
remains hidden also.
Theme 2: My communication disorder
impacts how I interact with others, and how
they interact with me
The second theme reflected the uniqueness of
individuals’ life experiences and the ways in which
a communication disorder can impact the individ-
ual’s life, especially interactions with those around
them. Two subthemes were evident within this
second theme: Life and Impact (Figure 1).
Life: ‘‘My life is pretty busy. I have lots of
different activities and hobbies’’
Within their submissions, individuals described their
lives in terms of their interests and their hopes for
the future. This theme, like the first, emerged as
evidence of their desire to claim an identity outside
of their communication disorder. Children and
adolescents described their enjoyment of sports
and engagement in hobbies and community events.
They described potential future employment path-
ways such as teaching and computer animation, and
recognised their ability to contribute to society. One
child commented, ‘‘I believe that even though we are
only children we can still really make a difference in
the world . . .’’ (S170D). Then continued, ‘‘. . . being
able to communicate has helped me to talk to people
about my ideas’’. For this child, communication was
key
to
realising
Article
29
of
the
Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in which ‘‘Everyone
has duties to the community in which alone the free
and full development of his personality is possible’’.
Adolescents and adults described their paid employ-
ment, but also their voluntary work, often assisting
others with communication disorder through coach-
ing (S21) and mentoring (S13).
This idea of individuals with a communication
disorder living a busy life and aspiring to engage in
employment,
hobbies,
and
community
events
accords
with
previous
accounts.
For
instance,
Sadruddin and Wahab (2013) reported in their
case study of Joseph that he had an aspiration to
develop a business decorating bottles and earn a
Figure 1. Four themes on life with a childhood communication disorder.
The human right to communicate and our need to listen
147
 living to financially support his family. Carrigg et al.
(2015) reported in their study that BJ, a young man
with a severe speech sound disorder, had an aspir-
ation to ‘‘have a career that will help people’’ (p. 46).
However, a communication disorder can affect the
realisation of these aspirations.
Impact: ‘‘My communication disorder has
had a significant and profound impact on
my life’’
The presence of a communication disorder was
generally recognised as influencing an individual’s
life experience: ‘‘Growing up with a communication
disorder was extremely difficult’’ (S175). It was clear
that a communication disorder in childhood could
affect
how
individuals
undertake
life
activities,
interact with other people, and the way in which
others interact with them. Such comments affirm
recollections by others reported in the literature on
the impact of a communication disorder of their life
(Carrigg et al., 2015; McCormack et al., 2010,
2012; Sadruddin & Wahab, 2013). One child
recognised this within his own experience; ‘‘I know
that life can be a bit tricky for me’’ (S170D) while
one young adult recognised that he was not alone in
his experiences; ‘‘. . . craniofacial anomalies affect the
lives of thousands of children in our world’’ (S13).
The individuals reflected on tasks that were
difficult during the school years: reading aloud,
answering teacher’s questions, doing show-and-tell,
reading, understanding, and completing tasks on
time. While the ‘‘right to education’’ ensured in
Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was enacted for these individuals, the experi-
ence was often not positive. One explained how ‘‘all
talking used to be very terrifying’’ (S170D) and
others described how they ‘‘dreaded’’ going to
school. One explained how he ‘‘was unable to
communicate with my teachers or other children,
which really impacted my ability to learn and to
socialise’’ (S175). Such comments were consistent
with previous reports in the literature. For instance,
in recollecting his experience of high school, BJ
noted ‘‘I was often intentionally put in many
distressing and upsetting situations by my teachers’’
(Carrigg et al., 2015, p. 46).
As a result of their difficulties, children sometimes
felt sad and withdrew from social activities; ‘‘I was
really nervous, too nervous to go up to people
playing . . .’’ (S99R). However, at other times they
had no choice and were actively left out, teased and
bullied: ‘‘When I was at school, I can remember
spending every lunch time sitting by myself because
no one will even try to talk to me’’ (S175).
Adolescents and adults were disappointed by tea-
chers who made them feel ‘‘stupid’’ and embar-
rassed,
or
failed
to
recognise
their
academic
difficulties reflected an underlying communication
disorder. This suggests their rights under Article 5 of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
protects individuals from ‘‘degrading treatment’’,
were not being met. In some cases, this was
experienced more through passive actions such as
neglect: ‘‘unfortunately most teachers didn’t even
notice . . . wouldn’t even question why my marks
were so bad’’ (S56).
Some adults provided specific examples of how
their adult lives had been impacted, for instance, one
described how she changed her lunch order every
day in order to avoid saying words that she produced
dysfluently. Another described how he changed jobs
due to the fear of making errors, and a third
explained how his choice of career was influenced
by the ‘‘. . . belief that you could not pursue a career
that involves verbal communication’’ (S21). Again,
these accounts reiterate others from the literature.
For instance, Brinton, Fujiki and Robinson (2005,
p. 349) noted how Cody, a 19-year-old man with a
language disorder, was coming to a realisation that
being a novelist was not a realistic goal, and that
he ‘‘will not be able to do the things that he would
like to do’’.
Other adults felt that a failure to understand their
communication disorder had led potential employers
to disregard them in job interviews: ‘‘It is hard for
me to communicate effectively during job interviews
because I missed out on jobs that require reasonable
communication skills’’ (S07). In cases such as these
individual’s ‘‘right to work, to free choice of employ-
ment’’ (Article 23) was challenged due to their
communication disorder. These submissions show
the importance of providing individuals with com-
munication disorder with space (opportunities) to
share their ideas, and with an audience that listens
(Lundy, 2007).
Theme 3: Help can change me, change
communication disorders and change lives
The third theme recognised the types of help that
were provided to individuals and the way in which
the provision of help might need to be altered in
order
to
be
more
effective.
This
theme
also
recognised the changes that result from the provision
of timely and effective help. Consequently, there are
two subthemes: help and change (Figure 1). These
themes did not relate specifically to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, but demonstrated
how help supported the enactment of a range of
human rights which require communication to be
realised.
Help: ‘‘It’s good for people to learn how to
speak and help people to understand you’’
A strong and recurrent theme that emerged across
the submissions reflected the need for help. All
submission authors described the help that they
had sought or received or help that had been
sought
on
their
behalf
to
address
their
148
J. McCormack et al.
 communication
disorder.
This
included
formal
assistance
such
as
medication,
speech-language
pathology intervention, consultations with other
health professionals, provision of aids, workshops/
courses, and surgery. Help was generally con-
sidered ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘important’’, although limita-
tions or challenges were also noted, in terms of
cost, effort, availability, and effectiveness: ‘‘. . . I
was still unable to retain any information which
made me feel horrible for wasting my mum’s
money’’
(S56).
Individuals
also
recognised
the
value of informal help through relationships with
others who could provide them with information,
strategies and support.
Many also identified a need for the provision of
help to change, listing recommendations, based on
their experiences: ‘‘I think there should be more
readily available and accessible services and pro-
grams to aid children with communication disorders
and their families’’ (S175). The inclusion of such
information is perhaps not surprising, given the
purpose of writing these submissions was to inform
the Australian Government Senate Inquiry about
service provision and need; however, the type and
focus of these recommendations was broad and
insightful, including research, education, funding,
mandatory testing and more frequent services, as
well as better recognition/marketing of effective
programs.
Change: ‘‘The [intervention] course changed
my life for the better’’
It was clear from the submissions that help can
directly change an individual’s communication dis-
order, their self-perception and/or their life. Some
individuals
described
the
way
that
help
had
improved their communication skills: ‘‘Now I can
talk really good’’ (S99Z). However, the majority
described how help had improved their lives. For
instance, children reported having more friends, and
being able to participate in activities that were once
difficult such as answering questions in class, sharing
their ideas, asking to play games with other children
or helping children who were hurt, which they had
not been able to do previously. As a result, their
sense of self altered too, as they reported changing
from anxious and fearful speakers to happy and
confident ones. These accounts provide further
testimony to the fact that when communication
disorders are addressed, lives can be transformed
through widespread changes in day-to-day activity
and
participation
(Thomas-Stonell,
Oddson,
Robertson, & Rosenbaum, 2009).
Children and adults recognised that change takes
time: ‘‘I was a big man when I talked good’’ (S99D).
For some adults, they had made improvements but
still had work to do. However, others had experi-
enced ‘‘life-changing’’ benefits. Like the children,
the adults described changes to their lives as a result
of effective help, with one pursuing a new career,
and others feeling more confident in their daily lives.
Two also experienced changes in how they perceived
themselves as a consequence of understanding their
communication disorder, through the help they had
received: ‘‘I have a greater understanding and
newfound respect for my own determination . . .’’
(S11). These submissions highlight the way in which
help can create change, for individuals, their com-
munication disorder and their lives. This informa-
tion, coupled with the empirical evidence on the
effectiveness of interventions for communication
disorders, should influence us to become better
advocates for change in policy and service delivery
(Lundy, 2007).
Theme 4: My life would be different if I
didn’t have a communication disorder
Throughout the submissions, there was a sense that
individuals felt different from their peers as a result
of having a communication disorder, and felt that
their lives would have been different if the commu-
nication disorder did not exist or had been addressed
earlier. This theme of ‘‘difference’’ is shown in
two subthemes: Different Me and Different Life
(Figure 1).
Different me: ‘‘I hated being different’’
Individuals reflected on their desire to be like
‘‘everyone’’ else and their sadness in being different
to
others.
Some
identified
the
confusion
they
experienced in trying to figure out why: ‘‘I never
understood how everyone understood everything
but me’’ (S56). Others commented on how they
used strategies to appear ‘‘normal’’ (such as sub-
stituting words). In addition to hiding their difficul-
ties, some individuals also described how they
attempted to hide their receipt of help: ‘‘I didn’t
tell my friends I did it [speech therapy]’’ (S279).
Others hid the informal strategies that they relied
upon on to get by, such as ‘‘copying the other
children’’ in the class (S56). This appeared to reflect
their desire of not appearing different or incapable.
The struggle of not wanting to be different but
feeling and/or being different accords with previous
research on the experiences of children with a
communication
disorder (Brinton
et al., 2005;
Havstam, Laakso, & Ringsberg, 2011). For instance,
Havstam et al. noted how young adults growing up
with a cleft and a speech impairment, desired to fit in
yet saw themselves as different. Similarly, Cody – a
young man with a language disorder – perceived his
social life as like riding a tricycle, while his peers
drove sports cars (Brinton et al., 2005). In order for
the right to communicate to be upheld, differences
in
communication
styles/abilities
need
to
be
acknowledged
without
stigma
(Merrick
&
Roulstone, 2011).
The human right to communicate and our need to listen
149
 Different life: ‘‘What if? where would I be
now?’’
There was a sense that life would be different if an
individual’s communication disorder was recog-
nised, an accurate diagnosis was made, and appro-
priate help was given: ‘‘I believe my life would have
been very different if my disorder had been picked
up earlier’’ (S56). However, individuals noted that
help was not provided due to a lack of awareness and
understanding
about
communication
disorder:
‘‘Communication issues are invisible in the class-
room unless you have a trained eye’’ (S11). Thus,
there was a sense of needing to help potential helpers
(e.g. teachers) to see what was ‘‘hidden’’. One
individual had only received effective help as an
adult, despite accessing other services as a child.
He reflected that his life might have been different
if this help had been received earlier: ‘‘What if?
Where would I be now?’’ (S21). Thus it is clear
that the difficulties experienced by people with
communication disorder may be exacerbated by
violations of other rights, such as the right to medical
care and social services for health and wellbeing
(Article 25).
Summary
While each theme is independent, the interconnec-
tions highlight the complex way in which personal
identity, communication disorder, life, and help
blend in unique and dynamic ways. The individuals
saw themselves as people first (‘‘Me’’) with commu-
nication disorder that impacted their lives. They
recognised that their humanity and their communi-
cation
disorder
could
be
invisible
to
others
(‘‘Hidden’’) due to the very nature of the problem.
However, they also recognised that their communi-
cation disorder could be hidden by their own
actions, taken due to a desire to be acknowledged
for who they were (‘‘Me’’) rather than how they
might otherwise be perceived (‘‘Different Me’’).
They saw the value of support and intervention
(‘‘Help’’) in addressing the impact of communica-
tion disorder and altering life outcomes (‘‘Different
Life’’). However, for this to occur, communication
disorders
and
their
consequences
(‘‘Impact’’)
needed to be made visible.
Limitations
The number of personal accounts analysed in this
study was small, and participant checking of themes,
to ensure that they accurately reflected individual’s
experiences, was not undertaken. These limitations
were due to the nature of the dataset from which the
sample was taken. Further research with a larger
sample would be useful in determining whether the
themes that emerged from this research could be
applied
to
other
children
and
adults
with
communication disorder. Furthermore, the relation-
ship between human rights attainment and specific
types of communication disorder could be explored.
Conclusions
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (United Nations, 1948) ensures ‘‘the right to
freedom of opinion and expression’’ for all people,
and the Preamble stipulates the role we all play in
promoting and securing this right for others. For
health/education professionals, we have a particular
role in supporting individuals with communication
disorder, whose right to communicate may be
challenged by the lack of an effective means of
communication. However, supporting them to gain
an effective voice (means of communication) is only
part of our role. We also need to consider how we
provide them with a space, an audience and an
influence. To undertake our role effectively, it is
imperative that we understand how communication
disorder constrains the right to communicate, and
by
extension,
the
enactment
of
other
rights.
Additionally, we need to understand how these
constraints are, or can be, overcome.
The individuals with communication disorder who
made submissions to the Australian Government
Senate Inquiry revealed how communication disorder
can impact the right to communicate and other
human rights. Their accounts, and their insights
into service provision and access, have the potential to
inform our policies and improve our practices, but
only if we become an audience who listens, and
advocates for this influence. Seventy years after the
creation of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights it remains the responsibility of all of us to
seek out, listen to, and act on the voices of those who
are typically the least likely to be heard.
