IMPORTANCE Clinicians have been urged to delay the use of obstetric interventions
(eg, labor induction, cesarean delivery) until 39 weeks or later in the absence of maternal
or fetal indications for intervention.
OBJECTIVE To describe recent trends in late preterm and early term birth rates in 6
high-income countries and assess association with use of clinician-initiated obstetric
interventions.
DESIGN Retrospective analysis of singleton live births from 2006 to the latest available year
(ranging from 2010 to 2015) in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden,
and the United States.
EXPOSURES Use of clinician-initiated obstetric intervention (either labor induction
or prelabor cesarean delivery) during delivery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual country-specific late preterm (34-36 weeks)
and early term (37-38 weeks) birth rates.
RESULTS The study population included 2 415 432 Canadian births in 2006-2014 (4.8% late
preterm; 25.3% early term); 305 947 Danish births in 2006-2010 (3.6% late preterm; 18.8%
early term); 571 937 Finnish births in 2006-2015 (3.3% late preterm; 16.8% early term);
468 954 Norwegian births in 2006-2013 (3.8% late preterm; 17.2% early term); 737 754
Swedish births in 2006-2012 (3.6% late preterm; 18.7% early term); and 25 788 558 US
births in 2006-2014 (6.0% late preterm; 26.9% early term). Late preterm birth rates
decreased in Norway (3.9% to 3.5%) and the United States (6.8% to 5.7%). Early term birth
rates decreased in Norway (17.6% to 16.8%), Sweden (19.4% to 18.5%), and the United States
(30.2% to 24.4%). In the United States, early term birth rates decreased from 33.0% in 2006
to 21.1% in 2014 among births with clinician-initiated obstetric intervention, and from 29.7%
in 2006 to 27.1% in 2014 among births without clinician-initiated obstetric intervention.
Rates of clinician-initiated obstetric intervention increased among late preterm births in
Canada (28.0% to 37.9%), Denmark (22.2% to 25.0%), and Finland (25.1% to 38.5%), and
among early term births in Denmark (38.4% to 43.8%) and Finland (29.8% to 40.1%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 2006 and 2014, late preterm and early term
birth rates decreased in the United States, and an association was observed between
early term birth rates and decreasing clinician-initiated obstetric interventions. Late preterm
births also decreased in Norway, and early term births decreased in Norway and Sweden.
Clinician-initiated obstetric interventions increased in some countries but no association was
found with rates of late preterm or early term birth.

L
ate preterm and early term births are of emerging clini-
cal and public health importance and concern due to the
associated risks of adverse neonatal and childhood
outcomes.1,2 Preterm and early term births may occur sponta-
neously or be initiated by clinicians through the use of obstet-
ric interventions such as labor induction or cesarean delivery.
In the case of maternal or fetal clinical indications (eg, pre-
eclampsia or fetal growth restriction), obstetric interventions
maybemedicallyindicatedornonelective.2IntheUnitedStates,
clinicians have been urged to reduce nonmedically indicated
or elective deliveries before 39 weeks.3,4
Increasing US preterm birth rates from the 1990s to the
mid-2000s were attributed in part to changes in the use of ob-
stetric interventions.5-8 Recently, declines in both spontane-
ous preterm births and preterm births that involved induc-
tionorcesareandeliveryweredocumentedintheUnitedStates
over 2005-2012.9 Several recent US-based hospital and re-
gional studies have documented reductions in elective obstet-
ric intervention at early term gestations,10-12 but these trends
have not been examined at the national level. The relation-
ships between use of obstetric interventions and national-
level late preterm and early term birth rates have not been ex-
amined in other high-income countries where obstetric
intervention practices may be similar to the United States.
This study described temporal trends since 2006 in late
preterm and early term birth rates across 6 high-income coun-
tries in North America and Europe, and assessed the associa-
tion between these temporal trends and changes in the use of
clinician-initiated obstetric interventions.
Methods
This study was conducted using national and population-
based birth registry data from 2006 to the most recent avail-
able year in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden,
and the United States. Canadian data were from hospitaliza-
tion records in the Canadian Institute for Health Information
Discharge Abstract Database, including all hospital live
births in all Canadian provinces and territories except
Quebec. Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish data were
from nationwide medical birth registers that collect infant
and maternal data by mandatory reporting.13,14 US data were
from the National Center for Health Statistics natality public
use files containing birth certificate data for more than 99%
of US births.
This study used deidentified, aggregated data sets; it was
reviewed by the Emory institutional review board and deter-
mined not to be human participant research. The study popu-
lation included singleton live births delivered at 22 or more
completed weeks of gestation and weighing 500 g or more at
birth. Births were excluded if missing information on gesta-
tional age or birth weight, or if reported birth weight was im-
plausible for gestational age.15
Outcomes were annual country-specific late preterm and
early term birth rates. The late preterm birth rate was the per-
centageofallsingletonlivebirthsthatoccurredat34to36com-
pleted weeks of gestation. The early term birth rate was the
percentage of all singleton live births that occurred at 37 to 38
completed weeks of gestation.
Gestational age was determined using an ultrasound- or
clinical-basedestimateasavailableineachcountry.InDenmark,
gestational age was estimated from ultrasound dating prior to
24 weeks or from the first day of the last menstrual period. In
Canada, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, gestational age esti-
mateswereprimarilybasedonultrasounddatingduringthefirst
or early second trimester.16 In the United States, the best ob-
stetric estimate of gestation (determined by birth attendants
based on all perinatal factors and assessments) was used.17
Clinician-initiated obstetric intervention was defined as
the presence of either labor induction or prelabor cesarean
delivery. In Canada, induction of labor was identified based
on Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI)
codes. Prelabor cesarean deliveries were identified as cesar-
ean deliveries without signs of labor using CCI and Interna-
tional Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems,
10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) codes. In Denmark, the
medical birth register contained codes for prelabor induction
and cesarean section. In Finland, planned cesarean delivery
was reported if the decision on cesarean delivery was made
before the start of labor, and there was a checkbox for labor
induction. In Norway, checkboxes for onset of labor (sponta-
neous onset, labor induction, or cesarean delivery) and cesar-
ean delivery (acute or elective) were used. In Sweden, birth
registrations included variables for mode of delivery denot-
ing start (elective cesarean delivery, labor induction, or spon-
taneous) and end (cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery) of
delivery. In the United States, there was a checkbox for labor
induction. Prelabor cesarean deliveries were cesarean deliv-
eries with the birth certificate checkbox for “trial of labor
attempted” marked “no.” Because this checkbox was added
to the 2003 revision of the US live birth certificate, analyses
were restricted to US births reported on the 2003 revision.
The proportion of total US births included increased from
49% in 2006 to 96% in 2014 as additional states adopted the
revised birth certificate.18 In a sensitivity analysis, US analy-
ses were restricted to births in states that reported on the
2003 revision for all study years to ensure that changes to
Key Points
Question Are temporal trends in late preterm and early term birth
rates in 6 high-income countries associated with use of
clinician-initiated obstetric interventions?
Findings These population-based retrospective analyses of
singleton live births found declining late preterm birth rates in
Norway and the United States and declining early term birth rates
in Norway, Sweden, and the United States. Obstetric interventions
increased in some countries but decreased in the United States,
where an association was observed with decreasing early term
birth rates.
Meaning Decreasing US early term birth rates were associated
with decreasing rates of clinician-initiated obstetric interventions;
obstetric interventions increased in some other countries but with
no association with late preterm or early term birth rates.

the states included in the analyses due to variable time of
adoption of the 2003 revised birth certificate did not drive
the results of the main analyses.
Forallcountries,datawereobtainedinaggregateddatasets
with counts of births in strata defined by cross-tabulations of
year, gestational age category, labor induction, mode of deliv-
ery (vaginal delivery; cesarean delivery without trial of
labor/elective cesarean delivery; cesarean delivery with trial
of labor/emergency cesarean delivery; cesarean delivery, un-
known whether elective or emergency), mother’
s age at de-
livery(≤17,18-19,20-24,25-34,≥35years),andparity(first,sec-
ond or third, fourth or above live birth). Canadian and Danish
data sets were provided with suppression of all strata with 1-4
for Canada or 1-3 for Denmark birth counts. Counts were im-
putedforthesestratabyrandomlyassigningintegervalues1-4
for Canada and 1-3 for Denmark to the suppressed strata.
Statistical Analyses
Country-level yearly rates of late preterm birth and early term
birth, as well as rates of labor induction, prelabor cesarean de-
livery, and the combined outcome of clinician-initiated ob-
stetricinterventionamonglatepretermbirthsandamongearly
term births, were computed. Country-level rate ratios (RRs) for
the annual rates of change in late preterm and early term birth
rates over the study period were estimated using negative bi-
nomial regression with year as a continuous variable. In ad-
dition to RRs representing average annual rate of change for
each country, summary RRs were computed to represent the
total change in rate from the first to the last year of each coun-
try’
s observed study period (eg, 8-year change for countries
with data for 2006-2014). Because countries varied in years
of available data, summary RRs were not directly comparable
across countries. Base models were unadjusted (Model 0) to
quantify the crude trend in rates, and Model 1 was adjusted
for potential individual-level covariates that may have dif-
fered across countries (ie, mother’
s age at delivery, parity).
Model 2 was further adjusted for clinician-initiated interven-
tion to assess whether temporal trends in obstetric interven-
tion were associated with concurrent changes in the late pre-
term or early term birth rates. If changes in obstetric
intervention practices were associated with observed changes
in late preterm or early term birth rates, adjustment for this
variable would shift estimated RRs toward the null. Multipli-
cativeinteractiontermsbetweenyearofdeliveryandclinician-
initiated obstetric intervention were added to Model 2 to test
whether the rate of change in late preterm or early term birth
rate over the study period differed between births with and
without clinician-initiated intervention (Model 3).
Adjustedanalyseswerebasedonbirthswithcompletedata.
Data were missing for clinician-initiated intervention,
mother’
s age at delivery, and parity in a small proportion of
births. Parity data were missing for 22% (n = 519 918) of
Canadian births; these births were similar to complete cases
in terms of gestational age, clinician-initiated obstetric inter-
vention, and mother’
s age at delivery. In a sensitivity analy-
sis, multiple imputation was conducted for missing parity data
using the monotone discriminant function method based on
observed values of the other analytic variables.19 In 0.3% of
the Norwegian cesarean deliveries and 2.3% of the US cesar-
ean deliveries, information was missing on whether labor
was attempted prior to delivery (United States) or whether
it was an elective or emergency cesarean delivery (Norway).
The primary analyses took the conservative approach of treat-
ing these births as emergency cesarean deliveries, potentially
underestimating clinician-initiated obstetric interventions. In
sensitivity analyses, these births were treated as all involving
clinician-initiated obstetric intervention or all missing mode
of delivery.
Analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute), ver-
sion 9.4. Results were considered statistically significant at an
α of less than .05 (2-sided).
Results
The study population included singleton live births during
2006-2014 in Canada (n = 2 415 432); 2006-2010 in Denmark
(n = 305 947); 2006-2015 in Finland (n = 571 937); 2006-2013
in Norway (n = 468 954); 2006-2012 in Sweden (n = 737 754);
and 2006-2014 in the United States (n = 25 788 558). Im-
puted birth counts represented less than 1% of births in both
Canada (n = 1556) and Denmark (n = 659). Less than 2.5% of
singletonlivebirthsineachcountrywereexcludedduetomiss-
ing information on gestational age or birth weight, or if re-
ported birth weight was implausible for gestational age (eTable
1 in the Supplement). Results of the sensitivity analysis re-
stricting US analyses to births in states that reported on the
2003 revised live birth certificate for all study years were simi-
lar to the main results (eTables 2-3 in the Supplement).
Late preterm birth rates pooled over the years of avail-
able data for each country were 4.8% in Canada, 3.6% in
Denmark, 3.3% in Finland, 3.8% in Norway, 3.6% in Sweden,
and 6.0% in the United States (Table 1). Adjusting for moth-
er’
s age at delivery and parity, late preterm birth rates signifi-
cantly decreased in Norway (annual decrease of 2.9% [95% CI,
0.4% to 5.3%] from 3.9% in 2006 to 3.5% in 2013) and the
United States (annual decrease of 1.6% [95% CI, 0.9% to 2.3%]
from 6.8% in 2006 to 5.7% in 2014) (Table 2, Model 1).
Earlytermbirthratespooledovertheyearsofavailabledata
for each country were 25.3% in Canada, 18.8% in Denmark,
16.8%inFinland,17.2%inNorway,18.7%inSweden,and26.9%
in the United States. Adjusting for mother’
s age at delivery and
parity, early term birth rates significantly decreased in
Norway (annual decrease of 2.3% [95% CI, 0.5% to 4.0%] from
17.6% in 2006 to 16.8% in 2013), Sweden (annual decrease of
2.5% [95% CI, 0.2% to 4.8%] from 19.5% in 2006 to 18.5% in
2012), and the United States (annual decrease of 3.7% [95% CI,
3.4% to 4.1%] from 31.2% in 2006 to 24.4% in 2014) (Table 2,
Model 1).
Mean rates of clinician-initiated obstetric intervention
among late preterm and early term births as well as trends in
those rates over the study period varied across countries
(Figure; eTable 4 in the Supplement). The United States had
the highest rates of clinician-initiated obstetric intervention
amonglatepretermbirths;44.1%oflatepretermbirthsin2006-
2014 involved clinician-initiated obstetric intervention.

Increases in clinician-initiated obstetric interventions among
late preterm births were observed in Canada (28.0% in 2006
to 37.9% in 2014), Denmark (22.2% in 2006 to 25.0% in 2010)
and Finland (25.1% in 2006 to 38.5% in 2015), although there
was no significant change in late preterm birth rates in those
countries over the study period (Table 2, Model 1). Increasing
prevalence of intervention in Canada reflected increasing rates
ofbothprelaborcesareandeliveryandlaborinduction,whereas
increases in Denmark and Finland reflected increasing rates
of labor induction.
Early term births generally had higher rates of clinician-
initiated obstetric intervention compared with late preterm
births, although in the United States this pattern reversed af-
ter 2009 (Figure; eTable 4 in the Supplement). Rates of clini-
cian-initiated obstetric intervention among early term births
were highest in Canada (45.2% among early term births in
2006-2014), Denmark (41.8% of early term births in 2006-
2010), and the United States (42.4% of early term births in
2006-2014). Increasing rates of clinician-initiated obstetric in-
tervention among early term births were observed in Denmark
(38.4% in 2006 to 43.8% in 2010) and Finland (29.8% in 2006
to 40.1% in 2015), reflecting increases in labor induction, al-
though no significant change was observed in early term birth
rate over the same period (Table 2, Model 1). In contrast, rates
of clinician-initiated obstetric intervention declined among US
early term births (48.9% in 2006 to 38.7% in 2014), reflecting
declines in both labor induction and prelabor cesarean deliv-
ery, in tandem with the significant decrease observed in early
term birth rate (Table 2, Model 1).
Adjusting for clinician-initiated obstetric intervention did
not change estimated RRs for temporal change in late pre-
term birth rates (Table 2, Model 2). A significant interaction be-
tween year of delivery and clinician-initiated obstetric inter-
vention was found for Canada (P = .04), indicating that

intervention. Across all Canadian births, no significant change
was observed in late preterm birth rate over 2006-2014. This
overall null effect appeared to reflect a nonsignificant annual
increase of 1.4% (95% CI, −0.8% to 3.7%) in late preterm birth
rates among births with clinician-initiated obstetric interven-
tion, combined with a nonsignificant annual decrease of 2.1%
(95% CI, −4.5% to 0.4%) among births without clinician-
initiated obstetric intervention (Table 2, Model 3). Over the
8-year study period in Canada, late preterm birth rates in-
creased by 11.9% (95% CI, −6.4% to 33.7%) among births with
clinician-initiated obstetric intervention but decreased by
15.4%(95%CI,−30.6%to3.3%)amongbirthswithoutclinician-
initiated obstetric intervention (Table 2, Model 3). In abso-
lute terms, unadjusted late preterm birth rates increased from
4.3% in 2006 to 4.7% in 2014 among births with clinician-
initiated obstetric intervention but decreased from 5.3% in
2006 to 4.8% in 2014 among births without clinician-
initiated obstetric intervention (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Adjusting for clinician-initiated obstetric intervention did
not change estimated RRs for temporal change in early term
birth rates (Table 2, Model 2). A significant interaction be-
tween year of delivery and obstetric intervention was ob-
served in the United States (P < .001): an annual decrease of
5.3% (95% CI, 4.9% to 5.8%) in early term birth rates among
births with clinician-initiated obstetric intervention vs an an-
nualdecreaseof1.8%(95%CI,1.3%to2.3%)amongbirthswith-
out clinician-initiated obstetric intervention. Over the 8-year
study period in the United States, early term birth rates de-
clined by 35.6% (95% CI, 33.3% to 37.8%) among births with
clinician-initiated obstetric intervention and by 13.5% (95% CI,
9.8% to 17.1%) among births without clinician-initiated ob-
stetric intervention after adjustment for maternal age at de-
livery and parity (Table 2, Model 3). In absolute terms, unad-
justed early term birth rates declined from 33.0% in 2006 to
21.1% in 2014 among births with clinician-initiated obstetric
intervention, and from 29.7% in 2006 to 27.1% in 2014 among
birthswithoutclinician-initiatedobstetricintervention(eTable
5 in the Supplement).
Results were similar to the primary findings when mul-
tiple imputation was conducted for missing parity data in
Canada (eTable 6 in the Supplement), and Norwegian and US
births by cesarean delivery with missing data on whether la-
bor was attempted prior to delivery (United States) or whether
it was an elective or emergency cesarean delivery (Norway)
were treated as all involving clinician-initiated obstetric in-
tervention or all missing mode of delivery (eTable 7 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
Since 2006, late preterm birth rates decreased in Norway and
the United States and early term birth rates decreased in
Norway, Sweden, and the United States, whereas rates re-
mained stable in the other countries studied. Clinician-
initiated obstetric interventions increased among late pre-
term births in Canada, Denmark, and Finland, although they
remained insufficiently frequent in absolute terms in those
countries to affect late preterm birth rates. Clinician-initiated
obstetric interventions (especially labor induction) increased
in Denmark and Finland, although there was no effect seen on
early term birth rates. In the United States, however, a con-
siderable decrease in clinician-initiated obstetric interven-
tions occurred among early term births, coupled with a larger
decrease in early term birth rate among births with such in-
terventions compared with births without the interventions.
Several multicountry reports, including the countries in
this study, have characterized recent trends in their rates of
all preterm births (<37 weeks).20-22 Few reports, however,
have documented population-based trends in late preterm
birth, and none have compared trends in early term birth.
Declining US rates of preterm birth9 and early term birth23
have been documented since 2005, and this study confirmed
a continuation of those trends through 2014. To the authors’
knowledge, this is the first study to compare prevalence of
clinician-initiated obstetric interventions across several high-
income countries.
Late preterm birth and early term birth rates were higher
in Canada and the United States compared with the Nordic
countries. Although the US late preterm birth rates declined
by 12% after several decades of increasing preterm birth
rates24 and early term birth rates declined by 37%, US rates
remained higher than the other countries studied. Overall
rates of clinician-initiated obstetric intervention varied
across countries among late preterm births, ranging from
23% in Denmark to 44% in the United States, and among
early term births, ranging from 33% in Finland to 45% in
Canada. In most countries, obstetric intervention was more
common among early term than late preterm births, probably
owing to the known higher neonatal risks of preterm
delivery.25 Canadian rates of clinician-initiated obstetric
intervention were low among late preterm births at the start
of the study period, reflecting low rates of prelabor cesarean
delivery. One possible explanation for the subsequent
increase in prelabor cesarean delivery is a return to former
clinical practices after efforts to reduce clinician-initiated
obstetric interventions in response to the peak in Canadian
preterm birth rates observed in 2004.26 In line with recent
observations of increasing labor induction rates in the Nordic
countries,27,28 clinician-initiated intervention rates increased
in those countries over the study period; yet, late preterm
and early term birth rates remained stable. Continued moni-
toring and analysis of these trends is required, especially to
identify factors driving increasing rates of labor induction.
The US findings were consistent with several recent
hospital- and regional-based studies reporting reductions in
elective obstetric intervention at early term gestations10-12,29
and may reflect the success of perinatal quality collaboratives
aimed at reducing elective deliveries prior to 39 weeks.30-32
Concerns have been expressed that delaying interventions
until 39 weeks might increase stillbirth rates,10 and this is an
area requiring further study. Decreasing late preterm and
early term birth rates were also observed among births with-
out clinician-initiated obstetric intervention, similar to recent
findings of decreases in spontaneous late preterm births.9

spontaneous late preterm birth (eg, progesterone use, cer-
clage) may apply to the early term population.33
Multicountry studies are typically limited by noncompa-
rable data and the use of ecologic analyses. A major strength of
this study was the use of large, national- and population-
based birth registry data sets from several countries, obtained
in harmonized data sets containing some individual-level po-
tential confounders (eg, mother’
s age at delivery), allowing for
a more rigorous analysis than an ecologic comparison of trends
across countries. Residual confounding cannot be excluded,
however, owing to differences in additional maternal factors
suchassocioeconomicstatus(eg,accesstoandqualityofhealth
care), race and ethnicity, and maternal obesity.
Several study limitations must be considered. First,
Danish and Swedish data were limited to births through 2010
and 2012, respectively. Second, to harmonize analyses across
countries, a consensus definition of clinician-initiated obstet-
ric intervention based on labor induction or prelabor/elective
cesarean delivery was applied to each country’
s birth register
or administrative (hospitalization) database; it is important to
recognize that this definition represents a proxy measure that
may not perfectly correspond to elective (vs emergency)
obstetric intervention. Comparable and reliable individual-
level data on maternal or fetal indications for early delivery
were not available. Known limitations of birth registry and
administrative data include the potential for underreporting,
overreporting, and misreporting obstetric interventions, with
varying attempts to assess these potential issues in the coun-
tries studied. Although perinatal data validation in Canada
found high (>89%) sensitivity and specificity for cesarean
delivery and induction of labor,34 the algorithm used in this
study to identify prelabor cesarean deliveries has not been
validated.
Validity of reporting of elective cesarean delivery and la-
bor induction has been assessed to some extent in the Nordic
birthregisters,whicharewidelyknownfortheirhighdataqual-
ity. Danish reports of cesarean delivery and labor induction
were found to have high positive predictive values, although
elective (prelabor) cesarean delivery has not been validated.35
ThelatestFinnishvalidationstudy(in1995)foundhighvalidity
for cesarean delivery but could not define validity for labor
induction.36 The latest Swedish validation study (in 2001)
found that classification of elective vs emergency cesarean de-
livery was adequate at term gestations but elective cesarean
delivery was overestimated for preterm; additional check-
boxes have subsequently been added to improve reporting.
Validity of the labor induction checkbox, which is marked at
the onset of delivery, has not been assessed.14 No validation
studies have been performed for the Norwegian Medical Birth
Register; however, checkboxes for labor inductions, as well as
emergencyandelectivecesareandeliveries,aresimilartothose
used in Sweden.
IntheUnitedStates,dataqualityconcernshavebeendocu-
mented when using vital records to ascertain obstetric
interventions.37,38 A recent study in 2 states based on the 2003
revised live birth certificate found high sensitivity but a 15%
to 20% false-positive rate for reports of trial of labor, and vari-
ability in accuracy of labor induction.37 US analyses were re-
stricted to births reporting on the 2003 revised live birth cer-
tificate, although sensitivity analyses indicated robustness of
the findings. Future population-based studies could be im-
proved by using birth certificate data augmented with pro-
spective individual-level data on indications for obstetric in-
tervention (eg, by linkage to medical records).39,40
Conclusions
Between2006and2014,latepretermandearlytermbirthrates
declined in the United States, and an association was ob-
served between early term birth rates and decreasing clinician-
initiated obstetric interventions. Late preterm births also de-
creased in Norway, and early term births decreased in Norway
and Sweden. Clinician-initiated obstetric interventions in-
creased in some countries but no association was found with
rates of late preterm or early term birth.
