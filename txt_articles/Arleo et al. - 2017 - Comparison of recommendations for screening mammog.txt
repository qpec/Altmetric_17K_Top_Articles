 Comparison of Recommendations for Screening
Mammography Using CISNET Models
Elizabeth Kagan Arleo, MD1; R. Edward Hendrick, PhD2; Mark A. Helvie, MD3; and Edward A. Sickles, MD4
BACKGROUND: Currently, there are several different recommendations for screening mammography from major national health care
organizations, including: 1) annual screening at ages 40 to 84 years; 2) screening annually at ages 45 to 54 years, then biennially at
ages 55 to 79 years; and 3) biennial screening at ages 50 to 74 years. METHODS: Mean values of six Cancer Intervention and Surveil-
lance Modeling Network (CISNET) models were used to compare these three screening mammography recommendations in terms of
benefits and risks. RESULTS: Mean mortality reduction was greatest with the recommendation of annual screening at ages 40 to 84
years (39.6%), compared with the hybrid recommendation of screening annually at ages 45 to 54 years, then biennially at ages 55 to
79 years (30.8%), and the recommendation of biennial screening at ages 50 to 74 years (23.2%). For a single-year cohort of US
women aged 40 years, assuming 100% compliance, more breast cancers deaths would be averted over their lifetime with annual
screening starting at age 40 (29,369) than with the hybrid recommendation (22,829) or biennial screening ages 50-74 (17,153 based
on 2009 CISNET estimates, 15,599 based on 2016 CISNET estimates). To achieve the greatest mortality benefit, this single-year cohort
of women would have the greatest total number of screening mammograms, benign recalls, and benign biopsies performed over the
course of screening by following annual screening starting at age 40 years (90.2 million, 6.8 million, and 481,269, respectively) than
by following the hybrid recommendation (49.0 million, 4.1 million, and 286,288, respectively) or biennial screening at ages 50 to 74
years (27.3 million, 2.3 million, and 162,885, respectively). CONCLUSION: CISNET models demonstrate that the greatest mortality
reduction is achieved with annual screening of women starting at age 40 years. Cancer 2017;123:3673-80. V

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer deaths are prevented by routine screening mammography, as evidenced by randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), mortality data from organized population-based screening programs, and international service screening experi-
ence.1 According to a meta-analysis of RCT data, the relative risk of dying from breast cancer was 20% less in women
invited to screening mammography compared with women who were not.2 National data from the Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute indicate that after the widespread introduction
of screening mammography in the late 1980s, the breast cancer death rate in the United States subsequently decreased by
37%,3 although this decline in death rate cannot entirely be attributed to screening. Among women who actually under-
went screening mammography, incidence-based mortality studies based on service screening data from Europe and Can-
ada have demonstrated a 38% to 40% decrease in breast cancer deaths,4,5 and case-control studies based on service
screening data from Europe and Australia have demonstrated a 48% to 49% decrease in breast cancer deaths.4,6
These RCTs, US population-based data, and international service screening data are not without their limitations,
however, including the use of older mammography technology and the issues of noncompliance and contamination, both
of which underestimate the benefit of current practice on women undergoing screening (RCTs), lack of information about
which women were actually screened (SEER population-based data), and differences in screening intervals and starting
ages (service screening).2,4,7-9 Computer models, although also not without limitations, attempt to rectify some of the
shortcomings of the data previously mentioned by applying consistent starting ages and screening intervals both within
and across various models. Under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health, which is part of the US Department of
Health and Human Services, the National Cancer Institute has funded the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Model-
ing Network (CISNET) to develop such models.10-12 In 2009 and 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) issued recommendations on screening for breast cancer, informed by reports from CISNET.13,14

 The purpose of this study was to use CISNET breast
cancer models to compare the three most widely discussed
current screening mammography recommendations for
women of average breast cancer risk: 1) annual screening
at ages 40 to 84 years (hereafter referred to as annual
screening starting at age 40 years); 2) annual screening at
ages 45 to 54 years, followed by biennial screening at ages
55 to 79 years; and 3) biennial screening at ages 50 to 74
years. Although CISNET itself has compared screening
strategies,12 it is precisely because the most recent CIS-
NET analysis involved only one of the three most widely
discussed strategies that the current study was performed.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We used the 2009 and 2015-2016 CISNET breast can-
cer–specific models (hereafter referred to as 2009 CIS-
NET and 2016 CISNET, respectively) to analyze the
implications of different screening recommendations,
including: 1) annual screening starting at age 40 years; 2)
annual screening at ages 45 to 54 years, followed by bien-
nial screening at ages 55 to 79 years; and 3) and biennial
screening at ages 50 to 74 years. Table 1 outlines the
screening recommendations of various organizations. The
methods CISNET used to develop their models are
detailed in a technical report published by the Agency for
Healthcare Quality and Research.11 In brief, CISNET
had six groups at different institutions develop indepen-
dent computer models with multiple input parameters
including estimates of breast cancer incidence, survival
trends with and without screening or adjuvant therapy,
mammography performance data from the Breast Cancer
Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), and breast cancer-
specific mortality data from the SEER Program. However,
the models are each different, and although estimates of
outcomes are somewhat similar, there are significant dif-
ferences among the six models, as well as inherent impre-
cision in models in general. For more details, the specific
model parameters and inputs can be found on the
CISNET website.15 All CISNET models assume 100%
adherence to screening and treatment. A factor that cannot
be controlled is the quality of diagnostic studies and treat-
ment; although high quality is assumed given mammogra-
phy requirements under the Mammography Quality
Standards Act and surgical and oncological standards, real-
istic variations might be expected.
CISNET quantified benefits in terms of breast cancer
deaths averted and life-years gained by screening per 1000
women based on a single-year cohort of US women: those
born in 1960 for 2009 CISNET and those born in 1970 for
2016 CISNET. Benefits in terms of lives saved, life-years
gained, and estimates of number needed to screen to avert a
breast cancer death assume follow-up over each woman’s
lifetime. We have extended 2009 CISNET to obtain abso-
lute numbers of women who would both benefit and experi-
ence risk from screening over the full age range specified for
the single birth-year cohort of U.S. women born in 1960
and alive in the year 2000 (2.468 million based on year
2000 US census data16). A woman born in 1960 and alive
in 2000 would be 40 years old and enter the age range that
screening begins for the first of the three screening strategies.
In our comparison of screening strategies, some women
begin screening at age 40 years, some at age 45 years, and
some at age 50 years, and all attend annually or biennially,
or a combination of the two, until screening ends. Benefits
are also stated in terms of numbers needed to screen (NNS)
to avert one breast cancer death and to gain 1 life-year for
each strategy. Use and risks of screening are quantified in
terms of numbers of mammograms, benign recalls (women
recalled from screening with no significant or nonmalignant
findings), and benign biopsies performed, both per 1000
women screened and in absolute numbers for that single
birth-year cohort. Because both CISNET modelers and the
USPSTF acknowledge that “methods for estimating overdi-
agnosis at a population level are not well established”12,14,17
and “Existing science does not allow for the ability to deter-
mine precisely what proportion of cancer diagnosed by

 mammography today reflects overdiagnosis, and estimates
vary widely depending on the data source and method of
calculation used,”11 the decision was made not to include
overdiagnosis in this study’s risk assessment. However,
unless breast cancers actually can regress and disappear
(which no one has ever observed for an invasive cancer found
by mammography), delaying the age at which screening is
started and extending the time between screens will have no
effect on “overdiagnosis”, since “overdiagnosed” cancers still
will be present at the age of 45 or 50 and still will be present
whether screening is annual or biennial.
CISNET estimates in 2009 considered annual and
biennial screening for a variety of starting and ending ages
(extending to age 84 years). For both annual and biennial
screening, by taking differences between 2009 CISNET
estimates over wider age ranges, we estimate benefits and
risks over a variety of age ranges, including those of the
three major models, including the hybrid recommenda-
tion of screening annually at ages 45 to 54 years, then
biennially at ages 55 to 79 years.
CISNET estimates in 2009 used 6 models to estimate
benefit, whereas only 1 model, their “exemplar” Stanford
model, was used to provide quantitative estimates of risks.
We report the mean benefits across all 6 models, weighing
each model equally. The first and second recommendations,
1) annual screening starting at age 40 years and 2) annual
screening at ages 45 to 54 years followed by biennial screen-
ing at ages 55 to 79 years, recommend that a healthy woman
continue screening until her life expectancy is less than 10
years (second recommendation) or less than 5-7 years (first
recommendation). Based on 2010 life expectancy tables,18
the average US woman’s life expectancy drops below 10
years at age 80 to 81 years and below 7 years at age 85 to 86
years. Based on these life expectancies, we estimate benefits
and risks using 2009 CISNET taking age 79 as the final
screening age for the average woman following the second
recommendation, and age 84 as the final screening age for
the average woman following the first recommendation.
2016 CISNET included 6 models to provide quanti-
tative estimates of benefits and risks. Estimates of benefits
and risks in 2016 CISNET were based on the single birth-
year cohort of US women born in 1970 and alive in the
year 2010 (2.197 million based on 2010 US census
data16). Compared with 2009 CISNET estimates, 2016
CISNET estimates involved a smaller number of annual,
biennial, and hybrid screening scenarios, with all scenarios
ending screening at age 74 years. Specifically, 2016 CIS-
NET assessed only one of the three currently considered
screening recommendations (the third), because all screen-
ing scenarios considered by 2016 CISNET ended screen-
ing at age 74 years, and because the only hybrid strategies
2016 CISNET considered transitioned from annual to
biennial screening at age 50 years, rather than the second
hybrid recommendation of transitioning from annual to
biennial screening at age 55 years. Because neither the sec-
ond hybrid nor the first recommendation is modeled by
2016 CISNET, we use 2009 CISNET models to compare
the three current recommendations for screening mam-
mography. We also compare CISNET 2009 and 2016
estimates of benefits and risks for the third screening rec-
ommendation of biennial screening of women ages 50 to
74 years. 2009 CISNET was based largely on screen-film
mammography performance, while 2016 CISNET was
based primarily on digital mammography performance. As
of June 1, 2016, 98% of the 16,042 mammography units
in the United States were digital mammography units.19
Statistical analyses were not performed because
assessing for statistical significance of differences was not
the objective of this study; rather, the goal was to quantify
the benefits and risks estimated by CISNET models and
our extension of CISNET models for the 3 major screen-
ing recommendations.

 screening recommendations based on 2009 CISNET
modeling.10 Table 2 demonstrates that the largest mean
mortality reduction is achieved with the first recommen-
dation of annual screening starting at age 40 years (39.6%
vs 30.8% for the second recommendation and 23.2% for
the third). Similarly, following the first recommendation
averts the most breast cancer deaths (11.9 per 1000
women screened, 29% more than the hybrid recommen-
dation and 71% more than the third recommendation)
and gains the most life-years (189 per 1000 women
screened vs 149 for the hybrid recommendation and 110
for the third recommendation).
Table 2 also demonstrates that the NNS per death
averted and the NNS per life-year gained (LYG) was
smallest—and therefore most efficacious—with the first
recommendation (NNS per death averted of 84 for the
first vs 108 for the hybrid and 144 for the third recom-
mendation; NNS per LYG of 5.3 for the first, 6.7 for the
hybrid, 9.1 for the third recommendation, respectively).
Table 3 shows the benefits of screening mammogra-
phy for the single-year cohort of women who turned 40
years old in 2000 and who followed each recommenda-
tion. If none of these women underwent screening mam-
mography, the 2009 CISNET estimates that from age
years 40, 3%,10 or approximately 74,000 women in this
single-year cohort of 2,468,000 women would die due to
breast cancer. Alternatively, if this cohort of women fol-
lowed the first recommendation of annual screening at
ages 40 to 84 years with 100% compliance, then 29,369
breast cancer deaths could be averted, a 39.6% mortality
reduction. This is 29% more deaths averted than by the
same group of women following the hybrid recommenda-
tion (22,829 deaths averted, a 30.8% mortality reduction)
and 71% more deaths averted than by the same group fol-
lowing the third recommendation (17,153 deaths averted,
a 23.2% mortality reduction). Likewise, the largest num-
ber of life-years would be gained if this single-year cohort
followed the first recommendation (466,452 LYG), 27%
more than if they followed the hybrid recommendation
(367,732 LYG), and 72% more than if they followed the
third recommendation (271,480 LYG).
Table 3 also shows the risks of screening mammog-
raphy in terms of recalls and benign biopsies for the
single-year cohort of women who turned 40 years old in
2000 and who followed each recommendation. The larg-
est number of screening mammograms, benign recalls,
and benign biopsies would occur under the first recom-
mendation, the smallest number under the third recom-
mendation, and an intermediate number under the
second (hybrid) recommendation. Based on these 2009
CISNET estimates, on average a woman getting annual
screening starting at age 40 could expect to be recalled
from screening for a benign diagnostic work-up once
every 13 years, and could expect to undergo a benign
biopsy once every 187 years. Benefit compared with risk is
shown in the last column of Table 3 in terms of LYG per
benign biopsy for each screening regimen. A woman get-
ting annual screening starting at age 40 could expect 1
LYG for every benign biopsy.
Table 4 compares 2009 and 2016 CISNET esti-
mates of benefit and risk for the third recommendation of
biennial screening at ages 50 to 74 years. Although 2016
benefit estimates are slightly higher than 2009 estimates
per 1000 women screened (9% higher for deaths averted,
10% higher for LYG) and benign recalls are 1% higher,
benign biopsies are estimated to be 121% higher based on
2016 CISNET than those based on 2009 CISNET. One
possible explanation is that 2009 estimates were based on
BCSC data for the more clinically relevant outcome of
biopsies actually performed, whereas 2016 estimates were
based on BCSC data for radiologists’ recommendations
for biopsy10-12; in other words, more biopsies are recom-
mended than are actually performed. Breast cancer deaths
averted for a single-year cohort by biennial screening at
ages 50 to 74 years are 17,153 based on 2009 CISNET,
which used the cohort of women born in 1960, and
15,599 based on 2016 CISNET, which used the cohort of
women born in 1970.10,12

 The number of women in the single-year cohort of
women born in 1960 who would still die from breast can-
cer given 100% compliance with screening, based on
2009 CISNET mean estimates, is 44,671 for the first
strategy, 51,211 for the second strategy, and 56,887 for
the third strategy.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to use CISNET breast can-
cer models to compare the three most widely discussed
current recommendations for screening mammography:
1) annual screening starting at age 40 years; 2) screening
annually at ages 45 to 54 years and biennially at ages 55 to
79 years; and 3) biennial screening at ages 50 to 74 years.
The principal finding is that mean mortality reduction is
greatest with the first recommendation of annual screening
starting at age 40 years (39.6%) compared with the hybrid
(30.8%) and third (23.2% based on 2009 CISNET,
26.6% based on 2016 CISNET) recommendations.
The primary value of analyzing 2016 CISNET
results is to compare these new results with 2009 CISNET
results to determine how CISNET estimates have
changed. There are three main differences between 2009
and 2016 CISNET. First, 2016 CISNET modeled only
one of the three major screening recommendations (bien-
nial screening at ages 50 to 74 years). The second (hybrid)
recommendation has women transitioning from annual
to biennial screening at age 55 years rather than age 50
years, and in our comparison, on average ending screening
at age 79 years rather than age 74 years; in our compari-
son, the first recommendation on average ends annual
screening at age 84 years rather than age 74 years. Hence,
2016 CISNET does not model benefits or risks for either
the first or second recommendation. It is important to
point out that just because the 6 2016 CISNET models
ended all screening strategies at age 74 years does not
mean that women age 75 years and older do not continue
to accrue benefits from screening mammography. In fact,
CISNET results demonstrate that, as CISNET itself
reports, “for women with no comorbidity who have an
average of a 17-year remaining life expectancy, screening
would be efficient through age 78 to 80 years,”11 and that
benefits exceed risks up to age 90 years.20
Second, CISNET changed its manner of calculating
benign biopsies between 2009 and 2016. 2009 CISNET
used BCSC data on the number of women actually under-
going benign biopsies, with positive predictive value
(PPV) based on biopsies performed (PPV3), whereas
2016 CISNET switched their definition to the number of
women recommended to undergo biopsy based on radiol-
ogy findings (PPV2).21 It is important to understand that
PPV3 (CISNET 2009) is based on biopsies actually per-
formed, which reflects actual health care delivery. As a
result of this change in their definition of “negative biop-
sies,” 2016 CISNET may substantially overestimate the
risk of benign biopsy. For example, using 2009 CISNET,
biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years was estimated
to yield 66 benign biopsies per 1000 women screened,
whereas 2016 CISNET estimated this number to be 146
(Table 4), 121% greater than the 2009 estimate. One can
only speculate on why CISNET changed its method of
estimating the number of benign biopsies. The number of
women biopsied is the clinically relevant number, reflect-
ing actual health care delivery, not the number of women
recommended for biopsy.
A third difference between 2009 and 2016 CISNET
involves the estimate of the number of women age �40
years who would die from breast cancer in the absence of
screening mammography. The 2009 CISNET estimated
median value for all 6 models was 3%, whereas the 2016
median value was 2.5% (range, 1.5%-3.2%)11; CISNET’s
rationale for this change is not fully explained. Effectively,
CISNET substantially increased their estimate of the
number of women who would benefit from treatment
(adjuvant therapy and surgery) alone. This recalls the per-
sistent conjecture in the literature that adjuvant therapy

The median values for all 6 models are compared for benefit. Risks of negative recalls and benign biopsies are from the single “exemplar” Stanford model in
2009 and from all 6 models in 2016. The median rather than the mean values are reported for all parameters because 2016 CISNET did not report deaths
averted per 1000 women screened for each of the 6 individual models.
a 2009 CISNET defined benign biopsies as the number of women undergoing benign biopsy, whereas 2016 CISNET changed their definition to the number of
women recommended to undergo biopsy based on radiologic findings.

 has eclipsed the importance of early detection, despite the
fact that numerous recent studies published demonstrate
decreased breast cancer–specific deaths associated with
invitation or exposure to screening mammography com-
pared with women not invited or not attending screen-
ing.4,5,22-28 Evaluations of service screening programs
have shown substantial mortality reductions in women
exposed to screening compared with those not exposed to
screening, with some studies going to great lengths to
show that access to and quality of treatment was homoge-
neous across the comparison groups.23 For example,
Tabar et al28 compared mortality reductions over time in
exposed and unexposed women, showing that there was
some improvement in deaths avoided due to modern ther-
apy, but it was substantially less than deaths avoided by
exposure to screening in combination with modern ther-
apy; these estimates included interval cancers in the group
exposed to screening who did not have their breast cancer
diagnosed by screening. This study was unique in that it
compared mortality reductions in unexposed women over
the time period before and after the introduction of adju-
vant therapy.28 In these observational studies where
women had access to the same therapies, there were fewer
deaths among women who had access to screening, and
even fewer among women who participated in screening,
despite access to the same therapies. A recent CISNET
analysis estimates that annual screening would account for
the great majority (69%-74%) of breast cancer mortality
reduction in the United States at full compliance.29
Estimates of the number of women in the single-
year cohort who would still die from breast cancer given
100% implementation of each of the 3 screening guide-
lines (44,671 with the first screening strategy, 51,211
with the second strategy, and 56,887 with the third strat-
egy) highlight the need to improve breast screening,
whether with mammography or another modality.
It is also of value to consider 2009 CISNET risk
data from the individual woman’s perspective and to
highlight how frequently she is likely to experience “risks.”
Specifically, data in Table 3 show that if a woman born in
1960 and alive in the year 2000 underwent annual screen-
ing starting at age 40, then on average she could expect to
be recalled for a benign diagnostic workup once every
13.3 screening examinations or approximately once every
13 years. Following that same screening recommendation,
she could expect on average to undergo a benign biopsy
once every 187 screening examinations, and therefore be
unlikely to undergo a benign biopsy during an entire life-
time of annual screening. These risks are considerably
lower than most women have expressed willingness to
accept. For example, in an attitudinal study of 479 US
women, Schwartz et al30 found that “women were highly
tolerant of false positives: 63% thought that 500 or more
false positives per life saved was reasonable and 37%
would tolerate 10,000 or more.”30 On a related note,
according to a study by Tosteson et al,31 “false-positive
mammograms were associated with increased short-term
anxiety but not long-term anxiety, and there was no mea-
surable health utility decrement.” That study also found
that false-positive mammograms actually increased a
woman’s intention to undergo future screening and that
most women would not drive any extra distance for
screening with a lower likelihood of false-positives. Addi-
tionally, Table 3 shows that for annual screening starting
at age 40, CISNET models estimated that 1 life-year
would be saved for each benign biopsy experienced. One
does not need an attitudinal survey to conclude that
almost all women would be willing to undergo a benign
biopsy to extend their life by 1 year.
The second screening strategy, in which women
screen annually at ages 45 to 54 years and transition to
biennial screening at age 55 years, is a hybrid of the first
and third recommendations with respect to frequency and
starting age. Of note, the current American College of
Radiology/Society of Breast Imaging (first) recommenda-
tion is the former American Cancer Society guideline,
with the exception of a shorter estimated longevity as a
stopping age. Although one might suggest that this new
(second) hybrid recommendation has outcomes very simi-
lar to those of the first recommendation, but with risks
much closer to those of the third recommendation, our
analysis based on 2009 CISNET demonstrates otherwise.
Specifically, the benefits of mortality reduction and LYG
for the (second) hybrid recommendation are approxi-
mately halfway between those of the first and third recom-
mendations (Tables 2 and 3). Similarly, the estimated
risks of benign recalls and benign biopsies for the (second)
hybrid
recommendation
are
approximately
halfway
between those of the first and third recommendations
(Table 3). Although the second strategy models the ACS
“strong” recommendation of annual screening at ages 45
to 54 years and biennial screening at ages 55 to 79 years,
an ACS “qualified” recommendation states that “women
should have the opportunity to begin annual screening
between the ages of 40 and 44 years.”1 Based on 2009
CISNET, starting annual screening at age 40 years instead
of age 45 years would increase mean mortality reduction
from 30.8% to 32.7%, mean LYG from 149 to 163 per
1,000 women screened, and mean lives saved in the
single-year cohort born in 1960 from 22,829 to 24,063.

 Another ACS “qualified” recommendation is that women
55 years and older should have the opportunity to con-
tinue screening annually. Annual screening from age 55 to
79 years instead of biennial screening would increase
mean mortality reduction from 23.5% to 28.3%, increase
mean LYG from 97 to 118 per 1000 women screened,
and mean lives saved in the single-year cohort from
17,399 to 20,978. Annual screening from age 40 to 79
years would result in both benefits and risks much closer
to those of the first recommendation. We modeled the
strongly recommended ACS hybrid strategy because it is
widely discussed both in the medical and lay press. The
“qualified” ACS recommendation supports more fre-
quent and earlier onset screening that closely matches the
American College of Radiology, American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Comprehen-
sive Cancer Center Network, and Society of Breast Imag-
ing recommendations. It is important to note that the
ACS recommendations include the possibility of starting
annual screening at age 40 years and undergoing annual
rather than biennial screening after age 54 years, and that
many women will likely choose to go beyond their mini-
mum recommendation.
Just as RCTs, US population–based trends, and
international service screening studies have their limita-
tions, computer models have their own limitations. Mod-
els are a way to try to predict what might happen, but
their outcomes depend heavily on their assumptions. If
assumptions are incorrect or uncertain, then the validity of
the results is less certain. Two CISNET models make the
assumption that invasive breast cancers may fail to pro-
gress11; however, extremely few cases of nonprogressive
invasive breast cancer have been reported in the literature.
One of the 6 models did not include DCIS at all, which is
known to be a nonobligate precursor to invasive cancer.11
Additionally, BCSC data used by CISNET considered
screening within 9 and 18 months of a previous screening
examination as “annual,” whereas screening between 18
and 30 months of a previous screening examination was
considered
“biennial”
screening;
therefore,
biennial
encompasses 3 more months than annual,32 potentially
biasing “biennial” screening to detect more cancers. Other
limitations include the assumption that all women adhere
to each stated screening and treatment, rather than the
variable adherence occurring in the real world.
We did not model overdiagnosis because of the wide
range of frequency estimates reported in the literature and
low level of reliability given to those estimates.17 However,
our extensive clinical experience with modern mammogra-
phy indicates that screen-detected cancers (including
overdiagnosed cancers), if not removed and left untreated,
remain visible and suspicious for malignancy at next screen-
ing examination, so that a strategy involving less screening
simply delays overdiagnosis but does not reduce it. There-
fore, the frequency of both overdiagnosis and overtreatment
likely are unaffected by the age at which screening starts (40
versus 45 versus 50) or by screening frequency.
In their concluding summary, CISNET authors state
that “Choices about optimal ages of initiation and cessa-
tion will ultimately depend on program goals.”11 If the
screening program goal is to perform as few mammograms
as possible to achieve limited benefit and fewer risks, with
number of mammograms as a surrogate for cost, then the
optimal age of initiation may be 50 years with an optimal
frequency of biennial screening ending at age 74 years. On
the other hand, if the goal is to avert the most breast cancer
deaths and gain the most life-years, CISNET modeling
shows that the optimal age of initiation for screening mam-
mography is 40 years, the optimal screening frequency is
annual, and the optimal stopping age is when a woman’s
life expectancy is less than 5 to 7 years. Individual women
should continue to have the choice to reduce their risk of
dying from breast cancer as much as possible, and as CIS-
NET models show, annual mammography starting at age
40 years is the best way to do so.
