Abstract 
Objective. To examine the issues of primary care access and foregone health care among 
transgender adolescents and young adults.
Methods. This cross-sectional analysis of data from the Canadian Trans Youth Health Survey was 
conducted online during 2013–2014. Participants included 923 youth aged 14–25 (323 adolescents 
aged 14–18 and 600 young adults aged 19–25). Main outcome measures were self-reported general 
and mental health status, comfort discussing transgender identity and health care needs with 
general practitioners, and types of and reasons for self-identified foregone health care.
Results. Most youth reported poor/fair general and mental health status. Comfort with a family 
doctor was positively correlated with both general health (r(528) = 21, P < 0.001) and mental health 
(r(450) = 26, P < 0.001) status, as was having a doctor who was aware of one’s transgender status. 
47
.2% (n = 219) of young adults reported foregoing needed health care. Among adolescents, levels 
of comfort with family doctor were negatively correlated with foregone mental health care in the 
previous 12 months (F3,166 = 3.829, P = 0.011), but not correlated with foregone physical health care 
(F3,165 = 0.506, P = 0.679). Reasons for missing needed care spanned the dimensions of health care 
access, ranging from cost barriers to previous negative experiences with health care providers, 
and concerns that a doctor would be uneducated about transgender people.
Conclusion. General practitioners can play a key role in improving the health of transgender youth 
by demonstrating understanding of the health care needs of transgender youth and competence in 
gender-affirming care, and by ensuring that their practices are accessible to all transgender youth 
in need of care.

Introduction
Transgender adolescents and young adults are at increased risk for 
many negative health outcomes, including depression, anxiety and 
suicide (1,2). Research has documented that transgender adults and 
cisgender (non-transgender) adolescents may experience barriers to 
health care, and that foregone care is associated with poorer physical 
and mental health outcomes (3–5). Barriers to medical care experi-
enced by transgender adults range from negative past experiences 
with doctors to outright denial of care by clinicians (4,6,7). Existing 
studies with general adolescent populations indicate that young peo-
ple may forego health care for stigmatized needs (e.g. mental health) 
(8) or if they are members of stigmatized populations (e.g. gay, les-
bian, bisexual) (9).
North American youth are disclosing transgender identities in 
greater numbers and at earlier ages, leading to growing recognition of 
the need for gender-affirming care in childhood and adolescence (10).

 Transgender youth may experience barriers to accessing necessary pri-
mary, endocrine and mental health care. However, issues of primary 
care access and foregone care among transgender young people have 
remained unexamined, even as general practitioners are increasingly 
called upon to provide non-specialist transgender care for adolescents 
and adults, often without sufficient training (11–13).
Objective
The objective of this study was to examine issues of primary care 
access and foregone health care among transgender adolescents and 
young adults, using data from the Canadian Trans Youth Health 
Survey (14).
Method
The Canadian Trans Youth Health Survey was conducted online in 
English and French from 1 October 2013 to 31 May 2014. Institutional 
ethics approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia, 
University of Winnipeg and Dalhousie University. Canadian youth aged 
14–25 who self-identified as transgender or genderqueer were recruited 
through a national network of health professionals and investigators 
across Canada, transgender youth advisory council members, commu-
nity organizations, social media and online advertising. The lower age 
limit of 14 corresponds with an age at which youth are allowed to 
consent to health care in many Canadian provinces and territories; age 
25 reflects the upper age limit for youth-focused transgender health 
services. Due to the unknown population size and anonymous nature 
of the survey, response rate could not be calculated.
Survey design
The survey included questions about health and health care expe-
riences drawn from existing population health surveys. Adolescents 
(aged 14–18) responded to questions primarily drawn from the 
British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (BCAHS) (15), and young 
adults (aged 19–25) were given questions drawn from the Canadian 
Community Health Survey (CCHS) (16). All youth reported their 
general health using an item originally from the 36-Item Short Form 
Health Survey (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent) (17) and simi-
lar questions from the BCAHS and CCHS addressed general mental 
health status (poor, fair, good, excellent) of adolescents and young 
adults, respectively. All participants were asked to rate their level of 
comfort discussing their transgender status and transgender-specific 
health care needs with their family doctor (very uncomfortable, 
uncomfortable, comfortable, very comfortable) using questions from 
the Trans PULSE study (6). Questions regarding reasons for foregone 
health care were based on items from the BCAHS. Participants were 
invited to provide free-text responses at several points throughout the 
survey, including when they selected ‘other’ from a list of options and 
at the end of a survey section. The following open-ended questions 
elicited the majority of responses related to health care access: (i) If 
you have never taken hormones, which best describes your situation? 
[other] (ii) Thinking of the most recent time, why didn’t you get care? 
[other]; (iii) Anything else you want to tell us about your health that 
we didn’t ask about?; (iv) Is there anything else you’d like to tell us?
Participants
A total of 923 youth responded to the survey (mean age: 20.0, 
SD 3.03), including 323 adolescents and 600 young adults. Of 
the 923 total participants, 531 (61%) completed the entire sur-
vey. All Canadian provinces were represented in the sample and 
the distribution of participants across the country was representa-
tive of the general population. Almost three-quarters (73.9%) of 
participants identified their ethnicity as white, 10.2% Indigenous 
(which included First Nations, Inuit and Métis), 6.0% East Asian 
or Southeast Asian, 1.8% West Asian or Arab, 1.7% Black, 1.3% 
Latino, 1.3% South Asian and 3.8% other or multiracial. Of 
respondents, 90.7% lived in urban and suburban areas and 9.3% 
lived in rural settings. When participants were given a choice among 
three gender identity response options, 16.6% identified as trans-
feminine, 42.4% as transmasculine and 41.0% as non-binary. One 
hundred and two additional comments related to health care access 
were provided in free-text boxes by 98 participants.
Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0. Differences in 
prevalence were assessed using chi-square tests and relationships 
between ordinal variables were assessed using Pearson’s correlation 
coefficients. There were two types of missing data: from participants 
who chose to not answer a specific question and those who termi-
nated the survey before reaching the survey’s end (n = 392 premature 
terminations). Missing data were handled on a question by ques-
tion basis; participant responses to the questions they answered were 
included in the analyses even if they had skipped other questions or 
did not persist to the end of the survey. Free-text responses related to 
health care access and foregone care were analysed using qualitative 
content analysis, with Penchansky and Thomas’ five dimensions of 
health care access (18) serving as a conceptual framework.
Results
Family doctors
The majority of respondents had a regular family doctor (70.3%); 
however, almost half used walk-in clinics as their main source of 
health care (44.3%). Approximately half of youth with a family doc-
tor reported that their doctor knew about their transgender iden-
tity or experience (52.6%), while 8.5% were not sure. Participants 
were asked to rate their level of comfort discussing their transgender 
status and transgender-specific health care needs (scale 0–3, very 
uncomfortable, uncomfortable, comfortable, very comfortable) with 
a new doctor [M(SD) = 0.91(0.838)] and with their family doctor 
[M(SD) = 1.29(1.028)], if they had one.
Health status
Participants rated their general health on a 5-point scale (0 mini-
mum–4 maximum) (M = 1.77; SD = 0.958) and their mental health 
on a 4-point scale (0 minimum–3 maximum) (M = 0.96; SD = 0.795). 
Comfort discussing transgender status and related health care needs 
with one’s family doctor was positively correlated with both gen-
eral health (r528 = 0.21, P < 0.001) and mental health (r450 = 0.26, 
P < 0.001). Participants who responded that their transgender iden-
tity or experience was known by their doctor reported better general 
health than those who indicated their doctor was unaware, or were 
unsure if their doctor knew (F2,525 = 8.405, P < 0.001). Youth who 
reported their doctors knew they were transgender also had higher 
overall mental health scores than those whose doctors did not know 
(F2,444 = 5.234, P < 0.01).
Foregone care
More adolescent respondents reported foregoing needed mental 
health care in the last 12 months (68.4%, n = 162) than foregoing 
needed physical health care (33.5%, n = 79). Among adolescents,

 levels of comfort with family doctor were negatively correlated with 
foregone mental health care in the previous 12 months (F3,166 = 3.829, 
P < 0.05), but not correlated with foregone physical health care. 
A broad range of barriers to care were selected by adolescents as 
reasons for foregoing both physical and mental health care (Table 1). 
Among young adults, 47.2% (n = 219) reported foregoing needed 
health care at least once in the previous 12 months. The type of care 
most often missed was treatment of an emotional or mental health 
problem (Table 2).
Dimensions of health care accessibility
The responses reported in Table 1 indicated reasons for forgone 
care that potentially fell within each of the five dimensions of 
health care accessibility: availability, affordability, appropriate-
ness, approachability and acceptability (18). Participants’ free-text 
responses expanded on these reasons for foregone care, clearly map-
ping onto all five dimensions. For example, care being unavailable 
in the respondent’s area, or only with unacceptably long waiting 
periods, illustrated failures of availability leading to foregone care. 
Availability assessments are somewhat subjective, as there was no 
standardized metric provided in the survey regarding how far was 
too far or how long was too long; rather these statements reflected 
the participants’ perception that care was unavailable to them. The 
CCHS, which similarly allows respondents to self-define how long 
a wait is too long, or what makes an appointment too difficult to 
get to, found that ‘waiting too long’ was the most common reason 
reported by Canadians aged 15 and older for having difficulty access-
ing health care (19); therefore, it is not surprising that transgender 
youth would report similar challenges.
Related to availability barriers, foregone care due to costs or lack 
of time indicated issues of affordability. Canadian youth are able to 
access medical services (e.g. primary care and endocrinology appoint-
ments) through a single-payer health care system. However, costs 
for mental health services (e.g. psychologist), travel to appointments 
and prescription medications are not universally covered. Youth may 
have these costs paid through extended (private) health insurance 
or through government programs for those with lower income or 
disability. While policy is in place to cover medical services deemed 
essential, this does not ensure that there are providers trained to 
offer needed gender-affirming health care in all geographic areas. In 
our study, barriers related to care availability and affordability were 
described by several participants. Rural and remote youth in particu-
lar described transportation barriers to accessing care that was only 
available in urban areas. Costs related to medical care contributed 
to some youth foregoing care or employing substitutes for care (e.g. 
obtaining unprescribed hormones). One 17-year-old transmasculine 
respondent described responding to such barriers with illicit medica-
tion sharing among youth as an ad hoc harm-reduction strategy:
I gave what was left in my vial (~7 ml) to a FTM acquaintance 
who was getting it [testosterone] off the streets. There’s no way 
he’d stop (he has a rough time with being misgendered at school) 
and this way I know it’s clean and pure. I think the philosophy is 
called risk management or something, kinda similar to safe injec-
tion sites: if you can’t get them to stop, at least make it safe for 
them.
Youth also described many past negative care encounters, indicating 
diverse, widespread experiences with inappropriate and inadequate 
care. A 19-year-old transfeminine youth described frequent interac-
tions with walk-in clinic doctors who were unfamiliar with appro-
priate transgender care:
On the subject of walk-in doctors. . . . I feel uncomfortable 
because almost consistently, the older doctors I see looking to get 
a refill on my [hormone therapy] don’t understand what being 
trans is, and will treat me with skepticism and concern, some-
times refusing to give pills at all because they were never trained 
in trans issues.
Uncomfortable and frustrating encounters with doctors were com-
mon in this population, and participants described a variety of 
informal methods of sharing information regarding how to obtain 
appropriate care, with peer-to-peer information exchange filling 
gaps left by formal systems. A 24-year-old non-binary respondent 
explained, “Many resources about accessing health as a Trans* per-
son I find through peer support or online. Almost never through 
public health sectors or government facilities”.
Past experiences of unacceptable or inappropriate care some-
times led to ongoing barriers related to approachability. Clinicians 
who lacked knowledge regarding transgender issues were perceived 
as unapproachable, and fears regarding care being non-confidential 
or inadequate implied a lack of acceptability. A 17-year-old trans-
masculine youth volunteered the following explanation of their fore-
gone care due to past experiences with their doctor:
I’m very uncomfortable around my doc right now because she 
didn’t know anything about trans people and I’ve been on [testos-
terone] long enough to pass as male.
A 20-year-old non-binary youth similarly described their experiences 
with lack of approachability and accessibility, explaining that long

 wait times and lack of a sense of allyship from health care providers 
could become life-threatening:
In my own experience the system seems more like it’s designed to 
gate keep people than it is to help them. By the time I get cleared 
to have the surgery I need, it may be too late. I’m afraid that I’ll 
take my life before I can get the surgery to help me, because it’s 
such an arduous and unnecessarily difficult path. I just want to 
live.
Conclusion
Poor self-rated health has been identified as a strong predictor of 
mortality, especially among young people (24). Our findings indicate 
that Canadian transgender youth are reporting health status levels 
that are lower than general Canadian youth populations, with a 
mean of 1.77 using a 5-point scale (0–4). In contrast, 87% of ado-
lescents aged 12–19 in British Columbia reported good or excellent 
health, while 13% reported their health status as poor or fair (15), 
findings that are consistent with a national survey in which 95.8% 
of Canadian youth rated their health as good, very good or excel-
lent, the remainder (4.2%) reporting poor or fair health (25). On a 
2013 survey of British Columbia youth aged 12–19, 6% of males 
and 10% of females reported foregoing needed medical care within 
the past year (15), while Canadian transgender youth in this study 
reported higher rates of foregone health care (e.g. 33.5% of adoles-
cents foregoing physical health care).
In general, we found that transgender adolescents’ and young 
adults’ health status is related to comfort with their doctors. Lack of 
comfort with and confidence in the transgender competency of phy-
sicians (13) may lead some transgender youth to forego needed care, 
and particularly to leave mental health needs unmet. Despite the 
Canadian Medical Association passing resolutions in 2014 and 2015 
in support of ‘accessible, comprehensive and high-quality care for 
transgender patients’ (21), ‘integration of sex/gender diversity educa-
tion into medical school curricula and programs’ (22) and ‘develop-
ment of clinical tools’ (23) to help physicians and medical students 
better understand LBGT health needs, Canadian medical schools 
provide a median of 4 hours in pre-clinical education and 0 hours of 
clinical education on the entirety of LGBT topics (20). It is therefore 
not surprising that many clinicians may be unskilled, unknowledge-
able or uncomfortable providing health care for transgender youth.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first national population survey of transgender youth 
known to document foregone health care and barriers to access-
ing care. Mixed methods study design allowed for triangulation of 
findings. The size of the transgender youth population in Canada 
is undocumented; therefore, the representativeness of our sample is 
unknown. The proportion of transfeminine participants was smaller 
than might be expected, possibly reflecting the impact on restric-
tive masculine gender norms on the ability of transfeminine youth 
to come out and to access gender affirming services. Online survey 
administration may have contributed to non-response bias (e.g. 
safety concerns due to lack of private internet access; limited inter-
net access to due socioeconomic status or geographic location), and 
recruitment through transgender health care providers may have 
skewed the sample toward youth with greater health care access. The 
strategy to reduce this bias included advertising through clinical and 
community settings, as well as social media in order to reach rural 
youth and those not connected with care providers.
Recommendations
According to the current standards of care from the 
World Professional 
Association of Transgender Health (26), provision of gender-affirm-
ing care (e.g. prescribing and monitoring endocrine therapy) is within 
the scope of general practitioners. Meeting the health care needs of 
trans youth will require both awareness on the part of general prac-
titioners and acquisition of the competencies necessary to provide 
accessible gender-affirming care for this population. Improvements 
in clinical training and clinical practice tools could ameliorate some 
of the issues transgender youth described as diminishing the avail-
ability, appropriateness, approachability and acceptability of health 
care they had attempted to access. Technology such as telehealth may 
improve availability and affordability for youth living outside urban 
centres, while policy solutions are necessary to address affordability 
gaps for mental health and pharmaceutical care. Opportunities for 
continuing medical education are expanding through professional 
associations (e.g. World Professional Association for Transgender 
Health, Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health), 
conferences (e.g. Gender Odyssey, Philadelphia Trans Health 
Conference) and health care organisations (e.g. The Fenway Institute, 
UCSF Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, Rainbow Health 
Ontario, Trans Care BC).
General practitioners can play a key role in improving the health 
of transgender youth by demonstrating understanding of the health 
care needs of transgender youth and competence in gender-affirming 
care, and by ensuring that their practices are accessible to all transgen-
der youth in need of care. Given the discomfort youth report around 
disclosing their transgender identities and discussing their health care 
needs, trained gender-affirming practitioners may address these barri-
ers through steps such as adopting gender-inclusive intake forms and 
discussing gender in a manner that is inclusive of transgender and 
non-binary identities. Future research should include surveying youth 
in other countries and obtaining larger sample sizes to allow for more 
in-depth analysis related to urban versus rural locations, regional var-
iations and cultural groups experiencing intersecting health-related 
barriers. Interventions to improve general practitioner competencies 
and health care accessibility should be evaluated in terms of their 
impact on health status, comfort with general practitioners, foregone 
care and the dimensions of health care accessibility.
