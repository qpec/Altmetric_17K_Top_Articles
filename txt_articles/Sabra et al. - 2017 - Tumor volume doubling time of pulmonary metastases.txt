BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to better characterize the association between overall survival (OS) from metastat-
ic thyroid cancer and the rate of structural disease progression. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the average tumor volume
doubling time (midDT) of 2 dominant lung metastases was used to group patients into 6 clinically relevant cohorts. OS was calculat-
ed from the time of metastasis diagnosis and from the time the pulmonary lesions crossed over the 1-cm diameter threshold.
RESULTS: The tumor growth rate was remarkably constant in lung metastases from thyroid cancer over a median follow-up of 8.5
years (median correlation coefficient, 0.92; coefficient of determination, 0.85). Patients with a midDT �1 year were found to have
worse OS compared with those with a higher midDT (log-rank P 5.01). The 5-year OS rate from the 1-cm diameter time point was
20% for patients with a midDT �1 year (15 patients), 50% for patients with a midDT of 1 to 2 years (19 patients), 53% for patients with
a midDT of 2 to 3 years (9 patients), 80% for patients with a midDT of 3 to 4 years (6 patients), and 80% for patients with a midDT of
�4 years or who were negative (12 patients). Within the group of patients with a midDT �1 year, the 2-year OS rate from the 1-cm
diameter point was 88% in the patients treated with multikinase inhibitors (8 patients) versus 43% in the nontreated group
(7 patients) (P 5.13). CONCLUSIONS: The midDT of lung metastases appears to be a good prognostic indicator of OS in patients with
metastatic thyroid cancer. Unlike the thyroglobulin DT, the midDT alone can be used to predict eligibility for multikinase inhibitor
therapy. Cancer 2017;123:2955-64. V

INTRODUCTION
The development of distant metastases in follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma is associated with poor clinical out-
comes, particularly in older patients. Reported 10-year overall survival (OS) rates of approximately 50% are noted among
patients who present with distant metastases at presentation whereas the median progression-free survival is only 3.7 years
after the identification of distant metastases.1,2 Better outcomes have been described in young patients with small-volume
radioactive iodine (RAI)-avid pulmonary metastases,3 whereas a variety of clinical factors including aggressive tumor his-
tology, marked [18F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, poor RAI avidity, older age, larger volume metastases, and metastatic
foci outside the lungs have been associated with much poorer clinical outcomes.2-6
Although these various clinicopathological risk factors provide some insight into the likely course of disease progres-
sion, they cannot accurately predict the rate of structural disease progression or progression-free survival within an individ-
ual patient. Previous studies have demonstrated that initial risk stratification estimates can be significantly improved when
data accumulated during follow-up are used to modify risk estimates over time.7,8 For example, Miyauchi et al demon-
strated that the doubling time (DT) of serum thyroglobulin values (TgDT) obtained during follow-up was a powerful pre-
dictor of locoregional disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and disease-specific survival.9
Although serum Tg values reflect total body disease burden, it is the size of the metastatic lesions and the rate of
structural disease progression that are used to define if and when clinicians should consider the initiation of systemic thera-
pies. We recognized that patient survival is the product of the tumor burden and tumor growth rate. In that equation, we
believe that the tumor growth rate is a stronger indicator of survival than the tumor burden itself. Thus, larger tumors that
are stable are unlikely to cause a patient’s death, whereas smaller tumors with a rapid growth curve are more likely to lead

 to a bad outcome. Therefore, it is important to define the
tumor growth rate for any individual patient to more pre-
cisely predict clinical outcomes so that systemic therapy
can be offered to the appropriate patient at the appropri-
ate time. From a clinical standpoint, it would be helpful
to know the anticipated OS from both 1) the time of dis-
covery of the distant metastases and 2) the time that the
pulmonary nodule crossed the 1-cm diameter boundary
commonly used as the minimal threshold required to ini-
tiate systemic therapy.
Measuring tumor growth rate traditionally has been
performed using either Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors (RECIST) in clinical trials or using changes
in tumor diameter over a specific period of time in clinical
practice. Alternatively, growth rate can be defined based
on the time needed for a tumor to double over time, here-
in referred to as doubling time (DT). DT assumes that
tumor growth is constant overtime. It can be measured
based on tumor diameters or volume. RECIST have not
been validated in clinical practice. Because the growth of
metastatic lesions is associated with an increase in tumor
volume rather than a unidimensional increase in size, and
because tumor structural progression usually demon-
strates a pattern of exponential growth that remains con-
stant over time until large burdens of disease are achieved,
we chose to define the tumor growth rate as tumor volume
DT, which can be presented visually as straight lines on a
semi-log graph.10-13 Therefore, the primary objective of
the current study was to determine the rate of structural
disease progression (as measured by tumor volume DT)
in
patients
with
lung
metastasis
from
follicular
cell-derived thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that the
tumor volume DT (TVDT) of the metastatic tumor foci
would remain constant over time and be a significant pre-
dictor of OS for individual patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approv-
al, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 199 patients
with follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer presenting with
pulmonary metastases identified either at the time of diag-
nosis or during follow-up. These patients were followed at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 1992
and 2016. Their clinical characteristics previously were
described in a prior study.2 All patients were treated with
total thyroidectomy and RAI ablation at the time of their
thyroid cancer diagnosis. Patients received repeat RAI
therapies and/or repeat surgery and/or external beam
radiotherapy to the neck and/or bone metastasis and/or
multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapies during the course
of follow-up and then at the discretion of their treating
physician.
To accurately measure lung volume DTs, we includ-
ed patients with �1 measurable lung lesions on at least 4
consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans of the
chest. For patients who initiated MKI therapy, DTs were
calculated before the initiation of MKI therapy.
We excluded patients with the following: 1) anaplas-
tic or medullary thyroid cancer; 2) inadequate follow-up;
3) nonmeasurable disease (nodules measuring < 5 mm
and stable or decreasing in size with time, nodules that
were not clearly demarcated at the time of diagnosis or
with follow-up, or nodules obscured by effusions); 4)
age < 18 years at the time of diagnosis of metastatic
thyroid cancer; 5) concomitant second primary cancer; or
6) chronic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation.
Of 199 potential patients, 88 ultimately were included in
the current study.
Evaluation of Lung Nodules
We included any measurable lung lesion, even those mea-
suring <1 cm. When > 1 nodule was present (85 of 88
patients), we measured the 2 largest measurable lung
lesions on serial CT.
Standard-dose CT images were acquired using spiral
CT scanners. Over the years, the collimation used for each
CT varied as the technology field advanced. To avoid vari-
ability in the measurements over the years, we selected a
CT slice thickness of 5 mm for determining nodule sizes.
All the nodules were measured by 1 physician (M.M.S.).
Measurements were made using the same picture archiv-
ing and communication system (PACS) workstation.
Longitudinal and transverse measurements were obtained
by manually positioning electronic calipers on the CT
image that demonstrated the largest detectable size of the
selected nodule. Assuming that each metastatic nodule is
ellipsoid in shape, we then calculated the tumor volume
(in mL) for each nodule at each given time point using the
following formula: p/6 longest diameter 3 smallest diam-
eter 3 smallest diameter.
Laboratory Studies
Suppressed Tg levels were collected if obtained within 3
months of the nodules’ measurements. Tg levels were not
recorded if: 1) they were measured outside the 3-month
window; 2) interfering anti-Tg levels were concomitantly
measured; or 3) the associated TSH level was >5 mIU/L.

 Recorded Tg levels were standardized to the International
Standard CRM-457 reference preparation.
DT Measurements
Using the same concept previously used by Miyauchi et al
to define TgDT,9 and assuming that changes in tumor
volume are exponential (as shown below), we computed a
regression line, log y 5 log a 1 bx, using a nonlinear
square regression with “x” defined as time (in years) after
the initial CT chest scan and “y” defined as tumor vol-
ume. TVDT was calculated as (log 2)/b. We then calculat-
ed the average TVDT for each given patient (referred to
herein as midDT) using the average of the calculated
TVDTs of the 2 selected nodules.
We then calculated the TgDT for each patient with
metastatic thyroid cancer using at least 3 consecutive Tg
levels obtained within a 3-month window of the nodules’
measurements. We then correlated the midDT and
TgDT.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous data are presented as means and standard
deviations or as median and ranges, as appropriate for
each variable.
The first objective of the current study was to prove
that tumor growth is exponential and constant over time.
For this purpose, we analyzed the measured tumor vol-
umes for each given nodule over time. A total of 146
structurally progressive nodules were included in this
analysis. We calculated the correlation coefficient (r)
and the coefficient of determination (r2) for each given
nodule.
The second objective was to determine whether the
TVDT of the lung metastases could predict OS from met-
astatic differentiated thyroid cancer. Based on previously
defined Tg and calcitonin DT prognostic breakpoints, we
grouped patients into 6 clinically relevant groups based on
their midDT: those with a midDT �1 years, those with a
midDT of 1 to 2 years, those with a midDT of 2 to 3
years, those with a midDT of 3 to 4 years, those with a
midDT of �4 years, and those with a negative
midDT.9,14,15 For this analysis, we grouped those patients
with a midDT >4 years and those with a negative midDT
together. Using Kaplan Meir survival analysis and
log-rank testing, we calculated OS both from: 1) the diag-
nosis of the lung metastases and 2) from the time the larg-
est nodule was 1 cm to estimate survival from the earliest
time point that patients were likely to be considered for
entry in a clinical trial.
We then grouped patients according to their TgDT:
those with a TgDT �1 year, those with a TgDT of 1 to 2
years, those with a TgDT of 2 to 3 years, those with a
TgDT of 3 to 4 years, and those with a TgDT of �4 years
or negative. We repeated the OS analysis from the time
the lung metastases diagnosis was established, and then
from the 1-cm measurement time point.
Few patients with RAI-refractory (RAIR), structur-
ally progressive, metastatic thyroid cancer were treated
with MKI therapy alone or in combination with RAI. We
were interested in determining whether patients with
shorter structural DTs benefited from MKI therapy,
when offered, irrespective of the drug (s) used and the esti-
mated response to that therapy. For each midDT group,
we examined the effect of MKI therapy effect on their OS
using Kaplan-Meir survival curves and log-rank analyses.
Because patients with a midDT �1 year who were
treated with MKI therapy appeared to have a survival ben-
efit compared with those who were not treated, we then
compared the clinical characteristics of patients treated
with MKI with those of nontreated patients using the
Pearson chi-square test and analysis of variance. We then
selected 3 patients with a midDT �1 year and who were
treated with MKI therapy and compared the tumor vol-
ume regression lines before and after MKI therapy.
All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical
software (version 24; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). A
P value � .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The clinicopathological characteristics of the 88 patients
are summarized in Table 1.The patients had a median age
of 54 years at the time of their diagnosis of distant metas-
tases, with papillary (43%) or poorly differentiated (38%)
histologies and predominantly subcentimeter pulmonary
metastases (72%). The majority of patients had only lung
metastases, with only 22% found to have additional meta-
static lesions outside of the lung at the time of the diagno-
sis of lung metastases. The median size of the primary
tumor was 3.4 cm (range, 0.7-16 cm).
The patients were followed for a median of 8.5 years
(range, 0.7-29.4 years). The majority of patients (85%)
had developed disease progression by the end of the
follow-up period and greater than one-half of the patients
had died (56%). Of the 49 patients who died, the primary
cause of death was thyroid cancer (84%) followed by mye-
lodysplastic syndrome in 6% of the cases. The cause of
death was not known in 5 patients.

 Distribution of TVDT of Lung Metastases
A total of 88 patients had lung lesions attributed to thy-
roid cancer metastases. All but 3 patients had at least 2
measurable lung lesions. In keeping with RECIST, we
elected to measure �2 nodules in 1 organ.16 Over time,
some of the lesions grew, others remained stable, and
others decreased in size. Figure 1 depicts the regression
lines of tumor volume changes with time of the 2 selected
nodules (largest nodule is nodule 1 in panel A and the sec-
ond largest nodule is nodule 2 in panel B) in 3 representa-
tive patients. Of the 146 progressive metastatic lung
lesions, the tumor growth rate was remarkably constant
over time, with a median follow-up of 8.5 years (median
r, 0.92; r2 5 0.85).
For the cohort of 88 patients, the median size of the
largest nodule was 1 cm and increased to 1.6 cm with a
median DT of 1.3 years. The median size of the second
largest nodule was 0.76 cm, and grew to approximately
1.2 cm with an equivalent median DT of 1.4 years (Table
2). The median average TVDT of nodule 1 and nodule 2
(midDT) was equivalent to the median TVDT of either
nodule (1.5 years vs 1.3 years for nodule 1 and 1.4 years
for nodule 2).
The DT of nodule 1 correlated moderately well with
that of nodule 2 (Pearson r, 0.48; r2 5 0.23 [P<.001]).
Assuming that the tumor growth of 2 dominant lesions is
more representative of the overall clinical course than the
DT of each separate nodule individually, we used the
midDT as our primary outcome measure.
In general, the midDT ranged between -202.0 and
481.3 years. Table 3 summarizes the distribution of
patients based on biochemical and structural DT
(midDT). Based on the midDT, approximately 79% of
patients had progressive disease in the lung from the time

 of the initial diagnosis of distant metastases, with 16
patients found to have rapidly progressive disease (midDT
of � 1 year), 38 patients found to have slowly progressive
disease (midDT of 1-4 years), and 16 patients found to
have very slowly progressive disease in the lungs (midDT
of � 4 years). A negative midDT was recorded in 18
patients, ranging between -0.93 and -202.0 years (median
negative midDT, -11.5 years), reflecting the stability or
slight decline in the average tumor volume overtime after
RAI therapy and TSH suppression therapy.
At the time of the diagnosis of distant metastases,
approximately one-half of the patients were classified as
having RAI-avid lung metastases. The median midDTs
were similar in the RAI-avid patients (46 patients; median
midDT of 1.43 years) and RAIR patients (42 patients;

 midDTs were similar between patients with disease that
was avid for FDG-positron emission tomography (PET)
(30 patients; median midDT of 1.41 years) and patients
with FDG-PET-negative metastatic thyroid cancer (36
patients; median midDT of 1.65 years). Thus, we antici-
pate that the effect of intervening therapies on the midDT
was minimal.
Using chi-square analysis, we did not demonstrate a
statistically significant correlation between the midDT
and patient age, sex, RAI avidity, FDG-PET positivity, or
the presence of other distant metastatic sites. However,
not surprisingly, patients with Hurthle cell or poorly dif-
ferentiated thyroid cancer were more likely to have a
shorter midDT compared with those with more differen-
tiated tumors (P<.001).
Thyroglobulin DT
A total of 81 patients had serial Tg levels that fit our inclu-
sion criteria. The median Tg level at the time of the first
CT scan was 38 ng/mL (range, 0.3-44,500.0 ng/mL) and
rose to a median of 156 ng/mL (range, 0.2-158,000.0 ng/
mL) (Table 2). The median TgDT was 0.8 years.
The TgDT and midDT demonstrated a moderate
correlation (Pearson r, 0.50; r2, 0.25 [P<.001]). A similar
percentage of patients had progressive disease (DT posi-
tive) based on the TgDT as by the midDT (81% vs 79%)
(Table 3). Table 4 shows a similar distribution of TgDT
and midDT with the shortest midDT (�2 years), longest
midDT (�4 years), and negative DTs, with more variabil-
ity in the distribution of TgDT and midDT noted when
the DT measured between 2 and 4 years.
Association Between OS and Rate of Disease
Progression
Figure 2 depicts the Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in the
cohort of patients based on the midDT and TgDT
groups. Survival was measured from the time of diagnosis
of distant metastases (Fig. 2A and 2C) and from the time
the lung lesion reached 1 cm (Fig. 2B and 2D). The
median OS from the time of diagnosis of lung metastases
was 9.8 years (95% confidence interval, 8.8-10.9 years).
The median OS from the 1-cm time point was 5.2 years
(95% confidence interval, 3.2-7.2 years).
Patients with a DT of <1 year fared worse than
patients with a higher DT. This was true for both the
TgDT and midDT from either the time of diagnosis of
lung metastases or from the time the largest lung lesion
measured 1 cm. The 5-year OS rate from the 1-cm time
point was 20% for a midDT � 1 year (15 patients), 50%
for a midDT of 1 to 2 years (19 patients), 53% for a
midDT of 2 to 3 years (9 patients), 80% for a midDT of
3 to 4 years (6 patients), 86% for a midDT of �4 years (8
patients), and 52% for those with a negative midDT (4
patients) (Table 5).
Initial Observation of the Effect of MKI Therapy
on OS and TVDT
A total of 27 of the studied patients were treated with
MKI therapy during the course of their follow-up: 9
patients (33%) with a midDT � 1 year, 8 patients (30%)
with a midDT of 1 to 2 years, 4 patients (15%) with a
midDT of 2 to 3 years, 1 patient (3%) with a midDT of 3
to 4 years, and 5 patients with a midDT �4 years or nega-
tive midDT (19%).
Of the 15 patients with a midDT �1 year, 8 were
treated with MKI and could be followed from the time
the largest lung nodule measured 1 cm. The median
follow-up from the 1-cm time point was 2.4 years. The 2-
year OS rate from the 1-cm time point was 88% in the
patients treated with MKIs (8 patients) versus 43% in the
patients who were not treated with MKIs (7 patients)
(P 5 .13). There was no difference in the clinical charac-
teristics of the patients who received MKI and those who
did not (data not shown). A survival benefit for MKI was
not demonstrated when a similar analysis was performed

after MKI therapy, the DT or tumor growth rate of the
index lesion while the patient was receiving chronic MKI
therapy varied widely.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we introduced midDT as a novel
clinical marker used to define structural disease progres-
sion in patients with lung metastases from differentiated
thyroid cancer. Given that tumors do not grow in a linear
fashion, we estimated that change in tumor volume is a
more accurate measurement of growth than change in the
longest diameter of a given lesion. Tumor growth rate in
the lungs is remarkably constant, allowing for reliable
measurement of TVDT. Lung midDT is measured easily
through serial, retrospective review of 4 consecutive chest
CT scans obtained at any time during the follow-up of the
patient. Using the initial DT concept of Miyauchi et al,9
the Kuma clinic in Tokyo published a DT and progres-
sion calculator that helps physicians to estimate tumor
growth based on biochemical marker changes and tumor
volume
changes
(http://www.kuma-h.or.jp/english).
Using the Kuma calculator, treating physicians in the
community can easily and rapidly estimate the TgDT and
midDT during clinic visits. Furthermore, the selected
clinically relevant midDT groups have been shown to pre-
dict overall prognosis from thyroid cancer, thereby allow-
ing physicians to appropriately risk-stratify patients in the

 clinic, thus predicting early on which patients are more
likely to progress rapidly as opposed to the slow progres-
sors. Treatment approaches and the frequency of the
follow-up imaging and visits can be tailored accordingly.
Patients with metastatic thyroid cancer with a
midDT �1 year have a worse prognosis that those with a
higher midDT. Prior studies have demonstrated that the
1-year time point in DT equally predicts worse prognosis
when using TgDT, and calcitonin and carcinoembryonic
antigen DT in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.
The results of the current study further validate the prog-
nostic value of TgDT in patients with differentiated thy-
roid cancer. It is not surprising that, in the current study,
TgDT did not correlate with the midDT. TgDT is a bio-
chemical estimate of the total body tumor volume growth
rate, whereas midDT estimated only tumor growth occur-
ring within a specific organ. Although both TgDT and
midDT are prognostic indicators for patients with meta-
static thyroid cancer, biochemical disease progression
alone is not an eligibility criterion for consideration for
MKI therapy. Conversely, structural progression alone,
measured as the midDT, can be used to select patients for
MKI therapy. In the future, we anticipate that calculations
of both lung midDT and TgDT can be used jointly to
risk-stratify patients and make treatment decisions. Thus,
although the decision to treat is relatively straightforward
for patients with both TgDT and a lung midDT �1 year,
strong considerations would be made to treat those indi-
viduals with a TgDT �1 year but with a longer midDT
(ie, a midDT of 1-4 years).
There continues to be a lack of uniform consensus
regarding the ideal time for the initiation of MKI therapy
in patients with RAIR, metastatic, follicular cell-derived
thyroid cancer. Although the presence of clinically mea-
surable disease (ie, lesions measuring > 1-1.5 cm) is a
minimum requirement for consideration of MKI therapy,
the inclusion criteria for the prospective randomized regis-
tration trials for sorafenib and lenvatinib required at least
a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the
target lesions defined by RECIST over either a 13-month
(lenvatinib) or 14-month (sorafenib) period.17,18 Assum-
ing that tumor growth rate is constant overtime (as shown
in the current study) and using unidimensional tumor
growth patterns, this would approximately equate to a
DT of 4 years. Conversely, based primarily on expert
opinion, the 2015 American Thyroid Association guide-
lines for thyroid cancer management suggest that a 20%
increase in the longest tumor diameter over a 6-month
period should prompt consideration of MKI therapies.
This correlates with a DT of approximately 2 years (�
40% growth over 1 year).19 The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network guidelines cautiously avoided defining a

 specific tumor growth rate or tumor size that would
prompt the use of MKI therapy in patients with RAIR dif-
ferentiated thyroid cancer or medullary thyroid cancer.20
Thus, based on the above summarized criterion,
patients with structurally progressive, clinically measur-
able lung lesions with a tumor diameter DT of �2 to 4
years would be considered for the initiation of MKI
therapy, whereas those individuals with lesions with a
tumor diameter DT >4 years would be observed. How-
ever, RECIST are not validated in the clinical setting
outside of prospective clinical trials. In addition, these
unidimensional growth rate patterns can underestimate
tumor volume growth over time and to the best of our
knowledge have not been correlated with OS from met-
astatic RAIR thyroid cancer. Furthermore, using the
above eligibility criteria for study entry, neither lenvati-
nib nor sorafenib therapy in patients with RAIR meta-
static thyroid cancer demonstrated a significant survival
benefit when compared with placebo. Thus, these eligi-
bility criteria alone are not enough to select patients
who are likely to benefit from MKI therapy. It is impor-
tant to note that, due to its retrospective design, the cur-
rent study was not intended to provide a head-to-head
comparison of one tumor growth rate definition over
another.
The results of the current study not only validate
the use of midDT as a prognostic indicator in patients
with lung metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer
in the clinical practice setting, but our preliminary obser-
vations also hint at a survival benefit with MKI therapy
in patients with a midDT �1 year. It is not surprising
that the survival benefit in the patients treated with
MKIs was not statistically significant given the small
number of patients studied. When examining the regres-
sion lines before and after MKI therapy, it became evi-
dent that despite an initial significant drop in tumor size
and volume (which may be considered as a response to
therapy) the long-term TVDT after the lung lesion
reached its nadir size was quite varied among the 3
patients studied. We postulate that the response to MKI
therapy and long-term survival after its use are more a
function of that long-term TVDT rather than the acute
tumor shrinkage observed within the first weeks after the
initiation of MKI therapy. To further examine the effica-
cy of MKI therapies in patients with thyroid cancer, we
currently are in the process of conducting further studies
examining the effect of MKI therapy on OS and the
change in TVDT before and after specific MKI therapy
in a larger cohort of patients. In the interim, the data
from the current study support the use of midDT as a
useful clinical marker with which to properly select
patients who are likely to benefit from the initiation of
MKI therapy. We postulate that the early selection and
treatment of patients with RAIR metastatic thyroid can-
cer and a midDT �1 year would improve treatment
response and OS with MKI therapy. In addition, proper
patient selection would prevent patients with slow
TVDT being exposed to toxic, potentially fatal and cost-
ly drugs that are unlikely to benefit them clinically.
The current study is a retrospective review of patient
charts and therefore is subject to all associated biases,
including selection bias. We assumed that the measured
lung lesions were thyroid cancer metastasis based on the
overall clinical picture. We were careful not to measure
ground glass nodules. In a few patients, a wedge biopsy
was performed to confirm lung metastasis from thyroid
cancer. In others, prior RAI avidity confirmed lung metas-
tasis from thyroid cancer. Nonetheless, it is possible that
some stable or slowly progressive lung lesions may repre-
sent inflammatory changes and/or indolent bronchoal-
veolar cancer.
Many of the patients in the current study had disease
considered to be RAI avid at the time of the diagnosis of
lung metastasis on the basis of uptake on the first postther-
apy scan. These patients were treated with repeat RAI
therapies. We previously demonstrated that >50% of the
patients eventually present with disease progression
despite repeat RAI therapies and ultimately are considered
to have RAIR disease.6 In the current study, approximate-
ly 85% of patients had progressive disease at the end of
the follow-up period. However, we recognize that in the
tumors that are truly responsive to RAI, repeat RAI thera-
py may have influenced the TVDTs. This is especially
true for patients with RAI-responsive tumors who are pre-
dicted to have negative midDT or a midDT of >4 years
after these therapies. To eliminate transient RAI response
in partial RAI responders, we purposely elected not to
measure lung volumes within 18 months after RAI
therapy.
The average TVDT (midDT) of lung metastasis is
an accessible, easily calculated, and reliable prognostic
indicator of OS in patients with metastatic differentiated
thyroid cancer and can be used to identify patients with
RAIR metastatic thyroid cancer who are likely to benefit
from MKI therapy.
