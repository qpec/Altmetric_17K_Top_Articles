Background: Angiosarcomas are rare malignant tumors of vascular origin that represent a genuine therapeutic
challenge. Recently, the combination of metronomic chemotherapy and drug repositioning has been proposed
as an attractive alternative for cancer patients living in developing countries.
Methods: In vitro experiments with transformed endothelial cells were used to identify synergistic interactions
between anti-hypertensive drug propranolol and chemotherapeutics. This led to the design of a pilot treatment
protocol combining oral propranolol and metronomic chemotherapy. Seven consecutive patients with advanced/
metastatic/recurrent angiosarcoma were treated with this combination for up to 12 months, followed by
propranolol-containing maintenance therapy.
Findings: Gene expression analysis showed expression of ADRB1 and ADRB2 adrenergic receptor genes in
transformed endothelial cells and in angiosarcoma tumors. Propranolol strongly synergized with the
microtubule-targeting agent vinblastine in vitro, but only displayed additivity or slight antagonism with paclitax-
el and doxorubicin. A combination treatment using bi-daily propranolol (40 mg) and weekly metronomic
vinblastine (6 mg/m2) and methotrexate (35 mg/m2) was designed and used in 7 patients with advanced
angiosarcoma. Treatment was well tolerated and resulted in 100% response rate, including 1 complete response
and 3 very good partial responses, based on RECIST criteria. Median progression-free and overall survival was
11 months (range 5–24) and 16 months (range 10–30), respectively.
Interpretation: Our results provide a strong rationale for the combination of β-blockers and vinblastine-based metro-
nomic chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced angiosarcoma. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential
of drug repositioning in combination with metronomic chemotherapy in low- and middle-income country setting.
Funding: This study was funded by institutional and philanthropic grants.

Angiosarcomas are rare, but very aggressive tumors of vascular
origin. Prognosis for advanced angiosarcoma patients is dismal.
Here, we used an in vitro model of angiosarcoma and identified a
very potent combination of chemotherapy agent vinblastine and
anti-hypertensive drug propranolol. This led to the design of an innova-
tive and inexpensive treatment protocol, which was evaluated in 7 con-
secutive patients with advanced angiosarcoma. This treatment resulted
in 100% response and prolonged survival, thus warranting further
validation in larger clinical trials and highlighting the potential of this
type of therapeutic approach for both developing and high-income
countries.

 1. Introduction
Drug repositioning or repurposing, which consists in using already
approved drugs for new medical applications, provides a unique
opportunity to effectively develop and rapidly implement new treat-
ment modalities for cancer patients (Yap et al., 2010; Blatt and Corey,
2013; André et al., 2013; Bertolini et al., 2015). By relying on drugs
with well-known pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity profiles,
drug repositioning can significantly lower the risks of failure and
decrease the time needed to translate pre-clinical results into the
clinic, thus considerably reducing costs. These advantages are perfect-
ly illustrated by the recent repositioning of β-blockers for the treatment
of severe hemangiomas. Indeed, the serendipitous discovery of the effi-
cacy of the non-selective β-blocker, propranolol, in treating infantile
hemangioma (Léauté-Labrèze et al., 2008) in 2008 has completely rev-
olutionized the management of this common pathology (Léauté-
Labrèze et al., 2015). Although hemangiomas are benign vascular tu-
mors, this breakthrough led us to hypothesize that β-blockers may be
able to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy against malignant tumors
when used in combination. Thus, we recently demonstrated that β-
blockers could potentiate the anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic
properties of certain chemotherapy agents in vitro, especially
microtubule-targeting drugs, and increase their anti-tumor efficacy in
animal models of triple-negative breast cancer (Pasquier et al., 2011)
and neuroblastoma (Pasquier et al., 2013). Interestingly, our findings
were consistent with an increasing body of retrospective analyses
showing that the use of β-blockers for the treatment of hypertension
may be associated with significant benefits in cancer patients in terms
of prolonged survival and/or decreased risk of metastasis or relapse
(Powe et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2014; Grytli et al., 2014). Collectively,
these studies strongly suggest that β-blockers may prove useful in the
treatment of drug-refractory cancers.
Angiosarcomas are a rare form of malignant endothelial cell tumors
of vascular or lymphatic origin, accounting for 2–3% of all soft-tissue sar-
comas (Young et al., 2010). Radical surgery with complete resection is
the standard of care for local disease. For patients with unresectable
and/or metastatic disease, treatment may involve radiation and chemo-
therapy with either doxorubicin or paclitaxel but despite aggressive
therapy, prognosis remains dismal (Young et al., 2010; Fury et al.,
2005). There is no randomized trial available and very few prospective
studies. As a result, no evidence-based recommendation can be made
for specific angiosarcoma subtypes and given clinical settings. Several
small studies have evaluated the efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents,
such as sorafenib and bevacizumab, but with very limited success
(Maki et al., 2009; Von Mehren et al., 2012; Agulnik et al., 2013). Re-
sponse rate was low (5–11%) and median progression-free and overall
survival was poor (3–5 months and 13–15 months, respectively).
Therefore, alternative therapeutic options are urgently needed, particu-
larly in patients who present with metastatic disease.
Accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that β-
adrenergic receptor blockade may prove useful in the treatment of
angiosarcoma. Chisholm et al. first reported detectable expression
of adrenergic receptors in vascular tumors (Chisholm et al., 2012).
This finding was then confirmed by Stiles et al., who also demon-
strated the therapeutic potential of propranolol in an animal model
of angiosarcoma (Stiles et al., 2013). More recently, clinical data further
corroborated the therapeutic potential of β-adrenergic receptor block-
ade. First, we reported sustained complete response to propranolol in
combination with metronomic chemotherapy in a patient with a re-
lapsing metastatic angiosarcoma (Banavali et al., 2015). Shortly after,
Bryan and colleagues reported extensive tumor regression induced by
propranolol in combination with paclitaxel poliglumex and radiothera-
py in a patient with multi-focal angiosarcoma of the scalp and face
(Chow et al., 2015).
Here we took our initial clinical experience to the bench and investi-
gated potential synergistic interactions between propranolol and
various chemotherapy agents. This led us to design a pilot treatment
protocol combining propranolol and vinblastine-based metronomic
chemotherapy, which was then used in 7 consecutive patients with ad-
vanced and/or metastatic angiosarcoma.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Cell Culture
BMST (full name BMSVThTERT-4) and BMST-Ras (full name
BMSVThTERT-4Nras) cell lines are bone marrow-derived endothelial
cells that were successively transformed with SV40T and immortalized
by ectopic expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) (MacKenzie et al., 2002). BMST-Ras were also transfected with
the vector LN-ras2 to express the N-ras oncogene. Both cell lines were
previously characterized for expression of angiogenic markers, including
CD31, VEGFR-2, CD34 and VE-Cadherin (MacKenzie et al., 2002). They
were grown in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (Invitrogen,
Mount Waverley, Australia) containing 20% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) and
2 mM L-glutamine and were routinely maintained in culture on 0.1%
gelatin-coated flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Both cell lines were regularly
screened and are free from mycoplasma contamination.
2.2. Quantitative RT-PCR
The expression of adrenergic receptor genes ADRB1 and ADRB2 was
examined in endothelial cell lines using real-time quantitative RT-PCR.
Total RNA was extracted and DNAse treated using the Qiagen Mini
RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Doncaster, Australia) and the RNA concentration
was determined from the absorbance at 260 nm. cDNA synthesis was
performed using High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit with
RNAse inhibitor (Applied Biosystem, Melbourne, Australia). Real time
PCR was run on 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system using Power
SYBR® green (Applied Biosystems) for ADRB1 and ADRB2 using DNA
primer sequences previously described (Cao et al., 2010) and endoge-
nous control gene GAPDH. Gene expression levels were determined
using the ΔΔCt method, normalized to the GAPDH control gene
(QT01192646) and expressed relative to a calibrator (Winer et al.,
1999).
2.3. Growth Inhibition Assay
Growth inhibition assays were performed as previously described
(Pasquier et al., 2011). Briefly, cells were seeded at 1500 cells/well in
96-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with a range of concentra-
tions of chemotherapeutic drugs alone or in combination with propran-
olol and after 72 h drug incubation, metabolic activity was detected by
addition of Alamar blue and spectrophotometric analysis. Cell prolifera-
tion was determined and expressed as a percentage of untreated control
cells. The determination of IC50 values was performed by point-to-point
fit spline analysis using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software
Inc., La Jolla, CA). Combination index (CI) values were calculated for all
tested drug concentrations according to the Chou and Talalay method
(Chou, 2010) using the following equation:
CI ¼

where (D)1 and (D)2 represent the dose of agent 1 and 2 used in
combination to induce X% growth inhibition, and (DX)1 and (DX)2
represent the dose of agent 1 and 2 required to reach X% growth inhibi-
tion when used alone. The CI theorem then provides quantitative
definition for additive effects (0.9 ≤ CI ≤ 1.1), synergism (CI b 0.9) and
antagonism (CI N 1.1) in drug combinations.

 2.4. Tumor Spheroid Assay and PARP Cleavage
For the tumor spheroid assay, 5000 BMST-Ras cells were seeded in
ultra-low attachment 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and
allowed to form even tumor spheroids of 600 μm in diameter for 48 h.
Drug treatment was then initiated and photographs were taken every
24 h using the 5× objective of an Axiovert 200 M fluorescent micro-
scope coupled to an AxioCamMR3 camera driven by the AxioVision
4.7 software (Carl Zeiss, North Ryde, Australia). The volume of at least
10 tumor spheroids was determined using the AxioVision 4.7 software
and the following formula: V = 4/3 × π × r3.
To assess apoptosis induction, tumor spheroids were lysed in RIPA
buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle
Hill, Australia) after 120 h of drug treatment. Total cellular proteins
(50 μg) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE before electrotransfer onto ni-
trocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was done using antibodies di-
rected against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH;
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and the large fragment of poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) produced by caspase cleavage (cleaved PARP; Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). The membranes were then
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary anti-
bodies, and protein was detected with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden).
2.5. Patient Population
All patients had presented at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai
and registered under the Bone and Soft Tissue Disease Management
Group. Patients were evaluated with a biopsy for histopathological diag-
nosis and most patients got a PET–CT done to evaluate the extent of dis-
ease. These patients with advanced/metastatic/recurrent disease were
then referred for metronomic therapy because of extremely poor prog-
nosis with standard therapies. Therapy was started after explaining the
experimental nature of treatment, discussing all the treatment options
and obtaining written consent.
2.6. Gene Expression Analysis From FFPE Patient Samples
RNA was extracted from HeLa and SK-N-SH cell lines (positive con-
trols for ADRB1 and ADRB2, respectively) by conventional Trizol meth-
od. Formalin-fixed, Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) sections of 14 μm were
deparaffinized and processed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy
FFPE kit (Qiagen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
concentration was determined from the absorbance at 260 nm and
5 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was then
processed for PCR analysis using specific primers for ADRB1 (Forward:
CCTCGTCCGTAGTCTCCTTC; Reverse: GCAGCTGTCGATCTTCTTCA) and
ADRB2 (Forward: AGAGCCTGCTGACCAAGAAT; TAGCAGTTGATGGCTT
CCTG). PCR products were then loaded onto a 2% agarose gel to verify
the product size. Bands corresponding to the correct amplicon size
(103 bp and 138 bp for ADRB1 and ADRB2, respectively) were collected
and DNA was purified using the QIAquick Gel Purification Kit (Qiagen).
PCR products were then used as template and cycle sequenced using
both strands (forward & reverse) using the Big dye terminator kit on
an Verity Thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Samples were finally
loaded onto ABIPrism 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) for
sequencing.
2.7. Treatment Protocol
Treatment consisted in the combination of bi-daily oral propranolol
(40 mg) and weekly i.v. injections of vinblastine (6 mg/m2; maximum
6 mg) and methotrexate (35 mg/m2; maximum 50 mg) for up to
12 months. This was followed by oral maintenance therapy consisting
of bi-daily oral propranolol (40 mg) in combination with daily oral
etoposide (50 mg) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg) for 20 consecutive
days in cycles of 30 days.
3. Results
3.1. NRAS-induced Transformation of Endothelial Cells Does not Alter β-
adrenergic Receptor Gene Expression and Sensitivity to Propranolol
Immortalized and transformed endothelial cells were developed to
better understand vascular tumors, such as angiosarcoma, and to
evaluate the therapeutic potential of conventional and novel drugs
against these malignancies (Wen and MacKenzie, 2013). Although im-
mortalized murine endothelial cells have been shown to form benign
hemangiomas in vivo, the introduction of oncogenic HRAS produced
rapidly growing and poorly differentiated angiosarcomas (Cao et al.,
2010). Here, we used bone-marrow derived endothelial cells that
were immortalized and transformed by successive transfections with
SV40 T antigen, the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT)
and the N-ras oncogene, as an in vitro model of angiosarcoma. First,
we assessed the expression of β-adrenergic receptor genes ADRB1 and
ADRB2 by qRT-PCR in 3 immortalized (HMEC-1, BMhTERT-1 and
BMST) and 1 Nras-transformed (BMST-Ras) endothelial cell lines
(Fig. 1A). All four endothelial cell lines showed high ADRB2 mRNA
expression, similar to positive control cell line HeLa. In contrast, they
displayed varying levels of ADRB1 mRNA expression, with HMEC-1
cells showing high expression, BMST and BMST-Ras cells intermediate
expression and BMhTERT-1 cells low expression. We then investigated
the anti-proliferative effects of propranolol against BMST and BMST-
Ras cells and found that propranolol inhibited the proliferation of
immortalized and NRAS-transformed endothelial cells in a dose-

 dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The IC50 values were 157 ± 7 μM and
161 ± 7 μM for BMST and BMST-Ras cells, respectively.
3.2. Propranolol Synergizes With Vinblastine but not With Chemotherapeutic
Drugs Commonly Used for the Treatment of Angiosarcoma
Drug combination studies using growth inhibition assay were per-
formed to determine whether propranolol could potentiate the anti-
proliferative effects of chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in the
treatment of angiosarcoma. BMST and BMST-Ras cells were treated
with a range of concentrations of doxorubicin and paclitaxel alone or
in combination with propranolol at 1 μM, 10 μM or 50 μM. As shown
in Fig. 2, propranolol only marginally impacted the sensitivity of BMST
and BMST-Ras cells to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. No significant change
in the IC50 of both drugs was observed as a result of propranolol addi-
tion, except a 24% decrease in sensitivity to doxorubicin in BMST-Ras
cells in presence of 10 μM propranolol and a 14% increase in sensitivity
to paclitaxel in BMST cells the in presence of 10 or 50 μM propranolol
(Fig. 3A–B; p b 0.05). In sharp contrast, propranolol increased the sensi-
tivity of immortalized and Nras-transformed endothelial cells to vin-
blastine by 2.7 to 4.5 folds (Figs. 2C and 3C; p b 0.05). The interaction
of propranolol with chemotherapy agents was quantified using the
Chou and Talalay method (Chou, 2010). Combination indexes showed
that the association of propranolol with doxorubicin and paclitaxel
was slightly antagonistic and additive, respectively, while the interac-
tion between propranolol and vinblastine was highly synergistic
(Fig. 4). The synergism of the combination of propranolol and vinblas-
tine was further evaluated using an in vitro 3D tumor spheroid model
(Fig. 5). BMST-Ras cells were allowed to form spheroids of ~600 μm in
diameter before treatment was initiated. When used alone, 10 μM
propranolol and 1 nM vinblastine significantly slowed down the
growth of tumor spheroids, resulting in a 19–20% decrease in spher-
oid volume after 5 days of treatment as compared to untreated spheroids
(p b 0.001). Furthermore, the combination of propranolol and vinblastine
completely suppressed the growth of tumor spheroids, leading to a 59%
decrease in volume after 5 days as compared to control spheroids
(p b 0.001). Interestingly, the growth inhibitory effect of the combination
was due to apoptosis induction, as evidenced by the cleavage of the Poly
ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) (Fig. 5C).
3.3. Propranolol in Combination With Metronomic Chemotherapy Results
in Long-term Response in Advanced Angiosarcoma Patients
Our in vitro data showed that propranolol interacted synergisti-
cally with vinblastine. Therefore a combination of propranolol and
vinblastine-based metronomic chemotherapy was designed and used
in seven consecutive angiosarcoma patients. The characteristics of the
patients are summarized in Table 1. Five were males, 2 females; the
Fig. 2. In vitro drug combination studies. Growth inhibition assays performed on BMST (left panel) and BMST-Ras (right panel) cell lines using Alamar Blue after 72 h incubation with
doxorubicin (A), paclitaxel (B) and vinblastine (C) alone (black — solid line) or in combination with propranolol at 1 μM (black — broken line), 10 μM (green — solid line) and 50 μM
(red — solid line). Points, % of cell proliferation as compared to untreated control cells, means of four individual experiments; bars, 95% confidence interval; log scale for x axis.
Statistical analysis was performed by comparing the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy alone and in combination with propranolol using Student's t test (*, p b 0.05; **, p b 0.01; ***,
p b 0.001).

 median age was 53 years (range 20 to 72 years); 4 were newly
diagnosed, 3 previously treated. All patients presented with advanced/
metastatic/recurrent tumors and had multiple adverse prognostic
factors as noted in Table 1. Three tumors (patients #1, #3 and #4)
were examined for β-adrenergic receptor gene expression by conven-
tional PCR (Fig. 6). All 3 tested tumors showed detectable levels of
ADRB1 expression while ADRB2 expression was variable, with patient
#4 showing detectable expression while patients #1 and #3 showed
very weak expression. Experimental treatment protocol consisted of
bi-daily oral propranolol at 40 mg in combination with weekly
vinblastine at 6 mg/m2 (maximum 10 mg) and weekly methotrexate
at 35 mg/m2 (maximum 50 mg) administered intravenously. After
12 months, or upon patient request, this was followed by oral mainte-
nance therapy, consisting of continuous bi-daily propranolol at 40 mg in
combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide both at 50 mg/day
for 20 days in cycles of 30 days. Treatment duration and responses are
summarized in Table 2.
Overall, treatment was well tolerated by most patients. Nearly all pa-
tients developed grade II fatigue by 6 months of injectable chemothera-
py and the doses of injections were decreased by approximately 50% to
a fixed dose of 5 mg vinblastine and 25 mg methotrexate. None of the
patients developed febrile neutropenia nor required blood or platelet
support, except for patient #4, who had bone marrow involvement at
presentation. This patient had presented with pancytopenia (low he-
moglobin, ANC & platelet count) and thus was started at a 50% reduced
dose of chemotherapy. However, he continued to have low counts and
received only 4 months of intermittent chemotherapy. Patient #1 devel-
oped grade II abdominal pain/diarrhea on week 2 of injectable chemo-
therapy and dose was therefore reduced by 25%. Patient #2 developed
grade II neutropenia (ANC: 1.28 × 109/L) after the first injection of che-
motherapy and dose was also decreased by 25%. In both cases, dose re-
duction was effective in abrogating toxicity.
All 7 patients responded to treatment with propranolol in combi-
nation with metronomic chemotherapy, with best responses based
on RECIST criteria classified as very good partial response in 3 and
complete response in 1. Spectacular tumor regressions were ob-
served in patients #2 and #3 (Fig. 7). Importantly, patients #1 and
#5 experienced 7 and 11 months PFS as third line treatment, respec-
tively. Two patients are still alive and on various stages of treatment.
The median PFS is 11 months (range 5 to 24 months) and OS is
16 months (range 10 to 30 months). Collectively, these results
show that the combination of propranolol with metronomic chemo-
therapy is a very promising strategy to manage recurrent and/or
metastatic angiosarcoma.

 4. Discussion
Although quite rare, angiosarcoma remains a genuine challenge in
medical oncology. When surgery is not possible because of the extent
and/or localization of the disease, prognosis is very dismal. With stan-
dard treatment, usually based on taxanes and/or doxorubicin chemo-
therapy, median OS is around 9 months (Young et al., 2010). Given
the vascular origin of angiosarcoma and the importance of angiogenesis
in the biology of the disease (Young et al., 2010; Behjati et al., 2014),
anti-angiogenic agents were investigated in clinical studies with great
expectations. However, the results were disappointing, with low re-
sponse rates and median PFS of 4–5 months (Young et al., 2010; Maki
et al., 2009; Von Mehren et al., 2012). Overall, there is currently no

 curative option for advanced angiosarcoma and treatment is mostly pal-
liative. In the present study, we report 100% response rate based on
RECIST criteria, 11 months median PFS and 16 months median OS in
7 consecutive patients with advanced and/or metastatic/recurrent
angiosarcoma using an inexpensive combination treatment designed
from pre-clinical data.
Our in vitro experiments first confirmed the dose-dependent
anti-proliferative effects of propranolol against transformed endo-
thelial cells, as previously shown by Stiles et al.(Stiles et al. (2013))
It is however important to note that in the current study and previ-
ous ones, high micromolar concentrations of propranolol were re-
quired to inhibit angiosarcoma cell proliferation when used alone,
which is not achievable in vivo with standard dosage. This suggests
that the anti-tumor efficacy of propranolol alone is not directly me-
diated by its anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells, but rather
through alternative mechanisms including angiogenesis inhibition
and immunostimulatory effects (Cole and Sood, 2012). Importantly,
we did not observe any significant difference in the sensitivity to
propranolol between BMST and BMST-Ras cells, demonstrating that
the introduction of oncogenic NRAS did not induce resistance to pro-
pranolol. This finding is particularly important given that Ras oncogenes
(NRAS, KRAS and HRAS) are frequently mutated in angiosarcoma tumors
(Murali et al., 2015).
We then sought potential synergism between propranolol and che-
motherapy agents. In vitro combination studies showed that proprano-
lol did not increase the efficacy of doxorubicin or paclitaxel but
interacted synergistically with vinblastine. This synergism was further
validated using 3D tumor spheroids and found to be associated with ap-
optosis induction. This finding is consistent with results we previously
reported in neuroblastoma (Pasquier et al., 2013). Indeed, out of 7 che-
motherapy agents tested, we found that β-blockers specifically
synergized with vincristine against neuroblastoma cells. Collectively,
these results suggest that β-adrenergic receptor blockade should be
used in combination with Vinca alkaloids to maximize therapeutic
efficacy.
We and others have recently reported the therapeutic benefits of
propranolol in 2 patients with relapsing metastatic and multi-focal
angiosarcoma, respectively (Banavali et al., 2015; Chow et al., 2015).
Here, we extended these initial findings to 7 consecutive angiosarcoma
patients with dismal prognosis. Treatment protocol design was based
on the synergistic interaction of propranolol and vinblastine observed
in vitro. In addition, methotrexate was included based on its anti-
inflammatory properties and previous report of efficacy of low-dose
methotrexate in combination with vinblastine against other forms of
aggressive soft-tissue tumors, like inoperable fibromatosis (Azzarelli
et al., 2001). The 100% response rate based on RECIST criteria and
extended PFS and OS reported here are impressive given the advanced
disease stage in all 7 patients and the common drug refractoriness of
angiosarcomas (Young et al., 2010).
We tested 3 patient tumors for β-adrenergic receptor gene ex-
pression by RT-PCR and found that all 3 tumors expressed ADRB1 at
similar levels while ADRB2 expression was more variable and barely
detectable in 2 out of 3 patients. This is somewhat different from the
results of tissue microarray immunostaining experiments that re-
ported high ADRB2 expression in various vascular tumors, including
angiosarcoma (Chisholm et al., 2012; Stiles et al., 2013). It is however
important to note that antibodies directed towards G-protein
coupled receptors notoriously lack specificity (Michel et al., 2009)
and gene expression analysis may provide more reliable results
than immunostaining of tumor sections. Elsewhere, stress-induced
tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and resistance to treatment
has been directly linked to ADRB2 signaling (Cole and Sood, 2012).
Future studies will need to address the contribution of the different
adrenergic receptors in the synergism between propranolol and che-
motherapy agents in angiosarcoma and other refractory tumors,
such as triple-negative breast cancer and neuroblastoma (Pasquier
et al., 2011; Pasquier et al., 2013).
Our study has a number of caveats that should not be ignored. First,
this is an unpowered clinical study with a mixture of first line and re-
lapse treatments. Secondly, treatment was slightly heterogeneous. For
instance, Patients #3, #4, and #7 who had multiple bone metastases
and were in pain at presentation, also received celecoxib 200 mg PO
bid and weekly zoledronic acid 1 mg IV for the first 3 months of therapy.
In addition, given the palliative nature of treatment, the dose of chemo-
therapy agents was decreased in the presence of grade II toxicities, in
order to prevent the occurrence of grade III and IV toxicities. This het-
erogeneity in terms of clinical setting and treatment protocol does not
allow rigorous comparison with historical controls. Finally, our study
did not include the use of propranolol as monotherapy to demonstrate
its potential anti-tumor activity, although recent in vivo data (Stiles
et al., 2013) and a clinical case report (Chow et al., 2015) suggest it
may also prove useful as a single agent. It is however important to
note that previous studies reported positive results with the use of met-
ronomic chemotherapy to treat malignant vascular tumors (Vogt et al.,
2003; Mir et al., 2011), thus providing further rationale for our combina-
tion treatment.

 5. Conclusions
Drug repositioning provides a unique opportunity to develop new
treatment modalities that can be rapidly translated into the clinic.
This approach is particularly attractive for low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC), where the latest drugs and therapies developed in
high-income countries (HIC) are unaffordable for the wide majority of
patients (André et al., 2013). Here, despite the limitations of our study
we produce strong evidence for the repositioning of β-adrenergic
receptor antagonist, propranolol, in combination with vinblastine-
based metronomic chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced
angiosarcoma. The safety and efficacy of this treatment will now need
to be further validated in a larger phase I/II clinical trial. Importantly,
this type of treatment comes at a fraction of the cost of experimental
treatments developed for angiosarcoma patients in HIC and it can be
administered on an out-patient basis with manageable toxicities. It
thus represents a very promising and economically viable strategy for
patients living in LMIC, thus paving the way for the development of a
fair, global oncology.
