Abstract
Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed
prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the
largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male
participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter
fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was
considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total
volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw
structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor
cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for
attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.
Key words: brain volume, cortical thickness, fMRI, sex differences, surface area

 Introduction
Sex differences have been of enduring biological interest
(Darwin 1871), but our knowledge about their relevance to the
human brain is surprisingly sparse. It has been noted by several
researchers that the potential influences of sex are under-
explored in neuroscientific research (Beery and Zucker 2011;
Cahill 2006, 2017; Karp et al. 2017). A fuller understanding of
morphological and functional differences between the brains of
the human sexes might provide insight into why the observed
prevalence of some psychiatric disorders differs substantially
by sex (Rutter et al. 2003), and would assist in explaining sev-
eral behavioral sex differences (Zell et al. 2015; Gur and Gur
2017). As biomedical research moves closer to the ideals of pre-
cision medicine (e.g., Collins and Varmus 2015), it is even more
pressing that we have a more nuanced understanding of simi-
larities and differences in brain structure and function across
the sexes. Here, we report a study that characterizes multi-
modal sex differences in the adult human brain in the largest
sample to date.
It is of particular importance to gain a more detailed picture
of how the brains of males and females differ, because several
psychiatric disorders and conditions differ in their prevalence
between the sexes. For instance, rates of Alzheimer’s disease
are higher in females than males, prompting a recent call for
the prioritization of biomedical research into sex differences in
measures relevant to this disorder (Mazure and Swendsen
2016). Females also show a higher prevalence of major depres-
sive disorder (Rutter et al. 2003; Gobinath et al. 2017), whereas
males display higher rates of disorders such as autism spec-
trum disorder (Baron-Cohen et al. 2011), schizophrenia (Aleman
et al. 2003) and dyslexia (Arnett et al. 2017). Improving thera-
peutic strategies for these conditions will almost certainly
require accurate quantitative estimates of where and how the
sexes differ normatively.
Moreover, although many psychological sex differences
are small (consistent with the “gender similarities hypothe-
sis”; Hyde 2014), some behaviors and traits do show reliable
and substantial differences. For instance, performance on
mental rotation tasks (Maeda and Yoon 2013) and physical
aggression (Archer 2004) are on average higher in males,
whereas self-reported interest in people versus things (Su et al.
2009) and the personality traits of neuroticism (Schmitt et al. 2008)
and agreeableness (Costa et al. 2001) are on average higher in
females. A full explanation of these cognitive and behavioral phe-
nomena might benefit from a better understanding of brain sex
differences.
Our understanding of brain sex differences has been ham-
pered by low statistical power in previous studies. Small-sample
research has become a considerable concern in neuroscience
research (Button et al. 2013; Nord et al. 2017), and the concern no
less applies to research on sex differences. To illustrate this point,
in the most recent meta-analysis of macrostructural sex differ-
ences in brain subregions (Ruigrok et al. 2014)—which revealed a
complex pattern of differences, with both males and females
showing larger brain volume depending on the brain substructure
in question—studies that examined sex differences in specific
subregions of interest (rather than in broad, overall measures)
had a mean sample size of 130 participants (range = 28–465).
Since the publication of that meta-analysis, some larger macro-
structural studies have appeared, though they are either in youn-
ger participants only (Gur and Gur 2016; Gennatas et al. 2017;
Wierenga et al. 2017) or somewhat limited in the number of brain
measures they report (Jäncke et al. 2015). Adult macrostructural
studies with a large scale—both in terms of sample size and in
terms of brain regions analyzed—are required.
Beyond macrostructural measures, there may also be robust
sex differences in measures of the brain’s white matter micro-
structure. Studies that have attempted to quantify sex differ-
ences in white matter microstructure with diffusion tensor MRI
—which uses information about the movement of water mole-
cules through the brain’s white matter tracts to produce mea-
sures such as fractional anisotropy (FA), which has been linked
to variation in cognitive and health-related traits (Sundgren
et al. 2004)—are rare and, where they exist, small in sample
size (Kanaan et al. 2012; Dunst et al. 2014). Newer and more
rarely-studied neurite orientation dispersion and density imag-
ing (NODDI) measures can offer novel information on the
microstructural bases of sex differences. NODDI treats the
diffusion-weighted signal as a combination of 3 compartments,
each with characteristics that differentially shape the diffusion
probability function of water molecules: fast isotropic diffusion
(e.g., cerebrospinal fluid), anisotropic hindered diffusion (e.g.,
extracellular water), and restricted anisotropic diffusion (e.g.,
intra-axonal compartments; Zhang et al. 2012). This relatively
more complex parameterization of the water diffusion signal
may also lead to lower susceptibility to partial volume effects,
and can potentially yield less ambiguous estimates of underlying
microstructure than more traditional measures (for instance, FA
cannot resolve these different underlying tissue properties).
In addition to the above structural brain imaging measures,
it is also of interest to investigate sex differences in brain
function. Examinations of sex differences in resting-state
functional connectivity—the functional measure used in the
present study, which indexes the temporal relations between
activation in anatomically-separate brain regions while the
brain is at rest (that is, not completing any experimenter-
directed task; van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol 2010)—have
also shown substantial differences, for example within the
default mode network (where females show stronger connec-
tivity) and within sensorimotor and visual cortices (where
males show stronger connectivity; Biswal et al. 2010). As has
been noted (Scheinost et al. 2015), a better characterization of
broad patterns, including sex differences, in relatively novel
measures such as functional connectivity (and in the NODDI
parameters described above) is of importance to establish a
“baseline” upon which future studies of normal versus abnor-
mal function can rely.
There is more to sex differences than averages: there are
physical and psychological traits that tend to be more variable
in males than females. The best-studied human phenotype in
this context has been cognitive ability: almost universally,
studies have found that males show greater variance in this
trait (Deary et al. 2007a; Johnson et al. 2008; Lakin 2013; though
see Iliescu et al. 2016). This has also been found for academic
achievement test results (themselves a potential consequence
of cognitive differences, which are known to predict later edu-
cational
achievement;
Deary
et
al.
2007b;
Machin
and
Pekkarinen 2008; Lehre et al. 2009a, 2009b), other psychological
characteristics such as personality (Borkenau et al. 2013), and a
range of physical traits such as athletic performance (Olds et al.
2006), and both birth and adult weight (Lehre et al. 2009a). To
our knowledge, only two prior studies have explicitly examined
sex differences in the variability of brain structure (Wierenga
et al. 2017; Lange et al. 1997), and no studies have done so in
individuals older than 20 years. Here, we addressed this gap in
the literature by testing the “greater male variability” hypothe-
sis in the adult brain.

 The Present Study
To date, there exists no single, comprehensive, well-powered
analysis of sex differences in mean and variance in the adult
brain that covers structural, diffusion, and functional MRI mea-
sures. Here, we examine multimodal sex differences in adult
human brain structural and functional organization in the larg-
est and most definitive study to date, ensuring high levels of
statistical power and reliability. We used data from UK Biobank
(Allen et al. 2012), a biomedical study based in the United
Kingdom. A subset of the full sample of 500,000 participants
has contributed neuroimaging data (Miller et al. 2016); a portion
of these data have been released for analysis while collection is
ongoing, and this subset is analyzed here. We tested male–
female differences (in mean and variance) in overall and sub-
cortical brain volumes, mapped the magnitude of sex differ-
ences across the cortex with multiple measures (volume,
surface area, and cortical thickness), and also examined sex dif-
ferences in white matter microstructure derived from DT-MRI
and NODDI. We tested the extent to which these differences
were regionally-specific or brain-general, by adjusting them for
the total brain size (or other relevant overall measurement; for
instance, adjusting volume differences for total brain volume
and cortical thickness differences for mean cortical thickness),
and examining whether the differences found in the raw analy-
ses were still present. We tested the extent to which these
structural differences (in broad, regional, and white matter
measures) mediated sex variation in scores on two cognitive
tests, one tapping a mixture of fluid and crystallized reasoning
skills (skills previously found to be linked to brain volumes;
Pietschnig et al. 2015) and one testing processing speed (previ-
ously found to be linked to white matter microstructural differ-
ences; see Penke et al. 2012). At the functional level, we also
examined large-scale organization of functional networks in
the brain using resting-state fMRI functional connectivity data
and data-driven network-based analyses.
Materials and Methods
Participants
UK Biobank (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) is a large, population-
based biomedical study comprising around 500,000 participants
recruited from across Great Britain (England, Scotland, and
Wales) between 2006 and 2014 (Allen et al. 2012; Collins 2012;
Miller et al., 2016). After an initial visit for the gathering of medi-
cal and other information, a subset of these participants began
attending for head MRI scanning. MRI data from 5216 partici-
pants were available for the present study (mean age = 61.72
years, SD = 7.51, range = 44.23–77.12), collected at an average of
around 4 years after the initial visit, and completed on an MRI
scanner in Manchester, UK (that is, all data in this analysis were
collected on the same scanner; see below for scanner details).
There were 2750 females (mean age = 61.12 years, SD = 7.42,
range = 44.64–77.12) and 2466 males (mean age = 62.39 years, SD
= 7.56, range = 44.23–76.99). Further details regarding the demo-
graphics and representativeness of the sample are reported in
the Supplemental Materials.
UK Biobank received ethical approval from the Research
Ethics Committee (reference 11/NW/0382). The present analy-
ses were conducted as part of UK Biobank application 10 279.
All participants provided informed consent to participate.
Further information on the consent procedure can be found
under the “Resources” tab at the following URL: http://biobank.
ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id = 200.
Brain Image Acquisition and Processing
MRI data for all participants were acquired on a single Siemens
Skyra 3 T scanner, according to previously-reported procedures
(Miller et al. 2016; Online Documentation: http://biobank.ctsu.
ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=2367; http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/
crystal/refer.cgi?id=1977). Briefly, the acquired 3D MPRAGE T1-
weighted volumes were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL
tools (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) by the UK Biobank brain
imaging team. This included a raw, de-faced T1-weighted vol-
ume, a reduced field-of-view (FoV) T1-weighted volume, and
further processing, which included skull stripping, bias field
correction
and
gross
tissue
segmentation
using
FNIRT
(Andersson et al. 2001, 2007a, 2007b) and FAST (Zhang et al.
2001), yielding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey and white matter
volumes. Where large, common artefacts, such as head move-
ment, were identified during scanning, image acquisition was
re-started. However, visual quality control was not systemati-
cally undertaken by the UK Biobank team; this would be unfea-
sible due to the very large sample size (Alfaro-Almagro et al.
2018). Subcortical segmentation was also conducted by the UK
Biobank imaging team using FIRST (Patenaude et al. 2011) to
provide the volumes of 15 structures (atlas in Fig. S1). These
data are made available to researchers registered with UK
Biobank
as
a
downloadable
dataset
of
Imaging
Derived
Phenotypes (IDPs). No significant changes were made to scan-
ner hardware or software during the period of MRI data acquisi-
tion; full details on protocol phases and relevant upgrades are
available at the following URL: http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/
crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf.
Subregional Analyses
In addition, we used the FoV-reduced T1-weighted volumes from
the first release of UK Biobank MRI data to reconstruct and seg-
ment the cortical mantle using default parameters in FreeSurfer
v5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/; Fischl and Dale 2000;
Fischl et al. 2004; Ségonne et al. 2007), according to the Desikan–
Killiany atlas (Desikan et al. 2006). Visual checking of each segmen-
tation (including tissue identification and boundary positioning
errors) was performed at the University of Edinburgh according to
the pipeline suggested by the ENIGMA consortium (https://drive.
google.com/file/d/0Bw8Acd03pdRSU1pNR05kdEVWeXM/view)
and
implemented in our previous work (e.g., Cox et al. 2018); we
removed severe failures (including global tissue identification
errors, for which cases were removed listwise), and also regional
parcellation errors (such as minor skull-stripping or boundary-
positioning errors, for which ROIs were removed casewise). The
volume, thickness, and surface area of all 68 cortical regions of
interest (see atlas in Fig. S3) were extracted for 3875 participants.
The magnitudes of sex differences across the cortical surface were
visualized using the freely-available Liewald-Cox Heatmapper tool
(http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/research/resources/software-resources/
software). We also registered the vertices of each participants’ cor-
tical model to the FreeSurfer average pial surface, smoothed at
20 mm full width half maximum. Vertex-wise regression analyses
were then conducted across each aligned cortical vertex for
volume, surface area, and thickness using the SurfStat MATLAB
toolbox
(http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat)
for
Matrix
Laboratory R2014a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA).

 (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id = 1977), and in
Miller et al. (2016). Following gradient distortion correction, and
further correction for head movement and eddy currents,
BEDPOSTx was used to model within-voxel multi-fiber tract ori-
entation, followed by probabilistic tractography (with crossing
fiber modeling) using PROBTRACKx (Behrens et al. 2003, 2007;
Jbabdi et al. 2012). The AutoPtx plugin for FSL (de Groot et al.
2013) was used to map 27 major white matter tracts from which
tract-average fractional anisotropy was derived. On the basis of
the factor analyses described by Cox et al. (2016), we selected 22
of the white matter tracts for inclusion in the present study.
Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)
modeling was conducted using the AMICO tool (https://github.
com/daducci/AMICO; Daducci et al. 2015), and the resultant ori-
entation dispersion (OD) maps were registered with the AutoPtx
tract masks to yield an average OD value per tract. These mea-
sures were also derived by the UK Biobank imaging team and
were available as IDPs. An atlas of the selected white matter
tracts is provided in Figure S4.
Note that the mean sex differences in the white matter micro-
structural parameters studied here were already reported by
Cox et al. (2016). Here, we add the analyses of variance differ-
ences, and the mediation models with diffusion properties as the
mediator of the sex difference in cognitive abilities (see below).
Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI)
To analyze resting-state connectivity, we used bulk data from
network matrices generated by UK Biobank. As described in the
Online Methods section of Miller et al. (2016), participants lay in
the scanner and were instructed to “keep their eyes fixated on
a crosshair, relax, and “think of nothing in particular””. Data
preprocessing, group-Independent Components Analysis (ICA)
parcellation, and connectivity estimation were carried out by
UK Biobank using FSL packages (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/
crystal/refer.cgi?id=1977). The following preprocessing proce-
dures
were
applied:
motion
correction
using
MCFLIRT
(Jenkinson et al. 2002), grand-mean intensity normalization
using a single multiplicative factor, high-pass temporal filtering
with a Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight line fitting
(sigma was set as 50.0 s), EPI unwarping using a field map
scanned before data collection, gradient distortion correction
(GDC) unwarping, and removal of structural artefacts using an
ICA-based X-noiseifier (Beckmann and Smith 2004). Any gross
preprocessing failure was visually checked and eliminated
(Miller et al. 2016). Group-ICA parcellation was conducted on
4162 participants. The preprocessed EPI images were fed into
the MELODIC tool in FSL to generate 100 distinct ICA compo-
nents (45 were removed as noise after visual quality-control,
leaving 55 components for analysis). The spatial maps for the
components are available at the following URL: http://www.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/datasets/ukbiobank/index.html. Details of pre-
processing steps can be found in pages 12, 15 and 16 of Brain
Imaging Document (version 1.3) from UK Biobank data show-
case website: https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/brain_
mri.pdf.
Time series data from the 55 components were used for con-
nectivity analysis, with each component as a node. Two 55 × 55
matrices of fully-normalized temporal correlations and partial
temporal correlations were derived for each participant. A larger
absolute number indicates stronger temporal connectivity, and
the valence represents whether the connection is positive or
negative. Partial temporal correlation matrices were used for
analysis, as they represent direct connections better than full
temporal correlations. Estimation of the partial correlation coef-
ficients was conducted using FSLnets package in FSL (https://fsl.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLNets). To produce a sparser partial
correlation matrix, L2 regularization was applied by setting rho
as 0.5 in the Ridge Regression “netmats” option. A description of
the settings for the estimations is available at the following URL:
http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=9028. To better
illustrate the group-average network matrix, the nodes were
clustered into 5 categories based on the full-correlation matrices
(Miller et al. 2016). The group-average network matrix is shown
in Figure S13.
Before
analysis
of
sex
differences,
we
multiplied
the
strength of each connection by the sign of its group-mean
(Smith et al. 2015). For example, where the time series data
from two ICA components were positively correlated, but the
valence of the connection at the level of the group was nega-
tive, the valence for that individual was determined to be nega-
tive; that is, individual valences were determined by the
valence of that connection at the level of the group. In this
way, the valence of the majority of participants’ connections
for each node were positive, allowing us to investigate the
degree to which temporal connectivity differed by sex without
combining positive and negative effects and losing information
on the absolute magnitude. We then tested the association of
sex with the strength of connections, using the glm function in
R. As in the other analyses, age and ethnicity were controlled
by using them as covariates. Any participant without age or
ethnicity information was excluded. 4004 participants were
therefore included in this part of the analysis (mean age =
61.63, SD = 7.56; 47.65% male). To assess the importance of the
nodes, we generated the weighted degree for a node by calcu-
lating the mean strength of its connections with all 54 other
nodes. Full results for connection strength (partial and full cor-
relations) and for weighted degree are provided as 3 separate
tabs in Table S14. In that table, Cohen’s d-values are provided
as standardized effect sizes of the sex difference in the strength
of connectivity: as for the other analyses, a negative effect size
means the strength of the connection was higher in males, and
a positive effect size means it was higher in females.
Cognitive Testing
Cognitive testing took place at the same visit as the MRI scan.
Two tests were analyzed here: “fluid intelligence” (henceforth
called “verbal-numerical reasoning”), and reaction time. These
are described in detail in the Supplemental Materials.
Statistical Analysis
This section provides a summary of the statistical analyses we
ran;
a
fuller
technical
description
is
provided

the
Supplemental Materials.
We first adjusted all variables for age and ethnicity (both of
which may have been associated with differences in brain mea-
sures; Cox et al. 2016; Isamah et al. 2010; Tang et al. 2010). In
some analyses, as described below, we adjusted for total brain
volume and height. The adjustment techniques are described
in the Supplemental Materials.
Welch’s t-test was used for the mean comparisons, and a
variance ratio test (F-test) was used to assess differences in the
variance
between
the
sexes.
To
calculate
the
associated
Cohen’s d-value for each t-test, we multiplied the t-value by 2
and divided it by the square root of the degrees of freedom. The
difference between correlations for each sex was calculated

 using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation and a z-test (using the r.test
function in the psych package for R; Revelle 2016). P-values were
adjusted, within each analysis and within each brain measure,
with
the
False
Discovery
Rate
correction
(Benjamini
and
Hochberg 1995; for example, the P-values for all the sex compari-
sons on volume were corrected separately from the P-values for
all the sex comparisons on surface area) using the P.adjust func-
tion (with the “fdr” correction) for R. We used an alpha level of
0.05 to denote statistical significance. In an additional Bayesian
analysis of the mean difference, we used the BayesFactor package
for R (Morey and Rouder 2015) to compute BF10 values from a
Bayesian t-test (using the ttestBF function; see Supplemental
Materials).
We used cross-sectional mediation models (in a structural
equation modeling framework) to test whether the brain vari-
ables (total brain volume, grey matter volume, white matter
volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, general
fractional anisotropy, and general orientation dispersion—the
latter two estimated as latent variables—each in separate mod-
els, as well as specific brain regions) were significant mediators
of the relation between sex and cognitive ability (either verbal-
numerical
reasoning
score
or
reaction
time,
in
separate
models). We also ran multiple-mediator models that used indi-
vidual brain subregions as mediators of the sex-cognitive rela-
tion, instead of overall measures. All methods for running the
mediation analyses, along with the equation used to calculate
a
“percentage
of
mediation”
for
each
brain
variable,
are
described in the Supplemental Materials.
Results
Sex Differences in Overall and Subcortical Brain
Volumes
The subcortical structures examined were the hippocampus,
the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, the caudate nucleus,
the dorsal pallidum, the putamen, and the thalamus (Fig. S1).
Raw volumetric sex differences are illustrated in Figure 1. The
male distributions were further to the right, indicating higher
means, and wider, indicating greater variance. This was con-
firmed by computing shift functions (Rousselet et al. 2017) for
each overall and subcortical brain structure, illustrated in
Figure S2a for the raw values and Figure S2b for the values cor-
rected for total brain volume (TBV). There was a substantial
degree of overlap between the sexes on all measures.
We first tested for mean sex differences in overall cortical
and subcortical brain volumes, adjusting each measure for age
and ethnicity (analyses adjusted for TBV were performed sepa-
rately and are described below). We examined differences in
total as well as grey and white matter volumes separately.
Differences are shown in Table 1. We observed statistically sig-
nificant sex differences (adjusted for multiple comparisons
using the False Discovery Rate correction), all showing larger
volume in males. Note that, in what follows, negative effect
sizes indicate higher values for males, and positive effect sizes
indicate higher values for females. The effect sizes ranged from
small to large; for example, Cohen’s d = −0.39 and −0.31 for the
left and right nucleus accumbens volume, respectively; −1.41,
−1.28, and −1.49 for total, grey matter, and white matter
volumes respectively. The average difference for the 14 subcor-
tical volumes was d = −0.70. A set of Bayesian t-tests (see
Supplemental Materials and Table 1) confirmed that the mean
sex differences were very large, with extremely strong evidence
in favor of the hypothesis that males differed from females on
every overall and subcortical volume. We also tested for age-
by-sex interactions, assessing whether brain measures were
more strongly associated with age in males or females. This
was not the case for the overall measures (adjusted P-values >
0.8). However, all of the subcortical measures except the amyg-
dala and the caudate showed significant interactions, indicat-
ing that the age association was stronger (and the implied age
trend steeper) for males. Note that the reported effect sizes
come from t-tests on variables adjusted for age and sex, but not
their interaction.
We tested whether sex differences in the subcortical mea-
sures were accounted for by the substantial difference in total
brain volume. We regressed each subcortical variable on total
brain volume, testing these adjusted residuals for sex differ-
ences. After this adjustment, there were no longer statistically
significant differences in the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, or
thalamus (all Padj-values > 0.60, absolute d-values < 0.03;
Table S1). There remained differences in each of the other mea-
sures, albeit with attenuated effect sizes (average d for signifi-
cant differences after adjustment = 0.17). Females had greater
nucleus accumbens volume after adjustment for total brain
volume (d = .08, Padj = .07 for left accumbens; d = 0.10, Padj =
0.003 for right). Overall, the majority of the sex differences in
specific subcortical structures appeared to be linked to the dif-
ference in total brain size (average pre-adjustment attenuation
of d-values for subcortical structures = 85.0%). We also ran
analyses adjusting for height, since overall body size may have
influenced these differences (as expected, males were substan-
tially taller on average: d = −2.15). This attenuated all of the
d-values (average attenuation across global and subcortical
measures = 71.3%), but males still showed significantly larger
volumes for all subcortical regions except the nucleus accum-
bens (Table S1). For example, post-adjustment d-values were
−0.42 for total brain volume, −0.31 for grey matter volume, and
−0.47 for white matter volume. The Bayesian analyses, also
shown in Table S1, again confirmed these results: for instance,
showing more evidence for the null hypothesis of no difference
for the bilateral nucleus accumbens after adjustment for
height, but still showing substantially more evidence for the
hypothesis of a difference for all other regions.
As shown in Table 1, there were statistically significant vari-
ance differences in all overall cortical and subcortical brain
volumes, with males showing greater variance; the average vari-
ance ratio for overall volumes and subcortical volumes was 0.82
(variance ratios <1.00 indicate greater male variance). After adjust-
ing for total brain volume or height, the variance differences
reported in Table 1 remained relatively unchanged (see Table S1).
Sex Differences in Subregional Brain Volume, Surface
Area, and Cortical Thickness
Using FreeSurfer to parcellate cortical regions according to the
Desikan–Killiany neuroanatomical atlas (Desikan et al. 2006;
S3), we tested for sex differences in (raw) volume, surface area,
and cortical thickness across 68 cortical subregions. As with the
analyses above, we adjusted all subregions for age and ethnic-
ity; P-values were also adjusted within each measure type
using the False Discovery Rate correction. The results are illus-
trated in Figure 2A (see also Table S2 for means, standard
deviations, and difference tests for volume, surface area, and
cortical thickness across all cortical regions).
Males showed larger brain volume across all cortical subre-
gions. The sex difference was statistically significant in every
subregion, ranging in size from small (d = −0.24 in the right

 temporal pole) to large (d = −1.03 in the right insula). The mean
d-value across all subregions was −0.67 (Padj-values < 9.00 ×
10−13).
Even
larger
differences,
all
favouring
males,
were
observed for surface area; these ranged from moderate (d =
−0.43 in the left caudal anterior cingulate) to large (d = −1.20 in
the left superior frontal region). The mean d-value across all
subregions was −0.83 (all Padj-values < 2.00 × 10−36).
Cortical thickness displayed a different pattern. Unlike vol-
ume and surface area, females had thicker cortex across almost
the entire brain. The only area where males showed a statisti-
cally significantly thicker cortex was the right (but not left)
insula, and the difference was small (d = 0.14). In all other
areas, there was either no significant thickness difference (20/
68 areas), or a statistically significant difference favouring
females. The mean d-value in the 47 areas that reached statisti-
cal significance after multiple-comparisons correction was 0.22,
ranging from d = 0.07 in the right rostral middle frontal region
to d = 0.45 in the left inferior parietal region. Overall, higher
female cortical thickness was generally not found in the tem-
poral lobe (except the parahippocampal gyrus) or in the medial
orbitofrontal regions. In some regions there appeared to be con-
verse differences: in the motor and somatosensory regions in
the parietal lobe, the frontal pole, and the parahippocampal
gyrus, females showed relatively higher thickness but males
showed relatively higher volume and surface area. In the
superior temporal lobe and orbitofrontal regions, males showed
relatively higher volume and surface area, but there was no
particular sex difference in thickness. Once more, all of the sub-
regional analyses were confirmed using the alternative Bayes
Factor analyses.
We also tested age-by-sex interactions for each of the 3 vari-
ables (volume, surface area, and cortical thickness; Table S2).
After multiple-comparisons correction, only two interactions
were significant: the left and right superior frontal regions
showed significantly stronger volume relations with age in
males. That is, males may have had steeper volume decline in
this region bilaterally with age. There were no statistically sig-
nificant age-by-sex interactions for surface area or cortical
thickness.
We next adjusted the subregional volume, surface area, and
cortical thickness measures for total brain volume, total surface
area, or mean cortical thickness, respectively. As shown in
Figure 2B (and Table S3, which also shows the surface area and
cortical thickness measures adjusted for total volume, since
this is a common procedure in neuroimaging analyses), 11
regions were still significantly larger in volume for males
(mean d = −0.14; the largest being the left isthmus cingulate,
d = −0.22). There were also 13 regions where females now had a
significantly larger volume (mean d = 0.15; the largest differ-
ence being in the right superior parietal, d = 0.21). The majority
of regions (44/68) no longer showed significant volume differ-
ences (all Padj-values > .34). For surface area, males were signifi-
cantly larger in 18/68 areas after total surface area adjustment
(mean d = −0.12, the largest difference in the right pars orbita-
lis; d = −0.16), and females were larger in 9 (mean d = 0.11; the
largest being the left caudal anterior cingulate, d = 0.18). The
remaining 41 surface areas showed no significant difference (all
Padj-values > .05) For cortical thickness, after correction for
mean thickness there were still significant differences favour-
ing females in 24/68 regions (mean d = 0.17; the largest in the

 left inferior parietal, d = 0.32), but also 25 regions with differ-
ences favouring males (mean d = −0.16, the largest in the right
insula, d = −0.34). Next, we adjusted the cortical subregional
measures for height (Table S4). For volume, all of the compari-
sons were still significant, but with reduced effect sizes (−0.33 <
d < −0.07, mean d = −0.19, all Padj-values < .05); this was the
same for surface area (−0.35 < d < −0.10, mean d = −0.25, all
Padj-values < .002). For thickness, there were 34/68 regions that
were still significantly thicker in females (mean d = 0.12, the
largest in the left inferior parietal, d = 0.19), and one thicker in
males (the left entorhinal cortex, d = −0.08).
Variance differences across the 3 structural measures are
illustrated in Figure 2C. For volume and surface area, males
showed significantly greater variance than females across
almost all brain regions. The volume variance ratio was signifi-
cant in 64/68 regions, ranging from 0.88 in the right temporal
pole to 0.67 in the left isthmus cingulate, with all Padj-values <
.031 after correction. The surface area variance ratio was signif-
icant in 66/68 regions, ranging from 0.88 in the left pars orbita-
lis to 0.65 in the left isthmus cingulate, all Padj-values < .018
after correction. For cortical thickness (Fig. 2C), there were no
significant variance differences in any region (all Padj-values >
.14) except one: females showed significantly greater variance
in the thickness of the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (VR =
1.19, Padj = .01). As can be observed from Figure S5 (and
Table S3), controlling for the respective overall measures made
only a negligible difference to the pattern of variance ratios
reported above.
We tested whether the regions showing larger mean differ-
ences were also those with larger variance differences, by cor-
relating the vector of d-values with the vector of VRs for each
brain measure. As shown in Figures S6 and S7, there was some
correspondence between mean and variance: in the unadjusted
analysis, mean and variance were correlated at r = .51 for vol-
ume, but there were smaller correlations for surface area and
thickness (r-values = .25 and −.06, respectively). Adjusted for
TBV, all 3 correlations were relatively weak (r-values = .22, .03,
and −.25 for the 3 brain measures respectively).
To verify whether the pattern of results across the cortical
mantle was agnostic to the gyral boundaries of the Desikan–
Killiany atlas, we conducted a supplemental analysis, testing
sex differences using a vertex-wise approach, the results of
which are shown in Figures S8 (for mean differences) and S9
(for variance differences). This precisely replicated the subre-
gional atlas-based results.
Sex Differences in White Matter Microstructure
We tested sex differences in 22 white matter tracts. We focused
on two white matter microstructural properties that had previ-
ously been shown to demonstrate differences between males
and females in the initial release of UK Biobank imaging data
(Cox et al. 2016). The first was fractional anisotropy (FA), an
index of the directionality of water diffusion through the white
matter. The second was orientation dispersion (OD), a NODDI
measure of white matter tract complexity. For FA, there were
generally higher values in males, particularly in the cortico-
spinal tract (d = −0.54) and the acoustic radiation (d = −0.51).
The average difference across tracts was d = −0.19. OD was
higher in all tracts for females (average d = 0.30). These mean
differences are shown in Figure 3, and fully reported in
Tables S5 and S6.
Variance differences are illustrated in Figure S10 (see also
Tables S5 and S6). Generally, there was greater male variance
in FA (average VR = 0.92); however, there was substantially
greater female variance in the cortico-spinal tract in particular
(VR = 1.17, P = .0003). For OD, the only tract that showed a sig-
nificant variance difference following FDR correction was the
left superior thalamic radiation, where males showed greater
variance (VR = 0.79).
Adjusting the microstructural measures attenuated the size
of the mean sex differences in FA (in one case producing a sig-
nificantly higher score in females that was not present in the
raw analysis, for the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus;
Table S5). For OD, this adjustment made very few changes to
the mean differences (Table S6). The TBV adjustment left the
variance differences broadly unchanged—in some cases with a
small increase in the size of the sex difference—for both FA
and OD. This attenuation in the size of the mean sex differ-
ences in FA, but not OD, after adjustment for TBV may be a
result of FA’s sensitivity to “partial volume” effects.
Relation of Neurostructural Differences to Cognitive
Differences
We linked the structural brain differences to scores on two cog-
nitive tests taken at the time of the imaging visit: verbal-
numerical
reasoning
and
reaction
time
(see
Method).
Descriptive statistics for the cognitive tests are shown in
Table 1. Note that we coded both tests (reflecting the reaction
time variable) so that higher scores indicated better perfor-
mance. The test scores correlated positively, but weakly (r =
.12). Males had a slightly higher mean score than females on
verbal-numerical reasoning (d = −0.18) and slightly faster mean
reaction time (d = −0.22); there was no significant variance dif-
ference for verbal-numerical reasoning (VR = 0.97, P = .45),
though males had marginally more variance in reaction time
(VR = 0.92, P = .03).
As a first step toward the mediation analyses, we correlated
performance on the two cognitive tests with the overall brain
measures in the full sample (Table S7), and in two randomly-
selected sample halves separately (Table S8). The sample was
split in this way to avoid overfitting and assess the replicability
of the results. We then ran the same correlations across all the
raw brain subregions, for volume, surface area, and cortical
thickness (Table S9). These correlations were generally small,
with all brain-cognitive r-values <.20. We compared the size of
the correlations across the sexes; after multiple comparisons
correction, there were no significant sex differences in these
correlations. Thus, there was no evidence in the present analy-
sis for sex differences in how regional brain structure related to
the two measured cognitive skills.
Next, we tested the extent to which the mean cognitive dif-
ferences were mediated by any of the overall brain measures
(total, grey, and white matter volumes, total surface area, mean
cortical thickness, or general factors of FA or OD). We ran a sep-
arate model, illustrated in Figure S11, for each brain measure.
Results are
displayed in
Tables S10
and S11
for
verbal-
numerical
reasoning
and
reaction
time,
respectively.
For
verbal-numerical reasoning, the sex difference in test scores
was mediated substantially by brain volume measures and by
surface area (all mediation percentages >82%). Cortical thick-
ness showed far smaller mediation percentages (7.1% and 5.4%
in the two sample halves, respectively). For reaction time, total
brain and white matter volumes had mediation percentages
>27%, but the other measures all produced smaller percentages
(<15.3%), particularly mean cortical thickness (mediating <3%
of the variance).

 Finally, we tested which (raw) brain subregions were most
important in explaining the mediation of the sex-cognitive rela-
tion, by running mediation models that included multiple indi-
vidual regions as mediators. These variables were selected for
their association with the cognitive ability in question (again,
either verbal-numerical reasoning or reaction time) using LASSO
regression models (see Method for details). The percentage of
mediation for each selected region is illustrated in Figure 4 (see
Figure S12 and Table S12 for full results). For verbal-numerical
reasoning, the volume and surface area of the superior temporal
region mediated the largest amounts of variance (29.1% and
18.4% in their respective models), with other relatively substan-
tial contributions coming from the precuneus and insula for vol-
ume, and the pars opercularis and rostral middle frontal regions
for surface area. For the cortical thickness predictors, and for the
outcome of reaction time, as expected on the basis of the overall
mediation results reported above, few of the regions showed
substantial mediation (there was some mediation by the volume
of frontal regions; at most 7.3% by the frontal pole).
Sex Differences in Resting-state Functional Connectivity
For our final set of analyses, we examined sex differences in
resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) responses within a num-
ber of functional networks. The connections between each pair
of functional networks were estimated and then transformed
into measures of strength (see Method). We found that 54.7%
(811 of 1485) of network connections showed a statistically sig-
nificant sex difference (absolute β-values = 0.071–0.447 for
females; 0.071–0.519 for males). A map showing the strengths
of the connections between the 55 network nodes, and whether
the difference was stronger in males (blue) or females (red) is
provided in Figure 5A (see also Table S13). The strength of con-
nectivity between sensorimotor, visual, and rostral lateral pre-
frontal areas was absolutely higher in males than females (see
the cluster of brain regions with orange numerals in Fig. 5A),
whereas the strength of connectivity within the default mode
network (DMN; cluster of regions with red numerals in Fig. 5A)
was absolutely higher in females than males.
To further analyze these functional sex differences, we calcu-
lated the mean strength of all 54 connections to each individual
node, producing a “weighted degree” statistic. Sex differences in
weighted degree are shown in Figure 5B,C . Males showed
stronger weighted degree than females in bilateral sensorimotor
areas, the visual cortex, and the rostral lateral prefrontal cortex.
Females showed stronger weighted degree than males in cortical
areas comprising the DMN: the bilateral posterior cingulate cor-
tex/precuneus, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, medial pre-
frontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, anterior temporal lobe,
medial
temporal
lobe
(e.g.,
hippocampus
and
surrounding
areas), and some cerebellar regions (see Tables S13 and S14).
Discussion
In a single-scanner sample of over 5000 participants from UK
Biobank, we mapped sex differences in brain volume, surface
area, cortical thickness, diffusion parameters, and functional
connectivity. One main theme of the neurostructural results
was that associations with sex were global. Males generally had
larger volumes and surface areas, whereas females had thicker
cortices. The differences were substantial: in some cases, such
as total brain volume, more than a standard deviation. The
effect size of d = −1.41 for total brain volume (Table 1) trans-
lates to 92.1% of males being above the female mean, and an
84.1% chance that a randomly-chosen male will have a larger
total brain volume than a randomly-chosen female. (The fol-
lowing online app can be used to calculate further such values:
http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/.)
We also found that volume and surface area mediated nearly
all of the small sex difference in reasoning ability, but far less of
the difference in reaction time. For white matter microstructure,
females showed lower directionality (FA) and higher tract com-
plexity (OD); white matter microstructure was a poor mediator
of the cognitive sex difference. Resting-state fMRI analyses also
revealed a global effect: around 54% of connections showed a
sex difference. These differences clustered around specific net-
works, with stronger connectivity in females in the default
mode network and stronger connectivity in males between
unimodal sensory and motor cortices as well as high-level corti-
cal areas in the rostral lateral prefrontal cortex. For every brain
measure that showed even large sex differences, there was
always overlap between males and females (see Fig. 1): even in
the case of the large difference in total brain volume noted
above, there was 48.1% sample overlap.
The principal strengths of the present study are its sample
size (providing sensitivity for the identification of small effects

both measures, numerically the largest effect was found in the right cortico-spinal tract. See Figure S4 for tract atlas.

 with high statistical power), the wide range of MRI modalities,
and the consideration of both mean and variance differences.
Given the surfeit of small-n studies in neuroscience (Button
et al. 2013; Nord et al. 2017), it is of great importance to test
hypotheses in large, well-powered samples, especially given
that many neural sex differences are modest in size (Joel et al.

size of the sex correlation. In order to show the regions with the largest associations with sex, only regions that had intensity over 50% of the whole-brain peak value
are presented. See Table S14 for values for each connection and for each node’s weighed degree.

 2015). Here, we had excellent statistical power to find small
effects in brain subregions, providing a robust and detailed
analysis. For our subregional analysis, we had a far larger sam-
ple size than the most recent meta-analysis (Ruigrok et al.
2014). In contrast to that meta-analysis—which found greater
volume for females in areas such as the thalamus, the anterior
cingulate gyrus, and the lateral occipital cortex—our study
found no brain subregions where females had a larger volume
than males. The reason for this may be the more restricted age
range of the participants in our study (sex may relate differ-
ently to the brain at different ages, as we found for several
brain regions in our age-by-sex interaction analyses, and as
was found in a previous developmental study of children and
adolescents; Gennatas et al. 2017) or, more likely, study size
and heterogeneity: the data for section of the meta-analysis on
regional volumes came from many separate studies, on sepa-
rate scanners, generally with small sample sizes (many with
n < 100), whereas our contrasts were based on one very large,
single-scanner study.
The higher male volume in our study appeared largest in
some regions involved in emotion and decision-making, such
as the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, the bilateral insula, and the
left isthmus of the cingulate gyrus (Craig 2009; MacPherson
et al. 2015; Ochsner and Gross 2005; Wager et al. 2008; note that
the insula showing the largest sex difference is consistent with
a
recent
large-scale
study
of
children
and
adolescents
(Gennatas et al. 2017)—it appears this region retains its sub-
stantial sex difference into later life), but also areas such as the
right fusiform gyrus. For surface area, which showed an even
larger difference favouring males, the regions that showed the
largest effects were broadly areas involved in the hypothesized
intelligence-related circuit in the “P-FIT” model (Jung and Haier
2007): for example, the bilateral superior frontal gyri, the bilat-
eral precentral gyri, the left supramarginal gyrus, and the bilat-
eral rostral middle frontal areas. However, some of the regions
involved in this theorized circuit were also larger, in terms of
thickness, for females. For instance, the bilateral inferior parie-
tal regions were the regions with numerically the largest differ-
ence favouring females in cortical thickness. Our finding that
raw cortical thickness was greater for females—a finding with a
smaller mean effect than the one in the opposite direction for
volume or surface area—is consistent with a number of previ-
ous, smaller studies (e.g., Luders et al. 2006; Sowell et al. 2007;
Lv et al. 2010; van Velsen et al. 2013; though not others: Salat
et al. 2004; Reid et al. 2010). Our greater statistical power may
have allowed us to find smaller differences in thickness across
the cortex. It is interesting to note that a previous study from
the animal literature found greater cortical thickness in male
mice (Markham et al. 2003); however, this study had a small
sample size and by necessity used very different methods from
ours: further comparison of sex differences in the brains across
different species might reveal more about the cellular mecha-
nisms underlying these differences.
Whereas previous work has found some white matter
regions where fractional anisotropy was higher for females
(Kanaan et al. 2012; Dunst et al. 2014), we found that males
showed higher FA in 18 of the 22 tracts we examined. FA also
generally showed greater variance in males. On the other hand,
higher orientation dispersion was found for females in all
tracts. Unexpectedly, higher OD was found to be related to
lower cognitive performance on the two tests examined here.
Since OD is a relatively new measure of white matter micro-
structure (Daducci et al. 2015), further work should aim to clar-
ify its behavioral correlates. The fact that (as described in the
Method section) measurement invariance did not hold across
the sexes for the latent variables of FA and OD, indicating that
the tract-specific measurements may be assessing somewhat
different latent variables in each sex, may also be of interest for
future researchers examining general-level indicators of white
matter microstructure.
The issue of adjusting for overall brain size in analyses of
sex differences (Rippon et al. 2014) was addressed in each of
our macrostructural analyses. As can be seen comparing
Figure 2A and B, after this adjustment the higher male volume
and surface area was substantially reduced, often to non-
significance. For those latter brain regions, this implies that the
sex difference was general and that the larger volume or sur-
face area was a by-product of the overall larger male brain.
However, for some regions, especially for surface area (particu-
larly in areas such as the left isthmus of the cingulate gyrus
and the right precentral gyrus), males still showed a signifi-
cantly higher measurement, indicating specific sex differences
in the proportional configuration of the cortex, holding brain
size equal. Most interestingly, for some areas (for example the
right insula, the right fusiform gyrus, and the left isthmus of
the cingulate gyrus), the difference was reversed after adjust-
ment, with females showing significantly larger brain volume.
A recent meta-analysis of sex differences in amygdala vol-
ume (Marwha et al. 2016) found that, although males showed
larger raw volume, after correction for total brain volume there
was no longer an appreciable sex difference. However, in our
study the amygdala was significantly, but modestly, larger in
males even after adjusting for total brain volume (d = 0.18 bilat-
erally). The heterogeneity in the methods of the studies being
meta-analyzed may have led to the divergent conclusion from
our single-sample study. With regard to the hippocampus,
however, we found results consistent with another recent
meta-analysis (Tan et al. 2016): there were no longer significant
sex differences after adjustment for total brain volume (this
was also the case for the thalamus and caudate). We recom-
mend that future studies perform comparisons both before and
after adjusting for total volume (or the relevant overall mea-
sure, in the case of measures such as cortical thickness or sur-
face
area),
since
these
results
pertain
to
quite
different
questions: unadjusted, they ask which regions differ in an
absolute sense; adjusted, they ask which regions are different
relative to the overall size (or other overall measure) of the
brain. Both of these may be important questions to ask in dif-
ferent contexts.
One question that could not be addressed using the current
data regards the underlying bio-social causes, ultimate or prox-
imate, for the sex differences that we observed. Many variables
were collected in UK Biobank that might be linked to the sex
differences observed here (and may be proximal causes of
them) but our intention in the present study was to character-
ize, not necessarily explain, these differences: future research
should investigate more targeted hypotheses of the causes of
the differences. Sex differences in brain structure are observed
early in the life course (e.g., Knickmeyer et al. 2014), though
this does not imply that the pattern of adult differences we
observed is necessarily the same as is found in childhood. The
literature on developmental sex differentiation of the brain
highlights influences of factors, such as genes on sex chromo-
somes or sex hormones acting via receptors throughout the
developing and adult brain, that were not analyzed in the pres-
ent study (McCarthy and Arnold 2011; Lombardo et al. 2012;
McEwen and Milner 2017). Likewise, understanding the poten-

 development (Dawson et al. 2000) was beyond the scope of our
research and our dataset.
Our analysis also focused on sex differences in variance.
Here, for the first time in an adult sample, we directly tested
sex differences in the variance of several brain measures, find-
ing greater male variance across almost the entire brain for vol-
ume, surface area, and white matter fractional anisotropy, but
only patchy and inconsistent variance differences for cortical
thickness and white matter orientation dispersion. Our correla-
tion of the vector of mean differences with that of variance
ratios showed that there was some degree of correspondence
between them for volume, but the relation was far smaller for
surface area (and was near-zero for cortical thickness). In all
cases, this analysis indicated that mean and variance differ-
ences appear to be largely independent aspects of sex differ-
ences in the brain; we should not expect to see that areas
showing the largest difference in mean also show the largest
difference in variance, at least to a great extent.
One potential candidate to explain greater male variability
across multiple phenotypes is the hypothesized “female-pro-
tective” mechanism involving effects of the X chromosome
(Craig et al. 2009; Johnson et al. 2009; Reinhold and Engqvist
2013), or other protective factors that might “buffer” females
from potential deleterious consequences of rare genetic muta-
tions (Jacquemont et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2013). Such expla-
nations are speculative at present; as studies like UK Biobank
release even larger amounts of data on individuals who have
both neurostructural and genotype data, researchers will be
able to perform well-powered tests of these hypotheses.
In discussing any potential genetic effects on sex differ-
ences, analyses should take into account the fact that such
effects are likely active at multiple points across the lifespan,
representing a continuing, complex set of influences that may
interact with environment and experience. This complexity is
deepened by phenomena such as genomic imprinting (where
the expression profiles of certain genes differs according to
whether they were inherited paternally or maternally, which
has been hypothesized to contribute to the aforementioned
sex-biased nature of some psychiatric disorders; Dulac and
Christopher 2013) and the “mother’s curse” (a buildup of male-
specific mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed on
maternally; Gemmell et al. 2004).
Using the (limited) data on cognitive abilities available in
our sample, we tested whether the data were consistent with
any consequences of brain structural differences in terms of
ability differences. There were only weak correlations between
brain variables and the cognitive tests (consistent with previous
evidence of these links: Karama et al. 2014; Schnack et al. 2014;
Pietschnig et al. 2015), and these associations did not differ by sex
(consistent with the brain-volume-cognitive meta-analysis of
Pietschnig et al. 2015). Mediation modeling suggested that, for
verbal-numerical reasoning, a very large portion (up to 99%) of the
modest sex difference was mediated by brain volumetric and sur-
face area measures. Smaller fractions (up to 38%) of the modest
link between sex and reaction time could be explained by volume
or surface area. Perhaps unexpectedly, given evidence and theory
linking white matter microstructure to cognitive processing speed
(Penke et al. 2012; Bennett and Madden 2014), white matter micro-
structural measures only mediated a small proportion of the sex
difference in reaction time (this may have been due to weaknesses
in this cognitive measure; see below). Cortical thickness had trivial
mediating effects compared to volume and surface area: no more
than 7.1% of the sex-cognitive relation was mediated by thickness
in any analysis. With our multiple-mediator models, we built a
map of which brain regions were most relevant in this mediation
of the sex-cognitive relation (Fig. 4). Overall, the data were consis-
tent with higher volume and cortical surface area—but not cortical
thickness or microstructural characteristics—chiefly in the super-
ior temporal region, but also spread across multiple other regions
to a lesser extent, being of particular relevance to sex differences
in reasoning (but not reaction time).
An additional hypothesis—one that is not incompatible
with the hypothesis that some of the sex differences seen here
are a proximate cause of behavioral differences—is that brain
structural differences might sometimes be the result of com-
pensatory mechanisms for differences in sex-specific hor-
mones, and might thus act to reduce behavioral sex differences
that would otherwise have been present (De Vries 2004;
McCarthy and Arnold 2011). This perspective may in part
explain an apparent paradox in human sex difference research:
that the (raw) effect sizes found for brain measures such as vol-
ume and surface area are so large, whereas most behavioral
sex differences are so small (Hyde 2014). Our descriptive results
do not directly speak to any causal mechanisms, but it should
be borne in mind that they are compatible with these multiple
interpretations.
Sex differences in intrinsic functional connectome organiza-
tion also revealed results that corroborate and extend prior
work. We successfully replicated the results from the 1 000
Functional Connectomes dataset (an entirely separate dataset)—
that is, we found female > male connectivity within the default
mode network and some evidence for male>female connectivity
in sensorimotor and visual cortices (Biswal et al. 2010). The high-
er female connectivity within circuits like the DMN may be par-
ticularly important, given that DMN regions are often considered
as an important part of the “social brain” (Kennedy and Adolphs
2012; Mars et al. 2012; Amft et al. 2015). Whether such an effect
can help explain higher average female ability in domains like
social cognition (Gur et al. 2012), and whether such functional
differences can be integrated with differences in the structural
connectome (Ingalhalikar et al. 2014), remains to be seen.
Finally, recent work has shown that intrinsic functional connec-
tome organization can be parsimoniously described as a small
number of connectivity gradients (Margulies et al. 2016). The
most prominent connectivity gradient has at one pole the DMN
and at the other unimodal sensory and motor cortices. The
observed pattern of sex differences in functional connectome
organization observed here appears to recapitulate the two main
poles of that principal connectivity gradient (Margulies et al.
2016). One potential way of describing the biological significance
of these functional sex differences is that mechanisms involved
in shaping sex differences (biological, cultural, or developmen-
tal) may influence this principal connectivity gradient; the result,
which should be explored in future investigations of brain sex
differences, may be the multiple network differences found in
the present study.
Limitations
The UK Biobank sample was selective. It covered only one part of
the life course (from approximately 45 to 75 years of age), and
thus our findings may not apply to younger adults. With ageing
may come larger variation in some brain parameters (Cox et al.
2016), meaning that the distributions found here may not fully
represent those across the lifespan. Many of the female partici-
pants might have been undergoing, or have undergone, meno-
pause; this (or associated Hormone Replacement Therapy) might
exert modest effects on the structure of some regions of the brain

 (Zhang et al. 2016), effects which may themselves change with
increasing age. In addition, UK Biobank had a very low response
rate to invitations to participate (5.47% in the full sample of
~500,000; Allen et al. 2012). We would thus expect the individuals
studied here would not be fully representative of males and
females from the general UK population. This was the case for
education: individuals with college or university degrees were
over-represented (see Method), though the male:female educa-
tion ratio itself appeared representative. These selection effects
may in part explain the differences between our results and
those of previous studies and meta-analyses, as discussed above.
Although we adjusted for the effects of age, it should also be
noted—as for any study with a relatively wide age range—that
there was substantial variation in the birth date of the partici-
pants, undoubtedly leading to different (unmeasured) social
experiences during their development.
On the topic of age adjustment, it should also be noted that
we adjusted for linear effects of age, whereas some variables
may have nonlinear trends (although, given a preliminary anal-
ysis as described in the Supplemental Materials, we would not
expect this to affect the sex differences in these variables to a
substantial extent). We should also note that, as described in
the Supplementary Materials, there was a significant, yet small,
age difference between the sexes (men were older by 1.27 years
on average). A final issue of representativeness concerns clini-
cal outcomes. Although we noted above that there is much
interest in sex-differential patterns of psychiatric disorder diag-
noses, the unrepresentativeness of UK Biobank extends to gen-
erally low rates of such disorders in general in the sample. For
this reason, we did not attempt to link the MRI sex differences
observed here to clinical diagnoses, though studies of normal-
range variation in traits linked to psychiatric disease (such as
neuroticism, a known risk factor for Major Depressive Disorder;
Kotov et al. 2010), may produce more fruitful results.
Caution should be taken in interpreting the results of the
analyses involving the cognitive tests (the mediation analyses
in addition to the correlations). Whereas previous, representa-
tive studies (e.g., Johnson et al. 2008) have found no mean dif-
ference, but a variance difference, in general cognitive test
performance, the tests examined here showed mean differ-
ences but no strong variance differences. This may be due to
problems of sample representativeness (Dykiert et al. 2009), or
due to the tests tapping specific cognitive skills rather than
general ability (Burgaleta et al. 2012). The cognitive measures
were relatively psychometrically poor compared to a full IQ
assessment: the verbal-numerical reasoning test had only 13
items, and the reaction time test had only 4 trials that counted
towards the final score (see Lyall et al. 2016, for analyses of the
reliability
of
these
tests).
Although
the
tests—particularly
verbal-numerical
reasoning—have
some
external
validity
(Hagenaars et al. 2016), the above issues mean that the cogni-
tive analyses reported here should be considered preliminary.
Fuller cognitive testing, currently underway in UK Biobank, will
allow a more comprehensive exploration. Studies that use tests
where males or females are known to show higher average
scores (such as 3D mental rotation tests, which generally show
higher scores in males; Maeda and Yoon 2013), would poten-
tially allow for more informative results. In addition, cross-
sectional mediation models of observational data, such as
those used here, are inherently limited: they cannot address
causal relations between variables. The models were simple,
including only 3 main variables (sex, the brain measure, and
cognitive ability; Fig. S11). Note also that there exists a great
deal of debate over testing the quantifying the indirect effect in
mediation models (e.g., Hayes and Scharkow 2013). More com-
plex models, using longitudinal data and latent variables
derived from multiple cognitive tests, should be specified in
future research.
Finally, although this study used a wide variety of neuroim-
aging measures, it should be noted that these were but a small
selection of the possible modalities that we could have investi-
gated, and that studies should address in future. Other diffu-
sion and NODDI measures of white matter microstructure such
as radial and axial diffusivity and intracellular volume fraction
(Cox et al. 2016), cortical measures such as regional gyrification
(Gregory et al. 2016) and grey matter density (Ruigrok et al.
2014), and pathological brain structures such as white matter
hyperintensities (Wardlaw et al. 2015) and enlarged perivascu-
lar spaces (Potter et al. 2015) may show interesting patterns of
sex differences both across the population, and in how they
relate to healthy behavioral variation as well as disease states.
Conclusions
The present study is the largest single-sample study of neuro-
anatomical sex differences to date. We report evidence on the
pattern of sex differences in brain volume, surface area, cortical
thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connec-
tivity between adult males and females in the range between
middle- and older-age. As has previously been argued (Fine
2017), providing a clear characterization of neurobiological sex
differences is a step towards understanding patterns of differ-
ential prevalence in neurodevelopmental disorders such as
autism spectrum disorder (Baron-Cohen et al. 2011), a variety of
psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (Aleman et al.
2003), and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s
Disease (Viña and Lloret 2010; Mazure and Swendsen 2016). We
hope that the results provided here, given their large-scale,
multimodal nature, will constitute an authoritative point of ref-
erence for future studies on a wide range of questions on brain
sex differences. Insights into how and where the brain differs
as a function of sex—with considerably more precision than in
previous investigations—will enable more targeted examina-
tions into potential drivers of these differences across psychiat-
ric, psychological, and other domains. In particular, integrating
macrostructural, microstructural, and functional data is an
important long-term goal (Gur and Gur 2017). Data on many
thousands of further MRI scans (to a maximum sample of
100,000 with MRI data) will be available from UK Biobank in the
coming years, in addition to more complex cognitive testing
batteries and genotypic data. Future studies will be able to
explore in much greater depth the links between sex differ-
ences in the brain, their possible causes, and their potential
medical and behavioral consequences.
