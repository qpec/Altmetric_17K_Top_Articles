ABSTRACT
Background: Japanese rice cake (“mochi”) is a major cause of food-choking accidents in Japan. However, the epidemiology of
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) due to suffocation caused by rice cakes is poorly understood.
Methods: OHCA data from 2005 to 2012 were obtained from the population-based OHCA registry in Osaka Prefecture. Patients
aged ≥20 years who experienced OHCA caused by suffocation that occurred before the arrival of emergency-medical-service
(EMS) personnel were included. Patient characteristics, prehospital interventions, and outcomes were compared based on the
cause of suffocation (rice cake and non-rice-cake). The primary outcome was 1-month survival after OHCA.
Results: In total, 46 911 adult OHCAs were observed during the study period. Of the OHCAs, 7.0% (3,294=46,911) were due to
suffocation, with choking due to rice cake as the cause in 9.5% of cases (314=3,294), and of these, 24.5% (77=314) occurred
during the first 3 days of the New Year. In crude analysis, 1-month survival was 17.2% (54=314) in those with suffocation
caused by rice cake and 13.4% (400=2,980) in those with suffocation due to other causes. In the multivariable analysis for all-
cause suffocation, younger age, arrest witnessed by bystanders, and earlier EMS response time were significantly related to
better 1-month survival.
Conclusion: Approximately 10% of OHCAs due to suffocation were caused by rice-cake choking, and 25% of these occurred
during the first 3 days of the New Year. Further efforts for establishing preventive measures as well as improving the early
recognition of choking and encouraging bystanders to call EMS sooner are needed.

INTRODUCTION
More than 120 000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) are
documented in Japan every year,1 and OHCA is recognized as a
national public health problem. Approximately 40% of OHCAs
were of non-cardiac origin, and 20% of them were caused by
suffocation.2 Although numerous studies have been conducted to
examine prognostic factors for OHCAs of cardiac origin, non-
cardiac OHCAs, including those due to suffocation, have not
been studied in detail.
More than 9000 deaths are reported annually in Japan due to
accidental suffocation, and half of these deaths are attributed
to food choking.3 The most common cause of food-choking
accidents in Japan is rice cake, or “mochi,”4 which is a Japanese
traditional food made of glutinous rice pounded into paste and
molded into shape. While it is eaten throughout the year, it is
most commonly sold and consumed during the New Year
holidays. Since it is highly cohesive and adhesive, deaths due to
suffocation caused by rice cake consumption frequently occur
every year in Japan, especially among elderly people. According
to a report by the Tokyo Fire Department, between 2010 and
2014, more than 100 people were sent to the hospital due to rice-
cake-choking accidents each year in Tokyo, and 7.5% of them
died before the first medical examination.5 Considering the

 elderly population has been rapidly increasing in recent years in
Japan, it is necessary to evaluate and understand the character-
istics and factors related to outcomes after OHCAs caused by rice
cake-related choking in order to plan appropriate counter-
measures to prevent these accidents in the community setting.
A prospective population-based registry of OHCA in Osaka
Prefecture, the Utstein Osaka Project, covers a population of
approximately 8.8 million people and consecutively registers all
OHCA cases according to the Utstein-style guidelines.6,7 Using
this database, the present study aimed to investigate the charac-
teristics of patients, actual situation of prehospital interventions,
and outcomes after OHCA due to suffocation, with a particular
focus on suffocation caused by Japanese rice-cake choking.
METHODS
Study setting and EMS system in Osaka Prefecture
Osaka Prefecture is the third largest prefecture in Japan, having
8,865,245 residents in 2010 in an area of 1892 km2.8 Details of
the emergency medical service (EMS) system in Osaka Prefecture
have been described previously.2,9 Briefly, Osaka has 34 fire
stations with emergency dispatch centers, which operate a 24-
hour EMS system. When someone calls the number 119 (the
emergency telephone number for calling the ambulance or fire
department in Japan), an emergency dispatch center sends the
nearest ambulance available to the site. In general, since do-not-
resuscitate orders are not accepted in Japan, termination of
resuscitation on site by EMS personnel is not permitted.
Therefore, excluding cases of decapitation, incineration, decom-
position, rigor mortis, or dependent cyanosis, all OHCA patients
treated by EMS personnel are transported to hospitals.
Data collection
The Utstein Osaka Project is a large prospective population-based
cohort study of OHCA covering all of Osaka Prefecture. Data
registration in this project has been conducted based on the
Utstein-style guidelines, which are utilized worldwide as a
standardized reporting guideline for cardiac arrest.6,7 Cardiac
arrest is defined as the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity as
confirmed by the absence of signs of circulation.6,7 The arrest
is presumed to be of cardiac origin unless an apparent non-
cardiac cause is confirmed, including external causes (suffocation,
hanging, fall, drowning, traffic injury, drug overuse, and
unclassified external causes), respiratory disease, malignant
tumor, or stroke according to the hospital medical records.6,7
For external causes, when the cause of OHCA is suffocation due
to rice cake-related choking, a “mochi” flag is to be set on the
input item. These diagnoses were defined clinically by the
physicians in a hospital and=or EMS personnel at the scene. All
input data forms were transferred and integrated into the
registration system at the Information Center for Emergency
Medical Services of Osaka. The data were then checked by the
investigators, and when incomplete data are found, EMS
personnel in charge were asked to complete the data form. In
the present study, we obtained the following data items from the
registry: age, sex, location of cardiac arrest, ability to perform
activities of daily living (ADLs) before cardiac arrest, witness of
cardiac arrest, first documented cardiac rhythm, defibrillations
by
public-access
automated
external
defibrillators
(AEDs),
dispatcher instruction, type of bystander-initiated cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation (CPR), intravascular fluid, administration of
intravascular epinephrine, advanced airway management, EMS
response time (time from 119 call to EMS personnel’s contact
with the patient), prehospital and total return of spontaneous
circulation (ROSC) after an OHCA, hospital admission, 1-month
survival, and 1-month neurological outcome. The neurological
outcome was assessed by the physician in charge using the
cerebral performance category (CPC) scale: category 1, good
performance; category 2, moderate disability; category 3, severe
cerebral disability; category 4, coma=vegetative state; and
category 5, death=brain death.6,7
Study subjects
In the present study, OHCA data were obtained from January 1,
2005 to December 31, 2012. Patients aged ≥20 years who
suffered from an OHCA due to suffocation were included.
Patients who were not attempted resuscitations by EMS personnel
or bystanders and whose cardiac arrest was observed by EMS
personnel were excluded.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was 1-month survival after an
OHCA. The secondary outcome measures were prehospital
ROSC, total ROSC, hospital admission, and 1-month survival
with favorable neurological outcome. Favorable neurological
outcome at 1 month was defined as CPC 1 or 2.6,7
Statistical analysis
We counted the number of OHCAs due to suffocation on each
day and in each month of the study period. Patient characteristics,
prehospital care by EMS personnel, and outcomes of patients
were compared according to the cause of suffocation (ie, rice cake
consumption-related
and
non-rice-cake
consumption-related)
using an unpaired t-test for continuous variables and a chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. In addition,
we estimated the gender and age class-specific incidence rate
of OHCA due to suffocation in this population. A multivariate
logistic regression model was used to investigate potential factors
associated with 1-month survival after OHCA, and odds ratios
(ORs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated. The explanatory variables considered in this analysis
included cause of suffocation (rice cake consumption-related and
non-rice-cake consumption-related), age, sex (male or female),
location of cardiac arrest (home, nursing home, or other), ADL
before cardiac arrest (good or disability), witnessed by bystanders
(yes or no), first documented rhythm (ventricular fibrillation [VF]
or non-VF), defibrillations by public-access AEDs (yes or no),
dispatcher instruction (yes or no), type of bystander-initiated CPR
(no CPR, compression-only CPR, or conventional CPR with
rescue breathing), intravascular fluid (yes or no), administration
of intravascular epinephrine (yes or no), advanced airway
management (yes or no), EMS response time, and year. In this
multivariable analysis, both a fully adjusted model and a model in
which explanatory variables were selected by a stepwise forward
selection method were considered. All tests were two-tailed, and
a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical package
ver. 20.0J (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).
Ethics

individual informed consent for the review of patient outcomes
was waived by the Personal Information Protection Law and the
national research ethics guidelines of Japan.
RESULTS
Occurrence of OHCAs due to suffocation
Figure 1 shows the flow of OHCA due to suffocation in adult
patients in Osaka Prefecture during the 8-year study period. In
total, 46,911 adult OHCAs were observed during the study
period, and 7.0% of these (3,294=46,911) were due to suffocation.
Among these patients, the cause of suffocation was rice-cake
choking in 9.5% (314=3,294) while 90.5% (2,980=3,294) were
due to causes other than rice cake-related choking. Figure 2
shows the distribution of the number of OHCAs due to
suffocation in adult patients during the study period. Generally,
OHCAs due to suffocation were most likely to occur during the
winter (Figure 2A). This tendency is particularly evident among
OHCAs caused by rice-cake choking, as 16.2% (52=314)
occurred in December, 43.6% (137=314) in January, and 9.2%
(29=314) in February. In terms of the daily distribution, cases of
OHCA caused by rice-cake choking were concentrated in the first
3 days of the New Year, as 24.5% (77=314) of all OHCAs caused
by rice-cake choking occurred during those days (Figure 2B).
Table 1 shows the incidence rate of OHCA due to suffocation in
Osaka Prefecture during the study period. The overall incidence
rate of OHCA due to suffocation was 45.79 per 100,000
population per year, and that of suffocation caused by rice cake
was 4.36.
Patient characteristics and prehospital care by EMS
personnel
Table 2 shows the patient and EMS characteristics of OHCAs
due to suffocation. In total, the majority of patients (80.6% of
OHCAs caused by rice-cake choking and 78.5% of those not
caused by rice-cake choking) were elderly people aged ≥70
years. OHCAs caused by rice-cake choking were more common
in male patients (67.8%), and mostly occurred at home (87.9%).
Overall, approximately 70% of OHCAs were witnessed by
bystanders, but VF as the initial cardiac rhythm (1.9%) and

proportion of bystander initiated-CPR was significantly lower
among OHCAs caused by rice-cake choking (29.9% [n = 94]

 patients with 1-month survival after an OHCA were 17.2% (54=

among those not caused by rice cake. Table 4 shows the factors
related to 1-month survival after OHCA due to all causes of
suffocation. In the fully adjusted multivariable analysis, younger
age (adjusted OR for 1-year increment, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99),
arrest witnessed by bystanders (adjusted OR 5.26; 95% CI,
3.85–7.14), intravenous fluid administration (adjusted OR 1.76;
95% CI, 1.26–2.46), and earlier EMS response time (adjusted
OR for 1-minute increment, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84–0.92) were

DISCUSSION
Using the prospective population-based registry of OHCAs in
Osaka Prefecture, we described the epidemiology of OHCAs due
to suffocation, with a specific focus on suffocation caused by
Japanese rice-cake consumption. Approximately 10% of OHCAs
due to suffocation were caused by rice-cake choking, and one-
fourth of them occurred during the first 3 days of the New Year.
In addition, the majority of the patients were elderly people.
Although suffocation is the most common cause of non-cardiac
OHCA2 and rice cake is a food with a well-known high-risk of
choking for elderly people in Japan, the patient characteristics,
prehospital interventions, and outcomes after an OHCA due to
suffocation in prehospital setting have been poorly understood.
Therefore, our findings should provide valuable clues for the
development of countermeasures to prevent the occurrence of
unexpected death due to suffocation in the upcoming super-aging
era.
Our results showed that OHCAs due to suffocation mainly
occurred in the winter, and those caused by rice-cake choking
were strikingly concentrated in the first 3 days of the New Year.
One research paper reported that the incidence of OHCA of non-
cardiac origin was increased and significantly clustered around
New Year’s Day in Japan but did not address the cause of this
unexpected increase.10 Our findings indicated that one factor
contributing to this increase in the incidence of OHCA was the
rice-cake choking accidents that occurred on those days. Japanese
rice cake is an important feature of the New Year’s holidays for
Japanese people. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Communications, the mean yearly volume of rice cake
purchased by households was 2,437 g (799 g per person) in
2013,11 most of which is eaten during the first week of the New
Year. Since rice cake is easy to choke on, especially for elderly
people with preexisting difficulty in mastication=swallowing,
Japanese authorities warn people about the risk of choking every
year. For example, the Tokyo Fire Department advises people to
cut the rice cakes into small pieces, chew them slowly, and learn
how to perform basic first aid.5 Nevertheless, many victims go to
the hospital every year because of suffocation due to rice cake;
this has also been reported outside Japan.12,13
The outcomes after an OHCA among our target population
were relatively better than those after OHCA of other non-cardiac
causes, which were reported in a previous study.2 This may be
because ischemic damage to the heart is less severe in cardiac
arrest due to suffocation than that in OHCA of other origins,
as shown in an animal study.14 In addition, considering that it
generally takes several minutes for a cardiac arrest to develop
after respiratory arrest by choking, the time-interval from cardiac
arrest to EMS arrival might have been relatively shorter than for
OHCAs of other origin.
On the other hand, the results of our multivariable analysis
showed that bystander-initiated CPR was not associated with
1-month survival, whereas the variables of having the arrest
witnessed by bystanders and an earlier EMS response time were

 both significantly related to better survival. As has also been
shown in a previous study,2,15 the impact of bystander-initiated
CPR on survival after non-cardiac OHCA is considered to be
small, although early CPR is a key component of the chain of
survival. Thus, this finding also emphasizes the importance of
efforts to prevent the occurrence of suffocation in the high-risk
elderly population and among those with dysphagia, including
swallowing therapy, dietary modification, and oral care.16,17 In
addition, further efforts to inform the public of the risk of cardiac
arrest due to suffocation could lead to earlier recognition of
choking by bystanders and to people calling 119 earlier.
A previous study suggested that prehospital Magill forceps use
by EMS personnel improves outcomes of OHCA patients with
airway obstruction due to a foreign body,18 but this procedure
generally requires temporary suspension of CPR. Therefore,
removal of foreign body by bystanders before EMS arrival should
play an important role in improving outcomes after OHCA due to
suffocation. Several studies have suggested that bystanders tend
to attempt to clear the airway rather than perform standard
CPR.19,20 Considering the low proportion of administration of
bystander CPR in OHCAs caused by rice cake choking
(approximately 30%) in this study, many bystanders might have
tried to remove food material from the victim’s mouth without
performing CPR. Therefore, proper basic life support-related
education for caregivers of elderly people with dysphagia,
including abdominal thrust, back blow, and chest thrust methods,
is needed,21 so that they can expeditiously remove foreign bodies
and start CPR before EMS arrival.
The multivariable analysis for all-cause suffocation also
suggested that intravenous fluid administration was related to

 better 1-month survival. According to previous studies,22,23 the
effect of intravenous fluid administration for OHCA patients in
the prehospital setting is still under debate. One study reported
that intravenous fluid administration for OHCAs, of both cardiac
and non-cardiac origins, was not effective with regard to
improved
outcome,22
whereas
another
study reported
that
intravenous access was associated with a reduction in hospital
mortality in non-injured, non-cardiac-origin arrest patients.23
Therefore, further research should confirm the effectiveness of
advanced life support by EMS personnel, including intravenous
fluid administration.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, this study focused on
OHCA due to suffocation caused by rice cake, and the etiologies
of suffocation due to causes other than rice cake choking were
unclear, which makes it difficult to interpret the results of cases
of OHCA due to non-rice-cake-related choking. These cases
may include suffocation due to inhalation of gastric contents,
inhalation and ingestion of other objects causing obstruction of
the respiratory tract, other specified=unspecified threats to
breathing, as well as other food-choking accidents,3 but we did
not obtain information on them. Therefore, for example, we were
not able to address the reason of the observed increase in the
number of OHCAs due to suffocation not caused by rice cake
in the winter season. Second, we did not obtain information on
several background factors that could affect the occurrence and
outcomes of OHCAs (such as past medical history, medication,
life habits, and socio-economic status) and did not address
potential variability in post-arrest care (such as hemodynamic
support,
induced
hypothermia,
and
coronary
interventional
therapies).24 For example, several studies reported that the
majority of victims who died from food choking had underlying
conditions that adversely affected mastication=swallowing, such
as dementia.20,25 In addition, information on whether or not
bystanders attempted to remove foreign bodies was also not
available. Therefore, although our multivariable analyses did not
show a significant difference in the outcome between OHCAs
caused by rice-cake choking and those not caused by rice cake,
the point estimate may have been further attenuated toward the
null if we were able to control residual confounding factors more
completely. Third, our study area was limited to one prefecture;
hence, the results may not be generalizable to other areas.
Considering that the marketing strategies, consumption, cooking
methods of rice cake, and other environmental circumstances may
vary according to regional customs, the pattern and incidence
of suffocation could differ by prefecture. Therefore, further
investigations using data from other prefectures are needed to
confirm our findings. Fourth, data uncertainty, validity, integrity,
and ascertainment bias were also possible sources of bias in this
study. However, the large sample size, covering all OHCAs
in Osaka Prefecture, and the adoption of the standardized data
format based on the Utstein-style reporting guidelines6,7 would
have minimized such potential bias.
Conclusion
Approximately 3,300 OHCAs due to suffocation occurred in
Osaka Prefecture during the 8-year study period, and 10% of
these were caused by Japanese rice cake, or “mochi.” One-fourth
of cases of OHCAs caused by rice-cake choking occurred during
the first 3 days of the New Year. More efforts for establishing
preventive measures, as well as giving proper basic life support
education, improving the early recognition of choking, and
encouraging bystanders to call EMS sooner, are needed.
