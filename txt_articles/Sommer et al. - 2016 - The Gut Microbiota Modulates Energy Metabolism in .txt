In Brief
Sommer et al. show that the microbiota
and serum metabolites in brown bears
differ seasonally between hibernation and
active phase. Colonization of mice with a
bear microbiota promoted increased
adiposity. These findings suggest that
seasonal microbiota variation may
contribute to metabolism of the
hibernating brown bear.

SUMMARY
Hibernation is an adaptation that helps many animals
to conserve energy during food shortage in winter.
Brown bears double their fat depots during summer
and use these stored lipids during hibernation.
Although bears seasonally become obese, they
remain metabolically healthy. We analyzed the mi-
crobiota of free-ranging brown bears during their
active phase and hibernation. Compared to the
active phase, hibernation microbiota had reduced di-
versity, reduced levels of Firmicutes and Actinobac-
teria, and increased levels of Bacteroidetes. Several
metabolites involved in lipid metabolism, including
triglycerides, cholesterol, and bile acids, were also
affected by hibernation. Transplantation of the bear
microbiota from summer and winter to germ-free
mice transferred some of the seasonal metabolic fea-
tures and demonstrated that the summer microbiota
promoted adiposity without impairing glucose toler-
ance, suggesting that seasonal variation in the mi-
crobiota may contribute to host energy metabolism
in the hibernating brown bear.
INTRODUCTION
Free-ranging brown bears (Ursus arctos) undergo cycles of
intense eating and weight gain during the summer followed by
prolonged dormant hypometabolic fasting for up to 6 months
during the winter (Evans et al., 2012; Tøien et al., 2011). Despite
the large fat accumulation before hibernation, bears remain
metabolically healthy (Arinell et al., 2012; Nelson, 1973; Stenvin-
kel et al., 2013), which contrasts with the strong association be-
tween obesity and insulin resistance in humans. Thus, the brown
bear may constitute a model for healthy obesity and studying
hibernation might be a promising approach to develop novel
therapies for obesity. The intestines of mammals harbor diverse
microbial ecosystems that have profound effects on host phys-
iology (Sommer and Ba
¨ ckhed, 2013). The gut microbiota con-
tributes to energy harvest from the diet (Ba
¨ ckhed et al., 2004,
2007; Sommer and Ba
¨ ckhed, 2013; Sommer et al., 2015) and
is altered in obesity and type 2 diabetes (Khan et al., 2014).
Furthermore, diet, which is seasonably variable in bears (Pers-
son et al., 2001; Stenvinkel et al., 2013; Stofik et al., 2013),
strongly affects the gut microbiota (Ley et al., 2008; Zoetendal
and de Vos, 2014) and both fasting and hibernation alter the
gut microbiota composition (Carey et al., 2013; Crawford et al.,
2009; Dill-McFarland et al., 2014; Sonoyama et al., 2009).
Here, we investigated how hibernation in free-ranging brown
bears affects the gut microbiota and plasma metabolites, and
whetheraseasonallyalteredmicrobiotacontributesto thehealthy
obesity phenotype during summer. We used 16S rRNA profiling
and next-generation sequencing to comprehensively analyze
the fecal microbiota of free-ranging brown bears captured during
hibernation (February) and during the active period (June) of the
same year (Figure 1A). We showed that the winter microbiota
comprised fewer bacterial taxa (Figure S1A) and was more ho-
mogenous than the summer microbiota (Figure S1B), which
may reflect the varied diet among bears during the summer.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Principal coordinate analysis of the overall composition of the
bear fecal microbiota samples using unweighted UniFrac re-
vealed a clear separation depending on the seasonal origin (Fig-
ures 1B and S2). We identified 24 bacterial phyla in the bear fecal
microbiota (Table S1). The dominating bacterial phyla in the
summer microbiota were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actino-
bacteria (Figure 1C). In the winter microbiota, Bacteroidetes
increased in abundance, whereas Firmicutes and Actinobacteria
were less abundant (Figure 1D). A number of low abundant phyla
were only present in the summer microbiota (Figure S3A). At the
species level, 199 of the 4,447 detected operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) were significantly altered (q < 0.05; q = FDR

 corrected p value) between winter and summer (Table S1). The
most significant among these were OTU 4343627 (Bacteroides
fragilis), which was enriched in the winter, and OTUs 109107 (Hel-
icobacter spec.), 237444 (Streptococcus spec.), and 836919
(Wolbachia spec.), which were reduced in winter (Figure 1E). Wol-
bachia are symbionts of several insects (Hedges et al., 2008;
Teixeira et al., 2008), and the increased abundance during sum-
mer presumably results from the intake of insects as part of the
bear summer diet (Große et al., 2003). Furthermore, the winter mi-
crobiota had higher levels of several Enterobacteriaceae and
lower levels of several Rhizobiales and Actinomycetales species
(Figures S3B–S3D).

An enrichment of Bacteroidetes and
lower relative abundance of Firmicutes
has previously been observed in the mi-
crobiota of hibernating animals (Carey
et al., 2013; Dill-McFarland et al., 2014;
Sonoyama et al., 2009; Stevenson et al.,
2014).
The
increase
in
Bacteroidetes
may be explained by their capacity to
switch their metabolism toward degra-
dation of host glycans in the absence
of dietary polysaccharides (Sonnenburg
et al., 2005) or their capacity to metabolize
protein and fat (Wu et al., 2011) putatively
provided by the intestinal epithelium. In
contrast, most Firmicutes taxa require di-
etary fiber. These changes in the micro-
biota phyla were accompanied by a loss
of weight and body fat in the hibernating
bear. Similar trends have been reported
in studies comparing obese and lean sub-
jects (Ley et al., 2005) or using calorie re-
striction in humans and mice (Crawford
et al., 2009; Furet et al., 2010; Ley et al.,
2006; Turnbaugh et al., 2009). Further-
more, two studies of calorie-restricted
mice reported an increase in Bacteroides
fragilis (Santacruz et al., 2009) but reduced
Streptococcaceae and TM7 (Zhang et al.,
2013). Bacteroides fragilis was the pre-
dominant bacterium in the microbiota
from the hibernating bears, whereas both
Streptococcus and TM7 were reduced during hibernation.
Together these data indicate that many of the changes in the
bear microbiota are associated with caloric restriction. In contrast
to small hibernators, Verrucomicrobia including Akkermansia
muciniphila were not increased during hibernation in free-ranging
brown bears.
To identify metabolites that varied according to the activity
status of the bears, we used targeted metabolomics to analyze
blood samples taken from the jugular vein during winter and
summer. Supporting previous publications (LeBlanc et al.,
2001; Otis et al., 2011), we found that serum levels of cholesteryl
esters, triglycerides, and free cholesterol were significantly
1656
Cell Reports 14, 1655–1661, February 23, 2016 ª2016 The Authors
 higher in winter (Figures 2A–2C; Table S2). This finding is consis-
tent with the fact that energy from fat stores is obtained by lipol-
ysis during hibernation (Arinell et al., 2012; Nelson, 1973). Even
chain acylcarnitines, which largely represent intermediates of
mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), were also higher in
winter (Figure 2D), in agreement with high FAO activity during hi-
bernation. In contrast, C3 and C5 acylcarnitines, markers of
amino acid oxidation, were decreased during hibernation (Table
S2). Finally lactate (Figure 2E) and the levels of several gluconeo-
genic amino acids (e.g., alanine, methionine, tyrosine) were
reduced (Table S2) during winter compared to summer, whereas
succinate was increased, which could indicate reduced glucose
utilization and increased gluconeogenesis. Taken together,
these data suggest that during hibernation bears mobilize and
oxidize lipids as survival strategy, accompanied by reduced
glucose utilization and increased utilization of amino acids
for gluconeogenesis. The decreased lactate levels were also
consistent with decreased abundance of lactate-producing bac-
teria during hibernation; e.g., the Firmicutes Bacillus or Lactoba-
cillus and the Actinobacteria Micrococcus (Reddy et al., 2008).
Similarly, the increased succinate levels during hibernation
correlate with increased abundance of succinate-producing
bacteria such as Enterococcus (Song and Lee, 2005) in the
winter microbiota. However, the host can also produce lactate
and succinate, and thus seasonal changes in host metabolism
might also contribute to the differences in lactate and succinate.
We also observed that total bile acid levels in the serum were
lower in the winter with large reductions in primary and conjugated
bile acids (Figure 2G; Table S2). Notably, expression of the rate-
limiting enzyme of bile acid production CYP7A1 is reduced in the
liver of hibernating mammals (Fedorov et al., 2011; Otis et al.,
2011),andthemicrobiotacontributestomodificationsofbileacids
(Sayin et al., 2013). Bile acids promote lipid uptake and respond to
foodintake.Bearsdonoteatforupto6 monthsduringhibernation,
which likely explains the reduced bile acid levels in the winter.
Levels of deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, both of which
are dependent onthe microbiota,areknown to have hemolytic ac-
tivity (Oelberg et al., 1984; Scho
¨ lmerich et al., 1984) and were
reduced during hibernation (Table S2). Notably, several blood pa-
rameters that are linked to hemolysis and dehydration were also
altered during hibernation (Table 1). For example, levels of red
blood cells and hemoglobin were higher in the winter, whereas
lactate dehydrogenase (marker of hemolysis) and bilirubin (used
during recycling of hemoglobin) levels decreased during hiberna-
tion. Thus, microbiota-dependent changes in the bile acid profile
might contribute to the reduced hemolysis during hibernation.
To test whether the seasonal differences in the bear microbiota
affect host physiology, we colonized germ-free mice with a

 summer or winter bear microbiota (Figure 3A). 16S rRNA profiling
of the colonized mice confirmed successful colonization (Figures
3B and S4). There was no seasonal difference in alpha diversity,
possibly because all mice received the same food. Mice colonized
with a summer bear microbiota trended toward a greater weight
(p = 0.09) and showed a greater fat gain than mice colonized
with a winter bear microbiota (Figures 3C and 3D) but did not
display a significant difference in epididymal white adipose tissue
weight (Figure 3E). In humans, adiposity is associated with
reduced insulin sensitivity (Shulman, 2014). In contrast, brown
bears seem to become only temporarily insulin resistant with
mild hyperglycemia during hibernation but remain insulin sensitive
during the rest of the seasonal cycle independent of fat accumula-
tion (L. Nelson, personal communication; Stenvinkel et al., 2013).
The increased weight and adiposity of the mice colonized with a
summer bear microbiota were not due to higher bacterial abun-
dance as tested by 16S rDNA qPCR (summer 2.27 ± 1.16 3 1011
and winter 2.55 ± 1.03 3 1011 16S rDNA copies/g cecal content,
p = 0.6). Despite their increased fat mass, mice colonized with
summer bear microbiota showed no differences or even a slight
improvement in glucose metabolism compared to mice colonized
with a winter microbiota (Figure 3F). By performing targeted me-
tabolomics, we showed that the seasonal metabolic phenotype
of the bears could be partially transferred to germ-free mice by
colonization with a bear microbiota. For example, mice colonized
with a winter bear microbiota trended toward slightly higher serum
levels of cholesteryl esters (Table S2) and triglycerides (Figure 3G)
compared with mice that were colonized with summer microbiota.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our data show that the seasonal lifestyle of the
brown bear with phases of severe hyperphagia and fat accumu-
lation in the summer and prolonged fasting and inactivity during
hibernation is accompanied by seasonal changes in metabolism
and microbiota. Furthermore, colonization with the seasonal bear
microbiota was sufficient to transfer some of the seasonal meta-
bolic features to germ-free mice. Together this might indicate that
the seasonal differences in the bear microbiota contribute to the
seasonal metabolic changes, presumably due to the different
physiologic demands of phases of severe hyperphagia and hiber-
nation with prolonged fasting. Thus, the microbiota may be linked
to the healthy obesity phenotype in brown bears and as such not
only yields insights into the physiology of hibernating mammals,
but also further supports targeting the microbiota as potential
treatment of obesity. However, studying free-ranging animals
also limits our information regarding, e.g., seasonal food intake
and the experimental procedures that can be performed.
Although informative, our findings from the colonization of
germ-free mice cannot adequately reflect the physiologic state
in a hibernating bear. Thus, further mechanistic studies using,
e.g., bears in captivity in which calorie content, food consump-
tion, microbiota composition, and the animal’s physiology can
be controlled, are required to functionally validate and elucidate
which components of the microbiota contribute to the seasonal
metabolic differences and the involved molecular pathways.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Blood and fecal samples were taken from 16 free-ranging Eurasian brown
bears (Ursus arctos) during hibernation (February or March) and during the
active period (June) of the same year.
Germ-free mice were colonized with a winter or summer bear fecal microbiota
by oral gavage. Body composition was analyzed before and 14 days after colo-
nization by MRI (EchoMRI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Intra-
peritoneal glucose tolerance test was performed on day 15 post-colonization.
