Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a critical role in regulating myeloid
cell host defense. In this study, we demonstrated that GM-CSF signaling plays an essential role in antifungal defense against Asper-
gillus fumigatus. Mice that lack the GM-CSF receptor β chain (GM-CSFRβ) developed invasive hyphal growth and exhibited im-
paired survival after pulmonary challenge with A. fumigatus conidia. GM-CSFRβ signaling regulated the recruitment of
inflammatory monocytes to infected lungs, but not the recruitment of effector neutrophils. Cell-intrinsic GM-CSFRβ signaling
mediated neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte antifungal activity, because lung GM-CSFRβ−/− leukocytes exhibited impaired
conidial killing compared with GM-CSFRβ+/+ counterparts in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice. GM-CSFRβ−/− neutrophils
exhibited reduced (hydrogenated) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity in vivo. Conversely,
administration of recombinant GM-CSF enhanced neutrophil NADPH oxidase function, conidiacidal activity, and lung fungal clear-
ance in A. fumigatus–challenged mice. Thus, our study illustrates the functional role of GM-CSFRβ signaling on lung myeloid cell
responses against inhaled A. fumigatus conidia and demonstrates a benefit for systemic GM-CSF administration.

Aspergillus fumigatus is a pathogenic mold that forms ubiqui-
tous airborne conidia (vegetative spores) [1]. Invasive aspergil-
losis represents a common cause of infection-related death in
patients with leukemia and allogeneic hematopoietic cell trans-
plant recipients. In murine and human studies, quantitative and
qualitative defects in neutrophils and monocytes are associated
with conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae and rep-
resent major clinical risk factors for the development of invasive
aspergillosis [1–5]. Beyond patients with hematologic cancers,
humans with defects in granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling are susceptible to inva-
sive mold infections [6].
GM-CSF was first identified as a pleiotropic cytokine with pri-
mary functions in regulating myeloid cell survival, proliferation,
and differentiation [7, 8]. The GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR/
Csf2r) is a heterodimer composed of a specific ligand-binding
subunit (GM-CSFRα/Csf2ra) and a common signal-transduction
subunit (GM-CSFRβ/Csf2rb) [9]. GM-CSF–deficient (GM-
CSF−/−) mice are susceptible to a wide range of pathogens that
include Mycobacterium tuberculosis [10],Pseudomonas aerugino-
sa [11], Pneumocystis carinii [12], and Plasmodium chabaudi
[13]). Although GM-CSF enhances neutrophil phagocytic and
microbicidal properties [14, 15], the mechanisms by which
GM-CSF signaling promote defense against pathogenic yeasts
and molds remains incompletely defined. In a systemic Candida
albicans challenge model, natural kill (NK) cell–derived GM-CSF
enhances neutrophil antifungal activity [16]. For the intracellular
fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum, macrophage GM-CSF
signaling sequesters zinc ion from phagosomes to the Golgi ap-
paratus and increases macrophage reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production [17]. These findings provide a mechanistic explana-
tion for the observation that GM-CSF depletion is lethal for
H. capsulatum–infected mice, whereas GM-CSF administration
promotes fungal clearance [18].
GM-CSF is critical for alveolar macrophage differentiation
and mendelian defects in GM-CSF signaling, including muta-
tions in the GM-CSF receptor β chain [19],or anti-GM-CSF au-
toantibodies lead to dysregulated surfactant homeostasis and to
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [19, 20]. Not only are
patients with PAP susceptible to invasive aspergillosis [6],
but among patient with PAP who have opportunistic infections,
those with fungal infections have the lowest survival rates
[6]. Although GM-CSF has been used as a Food and Drug

 Administration–approved drug for PAP [21], little is known
about the mechanism by which defective GM-CSF signaling im-
pairs pulmonary innate immune responses against A. fumigatus.
In this study, we demonstrated that GM-CSFRβ signaling is
critical for survival and control of hyphal formation in A. fumi-
gatus–challenged mice. GM-CSFRβ signaling regulates conidial
uptake and killing by neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes
in a cell-intrinsic manner, in part by regulating the oxidative
burst in vivo. Our data further illustrate that GM-CSF supple-
mentation enhances antifungal activity of lung neutrophils and
inflammatory monocytes and accelerate fungal clearance in
otherwise immunocompetent mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
GM-CSFRβ−/− (stock No. 005940), p91phox−/− (stock No.
002365), C57BL/6 (CD45.2+), and C57BL/6.SJL (CD45.1+)
mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All mouse
strains were bred and housed in the Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center Research Animal Resource Center under specific
pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were con-
ducted with sex- and age-matched mice and performed with In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval.
Mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice were generated by
reconstituting lethally irradiated (900 cGy) recipient mice (F1
progeny from C57BL/6 and C57B/6.SJL cross; CD45.1+
CD45.2+) with 2–5 × 106 CD45.2+GM-CSFRβ−/− and CD45.1+
C57BL/6.SJL GM-CSFRβ+/+ BM cells and rested for 6–8 weeks
before experimental use.
Analysis of Infected Mice
Mice were inoculated with 3–8 × 107 Af293 or CEA10 conidia
via the intratracheal route as in [22, 23]. We used fluorescent
Aspergillus reporter (FLARE) conidia to measure conidial up-
take by and viability in leukocytes as described elsewhere [22,
23]. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung cell suspensions
were prepared as described elsewhere [24] and stained with
anti-Ly6C (clone AL-21), anti-Ly6G (1A8), anti-CD11b (M1/
70), anti-CD11c (HL3), anti-CD45.1 (A20), anti-CD45.2
(104), anti-Ly6B.2 (7/4), anti–major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) class II (M5/114.15.2) and with a viability dye
(eBioscience; catalog No. 65-0865-14) and plated for colony-
forming units (CFUs). Neutrophils were identified as CD45+
CD11b+Ly6CloLy6G+ Ly6B.2+, inflammatory monocytes as
CD45+CD11b+Ly6Chi Ly6G−CD11c−MHC-II−, and monocyte-
derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) as CD45+CD11c+ MHC-II+-
Ly6CloLy6G− cells. Flow cytometric data were collected on a
BD LSR II and analyzed with FlowJo software, version 9.8.2.
BAL lactate dehydrogenase levels were measured using the Cy-
toTox96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega; catalog
No. G1780). Lungs were homogenized in 2 mL of phosphate-buff-
ered saline (PBS) containing 0.025% Tween 20 for enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays. For histology, perfused lungs were fixed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at
4 μm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Gomori ammonia-
cal silver. Images were captured using a Zeiss Mirax Midi slide
scanner with a ×20x/0.8-numerical aperture objective and ana-
lyzed using Panoramic Viewer software (version 1.15.3).
For GM-CSF supplementation experiments, wild-type (WT)
mice were injected with 500 ng of recombinant mouse GM-CSF
(Gemini; catalog No. 300–308P) in PBS intraperitoneally at 24
hours before infection (day -1) and at the time of infection (day
0). The endotoxin level was <1 endotoxin units/μg, as measured
by limulus amebocyte lysate analysis.
Neutrophil ROS and FLARE Assays
BAL cells from infected mixed BM chimeric mice were cultured
with 5 μmol/L CM-H2DCFDA (General Oxidative Stress Indi-
cator; Life Technologies) at 5 μmol/L in Hank’s balanced salt
solution for 45 minutes at 37oC, stained with a viability dye
to exclude dead cells, and analyzed using flow cytometry. BM
neutrophils were enriched from WT or p91phox−/− mice using
density gradient centrifugation. Neutrophils were cocultured
with AF293 FLARE conidia at a 1:1 ratio for 16 hours at 37°C
and analyzed with flow cytometry.
Statistical Analysis
All results are expressed as mean (standard error of the mean
[SEM]) values derived from 3 independent experiments, unless
stated otherwise. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for un-
paired 2-group comparisons, and the Wilcoxon signed rank
test for paired 2-group comparisons. Nonparametric 2-way
analysis of variance was used for multiple-group comparison.
Survival data were analyzed using log-rank test unless stated
otherwise. All statistical analyses were performed with Graph-
Pad Prism software (version 6.0c).
RESULTS
GM-CSF Receptor Signaling and Murine Survival After A. fumigatus
Challenge
To define the role of GM-CSFR receptor β chain (GM-CSFRβ)
signaling during respiratory fungal challenge, GM-CSFRβ−/−
and C57BL/6 control mice were challenged with 8 × 107 A. fumi-
gatus CEA10 conidia and monitored for survival. Fifty percent of
GM-CSFRβ−/− mice died by day +5, and the survival rates for
GM-CSFRβ−/− and WT mice on day 32 were 37.5% and
93.7%, respectively (Figure 1A). The increased mortality rate cor-
related with a higher lung fungal burden at 24 and 72 hours after
infection in GM-CSFRβ−/− mice, as measured by CFUs (inocu-
lum, 3 × 107 conidia; Figure 1B and 1C) and greater lung damage
at 48 hours after infection, as judged by BAL fluid lactate dehy-
drogenase release (inoculum, 8 × 107 conidia; Figure 1D).
Although C57BL/6 mice formed widespread inflammatory in-
filtrates in lung sections harvested 48 hours after infection, we did
not observe evidence of hyphal tissue invasion (Figure 1E–H). In

 contrast, GM-CSFRβ−/− mice developed invasive aspergillosis;
lung sections showed widespread hyphal tissue invasion and de-
struction of bronchoalveolar architecture (Figure 1I–L). GM-
CSFRβ−/− lungs contained extensive, multifocal lesions with
necrotic cells and masses of fungal hyphae (Figure 1I–L). In
sum, these results indicate that GM-CSFRβ chain signaling is
essential for effective fungal clearance and murine survival.
Because GM-CSFRβ can participate in interleukin 3 (IL-3)
and interleukin 5 (IL-5) signaling as well, we measured the in-
duction of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 during respiratory fungal
challenge (Figure 1M). We observed a 10-fold increase in
lung GM-CSF level and no significant change in IL-5, and we
did not detect IL-3 in the lung at any time point tested. The
kinetics of GM-CSF induction mirror those of the inflamma-
tory cytokines tumor necrosis factor, CXCL1, and CXCL2,
which have well-described roles in host defense (Figure 1N)
[25–27].
GM-CSFRβ Chain Signaling and Lung Leukocyte Recruitment
To dissect the mechanism by which GM-CSFRβ signaling me-
diates host protection against A. fumigatus, we monitored in-
nate immune cell recruitment during respiratory challenge.
Lung neutrophil numbers were similar in C57BL/6 and

 GM-CSFRβ−/− mice at both 24 and 48 hours after infection
(Figure 2A). However, early inflammatory monocyte recruitment
(24 hours after infection) was decreased in GM-CSFRβ−/− mice,
and this trend continued 48 hours after infection (Figure 2B). At
24 hours after infection, lung Mo-DC numbers were similar
between WT and GM-CSFRβ−/− mice, but at 48 hours after
infection, Mo-DCs in GM-CSFRβ−/− mice failed to expand
(Figure 2C). Given the developmental relationship between in-
flammatory monocytes and descendant Mo-DCs [24] during
respiratory A. fumigatus challenge, these data suggest that the
failure to observe Mo-DC expansion was related to a reduced
lung inflammatory monocyte influx. Furthermore, we ob-
served significant reductions in tumor necrosis factor, CXCL2,
and monocyte chemotactic protein-5 (60%, 37%, and 42%, re-
spectively) in the lungs of GM-CSFRβ−/− mice compared with
WT mice (Figure 2D–I). We did not observe reductions in
CXCL1, CCL2, or CCL8 lung levels in GM-CSFRβ−/− mice.
Thus, genetic deletion of GM-CSFR signaling had a variable
impact on the production of inflammatory and chemotactic
mediators in the lung.
Cell-Intrinsic Role of GM-CSFR-β Signaling in Conidial Uptake and
Killing
To determine whether leukocyte-intrinsic GM-CSFRβ signaling
regulates neutrophil antifungal responses, we generated mixed
BM chimeric mice by injecting CD45.2+GM-CSFRβ−/− and
CD45.1+ WT BM cells into lethally-irradiated CD45.1+CD45.2+
recipients (Figure 3A). The advantage of using mixed BM chime-
ric mice was that gene-deficient and gene-sufficient leukocytes
were compared functionally side by side within the same lung
inflammatory context in the absence of dysregulated lung sur-
factant homeostasis [28, 29].
Using FLARE conidia in mixed BM chimeric mice, we com-
pared neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte-mediated conidial
uptake and killing (Figure 3B–D). FLARE conidia encode a fungal
viability indicator (ie, DsRed or TdTomato) and contain a tracer
fluorophore (ie, Alexa Fluor 633) [22, 23]. FLARE conidia emit 2
fluorescence signals (DsRed/TdTomato and Alexa Fluor 633)
when the fungal cell is alive, and emit a single fluorescence signal
(Alexa Fluor 633 only) when the fungal cell is killed. This approach
allows us to distinguish fungus-engaged leukocytes from bystander
leukocytes and determine the frequency of fungus-engaged leuko-
cytes that contain either live or killed fungal cells in the lung.
In a representative example depicted in Figure 3B, lung neutro-
phils were analyzed on the basis of conidial uptake and viability
within the leukocyte 48 hours after infection. R1 and R2 gate rep-
resent neutrophils containing live and dead conidia, respectively.
The frequency of fungus-engaged neutrophils (conidial uptake
frequency, gate R1 + R2) was slightly reduced for the GM-
CSFRβ−/− cells compared with WT counterparts. More strikingly,
the frequency of fungus-engaged cells that contain live conidia
was increased among GM-CSFRβ−/− compared with WT neutro-
phils (neutrophil conidial viability, R1/[R1 + R2]), indicating a
defect in conidial killing. Normalized data pooled from 3
experiments showed that conidial uptake by lung and BAL fluid
GM-CSFRβ−/− neutrophils was decreased, on average, by 27.4%
(SEM, 6.4%) and 17.8% (7.1%), respectively, compared with
WT counterparts isolated from the same lung (Figure 3C; gate
R1 + R2). We did not observe a statistically significant change in
Figure 2.

 inflammatory monocyte conidial uptake in the lung among cells
of both genotypes (Figure 3C).
The frequency of neutrophils that contain live conidia was 2.6-
fold and 1.3-fold higher for lung and BAL fluid GM- CSFRβ−/−
neutrophils compared with WT counterparts (Figure 3D). Simi-
larly, the frequency of lung inflammatory monocytes that con-
tain live conidia was 3.3-fold higher for GM-CSFRβ−/− than
for WT cells (Figure 3D). The fungal killing defect in GM-
CSFRβ−/− neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes was not
due to impaired cellular viability, as measured by annexin V
and viability dye staining (see Supplementary Figure 1). Thus,
these data indicate that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes
require cell-intrinsic GM-CSFRβ signaling to achieve full coni-
diacidal activity.
GM-CSFRβ Signaling and Neutrophil ROS Production During
Respiratory Fungal Challenge
To examine conidiacidal effector mechanisms controlled by
GM-CSFRβ signaling, we measured in vivo neutrophil ROS
production in congenically marked GM-CSFRβ−/− and GM-
CSFRβ+/+ neutrophils in the lungs of mixed BM chimeric
mice using the experimental scheme described in Figure 3A.
We challenged mixed BM chimeric mice with Alexa Fluor 633–
labeled AF293 conidia to distinguish bystander and fungus-
engaged neutrophils.

 Pooled data from multiple experiments were normalized to a
neutrophil ROS median fluorescence intensity of 100 in lung
and BAL GM-CSFRβ+/+ bystander cells (Figure 4A and 4B,
black circles). The normalized ROS median fluorescence inten-
sity for GM-CSFRβ−/− bystander neutrophils was very similar
to that of WT counterparts (Figure 4A and 4B, white circles).
However, neutrophil ROS induction that was triggered by co-
nidial uptake was significantly attenuated in GM-CSFRβ−/−
neutrophils compared with WT neutrophils isolated from the
same lungs (Figure 4A) and airways (Figure 4B). These data
demonstrate that neutrophil-intrinsic GM-CSFRβ signaling
partially regulates ROS induction during respiratory A. fumiga-
tus challenge.
To determine whether GM-CSF regulates neutrophil (hydroge-
nated) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
oxidase–dependent antifungal activity, we cocultured FLARE co-
nidia and neutrophils isolated from WT or NADPH oxidase–
deficient mice (p91phox−/−), with or without exogenous GM-
CSF. On average, the addition of GM-CSF increased the fre-
quency of WT neutrophils that contain dead conidia from
13.8% to 18.7%, whereas GM-CSF had no effect on fungal
killing by p91phox−/− neutrophils in vitro (Figure 4C and
4D). These data indicate that GM-CSF can enhance neutro-
phil NADPH oxidase–dependent conidial killing in vitro.
GM-CSF Administration and Neutrophil and Inflammatory Monocyte
Antifungal Activity
To determine whether exogenous GM-CSF enhanced antifun-
gal responses by innate immune cells in vivo, we injected
GM-CSF (dose, 500 ng) or PBS into mice via the intraperitoneal
route and challenged the animals with 2 strains of FLARE co-
nidia via the intratracheal route (Figure 5A). We used 2 strains
of FLARE conidia to ensure that the effects of GM-CSF were
general and not limited to a single clinical isolate.

 GM-CSF administration enhanced neutrophil-mediated
conidial killing, as judged by the reduced frequency of fungus-
engaged neutrophils that contain live conidia among fungus-
engaged neutrophils (see Figure 5B for representative example),
irrespective of the fungal strain used. For data presented in Fig-
ure 5B and in the dot plots in Figure 5C, neutrophil conidial vi-
ability was normalized to results obtained with PBS-treated mice.
On average, GM-CSF injection reduced the frequency of neu-
trophils and inflammatory monocytes that contain live CEA10
conidia by 28.6% (SEM, 3.8%) and 40.6% (6.0%), respectively, and
that contain Af293 conidia, by 23.3% (6.0%) and 16.9% (5.8%),
respectively (Figure 5C). These data indicate that GM-CSF
enhances conidial killing by neutrophils and inflammatory mono-
cytes. We observed a marginal reduction in the frequency of
fungus-engaged neutrophils by 21.3% (SEM, 2.9%) and 10.7%
(5.1%) for CEA10 and AF293 FLARE conidia in GM-CSF–treated
mice, respectively, but we observed no significant difference in
inflammatory monocyte-mediated conidial uptake (Figure 5C).

 To determine whether the enhanced conidial killing observed
in GM-CSF–treated mice influenced fungal clearance, lung
CFUs were measured in both groups and found to 53% lower
in GM-CSF–treated mice than in PBS-treated control mice
(Figure 5D). Thus, enhanced neutrophil and inflammatory
monocyte conidial killing in GM-CSF–treated mice is associat-
ed with more rapid conidial clearance in the lung. To determine
whether the accelerated fungal clearance seen in GM-CSF–
treated C57BL/6 mice depends on NADPH oxidase (Figure 5D),
we conducted a similar set of experiments in p91phox−/− mice.
In this setting, we did not observe a significant difference in
CFUs between GM-CSF– and PBS-treated groups (Figure 5E),
consistent with the idea that the protective effect of GM-CSF
depends, at least in significant part, on intact NADPH oxidase
activity in the lung.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated a cell-intrinsic role of GM-
CSFRβ signaling in neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte ac-
tivity against A. fumigatus conidia. Mice genetically deficient in
GM-CSFRβ signaling were susceptible to respiratory A. fumiga-
tus challenge and hyphal tissue invasion. The development of
invasive aspergillosis in GM-CSFRβ−/− mice correlated with
impaired inflammatory monocyte trafficking and a defect in
neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte conidiacidal activity,
in part via a reduced oxidative burst. The conidiacidal defect
in GM-CSFRβ−/− neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes
was observed in mixed chimeric hosts, consistent with a cell-
intrinsic defect that is not dependent on host tissue context, ex-
emplified by excess surfactant production in globally-deficient
GM-CSFRβ−/− hosts. Furthermore, administration of exo-
genous GM-CSF enhanced neutrophil and inflammatory
monocyte antifungal activity in otherwise immunocompetent
mice and accelerated lung fungal clearance. In this study, we
focused on the antifungal activity of neutrophils and inflamma-
tory monocytes, because fungal clearance depends on these 2
cell subsets in otherwise immunocompetent mice [3, 4].
Recombinant GM-CSF (ie, sargramostin, molgramostin) is a
Food and Drug Administration–approved drug and has been
used to shorten neutropenia in patients that are undergoing
myeloablative chemotherapy [30] and to treat patients with
PAP [31]. Recent preclinical studies support a role for GM-
CSF in patients with severe combined neutropenia due to men-
delian defects in Jagunal homolog 1 [32]and in individuals with
central nervous system candidiasis due to mendelian defects in
CARD9 [33]. A small series of case reports describe the impact
of GM-CSF on disseminated aspergillosis in patients with a
monocyte defect in antifungal activity and with advanced
AIDS [34,35].In cyclophosphamide- and corticosteroid-treated
mice challenged with A. fumigatus via the respiratory route, in-
tranasal recombinant GM-CSF was associated with a reduced
lung fungal burden [36], though the underlying mechanism
of protection was not examined. In vitro studies supported
the notion that GM-CSF reverses suppressive effects of cortico-
steroids by augmenting NF-κB activation, inflammatory cyto-
kine production, and oxidative function in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and macrophages challenged with A. fumiga-
tus [37, 38], but how these observations related to lung fungal
clearance remained unclear.
Our present findings indicate that GM-CSF signaling cali-
brates the fungicidal activity of effector neutrophils and inflam-
matory monocytes in the lung in a cell-intrinsic manner, in part
by regulating the oxidative burst. Our data do not formally rule
out the possibility that IL-3 or IL-5 may regulate GM-CSFRβ
chain–dependent signaling events, and future experiments
could address this possibility. However, neither IL-3 nor IL-5
were induced in the respiratory A. fumigatus challenge model.
Although the results of this study imply a direct link between
GM-CSF signaling, NADPH oxidase activity, and conidial kill-
ing in vitro and in the lung, the studies were not designed to test
whether GM-CSF is the dominant regulator of NADPH oxidase
activity during respiratory fungal challenge. We believe that ad-
ditional, GM-CSF–independent, mechanisms regulate neutro-
phil and inflammatory monocyte NADPH oxidase activity
during respiratory fungal challenge [39]. Furthermore, our
data do not formally exclude the possibility that GM-CSF
may activate NADPH oxidase–independent mechanisms
in the lung, although we did not detect a benefit in adminis-
tering GM-CSF to p91phox−/− mice that were challenged with
A. fumigatus. A limitation of our study is that we did not distin-
guishwhetherGM-CSFsignalinginneutrophilsorinflammatory
monocytes is more critical for fungal clearance. Although it
is likely that both innate effector cells contribute to GM-
CSF–dependent fungal clearance, the recent development of
GM-CSFRβfl/fl mice coupled with neutrophil-restricted (ie,
Mrp8-Cre mice) and inflammatory monocyte–restricted (ie,
CCR2-Cre-ERT2 mice) conditional ablation strategies [40]
will allow this question to be addressed in future studies.
A recent study profiled lung neutrophils isolated from sterile
inflammatory lesions and described a gene signature that is
characterized by elevated CD54 and dectin-2 expression and
by interleukin 1β promoter activation after exposure to GM-
CSF. In vitro, recombinant GM-CSF induced these neutrophil
phenotypic changes most robustly compared with 65 other cy-
tokines tested [41]. Taylor and colleagues demonstrated similar
phenotypic changes in a subset of murine neutrophils isolated
from animals that received a subcutaneous injection of heat-
killed swollen A. fumigatus conidia. In this model, neutrophils
expressed the transcription factor RAR-related orphan receptor
gamma t and initiated an autocrine interleukin 17 signaling
pathway in a dectin-2–, interleukin 6–, and interleukin 23–
dependent manner [42]. These primed neutrophils displayed
augmented ROS production and antifungal activity after a sec-
ondary challenge with live conidia in a corneal model of fungal

 disease. Neutrophil priming in this model did not require T, B,
NK, NK T, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). It remains unclear
whether additional cytokines, including GM-CSF, participate in
or augment the priming process described in this model.
Various lung cell types can produce GM-CSF and GM-CSF
messenger RNA and/or protein have been detected in hemato-
poietic and nonhematopoietic cells that include myeloid, endo-
thelial, fibroblastic, bronchial, tracheal, and in type II alveolar
epithelial cells [43, 44]. In this study, we were not able to define
whether GM-CSFRβ signaling depends on GM-CSF from focal
or diffuse cellular sources. Although NK cells contribute to fun-
gal clearance and survival in a neutropenic model of invasive
aspergillosis via an interferon γ–dependent mechanism [45,
46], NK cells (and other interleukin 2 receptor γ chain–and re-
combinase-activating gene–dependent leukocytes) are dispen-
sable for conidial clearance in otherwise immunocompetent
mice [3]. In contrast, a dendritic cell–NK cell-neutrophil axis
was essential for fungal clearance, and NK cell–derived GM-
CSF played a major role in activating neutrophil antifungal
responses in a systemic candidiasis model [16]. In the gastroin-
testinal tract, macrophage interactions with commensal bacteria
regulate type 3 ILC–dependent GM-CSF production and the in-
duction of oral tolerance [47]. Thus, the induction signals and
cellular source(s) of GM-CSFR ligands in the lung during respi-
ratory fungal challenge remains to be defined, though they are
likely to involve different cellular networks than at other ana-
tomic sites.
There remains a critical knowledge gap in our understanding
of whether immunomodulatory agents, such as GM-CSF, can
improve clinical outcomes beyond those achieved with contem-
porary antifungal therapy [48]. A recent prospectively random-
ized controlled study suggested that prophylactic GM-CSF,
compared with G-CSF, reduced both long-term mortality
rates due to invasive fungal disease, primarily because of a re-
duction in candidiasis, and transplantation-related and cumula-
tive mortality rates [49]. The results in the current study suggest
that defective GM-CSF signaling heightens host risk for invasive
aspergillosis and that GM-CSF supplementation may be partic-
ularly effective in enhancing the fungicidal properties of lung
neutrophils and monocytes during acute infection as a thera-
peutic adjunct. Given the rising incidence of antifungal drug re-
sistance among clinical and environmental Aspergillus isolates
[50], further studies to optimize adjunctive treatment strategies
are timely and warranted.
