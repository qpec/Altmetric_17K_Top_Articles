Fourth Trial (RADIANT-4) Study Group*
Summary
Background Eff
 ective systemic therapies for patients with advanced, progressive neuroendocrine tumours of the lung 
or gastrointestinal tract are scarce. We aimed to assess the effi
  cacy and safety of everolimus compared with placebo in 
this patient population.
Methods In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 RADIANT-4 trial, adult patients (aged 
≥18 years) with advanced, progressive, well-diff
 erentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of lung or 
gastrointestinal origin were enrolled from 97 centres in 25 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were  randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio by an interactive voice response system to receive everolimus 10 mg per day orally or identical 
placebo, both with supportive care. Patients were stratifi
 ed by tumour origin, performance status, and previous 
somatostatin analogue treatment. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment 
assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by central radiology review, analysed by 
intention to treat. Overall survival was a key secondary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01524783.
Findings Between April 3, 2012, and Aug 23, 2013, a total of 302 patients were enrolled, of whom 205 were allocated to 
everolimus 10 mg per day and 97 to placebo. Median progression-free survival was 11·0 months (95% CI 9·2–13·3) in 
the everolimus group and 3·9 months (3·6–7·4) in the placebo group. Everolimus was associated with a 52% 
reduction in the estimated risk of progression or death (hazard ratio [HR] 0·48 [95% CI 0·35–0·67], p<0·00001). 
Although not statistically signifi
 cant, the results of the fi
 rst pre-planned interim overall survival analysis indicated 
that everolimus might be associated with a reduction in the risk of death (HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·40–1·05], one-sided 
p=0·037, whereas the boundary for statistical signifi
 cance was 0·0002). Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were 
infrequent and included stomatitis (in 18 [9%] of 202 patients in the everolimus group vs 0 of 98 in the placebo group), 
diarrhoea (15 [7%] vs 2 [2%]), infections (14 [7%] vs 0), anaemia (8 [4%] vs 1 [1%]), fatigue (7 [3%] vs 1 [1%]), and 
hyperglycaemia (7 [3%] vs 0).
Interpretation Treatment with everolimus was associated with signifi
 cant improvement in progression-free survival 
in patients with progressive lung or gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours. The safety fi
 ndings were consistent 
with the known side-eff
 ect profi
 le of everolimus. Everolimus is the fi
 rst targeted agent to show robust anti-tumour 
activity with acceptable tolerability across a broad range of neuroendocrine tumours, including those arising from the 
pancreas, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.

Introduction
Neuroendocrine tumours are a group of heterogeneous 
malignancies 
arising 
from 
neuroendocrine 
cells 
throughout the body.1 Data from population-based 
registries indicate that 51% of neuroendocrine tumours 
arise from the gastrointestinal tract, 27% from the lungs, 
and 6% from the pancreas.1 Clinically, neuroendocrine 
tumours are regarded as functional if they are associated 
with 
symptoms 
of 
hormonal 
hypersecretion, 
or 
non-functional if they are not associated with these 
symptoms. Although carcinoid syndrome is classically 
associated with metastatic, well-diff
 erentiated neuro-
endocrine tumours of the small intestine, an analysis of 
National Comprehensive Cancer Centre database showed 
that most (74%) neuroendocrine tumours are non-
functional.2 The prognosis of neuroendocrine tumours 
varies based on the primary site, the presence of metastatic 
disease, tumour grade, and stage at diagnosis.1,3
Advanced neuroendocrine tumours are incurable in 
nearly all cases. The somatostatin analogue octreotide,

approved for control of hormonal syndrome, has been 
shown to delay disease progression in patients with 
previously untreated midgut neuroendocrine tumours.4 
Recently, lanreotide was shown to delay tumour growth 
in patients with mostly stable, advanced, enteropancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours.5 Although targeted therapies 
such as everolimus and sunitinib are approved for 
advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, for which 
both drugs have been associated with improved 
progression-free survival,6–8 these agents are not approved 
for advanced lung or progressive gastrointestinal tract 
neuroendocrine tumours.
Everolimus 
(Afi
 nitor, 
Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation [East Hanover, NJ, USA]), a potent oral 
inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 
has previously been shown to be associated with 
antitumour 
activity 
in 
advanced 
non-pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours.9–11 The RADIANT-2 study12 
assessed everolimus versus placebo, both with 
octreotide longacting repeatable, in patients with 
neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome. In 
the RADIANT-2 study,12 treatment with everolimus 
plus octreotide longacting repeatable was associated 
with a 5·1-month improvement in median progression-
free survival for the everolimus group versus the 
placebo group. However, this diff
 erence did not achieve 
statistical 
signifi
 cance, 
possibly 
because 
of 
an 
imbalance in baseline characteristics between the 
treatment groups and informative censoring caused by 
discordance between local and central radiology 
review.12 The RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine 
Tumours, Fourth Trial (RADIANT-4) was undertaken 
to ascertain whether or not oral everolimus at a daily 
dose of 10 mg compared with placebo prolongs 
progression-free survival in patients with advanced, 
non-functional, progressive neuroendocrine tumours 
of lung or gastrointestinal origin.
Methods
Study design and participants
This international, multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done in 
97 centres in 25 countries worldwide (Austria, Belgium, 
Canada, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Germany, 
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Netherlands, 
Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovak Republic, South 
Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the 
UK, and the USA). Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with 
pathologically confi
 rmed, advanced (unresectable or 
metastatic), non-functional, well-diff
 erentiated (grade 1 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE for reports on clinical trials in advanced 
neuroendocrine tumours, with “mTOR” and “NET” as our primary 
search terms, limiting the fi
 ndings to include “non-functional”, 
“non-pancreatic”, or “non-syndromic” neuroendocrine tumours. 
We did not limit our search by date but we searched only for  
articles published in English. We identifi
 ed no studies of 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors as 
monotherapy in patients with advanced, progressive, 
well-diff
 erentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of 
lung or gastrointestinal origin. We found that the phase 3 
RADIANT-2 study assessed the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in 
combination with octreotide longacting repeatable versus 
placebo plus octreotide longacting repeatable in patients with 
advanced neuroendocrine tumours and a history of carcinoid 
symptoms (Pavel et al, 2011). Although the RADIANT-2 study did 
not meet its primary endpoint, the results provided an initial 
indication of the potential antitumour eff
 ect of everolimus in the 
patients with non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. 
Additionally, RAMSETE (RAD001 [everolimus] in Advanced and 
Metastatic Silent neuroEndocrine Tumours in Europe)—a single-
arm, multicentre, single-stage phase 2 trial—showed that 
everolimus might be eff
 ective in non-syndromic, non-pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours with diverse tumour origin sites 
(Pavel et al, 2012). We identifi
 ed no phase 3 studies with mTOR 
inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with advanced, 
progressive, well-diff
 erentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine 
tumours of lung or gastrointestinal origin.
Added value of this study
Advanced neuroendocrine tumours are incurable. Targeted 
treatments, such as everolimus and sunitinib, are approved for 
advanced, progressive, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. 
Eff
 ective antineoplastic therapy options for patients with 
advanced, progressive, non-functional neuroendocrine 
tumours of the lung or gastrointestinal tract are very scarce. 
To our knowledge, RADIANT-4 is the fi
 rst, large, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 study to assess the effi
  cacy and 
safety of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus as monotherapy in 
this patient population. Everolimus was associated with a 
clinically meaningful almost threefold prolongation of 
progression-free survival versus placebo, indicating a 
statistically signifi
 cant 52% risk reduction in favour of 
everolimus. The benefi
 t of treatment with everolimus was 
maintained across most of the prespecifi
 ed subgroups. The 
adverse event fi
 ndings were consistent with the known safety 
profi
 le of everolimus.
Implications of all the available evidence
Taken together with results from the previous RADIANT-3 
study in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (Yao et al, 2011), 
the fi
 ndings from RADIANT-4 study provide robust, 
practice-changing evidence to support the antitumour effi
  cacy 
of everolimus across a broad range of neuroendocrine tumours, 
including those arising from the pancreas, lung, or 
gastrointestinal tract.

3
or 2 according to the 2010 WHO classifi
 cation13,14) 
neuroendocrine tumours of lung or gastrointestinal 
origin were eligible for participation within 6 months 
from documented radiological disease progression. 
Additional key inclusion criteria included measurable 
disease according to modifi
 ed Response Evaluation 
Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1·0 (appendix 
pp 2–3 and amended protocol);15 a WHO performance 
status score of 0 or 1; and adequate bone marrow, liver, 
and kidney function. Patients previously treated with a 
somatostatin 
analogue, 
interferon, 
one 
line 
of 
chemotherapy, peptide receptor radionuclide therapies, 
or a combination of these were eligible to enrol if disease 
progression was documented during or after their last 
treatment. Antineoplastic therapy must have been 
discontinued for at least 4 weeks (or 6 months in the case 
of peptide receptor radionuclide therapies) before 
randomisation. Patients were ineligible if they had a 
history of or presented with carcinoid syndrome, poorly 
diff
 erentiated histology, or pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours. Patients who had previously received more 
than one line of chemotherapy; treatment with mTOR 
inhibitors (sirolimus, temsirolimus, or everolimus); 
hepatic intra-arterial embolisation within 6 months of 
randomisation; cryoablation or radio 
frequency ablation 
of hepatic metastases within 2 months of randomisation; 
or chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressive agents were excluded.
The study was done in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines, the ethical principles of the 
Declaration 
of 
Helsinki, 
and 
local 
regulations. 
Independent ethics committees or institutional review 
boards at each participating centre reviewed and 
approved the study and all amendments to the protocol. 
All patients provided written informed consent. An 
independent data monitoring committee provided 
ongoing oversight of safety and study conduct.
Randomisation and masking
Randomisation was done by interactive voice response 
systems 
(see 
amended 
protocol 
in 
appendix). 
Randomisation was stratifi
 ed by previous somatostatin 
analogue treatment (defi
 ned as continuous somatostatin 
analogue treatment for ≥12 weeks), tumour origin (based 
on prognostic level, grouped into two strata: stratum A 
[better prognosis]: appendix, caecum, jejunum, ileum, 
duodenum, or neuroendocrine tumour of unknown 
primary origin vs stratum B [worse prognosis]: lung, 
stomach, colon [other than caecum], or rectum), and 
WHO performance status (0 vs 1). Patients, investigators, 
and the study sponsor were masked to treatment 
assignment. The identity of experimental treatments was 
concealed by use of everolimus and placebo that were 
identical in packaging, labelling, appearance, and 
administration schedule. Premature unmasking (ie, 
before the primary analysis) was allowed only in the case 
of emergency.
 
Procedures
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio 
to receive oral everolimus at a dose of 10 mg per day or 
identical placebo, both with best supportive care. The 
best supportive care included treatment deemed 
necessary by the physician (eg, analgesics and anti-
diarrhoeals) 
except 
anti-tumour 
agents 
like 
somatostatin analogues, interferons, tumour ablative 
procedures, radiation, and concurrent chemotherapy. 
Radiation and surgery were allowed only for palliative 
intent. Concomitant somatostatin analogues during the 
study were allowed only for control of emergent 
carcinoid symptoms (eg, fl
 ushing or diarrhoea) that 
were not manageable by standard treatment such as 
loperamide.
All patients who underwent randomisation were 
assessed for effi
  cacy by cross-sectional imaging with 
multiphasic CT or MRI every 8 weeks during the fi
 rst 
12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter.
Dose reductions and treatment interruption for a 
maximum of 28 days were allowed for patients who did 
not tolerate therapy or to manage adverse events that were 
judged to be related to study treatment. Two dose 
reductions were allowed: from 10 mg to 5 mg per day and, 
subsequently, to 5 mg every other day. Treatment continued

until documented radiological disease progression, start of 
new cancer therapy (any therapy with intent of oncologic 
treatment of cancer, potentially chemotherapy, peptide 
receptor radionuclide therapy, or any other targeted 
therapy), development of an intolerable adverse event, or 
withdrawal of consent. Crossover from placebo to 
open-label everolimus after progression was not allowed 
and patients and investigators remained masked to 
treatment assignment until the primary analysis.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was central radiology-assessed 
progression-free survival, defi
 ned as the time from 
randomisation to death or progression as per modifi
 ed 
RECIST version 1.0 criteria.14 Central radiology review, 
masked to treatment assignment and local assessment, 
was done in real time (appendix p 3). Progression-free 
survival according to investigator assessment was a 
prespecifi
 ed supportive analysis. Overall survival was the 
main secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints 
were objective response rate, disease control rate 
(appendix p 4), health-related quality of life, WHO 
performance status, pharmacokinetics, changes in 
chromogranin A and neuron-specifi
 c enolase levels, and 
safety.
All randomly assigned patients were included in the 
full analysis set. The primary effi
  cacy analyses were 
assessed based on the data from this population on an 
intention-to-treat basis.
The safety population included all patients who 
received at least one dose of the study drug with at least 
one post-baseline safety assessment. Adverse events 
were assessed as per National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.03.
Statistical analysis
Based on historical data, we assumed that median 
progression-free survival in the control (placebo) group 
would be around 5 months.4 Sample size was estimated 
based on the ability to detect a clinically meaningful 
improvement in progression-free survival, defi
 ned as a 
41% reduction in the risk of disease progression or 
death (hazard ratio [HR] 0·59), corresponding to a 
prolongation in median progression-free survival from 
5 months with placebo to 8·5 months with everolimus. 
With 2:1 randomisation and a one-sided type 1 error rate 
of 2·5%, a total of 176 progression-free survival events 
are needed to provide 91·3% power. After adjustment 
for an estimated dropout rate of 15%, we calculated that 
roughly 285 patients were needed to be randomised in a 
2:1 ratio between the everolimus and placebo groups.
Overall survival analyses were to be done if the primary 
endpoint was statistically signifi
 cant using a group 
sequential design with two interim analyses and fi
 nal 
analysis at roughly 191 events (one-sided signifi
 cance level 
2·5%; appendix p 4). We used the Lan-DeMets method

the cumulative type I error rate.
We estimated progression-free and overall survival 
using the Kaplan-Meier method; we did comparisons 
between the treatment groups using a one-sided log-rank 
test, stratifi
 ed according to tumour origin, WHO 
performance status, and previous somatostatin analogue 
treatment. The hazard ratio was estimated by a stratifi
 ed 
Cox proportional hazards model. The trial protocol,

Role of the funding source
The study was designed by academic investigators and 
representatives of the funder (Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
Corporation). Data were collected electronically via data 
management systems of a contract research organisation 
 
(PPD Global Ltd, Cambridge, UK) designated by the 
funder and were analysed by the funder’s statistical team. 
All authors contributed to the interpretation of data and 
the subsequent writing, reviewing, and amending of the 
report; the fi
 rst draft of the report was prepared by the 
fi
 rst author (JCY) and a medical writer employed by the 
funder. All authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and attest that the study 
conformed to the protocol and statistical analysis plan.
Results
Between April 3, 2012, and Aug 23, 2013, a total of 
302 eligible patients with advanced, non-functional 
neuroendocrine tumours of lung or gastrointestinal 
origin were enrolled and randomly assigned to everolimus 
10 mg per day (205 patients) or placebo (97 patients; 
fi
 gure 1). Two patients randomly assigned to everolimus 
were not treated due to withdrawal of consent and 
protocol deviation and one patient randomly assigned to 
everolimus inadvertently received placebo because of 
dispensation error at site; therefore, the safety population 
comprises 202 patients in the everolimus group and 98 in 
the placebo group. The baseline characteristics of patients 
in both groups were generally well balanced (table 1).
The most common sites of tumour origin were the lung, 
ileum, and rectum. Median time from initial diagnosis to 
randomisation was 29·9 months (range 0·7–258·4) in the 
everolimus group and 28·9 months (1·1–303·3) in the 
placebo group. More than half of the patient population 
had a history of previous treatment with somatostatin 
analogue therapy (mostly for tumour control). A quarter 
of the patients had received chemotherapy. The two 
treatment groups were also similar in terms of previous 
radiotherapy, including peptide receptor radionuclide 
therapy, and locoregional therapies, including transarterial 
embolisation, cryo 
ablation, or radiofrequency ablation.

everolimus group and 3·9 months (3·6–7·4) in the 
placebo group. Everolimus was associated with a 52% 
reduction in the estimated risk of disease progression or 
death (HR 0·48 [95% CI 0·35–0·67], p<0·00001; 
fi
 gure 2A and table 2).
The estimated progression-free survival rate at 12 months 
(according to central review) was 44% in the everolimus 
group and 28% in the placebo group (fi
 gure 2A), which 
suggests a durable benefi
 t with everolimus.
Findings by investigator assessment were consistent 
with the central review. Median progression-free survival 
was 14·0 months (95% CI 11·2–17·7) with everolimus and 
5·5 months (3·7–7·4) with placebo (HR 0·39 [95% CI 
0·28–0·54], p<0·00001; fi
 gure 2B, table 2).
Consistent treatment benefi
 ts with everolimus were 
recorded irrespective of the stratifi
 cation factors 
(fi
 gure 3A). Additional prespecifi
 ed subgroup analyses of 
progression-free survival according to central radiological 
assessment showed a consistent positive treatment eff
 ect 
of everolimus versus placebo across major demographic 
and prognostic subgroups (fi
 gure 3B).
 
 
 
A retrospective analysis showed consistent benefi
 cial 
eff
 ect across the subgroups based on primary tumour 
origin (lung, gastrointestinal, or neuroendocrine tumours 
of unknown primary origin; fi
 gure 3C). A positive 
treatment eff
 ect was also recorded irrespective of the 
extent of liver metastasis (appendix p 5). 
Since the progression-free survival results were 
signifi
 cant, a planned interim overall survival analysis 
was done. This fi
 rst overall survival analysis was done 
with a total of 70 deaths and favoured everolimus with 
36% reduction in the estimated risk of death relative to 
placebo, although statistical signifi
 cance was not attained 
(HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·40–1·05], p=0·037 [the Lan-DeMets 
O’Brian Fleming boundary for signifi
 cance at fi
 rst 
interim analysis was 0·0002]; fi
 gure 2C). Data were not 
mature enough to provide an estimation of median 
overall survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall 
survival at the 25th percentile (25% of patients having 
survival events) were 23·7 months (95% CI 17·6–27·3) in 
the everolimus group and 16·5 months (9·0–21·0) in the 
placebo group.
Confi
 rmed objective responses (by central radiology 
review; all partial responses) were recorded in four (2%) 
patients receiving everolimus and in one patient (1%) 
receiving placebo. Disease stabilisation was the best 
overall response in 165 patients (81%) in the everolimus 
group compared with 62 patients (64%) in the placebo 
group. Therefore, the prolongation in progression-free 
survival with everolimus was probably secondary to the 
stabilisation of disease or minor tumour shrinkage and 
to fewer cases of progressive disease. Everolimus was 
associated with a higher disease control rate compared 
with placebo (appendix p 6). Of the patients that could 
be assessed for tumour shrinkage, 117 (64%) in the 
everolimus group and 22 (26%) in the placebo group had 
some degree of tumour shrinkage (fi
 gure 4). Results for 
the other secondary endpoints will be presented in 
future publications.
With a median follow-up period of 21 months, the 
median duration of treatment was nearly twice as long in 
the everolimus group as in the placebo group (40·4 weeks 
[range 0·7–120·4] in the everolimus group vs 19·6 weeks 
[4·0–130·3] in the placebo group). This diff
 erence in 
exposure should always be considered when comparing 
various rates of reported adverse events that are not 
adjusted for treatment duration. The median relative dose 
intensity (the ratio of administered doses to planned 
doses) was 0·9 in the everolimus group and 1·0 in the 
placebo group. Without adjustment for duration of 
treatment, dose reductions or temporary treatment 
interruptions occurred in 135 (67%) of 202 patients 
receiving everolimus and 29 (30%) of 98 receiving placebo.
Adverse events were consistent with the known safety 
profi
 le of everolimus and were mostly grade 1 or 2. Rates 
of on-treatment deaths (those occurring during receipt of 
study medication or within 30 days of discontinuing 
therapy) were similar between the treatment groups 
(seven [3·5%] in the everolimus group and three [3·1%] in 
the placebo group). All except three deaths (1·5%) in the

septic shock, and cardiac failure) and two deaths (2·0%) in 
the placebo group (one case each due to lung infection 
and dyspnoea) were attributed to disease progression.
Table 3 lists the treatment-related adverse events that 
occurred in at least 10% of patients; the most common 
were stomatitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, infections, rash, and 
peripheral oedema. The most common grade 3 or 4 
drug-related 
adverse 
events 
included 
stomatitis, 
diarrhoea, infections, anaemia, and fatigue. Treatment 
discontinuation attributed to grade 3 or 4 adverse events 
related to the study drug were reported in 24 patients 
(12%) receiving everolimus and in three (3%) receiving 
placebo.
Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 32 patients 
(16%) in association with everolimus treatment. Most 
cases were of grade 1 or 2 severity; grade 3 pneumonitis 
occurred in three patients (1%) and no grade 4 cases were 
reported.
Discussion
In this randomised trial of patients with advanced, 
progressive, non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of 
lung or gastrointestinal origin, treatment with everolimus 
10 mg per day signifi
 cantly prolonged median 
progression-free survival by 7·1 months compared with 
placebo according to masked central radiology review. 
This 
almost 
threefold 
improvement 
in 
median 
progression-free survival corresponds with a reduction in 
risk of disease progression or death by 52% compared 
with placebo. This benefi
 t was confi
 rmed by the 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival analysis. 
Subgroup analyses suggested a consistent treatment 
benefi
 t across major subgroups.
The availability of targeted therapies has changed the 
treatment 
paradigm 
for 
patients 
with 
advanced 
neuroendocrine tumours. Somatostatin analogues have 
now been established as a standard of care for the 
eff
 ective treatment of carcinoid syndrome in functional 
neuroendocrine tumours. More recently, somatostatin 
analogues have also been shown to control tumour

inhibitors in this setting is probably due to a combination 
of factors including inhibition of growth factor signalling, 
metabolic signalling, epigenetic regulation, and perhaps 
undefi
 ned genomic variations, which converge to activate 
the mTOR pathway. Previously, using pair biopsy 
specimens, we showed that everolimus therapy in 
patients with a variety of neuroendocrine tumours leads 
to signifi
 cantly decreased S6 phospho 
rylation and a 
consistent decrease in proliferation of the tumour 
indicated by decreases in Ki-67 labelling.19,20 The fi
 ndings 
from the RADIANT-4 study validate the role of the mTOR 
pathway in neuroendocrine tumours of lung or 
gastrointestinal origin.
In this study, we assessed everolimus as a 
monotherapy 
against 
placebo 
in 
non-functional 
neuroendocrine tumours, including those arising from 
the lung or gastrointestinal tract, and showed that 
everolimus has a durable benefi
 t in delaying tumour 
growth. Prospective stratifi
 cation based on known 
prognostic factors in our study minimised confounding. 
Furthermore, unlike RADIANT-2, crossover from the 
placebo group to the everolimus group after progression 
was not allowed during the masked period in our study, 
which would avoid potential bias in the estimation of 
treatment eff
 ect on survival. Indeed, an interim overall 
survival analysis from RADIANT-4 suggested that there 
might be a trend in survival benefi
 t in favour of 
everolimus. Long-term overall survival results are 
awaited.
The safety and tolerability of everolimus in our study 
is consistent with the previous experience in the 
advanced neuroendocrine tumours setting.6,12 The most 
frequent adverse events reported with everolimus were 
of grade 1 or 2 severity, and included stomatitis, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, infections, rash, and peripheral 
oedema; the frequencies were similar to those reported 
previously. Most everolimus-related adverse events were 
manageable through dose modifi
 cation or interruption 
without changing the duration of treatment.
In summary, everolimus, as compared with placebo, 
was associated with statistically signifi
 cant and clinically 
meaningful prolongation of progression-free survival in 
patients with advanced, progressive, non-functional lung 
or gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours. The fi
 rst 
interim overall survival analysis suggested that a trend 
might exist towards improved survival in favour of 
everolimus, although this result was not statistically 
signifi
 cant. Up to two additional overall survival analyses 
will be done according to the statistical plan as the 
survival follow-up data mature. Everolimus was well 
tolerated and the safety fi
 ndings were consistent with 
previous experience. Taken together with results from the 
previous RADIANT-3 study in pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours,6 everolimus has now been shown to have 
robust antitumour activity across a broad spectrum of 
neuroendocrine tumours, including those arising from 
the pancreas, lung, and gastro 
intestinal tract.
