Physical activity, but not body mass index,
predicts less disability before and after
stroke
ABSTRACT
Objective: To determine whether physical activity and body mass index (BMI) predict instrumental
or basic activities of daily living (I/ADL) trajectories before or after stroke compared to individuals
who remained stroke-free.
Methods: Using a prospective cohort, the Health and Retirement Study, we followed adults
without a history of stroke in 1998 (n 5 18,117) for up to 14 years. We estimated linear regres-
sion models of I/ADL trajectories comparing individuals who remained stroke-free throughout
follow-up (n 5 16,264), those who survived stroke (n 5 1,374), and those who died after stroke
and before the next interview wave (n 5 479). We evaluated whether I/ADL trajectories differed
by physical activity or BMI at baseline (before stroke), adjusting for demographic and socioeco-
nomic covariates.
Results: Compared to those who were physically active, stroke survivors who were physically
inactive at baseline had a lower probability of independence in ADLs and IADLs 3 years after
stroke (risk difference 5 20.18 and 20.16 for ADLs and IADLs, respectively). However, a similar
difference in the probability of independence was also present 3 years before stroke, and we
observed no evidence that physical activity slowed the rate of decline in independence before or
after stroke. Unlike the results for physical activity, we did not observe a consistent pattern for
the probability of independence in ADLs or IADLs comparing obese stroke survivors to normal-
weight or to overweight stroke survivors 3 years before stroke or 3 years after stroke.
Conclusions: Physical inactivity predicts a higher risk of being dependent both before and after
stroke. Neurology® 2017;88:1718–1726

Identifying modifiable factors that may ameliorate the functional consequences of stroke is a high
research priority. Retrospective studies indicate that stroke patients who reported regular exer-
cise before stroke onset have milder strokes or better functional outcomes after stroke.1–5 Some
evidence indicates that mortality risk is lower and functional outcomes are better among obese or
overweight compared to normal-weight or underweight stroke patients,6–14 although higher
body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of ischemic stroke.15–20
Most prior research on the influence of prestroke physical activity and BMI on poststroke out-
comes enrolled stroke survivors and retrospectively assessed prestroke characteristics. However,
retrospective reports may be inaccurate,21 and such designs cannot evaluate how functional
status changed as a result of stroke, e.g., whether physical activity or prestroke BMI modifies
the change in functioning associated with stroke onset. Additionally, these studies cannot examine
functioning years before stroke to determine whether differences in poststroke functioning are driven
by prestroke functioning. Prior research also could not compare functioning in stroke patients or

 those who later develop a stroke to functioning
in healthy individuals. There is evidence that
even years before stroke diagnosis, cerebrovascu-
lar processes may impair functioning.22
To determine whether physical activity and
BMI predict disability trajectories before and
after stroke compared to individuals who remain
stroke-free, we compared instrumental activities
of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily liv-
ing (ADL) changes in a cohort with up to 12
years of follow-up on adults who were all
stroke-free at baseline.
METHODS The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is
a nationally representative cohort of individuals .50 years old
and their spouses.23,24 For this study, we included individuals
born between 1900 and 1947 who were interviewed in 1998;
participants were interviewed biennially through 2012. We
excluded 1,449 individuals with a history of stroke in 1998 and
305 respondents missing covariate information, which left
18,117 individuals for our analyses.
I/ADL assessment. At each biennial interview, participants or
their proxy respondents were asked to report whether they had
difficulty completing 5 ADLs (getting across a room, dressing,
bathing, eating, getting in and out of bed) and 5 IADLs (taking
medications as prescribed, grocery shopping, using the telephone,
preparing meals, managing money) in the previous 30 days.
Response options were “yes,” “no,” “don’t do,” or “refused.”
We analyzed ADL and IADL limitations separately. We used
the RAND version of the HRS data, focusing on binary indicator
variables for any reported ADL limitation and any reported IADL
limitation.25 “Don’t do” and “refused” are treated as no limitation
in the RAND coding. Our coding allows participants to become
disabled and subsequently recover independence.
Stroke assessment. Stroke events were self- or proxy-reported at
biennial interviews. During the interviews, respondents were
asked, “Has a doctor ever told you that you had a stroke?” They
were also asked for the month and year of stroke events. If
a participant died or could not complete the interview, proxy
respondents answered questions on stroke events. On the basis of
the responses, we categorized participants as never stroke (no
stroke during follow-up), stroke survivor (had a stroke and sur-
vived), or stroke decedent (had a stroke and did not survive to the
next interview wave).
For the small number of respondents missing stroke month,
we used the midpoint of the last known stroke-free date and the
date when the stroke was first reported.22 If a participant reported
multiple strokes, only the first stroke was included in our analyses,
and all follow-ups after the first stroke were defined as poststroke.
For each interview, we calculated the months until stroke date
and the months since stroke date. We estimated the association
between months until and months since stroke variables and
I/ADL independence. We converted all coefficients to years to
facilitate comparison with the rate of change in I/ADL indepen-
dence among stroke-free participants per year of age.
Modifiers. We were interested in whether physical activity and
BMI modify the association between stroke and I/ADL indepen-
dence. At baseline in 1998, participants were asked, “On average
over the last 12 months, have you participated in vigorous
physical activity or exercise 3 times a week or more? By vigorous
physical activity, we mean things like sports, heavy housework, or
a job that involves physical labor.” Participants were categorized
as active (vigorous physical activity $3 times a week) or inactive
(vigorous physical activity ,3 times a week). In addition, partic-
ipants were asked at baseline to report their current height and
weight. This information was used to calculate the participant’s
BMI, which was then categorized according to World Health
Organization cut points: underweight (,18.5 kg/m2), normal
weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), or obese
($30.0 kg/m2). There is a high correlation between self-reported
and measured BMI in HRS (r 5 0.921, p # 0.0001).26 We
present results of overweight and obese (reference group is normal
weight); there were too few underweight respondents (2% of
sample) to present their results.
Covariates. We considered the following covariates as assessed
in 1998 as potential confounders: age (continuous), race (black,
other, white), male sex, marital status (never married, divorced/
separated, widowed, married), Southern birthplace (yes or no as
defined by Census region), education (less than high school, Gen-
eral Education Development, high school, some college, college
graduate), mother’s education (missing indicator, ,8 or $8
years), per capita household wealth (quartiles), and number of
comorbidities (0–8; includes high blood pressure, diabetes melli-
tus, cancer, lung disease, heart disease, stroke, psychiatric prob-
lems, and arthritis). Continuous variables were centered at the
group mean. For categorical variables, the most prevalent group
was used as the reference category. Our reference group was 75-
year-old, white, married women who were not born in the South,
whose mothers had #8 years of education, and who themselves
had lowest-quartile household wealth, less than a high school
education, and no comorbidities.
Statistical analysis. Although this was not our primary interest in
this study, we first estimated risk differences for baseline physical
activity and BMI categories on stroke incidence using linear models.
For our primary analysis of interest, we used linear regression
to estimate I/ADL independence trajectories, estimating separate
models for ADL and IADL independence. We adjusted all mod-
els for the covariates described above. Coefficients are interpreted
as differences in the probability of being independent associated
with each risk factor (risk differences). When describing the asso-
ciation between our modifiers and the probability of being inde-
pendent, we use the term predict because this term describes an
association in which there is a temporal order between the expo-
sure and outcome as in these analyses. To compare the trajectory
of changes in independence before and after stroke by baseline
modifier status, we estimated separate models stratified by either
baseline physical activity or BMI categories including stroke sur-
vivors, stroke decedents, and stroke-free participants. We used age
as the time scale, centered at age 75 years. For stroke survivors,
time was specified by a slope for the annual rate of change in
probability of I/ADL independence for each year of age before
nonfatal stroke, a discontinuity term for change in probability
of independence at the time of stroke, and a slope for rate of
change in probability of independence in the years after stroke,
with additional adjustment for age at stroke. For stroke decedents,
time was specified by a slope for change in probability of indepen-
dence for each year of age before stroke, with additional adjust-
ment for age at stroke. For stroke-free participants, time was
specified by a slope of change in probability of independence
for each year of age. We also used these models to compare the
prevalence of independence 3 years before stroke (for stroke sur-
vivors and stroke decedents), just before stroke (for stroke dece-
dents), and 3 years after stroke (for stroke survivors), as well as

 the loss of independence at stroke onset (for stroke survivors) (see
appendix e-1 at Neurology.org for models and appendix e-2 for
an example calculation). We graphed predicted trajectories of I/
ADL independence for a reference respondent.
We formally tested for differences in I/ADL independence by
baseline physical activity and BMI categories on the multiplica-
tive scale by including an interaction term (e.g., modifier 3 time)
in pooled models.
Primary analyses were conducted in Stata 13 with repeated-
measures linear regression models (i.e., generalized estimating
equations), applied baseline (1998) sampling weights to make
the HRS sample representative of the 1998 US population born
1947 or earlier, and used robust standard errors.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. HRS was approved by the University of Michigan
Health Sciences Human Subjects Committee.

age of 12.04 years. Table 1 shows the characteristics of

 individuals included in this study by stroke status:
those who survived their stroke (survivors, n 5
1,374), those who had a stroke and died before the
next interview wave (decedents, n 5 479), and those
who remained stroke-free throughout follow-up (n 5
16,264).
Physical activity. Baseline physical activity was not asso-
ciated with risk of stroke. However, among those who
had stroke, baseline physical activity was associated
with a decreased risk of dying after that stroke and
before the next interview (b 5 20.110, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 20.154 to 20.067, table e-1).
Figure 1 shows the predicted trajectories of ADL
independence by physical activity status for stroke
survivors, stroke decedents, and stroke-free partici-
pants. Among stroke survivors, those who were phys-
ically inactive at baseline had a lower probability of
being independent 3 years after stroke than those who
were physically active at baseline (risk difference 5
20.089, 95% CI 20.144 to 20.035, figure 1, A and
B and table 2). However, this difference in the prob-
ability of independence between physically inactive
and active stroke survivors was also seen 3 years before
stroke (risk difference 5 20.109; 95% CI 20.156 to
20.063, table 2). Our design allowed us to explore
why differences in the probability of independence 3
years after stroke were similar to differences in the
probability of independence 3 years before stroke.
We observed that physical activity does not change
the rate of decline in independence (table e-2), and
compared to physically active individuals, physically
inactive individuals experienced a similar decline at
stroke event (risk difference 5 20.012, 95% CI
20.073 to 0.050), suggesting that being physically
active does not protect against the disabling effects of
a stroke itself. We observed no differences between
stroke decedents who were physically active and those
who were physically inactive 3 years before stroke or
just before the stroke event.
Our design also allows us to compare the trajecto-
ries of individuals who experience a stroke to those
who remain stroke-free. Compared to those who were
physically active at baseline and remained stroke-free,
physically active stroke survivors and physically active
stroke decedents had faster rates of decline in ADL

 independence before stroke and after stroke. Simi-
larly, compared to individuals who were physically
inactive at baseline and remained stroke-free, physi-
cally inactive stroke survivors and physically inactive
stroke decedents had faster rates of decline in ADL
independence before stroke and after stroke (table
e-2). This suggests that individuals who later experi-
ence a stroke may have other underlying pathophysi-
ology that causes their faster decline and that this
decline occurs even among those who are physically
active.
In general, patterns were similar in magnitude and
trend for IADL independence and for ADL indepen-
dence (figure 1, C and D).
Weight status. Compared to those with normal weight
at baseline, obese individuals had an increased risk of
stroke (b 5 0.014, 95% CI 0.001–0.027); over-
weight individuals did not have an increased risk of
stroke (table e-1).
Among stroke survivors, we observed no differen-
ces in rates of decline or in the probability of being
independent before or after stroke comparing individ-
uals who were normal weight at baseline to those who
were overweight. Those who were obese at baseline
had a lower probability of independence 3 years
before stroke (risk difference 5 20.074, 95% CI
20.144 to 20.004), but this difference did not per-
sist 3 years after stroke. Rates of decline were similar
for those who were obese compared to those who
were normal weight.
Among stroke decedents, we observed no differen-
ces in the probability of independence 3 years before
stroke or just before stroke between overweight and
normal-weight participants or between obese and
normal-weight participants (table 3).
Compared to those who did not experience
a stroke and were normal weight, normal-weight
stroke survivors and normal-weight stroke decedents
had faster rates of decline in ADL independence
before stroke and after stroke. Similar results were
seen among those who were overweight or obese (ta-
bles e-3–e-6).
There were no differences in the probability of
IADL independence either before or after stroke in
a comparison of normal-weight, overweight, and
obese stroke survivors and stroke decedents (figure 2
and table 3).
DISCUSSION Stroke survivors who were physically
inactive at baseline had lower probability of indepen-
dence in ADLs and IADLs 3 years after stroke,
whereas no clear pattern of functional independence
after stroke was found by baseline weight status.
The difference in the probability of I/ADL indepen-
dence after stroke by baseline physical activity mir-
rored the differences before stroke.
Several retrospective studies among cohorts of
stroke patients suggest that physical activity before
stroke is associated with milder strokes or better func-
tional outcomes after stroke.1–5 A large, prospective
cohort study of participants with incident stroke

 observed that baseline physical activity was associated
with a marginally nonsignificant increase in having
a Barthel Index score $95 compared to a Barthel
Index score ,95 (relative risk 5 1.49, 95% CI
0.99–2.24) up to 5 years after stroke.27 Similar to
our study, this finding suggests that those who are
physically active before stroke maintain a reduced risk
of disability years after stroke.
The current study helps elucidate whether the
association between physical activity and improved
poststroke outcomes is due to slower rates of decline
among those who are physically active or whether the
better poststroke outcomes merely reflect higher lev-
els of functioning before the stroke event. We
observed that the lower probability of independence
seen among physically inactive individuals is not
driven by faster rates of decline before stroke or by
the harmful effects of the stroke events. Instead, it
is driven by differences in the probability of indepen-
dence 3 years before stroke between physically active
and physically inactive individuals.
Almost all research on BMI and stroke outcomes
has been in cohorts of stroke patients and used the
modified Rankin Scale score to measure disability.
Studies are inconsistent, with some reporting a protec-
tive effect of obesity on disability7,12,13 and others
finding higher prevalence of disability among obese
participants16,19 or no association.20 The only pro-
spective cohort study in initially healthy individuals
observed no association between BMI and modified
Rankin Scale score at hospital discharge after ischemic
stroke.18 We add to the existing literature by exam-
ining the probability of independence before stroke
onset and rates of decline in independence over time.
We observed few effects of BMI on independence 3
years before stroke or on rates of decline in indepen-
dence after stroke.
Unlike most prior studies, our cohort enrolled in-
dividuals without stroke at baseline and examined dis-
ability trajectories as measured by ADL and IADL
limitations both before and after stroke. This design
rules out reverse causation from stroke severity to

 physical activity or BMI or biases implicit in retro-
spective reporting. Examining IADL limitations sub-
stantially adds to the existing literature because many
prior studies were unable to examine risk factors for
IADL limitations among stroke patients. IADLs
may be a major determinant of quality of life among
stroke patients,28,29 making it important to identify
factors that may reduce the risk of IADL limitations.
Similar to prior results in the general population30 or
among those with cognitive impairment,31 physical
activity was associated with a reduction in the prob-
ability of IADL dependence among those who expe-
rience a stroke in this study. Given that IADLs are
more cognitively demanding than ADLs32 and that
physical activity may help to maintain cognitive func-
tion,33,34 it is possible that physical activity before
stroke may protect against IADL limitations through
its effects on cognitive function.
Limitations to this study include the use of self- or
proxy-reported strokes and lack of information on
stroke subtypes. However, prior research has shown
similar stroke incidence rates in HRS and in cohorts
that used physician-verified stroke.35 The lower num-
ber of fatal stroke events compared to nonfatal stroke
events resulted in lower power for the fatal stroke
analyses. We focused only on a dichotomous mea-
surement of I/ADL limitations and did not examine
individual I/ADL limitations or a count of the num-
ber of limitations. We also chose to measure risk
differences instead of relative risks because risk differ-
ences may be more meaningful from a clinical and
public health perspective.36 Additionally, mortality in
the stroke-free group may have posed a competing
risk to observing incident disability, potentially lead-
ing to an underestimation of the incident disability
rate in the stroke-free. To preserve clarity of temporal
order, we used baseline values of BMI and physical
activity, but this precluded exploring how changes in
these factors may influence disability trajectories
before and after stroke. Additionally, individuals
may have developed functional limitations before
baseline that prevented them from being physically
active at baseline. Therefore, the results seen among
the physically active individuals may not represent
a causal effect of physical activity on independence
before stroke but may instead reflect the better overall
health and functioning of individuals who are able to
be physically active before stroke. Finally, our mea-
sure of physical activity was coarse and did not mea-
sure the type or frequency of exercise in detail.
Strengths to this study include the use of a large,
nationally representative cohort study with prospec-
tive ascertainment of physical activity and BMI and
repeated ascertainment of I/ADL limitations over
up to 12 years of follow-up. Additionally, all partici-
pants were stroke-free at baseline. This allowed us to
examine disability trajectories both before and after
stroke and to consider separately stroke survivors,
stroke decedents, and those who never experienced
a stroke.
Physical inactivity before stroke predicts higher
risk of being dependent both before and after a stroke
event. Future research directions include exploring
the association between physical activity intensity
and stroke outcomes to help inform public health rec-
ommendations and whether changes in physical
activity patterns also predict stroke outcomes.
