Abstract
Purpose—Tooth loss or periodontal disease is associated with systemic endothelial dysfunction, 
which has been implicated in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The relationship between 
oral health and POAG has received limited attention. Thus, we evaluated the association between 
oral health history and risk of POAG and POAG subtypes.

 Participants—Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants (40,536 men) followed 
biennially from 1986 to 2012. At each 2-year risk period, eligible participants were 40+ years old, 
free of POAG, and reported eye examinations.
Methods—Using validated questions, we updated participants' status on number of natural teeth, 
teeth lost, periodontal disease with bone loss and root canal treatments.
Main Outcome Measures—During follow-up, 485 incident cases of POAG were confirmed 
with medical records and classified into subtypes defined by intraocular pressure (IOP) (≥ or < 22 
mm Hg) or by visual field (VF) loss pattern at diagnosis (peripheral loss only or early paracentral 
loss). Multivariable relative risks (MVRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.
Results—Number of natural teeth, periodontal disease or root canal treatment were not 
associated with POAG. However, compared to no report of tooth loss, a report of losing teeth 
within the past 2 years was associated with a 1.45 fold increased risk of POAG (95% CI=1.06, 
1.97); in particular, a report within the past 2 years of both losing teeth and having a prevalent 
diagnosis of periodontal disease was associated with 1.85 fold increased risk of POAG (95% 
CI=1.07, 3.18). The associations with recent tooth loss was not significantly different for the 
POAG subtypes (p for heterogeneity ≥ 0.36), although associations were strongest in relation to 
the POAG subtypes with IOP < 22 mm Hg (MVRR = 1.93, 95% CI=1.09, 3.43) and with early 
paracentral VF loss (MVRR = 2.27, 95% CI=1.32, 3.88).
Conclusion—While the number of natural teeth was not associated with risk of POAG, recent 
tooth loss was associated with an increased risk of POAG. Because these findings may be due to 
chance, they need confirmation in larger studies.
Oral infections, leading to tooth loss or periodontal disease, have been related to a multitude 
of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, certain 
cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.1–6 There are several mechanisms underlying the 
association with systemic illnesses, as have been previously reviewed and summarized.1, 2 
Periodontitis, a common bacteria-induced oral inflammatory condition that destabilizes the 
tooth structural support apparatus, can produce transient bacteremia, which may lead to 
systemic endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammatory responses in various extra-oral 
tissues.7–9 Second, inflammatory markers generated from the affected periodontal tissue can 
also travel via the bloodstream to reach other tissue beds. For example, in neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, there is growing evidence that 
peripheral inflammation exacerbates the development of neuronal cell loss.3, 4 The third 
mechanism is the immune response to the bacteria, which involves the generation of 
antibodies to bacteria and their toxins, which may have off-target effects in extra-oral tissues 
(e.g., cross-reactive antibodies that contribute to atherosclerosis).10
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and is a 
chronic disease characterized by neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. 
In a clinic-based case-control study among African-Americans,11 compared to 45 controls, 
58 glaucoma cases showed significantly higher oral bacterial loads and significantly fewer 
teeth, especially in older persons.12 The same research group11 found that when glaucoma 
animal models were administered low-dose bacterial toxins, glaucomatous 
neurodegeneration ensued and was accompanied by microglial activation, upregulation of

 the complement system and toll-like receptor 4 signaling activity in the optic nerve. These 
results suggest that oral infections, particularly those that can lead to periodontal disease, 
may have systemic effects that can contribute to POAG.
We hypothesized that the vascular bed in the base of the tooth may be a conduit for 
inflammatory cytokines and microbes to access the systemic circulation and consequently 
the intricate optic nerve head microcirculatory system, leading to endothelial cell 
dysfunction that would compromise retinal ganglion cell axons. Periodontal disease is 
associated with impaired flow-mediated vasodilation, and treatment of periodontal disease 
has been shown to improve flow-mediated vasodilation.7–9 Importantly, POAG has also been 
associated with impaired flow-mediated vasodilation, and several studies have reported on 
genetic and environmental exposures related to endothelial cell function related to early 
paracentral visual field loss subtype of POAG.13–16
To further test the possible link between oral infections and POAG at the population level, 
we prospectively evaluated self-reported comprehensive analysis of oral health and risk of 
POAG and POAG subtypes using data from 40,536 men in the Health Professionals Follow-
up Study participants followed for 25+ years.
METHODS
Study population
The Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS)17 is an ongoing cohort study initiated in 
1986 when 51,529 U.S. male health professionals (dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists, 
optometrists, osteopathic physicians or podiatrists), aged 40–75 years responded to a mailed 
health questionnaire. In the HPFS, participants are followed every two years with 
questionnaires that ask about newly diagnosed diseases such as periodontitis and glaucoma 
as well as other health and lifestyle factors. The follow-up rate for the HPFS cohort is 
greater than 85%. This work was HIPAA-compliant, and the described research adhered to 
the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Human Research Committees of 
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Harvard School of Public Health ceded the 
oversight for this work to the Brigham & Women's Hospital (BWH) Institutional Review 
Board (IRB), which approved the study. The BWH IRB regarded participants' return of 
completed questionnaires as implied informed consent.
Ascertainment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) cases and subtype classification
We included 485 confirmed incident cases of primary open-angle glaucoma. Glaucoma case 
ascertainment occurred every two years; in questionnaires, participants were asked about eye 
exams and physician-diagnoses of glaucoma. For participants who reported a diagnosis of 
glaucoma, we sought permission to contact their eye care providers. Eye care providers were 
asked to send all visual field (VF) tests as well as medical records that established the 
diagnosis or a completed glaucoma questionnaire that asked about maximal intraocular 
pressure (IOP), status of the filtration apparatus, optic nerve structural information, 
ophthalmic surgery, and VF loss. Finally, records were reviewed by a glaucoma specialist

 (LRP), masked to participants' oral health history, to confirm POAG cases using 
standardized criteria.
For the majority of POAG cases (>70% of cases), the following criteria were met: (1) 
gonioscopy showed that the filtration angle was not occludable in either eye, (2) slit lamp 
biomicroscopy showed no evidence in either eye of pigment dispersion syndrome, uveitis, 
exfoliation syndrome, trauma, or rubeosis, and (3) at least 2 reliable tests demonstrated 
reproducible VF defects consistent with POAG. For the remaining POAG cases, the slit lamp 
exam and VF criteria were met, but documentation of pupil dilation without subsequent 
adverse events or of the angle appearing open based on slit lamp biomicroscopy was 
considered as evidence for non-occludable angles. For VF defects, we did not require a 
specific type of perimetry; however, full static threshold testing was documented in 95% and 
kinetic VFs in <1%. For static threshold or suprathreshold tests, we used the following 
reliability definitions: fixation loss ≤ 33%, false positive rate ≤ 20% and false negative rate ≤ 
20%. For kinetic VFs, a VF test was considered reliable unless the examiner noted test 
circumstances to the contrary.
New glaucoma diagnoses were self-reported by 4,239 HPFS participants. These were 
confirmed as various types of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect in 52%: potential POAG with 
VF loss (25%), only elevated IOP or optic disc cupping (15%), and other types of glaucoma/
glaucoma suspect (12%). The remaining (48%) were unconfirmed, as participants (16%), or 
eye care providers (6%) were unreachable, participants denied permission for record review 
(9%), participants indicated the report was erroneous (15%) or eye care providers refuted the 
glaucoma diagnosis (2%). Among those classified as potential POAG with VF loss, we 
included only the POAG cases that met our case definition (485 cases); other confirmed and 
unconfirmed self-reports were censored in the analyses as of the diagnosis date.
For secondary analyses, we classified cases into subtypes by IOP and by VF loss pattern at 
diagnosis. We defined subtypes of “high-tension” (n=341) and “normal-tension” POAG 
(n=144) as those with maximum untreated IOP > or ≤ 21 mm Hg, respectively. We defined 
subtypes by VF loss pattern: those with peripheral VF loss only (n=260) or early paracentral 
VF loss (n=147) or undetermined VF loss (n=78) with a method previously described.18 For 
POAG with peripheral VF loss only, any combination of nasal step, temporal wedge or 
Bjerrum area defects were present without any paracentral loss. For POAG with early 
paracentral loss, there was 1) paracentral loss only or 2) paracentral loss with VF loss in the 
Bjerrum area and/or nasal step zone in the same hemifield, but without any temporal wedge 
loss. We included the latter paracentral group because cases with only paracentral loss were 
uncommon (~21%) and cases with clear paracentral loss frequently also showed peripheral 
loss. Cases (n=78) with undetermined VF loss (i.e., VF loss in the paracentral and any 
temporal wedge region in the same eye or paracentral in one hemifield with peripheral loss 
only in the other hemifield) were censored in the analyses as of the diagnosis date.
Ascertainment of oral health
For determining the number of teeth and number of teeth lost, in 1986, we asked about the 
number of natural teeth, and in the follow-up questionnaires, we asked about any tooth loss 
during the previous 2 years. In a validation study of a general population sample, self-

 reported number of teeth was highly correlated with the actual number of teeth on clinical 
assessment (r=0.97).19
To ascertain periodontal disease history, in 1986, we asked about any periodontal disease 
with bone loss, and every two years, we asked about any new diagnoses of periodontal 
disease with bone loss. In the HPFS, we validated this question among dentist participants20 
and other study participants21 by obtaining radiographs from individuals with and without a 
self-reported history of periodontal disease. Radiographs were evaluated for bone loss in 32 
sites of all posterior teeth present except for the third molars by dentists who were masked to 
participants' self-report. Bone loss assessed from the radiographs was used as the standard 
measure of cumulative periodontal disease. We observed overall high validity of positive 
responses: in dentist participants (n=140), the positive predictive value was 0.76 and the 
negative predictive value was 0.74;20 in non-dentist participants (n=212), the positive 
predictive value was 0.80 and the negative predictive value was 0.68.21
Analysis study population
We excluded at baseline (=1986) the following HPFS participants, respectively: 1) 1,596 
who did not respond to baseline SFFQs or had outlying total caloric intakes as one of the 
original aims was to study diet and glaucoma (fewer than 70 out of 131 items blank in the 
SFFQ, with a total caloric intake <800 or >4200 kcal/day), 2) 1,927 with prevalent cancers 
excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, as cancer diagnoses could alter many health behaviors, 
3) 1,036 with prevalent glaucoma, 4) 956 lost to follow-up <2 years of baseline, 5) 3,273 
who never reported an eye exam during follow-up and 6) 18 who were missing information 
on oral health history at baseline. After these exclusions, 42,723 were eligible; however, at 
the beginning of each 2-year risk period, we applied additional provisional exclusions for 
age and eye exam status. For example, for the 1986–'88 risk period, 29,673 contributed 
person-time after we provisionally excluded participants (n=13,050) who were age<40 years 
or reported no eye exam. In later periods, those provisionally excluded were allowed in 
analyses if they met eligibility criteria during follow-up. Thus, over the study period, 40,536 
ever contributed person-time.
Statistical Analysis
Our main exposures of interest were number of teeth, diagnosis of periodontal disease, 
number of teeth lost (from 1988, when first asked, to 2012) and number of teeth with root 
canal treatment (from 1996, when first asked, to 2012), which were updated during follow-
up with repeated questionnaire information. To reduce misclassification of updated number 
of teeth, if a participant did not return a questionnaire, then we imputed the value using the 
updated number of teeth as of the immediately prior questionnaire; if a response was 
missing for two questionnaire cycles in a row, then the participant was censored at that point 
in the analyses of number of teeth and number of teeth lost.
Our main outcome of interest was all POAG. We calculated incidence rates of POAG by 
dividing the incident cases by person-years accrued for each category. For age-adjusted 
analyses, we conducted Cox proportional hazards analysis stratified by updated age in 
months and the specific 2-year period at risk,22 derived the multivariable relative risks

 (MVRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For multivariable analyses, we ran similar 
Cox models simultaneously controlling for potential glaucoma risk factors that were time-
varying. We conducted tests for trend by evaluating the significance of a variable 
representing category midpoint values. Similar approaches were taken to evaluate POAG 
subtypes.
Potential covariates were updated biennially using all information from baseline: glaucoma 
family history, African ancestry, Asian ancestry, body mass index (BMI; 22–23, 24–25, 26–
27, 28–29, 30+ kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (1–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30+ pack-years), 
hypertension, diabetes, physical activity (quartiles of MET [metabolic equivalent]-hours/
week), alcohol consumption (g/day) and caffeine intake (mg/day), updated number of eye 
exams reported during follow-up, self-reported history of cataract diagnosis or extraction, 
age-related macular degeneration, hypertension, diabetes, and recent report of physical 
examination (for health maintenance, for medical concerns or no report of a physical exam).
Secondary analyses
We performed several secondary analyses. We separately analyzed the risks of POAG 
defined by: 1) highest known IOP (high-tension (HTG) and normal-tension POAG (NTG)), 
and 2) pattern of VF loss (POAG with peripheral VF loss only (Peri-POAG) and early 
paracentral loss (Para-POAG)). For testing whether the associations with one POAG subtype 
are different from those with another subtype, we used the Lunn-McNeil approach23 to 
derive the p for heterogeneity. Also, we conducted sensitivity analyses, where, for each oral 
health history variable, we additionally adjusted for other oral health history related 
variables as appropriate: updated number of teeth (continuous), periodontal disease history 
(none, diagnosis in past >2 years prior, diagnosis within 2 years), and updated number of 
teeth lost (0, 1, 2+). To evaluate detection bias, i.e., whether better screening practices leads 
to both greater dental care and diagnoses of periodontal disease as well as diagnoses of 
glaucoma, we repeated analyses among those who were 65 years or older (who tend to get 
more frequent health care overall). We also repeated analyses with a 4-year lag (e.g., 1990 
oral health history in relation to risk of POAG in 1994 – 1996 rather than 1994 oral health 
history), as it is possible that there are delays in POAG diagnosis due to its insidious nature. 
Furthermore, to test whether dental issues may be just a marker of poor health status that 
may be related to POAG (e.g., diabetes), we conducted analyses on a subset of participants 
after excluding those with diabetes, those who were obese, those who smoked ≥ 30 pack-
years, those who had reported no physician exams and those who reported having had a 
physician exam for medical concerns. As dentist participants may best report their oral 
health history, we also conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to dentist participants to 
evaluate the robustness of findings. Finally, as oral health history differed by race, we 
conducted an additional analysis restricted to Caucasians to evaluate whether any 
associations with oral health history may be due to race differences.
RESULTS
During 528,089 person-years of follow-up accrued over 26 years, we identified 485 incident 
POAG cases. Those with fewer teeth or who reported lost teeth in the most recent

 questionnaire (i.e., in the recent past 2 years) were older and had greater history of 
periodontal disease (Table 1). They were also more likely to be of African or Asian ancestry, 
to have a family history of glaucoma, to have a history of diabetes and heavy smoking and to 
consume more caffeine. They also exercised less and had higher BMI. These differences 
were adjusted for in multivariable analyses.
Compared to age-adjusted analyses, the multivariable analyses for number of teeth and 
POAG showed similar associations. We included 408 cases, after excluding those with 
missing data on number of teeth. Overall, we observed no linear associations with the 
number of teeth and all POAG or for other POAG subtypes (p for trend≥0.11 across 
outcomes; Table 2).
Compared with no report of periodontal disease during follow-up, a report of a diagnosis of 
periodontal disease in the past 2 years was not associated with POAG risk. Interestingly, 
reported diagnosis of periodontal disease during follow-up but not in the past 2 years was 
inversely associated with overall POAG: 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63, 0.98; p=0.03) (Table 3). Recent 
or past history of periodontal disease was not significantly associated with any of the other 
subtypes of POAG.
We conducted analyses from 1988 among those with at least 1 or more teeth (n=361 POAG 
cases) to evaluate tooth loss and POAG risk. Compared with those not reporting any teeth 
lost during follow-up, the MVRR was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.06, 1.97; p=0.02) for reporting 1+ 
teeth lost within the past 2 years and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.78, 1.46; p=0.69) for reporting 1+ 
teeth lost sometime during follow-up but not within the past 2 years (Table 4). Furthermore, 
with a report in the past 2 years of both 1+ teeth being lost and having prevalent periodontal 
disease with bone loss, the adverse association was stronger (MVRR =1.85; 95% CI, 1.07, 
3.18; p=0.03) than with one or more teeth being lost without periodontal disease (MVRR 
=1.33; 95% CI, 0.94, 1.89; p=0.11). Tooth loss in the past 2 years was also significantly 
associated with NTG (MVRR= 1.93; 95% CI, 1.09, 3.43; p=0.02) and Para-POAG (MVRR= 
2.27; 95% CI, 1.32, 3.88; p=0.003) (Table 4). However, the p for heterogeneity between 
HTG and NTG (p=0.46) or between Peri-POAG and Para-POAG (p=0.36) were not 
significant.
In an analysis from 1996 (n= 277 POAG cases), the number of teeth with root canal 
treatment was not associated with any of the outcomes (Table 5). The p for trend for 
increasing number of teeth with such treatment was 0.82 for all POAG, and it was ≥ 0.16 for 
all other subtypes.
In sensitivity analyses of tooth loss in the past 2 years and incident POAG, stronger 
associations were observed when in multivariable analyses, we further adjusted for current 
number of teeth and periodontal bone loss status: MVRR= 1.54 (95% CI, 1.11, 2.13; 
p=0.01) (not shown in tables). When we evaluated age subgroups, we observed that 
associations tended to be stronger in those <65 years (117 POAG cases; MVRR= 2.13, 95% 
CI, 1.21, 3.76; p=0.01) versus those who were 65 years and older (247 POAG cases; 
MVRR=1.25, 95% CI, 0.87, 1.80; p=0.23), with a borderline significant interaction (p for 
interaction by age = 0.06). Associations for tooth loss and incident POAG were attenuated

 when we introduced a 4-year lag period (309 POAG cases; MVRR=1.16, 95% CI, 0.80, 
1.68; p=0.44). However, associations were only slightly attenuated when we restricted 
analyses to Caucasians (349 POAG cases; MVRR= 1.40, 95% CI, 1.02, 1.93; p=0.04) or to 
dentist participants (210 POAG cases; MVRR=1.45, 0.93, 2.24; p=0.10), and associations 
seemed stronger in those who were relatively healthy, defined as those who all reported 
physical exams for health maintenance only (versus for medical concerns), who did not 
report any diabetes mellitus or obesity, and who reported less than a 30 pack-year history of 
smoking (157 POAG cases; MVRR= 2.13, 95% CI, 1.33, 3.39; p=0.002).
DISCUSSION
Primary open-angle glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to blindness and 
for which there are few established risk factors. In this large long-term prospective study 
among male health professionals, we observed no associations with number of natural teeth, 
history of periodontitis or number of teeth with root canal treatment. However, we observed 
that loss of at least one tooth reported in the recent past 2 years was associated with a 
modestly increased risk of POAG, and in particular, tooth loss accompanied by prevalent 
periodontal disease with bone loss in the recent past 2 years showed the strongest 
associations, although the confidence intervals for both estimates of associations were wide. 
Given that in adults 40+ years old, the most common cause of tooth loss is periodontal 
disease,24, 25 this suggests that oral infections that lead to periodontal disease with bone loss 
severe enough to lead to tooth loss, may be associated with transient increases in risk of 
POAG. Because this was the first study to link recent tooth loss with POAG, and some of the 
significant results may be due to chance, these findings should be interpreted with caution 
and confirmed with other studies.
To date, there has been scarce data linking glaucoma to the oral microbiome.11, 26, 27 One 
clinic-based case-control study of 103 African-American subjects11 observed that those with 
oral bacteria loads in the upper quartile were over three times more likely to have glaucoma 
and that glaucoma cases had significantly fewer teeth, especially in older persons.12 In 
addition, they observed that in two glaucoma animal models11 administration of low dose 
subcutaneous lipopolysaccharide to simulate the condition of chronic subclinical bacterial 
infection, exacerbated glaucomatous neurodegeneration. The possible mechanisms may be 
related to upregulation of complement system and toll-like receptor 4 signaling activity 
along with microglial activation in the optic nerve,11 which occur early in the glaucomatous 
process.28
In addition to a possible immune-related response in the optic nerve from oral infections, 
other mechanisms may be operative, especially IOP-independent mechanisms, as we did not 
observe associations for oral health history and HTG. Another IOP-independent mechanism 
that may explain the link between oral health and glaucoma may be systemic endothelial cell 
dysfunction. Periodontitis, the most common oral infection, induces a subclinical systemic 
inflammatory response leading to endothelial cell dysfunction, and such dysfunction can be 
reversed over several months with periodontal disease treatment.7–9 Endothelial dysfunction 
can lead to impaired flow-mediated vasodilation that affects blood flow to the optic nerve, 
which has been associated with POAG across the spectrum of IOP.29, 30 Our observation of

 somewhat stronger associations between recent tooth loss and POAG with early paracentral 
loss, a form of glaucoma linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction,31, 32 further supports 
this mechanism. The attenuated association with past tooth loss that occurred >2 years 
versus that reported in the past 2 years may reflect the possibility that occurrences of tooth 
loss or periodontitis that occurred > 2 years in the past would likely have been resolved or 
treated and that such treatment may have led to improvement in endothelial function and 
long-term better maintenance of good oral health,8, 9 unlike a recent bout of tooth loss that is 
accompanied by periodontitis. However, because this result may be due to chance, and our 
interpretation may be speculative, the modest associations observed need confirmation in 
studies with greater number of exposed cases.
We observed no associations between number of teeth with root canal treatment and POAG. 
Root canal treatment generally reflects prior endodontic inflammation, stemming from 
dental caries, and occasionally, root canal therapies are used to salvage teeth due to a variety 
of other reasons. The pathophysiology and microbes related to endodontic inflammation are 
different from periodontal disease; in particular, the dysbiosis associated with periodontitis 
evokes a strong and direct immune response, whereas the dysbiosis associated with caries 
promotes demineralization through acidogenic and aciduric mechanisms.33 Furthermore, 
endodontic inflammation is less common than periodontal disease, and there is much less 
evidence for the systemic impact of endodontic inflammation.34, 35
Our study had a few limitations. Because we were not able to conduct repeated eye exams 
on our participants over a 26-year period, we relied on participants' self-report of glaucoma 
confirmed with medical records. While such a case-ascertainment method would lead to 
underascertainment of glaucoma, methodologically, bias in the estimation of a relative risk is 
minimal if the outcome is highly specific (such as our definition of POAG that required 
reproducible VF loss on reliable VFs), and the ascertainment of disease is unlikely to be 
related to oral health.36 To help ensure that ascertainment of glaucoma itself would not be 
different by oral health status, we included only those who reported eye exams in analyses, 
adjusted for the following factors: the number of eye exams reported during follow-up; other 
eye diseases, and whether participants had physician exams for either symptoms or health 
maintenance. We also censored participants who did not respond to oral health questions on 
two consecutive questionnaires. Furthermore, to evaluate the possibility of reverse causality, 
we conducted analyses of whether having POAG itself may later lead to greater tooth loss. 
We identified 8310 events of incident tooth loss from 1988 to 2012; the multivariable RR for 
incident tooth loss in relation to prevalent POAG versus no POAG was 0.84 (95% CI= 0.48, 
1.46), indicating little support for reverse causation or co-occurrence of frequent eye exams 
and frequent dental exams explaining the association. Oral health measures were self-
reported in our study; however, the self-reports were validated to be accurate when 
compared against dental radiographic findings in a subset of our participants,19–21 and 
similar, although non-significant, associations with recent teeth lost were observed among 
dentists in our cohort. Given that our participants were all males and predominantly 
Caucasian, the magnitude of associations observed may not be generalizable to the general 
population. In our restricted analyses that included only Caucasians, the association with 
recent tooth loss was slightly attenuated, indicating there might be some differences by race. 
However, our results are consistent with the findings from studies of Astafurov et al.11 and 
Pasquale et al.

 Polla et al.12 conducted among African-Americans that implicated a role for oral health in 
POAG. More studies in women and other racial/ethnic groups may help to further shed light 
on this link, as prevalence of periodontal disease and dental problems differ by gender and 
race.37, 38
Our study has a number of strengths. The prospective design allowed us to examine the 
relation between oral health and incident POAG and allowed us to minimize recall bias or 
bias that may arise with including prevalent glaucoma cases if glaucoma treatment could 
modify the association between oral health and POAG. The number of teeth and periodontal 
disease status was assessed every 2 years over 25+ years. The results point to periodontal 
disease, as opposed to tooth loss related to dental caries or other causes, as the key dental 
exposure linked to POAG (Table 4). The association observed with number of teeth lost is 
unlikely to be due to tooth loss being a mere marker of overall poor health that may also be 
linked to glaucoma. After excluding those with diabetes, those who were obese, those who 
smoked ≥ 30 pack-years, those who had reported no physician exams or reported having had 
a physician exam due to medical concerns versus only for health maintenance, the 
association between number of teeth lost and POAG was robust, further supporting an 
etiologic link between dental pathology and POAG.
In conclusion, while the number of natural teeth and any periodontal disease was not 
associated with risk of POAG, we observed an adverse association between recent tooth loss, 
combined with recent periodontal disease, and risk of POAG. The results of this study raise 
important questions that could be addressed in future studies: how dental pathology, 
particularly severe periodontitis, may affect glaucoma pathology and whether prompt 
attention to periodontal disease might alter the development of glaucoma. Because this is the 
first study to link recent tooth loss with POAG, and some of the significant results may be 
due to chance, these findings should be interpreted with caution and confirmed with other 
studies.

loss. This classification is based on VF loss pattern as of the earliest reliable VF at diagnosis that was reproduced at the latest reliable VF. Cases 
with advanced VF loss at diagnosis (n=78) who could not be categorized based on initial presenting VF loss as either peripheral VF loss only or 
early paracentral VF loss were censored during analyses. See Methods for how cases were categorized according to initial presenting VF loss.

(African-American, Asian-American, all others), family history of glaucoma, self-reported history of cataract diagnosis or extraction, age-related 
macular degeneration, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index (22–23, 24–25, 26–27, 28–29, 30+ kg/m2), cumulatively averaged intakes of 
alcohol (g/day) and caffeine (mg/day), dietary nitrate intake (mg/day), pack-years of smoking (1–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30+ pack-years), physical 
activity (quartiles of MET-hours [metabolic equivalents] / week), recent report of physician exam (for health maintenance / for medical concerns / 
no report of physical exam), updated number of eye exams reported during follow-up
