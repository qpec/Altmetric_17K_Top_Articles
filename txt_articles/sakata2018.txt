OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between dementia
and risk of hospital readmission and to evaluate whether
the effect of dementia on hospital readmission varies
according to primary diagnosis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Nationwide discharge database of acute care
hospitals in Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older diagnosed
with one of the 30 most common diagnoses and dis-
charged from 987 hospitals between April 2014 and Sep-
tember 2015 (N 5 1,834,378).
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was unplanned
hospital readmission within 30 days. Poisson generalized
estimating equation models were fitted to assess the risks
of readmission for individuals with and without dementia,
using primary diagnosis as a possible effect modifier and
clinical factors as potential confounders.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of dementia was 14.7%
and varied according to primary diagnosis, ranging from
3.0% in individuals with prostate cancer to 69.4% in
those with aspiration pneumonia. Overall, individuals
with dementia had a higher risk of hospital readmission
(8.3%) than those without (4.1%) (adjusted risk ratio
(aRR])51.46, 95% confidence interval (CI)51.44–1.49),
although diagnostic category substantially modified the
relationship between dementia and hospital readmission.
For hip fracture, dementia was associated with greater
risk of hospital readmission (adjusted risk 11.5% vs
7.9%; aRR51.46; 95% CI51.28–1.68); this risk was
attenuated
for
cholecystitis
(adjusted
risk
12.8%
vs
12.4%; aRR51.03; 95% CI50.90–1.18).
CONCLUSION: Risk of hospital readmission associated
with dementia varied according to primary diagnosis.
Healthcare providers could enforce interventions to mini-
mize readmission by focusing on comorbid conditions in
individuals with dementia and specific primary diagnoses
that increase their risk of readmission. J Am Geriatr Soc

n acute care hospitals, 25% of admitted older adults
have dementia and greater risk of negative events
such as emergence delirium and in-hospital falls than those
without
dementia.1–3
Consequently,
individuals
with
dementia are likely to have poorer outcomes in acute care
settings such as long hospital stays and greater in-hospital
mortality than those without.2,4,5 In addition to these out-
comes during the hospital stay, early hospital readmission
after discharge is a critical outcome for individuals with
dementia and society.
To the best of our knowledge, 8 studies have been
published regarding the effect of dementia on early hospi-
tal readmission—a critical outcome in acute care set-
tings—but
previous
studies
have
produced
conflicting
findings.2,6–12 For example, one study found that the risk
of
readmission
was
27%
higher
in
individuals
with
dementia than in those without, whereas another study
reported that the risk of readmission was 9% lower in
individuals with dementia.2,8 This discrepancy could be
attributable to differences in composition of primary diag-
noses between these study populations. Such heterogeneity
in study populations may mask the extent and direction of
the true association between dementia and readmission.

 individuals admitted because of injuries was lower in those
with dementia than in those without, although this pattern
was not consistent across injury type.8 No study has for-
mally evaluated whether the effect of dementia on hospital
readmission differs according to primary diagnosis.
In addition, previous studies had important limitations
that could have led to an over- or underestimation and an
imprecise
estimation
of
the
true
association
between
dementia and readmission. First, most previous studies did
not adjust for important clinical factors such as baseline
mobility and severity of disease, which are considered to
be associated with risk of hospital readmission.2,6–9,12
Second, three prior studies were conducted in single insti-
tutions, which might limit the generalizability of the
results obtained.2,10,12 Furthermore, two studies were had
small sample sizes.6,12 Thus, further studies are required
to confirm the relationship between dementia and hospital
readmission.
A better understanding of the relationship between
dementia and readmission could facilitate more appropri-
ate discharge planning. In particular, identification of
diagnostic subgroups of individuals with dementia who
are at risk of readmission is needed to optimize use of
medical resources. Therefore, we aimed to assess the asso-
ciation between dementia and risk of hospital readmission,
accounting for primary diagnosis as a possible effect
modifier.
METHODS
Data Source
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Diag-
nosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database. Details
about this database have been published elsewhere.13–15
Briefly, the database contains clinical and procedural
information on all inpatients discharged from 1,189 acute
care hospitals in 2014 in Japan, which as a population of
127 million.16 The database includes approximately 8 mil-
lion admissions per year, representing 51% of all admis-
sions to acute care hospitals in Japan.17 Each hospital has
an incentive to provide accurate data under the public
insurance system.15 Physicians have the responsibility of
ensuring the accuracy of clinical information. The institu-
tional review board of the Tokyo Medical and Dental
University reviewed and approved our study design.
Study Population
We identified individuals aged 65 and older discharged
from acute care hospitals from April 1, 2014, through
September 30, 2015, and followed them until March 31,
2016. We considered only the first admission for individu-
als who had 2 or more admissions during the study
period. To maintain traceability, we restricted the analysis
to individuals discharged from hospitals that provided
data throughout April 2014 to March 2016. We defined
time 0 as the day of discharge from an acute care ward to
home or a nursing facility and excluded individuals who
were transferred to other types of hospital wards (e.g.,
psychiatric wards) or other hospitals and those who died
during the index hospitalization. Because diagnostic cate-
gory is considered to be strongly associated with readmis-
sion,9,18 we focused on individuals diagnosed with one of
the 30 most common diagnoses from the 504 DPC
diagnostic categories.3 Expert committees created the defi-
nitions of each diagnostic category, which are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Study Outcome
The primary outcome of this study was unplanned hospi-
tal readmission within 30 days of index hospital discharge.
Planned readmissions for purposes such as chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and surgery were excluded. Readmis-
sions for nontherapeutic purposes such as education and
diagnostic tests were also excluded. The secondary out-
come was emergency hospital readmission within 30 days
from index hospital discharge. Emergency hospital read-
mission included for reasons such as unplanned hospitali-
zation because of deep coma, severe respiratory or heart
failure, shock, and severe metabolic disturbance. Readmis-
sion status for the primary and secondary outcomes was
identified using a patient identification number anony-
mized within the data from each hospital.
Primary Explanatory Variable
Our primary explanatory variable was dementia status.
Prevalent dementia was defined as the presence of at least
one prescription of an antidementia drug during hospitali-
zation (donepezil, galantamine, memantine, rivastigmine),
a diagnosis of dementia (International Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes F00–F03, F05.1,
G30–G31), or a score of I or greater on the Dementia
Scale19—an observer-rated measure used to assess the
degree of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs)
related to dementia. It has six ranks (0, I–IV, and M).
Rank 0 refers to individuals without dementia; rank I
refers to individuals with dementia with almost no ADL
limitations; rank II refers to individuals with mild ADL
limitations due to symptoms, behavior, and communica-
tion who are able to live independently with assistance;
rank III refers to individuals with moderate ADL limita-
tions due to symptoms, behavior, and communication
who require caregiving; rank IV refers to individuals with
severe ADL limitations due to symptoms, behavior, and
communication who require full-time caregiving; rank M
refers to individuals with severe psychiatric symptoms,
behavioral and psychological symptoms, or physical disor-
ders who require medical care. The Dementia Scale has
high sensitivity and specificity for identifying dementia in
comparison with the Clinical Dementia Rating,20 good
predictive validity for changes in ADLs assessed using the
Functional Assessment Staging Test,21 and sufficient crite-
rion validity against the Mini-Mental State Examination
and the Hasegawa Dementia Scale—Revised.22 All hospi-
tals contributing to the DPC database were asked to rate
individuals using the Dementia Scale at hospital admission
by excluding transient disturbances due to physical condi-
tions and to classify the ratings into three categories: 0, I
to II, and III to IV or M.

 Covariates
We obtained data regarding demographic (age, sex, discharge
designation), clinical (diagnostic category, comorbidities,
ADLs, consciousness level), procedural (intensive care, sur-
gery, insulin, corticosteroids, hemodialysis, mechanical venti-
lation, length of stay), and disease-specific variables during
the index hospitalization. The Sundararajan version of the
Charlson Comorbidity Index (0, 1, 2, �3) at admission was
calculated based on ICD-10 diagnoses for comorbidities.23
ADLs were assessed at discharge using the Barthel Index
(<60 vs �60).24 Consciousness level at discharge was
assessed using the Japan Coma Scale (clear, I, II/III).25
Disease-specific characteristics included primary or recurrent
cancer; chemotherapy (none, oral administration, intrave-
nous or intra-arterial, other); timing of hospital admission
after onset of stroke (�3, 4–7, �8 days, no symptoms); worst
Hugh-Jones classification score during hospitalization, a 5-
point rating scale (I, II, III, IV, V);26 severity of community-
acquired pneumonia at admission based on the A-DROP
scoring system (Age (man �70, woman �75); Dehydration
(blood urea nitrogen �210 mg/L); Respiratory failure (oxy-
gen saturation� 90% or arterial partial pressure of oxygen
�60 mmHg); Orientation disturbance (confusion); and low
blood Pressure (systolic blood pressure �90 mm Hg) (mild,
moderate, severe to extremely severe);27 severity of heart fail-
ure at admission based on New York Heart Association clas-
sification (I, II, III, IV);28 severity of angina pectoris at
admission based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society
Grading System for angina pectoris (no symptoms, I, II, III,
IV); and severity of acute myocardial infarction at admission
based on Killip classification (I, II, III, IV).29 These covariates
were selected as potential confounders based on a priori clini-
cal knowledge and previous studies.2,6–9,30,31
Statistical Analyses
For the main analysis, we used a generalized estimating
equation (GEE) model with a Poisson distribution, a log-
link function, hospital as a random effect, and an inde-
pendent correlation structure to estimate risk ratios (RRs)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hospital readmis-
sion associated with dementia status.32 First, we con-
ducted bivariate analyses between each outcome and each
covariate
according
to
diagnostic
category.
We
then
removed covariates with a frequency of 0 to avoid numeri-
cal problems when fitting GEE models. Second, we calcu-
lated the proportion of missing data for each covariate
according to diagnostic category and removed covariates
with 10% or more missing data because of questionable
accuracy. Third, we removed all cases with missing data
in any of the selected covariates according to diagnostic
category. Fourth, we compared GEE models with and
without interaction (effect modification) between diagnos-
tic category and dementia status after accounting for hos-
pital effects. We used Pan’s quasi-likelihood under the
independence model criterion (QIC), which is similar to
the Akaike Information Criterion.33 The QIC statistics for
the primary and secondary outcomes favored the models
with the interaction term (QIC for primary outcome:
662,997 without interaction term vs 662,808 with interac-
tion;
QIC
for
secondary
outcome:
320,300
without
interaction term vs 320,130 with interaction), so we fitted
GEE models stratified according to diagnostic category.
Fifth, for each diagnostic category, we simultaneously
entered the primary explanatory variable and selected
covariates into the GEE model. All covariates entered into
the models are shown in the supplemental material (Sup-
plementary Tables S2 and S3). Finally, we performed sen-
sitivity analyses to test the robustness of the findings using
a stricter definition of dementia. In the sensitivity analyses,
prevalent dementia was defined as at least 1 prescription
of antidementia drugs during hospitalization, a diagnosis
of dementia, or a score of III or greater on the Dementia
Scale. All statistical analyses were performed using R ver-
sion
3.4.1
(R
Foundation
for
Statistical
Computing,
Vienna, Austria). The GEE models were fitted using the
geeglm function in the geepack R package.34 The signifi-
cance level was set at 5% for all analyses.

Study Population
Our cohort included 1,834,378 individuals from 987 hos-
pitals
(Supplementary
Figure
S1),
of
whom
269,951
(14.7%)
had
dementia.
The
prevalence
of
dementia
according to diagnostic category ranged from 3.0% of
participants with prostate cancer to 69.4% of participants
with
aspiration
pneumonia
(Figure
1).
Applying
the
stricter definition of dementia, the overall prevalence was
7.5% and ranged from 0.7% of participants with prostate
cancer to 52.5% of those with aspiration pneumonia (Sup-
plementary Figure S2). Participants with dementia were
older, were more likely to be female and to be discharged
to a nursing home, had more comorbidities, and were
more likely to have long hospital stays (Table 1). The dis-
tributions of covariates according to diagnostic category
are shown in Supplementary Table S4 to S11.
Dementia and Readmission
In the model without the interaction term, participants
with dementia had a higher risk of hospital readmission
(8.3%)
than
those
without
(4.1%)
(adjusted
RR
(aRR)51.46, 95% CI51.44–1.49), although the links
between dementia and hospital readmission were substan-
tially different according to diagnostic category (Figure 2).
In 17 of 30 diagnostic categories, there was a significant
association between dementia and hospital readmission
(Figure 2). For hip fracture, dementia was associated with
greater risk of hospital readmission (adjusted risk 11.5%
vs 7.9%; aRR51.46, 95% CI51.28–1.68); this risk was
attenuated
for
cholecystitis
(adjusted
risk
12.8%
vs
12.4%; aRR51.03, 95% CI50.90–1.18). Our main find-
ings were generally robust to sensitivity analyses using the
stricter definition of dementia (Supplementary Figure S3).
Namely, each CI from the main analysis included the
point estimate from the sensitivity analysis in 24 of 30
diagnostic categories (exceptions: bladder cancer, colon
cancer, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, inguinal hernia,
lung cancer).

 Dementia and Emergency Readmission
The findings for the secondary outcome were similar to
those for the primary outcome. In the model without the
interaction term, participants with dementia had a higher
risk of emergency readmission (3.9%) than those without
(1.5%) (aRR51.64, 95% CI51.59–1.68), although the
relationship between dementia and emergency readmission
was substantially different according to diagnostic cate-
gory (Figure 3). For participants with hip fracture, demen-
tia
was
associated
with
greater
risk
of
emergency
readmission (adjusted risk 6.7% vs 4.6%; aRR51.45,
95% CI51.18–1.77); this risk was attenuated for those
with
cholecystitis
(adjusted
risk
4.5%
vs
3.8%;
aRR51.17, 95% CI50.91–1.51). Our main findings were
generally robust to the sensitivity analyses using the
stricter definition of dementia (Supplementary Figure S4).
Specifically, each CI from the main analysis included the
point estimate from the sensitivity analysis in 23 of the 30
diagnostic categories, with the exceptions being angina
pectoris, colon cancer, diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal
inflammation, heart failure, lung cancer, and peripheral
arterial disease.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to for-
mally evaluate whether the effect of dementia on early
hospital readmission differs according to primary diagno-
sis. The study had 2 major findings. First, in 17 of the 30
most common diagnostic categories, participants with
dementia were more likely to be readmitted to acute care
hospitals
than
those
without
dementia.
Second,
the
influence of dementia on readmission varied according to
diagnostic category.
Our findings support and extend the current literature
by providing evidence of the association between dementia
and risk of readmission using a multicenter study design
with large sample size and accounting for primary diagno-
ses and several important clinical factors as covariates.
Some previous studies have focused on specific diseases
such as heart failure and hip fracture and found greater
risk of readmission attributable to dementia.10,12 For par-
ticipants with hip fracture, our findings were consistent
with those of a previous study, although our results
regarding heart failure were not robust across the defini-
tions
of
dementia.10,12
Alternatively,
a
prior
study
reported that individuals with hip fracture with dementia
were less likely to be readmitted than those without
dementia.8 Although the reasons for these discrepancies
between findings were unclear, they may be attributable
to the studies’ limitations, such as small sample size and
lack of adjustment for important clinical factors.8,10,12
One possible explanation for the greater risk of read-
mission is that individuals with dementia are limited in
their ability to follow postdischarge directions such as reg-
ularly taking medication and attending follow-up visits,
which may lead to poor health outcomes and, in turn,
readmission.
Although
hospital
admission
may
have
decreased the physical and cognitive function of individu-
als with dementia, special need for discharge planning is
not necessarily fully recognized in acute care settings.35,36
Another possible explanation is that individuals with
dementia are limited in their ability to recognize their con-
dition or to express their symptoms properly, either of
which may delay the decision to revisit a doctor and
receive the appropriate treatment.
Our new findings provide direct evidence that the
association between dementia and hospital readmission
varies according to primary diagnosis (effect modification).
Two previous studies provided indirect evidence of effect
modification. For example, a subgroup analysis showed
that risk of readmission for individuals with hip fracture
was 25% lower in those with dementia (13.7%) than in

 those without (18.2%), whereas the risk for individuals
with a nonfracture arm injury was 21% higher in those
with dementia (18.4%) than in those without (15.2%).8
Another study showed that, in individuals with heart fail-
ure, those with dementia were twice as likely to be read-
mitted (26.8%) as those without (13.2%), whereas in
individuals without heart failure, the risk of readmission
was similar for those with (13.2%) and without (13.2%)
dementia.12 By formally evaluating effect modification,
our study confirmed that the effect of dementia on hospi-
tal readmission differed according to primary diagnosis.
The effect modification we found could be attributed
to differences in main causes of readmission between dis-
eases. For example, the main reason for readmission of
individuals with aspiration pneumonia is considered to
be recurrence of aspiration pneumonia, which might
occur
more
frequently
in
individuals
with
dementia
because of deterioration in swallowing function than in
those without.37,38 This probably explains the greater
risk of readmission in individuals with dementia with
aspiration pneumonia than in those without dementia.
Alternatively, a main reason for readmission of individu-
als with cholecystitis is considered to be recurrence of
cholecystitis while awaiting surgery, which is hardly
associated with dementia. This may explain why the risk
of readmission for participants with cholecystitis was not
greater for those with dementia than for those without.
To confirm this explanation, further studies are needed
to
investigate
the
mechanism
underlying
this
effect
modification.
Given the greater risks of readmission for some pri-
mary diagnoses, routine screening for dementia in individ-
uals with those diagnoses could help predict their risk of
readmission. This information could help healthcare pro-
viders adjust postdischarge care to minimize the likelihood
of readmission of older adults with dementia.

READMISSION RISK IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA
5
 Our study has several limitations. First, because of the
nature of the data collection, our assessment of risk of
hospital readmission was limited to individuals readmitted
to the same hospital as the index admission. Consequently,
the risk of hospital readmission may be underestimated.
Second, it is unclear whether the Dementia Scale has good
intra- and inter-rater reliability in the database. Third, our
study did not consider the effect of severity of dementia
on effect modification. Therefore, the association between
readmission and severity of dementia for each primary
diagnosis is unclear.
In conclusion, the greater risk of readmission to acute
care hospitals of individuals with dementia varies according
to primary diagnosis. Healthcare providers could enforce
interventions to minimize readmission by focusing on comor-
bid conditions in individuals with dementia and specific pri-
mary diagnoses that increase their risk of readmission.
