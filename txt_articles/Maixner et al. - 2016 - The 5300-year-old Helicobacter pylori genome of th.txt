 microbial function spanning terrestrial ecosys-
tems, and though plant inputs are the dominant
source of organic matter, vertebrate corpse inputs
can be important resources (5, 6). For example,
one rain forest in Panama was estimated to receive
750 kg in mammal corpses annually per square
kilometer (12). Although this represents less than
1% of the mass of plant litter received by another
Panamanian rain forest (13), corpse nutrient
sources can be an order of magnitude more con-
centrated than plant litter (5), and direct com-
parisons between plant and animal decomposition
resources are rare (14). Thus, much is still unclear
about the role of corpse inputs in larger-scale
biogeochemical cycling (e.g., global carbon and
nitrogen cycling) and in supporting specific com-
munities and microbial diversity (14), and our
results provide an important microbial perspective.
A societal impact of these results is the value of
microbial data as physical evidence in medico-
legal death investigation. We show that decom-
poser microbial communities could potentially
serve as temporal (succession-based) and spatial
(origin-based) (supplementary text) forms of
physical evidence, such as the time elapsed since
death (PMI) and the location of death. Our obser-
vation that postmortem microbial communities
changed in a clock-like manner that provided
an estimate of absolute PMI is similar to using
the development of fly larvae to estimate PMI.
However, the fly larvae PMI proxy is limited by
corpse accessibility and season, resulting in PMI
estimates in the range of weeks, months, and
even years (15). Taken together, our findings dem-
onstrate that postmortem microorganisms can
provide both spatial and temporal insight into
the events surrounding death.

The stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori is one of the most prevalent human pathogens.
It has dispersed globally with its human host, resulting in a distinct phylogeographic pattern
that can be used to reconstruct both recent and ancient human migrations. The extant
European population of H. pylori is known to be a hybrid between Asian and African bacteria,
but there exist different hypotheses about when and where the hybridization took place,
reflecting the complex demographic history of Europeans. Here, we present a 5300-year-old
H. pylori genome from a European Copper Age glacier mummy. The “Iceman” H. pylori is a
nearly pure representative of the bacterial population of Asian origin that existed in Europe
before hybridization, suggesting that the African population arrived in Europe within
the past few thousand years.
T
he highly recombinant pathogen Helicobacter
pylori has evolved to live in the acidic en-
vironment of the human stomach (1). Today,
this Gram-negative bacterium is found in
approximately half the world’s human pop-
ulation, but fewer than 10% of carriers develop
disease that manifests as stomach ulcers or gas-
tric carcinoma (2, 3). Predominant intrafamilial
transmission of H. pylori and the long-term
association with humans has resulted in a phylo-
geographic distribution pattern of H. pylori that
is shared with its host (4, 5). This observation
suggests that the pathogen not only accompa-
nied modern humans out of Africa (6), but that
it has also been associated with its host for at
least 100,000 years (7). Thus, the bacterium has
been used as a marker for tracing complex demo-
graphic events in human prehistory (4, 8, 9). Mod-
ern H. pylori strains have been assigned to distinct
populations according to their geographic ori-
gin (hpEurope, hpSahul, hpEastAsia, hpAsia2,
hpNEAfrica, hpAfrica1, and hpAfrica2) that are
derived from at least six ancestral sources (4, 5, 8).
The modern H. pylori strain found in most Eu-
ropeans (hpEurope) putatively originated from
recombination of the two ancestral populations
Ancestral Europe 1 and 2 (AE1 and AE2) (6). It
has been suggested that AE1 originated in Cen-
tral Asia, where it evolved into hpAsia2, which
is commonly found in South Asia. On the other
hand, AE2 appears to have evolved in northeast
AfricaandhybridizedwithAE1 tobecomehpEurope
(4). However, the precise hybridization zone of
the parental populations and the true origin of
hpEurope are controversial. Early studies observed
a south-to-north cline in AE2/AE1 frequency in
Europe (4, 6). This finding has been attributed to
independent peoplingevents that introduced these
ancestral H. pylori components, which eventually
recombined in Europe since the Neolithic period.
More recently, it has been suggested that the
AE1/AE2 admixture might have occurred in the
Middle East or Western Asia between 10,000 and
52,000 years ago and that recombinant strains
were introduced into Europe with the first human
recolonizers after the last glacial maximum (7).

 In this study, we screened 12 biopsy samples
from the gastrointestinal tract of the Iceman, a
5300-year-old Copper Age mummy, for the pres-
ence of H. pylori. Stable isotope analyses showed
that the Iceman originated and lived in Southern
Europe, in the Eastern Italian Alps (10). Genet-
ically, he most closely resembles early European
farmers (11–13). The Iceman’s stomach was dis-
covered in a reappraisal of radiological data and
contains the food he ingested shortly before his
death (Fig. 1) (14). The study material included
stomach content, mucosa tissue, and content of
the small and large intestines (table S1). By using
direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR), meta-
genomic diagnostics, and targeted genome cap-
ture (figs. S1 and S2), we determined the presence
of H. pylori and reconstructed its complete
genome.
Metagenomic analysis yielded endogenous an-
cient H. pylori DNA (15,350 reads) in all gastro-
intestinal tract contents (Fig. 1 and table S4). A
control data set derived from Iceman’smuscletissue
was negative. The distribution of the observed read
counts throughout the Iceman’s intestinal tract
is similar to that in modern H. pylori–positive
humans, with abundance decreasing from the
stomach toward the lower intestinal tract (15, 16).
The retrieved unambiguous reads were aligned
to a modern H. pylori reference genome (strain
26695) and showed damage patterns indicative of
ancient DNA (fig. S7) (17). After DNA repair, the H.
pylori DNA was enriched up to 216-fold by using
in-solution hybridization capture (Agilent) (fig. S5).
From this data set, 499,245 nonredundant reads
mapped to 92.2% of the 1.6-Mb H. pylori reference
genome with an 18.9-fold average coverage (Fig. 2).
In comparison with the reference, the Iceman’s
ancient H. pylori genome had ~43,000 single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 39 dele-
tions that range from 95 base pair (bp) to 17 kb
and mainly comprise complete coding regions.
Owing to deletions, the number of genomic
variants is slightly below the range of what can
be observed between modern H. pylori strains
(table S13). The analysis of SNP allele frequen-
cies does not indicate an infection by more than
one strain (supplementary materials S6). In ad-
dition, as expected for this highly recombinant
bacterium, we found evidence for gene insertions
from H. pylori strains that differ from the refer-
ence genome (details about the InDels are pro-
vided in supplementary materials S8).

 Subsequent sequence analysis classified the an-
cient H. pylori as a cagA-positive vacA s1a/i1/m1
type strainthat is now associated with inflammation
of the gastric mucosa (fig. S11) (18). Using multistep
solubilization and fractionation proteomics, we
identified115humanproteinsinthestomachmeta-
proteome, of which six were either highly expressed
in the stomach mucosa (trefoil factor 2) (19) or
presentinthegastrointestinal tract and involved in
digestion (supplementary materials S10). The ma-
jority of human proteins were enriched in extracel-
lular matrix organizing proteins (P = 3.35 × 10–14)
and proteins of immune processes (P = 2 × 10–3)
(fig.S13).Intotal,22proteinsobservedintheIceman
stomach proteome are primarily expressed in neu-
trophils and are involved in the inflammatory host
response. The two subunits S100A8 and S100A9 of
calprotectin (CP) were detected with the highest
number of distinct peptide hits in both analyzed
samples. Inflamed gastric tissues of modern
H. pylori–infected patients also show high levels
of CP subunit S100A8 and S100A9 expression
(20, 21). Thus, the Iceman’s stomach was col-
onized by a cytotoxic H. pylori–type strain that
triggered CP release as a result of host inflamma-
tory immune responses. However, whether the
Iceman suffered from gastric disease cannot be
determined from our analysis owing to the poor
preservation of the stomach mucosa (fig. S3).

 and South Asia (Fig. 3A and fig. S14). The detection
of an hpAsia2 strain in the Iceman’s stomach is
rather surprising because despite intensive sampling,
only three hpAsia2 strains have ever been detected
in modern Europeans. Stomachs of modern Eu-
ropeans are predominantly colonized by recom-
binant hpEurope strains. Further analysis with
the STRUCTURE linkage model (23), used to detect
ancestral structure from admixture linkage dis-
equilibrium, revealed that the ancient H. pylori
strain contained only 6.5% [95% probability in-
tervals (PI) 1.5 to 13.5%] of the northeast African
(AE2) ancestral component of hpEurope (Fig. 3B).
Among European strains, this low proportion of
AE2 is distinct and has thus far only been observed
in hpAsia2 strains from India and Southeast Asia.
In contrast, the three European hpAsia2 strains
(Fig. 3B, black arrows) contained considerably
higher AE2 ancestries than that of the H. pylori
strain of the Iceman (Finland 13.0%, PI 5.9 to 21.7;
Estonia 13.2%, PI 6.2 to 22.3; and the Netherlands
20.8%, PI 11.5 to 31.7), although 95% probability
intervals did overlap. A principal component
analysis (PCA) of the MLST sequences of the
hpAsia2, hpEurope, and hpNEAfrica populations
revealedacontinuumalongPC1 thatcorrelateswith
the proportion of AE2 ancestry versus AE1 ancestry
of the isolates (Fig. 3C). The Iceman’s ancient H.
pylori was separated from modern hpEurope
strains, and its position along PC1 was close to
modern hpAsia2 strains from India, reflecting its
almost pure AE1 and very low AE2 ancestry.
Comparative whole-genome analyses (neighbor
joining, STRUCTURE, and principle component
analyses) with publicly available genomes (n = 45)
confirmed the MLST result by showing that the
Iceman’s ancient H. pylori genome has highest
similarity to three hpAsia2 genomes from India
(figs. S15 to S17). Although the Iceman’s H. pylori
strain appears genetically similar to the extant
strains from northern India, slight differences
were observed along PC2 in both MLST (Fig. 3C)
and genome PCAs (fig. S17) and in the neighbor
joiningtree(fig.S15).Tofurtherstudygenomic-scale
introgression, we performed a high-resolution
analysis of ancestral motifs using fineSTRUCTURE
(24). The resulting linked co-ancestry matrix (Fig. 4)
showed that the ancient H. pylori genome shares
high levels of ancestry with Indian hpAsia2 strains
(Fig. 4, green boxes), but even higher co-ancestry
with most European hpEurope strains (Fig. 4, blue
boxes). In contrast, the Iceman’s H. pylori shares
low ancestry with the hpNEAfrica strain, a modern
representative of AE2 (Fig. 4, black box), and with
European strains originating from the Iberian
Peninsula, where the proportion of AE2 ancestry
is relatively high (Fig. 4, white box) (4). Our sample
size (n = 1) does not allow further conclusions
about the prevalence of AE1 in ancient Europe and
the course or rate of AE2 introgression. However,
the ancient H. pylori strain provides the first evi-
dence that AE2 was already present in Central
Europe during the Copper Age, albeit at a low level.
If the Iceman H. pylori strain is representative of
its time, the low level of AE2 admixture suggests
that most of the AE2 ancestry observed in hpEu-
rope today is a result of AE2 introgression into
Europe after the Copper Age, which is later than
previously proposed (4, 6). Furthermore, our
co-ancestry results indicate that the Iceman’s
strain belonged to a prehistoric European branch
of hpAsia2 that is different from the modern
hpAsia2 population from northern India. The
high genetic similarity of the ancient strain to
bacteria from Europe implies that much of the
diversity present in Copper Age Europe is still
retained within the extant hpEurope population,
despite millennia of subsequent AE2 introgression.

The driving force behind Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles and much associated climate
change is widely considered to be orbital forcing. However, previous versions of the iconic Devils
Hole (Nevada) subaqueous calcite record exhibit shifts to interglacial values ~10,000 years
before orbitally forced ice age terminations, and interglacial durations ~10,000 years longer
than other estimates. Our measurements from Devils Hole 2 replicate virtually all aspects
of the past 204,000 years of earlier records, except for the timing during terminations,
and they lower the age of the record near Termination II by ~8000 years, removing both
~10,000-year anomalies.The shift to interglacial values now broadly coincides with the rise in
boreal summer insolation, the marine termination, and the rise in atmospheric CO2, which is
consistent with mechanisms ultimately tied to orbital forcing.

hanges to Earth’s orbital configuration rel-
ative to the Sun, known as the Milanko-
vitch hypothesis, astronomical theory, or
orbital forcing, have long been considered
the leading theory for the primary mech-
anism driving Quaternary glacial-interglacial
cycles (1–3) and associated climate change.
The hypothesis is supported by a huge array
of evidence from paleoclimate records across
the globe, which show that major shifts in
