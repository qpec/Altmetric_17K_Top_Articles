P
atients with multiple chronic conditions 
drive growing demand for health care,1,2 
but their needs may be poorly met by 
systems oriented toward acute care and man-
agement of single diseases.3 Individuals with 
more than 1 chronic disease comprise 12% of 
the Canadian population, but account for almost 
a quarter of physician consultations and half of 
hospital days.4 Compared with other member 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development, Canada performs 
poorly in accessibility, coordination and quality 
of care for patients with complex needs.5
Several jurisdictions in Canada and interna-
tionally have introduced incentive payments for 
primary care providers targeting the treatment 
of patients with chronic illnesses. However, 
despite widespread interest and use, we still do 
not fully understand the impact of incentive 
payment programs, especially for patients with 
complex illness. 
The province of British Columbia provides 
an ideal setting to evaluate the effect of incen-
tive payments for the care of patients with mul-
tiple chronic diseases. Other provinces intro-
duced chronic care incentives while making 
simultaneous changes to payment systems and 
primary care service delivery models.6,7 British 
Columbia’s Complex Care Initiative offers an 
annual $315 payment to physicians who accept 
responsibility for the provision of comprehen-
sive, continuous, guideline-informed care for a 
patient with 2 or more targeted chronic condi-
tions.8 This was implemented in 2007 within 
the existing fee-for-service payment system, 
and with no new support for team-based care or 
other service delivery models. In the year of 
their implementation, average billings for these

Background: In 2007, the province of British 
Columbia implemented incentive payments 
to primary care physicians for the provision 
of comprehensive, continuous, guideline-
informed care for patients with 2 or more 
chronic conditions. We examined the impact of 
this program on primary care access and conti-
nuity, rates of hospital admission and costs.
Methods: We analyzed all BC patients who 
qualified for the incentive based on their diag-
nostic profile. We tracked primary care contacts 
and continuity, hospital admissions (total, via 
the emergency department and for targeted 
conditions), and cost of physician services, hos-
pital care and pharmaceuticals, for 24 months 
before and 24 months after the intervention.
Results: Of 155 754 eligible patients, 63.7% 
had at least 1 incentive payment billed. 
 
 
Incentive payments had no impact on primary 
care contacts (change in contacts per patient 
per month: 0.016, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] –0.047 to 0.078) or continuity of care 
(mean monthly change: 0.012, 95% CI –0.001 
to 0.024) and were associated with increased 
total rates of hospital admission (change in 
hospital admissions per 1000 patients per 
month: 1.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.89), relative to 
preintervention trends. Annual costs per 
patient did not decline (mean change: 
$455.81, 95% CI –$2.44 to $914.08). 
Interpretation: British Columbia’s $240-million 
investment in this program improved compen-
sation for physicians doing the important 
work of caring for complex patients, but did 
not appear to improve primary care access or 
continuity, or constrain resource use else-
where in the health care system. Policy-
makers should consider other strategies to 
improve care for this patient population.

incentives exceeded $9000 per physician, or 
more than 3% of total annual billings. British 
Columbia’s single-payer system allows capture 
of all relevant use across physician services, 
hospital care and pharmaceuticals.
More than $240 million was spent on the 
Complex Care Initiative between 2007 and 
2013. Despite this investment, its impact on pri-
mary care delivery, hospital admissions and 
costs has not been rigorously assessed. Several 
articles reported favourably on BC’s incentive-
based primary care reform,8–10 claiming it was 
“improving physician morale and remuneration, 
improving patient care and revitalizing primary 
healthcare.”8 Some have imputed that it reduces 
costs of hospital admissions by increasing 
attachment to physicians (continuity), given the 
observation that patients with higher continuity 
cost the system less.8,10,11 However, all existing 
conclusions are based on cross-sectional com-
parisons of primary care use, hospital admis-
sions, and costs among patients with high and 
low continuity, or for whom incentives were 
and were not billed.8,10–13 Whereas some 
patient-level factors were controlled for statisti-
cally, no attempts were made to account for 
unobserved patient- or physician-level factors 
that might influence both propensity to bill 
incentives and other aspects of chronic disease 
care. Therefore, it is highly probable that these 
results are subject to selection bias. 
In our study, we used population-based and 
provider-specific administrative data and a 
quasi-experimental design to provide more rigor-
ous estimates of the impact of complex care 
incentives on primary care access and continuity, 
rates of hospital admission and total cost of care.
Methods
Setting
We studied BC’s Complex Care Initiative, 
which provides a $315 annual payment, in addi-
tion to regular visit fees, to compensate a pri-
mary care physician for the time and skill it 
takes to care for a patient with 2 or more tar-
geted conditions, and to develop and maintain 
patient care plans in accordance with BC clini-
cal guidelines. The physician must have pro-
vided most primary care physician services for 
the patient over the preceding year and accepted 
responsibility for longitudinal, coordinated care 
of the patient over the ensuing year. Targeted 
conditions were diabetes, chronic kidney dis-
ease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart 
failure, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease and asthma. British 
Columbia retained the fee-for-service payment 
system and made no structural changes to pri-
mary care provision, such as the introduction of 
team-based models of practice. In BC, patients 
have free choice of primary care physicians, and 
there is no formal rostering (assignment of 
patients to a responsible physician).
We used linked, de-identified data devel-
oped by the BC Ministry of Health and pro-
vided through Population Data BC, covering 
the period from Apr. 1 2005, to Mar. 31, 2012. 
The Medical Services Plan (MSP) registration 
file includes a record for all BC residents who 
received or were eligible to receive publicly 
funded health care services, including informa-
tion about individuals’ age, sex, health author-
ity of residence and number of days in each 
year registered for health insurance in BC.14 
The MSP payment file includes data on all fee-
for-service medical services claims paid to phy-
sicians. It describes services billed, including 
the incentive payments, and includes a patient 
diagnosis code for each encounter.15 The Hospi-
tal Separations file includes records of all inpa-
tient and surgical day care discharges and 
deaths for BC residents, including hospital 
admissions in other provinces.16 Each record 
contains a resource intensity weight variable 
that can be used to estimate costs. PharmaNet 
records cost information for all prescriptions 
dispensed in BC. 17 All inferences, opinions and 
conclusions drawn in this article are those of 
the authors, and do not reflect the opinions or 
policies of the data stewards.
Patients
We studied all patients registered with BC’s 
MSP from 24 months before to 24 months after 
the introduction of the incentive program in 
April 2007. As is consistent with chronic dis-
ease algorithms validated for use in BC and 
other Canadian provinces,18,19 we identified 
qualifying patients based on codes from the 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
Revision [Clinical Modification], and the Inter-
national Statistical Classification of Diseases 
and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, 
associated with 2 outpatient physician visits 
(excluding laboratory services) or 1 hospital 
admission during the study period for 2 or 
more targeted conditions and/or billing of the 
incentive with a corresponding code developed 
by the BC Ministry of Health to capture 2 tar-
geted conditions simultaneously (Appendix 1, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi 
:10.1503/cmaj.150858/-/DC1). We excluded 
individuals who moved into or out of the prov-
ince during the study period, and who received 
care from primary care providers not paid

under the fee-for-service model, because these 
patients’ service use is not completely captured 
in our data.
Study design
We used a quasi-experimental interrupted time 
series design to account for unobservable (but 
time-invariant) patient and physician character-
istics as well as secular trends surrounding the 
implementation of the incentives. We examined 
a constant cohort composed of all patients reg-
istered throughout the study period or up until 
death who qualify for the incentive based on 
their diagnostic profile, regardless of whether 
an incentive was billed for their care. We calcu-
lated population-level means for all outcomes 
during the study period. We adjusted denomi-
nators for all outcomes to include only those 
patients alive at the start of the month, because 
we thought that rates and costs per living 
patient are more interpretable. Before doing so, 
we verified that death rates were constant 
throughout the study period, thus ensuring that 
this adjustment would not affect our findings or 
conclusions. Our time series analysis estimated 
any immediate changes in the level or trend of 
chosen outcomes after the start of the incentive, 
while simultaneously controlling for pre-exist-
ing trends.20
Statistical analysis
We used generalized least squares models and 
included outcome-specific autoregressive terms 
to control for correlation over time. We 
checked linearity of the preintervention trend 
and included variables to account for seasonal-
ity where necessary. Changes in level were 
assessed using a binary variable that indicated 
the postincentive period, and changes in trend 
were assessed with a variable indicating the 
number of months that had passed since the 
incentives began. We estimated the absolute 
change in each outcome as the difference 
between the counterfactual (the preintervention 
trend projected forward) and the observed post-
intervention values, averaged across the 24 
months postintervention, with bootstrapped 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).21 We con-
ducted analyses in R 3.0.3 using the nlme and 
car packages.
We conducted additional analyses to confirm 
results were consistent using alternate study 
designs. Devising a methodologically sound 
control group was complicated for several rea-
sons. We observed that patients without incen-
tives differed in baseline characteristics, with 
lower continuity, higher rates of hospital admis-
sions and higher costs in the preintervention 
period, but this can be accounted for by exam-
ining preintervention level and trend in analysis 
with a control group. A greater challenge is that 
the incentive program both introduced new 
diagnostic codes that allowed physicians to 
record 2 conditions per encounter, and provided 
motivation to document more conditions. This 
means that patients with qualifying diagnoses 
identified before and after incentive introduc-
tion, and with and without incentives billed, 
differ in disease severity and patterns of health 
care use not captured in preintervention data. 
Finally, contact with the health care system in 
the period after incentive introduction is both a 
precondition to receiving the intervention and 
an outcome of interest. Patients with more fre-
quent contact with the health care system in the 
postintervention period were more likely to 
receive the incentive.
With these considerations in mind, we 
assembled a subcohort of patients with qualify-
ing disease before the study period and exam-
ined trends subdivided by whether or not an 
incentive was billed for their care, as well as in 
a propensity-matched subset of these patients. 
We also examined a cohort of only those 
patients who received incentives, with time 
zero set as the date of individual incentive bill-
ing, not the calendar date of incentive introduc-
tion. Finally, we used the fact that the list of eli-
gible conditions was expanded as of Jan. 1, 
2010, to confirm findings in a separate cohort of 
patients with newly qualifying conditions at 
that time.
Outcome measures
Primary care access and continuity
The incentive payment was, in part, intended to 
ensure that patients with more complex illness 
would not be “dropped in favour of easier, 
healthier patients,”8 thereby increasing access 
to and continuity of primary care among 
patients in need of complex care. Access was 
measured as the number of primary care 
contacts. Continuity was measured as the 
percent of primary care contacts in a given 
month with the usual provider of care assigned 
over the preceding 12 months. The usual 
provider of care was assigned on a rolling basis, 
as the physician providing the highest 
proportion of primary care contacts over a 
given year.
Hospital admissions
Although some patients require hospital care 
even with high-quality primary care, a goal of 
chronic disease management in primary care is 
 Research
E378 
CMAJ, October 18, 2016, 188(15) 
to prevent acute events requiring hospital 
admission, where possible. We examined all 
acute hospital admissions, admissions through 
the emergency department and admissions for 
the targeted chronic conditions. The latter is 
similar to ambulatory care sensitive conditions, 
in that there is substantial overlap between the 
targeted conditions, and those identified as 
ambulatory care sensitive.22
Costs
Better primary and secondary preventive care 
may reduce need for high-cost services such as 
acute inpatient care, and therefore overall 
health care costs.23 We tracked total (constant 
dollar) spending including the following cate-
gories: outpatient primary care, outpatient spe-
cialty care, laboratory and diagnostic services 
(excluding magnetic resonance imaging, which

This study was approved by the Behavioural 
Research Ethics Board at the University of Brit-
ish Columbia.
Results
We identified 155 754 eligible patients. Of 
these, 99 215 (63.7%) had a least 1 incentive 
billed for their care (Table 1). Those with 
incentives billed within the study period were 
older, had more chronic conditions and were 
more likely to live in the Vancouver Island 
Health Authority. They were also more likely 
to have received their qualifying diagnosis in 
the later 2 years of the study period, after the 
introduction of the incentive program.
Primary care access and continuity
At the beginning of the study, patients had a 
mean of 1.10 primary care contacts per month 
(95% CI 1.09 to 1.11), and 77.6% (95% CI 
77.0% to 78.1%) were with the usual provider 
of care assigned over the preceding 12 months 
(Table 2, Figure 1). At the time the incentive 
program was introduced, there was a very small 
increase in number of primary care contacts, 
but the overall change of 0.016 contacts per 
patient per month (95% CI –0.047 to 0.078) 
was not significant. We observed an attenuation 
of the decreasing trend in continuity of care 
after incentives were introduced, but this did 
not result in continuity returning to the level 
observed at baseline and after 2 years of incen-
tive payments, and the mean monthly change 
was not significant (0.012, 95% CI –0.001 to 
0.024) (Table 2, Figure 1). 
Hospital admissions
At the start of the study period, the study popu-
lation experienced a mean of 28.3 hospital 
admissions per 1000 patients per month (95% 
CI 28.1 to 28.5) (Table 2, Figure 2). Of these 
admissions, 65% were via the emergency 
department and 57% were for one of the tar-
geted conditions. There is no evidence that the 
introduction of incentives decreased any type of 
hospital admission. In fact, the slope of the 
post 
intervention trend was slightly higher than 
the preintervention trend, corresponding to an

CI 0.04 to 2.89), 1.0 admissions via the emer-
gency department (95% CI –0.11 to 2.2), and 
0.53 admissions for targeted conditions (95% 
CI –0.82 to 1.9) per 1000 patients per month.
Costs 
At the start of the study period, mean monthly 
health care spending was $588.20 per patient 
(95% CI $581.39 to $595.01), with a positive 
preintervention slope (Table 2, Figure 3). We 
observed a jump in total spending following the 
introduction of incentives, which amounted to 
an additional $37.98 per month (95% CI –0.20 
to 76.17), or about $455.81 (95% CI –$2.44 to 
$914.08) per patient per year. This includes the 
amount spent on incentive payments, as well as 
small increases in payments to medical and sur-
gical specialists and acute hospital costs. No 
changes were observed for pharmaceutical or 
laboratory spending.
Sensitivity of results to study design
Among patients with qualifying disease identi-
fied before the study period, those who received 
incentives for their care had higher continuity, 
fewer hospital admissions and lower costs in the 
preintervention period than those with no incen-
tives (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/

However, in the postintervention period, pa-
tients with incentives had no significant gains in 
access or decreases in hospital admissions or 
costs relative to patients without. Findings were 
consistent in the propensity-matched subset of 
these patients, except that continuity of care in-
creased modestly (mean monthly change 0.021, 
95% CI 0.013 to 0.030) (Appendix 3, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.150858/-/DC1).
Results were also consistent when examining 
cohorts composed of only patients who received 
incentives for their care aligned in time on the 
individual date of incentive billing (Appendix 4, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.150858/-/DC1), and when 
examining patients with conditions newly eligi-
ble when the list of conditions was expanded in 
2010 (Appendix 5, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
.150858/-/DC1). 
As with the reported findings, after taking 
into account pre-existing trends, there were no 
significant improvements in access or continu-
ity, or declines in hospital admissions and costs. 
The one exception was hospital admissions for 
targeted conditions, which peaked immediately 
before incentive billing among patients who 
received incentives, but declined over the post-
intervention period, whereas hospital admission 
for conditions newly targeted by the incentive 
program in 2010 rose during the postincentive 
period.
Interpretation
After accounting for secular trends, we found 
that BC’s complex care incentive payments 
had no overall impact on the number of pri-
mary care contacts or continuity of care, nor 
did they reduce hospital admissions or total 
costs. These findings contradict earlier claims 
of improved continuity and cost savings based 
on cross-sectional comparisons,8,10–13 but are 
generally consistent with previous research that 
has found limited impact of incentives within 
primary care.24
The interrupted time series design allowed 
us to control for physician and patient charac-
teristics that shape both billing of incentives 
and other aspects of patient care, a weakness of 
earlier analysis within BC8,10–13 and the likely 
reason our conclusions differ. 
That we observed no reductions in hospital 
admissions or costs may not be surprising. In 
studies of the UK Quality and Outcomes 
Framework, in which incentives were directly 
tied to measured quality of care, any observed 
decreases in hospital admissions accompanying 
observed changes in quality were small,25–27 and 
some studies found no association between 
measured quality and hospital admissions.28,29
Research to date, largely from the United 
Kingdom and United States, has provided 
mixed evidence of the effectiveness of these 
programs.24,30–34 Studies of Ontario’s pay-for-
performance initiatives showed modest im-
provements in delivery of some preventive ser-
vices35,36 and no change in management of 
patients with diabetes.37 The Ontario picture is 
complicated by the fact that physician payment 
mechanisms were also modified, which may 
have influenced both care for patients with 
chronic disease38 and uptake of incentives.39 
Most research in this area focuses on care 
for individual diseases, using the delivery of 
specific services as indicators of quality.24,30–34 
Evidence of the effect of incentive-based pro-
grams on broader outcomes such as access to 
primary care, continuity of care,40 hospital 
admissions25–29,41,42 and overall resource 
use30,34,43 has been inconclusive.
Limitations
We cannot rule out that there were other 
changes in the health care system that coincided 
with incentive introduction and that influenced 
measured outcomes. Our observation of similar 
findings among patients with diseases newly 
targeted by the incentive program in 2010 
offers reassurance that this is unlikely. Results 
may not fully account for the effect of natural 
disease progression, leading to observed 
increases in the trend of hospital admissions in 
the postintervention period.

the situation with earlier analysis.8,10–13 We may 
not observe some follow-up contacts under a 
block payment option discontinued Jan. 1, 
2008, but as there was no increase in contacts 
in 2008, any effect must be small. We assessed 
relational continuity of care with a single pro-
vider, because the incentives target care pro-
vided within a doctor–patient dyad,27 but were 
unable to measure informational or manage-
ment continuity.23 Rates of hospital admission 
are at best an incomplete proxy for the impact 
of care on disease progression, but if inaccessi-
ble, disorganized or noncontinuous primary 
care leads to acute admissions, improving pri-
mary care would affect hospital admissions 
soon after policy changes. Our assessment of 
cost per patient excludes out-of-pocket costs 
borne by individuals and families other than 
those for pharmaceuticals, as well as costs of 
home or long-term care.
Conclusion
Our analysis shows that incentive payments to 
individual physicians for the care of patients 
with 2 or more chronic conditions, in the 
absence of other changes to primary care pay-
ment or delivery, have not changed access or 
continuity, nor have they prevented hospital 
admissions or led to cost avoidance elsewhere 
in the health care system. British Columbia’s 
$240-million investment in this program may 
have improved compensation for physicians 
doing the important work of caring for patients 
with complex illness, but has not yielded mea-
surable improvements in the outcomes exam-
ined. Other strategies are needed to improve 
care for this patient group.
