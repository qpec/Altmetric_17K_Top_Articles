ontracted through the bite of an infected mosquito or
through sexual or other modes of transmission, Zika virus
(ZIKV) infection can be prenatally passed from mother to
fetus.1 The virus was first identified in the region of the Americas in
early 2015, when local transmission was reported in Brazil.2 Six
months later, a notable increase in the number of infants with con-
genital microcephaly was observed in northeast Brazil.3,4 Clinical,
epidemiologic, and laboratory evidence led investigators to
conclude that intrauterine ZIKV infection was a cause of micro-
cephaly and serious brain anomalies.5-7 However, as with other
newly recognized teratogens, these features likely represent a
portion of a broader spectrum.
AcomprehensivereviewoftheEnglishliterature,identifiedby
searchingMedlineandEMBASEforZikafrominceptionthroughSep-
tember 30, 2016, was done to better characterize the spectrum of
anomalies in fetuses and infants with presumed or laboratory-
confirmed ZIKV infection. A constellation of anomalies that is both
consistent and unique, called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), has
emerged but specific components and presumed pathogenetic
mechanisms previously have not been well-delineated.8-10
Zikavirusinfectionhasspreadtomorethan45countriesinthe
Americas and 3 US territories, and, most recently, local transmis-
sion was confirmed in the continental United States in the state of
Florida.11Mosquito-bornetransmissionofZIKVinotherareasofthe
United States is possible based on the estimated range of its vec-
tors(AedesaegyptiandAedesalbopictus).12RecognitionoftheCZS
phenotype by pediatric clinicians will help ensure appropriate and
timely evaluation and follow-up of affected infants.
IMPORTANCE Zika virus infection can be prenatally passed from a pregnant woman to her
fetus. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that intrauterine Zika virus infection is a cause
of microcephaly and serious brain anomalies, but the full spectrum of anomalies has not been
delineated. To inform pediatric clinicians who may be called on to evaluate and treat affected
infants and children, we review the most recent evidence to better characterize congenital
Zika syndrome.
OBSERVATIONS We reviewed published reports of congenital anomalies occurring in fetuses
or infants with presumed or laboratory-confirmed intrauterine Zika virus infection. We
conducted a comprehensive search of the English literature using Medline and EMBASE for
Zika from inception through September 30, 2016. Congenital anomalies were considered in
the context of the presumed pathogenetic mechanism related to the neurotropic properties
of the virus. We conclude that congenital Zika syndrome is a recognizable pattern of
structural anomalies and functional disabilities secondary to central and, perhaps, peripheral
nervous system damage. Although many of the components of this syndrome, such as
cognitive, sensory, and motor disabilities, are shared by other congenital infections, there are
5 features that are rarely seen with other congenital infections or are unique to congenital
Zika virus infection: (1) severe microcephaly with partially collapsed skull; (2) thin cerebral
cortices with subcortical calcifications; (3) macular scarring and focal pigmentary retinal
mottling; (4) congenital contractures; and (5) marked early hypertonia and symptoms of
extrapyramidal involvement.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although the full spectrum of adverse reproductive outcomes
caused by Zika virus infection is not yet determined, a distinctive phenotype—the congenital
Zika syndrome—has emerged. Recognition of this phenotype by clinicians for infants and
children can help ensure appropriate etiologic evaluation and comprehensive clinical
investigation to define the range of anomalies in an affected infant as well as determine
essential follow-up and ongoing care.

Congenital Zika Syndrome
Clinical features of CZS are a consequence of direct neurological
damage and severe intracranial volume loss. Of the 34 published
reports with sufficient clinical information on at least 1 component
of CZS, 11 were single case descriptions,13-23 21 case series,10,24-43
1 cohort study,44 and 1 case-control study.7 Two reports contain
information on pregnancies in French Polynesia24,29 and 29 in
Brazil; and there were 2 such reports in the United States13,15 and
1 in Spain,20 with exposure outside the countries of birth. For dis-
cussion purposes, these clinical components can be divided into
structural and functional components recognizing the overlap
between these categories. Structural components include cranial
morphology, brain anomalies, ocular anomalies, and congenital
contractures. Functional components are exclusively related to
neurologic impairment. Intrauterine growth restriction and low
birth weight have been reported in infants with presumed and
laboratory-confirmed congenital ZIKV infection24,37; however, its
relation to the CZS phenotype and pathogenetic mechanism has
not been determined.
Cranial Morphology

withintrauterineZIKVinfectioncanbeaccompaniedbyfindingscon-
sistentwithfetalbraindisruptionsequence(FBDS).45,46Fetalbrain

Figure2).Thereisoftenextremecraniofacialdisproportionwithde-
pressionofthefrontalbonesandparietalbones,whichcanoverlap.45
Typically, affected fetuses are noted to have decreasing head
circumferences in utero.36
The FBDS phenotype has been reported in an infant with
laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection,13 in a neuroimaging report
documenting cranial bone collapse in infants born to mothers with
suspected ZIKV infection during pregnancy,14 and a recent case
series of infants with probable ZIKV-associated microcephaly.38 In
3 of the largest case series reporting 35, 48, and 104 infants pri-
marily with suspected congenital ZIKV infection,33,37,38 approxi-
mately two-thirds of infants had severe microcephaly. In the
recent case series, most infants with probable congenital ZIKV
infection were noted to have craniofacial disproportion (95.8%)
and, to a lesser degree, biparietal depression (83.3%), prominent
occiput (75%), and excess nuchal skin (47.9%).38 Features sup-
portive of the FBDS phenotype scattered through published
reports include redundant scalp,27,36,39,41 occipital prominence
and/or overlapping sutures,14,20,22-24,26,27,38 and typical craniofa-
cial appearance with disproportion.13,27,33,34,40 The FBDS pheno-
type is also prevalent in ZIKV-related media.47 Among infants with
severe microcephaly, the pattern appears to be consistent,
although the degree of cranial vault deformation varies.

The FBDS phenotype is hypothesized to be a result of loss in

cifictotheetiologicagent.45,46WhileFBDSisnotuniquetoCZS,the
phenotype was previously rarely reported; a literature review pub-
lishedin2001identifiedatotalof20cases.46Toourknowledge,pub-
lishedserieshavenotprovidedsufficientdescriptorstoestimatethe
proportion of infants with the FBDS phenotype among those with
severe microcephaly and presumed or laboratory-confirmed ZIKV
infection to date.
Brain Anomalies
Gross brain pathology from infants with presumed or laboratory-
confirmed ZIKV infection, primarily from neuroimaging, closely re-
sembles neuropathology associated with congenital cytomegalo-
virus (CMV).48 The most notable difference is the distribution of
intracranial calcifications (ie, typically subcortical in congenital
ZIKV infection and periventricular in CMV).48,49 Such calcifications
are likely dystrophic and related to cell death, either by necrosis,
apoptosis, or both.50
A prospective series of pregnant women tested for ZIKV infec-
tion because of rash found that 7 of 42 women (16.7%) who under-
went fetal ultrasonography had fetuses with calcifications or other
central nervous system anomalies.44 Postnatal computed tomo-
graphicscanandmagneticresonanceimaginghaveidentifiedaspec-
trum of abnormalities that include, in decreasing frequency, dif-
fuse, primarily subcortical calcifications; increased fluid spaces
(ventricular and extra-axial); marked cortical thinning with abnor-
malgyralpatterns(mostconsistentwithpolymicrogyria);hypopla-
sia or absence of the corpus callosum; decreased myelination; and
cerebellar or cerebellar vermis hypoplasia (Figure 2).24,26,30,35-41 In
addition,calcificationshavebeenidentifiedinthebasalganglionand
brainstem in some affected infants.39 Some of these brain abnor-
malities can be detected prenatally with ultrasonography or mag-
netic resonance imaging29,35,36,39; however, with severe micro-
cephaly, the anterior fontanel is often small or closed,27,36 making
tranfontanellar ultrasonography in the newborn difficult.
ThecentralnervoussystemdamageseenwithprenatalZIKVin-
fection is likely due to direct cellular injury, as ZIKV RNA15,17,32 and
livevirus15havebeenidentifiedinthebraintissueofinfantswithmi-
crocephaly. Studies in experimental models have implicated neural
progenitor cells as a primary ZIKV target51-53; however, immature
neurons were also infected to a lesser extent.15 On microscopic ex-
amination of a ZIKV-infected fetal brain, postmigratory neurons—
primarily intermediately differentiated—were apopototic.15 These
findings support direct neural cell injury by ZIKV and suggest dis-
ruption of existing immature neurons, as well as decreased prolif-
eration and impaired migration due to loss of progenitor cells.
Expression studies of candidate viral entry receptors, such as AXL,
suggestthatseveralothercelltypes,includingastrocytes,endothe-
lial cells, and microglia, might also be ZIKV targets.54

ferinthosewithandwithouttesting.42Inthatseries,firsttrimester
maternal infection and smaller head circumference significantly
correlated with the presence of abnormal ocular findings.42
The pathogenesis of the posterior eye lesions is unknown but
might be due to direct cellular damage by ZIKV or inflammatory
sequelae. Active chorioretinitis, a possible precursor of chorioreti-
nal atrophy, has not been reported in infants with congenital ZIKV
infection, and the pattern of ocular findings differs from those in
other congenital infections.56 In particular, retinal lesions, includ-
ing well-defined chorioretinal atrophy and gross pigmentation,

Neurogenic factors that affect the corticospinal tract, motor
neurons, or their interactions can cause fetal motor abnormalities,
leading to diminished fetal movements and contractures.57,58 The
specific mechanism for contractures with prenatal ZIKV infection
is not fully understood. Among 7 infants with arthrogryposis, mag-
netic resonance imaging of the spine in 4 was consistent with thin-
ning of the cord and reduction in the ventral roots.41 In these 7
infants, electromyographic findings suggested long-term involve-
ment of peripheral motor neurons and central motor neurons.41 To
our knowledge, no pathologic examination of the spinal cord from
an affected infant has been published. The brainstem and spinal
cord of 1 fetus with ZIKV infection showed Wallerian degeneration
of the long descending tracts; however, the fetus was not reported

to have contractures, despite documentation of decreased fetal
movement.17 Previous reports of infants with the FBDS phenotype
have not described congenital contractures; intrauterine infection
with other viruses (eg, rubella, varicella, and coxsackie B) has been
implicated in infants with arthrogryposis.59,60
Neurological Sequelae and Prognosis
Information on long-term medical and developmental outcomes
for infants with CZS is sparse. Based on data on infants with FBDS,
development in infants with CZS is likely to be severely impaired.
In a 2001 review of FBDS, 19 of 20 infants had severe neurological
impairment; among 13 surviving infants, none had developmental
skills that exceeded 2 months.46 Three infants born after the
2013-2014 ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia and presumed to
have been infected in utero had severe neurological sequelae,
including motor and cognitive disabilities, seizures, and swallow-
ing difficulties, leading to failure to thrive; 1 infant had severe
vision loss and suspected hearing impairment.24 In a series of
newborns with microcephaly and presumed congenital ZIKV infec-
tion, of 23 with otoacoustic emission testing, 12.5% (2/16) of those
with severe microcephaly and 8.7% (2/23) overall had abnormal
results.33 Profound sensorineural hearing loss was reported in an
infant with characteristic brain imaging findings and cerebrospinal
fluid positive for ZIKV IgM,16 and sensorineural hearing loss was
documented in 4 of 69 infants (5.8%) with microcephaly and labo-
ratory evidence of congenital ZIKV infection.31 Neurological
examination of affected infants has shown hypertonia and
spasticity, irritability manifested by excessive crying, dysphagia,
and, less frequently, hypotonia.37,38 Abnormal activity on electro-
encephalogram was seen in 13 of 27 infants (48%) with presumed
congenital ZIKV infection and 14 infants (52%) had either focal
or multifocal discharges.38 In addition, tremors and pos-
turing consistent with extrapyramidal dysfunction have been
reported.13,37,38
Dataonmortalityassociatedwithsuspectedorconfirmedcon-
genitalZIKVinfectionaresparse,butprognosiswaspooramongin-
fants with FBDS in the 2001 review; 7 of 20 infants (35%) died of
pneumonia at a mean age of 6 months.46 Recently, mortality rates
atamedianof8daysfor76infantswithlaboratory-confirmedZIKV
infection was 41.1 per 1000.10
Differential Diagnosis
Infants with suspected congenital ZIKV infection should have a
comprehensive evaluation, as the differential diagnosis of CZS
includes both infectious and genetic etiologies.61 Although the
brain findings in CMV and CZS are the most similar among con-
genital infections, the FBDS phenotype has rarely been described
in congenital CMV,45 despite published imaging studies of fetuses
with CMV consistent with FBDS.49 Microcephaly occurs with con-
genital infections with a number of other virus such as human
immunodeficiency virus, varicella-zoster virus, and rubella
virus48; however, additional clinical findings (eg, hepatomegaly
and rash) help to differentiate these etiologies from ZIKV
infection.8,62 To our knowledge, no hematologic, hepatic, or renal
laboratory abnormalities have been documented in infants with
congenital ZIKV infection to date.
Several genetic etiologies share some similarities with CZS
including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome,63 “pseudo-TORCH”
syndrome,64,65 and mutations in the JAM3, NDE1, and ANKLE2
genes.66-68FamilialoccurrenceoftheFBDSphenotypehasalsobeen
reported, and for these cases, the term fetal brain arrest has been
proposed.69-71
Discussion
MostclinicaldescriptionsofZIKV-affectedinfantsavailableatthistime
are from Brazil. Two case reports in this review document probable
exposureinadditionalcountriesintheAmericas15,20andinfantswith
microcephalypresumedsecondarytocongenitalZIKVinfectionhave
beenreportedinpressreleasesfromanumberofcountriesinthisre-
gion.ApreliminaryreportfromColombiaof4infantswithlaboratory-
confirmed congenital ZIKV infection had the following brief sum-
mary of anomalies among those infants: abnormal brain findings by
ultrasonography (1 infant), abnormal hearing evaluations (3 infants),
andotherneurologicfindingsincludinghypotonia,poorsuckorswal-
low, and arthrogryposis of the lower limbs (number not specified).
These findings are consistent with the CZS phenotype.72
Based on the available data, it appears that the most common
timingofinfection,asdeterminedbymaternalsymptoms,islatefirst
andearlysecondtrimester;however,thirdtrimesterinfectionisalso
reported among affected infants.10,40 Although no definitive cor-
relation between timing of infection and severity of the phenotype
has been documented, among a case series of 1501 live births with
complete investigation, head circumference z scores varied by the

CZS phenotype will likely require epidemiologic studies to help ex-
clude coincidental associations and determine a more complete
phenotype for CZS.75
Limitations
LimitationsofthisreviewincludetheabsenceoftestingforZIKVin-
fection as well as the incomplete description of the full range of
anomalies in most reported infants. In addition, because many re-
ports focus on a single component of the syndrome, some infants
may be included in more than 1 report. Although the numbers are
small,recentreportsprovideevidencethatthedistinctivebrainand
eye anomalies of congenital ZIKV infection can occur without
microcephaly10,19,24,38,39,41,76; however, for some infants, hydro-
cephaly was the underlying cause of the normal head circumfer-
ence measurement.19,39 Expansion of the CZS phenotype to in-
clude infants with microcephaly but without brain anomalies has
been suggested in a recent case-control study; however, it is un-
clear whether these infants represented the effects of intrauterine
growth restriction because information on other growth para-
meters at birth was not provided.72 Finally, postnatal development
of microcephaly in an infant with presumed in utero exposure has
also been reported.38
Conclusions
Basedonourreview,ZIKVinfectioninpregnancyappearstobethe
causeofarecognizablepatternofcongenitalanomaliesthatiscon-
sistent and unique. Although many of the components of this syn-
drome,suchascognitive,sensory,andmotordisabilities,areshared
byothercongenitalinfections,5featuresdifferentiateCZSfromother
congenital infections: (1) severe microcephaly with partially col-
lapsed skull; (2) thin cerebral cortices with subcortical calcifica-
tions; (3) macular scarring and focal pigmentary retinal mottling;
(4) congenital contractures; and (5) marked early hypertonia with
symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement (Table). Recognition of
this phenotype by pediatric clinicians will help ensure appropriate
and timely evaluation and follow-up of affected infants.
