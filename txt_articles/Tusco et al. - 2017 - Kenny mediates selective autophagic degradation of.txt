Selective autophagy is a catabolic process with which cellular material is specifically targeted
for degradation by lysosomes. The function of selective autophagic degradation of self-
components in the regulation of innate immunity is still unclear. Here we show that Drosophila
Kenny, the homolog of mammalian IKKγ, is a selective autophagy receptor that mediates the
degradation of the IκB kinase complex. Selective autophagic degradation of the IκB kinase
complex prevents constitutive activation of the immune deficiency pathway in response to
commensal microbiota. We show that autophagy-deficient flies have a systemic innate
immune response that promotes a hyperplasia phenotype in the midgut. Remarkably, human
IKKγ does not interact with mammalian Atg8-family proteins. Using a mathematical model,
we suggest mechanisms by which pathogen selection might have driven the loss of LIR motif
functionality during evolution. Our results suggest that there may have been an autophagy-
related switch during the evolution of the IKKγ proteins in metazoans.

nnate immunity constitutes one of host’s first defense against
pathogen invasion and relies on inflammatory responses
controlled by the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) family
transcription factors1. These NF-κB associated pathways regulate
the expression of immune and stress response genes aiming at
clearing pathogens. However, improper activation of these
pathways can cause pathologies such as inflammation and cancer.
Thus, to maintain tissue homeostasis and organism survival, the
activation
of NF-κB associated pathways
must be tightly
regulated1–3. Drosophila innate immunity is controlled by two
major signaling pathways: the immune deficiency (IMD) and
Toll pathways. The activation of either pathway results in the
production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that neutralize the
bacterial load4–6.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process, by which
cells degrade their own cellular material. Autophagy serves as
a cellular response to nutrient starvation, and for the removal
of aggregated proteins, lipids, damaged organelles, and invading
bacteria
and
viruses2,7–13.
Autophagy
is
subdivided
into
three types (macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-
mediated autophagy) of which macroautophagy (hereafter refer-
red to as “autophagy”) is the most well-studied. During autophagy
there is sequestration of cellular material into double-membrane
vesicles called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes eventually
fuse with lysosomes where the sequestered cargos are degraded by
lysosomal hydrolases14. The sequestration and degradation of
cytoplasmic material by autophagy can be selective through the
action of specific receptor proteins9,15,16. Selective autophagy
receptors usually contain a short motif, termed LC3-interacting
region (LIR) or Atg8-interacting motif (AIM), that is necessary for
their interaction with the autophagosomal membrane protein
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (Atg8/LC3)16–18.
Atg8/LC3 is required for the proper formation and maturation of
autophagosomes, and serves as a central scaffold protein for
selective autophagy receptors and cargos19. The implication of
autophagy in the degradation of intracellular pathogens has been
widely described13. However, the molecular mechanisms that link
selective autophagy of cellular self-components and innate
immunity remains largely unexplored.
Using an in silico approach to identify Drosophila proteins that
interact with Atg8/LC3 proteins, here we show that Kenny, the
Drosophila homolog of IKKγ/NEMO, is an Atg8a-interacting
protein, and is required for the selective autophagic degradation
of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex to prevent the constitutive
activation of the IMD pathway by commensal bacteria. We
additionally
show
that
mammalian
IKKγ/NEMO
lacks
a
functional LIR motif. Finally, we present a mathematical model
which explores the evolution of the LIR motif during host
interaction with pathogens and commensal microbiota. Overall,
our results describe a molecular mechanism of selective autop-
hagy in Drosophila innate immunity, and suggest that pathogen-
related selective pressures may have induced the loss of a func-
tional LIR motif in mammalian IKKγ through evolution.
Results
Kenny is an Atg8a-interacting protein. In order to identify
LC3-interacting
region
(LIR)
motif-containing
proteins
in
Drosophila, we screened the Drosophila proteome for the
presence of LIR motifs using the iLIR software that we have
developed20,21. We focused on proteins that also contained
ubiquitin-binding domains22. One of our hits was the UBAN
domain-containing
protein
Kenny
(CG16910)
that
has
a
predicted LIR motif at its N terminus (Fig. 1)20,21. Kenny is the
Drosophila homolog of mammalian IKKγ/NEMO and has been
shown to control innate immunity in Drosophila through the
immune deficiency (IMD) pathway23,24. We found that in vitro
translated Kenny (35S-Myc-Kenny) binds to recombinant GST-
Atg8a, the Drosophila homolog of Atg8/LC3 (Fig. 2a). This
interaction was abolished by alanine substitutions of the aromatic
and
hydrophobic
residues
(F7A
and
L10A)
of
the
LIR
motif of Kenny (Fig. 2a). This observation was further verified in
Drosophila S2R+ cells. eGFP-Atg8a was co-precipitated with
wild-type 3XFLAG-Kenny while there was a 62% decrease in
the interaction with its LIR motif mutant counterpart (Fig. 2b).
Atg8-family proteins are able to interact with proteins that
contain
canonical LIR motifs via their LIR docking site
(LDS)15,17,25. We observed that a K48A/Y49A LDS mutant of
Atg8a was unable to interact with Kenny (Fig. 2a). In order to
investigate the functional relevance of the LIR motif in Kenny, we
constructed transgenic flies carrying either UAS-GFP-KennyWT
or UAS-GFP-KennyF7A/L10A and expressed them in the larval fat
body together with the autophagic marker mCherry-Atg8a26. We
observed that wild-type GFP-Kenny, but to a lesser extent its LIR
motif-mutated form, colocalized with mCherry-Atg8a-positive
autophagosomes after starvation-induced autophagy (Fig. 2c–e).
We also observed that wild-type GFP-Kenny, but not its LIR
motif-mutated counterpart, co-localized with active lysosomes as
monitored by Cathepsin-L staining (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Taken together these results indicate that Kenny is an Atg8a-
interacting protein and that this interaction is LIR motif-
dependent.
Kenny is selectively degraded by autophagy. Given the observed
interaction between Kenny and Atg8a, we examined whether
Kenny is degraded by autophagy. Western blot analysis of whole
body fly lysates showed a robust accumulation of Kenny in Atg8a
and Atg7 mutants compared to wild-type flies (Fig. 3a–c).
Accumulation of Kenny protein was found to be a post-
translational event since mRNA levels for Kenny were found
to be similar between wild-type and autophagy mutant flies
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Immunofluorescence analysis of endo-
genous Kenny in various tissues revealed that Kenny accumulates
and forms cytoplasmic aggregates that co-localize with Ref(2)P
and ubiquitinated proteins in autophagy mutant fly tissues, such
as adult brain, fat body and midgut, compared to wild-type flies
(Fig. 3d–l, Supplementary Fig. 3). This observation was further
reinforced by mosaic analysis which clearly showed an accumu-
lation of endogenous Kenny in autophagy-depleted (Atg5-RNAi
and Atg8a-RNAi) and autophagy mutant (Atg1 and Atg13) clonal
cells but not in their wild-type neighbors (Fig. 4). Furthermore,
expression of mCherry-eYFP-KennyWT and mCherry-eYFP-
KennyF7A/L10A in HeLa cells showed that Kenny was degraded
in the lysosomes in a manner dependent both on an intact LIR
motif and co-expression of Atg8a (Fig. 5).
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) constitutes another
major intracellular proteolytic system in eukaryotes27. To explore
the contribution of the UPS in the degradation of Kenny, adult
flies were fed with food supplemented with the proteasome
inhibitor Bortezomib or vehicle only. We found that there was a
modest (compared to the accumulation observed in autophagy
mutants) accumulation of Kenny upon proteasomal inhibition,
suggesting that Kenny is predominantly degraded by autophagy
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken together these results show
that Kenny is preferentially degraded by autophagy in a LIR-
dependent and Atg8a-dependent manner in basal conditions.
Autophagy mutant flies accumulate phosphorylated Kenny.
We observed that Kenny protein resolved into two bands in
lysates from Atg8a and Atg7 mutant flies while a single band was
observed in wild-type flies (Fig. 3b). The presence of a doublet of

 bands can be associated with post-translational modifications,
such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, which have been
shown to be involved in mammalian NEMO regulation28,29. We
investigated the possibility of phosphorylation as a cause of
appearance of Kenny doublet bands by treating lysates from
autophagy-deficient flies with either calf intestinal phosphatase
(CIP) or lamba phosphatase (λPP). In each case, we noticed that
the doublet of bands converted into a single band corresponding
to the lower molecular weight band (Supplementary Fig. 5a). To
test whether ubiquitinated Kenny accumulates in autophagy-
deficient flies, GFP-Kenny was expressed in wild-type or Atg8a
mutant flies and consequently immunoprecipitated from dena-
turated fly lysates. No ubiquitination pattern could be detected
using a pan-ubiquitin chain antibody (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
These results show that Kenny is post-translationally modified by
phosphorylation and is accumulated in its phosphorylated form
in autophagy mutants.
Kenny is required for the autophagosomal degradation of ird5.
Kenny is a component of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex
which consists of IKKβ/ird5 and IKKγ/Kenny, and is crucial for
nuclear translocation of transcription factor Relish and induction
of the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, includ-
ing Diptericin (Dpt)23,30–33. Using UAS-mCherry-ird5 transgenic
flies, we observed that mCherry-ird5 is diffused in the cytoplasm
of fat body cells in fed conditions (Fig. 6a). However, mCherry-
ird5 displayed a dotted localization after starvation, and co-
localized with Atg8a and Cathepsin-L (Fig. 6b–d). Using a UAS-
GFP-mCherry-ird5 transgenic line to distinguish acidic and non-
acidic compartmentalization of ird5, we observed an accumula-
tion of mCherry-only (acidic) ird5 puncta in starved conditions
(Fig. 6e, f). mCherry-only puncta exclusively co-localized with the
lysosomal marker Cathepsin-L (Fig. 6g). These results suggest
that ird5 is targeted to the autophagosomes to undergo lysosomal
degradation. This was further confirmed by the accumulation of
mCherry-ird5 when larvae were fed with the lysosomal inhibitor
chloroquine (Fig. 6h). Interestingly, we observed that adult flies
fed with Bortezomib exhibited a reduction of mCherry-ird5
protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 6). This observation reinforces
the hypothesis that ird5 is degraded by autophagy as impairment
of the UPS enhances autophagic degradation34. We then
expressed mCherry-ird5 along with GFP-Kenny wild-type or its
LIR-defective counterpart. We observed that the LIR motif in
Kenny was not required for mCherry-ird5 and GFP-Kenny
interaction (Fig. 7a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7). An in vitro GST
pull-down
experiment
confirmed
the
LIR-independent direct interaction between ird5 and Kenny
(Fig. 7c)24. In order to examine whether the targeting of the
whole IKK complex to the autolysosome is dependent on Kenny’s
LIR motif, we probed fat bodies from starved larvae with an anti-
Cathepsin-L antibody. While we observed a clear co-localization
of the three proteins when GFP-KennyWT is expressed (Fig. 7d),
the co-localization between mCherry-ird5 and the lysosomes was
lost when GFP-KennyF7A/L10A is expressed (Fig. 7e). Addition-
ally,
we
observed
that
starvation-induced
mCherry-ird5
accumulation is more prominent upon kenny RNAi-mediated
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 8). Finally, we observed that
the size of the starvation-induced mCherry-ird5 puncta was
reduced when key RNAi was co-expressed, compared to control
RNAi (Fig. 7f–h), suggesting less autophago-lysosomal targeting.
Collectively, these results show that Kenny is a selective
autophagy receptor for the degradation of the IKK complex by
autophagy.
The IMD pathway is controlled by selective autophagy. In order
to examine the physiological significance of IKK complex
accumulation in autophagy-depleted flies, we analyzed the
expression level of the IMD target gene Dpt. We observed that
there was a significant systemic upregulation of Dpt in Atg8a and
Atg7 mutant flies (Fig. 8a, one-way ANOVA test ***P < 0.001,
****P < 0.0001) that can be partially rescued by re-expressing
mCherry-Atg8a
in
the
fat
body
(Supplementary
Fig.
9).
Furthermore, the upregulation of Dpt was accompanied with
nuclear localization of Relish in fat body cells (Fig. 8b–d).
However, although we could detect nuclear translocation of
Relish in autophagy mutant gut cells, no significant upregulation
of the Dpt gene expression could be detected in isolated guts
(Supplementary Fig. 10, one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05), suggesting

 that the systemic deregulation of the IMD pathway is pre-
dominatly controlled by the fat body. To assess whether the
deregulation of the IMD pathway in autophagy-deficient flies is
related to the accumulation of Kenny protein, we created Atg8a;
kenny double mutant flies. We observed that the absence of kenny
expression in autophagy-deficient flies abrogates the constitutive
activation of Dpt observed in Atg8a mutant flies (Fig. 8e).
Together, these results show that the upregulation of the IMD
pathway when autophagy is blocked depends on Kenny.
In order to test whether the presence of commensal bacteria is
responsible for the upregulation of Dpt in autophagy-deficient
flies, we examined its expression in flies reared in germ-free
(axenic) conditions. Interestingly, no upregulation of Dpt was
observed in axenic Atg8a and Atg7-depleted flies compared to
their conventionally reared siblings (Fig. 8a). Together these
results indicate that selective autophagic degradation of IKK
complex prevents constitutive activation of the IMD pathway in
response to commensal microbiota.
Autophagy mutant flies exhibit hyperplasia in the gut. In order
to examine the physiological effect of systemic upregulation of the
IMD pathway in conventionally reared autophagy-deficient flies,
we examined cell proliferation rates by immunostaining posterior
midguts for phospho-Histone H3 (pH3), a specific marker for
mitotic cells. We observed that Atg8a and Atg7 mutant
flies exhibited higher numbers of pH3-positive cells compared to
wild-type control flies (Fig. 8f–h, l). Interestingly this phenotype
was not observed in guts from axenic Atg8a and Atg7 mutant flies
(Fig. 8i–k), suggesting that persistent deregulation of the IMD

 pathway as a result of stimulation from commensal bacteria
induces a hyperplasia phenotype in autophagy mutant flies.
Additionally, we observed that there is no increased pH3 staining
in Atg8a;kenny mutants (compared to Atg8a mutants), indicating
that Kenny-mediated upregulation of AMPs is causative of gut
hyperplasia in autophagy mutant flies (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Finally, we performed clonal expression of GFP-KennyWT
and GFP-KennyLIR mutant in adult midgut. We observed that
pH3-positive cells were present only in cells expressing GFP-
KennyLIR mutant and not in cells expressing GFP-KennyWT
(Supplementary Fig. 12).
To
understand
the
physiological
relevance
of
intestinal
dysplasia caused by autophagy depletion, we analyzed gut
function in wild-type and autophagy mutant flies. Feeding flies
with food containing blue dye revealed that flies with dysplastic
guts defecated significantly less (Fig. 8m, one-way ANOVA,
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001), indicating
increased retention of ingested food. In addition, we observed
that rearing Atg8a mutant flies in axenic conditions increased
their median lifespan (Supplementary Fig. 13). Together these
results show that an uncontrolled systemic immune response to
commensal
bacteria
in
Drosophila
promotes
a
dysplastic
dysfunctional gut that contributes to organismal death.
Mammalian IKKγ has lost its LIR motif during evolution. In
order to explore the conservation of Kenny LIR motif in
arthropods, we used BLAST analysis. We found that Kenny’s LIR
motif is conserved in other Drosophila species, in the common

 (Papilio xuthus), and silk moth (Bombyx mori) suggesting that
there is conservation between Diptera and Lepidoptera (Supple-
mentary Fig. 14). To examine whether Kenny’s LIR motif is
evolutionarily conserved in mammals, we tested the interaction of
its human homolog IKKγ/ΝΕΜΟ with mammalian Atg8-family
proteins. Interestingly, we found that IKKγ/NEMO does not
interact with any of mammalian Atg8-family proteins (LC3A/B/
C, GABARAP/L1/L2), which is consistent with the fact that we
could not identify any predicted functional LIR motif in its
sequence (Supplementary Fig. 15). In addition, using UAS-GFP-
NEMO transgenic flies, we observed that unlike GFP-Kenny,
human NEMO was unable to co-localize with mCherry-Atg8a-
positive autophagosomes (Supplementary Fig. 16).
To understand how the functionality of the LIR motif in IKKγ
may have been lost during evolution, we developed a determi-
nistic mathematical model, in which different host types, with
and without IKKγ LIR motifs, compete in the presence of a
pathogen and a proxy for a member of the microbiota (Fig. 9).
Mammalian pathogens have been observed to produce factors
which interact directly with NEMO/IKKγ and promote the
degradation of NEMO/IKKγ by autophagy35. We therefore
allowed the pathogen in our model to exist as two variants: one
encoding a protein with a functional LIR motif and one without.
Our results have shown that Drosophila Kenny/IKKγ can be
directly targeted for degradation in a lysosome by interacting
with Atg8a via its LIR motif. However, NEMO/IKKγ in mammals
has been shown to be ubiquitinated itself and therefore could
also interact with selective autophagy receptors via ubiquitin
tags29,36,37. Mammals are known to possess a greater range of
selective autophagy receptors than flies—thus the major mechan-
ism by which mammalian IKKγ is likely to be degraded during
infection probably involves ubiquitin tagging of IKKγ followed by
autophagy. We therefore considered 4 hypothetical host types
within our model: host type 1, in which IKKγ lacks a LIR motif
and cannot be tagged for autophagic degradation by ubiquitina-
tion; host type 2, in which IKKγ posseses a LIR motif and cannot
be tagged for autophagic degradation by ubiquitination; host type
3, in which IKKγ lacks a LIR motif and can be tagged for
autophagic degradation by ubiquitination, and host type 4, in
which IKKγ possesses a LIR motif and can be tagged for
autophagic degradation by ubiquitination. Type 2 hosts are
Drosophila-like, and type 3 hosts are human-like.
Full details of the mathematical model and its parameters are
found in the Methods section, but the following biological
assumptions were applied at all times: (1) A host with neither a
LIR motif on IKKγ nor the specific molecular machinery to target
IKKγ for autophagic degradation using a ubiquitin tag (host type
1) suffers excess mortality due to the stimulation of the innate
immune response by the microbiota. (2) Maintaining a regulatory
system capable of appropriately degrading IKKγ using ubiquiti-
nation is inherently more costly than regulating IKKγ by LIR
induced degradation, due to the proteins required to ubiquitinate
IKKγ and the need for appropriate selective autophagy receptors.
To explore the possible evolutionary reasons why the LIR motif
may have been lost during mammalian evolution, we considered
the following biologically plausible effects: (Effect I) If the host
can up or downregulate the degradation of IKKγ by ubiquitin
tagging, this may afford greater precision in regulating immuno-
pathology during infection, and result in reduced mortality
during infection. (Effect II) As in Effect I, but the advantage of
being able to precisely regulate the rate of degradation of IKKγ by
ubiquitin tagging may be reduced if a LIR motif is present on
IKKγ, constantly signaling it for autophagy. (Effect III) If the
pathogen encodes a LIR motif, this may enhance the degradation
of IKKγ during infection and attenuate the innate immune
response. The consequences of this (both of which could be
advantageous to the pathogen) may be (IIIa) a slower recovery
rate from infection, or (IIIb) reduced host mortality during
infection. We assumed that the pathogen is only able to
manipulate the host in this way if host IKKγ lacks a LIR motif
(host types 1 and 3).
Figure 9 illustrates the consequences for host and pathogen of
applying parameter values capturing these different effects. In the
absence of Effects I or II, or any pathogen LIR Effect (IIIa or IIIb),
host type 2 dominates, in the presence of a non-LIR encoding
pathogen (Fig. 9a, top left hand panel). This is a Drosophila-like
scenario (Fig. 9b). Host type 1 cannot succeed in this scenario
because it suffers excess mortality from the stimulation of innate

 immune responses by the microbiota, and host types 3 and 4
cannot succeed because they bear the extra cost of maintaining
pathways to autophagically degrade IKKγ by ubiquitin tagging.
As soon as we make additional assumptions about host or
pathogen advantage during infection, it becomes possible to
obtain a human-like scenario in which host type 3 dominates. If
we make the assumption that the host is best able to regulate
immunopathology during infection if IKKγ is regulated using
ubiquitin tagging, and that this advantage is greatest if IKKγ is
not being targeted for degradation by a LIR motif (Effect II), host
type 3 will dominate (Fig. 9a, bottom row). Alternatively, if there
exists a pathogen which encodes LIR, for which infection
mortality is specifically reduced in hosts where IKKγ lacks LIR
(Effect IIIb), theoretically this alone could overcome the cost of
maintaining pathways to degrade IKKγ by ubiquitin tagging and
allow host type 3 to dominate (Fig. 9a, top right hand panel).
There are therefore at least two biologically plausible mechanisms
by which host-pathogen co-evolution could result in the loss of
the LIR motif from IKKγ.
Discussion
Multicellular organisms are exposed to microbes throughout their
lives. These exposures can be transient or permanent, with
microbes
ranging
from
those
considered
commensal
to
pathogenic38–41. The initial host response to these microbes is
mediated by the innate immune system. This highly conserved
host defense has to be tightly controlled in order to not become

 harmful through inflammation38–41. In this study we have
described an essential role of selective autophagy in the termi-
nation of the innate immune response to commensal microbiota
in Drosophila. This process is mediated by Kenny which acts as a
selective autophagy receptor for the autophagic degradation of
the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Kenny is a component of the
immune deficiency (IMD) pathway which is activated following
the recognition of bacterial diaminopimelic acid peptidoglycan
(DAP-PGN), leading to the assembly of a receptor proximal
signaling complex5,23,42,43. Downstream signaling requires the
cleavage of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-like immune
transcription factor Relish, which translocates to the nucleus and
induces
the
expression
of
antimicrobial
peptide
(AMP)
genes30–32,44. Here we showed that selective autophagic degra-
dation of the IKK complex prevents the systemic immune
response that is mediated by Relish and the production of anti-
microbial peptides. Autophagy mutants fail to terminate this
response and exhibit systemic inflammation that contributed to
their premature death. Atg8a and Atg7 mutant flies have been
reported to have a short lifespan due to a neurodegeneration
phenotype45,46. Our results indicate that their short lifespan is
also mediated by systemic inflammation that affects the function
of the gut.
Selective autophagic degradation of Kenny is mediated by its
LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. We have shown the impor-
tance of the LIR motif for its degradation using four different
technical approaches: (1) mutation of the LIR motif drastically
reduces the co-immunoprecipitation between Kenny and Atg8a
when expressed in S2R+ cells, (2) mutation of the Kenny LIR
motif abrogates the direct interaction with Atg8a, as demon-
strated by GST pull-down experiments. Similarly, Kenny loses its
interaction with Atg8a lacking a functional LIR docking site
(LDS). (3) Using tandem-tagged Kenny expressed in HeLa cells,
we observed that wild-type Kenny is targeted to acidic com-
partments (autolysosomes) when the cells are under starved
conditions, while its LIR mutated counterpart is not, and (4) the
ability of GFP-Kenny to localize to autophagosomes and auto-
lysosomes in vivo is compromised when its LIR motif is mutated.
Although we were not able to show that autophagic degradation
of a genomic Kenny LIR mutant was compromised, we have
clearly shown that endogenous Kenny protein was robustly
accumulated in Atg8a and Atg7 mutant flies.
Furthermore, we showed that Kenny is accumulated in
autophagy mutant flies in its phosphorylated form. Interestingly,
Kenny does not appear to be phosphorylated when the protea-
some is inhibited. This suggests that phosphorylation of Kenny is
important for its function as selective autophagy receptor. Indeed
it has been shown that phosphorylation of various autophagy
receptors enhances their autophagic degradation47–52.
We showed that Atg8a and Atg7 mutant flies exhibit intestinal
hyperplasia that is predominantly controlled by a systemic
immune response produced by the fat body. This is in line with a
previous study showing that systemic inflammation caused by the
fat body leads to intestinal hyperplasia in old flies53. Despite the
fact that we observed a very modest upregulation of Diptericin in
isolated autophagy mutant guts we have observed nuclear
translocation of Relish in the midgut of Atg8a mutant flies. A
report by Erturk-Hasdemir et al.33 proposed that the IKK com-
plex is required both for the cleavage and phosphorylation of
Relish, the latter being responsible for the efficient upgregulation
of AMP genes. There is evidence however that Relish cleavage
alone may be enough to upregulate the expression of Diptericin
only54. Regulation of the IMD pathway is tissue-specific with its
various output molecules being favoured differently from one
tissue to another55. Nuclear translocation of Relish in Atg8a
mutants may lead to some level of Diptericin expression, however

 in the absence of infection this may in fact favor the expression of
the IMD pathway antagonist Pirk and prevent Relish phosphor-
ylation, which would have an overall negative effect on the local
production of AMPs56.
It has been reported that Atg9 but not Atg12 was required for
JNK-mediated intestinal hyperplasia in Drosophila under oxida-
tive stress conditions (paraquat feeding)57. However, in this study
knockdown of Atg9 or Atg12 was done tissue specifically in the
midgut, whereas our results are from full body mutants and
without paraquat feeding.
Interestingly we found that the mammalian homolog of Kenny,
IKKγ/NEMO, does not interact with any of the mammalian
Atg8-family members, so cannot be directly targeted for autop-
hagy by such interactions. There is evidence that IKK degradation
may be able to be triggered by proteins expressed by mammalian
pathogens. The bacterial effector geldanamycin, which is an
inhibitor of Hsp90, causes degradation of the IKK complex by
autophagy58. Murine cytomegalovirus M45 protein interacts with
NEMO, mediating its engulfement by the autophagosome and
subsequent degradation in the lysosome35. Analysis of the murine
cytomegalovirus M45 protein sequence with iLIR20 shows a
predicted functional LIR motif. It has also been shown that p47,
an essential factor for Golgi membrane fusion, associates with
NEMO upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-1 sti-
mulation, and inhibits IKK activation. p47 binds to NEMO and
mediates its lysosomal degradation59. Interestingly, Shp1, a yeast
homolog of p47, binds to ATG8 which is the yeast homolog of
LC3 and is required for the elongation of the nascent autopha-
gosome60. Altogether, these results suggest that there was a
switch during the evolution of the IKKγ protein in metazoans.
Drosophila IKKγ/Kenny can be directly and selectively degraded
by autophagy through its functional LIR motif. In contrast, the
targeting of mammalian IKKγ for autophagic degradation seems
to be mediated either by bacterial effectors (geldanamycin), viral
proteins (M45) or through putative selective autophagy receptors
(p47).
To investigate what kinds of interactions between hosts,
pathogens, and the microbiota could drive the loss of a LIR motif
from IKKγ, we developed a mathematical model in which the
mechanisms by which host IKKγ could be selectively targeted for
autophagic destruction varied. Hosts of different types competed
in the presence of pathogens and a proxy for the microbiota, and

 we investigated which selective processes caused one or another
host type to dominate the population. Our model highlighted two
potential mechanisms by which pathogen selection could drive
the loss of a LIR motif from IKKγ. The first assumes that hosts
which regulate IKKγ using ubiquitin tagging alone have the
lowest infection mortality, because they are best able to regulate
immunopathology during infection. The second mechanism
involves a specific reduction in infection mortality where patho-
gens encode their own LIR motifs, that only applies in hosts
which lack a LIR motif on IKKγ—in other words, pathogen
manipulation of the host using LIR motifs, which happens to
benefit both host and pathogen by reducing infection mortality.
For simplicity, our model pitted the four different host types
against one another, starting with each host type at an equal
frequency. This showed us which host type was best suited to a
particular set of selective pressures, but meant that each simula-
tion started with an evolutionarily unrealistic situation in which
equal numbers of hosts with or without the ability to regulate
IKKγ using ubiquitin tagging were present. In reality, evolving the
ability to regulate IKKγ using ubiquitin tagging must have
required a series of steps, including gaining appropriate selective
autophagy receptors, before this mechanism to regulate IKKγ
could have emerged. It is entirely plausible that pathogen selec-
tion was one of the selective pressures which made the evolution
of this machinery favorable—but our model does not explicitly
capture how the machinery evolved. Considering the severely
negative consequences of a complete inability to regulate IKKγ (as
captured by our experimental results), we can speculate that some

 alternative means to regulate IKKγ is a prerequisite before the LIR
motif can be lost from IKKγ, and thus that the ability to regulate
IKKγ using ubiquitin tagging in mammals may have evolved
before any loss of the LIR motif.
This point is particularly pertinent when considering the sec-
ond of the two evolutionary scenarios we found that could drive
the loss of LIR from IKKγ. In that scenario there is a specific
reduction in infection mortality where pathogens encoding their
own LIR motifs infect hosts which lack a LIR motif on IKKγ. We
considered this an important result to include, by way of showing
that pathogens with very particular properties could drive the
host to lose the LIR motif from IKKγ; however, reaching that
equilibrium point requires that there already exist some hosts in
the population for which there is not an excessive cost to losing
the LIR motif (i.e., hosts with some other mechanism to regulate
IKKγ, such as ubiquitin tagging). Only after such hosts lose their
LIR motifs can there be a niche for the pathogen with the
necessary properties to invade the population in the first place,
and drive the evolutionary switch whereby the entire host
population ends up losing the LIR motif from IKKγ.
The first of the evolutionary scenarios we proposed has less
restrictive conditions. If hosts which regulate IKKγ using
ubiquitin tagging alone have the lowest infection mortality,
because they are best able to regulate immunopathology during
infection, then selection from pathogens with or without LIR
motifs can drive a population to an equilibrium where the host
loses the LIR motif from IKKγ.
In conclusion, we have shown that autophagy plays a critical
role in the termination of innate immune signaling in response to
commensal microbiota in Drosophila by degrading Kenny and
ird5. We cannot exclude that other components of the IMD
pathway are also degraded by autophagy through interaction with
Atg8a or other autophagy-related proteins. Further studies are
awaited to clarify these questions. Our study highlights the phy-
siological importance of selective autophagy in the innate
immune response of metazoans, and demonstrates the plasticity
of its participating regulators. We propose that a major switch in
the regulation of IKKγ occurred during metazoan evolution, and
have shown how this switch could have been driven by host-
pathogen coevolution.
Methods
Fly husbandry and generation of transgenic lines. Flies used in experiments
were kept at 25 °C and 70% humidity raised on cornmeal based feed.
The following fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila
stock center: w1118 (#3605), UAS-Atg5-RNAi (#27551), and Cg-GAL4 (#7011).
UAS-Atg8a-RNAi (#109654) and UAS-key RNAi (#7723) were obtained from the
Vienna Drosophila Ressource Center. The following mutant lines have been used:
yw hs-FLP Atg8aKG07569, atg7Δ77, and atg7Δ14/CyO-GFP46 (gift from G. Juhasz),
key123 (gift from D. Ferrandon), yw hs-flp;FRT82 atg13Δ8161 and yw hs-flp;FRT80
atg1Δ3D62. For the mutant mosaic analysis (FLP/FTR and MARCM mitotic
recombination), the following lines were used: yw hs-flp;FRT82 Ubi::GFP and yw
hs-flp tub-Gal4 UAS-GFP; FRT80B tub-Gal80 hsc82 y+ (gift from Y. Fan). The
clonal analysis using the FLPout system have been performed with the following
lines: yw hs-flp Ac > CD2 > GAL4 UAS-GFP (gift from G. Juhasz) and yw hs-flp;
UAS-mCherry-Atg8a;Ac > CD2 > GAL4. The transgenic lines UAS-GFP-KennyWT,
UAS-GFP-KennyF7A/L10A and UAS-GFP-NEMO have been generated by cloning
the cDNA of Kenny or NEMO respectively into the pPGW plasmid (DGRC). The
transgenic line UAS-mCherry-ird5 has been generated by cloning the cDNA of ird5
into the pP(mCherry)W plasmid modified from the pPGW by replacing the
sequence coding for the GFP by mCherry. The transgenic line UAS-mCherry-GFP-
ird5 has been generated by cloning the cDNA of ird5 into the pP(mCherry)GW
plasmid modified from the pPGW backbone by adding the sequence coding for the
mCherry in 5′ of the GFP. Transgenic flies were generated by P-element-mediated
transformation (BestGene Inc). The genotype of the flies used for the experiments
displayed in Figs 2−8 are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Clonal analysis (FLP/FRT mosaic, MARCM, FLPout techniques). For the
generation of mutant clones in the larval fat body using the FLP/FRT (flippase
mediated site-specific recombination) and MARCM (Mosaic analysis with a
repressible cell marker) mitotic recombination techniques, embryos 0–10 h after
egg laying were subjected to heat shock for 1 h at 37 °C. For the FLPout UAS/GAL4
method, the GAL4 expressing cells were generated spontaneously without heat
shock25. L3 larvae at 4 days after egg laying were dissected.
Generation of axenic flies. Embryos were collected on apple juice plates for 10 h
and dechorionated in 2.7% bleach for 2 min, rinsed in 70% ethanol twice and then
in distilled water twice. Embryos were then transferred onto food containing a
cocktail of antibiotics. Larvae and adults were reared on autoclaved cornmeal
food, enriched with either 0.25 mg/mL ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and
1 mg/mL kanamycin. Axenic status of the flies was confirmed by CFU on LB
agar plates, with one full fly body smear per plate and 16 S PCR (forward primer:
5′-CAGGCCTAACACATGCAAGTC-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ACGGGCGGTGTG-
TACAAG-3′). At least 2 flies per stock tube were used to attest the axenic status of
the flies prior to experiment.
Bortezomib feeding. Adult flies were transferred within 24 h from hatching onto
Nutri-Fly Instant Drosophila Medium (Genesee Scientific, 66–117) prepared in
water supplemented with 5–20 µM Bortezomib or DMSO (max 0.2% final). Flies
were flipped into freshly made food every other day for 5−6 days.
Protein extraction, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting. Protein content
was extracted from the full fly body in TNT lysis buffer (40 mM Tris pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM Na4P2O7,
50 mM NaF + EDTA-free proteases inhibitors cocktail) using a motorized mortar
and pestle. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed on lysates from flies
expressing GFP alone or GFP-Kenny along with mCherry-ird5. After a 30 min
pre-clear of the lysates (1 mg total proteins) with sepharose-coupled G beads
(Sigma), the co-immunoprecipitation was performed for 2 h at 4 °C using an
anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, Ab290) and fresh sepharose-coupled G-beads. Four
consecutive washes with the lysis buffer were performed before suspension of the
beads in 60 µL 2X Laemmli loading buffer. For ubiquitination assay, lysates were
boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in TNT lysis buffer supplemented with 2% SDS final.
Denaturated lysates were then diluted in lysis buffer without SDS to reach a final
SDS concentration that does not exceed 0.2% prior to immunoprecipitation
overnight at 4 °C. In addition to the usual proteases inhibitor cocktail, the lysis
buffer was supplemented with the deubiquitinating enzymes specific inhibitor
PR-619. All protein samples (whole fly lysates and co-immunoprecipitation
eluates) were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Quantity of 10–40 μg of proteins (whole
fly lysates) or 20 µL (co-immunoprecipitation eluates) were loaded on acrylamide
gels and were transferred onto either nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (cold
wet transfer in 10% ethanol for 1 h at 100 V, or 2 h at 30 V for the detection of
ubiquitin chains).
Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA or non-fat milk in TBST (0.1% Tween-20
in TBS) for 1 h. Primary antibodies diluted in TBST were incubated overnight at
4 °C or for 3 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. HRP-coupled secondary
antibodies binding was done at room temperature (RT) for 45 min in 1% BSA or
non-fat milk dissolved in TBST and ECL mix incubation for 2 min. All washes were
performed for 10 min in TBST at RT.
The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Kenny23 (gift from
Dr N. Silverman, 1:5000), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz sc-9996, 1:1000), anti-mCherry
(Novus NBP1–96752, 1:2000), anti-alpha tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich T5168, 1:40,000),
anti-ubiquitinated proteins (clone FK2, Enzo Life Sciences BML-PW8810, 1:200),
anti-ubiquitin K48 specific (clone Apu2 Sigma-Aldrich 05–1307, 1:1000).
HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were from ThermoScientific (anti-mouse HRP
#31450; anti-rabbit HRP #31460). Following co-immunoprecipitation, Veriblot
HRP-coupled IP secondary antibody was used (Abcam ab131366, 1:5000).
The uncropped scan of the original films used to assemble the main figures are
available in Supplementary Fig. 17.
Dephosphorylation assay. Lysates from Atg8aKG and Atg7Δ14/Δ77 adult flies were
prepared in modified TNT buffer (40 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100 + EDTA-free proteases inhibitors cocktail). Dephosphorylation of 50 μg of
total protein was performed in 50 μL reaction volume (top up with ddH2O
supplemented with EDTA-free proteases inhibitors cocktail) in the presence of
either 10 U/µg proteins of CIP (Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; NEB, M0290S)
or 8 U/µg proteins of λPP (lambda protein phosphatase; NEB, P0753S) supple-
mented with their respective reaction buffers according to manufacturers’ protocol.
As negative control, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma, P5726) at 1:50 was
added to some reactions. All the samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min
before dilution in Laemmli buffer and heating for 10 min at 80 °C.
Immunohistochemistry. Fly tissues were dissected in PBS and fixed for 30 min in
4% formaldehyde. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in PBT
(0.3% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS). Primary and secondary antibodies were
incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBT. The following primary antibodies were
used: anti-Cathepsin-L (Abcam ab58991, 1:400), anti-GABARAP (Cell Signaling
Technology #13733, 1:400), anti-pH3 (Millipore #06-570, 1:1000), anti-Kenny23
(gift from Dr N. Silverman, 1:600), anti-Relish (#Abin1111036, RayBiotech
130-10080, 1:300). Specificity of the anti-Relish antibody was tested using

 Relish E20 mutants63 (Supplementary Fig. 18). Washes were performed in PBW
(0.1% Tween-20 in PBS). All images were acquired using Carl Zeiss LSM710 or
LSM880 confocal microscopes, using a ×63 Apochromat objective. Images were
post-processed in Fiji for co-localization studies.
Real-Time qPCR. RNA extraction was performed with a Life Technologies
Ambion PureLinkTM RNA Mini kit according to the manufacturer protocol. Ten
full adult flies or 50 isolated guts were used per extract. Males were preferentially
used, but due to the lack of male mutants for the double mutant flies Atg8a;key1,
only heterozygote females for Atg8a were used.
Subsequent steps were performed using 1 μg of total RNA. ThermoScientific
DNase I was used in order to digest genomic DNA. The ThermoScientific
RevertAid Kit was subsequently used to synthesize cDNA. RT-qPCR was
performed using the Promega GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (ref. A6002). Primer
sequences are available in Supplementary Table 2.
Lifespan measurement. In order to measure lifespan, males only were collected
within 24 h from hatching and cohorts of 20–25 flies were maintained on standard
or autoclaved/antibiotics-supplemented Drosophila food at 25 °C in a humidified
incubator. Flies were transferred into new tubes every 2–3 days. Dead events were
recorded daily. Axenic status of the flies was checked once a week. The statistical
analysis has been done with Prism7 software (GraphPad), using a Gehan-Breslow-
Wilcoxon test.
Plasmid constructs. Plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table 3. cDNAs were made using Transcriptor Universal cDNA Master (Roche
Applied Science, 05 893 151 001). PCR products were amplified from cDNA using
Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase with primers containing the Gateway
recombination site or restriction enzyme sites for Gateway entry vector and cloned
into pDONR221 or pENTR using Gateway recombination cloning. Plasmids were
made by conventional restriction enzyme-based cloning and/or by use of the
Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). Point-mutants were generated using
the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, 200523). Oligonucleotides
for mutagenesis, PCR and DNA sequencing were from Invitrogen or Sigma.
Plasmid constructs were verified by conventional restriction enzyme digestion and/
or by DNA sequencing with BigDye (Applied Biosystems, 4337455).
Cell culture and immunoprecipitation in Drosophila S2R cells. S2R+ cells
(DGRC, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) were cultured at 25 °C in Schnei-
der’s Drosophila medium (Gibco/Invitrogen, 21720-024) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin-penicillin (Sigma,
P4333). Subconfluent cells were transfected with plasmids using TransIT-2020
(Mirus, MIR5400) following the supplier’s instructions and analyzed 48 or 72 h
after transfection. For immunoprecipitation, S2R+ cells were washed 72 h after
transfection with ice-cold PBS prior to lysis in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.25% Triton X-100(v/v))
supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (Calbiochem) and Com-
plete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science,
11836170001). Lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma,
A2220) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed five times with 500 µl lysis buffer.
Proteins were eluted using 3XFLAG fusion peptide (Sigma, F4799), boiled in SDS-
PAGE loading buffer, and subjected to western blotting. The following antibodies
were used: mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene, 200471), rabbit polyclonal GFP
antibody (Abcam, Ab290).
GST Pull-down assays. GST-fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3) and/or SoluBL21 (Amsbio) and GST-fusion proteins were purified on
glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST pull-down
assays were performed using in vitro translated 35S-methionine-labelled proteins.
L-[35S]-methionine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A volume of 10
µL of the in vitro translation reaction products (0.5 µg of plasmid in a 25 µL
reaction volume) were incubated with 1–10 µg of GST-recombinant protein in 200
µL of NETN buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, 6 mM
EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol supplemented with Complete Mini
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h at 4 °C,
washed six times with 1 ml of NETN buffer, boiled with 2X SDS gel loading buffer,
and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and vacuum-
dried. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected on a Fujifilm bio-imaging analyzer BAS-
5000 (Fuji).
Double-tag analyses of DmKenny in HeLa cells. HeLa (ATCC CCL2) cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). Cultured HeLa cells were
maintained at 37 °C with 95% air and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. HeLa
cells were cultured in 8-well chambered coverslides (Nunc) and transiently
transfected with 100 ng of pDest-mCherry-eYFP-Kenny WT or F7A/L10A con-
structs and 50 ng of pDestMyc-DmAtg8a using TransIT-LT1. Cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde 24 h after transfection. Images were obtained using a Zeiss
LSM780 microscope. Quantifications of red only punctae per cell were done using
Volocity 6.3 software (PerkinElmer).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were done with Prism6/7 software (GraphPad). For
the comparison of two groups, two-tailed t-test was used. To compare three or
more groups, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test correction was used. Statistical
significance of fly survival was calculated using a log-rank Mantel-Cox test. The
statistical description for the results shown in Figs 2−8 are listed in Supplementary
Table 4.
Mathematical model. We combined epidemiological processes and host popula-
tion genetics in a single dynamical model to allow different host genotypes to
compete in the presence of various infectious agents. Epidemiological models
incorporating an evolving host have previously been used to address questions of
host-pathogen coevolution64. Our complete model is described by Eqs. 1–6, given
below. Hosts could be infected with three different types of microorganism: a proxy
for the microbiota, (M); a pathogen which does not express the LIR motif (P), and
an otherwise identical pathogen variant which does express the LIR motif (Q). We
assumed that coinfection between M and either P or Q was possible but that
coinfection between P and Q was not possible. Upon recovery from infection with
P or Q the host is once again susceptible to reinfection with P or Q. We allowed
there to exist four different host genotypes (1–4). Host genotypes 1 and 2 are
assumed to lack the ability to target IKKγ for autophagic degradation using a
ubiquitin tag; host genotypes 3 and 4 are assumed to possess this ability. IKKγ
carries a LIR motif in host genotypes 2 and 4 but not in host genotypes 1 and 3.
Infection with M is lifelong. Infection with P or Q has duration 1/σx,i, where σx,i
represents the recovery rate from infection with pathogen x for host genotype i. All
host genotypes experience a background death rate μ, making the average host
lifetime in the absence of infection = 1/μ. The cost of maintaining the necessary
molecular machinery to target IKKγ for autophagic degradation using ubiquitin
tagging is represented by an extra mortality rate γi, which depends on host
genotype i (where genotypes lacking this molecular machinery have γi = 0). Excess
mortality due to stimulation of the host immune response by the microbiota is
captured by the death rate θi, and excess mortality due to infection of host type i by
pathogen x is captured by rate ψxi.
The rate of change of numbers of susceptible hosts of genotype i (Si) is given by

When choosing the values of parameters, our purpose was not to simulate a
specific host and pathogen, but rather to investigate the types of selective pressure
that could potentially drive an evolutionary switch in LIR motif functionality. The
absolute values of any of our parameters are therefore less important than their
relative values.
Starting conditions for each simulation were always: 500 hosts of type 1, of
which 494 were uninfected, 1 was infected with pathogen P, 2 with pathogen Q and
3 with microbiota proxy M; 501 uninfected hosts of type 2; 502 uninfected hosts of
type 3 and 503 uninfected hosts of type 4. We used the solver ode15s in Matlab
R2015b to solve the system numerically and determine its behavior after 75,000
years.
In all simulations shown, the background death rate of the host (µ) was equal to
0.083 per month. The transmission parameter for the proxy for the microbiota
(βM) was set at 0.5. The transmission parameter for pathogen variant P (βP) was set
at 3.01 and the transmission parameter for pathogen variant Q (βQ) was set at 3,
meaning that, all other things being equal, producing a LIR motif is costly to the
pathogen and makes it slightly less likely to be transmitted. The cost of maintaining
pathways so that IKKγ could be targeted for autophagic degradation by ubiquitin
tagging was set at the arbitrary value of 0.0002 per months. This meant that γ1 and
γ2 = 0, while γ3 and γ4 = 0.0002. The cost of an uncontrolled innate immune
response to the microbiota was set at 0.1 per months, thus θ1 = 0.1 and θ2, θ3, and
θ4 = 0.
Effects I, II, IIIa, and IIIb described in the main text were applied in the model
by choosing specific values of parameters σx;i and ψxi. If no Effect is being applied,
all values of σx;i = 0.7 and all values of ψx;i = 0.015. The application of the different
effects can be considered in terms of changes to these baseline values, summarized
in the following paragraphs. All values of σx;i and ψx;i used in the simulations
shown are also provided fully in Supplementary Table 5.
Effect I reduces the mortality rates of hosts which regulate IKKγ using ubiquitin
tagging by a fixed value. For the results shown here, this reduction had a magnitude
of 0.005.
Effect II is similar to Effect I, but hosts regulating IKKγ using ubiquitin tagging
alone and hosts regulating IKKγ using both ubiquitin tagging and a LIR motif have
their infection mortality rates reduced by different fixed values. For the results
shown here hosts regulating IKKγ using ubiquitin tagging alone had an infection
mortality rate reduction of 0.005 and hosts regulating IKKγ using both ubiquitin
tagging and a LIR motif had an infection mortality rate reduction of 0.004.
Effect IIIa involves letting a pathogen expressed LIR motif slow the recovery
rate from infection in hosts that do not have a LIR motif on IKKγ. For the results
shown here, these specific recovery rates (σQ;1 and σQ;3) were given values of 0.6.
Effect IIIb involves reducing infection mortality by a fixed value (for the results
shown here this reduction had a magnitude of 0.005), in the specific instance where
the pathogen expresses a LIR motif and the host does not possess a LIR motif on
IKK gamma. For the results shown here, this reduction in infection mortality rate is
treated as independent to those of Effects I and II, and is added to them when the
different effects are combined together.

study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files.
