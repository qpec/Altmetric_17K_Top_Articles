Abstract
Despite extraordinary efforts to profile cancer genomes, interpreting the vast amount of genomic 
data in the light of cancer evolution remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that neutral tumor 
evolution results in a power-law distribution of the mutant allele frequencies reported by next-
generation sequencing of tumor bulk samples. We find that the neutral power-law fits with high 
precision 323 of 904 cancers from 14 types, selected from different cohorts. In malignancies 
identified as neutral, all clonal selection occurred prior to the onset of cancer growth and not in 
later-arising subclones, resulting in numerous passenger mutations that are responsible for intra-
tumor heterogeneity. Reanalyzing cancer sequencing data within the neutral framework allowed 
the measurement, in each patient, of both the in vivo mutation rate and the order and timing of 
mutations. This result provides a new way to interpret existing cancer genomic data and to 
discriminate between functional and non-functional intra-tumor heterogeneity.

Introduction
Unraveling the evolutionary history of a tumor is clinically valuable, as prognosis depends 
on the future course of the evolutionary process, and therapeutic response is determined by 
the evolution of resistant subpopulations1,2. In humans, the details of tumor evolution have 
remained largely uncharacterized as longitudinal measurements are impractical, and studies 
are complicated by inter-patient variation3 and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH)4,5. Several 
recent studies have begun tackling this complexity6, revealing patterns of convergent 
evolution7, punctuated dynamics8, and intricate interactions between cancer cell 
populations9. However, the lack of a rigorous theoretical framework able to make 
predictions on existing data10 means that results from cancer genomic profiling studies are 
often difficult to interpret. For example, how much of the detected intra-tumor heterogeneity 
is actually functional is largely unknown, also because a rigorous ‘null model’ of genomic 
heterogeneity is lacking. In particular, interpreting the mutant allele frequency distribution 
reported by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is problematic because of the absence of a 
formal model linking tumor evolution to the observed data. Therefore, making sense of the 
wealth of available sequencing data in cancer remains challenging.
Here we show that the subclonal mutant allele frequencies of a significant proportion of 
cancers of different types and from different cohorts precisely follow a simple power-law 
distribution predicted by neutral growth. In those neutral cancers, all tumor-driving 
alterations responsible for cancer expansion were present in the first malignant cell and 
subsequent tumor evolution was effectively neutral. We demonstrate that under neutral 
growth, the fundamental parameters describing cancer evolution that have been so far 
inaccessible in human tumors, such as the mutation rate and the mutational timeline, become 
measurable. Importantly, this approach allows identifying also non-neutral malignancies, in 
which ongoing clonal selection and adaption to microenvironmental niches may play a 
strong role during cancer growth.
Results
Neutral cancer growth
Recently, we showed that colorectal cancers (CRC) often grow as a single expansion, 
populated by a large number of intermixed subclones11. Consequently, we expect that after 
malignant transformation, individual subclones with distinct mutational patterns grow at 
similar rates, coexisting within the tumor for long periods of time without overtaking one 
another. Moreover, only a handful of recurrent driver alterations have been identified in 
CRC12, and those are reported to be ubiquitous in multi-region sampling11 and stable 
during cancer progression13, indicating that they all occurred in the “first” cancer cell and

 that subsequent clonal outgrowths are relatively rare. Consequently, we hypothesized that 
cancer evolution may often be dominated by neutral evolutionary dynamics.
The dynamics of neutral evolutionary processes have been widely studied in the context of 
molecular evolution and population genetics14–16 as well as in mouse models of cancer17. 
However, the widely held presumption that subclone dynamics in human cancers are 
dominated by strong selection has meant these ideas have been neglected in current studies 
of cancer evolution.
Motivated by this, here we present a theoretical model describing the expected pattern of 
subclonal mutations within a tumor that is evolving according to neutral evolutionary 
dynamics. The model postulates that, after the accumulation of a “full house” of genomic 
changes that initiates tumor growth, some tumors expand neutrally, generating a large 
number of passenger mutations that are responsible for the extensive and common ITH. The 
parameter-free model is applicable to NGS data from any solid cancer. Here we present the 
model, and by applying it to large pre-existing cancer genomics datasets, determine which 
tumors are consistent with neutral growth. When the model applies, we measure new tumor 
characteristics directly from the patient’s data.
Model derivation
A cancer is founded by a single cell that has already acquired a significant mutation 
burden3: these “pre-cancer” mutations will be borne by every cell in the growing tumor, and 
so become “public” or clonal. Mutations that occur within different cell lineages remain 
“private” or subclonal in an expanding malignancy under the absence of strong selection. 
Here we focus on subclonal mutations as they contain information on the dynamics of the 
cancer growth. We denote the number of tumor cells at time t as N(t), with cells dividing at 
rate λ per unit time. During a cell division, somatic mutations occur at rate μ. If we consider 
an average number of π chromosome sets in a cancer cell (e.g. the ploidy of the cell), we 
can calculate the expected number of new mutations per time interval as:
[1]
Solving this requires integrating over the growth function N(t) in some time interval [t0,t]:
[2]
Since not all cell divisions may be successful in generating two surviving lineages due to 
cell death or differentiation, we introduce the fraction β of “effective” cell divisions in which 
both resulting lineages survive. In the case of exponential growth, the mean number of tumor 
cells as a function of time is therefore:
Williams et al.

 [3]
Substituting into equation [2] gives the explicit solution:
[4]
This equation describes the total number of subclonal mutations that accumulate within a 
growing tumor in the time interval [t0, t] . We note that for t0=0 equation [4] corresponds to 
the Luria-Delbrück model, which describes mutation accumulation in bacteria18. In our 
case, this equation is of limited use as none of the parameters μ, λ, β or the age of the tumor 
t can be measured directly in humans. However, we do know that for a new mutation 
occurring at any time t, its allelic frequency (the relative fraction) f must be the inverse of the 
number of alleles in the population:
[5]
For example, if a new mutation arises in a tumor of 100 cells, it will comprise a fraction of 
1/100. In the absence of clonal selection (or indeed significant genetic drift), the allelic 
frequency of a mutation will remain constant during the expansion, as all cells, with and 
without this mutation, grow at the same rate. In the previous example, after one generation 
has elapsed, we will have 2 cells with that particular mutation, but a total of 200 tumor cells, 
again a fraction of 1/100. This implies that in the neutral case, tumor age t and mutation 
frequency f are interchangeable. For example, t0=0 in a diploid tumor (π=2), corresponds to 
fmax=0.5 (the expected allelic frequency of clonal variants):
[6]
Substituting t for f in equation [4] gives an expression for the cumulative number of 
mutations in the tumor per frequency M(f):
[7]
thus converging to the solution for expanding populations under neutrality obtained using 
other approaches19–22. Critically, the distribution M(f) is naturally provided by NGS data 
from bulk sequencing of tumor biopsies and resections, against which the model can be 
tested. The model predicts that mutations arising during a neutral expansion of a cancer 
accumulate following a 1/f power-law distribution. In other words, when neutral evolution

 occurs in a tumor, the number of mutations detected should accumulate linearly with the 
inverse of their frequency. The 1/f noise or pink noise is common in nature and found in 
several physical, biological and economic systems23.
Importantly, the coefficient μe=μ/β is the mutation rate per effective cell division, and 
corresponds to the easily measureable slope of M(f). This model therefore provides a 
straightforward parameter-free method to measure the in vivo mutation rate in a patient’s 
tumor using a single NGS sample. We note that the results do not depend on the identity of 
the alterations considered, since any genomic alteration (mutations, copy number changes or 
epigenetic modifications) anywhere in the genome that changes the dynamics of tumor 
growth (e.g. any alteration that is clonally selected) would result in deviation from the 
neutral 1/f power-law by causing an over- or under-representation of the alleles in that clone. 
Hence, here we use single nucleotide variants as ‘barcodes’ to follow clone growth. 
Stochastic simulations of neutral tumor growth confirm the analytical solution in equation 
[7] (see Online Methods).
Identification of neutrality in colorectal cancer evolution
A typical allelic frequency distribution of mutations in a tumor measured by NGS whole-
exome sequencing is shown in Figure 1A (data from ref11). Considering tumor purity and 
aneuploidy, mutations with high allelic frequency (>0.25) are likely to be public (clonal) 
while all others are likely subclonal. The same data can be represented as the cumulative 
distribution M(f) of subclonal mutations as in equation [7] (Figure 1B). Remarkably, as 
reported by the high goodness-of-fit measure R2, these data precisely follow the distribution 
predicted by the model, indicating that this tumor grew under neutral evolutionary dynamics.
We next considered our cohort of 7 multi-sampling CRCs11 and 101 TCGA colon 
adenocarcinomas12 selected for high tumor purity (≥70%) that underwent whole-exome 
sequencing (see Online Methods). The latter were separated between tumors characterized 
by chromosomal instability (CIN) versus microsatellite instability (MSI). The power-law is 
remarkably well supported in both these cohorts, with 38/108 (35.1%) of the cases reporting 
a high R2≥0.98 (Figure 1C). These results confirm that in a large proportion of colon 
cancers, intra-tumor clonal dynamics are not dominated by strong selection but rather follow 
neutral evolution. In particular, a larger proportion of CIN cancers evolved neutrally (31/82, 
37.8%) with respect to MSI cancers (3/19, 15.7%) (Figure 1C), possibly because the latter 
acquired so many new mutations that some are likely under strong selection. Since M(f) is a 
monotonic growing function, this stringent threshold of R2≥0.98 was chosen to prevent over-
calling neutrality, but we note that we may have therefore misclassified some tumors as non-
neutral due to limited sequencing depth or low mutation burden. R2 values were independent 
from the mean coverage of mutations, the total number of mutations in the sample or the 
number of mutations within the model range (see Online Methods). See Supplementary Data 
Set 1 for summary of TCGA data used.
Measurement of the mutation rate in colorectal cancer
Estimating the per-base mutation rate μ per division in human malignancies is challenging 
since direct measurements are not possible. Previous estimates critically depend on 
Williams et al.

 assumptions about the cell cycle time and the growth rate λ, as well as on the total 
mutational burden of the cancer24–26. However, accurate measurement of all mutations 
within a cancer, including heterogeneous subclonal variants, is technically unfeasible since 
most mutations are present in very small numbers of cells4. With our approach it is possible 
to circumvent this issue by measuring the rate of accumulation of subclonal mutations 
represented by the slope of M(f). In the case of neutral evolution, this can be done in 
principle within any (subclonal) frequency range, without the need of detecting extremely 
rare mutations. We estimated the mutation rate in all samples with R2≥0.98 (Figure 1D) and 
found that it was more than 15-fold higher in the MSI group (median: μe=3.65×10-6) with 
respect to the CIN group (median: μe=2.31×10-7; F-test: p=2.24×10-8) and our cohort of 
CRCs (median: μe=2.07×10-7), which was comprised of all but one CIN tumors11. Different 
mutational types (e.g. transitions or transversions) are caused by particular mutational 
processes27, and so likely occur at different rates and accordingly we found that C>T 
mutations occurred at median μe,C>T=2.19×10-7, a rate nearly 10-fold higher than any other 
type of mutation (F-test: p=3.13×10-3; Supplementary Figure 1A). We stratified according to 
CIN versus MSI and found that the mutation rate of each mutational type reflected the 
overall mutation rate for the group (Supplementary Figure 1B). The variation in mutation 
rates within and between subgroups was remarkably in line with the variation in estimates of 
mutational burden in colon cancer3. We note the mutation rate estimate is scaled by the 
(unknown) effective division rate β, which means for example that if only 1 in 100 cell 
divisions leads to two surviving offspring (β=0.01), then the mutation rate μ is 100 times 
lower than the effective rate μe reported. Importantly, mutation rates of non-neutral cases 
(R2<0.98) cannot be estimated, as the model does not fit the dynamics of these tumors.
We examined the effect of copy-number changes in the model by performing the analysis 
using only mutations in diploid regions and found highly similar proportions of neutral 
tumors and mutation rates (see Online Methods and Supplementary Figure 2). The validity 
of the variant calls was also corroborated by the consistency of the underlying mutational 
signature across a range of allelic frequencies; hence the results are unlikely to be influenced 
by sequencing errors (Supplementary Figure 3).
Frequent selection events should induce a higher number of missense and nonsense 
mutations than expected by chance whereas under neutrality we expect the same rate of 
silent and non-silent mutations. To test this, we contrasted the estimated rate of synonymous 
mutations (unlikely to ever be under selection) versus the rate of missense and nonsense 
mutations (liable to experience selection). Although the latter are more common than the 
former, after adjustment for the number of potential synonymous and nonsynonymous sites 
in the exome, the two rates were equivalent (Supplementary Figure 4), consistently with 
neutral evolution.
Neutral evolution in coding and non-coding regions
We next tested whether the signature of neutral evolution could be detected across the entire 
genome, not just in coding regions. To do this, we analyzed 78 gastric cancers from a recent 
study28 subjected to high depth whole-genome sequencing. The large number of mutations 
detected by WGS accumulated precisely as predicted by the model (example in Figure 
Williams et al.

 2A,B), revealing neutral evolution in 60/78 (76.9%) cases (Figure 2C). A smaller proportion 
of MSI tumors were neutral (3/10, 30%) than microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (57/68, 
83.8%), in line with the observation in CRC. A tumor was consistently classified as neutral 
independently of whether all SNVs or only non-coding SNVs were used to perform the 
classification (Figure 2C, Venn diagram), whereas due to the limited number of mutations 
available in the exome alone, fewer tumors were identified as neutral. Importantly, every 
case was verified as neutral by at least two different variant sets. These results confirm that 
neutral evolution can be robustly assessed from mutations anywhere in the genome.
Mutation rate analysis of the neutrally evolved gastric cancers showed that cancers with MSI 
had a more than fourfold higher mutation rate (μe=3.30×10-6) with respect to MSS 
(μe=7.82×10-7; F-test: p=1.35×10-4) (Figure 2D). Results were robust to copy number 
changes when the analysis was performed only using variants in diploid regions 
(Supplementary Figure 5). The mutational signature of the variant calls for this cohort was 
also consistent across the frequency spectrum (Supplementary Figure 6). Synonymous 
versus nonsynonymous mutation rates were also consistent with neutral evolution 
(Supplementary Figure 7). See Supplementary Data Set 2 for summary of Wang et al. data 
used.
Neutral evolution across cancer types
We then applied the neutral model to a large pan-cancer cohort of 819 exome-sequenced 
cancers from 14 tumor types from the TCGA consortium (which included the 101 colon 
cancers previously examined). All of these samples had been pre-selected for high tumor 
purity (≥70%). The fit of the model was remarkably good across types (Figure 3A) with 
259/819 (31.6%) cases showing R2≥0.98. We found that neutral evolution was more 
prominent in some tumor types, such as stomach (validating the WGS analysis), lung, 
bladder, cervical, and colon. Others showed a consistently poorer fit, indicating that the 
clonal dynamics in these malignancies were typically not neutral, such as in renal, 
melanoma, pancreatic, thyroid, and glioblastoma. Consistent with these results, “non-
neutral” renal carcinoma has been shown to display convergent evolution in spatially 
disparate tumor regions driven by strong selective forces7, whereas the same phenomenon 
was not found in more “neutral” lung cancer29,30. Other types displayed mixed dynamics, 
with some cases that were characterized by neutral evolution and some that were not. We 
note that a proportion of melanoma samples in this cohort are derived from regional 
metastases and not primary lesions, and this could potentially explain the lack of neutral 
dynamics observed.
Mutation rate analysis on the neutral cases showed differences of more than an order of 
magnitude between types (Figure 3B). The highest mutation rates were observed in lung 
adenocarcinoma (median μe=6.79×10-7) and in lung squamous cell carcinoma (median 
μe=5.61×10-7) and the lowest rates in low grade glioma (median μe=9.22×10-8) and in 
prostate (median μe=1.04×10-7). We stratified the mutation rates into different mutational 
types (Supplementary Figure 8) and found that C>A mutations occurred at a significantly 
higher rate in lung cancers, consistent with their causation by tobacco smoke27. C>T 
mutation rates were most consistent across cancer types, likely because of their association

 with replicative errors, as opposed to being caused by a particular stochastically-arising 
defect in DNA replication or repair27.
These results demonstrate that within-tumor clonal dynamics can be neutral, and the 
classification of tumors based on neutral versus non-neutral growth dynamics leads to new 
measurements of fundamental tumor biology. See See Supplementary Data Set 1 for 
summary of TCGA data used.
In silico validation of the neutral model
To assess the different inherent sources of noise in NGS data (normal contamination, limited 
sequencing depth, tumor sampling), we designed a stochastic simulation of neutral growth 
that produced synthetic NGS data from bulk samples (see Online Methods). The simulations 
produced realistic synthetic NGS data (Supplementary Figure 9) with minimal assumptions 
and under a range of different scenarios for tumor growth dynamics (variable low mutation 
rate, variable number of clonal mutations) and sources of assay noise (normal contamination 
in the sample, sequencing depth, detection limit). For each of these potentially confounding 
factors, we were able to fit our neutral model to the synthetic NGS data and accurately 
recover both the underlying neutral dynamics and the mutation rate (Supplementary Figure 
10). We also validated the prediction that M(f) would deviate from the neutral power-law in 
the presence of emerging subclones with a higher fitness advantage (Supplementary Figure 
11A,B), as well as in the case of a mixture of subclones (as observed in ref.31) emerging 
either by means of clonal expansions triggered by selection, or by segregating 
microenvironmental niches (Supplementary Figure 11C-F). Variation of mutation rate 
between subclones also causes a deviation from neutrality (Supplementary Figure 11G,H). 
These results confirm the reliability of the conservatively high R2 threshold used to call 
neutrality.
Mutational timelines
Under neutral evolution, it is possible to estimate the size of the tumor when a mutation with 
frequency f arose from equation [5]:
[8]
Figure 4A,B shows the decomposition of the mutational timeline for two illustrative cases: 
sample TB from11 and sample TCGA-AA-3712 from12. Previous estimates of mutational 
timelines relied on cross-sectional data32–35, which are compromised by the extensive 
heterogeneity, whereas multi-region profiling approaches are instead more accurate but 
expensive and laborious7,36,37. Using our formal model of cancer evolution, the timeline 
information becomes accessible from routinely available genomic data. We found that 
classical CRC driver alterations, such as in the APC, KRAS and TP53 genes, were indeed 
present in the first malignant cell (likely because they accumulated during previous 
neoplastic stages). This confirms what we previously reported using single-gland mutational 
profiling where all these drivers, when present, were found in all glands11. However, we

 also found that when we considered a more extended list of putative drivers, many occurred 
during the neutral phase of tumor growth, suggesting that the selective advantage conferred 
by a putative driver alteration may be context-dependent, as demonstrated in a p53 murine 
model38.
Discussion
Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of subclones within human cancers is challenging 
because longitudinal observations are unfeasible and the genetic landscape of cancer is 
highly dynamic, leading to genomic data that are hard to interpret39. In particular, complex 
non-linear evolutionary trajectories have been observed, such as punctuated evolution and 
karyotypic chaos8,39,40. Here we have presented a formal law that predicts mutational 
patterns routinely reported in NGS of bulk cancer specimens. Our analysis of large 
independent cohorts using this framework shows that cancer growth is often dominated by 
neutral evolutionary dynamics, an observation that is consistent across 14 cancer types. 
Under neutrality, the clonal structure of a tumor is expected to have a fractal topology 
characterized by self-similarity (Figure 5). As the tumor grows, a large number of cell 
lineages are generated and therefore ITH rapidly increases while the allele frequency of the 
new heterogeneous mutations quickly decreases due to the expansion. This implies that 
sampling in different parts of the tree leads to the detection of distinct mutations which all 
show the same 1/f distribution. Clonal mutations found in a sample (not considered in the 
model) belong to the most recent common ancestor in the tree.
We note that some cancers were dominated by neutral evolution whereas others were not. In 
non-neutral tumors, strong selection, microenvironmental constrains and non-cell 
autonomous effects41 may play a key role. Importantly, this formalization represents the 
‘null model’ of cancer intra-clone heterogeneity that can be used to identify those cases in 
which complex non-neutral dynamics occur, and to discriminate between functional and 
non-functional intra-tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, we speculate that neutral 
evolutionary dynamics may be favored by the cellular architecture of the tumor (e.g. 
glandular structures that limit the effects of selection) and/or the anatomical location of the 
malignancy (e.g. growing in a lumen versus growing in a highly confined space), as well as 
the presence of potentially selective microenvironmental features of the tumor such as 
hypoxic regions. Despite the evidence for lack of natural selection during malignant growth, 
eventual treatment is likely to “change the rules of the game” and strongly select for 
treatment resistant clones42. Treatment-resistance driver alterations that were not under 
selection during growth may expand due to new selective pressures introduced by therapy. 
The same may happen in the context of the purported evolutionary bottleneck preceding 
metastatic dissemination. Importantly, this reasoning highlights how ‘drivers’ can only be 
defined within a context, and so the same ‘driver’ alteration can be neutral in a certain 
microenvironmental context (e.g. absence of treatment), and not neutral in another (e.g. 
during treatment). Moreover, we predict that if a tumor is characterized by different 
microenvironmental niches but still presents as neutral, it is likely that adaptation will be 
driven by cancer cell plasticity, rather than clonal selection. Cell plasticity is hard to study in 
cancer because it implies a change in the cell phenotype that is not caused by any inheritable 
variation (genomic or epigenomic). This means that this phenomenon has been so far largely 
Williams et al.

 neglected in cancer. As neutrality can be used as the ‘null model’ with which to identify 
clonal selection, this facilitates the study of adaptation through plasticity directly in human 
malignancies. Furthermore, it is important to note that due to the intrinsic detection limits of 
sequencing technologies, it is possible to explore only the early expansion of cancer clones 
(Figure 5) and the dynamics of extremely small clones may remain undetected.
Importantly, the realization that the within-tumor clonal dynamics are neutral means that the 
in vivo mutation rate per division and the mutational timeline, factors that play a key role in 
cancer evolution, progression and treatment resistance can be inferred without the need to 
assume cell division rates. These measurements can be performed in a patient-specific 
manner and so may be useful for prognostication and the personalization of therapy. 
Recognizing that the growth of a neoplasm is dominated by neutral dynamics provides an 
analytically tractable and rigorous method to study cancer evolution and gain clinically 
relevant insight from commonly available genomic data.

Data analysis
The processing of exome-sequencing data from1 and TCGA2 involved variant calling on 
matched-normal pairs using Mutect3. A mutation was considered if the depth of coverage 
was ≥10 and at least 3 reads supported the variant. Mutations that aligned to a more than one 
genomic location were discarded. The WGS gastric cancers4 were processed using 
VarScan25, with minimum depth of coverage for a mutation being 10x and at least 3 reads 
supporting the variant. Non-CRCs in the TCGA had mutations called using Mutect 
according to the pipeline described in ref6. Microsatellite instability in the TCGA colon 
cancer samples was called using MSIsensor7. Annotation was performed with ANNOVAR8.
To fit the neutral model to allele frequency data we considered only variants with allele 
frequency in the range [fmax,fmin] corresponding to [t0,t] in equation [2]. The low boundary 
fmin reflects the limit for the reliable detectability of low-frequency mutations in NGS data, 
which is in the order of 10%3. The high boundary fmax is necessary to filter out public 
mutations that were present in the first transformed cell. In the case of diploid tumors, clonal 
mutations are expected at fmax=0.5 (mutations with 50% allelic frequency are heterozygous 
public or clonal), in the case of triploid tumors, this threshold drops to 0.33 and in the case 
of tetraploid neoplasms, it drops to 0.25. For all samples we used a boundary of [0.12-0.24] 
to account only for reliably called subclonal mutations and tumor purity in the samples. All 
the samples considered in this study were reported to have tumor purity ≥70% and a 
minimum of 12 reliably called private mutations within the fit boundary. Once these 
conditions were met in a sample, equation [7] was used to perform the fit as illustrated in 
Figure 1B and 2B. In particular, for x=1/f, equation [7] becomes a linear model with slope 
μ/β and intercept –μ/(β fmax). We exploited the intercept constraint to perform a more 
restrictive fit using the model y=m(x-1/fmax)+0.
Copy-number changes (allelic deletion or duplication) can alter the frequency of a variant in 
a manner that is not described by equation [7]. We assessed the impact of copy-number 
alterations (CNAs) on our estimates of the mutation rate within the TCGA colorectal cancer

 samples by using the paired publically available segmented SNP-array data to exclude 
somatic mutations that fell within regions of CNA. CNAs were identified having an absolute 
log-R-ratio>0.5, and the model fitting was performed only on diploid regions of the genome. 
In the gastric cancer cohort, regions with copy number changes were identified using 
Sequenza9 and removed from the analysis. Mutation rates were adjusted to the size of the 
resulting diploid genome. Supplementary Figures 2 and 5 demonstrate the robustness of our 
analysis to copy number changes. R2 values were independent from the mean coverage of 
mutations (p=0.32), the total number of mutations in the sample (p=0.40), the mutation rate 
(p=0.11), or the number of mutations within the model range (p=0.65).
Stochastic Simulation of Tumor Growth
To further validate our analytical model and to test the robustness to the noise in NGS data, 
we developed a stochastic simulation of tumor growth and accumulation of mutations that 
allowed us to generate synthetic datasets. The model was written and analyzed in the Julia 
programming language (http://julialang.org/). We then applied the analytical model to the 
simulated data to confirm that sources of noise in NGS data do not considerably impact our 
results. In particular, we verified that we could reliably extract input parameters of the 
simulation (namely the mutation rate) from “noisy” synthetic data. Confounding factors in 
the data include normal contamination, sampling effects, the detection limit of NGS 
mutation calling, and variable read depth. We simulate a tumor using a branching process 
with discrete generations, beginning with a single “transformed” cancer cell that gives rise to 
the malignancy. Under exponential growth, the population at time t will be given by:
[9]
Where R is the average number of offspring per cell and the time t is in units of generations. 
We will consider primarily the case when R=2 (a cell always divides into 2), but we will also 
consider values <2, noting that R must be greater than 1 to have growth. At each division, 
cells acquire new mutations at a rate µ and we assume every new mutation is unique (infinite 
sites approximation). The number of mutations acquired by a newborn cell at division is a 
random number drawn from a Poisson distribution. Each cell in the population is defined by 
its mutations and its ancestral history (by recording it’s parent cell). Using this information 
we can then reconstruct the history of the whole tumor and crucially, calculate the variant 
allele frequency of all mutations in the population. To relate the discrete simulation to the 
continuous analytical model we will now re-derive equation [7] within the context of our 
model. As we simulate a growing tumor using discrete generations, both the mutation rate µ 
and per capita growth rate λ=ln(R) are in units of generations. For an offspring probability 
distribution P=(p0,p1,p2) where pk=P(# of OFFSPRING = k) where, the average number of 
offspring R is simply given by the expected value of P:
[10]
Williams et al.

 For example, for R=2 we have P=(p0=0,p1=0,p2=1). By choosing different offspring 
probability distributions we can easily modulate the growth rate. We note that we are now 
expressing both μ and λ as rates per generation rather than probabilities (all rates are scaled 
by units of generation). This allows us to write the growth function as N(t)=exp(λt) with 
λ=ln(R). Proceeding as in the main text, our cumulative number of mutations with an allelic 
frequency f is therefore:
[11]
Therefore, when fitting the model to our stochastic simulation we extract μ/λ from the linear 
fit, making it straightforward to compare the simulation with the analytical model.
NGS data only captures a small fraction of the variability in a tumor, as the resolution is 
often limited to alleles with frequency >10% due to sequencing depth and limitations in 
mutation calling. To account for this, we employ a multistage sampling scheme in our 
simulations. For all simulations reported here we grow the tumor to size 1,024 cells, which 
gives a minimum allele frequency of ~0.1%, considerably smaller than the 10% attainable in 
next generation sequencing data. After growing the tumor and calculating the VAF for all 
alleles, we take a sample of the alleles in the population, noting that we are assuming the 
population is well mixed and has no spatial structure. We can vary the percentage of alleles 
we sample, thus allowing us to investigate the effect of the depth of sequencing on our 
results. As we know the true allelic frequency in the simulated population, we can use the 
multinomial distribution to produce a sample of the “sequenced” alleles, where the 
probability of sampling allele i is proportional to its frequency. The probability mass 
function is given by:
[12]
where xi is the sampled frequency of allele i, n is the number of trials (the chosen percentage 
of alleles sampled) and pi is the probability of sampling allele i (which has frequency ρi in 
the original population):
[13]
The variant allele frequency VAF is therefore given by:
[14]
Williams et al.
Page 12
Nat Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 01.
 Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

 Where Ni is the total number of sampled cells from which every sampled allele is derived. 
As we are assuming a constant mutation rate μ, we can assume that the percentage of alleles 
sampled comes from an equivalent percentage of cells. However, to include an additional 
element of noise that resembles the variability of read depth, we calculate a new Ni for each 
allele i, which approximates the read depth. For a desired “sequencing” depth D we calculate 
the corresponding percentage of the population we need to sample that will give us our 
desired depth. For example, for a desired depth of 100X from a population of 1,000 cells, we 
would need to sample 10% of the population. To include some variability in depth across all 
alleles we use Binomial sampling so that Ni is a distribution with mean D.
Contamination from non-tumor cells in NGS results in variant allele frequencies being 
underestimated. To include this effect in our simulation we can modify our Ni by an 
additional fraction ε, the percentage of normal contamination. Our VAF calculation thus 
becomes:
We also include a detection limit in our sampling scheme, we only include alleles that have 
an allelic frequency greater than a specified limit in the original tumor population.
To include the effects of selection in the simulation we introduce a second population, where 
on average each cell has a greater number of offspring than the first population. To model 
this, our second population has a modified offspring probability distribution: the previous 
offspring probability distribution was P=(p0,p1,p2), and the offspring probability distribution 
of our second fitter population is defined as Q=(q0,q1,q2), where q2>p2. The selective 
advantage of a population – s, will be given by the ratio of the expected number of offspring:
Therefore given P, and a desired selective advantage s we can easily calculate the offspring 
probability distribution of a fitter clone – Q.
Previous studies have detected the presence of mixtures of subclones in breast cancer 
samples that emerged by means of clonal expansions, thus generating multiple subclonal 
clusters in the data10. We also used our computational model of NGS data to produce 
similar synthetic data by means of mixing of different clonal clusters and verified that in this 
scenario (a model of differential selective pressure across subclones), the power law does not 
hold. The simulation code is available at https://github.com/andreasottoriva/neutral-tumor-
evolution.
Simulation Results
From the simulated data we produced histograms of the allelic frequency and calculated 
M(f) in order to fit the analytical model. We used the same frequency range as applied to

 empirical data [fmax,fmin] = [0.12,0.24]. Supplementary Figure 9A and B shows equivalent 
plots to Figures 1A and B but with simulated data. These demonstrate that we are able to 
accurately model the allelic distribution of NGS data with our simple neutral model of tumor 
growth. We also show the effect of a low mutation rate (Supplementary Figure 9C), a large 
number of clonal mutations (Supplementary Figure 9D), 30% contamination in the sample 
(Supplementary Figure 9E) and a low detection limit (Supplementary Figure 9F). 
Importantly, by fitting the analytical model to the simulated data, we can recover the input 
mutation rate with high accuracy (Supplementary Figure 9G, 10,000 equivalent simulations). 
The mean percentage error from the fit is 1.1%. We also see uniformly high R2 values across 
all simulations (Supplementary Figure 9H).
To test the robustness of the model to the number of clonal mutations, the detection limit and 
the amount of normal contamination we ran 10,000 simulations across the spectrum of these 
parameters. Supplementary Figures 10A-B show that we accurately recover (to within 15%) 
the mutation rate for 95% of simulations across different numbers of clonal mutations and 
different detection limits. Differently, we found that levels of normal contamination above 
30% considerably impact the parameter estimations of the model, hence our decision of only 
considering samples with ≥70% of tumor content (Supplementary Figure 10C). Indeed, 
when normal contamination is above 30%, the clonal peak in the allelic frequency 
distribution interferes significantly with our chosen cumulative sum limit (fmax = 0.24), thus 
impacting our results. Nevertheless, the estimates are within a factor 2 for normal 
contamination of up to 50%, which we consider an acceptable level of accuracy. When we 
consider normal contamination ε directly within our analytical model, the allelic fraction of 
a new mutation becomes:
[15]
And consequently, M(f) is:
[16]
Showing that normal contamination alters the measurement of mutation by a factor of 1/
(1+ε): much lower than one order of magnitude. Furthermore, if normal contamination can 
be estimated accurately from histopathological scoring or from reliable bioinformatics tools, 
we would be able to correct the frequency of variants in the data and thus rescue our ability 
to correctly estimate parameters with up to 40-45% normal contamination (Supplementary 
Figure 10D). We also tested the model with varying read depths and mutation rates. We find 
that either a low mutation rate or low read depth resulted in a higher proportion of poor 
model fits (R2<0.98) and inaccurate or higher variance in mutation estimates 
(Supplementary Figures 10E-H). It is therefore possible that due to our stringent neutrality 
criteria that the true proportion of tumors that are dominated by neutral dynamics is higher 
than reported, and relatedly our gastric cancer cohort covers the whole genome (greater

 mutation rate per division) and has mean depth of coverage >90X which may explain in part 
why we see a greater proportion of gastric cancers classified as neutral.
Additionally, we tested the model with simulations using a range of different probability 
distributions for the number of surviving offspring at each cell division. We simulated a 
growing tumor 10,000 times with 5 different offspring probability distributions and then 
reported the distributions of the fitted parameters. Supplementary Figures 10I-J show that as 
λ decreases the distribution of mutation estimates becomes wider and we see an increase in 
poorly fitted models (larger number of R2<0.98). Again this suggests that tumor growth may 
still be neutral even when we classify a tumor as non-neutral due to a poor R2 value. Hence 
our underestimation of the number of neutral cases may be largely due to a low proportion 
of cells that successfully produce 2 viable offspring (the β term in equation [7]), rather than 
the presence of selection.
By introducing a second fitter population early during tumor growth we show that the fitter 
clone causes an overrepresentation of variants at high frequency compared to what we would 
expect from our “null” model of neutral tumor growth. This causes the cumulative 
distribution to bend and deviate from the linear relationship predicted by neutral growth, as 
shown in Supplementary Figures 11A-B. This is because an overrepresentation of variants at 
high frequency, as compared to what we would expect from our “null” model, is caused by 
the clonal selection of the fitter clone, but we note that we do not know what caused this 
increase (it could be a point mutation, chromosomal aberration or a change in environmental 
pressures for example). In other words, some passenger mutations are just in the “right clone 
at the right time” and become overrepresented in the tumour when that “right” clone 
expands.
We also show that having multiple subclones that arose by means of clonal expansion, thus 
producing multiple clonal ‘clusters’, produces a deviation from the linear relationship we 
predict (Supplementary Figures 11C-F), as does having a marked increase in the mutation 
rate early in tumour growth (Supplementary Figures 11G,H).

 Figure 1. Neutral evolution is common in colon cancer and allows the measurement of mutation 
rates in each tumor.
(A) The output of NGS data, such as whole-exome sequencing, can be summarized as a 
histogram of mutant allele frequencies, here for sample TB. Considering purity and ploidy, 
mutations with relatively high frequency (>0.25) are likely to be clonal (public), whereas 
low frequency mutations capture the tumor subclonal architecture. (B) The same data can be 
represented as the cumulative distribution M(f) of subclonal mutations. This was found to be 
linear with 1/f, precisely as predicted by the neutral model. (C) R2 goodness of fit of our 
CRC cohort (n=7) and the TCGA colon cancer cohort (n=101) grouped by CIN versus MSI 
confirmed that neutral evolution is common (38/108, 35.1% with R2≥0.98). (D) 
Measurements of the mutation rate showed that the CIN groups had median mutation rate of 
µe=2.31×10-7, whereas MSI tumors reported a 15-fold higher rate (median: µe=3.65×10-6, F-
test: p=2.24×10-8), as predicted due to their DNA mismatch repair deficiency.

 Figure 2. Neutral evolution across the whole-genome of gastric cancers.
(A) Large number of coding and non-coding mutations can be identified using WGS. (B) All 
detected mutations precisely accumulate as 1/f following the neutral model in this example. 
(C) Neutral evolution is very common in gastric cancer, with 60/78 (76.9%) samples 
showing goodness of fit of the neutral model R2≥0.98. This was consistent using all, exonic 
or non-coding subclonal mutations. The same tumors were identified as neutral by all three 
methods, although limitations in detecting neutrality were present when considering exonic 
mutations due to the limited number of variants. (D) Mutation rates were more than 4 times 
higher in MSI (µe=3.30×10-6) versus MSS (µe=7.82×10-7; F-test: p=1.35×10-4) cancers, 
consistently with the underlying biology.

 Figure 3. Neutral evolution and mutation rates across cancer types.
(A) R2 values from 819 cancers of 14 different types supported neutral evolution in a large 
proportion of cases (259/819, 31.6% of R2≥0.98) and across different cancer types, 
particularly in stomach (validating the WGS analysis), lung, bladder, cervical and colon. On 
the contrary, renal, melanoma, pancreatic, thyroid, and glioblastoma were characterized by 
non-neutral evolution. The other types displayed a mixed dynamics. (B) The highest 
mutation rates were found in lung cancer. Lower rates were found in thyroid, low grade 
glioma and prostate.

 Figure 4. Reconstruction of the mutational timeline in each patient.
The allelic frequency of a mutation within the tumor predicts the size of the tumor when the 
mutation occurred. (A,B) The deconvolution of the mutational timeline is illustrated for 
samples TB and TCGA-AA-3712 respectively. Whereas established CRC drivers (APC, 
KRAS, TP53) were found to be present from the first malignant cell, several recurrent 
putative drivers not yet validated were mutated after malignant seeding, despite the 
underlying neutral dynamics. This suggests that some of these candidate alterations may not 
be fundamental drivers of growth in all cases. Confidence intervals are calculated using a 
binomial test on the number of variant reads versus the depth of coverage for each mutation.

 Figure 5. Neutral evolution and tumor phylogeny.
After the accumulation of key genomic alterations, in neutral malignancies the cancer 
expansion is likely triggered by a single critical genomic event (the accumulation of a “full 
house” of genomic changes) followed by neutral evolution that generates a large number of 
new mutations in ever-smaller subclones. While the tumor heterogeneity rapidly increases, 
the allele frequency of heterogeneous mutations decreases. In this context, the accumulation 
of mutations M(f) follows a characteristic 1/f distribution. Moreover, the tumor phylogeny 
displays a characteristic fractal topology that is self-similar. Sampling in different regions of 
the phylogenetic tree exposes distinct mutations that however show the same 1/f distribution. 
Clonal mutations in a sample (not considered in the model) arose in to the most recent 
common ancestor of the sampled cells. Due to the large population of cells sampled using 
bulk sequencing, the majority of detected clonal mutations belongs to the trunk of the tree 
and therefore is found in the first cancer cell. Deviations from the 1/f law indicate different 
dynamics from neutral growth.
