Introduction
Clinical laboratory testing plays a critical role in health care and 
evidence-based medicine (1). Lab tests provide essential data 
that support clinical decisions to screen, diagnose, and treat 
health conditions (2). Most individuals encounter clinical testing 
through their health care provider during a routine health assess-
ment or as a patient in a health care facility. However, individu-
als are increasingly playing more active roles in managing their 
health, and some now seek direct access to laboratory testing for 
self-guided assessment or monitoring (3–5).
In the USA, all clinical laboratory testing conducted on humans 
is regulated by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
based on guidelines outlined in Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA) (6). To ensure analytical quality of labora-
tory methods, certified laboratories are required to participate in 
periodic proficiency testing using a homogeneous batch of sam-
ples that are distributed to each laboratory from a CMS-approved 
proficiency testing program. These programs assess the total 
allowable error (TEa) that combines method bias and total impre-
cision for each analyte. Acceptability criteria are determined by 
CLIA and/or the appropriate accrediting agency (7).
Direct-to-consumer service models now provide means for 
individuals to obtain laboratory testing outside traditional health 
care settings (4, 5). One company implementing this new model is 
Theranos, which offers a blood testing service that uses capillary 
tube collection and promises several advantages over traditional 
venipuncture: lower collection volumes (typically ≤150 μl versus 
≥1.5 ml), convenience, and reduced cost — on average about 5-fold 
less than the 2 largest testing laboratories in the USA (Quest and 
LabCorp) (8). However, availability of these services varies by 
state, where access to offerings may be more or less restrictive 
according to state-level health care regulations. Furthermore, 
Theranos is a private company, and the technical details of their 
test procedures and processes are not available to the public.
BACKGROUND. Clinical laboratory tests are now being prescribed and made directly available to consumers through retail 
outlets in the USA. Concerns with these test have been raised regarding the uncertainty of testing methods used in these 
venues and a lack of open, scientific validation of the technical accuracy and clinical equivalency of results obtained through 
these services.
METHODS. We conducted a cohort study of 60 healthy adults to compare the uncertainty and accuracy in 22 common clinical 
lab tests between one company offering blood tests obtained from finger prick (Theranos) and 2 major clinical testing services 
that require standard venipuncture draws (Quest and LabCorp). Samples were collected in Phoenix, Arizona, at an ambulatory 
clinic and at retail outlets with point-of-care services.
RESULTS. Theranos flagged tests outside their normal range 1.6× more often than other testing services (P < 0.0001). Of the 
22 lab measurements evaluated, 15 (68%) showed significant interservice variability (P < 0.002). We found nonequivalent 
lipid panel test results between Theranos and other clinical services. Variability in testing services, sample collection times, 
and subjects markedly influenced lab results.
CONCLUSION. While laboratory practice standards exist to control this variability, the disparities between testing services 
we observed could potentially alter clinical interpretation and health care utilization. Greater transparency and evaluation of 
testing technologies would increase their utility in personalized health management.

lection methods, we selected tests that obtained small volumes of 
blood via finger prick and matched them with corresponding tests 
offered through traditional venipuncture collection from the other 
services. Overall, we collected 14 samples per subject and obtained 
22 clinical lab measurements (Table 1) per sample for all 60 sub-
jects, which provided a potential total of 18,480 measurements (14 
× 22 × 60) in our study data set (Figure 1). We observed 71 missing 
measurements that could be explained by a technical issue with 
sample processing or instrumentation error, both of which were 
identified and reported by the laboratories through current labo-
ratory practices. We assessed 2,640 (Theranos); 7,920 (LabCorp); 
and 7,920 (Quest) possible measurements and found missing data 
rates of 2.2%, 0.2%, and 0%, respectively. Based on the counts of 
missing data, the odds of Theranos rejecting a sample versus the 
other services was 12.5 (95% CI, 6.9–22.4, P = 1.5 × 10–22). LabCorp’s 
missing data was restricted to a single subject, whereas Theranos 
returned missing data for 4 of the 60 study subjects.
Theranos reports more measures outside their normal range. We 
assessed reporting of lab test results based on collection technolo-
gies and processes that were in service in July of 2015. In accordance 
with clinical testing guidelines, each service provided test-specific 
reference ranges that reflect normal ranges based on the analytical 
instrument used and calibration samples evaluated. The percentages 
for measurements outside their normal range were 8.3%, 7.5%, and 
12.2% for LabCorp, Quest, and Theranos, respectively (Figure 2A). 
 
Despite its commercial availability and technological promise, 
the Theranos collection system has not yet been evaluated through 
independent, rigorous, and publicly disclosed peer-review (9). To 
encourage transparency and rigorous scientific review of clinical 
laboratory testing procedures, we conducted a cohort study of 60 
individuals from July 27, 2015, to July 31, 2015, to compare the accu-
racy and equivalency of clinical laboratory test blood collected via 
finger prick and tested at Theranos against traditional venipuncture, 
followed by laboratory testing offered through Quest Diagnostics 
and LabCorp. We controlled how blood was collected and obtained 
multiple measurements for statistical analyses, but we intentionally 
treated each testing service as a black box to avoid jeopardizing the 
integrity of the tests and to simulate real-world conditions in which 
those ordering the tests for clinical decision making may lack knowl-
edge of how a given test was run but will nevertheless base impor-
tant health-related decisions on the test results. Here, we report that 
the Theranos finger prick collection system yields higher sample 
rejection rates, and their testing services return results that mostly 
agree with other services with the exception of lipid panels, which 
— despite existing laboratory practice standards — exhibited greater 
bias than would be expected, given adherence to such standards.

surements showed significant interservice differences (P < 0.002, 
Figure 3). Our results showed that standard clinical services and 
low-volume blood tests have some measures that agree (e.g., 
triglycerides and rbc counts), whereas others differ significantly 
(e.g., wbc counts, mean corpuscular volume [MCV], cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]), where such differ-
ences could not be explained by differences in collection times or 
intrasubject variability at a given collection time.
In order to test the sensitivity of our findings to the normality 
assumptions, we repeated the analysis of the LMM with a non-
parametric approach. The values of each lab test across all samples 
were quantile-normalized to provide rank-ordered data. The LMM 
analysis was repeated on the transformed data, and the results of 
the nonparametric analysis supported our original conclusions. 
To test the assumption that each lab test result followed a normal 
distribution, we applied the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and found 
that 18 of 22 lab tests did not violate the assumption of a normal 
distribution. The 4 exceptions were monocyte, eosinophil, and 
basophil counts, as well as total bilirubin. In each of the 4 excep-
tions, we applied the nonparametric, 2-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test to compare the distributions and found differences among the 
services for monocytes, basophils, and total bilirubin (P < 0.002), 
whereas no differences were observed for eosinophil counts. These 
results are consistent with what we observed with the LMM and 
analysis of the transformed data.
Assessment of the CBC panel found interservice differences 
in 10 of the 14 measurements. LabCorp reported consistently 
Although LabCorp and Quest showed no significant difference in 
the rates of their tests outside the reference range, the odds that 
Theranos reported a measurement outside its normal range com-
pared with the other services was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.4–1.8, P = 3.1 × 10–19).
To understand the out-of-range values across lab tests and 
at the individual level, we compared the percentage of tests that 
were outside their normal range for all testing services (Figure 2, 
A and B). The percentages represent 100× the number of mea-
surements outside the normal range divided by the total num-
ber of measurements collected by each service. At the individ-
ual level, the Theranos rates were highest in 48 of 60 subjects. 
We found the Theranos rates exceeded the other services in this 
study for 12 tests (Figure 2B). Specifically, the results for mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), lymphocytes, 
and cholesterol components exceeded the expected out-of-
range rates based on standard procedures to calibrate test ref-
erence ranges (Figure 2B). Moreover, for these select tests, the 
ratio of out-of-range rates between Theranos and the other labs 
ranged from 1.6 (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) 
to 4.5 (lymphocyte counts) (Figure 2C).
Testing services show nonequivalent test results. To understand 
transferability of test results among services, we examined test 
result equivalency among different blood testing services and col-
lection technologies. We fit a linear mixed model (LMM) to the lab 
results to identify differences in the reported results that could be 
attributed to services only. When we controlled for age, sex, sub-
ject variability, and collection time, we found 15 of the 22 mea-

Examination of the lipid panel showed nonequivalent lab results 
for total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C (Figure 4, A and B). To test 
for possible bias among testing services, we applied a Passing and 
Bablok regression to compare cholesterol and lipoprotein (LDL and 
HDL) results between Theranos and the 2 other reference laborato-
ries. Theranos reported systematic biases toward lower test values 
for all 3 cholesterol components (Figure 5A). No significant differ-
lower values for wbc and hematocrit (HCT), whereas Theranos 
reported consistently higher counts for neutrophils and mono-
cytes. rbc characteristics of MCHC and rbc width (RDW) dif-
fered among all 3 testing services. Of note, Theranos reported 
increased precision for leukocyte subsets (neutrophils, lympho-
cytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils), although this 
additional precision is unlikely to alter clinical decisions.

would exceed the CLIA TEa budget of ±10% once instrument 
imprecision is considered. Although TEa for HDL-C and LDL-C are

Intersubject and interservice variability dominate lab test results. 
This study of lab tests collected from healthy adults found an unex-
pected degree of variability within and among testing services. Our 
study design allowed us to determine the magnitude and sources of 
variation in our cohort. Specifically, we examined 4 sources of vari-
ability that are primary factors for medical decisions: subject, test-
ing service, collection time, and technical reproducibility. Although 
individuals constitute the largest source of variability, testing ser-
vices also markedly influence lab results (Figure 6). Five lab tests 
showed substantial interservice variability (≥19% of the observed 
variance), and we found the interlab variance was greater than the 
intersubject variance for RDW and MCHC (52% and 95% CI, 49%–
54%; 66% and 95% CI, 64%–69%, of the overall variance, respec-
tively). Tests with large interservice variability were surprising, 
given that the blood collection times were exactly matched for Lab-
Corp and Quest and closely matched for Theranos (i.e., finger prick 
occurred within 90 minutes of venipuncture for 90% of subjects).
Despite controlling eating and physical activity of subjects, we 
found systematic differences between measurements collected at 
early versus late time points — 1 and 2 versus 3 and 4 — in 13 of the 
22 lab tests (P < 0.002). Serum phosphorus levels, wbc counts, and 
counts of leukocyte subsets were significantly higher in the late 
collection, whereas serum uric acid levels, total choles-
terol, HDL-C, bilirubin levels, rbc counts, and rbc char-
acteristics (e.g., hemoglobin [Hgb], hematocrit [Hct], 
and RDW) were higher at early collection times. To 
determine the relationship between service and time 
on the reported test results, we examined both factors 
independently, as well as their interaction. We found 
no significant association with the interaction term 
in all of the lab tests except for 2 — MCV and MCHC. 
Together, these results show that both service and col-
lection time are associated with test results; however, 
their influence is largely independent.
Labs obtained using different collection methods 
are not equivalent for lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-C, 
and HDL-C) and rbc characteristics (RDW, MCV, and 
MCH). Given the large amount of variability, a single 
measurement can be misleading. Additionally, non-
equivalence between testing services raises concerns 
about what might be biological changes that are clin-
ically meaningful versus methodological differences 
that haven’t been standardized. For example, the 
large intra- and interservice variability in specific lab 
tests (e.g., platelets) may have clinical implications 
for individual treatment decisions (Figure 7).
Discussion
In this study, we examined test result equivalency among differ-
ent blood testing services and technologies. Our results showed 
that standard clinical services via venipuncture and blood tests 
collected from low-volume samples have some measures that 
agree (e.g., triglycerides and rbc counts), whereas others differ 
significantly (e.g., wbc counts, MCV, cholesterol, and HDL-C). 
Nonequivalence between testing services raises concerns about 
what results signify biological changes that are clinically mean-
ingful versus results that are driven by methodological or techni-
cal differences that haven’t been standardized or validated.
Our study of lab tests collected from healthy adults found an 
unexpected degree of variability within and among testing services. 
The study design permitted proper apportioning of the sources of 
this variability to major factors including age, sex, subject, collec-
tion, time, and testing service. Although individuals constitute the 
largest source of variability, testing technologies also substantially 
influence lab results. Labs obtained using different technologies 
are not equivalent for lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C) 
and rbc characteristics (RDW, MCV, and MCH).

Some tests were equivalent among services, yet they 
showed systematic bias affected by collection times. In partic-
ular, serum phosphorus and uric acid levels exhibited different 
results depending on whether they were collected in the first 
and second or third and fourth time points. It is possible that 
physiology being quantified by these tests may be more dynamic 
than is appreciated in the clinical interpretation of their results. 
Although a wealth of clinical laboratory testing data exists (10–
12), the circadian or physiological periodicity of many common 
laboratory blood tests may need additional evaluation.
The interservice disparities observed in our study have rele-
vance for clinical decisions. Certain lipid profiles are associated 
with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and we 
observed systematic biases in cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C 
values reported by Theranos. According to 2013 ACC/AHA 
guidelines, among those aged 40–75 years without clinically 
evident CVD, a moderate intensity statin should be initiated in 
patients with LDL-C > 70 mg/dl and either diabetes or ≥7.5% risk 
of having an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event within 
the next 10 years (13). With intraindividual variations in LDL 
levels exceeding 20 mg/dl in several otherwise healthy subjects, 
a strong possibility remains that practitioners either inappropri-
ately initiate or fail to appropriately initiate statin therapy due 
to interservice variation. According to ATP-III guidelines estab-
lished by a National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) 
expert panel (14), HDL-C < 40 mg/dl is considered a major risk 
factor that modifies LDL-C treatment goals, and HDL-C ≥ 60 
mg/dl is considered a protective attribute that negates other risk 
factors. In our study, 5% of subjects had intraindividual varia-
tions in HDL-C levels > 10 mg/dl, indicating testing variation is 
sufficient to alter an individual’s clinical risk assessment.
The clinical practice guidelines listed above are based on 
accurate and precise assessments of total cholesterol, triglycer-
ides, and HDL-C. To ensure this is the case, an expert laboratory 
panel — also established by the NCEP — developed guidelines for 
analytical method requisites for clinical assay precision and bias 
for these measurements (15). In an effort to minimize systematic 
bias between the methods, most clinical laboratory assays in use 
today are standardized against reference materials. The Thera-
nos technology is unknown and, based on our data, does not fit 
the current regulatory guidelines as highlighted by the system-
atic biases in tests of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C. Addi-
tional assessments of the lipid panel tests from Theranos will be 
critical for interpreting results in the context of offering point-of-
care testing at retail outlets, as well as for applying these results 
to the multivariable risk models of disease.
The lack of technical replicates in the Theranos data is a nota-
ble limitation in our assessment of variability. Given the large 
intraindividual variability for lab tests from standard clinical 
services, understanding the variability in low-volume testing is 
critical for helping physicians and patients interpret test results. 
Another limitation of our study is that, although blood samples 
were collected into Nanotainer tubes via finger prick, samples 
were shipped from the retail locations to a central facility in Cal-
ifornia. The technical details of the analytical instruments used 
for the lab tests were unavailable at the time of the study and

substantially lower testing costs (~5-fold less, on average) and 
is attractive for obtaining more data to characterize dynamic/
circadian variability of tests, as well as to quantify normal ver-
sus abnormal variability in individuals. Better understanding of 
individual and population variability in blood measures will be 
required to implement paradigms of precision medicine. Inno-
vation in blood testing technologies can play an important role 
in shifting this paradigm, as long as these innovations provide 
accurate and reliable results.
Methods
Study design. Sixty healthy adults 19–71 years of age (Table 2) provided 
voluntary informed consent for a cohort study to examine laboratory 
test variability among 3 testing service companies. All participants 
were recruited from the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. For 
each subject, we obtained both biological and technical replicates to 
ascertain the sources of variability observed. To control behaviors that 
might influence blood chemistry and hematology levels among col-
lections, all participants fasted and refrained from drinking fruit juice 
or soda, and they avoided exercise during the study. Subjects were 
excluded if they were pregnant, weighed less than 57 kilograms, had 
a history of substance abuse, or had any condition the investigators 
thought might put the subject at risk.
Blood collection and processing. Peripheral blood samples were col-
lected from each subject at 4 separate time points within a 6.5-hour 
window (3 ± 1 hour). A total of 14 samples were obtained per sub-
ject. Samples were divided into technical and biological replicates to 
control for potential sources of variation from the collection method 
(venipuncture versus finger prick) and testing service (Figure 1). All 
venipuncture blood draws were collected and processed by HRI from 
their ambulatory clinics. Draws of 60 ml were split into 6 sets of tubes 
for blood chemistry and hematology tests within 51 minutes (32 ± 5 
minutes), and samples were shipped to testing facilities within 9.5 
hours of processing (4.6 ± 2.2 hours). Test facilities for LabCorp and 
remained uncertain since its completion, which means that the 
differences we found could arise from multiple sources: collec-
tion (low-volume finger prick versus venipuncture), processing 
(how the samples were prepped by the laboratory technicians), 
instrumentation (new versus existing technology), or some com-
bination of these factors. One limitation of an observational study 
is that, although we created a study design to control for many of 
these uncertainties, we were unable to manipulate the collection 
variables to determine their precision contribution.
This study focused on lab tests collected from stable out-
patients with the expectation that most of the reported results 
would fall inside their normal range. Indeed, more than 92% of 
collective measurements reported from LabCorp and Quest, and 
greater than 87% of the measurements returned from Thera-
nos, were within normal ranges. Generally, test results that were 
outside their normal range were consistent for each individual 
among all services, with the major exceptions being lymphocytes 
and components of the lipid panel. Additionally, the percentage 
of lab tests outside the normal range varied in a test-specific 
manner from 0%–40% (basophils to triglycerides, respectively). 
Furthermore, we found higher odds for Theranos to report tests 
outside of the normal range versus the other services (odds 
ratio = 1.6). This increase in abnormal test results can have neg-
ative consequences for medicine in the form of extra testing, 
additional patient visits to clinics/hospitals, and added doctor 
services, all of which result in additional costs and burdens to 
patients or to the healthcare system and are potentially harmful, 
if the abnormal tests were misdiagnoses (i.e., false positives).
Given the large amount of variability, a single measure-
ment from a lab test can be misleading. Single-measurement 
variability can be addressed by collecting more data on indi-
viduals to establish better estimates of true baseline values 
and to understand what excursions suggest changes in health 
status that may require adjustments. Low-volume testing offers 
Figure 6. Sources of lab test variability. 
Percent of the variability explained by 
each component of the LMM (testing 
service, subject, blood collection time, 
and “other”, i.e., residuals, unexplained 
by other covariates). Subject variabil-
ity — not shown explicitly — makes up 
the remaining difference from 100% 
(e.g., MCHC = 23%, hs-CRP = 98%). 
The interservice variability can also be 
interpreted in terms of the intraclass 
correlation. For example, consider the 
lab test for MCHC. Variation across test-
ing service explains 65% of the overall 
observed variance. This result is equiv-
alent to saying that, after correcting 
for the effects of subject and collection 
time, the correlation between samples 
from different services is 65%.

of the lipid panel tests, which were carried out at Quest Diagnostics 
Nichols Institute in San Juan Capistrano, California, USA.
Quality control. To detect potential data entry errors, we carried 
out 3 quality control and assurance measures. First, we applied elec-
tronic and manual quality assurance to identify and confirm outli-
ers. Second, HRI independently confirmed and validated a subset of 
the data. Third, manual monitoring of the clinical database against 
protected health information redacted laboratory source identified 
12 data entry errors out of the 2,772 entries, suggesting a data entry 
error rate of 0.43%.
Data processing. All data were harmonized into standard units 
and codes for easy comparison among testing services. Data were 
excluded based on technical issues such as insufficient sample, 
inability to calculate value, requirement for redraw, or inability to 
apply automated differential gating. Censored data entries were set 
to the lowest detectable numeric value reported by the lab test (total 
of 79 measurements, which is 0.4% of the 18,480 possible entries in 
our data set). Total bilirubin values below the limit of detection were 
fit with a regression model that utilized the direct bilirubin values. 
Both high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and total bilirubin 
values were log10-transformed prior to analysis. BMI was calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Theranos 
measured direct LDL-C, whereas both LabCorp and Quest reported 
calculated LDL-C. For all interservice comparisons, we used calcu-
lated LDL-C values for Theranos. Calculated LDL-C values were 
obtained from the composition of other lipids using the Friedewald 
relationship (16). For the summary of lab test values reported out-
side of their reference range given in Figure 2, the normal range and 
whether a test value was considered out of range were determined by 
the laboratory associated with the test result. In this case, the Thera-
Quest were located in Phoenix and Tempe, Arizona, respectively. Fin-
ger prick blood draws were obtained from 2 separate retail outlets in 
Phoenix, which were collected and processed on site by a laboratory 
employee before shipping the blood to a central Theranos facility in 
Newark, California, USA, for testing.
Clinical laboratory tests. In total, 22 clinical lab tests were carried 
out on each subject (Table 1). Tests were selected from chemistry (lipid 
profile, an inflammatory marker, total bilirubin, serum uric acid, and 
serum phosphorus) and hematology (complete blood count [CBC]) 
with leukocyte subsets calculated by automatic differential gating. All 
tests conducted in this study are categorized as moderate complexity 
by the regulatory standards outlined in CLIA (7).
The LabCorp and Quest facilities that tested the blood samples 
are CLIA accredited. LabCorp tests were completed at Accupath 
Diagnostics Laboratory in Phoenix. Quest lab tests were conducted 
at Sonora Quest Laboratories in Tempe, Arizona, with the exception

the nonparametric, 2-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare 
the distributions among services. To understand the variability in 
the bias and variance partition calculations, we applied a bootstrap 
sampling approach to calculate the 95% CIs. In this study, we eval-
uated 22 separate lab tests for each of the services. To control the 
type I error when testing these separate hypotheses, the Bonferroni 
correction was applied such that a P value less than 2.3 × 10–3 was 
considered significant.
Study approval. The study protocol was approved by the IRB at Icahn 
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and by Quorum Central IRB for HRI. 
The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.

nos LDL-C values and whether those values were out of range were 
determined by Theranos using the measured LDL-C values.
Statistics. All data were analyzed and visualized using the R 
statistical package (version 3.2.1) (17). All hypothesis tests were 
2-tailed unless otherwise specified. To quantify the odds of reject-
ing samples or reporting test results outside of the normal range, we 
computed the odds ratio for these events among testing services. 
Odds ratio calculations were conducted using Fisher’s exact test, and 
hypergeometric distribution was used to estimate the P values. Odds 
ratio calculations were combined using inverse variance weighting 
to derive on overall effect size and P value. To assess systematic bias 
and evaluate TEa scores between services, we applied a Passing- 
Bablok regression (18). In order to identify the sources of variability 
and determine what factors influenced lab test results, we applied 
an LMM using the lme4 R package (19). The LMM partitioned the 
overall variation in tests into variation attributable to differences 
across age, sex, testing services, subjects, and collection times, plus 
residual variation. These components of variation were modeled as 
random effects in order to estimate the percentage of total variance 
attributable to each component. The percent variation explained by 
each component was calculated as the variance attributable to that 
component divided by the total variance. For each variance com-
ponent, we tested the hypothesis that the variance attributable to 
that component was significantly greater than zero. The hypothesis 
tests were applied on a LMM where the component of interest was 
modeled as a fixed effect, while the other 2 components were mod-
eled as random effects. Finite-sample P values for this fixed effect 
were computed using the Kenward-Roger approximation (20). In 
addition to the variables considered in the LMM described above, 
we also examined the interaction between testing service and col-
lection times. To test the sensitivity of our findings to assumptions 
of normality, we transformed the lab test results into rank-ordered 
data using quantile normalization and repeated the LMM analysis on 
the transformed data. To test the assumption that each lab test result 
followed a normal distribution, we applied the Shapiro-Wilk normal-
ity test. If a lab test violated the normality assumption, we applied
