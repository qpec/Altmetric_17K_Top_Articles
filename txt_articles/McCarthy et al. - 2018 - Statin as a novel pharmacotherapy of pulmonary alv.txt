Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome of reduced GM-CSF-dependent,
macrophage-mediated surfactant clearance, dysfunctional foamy alveolar macrophages,
alveolar surfactant accumulation, and hypoxemic respiratory failure for which the pathoge-
netic mechanism is unknown. Here, we examine the lipids accumulating in alveolar macro-
phages and surfactant to define the pathogenesis of PAP and evaluate a novel
pharmacotherapeutic approach. In PAP patients, alveolar macrophages have a marked
increase in cholesterol but only a minor increase in phospholipids, and pulmonary surfactant
has an increase in the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids. Oral statin therapy is associated
with clinical, physiological, and radiological improvement in autoimmune PAP patients, and
ex vivo statin treatment reduces cholesterol levels in explanted alveolar macrophages. In
Csf2rb−/− mice, statin therapy reduces cholesterol accumulation in alveolar macrophages
and ameliorates PAP, and ex vivo statin treatment increases cholesterol efflux from mac-
rophages. These results support the feasibility of statin as a novel pathogenesis-based
pharmacotherapy of PAP.

ulmonary surfactant is composed of 80% polar lipids, pri-
marily phosphatidylcholine, and multiple less-abundant
phospholipid species, 10% neutral lipids, primarily free
cholesterol with small amounts of triglycerides and free fatty
acids, and 10% surfactant proteins1,2 Since cholesterol content
regulates the fluidity and surface tension-lowering effects of
surfactant, which are critical to alveolar stability and lung func-
tion, surfactant composition is tightly regulated3. Surfactant
homeostasis is maintained by balanced secretion by alveolar
epithelial type II cells and clearance via recycling and catabolism
in these cells and by catabolism in alveolar macrophages4. Prior
studies reporting the relative fractional composition of surfactant
phospholipids is normal in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)
patients5 and Csf2−/− mice6, led to a widely-held belief that
surfactant accumulation in PAP is caused by impaired catabolism
of phospholipids within alveolar macrophages7, however, to date,
no such mechanism has been identified.
Alveolar macrophages require granulocyte/macrophage-col-
ony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for maturation in the lungs and
to enable surfactant clearance in vitro and in vivo8,9. Further,
disruption of GM-CSF signaling by either GM-CSF auto-
antibodies as occurs in autoimmune PAP10–12 or by CSF2RA or
CSF2RB mutations as occurs in hereditary PAP13–15 mediates
pathogenesis in > 90% of PAP patients. PAP has no approved
pharmacotherapy and is currently treated by whole lung lavage
(WLL), an invasive, inefficient procedure that is repeatedly
required and not widely available. Based on the observation that
impaired
GM-CSF-dependent
cholesterol
clearance
within
alveolar macrophages drives reduction of macrophage-mediated
surfactant clearance in Csf2rb−/− mice16, a validated animal
model of human PAP17, here, we evaluate cholesterol content in
human alveolar macrophages and pulmonary surfactant from
PAP patients, and test cholesterol homeostasis as a novel target
for development of pharmacotherapy of PAP.
Results
Statin therapy and resolution of autoimmune PAP lung dis-
ease. We identified a 58-year-old woman with severe auto-
immune PAP who responded poorly to WLL but improved
dramatically on statin therapy. She initially presented with pro-
gressive dyspnea of insidious onset and a past medical history
positive only for hypercholesterolemia. Pulmonary function
testing revealed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 74% of the
predicted value and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide
(DLCO) of 41% of predicted. A high-resolution computed
tomogram (HRCT) of the chest revealed diffuse, ground glass
opacification and septal thickening (Fig. 1a) and a lung biopsy
identified histopathology typical of PAP (Fig. 1b). A serum GM-
CSF autoantibody test18 was abnormal (74 mcg/ml, normal <5.0
mcg/ml) and a STAT5-phosphorylation index13 test indicated
GM-CSF signaling was not detectable, thereby establishing a
diagnosis of autoimmune PAP. Dyspnea and resting hypoxemia
were treated with continuous low-flow oxygen. Multiple bilateral
high-volume WLL treatments (each ~ 50 l saline/lung) were
performed 1, 3, 7, 11, and 25 months after presentation with some
symptomatic relief but no major effect on hypoxemia or sup-
plemental oxygen requirement (Fig. 1d); radiographic abnorm-
alities (Fig. 1a) and severely reduced DLCO (41–54% of
predicted) persisted (Fig. 1f). GM-CSF autoantibody and STAT5-
phosphorylation index tests remained abnormal at all times.
Thirty-two months after presentation, statin therapy was initiated
for hypercholesterolemia and lowered serum cholesterol as
expected (Supplementary Table 1). Six months later, she experi-
enced unanticipated improvement in dyspnea and elimination of
her oxygen requirement (Fig. 1d), HRCT revealed reduced
pulmonary ground glass opacification (Fig. 1a) and 42 months
after initiating statin therapy, the abnormal PAP-related surfac-
tant accumulation had completely resolved as determined by two
different, previously validated, quantitative computed tomo-
graphy (CT)-based methods (categorical parenchymal-pattern
assessment (CALIPER) and densitometry19–21). CALIPER ana-
lysis indicated the percentage lung parenchyma affected by PAP
had declined from 32% to 0% during three and half years on
statin therapy (Fig. 1a, c, Supplementary Tables 2, 3). Further-
more, at this time, the FVC increased to 100% of predicted and
the DLCO increased to 80% of predicted (Fig. 1e, f). Thus,
initiation of statin therapy was associated with sustained clinical
and radiological improvement of PAP lung disease and WLL
therapy was no longer required or administered.
Subsequently, we identified a 66-year-old female with unremit-
ting, slowly progressive autoimmune PAP (serum GM-CSF
autoantibody: 109.1 mcg/ml) who had not received WLL or
other therapy of PAP. Three years after diagnosis, dyspnea on
exertion was persistent, the DLCO was reduced to 69% of
predicted, and HRCT revealed moderate PAP (Supplementary
Fig. 1a). Independently, oral statin was initiated as therapy for
hypercholesterolemia; after 4 months, dyspnea had resolved and
after 1 year, she remained asymptomatic, the DLCO had
normalized (85% of predicted), and CALIPER analysis indicated
the percentage of lung parenchyma affected by PAP had declined
from 38% to 15% (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b).
Statins
reduce
alveolar macrophage
cholesterol
in
PAP.
Prompted by the clinical improvement these patients experienced
on statin therapy and the recent observation that loss of GM-CSF
signaling disrupts cholesterol homeostasis in Csf2rb−/− mice16,
we examined the alveolar material accumulating in autoimmune
PAP by studying total surfactant lipids (i.e., polar and neutral
together) rather than just the polar lipid fraction as had been
done previously5. Alveolar macrophages from autoimmune PAP
patients were foamy (Fig. 2a) and contained large amounts of free
and esterified cholesterol and only a small increase in phospho-
lipids (Fig. 2b, c). Importantly, the ratio of cholesterol to phos-
pholipids in pulmonary surfactant was markedly increased
(Fig. 2d). This latter observation has physiological implications, as
cholesterol regulates surfactant fluidity22 as well as diagnostic
implications as its measurement could serve as an adjunct to the
bronchoscopic evaluation of patients with ground glass opacifi-
cation identified by chest CT examination.
To determine whether statin therapy may act via a direct effect
on alveolar macrophages, PAP patient-derived foamy alveolar
macrophages were exposed to statin therapy ex vivo for 24 hours
and cholesterol content was measured. Statin treatment reduced
cholesterol content by 40% compared with paired control cells
(Fig. 2e). As statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
reductase (HMGCR) thus reducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
cholesterol levels resulting in increased expression of sterol
regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2)23,24, we evalu-
ated the effects of statin on this pathway in alveolar macrophages.
Statin therapy increased expression of SREBP2 (Fig. 2f) and its
downstream target genes (Supplementary Fig. 2a) including
neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase-1 (NCEH) (Fig. 2f), an enzyme
responsible for converting esterified cholesterol to free choles-
terol, which facilitates cholesterol efflux. Because ATP-binding
cassette transporter family members A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and
ABCG1, respectively) mediate cholesterol efflux from macro-
phages and their expression is abnormal in PAP25,26, we
evaluated the effects of ex vivo statin exposure on ABCG1/
ABCA1 mRNA levels in PAP patient-derived alveolar macro-
phages. Statin increased mRNA transcript levels of both ABCA1

 and ABCG1 compared to paired control cells (Fig. 2f). These
results indicate statin therapy may act through a direct effect on
foamy, cholesterol-laden alveolar macrophages in PAP patients
by promoting cholesterol efflux.
Statins improve PAP lung disease in Csf2rb−/− mice. Next, we
asked if the clinical benefit of statin therapy could be recapitu-
lated in vivo in a validated PAP model. To address this question,
Csf2rb−/− mice received statin therapy by oral administration
for 6 weeks. Compared with age-matched, untreated controls,
statin-treated mice had reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
turbidity (Fig. 3a) (an excellent global measure of PAP sediment
accumulation reflecting disease severity17) and reduced choles-
terol levels in BAL (Fig. 3b) and alveolar macrophages (Fig. 3c)
(excellent biochemical measures of PAP disease severity17).
Similar to results for human alveolar macrophages treated with
statin ex vivo, alveolar macrophages from statin-treated mice had
increased mRNA transcript levels in for Srebp2, Nceh, Abca1, and
Abcg1 compared with age-matched, untreated controls (Fig. 3d–g,
Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Statins increase Csf2rb−/− macrophage cholesterol efflux.
Because statin therapy reduced cholesterol levels in foamy
alveolar macrophages from autoimmune PAP patients ex vivo
and Csf2rb−/− mice in vivo (Figs. 2e, 3c), and cholesterol efflux
is reduced in macrophages from apoE−/−GM-CSF−/− mice27,
we measured the effects of statin on efflux of radiolabelled cho-
lesterol from alveolar macrophages or bone marrow-derived
macrophages in the presence of cholesterol acceptors—high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) or apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1),
which preferentially accept cholesterol from macrophages via
ABCG1 and ABCA1, respectively28. Compared with untreated

 paired cells, statin-treated alveolar macrophages had increased
efflux in the presence of HDL but not Apo-A1 (Fig. 3h, i),
whereas
statin-treated
bone
marrow-derived
macrophages
(BMDMs) had increased efflux in the presence of both Apo-A1
and HDL (Fig. 3j, k). These results support the concept that statin
may provide benefit as therapy of PAP by a direct effect on
alveolar macrophages by increasing cholesterol clearance.
Discussion
This
study
showed
that
cholesterol—not
un-metabolized
surfactant or phospholipids—was the predominant material
accumulating in alveolar macrophages in PAP patients and
was
associated
with
a
marked
increase
in
the
ratio
of
cholesterol to phospholipids in pulmonary surfactant. Statin
therapy was associated with improvement in lung disease in
autoimmune PAP patients, reduced cholesterol levels in alveolar
macrophages from autoimmune PAP patients ex vivo, increased
cholesterol efflux from Csf2rb−/− macrophages ex vivo, and
ameliorated lung disease in Csf2rb−/− mice in vivo. Together,
these results identify oral statin therapy as a novel pathogenesis-
based pharmacotherapeutic approach for patients with auto-
immune PAP.

 The observation that abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in
alveolar macrophages and pulmonary surfactant is similar in
autoimmune PAP patients and in Csf2rb−/− mice16 suggests a
similar mechanism may drive PAP pathogenesis. In mice, GM-
CSF signaling via PU.1 is required to stimulate differentiation and
functions of alveolar macrophages including surfactant clear-
ance8. In humans, GM-CSF, PU.18, and PPARγ9,29 are required
for alveolar macrophage differentiation and surfactant clearance.
In nonhuman primates, passive transfer of PAP patient-derived
GM-CSF autoantibodies reduced expression of GM-CSF signaling
axis components in alveolar macrophages in parallel with devel-
opment of PAP30. GM-CSF is critical to cholesterol homeostasis
in murine macrophages and stimulates cholesterol clearance in a
constitutive, dose-dependent, and reversible fashion16. Csf2rb
−/− macrophages readily clear cholesterol-deficient surfactant
but clearance is reduced when cholesterol is present. Finally,
ABCA1 and ABCG1 are vital to cholesterol homeostasis in mac-
rophages and expression of both is abnormal in alveolar macro-
phages
in
human
and
murine
PAP16,25,26,31.
Further,
macrophage-specific
Abcg1
gene-ablation
causes
PAP
with
accumulation of pulmonary cholesterol32. These results suggest a
mechanism explaining the pathogenesis of autoimmune PAP
(Fig. 4): reduced GM-CSF-PU.1-PPARγ axis signaling in alveolar
macrophages → reduced ABCG1/ABCA1 expression → reduced
cholesterol clearance → secondarily reduced surfactant uptake
and clearance (not impaired surfactant phospholipid catabo-
lism) → surfactant accumulation in pulmonary alveoli → clinical
manifestations. Several findings suggest the change in ABCG1
expression may be more important to the pathogenesis of PAP
than that of ABCA1, which may comprise an incompletely
effective compensatory response to increased cholesterol. In
Csf2rb−/− alveolar macrophages, Abca1 is overexpressed while
Abcg1 is severely reduced (Fig. 3f, g) and a similar pattern seen in
primary alveolar macrophages from autoimmune PAP25, how-
ever, both were reduced in cultured BMDMs in the absence of
cholesterol exposure (albeit Abcg1 more severely)16. Despite
increased expression of ABCA1 in PAP alveolar macrophages,
these cells remain filled with cholesterol-rich droplets (Fig. 2a, b).
The observation that statin increased cholesterol transporter
expression and efflux and reduced cholesterol levels in alveolar
macrophages from PAP patients ex vivo and in Csf2rb−/− mice
in vivo suggests a direct therapeutic effect of statins on alveolar
macrophages. Indeed, statins have been reported to directly affect
alveolar macrophage inflammatory cytokine release, phagocy-
tosis, efferocytosis, and particulate clearance33,34. Further, statins
increase
cholesterol
efflux
from
the
macrophage-like
cell
line THP-135 and activate PPARγ36, which is known to
increase ABCA1/ABCG1 expression and cholesterol efflux in

 macrohpages25,31. Our proposed mechanism of action of statin
therapy in PAP involves inhibition of HMGCR activity leading to
reduced ER cholesterol content, thus increasing SREBP2 expres-
sion. In turn, this increases NCEH expression/activity37,38,
allowing hydrolysis of cholesterol esters and liberation of cho-
lesterol, which increases liver X receptor (LXR) activity, ABCA1/
G1 expression, and subsequent efflux through these transporters
primarily to HDL (Fig. 4).
Our results do not exclude the possibility that effects of statin
therapy on serum cholesterol and HDL may contribute to ther-
apeutic efficacy in PAP. Indeed, autoimmune PAP patients have
an increased serum LDL:HDL ratio and reduced HDL levels39,40
and the LDL to HDL ratio is inversely correlated with disease
severity39. This study did not define the optimal dose of statin
therapy or the time required to reach maximal treatment effect
and additional studies are needed to further determine the spe-
cific mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and the potential
role of statin therapy in autoimmune PAP. We have previously
targeted cholesterol homeostasis by oral administration of PPARγ
or LXR agonist therapy in Csf2rb−/− mice16. Although both
statins and PPARγ agonists are available and commonly used,
clinical trials will be needed to determine the relative safety and
potential efficacy of these pharmacotherapies in patients with
autoimmune PAP.
Finally, these results highlight the potential utility of two novel
clinical outcome/diagnostic measures in the differential diagnosis
of PAP. First, categorical parenchymal-pattern assessment using
CALIPER software and quantitative densitometry of the lung CT
scans provide continuous variable-based measures of pulmonary
surfactant accumulation, which are useful in assessing PAP dis-
ease severity and may be favorable compared to semiquantitative
visual assessment41. Second, measurement of cholesterol levels
(or the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio of surfactant) in BAL
could be used to evaluate patients with diffuse ground glass
opacification as an adjunct to the bronchoscopic evaluation of
PAP, which may reduce the need for a lung biopsy and the
associated morbidity.
Methods
Ethical approval. The institutional review boards of the Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center and University of California Los Angeles approved this
study. All human participants or their legal guardians gave written informed
consent. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
and the Office of Animal Research Oversight (OARO) at University of California
Los Angeles.
Computed tomography densitometry analysis. A semi-automated image ana-
lysis algorithm was developed to segment the lungs and quantify the change in lung
mass over serial CT images. Lung segmentation was performed using a commer-
cially available software program (Amira, Hillsboro Oregon, USA). The whole-
lungs were segmented from the body and major vasculature using an initial
threshold of < 500 Hounsfield units (HU), with user oversight. The average HU
values of the left and right lung were quantified along with the respective lung
volumes, which were measured by summing the voxel-volumes within the lungs.
Based on the average HU of each lung, mean lung tissue densities (ρCT) of both left
and right lungs were determined via the following equation.
ρCT
ð
Þ ¼
1000 � ðHUÞ
1000
�

Studies show that lung density decreases slightly in proportion to height42,
accordingly, a small correction was used to calculate the total lung mass (TLM)
using the following formula: Predicted TLM (g)−height (cm) × 9.8759−1019.1.
The data were also expressed as a percentage of the predicted TLM using the
following formula: Percent error = ((TLM−Predicted TLM)/Predicted TLM) ×
100). Predicted TLM was calculated from standard CT in 10 healthy control
individuals (Supplementary Table 2). The patient’s predicted TLM was calculated
based on the height of the patient (Supplementary Table 3).
CALIPER parenchymal computed tomography analysis. The CALIPER (Com-
puter-Aided Lung Informatics for Pathology Evaluation and Ratings) image ana-
lysis software was developed at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA). CALIPER
provides automated characterization and quantitative assessment of pulmonary
parenchymal disease on high-resolution CT data. Comprehensive description of
CALIPER methodology has been previously published43. In brief, data processing
includes extraction of lung parenchyma from the surrounding thoracic structures
(chest wall, central airways and vessels). There is additional segmentation of the
lung into 12 regions (left/right with central/peripheral areas within bilateral upper/
middle/lower zones) using pre-defined landmarks. Using a 15 × 15 × 15 voxel and
sliding box technique, each pixel of the lung parenchyma is mapped to a par-
enchymal tissue type. The classification is based on the similarity of the sampled
voxel histogram to the signature of regions previously determined by consensus
agreement of thoracic radiologists and additional morphological characteristics.
Through this process, each pixel is labeled as normal parenchyma, low attenuation
areas (mild, moderate, and severe subtypes) and increased attenuation areas
(ground glass opacity, reticular densities) or honeycombing. The volume of each of
these characteristics and percent of total parenchyma for each feature can be
quantified. For the assessment of PAP, the sum of high density features (ground
glass opacity and reticular densities) was considered “Involved Lung Parenchyma”
and the sum of normal and low attenuation areas was considered “Uninvolved
Lung Parenchyma”. The percent involved vs. uninvolved regions was calculated
based on the volume of each characteristic divided by the total segmented lung
parenchymal volume.
Human BAL and alveolar macrophages. Human BAL fluid and alveolar mac-
rophages were obtained from BAL using flexible bronchoscopy or from discarded
material of PAP patients undergoing therapeutic WLL. After the fluid was cen-
trifuged at 283 × g for 10 minutes, the cellular pellet was resuspended in the culture
medium. Human alveolar macrophages were isolated by adherence to tissue culture
plastic. Extracellular debris was removed by gentle washing with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS). Cells were maintained in the culture medium of Dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) plus 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin.
Mice used in this study. Csf2rb gene-deficient (Csf2rb–/–) mice backcrossed onto a
C57BL6/J background were used for this study and the phenotype has been pre-
viously reported44. C57BL6/J mice (referred to as wild type or WT mice) were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All mice were bred and housed at the
Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation (CCRF) Vivarium or University of
California Los Angeles (UCLA). Mice were maintained on a 12 hour/12 hour light/
dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. All animal experiments were
approved by the IACUC at CCRF and the OARO at UCLA.
Collection of mouse BAL fluid. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in
mice to acquire epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages. BAL was collected
from mice using five 1 ml aliquots of PBS plus 0.5 mM EDTA17. The 1 ml aliquots
were pooled and the recovered volumes recorded. The turbidity of the fluid was
measured as described below. Aliquots of the BAL were taken as pre-spun samples
and total BAL lipids were extracted using chloroform and methanol. Cholesterol
was measured by the Amplex red cholesterol assay, described in more detail below.
Total phosphate and saturated phosphatidylcholine were measured as described
below45,46. From the remaining BAL fluid alveolar macrophages were isolated by
spinning the BAL at 280 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C to isolate a cellular pellet. The
supernatant was removed and the cellular pellets were resuspended in the culture

Fig. 4 Proposed mechanisms for the pathogenesis and statin therapy of
PAP. In the absence of GM-CSF signaling, surfactant-derived cholesterol
accumulates progressively in lipid droplets resulting in foamy alveolar
macrophages (red arrows indicate the effects of reduced GM-CSF
signaling). Statin therapy results in increased cholesterol clearance from
macrophages in PAP (green arrows represent the effects of statin in foamy

 media (DMEM) for isolation of alveolar macrophages by adherence to tissue
culture plastic16.
Diff-Quick staining. Cells were sedimented and stained with buffered eosin and
methylene blue (Diff-Quick, Fisher) and evaluated by light microscopy.
Oil Red O staining. Cells were stained with Oil Red O staining using the Oil Red O
staining kit (Poly Scientific R&D Corporation) according to the following protocol.
Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and washed twice with distilled water. Cells
were placed in absolute propylene glycol for 5 minutes. Propylene glycol was
removed and cells were stained in a 0.5% Oil Red O solution in propylene glycol for
30 minutes. Cells were rinsed in an 85% propylene glycol solution for 5 minutes
and washed twice with distilled water followed by a hematoxylin counterstain for
2 minutes. Cells were mounted with an aqueous mounting medium (glycerin jelly).
Electron microscopy. Alveolar macrophages were collected by centrifugation
(3000 rpm, 3 minutes, room temperature), incubated in modified Karnovky’s
fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate
buffer plus 0.1% calcium chloride, pH 7.3) for 2 hours, at room temperature and
cell blocks were prepared and evaluated as previously described47.
Lipid extraction from BAL fluid. A chloroform-methanol extraction was used to
extract lipids from cells and BAL for further analysis. 1 ml of BAL was diluted in
1 ml of DPBS, subsequently 2 ml of 100% methanol, and 4 ml of 100% chloroform
were added. This was mixed and then centrifuged at 4°C @1000 rpm. The lower
phase containing the extracted lipids was transferred to a new glass tube for
analysis.
Cellular lipid analysis. To collect cellular lipids from primary alveolar macro-
phages, culture media was aspirated and then 100% isopropanol was added to the
tissue culture wells. Cellular lipids were extracted for 2 hours at room temperature
or overnight at 4°C. The isopropanol was then transferred into glass tubes and half
the volume of new isopropanol was added back to the tissue culture plate for
30 minutes to recover any remaining sample and combined with the original
volume. Following removal of isopropanol, a Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid assay)
protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed on the tissue culture wells
to determine the cellular protein concentration.
Tri-one dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TOD-TLC). Alveolar macro-
phages (AMs) were isolated from BALF based on adherence to tissue culture plastic
as described above. Cells were repeatedly washed with PBS to remove extracellular
surfactant and then 100% isopropanol was added to the tissue culture wells, 1 ml
for a 12-well plate and 2 ml for a six-well plate. Cellular lipids were extracted for
2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The isopropanol was then
transferred into glass tubes and half the volume of new isopropanol was added back
into the tissue culture plate for 30 minutes to recover any remaining sample and
combined with the original volume. Lipid samples were then evaporated using a
stream of nitrogen and a water bath set to 52°C. Cellular lipid samples were then
loaded onto high performance thin-layer chromatography plates pre-coated with
silica gel 60 (Fisher). Plates were prewashed with chloroform and methanol to
remove any contaminants and dried overnight at 120°C. Plates were developed in a
solvent system modified from White et al.48. In brief, plates were first developed in
a Solvent mixture of chloroform, ethanol, triethylamine, and water (30:35:35:6) up
to 7 cm of a 10 cm plate. Plates are removed from the chamber, dried, and placed in
a second solvent of hexane and diethylether (90:10) up to 9 cm of a 10 cm plate.
Plates are again removed from the chamber, dried, and then placed in the final
solvent of pure hexane and run to the top of the plate. Bands are visualized by
spraying with a 0.05% solution of primuline in acetone and water (80:20) and
detected as ultraviolet spots at 366 nm on a Typhoon 9500 molecular imager48.
Lipid band densities were calculated using ImageQuant Software (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) based upon standard curves.
Cholesterol analysis. Total and free cholesterol levels were measured by fluoro-
metric enzymatic assay as previously described16. Esterified cholesterol was then
calculated by subtracting free cholesterol from the total value.
BAL turbidity. The turbidity of the fluid was measured as previously described17,49.
In brief; 250 µl of the BAL were diluted into 750 µl of PBS and the optical density
measured at a wavelength of 600 nm and multiplied by the dilution factor.
BAL phospholipid levels. Aliquots of the BAL were taken as pre-spun samples and
total BAL lipids were extracted using chloroform and methanol. Total phosphate
and saturated phosphatidylcholine were measured as previously reported45,46.
Ex vivo human macrophage statin treatment. After purifying alveolar macro-
phages as described above, fresh media was added to the adherent alveolar macro-
phages containing human M-CSF (R&D) (25 ng/ml) only or M-CSF plus simvastatin
(Calbiochem) (5 µM) and Mevalonic acid (Sigma Aldrich) (100 µM). After 24 hours
of culture, cholesterol analysis or qRT-PCR was performed as described.
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis. Total RNA was isolated using
Qiazol (Life Technologies) and was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA)
using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was determined by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using a Lightcycler480 Real-time qPCR
machine and Lightcycler480 mastermix (Roche Diagnostics). Relative gene
expression was determined using an efficiency corrected method and efficiency was
determined from a 3-log serial dilutions standard curve made from cDNA pooled
from all samples. Primers were designed across exon-exon boundaries (Supple-
mentary Data 1). Results were normalized to 36b4 mRNA.
In vivo statin treatment of Csf2rb–/– mice. For oral statin administration studies
in mice, simvastatin or pravastatin was incorporated into standard rodent chow
(Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001; LabDiet) at a dose expected to deliver 10 mg/kg/
BW/Day (Research Diets). BAL turbidity and cholesterol levels were measured as
described above. Primary alveolar macrophages were isolated and cholesterol
assays and qRT-PCR were performed as described above.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow cells were obtained from
6-week old Csf2rb–/– mice by crushing the tibias and femurs with the culture
media (DMEM (Life Technologies) plus 10% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml
streptomycin). Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation over a Ficoll-
Paque (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) gradient at room temperature for 30 minutes.
The buffy coat was washed in PBS and the cellular pellet resuspended in the culture
medium with M-CSF (R&D Systems) (10 ng/ml) and cells were cultured in a 10 cm
dish overnight at 37°C and the next day non-adherent cells were recovered and
transferred to a new dish and cultured under the same conditions for an additional
24 hrs. At this stage, non-adherent cells were discarded and adherent cells cultured
for an additional 5 days to allow differentiation of BMDMs.
Radiolabelled cholesterol efflux analysis. Alveolar macrophages or bone
marrow-derived macrophages were obtained from Csf2rb−/− mice as
described. Macrophages were plated in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) in
media (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and allowed to adhere for 2 h. Cells were
washed and incubated for an additional 24 h in fresh media containing bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (0.2% w/v), M-CSF (10 ng/ml), supplemented with an
ACAT inhibitor (58-035; 2 µg/ml) and 3H-cholesterol (1uCi/ml). After 24 h, the
cells were washed with PBS and incubated in fresh media containing 0.2% BSA and
M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for a further 24 h equilibration period, with simvastatin (5 µM)
and mevalonic acid (50 µM) or DMSO control. To determine cholesterol efflux, the
cells were rinsed and then incubated for 4 h in media containing 0.2% BSA and M-
CSF (10 ng/ml) with Apo-AI (15 µg/ml) or HDL (50 µg/ml). The media was
removed, the cells washed in PBS, and the radioactive content of the media and
cells determined as described50. Cholesterol efflux was determined by dividing the
radioactive content of the media by the sum of the radioactivity in the cells and
media.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
7 software. Each data point represents Mean ± SEM. For comparison of two
groups, parametric (t test) or non-parametric (Mann–Whitney test) tests were
done where appropriate. For comparison of three groups or more, statistical
analysis was carried out using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonfer-
roni’s post hoc test. N and P values are indicated in figure legends, and P values <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
