Objective: To examine the motivations and circumstances of individuals seeking information about self-abortion
on the Internet.
Study design: We identified 26 terms that we anticipated someone might use to find information about self-abor-
tion on the internet. Users who entered these terms into the Google search engine were provided with a link to
our survey via Google AdWords. We fielded the survey over a 32-day period; users were eligible if accessing the
survey from a US-based device. We examined demographic characteristics of the sample, reasons for searching
for information on self-abortion, knowledge of the legality of abortion and of nearby providers, and top
performing keywords.
Results: Our Google AdWords campaign containing the survey link was shown approximately 210,000 times, and
clicked 9,800 times; 1,235 respondents completed the survey. The vast majority of the sample was female (96%),
and 41% were minors. Almost three-quarters (73%) indicated that they were searching for information because
they were pregnant and did not or may not want to be. Eleven percent had ever attempted to self-abort. One-
third of respondents did not know if abortion was legal in their state of residence, and knowledge of legality
did not differ by age.
Conclusions: There is interest in learning more about self-abortion on the Internet. Our findings suggest that,
among those who participated in our survey, online searches for information on self-abortion may be driven
by adolescents and young adults facing an unintended pregnancy.
Implications: Young women, in particular, may have an unmet need for information about safe and accessible
abortion options.

1. Introduction
Although abortion is legal in the United States, some individuals may
seek to terminate pregnancies outside of a clinical setting if clinical
abortion services are unavailable, inaccessible, or unacceptable to
them [1–3]. One barrier to accessing abortion is the lack of information
about abortion options [4,5]. It is likely that many individuals who con-
sider abortion, and self-abortion1 in particular, turn to the Internet to
find information. One study found that between 2011 and 2015 the
number of Google searches using terms related to self-abortion in-
creased from 119,000 to 700,000. These searches were more common
in states with the highest number of abortion restrictions [6], though
it was unknown whether searchers were looking for information to
end their own pregnancies.
Among a nationally representative sample of abortion patients in
2014, just over 2% reported ever attempting to end a pregnancy on
their own; slightly more than half of these reported using misoprostol,
also known as Cytotec [7]. In Texas, where abortion has become highly
restricted in recent years, one study estimated that at least 100,000
Texas residents had ever attempted to end a pregnancy on their own
[8], though it is unknown what methods they used.
Misoprostol alone is a safe and effective abortifacient for pregnancies
through 12 weeks of gestation [9], and was likely the main drug pro-
cured for self-abortion among users identified in earlier studies. Recent
research suggests that a combined regimen of mifepristone and miso-
prostol, the main regimen used in early medication abortions in clinic
settings, can be successfully purchased on the Internet in the United
States [10].
Very little is known about how and why people use the Internet to
search for information related to self-abortion and who is searching
for this information in the United States. This exploratory study at-
tempts to help fill this gap. We obtained survey data from 1,235 individ-
uals who used Google to find information related to self-abortion,
including interest in and knowledge of this topic to better understand

1 A variety of terms are used to refer to this practice: self-managed, self-sourced, self-di-
rected abortions, or self-induced abortions. We use the term “self-abortion” in this study
because it was the term most commonly used by respondents.

 the circumstances that motivated these searches and the characteristics
of some of the individuals seeking this information.
2. Materials and methods
We administered the online survey between May 30 and June 30,
2017, and only individuals who were accessing the internet from a U.
S.-based, internet-accessible device were eligible; geographic location
was determined by information from Google Analytics. To recruit re-
spondents, we identified 26 English-language terms and keywords
which we anticipated a Google user might enter as a part of their
query if they were searching for information about self-abortion
(Table 1). Keywords with a plus-sign (+) indicate a “broad match,”
which captured misspellings, synonyms, and relevant variations of the
search terms. For example, a search for “pill for abortion” would be
encompassed by “+abortion +pill.” We employed these keywords in
Google AdWords, an online advertising service that enabled our survey
to be displayed to relevant users of Google’s search engine. Google
searches including the keywords would return a link to our survey in
the users’ search results, typically at the top of the page and appearing
as a targeted ad (Fig. 1).
We designed and implemented the survey using REDCap software, a
browser-based web application for building and managing online sur-
veys and databases. In order to optimize search engine content valida-
tion such that Google would recognize the newly published survey
page as a legitimate site, we placed links to the survey on the bottom
of several Guttmacher Institute webpages. However, we deleted all sur-
veys accessed and completed via these links, and we used only those
surveys which users accessed via a Google query and directed to the
survey via Google AdWords. To validate that respondents found the sur-
vey via the Google AdWords campaign and not through links accessed
directly from any of the Institute’s webpages, we matched the REDCap
timestamp to the Google Analytics timestamp.
The survey, available in English only, consisted of 18 questions cov-
ering reasons for interest in self-abortion, abortion history, and knowl-
edge of abortion legality and availability in the respondent’s area and
several demographic characteristics (see Appendix A). The landing
page provided a brief explanation of the survey, including a statement
of implied consent, and three questions about respondents’ age, sex (in-
cluding an “other” category), and which of nine broad keyword terms
was the most important in their original Google query (Table 3). The
search term selected by the respondent was used to autopopulate the
wording on subsequent survey items to make wording specific to the
user’s query. Respondents who indicated “female”, “other”, or who left
the item blank received a survey with questions asking about personal
experiences with pregnancy. Respondents who indicated “male” re-
ceived questions worded such that they asked about the pregnancy
and abortion experiences of someone they knew. Based on pre-testing
among colleagues, we estimate that the survey took approximately
five minutes to complete. Upon survey completion, respondents were
shown a final “thank you” page, which allowed users to navigate back
to their original search. It also contained links to the pregnancy options
page of the National Abortion Federation [11], and the All-Options Hot-
line [12], which provides support for all pregnancy options, including
parenting, abortion, and adoption. No financial incentives were

 provided. The questionnaire and procedures were approved by the
Guttmacher Institute’s federally registered institutional review board.
We obtained a total of 3,642 surveys; we discarded 2,343 of these ei-
ther because the user did not fully complete the survey (n=1,348) or
because they did not access the survey through Google AdWords (n=
995). We discarded another 36 surveys because they were submitted
outside of the date range, 26 because they were duplicates, and two
that were filled out inappropriately. The final sample consisted of
1,235 respondents.
Missing data ranged from 0.6% to 5% by survey item. This is a de-
scriptive exploratory study, and we largely rely on univariate tabula-
tions to present the findings, which include: Google Analytics data
about the search terms, respondent characteristics and responses to
the survey items. Because minor adolescents were substantially over-
represented in the sample, we examined several characteristics by age
group (b18 vs. 18 and older), using chi-square statistics to assess associ-
ations. We conducted all analyses using Stata version 14.
3. Results
The targeted ad was shown in response to approximately 210,000
searches (ad views) over the course of the 32-day fielding period
(Table 1). Approximately 9,800 individuals followed the link (clicks)
for a click through rate (CTR) of 4.7%. Of all the clicks, or visits to the
website, we collected completed survey data (conversions) from 1,235
unique respondents, for an overall conversion rate of 13%.
Among completed surveys, those resulting from Google searches
that included the words “+abortion +pill” were the most common,
resulting in approximately 97,600 ad views, 3,300 clicks, and 415 com-
pleted surveys (34% of all surveys) (Table 1). More specific searches for
“cytotec” and “misoprostol” ranked sixth and tenth, respectively, by
number of ad views; however, their conversion rates were quite low,
8% and 1%, respectively.
3.1. Respondent characteristics
The sample was predominantly young and female (Table 2). Sev-
enty-nine percent indicated they were under the age of 25, and 41%
were minors (17 or younger). The vast majority of respondents (96%)
were female. While no racial or ethnic group made up the majority of
respondents, the largest proportion (44%) were white, followed by
Black (27%) and Hispanic (22%). Similarly, no one educational group
made up the majority of respondents, but the greatest proportion had
not graduated from high school (43%).
Individuals from the South made up the greatest proportion of re-
spondents (42%), similar to their overall representation in the United
States, 38% [13]. Of all respondents, 94% submitted surveys via mobile
phones, 6% via computers, and 1% via tablets.
3.2. Survey findings
When asked which of the search terms that lead them to the survey
was the most important, the majority of respondents (56%) indicated
self-abortion, followed by abortion pill (27%) and abortion (12%)
(Table 3). A comparison of the self-reported search terms and actual
keywords the respondents entered into Google were relatively well
aligned. For example, 55% of respondents who entered the terms
+abortion +pill indicated that “abortion pill” was the most important
term in their search (not shown). Notably, 33% of respondents who
searched for information on +abortion +pill indicated on the survey
that “self-abortion” was the most important term as did 59% of respon-
dents who landed on the survey searching for +how +to +abortion.
Eighty percent of respondents indicated that this was their first time
searching for information related to their search term on the Internet.
Some 64% of respondents provided an answer to the open-ended ques-
tion “In your own words, please tell us a bit more about what you were
hoping to find?” A total of 719 unique responses were provided (not
shown), and the most common theme not directly related to “abortion”,
“pill”, or “pregnancy” was price or cost (15% of write-in responses), and
“self” (10%), for example “how to have a self-abortion” and “a way to
terminate the baby myself.”
The majority of respondents were searching for this information be-
cause they were currently pregnant and did not want to be (62%), and
an additional 10% were pregnant and unsure if they wanted to be; 15%
were searching for someone else who was pregnant.
While abortion is legal in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., knowl-
edge about legality and accessibility was mixed. Two-thirds of respon-
dents knew that abortion was legal in their state, but one-quarter was
unsure or did not know, and 7% thought it was illegal. A slight majority
(52%) were also unsure if there was a health care facility where they
could obtain an abortion within 50 miles of where they lived.
Eleven percent of respondents reported that they had ever had an
abortion at a health care facility, and the same proportion (11%) re-
ported that they had ever attempted to end an unwanted pregnancy
on their own. There was little overlap in these two groups, and only
13 of the 237 respondents who reported either type of abortion re-
ported both. Among the 124 respondents who reported past attempts
to self-abort, the most common method used was herbs/vitamins
(55%) followed by alcohol or drugs (36%). Only 1 respondent indicated
Cytotec or misoprostol specifically (1%), though it is possible that the 10
respondents who indicated “abortion pill” were referring to these drugs.
Respondents under the age of 18 differed from all older respondents
on only a few measures. A smaller proportion had ever had an abortion
(4% vs. 15%, pb.001) though they did not differ in regards to prior

 attempts to self-abort (not shown). A smaller proportion of minors
knew if there was a provider located within 50 miles compared to
older respondents (24% vs. 32%, p=.005), but knowledge about legality
did not differ by age. Finally, we also found no association between re-
gion of residence and knowledge of legality of abortion (not shown).
4. Discussion
The findings from this exploratory study reveal there is an interest to
learn more about self-abortion on the Internet; especially among young
women and women seeking to end a pregnancy. Over the course of the
32-day survey period, more than 200,000 searches were conducted for
information that could be related to self-abortion. That the majority of
the respondents were teenagers could suggest that young people may
have a greater need or desire to learn about discreet abortion options,
or that young people are more likely than their older counterparts to
seek out information on the Internet, and/or complete online surveys.
The latter may be supported by the age distribution of this sample as
compared with the age distribution of a national sample of abortion pa-
tients, in which only 12% were younger than 20. However, interest in
self-abortion may not necessarily translate to abortions obtained in
healthcare facilities.
In some cases, it was unclear if the information being sought
pertained to medication abortion involving a visit to a health care pro-
vider or self-abortion. For example, the most popular search terms
were ones related to “abortion” and “pill.” However, 33% of respondents
who searched for information on +abortion +pill indicated on the sur-
vey that “self-abortion” was the most important term. Similarly, 59% of
respondents who landed on the survey searching for +how +to
+abortion also indicated that “self-abortion” was the most important
term. Thus, while we cannot assert that all respondents were seeking in-
formation on self-abortion, a majority of respondents in our study were.
A majority of respondents did not know if there was an abortion pro-
vider within 50 miles of where they lived, and one-third of respondents
did not know if abortion was legal in their state of residence or thought
it was illegal. The latter may reflect uncertainty around specific abortion
restrictions, such as gestational length cutoffs or parental involvement
laws that might make abortion “practically illegal” for some. These find-
ings may also suggest that many individuals are somewhat uninformed
about abortion until they are confronted with an unintended
pregnancy.
Eleven percent of the respondents reported ever attempting to self-
abort, a higher proportion than found in most studies [1,7,8]. This find-
ing might indicate that young women have a greater interest in or are
more reliant on self-abortion, though selection bias might also play a
role, as prior research suggests that this practice is more common
among older women [14]. Most of these respondents had attempted
to end their pregnancies using herbs, vitamins, alcohol, or drugs sug-
gesting that many such efforts were likely unsuccessful. However,
now that it has been established that effective versions of mifepristone
and misoprostol can be purchased on the Internet [10], individuals who
attempt to self-abort may have more success.
The survey click-through rate of 4.7% is more than twice as high as
the average click-through rate of 2% for all Google AdWords [15]. The
survey conversion rate was also high, 13% compared to 2.4% [16]. Be-
cause the majority of respondents in our sample were pregnant, the
high click-through and conversion rates might indicate that respon-
dents were hoping to obtain more information about their options.
Given this information, future studies should inform respondents that
links to abortion providers and options counseling resources will be
provided upon survey completion, as more than one-third of the indi-
viduals who started the survey did not complete it.
That the overwhelming majority of completed surveys were submit-
ted via mobile phone is perhaps not surprising given the young age of
the sample, as teenagers and young adults are more likely to rely on
smartphones for online access than older adults [17]. It is also possible
that many respondents did not want to search for this information on
a shared computer with more easily discoverable browsing history, es-
pecially if they were living with their parents or other family members.
This study has several limitations. The questionnaire was provided
only in English, and sample is not nationally representative; the findings
cannot be generalized to any known population. Some individuals
searching for information on self-abortion likely followed links more di-
rectly tailored to their search. For example, specific keyword searches of
“Cytotec” and “misoprostol” yielded lower-than-average conversion
rates (8% and 1%, respectively). This may suggest that users who had
more knowledge about the drugs needed to self-abort were less likely
to take the survey. Alternatively, these searchers may have been looking
for a pharmacy that dispensed these drugs, particularly if they did not
know that mifepristone can only be dispensed by a certified healthcare
provider, and may not have conceptualized their search term as
pertaining to "self-abortion”. Finally, we did not ask respondents to dis-
tinguish between their sex and their gender; the survey item was
broadly worded such that respondents could identify their sex or gen-
der broadly. As such, it is possible that any gender nonconforming or
transmen captured are obscured or misclassified in the data.
Although we do not know whether this study applies to any broader
population, the high number of searches for information related to self-
abortion indicate a high level of interest in the topic, especially among
young women and women experiencing an unwanted pregnancy. Addi-
tionally, a number of individuals dealing with an unintended pregnancy
lack basic information about the legality of abortion and whether they
can obtain one at a clinic relatively nearby. These findings suggest that
there is a large audience for online campaigns providing basic
