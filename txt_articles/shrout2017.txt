Abstract
Guided by transactional stress theory, this research investigated the role of appraisals in
noninvolved partners’ mental health and health-compromising behaviors after infidelity.
Responses from 232 college students who were recently cheated on revealed that
negative appraisals (partner blame, self-blame, and causal attribution) had indirect effects
on health-compromising behaviors through mental health (depression, anxiety, and
distress). Moderated mediation analyses revealed that gender altered the indirect effect
of partner and self-blame on health-compromising behaviors through mental health.
Men’s health-compromising behaviors did not differ based on their appraisals or mental
health. However, women who reported negative appraisals and high levels of mental
health consequences engaged in more health-compromising behaviors. These findings
suggest that perceptions of a partner’s infidelity are important, and that those
perceptions affect noninvolved partners’ mental health and physical health behaviors.

 Infidelity occurs in many romantic relationships (Mark, Janssen, & Milhausen, 2011). In
fact, estimates suggest that infidelity happens in 20–25% of marriages (Laumann,
Gagnon, Michael, & Michaels, 1994; Wiederman, 1997) with 22–34% of men and
11–24% of women committing a sexual infidelity in a marital relationship (Allen et al.,
2005; Tafoya & Spitzberg, 2007). Additionally, up to 75% of college students have
reported engaging in some form of infidelity while in a dating relationship (Shackelford,
LeBlanc, & Drass, 2000). Infidelity, which is an emotional, sexual, or romantic invol-
vement that violates an existing relationship’s commitment norms (Glass, 2002), can
have damaging effects on the relationship and both partners. In particular, noninvolved
partners (i.e., the partners who were cheated on in the relationship) often experience a
range of emotional and psychological distress following infidelity, including depression,
anxiety, decreased personal and sexual confidence, and decreased self-esteem (Bird,
Butler, & Fife, 2007; Gordon & Baucom, 1999; Gordon, Baucom, & Snyder, 2004). The
mental health consequences following a partner’s infidelity also may result in an
increase in health-compromising behaviors, such as unprotected sex or greater alcohol
and drug use, which may have lasting effects on the noninvolved partner’s health.
Therefore, experiencing an infidelity can be stressful for the noninvolved partner, with
potential harmful consequences (Fife, Weeks, & Stellberg-Filbert, 2013).
The purpose of this study is two fold. First, guided by transactional stress theory
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, 1987), the present study investigates the mental health
consequences and health-compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners following
infidelity by examining their negative appraisals of the infidelity (i.e., causal attribu-
tions, partner blame, and self-blame). Second, we examine whether noninvolved part-
ners’ mental health links their appraisals to health-compromising behaviors after their
partners’ infidelity. Given the prevalence of, and stress caused by, infidelity in romantic
relationships, understanding the emotional and physical impacts of infidelity on the
noninvolved partner is imperative. This study extends the research in several ways. First,
much research on infidelity tends to be atheoretical. This study applies a stress frame-
work to explain the links between appraisal of the infidelity, mental health, and
engagement in health-compromising behaviors. Second, infidelity is among the most
distressing and damaging events couples face, and it is one of the most difficult problems
to treat in therapy (Gordon et al., 2004). This study extends the research on the emotional
and health toll of infidelity on the noninvolved partner. Third, this study extends pre-
vious research on infidelity by identifying the role of specific personal and relationship
factors that might impact the connections between individuals’ appraisals of the infi-
delity, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors.
Stress, infidelity, and attributions
Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984, 1987) transactional stress theory centers on the impor-
tance of cognitive appraisals about an event or situation based on personal and envi-
ronmental factors, which can result in negative or positive consequences. When an event
or situation occurs, the initial appraisal centers on the question, “Is this event or situation
stressful?” If a person believes that the situation is not at all stressful, he or she makes a
nonthreatening appraisal of the situation, and no reaction is needed. If the person
2

 perceives the situation to be stressful, however, the situation can result in negative or
positive outcomes for the person. In other words, the individual might see the situation as
harmful, threatening, or challenging, and the appraisal helps determine the emotional
and physical consequences of the stressful event. However, the impact of the stressor not
only hinges on one’s cognitive appraisal, but characteristics of the person and the
environment, as well (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, 1987). Stated another way, features of
the person or environment can moderate the severity of the stressful event.
Applying the transactional stress theory to infidelity suggests that the noninvolved
partners’ appraisals of the infidelity, as well as features about the individual and the
relationship, may impact their responses, health, and well-being. Specific appraisals
that have been shown to play a major role in how partners respond and react to stressful
events such as infidelity are attributions (Gordon & Baucom, 2003). The focus of
attribution theory is on how people evaluate causes of and accountability for behavior,
including their own and others’ behaviors (Weiner, 1979). In relationships, causality of
a behavior is determined by the locus (whether the cause rests within the partner),
stability (whether the behavior will continue over time), and globality (whether the
behavior affects other areas of the relationship; Fincham & Bradbury, 1992). In terms
of infidelity, if noninvolved partners perceive that the locus is within the cheating
partner, that the behavior is not likely to change, and that the behavior impacts other
areas of their relationship, they would ascribe causality to the partner, referred to as a
causal attribution. Partners who make causal attributions may experience strong
emotional reactions (Buunk, 1984), respond negatively, and end the relationship (Hall
& Fincham, 2006).
Another appraisal that might influence a noninvolved partner’s health outcomes after
infidelity is the attribution of blame. To make sense of an event, people evaluate whether
others’ behaviors were intentional and whether they should be blamed (Weiner, 1986).
Partner blame attributions concern accountability for a behavior, including the intent
(whether the partner’s behavior was on purpose), motivation (whether the behavior was
motivated by selfish reasons), and degree to which the partner is blameworthy for the
behavior (Fincham & Bradbury, 1992). After an infidelity, noninvolved partners who
perceive that the infidelity was intentional, motivated by selfish reasons, and the fault of
the partner would ascribe responsibility and blame to the cheating partner. Similar to
other relationship stressors (e.g., conflict and dissolution; Gordon, Friedman, Miller, &
Gaertner, 2005), noninvolved partners who attribute responsibility and blame to the
cheating partner may experience distress and depression.
Likewise, attributions of self-blame may impact individuals’ reaction to a partner’s
infidelity. After a relationship breakup, self-blame is associated with greater depression
and anxiety (Boelen & Reijntjes, 2009). For situations involving infidelity, the degree to
which noninvolved partners blame their unfaithful partners or blame themselves for the
infidelity affects whether the relationship can be reconciled (Bird et al., 2007). After a
partner’s infidelity, noninvolved partners who experience high self-blame also report
greater psychological distress (Shackelford et al., 2000). Therefore, identifying the
noninvolved partner’s appraisals of the infidelity, including causal attributions, partner
blame, and self-blame, is an important step in understanding the consequences to their
mental and physical well-being.

 Mental health and health-comprising behaviors following infidelity
Transactional stress theory also emphasizes how appraisals of stressful events impact
personal outcomes, such as mental and physical health consequences (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984, 1987). In particular, infidelity, a major relationship stressor, can have
negative mental health consequences for the noninvolved partner. After infidelity,
noninvolved partners often experience negative emotional reactions including depres-
sion, anxiety, and symptoms consistent with those of posttraumatic stress disorder (Cano
& O’Leary, 2000; Gordon & Baucom, 1999). Noninvolved partners also report feelings
of shame, victimization, powerlessness, and rage following a partner’s infidelity (Bird
et al., 2007; Gordon et al., 2004). In addition, wives are 6 times more likely to be
diagnosed with a major depressive episode after discovering their husbands’ infidelity
(Cano & O’Leary, 2000).
Even though the empirical literature on the association between infidelity and
physical health is limited, research linking other stressors to mental and physical health
outcomes, including health-compromising behaviors, is well developed (e.g., Hatch &
Dohrenwend, 2007). In general, stressful life events often increase the chance of
becoming ill (Turner, 2010) and are associated with poor mental and physical health
(Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007). To cope with stressors, individuals often engage in
health-compromising behaviors, which can be seen as negative behaviors that increase
the risk of poor health outcomes. Health-compromising behaviors include but are not
limited to alcohol, nicotine, or other drug use, overeating, limited physical activity, and
unprotected sex (Walsh, Senn, & Carey, 2013). In a longitudinal study, Walsh, Senn, and
Carey (2013) found that stress, depression, and anxiety predicted increases in health-
compromising behaviors; however, partaking in health-compromising behaviors did not
impact mental health over time.
In terms of romantic relationships, stressors such as relationship discord and conflict
have negative effects on objective and self-rated health outcomes, including cardio-
vascular disease (Baker et al., 2000) and functional impairments (Choi & Marks, 2008).
Relationship breakups, another relationship stressor, can result in poorer physical health
(Lepore & Greenberg, 2002) and, among college students, health-compromising beha-
viors such as increased alcohol use, poorer academic performance, and more dis-
organized behavior (Field, Diego, Pelaez, Deeds, & Delgado, 2013). In addition, people
who experience divorce-related emotional intrusions (e.g., thinking about the separation)
have increased resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Sbarra, Law, Lee, & Mason,
2009). Based on this body of research linking relationship stress and health, we also then
might expect that infidelity would be associated with health, including engagement in
health-compromising behaviors.
Moreover, these studies not only demonstrate the association between relationship
stressors and physical health, they also illustrate the links between mental health, physical
health, and health-compromising behaviors. Research has shown that negative emotional
states are associated with unhealthy physical functioning and illness susceptibility (Cohen
et al., 1995) and that behavioral practices greatly influence one’s physical health (Kobau
et al., 2013). Likewise, people with mental health issues and those who engage in health-
compromising behaviors are at a higher risk of communicable and noncommunicable
4

 diseases (Des Jarlais, Semaan, & Arasteh, 2011; Ezzati & Riboli, 2013; Prince et al.,
2007). Additionally, negative emotional experiences, such as depression, are related to
health-compromising behaviors, including smoking and having unprotected sex, possibly
as a way of reducing negative emotions and inducing positive feelings (e.g., Glassman
et al., 1990; Kelly & Kalichman, 1998). Overall, these findings suggest that mental health,
physical health, and health-compromising behaviors are interrelated. Although people in
romantic relationships tend to have better health, a major internal stressor such as infidelity
may hinder the typical salubrious effects and instead have mental and physical health
consequences, including increased engagement in health-compromising behaviors.
Again, these mental and physical health consequences following infidelity might be
explained with transactional stress theory. When examining infidelity as a stressor, the
model posits that the appraisal of the infidelity would influence a partner’s emotional
response, subjective well-being, and health-compromising behaviors (Lazarus &Folk-
man, 1987). Appraisals that involve causal attributions and self and partner blame would
lead to more mental health issues because noninvolved partners could lose (or have
already lost) their relationships and friendships with their unfaithful partners as well as
their investment and personal beliefs about ideal relationships. In turn, the poorer mental
health would lead to increases in health-compromising behaviors. Therefore, we would
expect that noninvolved partners whose appraisals involve causal attributions about the
infidelity and self and partner blame would report more depression, anxiety, and distress,
which would lead to increases in health-compromising behaviors, such as increased
unprotected sex, smoking, and drug and alcohol use.
Person and environment as moderators of infidelity
Another key component of transactional stress theory is that the impact of the stressor
also depends on features of the person and the environment (Lazarus & Folkman,
1987). In terms of infidelity, a particular feature of the person that might influence
noninvolved partners’ reactions and health following infidelity is their gender. After a
partner’s infidelity, women are more likely than men to feel depressed, disappointed,
anxious, helpless/abandoned, and undesirable/insecure (Shackelford et al., 2000;
Sweeney & Horwitz, 2001). Men are less likely to react emotionally, potentially due to
gendered expectations that men should not express their emotions (Baum, 2003).
Moreover, women may have more emotional responses to infidelity because their self-
construal and identity are often formed by social relationships, including their
romantic relationships (Cross & Madson, 1997). Therefore, we might expect that the
mental health and health-compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners following
infidelity would differ by gender.
In addition, whether or not the couple stayed together after the infidelity may be
considered a feature of the relationship that might impact noninvolved partners’ health.
Dating couples are more likely to terminate their relationships after infidelity compared
to married couples (Sheppard, Nelson, & Mathie, 1995), suggesting that more committed
relationships often persist after infidelity. Further, relationship dissolution is already a
highly stressful situation (Field, Diego, Pelaez, Deeds, & Delgado, 2009) and dissolution
after infidelity creates additional distress, leading to poorer mental health outcomes
Shrout and Weigel

 (Kitson, 1992). We would therefore suspect that whether or not noninvolved partners
continued the relationship with their unfaithful partners might moderate the links
between noninvolved partners’ appraisals, mental health, and health-compromising
behaviors after infidelity.
Overview of the study
The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between appraisals,
mental health, and health-compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners following
infidelity. Guided by transactional stress theory, we contended that infidelity would be
considered a relationship stressor in which the noninvolved partners’ appraisals would
impact their responses and outcomes following the infidelity. Figure 1 displays the
conceptual models tested in this study. Causal attributions, partner blame, and self-blame
may pose a threat to the relationship and to one’s well-being because noninvolved
partners perceive that the infidelity was due to something about their partners or
themselves, rather than something about the situation, leading to increased mental health
consequences and health-compromising behaviors. Thus, we expected that high causal
attributions, partner blame, and self-blame would be related to increases in mental health
consequences as well as increases in health-compromising behaviors. Furthermore,
research has shown that mental health and physical health are connected (Chapman,
Perry, & Strine, 2005) and that psychological stress associated with relationship stressors
can result in poorer physical health (Field et al., 2013; Sbarra et al., 2009). We therefore
predicted that increases in mental health consequences would be related to more health-
compromising behaviors.
In addition to these direct effects, we expected that mental health consequences would
mediate the relationships between appraisals and health-compromising behaviors.
Specifically, we expected that causal attribution, partner blame, and self-blame would be
related to increases in mental health consequences, which would subsequently be related
to greater health-compromising behaviors (Figure 1a). We also predicted that gender and

 relationship status with the cheating partner would moderate the associations between
appraisals, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors (Figure 1b).
Method
Participants and procedure
Participants were recruited from a subject pool at a medium-sized western university in
the United States to complete an online study for partial fulfillment of research partic-
ipation credits. The study description and first survey question specified that participants
“must have been cheated on (emotionally, sexually/physically, or both) while in a
committed relationship in the past 3 months.” Eighty-one individuals had not been
cheated on in the past 3 months and were excluded from the study. A total of 232
individuals had been cheated on in the past 3 months and finished the remainder of the
study. Of these participants, 15% were still in a relationship with the partner who cheated
on them, 11% were not in a relationship with the cheating partner and were dating
multiple people, 23% were not in a relationship with the cheating partner and were in a
relationship with a different partner, 49% were not in a relationship with the cheating
partner and currently were not in a relationship, and 2% did not report their current
relationship status. Nearly all of the participants (98%) reported being in a dating
relationship with the partner at the time the partner cheated with a mean length of 1.76
years (SD ¼ 1.91 years), ranging from 1 month to 17 years. Participant ages ranged from
18 to 47 years (M ¼ 20.94, SD ¼ 3.97). The majority of participants was female (58%)
and Caucasian (63%) followed by Latino (11%), African American (8%), Asian (7%),
Pacific Islander (4%), Multi-Ethic (4%), other (2%), and Native American (1%). Par-
ticipants completed the online questionnaire after verifying that they had been cheated
on during the past 3 months. We chose the past 3 months because we expected the
infidelity would be fresher in the noninvolved partners’ minds and they may have still
been experiencing mental health problems and engaging in health-compromising
behaviors.
Measures
The questionnaire included measures about respondents’ perceptions of the infidelity as
well as perceptions of change in their feelings and physical health behaviors after they
found out that their partners had cheated on them. Descriptive statistics and correlations
for the study variables are presented in Table 1.
Causal attribution of the infidelity. To measure causal attribution of the infidelity, the 3-item
subscale of Fincham and Bradbury’s (1992) relationship attribution measure (RAM) was
used. Similar to Hall and Fincham’s (2006) adapted version of the RAM, the items were
solely regarding infidelity. Participants were instructed to think of how they felt after
they found out that their partners had cheated on them (e.g., “I thought the reason my
partner cheated on me was not likely to change”). Participants rated each item on a scale
from 1 (disagree strongly) to 6 (agree strongly) with higher scores indicating the

 partner’s infidelity was caused by the partner, a stable behavior, and affected other areas
of the relationships. The RAM has shown to be a reliable and valid measure of attri-
butions in relationships (Fincham & Bradbury, 1992), and the causal attribution
dimension of the RAM and has shown reasonable internal consistency (a’s ¼ .63–.93;
Fincham & Bradbury, 1992). Cronbach’s a was .63 in the current study.
Partner blame. The 3-item responsibility-blame subscale of Fincham and Bradbury’s
(1992) RAM was used and also adapted to regard a partner’s infidelity (e.g., “I thought
my partner deserved to be blamed for cheating on me”). Participants rated the three items
on a scale from 1 (disagree strongly) to 6 (agree strongly) with higher scores indicating
higher partner blame. The responsibility-blame dimension of the RAM has shown
adequate internal consistency (a’s ¼ .70–.93; Fincham & Bradbury, 1992) and was
acceptable in the current study (a ¼ .71).
Self-blame. The 9-item self-blame subscale of the Grief Cognitions Questionnaire
(Boelen, van den Bout, & van den Hout, 2003) was used to assess the degree to which
participants blame themselves for their partners’ infidelity. The original measure is used
to assess self-blame after a relationship breakup; therefore, we adapted the items to
assess self-blame after infidelity (e.g., “I blamed myself for not having cared better for
my partner before he/she cheated on me”). The adapted measure was highly reliable (a ¼
.93). Participants rated each item on a scale from 1 (disagree strongly) to 6 (agree
strongly) with higher scores reflecting greater self-blame.
Mental health. To examine perceived change in depression and anxiety symptoms, we
asked participants to rate how much they experienced several mental health symptoms
after their partners’ infidelity compared to their typical experiences. For example, some
participants may have been experiencing mental health issues even before the infidelity
and asking them to simply rate their mental health status following the infidelity would
not tell us if their mental health changed as a consequence of the infidelity. In this way,
assessing change may capture subtle changes for people who regularly experience
mental health symptoms on a daily basis, even before the infidelity. Likewise, although
some people may experience greater mental health symptoms after infidelity, others may
experience growth and therefore fewer symptoms than typically experienced before
being cheated on. Therefore, we assessed change in depression and anxiety symptoms to
assess perceived changes, whether increases or decreases, in their symptoms after the
infidelity.
Change in depression symptoms. The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale–Revised (Eaton, Smith, Ybarra, Mutaner, & Tien, 2004) was used to
measure the perceived change in participants’ depressive symptoms after their partners’
infidelity compared to their typical depressive symptoms (e.g., “My appetite was poor”).
We adapted the response options to measure the degree to which their depression
symptoms increased or decreased after the infidelity compared to their typical experi-
ences. The standard responses options (0 ¼ not at all or less than 1 day during the week
to 4 ¼ nearly every day for 2 weeks) were modified to 1 (this occurred much less than
Shrout and Weigel

 usual) to 7 (this occurred much more than usual) with 4 as the midpoint (no difference/
about the same) to assess change in their depression symptoms after the infidelity.
Cronbach’s a was .93.
Change in anxiety symptoms. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (Spitzer,
Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006) was used to assess the perceived change in parti-
cipants’ anxiety after their partners’ infidelity compared to their typical anxiety (e.g., “I
was not able to stop or control worrying”). Again, we adapted the response options to
measure the degree to which their anxiety symptoms increased or decreased after the
infidelity compared to their typical experiences (a ¼ .92). The response options in the
original scale ranged from 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day) but were changed to 1
(this occurred much less than usual) to 7 (this occurred much more than usual) with 4 as
the midpoint (no difference/about the same) to assess change in anxiety symptoms after
the infidelity.
Distress. The 16-item Break-Up Distress Scale (Field et al., 2009) was used to assess
distress after their partners’ infidelity. The original scale was designed to assess distress
after a relationship breakup (e.g., “I feel that life is empty without the person”) but was
adapted in this study to assess distress after a partner’s infidelity (e.g., “I felt that life was
empty after my partner cheated on me”). Participants rated each item on a scale from 1
(disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly), and the measure exhibited an a of .93.
To assess overall mental health consequences following a partner’s infidelity, we
created a composite variable comprising depression, anxiety, and distress symptoms
after the infidelity as suggested by the high correlations among the three variables
(rs ¼ .68–.81). We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify the viability
of a composite mental health variable. The CFA model was fully saturated (i.e., df ¼ 0),
therefore, fit indices were uninformative. However, depression (b ¼ .91), anxiety (b ¼
.89), and distress (b ¼ .75) all had strong loadings on the composite variable. The internal
consistency of the composite mental health measure was high (a ¼ .96). Higher scores
indicate greater perceived mental health consequences following a partner’s infidelity.
Changes in health-compromising behaviors. A 17-item measure was created by the
researchers based on items from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2014) to assess the perceived change in
health-compromising behaviors after their partners’ infidelity compared to their typical
behaviors. Items included drug and alcohol use (e.g., “Alcohol use”), sexual (e.g., “Not
using condoms during sex”), exercise (e.g., “Over-exercising”), and eating behaviors
(e.g., “Eating less or not at all”). The response options measured the change in the
behaviors, ranging from 1 (significantly decreased) to 7 (significantly increased) with 4
as the midpoint (no change). A “not applicable” option was provided for each item as
well (N/A—never engaged in this behavior). For the subsequent analyses, we created a
count variable that assesses the number of health-compromising behaviors in which
participants engaged following their partners’ infidelity. If participants selected an
increase in a behavior (i.e., selected 5–7), we coded that item as 1, whereas if not
applicable, no change, or a decrease in a behavior was selected (i.e., N/A, 1–4), the item
was coded as 0. We then added each of the items together for an overall index of the
10
Journal of Social and Personal Relationships XX(X)
 number of health-compromising behaviors participants reported increases in after their
partners’ infidelity. Scores could range from 0 to 17, with higher scores indicating
greater engagement in health-compromising behaviors after a partner’s infidelity. We
assessed reliability with the Kuder–Richardson 20, which resulted in an internal con-
sistency value of .75.1
Moderating and control variables. Gender and whether or not participants were in a rela-
tionship with the cheating partner were included in the analyses as potential moderators.
We also controlled for the degree to which the infidelity was sexual/physical, the degree
to which the infidelity was emotional, and the relationship length with the cheating
partner because of their potential impact on noninvolved partners’ reactions (Buss et al.,
1999; Pittman, 1989). Sexual/physical and emotional infidelities were assessed with two
questions: (1) to what degree was your partner’s infidelity sexual/physical? (1 [not at all
sexual] to 7 [completely sexual]) and (2) to what degree was your partner’s infidelity
emotional? (1 [not at all emotional] to 7 [completely emotional]).
Results
Preliminary analyses
Means in Table 1 show that noninvolved partners were more likely to blame the partner
than themselves and tended to hold causal attributions about their partner’s infidelity.
They also reported increases in depression, anxiety, and distress following the infidelity.
On average, participants reported an increase in more than 3 health-compromising
behaviors, with increases ranging from 0 to 13 behaviors. The most frequent increases
in health-compromising behaviors were eating less or not at all (45%), alcohol use
(44%), over-exercising (29%), having sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol (27%),
and marijuana use (19%).
In addition, correlations among the main variables were in line with our predictions
(see Table 1). Each of the three appraisal variables (partner blame, self-blame, and causal
attribution) were positively correlated with the composite mental health variable and the
three mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and distress) such that increases in
negative appraisals were associated with more mental health symptoms following the
infidelity. Also, the greater the self-blame, the more likely participants were to be
involved in health-compromising behaviors. Partner blame and causal attribution were
not correlated with health-compromising behaviors. Mental health was also positively
associated with health-compromising behaviors, suggesting that when noninvolved
partners had greater depression, anxiety, and distress following the infidelity, they also
engaged in more health-compromising behaviors. Noninvolved partners who had longer
relationships with the cheating partner also reported experiencing more mental health
consequences after the infidelity. In addition, more emotional infidelities were associ-
ated with greater partner blame, causal attributions, and depressive symptoms. Inde-
pendent samples t-tests showed that there were no significant differences on study
variables by gender or relationship status with the cheating partner.

 Mediational analyses
To test the models specified in Figure 1, we first tested whether mental health mediated
the effects of negative appraisals of the infidelity (partner blame, self-blame, and causal
attributions) on health-compromising behaviors. We then followed up these analyses
with moderated mediational analyses to investigate whether any indirect effects of
appraisals on health-compromising behaviors through mental health were moderated by
gender and relationship status with the cheating partner. We conducted these analyses
using Hayes’ (2013) SPSS PROCESS macro and selected model 4 for the mediation
analyses and model 59 for the moderated mediation analyses. Conditional and indirect
effects were tested with 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals, and the confidence
intervals for the indirect effects were also tested with 10,000 bootstrapped samples.
Moderated mediation was assessed with Hayes’ (2015) index of moderated media-
tion, which was also tested with 10,000 bootstrapped samples and 95% confidence
intervals. Moderated mediation is confirmed if the index of moderated mediation
does not include zero (Hayes, 2015). Continuous variables were mean centered prior
to the moderation analyses to improve interpretability (Aiken & West, 1991), and
interaction terms were computed as the product of the mean centered variables.
Moderated mediation effects were plotted to depict the conditional effects of the
moderator on the indirect effects at one standard deviation above and below the
mean. We also controlled for any influences of the type of infidelity (sexual/physical
and emotional) and relationship length with the cheating partner by entering these three
variables as covariates.
Partner blame, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors. We first tested whether
mental health consequences mediated the relationship between partner blame and health-
compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners following infidelity, as depicted in
Figure 1a, while controlling for the type of infidelity and relationship status with the
cheating partner. Table 2 shows that increases in partner blame were related to increases
in mental health consequences. Although partner blame was not correlated with health-
compromising behaviors, mental health was examined as a potential mediator given that
the predictor and dependent variables do not need to be directly related to test the
presence of an indirect effect (Hayes, 2009). When health-compromising behavior was
regressed onto partner blame and mental health, only mental health predicted health-
compromising behaviors. Results from the bootstrapped analyses showed that mental
health mediated the relationship between partner blame and health-compromising
behaviors (indirect effect ¼ .23, SE ¼ .10, 95% CI [.07, .47]). Hence, partner blame
was related to greater mental health consequences, which was related to more health-
compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners after infidelity.
We then tested the potential moderating effects of gender and relationship status with
the cheating partner on the links between partner blame, mental health, and health-
compromising behaviors, as depicted in Figure 1b. Gender did not alter the effects of
partner blame on mental health nor health-compromising behaviors (lines 1 and 2,
respectively, Figure 1b), however, gender did moderate the effects of mental health on
health-compromising behaviors (line 3, Figure 1b; see Table 3). Additionally, the overall
12
Journal of Social and Personal Relationships XX(X)
 indirect effect of partner blame on health-compromising behaviors through mental
health differed by gender (index of moderated mediation ¼ �.37, SE ¼ .18, 95% CI
[�.77, �.05]). As shown in Figure 2, the indirect effect of partner blame on health-
compromising behaviors through mental health is stronger for women compared to men.
For women, high levels of partner blame led to steeper increases in mental health
consequences, resulting in more health-compromising behaviors (conditional indirect
effect ¼ .40, SE ¼ .13, 95% CI [.18, .72]), whereas men’s partner blame did not have an
indirect effect on engagement in health-compromising behaviors through mental health
(conditional indirect effect ¼ .04, SE ¼ .12, 95% CI [�.16, .32]). In contrast, the
relationships between partner blame, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors
were not dependent upon the relationship status with the cheating partner (index of
moderation mediation ¼ �.01, SE ¼ .22, 95% CI [�.56, .36]).

 Self-blame, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors. Next, we tested whether
mental health mediated the relationship between self-blame and health-compromising
behaviors of noninvolved partners following infidelity while controlling for the type of
infidelity and relationship status with the cheating partner. Results showed that increases
in self-blame were related to increases in mental health consequences (see Table 2), and
although self-blame was correlated with health-compromising behaviors, when health-
compromising behavior was regressed onto self-blame and mental health, only mental

 health predicted health-compromising behaviors. Results from the bootstrapped analyses
revealed that mental health mediated the link between self-blame and health-
compromising behaviors (indirect effect ¼ .22, SE ¼ .09, 95% CI [.08, .41]). Thus,
self-blame was related to greater mental health consequences, which subsequently was
related to more health-compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners.
We also tested the moderating effects of gender and relationship status with the cheating
partner on the associations between self-blame, mental health, and health-compromising
behaviors of noninvolved partners following infidelity (Figure 1b). As with the model for
partner blame, gender did not moderate the effect of self-blame on mental health nor health-
compromising behaviors (see Table 4). However, gender altered the effects of mental health
on health-compromising behaviors (line 3, Figure 1b) and altered the indirect effect of self-
blame on health-compromising behaviors through mental health (index of moderated
mediation ¼ �.38, SE ¼ .19, 95% CI [�.77, �.08]). As depicted in Figure 3, these asso-
ciations were particularly strong for women, such that increases in self-blame led to steeper
increases inmentalhealth symptoms, which subsequentlyled to morehealth-compromising
behaviors (conditional indirect effect ¼ .41, SE ¼ .12, 95% CI [.22, .68]). For men, the
indirect effect of self-blame on health-compromising behaviors through mental health was
not significant (conditional indirect effect ¼ .02, SE ¼ .12, 95% CI [�.26, .24]). Addi-
tionally, relationship status with the cheating partner did not moderate the associations
between self-blame, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors (index of moder-
ated mediation ¼ �.05, SE ¼ .24, 95% CI [�.65, .30]).

 attributions about the infidelity and health-compromising behaviors of noninvolved
partners following infidelity, as depicted in Figure 1a. Results indicated that increases in
causal attributions were related to increases in mental health consequences (see Table 2).
As with partner blame, causal attribution was not correlated with health-compromising
behaviors; however, mental health was examined as a potential mediator. When health-
compromising behaviors were regressed onto mental health and causal attribution, only
mental health predicted health-compromising behaviors. Results from the bootstrapped
analyses showed mental health mediated the link between causal attributions and health-
compromising behaviors (indirect effect ¼ .22, SE ¼ .10, CI [.05, .45]). Thus, increases
in causal attributions were related to more mental health consequences, which in turn
were related to increases in health-compromising behaviors of noninvolved partners
following infidelity.
Once again, we examined the potential moderating effects of gender and relationship
status with the cheating partner on the associations between causal attribution, mental
health, and health-compromising behaviors, as depicted in Figure 1b. Table 5 shows that
gender did not moderate the effects of causal attribution on mental health nor health-
compromising behaviors (lines 1 and 2, respectively, Figure 1b); however, gender
altered the effects of mental health on health-compromising behaviors (line 3, Figure
1b). Although the link between mental health and health-compromising behaviors dif-
fered by gender, the indirect effect of causal attribution on health-compromising beha-
viors through mental health did not depend on gender (index of moderation mediation ¼
�.31, SE ¼ .18, 95% CI [�.68, .01]). That is, the mediating effect of mental health on the
link between causal attribution and health-compromising did not differ for men and
women. Instead, only the link between mental health and health-compromising beha-
viors differed by gender such that men’s health-compromising behaviors did not vary
based upon their mental health, whereas women’s health-compromising behaviors
increased with high levels of mental health consequences. Additionally, relationship

 status with the unfaithful partner did not moderate the indirect effect of causal attribu-
tions on health-compromising behaviors through mental health (index of moderated
mediation ¼ �.25, SE ¼ .27, 95% CI [�.93, .18]).
Alternative models. Although the proposed models were based on transactional stress
theory, it is possible that alternative models might also capture the relationships between
these variables. For example, mental health symptoms may lead to negative appraisals of
a partner’s infidelity, which in turn may result in health-compromising behaviors. We
tested this alternative model for each of the three appraisal variables, which showed that
the indirect effects of mental health on health-compromising behaviors through
appraisals were not significant for partner blame (indirect effect ¼ .11, SE ¼ .07, 95% CI
[�.11, .16]), self-blame (indirect effect ¼ .05, SE ¼ .10, 95% CI [�.14, .27]), nor causal
attribution (indirect effect ¼ .03, SE ¼ .06, 95% CI [�.06, .17]).
It is also plausible that appraisals might be related to increases in health-
compromising behaviors, which then give rise to mental health symptoms following a
partner’s infidelity. We tested the mediation models for the three appraisal variables and
found that partner blame did not have an indirect effect on mental health through health-
compromising behavior (indirect effect ¼ .03, SE ¼ .02, 95% CI [�.01, .08]). Although
there was a small indirect effect of causal attribution on mental health through health-
compromising behaviors (indirect effect ¼ .04, SE ¼ .03, 95% CI [.00, .11]), the path
between causal attribution and health-compromising behaviors was not significant
(coefficient ¼ .37, SE ¼ .20, 95% CI [�.03, .77]), indicating that the indirect effect was

 driven by the strong association between health-compromising behaviors and mental
health and that mediation did not occur. Lastly, there was also a small indirect effect of
self-blame on mental health through health-compromising behaviors (indirect effect ¼
.03, SE ¼ .02, 95% CI [.00, .07]). Although there was a minor mediation effect for the
model with self-blame, taken together, the primary model tested in this study (mental
health mediating the relationship between negative appraisals and health-compromising
behaviors) was significant for all three appraisal variables.
Discussion
This study extended the literature on the health consequences of noninvolved partners
after infidelity by applying a stress framework to understand the impact of appraisals on
perceived mental health and health behavior outcomes. Guided by transactional stress
theory (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984, 1987), we examined whether noninvolved partners’
negative appraisals of the infidelity were associated with poorer mental health and
increased health-compromising behaviors. Specifically, we assessed whether non-
involved partners’ appraisals were indirectly related to health-compromising behaviors
through increased mental health consequences. Further extending the research, we tested
personal and relationship factors that impact the links between appraisals, mental health,
and health-compromising behaviors.
As predicted, findings from the mediation models indicated that effects of negative
appraisals on health-compromising behaviors were transmitted through mental health.
That is, the greater the partner blame, self-blame, and causal attribution of the infidelity,
the more perceived depression, anxiety, and distress symptoms, which in turn were
associated with more health-compromising behaviors. These results are consistent with
previous research showing that noninvolved partners experience negative emotional
reactions following their partners’ infidelity (Bird et al., 2007; Cano & O’Leary, 2000;
Gordon et al., 2004), and extend this line of research by identifying partner blame, self-
blame, and causal attributions as specific appraisals that link a partner’s infidelity to their
depression, anxiety, and distress. Further, this study revealed a connection between
noninvolved partners’ mental health and health-compromising behaviors following the
infidelity, which has been demonstrated in previous work examining physical health
outcomes after other relationship and life stressors (Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007; Lepore
& Greenberg, 2002; Sbarra et al., 2009; Turner, 2010) but until this study has not been
demonstrated in research on infidelity.
These findings fit within the transactional stress framework (Lazarus & Folkman,
1984, 1987). When noninvolved partners had negative appraisals of the infidelity by
blaming their partners, blaming themselves, and attributing the infidelity to internal,
global, and stable causes, those negative appraisals were then linked to poorer mental
health. The noninvolved partners may have perceived that the infidelity occurred
because of something about themselves, their partners, or their relationships; felt a sense
of loss with the friendships with the cheating partners, their investment, and trust in their
relationships; or experienced threat to their personal beliefs about themselves and
relationships. Then, their greater depression, anxiety, and distress were associated with
increased health-compromising behaviors, such as increased alcohol use, drug use, and
18

 unprotected sex. Engaging in these types of health-compromising behaviors might be
explained as an attempt to cope with the infidelity by decreasing their negative feelings
and increasing positive emotions (Glassman et al., 1990; Kelly & Kalichman, 1998).
With respect to potential person and environment moderators, we found that gender is
a key component of noninvolved partners’ mental health and health behavior outcomes
following infidelity. This study revealed that the strength of indirect effects of partner
blame and self-blame on engagement in health-compromising behaviors through mental
health symptoms differed by gender. The mediated effect of mental health was stronger
for women compared to men. That is, women who reported high levels of self-blame or
partner blame also experienced high levels of mental health consequences, which in turn
resulted in even greater health-compromising behavior engagement following a part-
ner’s infidelity. This gender difference is consistent with previous research showing that
women report greater emotional distress following a partner’s infidelity compared to
men (Shackelford et al., 2000; Sweeney & Horwitz, 2001). Additionally, women are
more likely to base their self-construal and identity on their relationships compared to
men (Cross & Madson, 1997). In this way, women who experience more mental health
consequences may also engage in more health-compromising behaviors because their
self-construal and identity might have been damaged by the infidelity.
Therefore, the results generally support the idea that appraisals, mental health, and
health compromising behaviors are interconnected and important within noninvolved
partners’ reactions to infidelity. Although participants in the sample were college stu-
dents and may not be representative of married couples, most participants were invested
in their relationships and committed to their partners. The average relationship length
with the cheating partner was 1.76 years, almost all participants (94%) reported that they
were emotionally attached or in love, and nearly a third had seriously thought about
marriage. Despite the sample consisting of individuals in dating relationships who may
not have had the structural constraints of married couples, most participants were in
serious and committed relationships with strong emotional and time investments. As
such, we would expect that they would still be hurt and experience negative conse-
quences after their partner’s infidelity. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to
assess whether these results differ for older, married adults, potentially with different
norms and expectations that are inherent in marriage.
Also, it is interesting that within 3 months following the occurrence of infidelity, 34%
of the participants were either in a new relationship or dating multiple people. Contrary
to our expectations, however, relationship status with the cheating partner did not modify
the associations between appraisals, mental health, and health-compromising behaviors.
These nonsignificant findings may be explained by the fact that infidelity is one of the
most serious and damaging relationship transgressions, causing distress, anger, and
decreased self-worth and self-esteem for the noninvolved partner (Bird et al., 2007;
Gordon et al., 2004). These intense negative reactions may occur regardless of whether
the noninvolved partner continues the relationship. Although we controlled for the
effects of relationship length with the cheating partner, the relationships of noninvolved
partners after infidelity in our college student sample may differ for those who are older
and married. Further research is needed to examine how post-infidelity relationships
compare between dating and married individuals.

 This study has additional limitations that should be considered when interpreting the
results. One limitation is the use of self-report and retrospective measures. Participants’
recollection of changes in their mental health and behavior engagement following the
infidelity may be biased. However, we attempted to decrease personal bias by restricting
participation to those who had been cheated on within the past 3 months because we
expected the infidelity would be fresher in the noninvolved partners’ minds and they may
have still been experiencing mental health problems and engaging in health-
compromising behaviors. It is also possible that individuals with poor mental health
and who engage in health-compromising behaviors would be in relationships in which
infidelity is likely to occur. We attempted to address this concern by asking participants
about the change in mental health symptoms and health-compromising behaviors after
the infidelity compared to their typical symptoms and behaviors. Although capturing
reactions to infidelity in real time could prove challenging, future research may want to
track ongoing relationships and follow those relationships in which an infidelity sub-
sequently occurs. By doing so, researchers could also explore the nature of noninvolved
partners before infidelity, such as whether they have preexisting mental or physical
health issues.
Another limitation is that the data were cross-sectional and causal inferences about
the directions of these relationships cannot be made. Cross-sectional data, however, can
establish relationships between constructs. Although we cannot establish causality, the
findings are in line with a transactional stress framework as appraisals of the infidelity
are associated both directly and indirectly with mental health consequences and health-
compromising behaviors. Despite the alternative model with self-blame having a small
indirect effect on mental health through health-compromising behaviors, our hypothe-
sized models performed much better and were in line with predictions based on trans-
actional stress theory as well as previous research on the associations between mental
health and health-compromising behaviors (e.g., Walsh et al., 2013). However, future
research should more closely examine the relationship between self-blame and health
following an infidelity.
Additionally, future researchers may want to consider using objective measures of
physical health to examine noninvolved partners’ reactions and behaviors after infide-
lity. For example, a physical measure that might help explain noninvolved partners’
responses to the stress of an infidelity is cortisol reactivity produced by the hypotha-
lamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, a major component of the physiological stress
response. Activation of the HPA axis results in a hormonal response to stress (e.g.,
cortisol), which is related to physical and mental health problems (Sapolsky, 1999).
Future research might consider examining whether negative appraisals of a partner’s
infidelity are related to higher cortisol levels and therefore more physiological stress
compared to those who make positive appraisals.
Despite these limitations, this study opens several avenues for future research. First,
recent research has investigated the possibility of posttraumatic growth after experien-
cing relationship stressors, such as relationship dissolution (e.g., Tashiro & Frazier,
2003). Despite the stress and turmoil of infidelity, some noninvolved partners might
experience growth as they cope. We attempted to examine personal growth following
infidelity by assessing a decrease in health-compromising behaviors (e.g., drinking less,
20

 having more protected sex). However, the number of instances in which participants
reported that a health-compromising behavior decreased was too few, restricting the
variance and ability to create a meaningful variable. Nevertheless, it would be useful to
understand how and why some people experience growth following the trauma of infi-
delity. Similarly, future research could examine positive appraisals of an infidelity, which
may lead to more posttraumatic growth rather than mental health problems and health-
compromising behaviors. In addition, the presence of specific protective factors may
buffer the negative effects of infidelity as well as the negative appraisals. For example,
noninvolved individuals with greater social support, higher self-esteem and self-
confidence, greater life optimism, or a stronger sense of coherence might experience
less mental health issues and fewer health-compromising behaviors following a partner’s
infidelity. Lastly, noninvolved partners’ infidelity history including whether they have
previously been cheated on or cheated themselves may impact their emotional and
physical reactions to an infidelity. Future studies could examine whether such infidelity
history factors influence noninvolved partners’ mental and physical health outcomes.
In sum, the present research makes several contributions. First, this study applied a
stress framework to explain the role of cognitions in noninvolved partners’ mental health
consequences and health-compromising behaviors after infidelity. Viewing infidelity as
a relationship stressor, the results show that appraisals of the partners’ infidelity impact
mental and physical health outcomes of noninvolved partners. Second, the findings
reveal that noninvolved partners’ poorer mental health extends to their physical health
such that depression, anxiety, and distress are associated with increased health-
compromising behaviors after infidelity. Finally, this study may help inform clinical
work on infidelity. Specifically, this research helps inform practitioners that noninvolved
partners’ perceptions and appraisals of the infidelity are important, and that infidelity
affects their physical health behaviors as well as mental health.

Note
1. We also created a variable to assess the degree of increase in health-compromising behaviors.
We coded N/A and response options that indicated a decrease (1–4) as 0, 5 (slightly increased)
as 1, 6 (increased) as 2, and 7 (significantly increased) as 3. We then averaged across the items.
We transformed the variable because it was highly skewed and kurtotic and ran the analyses.
The results, however, were identical to those with the count variable. Therefore, we used the
count variable for increases in health-compromising behaviors in the analyses.
