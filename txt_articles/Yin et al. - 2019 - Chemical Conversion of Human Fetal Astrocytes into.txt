SUMMARY
We have previously developed a cocktail of nine small molecules to convert human fetal astrocytes into neurons, but a nine-molecule
recipe is difficult for clinical applications. Here, we identify a chemical formula with only three to four small molecules for astrocyte-
to-neuron conversion. We demonstrate that modulation of three to four signaling pathways among Notch, glycogen synthase kinase 3,
transforming growth factor b, and bone morphogenetic protein pathways is sufficient to change an astrocyte into a neuron. The
chemically converted human neurons can survive >7 months in culture, fire repetitive action potentials, and display robust synaptic
burst activities. Interestingly, cortical astrocyte-converted neurons are mostly glutamatergic, while midbrain astrocyte-converted neu-
rons can yield some GABAergic neurons in addition to glutamatergic neurons. When administered in vivo through intracranial or intra-
peritoneal injection, the four-drug combination can significantly increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Together, human fetal
astrocytes can be chemically converted into functional neurons using three to four small molecules, bringing us one step forward for
developing future drug therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Neuronal loss is the leading cause of symptoms in pa-
tients with neural injury or neurodegenerative disorders.
Following nerve injury, glial cells including astrocytes,
NG2 cells, and microglia will proliferate and become reac-
tive glial cells to form glial scarring in order to protect
neighboring tissues from further damage (Burda and Sofro-
niew, 2014). However, the continuous presence of glial
scars also inhibits neuronal growth and synaptic transmis-
sion in the injured area (Filous and Silver, 2016; Yiu and He,
2006). Thus, reactive glial cells are a double-edged sword
that can have both neuroprotective and neuroinhibitory
functions during the progression of injury or diseases. Glial
scarring has been widely reported after traumatic brain
injury, stroke, and spinal cord injury, but efforts to remove
the neuroinhibitory effect of glial scarring has only resulted
in limited success (Filous and Silver, 2016; Pekny and
Nilsson, 2005).
We have recently demonstrated that reactive astrocytes
and NG2 cells can be directly reprogrammed into func-
tional neurons inside mouse brains with the expression
of a single neural transcription factor, NEUROD1 (Guo
et al., 2014). Other transcription factors, such as neuroge-
nin 2 (NGN2), ASCL1, and SOX2, have also been reported
to reprogram glial cells into neurons both in vitro and in vivo
(Berninger et al., 2007; Grande et al., 2013; Heinrich et al.,
2010; Liu et al., 2015; Niu et al., 2013; Su et al., 2014; Torper
et al., 2015). Direct conversion from glial cells into neurons
inside the brain or spinal cord without cell transplantation
can avoid the problems of tumor formation, aberrant dif-
ferentiation, and immunorejection that are often associ-
ated with stem cell transplantation (Li and Chen, 2016).
The majority of glia-to-neuron conversion research has
been carried out using virus-mediated ectopic expression
of transcription factors, which requires production of
viruses and sophisticated intracranial or intra-spinal injec-
tion procedures. However, small-molecule-mediated chem-
ical reprogramming has been developed to allow cell trans-
differentiation without viruses (Cao et al., 2016; Cheng
et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al.,
2015, 2016a; Zhao et al., 2015). Our lab recently developed
a chemical protocol to reprogram human astrocytes (HAs)
into functional neurons using a cocktail of nine small mol-
ecules (Zhang et al., 2015). These nine molecules need to be
sequentially administered to reprogram HAs into neurons,
making its clinical translation quite difficult due to the
large number of small molecules used and the complicated
timing of drug application.
In this study, we identify a chemical protocol composed
of only three to four small molecules (DAPT, CHIR99021,
SB431542, and LDN193189) that can more efficiently
reprogram HAs into neurons. By substituting each of these
four drugs (core drugs) with functional analogs, we demon-
strate that simultaneous modulation of four signaling
pathways including Notch, glycogen synthase kinase 3b
(GSK-3b), transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), and
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways, is sufficient
to reprogram HAs into neurons. Even modulating three
out of the four signaling pathways can convert HAs into

 neurons. Our chemically converted human neurons are
highly functional and can survive >7 mo in cell culture.
Moreover, when applied in vivo, core drugs significantly in-
crease the adult neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus.
Therefore, we have identified a simple chemical formula
for astrocyte-to-neuron conversion, bringing us one step
closer toward developing future drug therapy for brain
repair.
RESULT
Identification of Four Core Drugs for Astrocyte-to-
Neuron Conversion
We have recently identified a combination of nine small
molecules, including
SB431542,
LDN193189,
TTNPB,
Thiazovivin, CHIR99021,
DAPT, valproic acid (VPA),
smoothened agonist (SAG), and purmorphamine (Purmo),
to reprogram human fetal astrocytes into functional neu-
rons (Zhang et al., 2015). However, for therapeutic purpose,
a nine-molecule cocktail added in a sequential manner is
rather difficult to translate into clinical applications.
Here, to search for a more practical formula for chemical
reprogramming, we purchased human fetal astrocytes
(HA1800) from ScienCell (San Diego, CA) as described pre-
viously (Zhang et al., 2015). Because human fetal astrocytes
might contain neuroprogenitors, we have subcultured the
astrocytes for at least ten generations in the presence of
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to minimize progenitors
(Zhang et al., 2015). After more than ten passages, the ma-
jority of our astrocytes were immunopositive for astrocytic
markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP), S100b,
and glutamine synthetase (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A), but
rarely for neuroprogenitor markers SOX2 (Figures S1B
and S1C) and NESTIN (Figures S2E and S2F). Long-term
culture of our HAs in neural differentiation medium for

 1 month also rarely yielded any neurons (Figures S1D and
S1E). At the transcriptome level (Figure S1F), in comparison
with published datasets on HAs (Zhang et al., 2016b) or hu-
man neural stem cells (hNSCs) (Modrek et al., 2017), our
HA samples (red box, GSE123397) were closely related to
the fetal astrocytes from human brain, but clearly different
from the hNSCs (green box). Figure S1G shows the heat-
map of gene expression of typical astrocyte and NSC
markers. Our HA samples showed low expression of
STMN1, DLX1, and NES but high expression of FN1,
COL1A1, VIM, and MYC, which was opposite to that of
hNSCs. Together, the significant difference between our
HA samples and NSCs suggests that after ten passages in
10% FBS, neuroprogenitors are minimized in our HA
cultures.
After characterizing HA properties, we repeated and
confirmed successful chemical conversion of HAs into
neurons using the nine-molecule cocktail (Zhang et al.,
2015) (Figures 1C and 1D). We then investigated how to
reduce the number of drugs for chemical reprogramming
by studying the effect of each individual drug among
the nine-molecule cocktail. Interestingly, four molecules
including SB431542 (S), LDN193189 (L), CHIR99021
(C), and DAPT (D) appeared to be most critical in main-
taining high reprogramming efficiency (Zhang et al.,
2015). Therefore, we tested these four drugs (SLCD)
together to determine their reprogramming capability.
Unexpectedly, when we applied SB431542 (5 mM) and
LDN193189 (0.25 mM) for 2 days, and then replaced
with CHIR99021 (1.5 mM) and DAPT (5 mM) for 4 days,
it yielded more neurons than the nine-drug formula (Fig-
ures 1E and 1G). When we applied the four drugs (SLCD)
altogether for 6 days, it yielded even more neurons (Fig-
ures 1F–1H). Quantitatively, the neuronal yield (converted
neurons/astrocyte number before drug treatment) reached
71% when the four drugs (SLCD) were applied together
(Figures S1H and S1I). Therefore, the four drugs together
(SLCD) are referred as ‘‘core drugs’’ hereafter, and the
core drug-converted neurons are referred to as induced
neurons or ‘‘iNs’’ to be consistent with other studies
(Yang et al., 2011). It is worth mentioning that the chem-
ically converted iNs and the remaining non-converted as-
trocytes formed a neuron-astrocyte co-culture condition,
with the iNs migrating onto the surface of astrocytes,
and the astrocytes served as a feeder layer to promote
neuronal survival and maturation (Figure S1J) (Tang
et al., 2013).
We then performed a lineage-tracing experiment using
GFAP:GFP retroviruses to label HAs with GFP before
drug treatment (Figure S2A). The GFP-labeled astrocytes
became NeuN+ (RBFOX3) neurons after core drug treat-
ment (Figure S2A, top row), but remained GFAP+ astro-
cytes in the DMSO control group (Figure S2A, bottom
row). To observe the astrocyte-to-neuron conversion pro-
cess, we performed long-term time-lapse imaging for eight
consecutive days on a group of GFP-labeled HAs during
and after core drug treatment (Video S1). As shown in
the video, the initial flat HAs infected with GFP lentivi-
ruses gradually changed their morphology into neuron-
like cells with extended long neurites after core drug treat-
ment
(see
Video
S1
in
Supplemental
Information).
Following
time-lapse
imaging,
we
further
performed
post-fix immunostaining and confirmed that the GFP-
labeled neuron-like cells after core drug treatment were
indeed immunopositive for NeuN (Figure S2B). Impor-
tantly, we did not observe significant cell proliferation
during the 8 days of time-lapse imaging (Video S1),
consistent with the Ki67 immunostaining results showing
an inhibition of cell proliferation by core drug treatment
(Figures S2C and S2D, �130 Ki67+ cells/field before drug
treatment and �10 Ki67+ cells/field after drug treatment).
Moreover, NESTIN staining rarely showed neuroprogeni-
tor cells induced by core drugs (Figures S2E and S2F).
Together, through lineage tracing, time-lapse imaging,
and Ki67 and NESTIN staining, we show that HAs can
be directly converted into neurons by four molecules.
Can HAs spontaneously turn into neurons during our
experimental process? To test this idea, we performed
DCX and TUJ1 (TUBB3) staining but did not observe a sig-
nificant number of newborn neurons in the DMSO control
group from day 2 to day 7 (Figures S3A and S3B, quantified
in Figures S3C–S3F). In the core drug-treated group, DCX
and TUJ1 signals did not change much at day 2 and
day 4, but dramatically increased at day 7 (Figures S3A–
S3F), suggesting that it takes �1 week for HAs to be chem-
ically converted into neurons. At day 14 of the DMSO
control group, we did see a few neurons, which were elim-
inated if the N2 supplement was removed from the culture
medium (Figures S3G–S3J), suggesting that the N2 supple-
ment may have a very weak neural induction role in cell
cultures.
We further tested whether our core drugs could repro-
gram different sources of HAs into neurons. After purchas-
ing a different line of HAs from Lonza (cc-2565), we found
that our core drugs (4-day treatment of 2.5 mM SB431542,
0.125 mM LDN193189, 0.75 mM CHIR99021, and 2.5 mM
DAPT) also induced a large number of iNs (Figures S3K–
S3N, immunostained at day 10). Therefore, we conclude
that HAs from different sources can be chemically con-
verted into neurons.
Transcriptional Regulation and MECP2-REST
Signaling Change during Chemical Reprogramming
What is the molecular mechanism underlying the core
drug reprogramming? Our real-time PCR experiments
showed that the basic-helix-loop-helix neural transcription
490

 factors, including both NEUROD1 and NGN2, were signif-
icantly upregulated at day 1 and day 4 by core drug treat-
ment (Figures 2A and 2B), whereas the astrocytic GFAP
expression was downregulated (Figure S4A). Interestingly,
each individual drug among the four core drugs upregu-
lated NGN2 level (Figure 2A), and the NEUROD1 level was
upregulated by LDN193189, SB431542, and DAPT (Fig-
ure 2B). VPA, an HDAC inhibitor that alters histone acety-
lation and gene transcription, was found to induce a signif-
icant increase of both NEUROD1 and NGN2 expression
Figure 2. Transcriptional Regulation during Chemical Reprogramming
(A and B) Real-time qPCR analyses revealed transcriptional activation of NGN2 (A) and NEUROD1 (B) by core drug treatment. Note than
NGN2 was activated earlier than NEUROD1, and that the core drug group showed higher levels of NGN2 and NEUROD1 than the nine-drug
group. Among individual drugs, SB431542, CHIR99021, LDN193189, DAPT, and VPA increased NGN2 to a significant level, whereas
SB431542, LDN193189, DAPT, TTNPB, and VPA significantly increased the expression of NEUROD1. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,

 (Figures 2A and 2B). However, when VPA was added
together
with
the
four
core
drugs,
it
unexpectedly
decreased the reprogramming efficiency (Figures S4B and
S4C). We then further tested core drugs in combination
with other individual drugs including ROCK inhibitor
Tzv, retinoic acid receptor agonist TTNPB, sonic hedgehog
activator SAG, and Purmo. Addition of Tzv to the core
drugs showed no effect (Figure S4D), while addition of
TTNPB decreased the reprogramming efficiency (Figure S4E
and quantified in S4G). Addition of SAG and Purmo signif-
icantly increased astrocytic proliferation, resulting in
overgrown astrocytes and decrease of neurons (data not
shown). These results suggest that alteration of extra
signaling pathways in addition to the four pathways modu-
lated by core drugs might result in reduced conversion
efficiency.
Besides
transcriptional
regulation
of
NGN2
and
NEUROD1, we further discovered a significant change of
REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor) and MECP2
(methyl CpG binding protein 2) signals during core drug-
mediated chemical reprogramming (Figures 2C–2F). REST
is a transcriptional repressor that can silence neuronal
genes in stem cells and non-neuronal cells (Ballas et al.,
2005). During neuronal differentiation, REST is downregu-
lated in neurons. We found a significant decrease of REST
expression
during
chemical
reprogramming
process,
particularly in Tuj1+ neurons (Figure 2C, quantified in Fig-
ure 2E), indicating the suppression of REST by core drugs
during chemical conversion. In contrast, the expression
level of MECP2, a nuclear protein that can regulate the
expression of many genes including suppressing REST
(Skene et al., 2010), increased significantly after core drug
treatment (Figure 2D, quantified in Figure 2F). MECP2
has been reported to be highly expressed in neurons,
much more than that in astrocytes (Kishi and Macklis,
2004; Skene et al., 2010). Consistently, we found that the
increase of MECP2 signal was coinciding with an increase
of Tuj1 and a decrease of GFAP signal after core drug
treatment. Together, the changes of REST and MECP2
expression level indicate a cell fate change from astrocytes
to neurons induced by core drug treatment.
Neuronal Identity after Core Drug Reprogramming
We next characterized the neuronal identity after chemical
reprogramming by performing immunostaining on a series
of neuronal markers. The core drug-converted human neu-
rons (3 months after drug treatment) were mainly immu-
nopositive for PROX1, CTIP2 (BCL11B), and TBR1 (Figures
3A–3C), but negative for other neuronal markers such as
CUX1, NURR1 (NR4A2), and HOXB4 (Figures 3D–3G;
quantified in Figure 3H). These results were further
confirmed with real-time PCR analysis (Figure 3I). When
examining neurotransmitter subtypes, we found that the
majority of neurons converted from human cortical astro-
cytes were immunopositive for VGlut1 (SLC17A7) (78%), a
glutamatergic neuron marker, but very few were GABAergic
(GAD67 [GAD1], 2%) or dopaminergic neurons (TH, 1%)
(Figures 3J–3M). However, when testing our core drug com-
bination in midbrain HAs (ScienCell, 1850), we found a
large proportion of converted iNs co-expressing GABA
and GAD67 (Figure S5A–S5F), suggesting that different lin-
eages of astrocytes originated from different brain regions
may be chemically converted into different subtypes of
iNs. Therefore, human cortical astrocytes can be converted
into cortical glutamatergic neurons, and different lineages
of astrocytes may have their own intrinsic factors to influ-
ence the final cell fate after conversion.
Functional Characterization of Core
Drug-Converted iNs
We further investigated whether the core drug-converted
iNs were functionally connected to each other. Different
from mouse neuron cultures, we found that the core
drug-converted
human
neurons
could
survive
for
3–7 months in our cell culture condition and form robust
synaptic connections (Figures 4A and 4B). Some core
drug-converted human neurons could survive as long as
7.5 months (Figure 4B), providing an extended time win-
dow for future studies on drug screening or disease
modeling. Functionally, patch-clamp recordings revealed
that our chemically converted iNs showed large sodium
and potassium currents (Figure 4C) as well as repetitive ac-
tion potentials (Figure 4F). As expected, converted iNs
showed a clear developmental time course of functional
maturation when analyzed from 1- to 3-month cultures
after chemical conversion. Specifically, sodium currents
increased from 1 nA at 1-month culture to 3 nA at 3-month
culture, while potassium currents increased from �2 nA at
1-month culture to �3.5 nA at 3-month culture (Figures 4D
and 4E). The number of cells firing repetitive action poten-
tials increased from 12/35 at 1-month culture to 27/29 at
3-month culture (Figure 4G). The membrane capacitance
also
increased
(Figure
S5G,
indicating
cell
growth),
together with a decrease of membrane resistance (Fig-
ure S5H, an indication of channel and receptor expression)
from 1- to 3-month cultures. We also detected glutamate-
and GABA-induced receptor currents in 2-month-old con-
verted iNs (Figure 4H), which was consistent with the im-
munostaining of glutamate receptors (GluR1 and GluR2
subunits) (Figures S5J and S5K) and GABAA receptors (g2
and a5 subunits) (Figures S5L and S5M). Moreover, we re-
corded robust spontaneous synaptic activities, some in
burst activity pattern, in 3-month-old cultures after chem-
ical conversion (Figure 4I), suggesting the formation of a
highly integrated neural network among the converted
iNs. Notably, most of the synaptic events were blocked by
492
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 12 j 488–501 j March 5, 2019
 glutamate receptor antagonist DNQX (Figure 4I), consis-
tent with their glutamatergic identity shown in Figure 3.
Therefore, the four core drugs (SLCD) can chemically repro-
gram HAs into highly functional neurons.
Signaling Pathways Critical for Chemical
Reprogramming
After identifying the four core drugs (SLCD), we further
tested whether these particular four drugs were unique
for chemical reprogramming, or rather they could be re-
placed by other functional analogs modulating similar
signaling pathways. For example, SB431542 is a TGF-b in-
hibitor and inhibits a subfamily of activin receptor-like
kinase (ALK) receptors including ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7
(Inman et al., 2002). We therefore substituted SB431542
with its functional analogs Repsox (1 mM) or A-8301
(0.25 mM), which also inhibit TGF-b pathway. Interestingly,
we found that HAs were also efficiently reprogramed into
neurons by substituting SB431542 with Repsox or A-8301
among the four-drug combination (Figures 5A–5C). Thus,
inhibiting the TGF-b signaling pathway in general, rather
than any particular inhibitor, is critical for chemical reprog-
ramming. Similarly, replacing LDN193189, an inhibitor of
BMP through inhibiting another ALK subfamily (ALK2 and
ALK3), with other two BMP inhibitors Dorsomorphin
(1 mM) or DMH 1 (1.5 mM), also resulted in a significant
neuronal reprogramming (Figures 5D–5F). CHIR99021 is
a selective inhibitor of GSK-3 and indirectly activates the
WNT signaling pathway. CHIR99021 has been used in
several studies to generate neurons from ESCs or iPSCs

resented in means ± SEM. N = 3 batches.

 (Fasano et al., 2010; Kriks et al., 2011), and WNT has
been shown to regulate postnatal and adult neurogenesis
(Lie et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). Replacement of
CHIR99021 by two other GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763
(1 mM; different from TGF-b inhibitor SB431542) or AR-
A014418 (6 mM), resulted in a large number of neurons
but less than the effect of CHIR99021 itself (Figures 5G–
5I). Lastly, DAPT inhibits Notch signaling pathway by tar-
geting g-secretase and is involved in the maintenance of
the proliferative and undifferentiated state of embryonic
stem cells during development (Urban and Guillemot,
2014). Replacing DAPT with other two Notch inhibitors,
BMS906024 (2 mM) or RO4929097 (0.5 mM), resulted in
comparable reprogramming efficiency (Figures 5J–5L), sug-
gesting an important role of Notch signaling in neuronal
conversion.
After
testing
each
individual
signaling
pathway with at least three different inhibitors, we re-
placed all of the original four core drugs (SLCD) with their
functional analogs, Repsox, Dorsomorphin, SB216763,
and RO4929097 (RDSRo). The four functional analogs
(RDSRo) together also generated a large number of
converted iNs, with the conversion efficiency reaching
�70% of the original core drug group (Figures 5M–5O).
Similar to the core drug group (SLCD), the RDSRo group
also induced mainly glutamatergic neurons but not
GABAergic or dopaminergic neurons (Figures S6A–S6C)

 and formed local synaptic connections (Figure S6D).
Consistently, real-time PCR analysis revealed that both
core drug group or their various substitution groups all
downregulated glial genes such as Glt1 (SLC1A2) (Figures
S6E and S6F). Furthermore, real-time PCR experiments
identified significant changes of gene targets that are
correlated with the four signaling pathways, including
NEUROGENIN 1 for the GSK-3b pathway (Hirabayashi
et al., 2004), UNC13A for the Notch pathway (Li et al.,
2012), ID1 for the BMP pathway (Morikawa et al., 2011),
and COL1A1 for the TGF-b pathway (Verrecchia et al.,
2001) (Figure S6G). Altogether, these results suggest that
modulation of four signaling pathways including TGF-b,
BMP, GSK-3, and Notch in HAs is sufficient for reprogram-
ming into functional neurons.
Further Down-Selection of Small Molecules for
Chemical Reprogramming
To investigate whether the four-drug cocktail (SLCD) is the
minimal combination capable of reprogramming HAs into
neurons, we further tested all possible combinations of
three drugs, two drugs, and each individual drug, among
the four-drug cocktail (SLCD). Interestingly, all three-drug
combinations were capable of reprogramming HAs into
Figure 5. Drug Replacement Revealed Key Signaling Pathways Involved in Chemical Reprogramming
(A–C) Among core drugs, replacing SB431542 with its functional analog A-8301 (A) or Repsox (B) yielded similar numbers of re-
programmed neurons (87% ± 4% for A-8301 and 89% ± 6% for Repsox replacement group) (C). Immunostaining of NEUN was performed
14 days after the start of drug treatment.
(D–F) Replacing LDN193189 with its functional analog DMH 1 (D) or Dorsomorphin (E) resulted in similar conversion efficiency (70% ± 5%
for DMH 1 and 97% ± 1% for Dorsomorphin) (F).
(G–I) Replacing CHIR99021 with its functional analog ARA014418 (G) or SB216763 (H) yielded less numbers of neurons (57% ± 4% for
ARA014418 and 76% ± 3% for SB216763) (I).
(J–L) Replacing DAPT with its functional analog BMS906024 (J) or RO4929097 (K) also achieved similar conversion efficiency (81% ± 1%
for BMS906024 and 95% ± 5% for RO4929097) (L).
(M–O) Replacing the four core drugs (M) with their corresponding functional analogs RDSRo (N, SB431542 replaced by Repsox, LDN193189
by Dorsomorphin, CHIR99021 by SB216763, and DAPT by RO4929097) resulted in lower reprogramming efficiency (66% ± 16%) (O).

 neurons but with lower efficiency compared with the four-
drug group (Figures 6A–6E). Notably, the combination of
three drugs SB431542/CHIR99021/DAPT reached >80%
of the four-drug efficiency (Figure 6Q, One-way ANOVA
followed with post hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison
test, n R 3 batches). On the other hand, all combinations
of two drugs showed significantly diminished reprogram-
ming efficiency, with the highest one (LDN193189/
CHIR99021) still <40% of that induced by the four-drug
cocktail (Figures 6F–6K, quantified in Figure 6Q). None of
the individual drugs among the four core drugs showed
any significant difference from the DMSO control (Fig-
ure 6L–6P, quantified in Figure 6Q). real-time PCR analysis
also showed that the core drugs and combinations of three
or two drugs all downregulated astrocytic genes such as
S100b and Glast (SLC1A3) (Figures S6H–S6I). These studies
demonstrate that HAs may be chemically reprogrammed
into neurons by simultaneously modulating at least three

 or two signaling pathways, but not by changing a single
signaling pathway.
Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis through In Vivo
Administration of Small Molecules
With successful conversion of cultured HAs into neurons
in vitro, we then injected the core drugs into mouse brains
to test whether they can convert astrocytes into neurons
in vivo. After spending several years using various methods
to deliver small molecules in the mouse brain in vivo, we
have not achieved definitive success of chemical conver-
sion inside mouse brains despite the observation of a few
neurons after chemical treatment. This is rather disap-
pointing, but we are still continuously trying direct in vivo
chemical conversion in the mouse brain. The biggest chal-
lenge for in vivo chemical conversion is how to maintain a
constant concentration of small molecules inside the brain
without causing a severe invasive damage to the brain. We
have tried using biomaterial to encapsulate small mole-
cules, but, perhaps because our small molecules are too
small or we have not found the right biomaterial for such
small molecules, the small molecules we applied might
not stay for a long time inside the brain. We also tried an
osmotic minipump (Alzet) but the tip of the insertion
caused significant tissue damage inside the brain, and the
injury induced many DCX+ cells that were mainly reactive
astrocytes 2 weeks after drug treatment (Figures S7I–S7K).
On the other hand, during our vigorous testing of in vivo
chemical reprogramming, we accidentally found that
core drugs significantly increased adult neurogenesis in
the mouse hippocampus (Figure 7). We initially injected
core drugs through intracranial injection into the hippo-
campus and sacrificed the mice 7 days later (Figure 7A).
We observed remarkable increase of DCX-labeled newborn
neurons together with Ki67-labeled proliferative cells
in the dentate granule layer (Figures 7B–7E). When sepa-
rating the four core drugs into two-drug combinations
(CHIR99021 + DAPT; and SB431542 + LDN193189), we
found that the two-drug combinations could also increase
adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Figures S7A–S7H). How-
ever, the four drugs together were more potent in promot-
ing neuronal maturation, as shown by more complex den-
dritic morphology and more neurons migrated into the
outer granule layer (Figures S7A–S7H).
We next further tested whether our core drugs can pass
through blood-brain barrier (BBB) to regulate adult neuro-
genesis through intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (daily
i.p. injection of core drugs for 3 weeks, and bromodeoxyur-
idine (BrdU) was i.p. injected every 3–4 days from day 5 to
day 26 to identify newborn cells) (Figure 7F). It is important
to note that the intracranial injection of core drugs was
one-time injection, whereas the i.p. injection was repeat in-
jections over 3 weeks. Interestingly, i.p. injection of core
drugs also resulted in a significant increase of DCX-labeled
newborn neurons and Ki67-positive cells in the dentate
granule layer (Figures 7G–7J). Moreover, BrdU-labeled cells
that were dually immunopositive for DCX or NEUN
increased significantly after i.p. injection of core drugs (Fig-
ures 7K–7N), with more newborn neurons migrating to-
ward the outer layer of the dentate granule layer than in
control group (Figure 7M, arrowhead), suggesting an accel-
erated neuronal maturation after core drug treatment.
These results suggest that core drugs can regulate adult neu-
rogenesis in vivo.
DISCUSSION
In this work, we identified a chemical formula using only
three to four small molecules to reprogram HAs into neu-
rons. Through replacement of different functional analogs,
we demonstrate that modulating multiple signaling path-
ways, but not a single signaling pathway, is important for
chemical reprogramming of astrocytes into neurons. The
chemically converted iNs can survive more than 7 months
and are highly functional with bursts of synaptic activities.
Besides upregulation of neural transcription factors such as
NEUROD1 and NGN2, we found that the neural suppressor
gene REST was significantly downregulated, while MECP2
was upregulated during chemical conversion. During our
attempt to chemically convert astrocytes into neurons in
the mouse brain in vivo, we accidentally discovered that
our core drugs can potently regulate adult neurogenesis
in the mouse hippocampus. Together, our chemical for-
mula with only three to four small molecules to reprogram
HAs into neurons brings us one step closer toward a poten-
tial drug therapy for brain repair.
One discovery made in this study is the synergistic mod-
ulation of multiple signaling pathways that are critical for
chemical reprogramming. Modulating a single signaling
pathway alone is not sufficient to change the cell fate. For
example, while CHIR99021 alone increased NGN2 by 120-
fold, it did not convert astrocytes into neurons, suggesting
that modulating a single signaling pathway is not sufficient

 for chemical conversion. Nevertheless, CHIR99021 is one
of the most widely used small molecules in chemical reprog-
ramming studies (Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al.,
2015). Application of SB431542 and LDN193189 together
has been reported to induce neurogenesis from stem cells
(Chambers et al., 2009), but they are not sufficient to repro-
gram HAs into neurons, suggesting that HAs, as terminally
differentiated cells, are very different from neural stem cells
in terms of reprogrammability. By substituting each core
drug with its functional analogs, we further demonstrate
that it is not the specific drugs (SLCD) per se but rather
the four signaling pathways (Notch, GSK-3b, TGF-b, and
BMP) that are regulated by the four core drugs are critical
for chemical reprogramming. Interestingly, modulating
any three out of the four signaling pathways can success-
fully reprogram HAs into neurons, suggesting that these
four pathways may have some overlapping functions. It is
worth mentioning that, during the progress of this study,
Dr. Pei’s group reported that human adult astrocytes iso-
lated from patients with brain tumor can be reprogrammed
into neurons by a six-small-molecule cocktail VCRFBI (VPA,
CHIR99021, Repsox, forskolin, i-Bet151, and ISX-9) (Gao
et al., 2017). This is a very interesting work because it repre-
sents another major step toward a future clinical applica-
tion to directly convert adult HAs into neurons using a
drug approach. On the other hand, it should be cautioned
that any astrocytes isolated from the brain andput intoPetri
dishes may lose their in vivo identity. Therefore, it is still
pivotal to test whether small molecules can convert HAs
directly in a brain circuit in vivo. Interestingly, we have un-
expectedly found that in vivo injection of the core drugs can
significantly increase adult neurogenesis in the mouse hip-
pocampus. This finding of small molecules passing through
the BBB and regulating adult neurogenesis may have impor-
tant implications for future development of drug therapies.
Another discovery of this study is that, regardless of nine-
or four-molecule cocktails, a common outcome of our
chemical reprogramming protocols is the upregulation of
neural transcription factors NEUROD1 and NGN2. Consis-
tent with our discovery, recent work on chemical reprog-
ramming of cultured fibroblasts or astrocytes into neurons
also reported an upregulation of NEUROD1 and NGN2
together with other transcription factors (Cheng et al.,
2015; Gao et al., 2017; Li et al., 2015). Therefore, it seems
that our chemical reprogramming approach is an upstream
process that may trigger the upregulation of neural tran-
scription factors, which then carry on the reprogramming
process. Furthermore, we and other groups have reported
that
overexpression
of
neural
transcription
factors
NEUROD1 (Guo et al., 2014) and NGN2 (Heinrich et al.,
2010) can both convert astrocytes into glutamatergic neu-
rons. Interestingly, both our nine- and four-molecule cock-
tails convert HAs mainly into glutamatergic neurons as
well (Zhang et al., 2015), possibly through the upregulation
of NEUROD1 and NGN2. Dr. Pei’s group recently also re-
ported that a six-drug cocktail (VCRFBI) converted adult
HAs into glutamatergic neurons associated with upregula-
tion of neural transcription factors including NEUROD1
and NGN2 (Gao et al., 2017). Notably, our nine-drug cock-
tail generated a small percentage of GABAergic neurons but
a four-drug cocktail did not, suggesting that the small mol-
ecules removed in this current study (TTNPB, SAG/Purmo,
VPA, TZV) might be responsible for the small number of
GABAergic neurons. Further work is needed to find various
chemical cocktails that can reprogram HAs into other
neuronal subtypes such as GABAergic and dopaminergic
neurons. In addition, besides the four signaling pathways
identified in this study, other signaling pathways that
may also be important for chemical reprogramming of as-
trocytes into neurons, or to reprogram other glial cells
such as NG2 glia into neurons, should be investigated.
In summary, this study reveals a drug formula that uses
only three or four small molecules to efficiently reprogram
HAs into functional neurons. Such a simple chemical re-
programming protocol makes it possible to develop a
potentially useful drug therapy for neuroregeneration and
brain repair, although great challenges such as chemical
toxicity and CNS drug delivery are yet to be solved in future
studies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
Human cortical astrocytes purchased from ScienCell (1800, San
Diego, CA) and Lonza (cc-2565) were subcultured as described pre-
viously (Guo et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). In brief, HAs were
cultured in a medium (HA medium) containing DMEM/F12
(Gibco), 10% FBS (Gibco), B27 supplements (Gibco), 3.5 mM
Glucose (Sigma), 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) (Alo-
mone Labs), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Alomone Labs),
and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). The human cortical astro-
cytes used in this study were subjected to 10–15 passages after pur-
chasing from ScienCell, and 6–10 passages after purchasing from
Lonza.
To examine whether HAs (ScienCell, 1800) contain any neural
progenitor cells (NPCs), we cultured the cells in neuronal differen-
tiation medium for 1 month and then performed immunostaining
on different cell markers. As a positive control, human NPCs (gift
from Dr. Fred Gage) were cultured on the coverslips coated with
1% Matrigel (Gibco), in NPC proliferation medium containing
DMEM/F12, penicillin/streptomycin, B27 supplement, N2 supple-
ment, and FGF2 (20 ng/mL).
Reprogramming HAs to Neurons
HAs were seeded onto coverslips (12 mm) pre-coated with poly-D-
lysine (Sigma) in 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) and cultured in
HA medium until reaching �90% confluence. One day before

 reprogramming, half of the HA medium was changed to N2 me-
dium, which contained DMEM/F12, N2 supplements (Gibco),
and penicillin/streptomycin. The following day, the culture me-
dium would be totally changed to N2 medium, together with small
molecules or vehicle control (0.2% DMSO). The culture medium
and drugs were refreshed three times every 2 days. In the core
drug together group, SB431542, LDN193189, CHIR99021, and
DAPT were always applied together to HAs. In the core drug
sequential group, SB431542 and LDN193189 were added for
2 days, and then replaced by CHIR99021 and DAPT for another
4 days. In both groups, at 6 days after drug treatment, the culture
medium was changed to neuronal differentiation medium consist-
ing of DMEM/F12, N2, B27, 0.5% FBS, 1 mM Y-27632 (Tocris),
5 mg/mL vitamin C, and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). To pro-
mote long-term neuronal maturation, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) (10 ng/mL, Invitrogen), neurotrophin-3 (NT3)
(10 ng/mL, Invitrogen) and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
(20 ng/mL, Invitrogen) were added into the neuronal differentia-
tion medium. Importantly, 200 mL medium with BDNF, NT3, and
IGF-1 was added to each well every week to prevent the osmolarity
change caused by medium evaporation and to keep the total me-
dium volume around 2 mL in 24-well plates.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using Student’s t test for two-group compari-
son, and one-way ANOVA for multiple-group comparison followed
by Dunnett’s post hoc test in GraphPad. Dunnett’s post hoc was cho-
sen here because of its power in comparing every mean with a con-
trol mean. All data are represented as means ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p <
0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
