Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 
1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators*
Summary
Background Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability, but its overall association with health remains 
complex given the possible protective effects of moderate alcohol consumption on some conditions. With our 
comprehensive approach to health accounting within the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2016, we generated improved estimates of alcohol use and alcohol-attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-
years (DALYs) for 195 locations from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age groups between the ages of 
15 years and 95 years and older. 
Methods Using 694 data sources of individual and population-level alcohol consumption, along with 592 prospective 
and retrospective studies on the risk of alcohol use, we produced estimates of the prevalence of current drinking, 
abstention, the distribution of alcohol consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks daily (defined as 10 g 
of pure ethyl alcohol), and alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs. We made several methodological improvements 
compared with previous estimates: first, we adjusted alcohol sales estimates to take into account tourist and 
unrecorded consumption; second, we did a new meta-analysis of relative risks for 23 health outcomes associated with 
alcohol use; and third, we developed a new method to quantify the level of alcohol consumption that minimises the 
overall risk to individual health. 
Findings Globally, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs in 2016, accounting for 
2·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1·5–3·0) of age-standardised female deaths and 6·8% (5·8–8·0) of age-
standardised male deaths. Among the population aged 15–49 years, alcohol use was the leading risk factor globally in 
2016, with 3·8% (95% UI 3·2–4·3) of female deaths and 12·2% (10·8–13·6) of male deaths attributable to alcohol 
use. For the population aged 15–49 years, female attributable DALYs were 2·3% (95% UI 2·0–2·6) and male 
attributable DALYs were 8·9% (7·8–9·9). The three leading causes of attributable deaths in this age group were 
tuberculosis (1·4% [95% UI 1·0–1·7] of total deaths), road injuries (1·2% [0·7–1·9]), and self-harm (1·1% [0·6–1·5]). 
For populations aged 50 years and older, cancers accounted for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths 
in 2016, constituting 27·1% (95% UI 21·2–33·3) of total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9% (15·3–22·6) of 
male deaths. The level of alcohol consumption that minimised harm across health outcomes was zero (95% UI 0·0–0·8) 
standard drinks per week.
Interpretation Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for global disease burden and causes substantial health loss. We 
found that the risk of all-cause mortality, and of cancers specifically, rises with increasing levels of consumption, and 
the level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero. These results suggest that alcohol control policies might 
need to be revised worldwide, refocusing on efforts to lower overall population-level consumption.

Introduction 
Alcohol use has a complex association with health. 
Researchers have recognised alcohol use as a leading risk 
factor for disease burden, and studies link its consumption 
to 60 acute and chronic diseases.1–3 Additionally, some 
research suggests that low levels of alcohol consumption 
can have a protective effect on ischaemic heart disease, 
diabetes, and several other outcomes.4–6 This finding 
remains an open question, and recent studies have 
challenged this view by use of mendelian randomisation 
and meta-analyses.7–10 
Determination of harm due to alcohol use is com-
plicated further by the multiple mechanisms through 
which alcohol use affects health: through cumulative 
consumption leading to adverse effects on organs and 
tissues; by acute intoxication leading to injuries or 
poisoning; and by dependent drinking leading to 
impairments and potentially self-harm or violence. These 
effects are also influenced by an individual’s consumption 
volume and pattern of drinking.2 Measuring the health 
effects of alcohol use requires careful consideration of all 
these factors.

Several studies have attempted to address these factors 
to provide global estimates of alcohol consumption and 
its associated health effects. The most comprehensive 
among these studies have been WHO’s Global Status 
Report on Alcohol and Health, as well as previous 
iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD).11–13 The present study aims to 
build upon pre-existing work and to address several 
limitations found in earlier research.
First, the available studies have assessed the risk of 
alcohol use by relying on external meta-analyses, which 
do not control for confounding in the selection of 
the reference category within constituent studies. This 
approach is problematic because of the so-called sick 
quitter hypothesis, which emphasises the importance of 
reference category selection in correctly assessing risk 
among drinkers, along with other confounding study 
characteristics such as survival bias.8,14–17 Until recently, 
most meta-analyses of alcohol consumption have not 
controlled for the composition of the reference category. 
Subsequently, assessments of harm relying on these 
studies have been biased. We sought to resolve this issue 
within our meta-analyses by including controls for 
different reference categories and the average age of 
participants.
Second, previous studies have used sales data to estimate 
population-level alcohol stock. Researchers have noted the 
benefit of using sales data instead of survey data for 
quantifying alcohol stock available within a location.18,19 
However, sales data still have bias because of consumption 
by tourists and unrecorded consumption from illicit sales, 
home brewing, and local beverages. Without correction for 
these factors, estimates relying on sales data can be biased 
and lead to inaccurate cross-national comparisons. In the 
current study, we adjusted the estimates of population-
level alcohol stock to account for the effects of tourism and 
unrecorded consumption.
Third, previous studies have assumed zero as the 
counterfactual exposure level that minimises harm. Within 
a comparative risk assessment approach, a counterfactual 
level of consumption that minimises harm is required 
to estimate population attributable fractions (PAFs).1 
However, this counterfactual level needs to be estimated, 
rather than assumed, given the complexities involved in 
estimating the risk of alcohol use across outcomes. Relying 
on this assumption can fail to capture any potential non-
linear effects between alcohol use and health. Our study 
proposes a new method for the use of available evidence to 
establish a counterfactual level of exposure across varied 
relative risks, which provides tangible evidence for low-risk 
drinking recommendations. 
In the present study, we aimed to address these limita-
tions and provide the best available estimates of alcohol 
use and the associated health burden. We estimated the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Although researchers recognise alcohol use as a leading risk 
factor for premature death and disability, some evidence 
suggests that low intake might have a protective effect on 
specific conditions such as ischaemic heart disease and diabetes. 
Monitoring of consumption behaviour is required to analyse the 
health effects of alcohol use. Historically, researchers have relied 
on self-reported survey data to estimate consumption levels 
and trends. However, these data have systematic biases that 
make cross-country comparisons unreliable. The Global Status 
Report on Alcohol and Health, as well as previous iterations of 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, 
have sought to produce harmonised, cross-country comparisons 
of alcohol consumption and its harms, by leveraging data on 
alcohol sales, the prevalence of current drinking and abstention, 
and self-reports of consumption amounts. 
Added value of this study
In this analysis we improved available estimates of alcohol use and 
its associated health burden in five ways. First, we consolidated 
694 individual and population-level data sources to estimate 
alcohol consumption levels among current drinkers. Second, we 
developed a method to adjust population-level consumption for 
alcohol consumed by tourists. Third, we improved pre-existing 
methods that account for unrecorded population-level 
consumption. Fourth, we did a new systematic review and 
meta-analysis of alcohol use and 23 associated health outcomes, 
which we used to estimate new dose–response curves of relative 
risk. Fifth, using the new relative risk curves and a new analytical 
method, we estimated the exposure of alcohol consumption 
that minimises an individual’s total attributable risk.
Implications of all the available evidence
The total attributable burden of alcohol use was larger than 
previous evidence has indicated and increases monotonically 
with consumption. Based on weighted relative risk curves for 
each health outcome associated with alcohol use, the level of 
consumption that minimises health loss due to alcohol use is 
zero. These findings strongly suggest that alcohol control 
policies should aim to reduce total population-level 
consumption. To potentially reduce the effects of alcohol use 
on future health loss, there is a need for countries to revisit 
their alcohol control policies and assess how they can be 
modified to further lower population-level consumption.

prevalence of current drinking (having one or more 
drinks in the past year); abstention from alcohol (having 
no alcohol in the past year); the distribution of alcohol 
consumption among current drinkers in standard drinks 
daily; and the disease burden attributable to alcohol use, 
in terms of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs). We produced these estimates for 195 locations 
from 1990 to 2016, for both sexes and for 5-year age 
groups between the ages of 15 years and 95 years and 
older. We also did a new meta-analysis to assess the dose–
response risk of alcohol consumption for 23 outcomes. 
Lastly, we estimated the level of alcohol consumption that 
minimises an individual’s total attributable risk of any 
health loss.
Methods 
Study design
This study follows the comparative risk assessment 
framework developed in previous iterations of GBD.20 In 
the following sections, we summarise our methods and 
briefly present innovations. A full explanation is available 
in appendix 1. This study fully adheres to the Guidelines 
for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER) statement.21
We estimated alcohol use exposure as grams of pure 
ethanol consumed daily by current drinkers (which we 
present here in terms of standard drinks daily, defined as 
10 g of pure ethyl alcohol). We estimated relative risks by 
dose in grams of pure ethyl alcohol, for each included 
risk–outcome pair. We ascertained which cause and 
injury outcomes to include by reviewing prospective and 
observational studies of alcohol use, and then assessing 
the causal association using Bradford-Hill’s criteria for 
causation.22 We included 23 outcomes, and the full list of 
risk–outcome pairs, as well as the corresponding data 
sources, are provided in appendix 1 (pp 52–140). 
Data sources
We found sources that included indicators of current 
drinking prevalence and alcohol consumed in grams per 
day using the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and 
PubMed.23 For the meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, 
the GHDx, and references of previously published meta-
analyses. For our exposure estimates, we extracted 
121 029 data points from 694 sources across all exposure 
indicators. For our relative risk estimates, we extracted 
3992 relative risk estimates across 592 studies. These 
relative risk estimates corresponded to a combined study 
population of 28 million individuals and 649 000 registered 
cases of respective outcomes. We list all the included data 
sources in appendix 1 (pp 52–140).
To estimate standard drinks consumed daily by current 
drinkers, we followed the general approach used by Rehm 
and colleagues.18 We briefly explain this method here, 
along with two methodological innovations to account 
for bias in the sales model: an adjustment to account for 
tourist consumption and an updated adjustment for 
unrecorded consumption. A full explanation of this 
approach is available in appendix 1 (pp 18–49).
To estimate exposure, we combined estimates of 
population-level alcohol stock and individual-level alcohol 
consumption to produce standard drinks consumed daily 
among current drinkers and current drinker prevalence, 
within a specific location, year, age group, and sex. We 
started by estimating population-level alcohol stock in litres 
per capita from sales data, individual-level estimates of the 
prevalence of current drinkers and abstainers from survey 
data, and individual-level estimates of the amount of 
alcohol consumed in grams per day from survey data. 
Then, for a given location and year, we rescaled age-specific 
and sex-specific estimates of individual-level consumption 
so that they aggregated to the estimates of population-level 
consumption. When surveys reported amount consumed 
in terms of beverage types, we converted these data into 
grams of pure ethanol using density equations and 
assumptions of the average alcohol content by drink type 
(appendix 1, p 50). Finally, we rescaled estimates of current 
drinking and abstention so that, within a given location, 
year, age group, and sex, the two estimates summed to one. 
After we derived our model of population-level alcohol 
stock from sales data, we controlled for sources of bias 
that could arise from tourism and unrecorded con-
sumption not recorded in formal sales. To account for 
tourist consumption, we computed an additive measure 
for alcohol consumed abroad by domestic citizens and 
subtractive measures for alcohol consumed domestically 
by tourists. We extracted data on the number of tourists 
by country of origin and destination from the World 
Tourism Organization and used these data to obtain 
estimates of total tourists, percentage of tourists by 
location, and average duration of stay using a spatio-
temporal Gaussian process regression.24 We combined 
these estimates with measures of alcohol in litres per 
capita by location, to calculate net amounts of total 
population-level alcohol stock consumed by tourists or 
domestic citizens travelling abroad. 
To account for alcohol stock not captured within formal 
alcohol sales data (ie, unrecorded consumption from 
illicit production, home brewing, local beverages, or 
alcohol sold as a non-alcohol product), we collated 
estimates across published studies of the percentage of 
total alcohol stock due to unrecorded consumption. We 
sampled 1000 times from a uniform distribution with a 
range between zero and the average of these collated 
studies by location (sampling from the uncertainty 
interval from each study, then averaging the draws) to

generate a conservative estimate of the total stock likely 
to be unrecorded. We used a conservative approach 
because of the wide heterogeneity in both the methods 
and estimates within included data sources. We provide 
estimates of these percentages in appendix 1 (pp 46–49).
Systematic review and meta-analysis
We did a new systematic review for each associated 
outcome to incorporate new findings on risk and to 
improve upon existing approaches. This strategy allowed 
us to systematically control for reference category con-
founding in constituent studies across associated out-
comes. We provide the search strategy, search diagrams, 
dose–response curves for each included outcome, and 
references for each outcome in appendix 1 (pp 57–146). 
Drawing from our systematic review, we did a meta-
analysis of risk outcomes for alcohol use. For each 
outcome, we estimated the dose–response relative risk 
curve using mixed-effects logistic regression with non-
linear splines for doses between 0 and 12·5 standard 
drinks daily. We selected 12·5 standard drinks daily as a 
cutoff point given the absence of available data beyond 
this range. We present additional details of the model in 
appendix 1 (pp 51–138). We tested the significance of 
including a study-level confounding variable on the 
composition of the reference category (eg, whether former 
drinkers were included in the abstainer category or not). 
When found to be significant, this variable was included 
as a predictor within the model, which was the case for 
ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, and diabetes.
Using our dose–response curves, we estimated the 
consumption level that minimises harm, which is 
defined in the comparative risk assessment approach as 
the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). 
We chose a theoretical minimum on the basis of a 
weighted average relative risk curve across all attributable 
outcomes. We constructed weights for each risk outcome 
based on the respective global, age-standardised DALY 
rate per 100 000 in 2016 for both sexes. Our TMREL was 
the minimum of this weighted all-attributable outcome 
dose–response curve. 
Attributable burden due to alcohol use 
We calculated PAFs using our estimates of exposure, 
relative risks, and TMREL, following the same approach 
taken within the GBD studies.20 For alcohol-use disorders, 
which are by definition fully attributable, we assumed a 
PAF of 1.24 Following this calculation, we multiplied PAFs 
by outcome-specific estimates of deaths and DALYs and 
summed these across outcomes to calculate the total 
attributable burden in specific locations. We aggregated 
both exposure and burden results at the global level and 
have presented them by quintile of the Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI). SDI is a summary measure of overall 
development, based on educational attainment, fertility, 
and income per capita within a location. Locations 
categorised by SDI quintile are found in appendix 1 
(pp 8–12).25 We also constructed age-standardised values 
of all estimates, using the same age weights as those used 
in the GBD standard population.
We made one adjustment to road injury PAFs to estimate 
how much burden occurred to others because of alcohol 
use by another individual. We based this adjustment on 
data from the US Fatality Analysis Reporting System 
(FARS), which includes the average number of deaths in 
automobile accidents involving alcohol and the percentage 
of those deaths distributed by age and sex. We multiplied 
age-specific and sex-specific alcohol-attributable and road-
injury-attributable DALYs by the average number of 
fatalities, given the driver’s age and sex. We then re-
distributed these attributable DALYs according to the 
FARS-derived probabilities that a population by age and 
sex would be involved in a road injury, given the exposed 
driver’s age and sex. Because of data availability, we 
assumed that locations outside the USA would follow a 
similar pattern to what we estimated with FARS. After 
redistributing the attributable DALYs, we derived PAFs 
again by dividing the redistributed attributable DALYs by 
total DALYs within specific demographics. 
Uncertainty analysis
For all steps, we calculated uncertainty for estimation 
of exposure, attributable deaths, and DALYs by taking 
1000 draws from the data’s uncertainty due to sampling 
error and modelling uncertainty arising from hyper-
parameter selection and parameter estimation. We 
then used these draws throughout the entire modelling 
process. When reporting uncertainty intervals, we 
present the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of the draws.

Results 
Global, regional, and national trends in alcohol 
consumption 
In 2016, 32·5% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 30·0–35·2) 
of people globally were current drinkers. 25% (95% UI 
23–27) of females were current drinkers, as were 
39% (36–43) of males (appendix 2). These percentages 
corresponded to 2·4 billion (95% UI 2·2–2·6) people 
globally who were current drinkers, with 1·5 billion 
(1·4–1·6) male current drinkers and 0·9 billion (0·8–1·0) 
female current drinkers (appendix 2, pp 2–1994). Globally, 
the mean amount of alcohol consumed was 0·73 (95% UI 
0·68–0·78) standard drinks daily for females and 
1·7 (1·5–1·9) standard drinks daily for males. 
The prevalence of current drinking varied considerably 
by location (figure 1). Prevalence was highest for high 
SDI locations, where 72% (95% UI 69–75) of females and

83% (80–85) of males were current drinkers (locations 
com 
prising each SDI quintile are provided in appendix 2, 
pp 8–12). Drinking prevalence was lowest in low-to-
middle SDI locations, where 8·9% (95% UI 6·6–9·7) of 
females and 20% (17–22) of males were current drinkers. 
Across SDI quintiles, females consumed less alcohol 
than males, with the size of this disparity decreasing with 
higher levels of SDI. For example, we found large 
differences between females and males in Nepal, with 
only 1·5% (95% UI 1·2–1·9) of females being current 
drinkers in 2016, compared with 21% (17–25) of males. 
Conversely, many high SDI locations had similar 
prevalence between sexes. For example, we found 
minimal differences in Sweden, where 86% (95% UI 
84–88) of females and 87% (85–89) of males were current 
drinkers.
The population average of standard drinks consumed 
daily among current drinkers in 2016 also differed widely 
by location and sex (figure 2). High SDI locations had 
the highest average of standard drinks consumed daily, 
with 1·9 (95% UI 1·3–2·7) standard drinks consumed 
daily among females and 2·9 (2·0–4·1) among males. 
Low SDI locations had the smallest average for males, 
with 1·4 (0·6–2·4) standard drinks consumed daily, 
while low-to-middle SDI locations had the lowest average 
for females, with 0·3 (0·1–0·6) standard drinks 
consumed daily.
Global patterns in alcohol-attributable deaths and 
disease burden 
In 2016, 2·8 million deaths (95% UI 2·4–3·3) were 
attributed to alcohol use. This corresponds to 2·2% 
(95% UI 1·5–3·0) of total age-standardised deaths among 
females and 6·8% (5·8–8·0) among males. In terms of 
overall disease burden, alcohol use led to 1·6% (95% UI 
1·4–2·0) of total DALYs globally in 2016 among females 
and 6·0% (5·4–6·7) among males. Globally, alcohol use 
was ranked as the seventh leading risk factor for 
premature death and disability in 2016, compared with 
other risk factors in the GBD studies. Among the 
population aged 15–49 years, alcohol use was the leading 
global risk factor for risk-attributable disease burden, 
causing 8·9% (95% UI 7·8–9·9) of attributable DALYs for 
men and 2·3% (2·0–2·6) for women. Among the 
population aged 15–49 years, 3·8% (95% UI 3·2–4·3) of 
female deaths and 12·2% (10·8–13·6) of male deaths 
were attributable to alcohol use.
Both total burden attributable to alcohol use and the 
proportion of causes associated with alcohol use varied 
by sex, age, and SDI quintile (figure 3; appendix 2, 
pp 1997–2186). In absolute terms, the alcohol-attributable 
burden by age was smaller for females than for males 
(figure 3). For females, the alcohol-attributable burden 
increased with age, while for males the burden increased 
until between 55–65 years of age, after which attributable 
burden decreased. Females, particularly in high SDI 
locations, experienced some protective effects for 
ischaemic heart disease and diabetes beyond 60 years of 
age. For males, only high SDI and low SDI locations had 
noticeable protective effects for ischaemic heart disease, 
but the effect was small compared with the total 
attributable burden in those locations.
For both males and females, health outcomes com-
prising the attributable burden changed across the life-
span (figure 3). The three leading causes of attributable 
deaths in this age group were tuberculosis (1·4% [95% UI 
1·0–1·7] of total deaths), road injuries (1·2% [0·7–1·9]), 
and self-harm (1·1% [0·6–1·5]). For females aged 
15–49 years, alcohol use disorders con 
stituted the largest 
proportion of the attributable burden across SDI 
quintiles; the primary exception was tuber 
culosis, which 
accounted for the largest proportion of attributable 
burden in low SDI settings. In this age range, transport 
injuries and alcohol use disorders were the predominant 
causes of attributable burden for males in high-to-middle 
SDI quintiles; for low-to-middle SDI and low SDI 
quintiles, tuberculosis was the primary cause of the 
attributable burden for both sexes.
Beyond 50 years of age, the causes of total attributable 
burden became more complex by SDI quintile. For 
populations aged 50 years and older, cancers accounted 
for a large proportion of total alcohol-attributable deaths 
in 2016, constituting 27·1% (95% UI 21·2–33·3) of 
total alcohol-attributable female deaths and 18·9% 
(15·3–22·6) of alcohol-attributable male deaths. In high 
SDI countries, cancers were the predominant source of 
attributable burden among both sexes. In low SDI 
countries, tuberculosis was the primary cause of burden 
for both sexes, followed by cirrhosis and other chronic 
liver diseases. The profile of attributable burden in high-
to-middle SDI and middle SDI countries for females 
and males was largely composed of ischaemic stroke 
and haemorrhagic stroke, followed by liver cancer for 
females. In all SDI quintiles, haemorrhagic stroke and 
hypertensive heart disease were the largest sources of 
burden for females aged 80 years and older. For men in 
this age group, the composition of the burden was 
similar to that of males aged 50 years or older.
Health risks associated with alcohol consumption 
Figure 4 shows the relative risk curves for selected health 
outcomes, separately for females and males. Estimated 
relative risk curves for each health outcome are presented 
in appendix 2 (pp 52–140). With this analysis, we only 
found statistically significant evidence for the J-shaped 
curve for ischaemic heart disease; non-significant 
J-shaped curves were observed for diabetes and isch-
aemic stroke. For ischaemic heart disease, we found a

minimum relative risk of 0·86 (0·80–0·96) for men and 
0·82 (0·72–0·95) for women, occurring at 0·83 standard 
drinks daily for men and 0·92 standard drinks daily for 
women. We found no significant difference in relative 
risk curves for ischaemic heart disease or diabetes 
when estimating the curves by age. For all other out-
comes, including all cancers, we found that relative risk 
monotonically increased with alcohol consumption 
(appendix 2, pp 57–146).
In estimating the weighted relative risk curve, we 
found that consuming zero (95% UI 0·0–0·8) standard 
drinks daily minimised the overall risk of all health 
loss (figure 5). The risk rose monotonically with 
increasing amounts of daily drinking. This weighted 
relative risk curve took into account the protective effects 
of alcohol use associated with ischaemic heart disease 
and diabetes in females. However, these protective 
effects were offset by the risks associated with cancers, 
which in 
creased monotonically with consumption. In a 
sensitivity analysis, where we explored how the weighted 
relative risk curve changed on the basis of the choice of 
weights for various health outcomes, the curve changed 
signifi 
cantly only in settings where diabetes and 
ischaemic heart disease comprised more than 60% of 
total deaths in a population.
Discussion
In 2016, alcohol use led to 2·8 million deaths and was the 
leading risk factor for premature death and disability 
among people aged 15–49 years, with nearly 9% of all 
attributable DALYs for men and more than 2% for 
women. Our findings indicate that alcohol use was 
associated with far more health loss for males than for 
females, with the attributable burden for men around 
three times higher than that for women in 2016. By 
evaluating all associated relative risks for alcohol use, we 
found that consuming zero standard drinks daily 
minimises the overall risk to health. 
Previous research has analysed all-cause risk due to 
alcohol use by either investigating all-cause risk in 
particular cohorts and survey series, or through meta-
analyses of those studies.26,27 Past findings subsequently 
suggested a persistent protective effect for some low or 
moderate levels of alcohol consumption on all-cause 
mortality. However, these studies were limited by 
small sample sizes, inadequate control for confounders, 
and non-optimal choices of a reference category for 
calculating relative risks. More recent research, which 
has used methodologies such as mendelian randomis-
ation, pooling cohort studies, and multivariable adjusted 
meta-analyses, increasingly shows either a non-signifi-
cant or no protective effect of drinking on all-cause 
mortality or cardiovascular outcomes.7,14,28 Our results on 
the weighted attributable risk are consistent with this 
body of work. Taken together, these findings emphasise 
that alcohol use, regardless of amount, leads to health 
loss across populations. Although we found some 
protective effects for ischaemic heart disease and 
diabetes among women, these effects were offset when 
overall health risks were considered—especially because 
of the strong association between alcohol consump-
tion and the risk of cancer, injuries, and communic-
able disease. These findings stress the importance of 
assessing how alcohol use affects population health 
across the lifespan.
Evaluating attributable burden across SDI quintiles 
revealed the magnitude by which outcomes of alcohol 
use differ and how total attributable burden relates to 
increasing SDI. Our results indicate that alcohol use and 
its harmful effects on health could become an increasing 
challenge amid gains in SDI. Given that most low and 
low-to-middle SDI settings currently have lower average 
alcohol consumption than high-to-middle SDI settings, 
it is crucial for decision makers and government agencies 
to enact or maintain strong alcohol control policies today 
to prevent the potential for rising alcohol use in the 
future. Effective policies now could yield substantial 
population health benefits for years to come.

Our results point to a need to revisit alcohol control 
policies and health programmes, and to consider 
recommendations for abstention. In terms of reducing 
population-level alcohol use, WHO provides a set of best 
buys—policies that provide an individual year of healthy 
life at less than the cost of the average individual 
income.29 Governments should consider how these 
recommendations can be implemented within their local 
contexts and broader policy platforms, including excise 
taxes on alcohol, controlling the physical availability of 
alcohol and the hours of sale, and controlling alcohol 
advertising. Any of these policy actions would contribute 
to reductions in population-level consumption—an 
important step toward decreasing the health loss 
associated with alcohol use. 
Failing to address harms from alcohol use, particularly 
at high levels of consumption, can have dire effects on 
population health. The mortality crisis in Russia is a 
striking example, where alcohol use was the primary 
culprit of increases in mortality starting in the 1980s and 
led to 75% of deaths among men aged 15–55 years.30 
Current global trends—namely, population ageing— 
portend a growing toll of the alcohol-attributable burden 
in the absence of policies, particularly since many cancers 
disproportionately affect older individuals. Consequently, 
low-to-middle SDI countries could benefit from policy 
action today to keep alcohol consump 
tion low and 
prevent greater health loss in the future. High and 
high-to-middle SDI locations need to consider stronger 
alcohol reduction policies, such as those recommend-
ed by WHO, in an effort to reduce population-level 
consumption.
Our results should be interpreted within the context of 
the study’s limitations. First, our consumption estimates 
might not fully capture illicit production or unrecorded 
consumption given our use of sales data in estimation. 
We have sought to adjust for consumption beyond sales 
data, but given the heterogeneity of these estimates it is 
likely that additional methodological refinements are 
necessary to improve the quantification of unrecorded 
consumption. Second, drinking patterns within a year 
are assumed to be consistent; however, past work shows 
that drinking patterns, rather than average levels of 
consumption such as standard daily drinks, might be 
related to different levels of risk and harm. Unfortunately, 
the data requirements for assessment of such drinking 
patterns by age, sex, and location far exceed what is 
currently available. For instance, few prospective studies 
quantify the effects of drinking patterns and average 
levels of consumption in tandem, a requirement for 
correctly assessing the risk of alcohol-attributable 
outcomes. Third, the data used to estimate motor vehicle 
harm caused to others from alcohol use were only 
available for the USA (ie, FARS data). Although it is 
unlikely that the patterns observed in FARS are drastically 
different from those of other locations (appendix 1, 
pp 141–144), this assumption needs to be tested with 
more location-specific estimates. Fourth, we were unable 
to find robust data about the harm caused to others 
from alcohol-attributable interpersonal violence, a major 
potential source of health loss. More retrospective studies 
are needed to assess the harm to others caused through 
an individual’s alcohol use.30 Fifth, consumption for 
populations younger than 15 years was not assessed 
because of data sparseness on alcohol use for these age 
groups. In the absence of such data, potential approaches 
to address this limitation, such as assuming consumption 
patterns of older age groups or trying to extrapolate past 
levels of alcohol consumption, are likely to introduce 
additional bias or error. More research on youth drinking 
and the associated risk is required to estimate alcohol-
attributable burden for this age group. Last, we sought to 
quantify the risk of alcohol use only for outcomes with 
evidence meeting the criteria for the comparative risk 
assessment approach of GBD studies. However, there are 
additional outcomes, such as dementia and psoriasis, 
for which accumulating evidence suggests that alcohol 
use might be a risk factor.31–33 In combination, these 
limitations suggest that our results are likely to under-
estimate both the health risks and overall attributable 
burden of alcohol use. 
Conclusion 
Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for disease burden 
worldwide, accounting for nearly 10% of global deaths 
among populations aged 15–49 years, and poses dire 
ramifications for future population health in the absence 
of policy action today. The widely held view of the health 
benefits of alcohol needs revising, particularly as 
improved methods and analyses continue to show how 
much alcohol use contributes to global death and 
disability. Our results show that the safest level of 
drinking is none. This level is in conflict with most 
health guidelines, which espouse health benefits 
associated with consuming up to two drinks per day. 
Alcohol use contributes to health loss from many causes 
and exacts its toll across the lifespan, particularly among 
men. Policies that focus on reducing population-level 
consumption will be most effective in reducing the 
health loss from alcohol use.
