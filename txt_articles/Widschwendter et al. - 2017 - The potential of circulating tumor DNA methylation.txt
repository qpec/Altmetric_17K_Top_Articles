Abstract
Background: Despite a myriad of attempts in the last three decades to diagnose ovarian cancer (OC) earlier, this
clinical aim still remains a significant challenge. Aberrant methylation patterns of linked CpGs analyzed in DNA
fragments shed by cancers into the bloodstream (i.e. cell-free DNA) can provide highly specific signals indicating
cancer presence.
Methods: We analyzed 699 cancerous and non-cancerous tissues using a methylation array or reduced
representation bisulfite sequencing to discover the most specific OC methylation patterns. A three-DNA-
methylation-serum-marker panel was developed using targeted ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing in 151
women and validated in 250 women with various conditions, particularly in those associated with high CA125
levels (endometriosis and other benign pelvic masses), serial samples from 25 patients undergoing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, and a nested case control study of 172 UKCTOCS control arm participants which included serum
samples up to two years before OC diagnosis.
Results: The cell-free DNA amount and average fragment size in the serum samples was up to ten times higher
than average published values (based on samples that were immediately processed) due to leakage of DNA from
white blood cells owing to delayed time to serum separation. Despite this, the marker panel discriminated high
grade serous OC patients from healthy women or patients with a benign pelvic mass with specificity/sensitivity
of 90.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 84.3–94.8%) and 41.4% (95% CI = 24.1–60.9%), respectively. Levels of all
three markers plummeted after exposure to chemotherapy and correctly identified 78% and 86% responders
and non-responders (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.04), respectively, which was superior to a CA125 cut-off of 35 IU/mL
(20% and 75%). 57.9% (95% CI 34.0–78.9%) of women who developed OC within two years of sample collection
were identified with a specificity of 88.1% (95% CI = 77.3–94.3%). Sensitivity and specificity improved further when
specifically analyzing CA125 negative samples only (63.6% and 87.5%, respectively).
Conclusions: Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns in cell-free DNA have the potential to detect a
proportion of OCs up to two years in advance of diagnosis and may potentially guide personalized treatment. The
prospective use of novel collection vials, which stabilize blood cells and reduce background DNA contamination in
serum/plasma samples, will facilitate clinical implementation of liquid biopsy analyses.

 Background
Three-quarters of ovarian cancers (OC) are diagnosed
when the tumor has spread into the abdomen and long-
term survival rates of these women are low (10–30%) [1].
High-grade serous (HGS) OC accounts for 70–80% of
OC deaths and the survival figures have not changed sig-
nificantly over the last few decades [2]. Early diagnosis
and personalized treatment still remain the biggest
unmet needs in combating this devastating disease [2].
A number of OC biomarkers have been studied in the
past. Among these, CA125, which was discovered more
than 30 years ago [3], is still the “gold standard,” despite
a modest positive predictive value when interpreted
using a defined cut-off of 35 IU/mL [4], which has also
been used as a reference standard in our work. Recently,
the 35 most promising OC biomarkers were evaluated in
the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO)
Cancer Screening Trial. The markers were tested in
samples taken up to six months before OC diagnosis
from 118 women and 951 age-matched controls and at a
fixed specificity of 95%, CA125 sensitivity out performed
all 35 markers [5]. However, the performance of CA125
dropped dramatically when samples taken > 6 months
before diagnosis were evaluated [5]. Recently, we dem-
onstrated that the performance of the Risk of Ovarian
Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), based on CA125 serial pro-
file, demonstrates superior performance characteristics
during screening [6, 7]. CA125 kinetics are also increas-
ingly being explored in women undergoing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NACT) for predicting disease response
and outcome [8–11]. Both require serial blood sampling,
which, in the case of differential diagnosis, is never avail-
able in patients presenting clinically.
The vast majority of protein-based tumor markers are
produced not only by cancerous but also non-neoplastic
normal cells; CA125 is produced by mesothelial cells (i.e.
peritoneum and pleura) and hence benign or inflammatory
processes can result in aberrant elevations of serum CA125.
Recently, DNA-based markers, shed from tumor cells,
have shown great promise in monitoring treatment re-
sponse and predicting prognosis [12–16]. However, efforts
to characterize the cancer genome have shown that only a
few genes are frequently mutated in most cancers and that
the location of the genetic mutation site differs across in-
dividuals with specific tumor types. Hence, the detection
of somatic mutations is limited to patients that harbor a
predefined set of mutations. The necessity of prior know-
ledge regarding specific genomic composition of an indi-
vidual’s tumor tissue is one of the limiting factors when
using these “liquid biopsy” approaches for early detection
or differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass. Current sequen-
cing technology allows for the detection of a mutant allele
fraction of 0.1% (which is one mutant molecule in a back-
ground of 1000 wild-type molecules) [12, 17].
The development of a cell-free DNA based test for the
early detection of cancer poses two major challenges: (1)
low abundance of cancer-DNA in the blood; and (2)
high levels of “background DNA” (shed from white
blood cells [WBC] [18]) in serum samples that are sepa-
rated from blood cells after significant time intervals.
This is an issue with most currently available population
cohort biobanks which could be used for the validation
of potential screening markers using samples that have
been banked years in advance of diagnosis.
Alteration of DNA methylation (DNAme) is: (1) an early
event in cancer development [19–22]; (2) more frequently
observed than somatic mutations; and (3) centered around
specific regions, i.e. CpG islands [23]. Together with its
chemical and biological stability, the detection of aberrant
DNAme patterns in serum or plasma provide a novel
strategy for cancer diagnosis as evidenced by several proof
of principle studies [24–34]. DNAme analysis allows for
the detection of specific patterns (i.e. full methylation of
all linked 7–16 CpGs in a region of 120–150 bp) as op-
posed to single point mutations (e.g. in the TP53 gene)
which is key to improving both the performance charac-
teristics of the test and the detection limit of the assay.
Plasma SEPT9 methylation analyses—currently the only
cell-free DNA assay which is available for cancer screening
in the clinical setting—demonstrates a specificity of 79%
and a sensitivity of 68% for detection of colon cancers
[31]. The clinical potential of serum/plasma-based cell-
free DNA analysis is further exemplified by maternal
plasma cell-free DNA testing for fetal trisomy which has
already been integrated into clinical practice and demon-
strates a higher sensitivity and a lower false-positive rate
compared to imaging-based techniques [35].
We have employed two different epigenome-wide ap-
proaches to identify the most promising DNAme-based
markers that discriminate OC vs benign pelvic condi-
tions,
developed
serum
tests
using
the
discovered
markers, and validated their performance in relation to
the serum OC marker CA125.
Methods

We analyzed tissue samples from a total of 699 volun-
teers and 648 serum samples from a total of 598 volun-
teers (the 25 patients who underwent NACT provided
three serial samples) in seven independent sets (Fig. 1).

CA125 analysis was performed using the CA125
Cobas immunoassay and platform (Roche Diagnostics,
Burgess Hill, UK) by staff who had no access to clinical
or DNAme data.
NACT set:
Patients (n = 25) at the Gynaecological Oncology Centre
in Prague deemed not to be suitable for upfront surgery
were recruited. The average age was 62.8 years. HGS
OCs were the most prevalent histology (n = 23) and the
remaining two patients had clear cell OCs. Eighteen and
seven patients presented with a stage IIIC and IV OC,
respectively. Twenty-four patients received Carboplatin-
Paclitaxel combination chemotherapy and one patient
received Carboplatin only. All but two patients had
interval debulking surgery. Among the 23 patients, 14
had no residual disease, five had macroscopic residual
disease, and four had microscopic residual disease (i.e.
tumor reaches the edge of at least one of the resected
specimens, according to TNM classification). Twelve pa-
tients were deemed to be platinum-sensitive (no recur-
rence within six months after successful completion of
neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and interval
debulking surgery) and eight patients were deemed to be
platinum-refractory (n = 2, no response to chemotherapy
or progression on chemotherapy) or platinum-resistant
(n = 6, recurrence within six months after successful
completion of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy
and interval debulking surgery). For five patients, no
data were available on platinum-sensitivity.
All serum samples were collected prospectively at the
Charles University Hospital in Prague. Each patient pro-
vided three samples at the following time-points:
� at the time of histological diagnosis, before
chemotherapy;
� three weeks after the first cycle of chemotherapy
(immediately before the second cycle);
� three weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy
(immediately before the third cycle).
CA125 analysis was performed using the CA125
Cobas immunoassay and platform (Roche Diagnostics,
Burgess Hill, UK).
UKCTOCS set:
Among the 202,546 women, 101,359 women were
randomized
into
the
control
arm
of
UKCTOCS
(ClinicalTrial.gov registration, NCT00058032) between
2001 and 2005 [6, 7, 39]. Forty-three women developed
an invasive epithelial OC within 2 years of serum sam-
ple donation and had at least 4 mL of non-hemolyzed
serum available. Twenty-six, two, two, one, five, and
seven women developed a HGS, mucinous, endome-
trioid, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, and a carcinoma not
otherwise specified, respectively. The average age at
sample donation was 63.9 years. Among the 43 women,
19 women were diagnosed within one year and 24

were
diagnosed
1–2
years
after

 donation. Thirteen and 30 women were diagnosed with
a stage I/II and stage III/IV cancer, respectively. For
each of the 43 cases, three women who did not develop
any cancer within the first five years after recruitment
were matched with respect to age at recruitment,
center, and month of recruitment (controls, n = 129)
(see Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Blood samples from all UKCTOCS volunteers were
spun down for serum separation after being couriered at
room temperature to the central laboratory and were ali-
quoted and stored in liquid nitrogen vapor phase until
they were thawed for this study. Only 1 mL of serum
per UKCTOCS volunteer was available for cell-free
DNA analysis. CA125 analysis was performed using the
CA125 Cobas immunoassay and platform (Roche Diag-
nostics, Burgess Hill, UK). The study was approved by
the local research ethics committees: UCL/UCLH Bio-
bank for Studying Health & Disease NC09.13). All pa-
tients provided written consent for samples to be used
in ethically approved secondary studies.
Isolation and bisulfite modification of DNA
DNA was isolated from tissue and serum samples at
GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). Tissue DNA was
quantified using NanoDrop and Qubit (both Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA); the size was assessed by agarose
gel electrophoresis. Serum DNA was quantified using
the Fragment Analyzer and the High Sensitivity Large
Fragment Analysis Kit (AATI, USA). DNA was bisulfite
converted at GATC Biotech.
DNAme analysis in tissue
Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed either
by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K
beadchip array (Illumina Inc., USA, WG-314-1003) as
previously described [37, 38] or using RRBS at GATC
Biotech. For the 450 K methylation data, we developed a
pipeline in order to select the most promising cancer-
specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that
are most likely to fulfil the strict specificity criteria of a
serum-based test (Additional file 2).
For RRBS, DNA was digested by the restriction endo-
nuclease MspI that is specific for the CpG-containing
motif CCGG; a size selection of the library provides an
enhanced coverage for the CpG-rich regions including
CpG islands, promoters, and enhancer elements [40, 41].
The
digested
DNA
was
adapter
ligated,
bisulfite-
modified, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ampli-
fied. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina’s HiSeq
2500 with 50 bp or 100 bp paired-end mode. Using Gen-
edata Expressionist® for Genomic Profiling v9.1, we have
established a bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of
cancer-specific DMRs. The most promising DMRs have
been taken forward for the development and validation
of serum-based clinical assays (Additional file 2).
Targeted ultra-high coverage bisulfite sequencing of
serum DNA
Targeted bisulfite sequencing libraries were prepared at
GATC Biotech. In brief, bisulfite modification was per-
formed with 1 mL serum equivalent. Modified DNA was
used to test up to three different markers using a two-
step PCR approach. Ultra-high coverage sequencing was
performed on Illumina’s MiSeq or HiSeq 2500 with
75 bp or 125 bp paired-end mode (Additional file 2).
Statistical analyses
For DMR discovery, the data analysis pipelines are de-
scribed within the respective sections in the Additional file
2. In brief, Genedata Expressionist® for Genomic Profiling
was used to map reads to human genome version hg19,
identify regions with tumor-specific methylation patterns,
quantify the occurrence of those patterns, and calculate
relative pattern frequencies per sample. Pattern frequen-
cies were calculated as number of reads containing the
pattern divided by total reads covering the pattern region.
To find tumor-specific methylation patterns, we first de-
termined the methylation pattern frequencies of all ob-
served patterns in relevant genomic regions in different
tissues. The algorithm that we developed scans the whole
genome and identifies regions that contain at least ten
aligned paired-end reads. These read bundles are split into
smaller regions of interest which contain at least four
CpGs in a stretch of, at most, 150 bp. For each region and
tissue/sample, the absolute frequency (number of support-
ing reads) for all observed methylation patterns was deter-
mined (Fig. 2a). This led to tens of millions of patterns per
tissue/sample. The patterns were filtered in a multi-step
procedure to identify the methylation patterns which spe-
cifically occur in tumor samples. In order to increase sen-
sitivity and specificity of our pattern discovery procedure,
we pooled reads from different tumor or WBC samples,
respectively,
and
scored
patterns
based
on
over-
representation within tumor tissue. The results were
summarized in the specificity score Sp, which reflects the
cancer specificity of the patterns. After applying a cut-off
of Sp ≥ 10, 2.6 million patterns for OC remained and were
further filtered according to the various criteria demon-
strated in Fig. 2b (and Additional file 2).
For the filtered unique cancer-specific patterns for OC
identified in the Array (n = 19) and RRBS (n = 45)
approach, respectively, bisulfite sequencing primers have
been designed and technically validated, eventually lead-
ing to 31 candidate markers (Additional file 3: Table S1).
Quantification and analysis of DNAme patterns were
performed by staff who, at the time of analysis, had no
access
to
CA125
data
or
clinical
information.

 Furthermore, staff who performed the CA125 analyses
had no access to clinical information at the time of the
analyses. Only samples with valid values in the respective
DNAme marker (no samples were excluded based on
coverage) and CA125 assays (all samples had a valid
value) were included in the calculation of the respective
sensitivities and specificities. The 95% CI intervals for
sensitivity and specificity have been calculated according
to the efficient-score method [42]. Differences in pattern
frequencies or coverage have been analyzed using the
Mann–Whitney U test.
Results
The samples, techniques, and purpose of the three
phases—marker discovery, assay development, and test
validation—are summarized in Fig. 1.
DNA methylation marker discovery in tissue
We have used two independent epigenome-wide ap-
proaches in order to discover DMRs which have the po-
tential
to
diagnose
OC
with
high
sensitivity
and
specificity. First, Illumina Infinium Human Methyla-
tion450 BeadChip Array (450 K) technology was used to
interrogate the methylation status of ~ 485,000 genomic
sites in 218 OC [36] and 438 control samples (Fig. 1 and
Additional file 2). A set of 19 high scoring and ranking
DMRs were selected for targeted-BS-based serum assay
development. Additional file 1: Figure S2 shows an ex-
ample of a selected top DMR (reaction #228). Second,
based on RRBS, we developed a method for methylation
quantification that takes advantage of the sequencing-
specific information (i.e. the individual methylation sta-
tus of all sequenced CpGs on every single DNA mol-
ecule) to overcome the challenges of using serum-based
samples (i.e. relatively few tumor derived molecules in a
large background of non-tumor DNA). To achieve suffi-
cient specificity in this setting, our algorithm selects
markers that are combinations of four or more CpGs on
a single molecule, which show tumor specific methyla-
tion. While “background methylation” might be ob-
served on each of these CpGs and also in WBC DNA,
for example, it is much less likely that such background
methylation of all measured CpGs will be observed in a
single DNA molecule derived from WBCs. The analysis
of single molecules also enabled us to select patterns
that were not observed in any of the WBC samples ana-
lyzed, i.e. had 100% specificity in our discovery tissue
sample set. Further, to achieve sufficient sensitivity in a
liquid biopsy test, we restricted our markers to CpG pat-
terns within a 150-bp window, which would allow for
good PCR amplification as well as the increased likeli-
hood
of
obtaining
DNA
fragments
containing
all
Fig. 2 Principles of methylation pattern discovery in tissue and analyses in serum. RRBS was used in tissue samples in order to identify those CpG
regions for which methylation patterns discriminate OC from other tissues, in particular blood cells which are the most abundant contaminant of
cell-free DNA. An example of region #141 is provided which is a 136-bp region containing seven linked CpGs. The cancer pattern consists of reads
in which all linked CpGs are methylated, indicated by “1111111” (a). b The tissue RRBS data have been processed through a bioinformatic pipeline
in order to identify the most promising markers. c The principles of the serum DNA methylation assay are demonstrated

 required CpGs in apoptotic or necrotic, respectively, cir-
culating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Finally, we generalized
our algorithm so that it would also detect methylation
patterns that are hypomethylated in tumors or heteroge-
neously methylated, respectively. This approach, to-
gether with some additional selection criteria described
in Fig. 2 and Additional file 2, led to 45 marker candi-
dates that could be utilized for the development of
DNAme assays suitable for liquid biopsies testing.
Further analysis of all patterns occurring within the
marker regions revealed that, while the selected, fully
methylated patterns were generally more specific, trun-
cated versions of these fully methylated patterns within
the same regions (i.e. overlapping patterns including
other, more, or less CpGs, respectively) showed very
similar pattern frequencies in the samples analyzed
(Additional file 1: Figure S3). Patterns from these regions
containing one or more unmethylated CpGs were gener-
ally less specific. Heterogeneously methylated patterns in
other regions were also detected (not shown), but have
been filtered out in subsequent steps shown in Fig. 2.
Serum DNAme assay establishment
We used ultra-deep BS sequencing (Fig. 2c) to develop
serum assays for the candidate regions in 59 serum
samples from Set 1 (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Figure
S4 and Additional file 2). Based on sensitivity and spe-
cificity (assessed by area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve [AUC]), nine markers have been se-
lected for further validation in Set 2 (n = 92; Additional
file 1: Figure S5). In Sets 1 and 2 combined, the specifi-
city and sensitivity of the top four candidate markers
referred to regions #141, #144, #204, and #228 (#228
was only analyzed in Set 2) to discriminate HGS OC
from healthy women or those with a benign pelvic mass
was 95.7%/42.4%, 93.5%/48.5%, 100%/25.0%, and 100%/
36.8%, respectively (pattern frequency thresholds were
set at 0.0008, 0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively).
Interestingly, region #144 has already been defined as a
promising cell-free DNA marker for cancer, particularly
in OC [43, 44]. For three (i.e. #144, #204, and #228) of
these four regions, CpGs were analyzed on the 450 k
methylation array; using these data we demonstrated
that aberrant methylation can already be detected in
early stage cancers (i.e. stage I and II; Additional file 1:
Figure S6). Due to limited serum volume in our valid-
ation sets, we chose a combination of three markers.
The combination of regions #141, #204, and #228 (at
least one of these regions with a pattern frequency
above the aforementioned threshold) resulted in a
98.1% specificity and a 63.2% sensitivity. These regions
are linked to genes COL23A1, C2CD4D, and WNT6,
respectively.
Clinical validation of the serum DNAme assay
We validated the combination of the three markers in
Set 3 (Fig. 3a–c) alongside the CA125 serum marker
(Fig. 3d). The average coverage (i.e. DNA strand reads
by the sequencer for each sample and region) is >
500,000 (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Applying the
above indicated cut-off thresholds for the three DNAme
markers and 35 IU/mL for serum CA125 led to specific-
ities of 90.7% and 87.1% and sensitivities of 41.4% and
82.8%, respectively (Table 1). Due to the fact that reac-
tion #228 was only analyzed in Set 2, we combined Set 2
and Set 3 in order to redefine the thresholds. Whereas
for #141 the threshold of 0.0008 remained unchanged,
for #204 and #228 we further lowered the pattern fre-
quency threshold to 0.00003 and 0.00001, respectively,
leading to specificity and sensitivity of 91.8% and 58.3%,
respectively (Table 1). Among these 48 HGS cancers (i.e.
the most aggressive cancers), 6/11 (54.5%) stage I/II and
22/37 (59.5%) stage III/IV cancers were serum DNAme-
positive. Importantly, there was no overlap between the
DNAme-positive
and
CA125-false
positive
controls
(Table 2).
Serum DNAme to predict response to platinum-based
NACT
In order to further assess the cancer specificity and the
dynamics of our three candidate markers in individual
patients, we recruited 25 OC patients who received
carboplatin-based
NACT.
Compared
with
the
pre-
treatment sample, all three DNAme markers decreased
substantially and to a larger extent compared to CA125
after one and two cycles (Fig. 4a–d and Additional file 1:
Figures S8–S10). Whereas CA125 dynamics were not a
strong discriminator between chemotherapy-responders
and non-responders (Table 3), serum DNAme dynamics
(i.e. serum DNAme as defined in Sets 2 and 3, before
chemotherapy compared to after two cycles) correctly
identified
78%
and
86%
of
responders
and
non-
responders (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.04) overall and 78%
and 100% of responders and non-responders among
those women who were left without residual disease
after interval debulking surgery (Fisher’s exact test, p =
0.007) (Table 3).
Serum DNAme for early diagnosis of OC
In order to judge whether our marker panel is, in fact,
capable of diagnosing OC early, samples predating OC
diagnosis by up to two years (cases) and matched con-
trols were used from the control (no screening) arm of
the UKCTOCS cohort. The median time from vene-
puncture to serum separation was 21.97 h (interquartile
range [IQR] = 19.91–24.34 h) for this sample set. As ex-
pected, both the amount of DNA/mL serum as well as
the average DNA fragment size were substantially higher

 in UKCTOCS samples compared with the other samples
used in this study (Fig. 5a and b). This is potentially due
to DNA from WBCs leaking into the serum during the
sample transport time, particularly during the warmer
months of the year (Additional file 1: Figure S11).
Nevertheless, a small proportion (on average, 19.9%) of
the DNA consisted of smaller (50–250 bp) fragments
representing DNA from apoptotic cells (including DNA
from cancer cells) (Additional file 1: Figure S12). The
“contaminating” majority of high-quality DNA not only
dilutes the cancer signal but also skews the target se-
quence amplification towards WBC DNA. In order to
adjust for these factors, we made an a priori decision to
reduce the threshold for the three regions by a factor of
3 and split the analyses in samples above (high) and
below (low) the median amount of DNA (Table 4). The
three DNAme-marker panel was able to identify cases
with a specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 58%, when
specifically assessed in samples with a DNA concentra-
tion lower than the median ng/uL value, and importantly

HGS OC from H or BPM women were chosen and validated in Set 3. Combining Serum Sets 1-3 (note #228 was not analyzed in Set 1)
the cut-off thresholds have been refined so that the final cut-offs for #141, #204 and #228 were 0.0008, 0.00003 and 0.00001 respectively;

 which predated cancer diagnosis by up to two years
(Table 4B and Additional file 3: Table S2). The sensitivity
of the panel improved from 58% to 64% when exclu-
sively assessing CA125-negative (<35 IU/mL) samples.
As previously observed in the Set 3 analysis there is no
overlap between CA125 and DNAme false-positive con-
trols (Table 5). When directly comparing the perform-
ance of CA125 (applying a cut-off of 35 IU/mL) with the
DNAme panel specifically in the “low” DNA samples,
the DNAme panel had higher sensitivity (57.9% vs
42.1%) but lower specificity (88.1% vs 95.5%) compared
to that of CA125 for the early detection of OC
(Additional file 3: Table S3).
Discussion
We identified cancer-specific DNAme patterns in tissue
and developed serum assays which we validated in vari-
ous settings. Our findings suggested that cell-free DNA
has the potential to detect ovarian cancer up to two
years in advance of clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, a
cell-free DNA based test will have to overcome several
hurdles before clinical implementation.
In healthy individuals, cell-free DNA is present at con-
centrations in the range of 0–100 ng/mL and an average
of 30 ng/mL [45]. DNA derived from tumor cells is
shorter than that from non-malignant cells in the plasma
of cancer patients [46]. Our overarching goal was to

 develop DNAme-based markers for early OC detection.
In order to realize this aim, samples must be derived
from large population-based screening studies, such as
the UKCTOCS trial, that have samples banked years
ahead
of
diagnosis.
Serum
samples
from ~ 100,000
women need to be collected to accrue sufficient OC
numbers (i.e. a range of 40–50). Within the UKCTOCS,
which involved collection and banking of serum samples
from over 200,000 women, whole blood samples were
couriered to the central laboratory within 2–48 h. Pro-
spectively collected blood samples were spun down 2–
12 hours after collection to mimic the UKCTOCS set-
ting. The UKCTOCS, and to a lesser extent the other
prospectively collected sets, contained higher than aver-
age amounts of cell-free DNA and fragments were lon-
ger on average. Both factors reflect the leakage of WBC
DNA into serum. In order to compensate for this, we
aimed for an extremely high coverage but noted that
four of the UKCTOCS samples had at least one of the
three markers with a coverage 100,000; we had made an
upfront decision not to exclude any of the samples based
on lower coverage but note that this is one of the limita-
tions of this study. Despite these complicating factors
the three-DNAme marker panel outperformed CA125
using a 35 IU/mL cut-off in detecting OC early in the
group of women who had a DNA concentration lower
than the median ng/uL value.
In order to provide further functional proof that the
newly developed serum DNAme marker panel is cancer-
specific and able to indicate the presence of active OC,
despite competing with high levels of background WBC
DNA inherent within the trial samples analyzed, we
demonstrated that our serum DNAme-dynamics cor-
rectly identified 7/9 and 6/7 Carboplatin responders and
non-responders, respectively.
As we did not observe an overlap between false-
positive CA125 and false-positive DNAme samples, it is
probable that DNAme false positivity is largely triggered
by technical artefacts as a result of extremely low thresh-
olds down to a pattern frequency of 0.000003 (i.e. three
cancer patterns in the background of 1,000,000 DNA
fragments with a non-cancer pattern). Of note is that for

who had chemo-sensitivity data available, they were only included in the analysis if the pre- and/or post-treatment (after cycle 2) sample were positive (i.e. in 2
and 4 patients for CA125 and DNA methylation markers, respectively, neither sample was positive and hence response or lack of response could not be assessed)
Fig. 5 Performance of the serum DNAme marker panel in a population-based cohort for early OC diagnosis. Compared to the prospectively collected
samples within the EpiFemCare Programme, UKCTOCS samples contained a significantly higher DNA concentration (a) and larger average DNA
fragment size (b). As a result of this, we had to lower the cut-off for the three markers by a factor three (i.e. pattern frequency cut-off for #141, #204,
and #228 is 0.00027, 0.00001, and 0.0000033, respectively). For OC Set 2, we only display the result of the 50 samples for which we have analyzed both
DNA amount and fragment size (for 42 samples, we only analyzed DNA amount). In addition, in one UKCTOCS sample, the fragment size analysis

 the serum sets, which have been prospectively collected
within EpiFemCare, there was a substantial age differ-
ence between women who presented with benign pelvic
masses and women who presented with OC. This age
skew was completely intentional as our main purpose
was to benchmark DNAme markers against CA125
false-positive controls and to assess whether CA125
false-positive controls are also DNAme-false positive.
The main sources of false positivity are endometriosis,
pelvic inflammatory disease, and fibroids—all conditions
which
are
substantially
more
prevalent
(or
occur
exclusively) in premenopausal (i.e. younger women),
whereas OC is far more prevalent in older women. False
CA125-positivity can usually be explained by a CA125-
producing benign condition [47].
At the UKCTOCS prevalence screen [39], the ROCA
identified elevated/intermediate risk in 0.93% of women,
of whom 0.9% (42/4642) were diagnosed after repeat
CA125 testing, ultrasound, additional imaging, and clin-
ical assessment. Applying the three-marker DNAme test,
with a conservative (i.e. excessive background DNA will
not be an issue in prospective samples) estimate of
specificity and sensitivity of 90% and 60%, respectively,
as a second line test to ROCA-elevated women at risk
could substantially decrease the time to diagnosis in at
least half the women with OC.
OC is a low prevalence disease (i.e. lifetime risk in
the general female population is 1–2 per 100 women
[48]). The consequence of a positive screening test is an
operation under general anesthesia (i.e. laparoscopic or
open) to remove one or both ovaries/Fallopian Tubes.
Hence, a high specificity of the screening test is of the
utmost importance because the positive
predictive
value strongly depends on the prevalence of the disease
and the specificity of the test [34]. Using a highly sensi-
tive marker panel, able to detect > 80% of stage I/II
OCS (i.e. a combination of CA125 and HE4 [49]), to
pre-screen the entire population in order to narrow
down the group of women who have a high likelihood
of OC followed by the cell-free DNA test is a highly
promising strategy to achieve a stage shift with at least
50% of cancers (instead of 25% in the absence of
screening) diagnosed in stage I/II.
In addition to the use of serum and high levels of con-
taminating normal DNA from blood cells, the current
work has some further limitations. First, the number of
samples (specifically when considering only the low-DNA
samples) in the UKCTOCS cohort was limited. Second,
we were unable to assess whether the panel is specific for
OC or whether it may additionally detect other cancer
types. In serum set 3, we also analyzed serum samples
from 37 patients with non-OCs (ten, 20, and seven with
cervical, endometrial, and colorectal cancers, respectively).
Two of ten (20%), 5/20 (25%), and 1/7 (14%) were deemed
positive based on the final three-marker panels. This may

 indicate that our panel also detects other cancers arising
from the Mullerian tract (i.e. cervical and endometrial
cancers). In order to further elaborate on the aforemen-
tioned, we assessed the TCGA data. Whereas there was
no CpG site on the 450 k methylation array for region
#141,
for
regions
#204
and
#228
there
were
two
(cg15015892 and cg05021743) and one (cg22344703)
CpGs, respectively, represented on the Illumina array.
Also, other cancers could potentially be identified using
these markers (Additional file 1: Figure S13). Third, we
did not directly compare the methylation levels in the pri-
mary tumor and the matched serum samples. As we have
shown (Additional file 1: Figure S6), methylation levels in
the primary cancers are relatively homogenous across dif-
ferent stages of OCs. Hence, any differences in methyla-
tion levels detected in the serum reflect conditions such
as cancer cell turnover, release of cell-free DNA via
lymph-vessels into the bloodstream, and half-life in the
circulation—all factors which cannot be assessed by dir-
ectly measuring DNAme in the cancer.
Our method of defining tumor-specific methylation
patterns and quantifying the molecules exhibiting such
patterns, instead of determining methylation levels,
shows promising results regarding its applicability in li-
quid biopsy testing. While, in this study, the most prom-
ising tumor markers were all fully methylated, the
method, per se, is not biased towards hyper- or uni-
formly methylated patterns and, as such, is also applic-
able to situations where the markers of interest show
hypo- or heterogenous methylation, respectively.
Overall, our study provides a proof of principle that
serum DNAme markers have the potential to detect OC
within two years in advance of diagnosis and may there-
fore be able to guide personalized OC treatment. The re-
cent advance of purpose-made blood collection tubes
that stabilize cell-free DNA and prevent leakage of DNA
from blood cells [50] will facilitate clinical implementa-
tion of DNAme pattern detection in cell-free DNA as a
clinical tool in cancer medicine. In addition, recent evi-
dence demonstrates that using DNAme patterns will
allow for tissue-of-origin mapping in circulating cell-free
DNA [51, 52] which supports the view that a DNAme
marker panel is likely to cover a number of tumor-
entities.
Conclusions
Overall, and for the first time, our study suggests that
serum DNAme markers have the potential to diagnose
OCs up to two years in advance of current diagnosis and
may potentially enable individualized OC treatment. The
recent advance of purposed blood tubes will facilitate
clinical implementation of DNAme pattern detection of
cell-free DNA as a clinical tool in cancer medicine.
