Abstract
Background—Peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising approach to peanut allergy but 
reactions are frequent and some patients cannot be desensitized. The anti-IgE medication 
omalizumab (Xolair) may allow more rapid peanut updosing and decrease reactions.
Objective—To evaluate if omalizumab facilitated rapid peanut desensitization in highly allergic 
patients.
Methods—Thirty-seven subjects were randomized to omalizumab (n=29) or placebo (n=8). After 
12 weeks of treatment subjects underwent a rapid one-day desensitization of up to 250 mg of 
peanut protein, followed by weekly increases up to 2000 mg. Omalizumab was then discontinued 
and subjects continued on 2000 mg of peanut protein. They underwent an open challenge to 4000 
mg peanut protein twelve weeks after stopping study drug. If tolerated, subjects continued on 4000 
mg of peanut protein daily.

 Results—The median peanut dose tolerated on the initial desensitization day was 250 mg for 
omalizumab versus 22.5 mg for placebo treated subject. Subsequently 23 of 29 (79%) subjects 
randomized to omalizumab tolerated 2000 mg peanut protein 6 weeks after stopping omalizumab 
versus 1 of 8 (12%) receiving placebo (p<0.01). Twenty-three subjects on omalizumab versus 1 on 
placebo passed the 4000 mg food challenge. Overall reaction rates were not significantly lower in 
omalizumab versus placebo treated subjects (OR=0.57 p=0.15), although omalizumab treated 
subjects were exposed to much higher doses of peanut.
Conclusion—Omalizumab allows subjects with peanut allergy to be rapidly desensitized over as 
little as 8 weeks of peanut OIT. In the majority of subjects, this desensitization is sustained after 
omalizumab is discontinued. Additional studies will help clarify which patients would benefit 
most from this approach.

Introduction
Food allergy remains the leading cause of anaphylaxis among children and its prevalence 
has been increasing over time.1–4 In addition, food allergy is costly, increases anxiety, 
decreases patient and family quality of life, and may affect nutrition.5 Currently, the standard 
of care for food allergy is allergen avoidance and availability of self-injectable epinephrine. 
Peanut allergy is responsible for a large proportion of severe reactions to foods and, unlike 
milk and egg allergy, is typically life-long.6, 7 While recent work suggests that early 
introduction of peanut can protect against development of peanut allergy, almost 10% of 
high-risk infants evaluated in the first year of life showed sensitization to peanut, rendering 
them ineligible for early peanut exposure.8 Therefore, therapies for patients with established 
food allergies are clearly needed.
There has been substantial interest in oral immunotherapy as a treatment for peanut and 
other food allergies. Successful desensitization has been demonstrated for a number of foods 
including peanut, milk and egg.9–17 Gradual exposure to increasing amounts of allergen can 
lead to the majority of subjects tolerating doses of food sufficient to prevent reaction upon 
accidental exposure. Unfortunately, most subjects undergoing OIT experience allergic 
reactions during desensitization with approximately 20% having severe reactions requiring 
injection of epinephrine and another 10–20% of patients being refractory to oral 
desensitization.18–20 Furthermore, desensitization is less likely to be successful in patients 
with higher baseline food-specific IgE levels,10, 21 resulting in an increased risk of 
anaphylaxis with desensitization relative to continued avoidance.20 While OIT allows some 
desensitized patients to develop sustained unresponsiveness, defined as persistence of 
protection after discontinuation of OIT, this occurrs in a small fraction of desensitized 
patients, generally those lower baseline food specific IgE levels.21, 22 Lastly, current food 
allergy OIT clinical studies are hampered by drop-out rates of up to 25% due to reactions 
and non-compliance over the long periods of desensitization (2–4 years).23

 Recently, omalizumab (Xolair, Genentech South San Francisco), a monoclonal anti-IgE 
antibody, has been used to decrease reactions during oral desensitization. This medicine, 
initially approved for the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents, binds free IgE and 
prevents allergic reactions.24 We and others have reported in three open-label studies that 
omalizumab facilitates oral desensitization, in particular allowing more rapid and successful 
escalation of allergen dosing in subjects with high-risk food allergy.25–27 Furthermore, 
preliminary data suggests that interrupting IgE signaling during oral immunotherapy/antigen 
exposure may reverse established allergy through induction of both Th1 and regulatory T 
cells that inhibit the allergic response.28–31
Here we report the results of the Peanut Reactivity Reduced by Oral Tolerance in an anti-IgE 
Clinical Trial (PRROTECT), the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-
center study of the efficacy of omalizumab in conjunction with peanut oral immunotherapy.
METHODS
Study Subject Selection
This phase II study was conducted at four institutions with approval from their respective 
Institutional Review Boards and from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration through an 
investigational new drug application. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in 
the supplemental methods. All patients had positive testing for peanut by both skin prick and 
specific IgE and a significant reaction (see supplemental material) to a ≤50 mg peanut 
protein dose (cumulative dose of 88 mg peanut protein) in a double-blind placebo-controlled 
food challenge (DBPCFC). No patients were undergoing immunotherapy to environmental 
allergens and none had received omalizumab in the past. Written informed consent was 
obtained from parents or guardians of all subjects along with assent from children of 
appropriate age.
Randomization and Treatment
From June 2013 through September 2014, a total of 37 eligible participants were enrolled 
and randomized in a 3.5 to 1 ratio to receive omalizumab (N=29) or placebo (N=8) in 
conjunction with peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). The selected randomization ratio was 
based on the power analysis and on the strong therapeutic effect of omalizumab observed in 
previous open-label studies. The study design called for 28 patients in the omalizumab arm, 
but one participant randomized to omalizumab withdrew before receiving the first injection 
and was replaced per the protocol. Dosing for omalizumab (and placebo) was in accordance 
with the Xolair Global Dosing Schedule with slight modification.
Rapid Oral Desensitization and Updosing Schedule
12 weeks after the first dose of study drug, subjects began OIT with an initial, rapid oral 
desensitization day consisting of up to 10 doses (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120, 250 mg) of 
peanut protein (one peanut contains 200–250 mg of peanut protein). The doses were spaced 
30 minutes apart, until either the 250 mg dose (cumulative 490.5 mg) was tolerated or a 
significant reaction occurred (see supplementary material). The next day, the highest 
tolerated dose from the previous day was given under medical supervision; subjects were

 then discharged to take this dose once daily at home for the next week. All patients 
continued after the rapid desensitization day, regardless of the highest peanut dose achieved, 
and returned the following week for weekly updosing. Subjects who tolerated the 250 mg 
dose on the first day returned for weekly doses of 375, 500, 625, 750, 1000, 1250, 1625, and 
2000 mg of peanut protein. Subjects who tolerated less than 250 mg peanut protein on the 
first day underwent updosing in smaller increments up to twice a week (see supplementary 
material).
Discontinuation of Study Drug, OIT Maintenance
At week 19, the last dose of blinded study drug was given to subjects who were tolerating 
the 1625 mg dose and they progressed to 2000 mg at week 20. Subjects who failed to reach 
1625 mg received additional doses of study drug while continuing to updose for a maximum 
of 6 additional weeks. The primary outcome of the study was the ability to tolerate 2000 mg 
of peanut protein 6 weeks after withdrawal of study drug, defined as at least one day during 
the preceding week when this dose was consumed with no reaction. If the 2000 mg dose of 
peanut protein was not reached after the six-week extension, study drug was stopped but 
weekly updosing continued as tolerated. Those who could not tolerate 250 mg peanut 
protein by week 19 were considered treatment failures and had the option to receive open 
label omalizumab with peanut OIT, but initial therapy remained blinded (that is patients and 
investigators were not aware which treatment these subjects had initially received) Subjects 
who transitioned to open label omalizumab continued on the highest dose of peanut protein 
tolerated while receiving omalizumab for 12 weeks, and then followed the same updosing 
protocol as in the blinded portion of the study.
Challenge to 4000 mg peanut protein
Study subjects tolerating a daily oral dose of 2000 mg peanut protein underwent an oral food 
challenge with peanut 12 weeks after their last dose of study drug (week 31 for subjects who 
tolerated 2000 mg of peanut protein at week 20). Three doses of peanut protein were given 
30 minutes apart (1250, 1250, and 1500 mg) for a cumulative dose of 4000 mg. Subjects 
who reacted during the challenge maintained a 2000 mg daily dose of peanut protein for the 
reminder of the study. Subjects who did not react continued on 4000 mg peanut protein 
daily.
Assessments
Total peanut-specific IgE levels and SPT to peanut extract were assessed at baseline, 12 
weeks after the last dose of study drug and at the end of the study. Adverse events (AEs), as 
defined by FDA regulation, were documented for the duration of the study and recorded and 
graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.03.32 Events not included in the NCI-CTCAE 
listing were graded grade 1–5 (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, death) according to 
the General Grade Definitions. Allergic reactions to peanut OIT were graded following the 
Bock criteria (see supplement).33

 Statistical Analysis
Full details of the statistical analysis are in the supplementary appendix. Briefly, primary and 
secondary endpoints were compared between the study arms using Fisher’s exact test. 
Prespecified analyses were conducted using intention to treat (ITT). Reactions per dose were 
compared between study arms using Generalized Estimated Equations with logit link. P-
values ≤0.05 were considered significant.
Role of the funding source
The sponsors of the study had no role in study design or data collection. After the study 
started DTU changed employment from Boston Children’s Hospital to Genentech, one of 
the sponsors. He subsequently was involved in data analysis, data interpretation and writing 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Baseline characteristics and initial food challenge
Sixty-nine subjects underwent baseline food challenge to peanut. Thirty-seven of these 
subjects were randomized, 29 to omalizumab and 8 to placebo (Figure 1). Baseline 
characteristics, including dose of peanut protein eliciting a reaction, of the 37 subjects 
enrolled in the study are presented in Table 1 and were similar between groups. The median 
age of the subjects was 10 years, and the median peanut-specific IgE levels were 91 and 88 
kUA/L in the omalizumab and placebo groups, respectively. The median cumulative peanut 
dose eliciting a reaction during the baseline DBPCFC was 38 mg (range 0.5–88 mg) for 
subjects randomized to omalizumab and 88 mg for those randomized to placebo (range 13–
88 mg). Seventeen subjects required treatment with epinephrine during the baseline food 
challenge.
Initiation of Study Drug and Oral Desensitization
Of the 29 subjects randomized to omalizumab [intention to treat (ITT) population], one 
subject withdrew before receiving the first dose of omalizumab and was replaced per the 
protocol; another withdrew before commencing OIT due to a hospitalization for an eating 
disorder judged to be unrelated to the study drug. Twenty-three of the 27 subjects remaining 
in the omalizumab group completed the 250 mg desensitization versus 1 of the 8 subjects 
treated with placebo (p=0.0003, Figure 2). The median tolerated dose after this first day of 
the desensitization process for subjects receiving omalizumab was 250 mg (490.5mg 
cumulative) versus 22.5 mg for those on placebo.
The 24 subjects who successfully tolerated the rapid first day of the desensitization process 
(23 omalizumab treated and 1 placebo treated) had their peanut dose increased weekly up to 
2000 mg of peanut protein (equivalent to 8–10 peanuts) over 8 weeks. Twenty-one of 29 
omalizumab and 1 of 8 placebo treated subjects reached 2000 mg of peanut protein by study 
week 20 (p<0.01, ITT population).

 Primary endpoint: ability to tolerate 2000 mg peanut dose 6 weeks after withdrawal of 
study drug
The primary endpoint of this study was the ability to tolerate a 2000 mg dose of peanut 
protein 6 weeks after stopping omalizumab or placebo injection. This was achieved in 23 of 
29 of subjects randomized to omalizumab (79% of the ITT population,) and 23 of 27 who 
actually received peanut immunotherapy (85%) compared to 1 of 8 (12.5%) receiving 
placebo (p<0.01 for ITT population, Table 2).
Treatment failures
Six subjects (75%) in the placebo group and two (7.4%) in the omalizumab group were 
unable to tolerate 250 mg of peanut protein after 8 weeks of desensitization. These subjects 
were considered treatment failures, and received open label omalizumab and peanut OIT, as 
per protocol. All 8 were able to tolerate 2000 mg of peanut protein while receiving open-
label omalizumab. In total, 31 of the 35 (89%) subjects [31/33 (94%) who received 
omalizumab and peanut OIT] were able to tolerate 2000 mg of peanut 6 weeks after 
stopping omalizumab. The two subjects (one initially randomized to omalizumab and one to 
placebo) who failed to reach this endpoint both had symptoms suggestive of Eosinophilic 
Esophagitis (EoE), one documented by esophageal biopsy (discussed below).
Oral challenge with 4000 mg peanut protein
Subjects able to tolerate 2000 mg of peanut protein continued on this dose and underwent an 
open peanut challenge with a cumulative dose of 4000 mg of peanut protein 12 weeks after 
discontinuation of study drug (a secondary endpoint). Twenty-two of 29 subjects 
randomized to omalizumab (22 of 27 who actually received peanut immunotherapy) and 1 of 
8 randomized to placebo passed this challenge (Table 3, p= 0.002, ITT population). They 
continued to consume 4000 mg of peanut protein daily, in a form of their choosing. One 
subject who failed this challenge resumed taking peanut at 2000 mg daily. Sixteen of the 22 
omalizumab treated subjects and the single placebo treated subject who passed the 4000 mg 
challenge maintained this dose for an additional 21 weeks (the end of the study). Six of the 
omalizumab treated subjects who passed the 4000 mg challenge subsequently had allergic 
reactions on the 4000 mg maintenance dose including 4 requiring epinephrine. All of these 
subjects were successfully converted to a 2000 mg peanut maintenance dose.
Safety data and reactions
Safety data were characterized by body system and Bock grade.33 Focusing on the initial 
rapid desensitization (since most placebo subjects never tolerated 250 mg of peanut protein) 
4 of 28 omalizumab treated subjects versus 6 of 8 placebo treated subjects had significant 
(Bock grade 2) reactions. Grade 1 reactions were seen in 16 of 28 omalizumab treated 
subjects versus 5 of 8 placebo treated. Overall, reactions occurred after 7.8% of OIT doses 
given in the omalizumab arm versus 16.8% in placebo despite omalizumab subjects 
receiving higher doses of peanut. This difference was not statistically significant (OR=0.57, 
p=0.15). Most reactions were mild (Bock grade 1) and localized to the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract. The majority of reactions occurred during the initial desensitization day and

 subsequent dose escalation visits. No significant reactions were attributed to omalizumab or 
placebo administration.
There were seven grade 3 reactions judged to be study-related: 3 in subjects on blinded 
omalizumab, 1 on placebo and 3 in subjects on open-label omalizumab (see supplementary 
table 4). All reactions were reversible and were thought to be due to peanut exposure. A total 
of 14 reactions requiring epinephrine treatment occurred in 8 subjects on OIT. Seven 
reactions occurred in subjects on blinded therapy: 3 reactions in 2 patients in the placebo 
arm and 4 reactions in 3 patients in the omalizumab group. The remaining 7 reactions 
occurred in subjects on open label omalizumab. All subjects who received epinephrine 
recovered with no clinical sequelae and continued in the study. NSAID (ibuprofen) 
ingestion, viral infections and exercise were noted to be possible cofactors. One reaction 
requiring epinephrine occurred in a college student in the maintenance phase who did not 
take the peanut doses for 6 days and then, without contacting the site, took 4000 mg of 
peanut protein.
Three subjects developed persistent GI symptoms consistent with EoE and stopped peanut 
dosing. At study week 14, an omalizumab treated subject developed GI symptoms, that were 
consistent with EoE and was withdrawn from the study at week 17 due to persistent 
symptoms; endoscopy was not performed. A second omalizumab treated subject withdrew at 
extension week 2 due to persistent GI symptoms and an esophageal biopsy taken 11 days 
after stopping peanut while on proton pump inhibitor therapy showed 21 eosinophils/high 
power field, consistent with a diagnosis of EoE. A placebo treated subject developed 
persistent GI symptoms requiring reduction of peanut dose. Endoscopy done at week 23 
while on high dose proton pump inhibitor therapy demonstrated EoE (peak 29 eos/hpf) and 
eosinophilic gastritis; peanut OIT was stopped. In all 3 subjects, symptoms resolved with 
discontinuation of peanut intake; follow up endoscopies were not performed.
Changes in immunologic parameters
Subjects treated with omalizumab showed decreased wheal size on skin testing but increased 
peanut-specific IgE values at week 31 compared to baseline, (P<0.0001 for both) consistent 
with data from other desensitization studies (Figure 3).9, 31, 34–36 Although Week 31 (11–12 
weeks after stopping omalizumab) occurred at about 3 half-lives after last omalizumab dose 
(the half-life of omalizumab in the circulation is about 26 days)37, the small amounts of 
omalizumab remaining in circulation at that time is thought to only minimally affect skin 
test reactivity.38 Increased peanut-specific IgE and decreased SPT wheal size were also seen 
in subjects who received open label omalizumab. The single placebo treated subject who 
tolerated the 4000 mg food challenge, showed increases in both peanut-specific IgE and 
SPT.
DISCUSSION
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrates that a short treatment 
course of omalizumab improves the safety and tolerability of peanut updosing during peanut 
OIT, allowing a large majority of subjects to achieve a 2000 mg maintenance dose of peanut 
protein in a median time of 8 weeks. As the first placebo controlled trial of omalizumab with

 peanut OIT, this study extends our previous work25 and that of others,39 and provides 
rigorous scientific confirmation that omalizumab can facilitate rapid OIT of high-risk peanut 
allergic subjects that is maintained even after omalizumab treatment is discontinued. Thus, 
omalizumab pretreatment allowed 23 of 29 subjects to tolerate 250 mg of peanut protein 
(cumulative dose 490 mg), roughly the amount found in 2 peanuts, during the first day of 
desensitization, compared to 1 of 8 placebo treated subjects (median dose 22.5 mg). 
Furthermore, 23 of 29 (76% of the ITT population) omalizumab treated subjects were able 
to quickly achieve a 2000 mg maintenance dose of peanut protein and maintain non-
reactivity for 6 weeks after discontinuing omalizumab versus 1 of 8 placebo treated subjects. 
Although subjects likely retained some protection from omalizumab at this time point (the 
half-life of omalizumab is 26 days), successful achievement of this endpoint indicated that 
omalizumab could indeed facilitate rapid dose escalation to a 2000mg dose of peanut. 
Moreover, 16 omalizumab subjects tolerated 4000mg of peanut protein and an additional 7 
tolerated 2000 mg 33 weeks after discontinuing therapy (>9 half-lives after the last 
omalizumab dose) demonstrating that the presence of omalizumab was not required to 
maintain the peanut-desensitized state.
The rapid desensitization in subjects treated with omalizumab in our study contrasts with the 
results of investigations utilizing oral peanut desensitization alone. For example, in a 
previous study of conventional OIT (without omalizumab), only 10 of 39 subjects achieved 
the highest initial dose of 50 mg of peanut protein on the initial desensitization day.9 In 
another study, Blumchen et al reported that only 5 of 22 subjects were able to tolerate 125 
mg of peanut protein after a 7 day rush desensitization.23 The final dose tolerated after this 
7-day desensitization was not significantly higher than the dose subjects reacted to at 
baseline.
Moreover, in our study, the final target dose of peanut (2000 mg) was achieved in the 
majority of omalizumab-treated patients (21 of 29 subjects randomized to omalizumab, of 
whom 27 received both omalizumab and OIT) after only 8 weeks of desensitization. In 
contrast, other recent studies not utilizing omalizumab reported much slower increases in 
peanut dosing, ranging from 4140 to 44 weeks11 to reach a final dose of 800 to 4000 mg 
peanut protein. For example, Anagoustou et al10 demonstrated that peanut dosing could be 
increased to 800 mg of peanut protein over approximately 16 weeks, but only 24 of 49 
subjects were able to tolerate 1400 mg peanut protein after 26 weeks of therapy. Thus, use of 
omalizumab allowed rapid desensitization to a high dose of peanut.
Wood et al.41 recently reported that omalizumab can facilitate milk OIT, and that rates of 
allergic reactions were significantly lower in omalizumab treated subjects, utilizing a long 
desensitization period (>2 years of treatment with omalizumab) and a post-treatment oral 
food challenge. In this study, 71.4% of placebo treated subjects (and 89% of omalizumab 
treated subjects) passed the final 10,000 mg oral food challenge, consistent with previous 
studies showing that slow, persistent OIT updosing without omalizumab can be successful. 
Successful treatment at Month 32 in this study was associated with lower milk-specific IgE 
levels (median 24 kUa/L), as has been previously suggested.10 Our study included patients 
with high peanut specific IgE levels (median 91 kUa/L) who may be at increased risk of 
having difficulty with conventional immunotherapy.21, 23, 34, 42–45

 The use of omalizumab allowed rapid desensitization to 2000 mg of peanut protein with low 
rates of peanut reactions and adverse effects. Although the reaction rates were not 
statistically lower with omalizumab (7.8% of doses) compared to placebo (16.8%), 
omalizumab treated subjects were exposed to much higher doses of peanut protein. For 
example, during the initial rapid desensitization day, grade 2 reactions were observed in 4 of 
27 omalizumab treated subjects versus 6 of 8 placebo treated subjects, but omalizumab 
treated subjects reached a median dose of 250 mg peanut protein compared to 22.5 mg for 
placebo. The safety of omalizumab in facilitating OIT therefore may be underestimated 
because of the study design. It is important to note, however, that rates of reactions are likely 
to be increased in peanut allergic inidividuals undergoing OIT compared to continued 
avoidance.
Three subjects (2 treated with omalizumab) developed persistent GI symptoms consistent 
with EoE. Peanut consumption was stopped in these subjects leading to complete resolution 
of symptoms. EoE has been observed in other trials of OIT at rates comparable to those seen 
in this study,46 consistent with the idea that omalizumab is not effective for treatment of 
EoE47, although this study was not powered to evaluate rates of EoE. It is possible the rapid 
updosing used in this study increases the risk of EoE. Of note, of 27 patients randomized to 
omalizumab and who received peanut OIT, 23 tolerated 2000 mg of peanut protein during 
the double-blind phase of the trial, 2 more tolerated this dose after open label omalizumab, 
and 2 failed to achieve this endpoint due to EoE like symptoms. The inability to tolerate high 
doses of antigen due to persistent GI symptoms consistent with EoE remains a significant 
obstacle to successful use of OIT48 and omalizumab does not seem to significantly decrease 
this risk.
Interestingly, a single placebo treated subject was able to meet all study endpoints, and 2 
subjects who were treatment failures on blinded omalizumab were able to meet all study 
endpoints when they received open-label omalizumab. Baseline characteristics of these 
subjects were unremarkable. The latter 2 subjects suggest some subjects may benefit from a 
prolonged course of omalizumab prior to OIT; alternatively, the likelihood of developing 
allergic symptoms during OIT may be lower in the setting of open-label omalizumab 
administration.
A potential concern with use of omalizumab is that subjects may be at risk for allergic 
reactions once omalizumab treatment is stopped (week 19 of this study, just before subjects 
received their first 2000 mg dose of peanut). Six of 22 omalizumab treated subjects who 
passed the 4000 mg food challenge at week 31 had to reduce their peanut dose at some point 
over the following 21 weeks because of allergic reactions. However, all were able to then 
safely tolerate a daily maintenance dose of 2000 mg of peanut protein, suggesting the 2000 
mg dose may be easier to tolerate. Missed doses of peanut, use of NSAIDs, exercise and 
concurrent infections may all increase the risk of reactions. Whether using omalizumab 
beyond the 20 weeks employed in our study would reduce the frequency of these reactions is 
not clear.
In our current study, we did not examine sustained unresponsiveness, although we plan to 
evaluate for this following additional time on maintenance therapy and after peanut-specific

 IgE levels fall to <10 kU/L (median peanut-specific IgE at week 52 was 70kU/L). 
Unfortunately, sustained unresponsiveness after OIT appears to be difficult to achieve even 
with prolonged intake of high daily doses of peanut, except in patients who begin OIT with 
low food-specific IgE levels21, 22, 41. Whether high (e.g. 2000 mg) or low (e.g. 250 or 
300mg) dose of peanut protein are optimal for induction of sustained unresponsiveness 
remains unknown. Further study of the most appropriate maintenance dose and the length of 
omalizumab and maintenance therapy would help to optimize this treatment. Given that 
peanut OIT does not consistently lead to sustained unresponsiveness, the benefits of 
protection against accidental exposure versus the risks of allergic reactions occurring during 
OIT must be balanced before considering the use of omalizumab facilitated OIT.
There are a several weaknesses of our study. First, the sample size was relatively small and 
included only 8 placebo subjects. We chose this low number of placebo treated subject 
because the power analysis, based on our previous open-label study, indicated that 8 placebo 
subject was more than sufficient, and because we hoped to limit the number of subjects 
exposed to the rapid updosing of peanut on the first day of desensitization (250mg maximum 
dose, cumulative 490 mg) that was expected induce allergic reactions in placebo treated 
subjects. While only 37 subjects were randomized, this is one of the largest trials of peanut 
desensitization to date and was sufficient to demonstrate a highly significant difference 
between the placebo and omalizumab treated groups in achieving the 2000 mg maintenance 
peanut dose.
Second, given the small number of placebo patients, the potent therapeutic effect of 
omalizumab in this situation, subjects may have deduced which therapy they were receiving. 
The ability to tolerate 250 mg on the initial updosing day would not be expected in placebo 
subjects and may have been a clue that subjects were getting active therapy. In addition, 
omalizumab may have improved control of concomitant asthma or allergic rhinitis. 
However, the 250 mg dose was achieved in one placebo-treated patient, and four 
omalizumab-treated patients did not achieve the 250 mg dose on the first updosing day, 
suggesting that the blinding was effective.
Finally, three previous studies showed that treatment alone with an anti-IgE monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) led to increased tolerance to peanut with reactions at median doses of 1315 
mg39, 500 mg49 or 6500 mg of peanut50, with wide variation within each study. It should be 
noted that subjects in the three studies had significantly lower median peanut-specific IgE 
levels (14.3 and 25.9 kUa/L, and one not reported) than in our study (91 kUa/L), smaller 
skin prick test to peanut (only reported in one study: 7.8 vs. 11 mm) and tolerated higher 
doses of peanut at baseline food challenge (e.g. 80 mg in the study by Savage et al.50) 
Although some of our omalizumab-treated patients might have been able to tolerate 250mg 
or even 2000 mg of peanut in one day after omalizumab treatment alone, our experience is 
that most of our patient, particularly those with high baseline peanut specific IgE, require 
desensitization over several weeks to reach doses of 2000 mg. Most importantly, the goals of 
these three studies were significantly different from those of our omalizumab-facilitated OIT 
approach, in which omalizumab treatment is limited to 5 to 6 months as opposed to 
indefinitely.

 OIT remains a promising approach for patients with peanut and other food allergies, but it is 
still not recommended for general use, in part because reaction rates are high and many 
patients are sensitized to more than one food allergen. However, our study demonstrates that 
peanut OIT in combination with omalizumab allows for rapid, effective desensitization in 
the majority of peanut allergic patients, including those with high peanut-specific IgE levels. 
While omalizumab is expensive, requires repeated injections and is associated with a risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions, we suggest that the benefits of omalizumab-enabled OIT may 
outweigh these downsides; additional studies will be required to further evaluate this 
proposition.
