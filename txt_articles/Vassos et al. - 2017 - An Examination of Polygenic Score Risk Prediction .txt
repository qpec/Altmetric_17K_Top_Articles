ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have successfully summarized genome-wide effects of genetic
variants in schizophrenia with significant predictive power. In a clinical sample of first-episode psychosis (FEP)
patients, we estimated the ability of PRSs to discriminate case-control status and to predict the development of
schizophrenia as opposed to other psychoses.
METHODS: The sample (445 case and 265 control subjects) was genotyped on the Illumina HumanCore Exome
BeadChip with an additional 828 control subjects of African ancestry genotyped on the Illumina Multi-Ethnic
Genotyping Array. To calculate PRSs, we used the results from the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
schizophrenia meta-analysis. We examined the association of PRSs with case-control status and with schizophrenia
versus other psychoses in European and African ancestry FEP patients and in a second sample of 248 case subjects
with chronic psychosis.
RESULTS: PRS had good discriminative ability of case-control status in FEP European ancestry individuals (9.4% of
the variance explained, p , 1026), but lower in individuals of African ancestry (R2 5 1.1%, p 5 .004). Furthermore,
PRS distinguished European ancestry case subjects who went on to acquire a schizophrenia diagnosis from those
who developed other psychotic disorders (R2 5 9.2%, p 5 .002).
CONCLUSIONS: PRS was a powerful predictor of case-control status in a European sample of patients with FEP,
even though a large proportion did not have an established diagnosis of schizophrenia at the time of assessment.
PRS was significantly different between those case subjects who developed schizophrenia from those who did not,
although the discriminative accuracy may not yet be sufficient for clinical utility in FEP.

Recent
developments
in
genetics
research,
particularly
genome-wide association studies (GWASs), have greatly
improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of
complex disorders such as schizophrenia. The additive con-
tributions
of
hundreds
or
thousands
of
polymorphisms,
regulating different biochemical pathways related to the
phenotype, determine the genetic liability to complex disor-
ders (1). It has been established that schizophrenia is highly
polygenic, with many common genetic variants contributing to
the risk of the disease. In the latest meta-analysis of GWASs
for schizophrenia (2), 108 independent regions associated with
the disease were identified.
Risk prediction remains a primary focus of genetic studies.
In schizophrenia, this has been largely based on family history,
but with the progress in GWASs, an increasing number of
susceptibility variants have been found that contribute to risk
prediction (3). However, each genetic marker individually
explains only a tiny proportion of the genetic variation with
insignificant predictive power (4). For this reason, methods
have been developed to examine disorder prediction by
genetic variants en masse, via summarizing variation across
many nominally associated loci into quantitative scores that
are tested in independent samples (5). One such approach is
the generation of polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which repre-
sents a promising technique for predicting risk (6,7).
PRSs have been successfully associated with schizo-
phrenia, and as the size of the discovery sample increases,
their accuracy and predictive power improve. For example,

 from explaining approximately 3% of the variance of a case-
control sample in 2009 (5), they now explain approximately
18% (2). To establish whether PRSs may be a useful tool for
risk prediction, replication and further studies in independent
samples are necessary. Importantly, these samples should
represent the typical patients we see in the clinical practice
rather than the severe end of the phenotype that is more easily
identified and recruited for research (8). For this reason, in a
sample of patients recruited during a first episode of psychosis
(FEP) and ancestry-matched control subjects from South
London, we measured the ability of PRS to discriminate case
subjects from control subjects and among case subjects to
discriminate schizophrenia from other psychoses.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Sample Description
Participants were recruited as part of the Biomedical Research
Centre (BRC) for Mental Health Genetics and Psychosis (GAP)
study (9). The study systematically recruited patients aged 18
to 65 years who presented to adult psychiatric services in the
South London and Maudsley National Health Service Founda-
tion Mental Health Trust between December 2005 and Octo-
ber 2011 with a first episode of nonorganic psychosis (ICD-10
codes: F20–F29 and F30–F33) (10) and unaffected control
subjects. This is a multi-ethnic sample, reflecting the demo-
graphic characteristics of the area. Clinical diagnoses of case
subjects were validated using the Schedules for Clinical
Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) interview (11), and
control subjects were screened with the Psychosis Screening
Questionnaire (12). Case subjects who met criteria for organic
psychosis, intellectual disability (IQ , 70), or transient psy-
chosis (,7 days of symptoms) and control subjects who
reported previous diagnosis of psychosis or had a first-
degree relative with psychosis were excluded.
Because the diagnostic evaluation of FEP patients is
difficult due to the short history of illness and variable
symptoms seen (13), the following diagnostic approaches
were used: 1) consensus diagnoses based on discussions
between experienced clinicians who interviewed the patients
using the SCAN to collect symptoms characteristics, fre-
quency, and duration over the 4 weeks preceding the assess-
ment; using the SCAN, Present State Examination Data, and
applying the Operational Criteria Checklists (OPCRIT) compu-
terized algorithms (14) to obtain diagnoses according to 2)
DSM-IV and 3) ICD-10 classification systems and 4) clinical
diagnoses made by the treating psychiatrists collected retro-
spectively from the electronic medical records of the patients.
This study was granted ethical approval by the South London
and Maudsley and Institute of Psychiatry Local Research Ethics
Committee. All individuals included gave informed written con-
sent to be assessed at baseline and to be contacted again at
follow-up; they gave us permission to access their clinical
records and to publish data originating from the study.
For replication of the utility of PRS to discriminate between
schizophrenia and other psychoses, a second sample recruited
from the same geographical area, the IMPACT (Improving
Physical Health and Reducing Substance Use in Psychosis)
study (15), was used. This comprises 280 patients with chronic
psychosis (mean illness duration, 16 years) who participated in a
randomized controlled trial of a psychosocial health promotion
intervention. Diagnoses were extracted from the documented
ICD-10 diagnosis in the clinical notes at the time of recruitment
(16). Because this was a case-only sample, PRSs from the
IMPACT study were compared with control subjects from the
GAP sample. Both samples were genotyped on the same array,
and genotypic data were processed and analyzed together.
Because the GAP sample included only 70 African Euro-
pean control subjects, we obtained a second sample of sub-
Sahara African ancestry control subjects collected from the
same geographical area for the South London Ethnicity and
Stroke Study (SLESS) (17). The control subjects were recruited
by random sampling of general practitioner lists from South
London, and these data are available as part of a collaboration
between the BRC for Mental Health and the Guy’s and
St Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust BRC
(see detailed description of this cohort in the Supplement).
Genotyping Procedures
DNA was extracted from blood or cheek swabs (80% and 20%
of the GAP sample, respectively). When several extractions for
the same individual were performed, we used DNA from blood.
The samples were genotyped at the South London and
Maudsley NHS Trust/King's College London BRC Genomics
Laboratory on the Illumina HumanCore Exome BeadChip. This
array provides genetic data for identified genome-wide signifi-
cant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a cost-effective
genome-wide coverage of 265,000 highly informative tag SNPs,
plus 245,000 rare, predicted deleterious variants. The latter
were excluded from our analysis. Genotypes were processed
using the GenomeStudio Analysis software version 2011.1
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).
Quality control (QC) included exclusion of SNPs with minor
allele frequency (MAF) ,1%, SNPs and individuals with geno-
typic failure .1%, SNPs with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium p ,
1025 in control subjects, mismatch between recorded and
genotypic sex, and related individuals. Cryptic relatedness and
duplicated samples were identified with pairwise identity by
descent method (pi-hat . .1875). Imputation was performed with
IMPUTE2 (18) based on the 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference
panel (19), using haplotypes from all the ancestral populations
(20). The imputed markers underwent a second stage of QC to
exclude SNPs that were missing in .5% of individuals or had
imputation information score (INFO) ,0.8. QC was performed
with PLINK 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) (21).
The SLESS sample was genotyped using the Illumina Multi-
Ethnic Genotyping Array, a multi-ethnic platform with .1.7 million
markers (http://www.illumina.com/products/infinium-multi-ethnic-
global-array.html). After repeating the above QC procedures, we
merged the two samples using only the markers that had been
genotyped in both arrays. We excluded any related individuals
between the two datasets. We excluded any markers that differed
between the two African control groups (detailed QC methods
can be found in the Supplement).
Calculation of PRSs
We used the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC2)
schizophrenia meta-analysis (2) as discovery sample to calculate

 PRSs for each individual in our sample as the weighted sum of
the risk alleles they carried. Sample relatedness between the
GAP data and PGC2 was tested using the GWAS data. We
identified that 80 individuals were already included in PGC2 as
part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (22);
hence, we used the PGC2 leave-one-out discovery dataset,
excluding the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2
sample. To use informative and independent markers, we
selected SNPs with MAF .10% and INFO .0.9, according to
the PGC2 protocol, and we included only one SNP from the
major histocompatibility complex linkage disequilibrium (LD)
region on chromosome 6 (hg19; chr6:27-33Mb).
Population stratification was corrected with principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA) using EIGENSTRAT (23). Two subsam-
ples were selected for further analysis based on the loadings
on the first
two principal components (PCs), one with
European-only ancestry and one with African ancestry (com-
bining African and African Caribbean origin). To further correct
for stratification, we repeated the PCA in each of the two
subsamples separately, and we retained 10 PCs for each,
which were used as covariates in the PRS analyses.
We performed clumping separately in the European and
African subsamples by retaining the SNP with the smallest
p value from each LD block (excluding SNPs with r2 . .1 in
250-kb windows). Each allele was weighted by the logarithm
of the odds ratio (OR) as estimated in the PGC2 study. Ten
different PRSs, using subsets of the total SNPs based on
different p value thresholds for the association with schizo-
phrenia in the discovery PGC sample, were computed and
were compared for the best discrimination between case and
control subjects. To construct PRS, we used the PRS software
(PRSice; http://prsice.info/) (24).
Statistical Analysis
Association of PRSs with case-control status was performed
with logistic regression, and Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2 was calcu-
lated to measure the proportion of variance explained. To esti-
mate heritability (i.e., variance explained at the liability scale)
assuming a liability-threshold model, a lifetime risk of 1% for
psychosis and 0.72% for schizophrenia (25), and adjusting for
case-control ascertainment, we used the GEnetic Analysis Re-
pository software (http://sourceforge.net/p/gbchen/wiki/GEAR/;
Supplemental Table S1). For each analysis we estimated and
analyzed PRSs at 10 different levels of significance at the
discovery sample. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing in
each sample (European FEP, African FEP, European chronic
psychosis), we estimated the equivalent number of effective tests
using the correlation matrix of PRS at the 10 p value thresholds
(http://gump.qimr.edu.au/general/daleN/matSpD/) and performed
Bonferroni correction on the sum of effective tests across the
three samples. The effective number of independent variables
were 5, 6.4, and 5.3, respectively, and the significance threshold
required to keep type I error rate at 5% was .003.
To evaluate the specificity of PRS to schizophrenia, we
divided case subjects according to each diagnostic approach
(consensus, OPCRIT/DSM, OPCRIT/ICD, clinical) into two
diagnostic categories, schizophrenia and other psychoses,
including delusional disorder, acute and transient psychotic
disorder, schizoaffective disorder, other nonorganic psychotic
disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression. We
explored standardized mean differences (SMDs) of the PRSs
between the case subjects stratified in the two diagnostic
categories and control subjects (each diagnostic category was
compared with all the control subjects), and we compared with
logistic regression PRSs between case subjects who had met
criteria for schizophrenia with at least one of the four diagnostic
approaches and case subjects with any other psychosis.
To better visualize the effect of PRS on the risk of psychosis,
we estimated case-control OR and 95% confidence intervals
dividing our sample in quintiles by PRS. To be able to compare
our estimates with the outcomes of previous studies (2,26) and
to adjust for oversampling of control subjects approximating a
prevalence of psychosis of 0.72% (25), we used a simulation
method to extract deciles from our observed data. Detailed
statistical methods are presented in the Supplement.
RESULTS
Genotyping and Quality Control
From quality control procedures, 710 individuals (445 case
subjects with FEP and 265 control subjects) and 290,871
genotyped markers with MAF .1% were available for analysis
from the GAP study and 248 case subjects from the IMPACT
study. After imputation 5.2 × 106 variants with INFO score
.0.8 were identified and reduced with clumping to 56,059
independent variants for PRS analysis. Sex, DNA origin, age,
and ethnic distribution of case and control subjects are
presented in Table 1. The GAP sample sex, ethnicity, and
age distribution well represent a FEP adult population from the
study geographical area as indicated by previously published
studies looking at this patient group (27). After identifying the
two main ethnic groups in the GAP study (Supplemental
Figure S2) and performing separate PCA in each, we excluded
11 additional outliers in the European subsample, leaving 328
(161 case and 167 control subjects) individuals for the final
analysis from GAP and 131 case subjects from IMPACT. For
the African subsample, 189 case and 69 control subjects from
GAP as well as 828 control subjects from SLESS were
included in the analysis.
Polygenic Prediction of Case-Control Status
In the overall GAP sample the best discrimination of case-
control status by the PRS was achieved with the inclusion of all
the independent markers after clumping (n 5 65,479), which
explained 3.6% of the variance (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2; p 5
1025). When we stratified our analysis by the two main ethnic
groups in the GAP study, we observed that PRS explained 9.4%
of the variance in individuals of European ancestry (5.2% on the
liability scale, p 5 9.5 × 1027), but it was not predictive of case-
control status in individuals of African ancestry (p 5 .08). Optimal
discrimination was achieved with the inclusion of markers with a
p value significance threshold (pT) ,.1. After the expansion of
the African control subjects with the inclusion of SLESS, PRS
explained 1.1% of the variance (p 5 .004) in individuals of
African descent (Supplemental Table S2). The bar plots of
variance explained by PRS in Europeans and Africans at 10 pT
values in the discovery sample are presented in Figure 1.

 In the GAP European subsample, case subjects had on
average higher adjusted PRSs than control subjects, with
SMD of 0.54, after correction for population stratification. The
density
distributions
of
PRSs
were
partially
overlapping
(Figure 2), demonstrating low discriminative power for FEP
(area under the curve 5 0.65). In European chronic case
subjects from the IMPACT sample the optimal case-control
discrimination by PRS was also achieved at pT , .1, explaining
6% of the variance (p 5 1024). We observed that case
subjects with chronic psychosis had lower PRS than FEP
case subjects, but the difference was not significant.
Discrimination Between Schizophrenia and Other
Psychoses
In Figure 3 we present the SMDs of PRSs between case
subjects divided into two diagnostic categories (those who
had met criteria for schizophrenia with at least one of the four
diagnostic approaches described previously and those who
had not) and control subjects. Diagnosis with at least one of
the four diagnostic approaches was available in 151 European
and 177 African FEP case subjects and 132 European case
subjects with chronic psychoses. We observed that both
schizophrenia and other psychoses groups in all three sam-
ples had higher PRSs than their corresponding control sub-
jects and that, in European samples, individuals with a
diagnosis of schizophrenia had higher PRSs than other
psychoses.
In the GAP FEP European subsample we repeated the
case-control analysis stratifying case subjects by diagnosis
and observed that PRS was more predictive for case subjects
with schizophrenia (R2 5 16.3%, p 5 3.7 × 1027) than for case
subjects with other psychoses (R2 5 2.7%, p 5 .03). In a case-
only analysis, comparing those with at least one diagnosis of

 schizophrenia in any of the four diagnostic approaches
(n 5 86) versus those FEP case subjects who never met
diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (n 5 65), we found that
schizophrenia case subjects had higher PRS than case subjects
with other psychoses (Nagelkerke’s R2 5 9.2%, p 5 .002).
In the IMPACT chronic psychosis sample, stratification by the
recorded ICD-10 diagnosis to schizophrenia and other psychoses
resulted, similar to the findings in FEP, in higher PRS for case
subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia than case subjects with
any other psychoses (R2 5 6%, p 5 .008). In a case-control
analysis, PRS discriminated control subjects from chronic case
subjects with schizophrenia (R2 5 10%, p 5 1.2 × 1025) but not
from psychotic patients with other diagnoses (p 5 .2).
In the FEP African sample, we observed a different PRS
prediction profile. For schizophrenia case subjects, the optimal
discrimination from control subjects was achieved with the
inclusion of fewer markers in the PRS (pT , .001, R2 5 2.4%, p
5 2 × 1024), while in other psychoses versus control subjects no
pT reached significance (lowest p value .13 at pT , .1). A case-only
analysis of Africans showed the best discrimination between
schizophrenia and other psychosis in PRS constructed with fewer
markers (optimal pT , 1024, R2 5 7.5%, p 5 .002), and the
difference disappeared with the inclusion of more markers (pT .
.05). Detailed presentation of stratified analyses by diagnosis in the
three samples is shown in Supplemental Figures S5–S8
OR of FEP in Relation to PRS in Europeans
To represent visually the effect of PRS on the risk of
psychosis, we ranked our European FEP subsample by PRS
adjusted for the 10 PCs, we divided it in quintiles, and we
measured case-control OR with the middle quintile (median
PRS) as the baseline. With the increase of PRS we notice a
gradient increase in the risk of psychosis, with the fifth quintile
having higher OR and the first quintile having lower OR in
comparison with the median. A similar profile was observed in
the case-only comparison of schizophrenia with other psy-
choses (Figure 4). After simulation to a larger sample with the
same characteristics and using the lowest PRS group as
baseline, this translates to an OR of 7.7 comparing the top and
bottom deciles (Supplemental Figure S9).
DISCUSSION
Polygenic Discrimination of Case-Control Status and
Risk Prediction in FEP
The dual goals of schizophrenia genetics are to improve our
understanding of the biology of the disorder with the hope of
thereby developing novel therapeutic agents and to identify
individuals at elevated risk before disease onset, aiming to
expedite early diagnosis (28). A polygenic theory of schizophrenia

 was first hypothesized in 1967 (29) based on epidemiologic
evidence of family studies that illustrated familiar clustering of
the disease and concordance rates consistent with a multifactorial
model rather than single gene causation, agreeing with the
findings from PGC GWAs. Our study successfully replicates
PRS prediction of case-control status in a typical clinical sample
of European patients admitted with FEP to psychiatric services in
South London but also examines the potential clinical utility of
PRS within FEP.
At present, the discriminative accuracy of PRS for schizo-
phrenia is not sufficient for use in population screening to
identify individuals at high risk of the disease, and, indeed,
PRS may never be powerful enough for screening (2,30).
However, PRS explains a substantial amount of the variance
of schizophrenia in Europeans, probably more than any tradi-
tional risk factor. In our samples, the OR for psychosis of the
high- versus the low-exposure group is higher for PRS (OR =
7.7) than those reported for bullying victimization (OR = 2.36),
vitamin D deficiency (OR = 3), and daily high-potency canna-
bis use (OR = 5.4) and is similar to social disadvantage 1 year
before disease onset (OR = 9.85) (31–34). Given its strength
but the lack of power for screening, the question arises as to
what is the potential clinical utility PRS?
FEP provides an opportunity to test PRS against clinical
outcomes beyond case status. In our sample, only 57% of
FEP case subjects obtained a diagnosis of schizophrenia,
while the remainder had bipolar disorder, psychotic depres-
sion, or acute or unspecified psychotic disorder. We found
significant discrimination between schizophrenia and other
psychoses within our FEP case subjects of European descent
(9.2% of variance explained). Previous studies of the schizo-
phrenia PGC1 PRS found it to be higher in patients with a
broad spectrum of psychotic disorders versus control subjects
(35,36), but discrimination between schizophrenia and other
psychotic
disorders
was
not
or
marginally
significant.
The improvement of discriminative accuracy seen in our
sample is explained by the increased predictive power of
PRS constructed from the newer PGC2 dataset. This supports
the utility of further increasing the global schizophrenia sample
size with genome-wide genotyping.
Note that the discriminative accuracy of PRS was higher for
schizophrenia case subjects in our FEP cohort than for our
group of (older) case subjects with chronic schizophrenia,
identified from a clinical trial cohort. We cannot draw definite
conclusions because the sample sizes are small; however, this
finding is not unexpected. Patients with an average of 16 years
of psychotic illness who maintain capacity to consent and
participate in an intervention study are most probably not at
the extreme end of the continuum in terms of illness severity.
Furthermore, this observation supports the utility of PRS in
early stages of the disease, because this design may be better
at including patients with potentially more severe illness
progression. Moreover, when we stratified chronic case sub-
jects by diagnosis, we observed that, in the chronic group,
PRS did not discriminate other (nonschizophrenia) psychoses
from control subjects. It may be that if someone has main-
tained a nonschizophrenic psychotic disorder for 16 years, he
or she is highly unlikely to develop schizophrenia later.
However, these observations of PRS prediction in chronic
versus FEP case subjects will require replication in independ-
ent samples.
Ethnic Differences
One of our striking findings was the substantial difference in
PRS discrimination of case-control status between individ-
uals from European and African ancestry. It is remarkable
that PRS explains as much as 9.4% of the variance in
Europeans, while it has low discriminative ability in Africans
(1.1% of the variance explained in the joint analysis of GAP
sample with SLESS control subjects). The PGC2 discovery
data included 49 European, 3 Asian, and no African ancestry
samples (2), while it is well established that Africans have
higher genetic diversity and consequently shorter LD blocks
(37), which is particularly relevant because most associated

 SNPs are genetic markers in LD with the unrecognized causal
variants (38).
Other causes for this difference should be considered. It is
already suggested that schizophrenia is a constellation of
different disorders (39,40). There is always the possibility that
different genetic and biological pathways are involved. How-
ever, previous work shows that many schizophrenia risk alleles
are shared across ethnic groups, predating African-European
divergence (41,42). Another possibility is that there is a different
environmental burden to the disease, especially because most
African individuals are first- or second-generation migrants, a
well-established environmental risk factor (43); hence, this
group may have a lower genetic risk threshold for the develop-
ment of the illness. One more important consideration is a
different level of misdiagnosis between different ethnic groups.
Strong evidence that individuals of African and African Car-
ibbean origin have fourfold to sevenfold increase in the risk of
psychosis in South London (44) may suggest that mild forms of
psychosis are more readily identified in this group (45). All of
these factors may confer lower discriminative power.
Limitations
The predictive ability of PRS depends, among other factors, on
the number of markers in the genotyping panel (7), which
affects the accuracy of the simulated SNP calls. The array we
used provided an efficient genome-wide coverage for our
European sample but not for the Africans as discussed
previously, and genotyping with denser arrays may be neces-
sary to measure the predictive power of PRS in non-European
populations. Although our study was sufficient to analyze
European and Africans, we did not have enough samples for
separate analysis of the other ethnic groups, especially because
we expected lower prediction of PRS, and insufficient evidence
exists at present for combined analyses across ethnicities (46).
In our total sample, PRS explained only 3.6% of the variance in
case-control status prediction, capturing most probably the
genetic signal mainly from the Europeans.
Conclusions
The continuing effort to increase the global sample size has
resulted in the discriminative ability of the PRS improving and,
as we have shown, the predictive power is sufficient to detect
genetic signal in moderate-to-small samples. Genotyping of
large samples from different ethnic groups would be important
to be able to generalize the findings to non-European pop-
ulations. Ideally, this should include samples collected at the
country of origin, to avoid potential confounders, such as
migration and other socioeconomic differences that may affect
case-control status (43).
To explore the clinical importance of the association of PRS
with psychosis and to better understand the biology of the
genetic predisposition to psychosis by common variants,
further research in the field should go beyond the association
with case-control status. A nonexclusive list of important
research questions include the association of PRS with 1)
severity or course of illness, 2) conversion of individuals with
prodromal symptoms to psychosis, 3) response to treatment,
4) endophenotypes and symptom profiles, and 5) physical
health and quality of life.
