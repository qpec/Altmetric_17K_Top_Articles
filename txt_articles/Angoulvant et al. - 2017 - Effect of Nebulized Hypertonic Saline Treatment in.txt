IMPORTANCE Acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants.
Previous studies, underpowered to examine hospital admission, have found a limited benefit
of nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) treatment in the pediatric emergency department (ED).
OBJECTIVE To examine whether HS nebulization treatment would decrease the hospital
admission rate among infants with a first episode of acute bronchiolitis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Efficacy of 3% Hypertonic Saline in Acute Viral
Bronchiolitis (GUERANDE) study was a multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial on
2 parallel groups conducted during 2 bronchiolitis seasons (October through March) from
October 15, 2012, through April 15, 2014, at 24 French pediatric EDs. Among the 2445 infants
(6 weeks to 12 months of age) assessed for inclusion, 777 with a first episode of acute
bronchiolitis with respiratory distress and no chronic medical condition were included.
INTERVENTIONS Two 20-minute nebulization treatments of 4 mL of HS, 3%, or 4 mL of
normal saline (NS), 0.9%, given 20 minutes apart.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospital admission rate in the 24 hours after enrollment.
RESULTS Of the 777 infants included in the study (median age, 3 months; interquartile range,
2-5 months; 468 [60.2%] male), 385 (49.5%) were randomized to the HS group and 387
(49.8%) to the NS group (5 patients did not receive treatment). By 24 hours, 185 of 385
infants (48.1%) in the HS group were admitted compared with 202 of 387 infants (52.2%) in
the NS group. The risk difference for hospitalizations was not significant according to the
mixed-effects regression model (adjusted risk difference, –3.2%; 95% CI, –8.7% to 2.2%;
P = .25). The mean (SD) Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score improvement was
greater in the HS group (–3.1 [3.2]) than in the NS group (–2.4 [3.3]) (adjusted difference, –0.7;
95% CI, –1.2 to –0.2; P = .006) and similarly for the Respiratory Assessment Change Score.
Mild adverse events, such as worsening of cough, occurred more frequently among children
in the HS group (35 of 392 [8.9%]) than among those in the NS group (15 of 384 [3.9%]) (risk
difference, 5.0%; 95% CI, 1.6%-8.4%; P = .005), with no serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Nebulized HS treatment did not significantly reduce the rate
of hospital admissions among infants with a first episode of acute moderate to severe
bronchiolitis who were admitted to the pediatric ED relative to NS, but mild adverse events
were more frequent in the HS group.

 T
heburdenofbronchiolitishasremainedhighforthepast
20 years. Each year, 1 in 5 infants has a respiratory in-
fection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).1 In
the United States, an estimated 280 000 visits to emergency
departments (EDs) for bronchiolitis occur annually.2,3 Each
year, 150 000 infants are hospitalized, with an estimated cost
of more than $1.7 billion in 2009.4,5 Bronchiolitis is the first
cause of hospitalization among infants younger than 1 year.5
As stated by the American Academy of Pediatrics in
2014, treatment is mostly supportive, such as oxygen
supplementation and hydration, because most drugs and
curative therapies, such as antibiotics, have proved to be
ineffective.6-9 Nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) treatment
has been proposed for bronchiolitis to reduce the length of
hospital stay, with mostly mild adverse events reported.10,11
The debate concerning the mechanism of action of nebu-
lized HS for bronchiolitis continues, but it is supposed to
reduce airway edema, decrease mucous plugging, and
improve clearance of mucus.12 However, the latest analyses
have cast doubt over the true efficacy of HS treatment for
admitted infants to reduce the length of hospital stay.13,14
Thus, efficacy of HS treatment in the ED to reduce the num-
ber of hospital admissions also remains unclear.10 Analysis
of 7 randomized clinical trials comprising a total of 951
infants with a first episode of bronchiolitis admitted in the
pediatric ED suggested that nebulized HS treatment reduced
the risk of hospitalization by 20% (pooled relative risk, 0.80;
95% CI, 0.67-0.96; P = .01) relative to normal saline (NS)
treatment, with evidence of moderate quality.10 Only one
study,15 which included 408 infants in 2 Californian pediat-
ric EDs, found a statistically significant reduction in admis-
sion rates (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.86;
P = .01) with the use of albuterol plus HS vs albuterol plus
NS. However, no follow-up was performed in this study to
verify the evolution of the patients discharged from the ED.15
We conducted a large multicenter trial (Efficacy of 3%
Hypertonic Saline in Acute Viral Bronchiolitis [GUERANDE])
to evaluate the efficacy of nebulized HS relative to NS on the
admission rate among previously healthy infants visiting a
pediatric ED for a first episode of moderate to severe acute
bronchiolitis to address the limitation of previous studies
(lack of follow-up, uncertainty of results, and small number
of included patients) and the risk of potential adverse events
with nebulized HS treatment, such as bronchospasm and
desaturation.10,16
Methods
Trial Design
GUERANDE was a multicenter, double-blind randomized clini-
cal trial conducted in 24 French pediatric EDs during 2 bron-
chiolitis seasons (October through March) from October 15,
2012, through April 15, 2014. Patients were randomized into
2 parallel groups to receive 3% HS or 0.9% NS nebulization
treatment. The full study protocol, including trial sites, can be
foundinSupplement1.TheSaintGermainenLayeEthicsCom-
mittee approved the study.
Participants
Infants 6 weeks to 12 months old who were seen at participat-
ingpediatricEDswithafirstepisodeofmoderatetoseverebron-
chiolitis were eligible for the study.17 Bronchiolitis was diag-
nosedbyahistoryofviralupperrespiratorytractinfectionplus
wheezing and/or crackles on chest auscultation with respira-
tory distress. Respiratory distress was diagnosed if at least 2 of
the following conditions were met: (1) altered general condi-
tionand/orreducedalimentaryintake,(2)respiratoryrategreater
than 50/min, (3) oxygen saturation less than 95% while awake,
and (4) at least 1 severe or 2 moderate retraction signs accord-
ing to the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI)
score(seeSupplement1formoredetailsabouttheRDAIscore).18
Infants were not eligible if they had any of the following: pre-
maturebirth(definedasbirthbefore37weeksofgestation);im-
munologic, cardiac, or chronic pulmonary disease; bone mal-
formationofthechest;previoususeofnebulizedHS;orinability
to communicate with the family (a language barrier or lack of
telephoneonthepartoftheparentorguardian).Criticallyillin-
fants defined by the need of admission to a pediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) were also not eligible.
Potential participants were identified and screened at ad-
mission by trained study physicians present in the pediatric
ED. Children were enrolled in the study if attending person-
nel (research nurse and physician) were available (40 hours
per week, mostly between 8 AM and 8 PM Monday through
Friday) in the pediatric ED. After written informed consent was
obtained from a parent or legal guardian, children underwent
randomization and the assigned study medication was ad-
ministered. The baseline characteristics of the children were
obtained at admission and were recorded on a patient case re-
port form. The assessment included a physician-guided struc-
tured interview of one or both parents.
Interventions
Patientsreceived2nebulizationsaccordingtotheirrandomiza-
tiongroup:4mLofHS,3%(MucoClear3%;PARIPharmaGmbH),
or 4 mL of NS, 0.9% (sodium chloride, 0.9%; Unither Pharma-

Key Points
Question What is the effect of treatment with nebulized
hypertonic saline, 3%, vs normal saline, 0.9%, on the admission
rate among infants with acute moderate to severe bronchiolitis in
the emergency department?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 777 healthy infants,
the hospital admission rate in the hypertonic saline group was
48.1% compared with 52.2% in the normal saline group. Mild
adverse events, such as worsening of cough, occurred more
frequently among children in the hypertonic saline group.
Meaning Nebulized hypertonic saline treatment did not
significantly reduce the hospital admission rate among infants with
a first episode of acute bronchiolitis admitted to the pediatric
emergency department.

withroutinecareatthediscretionofthetreatingphysician.Ana-
sopharyngeal aspiration sample was obtained for viral testing
using polymerase chain reaction. In case of hospitalization, the
study did not plan to pursue further nebulizations.
Assessment
Study physicians and research nurses performed respiratory
scoring at baseline, between the 2 nebulizations, and after 20
minutes. Any adverse effects were recorded throughout the
observation period in the pediatric ED. All patients received
assessments by a study physician 20 minutes after the end of
the second nebulization. The decision to admit or discharge
the infant from the pediatric ED was made at the discretion of
the attending physician. The research nurse obtained data re-
garding hospital admissions and infant’
s feeding, breathing,
and coughing 3, 8, 15, and 28 days after the ED visit by using a
standardized telephone follow-up procedure.
Outcome Measures
The primary end point of the study was hospital admission up

vestigators. Interrater reliability was not tested.
Randomization
A random allocation sequence using a 1:1 ratio and permuta-
tion blocks with a block size of 4, stratified according to cen-
ter, was computer generated. Randomization was performed
electronically using a secure internet platform (https:
//cleanweb.aphp.fr). Block size was not mentioned to the
physiciansinvolvedinpatientrecruitment.Theinvestigational
pharmacy prepared the study drugs in sequentially numbered,
visually identical packets to conceal the allocation sequence.
All pediatric department staff, parents, and guardians were
masked to the treatment assignment. Randomization codes
were kept secure until data entry was complete. Thus, those
involved in the evaluation of the primary outcome were
masked to the group assignment.
Statistical Analysis
We determined the sample size using the hospitalization rates
for bronchiolitis recorded in study hospitals during previous
years. We estimated that a total of 349 infants per group would

α of .05 and a (1 − β) of .80, for a comparison of 2 independent
proportions if there was an absolute decrease in the hospital-
ization rate of 10%. We planned to include an additional 15% of
patients to ensure that we had sufficient participants for analy-
sis (because of potential study dropouts or consent withdraw-
als). We therefore planned to enroll 800 infants in this trial.
Our primary analysis was conducted using an intent-to-
treat approach and therefore included all randomized infants.
Baseline characteristics of patients in the 2 treatment groups

tistics, including measures of central tendency and disper-

ference between treatment groups was estimated using odds
ratios and risk differences with 95% CIs. We performed mixed-
effects model analyses to account for the correlation among
measurements in the same center.20 Every model was ad-
justedforpotentialclinicalrelevantcovariates,suchasage,RSV
infection status, duration of symptoms before enrollment, pre-
vious use of systemic corticosteroids, feeding, heart rate, oxy-
gen saturation, and initial RDAI score. A per-protocol analysis
using a linear regression model was used to compare adverse
events between the HS and NS groups. All analyses were con-
ducted using Stata software, version 13.1 (StataCorp). P values
were calculated using multieffect or linear regression models,
and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics
Of the 2445 infants who met the criteria for enrollment, 778
were enrolled (Figure). One family withdrew their consent be-
fore randomization. Of the 777 infants included in the study
(median age, 3 months; interquartile range, 2-5 months; 468
[60.2%] male), 385 (49.5%) were randomized to the HS group
and 387 (49.8%) to the NS group (Table 1). Of the 390 infants
assigned to the NS group, 1 patient in the NS group was admit-
ted to the PICU before administration of the study drug; 5 re-
ceived HS rather than the allocated treatment. In these 5 pa-
tients, because of a human error, the patients did not receive
the treatment contained in the packet corresponding to their
randomization numbers but received the treatment of a packet
corresponding to another randomization number. Five in-
fants were unavailable for follow-up after discharge from the
pediatric ED before day 3 (2 in the HS group and 3 in the NS
group). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were
similar in both groups (Table 1). The prevalence of RSV infec-
tion was high in both groups (84% in the HS group and 88% in
the NS group). Patients in both groups had received prior treat-
ment with bronchodilators (78 [20.3%] in the HS group and 71
[18.4%] in the NS group) and systemic corticosteroids (75
[19.5%] in the HS group and 43 [11.1%] in the NS group) for the
same episode in the previous days.
Hospital Admissions
We found no significant difference between the study groups
with respect to hospitalization. By 24 hours, 185 of the 385 in-
fants (48.1%) in the HS group were admitted compared with

 202 of the 387 infants (52.2%) in the NS group. The difference
in hospitalization rates between the HS and NS groups was not
significant according to the mixed-effects regression model
using the center as the random effect (risk difference, –3.2%;
95% CI, –8.7% to 2.2%; P = .25) (Table 2 and Table 3).
Secondary Outcomes
Subgroup analyses comparing the admission rates among in-
fants younger than 3 months revealed no significant differ-
ence between the HS and NS groups. with admission rates of
54.8% (121 of 221 infants) in the HS group and 57.4% (132 of 230
infants) in the NS group (P = .58). The mean (SD) length of stay
foralladmittedinfantswas3.7 (2.7)days,withnodifferencebe-
tween groups: 3.8 (2.5) days for the HS group and 3.7 (3.0) days
for the NS group (adjusted difference, –0.1; 95% CI, –0.6 to 0.4;
P = .71).Byday28,209ofthe378infants(55.3%)intheHSgroup

mittedtothehospital.Amonghospitalizedinfants,28weread-

Admission rates varied among the 24 centers from 31.6% to
83.3% (mean [SD], 53.0% [15.0%]). Additional therapies re-
ceived by the children during their stay in the pediatric ED are
described in the eTable in Supplement 2.
Clinical Measures
The RDAI score improved in both groups (Table 2), with a
greater mean (SD) change in the HS group of –3.1 (3.2) com-
pared with –2.4 (3.3) in the NS group (adjusted difference, –0.7;
95% CI, –1.2 to –0.2; P = .006), and similarly for the Respira-
tory Assessment Change Score (RACS) (Table 2).
Adverse Events
Although no serious adverse events were reported, mild ad-
verse events were more frequent in the HS group. Adverse
events occurred 57 times among 50 infants: in 35 of 392 chil-
dren (8.9%) in the HS group vs 15 of 384 (3.9%) in the NS group
(risk difference, 5.0%; 95% CI, 1.6%-8.4%; P = .005) (Table 4).
One adverse event occurred in an infant randomized to the NS
group who was admitted to the PICU before administration of
the study medication (Table 4). Cough without respiratory dis-
tress was the most frequent adverse event observed and oc-
curred 30 times among 26 children in the HS group and 4 times
among 3 children in the NS group.
Discussion
Our multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial of 777
infants with moderate to severe acute bronchiolitis in the pe-
diatric ED found no significant difference in hospital admis-
sion rates after 24 hours whether the infants received nebu-

 lized HS or NS (risk difference, –3.2%; 95% CI, –8.7% to 2.2%;
P = .25). We also did not find any difference between the HS
and NS groups for PICU admission, admission by day 28, or ad-
mission among infants younger than 3 months. To our knowl-
edge, this randomized clinical trial is the largest to evaluate
the efficacy of nebulized HS treatment in pediatric ED outpa-
tient management of bronchiolitis. Our results contrast those
fromarecentmeta-analysis10thatincluded7studies15,17,19,21-24
and 951 infants in outpatient settings that found a moderate
benefit with the HS treatment on admission rates (relative risk,
0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.96; P = .01).
Our study of 2 saline nebulizations was sufficiently pow-
ered to allow the detection of a 10% decrease in the hospital-
ization rate. Because the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ad-
justed risk difference in the mixed-effects regression model
was −8.7%, our study rules out the possibility that HS treat-
ment can reduce hospitalizations by at least 10 percentage
points.
We found only mild adverse events and no serious ad-
verse events, in agreement with a meta-analysis10 of 24 pre-
vious trials of a total of 1557 infants receiving nebulized HS
treatment. However, infants in the HS group experienced ad-
verseeventssignificantlymoreoftenthanthoseintheNSgroup
(8.9% vs 3.9%; risk difference, 5.0%; 95% CI, 1.6%-8.4%;
P = .005). Because of the low benefit of HS nebulization and
the higher risk of adverse events, our results strongly argue
against the use of HS treatment for infants with a first epi-
sode of bronchiolitis in pediatric EDs.
In our study, the mean length of stay of admitted infants
was 3.7 days, which is similar to the 3.6 days described in a re-
centreview,13anddidnotdifferbetweentheHSandNSgroups.
Likewise, hospitalization between hour 24 and day 28 ap-
plies to only 24 children in each group, indicating that we in-
cluded infants with typical acute bronchiolitis. The 24 partici-
pating centers were spread throughout the country, allowing
a nationally representative patient cohort. The overall hospi-
talization rate was 50%, which appears to be representative of
infants with acute bronchiolitis in pediatric EDs because in-
fants with milder forms with no respiratory distress were not
eligible. Previous studies21,23,24 performed in pediatric EDs
were heterogeneous; some studies15,19 included infants with
a milder form of bronchiolitis, whereas other studies, such as
the study by Florin et al22 and our study, included infants with
moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The hospitalization rates in
these 3 studies15,19,22 varied from 36% to 68%, whereas hos-
pitalization rates varied among centers from 31.6% to 83.3%

a Data are presented as number/total number (percentage) of patients unless
otherwise indicated.
bDifferences with 95% CIs were calculated using linear mixed-effects
regression models accounting for the random effect for the center. Every
model was adjusted for potential clinical relevant covariates, such as age,
respiratory syncytial virus infection status, duration of symptoms before
enrollment, previous use of systemic corticosteroids, feeding, heart rate,
oxygen saturation, and initial RDAI score. P < .001 of the likelihood ratio test
comparing the linear mixed-effects regression model with an ordinary linear
regression model in all cases, which is highly significant, meaning ordinary
regression was to be rejected.
c Denominators were calculated by adding patients with complete follow-up
and patients with a known hospitalization before being unavailable for
follow-up.
dn = 185 in the hypertonic saline group; n = 202 in the normal saline group.
e Risk differences adjusted for age, respiratory syncytial virus infection status,
duration of symptoms before enrollment, previous use of systemic
corticosteroids, feeding, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and initial RDAI score.
f n = 379 in the hypertonic saline group; n = 378 in the normal saline group.
g n = 379 in the hypertonic saline group; n = 375 in the normal saline group.
h n = 377 in the hypertonic saline group; n = 374 in the normal saline group. The
RACS was calculated by adding changes in RDAI score before and after
treatment plus a point for each 10% change in respiratory rate above 5% (eg,
−1 for a decrease of 6%-15% and −2 for a decrease of 16%-25%; negative
values signify improvement).18

 the SD of the center random effect is almost as large as the as-
sociation between young age and admission.
Although our study failed to find any significant differ-
ence in hospital admission rate between the HS and NS groups,
we found a greater improvement in the RDAI score and RACS
in the HS group. This finding suggests that HS treatment can
help to alleviate symptoms in the short term, even though it
does not prevent hospitalization. As reported previously, an
association between RDAI score and hospital admission seems
to exist but at a moderate magnitude.25 In fact, the study by
Wu et al15 found inverse results, with a decrease in hospital ad-
missions in the HS group compared with the NS group but no
difference in the decrease of RDAI score and RACS between the
HS and NS groups.
Limitations
The study has some limitations. Infants with the most severe
form of acute bronchitis who required direct PICU admission
and patients with milder forms of acute bronchiolitis were not
eligible. We cannot exclude that nebulized HS could have effi-
cacy in these populations. Similarly, our results cannot be ex-
trapolated to preterm infants. The use of thresholds for respi-
ratory rate and oxygen saturation to define respiratory distress
asaninclusioncriterionisalimitationbecausethesefactorsvary
across conditions.25 Normal saline treatment is a control inter-
ventionandnotaplaceboandthusmayhavehadaneffect,such
as on the RDAI score. However, the use of NS allowed the trial
tobedouble-blind.12Attendingpersonnel,researchnurses,and

which could have limited the representativeness of our popu-
lation. We performed 2 nebulizations in the pediatric ED and

and has not been included in our models, although it may have
an important effect on the decision to admit a patient.
We used a 3% concentration of HS, which is the most com-
monly studied, but the HS concentration was higher in a few
studies,10,19 up to 7%. We used HS and NS alone, whereas a
meta-analysis10 found that most previous studies used a study
medication that combined saline solution with a bronchodi-
lator,suchasepinephrine,albuterol,orterbutaline.Thetheory
behind the additional use of a bronchodilator with HS was to
preventbronchospasmratherthantoimproveefficacy.16There
was no evidence of benefit for any of these mixed solutions
vs HS solution alone for efficacy or safety.10,16
As for most of previous studies, we included only infants
with a first episode of bronchiolitis; infants with recurrent
wheezing were not included.10 The high percentage of RSV
(86%) is another factor that indicates that we recruited in-
fants with typical acute bronchiolitis.
Conclusions
Although short-term improvements in the RDAI score and
RACSweregreaterintheHSgroup,overalladmissionrateswere
not improved. Our study failed to demonstrate superiority of
nebulized HS treatment compared with NS treatment in re-
ducing the hospitalization rate of infants with acute bronchi-
olitis in the pediatric ED. Although no serious adverse events
occurred, mild adverse events were more frequently experi-
enced by infants in the HS group. The use of HS treatment for
infants with a first episode of acute bronchiolitis in the pedi-
atric ED cannot be recommended.
