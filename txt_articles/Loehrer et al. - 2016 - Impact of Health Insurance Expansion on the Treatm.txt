Purpose
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in
the United States. Lack of insurance coverage has been associated with more advanced disease at
presentation, more emergent admissions at time of colectomy, and lower survival relative to pri-
vately insured patients. The 2006 Massachusetts health care reform serves as a unique natural
experiment to assess the impact of insurance expansion on colorectal cancer care.
Methods
We used the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases to identify patients with
colorectal cancer with government-subsidized or self-pay (GSSP) or private insurance admitted to
a hospital between 2001 and 2011 in Massachusetts (n = 17,499) and three control states (n =
144,253). Difference-in-differences models assessed the impact of the 2006 Massachusetts coverage
expansion on resection of colorectal cancer, controlling for confounding factors and secular trends.
Results
Before the 2006 Massachusetts reform, government-subsidized or self-pay patients had signifi-
cantly lower rates of resection for colorectal cancer compared with privately insured patients in both
Massachusetts and the control states. The Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated
with a 44% increased rate of resection (rate ratio = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.68; P , .001), a 6.21
percentage point decreased probability of emergent admission (95% CI, 211.88 to 20.54; P = .032),
and an 8.13 percentage point increased probability of an elective admission (95% CI, 1.34 to 14.91;
P = .019) compared with the control states.
Conclusion
The 2006 Massachusetts health care reform, a model for the Affordable Care Act, was associated
with increased rates of resection and decreased probability of emergent resection for colorectal
cancer. Our findings suggest that insurance expansion may help improve access to care for patients
with colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer is the third most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer
deaths in the United States. Although earlier
diagnosis and newer therapies have increased
overall survival, disparities in access to and out-
comes of care for colorectal cancer persist.1 Lack
of insurance and other socioeconomic factors
have been associated with lower rates of screening
for colorectal cancer.2-5 Such social determinants
are also associated with more advanced-stage
cancer at time of diagnosis, greater likelihood
of undergoing emergent resection, and lower
survival relative to privately insured patients.6-9
Despite extensive evidence of disparities
by insurance status, considerable debate remains
regarding the drivers of and solutions to these
differences. Colorectal cancer outcomes have
been shown to vary by hospital, socioeconomic
status of patients, and individual patient pref-
erences or comorbidities.10-14 Disentangling the
effect of these factors related to access and use of
care for colorectal cancer has been challenging,
given the considerable overlap among patient
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and insurance
status.
The 2006 Massachusetts health reform
provides a unique natural experiment to evaluate
the impact of insurance expansion on access to
and receipt of colorectal cancer treatment. The

 Massachusetts law, a model for the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
expanded Medicaid coverage for those living below 150% of the
federal poverty limit, created a state-subsidized insurance program
(Commonwealth Care) for individuals whose income is less than
300% of the federal poverty limit but who remained ineligible for
Medicaid, and established an individual mandate that required
Massachusetts residents to carry health insurance. As a result, the
uninsured rate fell to below 5%, with the majority of newly insured
residents enrolled in either Medicaid or Commonwealth Care
(Appendix Fig A1; online only).15-18 However, little is known about
how this insurance expansion affected disparities in colorectal cancer.19
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate overall trends in
colorectal cancer treatment after the 2006 Massachusetts health
care reform. We hypothesized that the 2006 insurance expansion
was associated with increased rates of colorectal cancer resection in
the population most directly affected by the reform. A secondary
hypothesis was that corresponding disparities by insurance status
also decreased after the 2006 health care reform.
METHODS
Study Design and Data
We performed a cohort study using the Hospital Cost and Utilization
Project State Inpatient Databases (SIDs) in Massachusetts, New York, New
Jersey, and Florida from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2011. The
SIDs capture administrative data from approximately 98% of all discharges
in respective states each year. Data are collected and maintained in
partnership with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Our
control states were selected on the basis of completeness and congruence of
available covariates in the control states and Massachusetts as well as on the
basis of a similar availability of surgical services, with comparable rates of
colectomy within the respective states’ Medicare populations at the time of
the Massachusetts law.20
The study included all inpatient admissions of adult patients between
the ages of 18 and 65 years with colorectal cancer who were uninsured or
self-pay, or were covered by employee- or individually purchased private
insurance coverage, Medicaid, or Commonwealth Care (only in Massa-
chusetts after reform; Fig 1). Colorectal cancer diagnosis was determined
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) di-
agnosis codes (ICD-9-Clinical Modification [CM] 153, 154, 153.0 to 154.8).
Insurance coverage was classified as being government subsidized or self-
pay (GSSP) if the primary payer was Medicaid, self-pay, no charge, or
Commonwealth Care. This cohort represents the primary group of in-
dividuals who were affected by insurance expansion in Massachusetts or
who would have been affected with similar reforms in the control states.21
Patients with Medicare and those younger than 18 years or older than
64 years were excluded from analyses because they were not affected
directly by the Massachusetts reform.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of this study was surgical resection of co-
lorectal cancer. Resection was defined using ICD-9 procedure codes
(ICD-9-CM 173.1 to 173.9, 457.1 to 458.3, and 485.0 to 486.9). Secondary
outcomes included the probability of emergent or elective admissions as
defined using available variables in the SID.
Statistical Analysis
Difference-in-differences analyses were conducted to evaluate for
changes in outcomes associated with the 2006 Massachusetts health re-
form.22-24 Indicator variables were created for intervention group (Mas-
sachusetts v control states), insurance status (GSSP v private insurance),
and postreform. Prereform was defined as any discharge between the first
quarter of 2001 and the second quarter of 2006. The postreform period was
defined as any discharge between the first quarter of 2008 and the fourth
quarter of 2011. Patients discharged between the second quarter of 2006
and the first quarter of 2008 were excluded because this was a period
spanning the passage of the law and its full implementation. Previous
studies showed that a significant portion of newly insured individuals
gained insurance after enactment of the individual mandate in 2008.25
To evaluate for changes in treatment by insurance status, patients were
stratified between GSSP and private insurance coverage. Difference-in-
differences models included an interaction term between Massachusetts and the
postreform period. The subsequent coefficient (the difference-in-differences

 estimator) represents the change in the outcomes associated with the 2006
intervention for GSSP patients.
We used Poisson regression models to evaluate resections as count
data in this cohort study. Incident rate ratios (IRRs) were determined using
the total population of adults 18 to 64 years of age with given insurance
coverage in the respective cohorts. These population estimates were
gathered using available resources from the US Census Bureau.26 The
coefficient of these difference-in-differences Poisson models can be
interpreted as the relative change in resection rates associated with the
Massachusetts coverage expansion.
Ordinary least-squares regression models were used to evaluate for
change in the probability of emergent or elective admission at the time of
colorectal resection. The output of these difference-in-differences models
represents the percentage point change in the probability of emergent or
elective admissions independently associated with coverage expansion.
Logistic regression models were used to determine disparities in the odds
of resection before and after expansion in Massachusetts and the control
states.
Risk Adjustment
Multivariable models examining changes in resection rates and rates
of emergent admissions at the time of colon or rectal resection controlled
for patient age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities using the Elixhauser
comorbidity index.27 We also adjusted for hospital type and secular trends.
Hospital types were defined using available SIDs variables and included
investor-owned hospitals with all bed sizes, not-for-profit rural hospitals
with all bed sizes, not-for-profit urban hospitals with , 300 beds, and not-
for-profit urban hospitals with $ 300 beds. Standard errors were clustered
at the hospital level using STATA’s cluster-correlated robust estimate of
variance option (STATA, College Station, TX).28 Secular trends were
defined on a quarterly basis using a continuous variable starting at the first
quarter of 2001 and ending with the fourth quarter of 2011. In evaluating
disparities in the odds of resection during admission, we also adjusted for
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis (ICD-9 196.0 to198.7, 198.82,
198.89).
Sensitivity Analyses
To confirm parallel trends in measures before reform, we conducted
a separate analysis including only admission before reform. Sensitivity
analyses were performed using a model with a triple interaction variable
between Massachusetts, GSSP coverage, and postreform, which included
the entire sample. We also evaluated identical models including admissions
between the second quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2008. Ad-
ditional sensitivity analyses were performed that stratified the patients by
the presence of isolated liver metastasis, all other metastasis, or non-
metastatic disease.
The study was deemed exempt from institutional review board re-
view. Data were analyzed using STATA software, version 14 (STATA,
College Station, TX). Results were considered significant if P , .05.
RESULTS
Our primary cohort consisted of 161,752 admissions, 17,499 from
Massachusetts and 144,253 from the control states (Table 1).
Patients in Massachusetts were more likely to be white, to have
private insurance coverage, and to be admitted to a not-for-profit,
urban hospital with , 300 beds. Massachusetts had a slightly
higher percentage of patients with rectal cancer and a lower
likelihood of presentation with metastatic disease. Patients in
Massachusetts were also less likely to have an emergent admission
at the time of colorectal resection. Patient age, sex, and comorbidity
indices were comparable between Massachusetts and the control
states.
In examining trends in admissions for colorectal cancer, we
found the Massachusetts reform to be associated with a 15% increased
rate of admission of GSSP patients for colorectal cancer (IRR, 1.15;
95% CI, 1.14 to 1.16; P , .001), compared with the control states
(Table 2). The coverage expansion was also independently associated
with a 44% increased rate of resection (IRR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23 to
1.68; P , .001) for GSSP patients admitted with colorectal cancer,
compared with the control states. Stratifying by either colon or rectal
cancer, the 2006 coverage expansion was associated with a 49% in-
creased rate of resection for colon cancer (IRR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26 to
1.77; P , .001) and a 34% increase rate of resection for rectal cancer
(IRR, 1.34; 95% CI1.05 to 1.71; P = .021) for GSSP patients in
Massachusetts, compared with the control states.
Sensitivity analyses found that there was no differential trend
in resection rates between GSSP patients in Massachusetts and the
control states before coverage expansion (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99
to 1.02; P = .286). There was also no significant change in resection
rates for privately insured patients in Massachusetts after the 2006
reform, compared with the control states (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93
to 1.03; P = .455). The results of analyses using a triple interaction
term with the complete sample were consistent with these findings.
When stratifying by metastatic disease, we again found no sig-
nificant change in resection rates for privately insured patients in
Massachusetts with or without metastatic disease. However, the
Massachusetts reform was associated with a 37% increased re-
section rate for GSSP patients in Massachusetts without metastatic
disease at admission (IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.58; P , .001)
and a 96% increased rate of resection for patients with isolated liver
metastasis (IRR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.71; P , .001). There was
no change in resection rates for GSSP patients with metastatic
disease not in the liver.

 The Massachusetts coverage expansion was associated with
a 6.21–percentage point decreased probability (95% CI, 211.88
to 20.54; P = .032) of an emergent admission at the time of resection
and an 8.13–percentage point increased probability (95% CI, 1.34 to
14.91; P = .019) of an elective admission at the time of resection
(Table 3). Before coverage expansion, there was no differential trend
in emergent admissions or elective admissions for GSSP patients
undergoing colorectal resection in Massachusetts, compared with
the control states. There were also no significant changes in either
emergent admissions or elective admissions for privately insured
patients in Massachusetts after reform, relative to the control states.
Sensitivity analyses including all GSSP and privately insured patients
in a triple-interaction model demonstrated that GSSP patients still
had significantly reduced probability of emergent admission and
significantly increased probability of elective admission.
Before reform, GSSP patients had significantly lower odds of
undergoing resection for colorectal cancer compared with privately
insured patients in both Massachusetts (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95%
CI, 0.37 to 0.49; P , .001) and the control states (OR, 0.45; 95%
CI, 0.44 to 0.47; P , .001), controlling for patient age, sex, eth-
nicity, comorbidities, hospital type, and secular trends (Fig 2).
After reform, these disparities decreased but remained significant
in Massachusetts (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.72; P , .001).
Disparities by primary payer remained unchanged in the control
states after 2006 (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.47; P , .001).
DISCUSSION
Lack of insurance coverage has long been linked to disparities in
health and health care, including for the treatment of colorectal
cancer. Disparities in coverage were a major driving force for the
2006 Massachusetts health reform, as well as for the ACA. Our
results suggest that the Massachusetts coverage expansion was
independently associated with a 44% increased rate of resection of
colorectal cancer in the populations affected most directly by the
law. The insurance expansion was also associated with an increase
in the probability of resection being performed after an elective
admission and a decreased probability of resection occurring after
emergent admission. However, a gap in resection rates and emergent
admissions at the time of surgery persists by payer status.
Although our results are not causal, a link between the
coverage expansion and changes in the treatment received has
several potential explanations. The increased rates of surgery could
be caused by increased diagnosis of colorectal cancer at earlier
stages, when resection is a more viable option. Previous studies in
Massachusetts suggested that the 2006 health reform was associ-
ated with slight increases in rates of colonoscopy.29,30 Newly in-
sured patients may also be more willing to present to the hospital
with earlier signs or symptoms of cancer, with a decreased like-
lihood of presentation with obstructing, bleeding, or perforated
tumors. In turn, these admissions may be for earlier, more sur-
gically treatable tumors. Previous studies proposed such a hy-
pothesis in explaining similarly increased resection rates for
pancreatic cancer after the Massachusetts reform.31 Our results are
consistent with previous work showing the Massachusetts reform
to be associated with earlier presentation of other surgical di-
agnoses and increased probability of receiving optimal surgical
intervention.32-34
Dissecting disparities in care by insurance status is more
challenging, but our findings of increased odds of resection for
GSSP patients after admission is encouraging, especially given the
concurrent increased admission rate for GSSP patients in Mas-
sachusetts. Furthermore, disparities by payer status remained
unchanged in the control states. These findings in Massachusetts,
coupled with decreased emergent admissions at the time of surgery,
suggest that patients are indeed undergoing resection more fre-
quently and in the elective setting.

Health Reform and Treatment of Colorectal Cancer
 The disparity in the probability of resection by payer status was
not eliminated completely in Massachusetts and could be caused by
a variety of factors. First, we grouped all patients without insurance,
with Medicaid, or with newly created Commonwealth Care into
a single cohort, primarily to allow for comparison with a similar
cohort in the control states. Unfortunately, we were unable to
specifically identify those patients who obtained insurance after the
Massachusetts reform. Therefore, a considerable number of patients
in the Massachusetts cohort had Medicaid coverage both before and
after expansion. Inclusion of these patients persistently insured
through Medicaid in Massachusetts would have diluted any mea-
sured impact on the newly insured. Those with Medicaid before
expanded eligibility tended to be less healthy and of higher risk from
a sociodemographic standpoint than did those enrolling after ex-
pansion.35 These risk factors in those covered by Medicaid before
reform should not necessarily have been expected to change after
reform and could have contributed to the persistently lower odds of
resection compared with privately insured patients. The study also
did not address the independent influence of the individual man-
date, which was a part of both the 2006 Massachusetts law and the
ACA, on colorectal cancer care delivery.
We acknowledge several important limitations in this study.
First, our data came from administrative records that do have the
potential for coding errors. However, our analyses and results are
consistent with previous studies of colorectal cancer using Hospital
Cost and Utilization Project databases.36-38 Our analyses of ad-
mission and resection rates used population estimates from the US
Bureau of Labor Statistics that may not capture the precise pop-
ulation. However, it is unlikely that errors in estimates would
differentially occur within the GSSP cohort in Massachusetts as
compared with other populations after 2006.
The study is also limited by a lack of clinical granularity,
oncologic variables, and long-term survival data. Therefore, we
cannot adequately account for stage at time of diagnosis or receipt
of stage-appropriate treatment. We found no change in the rate
of resection for patients with diffuse and extrahepatic metastases.
Yet the increased rate of resection for patients with isolated liver
metastasis suggests that expansion may influence delivery of care
for patients with more advanced but potentially curable cancer.39
In the absence of more clinically granular data, however, we cannot
definitively exclude the possibility of inappropriate resection of
advanced-stage disease. The SIDs capture only inpatient admis-
sions and therefore, we were unable to identify patients diagnosed
with colon or rectal cancer in the outpatient setting, although if
they presented to the hospital for surgery, then those admissions
would have been captured. Additional studies using population-
level data for all new patients diagnosed with colon cancer might
provide more granular data on overall diagnosis and stage-specific
treatment. However, surgery remains the primary means of cu-
rative treatment and occurs almost exclusively within an inpatient
setting. Our results suggest that insurance expansion was associ-
ated with increased rates of resection.
As a quasi-experimental study, we also acknowledge the pos-
sibility of other ecologic changes that could have differentially af-
fected the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However,
there was no differential trend in incidence rates of colorectal cancer
between Massachusetts and the control states over the study period
(Appendix Fig A2, online only).40 Similarly, there were no differ-
ential changes in race/ethnicity (Appendix Fig A3, online only).15 To
our knowledge, there were no other broad, population-level policy
changes that occurred in Massachusetts that could account for our
findings. Given the unique aspects of health care in the state, our
findings in Massachusetts may not be generalizable elsewhere.
However, our evaluation of resection rates and admission types
before the reform showed similar trends in both Massachusetts
and the control states before implementation. Furthermore, our
inclusion of privately insured patients as a separate, intrastate control
group still demonstrated significantly increased rates of surgery and
a decreased probability of emergent resection for GSSP patients in
Massachusetts after coverage expansion. Regardless, additional study
of access to and receipt of optimal care for colorectal cancer in other
states that expand coverage through the ACAwill provide important
insights into the impact elsewhere in the country.
In this study, we show that the 2006 Massachusetts insurance
expansion was associated with a 44% increased rate of resection for
colorectal cancer and a 6.21 percentage point decreased probability
of an emergent admission at the time of colorectal resection.
Despite these improvements in care, disparities by payer persist for
colorectal resection rates and odds of emergent admission at the
time of resection. Longer-term evaluations in Massachusetts and
other states are needed to evaluate the impact of ACA-related
coverage expansions on the treatment of colorectal cancer. Overall,
