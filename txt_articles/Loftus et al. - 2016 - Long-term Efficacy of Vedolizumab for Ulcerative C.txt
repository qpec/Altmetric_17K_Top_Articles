Abstract
Background and Aims: The GEMINI long-term safety [LTS] study is a continuing phase 3 trial 
investigating the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin antagonist for ulcerative 
colitis [UC] and Crohn’s disease. We provide an interim analysis of efficacy in patients with UC.
Methods: Patients from the C13004 and GEMINI 1 studies and a cohort of vedolizumab-naïve patients 
received open-label vedolizumab every 4 weeks. Interim data were collected from May 22, 2009 to June 
27
, 2013. Clinical response and remission, evaluated using partial Mayo scores, and health-related quality 
of life [HRQL] were assessed for up to 152 weeks of cumulative treatment in the efficacy population.
Results: As of June 27
, 2013, 63% of the efficacy population [n = 532/845] were continuing treatment. 
Among patients who responded to vedolizumab induction and had data available, 88% [n = 120/136] 
were in remission after 104 weeks of exposure (96% [n = 70/73] after 152 weeks). Among patients 
who withdrew from every-8-week vedolizumab maintenance in GEMINI 1 [n = 32] before week 52, 
increased dosing to every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS resulted in response and remission rates of 41% 
and 28%, respectively, after 52 weeks, an increase from 19% and 6%, respectively, from before

 the dose increase. Similar benefits were demonstrated regardless of prior tumour necrosis factor-
antagonist exposure. Durable benefits on HRQL were also observed.
Conclusions: Patients with UC experienced clinical and HRQL improvements with continued 
vedolizumab treatment. Increased dosing frequency to every 4 weeks was beneficial in patients 
who had loss of response to 8-weekly dosing.
Key Words:  Vedolizumab; ulcerative colitis; long-term efficacy
1. Introduction
Ulcerative colitis [UC] is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of 
the large bowel that is characterized by symptoms of bloody diar-
rhoea, faecal urgency and abdominal cramps.1 Since no cure exists, 
patients with UC usually require long-term maintenance therapy. 
Conventional non-biologic therapies, such as corticosteroids, thio-
purines and methotrexate, have limited long-term efficacy and may 
cause serious adverse effects.1–5 While the introduction of tumour 
necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists has greatly improved the manage-
ment of UC, some patients do not respond or lose response to these 
agents.4 Furthermore, TNF antagonists are systemic immunosup-
pressive drugs that place patients at risk of serious infections.6,7
Vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody specifically targeting the 
α4β7 integrin heterodimer, is a new treatment for moderately to 
severely active UC.8 Distinct from TNF antagonists and thiopu-
rines, vedolizumab selectively inhibits binding of the α4β7 integ-
rin to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 [MAdCAM-1], 
which is preferentially expressed in the intestinal endothelium.9 
Blockade of the α4β7 integrin–MAdCAM-1 interaction interferes 
with migration of inflammatory cells into the gastrointestinal 
tract.10–12 Systemic immune responses are preserved after treat-
ment with vedolizumab.13
Treatment of UC with vedolizumab was demonstrated to be well-
tolerated and efficacious in the phase 3, placebo-controlled GEMINI 
1 study [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00783718].14 Herein we present 
an interim analysis of data from the continuing GEMINI long-term 
safety [LTS] extension study [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00790933], 
with emphasis on the durability of treatment response over time and 
the potential value of increasing dose frequency from every 8 weeks 
to every 4 weeks in patients with a loss of response. We also report 
efficacy outcomes in the overall population and by previous TNF 
antagonist exposure. In addition, safety data are provided.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and patient enrolment
The GEMINI LTS study, a single-arm, open-label phase 3 study in 
patients with moderately to severely active UC or Crohn’s disease, 
was underway at 292 centres internationally at the time of these 
analyses. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety 
of long-term vedolizumab treatment. Patient-reported health-related 
quality of life [HRQL] assessments and efficacy endpoints of clini-
cal response and remission were pre-specified exploratory objectives. 
This report presents interim efficacy and safety data for participants 
from May 22, 2009 to June 27, 2013.
This study was designed and implemented by the GEMINI 
Steering Committee [Supplementary Material] in collaboration 
with the sponsor [Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., d/b/a Takeda 
Development Center Americas, Inc.]. The study protocol was 
reviewed and approved by the institutional review board[s] and/or 
independent ethics committee[s] at each participating investigational 
centre. GEMINI LTS is being conducted compliant with good clini-
cal practice and applicable regulatory requirements and according 
to the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki.15 All 
patients gave written informed consent.
The study enrolled patients from qualifying lead-in stud-
ies, which included the long-term phase 2 C13004 study 
[ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00619489]16 and the phase 3 GEMINI 
1 study [ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00783718].14 The remainder 
of the enrolled UC population consisted of a new cohort of ved-
olizumab-naïve patients [Supplementary Figure 1]. As of June 27, 
2013, the maximum duration of exposure for patients from the 
vedolizumab-naïve cohort was 399 days [57 weeks]. In contrast, 
patients who entered the study from GEMINI 1 had a maximum 
duration of exposure of up to 1622 days [232 weeks]. Interim 
data for up to 100 weeks of vedolizumab treatment in GEMINI 
LTS are reported here with the potential for approximately 3 years 
[152 weeks] of total exposure for patients who completed the 
52-week GEMINI 1 study.
Patients were withdrawn from the study and considered a treat-
ment failure if they required rescue medication or major surgical 
intervention for the treatment of UC; if they had a study drug-related 
adverse event that led to discontinuation; if, in the opinion of the 
investigator or patient, they were not benefiting from therapy; or if 
they became pregnant. Investigators were strongly advised to with-
draw patients who required multiple courses of corticosteroids or 
those who were corticosteroid-dependent.
2.1.1. GEMINI 1 patients
GEMINI 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to 
explore the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab induction and main-
tenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active UC 
[Supplementary Figure 1]. Study details of GEMINI 1 have been 
published elsewhere.14 Briefly, patients received either vedolizumab 
or placebo at weeks 0 and 2 during the induction phase, and those 
who responded to vedolizumab at week 6 were randomized to receive 
placebo or vedolizumab every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks (the main-
tenance intent-to-treat [ITT] population) during the maintenance 
phase. Clinical response in GEMINI 1 was defined as a decrease in 
total Mayo Clinic score of ≥3 points and a ≥30% decrease from the 
baseline score along with a decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore 
of ≥1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1. Patients 
who did not respond at week 6 could continue to receive vedoli-
zumab every-4-week maintenance treatment in the non-ITT arm 
[Supplementary Figure 1].14 Patients originally assigned to placebo 
induction continued to receive placebo during maintenance or with-
drew from the study. Patients who either completed the maintenance 
phase or withdrew early because of sustained non-response, disease 
worsening or the need for rescue medication [Supplementary Table 1] 
and for whom, in the opinion of the investigator, the study drug was 
well tolerated could enrol in GEMINI LTS.

 2.1.2. Vedolizumab-naïve patients
Eligibility criteria for the vedolizumab-naïve cohort of patients were 
similar to those for GEMINI 114 except that a partial Mayo score was 
used to measure disease activity instead of the complete score. A com-
plete Mayo Clinic score consists of four items [stool frequency, rectal 
bleeding, endoscopic findings and the physician’s global assessment], 
which are individually scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indi-
cating more active disease. Scores range from 0, indicating no disease 
activity, to 12, indicating severe disease. A partial Mayo score excludes 
the endoscopic item, resulting in a maximum score of 9. Vedolizumab-
naïve patients with a partial Mayo score of 3–9 [moderately to severely 
active UC] within 7 days before the first dose of vedolizumab were 
eligible for GEMINI LTS. Vedolizumab-naïve patients were ineligi-
ble if they had prior exposure to natalizumab, efalizumab or rituxi-
mab, or had received adalimumab or any investigational non-biologic 
therapy for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] in the past 30 days, or 
had received infliximab, certolizumab pegol or any investigational or 
approved biologic agent within the past 60 days.
2.2. Treatment regimen and follow-up
As per study protocol, participants received intravenous infu-
sions of vedolizumab [300 mg] every 4 weeks. Patients could 
continue treatment until December 2016 [or March 2016 in 
countries where the drug is commercially available] or until 
withdrawal. For GEMINI 1 and C13004 patients, the first dose 
of open-label vedolizumab in GEMINI LTS was given no later 
than 9 weeks after the last dose of study drug [placebo or vedoli-
zumab] in the prior study.
Patients could continue to receive stable doses of aminosalicylates 
and corticosteroids [≤30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent] during 
GEMINI LTS; however, at sites in the United States, patients with a 
clinical response to vedolizumab or who, in the opinion of the investi-
gator, had demonstrated sufficient improvement in clinical signs and 
symptoms were tapered off corticosteroids using a defined regimen 
[Supplementary Material] as required by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration [FDA] for these investigational studies. Outside of 
the United States, corticosteroid tapering was recommended, but not 
required. Immunosuppressives such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine 
and methotrexate were permitted at stable doses at sites outside of 
the United States only. Topical corticosteroids were permitted during 
the study at all sites.
2.3. Evaluation of safety
Patients were evaluated in the outpatient clinic at least every 
4 weeks. At each visit, including unscheduled visits, vital signs, 
concomitant medications and procedures, adverse events, and seri-
ous adverse events were recorded. Adverse events were reported 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
[MedDRA] and were defined as any untoward medical occurrence. 
Serious adverse events were defined as any adverse event that was 
life-threatening or resulted in death, required hospitalization or was 
considered an important medical event, or resulted in significant 
disability or birth defect, or as any occurrence of progressive mul-
tifocal leucoencephalopathy [PML]. Infusion-related reactions were 
defined as any adverse event that occurred on the calendar day of or 
one calendar day after any study drug infusion or any event defined 
by the investigator as infusion-related. Disease activity, evaluated 
using the partial Mayo score, was recorded at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12, 
and every 8 weeks thereafter. A urine pregnancy test was performed 
and a PML symptom checklist17 was administered before dosing.
2.4. Evaluation of clinical efficacy and health-related 
quality of life
GEMINI LTS was not specifically designed or powered to evaluate 
efficacy-related hypotheses. Accordingly, the efficacy data are pre-
sented using descriptive statistics. All available data for enrolled 
patients in the efficacy population are included. For all change from 
baseline assessments, the baseline score was defined at week 0 of the 
study in which the patient first participated, before any study drug 
was received.
Evaluation of clinical efficacy included: [1] clinical response 
defined by a reduction of ≥2 points and ≥25% from the baseline par-
tial Mayo score, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding 
subscore of ≥1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 
point; and [2] clinical remission defined by a partial Mayo score of ≤2 
with no individual subscore of >1. The proportions of patients with 
response or remission were calculated in two ways: [1] as observed 
rates using the number of patients at the study visit as the denomina-
tor; or 2] with nonresponder imputation using the number of enrolled 
patients as the denominator, based on the principle that patients with 
missing data were considered failures because of loss of response.
Patient-reported HRQL outcomes were assessed using the 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ], European 
Quality of Life-5 Dimension [EQ-5D] visual analogue scale [VAS], 
and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36] physical compo-
nent summary [PCS] and mental component summary [MCS] dur-
ing screening and at weeks 6, 30 and 52 during GEMINI 1 and at 
week 28, every 24 weeks for the first 4 years, and yearly from year 
5 onward during GEMINI LTS. Improvement in HRQL measures 
was reported as the mean change from the baseline score; a higher, 
more positive change indicated improvement. Increases from base-
line scores of ≥16 points for IBDQ,18 ≥3 points for SF-36 MCS and 
PCS,18 and ≥9 points for EQ-5D VAS are considered the minimums 
for clinically meaningful improvement.19
2.4.1. Populations studied in the efficacy analyses
For the purpose of this efficacy report, we focused on patients with 
moderately to severely active UC. Patients from study C13004 were 
excluded from the analyses because some patients in study C13004 
had mild UC [median partial Mayo score at baseline: 3.0; range: 
0–8]. This efficacy population comprised vedolizumab-naïve patients 
and GEMINI 1 patients who received any dose of vedolizumab in 
GEMINI LTS and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment 
analyzed. Data were summarized from the first assessment in any 
study through GEMINI LTS according to treatment in the prior 
study when applicable. Patients from GEMINI 1 who responded 
to vedolizumab induction therapy [VDZ] and were randomized to 
receive vedolizumab every 8 weeks [Q8W] or every 4 weeks [Q4W] 
or placebo [PBO] prior to open-label vedolizumab every 4 weeks 
[Q4W] in GEMINI LTS were termed VDZ/Q8W→Q4W, VDZ/
Q4W→Q4W or VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W, respectively [Table 1]. 
Patients who completed GEMINI 1 and those who withdrew early 
formed pre-specified subgroups of the efficacy population.
Long-term efficacy was evaluated for patients who completed 
GEMINI 1 on the VDZ/Q8W→Q4W and VDZ/Q4W→Q4W 
treatment regimens. These patients received vedolizumab continu-
ously after having clinical response at week 6. Data for these patients 
were combined since both groups received vedolizumab Q4W during 
GEMINI LTS and since similar treatment outcomes were observed 
in GEMINI 114 for the Q8W and Q4W maintenance dosing groups. 
Patients in the VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W group constituted an inher-
ent retreatment population in GEMINI LTS. That is, these patients 
402

 experienced an interruption in therapy for up to 1 year when receiv-
ing placebo during GEMINI 1 maintenance after initially responding 
to vedolizumab induction. The effect of increasing vedolizumab dos-
ing frequency was analyzed in the VDZ/Q8W→Q4W population 
who had a response to vedolizumab induction, but withdrew early 
from maintenance dosing every 8 weeks in GEMINI 1—for example, 
because of a loss of response [Supplementary Table 1], before receiv-
ing vedolizumab every 4 weeks in GEMINI LTS.
Patients who had prior TNF antagonist failure and those who 
were TNF antagonist-naïve formed subpopulations for efficacy 
assessments. TNF antagonist failure was pre-specified on the case 
report form during baseline evaluation as patients who had an 
inadequate response, loss of response or intolerance to prior TNF 
antagonist therapy. Patients who were TNF antagonist-naïve were 
identified on the interactive voice response system during screening 
as those who had no prior exposure to a TNF antagonist. Because 
some of the TNF antagonist-exposed patients were not recorded as 
having failed the drug, the sum of these two subcategories [failure 
and naïve] did not equal the total enrolled population.
2.5. Immunogenicity
The potential effect of immunogenicity on retreatment was examined in 
the safety population among patients in the VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W 
dosing group by measuring serum anti-vedolizumab antibody [AVA] 
concentrations during time off vedolizumab in GEMINI 1 maintenance. 
The last dose of vedolizumab during GEMINI 1 for these patients was 
week 2. Samples for AVA measurement were collected 30 min before 
dosing during GEMINI 1 at weeks 0, 6, 14, 26, 38 and 52. AVAs were 
measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a drug 
tolerance of 1 µg/ml.20 Patients with at least one positive AVA sample 
were considered AVA positive.20 The proportions of AVA-positive and 
AVA-negative patients who had clinical response and who were in clini-
cal remission after 1 year of retreatment were reported.
3. Results
3.1. Patient disposition and vedolizumab exposure
A total of 894 UC patients who were enrolled in the GEMINI LTS study 
constituted the safety population [Figure 1a]. The subset of patients 
with moderately to severely active UC on enrolment constituted the 
efficacy population [n=845]; this population excluded patients from 
the C13004 study [n=29] and patients without a post-baseline disease 
activity measurement [n=20]. Of the GEMINI 1 patients included in 
the efficacy population, 344 completed the 52-week study, while 313 
withdrew before GEMINI 1 completion [Figure 1].
As of June 27, 2013, the median duration of vedolizumab expo-
sure was 759 days [range: 113–2146] in the safety population and 
793 days [range: 134–2146] in the efficacy population. In the total 
safety population, 343 patients had discontinued the trial; 20% had 
discontinued because of lack of efficacy. Among the efficacy popula-
tion, 532 patients [63%] were continuing treatment at the time of 
this analysis. At week 100, 270 patients [32%] were ongoing, yet 
had not reached that time point in GEMINI LTS or had data missing 
for that visit [Figure 1b].
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the 
total enrolled UC population, except for patients from C13004, at the 
time of entry into GEMINI LTS are given in Table 2. Additional baseline 
demographics and disease characteristics are shown in Supplementary 
Table 2. Nearly half of patients had prior TNF antagonist therapy. 
Baseline characteristics for the subpopulation of patients with prior 
TNF antagonist failure [44%] or who were TNF antagonist-naïve 
[52%] were similar to the total population [Table 2]. At enrolment in 
GEMINI LTS, the mean partial Mayo score was 6.0 ± 1.4 for vedoli-
zumab-naïve patients. Patients who completed GEMINI 1 had a lower 
mean partial Mayo score [1.7 ± 2.0] when enrolling in GEMINI LTS 
than those who withdrew early from GEMINI 1 [6.2 ± 1.9].
3.2. Safety
At the time of this interim data analysis on June 27, 2013, the inci-
dence of any adverse event or serious adverse event in GEMINI 
LTS was 88% and 20%, respectively [Table 3]. The most common 
MedDRA terms reported as adverse events were exacerbation of 
UC and nasopharyngitis [Table 3]. Serious infections and infusion-
related reactions were infrequent with 5% and 3% of patients, 
respectively, experiencing such events [Table 3]. Approximately 
10% of patients experienced adverse events that led to study dis-
continuation [Table 3] with gastrointestinal disorders reported as 
the most common cause. No patient discontinued the study because 
of nasopharyngitis. Postoperative wound infection occurred in two 
[<1%] patients; no other postoperative adverse event was reported. 
Six patients [<1%] developed a malignancy [two with malignant 
melanoma and on each with breast cancer in situ, metastases to peri-
toneum/colon cancer, renal cancer, and malignant lung neoplasm]. 
No cases of PML were reported.
3.3. Long-term efficacy
Clinical efficacy was evaluated using the partial Mayo score. For 
the vedolizumab-naïve population, treatment with vedolizumab 
for 28 weeks resulted in 67% [n=102/153] of patients with a par-
tial Mayo score of ≤2 [Figure 2a]. Few vedolizumab-naïve patients 
[n=13] had reached 52 weeks of exposure at the time of the interim 
analysis [Figures 1b and 2a]. Consistent with efficacy outcomes, 
HRQL improvements were observed in vedolizumab-naïve patients 
as measured by changes in IBDQ, EQ-5D VAS, SF-36 PCS and SF-36 
MCS from baseline [Supplementary Table 3]. When vedolizumab-
naïve patients were evaluated by prior TNF antagonist exposure, 
63% [n=55/87] of those with TNF antagonist failure and 69% [n 
= 41/59] of those who were TNF antagonist-naïve had a partial

 Mayo score of ≤2 after 28 weeks of treatment in GEMINI LTS 
[Supplementary Table 4].
After completing the 52-week GEMINI 1 study, 71% [n = 243/342] 
of that population had a partial Mayo score of ≤2 [Figure 2b]. At week 
100 of GEMINI LTS, 79 patients had withdrawn from the study and 109 
patients were missing data, largely because they had not yet reached that 
time point [Figure 2b]. Among those with data available at week 100, the 
proportion of ongoing patients with partial Mayo score of ≤2 was 90% 
[n = 141/156] [Figure 2b]. Among the TNF antagonist-failure and TNF 
antagonist-naïve subpopulations with data available, 88% [n = 42/48] 
and 92% [n = 97/106], respectively, had a partial Mayo score of ≤2 at 
week 100 of GEMINI LTS [Supplementary Table 4]. The mean change 
from baseline partial Mayo score and 95% confidence intervals for 
GEMINI 1 patients who continued vedolizumab treatment in GEMINI 
LTS are shown in Supplementary Tables 5–7. For these analyses, partial 
Mayo scores were not available for 143 and four ongoing vedolizumab-
naïve and GEMINI 1 patients, respectively, at week 52 of GEMINI LTS, 
and for 109 ongoing GEMINI 1 patients at week 100 [Figure 2].
The percentages of patients with partial Mayo score of ≤2 reported 
here differ from those in clinical remission, because the pre-specified 
definition of remission had the added qualifier that no individual 
subscore was >1. The long-term effects of vedolizumab treatment 
on clinical response, clinical remission and HRQL are described for 
the population of patients who received vedolizumab continuously 
through GEMINI 1 and GEMINI LTS [VDZ/Q8W→Q4W and VDZ/
Q4W→Q4W populations combined]. Clinical response was reported 
in 91% [n = 124/136] of those with available data after 104 weeks 
of cumulative exposure and 97% [n = 71/73] after 152 weeks 
[Figure 3a]. Similarly, 88% [n = 120/136] and 96% [n = 70/73] of 
patients with available data were in clinical remission after 104 and 
152 weeks of cumulative treatment, respectively [Figure 3b]. When 
taking into account the number of patients without data at the study 
visit, which includes those who had withdrawn from the study, 
81% [n = 124/154] and 46% [n = 71/154] of enrolled patients in 
the efficacy population had clinical response at weeks 104 and 152, 
respectively, and 78% [n = 120/154] and 46% [n = 70/154] were in 
clinical remission [Figure 3c and 3d]. Importantly, 51 patients who 
were missing data, largely because they were still ongoing in GEMINI 
LTS and had not yet reached 152 weeks of vedolizumab exposure, 
were counted as treatment failures in this analysis [Figure 3c and 3d]. 
No statistically significant differences in clinical response and remis-
sion rates were reported between patients who completed GEMINI 1 
regardless of whether they were dosed every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks 
during maintenance before enrolling in GEMINI LTS [Supplementary

 Figure 2]. Clinical response and remission rates observed in the sub-
population of patients with prior TNF antagonist failure and those 
who were TNF antagonist-naïve were similar to the overall popula-
tion [Figure 3].
HRQL improvements, assessed by IBDQ, EQ-5D VAS, SF-36 PCS 
and SF-36 MCS mean change from baseline scores, were observed 
among patients who had received 152 weeks of cumulative vedoli-
zumab treatment in the total population as well as the TNF antag-
onist-failure and TNF antagonist-naïve subpopulations [Figure 4]. 
After 80 weeks of exposure, the mean change from baseline scores 
of ≥60 for IBDQ, >20 for EQ-5D VAS, >8 for SF-36 PCS and >11 
for SF-36 MCS was similar for patients who completed GEMINI 1 
regardless of prior TNF antagonist treatment and was generally main-
tained through 152 weeks of exposure for most scores [Figure 4].
3.4. Efficacy following retreatment
The GEMINI 1 study design and enrolment of patients in 
GEMINI LTS allowed for the evaluation of an inherent vedoli-
zumab retreatment population. During GEMINI 1, patients in 
the VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W population [45 completed GEMINI 
1; 68 withdrew early; Figure 1a] received two induction doses of 
vedolizumab before experiencing up to 1 year of interrupted ther-
apy while on placebo maintenance. Vedolizumab was re-initiated 
upon enrolment in GEMINI LTS. The median duration of time off 
drug was 229 days. After an initial response to vedolizumab dur-
ing GEMINI 1 induction, some patients in the VDZ/PBO→VDZ 
Q4W population who completed GEMINI 1 [n = 45] experienced 
a loss of clinical response while receiving placebo between week 6 
and week 52 of GEMINI 1 [Figure 5a]. At the end of placebo main-
tenance in GEMINI 1 [week 52], 69% [n = 31/45] of patients had 
clinical response [vs 91% at week 6] and 56% [n = 25/45] were in 
remission [vs 69% at week 6]. After re-initiation of vedolizumab 
treatment in GEMINI LTS, response and remission rates improved 
with 84% [n = 38/45] of patients having clinical response and 
73% [n = 33/45] in remission following 8 weeks of retreatment 
[Figure 5]. This change is similar to what was observed when 
these same patients were initially treated with vedolizumab during 
GEMINI 1 induction; 91% [n = 41/45] had clinical response and

 69% [n = 31/45] were in remission at week 6 of GEMINI 1. With 
continued treatment in GEMINI LTS, 78% [n = 35/45] and 76% 
[n = 34/45] of patients had clinical response and remission at week 
28, respectively [Figure 5]. Corresponding values at week 100 of 
GEMINI LTS were 33% [n = 15/45] and 33% [n = 15/45]. Efficacy 
with retreatment was observed regardless of TNF antagonist treat-
ment history; however, lower response and remission rates were 
generally observed among patients with TNF antagonist failure 
during the first 52 weeks of retreatment [Figure 5].
In addition, among patients who withdrew early from GEMINI 
1 while on placebo maintenance [n = 67 in the efficacy population], 
clinical response and remission rates improved within 28 weeks of 
retreatment (58% and 45%, respectively, up from 21% and 6% 
before retreatment [week 0] in GEMINI LTS). No trend was observed 
between the incidence of AVAs and duration of treatment interrup-
tion in the combined VDZ/PBO→VDZ Q4W population who com-
pleted GEMINI 1 or withdrew early; however, the highest proportion 
of AVA-positive patients was reported in the group with the longest 
duration of therapy interruption [Supplementary Table 8]. Although 
sample sizes were small, no apparent trends were observed between 
AVA-positivity during interrupted therapy and clinical response or 
clinical remission after 1 year of retreatment [Supplementary Table 8].
3.5. Effects of increased dosing frequency
The effect of vedolizumab dose intensification was evaluated in 
patients who had been receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks dur-
ing GEMINI 1 maintenance and then had an increase in dosing fre-
quency to every 4 weeks during GEMINI LTS [VDZ/Q8W→Q4W]. 
Specifically, 32 patients [30%] receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks 
during GEMINI 1 withdrew from the study early because of sus-
tained non-response, disease worsening or the need for rescue medi-
cation before enrolling in GEMINI LTS [Figure 1 and Supplementary 
Table 1]. Of these patients, 19% [n = 6/32] had clinical response and 
6% [n = 2/32] were in remission at enrolment into GEMINI LTS 
before their dosing frequency was increased to every 4 weeks. After 
28 weeks of the increased vedolizumab dosing frequency, clinical 
response and remission were reported in 53% [n = 17/32] and 25% 
[n = 8/32] of patients, respectively [Figure 6]. Corresponding val-
ues for response and remission at week 100 were 28% [n = 9/32] 
and 22% [n = 7/32], respectively. The magnitude of improvement 
noted following an increase in dosing frequency in this population 
of patients was similar in TNF antagonist-naïve and TNF antago-
nist-failure subgroups, although the absolute rates of response were 
higher in the former group [Figure 6].

 4. Discussion
The GEMINI LTS study was designed to investigate the safety of 
vedolizumab with long-term exposure in patients with UC and 
Crohn’s disease. In addition, while exploratory in nature, the study 
also allowed for the evaluation of long-term efficacy, both in the 
largest vedolizumab-treated cohort of patients with UC and with 
the longest duration of exposure to vedolizumab in a clinical trial to 
date. The results of this interim report provide valuable new infor-
mation to clinicians regarding the efficacy of vedolizumab with con-
tinuous exposure for up to 152 weeks [approximately 3 years], after 
increased dosing frequency and after an interruption of treatment 
for up to 1 year.
In the vedolizumab-naïve, TNF antagonist-naïve and TNF 
antagonist-experienced populations, improvement in clinical 
outcomes and HRQL was observed with long-term treatment in 
GEMINI LTS. Among patients with clinical response at week 6 who 
continued vedolizumab exposure throughout both studies, 81% 
[n = 114/140] were in remission after 52 weeks, 88% [n = 120/136] 
after 104 weeks and 96% [n = 70/73] after 152 weeks. To account 
for patients who may have discontinued the study because of lack 
of efficacy, patients with missing data at each study visit were con-
servatively considered treatment failures. Corresponding remission 
rates using this latter approach [n = 154] were 74%, 78% and 46% 
after 52 weeks, 104 weeks and 152 weeks, respectively. Although it 
may appear that the remission rates decline at this 3-year mark, a 
large number of ‘treatment failures’ in this calculation are misrep-
resented by the fact that patients who had not yet reached this time 
point in the study were considered failures. The collection of con-
comitant medication use was not part of the GEMINI LTS study 
protocol, precluding any conclusions on the steroid-sparing effects 
of vedolizumab. However, post-hoc analyses of GEMINI 1 data 
have shown that vedolizumab maintenance therapy resulted in 
numerically greater reductions in corticosteroid use than placebo 
and higher percentages of patients who were corticosteroid-free.21 
The range of validated assessment tools22–24 that showed improved 
HRQL in this study is further evidence of the consistent positive 
effects in both disease-specific and global measures of well-being 
experienced by patients treated with vedolizumab long-term.
Because of the chronic nature of UC, the majority of patients 
require life-long treatment, but may need to interrupt therapy for 
medical or non-medical reasons. However, reinitiating biologic 
treatment after interrupted therapy may be associated with immu-
nogenicity and reduced efficacy. We did not prospectively evalu-
ate vedolizumab efficacy and immunogenicity with retreatment. 
However, we did observe that retreatment with vedolizumab in 
GEMINI LTS after up to 1 year of interrupted therapy was as effica-
cious in inducing clinical response and remission as initial vedoli-
zumab induction treatment in the same population (84% [38/45] 
and 73% [33/45], respectively, at week 8 of retreatment in GEMINI 
LTS versus 91% [41/45] and 69% [31/45], respectively, at week 6 
of GEMINI 1). Furthermore, development of AVAs during inter-
rupted therapy did not appear to affect retreatment efficacy; how-
ever, these data are limited by the small number of patients who 
were AVA-positive.

 At the time of this interim report, 178 UC patients had discon-
tinued participation citing a lack of vedolizumab efficacy. One pos-
sible strategy in patients who lose response to a TNF antagonist is to 
increase the dose and/or dosing frequency.25 Long-term experience 
with vedolizumab has thus far been limited because of its relatively 
recent approval. However, because of the different dosing protocols 
in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI LTS, the effect of dose intensification 
from every 8 weeks to every 4 weeks in patients who withdrew early 
from the GEMINI 1 study could be evaluated. Although dosing 
of vedolizumab every 4 weeks is not approved by some countries, 
including the United States26 and Canada, our data suggest that a sub-
set of patients may benefit from an increased dosing regimen. These 
patients may have discontinued GEMINI 1 because of the need for 
rescue medication or disease worsening as outlined in the GEMINI 
LTS enrolment criteria and may hypothetically represent a popula-
tion of patients with more refractory disease than those in the same 
dosing group who completed the study. Within 28 weeks of treat-
ment in GEMINI LTS, an increase in vedolizumab dosing frequency 
offered improvements in clinical outcomes of response [53%] and 
remission [25%] and HRQL, suggesting a benefit of an increase to 
4-weekly dosing for some patients who lose response to 8-weekly 
dosing. Notably, population pharmacokinetics modelling20 using data 
collected during GEMINI 1 showed that among patients who were 
receiving vedolizumab every 8 weeks during maintenance, those who 
withdrew early had numerically lower predicted vedolizumab serum 
concentrations at week 52 [30.5 µg/ml; range, 15.7–98.9] than those 
who completed the study [36.9 µg/ml; range, 18.1–138.2] despite the 
same dosing frequency.27 A greater inflammatory burden may hypo-
thetically lead to increased drug clearance and reduced serum drug 
concentration, as has been observed for TNF antagonists.28 Future 
studies that prospectively examine the dose–response relationship of 
vedolizumab are required to investigate the clinical impact of tailor-
ing dosing frequency in select patient populations.
While TNF antagonists are commonly used for treatment of UC, 
long-term treatment is limited by the loss or lack of response in up to 
40% of patients.4 Furthermore, after failure with one TNF antago-
nist, patients may be less likely to respond to another.29 A prospec-
tive trial comparing vedolizumab to a second TNF antagonist in 
this patient population should clarify whether a switch to vedoli-
zumab offers an advantage. The data presented here show that the 
subpopulation of patients with prior failure to TNF antagonist ther-
apy experienced clinical benefits with vedolizumab similar to those 
experienced by the overall population, and that these benefits con-
tinued with long-term treatment. Similarly, patients who were TNF 
antagonist-naïve responded well to vedolizumab treatment and con-
tinued to demonstrate improvements for up to 152 weeks of treat-
ment. Considering the efficacy in the anti-TNF-naïve subpopulation, 
vedolizumab may serve as an attractive first-line alternative in UC 
patients who have failed conventional therapies such as immunosup-
pressives, 5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. Furthermore, these

 data suggest that once a patient has initially responded with vedoli-
zumab, the likelihood that the patient will maintain response is high, 
regardless of past treatment history.
The adverse event profile with long-term vedolizumab treat-
ment during GEMINI LTS was similar to what has been previously 
reported.14,30 In particular, the incidence of serious adverse events 
was relatively low, with 5% of patients experiencing serious infec-
tions during GEMINI LTS. The low risk of systemic infections 
supports the gut-selective mechanism of action of vedolizumab; 
however, ongoing risk assessments are in progress to monitor the 
occurrence of enteric adverse events and long-term adverse events 
such as malignancy, and the risk of PML. Importantly, no cases of 
PML have been reported to date.30 More detailed analyses of the 
interim safety data from GEMINI LTS are included in a separate 
comprehensive safety summary of vedolizumab.30
Taken together, preliminary data from GEMINI LTS demonstrate 
the long-term efficacy of vedolizumab treatment for the maintenance 
of remission in patients with UC. Despite the limitations of these 
analyses, including the potential bias associated with a non-blinded, 
non-randomized, uncontrolled study, the fact that 63% of patients 
within the efficacy population were still enrolled in the study at the 
time of this interim report is notable. The efficacy of vedolizumab for 
this chronic disease is further illustrated by different clinical scenar-
ios, such as retreatment after an interruption in therapy, treatment 
in patients who have previously failed TNF antagonist therapy and 
treatment in biologic-naïve patients. Although this study – which 
began years before regulatory approval of vedolizumab every 8 
weeks – administered vedolizumab every 4 weeks, the results still 
provide valuable insight for clinical practice. Increase in vedoli-
zumab dosing frequency, for example, may be a viable treatment 
approach for a subset of patients; however, prospective studies are 
needed to identify which patients might benefit.
