Abstract
Background: The colorectal cancer antigen GUCY2C exhibits unique split tolerance, evoking antigen-specific CD8+,
but not CD4+, T-cell responses that deliver anti-tumor immunity without autoimmunity in mice. Here, the cancer
vaccine Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE was evaluated in a first-in-man phase I clinical study of patients with early-stage
colorectal cancer to assess its safety and immunological efficacy.
Methods: Ten patients with surgically-resected stage I or stage II (pN0) colon cancer received a single
intramuscular injection of 1011 viral particles (vp) of Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE. Safety assessment and immunomonitoring
were carried out for 6 months following immunization. This trial employed continual monitoring of both efficacy
and toxicity of subjects as joint primary outcomes.
Results: All patients receiving Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE completed the study and none developed adverse events
greater than grade 1. Antibody responses to GUCY2C were detected in 10% of patients, while 40% exhibited
GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses. GUCY2C-specific responses were exclusively CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, mimicking
pre-clinical studies in mice in which GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T cells are eliminated by self-tolerance, while CD8+ T
cells escape tolerance and mediate antitumor immunity. Moreover, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to
the Ad5 vector were associated with poor vaccine-induced responses, suggesting that Ad5 NAbs oppose GUCY2C
immune responses to the vaccine in patients and supported by mouse studies.
Conclusions: Split tolerance to GUCY2C in cancer patients can be exploited to safely generate antigen-specific
cytotoxic CD8+, but not autoimmune CD4+, T cells by Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE in the absence of pre-existing NAbs to
the viral vector.

Introduction
While checkpoint inhibitor and CAR-T cell therapies
have initiated a paradigm shift in the management of
some cancers [1], there remains an unmet need for
improved treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), the 4th
leading cause of cancer and 2nd leading cause of cancer
mortality worldwide [2]. At the time of initial diagnosis,
about two-thirds of CRC patients undergo surgical resec-
tion with curative intent, but 30–50% of these patients ex-
perience recurrence and die of their disease. Adjuvant
chemotherapy only marginally improves survival in stage
III disease, and has no benefit in pN0 (stage I and II;
lymph node negative) patients. Moreover, checkpoint
inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab are ef-
fective only in microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC [3],
reflecting their high density of mutation-associated neoan-
tigens targeted by effector T cells [4, 5]. In contrast,

 checkpoint inhibitors are ineffective against microsatellite
stable (MSS) CRC which accounts for 85% of cases. These
considerations underscore the clinical opportunity for
novel therapeutics, particularly immunotherapies, to pre-
vent disease recurrence and improve survival in patients
with stage I-III colorectal cancer. In that context, immu-
notherapeutic paradigms in cancer may be most effective
in the prevention of recurrent metastases in patients with
minimal residual disease [6]. Thus, emerging tumor vac-
cine paradigms that promote durable antitumor efficacy
without autoimmunity, represent a unique opportunity to
improve colorectal cancer outcomes.
Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C), a membrane-spanning
receptor synthesizing the second messenger cyclic GMP
(cGMP), is selectively expressed by intestinal epithelial
cells and a subset of neurons [7–10] and near-universally
overexpressed in colorectal cancer. Indeed, GUCY2C has
been detected in ~ 1000 CRC specimens, but not in
extra-gastrointestinal parenchymal tissues or tumors [7,
11,
12].
Moreover,
within
intestinal
epithelial
cells,
GUCY2C is localized in apical brush border membranes,
placing it outside the mucosal barrier [13]. The anatomical
and functional compartmentalization of GUCY2C has
been confirmed by RT-qPCR [13, 14], radioligand imaging
and biodistribution [13], and immunotoxin [15], vaccine
[16–20], and CAR-T cell [21, 22] treatment. Together, in-
testinal compartmentalization and near-universal expres-
sion by primary and recurrent colorectal cancer [14, 23,
24], establish GUCY2C as an attractive target for immu-
notherapeutic prevention of colorectal cancer recurrence.
Adenovirus (Ad5)-delivered GUCY2C-based vaccines
induce antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell and antibody re-
sponses in syngeneic mice [16–20, 25–27]. Mediated by
CD8+ T-cells rather than antibodies, these immune
responses target colorectal cancer metastases in lung
and liver in mouse models of prophylaxis and therapy
[16, 18–20, 26, 27]. Immunization with GUCY2C-based
vaccines produces memory CD8+ T-cell responses that
provide durable protection against metastases in mice,
modeling vaccination in CRC patients with minimum
residual disease [16–18]. Importantly, GUCY2C vaccin-
ation provides therapeutic efficacy in the absence of
autoimmunity [16–20].
Beyond the safety and efficacy of GUCY2C vaccination,
preclinical studies in mice demonstrated that self-tolerance,
which limits the production of immune responses to self
proteins and subsequent autoimmunity, reduced vaccine-
induced CD8+ T-cell responses to GUCY2C, and elimi-
nated GUCY2C-specific antibody and CD4+ T-cell re-
sponses [18–20]. However, self-tolerance in mice did
not directly impact GUCY2C-specific CD8+ T cells and
antibody-producing B cells [18]. Rather, self-tolerance
eliminated GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T cells, which serve
an essential “helper” role in the production of CD8+
T-cell and B-cell responses [18]. Thus, self-tolerance is
uniquely “split” - eliminating GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T
cells, while preserving functional pools of CD8+ T and B
cells which can be activated with GUCY2C-independent
CD4+ T-cell help [18]. Indeed, inclusion of CD4+ T-cell
epitopes from influenza hemagglutinin (S1) or the syn-
thetic

T-cell
epitope

activated
GUCY2C-specific CD8+ T and B cells, improving vaccine
antitumor efficacy > 750%, without autoimmunity [17, 18].
Here, we translate observations of split tolerance to
GUCY2C from animal models to humans in a phase I
clinical trial establishing selective CD4+ T-cell tolerance as
a key mechanism influencing cancer vaccine responses in
humans, and which may be leveraged to elicit antitumor
immunity without autoimmune toxicity.
Materials and methods
Study design and treatment
This was a phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01972737) of stage I or II (pN0) colon cancer
within 3 years of surgery and no clinical or laboratory
evidence of local or systemic recurrence. The study
protocol and all amendments were approved by the
Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board
(IRB) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The
study was conducted in accordance with the protocol,
Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the ethical principles
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the NIH
Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Syn-
thetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. All patients provided
written informed consent to participate.
Ad5 vectors have well-established potency to induce
antigen-specific immune responses in animal models
and humans, as well as a long and impressive safety rec-
ord. PADRE is a CD4+ T-cell epitope that is active in
the context of most human HLA molecules [28] and is
required to optimally induce GUCY2C-specific immune
responses and efficacy in animal models [17, 18].
Codon-optimized cDNA encoding human GUCY2C
residues 1–429 with a C-terminal PADRE epitope
(Fig. 1a) was cloned into the E1 region of pAd/CMV/
V5 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing E1-
and E3-deleted human serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad5; Fig.
1b). Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE vector used for these stud-
ies was produced under GMP conditions at the Baylor
College of Medicine in the Cell and Gene Therapy Vec-
tor Development Laboratory.
In vitro GUCY2C-expression experiments (dose-re-
sponse and time-course) were carried out in A549
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells. Virus was added to the cul-
tures at the indicated doses and culture supernatants
were collected at the indicated time points. Relative
GUCY2C levels were quantified in supernatants by west-
ern blot using MS7 mouse anti-GUCY2C monoclonal

 antibody [9, 21, 26] and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno, West Grove, PA).
Patients received a single intramuscular injection
of 1011 viral particles (vp) Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE.
Safety assessment was carried out in-clinic for 30
min and via phone call for 1 week. Patients returned
for in-clinic safety assessment and immunomonitor-
ing blood collection on days 30, 90, and 180 days
after immunization. This trial employed continual
monitoring of both efficacy and toxicity of subjects
as joint primary outcomes. All patients completed
the study.

 Human subject Immunomonitoring
Venous blood was collected into BD Vacutainer® Glass
Serum Tubes for serum collection and BD Vacutainer®
CPT™ Mononuclear Cell Preparation Tubes with Sodium
Citrate for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
isolation. For serum collection, blood samples were in-
cubated 30 min at 37 °C, centrifuged, and supernatants
were transferred to cryovials and stored at − 20 °C.
PBMCs were collected by centrifugation according to
manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were then washed
with 1x CTL-WASH™ buffer (Cellular Technology Lim-
ited, Cleveland, OH), counted using a Muse Cell Analyzer
(Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and cryopreserved in
CTL-Cryo™ ABC freezing medium (Cellular Technology
Limited) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cryovials were frozen at − 80 °C overnight in a CoolCell®
LX Alcohol-free Cryopreservation Container (Biocision,
Mill Valley, CA) before long-term storage in LN2.
GUCY2C-specific antibody quantification by ELISA
Hexahistidine-tagged human GUCY2CECD (amino acids 1–
429) protein was produced in suspension HEK293 cells and
purified to > 90% purity by immobilized metal affinity chro-
matography (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). Nunc-Immuno
PolySorp plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated for
4 h at room temperature with human GUCY2CECD protein
at 10 μg/mL in coating buffer (Immunochemistry Tech-
nologies, Bloomington, MN). Plates were washed and free
binding sites were blocked with SynBlock (Immunochemis-
try Technologies) overnight at room temperature. Serum
samples were thawed and titrated in coated, washed plates
from 1/20 to 1/2560 in 10% nonfat dry milk and incubated
2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and bound
human antibody was detected with HRP-conjugated goat
anti-human antibody (Jackson Immuno) for 2 h at room
temperature. Following a final wash, Turbo TMB substrate
(ThermoFisher Scientific Pierce, Waltham, MA) was added
and the plates incubated for color development, followed
by determination of optical absorbance (POLARstar
Optima plate reader, BMG Labtech, Cary, NC).
T-cell response quantification by ELISpot
Human IFNγ SC Enzymatic ELISpot plates (Cellular Tech-
nology Limited) were coated according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. PBMC samples were thawed using
CTL Anti-Aggregate Wash™ (Cellular Technology Limited)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 5 × 105 vi-
able cells/well were plated in ELISpot plates in serum-free
CTL-Test™ Medium (Cellular Technology Limited) with-
out a rest period. Antigens were prepared and added to
PBMCs
at
the
indicated
final
concentrations
in
CTL-Test™ Medium (Cellular Technology Limited)
with 1% DMSO in all conditions: 1% DMSO (ATCC);
1 μg/mL Ad5 Peptide Mix (PM-HAdV5, JPT Peptide
Technologies, Berlin, Germany); 2 and 10 μg/mL human
GUCY2C Peptide Mix (custom 15 mer/11 aa overlap li-
brary of human GUCY2C1–429, JPT Peptide Technolo-
gies); 1 μg/mL PADRE (BAP-251, EMC Microcollections,
Tübingen, Germany). Plates were incubated overnight at
37 °C/5% CO2 followed by development according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Spots were quantified using
an ImmunoSpot® S6 Universal Analyzer (Cellular Tech-
nology Limited). For CD4/CD8 depletion experiments,
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were negatively selected from
thawed PBMC samples by magnetic-activated cell sort-
ing
(MACS;
Miltenyi
Biotec,
Bergisch
Gladbach,
Germany) prior to ELISpot analysis. Small aliquots of
PBMCs or CD4- or CD8-depleted PBMCs were stained
with anti-CD4-PerCP (clone S3.5, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and anti-CD8-Alexa Fluor® 700 (clone 3B5, Invitro-
gen) and analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer.
Analyses were performed using FlowJo software (FlowJo,
LLC, Ashland, CA).
Ad5 NAb titer quantification
Mouse or human serum samples were heat-inactivated
for 1 h at 56 °C and then titered in duplicate from 1/20
to 1/10240 in black 96-well tissue culture plates, 50 μL/well
final volume. 108 vp of Ad5-CMV-eGFP virus (Vector De-
velopment Lab, Baylor College of Medicine) was added to
each well of titered serum (50 μL/well of 2x109 vp/mL).
105 A549 cells (ATCC) were then added to each well
(100 μL
of
106
cells/mL).
For
quantification
of
%
neutralization by serum samples, controls included virus
with cells alone (0% neutralization) and cells alone (100%
neutralization). Plates incubated 41 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 be-
fore quantification of eGFP fluorescence (490 nm excita-
tion, 510 nm emission) using a POLARstar Optima plate
reader (BMG Labtech). Sample fluorescence was normal-
ized to controls described above and titers were deter-
mined using nonlinear regression as the serum dilution
producing 50% neutralization (Prism v7, GraphPad Soft-
ware, La Jolla, CA).
Mouse Ad5 NAb studies
Animal studies were approved by the Thomas Jefferson
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). All mouse studies employed ~ 10 week old
female BALB/c mice (Jackson, Bar Harbor, ME). Females
were nulliparous and not pregnant. To establish Ad5
NAb titers, vehicle control (naïve) or control Ad5 (Ad5
NAb High) were administered intramuscularly as two
50 μL injections, one in each of the two hind limbs. Ad5
exposure was repeated 21 days later to establish high Ad5
NAb titers. Two weeks after completing the above Ad5
exposures, serum was collected for Ad5 NAb titer deter-
minations and animals were immunized with 108 IFU
Ad5-GUCY2C-S1 [18]. Two weeks later, serum and

 splenocytes were collected and GUCY2C-specific antibody
and GUCY2C- and Ad5- specific CD8+ T-cell responses
were quantified as previously described [16–20].
Statistical analysis
Human antibody responses
A mixed effect model assuming the interaction between
serum dilution (1/20, 1/40, etc.) and immune status (pre--
vaccination vs post-vaccination) with random effect of
replications was applied and the one-sided comparison of
immune status at different dilutions was determined. The
titer was identified as the greatest dilution producing a
significantly higher signal than pre-vaccination serum at
the same dilution.
Human T-cell responses
For GUCY2C-specific responses, data obtained from
10 μg/mL GUCY2C was employed for analysis unless
pre-vaccination signals with 10 μg/mL GUCY2C were >
50 spots/well, indicating a high level of non-specific acti-
vation at that concentration. In that case, data obtained
from 2 μg/mL GUCY2C was used for analysis. Modified
Distribution Free Resampling (mDFR) algorithms [29]
were applied to compare antigen-stimulated (test count)
responses to DMSO (control count) at each day, as well
as the pairwise comparisons of the antigen-specific
changes (DMSO-subtracted) between day 0 (pre-vacci-
nation; control count) and each post-vaccination time
point (test count). The difference between the log of the
test count and the log of the background control count is
referred to as mDFR(eq), while the difference between the
log of the test count and twice the log of the background
control count is referred to as mDFR(2x). A positive
antigen-specific response (antigen vs. DMSO) required
that antigen vs DMSO at time point X is P < 0.05 and
antigen-specific spots at time X > 5. A positive vaccine-in-
duced response at time point X (antigen-specific response
at time X vs time 0) required that antigen vs DMSO at X
is P < 0.05 and antigen-specific response (antigen minus
DMSO)
at
time
X
vs
time
0
is
P
< 0.05
and
antigen-specific spots at time X > 5. We refer to a result as
strongly significant if the mDFR(2x) P < 0.05 and moder-
ately significant if it is not strongly significant, but the
mDFR(eq) P < 0.05. ELISpot responses in patients follow-
ing CD4/CD8-depletion were compared by Two-way
ANOVA with GraphPad Prism v7. For comparisons of
Ad5 NAb High and Low patients, for each antigen
(GUCY2C, PADRE, and Ad5), the mean difference of
antigen and DMSO between High patients and Low pa-
tients was compared. A mixed effect model assuming
the interaction between time and Ad5 NAb status
(High vs. Low) with random effect of patients was ap-
plied and Low vs. High differences between each day
and day 0 were determined.
Animal models
Responses in animal models were compared by T-test or
Two-way ANOVA, as appropriate, with GraphPad Prism v7.
Results
Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE vector
Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE is composed of an E1/E3-deleted
recombinant human type 5 adenovirus expressing the hu-
man GUCY2C extracellular domain (ECD; GUCY2C1–429)
fused on its C-terminus to the universal CD4+ T-helper
cell epitope PADRE (Fig. 1a and b). Previous studies dem-
onstrated that only the extracellular domain of GUCY2C
is a viable vaccine target reflecting the high sequence
conservation of the intracellular domains of guanylyl
cyclase family members and broad tissue distribution
of guanylyl cyclases A, B, and G [20]. GUCY2CECD--
PADRE and an upstream CMV promoter were cloned
into the E1 region of Ad5 (Fig. 1b). Replication-defi-
cient Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE vector was produced in
HEK293 cells and purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation
employing GMP procedures at the Center for Cell and
Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine. In vitro
studies
confirmed
dose-dependent
(Fig.
1c)
and
time-dependent (Fig. 1d) expression and secretion of
GUCY2CECD-PADRE protein by western blot.
Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE safety profile
Ten colorectal cancer patients were enrolled and treated
with 1011 vp Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE. Additional file 1:
Table S1 describes the baseline patient characteristics. The
median age was 65 (49–76) years, patients were primarily
Caucasian (80%) and patients were distributed equally be-
tween male and female. All patients had stage I or II colo-
rectal cancer previously treated with surgery but not
chemo/radio/immuno-therapy. Treatment-related acute
toxicity was assessed in the clinic every 10 min for 30 min
after injection and by telephone on days 3 and 8 following
vaccination. Patients also returned to the clinic 30, 90, and
180 days after vaccination for safety assessment. All pa-
tients completed the study. Adverse events (Table 1) were
graded according to The Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). Mild grade 1/2
toxicities included injection site pain and fever which are

 anticipated following a viral vector immunization. No
grade 3/4 toxicities occurred at any time during the
6-month follow-up period after vaccination. Moreover,
clinical laboratory assessments performed on days 30,
90, and 180, including CBC with differential, compre-
hensive chemistry panel, and antinuclear antibody (ANA)
titers, revealed no vaccine-related adverse events. Import-
antly, no adverse events related to toxicity in GUCY2C-ex-
pressing tissues were observed. GUCY2C is a self protein
expressed on the luminal surface of small and large in-
testinal epithelia [7, 8], as well as anorexigenic hypo-
thalamic and midbrain dopaminergic neurons [9, 10].
However, consistent with mechanisms controlling im-
mune compartmentalization [30], preclinical studies of
GUCY2C vaccination in mice [16–20] confirmed the
absence of Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE-induced autoimmun-
ity in intestine or brain.
Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE-induced immune responses
In
preclinical
studies,
immunization
with
Ad5-
GUCY2C-PADRE induced time- and dose-dependent
GUCY2C-specific T-cell and B-cell responses and an-
titumor immunity mediated by CD8+ T cells [17–20, 26].
Here, GUCY2C-specific immune responses were quanti-
fied after Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE administration by ELISA
and IFNγ-ELISpot to quantify antibody and T-cell re-
sponses, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2). T-cell
responses to PADRE and Ad5 also were quantified by
IFNγ-ELISpot. Patient responses typically followed 1 of 4
patterns and representative responses of each are shown
in Fig. 2. All other patient responses are shown in Add-
itional file 1: Figure S1. Patient 1001 had no pre-vaccine
antibody responses to GUCY2C or T-cell immunity to
GUCY2C, PADRE, or Ad5 and Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE
vaccination did not induce responses to these antigens
(Fig. 2a). Similarly, while no pre-vaccination responses
were observed in patient 1009, vaccination induced
Ad5-specific T-cell responses, but not GUCY2C-specific
or PADRE-specific responses (Fig. 2b). In contrast to these
patients, patient 1008 possessed Ad5-specific T-cell re-
sponses prior to vaccination, and Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE
vaccination increased those responses (Fig. 2c). Similarly,
GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses also were induced by
Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE vaccination, initially peaking on
day 30, followed by a gradual decline through the final
180-day time-point (Fig. 2c). However, this patient pro-
duced no PADRE-specific T-cell response or GUCY2C-
specific antibody response, recapitulating preclinical
studies in mice in which GUCY2C-specific antibody re-
sponses require responses to exogenous CD4+ “helper”
T-cell epitopes, reflecting GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T-cell
tolerance [17–20, 26]. Patient 1007 was the only patient
that produced a response by all three arms of adaptive im-
munity (Fig. 2d). That patient produced a PADRE-specific
CD4+ T-cell response, a GUCY2C-specific antibody re-
sponse, and a GUCY2C-specific CD8+ T-cell response
that peaked between days 30 and 90, before declining over
the remainder of the study.
GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses are exclusively CD8+ T-cell
Preclinical studies in mice revealed split tolerance to
GUCY2C, eliminating CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T or
B cells, which could be fully engaged with exogenous
CD4+ helper T-cell epitopes (S1 or PADRE) to produce
antitumor immunity without autoimmunity [18–20]. To
extend that observation from mice to humans, CD4+ or
CD8+ T cells were depleted from PBMCs of patients
1007 and 1008 (GUCY2C responders, Fig. 2), prior to
quantification of T-cell responses by IFNγ-ELISpot to
determine the cell type responsible for GUCY2C-specific
responses (Fig. 3). Depletion of CD8+, but not CD4+, T
cells (Fig. 3a, c) eliminated ELISpot responses in both
patients (Fig. 3b, d). Thus, vaccine responses in colon
cancer patients are mediated exclusively by CD8+ T cells,
recapitulating GUCY2C immunology in mice [18–20].
Indeed, selective CD4+ T-cell tolerance appears to be a
universal mechanism regulating GUCY2C-specific im-
munity, eliminating GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T cells, but
not B cells or CD8+ T cells, in C57BL/6 [17, 19, 20] and
BALB/c [18, 20, 26] mice and in humans (Figs. 2 and 3).
Ad5 neutralizing antibodies may limit Ad5-GUCY2C-
PADRE immunogenicity in patients
Adenovirus, including serotype 5 (Ad5) used in Ad5-
GUCY2C-PADRE, is a natural pathogen producing mild
infections in humans. Natural exposures induce Ad5-
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that inhibit future infec-
tions or gene delivery by recombinant adenoviruses,
including Ad5-based vaccines, by preventing infection of
host cells required for antigen expression and induction
of immune responses [31–34]. To determine the impact
of Ad5 NAbs on Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE immunogenicity,
Ad5 NAbs were quantified in patient serum collected
prior to Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE vaccination (day 0) using
an Ad5-GFP reporter virus inhibition bioassay (Fig. 4a).
Titers ranged from < 10 to > 10,000 and an obvious pat-
tern emerged in which 50% of the patients had titers
below 200 (Ad5 NAb Low) and the other 50% were char-
acterized by titers above 200 (Ad5 NAb High; Fig. 4b).
Separating patients into Ad5 NAb Low and High cohorts
revealed a relationship between Ad5 NAb titer and
GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses in which responses
were significantly greater in Ad5 NAb Low patients
(Fig. 4c). PADRE-specific T-cell responses, which were
generally low, showed no relationship to Ad5 NAb titer
(Fig. 4d). Similar to GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses
(Fig. 4c), Ad5-specific T-cell responses also were lim-
ited in the Ad5 NAb High group (Fig. 4e).

 Fig. 2 Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE-induced immune responses. Patient blood samples were collected before (day 0) and 30, 90 and 180 days after Ad5-
GUCY2C-PADRE immunization. GUCY2C-specific antibody titers were quantified by ELISA and GUCY2C, PADRE, and Ad5 -specific T-cell responses were
quantified by IFNγ-ELISpot. ELISpot assays employed DMSO as an antigen-negative control. The statistical significance for T-cell responses at each time
point (compared to DMSO) was determined by modified DFR(eq) or DFR(2x) after Westfall–Young max-T correction, and p-values < 5% are shown in
yellow [mDFR(eq)] or red [mDFR(2x)], respectively. The statistical significance of T-cell responses obtained for each post-vaccination time point
(compared to day 0) were determined by a similar modified DFR-like permutation method with Westfall-Young max-T correction. Representative
GUCY2C non-responders (a and b) and responders (c and d) are shown. All other patient responses are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1

 Mouse models confirm Ad5 NAb sensitivity of Ad5-
GUCY2C vaccines
To confirm the impact of Ad5 NAbs on GUCY2C vac-
cination with Ad5 vectors in a mouse model, mice were
exposed to control Ad5 vector by two intramuscular im-
munizations, producing animals with high Ad5 NAb
titers (~ 3000; Fig. 5a and b). Ad5-naïve mice or mice
with high Ad5 NAb titers were then immunized with
Ad5-GUCY2C-S1 (a mouse GUCY2C vaccine analogous
to Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE [18]), and GUCY2C-specific
antibody (Fig. 5c) and CD8+ T-cell responses (Fig. 5d) were
quantified. Consistent with previous mouse studies [31]
and human responses to Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE (Fig. 4),
pre-existing Ad5 NAbs eliminated GUCY2C-specific anti-
body (Fig. 5c) and CD8+ T-cell responses (Fig. 5d) in mice.
Together, these data suggest that pre-existing Ad5 NAb
immunity eliminates Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE viral particles
in vivo prior to entry into host cells, preventing subsequent
gene expression and induction of host immune responses,
establishing pre-existing Ad5 immunity as a potential
barrier to Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE vaccination in human
populations.
Discussion
There is a significant unmet need for improved treatment
for CRC, the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality world-
wide [35]. Most patients undergo surgical resection with
curative intent, but 30–50% of these patients experience
recurrence and die, underscoring the clinical opportunity
for novel therapeutics to improve survival, especially in pa-
tients with stage I-III disease. Given that immunotherapies
may be most effective in preventing recurrent metastases
in patients with minimal residual disease [6], we identified
GUCY2C as a promising vaccine target for secondary CRC
prevention [16–20]. Here, we translated that paradigm to a
first-in-man study examining the safety and immunological
efficacy of Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE in patients with stage
I-II colon cancer. Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE induced antibody
and/or T-cell responses directed to GUCY2C in immu-
nized patients, without significant (≥ grade 3) toxicities.

collected 30 days after Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE administration were left unsorted or depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells by MACS. PBMCs, CD4-
depleted PBMCs, and CD8-depleted PBMCs were analyzed by FACS to confirm depletion (a and c) and tested for GUCY2C-specific T-cell
responses by IFNγ-ELISpot (b and d). NS = not significant, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001, Two-way ANOVA. Depletion efficiencies
determined by FACS were > 98% for CD4+ T cells and ~ 75–95% for CD8+ T cells

 Importantly, GUCY2C-specific T-cell responses involved
cytotoxic CD8+, but not CD4+ helper, T cells, recapitulating
results in mice identifying selective CD4+ T-cell tolerance
as the primary mechanism restricting GUCY2C-specific
antitumor immunity [18]. Thus, studies here establish not
only the safety and efficacy of Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE in
colorectal cancer patients, but also the importance of
“split” tolerance (elimination of CD4+ helper, but not CD8+
cytolytic T or B cells) as a mechanism shaping immune
responses to self antigens in humans. These observations

Ad5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) employing an in vitro Ad5-GFP reporter virus inhibition assay (a). The Ad5 NAb titer was calculated as the dilution
of serum that produced 50% inhibition of GFP reporter expression. b patients were rank-ordered by Ad5 NAb titers and patients with titers < 200 were
designated as Ad5 NAb Low, while those with titers > 200 where designated Ab5 NAb High (dotted line indicates a titer of 200). c-e
antigen-specific responses to GUCY2C (c), PADRE (d), and Ad5 (e) were compared in Ad5 NAb Low and High patient populations by
IFNγ-ELISpot (mixed effect model). # P = 0.052, *** P < 0.001
Fig. 5 Ad5 neutralizing antibodies limit GUCY2C responses in mice. BALB/c mice were naïve or preconditioned by immunizing 2 times with 108 IFU
control Ad5 to induce High Ad5 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers (n = 10 mice/group). a, b two weeks after preconditioning, serum was collected and an
in vitro assay quantifying inhibition of A549 cell infection by an Ad5-GFP reporter virus in the presence of serum titrations (a) was used to calculate Ad5
NAb titers (b). The Ad5 NAb titer was calculated as the dilution of serum that produced 50% inhibition of GFP reporter expression. c, d mice were then
immunized with 108 IFU of Ad5-mGUCY2C-S1 expressing mouse GUCY2C fused to the CD4+ T-helper cell epitope S1. GUCY2C-specific antibody (c) and
CD8+ T-cell responses (d) were quantified two weeks later by ELISA and IFNγ-ELISpot, respectively. Bars in (c) indicate serum dilutions of 1/20, 1/40, 1/80,

 directly impact GUCY2C vaccine design, potentially impli-
cating PADRE as a poor provider of CD4+ T-cell help in
viral vaccines. PADRE is a synthetic CD4+ T-cell epitope
which binds most HLA class II molecules and safely in-
duces CD4+ T-cell responses in patients when adminis-
tered in DNA [36], dendritic cell [37], and peptide [38]
immunizations. However, results here suggest that PADRE
may be poorly immunogenic in the context of adenoviral
vaccines, necessitating improved delivery of exogenous
CD4+ helper T-cell responses for GUCY2C vaccination.
While GUCY2C-specific Th1 effector CD4+ T-cell re-
sponses are absent in mice [18–20] and humans (Fig. 3),
mechanisms underlying their loss have not been defined.
These may include deletion, anergy, FoxP3+ regulatory
(Treg) induction, or others, creating additional opportun-
ities to enhance Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE efficacy (Treg de-
pletion, for example). In that context, a TCR “retrogenic”
mouse model was recently developed to explore mecha-
nisms underlying GUCY2C-specific CD4+ T-cell tolerance
and solutions to overcome tolerance [39], potentially pro-
viding alternatives to incorporation of PADRE to elicit
GUCY2C-specific immunity.
Beyond GUCY2C, other self antigens are characterized
by split tolerance eliminating CD4+ T-cell help, while pre-
serving functional cytolytic CD8+ T cells. In mice, the mel-
anosomal antigen Trp2 (tyrosinase-related protein 2) and
the growth factor receptor Her2 elicit CD8+, but not
CD4+, T-cell responses. However, provision of exogenous
CD4+ T-cell help elicited robust cytolytic CD8+ T-cell re-
sponses, CD8+ memory T-cell responses, and antitumor
immunity [18]. In that context, enhancing CD4+ T-cell
help in vaccines targeting these and other self antigens,
could substantially improve therapeutic efficacy.
GUCY2C protein (> 200 specimens) and/or mRNA
(> 900 specimens) is present in nearly all primary and
metastatic human colorectal tumors, regardless of anatom-
ical location or grade [7, 11–13, 40–44], and is over-
expressed by > 80% of colorectal tumors [40, 45, 46]. Be-
yond CRC, GUCY2C is ectopically expressed in approxi-
mately 60% of pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers
[47–50]. Thus, Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE may benefit not
only CRC patients, but also patients with gastroesophageal
and pancreatic cancers, which are typically fatal. Indeed, ~
25% of all cancer-related deaths in the U.S result from
malignancies that may express GUCY2C and which may
be treated with GUCY2C-targeted therapies [35].
In conclusion, Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE is a promising
immunotherapeutic for CRC patients with minimal re-
sidual disease (stage I-III), as well as patients with gastric,
esophageal, and pancreatic cancers. Ad5-GUCY2C-PADRE
elicited antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses in patients
following a single administration, without toxicity. Import-
antly, as in mice [18], split tolerance selectively involving
CD4+ T cells is a primary mechanism limiting cancer
vaccine efficacy in humans that may be exploited to safely
elicit antitumor immunity. Thus, optimal provision of
CD4+ T-cell help may be critical to fully engage self
antigen-specific CD8+ T and B cells and produce meaning-
ful antitumor immunity and clinical efficacy with cancer
vaccines targeting GUCY2C and other self antigens.
