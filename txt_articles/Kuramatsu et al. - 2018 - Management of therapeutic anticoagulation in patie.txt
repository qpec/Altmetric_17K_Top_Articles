Aims
Evidence is lacking regarding acute anticoagulation management in patients after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)
with implanted mechanical heart valves (MHVs). Our objective was to investigate anticoagulation reversal and re-
sumption strategies by evaluating incidences of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, thereby defining
an optimal time-window when to restart therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) in patients with MHV and ICH.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We pooled individual patient-data (n = 2504) from a nationwide multicentre cohort-study (RETRACE, conducted
at 22 German centres) and eventually identified MHV-patients (n = 137) with anticoagulation-associated ICH for
outcome analyses. The primary outcome consisted of major haemorrhagic complications analysed during hospital
stay according to treatment exposure (restarted TA vs. no-TA). Secondary outcomes comprised thromboembolic
complications, the composite outcome (haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications), timing of TA, and mor-
tality. Adjusted analyses involved propensity-score matching and multivariable cox-regressions to identify optimal
timing of TA. In 66/137 (48%) of patients TA was restarted, being associated with increased haemorrhagic
(TA = 17/66 (26%) vs. no-TA = 4/71 (6%); P < 0.01) and a trend to decreased thromboembolic complications
(TA = 1/66 (2%) vs. no-TA = 7/71 (10%); P = 0.06). Controlling treatment crossovers provided an incidence rate-
ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 10.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67–35.70; P < 0.01] in disadvantage of TA for haem-
orrhagic complications. Analyses of TA-timing displayed significant harm until Day 13 after ICH (HR 7.06, 95% CI
2.33–21.37; P < 0.01). The hazard for the composite—balancing both complications, was increased for restarted TA
until Day 6 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.10–5.70; P = 0.03).
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Restarting TA within less than 2 weeks after ICH in patients with MHV was associated with increased haemor-
rhagic
complications.
Optimal
weighing—between
least
risks
for
thromboembolic
and
haemorrhagic
complications—provided an earliest starting point of TA at Day 6, reserved only for patients at high thrombo-
embolic risk.

Intracerebral haemorrhage • Mechanical heart valve • Therapeutic anticoagulation
Introduction
Anticoagulation management in patients with acute intracerebral
haemorrhage (ICH) and mechanical heart valves (MHVs) who require
long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) represents a growing thera-
peutic dilemma.1–4 During the hyper-acute phase of ICH, altered co-
agulation needs to be normalized as soon as possible to stabilize the
haematoma,5,6 specifically by administering prothrombin complex
concentrates to reduce international normalized ratio (INR) levels at
least to less than 1.3.5,6 As a consequence of normalizing coagulation,
the risk for thromboembolism is increased, which is why anticoagula-
tion management in MHV-patients is intensely debated.7
International guidelines state that ‘early resumption of anticoagula-
tion may be necessary’, without providing specific recommendations
on safety and timing.8–11 This reflects an essential lack of randomized
trials or sufficiently-sized observational studies exploring the optimal
time-point for OAC re-initiation.9,11,12 Yet, a recent consensus state-
ment by the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on
Thrombosis suggested that anticoagulation with heparin may be
safely restarted 3 days after ICH and that vitamin-K antagonists
(VKAs) may be initiated at Day 7 without any major concerns for
bleeding complications.13 However, this conclusion was based on a
meta-analysis of small observational studies, the largest including on
52 MHV-patients of which 22 died.13,14 Hence, available analyses and
data quality seems inadequate to draw firm conclusions, notably as
none of the included studies was designed to investigate and compare
strategies of restarting anticoagulation.15
The present nation-wide multicentre study pooled individual data
of patients with OAC-associated ICH and MHV to investigate both
anticoagulation reversal and anticoagulation-resumption by providing
incidences of haemorrhagic vs. thromboembolic complications
among patients with and without restarted therapeutic anticoagula-
tion (TA). We aimed to establish an optimal time-window for restart-
ing TA in MHV-patients with acute ICH using time-dependent safety
and risk-benefit analyses.
Methods
Study design and participants
This observational cohort study represents a combined analysis of both
parts of the registered (‘geRman-widE mulTicenter Analysis of oRal
Anticoagulation
associated intraCerebral hEmorrhage’)
RETRACE-
program; Part-1 conducted from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010
(NCT01829581)5 and Part-2 from 1 January 2011 until 31 December
2015 (NCT03093233). We integrated pooled individual patient data of
2504 consecutive OAC-ICH patients treated at 22 tertiary-care centres
(Departments of Neurology) throughout Germany. We defined MHV-
patients by having a MHV (i.e. bi-leaflet, single-leaflet, tilting disc, or caged-
ball) in situ during occurrence of ICH and recorded valve positions (aortic,
mitral, or both).7 Patients with exclusively bioprosthetic valves were not

classified as MHV patients. In all patients with VKA-related ICH an effect-
ive intake was determined as INR-value equal or greater to 1.5 on hos-
pital admission. We excluded patients with secondary ICH aetiologies, as
previously described.5 For analyses of reversal management, we did not
consider patients with early care limitation (withhold or withdrawal of
therapy orders within 24h).5,16 For analyses of anticoagulation manage-
ment, we implemented a 72h ‘quarantine period’, as previously sug-
gested, to limit false positive attribution of treatment exposures with
outcomes.17 The study was approved by the local ethics committees and
institutional review boards based on the central vote from Friedrich-
Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany (Re.No-4409 &
30_16B). Individual consent was obtained from patients or legal represen-
tatives if not waived by local ethics committees.
Data acquisition
We assessed data on demographics, prior medical history, in-hospital
and imaging parameters, laboratory data and reversal management
(timing, doses, and agents used for reversal treatment) as previously
described.5 Pre-existing comorbidities comprised arterial hyperten-
sion, diabetes mellitus, abnormal kidney or liver function, prior myo-
cardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of stroke, and
antiplatelet medication, which were used to compute values for the
CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores. Clinical status on admission was ob-
tained using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) as noted in prospective
data bases, medical charts, and emergency protocols. Severity of
ICH was assessed using the most commonly used prognostic
Scale, i.e. ICH Score (higher scores indicating poorer outcome).16,18
Laboratory parameters on admission and serial coagulation param-
eters [activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), INR] were
recorded using institutional laboratory databases.
Diagnosis of ICH and imaging characteristics were determined on first-
available cranial imaging after onset of ICH. Intracerebral haemorrhage
volume was calculated using the ABC/2 and ABC/3 methods,19 haema-
toma growth was defined as greater 33% volume increase,20 and all serial
follow-up imaging during the complete hospital stay were evaluated for
detection of outcome measures in each patient.5 For analyses of reversal
management, we dichotomized patients into sufficiently (INR-level re-
versed to less than 1.3 within at least 4 h) or non-sufficiently reversed, as
previously established.5
Timing and mode of anticoagulation management during hospital stay
were categorized into (i) no-TA, i.e. either no antithrombotic medication
received during hospital stay or administration of heparins [unfractio-
nated heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH)] in prophylactic
dosing for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE)21 or into (ii)
TA, i.e. either restarted OAC using VKA (scored on first day with INR
levels>
_ 1.5), continuous intravenous or subcutaneous application of
unfractionated heparin (targeting a therapeutic range of 1.5-fold to 2.5-
fold aPTT prolongation) or full weight-adjusted dosing of LMWH (target-
ing 0.5 to 1.0 anti-Xa units/mL).1,8,22 Dichotomous treatment exposure
was classified according to the most aggressive anticoagulation therapy
received.
We addressed crossover between treatment groups by calculating in-
cidence rates per patient days for each day on specific treatment until the
occurrence of complications or discharge. Complications consisted of
intra- or extracranial haemorrhagic and thromboembolic events (details
see below), which were serially evaluated and corroborated by pertinent
medical charts, physicians’ letters, and imaging or echocardiography re-
ports review during the entire hospital stay.23 Complications were adjudi-
cated to treatment exposure (TA vs. no-TA), which was present at
the day of clinical diagnosis of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic
complications.
Investigated outcomes
Primary outcome
We defined major haemorrhagic complications as primary safety out-
come measure consisting of (i) any intracranial haemorrhage, i.e.
new ICH distant from the initial haematoma, any delayed haematoma en-
largement >33% occurring beyond the 72h quarantine period, and new
subarachnoid or sub-/epidural haemorrhage, as well as (ii) any major
extracranial haemorrhage, i.e. acute (<24h) reduction of serum haemo-
globin >
_3 g/dL, transfusion >
_2 units packed red blood cells, bleeding in
critical site (intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, articular, retroperitoneal),
or fatal bleeding according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
Type 3a or greater.23 Outcome measures in all patients were recorded
during the entire acute hospitalization period.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes included (i) thromboembolic complications, (ii) the
composite of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, (iii) tim-
ing of TA, and (iv) mortality and functional outcome at discharge and
Day 90. We defined thromboembolic complications as intracranial, i.e.
ischaemic stroke (scored upon serial follow-up imaging), or extracranial
thromboembolic complications,23 i.e. systemic embolism, myocardial in-
farction [ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI with
troponin elevation >99th percentile upper reference limit],24 valve
thrombosis (evaluated through routine echocardiography or computed
tomography), or symptomatic pulmonary embolism.25 Coincidence of
intra- and extracranial thromboembolic complications were scored as
intracranial, e.g. valve thrombosis with ischaemic stroke. We evaluated
timing of TA for both haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications
to establish associations with primary and secondary outcomes according
to the starting point of therapy after occurrence of ICH. We analysed
mortality and functional outcome at discharge and 90days after ICH using
the modified Rankin scale (mRS, higher scores indicating poorer out-
come)—categorized into favourable (mRS = 0–3) and unfavourable
(mRS= 4–6).26
Statistical analyses
We performed statistical analyses using the SPSS 21.0 software package
(www.spss.com) and R 2.12.0 (www.r-project.org). We conducted com-
plete case analysis as the maximum rate of missing values was less than
3% among all analysed parameters included into outcome analyses.
Statistical tests were two-sided and the significance level was set at
a = 0.05. Data distribution was evaluated using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test. Normally distributed data are presented as mean (±standard devi-
ation), compared using the Student’s t-test or univariate analysis of var-
iance
(ANOVA),
and
non-normally
distributed
data
as
median
(interquartile range), analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test or the
Kruskal–Wallis H-test. Frequency distribution of categorized variables
was compared using the Pearson’s v2 test or the Fisher’s exact test, re-
spectively the Freeman–Halton extension of the Fisher exact test for
trichotomous group comparisons. All univariate analyses and post hoc
tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm’s sequen-
tial Bonferroni procedure to minimize accumulation of type 1 errors.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate bias and confounding
of reversal- with anticoagulation-management as well as for the doses of
prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) with thromboembolic com-
plications by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses.
To account for potential confounding by indication, we additionally
performed propensity score matching using parallel, balanced, variable
ratio (1: many) nearest-neighbour approach at a calliper of 0.1.27 The pro-
pensity score was calculated using parameters showing differences for
inter-group comparisons, i.e. age, GCS, and haematoma volume.

We calculated crude incidence rates (CIRs) per 100 patient days on
each specific treatment for haemorrhagic complications, thrombo-
embolic complications, and the composite of both. We compared in-
cidence rates according to treatment exposure (with and without TA)
presented as conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimate of rate
ratios 95% confidence interval (CI) and compared CIR using the Mid-P
exact test. Analyses were censored after occurrence of aforemen-
tioned complications or patient death. Comparisons of CIR according
to treatment exposure were conducted for (i) the overall cohort,
(ii) the propensity score matched cohort, (iii) patients dichotomized
according to valve position (aortic vs. mitral or both, preceded by
CIR analyses based on valve position omitting treatment exposure),
and (iv) MVH-patients with present atrial fibrillation vs. sinus rhythm.
Timing of TA was analysed in relation to outcome complications using
stepwise-forward multivariable adjusted Cox regression modelling. We
calculated hazard ratio (HR) estimates for each day after ICH derived
from patient clusters (HR-estimate at the median of a 3 day interval, i.e.
HR-estimate at Day 4 calculated using the interval from Day 3 to 5) com-
paring patients that started TA vs. no-TA. HR estimates were weighted
and smoothed by the method of moving averages to correct for overesti-
mation. Analyses were adjusted for haemorrhagic and thromboembolic
risk (CHADS2 and HAS-BLED Scores) as well as for statistical imbalances
among baseline clinical characteristics (GCS, ICH volume). The primary
outcome—associations of TA with safety—was calculated using haemor-
rhagic complications as the dependent variable. The secondary outcome
constituted both complications as dependent variable. The significance
thresholds (intercept of the 5% CI with the HR of 1) allowed identifica-
tion of a time interval at which patients were at significantly increased risk
to experience the dependent outcome in relation to treatment exposure.
Dichotomous functional outcome and mortality analyses at hospital dis-
charge are presented for all patients receiving TA separately shown for
the identified time-intervals and for the overall cohort comparing patients
with TA vs. no-TA.
Results
Study analyses
Of 2504 OAC-ICH patients (see Supplementary material online,
Table S1) recruited among 22 tertiary care centres of the German
nationwide RETRACE I and II study programs, a total of 166 pa-
tients with MHVs were identified (Figure 1). At first, reversal man-
agement was investigated in 148 patients after exclusion of
18 patients that received early care limitations (<24 h) without
follow-up imaging. Secondly, analyses of anticoagulation manage-
ment were conducted in all patients who survived the first 72 h
leading to exclusion of another 11 patients (see Supplementary ma-
terial online, Table S2 for details on excluded patients). The remain-
ing 137 patients were grouped according to treatment exposure,
i.e. 71 patients received no-TA (16 patients received no antithrom-
botic treatment and 55 patients’ heparins for VTE-prophylaxis) and
66 patients received TA (13 patients with VKA and 53 patients with
unfractionated heparin or LMWH). All following analyses of antico-
agulation management were calculated dichotomously for TA vs.
no-TA as post hoc analyses (trichotomous inter-group comparison)

gested limited confounding (see Supplementary material online,
Tables S3 A and B and S4).
Analyses of reversal management
Sufficient INR-reversal (Table 1) was achieved in 37/148 (25.0%) of
patients and was associated with a significantly decreased rate of
haematoma enlargement [6/30 (20.0%) vs. 49/100 (49.0%); P < 0.01].
Reversal was mainly carried out using PCC 136/148 (91.9%).
Characteristics of patients sufficiently reversed revealed a poorer ad-
mission status [GCS: 9 (3–14) vs. 14 (10–15); P < 0.01], more fre-
quent intraventricular haemorrhage [23/37 (62.2%) vs. 40/111
(36.0%); P < 0.01], and increased initial ICH volumes [28.1 mL (14.8–
63.0) vs. 19.4mL (7.8–43.0); P = 0.05]. Overall, sensitivity analyses
provided neither signals that INR-reversal was associated with acute
(<72 h) or delayed (>
_72h) occurrence of thromboembolic compli-
cations, nor that the total cumulative dose of PCC given correlated
with an increased thromboembolic risk [area under the curve
(AUC): 0.67, 95% (0.49–0.87); P = 0.09]. These data suggested that
clinically less severely affected patients received less aggressive rever-
sal management and thus carry an increased risk to experience
haematoma enlargement (Table 1). Of note, the proportion of pa-
tients who were restarted on TA was not statistically different among
patients with vs. without sufficient reversal [16/37 (43.2%) vs. 53/111
(47.7%); P = 0.63, Table 1].
Analyses of anticoagulation management
Baseline characteristics (Table 2) of eligible patients (n = 137) showed
that patients who received TA were less severely affected by ICH
[i.e. smaller ICH volumes: 14.7 mL (6.0–38.1) vs. 23.9 mL (10.7-65.4)
P = 0.02; more favourable neurological status: GCS 14 (13–15) vs. 12
(5–15), P < 0.01; and decreased ICH severity: ICH-Score 1 (0–2) vs. 2
(1–3), P < 0.01]. The median length of hospital stay between
treatment groups was comparable [TA: 15 (9–25) days vs. no-TA:
13 (6–20) days; P = 0.07] and serial INR levels after acute reversal
management did not differ between TA and no-TA patients neither
before nor at the beginning of outcome assessment (Table 2).
Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes
We recorded a total of 21/137 (15.3%) haemorrhagic complications,
at a significantly increased rate in patients restarted on TA (17/66,
25.8%) compared to patients without TA (4/71, 5.6%; P = 0.001;
Figure 2, Table 3). We recorded a total of 8/137 (5.8%) thrombo-
embolic complications, revealing a trend towards reduced rates in
TA patients [1/66(1.5%) vs. 7/71 (9.9%) no-TA; P = 0.06].
Figure 2 provides a detailed overview of all complication character-
istics in relation to mode of treatment, valve position and mortality.
Of all 29 complications the majorities were intracranial (haemor-
rhagic complications: 16 intracranial, 5 extracranial; thromboembolic
complications: 6 intracranial, 2 extracranial). There were no signifi-
cant differences in baseline characteristics (see Supplementary mater-
ial online, Table S4) and no significant difference in the rate of
haemorrhagic complications during hospital stay among patients who
resumed TA using VKA vs. heparins [VKA: 3/13 (23.1%) vs. heparin:
14/53 (26.4%); P = 0.81].
Comprehensive analyses of the primary outcome (correcting for
treatment crossover; i.e. switching from prophylactic to therapeutic
dosing or vice versa) were conducted according to time spent on
each specific treatment and are presented as CIR per 100 patient
days (Table 3). In patients with TA, the CIR for haemorrhagic

 Figure 1 Study profile and numbers of participants. Individual level data of 2504 patients with anticoagulation-associated intracerebral haemor-
rhage were pooled and screened for the study. We identified 166 patients with mechanical heart valves in situ. For analysis of anticoagulation reversal,
we excluded 18 patients because of early treatment restriction without follow-up imaging. For analysis of anticoagulation resumption, because of the
predefined quarantine period of 72h, we excluded additional 11 patients with early (<72 h) in-hospital death. For outcome analyses, 137 mechanical
heart valve patients were eligible and were dichotomized into patients restarted on therapeutic anticoagulation vs. those without therapeutic anticoa-
gulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation consisted either of restarting vitamin-K antagonists (n = 13) or systemic heparinization (n = 53). We defined
major haemorrhagic complications as primary safety outcome measure consisting of (i) any intracranial haemorrhage, i.e. new intracerebral haemor-
rhage distant from the initial haematoma, any delayed haematoma enlargement >33% occurring beyond the 72h quarantine period, and new sub-
arachnoid or sub-/epidural haemorrhage, as well as (ii) any major extracranial hemorrhage [i.e. acute decrease (<24 h) in haemoglobin >
_3 g/dL,
transfusion >
_2 units packed red blood cells, bleeding in critical site: intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, articular, retroperitoneal, or fatal bleeding).
We defined thromboembolic complications as intracranial, i.e. ischaemic stroke (unrelated to intracranial interventions scored upon serial follow-up
imaging), or extracranial thromboembolic complications, i.e. systemic embolism, myocardial infarction (ST-elevated myocardial infarction and non-
ST-elevated myocardial infarction with troponin elevation >99th percentile upper reference limit), valve thrombosis (evaluated through routine
echocardiography or computed tomography), or symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Coincidence of intra- and extracranial thromboembolic compli-
cations were scored as intracranial, e.g. valve thrombosis with ischemic stroke. ICH, intracerebral haemorrhage; OAC, oral anticoagulation; VTE, ven-
ous thromboembolism.

complications was significantly increased (TA: CIR 3.53, 95% CI 2.05–
5.65 vs. no-TA: CIR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09–0.88) resulting in a significantly
increased CML incidence rate ratio (10.31, 95% CI 3.68–35.70;
P < 0.01). Sub-analyses of potential baseline confounders in patients
resumed on TA experiencing intracranial haemorrhagic complica-
tions did not provide significant differences (see Supplementary ma-
terial online, Table S5). Comparing the CIRs between VKA (CIR 5.36,
95% CI 1.08–15.6) and heparin-treated patients (CIR 3.29, 95% CI
1.79–5.51) did not provide significant associations with increased
haemorrhagic complications with one or the other treatment (CML
incidence rate ratio 1.63, 95% CI 0.38–5.26; P = 0.12).
The CIR per 100 patient days for the occurrence of thrombo-
embolic complications (Table 3) were not significantly different be-
tween both (TA vs. no-TA) treatment groups (CML incidence rate
ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.02–2.24; P= 0.34). For the composite outcome of
haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, the CIR per 100 pa-
tient days showed a significantly increased rate in patients receiving TA
(TA: CIR 3.73, 95% CI 2.21–5.90 vs. no-TA: CIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.47–
1.68; CML incidence rate ratio 3.97, 95% CI 1.88–8.69; P< 0.01).
To establish that these findings were not confounded by differ-
ences in baseline characteristics (Table 2), we performed a propensity
score matching to balance inter-group differences (see Supplemen-
tary material online, Table S6). Analyses of primary and secondary
outcomes in the propensity score matched cohort verified that the
CIR per 100 patient days for haemorrhagic complications (CML inci-
dence rate ratio 8.02, 95% CI 2.73–28.54; P < 0.01), and for the com-
posite of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications (CML
incidence rate ratio 3.14, 95% CI 1.41–7.12; P < 0.01), were signifi-
cantly increased in disadvantage of patients receiving TA (see Supple-
mentary material online, Table S7).
Timing of therapeutic anticoagulation after intracerebral
haemorrhage
Patients with TA that experienced a haemorrhagic complication re-
started TA significantly earlier than patients without a haemorrhagic
complication [median of 3 (2–10) days after ICH vs. median of
8 (5–19) days after ICH; P < 0.01]. Timing of TA was not significantly
different (P = 0.10) among patients restarting VKA [7 (4–30) days] vs.
heparin [3 (2–10) days]. In all patients who received continuous intra-
venous unfractionated heparin, aPTT levels were within the targeted
therapeutic
range
within
72h
after
heparin
initiation
(see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
We calculated adjusted Cox regression analyses to explore the as-
sociations of re-initiating TA—detailed assessment of timing for each
day after ICH during the period of hospital stay—with haemorrhagic
and thromboembolic complications (Figure 3). Regarding the primary
outcome, re-initiation of TA was associated with a significantly
increased hazard ratio for haemorrhagic complications until 13days
after ICH (HR 7.06, 95% CI 2.33–21.37; P < 0.01), whereas TA initi-
ated >
_14days after ICH until hospital discharge was no longer signifi-
cantly related to haemorrhagic complications (HR 1.50, 95% CI 0.17–
13.32; P = 0.71) (Figure 3A). We investigated the clinical relevance of
this association by comparing patients with TA initiated >
_14days
after ICH to patients with earlier TA (Figure 3D). This analysis demon-
strated a statistical trend towards a reduced discharge mortality rate
in patients who received TA >
_14days [mortality: 0/16 (0%) vs. 12/53
(22.6%); P = 0.055], yet without influence on functional outcome at
discharge [mRS = 0–3: 2/16 (12.5%) vs. 14/53 (26.4%); P = 0.33].
Balancing haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications ac-
cording to timing of re-initiated TA, there was a significant association
with an increased hazard ratio for the composite outcome until
5days after incident ICH (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.10–5.70; P = 0.03),
whereas TA started >
_6 days after ICH until hospital discharge was no
longer significantly related to the composite of haemorrhagic and
thromboembolic complications (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39–3.38;
P = 0.80; Figure 3B). To investigate the clinical significance of this asso-
ciation we compared patients started on TA >
_6 days after ICH to pa-
tients with earlier TA (Figure 3C). This analysis demonstrated a trend
towards a reduced discharge mortality [mortality: 2/30 (6.7%) vs. 10/
39 (25.6%); P = 0.055]. No difference was observed regarding func-
tional outcome [mRS = 0–3: 7/30 (23.3%) vs. 9/39 (23.0%); P = 1].

occurred in 29 patients with mechanical heart valves, dichotomized according to treatment exposure (therapeutic anticoagulation shown dark grey
bars, no therapeutic anticoagulation shown as light grey bars). Complications were adjudicated according to anticoagulation treatment present imme-
diately prior to clinical occurrence or diagnosis of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. The mechanical valve position is indicated by
‘A’, ‘M’, ‘B’, either ‘aortic’, ‘mitral’, or ‘both’. The time-point of occurrence and the type of complication is depicted by coloured arrows (haemorrhagic
shown as red, thromboembolic as blue). The classification of complications as intra- or extracranial is shown at the right hand side, ‘I’, intracranial and
‘E’, extracranial. The cross indicates the time-point of in-hospital mortality. The length of hospital stay after the censoring complication is depicted as

P = 0.71], or the composite endpoint (see Supplementary material
online, Table S8). Analyses of patients with different valve position ac-
cording to treatment exposure (see Supplementary material online,
Table S9) did also not provide significant differences; i.e. thrombo-
embolic complications without TA compared between valve pos-
itions [aortic valve: 6/51 (11.7%) vs. mitral valve or both: 1/20 (5.0%);
P = 0.66; CML incidence rate ratio 2.65, 95% CI 0.39–61.34; P = 0.39].
Sub-analyses of mechanical heart valve
patients with atrial fibrillation vs. sinus
rhythm
Analyses of MHV-patients in sinus rhythm vs. atrial fibrillation (see
Supplementary material online, Table S10) showed that MHV patients
with concomitant atrial fibrillation were at increased risk for both
haemorrhagic (CML incidence rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.16–0.96;
P = 0.04) and thromboembolic complications (CML incidence rate
ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.07–1.29; P = 0.09). Thus, the composite outcome
was significantly increased in MHV-patients with atrial fibrillation
[sinus rhythm: 16/99 (16.1%) vs. atrial fibrillation: 13/38 (34.2%);
P = 0.02]. Evaluating the associations of heart rhythm and treatment
exposure (see Supplementary material online, Table S11); comparing
patients with sinus rhythm vs. atrial fibrillation restarted on TA
showed no difference regarding haemorrhagic complications (CML
incidence rate ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.20–1.58; P = 0.24). Patients with
concomitant atrial fibrillation not restarted on TA during hospital
stay showed an increased incidence for thromboembolic complica-
tions (1.53, 95% CI 0.41–3.91 vs. 0.33, 95% CI 0.07–0.97) resulting in
an CML incidence rate ratio (0.22, 95% CI 0.04–1.05; P = 0.06).
Therefore, the composite outcome in MHV-patients with atrial fibril-
lation not restarted on TA was significantly increased [sinus rhythm:
4/50 (8.0%) vs. atrial fibrillation: 7/21 (33.3%); P = 0.01].
Discussion
To our knowledge this study represents the largest analysis of pa-
tients with acute parenchymal ICH related to the intake of vitamin-
K-antagonists in the presence of MHV. Regarding reversal manage-
ment, our results showed that sufficient INR-reversal with PCC was
associated with decreased haematoma enlargement without increas-
ing thromboembolic events. Analyses of anticoagulation strategies
demonstrated that early re-initiation of TA was associated with
increased rates of haemorrhagic complications until 13days after ini-
tial ICH and with respect to safety should not be routinely restarted
before 14days. Thromboembolic complications occurred notably in
patients without TA, however at a significantly lower incidence rate
than haemorrhagic complications under TA. Therefore, concerning
the composite of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications,
our findings suggest that TA should not be reinitiated earlier than
6days after initial ICH and may be considered thereafter only in high-
risk patients to optimally balance between least haemorrhagic and
thromboembolic complications (see take home figure). Several as-
pects need discussion.
First, regarding reversal management, in contrast to primary ICH
haematoma enlargement is known to occur more frequently and pro-
tracted in OAC-ICH.28,29 This may be explained by the altered coagula-
tion not completely or not sustainably normalized after initial reversal
treatment.28,29 As recently demonstrated, elevated INR levels need to
be rapidly and fully reversed using PCC to stabilize the haematoma.5,6
The present analysis verified that patients not completely reversed
were at higher risks to experience haematoma enlargement. This aspect
is of specific relevance as clinically less severely affected patients under-
went less aggressive reversal management which—contrary to the in-
tended effect—resulted in poorer outcome. In addition, we here
demonstrated that completely reversed patients were not at risk for

 Figure 3 Timing of therapeutic anticoagulation and clinical outcome. Adjusted cox proportional hazard models were used to visualize the associ-
ation between the day of restarting therapeutic anticoagulation after intracerebral haemorrhage and (A) haemorrhagic complications and (B) the
composite of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications during hospital stay. Patients were dichotomized according to treatment exposure
(therapeutic anticoagulation vs. no therapeutic anticoagulation) and sequentially included into analyses at the day therapeutic anticoagulation was re-
started. Specifically, we calculated hazard ratio estimates (y-axis) for both outcomes at each day after intracerebral haemorrhage using time-patient-
clusters (3 day intervals) of patients that restarted therapeutic anticoagulation at a median of the presented day on the x-axis, and compared these
with patients without therapeutic anticoagulation with available datapoints within these time-patient-clusters. Hazard ratio estimates were weighted
and smoothed by the method of moving averages to correct for overestimation. ’Patients at risk‘ represents the number of individuals with attributed
treatment exposure (either therapeutic anticoagulation or no therapeutic anticoagulation) at that specific day post-intracerebral haemorrhage.
Stepwise-forward Cox proportional hazard modelling was adjusted for haemorrhagic and thromboembolic risk (CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores) as
well as for statistical imbalances among baseline characteristics (Glasgow Coma Scale, intracerebral haemorrhage volume). The thick lines (red for
haemorrhagic complications, blue for the composite of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications) represent the hazard ratio estimates gen-
erated for every single day after intracerebral haemorrhage; the thin lines with shaded area indicate the 95% confidence intervals. The distribution of
mortality and functional outcome (C and D) at discharge is displayed using the modified Rankin Scale. Analyses of in-hospital mortality and functional
outcome at discharge in patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation (including three patients who died before 72 h but were restarted on
therapeutic anticoagulation before) is displayed as dichotomized comparison at the identified time-threshold for (D) haemorrhagic complications and
for the (C) composite of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. Each score on the modified Rankin Scale is separated by dashed lines.
Thick lines separate the proportion of patients with favourable (modified Rankin Scale 0–3) and unfavourable (modified Rankin Scale 4–6) outcome
as well as patients with and without in-hospital mortality. HR, hazard ratio; ICH, intracerebral haemorrhage.

increased ischaemic complications, which argues in favour of an immedi-
ate and complete anticoagulation reversal in all OAC-ICH patients—
including those with MHV.5,6
Second, regarding anticoagulation resumption, what seems to be
causative for the observed high incidence rates (>3.5% per day) of
haemorrhagic complications in patients with early TA and OAC-
ICH? In OAC-ICH the stability of the haematoma may be less defini-
tive, which is why early anticoagulation may counterbalance the intra-
cranial tamponade effect leading to an increased rate of delayed
intracerebral bleeding complications.30 In addition, meta-analyses and
large trials in ischaemic stroke patients have previously established
that heparin at dosages greater than 5000 IU twice daily cause an
overall increase of haemorrhagic complications within the first
14days.31,32 Moreover, in the updated Cochrane review which inte-
grates data of over 20 000 ischaemic stroke patients early anticoagu-
lation (<14days) compared with aspirin, showed a greater risk for
both extracranial and intracranial haemorrhages.31 These aspects
highlight the negative safety profile of early anticoagulation even in is-
chaemic stroke patients.
The risk of thromboembolic complications in MHV-patients is
feared and intuitively considered higher than what is actually known
from previous investigations why treating physicians tend to restart
anticoagulation early.7,15,33–35 The acute risk for valve thrombosis or
thromboembolism even in timely anticoagulated patients amounts up
to 1% per day for valve thrombosis and 0.2% per day for systemic
thromboembolisms including ischaemic stroke and is greatest imme-
diately after surgical implantation.36,37 In line with these data, we here
noticed a thromboembolism rate of 0.2% per day in anticoagulated
patients, and in patients without anticoagulation there was a rather
modestly increased rate of 0.6% per day. Now, comparing incidence
rates of haemorrhagic complications we documented a 10 times
higher hazard with early anticoagulation. Hypothetically translated,
this would result in a number needed to harm of 31 patients per day
to experience a haemorrhagic complication if anticoagulated vs. a
number need to harm of 256 patients per day to experience a
thromboembolic complications if not anticoagulated. Hence, these
findings argue against aggressive early anticoagulation and it seems ac-
ceptable to withhold that treatment in the acute phase of ICH in
order to avoid severe bleeding complications.
Current investigations regarding the optimal time-point of OAC-
resumption focused on ICH patients with atrial fibrillation, and al-
though there are various observational studies and meta-analyses
showing a benefit for OAC-re-initiation on the long-term, it is still
uncertain when to restart OAC.5,38–40 A recent large-sized registry
study suggested an optimal time-point for resumption of 7–8 weeks
in patients with atrial fibrillation.40 This timeframe however appears
not to meet the specific demands of MHV-patients. In this special
subset of ICH patients no larger study and no treatment recom-
mendation, neither in cardiologic nor neurological international
guidelines, exists.8,10,11,41 A recent short report suggested an opti-
mal time frame for anticoagulation resumption between 7 and
10 days after ICH, but needs to be interpreted with caution as this
retrospective clinical database query (1996–2011) did not address
ICH characteristics, reversal management (era before PCC avail-
ability in USA), and specific modes of anticoagulation strategies fur-
ther lacking statistical adjustments for confounding and bias.42
Contrary to OAC resumption in ICH-patients with atrial fibrillation
(NCT02830152, NCT02565693), it seems very unlikely that
randomized trials for MHV-patients in the short or long-term fu-
ture will be conducted. This multicentre nation-wide study pro-
vides the most robust basis to date facilitating routine management
and further research in this field. We suggest to reinitiate TA not
before Day 6 after ICH, however to restrict this treatment strategy
to high-risk MHV-patients (e.g. MHV-patients with concomitant
atrial fibrillation, mitral valve prosthesis, or cage-ball prosthesis,
etc.). In general, given that the hazard ratio for both complications
(composite outcome), similar to the significance level for haemor-
rhagic complications only, remained
in disfavour of early

anticoagulation until Day 15, we suggest restarting anticoagulation
not before 2 weeks to balance between thromboembolic and
haemorrhagic complications in the gross of MHV-patients.
Several limitations need to be discussed. First, the observational
and retrospective nature infers the potential for bias by indication
and ICH-severity. Blinding or randomization was not feasible and may
have led to a favoured assignment of TA in patients with a more fa-
vourable prognosis. Routine clinical management was executed at
each individual centre, yet equally timed and standardized diagnostics
(cranial or cardiac computed tomography, or cardiac sonography,
etc.) were not conducted possibly underscoring evaluated outcomes.
Yet, due to this apparent limitation in relation to study design, we
focused specifically on safety as primary outcome and believe that
false negative attribution of major haemorrhagic complications re-
mains rather low. Although sophisticated statistical tools have been
applied aimed at controlling confounding, centre effects cannot be
fully excluded. Further, the number of MHV-patients and outcome
events may have been too small to detect minor statistical differences
in sub-analyses to fully refute type two errors.
Conclusion
In summary, restarting TA within 2 weeks after ICH in patients
with MHV was associated with increased haemorrhagic complica-
tions. Optimal weighing—between least risks for thrombo-
embolic and haemorrhagic complications—provided an earliest
starting point of TA at Day 6, reserved only for patients at high
thromboembolic risk.
