Abstract: In this study, we investigated the impact of scientific publications of the Italian 
SIMPAR (Study In Multidisciplinary PAin Research) group by using altmetrics, defined as 
nontraditional metrics constituting an alternative to more traditional citation-impact metrics, such 
as impact factor and H-index. By correlating traditional and alternative metrics, we attempted 
to verify whether publications by the SIMPAR group collectively had more impact than those 
performed by its individual members, either in solo publications or in publications coauthored 
by non-SIMPAR group investigators (which for the purpose of this study we will refer to as 
“individual publications”). For all the 12 members of the group analyzed (pain therapists, biolo-
gists, and pharmacologists), we created Open Researcher and Contributor ID and Impact Story 
accounts, and synchronized these data. Manually, we calculated the level metrics for each article 
by dividing the data obtained from the research community by those obtained from the public 
community. We analyzed 759 articles, 18 of which were published by the SIMPAR group. Alt-
metrics demonstrated that SIMPAR group publications were more likely to be saved (77.8% vs 
45.9%), discussed (61.1% vs 1.1%, P<0.0001), and publicly viewed (11.1% vs 1.3%, P=0.05) 
than individual publications. These results support the importance of multidisciplinary research 
groups in the impact of scientific literature; the interaction and synergy among the research 
participants allowed the obtainment of high impact-literature in the field of personalized pain 
medicine. Finally, our findings demonstrate the potential of altmetrics in estimating the value 
of the research products of a group.

Introduction
Altmetrics creates a new approach to evaluating the impact of publications by con-
sidering the number of downloads, shares, and discussions on social networks.1 This 
approach does not replace the traditional bibliometric indicators, such as Impact Fac-
tor and H-index, but rather focuses on new aspects of publication impact.2 Although 
still in its infancy, altmetrics has the potential to become a valid assessment strategy 
for the evaluation of publication impact.3 Altmetric tools capture information through 
the use of metrics from HTML views and downloads of articles, blog posts, tweets, 
bookmarks, etc. All of these sources are alternative indicators of impact that go beyond 
traditional citation, focusing on the content and uses of the social web,4 with this 
information provided in real time. Altmetrics elucidate not only the impact of scien-
tific research by researchers but also the impact of the research on the public through 
social media.2,5 In fact, through altmetrics, the impact of research can be measured

at the individual-article level, using a combination of such 
data as the number of times that a particular paper has been 
downloaded, discussed, shared, and cited.6 This approach 
allows not only researchers but also institutions to analyze 
postpublication activity around a paper in near-real time using 
various online resources.5
To use this new tool, we focused on the Italian research-
ers of the SIMPAR group, which was founded in Pavia in 
2007. This group has rapidly become an eminent transla-
tional group in the pain field, with its annual meeting now 
considered a major international pain conference (www.
simpar.eu). In addition to the authors of this study, the 
other nine members of the SIMPAR group are Drs Marco 
Baciarello, Dario Bugada, Christian Compagnone, Andrea 
Fanelli, Stefano Govoni, Maurizio Marchesini, Cristina E 
Minella, Carolina Muscoli, and William Raffaeli. SIM-
PAR’s multidisciplinary collaboration has included several 
professionals of different disciplines and has produced 
a number of publications on the personalization of pain 
therapy through a multidisciplinary approach, including 
traditional medical, genetic, epigenetic, and “omic” dis-
ciplines. Table S1 lists each of the 18 papers published by 
at least two SIMPAR members in collaboration between 
2010 and 2015. As described herein, we have been able to 
obtain statistically significant results regarding the force 
of the group as a whole in both the research and public 
communities.
Materials and methods
For each of the 12 researchers of which our team is com-
prised, we created an ORCID (Open Researcher and Con-
tributor ID) account (www.orcid.org), in addition to an 
Impact Story (https://impactstory.org) account that imported 
our data and synchronized it with the unique ORCID identi-
fiers. Collected items were assigned to specific categories, 
such as “cited” (or highly cited), “saved” (or highly saved), 
or “discussed”. In doing so, our Impact Story provided 
us with data regarding the number of times an article was 
saved by scholars, cited by other researchers, publicly 
discussed (Facebook, etc), and cited by the general public 
(blog posts, Wikipedia). These metrics were classified along 
two dimensions: audience (scholars or the public) and type 
of engagement with the online research products (viewed, 
discussed, saved, cited).7 From Impact Story, we were able 
to retrieve all altmetrics data for the 12 researcher accounts 
(paper citations, discussions, views by the research com-
munity or public).
Statistical analysis
Through the personal profiles of altmetrics, for each mem-
ber of the SIMPAR group, we were able to count the number 
of citations, times a paper was saved, and discussions from 
the public community for each paper published. Then, we 
compared the SIMPAR group percentages of articles cited 
(or highly cited), saved (or highly saved), or discussed 
relative to those published by single authors (either writ-
ten alone or in collaboration with coauthors who were not 
members of the SIMPAR group) by means of Fisher’s exact 
test. Quantitative variables are described as median and 
interquartile range (IQR), ie, the 25th and 75th percentiles 
and compared to collective SIMPAR data or individual pub-
lication articles by means of a nonparametric Mann–Whit-
ney test. The association between citations from Scopus 
and the altmetric score or its components (eg, Facebook 
posts, tweets, Mendeley readers) was expressed through 
a nonparametric Spearman’s r-correlation coefficient. A 
P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All 
analyses were performed utilizing Stata 14 (Statacorp LP
, 
College Station, TX, USA).
Results
We analyzed 169 articles, 18 of which were SIMPAR 
group publications. The median number of articles by 
the authors was 17 (IQR 10–27), and the median year 
of publication was 2013 (IQR 2011–2014). Altmetrics 
demonstrated that SIMPAR group publications were more 
likely to be saved (78% vs 53%, P=0.05) and publicly 
discussed (61% vs 4%, P<0.0001) than individual pub-
lications. However, no significant difference emerged 
between the SIMPAR group publications and individual 
publications in terms of being cited (cited 44% vs 36%, 
highly cited 22 vs 11%; P=0.20) and publicly viewed 
(11% vs 3%, P=0.25). Notably, eleven of 18 articles pub-
lished collectively by the SIMPAR group received a tweet 
(median 1, IQR 1–3), while only 36 of 151 individual 
publications received a tweet. Moreover, 15 articles from 
the SIMPAR group collectively were accessed through 
Mendeley readers (median times accessed 4, IQR 1–11) 
versus 85 of the individual publications (median times 
accessed 2, IQR 0–8; P=0.01). We describe the correla-
tion between Scopus citations and the single components 
of the analyzed alternative metrics in Table 1. We found 
that the alternative metrics were generally low, with 
the exception of those for Mendeley readers (r=0.47, 
P<0.0001) (Figure 1).

Discussion and conclusion
We found significant correlations between the SIMPAR group 
collective publications and their impact on the indicator 
linked to research activity (Mendeley readers), although not 
to public discussion (such as Facebook and tweets). However, 
the impact of collective SIMPAR group articles was high also 
on general public items, even though it did not reach statisti-
cal significance. This is meaningful, as funders, universities, 
and publishers increasingly demand indicators of the impact 
of science on society.8
Moreover, we are confident that the new metrics of 
medical groups could have an impact on the pain-patient 
community as well. Through online platforms, such as Twit-
ter and Facebook, like-minded people can form their own 
communities to discuss their shared experiences, problems, 
and more.
Our results also illustrate how collaborative multi-
disciplinary teams and their projects improve the overall 
impact of researchers’ work on the researchers themselves. 
If collaborative efforts are more widely disseminated than 
individual publications, as our study suggests, such efforts 
can potentially provide additional exposure to group mem-
bers, which may result in greater career enhancement than 
individual publications. Through these avenues, research-
ers can leverage social media opportunities to their own 
professional and academic advantage.9 Enhanced exposure 
allows for the sharing of ideas and research among respec-
tive networks, spotlighting pain studies both nationally and 
internationally.
Finally, as the SIMPAR group take research ethics 
 
seriously, we opine that our collaborative approach is an 
ethical one as well as an effective one. Research resources 
are scarce, and becoming more so. Ways to increase the 
“yield” from biomedical research have been identified as an 
imperative.10 As our collaborative efforts have been demon-
strated to enhance access to meaningful, clinically relevant 
research results, our approach results in more “bang for the 
buck” by more readily disseminating useful information to 
practicing clinicians, as well as to other researchers inter-
ested in building upon the fund of data obtained through 
our investigations. Hopefully, other pain researchers will 
choose to follow our lead.
