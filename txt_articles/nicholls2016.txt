IMPORTANCE Reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with intensive
statin therapy reduces progression of coronary atherosclerosis in proportion to achieved
LDL-C levels. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors produce
incremental LDL-C lowering in statin-treated patients; however, the effects of these drugs on
coronary atherosclerosis have not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab on progression of
coronary atherosclerosis in statin-treated patients.
DESIGN,SETTING,ANDPARTICIPANTS TheGLAGOVmulticenter,double-blind,placebo-controlled,
randomized clinical trial (enrollment May 3, 2013, to January 12, 2015) conducted at 197
academic and community hospitals in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia,
and South Africa and enrolling 968 patients presenting for coronary angiography.
INTERVENTIONS Participants with angiographic coronary disease were randomized to receive
monthly evolocumab (420 mg) (n = 484) or placebo (n = 484) via subcutaneous injection for
76 weeks, in addition to statins.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy measure was the nominal change in
percent atheroma volume (PAV) from baseline to week 78, measured by serial intravascular
ultrasonography (IVUS) imaging. Secondary efficacy measures were nominal change in
normalized total atheroma volume (TAV) and percentage of patients demonstrating plaque
regression. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.
RESULTS Among the 968 treated patients (mean age, 59.8 years [SD, 9.2]; 269 [27.8%]
women; mean LDL-C level, 92.5 mg/dL [SD, 27.2]), 846 had evaluable imaging at follow-up.
Compared with placebo, the evolocumab group achieved lower mean, time-weighted LDL-C
levels (93.0 vs 36.6 mg/dL; difference, −56.5 mg/dL [95% CI, −59.7 to −53.4]; P < .001). The
primary efficacy parameter, PAV, increased 0.05% with placebo and decreased 0.95% with
evolocumab (difference, −1.0% [95% CI, −1.8% to −0.64%]; P < .001). The secondary efficacy
parameter, normalized TAV, decreased 0.9 mm3 with placebo and 5.8 mm3 with evolocumab
(difference, −4.9 mm3 [95% CI, −7.3 to −2.5]; P < .001). Evolocumab induced plaque
regression in a greater percentage of patients than placebo (64.3% vs 47.3%; difference,
17.0% [95% CI, 10.4% to 23.6%]; P < .001 for PAV and 61.5% vs 48.9%; difference, 12.5%
[95% CI, 5.9% to 19.2%]; P < .001 for TAV).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with angiographic coronary disease treated
with statins, addition of evolocumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a greater decrease
in PAV after 76 weeks of treatment. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of
PCSK9 inhibition on clinical outcomes.

educing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) with inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) is the corner-
stone of contemporary care for patients with atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease. Analysis of data within individual
statin trials and through meta-analyses suggests a consistent
relationship between achieving lower LDL-C levels and
reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events.1,2 In paral-
lel, trials using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) have studied
the effect of statins on coronary atherosclerosis and demon-
strated a linear relationship between achieved LDL-C levels
and reduction in atheroma burden.3-6 However, major clini-
cal outcome trials and IVUS studies have explored a range of
achieved LDL-C levels, extending to a mean of approximately
60 mg/dL.3,5
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) re-
duces LDL receptor recycling to the hepatic surface, thereby
limiting removal of LDL particles from the circulation.7-9
Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 reduce LDL-C
levels when administered alone or in combination with
statins.10,11 Initial studies have demonstrated the fea-
sibility of using the combination of statins and PCSK9 inhibi-
tors to achieve LDL-C levels much lower than achieved
previously.10,11 However, to our knowledge, no trials to date
have explored whether LDL-C lowering with a PCSK9 in-
hibitor reduces the rate of progression of coronary athero-
sclerosis, and no data exist assessing whether achieving very
low LDL-C levels via combination therapy results in incre-
mental benefits in reducing disease progression compared
with statins alone. The GLAGOV (Global Assessment of
Plaque Regression With a PCSK9 Antibody as Measured by
Intravascular Ultrasound) trial was designed to assess
whether PCSK9 inhibition reduces progression of atheroscle-
rosis as measured by IVUS.
Methods
Study Design
The GLAGOV trial was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-
controlled,randomizedclinicaltrial.Randomizationwasstrati-
fied according to geographic region. The trial was designed by
the Cleveland Clinic Coordinating Center for Clinical Re-
search (C5Research) in collaboration with the sponsor. Insti-
tutional review boards at each site approved the protocol, and
patients provided written informed consent. The study pro-
tocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement
1 and Supplement 2, respectively, and the design of the trial
has been described.12
Patients 18 years or older were eligible if they demon-
strated at least 1 epicardial coronary stenosis of 20% or
greater on clinically indicated coronary angiography and had
a target vessel suitable for imaging with 50% or less visual
obstruction. Patients were required to have been treated with
a stable statin dose for at least 4 weeks and to have an LDL-C
level of 80 mg/dL or higher or between 60 and 80 mg/dL
(to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259)
with 1 major or 3 minor cardiovascular risk factors. Major risk
factors included noncoronary atherosclerotic vascular dis-
ease, myocardial infarction or hospitalization for unstable
angina in the preceding 2 years, or type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Minor risk factors included current cigarette smoking, hyper-
tension, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
family history of premature coronary heart disease, high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level of 2 mg/L or
higher (to convert hsCRP values to nmol/L, multiply by
9.524), or age 50 years or older for men and 55 years or older
for women.
By design, patients with an entry LDL-C level between
60 and 80 mg/dL were limited to 25% of the total patient
cohort. A 4-week lipid stabilization period was included for
patients not currently taking lipid-modifying therapy at
screening. Inclusion of patients intolerant to statins was lim-
ited to 10% of the total cohort. Patients were excluded if they
had uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, heart failure,
renal dysfunction, or liver disease. Patients were asked to
identify race/ethnicity according to fixed categories deter-
mined by the study protocol, to evaluate potential differ-
ences in concomitant treatment and disease progression.
Patients underwent randomization in a 1:1 allocation
ratio with a block size of 4 using an interactive voice response
system to treatment with evolocumab (420 mg) or placebo
administered monthly via subcutaneous injection for 76
weeks. During the treatment period, patients underwent
clinic visits at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76 and repeat
IVUS imaging at week 78. A clinical events committee,
blinded to treatment assignment, adjudicated cardiovascular
events. An independent, unblinded data monitoring commit-
tee led by an academic cardiologist reviewed clinical trial
safety during the study.
Acquisition and Analysis of Ultrasound Images
After coronary angiography, baseline intravascular ultraso-
nography was performed. Previous reports have described
the methods of image acquisition and analysis.3,5,6,13-18
Imaging was performed in a single artery and screened by a
core laboratory. Patients meeting prespecified requirements
for image quality were eligible for randomization. At week
Key Points
Question Does treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor modify coronary
atherosclerosis disease progression?
Findings In this clinical trial in which 968 patients with coronary
disease were treated with the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab or
placebo monthly for 76 weeks and underwent serial intravascular
ultrasound determination of coronary atheroma volume, lower
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in the
evolocumab group (36.6 vs 93.0 mg/dL), which also was
associated with a reduction in percent atheroma volume for
evolocumab (−0.95%) but not placebo (+0.05%) and a greater
percentage of patients demonstrating plaque regression (64.3%
vs 47.3%).
Meaning Addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab to statin
therapy produced greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
lowering and atheroma regression.

78, patients underwent a second ultrasonographic examina-
tion within the same artery. Using digitized images, person-
nel unaware of treatment status performed measurements of
the lumen and external elastic membrane in images within
a matched artery segment. Measurement personnel were

The primary efficacy measure, percent atheroma volume
(PAV), was calculated using the following equation:
PAV = Σ(EEMarea − Lumenarea)/ΣEEMarea × 100,
where EEMarea is the cross-sectional area of the external elas-
tic membrane and Lumenarea is the cross-sectional area of the
lumen. The change in PAV was calculated as the PAV at 78
weeks minus the PAV at baseline. A secondary measure of
efficacy, normalized total atheroma volume (TAV), was calcu-
lated using the following equation:
TAVnormalized = (EEMarea − Lumenarea)/Number of Images in
Pullback × Median Number of Images in Cohort,
where the average plaque area in each image was multiplied
by the median number of images analyzed in the entire co-
hort to compensate for differences in segment length be-
tween patients. Change in normalized TAV was calculated as
the TAV at 78 weeks minus the TAV at baseline. Regression was
defined as any decrease in PAV or TAV from baseline.
Efficacy End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the nominal change in PAV
from baseline to week 78 as described above. Secondary effi-
cacy end points included, in sequential order of testing, nomi-
nal change in TAV from baseline to week 78 as described above
and the proportion of patients demonstrating any reduction
of PAV from baseline and any reduction of TAV from baseline.
Exploratory end points included the incidence of adjudi-
cated events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, myo-
cardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, coro-
nary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and
hospitalization for heart failure) and change in lipid param-
eters. Additional exploratory post hoc analyses included com-
parison of the change in PAV and percentage of patients un-
dergoing regression of PAV in those with an LDL-C level less
than or greater than 70 mg/dL at baseline. Locally weighted
polynomial regression (LOESS) curve fitting was performed to
examine the association between achieved LDL-C levels and
disease progression.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Inc). For continuous variables with an approximately nor-
mal distribution, means and standard deviations are re-
ported. For variables not normally distributed, medians and
interquartile ranges (IQRs) are reported. IVUS efficacy para-
meters are reported as least squares means (95% CIs) and treat-
ment groups compared using analysis of covariance on rank-
transformed data with adjustment for baseline value and
geographic region. On-treatment lipoprotein levels are re-
ported as time-weighted means (95% CIs) and compared using
analysis of covariance, with adjustment for treatment group
and geographic region. Time-weighted averages for each labo-
ratory parameter were created by the summation of the prod-
uct between each measurement and time interval between
each visit divided by the total time.
A step-down statistical approach was applied to investi-
gate the primary and secondary end points. First, the pri-
mary end point was tested at the .05 significance level, then
the secondary end points were tested at the .05 significance
level in the sequential order as listed in section 4.1.2 in the sta-
tistical analysis plan (Supplement 2). A sensitivity analysis
using multiple imputation was performed to impute missing
primary end point data. The imputation model included vari-
ables for treatment group, background statin therapy inten-
sity, region, baseline LDL-C level, baseline PAV, age, and sex

ascovariates.Subgroupanalysesontheprimaryendpointwere
conducted using subgroups specified in section 7.4 of the sta-
tisticalanalysisplan(Supplement2).Subgroup × treatmentin-
teractions were tested. An additional exploratory analysis was
conducted in patients with baseline LDL-C level less than or
greater than 70 mg/dL.
For the change in the primary efficacy parameter, PAV, a
sample size of 356 patients in each treatment group was re-
quired to provide 90% power at a 2-sided α of .05 to detect a
nominal treatment difference of 0.71%, assuming a 2.9% stan-
dard deviation. A difference of 0.5% has been previously re-
ported to distinguish patients who experience cardiovascu-
lar events from those who do not.19 Assuming a withdrawal
rate of 25%, 950 randomized patients were required.
All reported P values are 2-sided; P < .05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Patient Characteristics
The disposition of patients enrolled in the study is shown in
Figure 1. From May 3, 2013, to January 12, 2015, 968 patients
at 197 centers were randomized and received study drug, 484
to the evolocumab treatment group and 484 to the placebo
group. Eight hundred forty-six patients (87.2%) had evalu-
able IVUS imaging at both baseline and follow-up. Of these pa-
tients, 423 were in the placebo group and 423 in the evo-
locumabgroup.Meanexposuretostudydrugwas17.6months.
Table 1 reports the baseline characteristics of randomized pa-
tients. At the time of randomization, 58.9% were receiving
high-intensity statin therapy and 39.4% moderate-intensity
therapy,with1.4%ofpatientsnottreatedwithastatin.Atbase-
line, patients had a mean LDL-C level of 92.5 (SD, 27.2) mg/dL
and median hsCRP level of 1.6 (IQR, 0.8-3.4) mg/L. No signifi-
cant differences in these parameters were observed between
patients who had evaluable follow-up IVUS imaging and those
who did not (eTable 1 in Supplement 3).
Biochemical Measurements
Table 2 summarizes the baseline and on-treatment labora-
tory values for the 846 patients who underwent follow-up
IVUS imaging. During 76 weeks of treatment, time-weighted
mean LDL-C levels were 93.0 mg/dL in the placebo group and
36.6 mg/dL in the evolocumab group (P < .001), representing
a 0.2-mg/dL increase in the placebo group compared with a
56.3-mg/dL decrease in the evolocumab group (between-
group difference, −56.5 mg/dL [95% CI, −59.7 to −53.4];
P < .001) (Figure 2). Evolocumab-treated patients demon-
strated greater reductions in levels of apolipoprotein B (−40.3
vs 0.3 mg/dL; between-group difference, −40.6 mg/dL [95%
CI, −42.9 to −38.3]; P < .001), triglycerides (−10.9 vs
8.1 mg/dL; between-group difference, −19.1 mg/dL [95% CI,
−27.5 to −10.6]; P < .001) (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0113), and lipoprotein(a) (−7.8 vs −1.0 mg/dL; between-
group difference, −6.7 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −5.5]; P < .001)
(to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 0.0357) and greater
increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.3
vs 0.8 mg/dL; between-group difference, 2.5 mg/dL [95% CI,
1.7 to 3.4]; P < .001) (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0259). Median hsCRP levels during treatment were
1.4 mg/L (IQR, 0.7-3.0) in the placebo group and 1.4 mg/L
(IQR, 0.7-3.0) in the evolocumab group (P = .48).
Primary and Secondary IVUS End Points
Changes in IVUS measures of plaque burden are summarized
in Table 3. The primary efficacy measure, PAV, did not
change in the placebo group (0.05%, P = .78 compared with
baseline) and decreased by 0.95% in the evolocumab group
(P < .001 compared with baseline; between-group difference,
−1.0% [95% CI, −1.8% to −0.64%]; P < .001). The secondary
efficacy measure, TAV, did not change in the placebo group
(−0.9 mm3, P = .45 compared with baseline) and decreased
by 5.8 mm3 in the evolocumab group (P < .001 compared
with baseline; between-group difference, −4.9 mm3 [95% CI,
−7.3 to −2.5]; P < .001). More evolocumab-treated patients
exhibited PAV regression (64.3% vs 47.3%, P < .001) and TAV

regression (61.5% vs 48.9%, P < .001). For all prespecified
subgroups, there was no statistical evidence of interaction
(Figure 3; eTable 2 in Supplement 3). Specifically, there was
no difference in treatment effect observed in patients strati-
fied according to baseline LDL-C level. Imputation modeling
for patients who did not have evaluable IVUS imaging at
follow-up demonstrated similar findings, with a decrease in
PAV with placebo (−0.02%) and evolocumab (−1.05%)
(between-group difference, −1.03% [95% CI, −1.51% to
−0.55%]; P < .001).
Exploratory Post Hoc Analyses
In 144 patients with baseline LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL,
evolocumab treatment, compared with placebo, was associ-
ated with favorable effects on the change in PAV (−1.97% vs
−0.35%; between-group difference, −1.62% [95% CI, −2.50% to
−0.74%]; P < .001). In this subgroup, the percentage of pa-
tientswithregressionofPAVforevolocumabcomparedwithpla-
cebo was 81.2% vs 48.0% (between-group difference, 33.2%
[95% CI, 18.6% to 47.7%]; P < .001). A LOESS plot showed a lin-
ear relationship between achieved LDL-C level and PAV pro-
gression for LDL-C levels ranging from 110 mg/dL to as low as
20 mg/dL (Figure 4).
Exploratory Clinical Events and Laboratory Adverse Events
Table 4 describes centrally adjudicated clinical events, clini-
cal adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and reasons for
study discontinuation. Although the study was not powered
to assess effects on cardiovascular events, exploratory analy-
sis revealed numerically fewer adverse cardiovascular out-
comes (12.2% vs 15.3%), nonfatal myocardial infarctions (2.1%
vs 2.9%), and coronary revascularization procedures (10.3%
vs 13.6%) in the evolocumab vs placebo groups. Administra-
tion of evolocumab was well tolerated, with no significant ex-
cess in rate of injection site reactions (0.4% vs 0%), myalgia
(7.0% vs 5.8%), and neurocognitive events (1.4% vs 1.2%). The

evolocumab group showed a significant reduction in PAV
(−0.95%, P < .001), for a between-group difference of −1.01%
(P < .001). Similar results were observed for the principal sec-
ondary end point, TAV (between-group difference, −4.9mm3;

as any change in PAV or TAV less than zero. Using this defini-
tion, for the primary end point, PAV, approximately 47%
of patients in the placebo group experienced regression, com-
pared with 67% of the treatment group receiving the combi-
nation of a statin and PCSK9 inhibitor (between-group differ-
ence, 17.0%; P < .001). Similar results were observed for TAV,

therapy (between-group difference, 12.5%; P < .001). This is
the first clinical trial, to our knowledge, to show incremental
effects on regression in patients who had been treated with
moderate or intensive statin therapy prior to entry into the
study. It is also the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a
reduction in atherosclerotic disease progression by IVUS for a
nonstatin LDL-C–lowering therapy.
After demonstrating major clinical benefits in multiple
large outcomes trials,20-23 statins are considered essential
in global guidelines for managing the care of patients with
clinicallymanifestcoronaryheartdisease.24,25However,many
patients do not achieve optimal LDL-C reduction26 or experi-
ence cardiovascular events despite statin therapy.27 Further-
more, some patients report inability to tolerate full therapeu-
ticdosesofstatins.28InadequateLDL-Creductionandpresence
of high residual risk suggests that additional therapies will be
required to deliver maximally effective cardiovascular pre-
vention. PCSK9 regulation of hepatic LDL receptor expres-
sion has provided a potentially useful target for therapeutic
modulation to address residual cardiovascular risk in statin-
treated patients, particularly with the observation that PCSK9
levels rise in response to statin administration.29 In the cur-
rent trial, almost every patient was treated with a statin prior
to study entry, and addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor evo-
locumab provided incremental reduction in LDL-C levels and
atheroma volume.
Favorable effects were observed in the GLAGOV trial on
diseaseprogressionwithoutanincreaseintheincidenceofmy-
algias, elevations in hepatic transaminase levels, or new-
onset diabetes. However, the number of treated patients was
relatively small, and further safety assessments will require
analysis of large ongoing clinical outcome trials. Subcutane-
ous injections were well tolerated, with injection site reac-
tionsreportedinonly2evolocumab-treatedpatients,alowrate
of detection of antidrug antibodies, and no neutralizing anti-
bodies. These safety findings are consistent with prior obser-
vations showing no apparent excess in adverse events among
statin-treated patients achieving very low LDL-C levels.30
Subgroup analyses showed no heterogeneity in the favor-
able effects of PCSK9 inhibition on disease progression.
Regression with evolocumab was observed regardless of
baseline LDL-C levels. An LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL represents
the most stringent target level recommended by any global
guideline for cholesterol treatment.24,25 In patients with a
baseline LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL, post hoc analysis in
the current trial demonstrated regression in PAV in more
than 80% of patients with combination therapy. This obser-
vation is supportive of current treatment guidelines recom-
mending intensive lipid lowering in patients at high cardio-
vascular risk.24,25 While these findings are reassuring, it is
important to note that subgroup analyses cannot definitively
characterize the potential efficacy or harm of a novel treat-
ment strategy in distinct patient cohorts. At best, these analy-
ses can generate hypotheses requiring further validation in
prospective studies.
The definitive evidence supporting PCSK9 inhibitors as a
clinically effective therapeutic strategy relies on the ability of

these drugs to reduce cardiovascular adverse events. Prior re-
ports have demonstrated an association between both the bur-
denandrateofprogressionofcoronaryatherosclerosisandcar-
diovascularoutcomes.19,31Althoughthecurrentfindingsofthe
effect of evolocumab on disease progression are promising,
completion of ongoing large cardiovascular outcome trials of
PCSK9 inhibitors is needed to provide definitive information
on the efficacy and safety of these drugs.
Only approximately two-thirds of patients achieved ath-
eromaregression,despiteachievingverylowLDL-Clevelswith
evolocumab. However, the GLAGOV trial evaluated patients
after 18 months of treatment, a relatively short duration of
therapy in comparison with other recent studies of high-
intensity statin treatment that treated patients for 24 months.
It remains possible that a greater percentage of patients would
demonstrate regression at these low LDL-C levels with more
prolonged treatment. Nonetheless, the GLAGOV trial sug-
gests that there may be biological limitations on the percent-
age of patients who can achieve regression with highly effec-
tiveLDL-Cloweringandthatotherfactorscontributetodisease
progression in the remaining patients. Investigation of other
factors influencing disease progression in the setting of very
low achieved LDL-C levels could be useful in identifying novel
therapeutic targets.
This trial has several limitations. The study examined the
effects of PCSK9 inhibition on disease progression in patients
presenting for a clinically indicated coronary angiogram. It re-
mains unknown whether similar effects would be observed in
asymptomatic patients receiving statins for secondary pre-
vention. Although patient retention in this trial (87%) was bet-
ter than in previous IVUS studies, the results may have been
influenced by patients who did not complete the trial. We ad-
dressed this issue by imputing results for patients who did not
complete the trial, but imputation is not an entirely satisfac-
tory approach to missing data. The study focused on the role
of PCSK9 inhibition on atheroma volume but did not charac-
terize effects on atheroma morphology, which was investi-
gated in a prespecified substudy not yet analyzed.
Conclusions
Among patients with angiographic coronary artery disease
treated with statins, addition of subcutaneous evolocumab,
compared with placebo, resulted in a greater decrease in per-
cent atheroma volume after 76 weeks of treatment. Further
studies are needed to assess the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on
clinical outcomes.
