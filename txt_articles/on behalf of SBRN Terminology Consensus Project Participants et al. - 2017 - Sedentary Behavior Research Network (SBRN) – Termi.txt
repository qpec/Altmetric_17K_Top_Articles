Consensus Project Participants
Abstract
Background: The prominence of sedentary behavior research in health science has grown rapidly. With this growth
there is increasing urgency for clear, common and accepted terminology and definitions. Such standardization is
difficult to achieve, especially across multi-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, and industries. The Sedentary Behavior
Research Network (SBRN) undertook a Terminology Consensus Project to address this need.
Method: First, a literature review was completed to identify key terms in sedentary behavior research. These key terms
were then reviewed and modified by a Steering Committee formed by SBRN. Next, SBRN members were invited to
contribute to this project and interested participants reviewed and provided feedback on the proposed list of terms
and draft definitions through an online survey. Finally, a conceptual model and consensus definitions (including
caveats and examples for all age groups and functional abilities) were finalized based on the feedback received from
the 87 SBRN member participants who responded to the original invitation and survey.
Results: Consensus definitions for the terms physical inactivity, stationary behavior, sedentary behavior, standing,
screen time, non-screen-based sedentary time, sitting, reclining, lying, sedentary behavior pattern, as well as how the
terms bouts, breaks, and interruptions should be used in this context are provided.
Conclusion: It is hoped that the definitions resulting from this comprehensive, transparent, and broad-based
participatory process will result in standardized terminology that is widely supported and adopted, thereby advancing
future research, interventions, policies, and practices related to sedentary behaviors.
Keywords: Physical inactivity, Sedentary behavior, Stationary behavior, Standing, Screen time, Non-screen-based time,

Background
There has been rapid and progressive growth in research
studying sedentary time and sedentary behaviors [1–8].
Increasing evidence of the link between excessive seden-
tary behavior and adverse health indicators or outcomes
has perpetuated this interest [3, 5–7, 9–15]. The Ameri-
can Heart Association recently issued a science advisory
on sedentary behavior and cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality [16]. As this field of research has grown, so
too has confusion over the definition of sedentary behav-
ior (see Table 1 for a sample of definitions) and other re-
lated
terms
(e.g.,
screen
time,
sedentary
behavior
patterns, bouts, breaks) [4, 7, 17–22]. For example, Al-
tenburg and Chinapaw [17] recently recommended that
to advance the field of sedentary behavior epidemiology,
standardized procedures for accelerometer data collec-
tion and data reduction should be defined; standardized
operational definitions of sedentary bouts and breaks are
needed; sedentary bouts should be operationally defined
as a minimum period of uninterrupted sedentary time;
total time accumulated in sedentary bouts per day (or

 per week) should be calculated rather than using average
bout duration; and the best mathematical adjustment
that converts accelerometer data into sedentary patterns
should be further explored. The majority of sedentary
behavior self- and proxy-report questionnaires in the
published literature have not undergone psychometric
testing [10]. Of those that have undergone testing, a
small number have acceptable levels of reliability, al-
though the validity of most questionnaires is low [23].
Several other large-scale projects are currently underway
to produce a common taxonomy, harmonized measure-
ment protocols, consistent data reduction and analytic
procedures, and a framework for establishing research
priorities (Table 2). However, a collaborative global ini-
tiative to arrive at consensus definitions on key terms
has remained elusive.
In 2012, the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network
(SBRN; a network connecting sedentary behavior re-
searchers and health professionals from around the
world interested in sedentary behavior research [24])
published a letter proposing definitions aimed at clarify-
ing
differences
between
“sedentary
behaviour”
and
“physical inactivity” [25]. This clarification, authored by
52 SBRN members, achieved wide acceptance and was
published in English [25, 26] and was subsequently
translated and published in French [27], Portuguese and
Spanish [28]. There remains, however, a need for further
refinement and consensus on a variety of related and
emergent terms (e.g., screen time, standing, sitting, re-
clining), and it has become clear that some commonly
used terms are ill-suited for specific populations, such as
young children (e.g., before they can sit or stand), those
with chronic disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism), or those
with mobility impairment (e.g., where postural chal-
lenges with standing may represent light or moderate
physical activity). Furthermore, the standardized use of
key terms (e.g., sedentary behavior vs physical inactivity)
has had variable uptake across disciplines (e.g., behav-
ioral science vs exercise physiology) and medical subject
headings (MESH) continue to use physical inactivity
when sedentary behavior would be more appropriate.
Collectively,
these
issues
underscore
the
need
for
standardization of terminology, and for definitions that
have utility across all ages and physical abilities.
Building on previous work, the SBRN orchestrated a
comprehensive effort to further develop consensus defi-
nitions for terms related to sedentary behavior research,
for all age groups and for all physical abilities, through
engagement of its membership. The purpose of this
paper is to report on the process employed, conceptual
model created, and consensus definitions developed for
terms routinely used in research related to sedentary
behavior.
Methods
A series of sequential processes were employed in an ef-
fort to derive consensus definitions for key terms in sed-
entary
behavior
research
(Fig.
1).
These
processes
included i) a literature search, ii) establishment of a
Steering Committee of SBRN members, iii) invitation to
all SBRN members to participate in the consensus pro-
ject, iv) selecting a list of key terms, v) developing a

“A distinct class of behaviors characterized by low energy expenditure”.
[67]
“Sedentary behavior involves activities with a very low energy expenditure (1.0–1.8 metabolic equivalents [MET]), performed mainly in a
sitting or supine position”.
[68]
“Sedentary behavior refers to activities that do not increase energy expenditure substantially above the resting level and includes
activities such as sleeping, sitting, lying down, and watching television, and other forms of screen-based entertainment. Operationally,
sedentary behavior includes activities that involve energy expenditure at the level of 1.0–1.5 metabolic equivalent units (METs)”.
[4]
“Sedentary behaviors such TV viewing, computer use, or sitting in an automobile typically are in the energy-expenditure range of 1.0 to
1.5 METs (multiples of the basal metabolic rate). Thus, sedentary behaviors are those that involve sitting and low levels of energy
expenditure”.

expenditure in the range of 1.0–1.5 METs (multiples of the basal metabolic rate) and involve sitting during commuting, in the workplace
and the domestic environment, and during leisure”.

A literature search was performed in March 2016 to i)
review the current use of the SBRN [25] definition, and
potential deviations from this definition, and ii) examine
current operational definitions of sedentary behavior and
related terms (e.g., screen time, sedentary behavior pat-
terns, bouts and breaks) and any evidence of inconsist-
encies, differences, conflicts, or concerns over variations
in definitions employed. To identify current relevant ar-
ticles a search with filters capturing papers published in
the past 5 years (May 2011 to May 2016) was conducted
in PubMed (see Table 3 for search terms). The articles
were selected if there was mention of sedentary behavior

AlPHABET
The AlPHABET project is an open science project set up to develop a common taxonomy (naming and
cataloging system) for classification, harmonization and storage of objective tracking sensor data of
human physical behavior in daily life [71]. Development will be through an international consensus
process using the Delphi method. It aims to reach international consensus on an overarching definition
for the study of how activities, physical actions and movements as part of human daily behavior
impacts health and well-being; and on an integrated classification system, data model and nomencla-
ture. A brief description is available online [71].
International Society for the Measurement
of Physical Behavior
The International Society for the Measurement of Physical Behavior is a non-profit scientific society
which focuses on issues related to ambulatory monitoring, wearable monitors, movement sensors, phys-
ical activity, sedentary behavior, movement behavior, body postures, sleep and constructs related to
physical behaviors. It aims to promote and facilitate the study and applications of objective measure-
ment and quantification of free-living physical behavior using wearable devices. More information about
this society, its membership, actions or shared resources can be found on its website [72].
International Society for Physical Activity
and Health
The International Society for Physical Activity and Health (ISPAH) [73] has a mission to advance and
promote physical activity as a global health priority through excellence in research, education, capacity
building and advocacy. The ISPAH has recently launched a Sedentary Behavior Council [74] to
specifically focus on advancing science, advocacy, and practice related to sedentary behaviour.
Sensor Methods Collaboratory (National
Institutes of Health)
The Sensor Methods Collaboratory is an initiative created after a pre-conference workshop at the
3rd International Conference on Ambulatory Monitoring of Physical Activity and Movement (ICAM-
PAM) in June 2013 which was held to propose a collaborative approach to algorithm develop-
ment to interpret ambulatory monitoring of movement behaviours [75]. Researchers would benefit
if a commonly accepted approach to data reduction can ultimately be achieved. The collaboration
aims to provide an opportunity for the research community to discuss needs, develop shared re-
sources, propose standard protocols and metadata requirements, pilot new tools, and disseminate
methodological research for further evaluation or implementation. At this time, smaller working
groups are being formed to propose solutions to different issues (ethics and privacy; harmonizing
calibration protocols and data elements; hardware, software and data management logistics; and
evaluating evidence and comparison of analytic approaches) and efficient models for dissemin-
ation of the results of these deliberations will be explored [76].
Sedentary Behavior International Taxonomy
(SIT)
SIT is an open science project setup to develop a common taxonomy of sedentary behaviors through a
formal consensus process taking into account the opinion of experts and of the general public. The first
round of the Delphi method involved experts who were asked to make statements about the
taxonomy; its purpose and use; the domains, categories or facets that should be considered and
included; the structure/architecture to arrange and link these domains and facets has been reported
[77]. The SIT taxonomy aims to facilitate systematic and standardised investigation and analysis, to
enable systematic and standardised reporting, to facilitate comparison and meta-analysis and to facili-
tate development of measurement tools, sensors and outcome measures of sedentary behaviors. Contri-
butions from interested researchers remain welcomed; further information can be found online [78].
Sedentary Behaviour Research Network
(SBRN)
SBRN is a network of researchers and practitioners interested in the health-impact of sedentary behav-
iour. SBRN’s mission is to connect sedentary behaviour researchers and health professionals working in
all fields of study, and to disseminate this research to the academic community and to the public at
large. Further information can be found online [24].
Systems of Sedentary Behaviors (SOS)
Framework
The SOS-framework is an international transdisciplinary consensus framework developed for the study
of determinants, research priorities and policy on sedentary behavior across the life course [79]. A com-
prehensive concept mapping approach was used to develop this framework, involving an international
expert scientist working group which was recruited directly based on publication records in the field of
sedentary behavior research, their respective field of expertise and focus on specific stage of the life
course. The final framework consisted of six clusters of determinants: Physical Health and Wellbeing, So-
cial and Cultural Context, Built and Natural Environment, Psychology and Behavior, Politics and Econom-
ics, and Institutional and Home Settings. The framework can be used as a tool to prioritize future
research and to develop policies to reduce sedentary time.

with no regard to the population (e.g., child or adult;

articles including the aim of the study, defined/discussed

information.
In addition to gathering background information for
the project, the literature search allowed for the identifi-
cation of authors of key papers who were invited to form
a Steering Committee for the SBRN Terminology Con-
sensus Project (MST (Chair), TJS, VC, AEL, SFMC, TA,
MJMC and project management support from SA and
JDB from SBRN). Key terms from the literature search
were collated and the Steering Committee members
were asked to add or remove key terms from the list. A
final draft list of terms was agreed upon by this Commit-
tee. An email was sent to the SBRN membership, con-
sisting of researchers, scholars, practitioners, trainees
and students interested in sedentary behavior (1094
members worldwide in April, 2016), soliciting interest in
participating in the project and asking for suggestions
for key terms to be included in the survey.
The Steering Committee identified the most common
key terms reported and deliberated through a short sur-
vey and email communication to arrive at draft defini-
tions for each term, important caveats for certain age
and ability groups, examples to assist with interpretation
and, when available, references for the proposed defin-
ition. The final list of terms included stationary behavior,
sedentary behavior, standing, screen time, non-screen-
based
sedentary
time,
sitting,
reclining,
lying,
and
sedentary behavior pattern. This process also led to the
development of a conceptual model to help position the
key terms in relation to one another. The draft defini-
tions, caveats, examples, references, and conceptual
model were included in a survey developed for distribu-
tion to participating SBRN members. The survey asked
participants to assess the clarity of, and agreement with,
the conceptual model and proposed definitions (using a
five point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree),
while also providing an opportunity for general com-
ments. Consensus was determined a priori to have been
achieved if ≥75% of respondents strongly agreed or
somewhat agreed with a particular question (see Add-
itional file 1: for complete survey). Note that the term

 “physical inactivity” was not included in the survey be-
cause there were no suggested changes to the existing
SBRN [25] definition.
Input from all participants, including the Steering
Committee, was consolidated (by MST, SA, JDB) and re-
visions to the conceptual model, definitions, caveats, ex-
amples, and references were made by the Steering
Committee. The draft manuscript, including the revised
conceptual model and definitions, was sent to all partici-
pants for additional review and comments. After add-
itional revisions, a revised draft of the manuscript was
resent to all participants for comments, group consen-
sus, and assessment of likelihood of use. Finally, the fur-
ther revised manuscript (third review) was recirculated
to the project participant group for final comments and
sign-off for submission.
Results
Literature review
The literature search identified 997 articles, and after
screening for inclusion criteria, 14 were used for the
identification and definition of key terms in sedentary
behavior research. The definition of sedentary behavior
as “any waking behaviour characterized by an energy ex-
penditure ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining pos-
ture,” proposed by SBRN [25] was widely adopted as
evidenced by frequent citations (558 according to SCO-
PUS, March 20, 2017), though at least one article
claimed that there is still not a real consensus on the
definition [20]. Support for the SBRN definition was
found for adults [29] and children [21].
The SBRN definition has dual components, including
both energy expenditure and posture. The postural aspect
is easily operationalized and widely used to identify seden-
tary behavior using questionnaires, direct observation or
inclinometers, but tends to ignore the energetic compo-
nent. In contrast, the energetic aspect, often determined
by indirect calorimetry or accelerometry, has received
criticism in relation to its inability to discriminate between
postures. However, it should be noted that accelerometers
assess movement rather than energy expenditure, and
therefore at best represent an indirect method of assessing
energy expenditure in any population.
Mansoubi et al. [29] concluded that the 1.5 metabolic
equivalent (MET) intensity threshold used in the SBRN
definition of sedentary behavior was generally appropriate
for distinguishing between common sitting and standing
activities in healthy weight and obese adults; however,
some common sitting behaviors (e.g., typing) sometimes
have a MET level above this threshold. In a recent study
that compared MET-defined cut-points used to classify
sedentary behaviors in children aged 7–13 years in simu-
lated free-living conditions, it was reported that adult
MET thresholds may not be appropriate for children and
that the upper limit of the MET threshold for sedentary
behavior in children should be increased from 1.5 to 2.0
METs [22]. These authors suggested that a more precise,
age-specific definition of sedentary behavior in children
may improve overall physical activity (mis)classification in
the population and may be of value in quantifying the
health burden of sedentary behaviors in youth. In contrast,
using whole-room calorimetry as the criterion measure,
Reilly et al. [21] and others [30] concluded that the
current MET threshold recommendation of ≤1.5 METs
seems appropriate for young children (mean age of
5.3 years). Other research supports the inclusion of pos-
tural condition (“while in a sitting or reclining posture”) in
the sedentary behavior definition instead of just using a
definition based on energy cost (≤1.5 METs) [31, 32]. Des-
pite a few inconsistencies, in general, there was broad sup-
port in the published literature for the SBRN [25]
definition of sedentary behavior, at least in individuals
without mobility impairment.
The SBRN [25] definition has also been used for individ-
uals with mobility impairment, for example in studies of
people with multiple sclerosis [33–35] and community-
dwelling older adults (≥60 years of age) who self-reported
mobility impairments [36]. The cut-point of ≤1.5 METs
was accepted and used for these populations to distinguish
between sedentary behavior and light physical activity.
There is much debate concerning how to measure seden-
tary behavior with accelerometers in individuals with dif-
ferent mobility impairments. While the threshold of
≤100 cpm is the most commonly used cut-point [35],
Ezeugwu and colleagues [33] suggested that it may actu-
ally represent light intensity activity for some people with
mobility impairment and that there is still a need for fur-
ther research to determine appropriate accelerometer cut-
points among groups with different mobility impairments.
Altenburg and colleagues [18] examined the occur-
rence and duration of sedentary bouts, and explored the
cross-sectional associations of various operational defini-
tions of sedentary bouts with health indicators in chil-
dren. Their study highlighted the potential influence of
varying definitions of a sedentary bout or sedentary
break on their association with health indicators, and
provided support for the need for a consensus definition
of these terms. Altenburg and Chinapaw [17] discussed
and proposed definitions of sedentary bouts and breaks
in studies among children. They recommended that a
sedentary bout should be defined as a minimum period
of uninterrupted sedentary time, not allowing any “toler-
ance time” (e.g., time spent in non-sedentary behaviors).
They further recommended calculating the total time
spent in sedentary bouts (per day or per week) instead
of average bout duration and they proposed that a sed-
entary break be defined as a non-sedentary period in be-
tween
two
sedentary
bouts.

 associations between accelerometer-derived sedentary
bout length and cardiovascular disease risk factors using
the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey, Kim et al. [37] proposed that a threshold of 5 or
10 min be used to define a sedentary bout.
The literature search gathered evidence supporting, and
related to, the standardization, harmonization and consen-
sus initiatives summarized in Table 2. For example, several
articles highlighted the need for evidence-based and stan-
dardized accelerometer cut-points, data collection proto-
cols and data reduction procedures for assessing sedentary
time in children and adults [19, 38–43]. These are import-
ant areas for future work but beyond the scope of this Ter-
minology Consensus Project.
SBRN participant survey findings
The Terminology Consensus Project survey included an
overarching conceptual model and draft definitions of key
terms identified through the literature search and from
project participants. The complete survey (i.e., survey 3 in
Fig. 1) sent to respondents is provided in Additional file 1.
The survey was organized to be consistent with the hier-
archical structure of the conceptual model and the results
are presented in the order asked in the survey. Our initial
invitation to participate in the process was sent to all 1094
SBRN members. Of these, 390 SBRN members opened
the email (36%), 134 SBRN members (12% of total and
34% of those that opened the email) indicated interest,
and 87 (8% of total and 22% of those that opened the
email) completed the survey, including Steering Commit-
tee members (n = 9). Respondents were from 20 countries
and represented researchers, trainees, graduate students,
practitioners and government employees (see Termin-
ology Consensus Project Participant list below for specific
affiliations). Survey results regarding clarity and agree-
ment with the draft definitions, caveats and examples are
provided in Table 4. Levels of agreement with the pro-
posed conceptual model and all definitions, caveats and
examples were very high (i.e., average ≥ 92%, see Table 4),
indicating strong support overall, even before modifica-
tions were made to address survey feedback. One survey
respondent requested their name be removed as a project
participant because of disagreements with the paper con-
tent and two others because they felt they had not made a
sufficient contribution to warrant coauthorship. In each of
these cases the survey results were retained in analyses. In
the end, survey results for 87 participants are reported
while the manuscript has 84 Terminology Consensus Pro-
ject coauthors.
In addition to the closed-ended question results presented
in Table 4, survey respondents were given the opportunity
to provide written comments on all aspects of the consen-
sus project. A total of 420 comments from the respondents
were collected (see Fig. 2 for distribution of written
responses). With respect to the conceptual model circulated
in the survey (see Additional file 1), 17 respondents
expressed concerns about the amount of space allocated to
each type of activity (e.g., sleep, physical activity, stationary
time); and the use of colors. Six respondents commented
that it was unclear what time, bouts, interruptions and/or
breaks meant in the figure, and five suggested to move or
link standing still to the light physical activity section. Fi-
nally, four respondents had concerns about the title of the
figure because it contained “24-h movement behaviors” but
was including a lot of “non-movement behaviors”.
Concerning the definition and caveats for stationary
behavior bouts and breaks, seven respondents asked to
specify a minimum and a maximum amount of time for
a bout and/or break. Four respondents suggested organ-
izing the examples by presenting the most common
types of actions first and two asked to put standing still
in the light physical activity category. For the definitions
related to sedentary behavior, four respondents asked
again to specify duration of bout and/or break and three
suggested that we should use the interval of 1 to 1.5
METs, instead of ≤1.5 METs. The most recurrent feed-
back for the standing still section concerned the pro-
posed MET value (≤2.0 METs): six respondents thought
that it was too high, too low, or not adapted to everyone,
and two suggested adding the definition of 1 MET in
this section. Two respondents were against the use of
the term “standing still” given that one may be moving
weight from one leg to the other when standing, and
again, two suggested to put this definition in the light
physical activity section. Similar to the previous sections,
two respondents asked for a specific length of time for a
bout and/or break. Lastly, two criticized the inclusion of
“using a standing desk” as an example of standing still.
With regard to the definitions related to screen time,
there were a few comments about the examples used: six
respondents asked for and suggested more examples,
and three suggested specifically adding “video games” in
the examples. For non-screen-based sedentary time,
seven respondents also gave example suggestions, and
four asked for more consistency in the examples (con-
cerning the wording, the hierarchical organization and
the use of the “non-recreational/occupational” language
present in other sections).
Several relevant comments were made in the sections
concerning the proposed definitions for sitting, reclining
and lying. For the sitting definition, 15 respondents asked
for or suggested further clarifications and examples for ac-
tive sitting and five for its distinction with passive sitting.
Seven respondents also expressed concerns over the evi-
dence supporting the proposed MET-value, and five asked
to add specific examples for persons with disabilities, and
for infants and toddlers. Concerning the reclining defin-
ition, four respondents asked for or suggested more

Total sample size was 87 – not all respondents answered all survey questions so individual rows have varying “n”.
Other response categories had mostly empty cells as is evident from the very high prevalence of agreement. Complete data are available upon request

 examples, three said that reclining does not have to be “re-
laxed” or passive, and two wanted to state that body weight
is supported by some particular parts of the body (e.g.,
lower back, buttocks). Finally, for lying, seven respondents
suggested clarifying being asleep or being awake in the ca-
veats, three asked for or suggested examples (especially for
children) and two suggested to specify the distinction be-
tween active and passive lying, as it was done for sitting. Fi-
nally, concerning the sedentary behavior pattern definition
and caveats, 21 respondents asked for the definition of spe-
cific values, cut-points or details for the definitions of
breaker, prolonger, extended sitting bout, the distinction be-
tween long- and short-bouts, and frequent breaks.
After analysis of the qualitative and quantitative sur-
vey data, feedback from the participating SBRN mem-
bers was taken into account and several major edits
were made to the Figure and the definitions by the
Steering Committee. First, the conceptual model colors
were reorganized and an explanation was added stating
that the proportion of space is not representative of the
recommended time that should be spent in each behav-
ior category. The definitions were modified to ensure
all examples were organized in a consistent fashion,
with the most common examples occurring first; the
standing still term was changed to standing with clarifi-
cations of passive standing and active standing (both
stationary behaviors); and examples of active screen
time were added to the screen time definition. Changes
to definitions were recirculated to all Terminology
Consensus Project participants with the draft manu-
script and additional reviews and comments were re-
ceived. These reviews led to several additional minor
changes to definitions, caveats and examples. The
standing definition was significantly modified with a
clarification and examples of passive vs active standing
added. The operational definition of “MET” was also
added as a footnote to the Table 5 list of definitions. Fi-
nally, the conceptual model was further refined based
on comments received, removing the term “stationary
behavior” and rearranging the illustration to explicitly
present the dual components of energy expenditure
(inner ring) and posture (outer ring).
The further revised manuscript, table of definitions,
and conceptual model was recirculated to all partici-
pants for a final review and sign-off. In conjunction
with this final review, participants were also asked three
questions: 1. Do you agree that your view has been lis-
tened to and taken account during this process? (yes/
no) 2. Has your level of agreement/support for the con-
sensus definitions changed since you completed the
survey? (increased/decreased/no change) 3. Are you
likely to use the consensus definitions? (yes/no). Of the
84 final coauthors 100% answered “yes” to questions
one and three providing strong support for the partici-
patory
consensus
process.
For
question
two,
73%
responded “increased” and 27% responded “no change”,
no one responded decreased. With the already strong
support reported in response to the initial survey it is
reasonable to believe that the revisions made in re-
sponse to feedback received resulted in final definitions
and a conceptual model that has very strong support
from participants. Subjective comments received with
participant responses to the various reviews support
this observation.

MET = metabolic equivalent corresponding to resting metabolic rate of the population under study. A metabolic equivalent is deemed to be 3.5 ml O2/
kg/min in adults without mobility impairment or chronic disease. A metabolic equivalent is generally higher in children and in those with conditions
that elevate muscle activity or metabolism and is generally lower in those with paralysis, small muscle mass or wasting conditions. The interpretation of
MET values should be made with attention to the population under study, and the definitions and caveats above applied accordingly

 Final conceptual model and consensus definitions
The final conceptual model, presented in Fig. 3, illustrates
how the various terms fit together structurally and provides
support for the definitions included in this project. Final
consensus definitions for key terms (physical inactivity, sta-
tionary behavior, sedentary behavior, standing, screen time,
non-screen-based sedentary time, sitting, reclining, lying,
sedentary behavior pattern), caveats related to age and/or
ability differences, examples and related references are pro-
vided in Table 5. For the purpose of these consensus defini-
tions, the following age groups were used: Infants – ages
3 months to <1 year; Toddlers and preschoolers – ages 1 to
4 years; Children and youth – ages 5 to 17 years; Adults
and Older Adults – age ≥ 18 years. The age ranges for 1- to
4-year-olds and for children and youth are consistent with
those used in the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for
the Early Years and the Canadian 24-Hour Movement
Guidelines for Children and Youth respectively [44, 45].
Adults and Older Adults were grouped given that defini-
tions did not differ across the adult lifespan. The definitions
were developed with attention to being inclusive in lan-
guage and examples. Specifically, examples of interpreta-
tions of definitions for people with mobility impairment(s)
are provided where appropriate.
Discussion
In this paper we describe the processes and outcomes of
a comprehensive initiative to establish consensus defini-
tions for terms relevant to sedentary behavior research
and to develop a conceptual model to illustrate the hier-
archical structural connections among the various terms.
This Terminology Consensus Project had several novel
and progressive elements: it was informed by the best
available evidence; it built on the previous SBRN defin-
ition project [25] and other related initiatives (Table 2);
it leveraged the diverse membership base of SBRN using
an open participatory process; it significantly expanded
the scope of terminology covered compared to earlier ef-
forts; it developed a conceptual model to illustrate the
structural connections among the various terms; it was
observant of nuances for all age groups; it added exam-
ples to help interpret the terms; and it was attentive to
the interpretation and application of the terminology for
people with varying physical abilities. SBRN now has
1273 members from 35 countries (as of March 20, 2017)
representing all inhabited continents, of which 84 mem-
bers from 20 countries and multiple employment sectors
participated in all aspects of this project (see Termin-
ology Consensus Participants section below for details).
Fig. 3 Illustration of the final conceptual model of movement-based terminology arranged around a 24-h period. The figure organizes the
movements that take place throughout the day into two components: The inner ring represents the main behavior categories using
energy expenditure. The outer ring provides general categories using posture. Detailed definitions, caveats and examples related to
sedentary behavior are provided in Table 5. The proportion of space occupied by each behavior in this figure is not prescriptive of the
time that should be spent in these behaviors each day

 This project resulted in several notable advances in
terminology standardization in the field of sedentary be-
havior. For example, the addition of the term “lying” to
the widely used definition of sedentary behavior [25] fills
an obvious gap in the earlier definition. The introduction
of the term “stationary behavior” provides a behavioral
classification home for “standing”. The consensus defin-
ition suggests “passive standing” is a stationary, non-
sedentary behavior ≤2.0 METs and that “active standing”
is a stationary physical activity >2.0 METs (see Table 5
definitions for more details). Also, for clarity, researchers
can now use the term “stationary time” when reporting
data collected from an accelerometer that does not
measure posture. The consensus definitions add clarity
on the distinction between sedentary “behaviors” (with
context) and “time” at an established level of intensity
(absent of context, which includes most accelerometer
and inclinometer data) as well as a standardized ap-
proach for defining bouts and interruptions/breaks. Al-
though there is currently no consensus on a minimum
duration of a sedentary bout, the work of Kim et al. [37]
provide support for 10 min as a conservative sedentary
bout threshold. The applicability of these movement be-
haviors for individuals with mobility impairment was
also a distinct improvement.
The conceptual model, with clear definitions of ter-
minology related to sedentary behavior, provides clarity
for researchers interested in exploring the relationships
between, and among, the various movement behaviors
across the whole day (i.e., sleep, sedentary behaviors
and various intensities of physical activity) [44, 46] and
may facilitate future research exploring behavior substi-
tutions aimed to improve health [47]. Consensus defini-
tions, as presented here, were derived to assist with the
standardization, or at least harmonization, of measure-
ment procedures, data processing, and data analytics.
Ultimately, common definitions form the foundation
upon which related measurement decisions are based.
It is hoped that these consensus definitions will help fa-
cilitate standardization efforts, reduce confusion, and
advance initiatives and research related to sedentary
behavior.
There has been much debate around the appropriate
MET threshold to use when describing or characteriz-
ing sedentary behavior and standing. While there will
always be exceptions, the consensus definitions pro-
posed in this paper (sedentary behavior ≤1.5 METs,
passive standing ≤2.0 METs; Table 5) have a broad base
of support. Several recent studies have shown that a
variety of sedentary behaviors were ≤1.5 METs for chil-
dren and youth [21, 48–52], while others suggested that
the threshold may be too low for many childhood be-
haviors that would be considered sedentary by observa-
tion
[53,
54].
There
is
general
agreement
that
determining METs in children should use a VO2 stand-
ard that is higher than 3.5 ml/kg/min [55], and when
this is employed, there is broad support for the ≤1.5
MET threshold for preschool-aged [21, 51] and school-
aged children and youth [48–50, 52]. For adults, the
sedentary behavior threshold of ≤1.5 METs has been
widely recommended and accepted [4, 7, 25, 56].
The MET threshold for passive standing (e.g., not
working on an assembly line or painting) is also sup-
ported by the literature. For example, the compen-
dium of energy expenditures for youth reports the
following MET values: sending text messages while
standing, 1.8 METs; talking while standing, 1.8 METs;
standing quietly, 1.5 METs; arts and crafts while
standing, 1.9 METs; reading while standing, 1.8 METs;
drinking while standing, 2.0 METs; and eating while
standing, 2.0 METs [55]. The standing threshold of
≤2.0 METs for adults also has support in the litera-
ture [29, 31]. Values from the highly cited physical
activity compendium also support this threshold, for
example:
standing
doing miscellaneous,
2.0
METs;
standing doing arts and crafts (light effort), 1.8 METs;
cooking
or
food
preparation
while
standing,
2.0
METs; standing quietly in a line, 1.2 METs; standing
while talking or talking on the phone, 1.8 METs; and
standing while reading, 1.8 METs [57].
Strengths and limitations
A strength of this project was the systematic ap-
proach taken to determine the list of key terms and
arrive at consensus definitions for these terms. The
use of a large, broad, diverse and global cohort of
participants to provide input to the consensus defi-
nitions is a clear strength and should help with the
uptake and acceptance of these definitions. Yet, the
participants were limited to SBRN members and the
overall participation rate by SBRN members was
only 8%. However, for SBRN members that opened
the email invitation to participate, the rate was 22%,
slightly lower than the participation rate of 34% (52/
155) for the first SBRN consensus definitions project
[25]. It is possible that the participants do not repre-
sent the larger population of sedentary behavior re-
searchers and practitioners. A limitation to work of
this nature is that there will always be situations
and/or circumstances where the proposed definitions
are sub-optimal or not wholly satisfactory. Further-
more,
there
will
likely
be
different
conceptual
models and other definitions that exist for good rea-
sons or that will emerge as research evolves. The
goal of this project was not to marginalize such
opinions,
but
rather
respond
to
calls
for
better
standardization and harmonization of work in the
field at this point in time.

 Future directions and research needs
There are many future research needs directly related to
the definitions proposed in this manuscript. For ex-
ample, the validity of the proposed terms needs to be
tested and further work is necessary to study their con-
tent and face validity. In addition, refinements of MET-
value thresholds for different ages (e.g., young adults vs
older adults), different situations (e.g., while sitting and
typing; in different environmental conditions; or in
short vs extended durations) or as measured using alter-
nate measurement methods (e.g., measuring muscle ac-
tivity), and the consequent MET-value-related health
implications, requires further exploration [29, 32]. The
importance of sedentary behavior context (e.g., leisure
time vs school vs work) and modality (e.g., television
viewing vs reading vs talking on the phone) in relation
to health indicators and outcomes is poorly understood
and additional clarity may lead to refinement of the
conceptual model and/or the consensus definitions.
Additional research is required in populations with mo-
bility impairments or disease conditions where different
cut-points/thresholds may exist and there may be differ-
ent relationships with health indicators than in the gen-
eral population. Research into the health impact of
standing is just beginning to emerge [58–63]. How
standing interacts with sedentary behaviors and/or sed-
entary time, sleep and physical activities of various in-
tensities, and how these interactions relate to health
outcomes
and
indicators,
needs
further
research.
Through the survey responses SBRN members asked
for more research to arrive at specific MET-values and
related accelerometer cut-points for categorizing seden-
tary time. Further research to understand and compare
accelerometer data collected from different placement
locations (e.g., hip vs wrist) when assessing sedentary
time is also required. There were also requests from re-
spondents for standard criteria for defining sedentary
bouts and breaks to classify people as “Breakers” or
“Prolongers” [1]. Similarly, further research exploring
health indicators and outcomes associated with sitting
bouts of different durations, distinguishing between
long- and short-bouts, and operationalizing “frequent
breaks” were all recommended. How the intensity of
movement of a “break” affects resultant health-related
indictors also requires further exploration. Although
questionnaires are frequently used to assess sedentary
behavior, few have undergone psychometric testing [10].
Further research is needed to identify the most valid
and reliable means of assessing total sedentary behav-
iour, specific forms of sedentary behaviour, and seden-
tary
behaviour patterns
via
self- and
proxy-report
questionnaires.
Finally,
the
physiological
impact
of
‘transitions’
(e.g.,
sleep-awake,
sit-stand,
stand-step)
needs to be elucidated [64].
Conclusion
The definitions arrived at through the SBRN Termin-
ology Consensus Project are presented as standardized
definitions that we encourage researchers to embrace,
use and promote. With the assistance of international
SBRN volunteers, efforts are underway to ensure these
definitions are translated into several other languages,
including French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Korean,
German and others. Copies of all language versions of
the consensus definitions are available on the SBRN
website [24]. Periodic reviews of these consensus defini-
tions should be done, and updates made when appropri-
ate. It is hoped that the definitions resulting from this
comprehensive, transparent and broad-based participa-
tory process will result in widely supported and adopted
standardization of terminology, and advance future re-
search, interventions, policies and practices related to
sedentary behaviors.

Availability of data and materials
All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this
published article and its supplementary information files.
Authors’ contributions
The literature review was run by SA. The identified key terms were reviewed
and modified by the Steering Committee formed by MST, SA, JDB, TJS, VC,
AELC, SFMC, TMA and MJMC. Next, all Terminology Consensus Project
Participants reviewed and provided feedback on the proposed list of terms. JDB
created the online Survey 1 for the final key term list modification/approval/
shortening that was completed by the Steering Committee members (MST, SA,
JDB, TJS, VC, AELC, SFMC, TMA and MJMC) and prepared a compilation of the
collected data. MST, SA and JDB did the analysis of Survey 1 and finalized the
key term list. Then JDB created the Survey 2 (asking for first proposition of
definitions of each key term and caveats) that was completed by the Steering
Committee members and JDB compiled the collected data. MST, SA and JDB
analysed the collected data and created the first draft of definition of each key
term and caveats, and created the conceptual model. JDB created the draft of
the online Survey 3 (asking level of agreement and feedback on proposed
model, key term definitions and caveats) that was reviewed by the Steering
Committee members and then completed by all Terminology Consensus
Project Participants. JDB did the analysis of quantitative data and SA of
qualitative data collected by Survey 3. Based on those analyses, modifications to
model and key term definitions were made by MST, SA and JDB. MST wrote
the manuscript with the help of SA and JDB, and then the manuscript
(including the definitions and the conceptual model) was reviewed 2 times by
the Steering Committee members and 3 times by all Terminology Consensus
Project Participants who all give their final sign-off for submission. All authors
read and approved the final manuscript.
