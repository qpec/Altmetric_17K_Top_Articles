Most
countries
exclude
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)-positive patients from organ
donation
because of concerns regarding donor-derived HIV
transmission. The Swiss Federal Act on Transplanta-
tion has allowed organ transplantation between HIV-
positive donors and recipients since 2007. We report
the successful liver transplantation from an HIV-
positive donor to an HIV-positive recipient. Both donor
and recipient had been treated for many years with
antiretroviral therapy and harbored multidrug-resistant
viruses. Five months after transplantation, HIV viremia
remains undetectable. This observation supports the
inclusion of appropriate HIV-positive donors for trans-
plants specifically allocated to HIV-positive recipients.

Introduction
Concerns about donor-derived human immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
transmission
have
excluded
HIV-positive
patients from organ donation lists in most countries. This
leads to the loss of an estimated 356 potential organ
donors per year in the United States (1). HIV-positive solid
organ transplant candidates remain disadvantaged on wait-
ing lists with an increased risk of death, particularly in HIV-
hepatitis C virus (HCV)–coinfected individuals with liver
disease (2–4). Despite a higher relative risk of experiencing
graft failure compared to HIV-negative controls, HIV status
was not associated with an increased risk of death in a
cohort of solid organ transplant recipients in the United
States (5). The concern that transplantation of organs from
HIV-positive donors might harm transplant recipients
remains. Indeed, transmission of a new HIV strain to an
immunosuppressed HIV-positive recipient could poten-
tially lead to uncontrolled viral replication, immune dysreg-
ulation, and opportunistic infections (4,6). So far, reports
on the transplant of HIV-positive organs have been limited
to kidney transplantation in South Africa from treatment-
naive or first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART)–treated HIV-
positive donors to HIV-positive recipients (7). The Swiss
Federal Act on Transplantation and its bylaws has allowed
transplantation from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive
recipients since July 2007 (Data S1, Document 1) (8,9).
Similarly, the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) act passed
by the United States Congress in November 2013 legal-
ized such transplants, but only in the setting of an
approved research protocol (10). From 2008 to 2014, 569
HIV-positive individuals died in Switzerland, with liver-
related deaths accounting for nearly 14% of all reported
deaths (11). During this period of time, 14 HIV-positive
individuals benefited from a liver transplant (LT) from
HIV-negative donors (Franziska Sch€
oni-Affolter, personal
communication). We report the first documented case of
successful LT between an ART-experienced HIV-positive
donor and recipient.
Case Report
The recipient
A 53-year-old HIV-positive man was offered a liver from
a brain death deceased HIV-positive donor in October
2015 in Switzerland. He was diagnosed HIV-positive sec-
ondary to intravenous drug abuse in 1987 with a Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage B3

 (herpes zoster) and a CD4 cell count nadir 78 cells/mm3.
Initial treatment consisted of zidovudine and zalcitabine
in 1992, followed in 1997 by a combination of indinavir,
stavudine, and lamivudine until a virological escape and a
M184V mutation were identified in 2001. Following a
short
period
of
structured
treatment
interruption
between 2001 and 2002, he resumed an ART of aba-
cavir, efavirenz, and didanosine (switched in 2003 to
tenofovir) late in 2002. Since 2003, HIV-RNA levels have
remained below the threshold of detectability (50 copies/
mL) with a stable CD4 cell count between 300 and
400 cells/mm3. In 2013, a combination of rilpivirine, teno-
fovir, and emtricitabine was initiated (Figure 1). Chronic
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 coinfection was diag-
nosed in 1997 with a positive HCV RNA viremia that
became undetectable in 2004 without specific therapy.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological status was hepatitis B
surface antigen positive, antibodies to the hepatitis B
core antigen positive, with undetectable HBV DNA vire-
mia under tenofovir therapy. Seroconversion from hepati-
tis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) to anti-HBe occurred in
2010. A replicative hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection (7.3
E+8 copies/mL) with sustained hepatic cytolysis occurred
in 2011. Pegylated interferon was initiated but stopped
after four doses because of adverse drug reactions. At
the time of pretransplant evaluation, the Child-Pugh
score was B7 and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score was 9. The patient was registered on the
waiting list in November 2014. Clinical condition and liver
function tests rapidly declined thereafter, with poorly
controlled ascites and recurring episodes of encephalopa-
thy. In June 2015, the Child-Pugh score had increased to
C10, but the MELD score remained low (11). Given this
particular situation, he was granted a nonstandard MELD
exception for incapacitating encephalopathy and refrac-
tory ascites. Both a liver biopsy and explant examination

 confirmed the diagnosis of cirrhosis on HBV/HDV-related
chronic hepatitis of moderate inflammatory activity (Data
S1, Document 2A–C).
The donor
The donor was a 75-year-old man who died of a cerebel-
lar hemorrhage. He was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1989
(transmission route–bisexual contacts; CDC stage C3
[cryptosporidiosis, esophageal candidiasis, herpes zos-
ter]). His ART consisted initially of zidovudine, lamivu-
dine, and indinavir started in the setting of detected
multiple resistance mutations in 1996. Due to a virologi-
cal failure and the presence of mutations associated with
drug resistance in 2002 (Figure 2), his drug regimen was
modified to nevirapine, boosted lopinavir, and abacavir.
Thereafter, his HIV-RNA viremia remained below the
detection limit with a stable CD4 cell count around
400 cells/mm3. In 2011, he was started on raltegravir,
modified for dolutegravir 15 days prior to his death, in
conjunction with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Following
information by his primary care physician that Swiss law
allowed him to donate his organs to HIV-positive recipi-
ents, he provided written explicit consent for organ dona-
tion in September 2015 (Data S1, Document 3). At the
time of donation his laboratory values (including white
blood cell count, liver and kidney function tests) were
normal; CD4 cell count was 298 cells/mm3 (21%) and
HIV-RNA below the detection level of 40 copies/mL.

HIV+ to HIV+ Liver Transplantation
 Liver transplantation
A transplant infectious diseases physician informed the
recipient candidate about potential virus transmission and
the requirements to adapt his anti-HIV therapy due to dif-
ferent viral resistances. The patient accepted the risk and
signed an informed consent for liver transplantation (Data
S1, Document 4). No ethical clearance was necessary
due to the permissive law in Switzerland. A donor per-
operative liver biopsy identified a macrovesicular steato-
sis of minimal extent (less than 10%) on frozen section
histology and mild portal inflammation, not contraindicat-
ing the organ donation (Data S1, Document 2D). We
were unable to detect HIV-RNA by polymerase chain
reaction performed on cells extracted from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded donor liver tissue despite adequate
tissue
conservation.
Posttransplant,
the
liver
graft
showed immediate function, and no surgical or medical
complications occurred. The transplant serostatus was
the following: cytomegalovirus D+/R� (positive donor,
negative recipient), toxoplasmosis D+/R+, Epstein-Barr
virus
D+/R+.
He
received
a
standard,
steroid-free
immunosuppressive
regimen
associating
basiliximab
induction, as well as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofe-
til. To prevent HBV recurrence, hepatitis B immunoglobu-
lins (HBIG) were infused during the transplant surgery.
Posttransplant care
Rilpivirine/tenofovir/emtricitabine were restarted on Day 2
posttransplant, together with raltegravir and subcuta-
neous enfuvirtide to cover for the donor’s HIV resistance
genotypes. The patient was discharged on posttransplant
Day 22 receiving prophylactic valgancyclovir and trimetho-
prim and sulfamethoxazole in addition to his immuno-
suppression and ART. ART was modified 3 months after
transplantation to a fixed-dose combination of rilpivirine/
tenofovir/emtricitabine and dolutegravir. Rilpivirine plasma
levels, measured at 6 days and 8 weeks after transplanta-
tion, were in the normal to lower therapeutic range (25th
to 40th percentile) and decreased at weeks 15 and 18
posttransplant to the 10th lower percentile (30 ng/mL).
Plasma levels of dolutegravir were lower than expected
after a dose of 50 mg twice a day at weeks 15 and 18.
Tacrolimus dosage was easily adjusted to maintain trough
levels in the desired range (8–15 ng/mL). HBV and HDV
DNA, as well as HIV and HCV RNA, remained unde-
tectable after transplantation (Figure 1). No rejection epi-
sode occurred during the 5-month follow-up period.
Discussion
We report the first successful liver transplantation, to our
knowledge, from an HIV-positive donor to an HIV-positive
recipient. So far, report of transplantation of organs from
HIV-positive donors has been restricted to the descrip-
tion of the outcome in 27 HIV-positive recipients who
received kidneys from HIV-positive
donors in South
Africa (7). Five years posttransplantation, both cumulative
patient and graft survival (74% and 84% with censoring
for death with function, respectively) were similar to
those in HIV-positive recipients of an HIV-negative organ.
In this study, however, both donors and recipients were
highly selected. To reduce the risk of resistant-virus
transmission, donors were either ART-na€
ıve or had taken
only first-line ART, while CD4 T cell counts of at least
200/mm3 and undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels were
prerequisites in potential recipients taking ART for at
least 3 months. In addition there has been a recent
report (March 2016) in the news media of a liver and a
kidney transplant performed in Baltimore from an HIV+
donor to HIV+ recipients.
The present report is original in many ways. Both donor
and recipient had been seropositive for roughly 30 years,
had been treated with several ART regimens, and had
negative viral assays for HIV at the time of transplanta-
tion. Both harbored HIV strains with resistance mutations
on the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, which were non-
identical. Thus, to decrease the risk that the transplanted
liver would transmit a viral strain with distinct mutations,
we adapted the recipient’s pretransplant suppressive
ART to the donor’s HIV genotype by adding an integrase
inhibitor and a short course of enfuvirtide. This strategy
has thus far proven successful; at 5 months, HIV viremia
remains suppressed below the threshold of detection of
20 copies/mL. At this point, there is no indication that
immunosuppressive therapy has enabled an increase in
HIV pathogenicity and thus potentiated its spread, as
previously feared (6).
Outcome in HIV/HBV-coinfected LT recipients is excel-
lent,
and
comparable
to
that
of
HBV-monoinfected
patients receiving combined HBIG and HBV antiviral ther-
apy (12,13). Accordingly, our patient received HBIG with
tenofovir, and HBV viremia remained undetectable. In
contrast, HIV–HCV coinfection is of concern in LT, with
increased risks of rejection and reduced graft and patient
survival, particularly when donors are 50 years of age or
older (14,15). In the present case, the recipient was coin-
fected with HBV, HCV, and HDV, while the donor was
75 years old. However, the risk of a poor outcome was
likely mitigated by the recipient’s spontaneous clearance
of HCV viremia before LT and low MELD score. Indeed,
the pre-LT MELD score was identified as the only predic-
tor of survival in a French multicenter cohort of HIV–HCV
coinfected LT recipients (16). This has led experts to
advocate the use of HIV-positive organs to facilitate
access to transplantation for those with lower MELD
scores (16,17). Furthermore, an eventual HCV infection
recurrence in our recipient would very likely be controlled
with the newly available highly active anti-HCV agents.
Despite
long-standing
exposure
to
multiple
antiviral
drugs, the histology of the transplanted liver revealed
only minor macrovesicular steatosis. Furthermore, hep-
atic function recovered rapidly after LT, lessening the
fear that the transplant might have suffered from drug-

Calmy et al
 induced damage. Longer follow-up is certainly needed to
ensure both the virologic and functional safety of this
procedure.
Drug–drug interactions remain potentially challenging in
HIV transplant recipients (18). Dolutegravir, rilpivirine, and
tacrolimus are substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A
(19,20). Dolutegravir plasma levels were lower than
expected in the recipient, and rilpivirine and tacrolimus
plasma concentrations gradually decreased to the desired
therapeutic
range.
No
CYP3A
inducer
was
included
among the recipient’s comedications that could explain
the increased drug clearance and reduced plasma con-
centrations of CYP3A substrates. Donor genetic variabil-
ity could account for the phenotypic alterations observed
in the recipient (21).
The immunologic and virologic control produced by effec-
tive ART in both donor and recipient was essential to the
success of this LT. With currently available antiretrovirals,
HIV-RNA can be rapidly suppressed in the vast majority
of cases and should not be a major concern in the deci-
sion to proceed with transplantation.
Another issue could be the need to decide on the safety
of organ transplantation in the absence of adequate doc-
umentation of the clinical history of both HIV+ donor and
recipient. This includes viral rebound episodes and geno-
typic resistance, as well as potential active opportunistic
infections and/or concurrent oncologic diseases. This
may in certain situations impose limits to organ donation.
In Switzerland over 75% of all HIV+ patients, including
both our donor and recipient, are included in the Swiss
HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), allowing precise documenta-
tion of all HIV-related events (22). Moreover in 2016,
with the advent of potent ARTs, the vast majority of HIV
strains can be successfully treated. In certain circum-
stances such as the absence of ART, HIV+ patients with
active HIV viral replication may be considered as poten-
tial donors.
The Swiss Federal Act on the Transplantation of Organs,
Tissues and Cells (810.21) went into effect on July 1,
2007 (8). Bylaw 810.211 (article 6.2.1) authorizes the
transplantation of organs from HIV-positive donors to
HIV-positive recipients (9). The HOPE Act signed into law
as PL 113-51 on November 21, 2013 allows organ dona-
tion between HIV-positive donors and recipients in the
United States in the setting of research, and could yield
up to 192 kidneys and 247 livers annually (1,10).
Effective ART has revolutionized the health of HIV-
positive individuals. Treating physicians of HIV-infected
individuals should inform their patients if the option
exists for organ donation, and encourage policymakers to
consider lifting restrictions on organ donation from HIV-
positive individuals for HIV-positive recipients.
