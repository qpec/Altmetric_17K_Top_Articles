Abstract
Objective
Previous studies have suggested that excessive internet use may cause lack of sleep. How-
ever, recent studies have hypothesized that lack of sleep may instigate internet use for lei-
sure. To elucidate the potential effects of sleep time on internet use, we explored the
different associations between sleep time and internet use according to its purpose.
Methods
The population-based, cross-sectional study group from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior
Web-based Survey (KYRBWS) collected data from 57,425 middle school students in 2014
and 2015. Sleep time over the past 7 days was classified into the following groups: < 7 h
(6 h); � 7 h, < 8 h (7 h); � 8 h, < 9 h (8 h); and � 9 h (9+ h). Internet use time per day was
separately surveyed for leisure and for study and categorized as follows: 0 h; > 0 h, � 1 h
(1 h); > 1 h, � 2 h (2 h); and > 2 h (2+ h) per day. Information on age, sex, region of resi-
dence, body mass index (BMI), economic level, parental education level, stress level, school
performance level, and sleep satisfaction were retrieved. The relationships between sleep
time and internet use time for leisure/study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regres-
sion with complex sampling. In the subgroup analysis according to sleep satisfaction (good,
normal, and poor), the associations of sleep time with internet use for leisure were analyzed
using the same methods.
Results
Compared to 9+ h of sleep, less sleep was related to a long internet use time (2+ h) for lei-
sure (adjusted odds ratio, AOR [95% confidence interval, CI] of sleep: 8 h = 1.23 [1.14–
1.32]; 7 h = 1.42 [1.31–1.54]; and 6 h = 1.56 [1.44–1.70]; P < 0.001). Conversely, a relation-
ship between less sleep and a long internet use time (2+ h) for study was evident only for 6 h
of sleep (AOR of sleep: 8 h = 0.84 [0.84–1.04]; 7 h = 1.05 [0.94–1.17]; and 6 h = 1.32 [1.27–
1.59]; P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis according to sleep satisfaction, less sleep was

Conclusion
Less sleep was significantly related to long-term use of the internet for leisure, whereas this
association was not definite for internet use for study. Furthermore, poor sleep quality poten-
tiated the relationship between less sleep time and internet use for leisure.
Introduction
The internet is an inevitable element in civilized life. More than 90% of the Korean adolescent
population is estimated to surf the internet using browsers [1]. Although the internet plays an
essential role in daily life, the enormous amount of content and linked pages provide an easy
distraction from planned professional destinations online [2]. Diverse attractive online content
and interactive communication systems facilitate falling into internet use for leisure even
when the drawbacks of this use are rationally known. Internet use for leisure diminishes pro-
ductivity at work, resulting in a huge economic burden [3]. Thus, elucidating its related condi-
tions and controlling internet use for leisure are important goals.
In modernized society, many adolescents suffer from a chronic lack of sleep [4,5]. The aver-
age sleep time for American adolescents is less than 6.5 h on school days [6]. Korean adoles-
cents sleep an estimated 5 h per day, which is considerably lower than the recommended sleep
time of 7.5 to 8.5 h per day [6,7]. Prior studies have demonstrated relationships between exces-
sive internet use and poor sleep quality [1,8]. In adolescents, frequent bedtime internet use is
inversely related to sleep duration [9,10]. Generally, excessive internet use is believed to cause
physical sleep deprivation. Long internet use times induce a relative shortness of sleep time,
daytime fatigue, sleepiness, and arousal problems in adolescents [11,12]. Stimulating and las-
civious content on the internet may be recalled at nighttime, thereby potentially causing over-
excitement or nightmares [13]. Moreover, lengthening the time of light exposure can disturb
circadian rhythms [11]. The reciprocal associations among risk behaviors of sleep deprivation,
including internet use, alcohol and drug abuse, and use of mobile phones, were suggested to
have an effect on the relationship between sleep deprivation and frequent internet use [14].
However, recent studies on these passive roles of sleep in relation to internet use are con-
flicting in terms of the active effect of sleep on internet use time. Psychological or other emo-
tional conditions subsequent to sleep deprivation have been proposed to be active triggers of
prolonged internet use. Indeed, sleep problems have been suggested to cause internet overuse
and internet use for leisure [15–17]. These studies have proposed that sleep deprivation results
in the depletion of self-regulation, thereby facilitating loafing on internet browsers not related
to work [16].
Most previous studies on internet use and sleep did not consider differences regarding the
purpose of internet use due to the difficulty in investigating this topic. Thus, the present study
investigated the relationship between sleep time and internet use for leisure by discriminating
this purpose from use for study. The running hypothesis of this study was that sleep depriva-
tion induced internet use for leisure. In particular, the impact of sleep deprivation on internet
use for leisure may be higher in the poor sleep satisfaction group than in the good sleep satis-
faction group. Few studies have addressed the numerous possible confounders for sleep and
internet use, such as socioeconomic factors. Socioeconomic factors, including parental factors,

 have been related to problematic internet use in adolescents [18,19], and body mass index
(BMI) has been associated with internet use in adolescents [20]. In addition, school perfor-
mance has been associated with internet use time [21]. To minimize possible bias, this study
considered various confounders, including BMI, region of residence, economic level, parental
education level, stress level, and school performance. We used a huge population-based repre-
sentative nationwide study group, and we specifically focused on an adolescent population vul-
nerable to internet overuse [22]. The aim of this study was to investigate the different
associations between sleep time and internet use times according to the purpose of use (for
study/for leisure).
Materials and methods
Study population and data collection
The Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea
(KCDC) approved this study (2014-06EXP-02-P-A). Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant prior to the survey. Because this web-based survey was performed at
schools with a huge number of participants, informed consent from their parents was exempted.
This consent procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the KCDC.
This cross-sectional study used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Sur-
vey (KYRBWS). This study covers one nation using statistical methods based on designed
sampling and adjusted weighted values. Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. The data were
collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea. Korean adolescents
from the 7th through 12th grades completed the self-administered questionnaire voluntarily
and anonymously. The validity and reliability of the KYRBWS have been documented by
other studies [23,24]. The surveys evaluated data from South Korean adolescents using strati-
fied two-stage (schools and classes) clustered sampling based on data from the Education Min-
istry. The sampling was weighted by statisticians, who performed post-stratification and
considered the non-response rates and extreme values. In the study data, we excluded high
school participants (10th through 12th grades). In Korea, high school students have very limited
free time to access the internet due to their long school attendance times and intense academic
workloads.
Among a total of 69,961 middle school students (7th through 9th grades), we excluded the
following participants from this study: participants who did not complete the sleep time items
or who slept less than 2 h (11,365 participants) and participants who did not record their
height or weight (1,170 participants). Finally, 57,426 participants (28,863 males and 28,563
females) from 12 to 15 years old were included in this study (Fig 1).
Survey
The understanding, reliability, and validity of each question were investigated by the KCDC to
qualify the surveys [25]. The region of residence was divided into 3 groups by administrative
district (large city, small city, and rural area). Obesity was categorized into 4 groups according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for BMI (kg/m2) for children
and teens [26] as follows: obese � 95th percentile; overweight � 85th percentile and < 95th per-
centile; healthy weight � 5th percentile and < 85th percentile; and underweight < 5th percen-
tile. The self-reported economic level was measured as 5 levels from highest to lowest. The
parents’ education levels were divided into the following 4 groups: college graduate or further
education; graduated high school; graduated middle school or under; and unknown or no
parents. Those participants who did not know the educational levels of their parents or who

 had no parents were not excluded because their exclusion could increase missing values for the
relatively lower economic level participants. The stress levels of the participants were divided
into 5 groups (severe, moderate, mild, a little, and no stress). The participants were asked
about their study performances in their grades at school during the past 12 months. The per-
formance at school was divided into the following 5 levels: A (highest); B (middle, high); C
(middle); D (middle, low); and E (lowest).
Sleep time over the past 7 days was also evaluated. The falling asleep and waking up times
were measured to within 10 min. The duration of sleep time was calculated by subtracting the
falling asleep time from the wake-up time. The mean daily sleep time was calculated by adding
the weekday and weekend sleep times with 5/7 and 2/7 weighting, respectively. Sleep time was
divided into the following 4 groups: < 7 h (6 h); � 7 h, < 8 h (7 h); � 8 h, < 9 h (8 h); and � 9
h (9+ h) [27,28]. The participants were asked whether they thought their sleep over the past 7
days was sufficient (sleep satisfaction). Sleep satisfaction was classified as very poor, poor, nor-
mal, good, and very good. Because few participants replied with extreme values (very poor or
very good), we regrouped this metric into 3 groups as follows: poor (very poor and poor), nor-
mal, and good (good and very good).
The participants were asked about their internet use time for study and for leisure. The
internet use times for study and for leisure were separately estimated. The mean daily internet
use time was calculated by adding the weekday use time and weekend use time with 5/7 and 2/
7 weighting, respectively. Internet use time was grouped into 4 units as follows: 0 h a day (0 h);
> 0 h, � 1 h a day (1 h); > 1 h, � 2 h a day (2 h); and > 2 h a day (2+ h). Internet use for leisure
was measured on the same scale and grouped into the following 4 units: 0 h a day (0 h); > 0 h,
� 1 h a day (1 h); > 1 h, � 2 h a day (2 h); and > 2 h a day (2+ h).
Statistical analysis
The differences in general characteristics according to the sleep time were calculated using lin-
ear regression analysis with complex sampling and the chi-square test with the Rao-Scott
correction.

participants without information on sleep time or who sleep less than 2 h (11,365) and those without height or weight
data (1,170) were excluded. Complete data for 57,426 participants were obtained and analyzed.

 Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of sleep time (independent variable) for internet use for
study/leisure (dependent variable) were calculated using multinomial logistic regression analy-
ses accounting for the complex sampling. The BMI, region of residence, economic level, paren-
tal education level, stress level, and school performance were adjusted as confounders.
Multinomial logistic regression is an extension of logistic regression for when a nominal out-
come has more than two unordered categories/levels. In this analysis, internet use time for lei-
sure = 0 and internet use time for study = 0 were set as the references.
For the subgroup analysis according to sleep satisfaction, the AORs of sleep time for inter-
net use for leisure were calculated using a multiple logistic regression analysis accounting for
the complex sampling.
Two-tailed analyses were conducted, and P-values lower than 0.05 were considered to indi-
cate significance. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. After applying the
weighted values recommended by KYRBWS, all the results are presented as weighted values.
The results were analyzed statistically using SPSS ver. 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Among the participants, 26.0% (14,946), 31.1% (17,862), 29% (16,641), and 13.9% (7,977) slept
for 6 h, 7 h, 8 h, and 9+ h, respectively (Table 1). Each type of internet use (for study or for lei-
sure) showed significant differences among the sleep time groups (each P < 0.001). Age, sex,
region of residence, BMI, economic level, parental education level, stress level, school perfor-
mance, and sleep satisfaction were significantly different according to the sleep time (each
P < 0.001). Thus, these variables were adjusted as confounders to analyze the relationships
between sleep time and internet use time for leisure or study.
Compared to the student who reported 9+ h sleep, less sleep was related to long internet use
(2+ h) for leisure (AOR [95% CI] of sleep 6 h = 1.56 [1.44–1.70]; P < 0.001). Less sleep was
also associated with internet use for leisure in the 2 h and 1 h groups (P < 0.001). Conversely,
a relationship between less sleep and long internet use (2+ h) for study was not evident. The
relationship between sleep time and internet use for study showed significance only between
internet use for 2+ h and sleep for 6 h (Table 2).
For the respondents with less satisfactory sleep, the relationships between sleep time and
2+ h internet use for leisure demonstrated higher AORs with a dose-response relationship
(Table 3). The poor sleep satisfaction group showed the most marked correlation between
sleep time and 2+ h internet use for leisure in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). In the
normal sleep satisfaction group, 2+ h internet use for leisure was less associated with the sleep
time than in the poor sleep satisfaction group. The relationships were the most alleviated in
the good sleep satisfaction groups.
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that less sleep time was significantly correlated with more
than 2 h of internet use for leisure. Conversely, less sleep time showed only a tiny association
with internet use for study. Few studies have considered the effects of sleep deprivation on
internet use for leisure. A recent study suggested that sleep time deprivation and poor sleep
quality caused employees to use the internet for leisure [16]. These authors noted that the shift
in sleep time due to daylight savings time also resulted in elevated internet use for leisure.
Moreover, a short sleep time and interrupted sleep were positively associated with time spent
on internet use for leisure in undergraduate students [15]. The present study is in line with this
previous study and expands the relationship between sleep time and internet use for leisure by
categorizing both the sleep time and internet use time. This study was pioneering, because we

 discriminated internet use for leisure from that for study and demonstrated a dose-response
correlation between sleep deprivation and internet use time. Furthermore, sleep quality was
assessed using a subgroup analysis, which confirmed a more noticeable negative relationship
between sleep time in the poor sleep satisfaction group and internet use for leisure.
Several prior works have demonstrated the relationship between sleep deprivation and pro-
longed use of the internet or other media [29–32]. These studies presumed that excessive inter-
net use time caused sleep deprivation by displacing sleep time [30,31]. However, the present
study demonstrated that less sleep time was differentially related to internet use time in accor-
dance with its purpose. In this study, a short sleep time was markedly more related to internet
use time for leisure and less related to internet use for study. Therefore, sleep-deprived subjects
spent more time on the internet for leisure but not for study. In other words, excessive internet
use does not always result in sleep deprivation. Thus, the excessive overall time of internet use,
irrespective of its purpose and the subsequent shortage of sleep time, perturbation of circadian

 rhythms, and poor sleep hygiene, cannot fully explain the relationship between sleep time and
internet use time.
To explore the implications of sleep displacement by internet use time, the present study
conducted a subgroup analysis according to the quality of sleep. As a result, the poor sleep sat-
isfaction group showed stronger correlations with internet use for leisure. The good sleep satis-
faction group was less correlated with internet use for leisure, although their sleep time was
less than 7 h. Conversely, compared to the good sleep satisfaction group, the poor sleep satis-
faction group had a higher correlation with internet use for leisure even though they slept for a
sufficient time. Thus, in addition to sleep time, sleep quality is also engaged in the relationship
between sleep and internet use for leisure.
The ego depletion model may provide a link between sleep deprivation and internet use for
leisure [16]. Wandering internet networking not related to work is explained as a type of
behavior in accordance with the depletion of self-regulation. Self-regulation is a limited
resource that is spent to regulate thinking, emotions, and actions. Sleep is important for restor-
ing self-regulation [33,34]. Thus, subjects with a shortage of sleep time fail to replenish their
self-control resources [16,35]. The resultant low self-control can induce uncontrolled behavior.
For example, lack of sleep has been proposed to be associated with delinquency [33].
Our results on the relationship between less sleep time and more internet use for leisure
were fitted to the ego depletion model. Similar to the previous study, sufficient sleep was nega-
tively associated with internet use for leisure by reducing stress and recharging mental well-
ness, such as self-esteem and autonomy [1]. Moreover, the effects of sleep deprivation on
internet use for leisure could be mediated by other emotional factors. Lack of sleep may cause

 emotional problems, including depressive moods, confusion, anxiety, and fatigue [36]. In par-
ticular, adequate sleep time is a crucial factor in adolescents for physical development and
other aspects of development [37]. Insufficient sleep in adolescents is associated with a wide
range of psychological and behavioral problems, including depression [28,38]. These negative
moods can induce more internet use solely for leisure. Furthermore, insomniac subjects may
be more likely to be exposed to the opportunity for internet use to fill in their time [15,17].
However, an inverse influence of internet use on sleep is still possible, regardless of its pur-
pose. Because increased internet use may eliminate time for sleep physically, the absolute inter-
net use time for study and for leisure may have decreased the sleep time in the present study.
In addition, the content of internet for leisure can influence sleep hygiene [32]. Compared to
online educational content, internet games, attractive commercial advertisements, and blogs
usually harbor exciting, fast-paced, and stimulating content. Indirectly, extensive exposure to
these types of internet content affects mood problems, such as violence, compulsiveness, and
anxiety, which mediate sleep problems [8,39,40]. Taken together, vicious cycles between sleep
deprivation and internet use for leisure can be presumed in which sleep time becomes physi-
cally shortened as more time is spent on the internet browsing. Inversely, the present results
imply detrimental effects of insufficient sleep on increasing internet use for leisure.
The present study is superior to previous works in several aspects. We used a huge popula-
tion-based representative study group, which was collected using random nationwide sampling.
Numerous factors potentially related to sleep and internet use were comprehensively investi-
gated and adjusted using a multiple logistic regression analysis. Moreover, to the best of our
knowledge, quantitative measures and classifications of sleep and internet use time have not
been used in other studies. These classifications enable delineation of the effects of sleep time
and internet use time in detail and are not limited to extreme cases of lack of sleep and internet
addiction. Foremost, we discriminate between using the internet for study or for leisure, which
provided supporting evidence that internet use for leisure but not for study was related to less
sleep time, because the overall length of internet use could not explain the sleep deprivation.
However, the present study design still confines the interpretation of the causal relationship
between sleep time and internet use for leisure. Due to the cross-sectional study design, we
could not completely exclude possible effects of internet use on sleep time. The lack of objec-
tive parameters and dependence on a subjective survey pose a possible recall bias. We selected
sleep time to represent sleep deprivation; daily time napping, medication history, and other
parameters of sleep quality, including insomnia, sleepwalking, periodic leg movements, and
sleep apnea, were not accounted for in the present study. The amount of internet use was mea-
sured by the time of internet use; internet-related symptoms and addictive behaviors were not
assessed in this study. A future study with a longitudinal design considering various factors of
sleep quality will solve the current limitations of this study and elucidate the causality between
sleep problems and internet use, which has a great impact, particularly in the adolescent
population.
Lack of sleep is related to internet use for leisure in Korean adolescents. The correlation
between internet use and sleep time was prominent when the internet was used for leisure but
was weak when the internet was used for study. The poor sleep quality group demonstrated
more marked relationships between internet use for leisure and less sleep time.
