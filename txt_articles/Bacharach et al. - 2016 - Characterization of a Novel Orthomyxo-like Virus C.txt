ABSTRACT
Tilapia are an important global food source due to their omnivorous diet, tolerance for high-density aquaculture,
and relative disease resistance. Since 2009, tilapia aquaculture has been threatened by mass die-offs in farmed fish in Israel and
Ecuador. Here we report evidence implicating a novel orthomyxo-like virus in these outbreaks. The tilapia lake virus (TiLV) has
a 10-segment, negative-sense RNA genome. The largest segment, segment 1, contains an open reading frame with weak sequence
homology to the influenza C virus PB1 subunit. The other nine segments showed no homology to other viruses but have con-
served, complementary sequences at their 5= and 3= termini, consistent with the genome organization found in other orthomyxo-
viruses. In situ hybridization indicates TiLV replication and transcription at sites of pathology in the liver and central nervous
system of tilapia with disease.
IMPORTANCE
The economic impact of worldwide trade in tilapia is estimated at $7.5 billion U.S. dollars (USD) annually. The
infectious agent implicated in mass tilapia die-offs in two continents poses a threat to the global tilapia industry, which not only
provides inexpensive dietary protein but also is a major employer in the developing world. Here we report characterization of
the causative agent as a novel orthomyxo-like virus, tilapia lake virus (TiLV). We also describe complete genomic and protein
sequences that will facilitate TiLV detection and containment and enable vaccine development.

T
ilapia are increasingly important to domestic and global food
security. Comprising more than 100 species, Nile tilapia
(Oreochromis niloticus) is the predominant cultured species
worldwide (1). Global production is estimated at 4.5 million met-
ric tons with a current value in excess of $7.5 billion U.S. dollars
(USD) and is estimated to increase to 7.3 million metric tons by
2030 (2, 3). The largest producers (in order) are China, Egypt,
Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Co-
lombia, and Honduras. The United States is the leading importer,
consuming 225,000 metric tons of tilapia annually (4). In addition
to their value as an inexpensive source of dietary protein (5, 6),
tilapia have utility in alga and mosquito control and habitat main-
tenance for shrimp farming (7). A wide range of bacteria, fungi,
protozoa, and viruses has been described as challenges to tilapiine
aquaculture (8–10). Bacterial and fungal infections have been ad-
dressed through the use of antibiotics or topical treatments. No
specific therapy has been described for viral infections of tilapia
(11); however, viruses were not implicated as substantive threats
until 2009, when massive losses of tilapia, presumed to be due to
viral infection, were described in Israel and Ecuador (12, 13).
Eyngor and colleagues investigated outbreaks in Israel and re-
ported a syndrome comprising lethargy, endophthalmitis, skin
erosions, renal congestion, and encephalitis and demonstrated
transmissibility of disease from affected to naive fish. They cul-
tured a virus from infected fish in E-11 cells (cloned subculture of
snakehead fish cell line), demonstrated sensitivity to ether and
chloroform, and obtained a sequence specific for disease through
cDNA library screening that predicted a 420-amino-acid (aa)
open reading frame (ORF) with no apparent homology to any
nucleic acid or protein sequence in existing databases. The virus
was tentatively named tilapia lake virus lake virus (TiLV); how-
ever, no taxonomic assignment was feasible at that time (13). Fer-
guson and colleagues described a disease in farmed Nile tilapia in
South America that differed from that caused by the Israeli virus in
that pathology was focused in the liver rather than in the central
nervous system (12). No agent was isolated; however, PCR using

 primers and probes based on the sequence obtained from the virus
isolated in Israel revealed the presence of a similar virus (J. Del
Pozo, N. Mishra, R. N. Kabuusu, S. Cheetham Brows, A. Eldar, E.
Bacharach, W. I. Lipkin, H. W. Ferguson, unpublished data).
Here, we report comprehensive analysis of the TiLV isolate
from Israel. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing (UHTS),
Northern hybridization, mass spectrometry (MS), in situ hybrid-
ization, and infectivity studies indicate that TiLV is a segmented,
negative-sense RNA virus. TiLV contains 10 genome segments,
each with an open reading frame (ORF). Nine of the segments
have no recognizable homology to other known sequences; one
segment predicts a protein with weak homology to the PB1 sub-
unit of influenza C virus, an orthomyxovirus. Our findings sug-
gest that TiLV represents a novel orthomyxo-like virus and con-
firm that it poses a global threat to tilapiine aquaculture (12, 13).
RESULTS
High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. RNA
extracts of brain from tilapia with disease in Israel were depleted of
rRNA and were used as the template for Ion Torrent sequencing.
RNA extracted from nuclease-treated, sucrose gradient-purified
and concentrated particles from infected E-11 culture cells were
used as the template for Illumina sequencing. Reads from two Ion
Torrent and two Illumina libraries were taxonomically classified
using taxMaps (https://github.com/nygenome/taxmaps) by map-
ping against the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s
(NCBI) nucleotide database, the NCBI RefSeq database (14), the
tilapia reference genome sequence (Orenil1.1), and correspond-
ing annotated tilapiine mRNA sequences (15). Unclassified reads
(not mapping to any known sequence) were then independently
assembled using the VICUNA assembler (16). Contigs from each
library were aligned with BLAST (17) against all contigs from the
other 3 libraries, retaining hits with an E value of 1e�10 or lower
to identify assembled sequences likely to derive from the same
segment of the same species of virus in different samples. Single-
linkage clustering was used to group together all of the contigs that
showed any similarity. We identified 10 contig clusters that con-
tained at least one contig in each of the 4 libraries. Within each
cluster, contigs were aligned to each other and manually assem-
bled to generate a maximum-length sequence after inverted tan-
dem duplications at the ends of contigs, likely resulting from am-
plification artifacts, were removed. Overlapping predicted open
reading frames (ORFs) in contigs from different assemblies were
used to correct for frameshift errors and to infer the longest pos-
sible ORF. Based on a model wherein the genomic segments are
anticipated to contain conserved termini, we used a combination
of k-mer analysis, read depth analysis, and manual curation to
build 5=- and 3=-terminal sequence motifs to refine terminal se-
quences. Mapping of the initial raw read data against the 10 final
consensus sequences with BWA-MEM (17) demonstrated that
99% of the unidentified reads from the Illumina libraries and 87%
of unidentified reads from the Ion Torrent libraries mapped to the
consensus sequences.
Characterization of TiLV genome. PCR primers were de-
signed and used to amplify fragments representing all 10 contigs
from RNA extracts from infected fish and purified virus particles.
5= and 3= rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to
recover terminal sequences in all 10 clusters. Based on similarity in
terminal sequences in the individual clusters, we concluded that
the clusters represented 10 viral genomic segments and hence-
forth will refer to them as segments 1 to 10 (GenBank accession
no. KU751814 to KU751823) (Table 1). Segment 1 is the largest at
1.641 kb. Segments 2 to 10 are 1.471, 1.371, 1.250, 1.099, 1.044,
0.777, 0.657, 0.548, and 0.465 kb, respectively. Segment 1 pre-
dicted a protein with weak homology to the PB1 subunit of influ-
enza C virus (~17% amino acid identity, 37% segment coverage)
(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The other nine seg-
ments had no homology to other sequences in the GenBank nu-
cleotide and protein databases with mega blast/BLASTx/tBLASTn
or tBLASTx. Based on weak homology with PB1 motifs (18–23),
we compared the segment 1 ORF with polymerase subunit PB1
recovered from specific members of the Orthomyxoviridae family.
Segment 1 putative protein showed low homology to four motifs
conserved in RNA-dependent RNA and RNA-dependent DNA
polymerases (Fig. 1A).
The nucleotide sequences of the 5= and 3= noncoding regions of
all 10 segments were aligned using Geneious software 6.8.1
(Fig. 1B). Thirteen nucleotides at the 5= termini and 13 nucleo-
tides at the 3= termini were similar in all segments, an organization
similar to that observed for influenza viruses (24, 25). Ten of 13
nucleotides on the 5= termini and 7 of 13 at the 3= termini had
100% conservation; the remaining nucleotides were conserved in
segments 5 to 9. Nucleotide sequences showed complementary
features at the 5= and 3= termini. Predicted molecular and bio-
chemical features for individual viral segments are provided in
Table 1. Mass spectrometry of virus isolated from E-11 cells con-
firmed the ORFs and coding peptides predicted for segments 2 to
10. No protein sequence was detected that represented segment 1
(Table 1; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). ORFs pre-

 dicted from segment 5 and segment 6 contained signal peptide
cleavage sites between aa 25/26 and 30/31, respectively.
High-throughput sequencing and alignment analyses of a
TiLV PCR-positive sample from a fish in Ecuador showed 97.20 to
99.00% nucleotide identity and 98.70 to 100% amino acid identity
to the corresponding coding region of nucleotide sequences ob-
tained with samples from Israel (Table 2).
Northern hybridization experiments indicate that TiLV is a
segmented RNA virus. The segmented nature of TiLV and the
sizes of specific segments were confirmed in Northern hybridiza-
tion analyses of extracts from E-11 cells infected with TiLV (brain
isolate) (Fig. 2A) and from liver of infected fish (Fig. 2B), using 10
segment-specific, discrete probes.
In situ hybridization. To investigate the presence of TiLV
RNA in diseased fish, we applied in situ hybridization techniques
to both liver and brain samples with TiLV-specific probes. In the
brain, hybridization signals for segment 1 genomic RNA (Fig. 3A,
arrowheads) and mRNA (Fig. 3B, arrowheads) were confined to
the leptomeninges, mostly adjacent to blood vessels. Similar re-
sults were obtained for genomic RNA and mRNA of segment 5
(data not shown). No hybridization signal was detected in sections
of brains of uninfected healthy controls (naive fish) of approxi-
mately the same age collected from a different breeding facility in
Israel (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). In the liver,
hybridization signal for segment 3 mRNA was detected in hepa-
tocytes. Many nuclei were clustered, suggesting the formation of
multinucleated cells (Fig. 3C and D). To image infected cells with
high resolution, E-11 cultures were infected with TiLV, hybridized
with segment 3-derived probes to detect viral mRNA, and imaged.
TiLV mRNA was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of
multiple cells (Fig. 3E and F). No viral mRNA was detected in
noninfected control cells (see Fig. S2B).
TiLV has a negative-sense genome. Based on sequence and
RNA hybridization analysis, we postulated that TiLV has a
negative-sense genome. Accordingly, a deproteinized genome
should not be infectious. RNA was purified from TiLV virion pel-
lets or from TiLV-infected E-11 cells and was transfected into
naive E-11 cells. For positive controls, naive E-11 cells were trans-
fected with nervous necrosis virus (NNV [a positive-sense, seg-
mented RNA virus of fish]) RNA extracts from NNV-infected cells
or from NNV virions. No cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed
following transfection of deproteinized TiLV RNA extracted from
cells or virions (Fig. 4A and D), similar to the lack of cytopathic
effect upon transfection of control RNA extracted from naive E-11
cell culture (Fig. 4C), from pellets of the culture supernatant
(Fig. 4F), or in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4G). In contrast, trans-
fection of deproteinized NNV RNA, extracted from infected cells
(Fig. 4B) or from virions (Fig. 4E), resulted in cytopathic effect in
E-11 cells.
FIG 1 Genomic characterization of the segments of TiLV isolated from tilapia in Israel. (A) TiLV segment 1 putative protein shows weak homology to motifs
conserved in RNA-dependent polymerases. Sequence comparison of TiLV’s segment 1 predicted protein with motifs I to IV, conserved in polymerases of
influenza virus strains C/JJ/50 (Inf C) (19), A/WSN/33 (Inf A) (34), and B/Lee/40 (Inf B) (35), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (20), human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) (21), and poliovirus (Polio) (22). The relative motif positions are also shown. Invariant sequences in each motif are in boldface and underlined. TiLV
sequences that show identity to one of the influenza virus sequences are highlighted in yellow. (B) Genomic segments of TiLV show conserved and homologous

 DISCUSSION
This study was undertaken to characterize the molecular biology,
pathogenesis, and partial geographic distribution of TiLV, a novel
virus recently implicated in large die-offs of tilapia in Israel and
Ecuador (Fig. 3G) (12, 13). Efforts to classify TiLV through clas-
sical sequence homology analyses of sequences obtained from in-
fected fish and cultured cells had failed; thus, we pursued North-
ern hybridization, mass spectrometry, and in situ hybridization to
identify and correlate the presence of candidate viral genes and
proteins. Results presented here indicate that TiLV is an RNA
virus with a genome comprised of 10 unique segments. The largest
segment has minimal homology to the PB1 segment of the ortho-
myxovirus influenza virus C. It also contains the major polymer-
ase motifs (19). We speculate therefore that segment 1 encodes the
polymerase of TiLV. The other 9 segments have no apparent ho-
mology to other known viral sequences; however, the presence of
complementary sequences at their termini and identification of
proteins in extracts of infected cells that correlate with the ORFs
they carry provide evidence that they represent gene segments of
TiLV. Sequence analyses provide no insight into their functions in
the TiLV life cycle. In situ hybridization experiments indicated a
nuclear site for transcription.
It is likely that TiLV will ultimately be classified as representing
a new genus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. As noted above, the
5= and 3= noncoding termini of TiLV include 13 nucleotides that
are similar in all segments. This organization resembles that ob-
served for the influenza, Thogoto, and infectious salmon anemia
orthomyxoviruses (24–27) and enables base pairing and forma-
tion of secondary structures important for replication, transcrip-
tion, and packaging of viral RNA. In addition, all of the 5= ends of
TiLV genomic RNA segments contain a short, uninterrupted uri-
dine stretch (3 to 5 bases long). This feature is reminiscent of the
stretch of 5 to 7 uridine residues found in other orthomyxoviruses,
on which the viral polymerase “stutters” while generating poly(A)
tails (28, 29).
The presence of viral nucleic acid at sites of pathology in brain
and liver together with the observation that virus propagated in
cell culture is capable of inducing disease in naive fish implicates
TiLV as the causative agent of outbreaks of both viral encephalitis
and syncytial hepatitis in tilapiines in Israel and Ecuador. The fact
that TiLV has been detected in association with disease in two
geographically disparate sites underscores that TiLV poses a global
threat to tilapiine aquaculture. We have no evidence that TiLV can
infect other species; however, the genetic dissimilarity of TiLV to
other viruses suggests the potential for discovery of related viruses
as TiLV sequences are employed for phylogenetic analysis.

FIG 2 Northern hybridization analysis indicates that TiLV is a segmented
RNA virus. (A) Total RNA extracted from E-11 cells 6 days postinfection with
TiLV from brains of tilapia in Israel (lanes 3, 6, and 9), from virions that were
pelleted from the culture supernatant (lanes 4, 7, and 10), or from noninfected
E-11 cells (lanes 2, 5, and 8). (B) Total RNA extracted from livers of tilapia in
Ecuador (lanes 12 to 14). The extracts were hybridized to probe mixtures
representing segments 1, 4, 7, and 10 (probe mixture 1 [lanes 2 to 4 and 12]),
segments 2, 6, and 9 (probe mixture 2 [lanes 5 to 7 and 13]), or segments 3, 5,
and 8 (probe mixture 3 [lanes 8 to 10 and 14]) to prevent signal overlap from
segments of similar sizes. Influenza A virus RNA (A/Moscow/10/99) hybrid-
ized with three probes representing hemagglutinin (HA) (1,780 nt), NA (1450

 mina HiSeq 2500 and PGM Ion Torrent platforms. For library prepara-
tions, total RNA was extracted from purified virus particles and infected
fish brain tissue samples with TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). RNA extractions from TiLV-infected tissues included postextrac-
tion DNase I (2 U/�g DNA for 15 min at 370C; Thermo, Fisher, Waltham,
MA) and depletion of rRNA sequences with RiboZero magnetic kits (Il-
lumina, San Diego, CA). High-throughput sequencing was performed in
parallel on random-primed cDNA preparations from purified virus and
infected brain tissue RNA. Sequencing from purified virus on the Illumina
HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) resulted in an average of ~200 million
reads (100 nucleotides [nt]) per sample. Total RNA was reverse tran-
scribed using SuperScript III (Thermo, Fisher) with random hexamers.
The cDNA was RNase H treated prior to second-strand synthesis with
Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The resulting
double-stranded cDNA mix was sheared to an average fragment size of
200 bp using the manufacturer’s standard settings (E210 focused ultra-
sonicator; Covaris, Woburn, MA). Sheared product was purified (Axy-
Prep Mag PCR cleanup beads; Axygen/Corning, Corning, NY), and li-
braries were constructed using KAPA library preparation kits (KAPA,
Wilmington, MA) with 6-nt bar code adapters. The quality and quantity
of libraries were checked using Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Samples were demultiplexed using Illumina-supplied CASAVA software
and exported as FastQ files. More than 90% of Illumina reads passed the
Q30 filter. Demultiplexed FastQ files were assembled to generate reads,
contigs, and clusters. Sequencing on the Ion Torrent PGM platform was
performed with Ion PGM Sequencing 200 kits on Ion 318 chips (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), yielding on average ~2 million reads per
sample, with a mean length of 177 nt. For Ion Torrent, cDNA prepara-
tions were sheared (Ion Shear Plus kit; Life Technologies) for an average
fragment size of 200 bp and added to Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beck-
man Coulter, Brea, CA) for purification, libraries were prepared with
KAPA library preparation/Ion Torrent series kits (KAPA), and emulsion

 PCR was performed with Ion PGM Template OT2 200 kits (Life Technol-
ogies). Ion Torrent reads were demultiplexed and exported as FastQ files
by the Ion Torrent PGM software. After bar code and adaptor trimming,
length filtering, masking of low-complexity regions, and subtraction of
ribosomal and host sequences, reads were mapped as described for Illu-
mina data.
Mass spectrometry. TiLV virions were purified by ultracentrifugation
through 25% (wt/vol) sucrose cushions. The samples were trypsinized
and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) on Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were identified
by Discoverer software version 1.4, using the Sequest search engine, the
Uniprot database, and the putative TiLV proteins as references. All of
these analyses were performed at the Smoler Proteomics Center, Tech-
nion, Israel.
Northern hybridization analysis. Fragments representing each seg-
ment were amplified by PCR using primers shown in Table S2 in the
supplemental material. Amplified PCR products were purified with
QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and labeled with
biotin with the Deca Label DNA labeling kit (Thermo, Fisher Scientific)
(30). RNA was extracted from E-11 cells infected with TiLV from brains of
tilapia from Israel and from livers of infected tilapia from Ecuador. RNA
extracts were size fractionated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 1.5%
agarose gel, transferred to Biobond-Plus nylon transfer membrane
(Sigma-Aldrich), and UV cross-linked. Membranes were hybridized
overnight in a low-shaker incubator with biotinylated probe combos (1 or
2 and 3) at 65°C in 6� SSC (1� SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium
citrate) (31, 32). Biotin-labeled probes were detected with the chemilumi-
nescent nucleic acid detection module kit (Thermo, Fisher Scientific).
Blots were scanned with a C DiGit chemiluminescence blot scanner (LI
COR).
In situ hybridization. To detect TiLV RNA, in situ hybridizations
were performed with ViewRNA probes (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
and/or Stellaris fluorescent probes (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA)
in tissue sections and cultured infected or noninfected cells. Tissue sam-
ples were collected from euthanized infected or uninfected fish and fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Specimens were embedded in paraffin
and serially sectioned (5 �m thick), fixed in 10% formaldehyde (Fisher
Scientific), deparaffinized, boiled in pretreatment solution (Affymetrix),
and digested with proteinase K (Affymetrix). Sections were hybridized for
3 h at 40°C with custom-designed QuantiGene ViewRNA probes (Af-
fymetrix). Bound probes were then amplified per protocol from Af-
fymetrix using PreAmp and Amp molecules. Multiple-label probe oligo-
nucleotides conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (LP-AP type 1) were then
added, and Fast Red substrate was used to produce signal (red dots, Cy3
fluorescence). Infected and noninfected cultured cells, grown on 2%
gelatin-coated glass coverslips, were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde.
Negative-sense probes, derived from segment 3, labeled with Cy3 or with
Quasar 670 fluorophores, and compatible with the Stellaris system, were
constructed to detect TiLV mRNA (see Table S3 in the supplemental
material). When applied, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4=,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole). Sections were examined by light microscopy
(Axio Scope.A1; Carl Zeiss), fluorescence microscopy (Nikon TE200 or
Zeiss Axiovert 200 M), and confocal microscopy with three-dimensional
(3D) image reconstruction (33).
Infectivity of deproteinized RNA. Confluent E-11 cell cultures in 25-
cm2 flasks were infected, or not, with TiLV or NNV (one flask per virus).
Cells and culture supernatants were collected upon the appearance of
cytopathic effect (CPE) (2 or 3 days postinfection for NNV or TiLV, re-
spectively). Deproteinized RNA was prepared from cells using EZ-RNA
reagent (Biological Industries, Israel), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Supernatants were cleared by centrifugation (200 � g at
room temperature for 5 min), and virions were pelleted by ultracentrifu-
gation (107,000 � g at 4°C for 2 h) through a 25% (wt/vol) sucrose cush-
ion. Each pellet was resuspended in 140 �l phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and deproteinized RNA was extracted using QIAamp viral RNA
isolation kit (Qiagen). E-11 cells (~80% confluence in 6-well plates) were
transfected with the 2.5 �g of cellular deproteinized RNA or with the
entire deproteinized virion RNA preparation, using the TransIT-mRNA
transfection kit (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI).
