Abstract
Background—Understanding patterns of relapse in antidepressant treatment responders can 
inform strategies for preventing relapse.
Methods—We re-analyzed individual-patient data from four double-blind discontinuation 
clinical trials of duloxetine or fluoxetine vs. placebo in major depression (N=1462). Trajectories of 
depression severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores) were identified in the entire 
sample, and separately in arms where antidepressant had been continued or discontinued. 
Predictors of trajectory membership were assessed.
Findings—We identified similar “relapse” trajectories and two trajectories of stable depression 
scores in the normal range on active medication and on placebo. Active treatment (OR=0.47, 95% 
CI: (0.37, 0.61)) significantly lowered the odds of membership in the “relapse” trajectory whereas 
female sex (OR=1.56, 95% CI: (1.23, 2.06)), shorter length of time with clinical response 
(OR=1.10, 95% CI: (1.06, 1.15)) and higher Clinical Global Impressions score at baseline 
(OR=1.28, 95% CI: (1.01, 1.62)) increased the odds. Overall, the protective effect of 
antidepressant medication relative to placebo on the risk of being classified as a relapser was about 
13% (46% vs. 33%).
Interpretation—The existence of similar relapse trajectories on active medication and on 
placebo suggests that there is no specific relapse signature associated with antidepressant 
discontinuation. Furthermore, continued treatment offers only a modest protection against relapse. 
These data highlight the need for incorporating treatment strategies that prevent relapse as part of 
the treatment of depression.
Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) typically follows a recurrent course 1. On average, 
individuals with a history of depression who respond to treatment have a 30-50% chance of 
relapse within one year2 and they will have five to nine separate episodes in their lifetime3. 
The risk of relapse is reduced by maintenance interventions including pharmacotherapy4 or 
psychosocial treatments5. Clinical trials evaluating relapse prevention approaches generally 
attempt to reduce the proportion of patients who relapse within a pre-determined time period 
(i.e., 4-6 months), where relapse is defined as surpassing a cut-point on an aggregate severity 
scale (i.e., Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score ≥ 14). However, it has been noted that 
this transformation of continuous data to categorical data (i.e. “relapse” or “non-relapse”) 
can amplify small mean differences, which may obscure the evaluation of the clinical 
importance of therapeutic interventions6-8.
With this in mind, there has been a growing interest in using trajectory-based approaches to 
analyze clinical trial data, particularly in trials attempting to produce an initial remission of

 depression symptoms6-9. Trajectory-based models (e.g. latent class models10, and growth 
mixture models11) capture heterogeneity in the development of clinical outcomes during an 
intervention, and this more sensitive approach can result in trial outcomes that differ from 
traditional endpoint measures8,12. Additionally, they enable the identification of distinct 
classes of time-dependent treatment responses and the evaluation of treatment effects upon 
trajectory membership. This approach has identified distinct classes of antidepressant 
response trajectory, including rapid or gradual improvement8, transient improvement 
followed by symptom worsening9, or “non-responders” who do more poorly on medication 
than placebo6.
Far less is known, however, about trajectories of relapse for patients who initially responded 
to treatment and who either continued or discontinued medication treatment. To study this 
issue, we applied growth mixture modeling to identify distinct trajectories of HAMD scores 
using individual patient level data pooled from four randomized double-blind placebo-
controlled discontinuation trials of duloxetine and fluoxetine. In particular, we explored 
whether similar or different trajectory classes exist for patients who continued active 
treatment or who discontinued active treatment, and tested whether there were clinical 
predictors of trajectory class membership. Applied in this context, these methods provided 
new insights into the stability of clinical response and the trajectory of relapse to depression.
Methods
Sample
We analyzed data from four randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
discontinuation clinical trials of duloxetine and fluoxetine for MDD conducted by Eli Lilly 
prior to 2012. Table 1 describes the studies, arms, sample sizes and duration. Four different 
protocols were followed (protocol identifiers HCIZ, HCEX, HMBC and HMDI). All studies 
incorporated an open-label acute treatment phase with either duloxetine or fluoxetine and a 
double-blind discontinuation phase where patients continued their medication or received 
placebo. Two of the studies (HCIZ and HMBC) had an optional rescue phase that was not 
included in this analysis. Flow-charts of the protocols and a summary of inclusion/exclusion 
criteria are included in the supplemental materials (Figures S1-S4). Results from time-to-
relapse analyses are published elsewhere13-16 (Table S1). We modelled trajectories of 
relapse up to 26 weeks during double-blind treatment. Data were aligned so that the 
following time points were used: weeks 0, 2, 4, 10, 16, 22 and 26 (Table S2).
Statistical analysis methods
The outcome variable was total score on the 17-item HAMD scale. We used growth mixture 
modeling11 to identify distinct trajectories of HAMD scores during treatment 
discontinuation. We first fitted models to the entire sample and then fitted separate models to 
the placebo and active arms separately. The latter analyses were used to evaluate whether 
different classes would emerge for subjects in the active arms and in the placebo arms. We 
considered linear and quadratic trends over time and up to four trajectory classes. The 
selection of the best model was based on the Schwartz-Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
and on the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR)17. The LMR test compares the fit

 of a model with two or more classes to a model with one fewer class in order to identify the 
optimal number of classes. We only considered models where the smallest class had at least 
5% of the total subjects so that the resulting model would be meaningful clinically and 
stable numerically. Classification confidence was assessed using the entropy value ranging 
between 0 and 1, with higher values corresponding to higher confidence in latent class 
assignments.
To evaluate whether the resulting trajectories were consistent across the different trials, we 
also performed separate trajectory analyses by protocol. In this secondary analysis, treatment 
was included as a predictor in the entire sample and by protocol in order to assess whether 
there were significant treatment effects on trajectory membership.
Trajectories during discontinuation were classified as “relapse” vs. “non-relapse”. We 
assessed the association between the most likely trajectory classification of the individuals 
and a simple categorical indicator of relapse (HAMD ≥ 14 at the last available assessment 
point) using Fisher's exact tests and conditional probabilities.
Weighted logistic regression was performed to assess the effects of treatment (during open-
label and during the double-blind discontinuation phase), length of time with clinical 
response and subject characteristics on membership in a particular class. Study protocol was 
not included because it was confounded with treatment and is not useful as a predictor 
outside of these data. Interactions between treatment and the covariates were considered in 
order to assess potential moderating effects, but were dropped from the final model because 
they were not statistically significant. We calculated the length of time with clinical response 
as the number of weeks between randomization and time when HAMD score fell below 10 
during the open-label phase. Other characteristics included sex, age, age of onset of first 
episode, number of previous episodes (0, 1 or 2, 3 or 4, 5 or more, missing) and CGI-
severity score at randomization to discontinuation treatment. The weights were the posterior 
probabilities of membership in the assigned class. The association of each predictor with 
trajectory membership was also tested one at a time using t-tests, chi-square tests or Fisher's 
exact tests. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate effect sizes for 
the different predictors.
We also performed weighted logistic regression with the same predictors but with the simple 
clinical definition of relapse (HAMD score of 14 or higher) in order to assess the robustness 
of predictors of relapse to the definition of relapse. Identification of latent trajectory classes 
was performed using MPlus9 and all other analyses were conducted in SAS.
Results
In the entire sample, as well as in the samples receiving active medication and placebo 
during the discontinuation phase, we selected the models with three trajectory classes (Table 
2). The models with three trajectory classes fit better according to both the BIC and the 
LMR statistic than the models with fewer classes in all analyses. Models with more than 
three classes could not be estimated reliably (i.e., the best-likelihood value could not 
replicated, the estimated variance-covariance matrix in one or more classes was not positive

 definite or the number of subjects per class was less than 5%) and hence are not presented. 
Separate analyses of the studies also identified three trajectory classes with similar shapes 
over time (Figures S5-S8).
Figure 1 shows the estimated and sample means for the three trajectory classes over time for 
the samples on active medication and on placebo. The trajectory classes in the entire sample 
were very similar. The two classes on the bottom of both figure panels show flat HAMD 
trajectories over time well below the symptomatic range (HAMD scores below 5) with 
slightly more separation between the two classes on active medication than on placebo. We 
refer to these classes as “non-relapse” classes. They differ slightly in their mean scores but 
also there are more fluctuations in scores over time in the higher non-relapse class than in 
the lower relapse class (Figure S9). The third class shows rapidly increasing HAMD scores 
(to above 10) during the discontinuation phase with slightly higher scores on placebo but the 
shape of these trajectories in subjects on active medication and on placebo are very similar. 
We refer to this class as the “relapse” class. HAMD data on subjects after they meet clinical 
criteria for relapse in the studies are not reported, as they entered “rescue” treatment. As a 
result, the sample mean trajectories for the “relapse” class are somewhat below the estimated 
mean trajectories for the same class in all analyses. However, it is unlikely that missing data 
influences the reported findings substantially (specifically the separation of relapse vs. non-
relapse trajectories), as growth mixture models provide valid results under the assumption 
that data are randomly missing and trajectory up until relapse predicts the loss of data. 
Sensitivity analysis using pattern-mixture models9 investigating stability of latent classes 
under missing not at random assumptions failed to identify stable trajectory classes.
The estimated probability of membership in the relapse class is 45.8% on placebo and 
33.1% on active medication. Almost all (944 out of 947, 99.7%) of patients who were 
classified as non-relapsers based on the trajectory analysis with trajectories 1 and 2 
combined, did not relapse according to the simpler clinical relapse criterion of a HAMD 
score of 14 or higher. The percentages were almost the same when calculated by treatment 
group: 99.5% (660 out of 663) on active medication and 100% (all 284 individuals) on 
placebo. More than two thirds (365 out of 515, 70.9%) of the individuals most likely to 
follow the “relapse” trajectory relapsed according to the simpler clinical definition of 
relapse, with a higher rate for individuals on placebo (75.2%, 164 out of 218) than for 
individuals on active medication (67.7%, 201 out of 297). Thus almost a third of individuals 
on active medication (32.3%, 96 out of 297) and about a quarter of the subjects on placebo 
(24.8%, 54 out of 218) who were following the relapse trajectory did not meet traditional 
clinical definitions of relapse. Those individuals had on average lower mean depression 
scores than those who relapsed according to both definitions (Figure S10).
Univariate associations between the trajectory classes identified in the joint analysis of 
active and placebo arms (grouped as “relapse” vs. “non-relapse”) and treatments, study 
protocol and covariates are provided in Table 3. When adjusting for uncertainty in trajectory 
membership and other covariates, active treatment during discontinuation halved the odds of 
following the relapse trajectory (OR=0.47, 95% CI: (0.37, 0.61)) while female gender 
(OR=1.56, 95% CI: (1.23, 2.06)), shorter length of time with clinical response by 1 week 
(OR=1.10, 95% CI: (1.06, 1.15)) and higher CGI severity by 1 (OR=1.28, 95% CI: (1.01,

 1.62)) significantly increased the odds of following the relapse trajectory. Accuracy in 
predicting whether a patient would be in the relapse trajectory or not was reasonable (AUC = 
66%, Figure S11), especially given the small number of baseline predictors available for 
analysis. The results from the weighted logistic regression with simple HAMD remission 
definition (HAMD score of 14 or more) were very similar (see Table 4).
Discussion
The protective effect of antidepressant medications on depressive relapse is a cornerstone of 
psychiatry and one that has yielded the recommendation that patients with recurrent 
depression remain on antidepressant treatment for the remainder of their lives18,19. This 
study analyzed data from four clinical trials aimed at evaluating the risk for relapse when 
patients who had responded to treatment with fluoxetine or duloxetine were blindly 
maintained on their medication or switched to placebo. The principal finding was that 
trajectory-based analyses revealed the same three response trajectories in patients who 
stayed on their medications or were switched to placebo. This suggests that there is no 
specific relapse signature associated with antidepressant discontinuation.
The first two trajectories we identified constituted the majority of patients, showed sustained 
clinical response over 26 weeks, and respected traditional symptom thresholds for remission 
extremely closely. Individuals in the lowest severity trajectory had low scores and low 
variability of scores from visit to visit. The middle severity trajectory showed more score 
instability and slightly higher depression scores (still in the subclinical range). Since both 
groups had good outcomes we did not explore differences in characteristics between them in 
this study. Our main focus was on the relapse trajectory of increasing depression scores, in 
which about 46% of patients treated with placebo and 33% of patients treated with active 
medication were categorized.
Within the relapse trajectory, over 70% of patients also met symptomatic criteria for relapse 
but close to 30% did not. Trajectories of relapse may be informative even if clinical relapse 
criteria are not met, since prediction of trajectory membership could occur early on and 
since clinical relapse criteria are somewhat arbitrary. Patients who follow a relapse trajectory 
but do not meet criteria may have effectively relapsed nonetheless or may be at an increased 
risk of relapse in the future. Although on average this group had lower depression scores 
than the group of individuals identified as relapsers by both the trajectory and clinical 
criteria in this study, the absence of longer term follow-up data precluded us from comparing 
their longer term outcomes. Future studies are needed to evaluate this question.
The high rate of relapse suggests that short-term antidepressant response is not very stable 
and the similarity of relapse trajectories on active medication and on placebo indicates that 
the temporal dynamic of mood regulation is not altered by SRI treatment. Approximately a 
third of the patients in this study followed the relapse trajectory, which is consistent with the 
findings of other studies5,20. Nevertheless, this should not be interpreted as evidence to 
downplay the benefit of SRIs during the initial episode. Furthermore, SRIs appeared to 
protect against the natural tendency to relapse during maintenance, i.e. they make patients 
more resilient. The likelihood of relapse was also related to length of time with clinical

 response 21, level of residual symptoms21, and was greater for women than men22. One 
possible explanation for these observations suggests that the efficacy of SRI antidepressants 
continues to be consolidated long after initial symptom reductions have occurred. At the 
moment, we do not understand this consolidation process, although structural 
neurobiological changes might be one part of it. It is striking that short-term antidepressant 
response is not particularly stable but that demonstration of long-term antidepressant 
efficacy is not required for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One 
wonders whether it would be valuable to expect evidence of long-term efficacy when new 
antidepressants are approved by the FDA. This concern is somewhat reduced by evidence 
that early antidepressant response is a relatively strong predictor of later response 23.
The current study suggests that SRI antidepressants have only a modest protective effect 
against relapse relative to placebo, as reflected in an approximately 13% difference in the 
likelihood of being in the relapse trajectory. This suggests that SRI treatment by itself leaves 
many patients at risk and specific strategies for preventing relapse should be more widely 
implemented in depression treatment. In the future, one hopes that this research can be 
extended by identifying moderators of treatment effects. That is, to ultimately identify the 
type and intensity of treatment that would maximize the probability of a desired outcome for 
that specific patient. Until then, non-specific predictors are still useful for setting prior 
expectations about clinically relevant outcomes, e.g. relapse or initial treatment 
response 23,24. The application of machine learning methods to a much broader array of 
predictive markers has proven successful in other areas of psychiatry, particularly predicting 
treatment outcomes23,25
In light of the current data, it may be important to develop new and more cost effective 
psychosocial treatments to reduce depression relapse in order to ensure widespread 
implementation. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), for example, decreases depression 
relapse26, but it does not appear to reduce treatment costs19 and it is less effective in 
preventing relapse in patients who did not respond to IPT alone, but did respond when 
pharmacotherapy was added27. The development of more effective pharmacologic relapse 
prevention strategies might also improve outcomes for patients with unipolar depression. 
Lithium, for example, reduces relapse for mood disorders overall, but does not show clear 
efficacy in preventing relapse for patients with unipolar depression28. More broadly, the 
strategic integration of psychotherapy and medication for relapse prevention is a critical 
issue for patients and for the field29, especially in avoiding common clinical problems 
associated with long-term antidepressant treatment30.
One potential limitation of three of the four protocols is the absence of rigorous measures of 
antidepressant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms for duloxetine and fluoxetine 
most commonly include dizziness, nausea, headache, but may also include worsening of 
anxiety or depression31. Some withdrawal symptoms may persist for several weeks after 
antidepressant discontinuation32. Fluoxetine has among the longest half-life from among the 
SRI medications, i.e., up to 3 days which may protect patients from some withdrawal 
symptoms, while duloxetine has a much shorter elimination half-life (approximately 10 
hours) and would therefore be viewed as having more potential to produce withdrawal 
symptoms. However, we did not observe a trajectory consistent with the emergence and

 abatement of withdrawal symptoms on placebo. This may be at least partially attributable to 
the fact that some studies tapered off antidepressant medications over several weeks, which 
could have further limited the impact of post-discontinuation symptoms on the results. 
Indeed, this makes the results more reflective of clinical practice. These findings reduce our 
concern that the results were substantially contaminated by the appearance of antidepressant 
withdrawal symptoms.
This study has other limitations. Firstly, there is a potential for expectancy bias since the 
analyses are based on discontinuation studies which may carry some greater expectation of 
relapse. Secondly, we did not have data available about these patients to adjust for 
intercurrent major life stress, which contributes to relapse while treated with medications33. 
Thirdly, patients exited the study upon relapse (to move into a rescue phase), which is likely 
why predicted trajectories for the relapse class are slightly inflated relative to the observed 
mean trajectories9. Fourthly, quadratic models do not capture the curvature in the relapse 
trajectory very well. More complicated models such as latent basis growth mixture models 
could provide better fit34. Lastly, we had a limited number of predictors to relate to relapse 
trajectories thus there might be much stronger predictors that might be useful in reducing the 
probability of relapse35. In particular, other biological factors may contribute to the 
association between elevated CGI, gender and depression. Important future work will be to 
identify additional predictors of relapse, and other clinical features associated with these 
relapse trajectories in line with the NIMH RDoC framework, as well as eventually 
advancing our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms related to relapse.
Conclusion
The similarity of trajectories on active medication and on placebo suggests that there is no 
specific relapse signature associated with antidepressant discontinuation. The current study 
supports the continued prescription of SRI antidepressants to protect against relapse of 
depression. However, it suggests that this protective effect is less than one might have 
expected. Patients and providers should be prepared for the possibility that as many as one 
of three patients who initially respond to an antidepressant will worsen over the subsequent 
six months, which justifies a more widespread effort at preventing relapse in patients with 
unipolar major depression.

 Research in Context
Evidence before this study
Discontinuation trials, in which patients are randomized to stay on an effective treatment 
or to blindly discontinue this treatment, provide unique insights into the stability of 
antidepressant response. We searched PubMed from inception to Jan 10, 2017 with the 
terms (“depression” OR “major depressive disorder”) AND “discontinuation” AND 
“trial” in any field, with no language restrictions. We retrieved and scanned 833 articles, 
then focused on the 346 articles in which (“depression” OR “major depressive disorder”) 
was in the title. All articles that we deemed not to be relevant on the basis of their titles 
were excluded. Abstracts of the remaining articles were reviewed to identify potentially 
relevant articles, and, on the basis of this selection, we read full-text articles.
Epidemiological and clinical evidence indicates that major depressive disorder (MDD) 
typically follows a recurrent course, with one-third to one-half of patients relapsing 
within one year of discontinuation. Clinical trials that examine relapse prevention 
approaches generally attempt to reduce the proportion of patients who relapse within a 
pre-determined time period (i.e., 4-6 months), where relapse is defined as surpassing a 
cut-point on an aggregate severity scale (i.e., Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score 
≥ 14). However, it has been noted that this transformation of continuous data to 
categorical data (i.e. “relapse” or “non-relapse”) can amplify small mean differences, 
which may obscure the evaluation of the clinical importance of therapeutic interventions.
Trajectory-based models (i.e. latent class based approaches) provide a data-driven 
method to identify distinct classes of time-dependent treatment responses, and for 
evaluating the effect of treatment upon trajectory membership. This approach has 
identified distinct classes of antidepressant response trajectories, including rapid or 
gradual improvement, transient improvement followed by symptom worsening, or “non-
responders” who do more poorly on medication than placebo. However, to our 
knowledge this approach has not been used to identify distinct trajectories during 
discontinuation clinical trials.
Added value of this study
The objective of the study was to estimate trajectories of relapse in responders to 
antidepressant treatment for major depression who remained on active treatment or were 
switched to placebo. We analyzed individual-patient level data from four double-blind 
randomized placebo controlled discontinuation clinical trials of fluoxetine or duloxetine. 
We identified the same three patterns over time across multiple double-blind treatment 
continuation or discontinuation studies, i.e. we found no evidence that there are distinct 
trajectories of relapse during discontinuation on active medication and on placebo. 
Compared to a simple clinical definition of relapse (depression severity of 14 points or 
above on the HAMD), the trajectory approach identified individuals likely to follow a 
relapse trajectory who do not meet simpler criteria for relapse.
The protective effect of antidepressant continuation treatment was modest, with only 
about 13% difference between the estimated proportion of individuals following a relapse

 trajectory on active medication (33%) vs. placebo (46%). In addition to treatment, female 
sex, shorter time with clinical response and poorer Clinical Global Impression score at 
baseline all predicted that a patient would be in the “relapse” trajectory. In summary, this 
study identified trajectories of relapse, predictors of patterns of increasing HAMD scores, 
and provided evidence for a statistically significant but a modest protective effect of 
antidepressant treatment.
Implications of all the available evidence
Clinical implications
It is important for providers and consumers of depression treatment to understand the 
actual benefits of antidepressant treatments. For example, the STAR*D study suggested 
that one in three patients will have a full clinical response to their initial antidepressant. 
The current study suggests that about one-third of clinical responders will relapse even if 
they continue with the medication that produced their initial clinical response, while 
nearly 50% of patients will experience a return of depression symptoms if they stop their 
medications. However, the protective effect of continued medication is much smaller, 
only 13%, than one might have expected or hoped for. These findings suggest that 
strategies for reducing or forestalling the return of depression symptoms need to be 
developed and widely implemented in depression treatment.
Methodological implications
Latent class techniques can be used for data-driven identification of patterns of 
depression severity during acute and discontinuation treatment. Our results confirm 
previous research using simple dichotomous definitions of response that the majority of 
patients maintain clinical response regardless of whether they continue active medication. 
Future studies to identify predictors of trajectories of relapse are indicated.
