Abstract
Background—I-SPY2, a standing, multicenter, adaptive phase 2 neoadjuvant trial ongoing in 
high-risk clinical stage II/III breast cancer, is designed to evaluate multiple, novel experimental 
agents added to standard chemotherapy for their ability to improve the rate of pathologic complete 
response (pCR). Experimental therapies are compared against a common control arm. We report 
efficacy for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib.
Methods—Eligible women had ≥2.5 cm stage II/III breast cancer, categorized into 8 biomarker 
subtypes based on HER2, hormone-receptor status (HR), and MammaPrint. Neratinib was 
evaluated for 10 signatures (prospectively defined subtype combinations), with primary endpoint 
pCR. MR volume changes inform likelihood of pCR for each patient prior to surgery. Adaptive 
assignment to experimental arms within disease subtype was based on current Bayesian 
probabilities of superiority over control. Accrual to experimental arm stop at any time for futility 
or graduation within a particular signature based on Bayesian predictive probability of success in a 
confirmatory trial. The maximum sample size in any experimental arm is 120 patients,
Results—With 115 patients and 78 concurrently randomized controls, neratinib graduated in the 
HER2+/HR− signature, with mean pCR rate 56% (95% PI: 37 to 73%) vs 33% for controls (11 to 
54%). Final predictive probability of success, updated when all pathology data were available, was 
79%.
Conclusion—Adaptive, multi-armed trials can efficiently identify responding tumor subtypes. 
Neratinib added to standard therapy is highly likely to improve pCR rates in HER2+/HR2212; 
breast cancer. Confirmation in I-SPY 3, a phase 3 neoadjuvant registration trial, is planned.
INTRODUCTION
The treatment of aggressive, locally advanced breast cancers increasingly includes 
neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection, providing a window of opportunity to learn 
to better tailor treatments based upon early assessments of the molecular characteristics of 
the cancer. The existence of a well characterized, surrogate endpoint – pathologic complete 
response (pCR) assessed at the time of surgery – that is strongly correlated with both event-
free and overall survival, makes neoadjuvant therapy an ideal setting for rapid clinical 
development of targeted therapies. The I-SPY 2 trial provides a standing, or ‘platform’ trial 
framework to capitalize on this unique opportunity, by employing adaptive randomization 
for efficient, focused clinical development of paired therapies and biomarkers. The overall

 trial objective is to reduce the cost, time, and number of patients needed to identify effective 
drugs to treat aggressive, locally advanced breast cancer.1,2
In I-SPY 2, patients are randomized to one of several experimental arms, each evaluating a 
novel agent in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, compared to a 
common standard of care control. The adaptive randomization algorithm utilizes both the 
molecular characteristics of the cancers and incorporates accumulated outcome data to more 
efficiently identify tumor subtype signatures – combinations of molecular subtypes - in 
which specific agents are most effective. Agents reaching predefined thresholds of efficacy 
in one or more specific signatures are said to ‘graduate’.
Here we report the efficacy and safety results from the experimental arm of I-SPY 2 
evaluating neratinib, an irreversible pan-ErbB/HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor. I-SPY 2 
investigators have also described results of the graduated veliparib/carboplatin arm and 
MK-2206.3,4 Evaluations of other experimental arms have been completed or are ongoing in 
I-SPY 2.
Neratinib (HKI-272) is a potent, irreversible small molecule inhibitor of the ErbB/HER 
kinase family (EGFR/HER2/HER4) that has shown promising activity against HER2+ 
metastatic breast cancer.5,6 There is also evidence of preclinical activity against HER2-
negative tumor cells7,8, suggesting the possibility that pan-ErbB/HER kinase activity against 
EGFR and possibly HER4 might have activity beyond HER2+ tumors.9 The adaptive 
randomization approach used in I-SPY2 offers the ability to test this possibility while 
minimizing exposure of patients with HER2-tumors to treatments that are ineffective. 
Because neratinib was introduced prior to dual targeting of HER2 becoming standard of care 
in neoadjuvant treatment, it was tested against, rather than being combined with, 
trastuzumab. Although HER2-positive patients randomized to the experimental arm did not 
receive trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting, these patients received a full year of adjuvant 
trastuzumab as dictated by standard of care. Since graduating from I-SPY 2, neratinib has 
shown benefit as an extended or secondary adjuvant therapy for early stage high risk HER2+ 
breast cancer, following standard trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy.10
METHODS
Study Design
I-SPY 2 is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label, adaptive phase 2 ‘platform’ trial with 
multiple experimental arms that evaluate novel agents combined with standard neoadjuvant 
therapy in breast cancers at high risk of recurrence.11 Experimental treatments are compared 
against a common control arm, with the primary endpoint being pathologic complete 
response (pCR), which is defined as no residual cancer in either the breast or lymph nodes at 
time of surgery.12
Biomarker assessments (HER2, HR, MammaPrint) performed at baseline are used to 
classify patients into 2×2×2 = 8 prospectively defined subtypes for randomization purposes. 
HER2 was assessed by standard IHC and FISH assays, and a microarray-based assay of 
HER2 expression (TargetPrintTM), previously shown to have high concordance with 
Park et al.

 standard IHC and FISH assay.13 The adaptive randomization algorithm assigns patients with 
biomarker subtypes to competing drugs/arms based on current Bayesian probabilities of 
achieving pCR within that subtype vs control with 20% of patients assigned to control. 
Adaptive randomization speeds the identification of treatments that perform better within 
specific patient subtypes and helps avoid exposing patients to therapies that are unlikely to 
benefit them (Figure 1A).1,2
To assess efficacy, ten clinically relevant biomarker ‘signatures’ were defined in the 
protocol: All; HR+; HR−; HER2+; HER2−; MP Hi-2; HER2+/HR+; HER2+/HR−; 
HER2−/HR+; HER2−/HR−. Experimental arms are continually evaluated against control for 
each of these signatures and “graduate” when and if they demonstrate statistical superiority 
in pCR rate. Statistical analyses are Bayesian.14
Graduation requires an 85% Bayesian predictive probability of success in a 300-patient 
equally randomized neoadjuvant phase 3 trial with a traditional statistical design comparing 
to the same control arm as in I-SPY 2 and primary endpoint pCR (see Supplement).14,1 
Predictive probabilities of success are power calculations for a 300-patient trial averaged 
with respect to the current probability distributions of pCR rates for the experimental arm 
and control.1,14 The modest proposed size means that graduation occurs only when there is 
compelling evidence of an arm’s efficacy. Accrual to a graduating arm halts immediately, 
but all patients on the arm and its concurrent controls must complete surgery before 
graduation is announced. An experimental arm is dropped for futility if its predictive 
probability of success in a phase 3 trial <10% for all ten signatures. The maximum total 
number of patients assigned to any experimental arm is 120.
All participating sites received institutional review board approval. A data safety monitoring 
board meets monthly.
I-SPY 2 Eligibility and enrollment
I-SPY2 is open to women aged 18 and over, diagnosed with clinical stage II–III disease. 
Patients must have clinically or radiologically measureable disease in the breast, defined as 
longest diameter >2.5 cm. If a tumor meets this criteria by clinical exam only, the tumor 
must be >2 cm by imaging. Participants must have no prior cytotoxic treatment for this 
malignancy, ECOG performance status of 0–1, and be willing to consent to core biopsy and 
MRI. Patients with HR+/MP-low tumors are excluded because the potential benefit of 
chemotherapy is lower in patients with lower proliferative tumors and does not justify the 
risk of exposure to an investigational agents plus chemotherapy. HER2+ and HR− patients 
are eligible regardless of MP status.15
All patients provide written, informed consent in order to initiate I-SPY2 screening. If 
eligible, a second consent is obtained after random assignment and prior to treatment.
Treatment
All participants received standard neoadjuvant therapy consisting of 12 weekly cycles of 
80mg IV paclitaxel (T), followed by 4 cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and 
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (AC) IV every 2 to 3 weeks. This report compares patients

 who were randomized to also receive neratinib (240mg/day) for the first 12 weeks with 
control patients. Control patients who were HER2+ also received trastuzumab for the first 12 
weeks (loading dose 4mg/kg first cycle, followed by maintenance dose of 2mg/kg cycles 2–
12) (figure 1B). Subsequent surgery, including sentinel node dissection for node-negative 
and axillary node dissection for node-positive patients (at diagnosis), was performed 
according to NCCN and local practice guidelines. Radiation and endocrine adjuvant therapy 
was recommended following surgery using standard guidelines.
A protocol modification approved in January 2012 added a prophylactic course of 
loperamide to control diarrhea in patients receiving neratinib, beginning with 4mg on day 1 
of neratinib, 2 mg 8 hours later, and then 2 mg twice daily for two weeks. Patients were 
instructed to take an additional 2 mg immediately after the first unformed stool, then 2 mg 
every 4 hours until the absence of diarrhea for 12 consecutive hours (maximum 16 × 2 mg 
pills per day). The frequency of loperamide administration was decreased at patient 
discretion once the diarrhea was controlled.
Assessments
MRI and core biopsy are performed in all consented participants during screening and 
repeated 3 weeks after treatment began. MRI imaging is repeated between chemotherapy 
regimens, and prior to surgery. All surgical specimens are evaluated by pathologists trained 
to assess residual tumor burden (RCB). Biomarker assessments include the Agendia 70 gene 
MammaPrint and TargetPrint HER2 gene expression using the Agendia 44K full genome 
microarray and reverse phase phosphoprotein array. Patients are stratified into MammaPrint 
High1 (MP1) and MammaPrint High2 (MP2), determined by the predefined median cut-
point (−0.154) of I-SPY 1 participants who fit the eligibility criteria for I-SPY 2 
(Supplemental figure).16
Statistical Considerations
We report the final Bayesian probability distributions of pCR rates for the neratinib arm and 
its concurrently randomized controls for each of the 10 signatures by providing the 
estimated pCR rates (means of the final respective distributions) and 95% probability 
intervals. These distributions are based on the final observed results within the 8 biomarker 
subtypes using a covariate-adjusted logistic model where the covariates are HER2, HR, and 
MP. We do not provide the raw data within the individual biomarker subtypes because our 
analysis enables greater precision than would any raw-data estimates of pCR rate, whether 
within subtypes or across subtypes in signatures. Using the final distributions of pCR rates 
for each of the 10 signatures we give the probabilities that neratinib’s pCR rate is greater 
than the control rate as well as the respective predictive probabilities of future-trial success.
RESULTS
Patient Population
During the period of March 2010 to January 2013, 127 participants were enrolled and 
randomized to receive neratinib, of which 12 dropped out prior to receiving treatment,

 yielding 115 evaluable patients. Of 84 patients concurrently randomized to the control arm, 
78 were evaluable for pCR (Figure 1C).
Baseline patient characteristics (Table 1) show that the experimental and control arms were 
well balanced in their demographics, HR status and clinical presentation. Adaptive 
randomization resulted in an enriched population of HER2+ participants in the experimental 
vs. control arm (57% vs. 28%).
Efficacy
Figure 2 shows the Bayesian posterior probability distributions for 4 of the 10 signatures. 
Neratinib graduated in the HER2+/HR− signature (Table 2). As shown in Figure 2A, the 
estimated pCR rate of HER2+/HR− patients in the neratinib arm was 56% (95% PI: 37 to 
73%), compared to 33% (95% PI: 11 to 54%) in the (trastuzumab) control arm. The 
resulting probability that the neratinib arm was superior to the control arm was 95% and the 
probability of success for neratinib in a phase 3 clinical trial of 300 patients was 79%, as 
shown in Table 2.
Although neratinib graduated only in HER2+/HR−, as shown in Table 2, there was 
additional evidence of superior activity over control in several other signatures. In the 
HER2+/HR+ participants, estimated pCR rates were 30% vs. 17%, respectively (Figure 2C), 
with 91% probability of neratinib superiority over control and 65% predicted probability of 
phase 3 success. Similarly, over all HER2+ patients (regardless of HR status), the neratinib 
pCR rate outperformed the trastuzumab control by 39% versus 23% (Figure 2B), with 95% 
probability of superiority for the neratinib arm, and 73% predicted probability of success in 
a neoadjuvant phase 3 trial.
Patients identified as having the highest scores by the MammaPrint assay (MP2) also 
appeared to gain some benefit from neratinib over the trastuzumab control, with comparative 
pCR rates of 48% vs. 29% (Figure 2D), 93% probability of superiority over control 
treatment, and 72% predicted probability of success in a phase 3 trial. There was very little 
activity in the HR+HER2− and HR−HER2− patients, especially MP1 (Table 2) and the 
algorithm stopped assigning neratinib in these subtypes during the course of the trial 
(Supplemental Table 2).
Safety and Tolerability
The combination of neratinib and paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting exhibited safety and 
toxicity comparable to previous studies in advanced breast cancer.6 Diarrhea was the most 
common adverse event, and Grade 3–4 diarrhea was noted in 38% of patients in the 
neratinib arm. Diarrhea was mitigated by dose reductions and/or supportive measures, with 
further improvements noted after the protocol modification to include prophylactic 
loperamide (Supplemental Table 3). Several hematologic and gastrointestinal adverse events 
(summarized in Table 3) were significantly higher in the experimental arm, including Grade 
1–2 vomiting (p=0.045), Grade 1–2 and Grade 3–4 diarrhea (p < 0.0001), Grade 1–2 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase (p=0.0005) and Grade 1–2 and Grade 3–4 alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increase (p=0.0001 and 0.009 respectively).

 Three serious adverse events - pneumonitis (n=1) and dehydration (n=2) - were reported as 
probably or definitely attributable to protocol-directed therapy. No patient developed 
symptomatic congestive heart failure on study. One patient experienced a grade 3–4 decline 
in the left ventricular ejection fraction.
Dose reductions or holds in the experimental arm occurred in 63.5% of patients for neratinib 
and 39.1% for paclitaxel. In the control arm, dose reduction or holds for paclitaxel occurred 
in 11.5% of patients. 11.3% of patients in the experimental group had early discontinuations 
for toxicity compared to 1.3% of patients in the control arm (see Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In this report, we describe the efficacy, leading to graduation to phase 3, of an experimental 
arm of I-SPY 2 consisting of paclitaxel plus neratinib followed by adriamycin/cytoxan (TN-
>AC) for high risk breast cancer characterized by a HER2+/HR− biomarker signature. 
Within this molecular subtype, neratinib emerged as superior to the current standard of care, 
trastuzumab, with a high degree of confidence (95% probability), as measured by the mean 
pCR rate of 55% vs. 33%. In terms of the primary goal of I-SPY 2, which is to facilitate the 
rapid identification of pairs of agents/biomarker profiles likely to succeed in subsequent 
phase 3 studies, the neratinib regimen is estimated to have 79% probability of statistical 
success in a focused neoadjuvant phase 3 study, a result achieved through an experimental 
arm consisting of a modest 116 participants.
The graduation threshold of 85% defined in the study protocol is reached prior to all patients 
completing neoadjuvant therapy and reaching primary endpoint assessment (i.e. completed 
surgery). Once all additional data points (pCR) were accumulated, the probabilities were 
updated and there was a slight reduction of this probability to 79%. This possibility was 
anticipated in the I-SPY 2 design and led to our setting a high threshold of 85%.
The finding of the superiority of neratinib over trastuzumab in this subtype is notable given 
the experience of a number of recent trials seeking to improve upon the efficacy of the 
current standard of care. Among these are several phase 3 studies of lapatinib, a HER/ErbB 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor similar to neratinib, which has failed to show superiority over 
trastuzumab in trials when used in metastatic,17 adjuvant,18 or neoadjuvant settings.19 In the 
last of these some improvement was noted using a triple combination of lapatinib-
trastuzumab-paclitaxel. In the current study, we observed a clear improvement in pCR with 
neratinib plus paclitaxel compared to trastuzumab plus paclitaxel.
A recent meta-analysis of neoadjuvant trials in HER2+ breast cancer reported an overall 
pCR rate of 39% for single HER2-targeted agents with anthracycline-taxane based 
chemotherapy.20 The pCR rate for the HER2+ patients in the trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 
control arm was 23% overall (Table 2), 33% for HER2+/HR− and 17% for HER2+/HR+. 
These rates are lower than for trastuzumab-based therapy in previous neoadjuvant trials of 
HER2+ breast cancer.21 Our study population showed no obvious differences in patient 
characteristics as compared with other neoadjuvant trials. I-SPY 2 methodology, such as 
standardized stringent post neoadjuvant tissue analysis,22 may contribute to lower pCR rates.

 Toxicity of the neratinib arm was manageable and acceptable. As expected,6,23–25 diarrhea 
was its most problematic adverse effect, warranting aggressive supportive care. In this 
regard, an intensive mandatory diarrhea prophylaxis regimen utilizing high-dose loperamide 
at study initiation and subsequent tapering was evaluated in the NSABP FB-7 Phase 1 trial, 
which reported frequent diarrhea, limited to Grade 2.25 Prophylactic high-dose loperamide 
with neratinib is being further evaluated in an ongoing adjuvant trial, NCT02400476.26
Based on I-SPY 2 results and other clinical data, phase 3 testing of neoadjuvant neratinib is 
moving forward in the successor I-SPY 3 program, aimed at generating accelerated approval 
following FDA guidance27,28. Although I-SPY 2 results predict a 79% probability of phase 3 
success in neoadjuvant treatment for HER2+ HR− patients, a modified design is required to 
reflect the current standard of dual HER-targeting (pertuzumab-trastuzumab containing 
regimens) which has already received accelerated approval.29,30 The phase 3 design will test 
neratinib-pertuzumab-trastuzumab-taxane vs. pertuzumab-trastuzumab-taxane vs. neratinib-
trastuzumab-taxane, all followed by AC. The experimental arm will include the graduating 
HER2+/HR− signature, as well as all other HER2+ patients in order to further refine the 
HER2+ subtypes that would benefit from combination therapy with neratinib.
Recent debates about neoadjuvant endpoints31 highlight the importance of well-designed 
prospective trials. The I-SPY 2/3 mechanism has the potential to accelerate drug 
development via neoadjuvant endpoints and advance a more personalized, biomarker-based 
approach to the treatment of high-risk breast cancer.

A. I-SPY 2 Adaptive Design.
B. Study Design.
Study schema for the neratinib experimental arm and control arm in I-SPY2. Following 
screening, HER2+ patients were randomized to receive either neratinib plus paclitaxel vs. 
trastuzumab plus paclitaxel. HER2− patients were randomized to receive either neratinib 
plus paclitaxel vs. paclitaxel alone. HER2+ and HER2− patients then received standard AC 
treatment to complete their neoadjuvant therapy.

Did/did not received allotted intervention: Patients were categorized as receiving no 
experimental therapy or at least 1 dose of experimental therapy.

 Figure 2. Probability distributions for select signatures
Histograms showing posterior (final) probability distributions for neratinib and control pCR 
rates for 4 of the 10 signatures listed in Table 2. Panel 2A is for HER2+/HR−, the graduating 
signature for neratinib. Estimated pCR Rate is the mean of the respective distribution. 
Predictive Probability in Phase 3 is a calculation based on the respective pair of histograms 
and is explained in the text.
