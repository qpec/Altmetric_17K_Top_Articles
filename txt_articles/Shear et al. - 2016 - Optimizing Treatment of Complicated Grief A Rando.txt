Abstract
IMPORTANCE—To our knowledge, this is the first placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial 
to evaluate the efficacy of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, with and without complicated grief 
psychotherapy, in the treatment of complicated grief.
OBJECTIVE—To confirm the efficacy of a targeted complicated grief treatment (CGT), 
determine whether citalopram (CIT) enhances CGT outcome, and examine CIT efficacy without 
CGT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Included in the study were 395 bereaved adults 
who met criteria for CG recruited from March 2010 to September 2014 from academic medical 
centers in Boston, Massachusetts; New York, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and San Diego, 
California. Co-occurring substance abuse, psychosis, mania, and cognitive impairment were 
exclusionary. Study participants were randomized using site-specific permuted blocks stratified by 
major depression into groups prescribed CIT (n = 101), placebo (PLA; n = 99), CGT with CIT (n 
= 99), and CGT with PLA (n = 96). Independent evaluators conducted monthly assessments for 20 
weeks. Response rates were compared under the intention-to-treat principle, including all 
randomized participants in a logistic regression with inverse probability weighting.
INTERVENTIONS—All participants received protocolized pharmacotherapy optimized by 
flexible dosing, psychoeducation, grief monitoring, and encouragement to engage in activities. 
Half were also randomized to receive manualized CGT in 16 concurrent weekly sessions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Complicated grief–anchored Clinical Global 
Impression scale measurments every 4 weeks. Response was measured as a rating of “much 
improved” or “very much improved.”
RESULTS—Of the 395 study participants, 308 (78.0%) were female and 325 (82.3%) were 
white. Participants’ response to CGT with PLA vs PLA (82.5% vs 54.8%; relative risk [RR], 1.51; 
95% CI, 1.16–1.95; P = .002; number needed to treat [NNT], 3.6) suggested the efficacy of CGT, 
and the addition of CIT did not significantly improve CGT outcome (CGT with CIT vs CGT with

 PLA: 83.7% vs 82.5%; RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88–1.17; P = .84; NNT, 84). However, depressive 
symptoms decreased significantly more when CIT was added to treatment (CGT with CIT vs CGT 
with PLA: model-based adjusted mean [standard error] difference, −2.06 [1.00]; 95% CI, −4.02 to 
−0.11; P = .04). By contrast, adding CGT improved CIT outcome (CIT vs CGT with CIT: 69.3% 
vs 83.7%; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00–1.46; P = .05; NNT, 6.9). Last, participant response to CIT was 
not significantly different from PLA at week 12 (45.9% vs 37.9%; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.82–1.81; P 
= .35; NNT, 12.4) or at week 20 (69.3% vs 54.8%; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.95–1.68; P = .11; NNT, 
6.9). Rates of suicidal ideation diminished to a substantially greater extent among participants 
receiving CGT than among those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Complicated grief treatment is the treatment of choice 
for CG, and the addition of CIT optimizes the treatment of co-occurring depressive symptoms.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01179568
Complicated grief (CG) is a chronic impairing condition that occurs in about 7% of bereaved 
people (2% to 3% of general population).1,2 The syndrome includes persistent maladaptive 
thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, and poorly regulated emotionality that interfere with 
adaptation after loss.3 Although co-occurring depressive symptoms are common, CG can be 
clearly differentiated from major depression both in its primary symptomatology4 and 
response to treatment.5,6 Core symptoms of yearning and sorrow, preoccupying thoughts of 
the deceased, and difficulty accepting the painful reality of the death are different from 
persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, and psychomotor and neurovegetative 
symptoms, which are the hallmarks of depression. Studies5,6 document a significantly better 
response to complicated grief treatment (CGT) than interpersonal psychotherapy, which has 
well-documented efficacy for depression.3
Provisional guidelines and criteria for diagnosis have been proposed for the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision3 and DSM-5.7 Until these are 
approved, patients can be reliably identified by a screening questionnaire8 and a 
semistructured clinical interview.9 Chronic high levels of distress and impairment and 
increased risk for suicide, cancer, and cardiovascular disease constitute a strong indication 
for treatment. We developed CGT to target adaptation to loss and found it produced a better 
outcome than grief-focused interpersonal psychotherapy5,6; individuals in our psychotherapy 
trial who were taking antidepressant medication had a markedly higher treatment completion 
rate. In addition, antidepressant medications can decrease the intensity of emotions and 
somatic symptoms and improve cognitive functioning, and there are some pilot data 
suggesting that antidepressant medication can be helpful for people with CG.10–12 However, 
to our knowledge, there are no randomized clinical studies testing whether antidepressants 
enhance CGT efficacy or whether they are efficacious without CGT.13 We conducted a 
randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that citalopram (CIT) would be superior to 
pill placebo (PLA) with and without CGT. Our data provide important information for 
evidence-informed clinical care and shared decision-making in specialty mental health and 
other health care settings.

 Methods
Study Design
We conducted a double-blinded, PLA-controlled trial at 4 collaborating sites (New York, 
New York, which was the coordinating center; Boston, Massachusetts; Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania; and San Diego, California) funded independently by the National Institute of 
Mental Health. Aim 1 compared CIT with PLA when administered without CGT for 12 
weeks (we moved aim 1 from week 16 to week 12 in consultation with our data and safety 
monitoring board after a US Food and Drug Administration ruling limited the maximum 
dose of CIT to 40 mg daily in 2011). Aim 2 compared CIT with PLA when administered 
with CGT. Aim 3 examined whether adding CGT to CIT or PLA significantly improved 
outcomes at 20 weeks. The institutional review boards at each site approved the study; 
oversight was provided by an independent data and safety monitoring board. The full study 
protocol can be found in Supplement 1. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants before baseline assessment. Following a telephone screen (verbal consent) and 
in-person assessment, eligible participants were randomly assigned via a 2 × 2 factorial 
design to receive CIT or PLA with or without concomitant psychotherapy. All study 
participants received a medication prescription (CIT or PLA) from a pharmacotherapist who 
provided empathic support, psychoeducation, and encouragement to re-engage in activities 
along with monitoring and adjustment of the medication. Half also received CGT, a targeted 
psychotherapy entailing 16 sessions over a maximum of 20 weeks.5,6 Our main outcome 
was rate of response defined as 1 (“very much improved”) or 2 (“much improved”) on the 
CG-anchored Clinical Global Impression Scale14 (Table 1) as determined by independent 
evaluators, trained to achieve reliability on key rating instruments (treatment response κ, 
0.89; 95% CI, 0.73–1.00) and blind to treatment assignment.
Recruitment
Between March 2010 and September 2014, 395 bereaved individuals aged 18 to 95 years 
were recruited using professional and public outreach and print, broadcast, and internet 
media. Referrals were made by health care professionals, bereavement counselors, and 
patients or family members.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Participants who scored 30 or greater on the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG)8 
underwent a clinical interview to confirm the presence and primacy of CG. Those with a 
current substance use disorder (past 6 months), a lifetime history of psychotic disorder, 
bipolar I disorder, active suicidal plans requiring hospitalization, a Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment score less than 21, or a pending lawsuit or disability claim related to the death as 
well as those undergoing concurrent psychotherapy or treatment with an antidepressant were 
excluded.
Assessment Procedures
Independent evaluators completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I,15 a 
supplemental interview for CG,9 the Columbia Suicide Scale16 modified for bereavement,

 and the Clinical Global Impression Scale14 for CG-anchored severity and improvement 
(Table 1). Follow-up assessments were conducted 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after the first 
treatment visit and 6 months after study treatment termination. Study participants were 
instructed not to tell independent evaluators if they received CGT. Assessments were 
audiotaped; 10% were randomly selected and corated for reliability. Biweekly cross-site 
meetings reviewed rating procedures and included practice coratings to prevent drift.
Participants completed self-report questionnaires for secondary outcome measures of grief-
related symptoms(ICG),8 impairment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale [WSAS]),17,18 
avoidance (Grief-Related Avoidance Questionnaire [GRAQ]),19 depressive symptoms(Quick 
Inventory of Depressive Symptoms–Self-report [QIDS-SR16]),20 and suicidal ideation 
(Columbia Suicide Scale).16
Pharmacotherapy
Citalopram or PLA was provided in double-blind fashion to all participants. Given 
participants’ high levels of distress and impairment and inclusion of a PLA-only cell, our 
manualized pharmacotherapy approach included procedures designed to optimize participant 
safety and pharmacotherapy effectiveness. Prescribing clinicians received standardized site-
based training and supervision. The first visit (about 45 minutes) included a focused 
psychosocial history and review of symptoms as well as psychoeducation using the same 
model as in CGT, with a rationale for using antidepressant medication. Subsequent visits 
(weekly for 4 weeks, biweekly for 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter) were 20 to 30 minutes. 
Pharmacotherapists monitored grief symptoms and provided CGT-informed clinical 
management that included encouragement and support for resuming normal life activities as 
a test of medication effectiveness. They also assessed depressive symptoms, suicidal 
thinking, medication adherence, and adverse effects. Specific interventions, such as exposure 
instructions, emotion regulation strategies, or cognitive reframing, were proscribed (specific 
exposure procedures and other CG-targeted psychotherapy procedures were prohibited). 
Medication was flexibly dosed to the maximum allowable. Supplementary visits were 
provided if there was a change in dosage or when it was deemed clinically indicated (eg, to 
follow-up on suicidal ideation). Study medication was discontinued and open treatment 
provided when exit criteria were met or when pharmacotherapists judged it was clinically 
indicated. Participants also interacted with warm, supportive, CGT-informed administrative 
staff. The mean (SD) dose of CIT (aim 1, week 12) was 33.9 (15.0) mg per day. The median 
dose was 40 mg per day.
Complicated Grief Treatment
Complicated grief treatment was delivered as in prior studies5,6 using a manualized, well-
specified 16-session protocol. Briefly, sessions 1 through 3 included history taking 
(relationship history and bereavement experience), the beginning of daily grief-monitoring, 
psychoeducation about CG and CGT, the introduction of ongoing aspirational goals work, 
and a conjoint session with a significant other. Sessions 4 through 9 included imaginal and 
situational revisiting procedures and work with memories and pictures. Session 10 was a 
midcourse review, followed by sessions 11 through 16, which included an imaginal 
conversation with the deceased. The entire study treatment manual is available at http://

 www.complicatedgrief.columbia.edu/. Therapists were trained by participating in a didactic 
seminar and successfully completed at least 2 training cases before seeing study participants 
under independent site-based supervision.
Randomization
Study participants were randomized with equal probability (25%) to each treatment arm, 
using permuted-block randomization (block size of 4 or 8) stratified by site and by presence 
or absence of current major depressive disorder (MDD). Medication allocation was 
concealed from all study staff. Independent evaluators were blind to psychotherapy 
allocation.
Statistical Analysis
The range and distribution of all key demographic and clinical variables at baseline were 
compared across study arms by χ2 tests or analyses of variance. Our prespecified primary 
analysis was cross-sectional, comparing treatment response rates for CIT vs PLA at week 12 
(aim 1), for CIT with CGT vs PLA with CGT at week 20 (aim 2), and for CIT with CGT vs 
CIT at week 20 (aim 3) based on the intention-to-treat principle including all randomized 
participants. A weighted logistic regression controlled for randomization stratification 
variables (ie, site and baseline MDD) and race/ethnicity. Inverse probability weighting, a 
standard strategy to account for missing assessment data,21–24 provided weights in the 
model (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2). Our enrollment target of 440 participants lost 10% to 
follow-up and had a power of 76% to 83% to detect predicted between-group difference in 
response based on data from our 2005 study5,11 (CGT with PLA, 40%; CGT with CIT, 60%; 
CIT, 40%; and PLA, 20%). All P values were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was 
defined as P < .05. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute).25
As with prespecified sensitivity analyses, unweighted analyses of assessment completers and 
longitudinal analyses using generalized linear mixed effects model with participant-specific 
random intercepts of the primary outcome were performed for each aim. We calculated 
number needed to treat (NNT) as the reciprocal of response rate. Preplanned moderator 
analyses examined treatment by MDD interaction (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2) and 
treatment effect heterogeneity across sites.
Prespecified secondary analyses of self-report ratings of CG symptoms (ICG),8 grief-related 
functional impairment (WSAS)17,18 and avoidance (GRAQ)19 and of depressive symptoms 
(QIDS-SR16)20 compared changes in scores using a weighted linear regression using inverse 
probability weighting to adjust for missing assessments. As with sensitivity analyses, 
longitudinal mixed effects models with participant-specific random intercepts used all 
available longitudinal assessments to estimate the adjusted mean difference in week 12 and 
week 20 self-report outcomes (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2). Suicidal ideation, a binary 
outcome derived from Columbia Suicide Scale question 1c,16 was analyzed the same way as 
treatment response.

 Results
Sample Recruitment and Retention
Figure 1, the study CONSORT flowchart, outlines screening, assessment, and study 
completion rates.
Baseline Sample Characteristics
Baseline sample characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The sample was predominantly 
white (325 of 395 [82.3%]), female (308 [78.0%]), and highly educated (350 [88.6%]), with 
slightly more than half (211 [53.4%]) completing college. The median (range) time since the 
loss was 2.3 (0.5–58.7) years. Most deaths were from natural causes. Two-thirds (262 
[66.3%]) of the sample met criteria for current major depression. More than half (221 
[55.9%]) reported a wish to be dead since the loss.
Main Outcome Analyses
Analyses suggested a greater response to CGT with PLA than PLA (82.5% vs 54.8%; 
relative risk [RR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.95; P = .002; NNT, 3.6). Contrary to our 
expectation, we could not show that the addition of CIT significantly improved CGT 
outcome (CGT with CIT vs CGT with PLA: 83.7% vs 82.5%; RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88–1.17; 
P = .84; NNT, 84). On the other hand, adding CGT did improve CIT outcome (CIT vs CGT 
with CIT: 69.3% vs 83.7%; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00–1.46; P = .05; NNT, 6.9). Response to 
CIT was not statistically different from PLA (45.9% vs 37.9%; RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.82–
1.81; P = .35; NNT, 12.4) at week 12 or at week 20 (69.3% vs 54.8%; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 
0.95–1.68; P = .11; NNT, 6.9). There was also no significant evidence for differences 
between CIT and PLA at 4 or 8 weeks. Results of sensitivity analyses did not differ from the 
main analyses for any of the comparisons, and results of adjusting only randomization 
stratification variables without race/ethnicity were nearly identical. There was no significant 
evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity across sites.
We hypothesized that participants with co-occurring MDD would show a greater difference 
between CIT and PLA than those without MDD. However, there was no significant evidence 
of an interaction between medication and MDD, with or without CGT (eAppendix 2 in 
Supplement 2). Replacing MDD by dichotomized severity of depressive symptoms (QIDS-
SR16 score ≥16) did not change the results (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2). However, 
depressive symptoms decreased significantly more with CGT when CIT was added (CGT 
with CIT vs CGT with PLA: QIDS-SR16 mean [standard error (SE)] difference, −2.06 
[1.00]; 95% CI, −4.02 to −0.11; P = .04).Longitudinal analysis estimated a marginally 
significant QIDS-SR16 score mean [SE] difference of −1.24 (0.65; P = .06). Figure 2 
displays observed mean trajectories of CG (ICG) and depressive (QIDS-SR16) symptoms.
Outcome for Self-report Measures of Symptoms and Impairment
Results of inverse probability weighting–adjusted cross-sectional analyses of mean change 
in self-report ratings also closely mirrored the main outcome findings (Table 3). Citalopram 
and PLA showed no significant difference at week 12 for CG symptom severity (ICG-
adjusted mean [SE] difference, 0.67 [2.04]; P = .74), grief-related impairment (WSAS-

 adjusted mean [SE] difference, −0.84 [1.57]; P = .59), or grief-related avoidance (GRAQ-
adjusted mean difference, −1.49 [1.56], P = .34); results were similar at week 20. Similarly, 
CIT with CGT and PLA with CGT were not statistically different on any of these measures 
at week 20. Citalopram with CGT was associated with significantly greater change than CIT 
(adjusted mean [SE] differences: ICG, −7.37 [2.08]; P < .001; WSAS, −4.13 [1.46]; P = .
005; GRAQ, −5.19 [1.60]; P = .001), and PLA with CGT was associated with significantly 
greater change than PLA (adjusted mean [SE] differences: ICG, −8.01 [2.04]; P < .001; 
WSAS, −5.76 [1.63]; P < .001; GRAQ, −5.74 [1.43]; P < .001). Results from longitudinal 
analyses (mixed effects models) using all available assessments of symptom and impairment 
measures are consistent with inverse probability weighting analyses (eAppendix 3 in 
Supplement 2).
Treatment Effects on Suicidal Ideation
At the first treatment visit, rates of suicidal ideation on a clinician-rated suicide assessment 
were 30.6% for the CIT group, 32.2% for the PLA group, 32.2% for the CIT with CGT 
group, and 25.9% for the PLA with CGT group (Table 2). Those receiving medication 
without CGT still reported a wish to die at week 20 (CIT, 17.7%; PLA, 19.0%). 
Complicated grief treatment with CIT was associated with significantly lower suicidal 
ideation at week 20 compared with CIT (3.5% vs 17.7%; odds ratio, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05–
0.55; P = .003). Similarly, CGT with PLA at week 20 was significantly lower than PLA 
(6.7% vs 19.0%; odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–0.85; P = .02).
Treatment Adherence—Seventy-four percent of those assigned to CGT completed all 16 
sessions, and CIT did not significantly improve this completion rate (74.0% vs 73.7%; P = .
97). Among participants not assigned to CGT, those receiving CIT were more likely to 
complete a full course of medication compared with those receiving PLA (62.4% vs 48.5%; 
P = .05). Medication adherence was greater with CGT with PLA than PLA (68.8% vs 
48.5%; P = .004) but not significantly different for CGT with CIT compared with CIT 
(67.7% vs 62.4%; P = .43). Response rates for treatment completers were slightly higher for 
each treatment condition; however, results were not significantly different for any of our 
comparisons.
Adverse Effects of Treatment—We observed no serious adverse medication effects (eg, 
psychiatric or medical hospitalization, suicide attempts, or death [a participant in San Diego 
died by suicide during the study; review by the study team and institutional review board 
determined that this death was not related to the research]). Medication dose was adjusted to 
accommodate adverse effects as needed. Complicated grief treatment therapists monitored 
participant response to emotionally activating procedures, such as revisiting the death and 
confrontation with reminders of the deceased, and no serious untoward responses were 
documented.
Six-Month Follow-up—Data were obtained for 247 of 395 (62.5%) of all randomized and 
247 of 289 (85.5%) of study completers. Rates of maintaining response at 6-month follow-
up assessment were 96.4% for CGT with PLA, 93.1% for CGT with CIT, 96.4% for CIT 
without CGT, and 83.3% for PLA without CGT.

 Discussion
Complicated grief is an underrecognized public health problem estimated to affect tens of 
millions of people worldwide.1 Symptoms can be reliably assessed and are associated with a 
chronic course, high levels of suicidality,26–28 and functional impairment comparable to 
many DSM-5 disorders.18 The severity and chronicity of distress and impairment underscore 
why intervening clinically with evidence-informed treatment is important. We conducted a 
randomized clinical trial to determine whether and how antidepressant medication should be 
used with and without psychotherapy to optimize treatment of CG.
Our results suggest the efficacy of CGT. To our knowledge, this is the third randomized 
clinical trial of CGT with positive findings and the first to compare it with PLA. Studies of 
similar psychotherapies have been published that further support the efficacy of this 
approach.12,29 It is now clear in the first data from a multicenter trial that CGT or a similar 
psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for CG,5,6,12,29–34 and it is important that clinicians 
know how to provide this treatment. Our results further indicate that adding antidepressant 
medication to CGT may not improve CG outcomes; however, medication is likely to 
improve results for co-occurring depressive symptoms.
Our conclusions regarding the use of antidepressant medication without CGT are less 
definitive. We did not find evidence for the efficacy of CIT monotherapy in this study at our 
planned 12-week end point or at any assessment before or after this (ie, 4, 8, 16, or 20 
weeks). However, several issues reduce our confidence in considering this a definitive result. 
One consideration is that US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for CIT 
implemented more than a year after we initiated the study required us to decrease maximal 
daily dose from 60 mg to 40 mg. Although the 40-mg dose is consistent with prior studies 
documenting efficacy for depression,35 it is possible that the response to CIT would have 
been greater if the higher dose were used. Another issue is that our recruitment rate was 
slightly lower than expected (90% of our target), and the assessment drop-out rate was over 
double what we expected. Although we included a statistical correction for assessment drop 
out, it is impossible to adjust fully for this problem. Citalopram outperformed PLA 
numerically on almost all analyses, with this difference most pronounced in those who had 
comorbid major depression at baseline. Citalopram was associated with significantly better 
adherence to treatment. Given these observations, we conclude that we have not disproved 
our initial belief that antidepressant medication can be helpful to people with CG (in the 
absence of appropriately targeted psychotherapy).
Other limitations include that our study sample was primarily white, female, and well-
educated; results may not be generalizable to a more diverse sample. Pharmacotherapist use 
of CGT-informed clinical management and/or unique benefits of research participation may 
have inflated response rates; however, because study participants in all arms received these, 
efficacy results were not differentially impacted.
The robust PLA response rate in this study raises the possibility that pharmacotherapist 
behavior had a therapeutic effect. If so, physicians and other direct care professionals could 
improve the care of patients with CG if they learn to recognize CG, familiarize themselves

 with assessment tools such as the ICG8 and/or guided clinical interview for CG,3 prepare to 
explain and monitor CG symptoms as different from depression,36,37 and provide empathic 
support and gentle encouragement for re-engaging in daily activities. Behavioral medicine 
practitioners should learn to administer CGT.3 Materials are available from http://
www.complicatedgrief.columbia.edu/ to guide practitioners in achieving these goals.
Conclusions
In summary, CG is a serious, prevalent, and frequently chronic and debilitating condition 
that needs to be recognized and treated. Complicated grief treatment is the first-line 
treatment. Our results support the use of antidepressants in conjunction with CGT for relief 
of co-occurring depressive symptoms. When CGT is unavailable, CGT-informed supportive 
clinical management with or without antidepressants may be a helpful approach.

 Key Points
Question
Does citalopram (CIT) enhance complicated grief treatment (CGT) outcome, and is CIT 
efficacious without CGT?
Findings
In this 4-site randomized clinical trial of 395 adults, there was a significantly greater rate 
of responders (ie, complicated grief much improved or very much improved) to CGT 
with placebo vs placebo. The addition of CIT did not improve the complicated grief 
response rate. However, depressive symptoms on the Quick Inventory of Depression 
Scale decreased significantly when CIT was added.
Meaning
Complicated grief treatment is the treatment of choice for complicated grief, and the 
addition of CIT optimizes treatment of co-occurring depressive symptoms.

 Figure 2. Inventory of Complicated Grief Scores
A, Scores on the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) show improvement in participants 
randomized to complicated grief treatment (CGT) but no specific benefit of citalopram 
(CIT) relative to placebo (PLA). B, Depression self-ratings on the Quick Inventory of 
Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) show improvement when CIT is co-administered with CGT 
but little improvement in the absence of CGT. The ICG total score range is 0 to 76; the 
QIDS total score range is 0 to 27. IPW indicates inverse probability weighting.

Table 1
Complicated Grief–Clinical Global Impressions Scale–Severity and Improvement Items
Severity Rating
Severity Level Description
Improvement Rating
CG-CGI-Improvement Level Description
1. Normal
Feelings of grief are sometimes present 
but not intrusive. There is clear evidence 
of restoration of the capacity for joy and 
satisfaction in ongoing life. There is a 
sense of purpose in life and a feeling that 
happiness is possible.
1. Very much improved
There is clear evidence that distress and impairment 
from CG are markedly improved compared with 
baseline. The patient feels very differently about the 
role grief plays in her/his life compared with 
baseline. The CG-CGI-S score is usually no more 
than mild (3), but (rarely) may be moderate (4) if 
baseline severity was very high (7).
2. Borderline ill
Grief symptoms are present but rarely 
intrusive or distressing; there is little or 
no interference in activities and 
relationships and evidence of some 
capacity for pleasure and satisfaction.
2. Much improved
There is evidence that distress and impairment from 
CG are definitely improved compared with baseline, 
and this improvement is definitely clinically 
significant. The patient notices some difference in 
the role grief plays in her/his life. The CG-CGI-S 
score is usually no more than moderate (4). 
However, a patient can be much improved and grief 
symptoms may still be marked (5) if the baseline 
severity was very high (7).
3. Mildly ill
Symptoms of CG are present and 
sometimes intrusive and/or distressing 
but manageable, and there is minimal or 
no interference in functioning. There is 
engagement in activities and 
relationships with the potential for 
satisfaction and pleasure. Clinical 
significance is borderline or 
subthreshold.
3. Minimally improved
There is some evidence for improvement in distress 
and/or impairment from CG compared with 
baseline, but the clinical significance of the change 
is questionable or minimal.
4. Moderately ill
Symptoms of CG are present and 
intrusive on most days at a level that is 
painful but bearable. There is some 
interference with activities and 
relationships, but functioning is not 
substantially impaired. There may be 
some avoidance of reminders of the loss. 
A sense of purpose or meaning is usually 
present, but there may be confusion 
about this. Suicidal thoughts may be 
present, but there is usually a desire to 
live. Distraction is possible temporarily, 
but symptoms are persistent and 
clinically significant.
4. No change
Distress and impairment from CG have not changed 
in any meaningful way since the baseline 
assessment.
5. Markedly ill
Symptoms of CG are frequent and 
intrusive at a level that causes substantial 
pain and definite interference with 
functioning. There is usually some 
avoidance of reminders of the loss, loss 
of a sense of purpose or meaning in life, 
and/or a feeling that joy and satisfaction 
are no longer possible; suicidal thoughts 
are usually present and may be 
prominent. There may be a feeling of 
just waiting to die. There is little relief 
from CG symptoms; distraction is 
difficult and, when possible, short-lived.
5. Minimally worse
There is evidence that distress or impairment from 
CG is somewhat worse since the baseline 
assessment, but the clinical significance of this 
change is questionable or minimal.
6. Severely ill
Symptoms of CG are nearly constant and 
preoccupying on most days at a level that 
is severe and impairing; extensive 
avoidance is often present. There is often 
a belief that joy and satisfaction are no 
longer possible; there may be active 
suicidal ideation or indirect suicidal 
behavior. Distraction is rarely possible 
and only partially effective, and there 
may be periods of inability to function.
6. Much worse
There is evidence that distress and impairment from 
CG are definitely worse since the baseline 
assessment, and this change is clinically significant. 
Alternative care should be considered.

7. Among the 
most extremely 
ill patients
Symptoms of CG are present 
continuously or nearly continuously at a 
very severe level. The person is virtually 
unable to function in activities or 
relationships. There may be strongly 
held self-blaming or accusatory beliefs 
about the death that border on 
delusional. There is a conviction that joy 
and satisfaction are no longer possible. 
Avoidance is usually present and 
extensive. Active suicidal thoughts or 
indirect suicidal behavior are usually 
present.
7. Very much worse
There is evidence that distress and impairment from 
CG are markedly worse since the baseline 
assessment. There may be emergent clinically 
significant suicidal thinking or behavior or risk of 
other serious consequences of worsening grief. 
Alternative care is definitely needed.
