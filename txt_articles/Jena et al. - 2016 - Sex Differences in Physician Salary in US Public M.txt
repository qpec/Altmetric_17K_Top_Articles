Abstract
Importance—Limited evidence exists on salary differences between male and female academic 
physicians, largely due to difficulty obtaining data on salary and factors influencing salary. 
Existing studies have been limited by reliance on survey-based approaches to measuring sex 
differences in earnings, lack of contemporary data, small sample sizes, or limited geographic 
representation.
Objective—To analyze sex differences in earnings among U.S. academic physicians.
Design, setting, and participants—Freedom of Information laws mandate release of salary 
information of public university employees in several states. In 12 states with salary information 
published online, we extracted salary data on 10,241 academic physicians at 24 public medical 
schools. We linked this data to a unique physician database with detailed information on sex, age, 
years of experience, faculty rank, specialty, scientific authorship, NIH funding, clinical trial 
participation, and Medicare reimbursements (proxy for clinical revenue). We estimated sex 
differences in salary adjusting for these factors.

Main outcome measures—Annual salary
Results—Female physicians had lower unadjusted salaries than male physicians ($206,641 vs. 
$257,957; difference $51,315; 95% CI $46,330–$56,301). Sex differences persisted after 
multivariable adjustment ($227,782 vs. $247,661; difference $19,878; 95% CI $15,261–$24,495).

professors, respectively.
Conclusions and relevance—Among physicians with faculty appointments at 24 U.S. public 
medical schools, significant sex differences in salary exist even after accounting for age,

INTRODUCTION
The number of women in medicine has grown rapidly since 1970. Women now comprise 
half of all U.S. medical school graduates and hold 38% of faculty positions in U.S. medical 
schools.1,2 Nonetheless, significant sex differences in job achievement and compensation 
exist in medicine. Within U.S. medical schools, several studies have documented sex 
differences in faculty rank.3–11 A recent analysis of sex differences in faculty rank in 2014, 
which used a comprehensive cross-sectional database of 91,073 U.S. physicians, found 
substantial sex differences in faculty rank after adjustment for physician age, years since 
residency completion, specialty, scientific authorship, National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
research funding, and clinical trial participation.12
Less attention has been paid to differences in earnings between male and female physicians, 
largely due to limited availability of earnings data and matching information on factors that 
may affect earnings, such as specialty, years of experience, clinical practice characteristics, 
and within academic medicine, measures of research productivity. Still, among physicians 
overall, several surveys have found that women earn substantially less than men after 
adjustment for specialty choice, hours worked, years of experience, and family 
structure.13–16 Within academic medicine, several studies have found that women earn less 
than men after adjustment for factors such as age, race, marital status, years of experience, 
specialty, reported work hours, research productivity and faculty rank.17–22 However, these 
studies have been limited by several factors, including: reliance on survey-based approaches 
to measuring sex differences in physician earnings, lack of contemporary data, small sample 
sizes, and limited geographic representation.
We undertook an analysis of sex differences in academic physician salary that was designed 
to mitigate many of the limitations of previous studies on this topic. Specifically, we 
assembled a database of salary information of academic physicians employed in 24 public 
medical schools in 12 states, relying on the fact that several states have Freedom of 
Information laws which mandate the release of government financial records that frequently 
include salary information on employees of public universities. We combined these data 
with information on clinical and research productivity of physicians to analyze sex 
differences in earnings.
METHODS
Salary data
Many states have Freedom of Information laws, which mandate the release of government 
records. These records frequently include public employee salary data, detailing the full 
name, title, institution, and salary of all public employees in that state. We extracted salary

 information of all employees in 24 state medical schools in 12 states that had public 
employee data available online as of November 1, 2015 (schools: Universities of California 
at Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco; the Universities of Florida and 
South Florida; Southern Illinois University and University of Illinois; University of Kansas; 
University of Maryland; University of Michigan; East Carolina University and University of 
North Carolina; Ohio State University; University of Tennessee; Universities of Texas at 
Houston, San Antonio, Medical Branch, and Southwestern, Texas Tech University, and MD 
Anderson Cancer Center; University of Washington; and University of Wisconsin). Year of 
salary ranged from 2011 to 2013; for instance, published salaries of UT Southwestern 
employees were from 2012, while salaries of University of California employees were from 
2013.
We merged this individual-level salary data with a comprehensive database of U.S. 
physicians obtained from Doximity, a company that provides online networking services for 
U.S. physicians. The purpose of the match was to identify physician faculty in each state 
employee salary database using a list of physician names and institutional affiliations from 
the Doximity database. The database draws on several sources to identify physicians, 
including the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) National Provider 
Identifier (NPI) Registry, self-registered members, and collaborating hospitals and medical 
schools that provide information to the company. Additional details of this database are 
described below.
Individuals in the two datasets were matched iteratively, through various combinations of 
first and last name, middle initial, and university affiliation. University affiliation and 
associated faculty rank of physicians in the Doximity database were obtained from the 
Association of American Medical Colleges faculty roster database. Because it is possible 
that a physician in a medical school may share the same first and last name as a non-
physician employee in that university, we excluded all non-unique names in the salary 
datasets.
We assessed the validity with which we were able to identify public medical school 
physician faculty in state employee databases in two ways. First, we sought to confirm that 
individuals who we identified in the salary data as being physician faculty were in fact 
physician faculty. For a random sample of 240 physicians (10 per school), we verified 
through online searches that each physician was, in fact, affiliated with that medical school. 
Second, we sought to determine whether unmatched physicians (that is, physicians who 
were listed as faculty members at a given medical school in the Doximity database, but were 
not matched to state employee salary records) failed to match for “correct” reasons. To 
accomplish this, we manually confirmed that each unmatched physician who was listed by 
the AAMC as a professor at a given medical school was not in the payroll data at all. Most 
of these physicians held titular positions at various medical schools, but earned a majority, if 
not the entirety, of their salary through an affiliated private hospital, and as such were not 
listed in the public employee payroll data.

 Physician characteristics
In addition to university affiliation and faculty rank, the Doximity database included 
information on physician age, sex, specialty, and year of residency completion, obtained 
through partnerships with the American Board of Medical Specialties, state licensing boards, 
and collaborating hospitals and medical schools. The database also included information on 
the number of authored scientific publications indexed in PubMed (first, last, and total 
publications), number of NIH grants for which the physician was a principal investigator, 
obtained from the NIH RePORT database, and the number of registered clinical trials for 
which the physician was a principal or sub-investigator, obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Details of the database and validation of the accuracy of its data have been published 
elsewhere.12
In addition to these characteristics, we obtained information on the total amount a physician 
was reimbursed by Medicare in 2013, as reported in publicly available data published by the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This figure was used as a proxy for clinical 
revenue and full- versus part-time effort, which may influence a physician’s salary.
Statistical analysis
We estimated a physician-level multivariable linear regression model of annual salary as a 
function of physician sex, age, years since residency completion, faculty rank (assistant, 
associate, or full professor), specialty, NIH funding (yes/no indicator for whether a physician 
was ever a principal investigator on an NIH grant), clinical trial participation (yes/no 
indicator), publication count (first or last authored, and total), whether the medical school 
the physician graduated from ranked among the top twenty in U.S. News and World Report 
research rankings of medical schools in 2013 (yes/no indicator), and the total amount the 
physician billed to Medicare in 2013. Our model included medical school-level fixed effects, 
thereby identifying the sex difference in physician salary on the basis of comparisons of 
physicians within the same institution rather than across institutions.
We reported the absolute adjusted difference in salary between male and female physicians 
overall, as well as in several pre-specified subgroups (by specialty and faculty rank; for each 
of the 24 medical schools in our database; and for the three Census regions in which schools 
were located, Midwest, South, and West).
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, to address the potential impact of data 
inaccuracies in our measures of research productivity, we re-estimated the earnings model 
among registered physician members who themselves provide information in their own 
Doximity profiles. Second, although we used Medicare reimbursements as a proxy for 
clinical revenue and effort, it is possible that physicians on different faculty tracks (e.g., 
clinical vs research) or with varying work hours (e.g., full vs part time) may be compensated 
differently, which could confound sex differences in faculty rank.23 We therefore analyzed 
sex differences in earnings among faculty with NIH funding, who we assumed were more 
likely to be full-time researchers. Moreover, to further address this issue, we re-estimated 
our earnings model excluding the bottom 25% of earners in each specialty and institution to

 limit the sample to those physicians more likely be in full time rather than part time 
positions Third, we assessed the sensitivity of adjusted sex differences in earnings to models 
which included years since residency as a categorical variable (rather than continuous, to 
allow for non-linear effects of experience on earnings) and which included counts of NIH 
grants and clinical trials as opposed to binary indicators for each.
Data were approved for study by the human subjects review committee at Harvard Medical 
School. Stata software, version 13 (StataCorp) was used for analyses.
RESULTS
Characteristics of study population
Our sample consisted of 10,241 physician faculty in 24 public medical schools (comprising 
11.0% of 93,480 physicians with academic appointments in the U.S.). Of these, 6,692 
(65.4%) were men, a proportion comparable to that seen among physician faculty in 
remaining U.S. medical schools (55,754/83,239; 66.9% men). In unadjusted analyses, 
women had lower salaries than men ($206,641 vs. $257,957; absolute difference $51,315; 
95% CI $46,330–$56,301) (Table 1). Women were less likely than men to be full professors 
(20.2% (717/3,594) vs 38.0% (2,543/6692), p<0.001), were younger (mean age 46.4 vs 51.1 
years, p<0.001), completed residency more recently (14.6 vs 19.4 years, p<0.001), and were 
disproportionately in internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics. Women 
had fewer total and first/last author publications (mean total, 13.5 vs 26.1; mean first/last 
author, 8.6 vs 17.1; p<0.001 for both), were less likely to have had NIH funding (11.6% 
(412/3,594) vs 16.1% (1,076/6,692, p<0.001), and were less likely to have conducted a 
clinical trial (8.1% (287/3,594) vs 11.6% (773/6,692), p<0.001). Women were also less 
likely to have received payments from Medicare and among physicians receiving payments 
the mean amount received was lower for women ($38,409 vs $52,320, p<0.001). Women 
were equally likely to have graduated from a medical school ranked in the top 20 in terms of 
research according to U.S. News and World Report (24.9% (821/3,594) vs 26.4% 
(1,667/6,692), p=0.11).
The salary distribution of women was skewed leftward compared to men, with a 
substantially higher proportion of women receiving lower salaries compared to men (Figure 
1). For example, a majority of women (56.4%; 2,026/3,594) earned under $200,000 
annually, compared to 37.7% (2,524/6,692) of men. Similarly, 3.2% of women earned above 
$400,000 annually compared to 11.6% of men.
Multivariable analysis
Adjusting for faculty rank, age, years since residency, specialty, NIH funding, clinical trial 
participation, publication count (total as well as first/last-authored articles), total Medicare 
payments, and graduation from a medical school ranked among the top 20 by U.S. News and 
World Report explained only a portion of the observed salary difference between male and 
female physicians (adjusted salaries: $227,782 for women vs. $247,661 for men; absolute 
difference: $19,878; 95% CI: $15,261–$24,495) (Table 2). Approximately 40% of the 
unadjusted sex difference in salary remained after adjustment ($19,878/$51,315).

 Average adjusted salary was higher among full professors ($274,614) than associate 
($240,421) and assistant professors ($217,178), p<0.001 for both comparisons). While 
salary rose with age in unadjusted analysis, this relationship disappeared after multivariable 
adjustment (and income was lower among those above age 65 years compared to all other 
groups, p<0.001). Among specialties, adjusted salaries were highest in orthopedic surgery 
($358,092; 95% CI $344,354–$371,830), surgical subspecialties ($318,760; 95% CI 
$311,029–$326,491), and general surgery ($302,665; 95% CI $294,059–$311,271), and 
lowest in infectious disease, family medicine, and neurology (average income < $200,000). 
Years of experience, total publications, clinical trial participation, and Medicare payments 
were positively associated with salary.
Sex differences in salary according to specialty and faculty rank
There was substantial heterogeneity across specialties in the size of sex differences in salary 
(Table 3). In all specialties but radiology, the estimated adjusted salary among men exceeded 
women, although this difference was statistically significantly in 9 of 18 specialties. Surgical 
specialties demonstrated the largest absolute adjusted sex differences in salary ($329,097 vs 
$285,369, absolute difference $43,728, 95% CI $22,272–$65,184), orthopedic surgery 
($368,070 vs $327,117, absolute difference $40,942, 95% CI $2,277–$79,628), hematology/
oncology ($256,959 vs $219,166, absolute difference $37,792, 95% CI $16,030–$59,556), 
obstetrics/gynecology ($289,777 vs $253,387, absolute difference $36,390, 95% CI 
$16,375–$56,406), and cardiology ($263,690 vs $229,940, absolute difference $33,749, 
95% CI $6,479–$61,020).
Sex differences in salary were present at all faculty ranks and were largest among full 
professors (male-female difference among assistant professors $13,240, 95% CI 6,884–
19,596; associate, $20,329, 95% CI $11,381–$29,276; full, $33,620, 95% CI $24,439–
$42,801; eFigure 1). Of note, adjusted salaries of female associate professors ($226,884; 
95% CI $219,504–$234,264) were comparable to those of male assistant professors 
($221,046; 95% CI $216,098–$225,995). Moreover, adjusted salaries of female full 
professors ($250,971; 95% CI $242,307–$259,635) were comparable to those of male 
associate professors ($247,212; 95% CI $241,850–$252,575).
Sex differences in salary by medical school and Census region
Adjusted salaries of male physicians were significantly higher than salaries of female 
physicians in 9/24 (37.5%) schools, although point estimates were higher in 17/24 (70.1%) 
schools (Figure 2). The two schools with the largest male-female earnings gap had absolute 
adjusted sex differences in salary of $54,174 (95% CI $38,901–$69,446) and $59,338 (95% 
CI $29,572–$89,104). In contrast, female physicians had significantly higher adjusted 
salaries than male physicians at 2 schools. Female physicians had lower adjusted salaries 
than male physicians in all three Census regions in which schools were located, with the 
largest sex differences observed in schools in the West (e.g., adjusted sex difference $33,042 
in the West vs $16,044 in the South and $4,541 in the Midwest; p<0.001 for difference 
between West vs South and for West vs Midwest) (eTable 1).

 Additional analyses
Adjusted sex differences in salary were present among physicians self-registered with 
Doximity ($255,825 vs $233,843; difference $21,982; 95% CI $15,073–$28,890); among 
physicians with NIH funding ($268,165 vs $245,666; difference $22,499; 95% CI $9,465–
$35,533); among physicians in the upper three-quartiles of earnings within each school and 
institution, an analysis conducted to increase the likelihood that our sample included 
physicians who were full time effort; and in analyses of earnings models that included years 
since residency as a categorical variable or models that included counts of NIH grants and 
clinical trials as opposed to binary indicators for each (eTable 1).
DISCUSSION
We analyzed sex differences in salary between male and female academic physicians at 24 
U.S. public medical schools using contemporary administrative salary data of state 
employees made publicly available online by state governments. After adjusting these 
analyses for physician age, years of experience, specialty, faculty rank, several measures of 
research productivity, and payments by Medicare—information obtained from a 
comprehensive database of U.S. physicians—we found that annual salaries of female 
academic physicians were approximately 8% (or nearly $20,000) lower than male 
physicians. This difference represents approximately 40% of the unadjusted difference in 
salary between men and women. The magnitude of sex differences in adjusted salary varied 
across specialties and institutions. Sex differences in salary were present at all faculty ranks. 
In fact, female full and associate professors had comparable adjusted salaries to those of 
male associate and assistant professors, respectively. By relying on administrative salary 
data and a rich set of physician characteristics, we were able to analyze a substantially larger 
population of academic physicians than has previously been possible with survey data, 
making this the largest study of sex differences in earnings among academic physicians to 
date.
Several studies have documented persistent sex differences in faculty rank at U.S. medical 
schools,3–11 including a recent analysis using the same physician databased utilized for this 
analysis.12 However, fewer studies have investigated sex differences in salary among 
academic physicians.17–22 Two relatively recent national surveys found that female 
academic physician researchers earn less than males after adjustment for demographics, 
experience, specialty, work hours, research productivity and faculty rank, but these studies 
were survey-based, smaller in size than the current study, and focused on investigators with 
specific forms of early career investigator funding by the NIH.17,18
Our study has several implications. First, sizeable differences in salary between male and 
female physicians in public medical schools persist after accounting for a rich set of factors 
that influence salary. A number of explanations have been put forth to explain sex 
differences in salary and academic advancement more generally.6,7,24–29 One set of 
explanations focuses on factors that may lead to lower research and clinical productivity 
among women, which would result in unadjusted income differences. Such factors include 
differential household responsibilities,30–32 childrearing, greater difficulty finding effective 
mentors,24–26,33 inequitable allocation of institutional research funding and work

 space,15,17,18,34 and different preferences on work-life balance35,36 although evidence on the 
latter is mixed.37,38 Another set of explanations focuses on factors that may explain sex 
differences in salary even among men and women who are similarly productive in research 
and clinical work. Such factors include several of those above, as well as women physicians 
being less likely to receive recognition for achievements,24–26,33 overt discrimination, and 
the possibility that women physicians may place less emphasis on salary negotiations 
compared to male counterparts in both initial and subsequent salary negotiations.39
Although a number of strategies have been proposed to address the issue of sex differences 
in academic physicians salary,40 a second implication of our study is that publicly available 
administrative salary data potentially allow for public transparency to facilitate efforts to 
understand, and even close, the male-female physician salary gap. Specifically, publicly 
available salary information may compel institutions or specific departments within 
institutions to serially assess progress towards reducing sex differences in salary. Relatedly, 
our linkage of administrative salary data to a broad range of clinical and research 
productivity measures of individual physicians that can be updated frequently and in 
automated manner implies that sex differences in salary may be continually evaluated by 
departments and institutions.
A third implication of our study is that we found that sex differences in salary varied 
considerably across specialties and institutions. Specialties such as orthopedic surgery, 
surgical subspecialties, obstetrics and gynecology, and cardiology had the largest absolute 
sex differences in salary, whereas radiology, family medicine, and emergency medicine had 
sex differences in salary that were small in magnitude and not statistically significant. In 
another study, which used the same database of physician characteristics as the present 
study, radiology had among the smallest sex differences in full professorship of all 
specialties,12 which suggests the potential importance of studying specific specialties to 
understand practices associated with improved male-female equity in academic medicine. 
Similarly, the variation in sex differences in salary across institutions underscores both the 
importance of institutional accountability and the potential role for inter-institutional 
initiatives to learn about practices that promote or undermine sex equity in physician 
compensation. Finally, because our findings were among physicians who are state 
employees of public medical schools, interest in reducing sex differences in salary should lie 
not only at the school-level but at the state-level as well.
A potential concern with our study was that we lacked information on faculty track or part-
time status, which could confound sex differences in salary if women are more likely to 
enter lower paying tracks or work part-time. Nonetheless, we adjusted for total Medicare 
payments, which should correlate with clinical volume after adjusting for clinical specialty 
and institution-specific fixed effects (which would adjust for inter-institutional variations in 
insurance case-mix and reimbursement patterns). Sex differences in clinical revenue are 
arguably as important to account for as information on full- or part-time effort, given that 
physicians with similar effort may differ in clinical revenue due to differences in billing 
practices, volume, and procedural mix. Importantly, however, our use of Medicare 
reimbursements as a proxy for clinical revenue and effort would not apply well to fields such 
as pediatrics or obstetrics.

 In addition to the specific issue of sex differences in part-time status, it is possible that 
women and men may differ in their likelihood of being in research versus clinical tracks. To 
address the issue that women may be less likely to enter research tracks, which correlate 
with more rapid promotion and possibly higher salary,12,23 we demonstrated persistent sex 
differences in salary among faculty who were NIH-funded investigators and therefore more 
likely to be on research tracks and unlikely to be part-time. Finally, although part-time status 
is frequently endorsed as a reason why female academic physicians have lower earnings and 
slower academic advancement than male physicians, part-time status arguably mediates 
much of its effect through decreased research productivity and clinical volume. Once these 
factors are accounted for, however, it remains unclear how large an independent residual 
effect part-time status should have on sex differences in earnings. Nonetheless, we cannot 
exclude the possibility of part-time status as an unmeasured confounder.
Our study had several additional limitations. First, it is possible that reported incomes in 
some schools or states may exclude other payments to physicians (e.g., incentive payments, 
grant income, clinical income from non-state sources, etc.) and therefore not reflect the full 
salary physicians receive. The extent to which this issue varies across schools and 
departments within schools is unknown. However, to reduce our estimated sex differences in 
earnings, these payments would have to be higher among women than men, which seems 
unlikely. Moreover, Medicare reimbursements, which we argue are a proxy for clinical 
revenue, were approximately $14,000 higher among men than women, suggesting that any 
incentive payments to physicians that are correlated with clinical revenue are unlikely to be 
higher among women than men. Therefore, our estimated sex differences in income are 
likely lower bounds of true salary differences. Second, we examined only public medical 
schools due to availability of salary data. It is possible that observed sex differences in salary 
may not generalize to private institutions. Nonetheless, the schools we considered had wide 
geographic representation and the proportion of male physician faculty at these schools was 
similar to that of all remaining U.S. medical schools. Third, while we took several steps to 
validate the accuracy of our physician-salary matches, matching errors may occasionally 
have occurred. However, to influence our findings, these errors would need to be correlated 
with physician sex, which is unlikely given that the proportion of male physician faculty in 
our sample mirrored the proportion of male physician faculty in U.S. medical schools 
overall. Fourth, our database of physician characteristics was externally developed, and data 
on publications, NIH funding, and clinical trial investigation was gathered through links to 
other databases. While we previously audited a randomly selected subset of the database to 
verify its accuracy,12 we cannot exclude the possibility that it contains errors. Nonetheless, 
to meaningfully impact the outcomes of this analysis, any errors in the primary dataset 
would have to correlate with physician sex. Moreover, our sensitivity analyses confirmed 
persistent sex differences in salary among registered Doximity members, who presumably 
verified their profile information. Fifth, our database lacked information on physician race 
and ethnicity which may influence earnings as well. Sixth, we lacked data on sub-specialty 
training (e.g., interventional cardiology and electrophysiology within the field of 
cardiology), which may confound our analysis. Notably, however, our adjustment for 
Medicare reimbursements would arguably capture differences in income stemming from 
procedural case-mix differences across specialties. Seventh, we lacked data on other

 graduate degrees which may influence salary (e.g., PhDs), although we would expect much 
of this effect to be mediated through our research productivity measures. Finally, despite 
extensive efforts to control for potential confounders, our results, like those of all 
observational studies, could be influenced by unmeasured variables (e.g., sex differences in

Conclusions
Among academic physicians in 24 U.S. public medical schools, annual salaries of female 
physicians were substantially lower than male physicians after adjustment for a rich set of 
factors that influence salary. Nearly 40% of the unadjusted difference in average salaries 
between men and women remained unexplained after adjustment for these potential 
confounders. Our use of publicly available state employee salary data highlights the 
importance of physician salary transparency to efforts to reduce the male-female earnings 
gap.

Notes: Estimates are from a multivariable linear regression of salary as a function of age, years of experience, sex, NIH funding, publication count 
(total as well first or last authored publications), clinical trial participation, Medicare payments, and medical school fixed effects. Medicare 
payments reflect the amount a physician was reimbursed by Medicare in 2013, as reported in publicly available data published by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services. This figure was used as a proxy for clinical revenue and full- versus part-time effort, which may influence a 
physician’s salary.
