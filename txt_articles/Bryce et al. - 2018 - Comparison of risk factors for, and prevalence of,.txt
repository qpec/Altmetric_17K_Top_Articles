Background: All-cause antibiotic prescribing affects bowel flora antimicrobial susceptibility, and may increase
risk of urinary autoinoculation with antibiotic-resistant microbes. However, little is known about relative preva-
lence of, or risk factors for, antimicrobial resistance among potentially pathogenic microbes thought to be con-
taminating and infecting urine.
Methods: Secondary analysis of 824 children under 5years of age consulting in primary care for an acute illness and
their Escherichia coli isolates cultured at �103 cfu/mL from the Diagnosis of Urinary Tract infection in Young children
(DUTY) study. Multivariable logistic regression investigating risk factors for resistance to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav,
cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin and cefpodoxime in microbes meeting the laboratory criteria
for urinary tract infection: ‘pathogens’ (.105 cfu/mL, n" 79) and ‘contaminants’ (103 to 105 cfu/mL, n" 745).
Results: Forty-three percent of E. coli were resistant to at least one tested antibiotic, with resistance highest to
amoxicillin (49.37% pathogenic versus 37.32% contaminant, P " 0.04), trimethoprim (27.85% versus 16.52%,
P " 0.01) and co-amoxiclav (16.46% versus 21.48%, P " 0.30). Multidrug resistance (to �3 antibiotic groups) was
present in 17.07% of pathogens and 30.13% of contaminants (P " 0.04). No isolates were resistant to nitrofuran-
toin. Recent (0–3 months) exposure to antibiotics was associated with resistance in both pathogens (aOR: 1.10,
95% CI: 1.01–4.39) and contaminants (1.69, 1.09–2.67).
Conclusions: Prevalence of resistance (including multidrug) was high, but there was no consistent relationship
between isolate pathogen/contamination status and resistance. Recent all-cause antibiotic prescribing increased the
probability of antimicrobial resistance in both pathogenic and contaminating urinary E. coli in children in primary care.
Introduction
Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is one of the most challenging
global health threats faced in modern medicine. It has been esti-
mated that by 2050, 10 million lives per year will be at risk from
antibiotic-resistant infections.1 In September 2016, 193 countries
agreed to prioritize reducing antimicrobial resistance at the United
Nations General Assembly following a worldwide campaign by the
UK Government.2 This is particularly important in primary health-
care where over 75% of all healthcare antibiotics are prescribed,3
with our research repeatedly confirming the contribution primary
care prescribing makes to antibiotic resistance.4–6
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly
encountered bacterial infections in primary care, and also repre-
sent the most common antibiotic-resistant infections in primary
care,5,7 leading to repeat consultations and problems for clinicians
in selecting appropriate treatments.8,9 Urinary bacteria are
thought to originate from the faecal flora and colonize the urinary
tract via autoinfection,10 highlighting the similarity between uri-
nary and faecal bacteria, and the potential for transfer of resistant
bacteria capable of causing infection. Escherichia coli is the most
commonly isolated bacterium from urine, often present at both
lower and higher growth counts; therefore, it is reasonable to

 assume that bacteria commonly contaminating the urinary
tract in healthy asymptomatic individuals are representative of
the patients’ faecal flora and are the same organisms associated
with UTI.
As key transmitters of infections within communities, children
could also be both important recipients and onward transmitters
of antimicrobial-resistant microbes and infections. We explored
risk factors for carriage of antibiotic resistance in pre-school child-
ren’s pathogenic and contaminant urinary E. coli, using data previ-
ously collected from the Diagnosis of Urinary Tract infection in
Young children (DUTY) study.11,12
Patients and methods
Participants and study design
We conducted a secondary analysis of DUTY study children’s urinary E. coli
isolates. The DUTY study was a prospective cohort conducted between
2010 and 2013 and developed clinical algorithms to improve the diagnosis
of UTIs in young, pre-school children (under 5 years of age).12,13 Study
methods have been reported in full,11 but briefly children were eligible if
aged under 5 years and presenting to primary care constitutionally unwell
with any acute illness, or with acute urinary symptoms. Any child recruited
to DUTY whose urine culture yielded a pure or mixed E. coli isolate at
�103 cfu/mL was eligible for inclusion in our study. The laboratory UTI diag-
nostic criteria used in DUTY were pure or predominant growth (where urine
contains more than one organism and growth of the second organism is
3 log10 lower than the predominant organism) of a single uropathogen at
�105 cfu/mL;11 therefore, our cohort included both isolates which did meet
and isolates which did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a UTI, and are
referred to throughout as pathogens and contaminants, respectively.
Contaminant E. coli does not necessarily imply that these isolates are not
capable of causing UTI, but simply that they were present at low-growth
counts which did not meet the UTI diagnostic criteria used in our cohort.
Ethics
Approval by amendment to original DUTY study (Ref: 09/H0102/64), appro-
val on 26 February 2014 by NRES Committee South West - Central Bristol.
Urine collection and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Urine samples were collected from children upon recruitment to the DUTY
study at participating primary care practices, emergency departments or
walk-in centres. The preferred method of urine collection was clean-catch;
however, for those children still in nappies, nappy pads or bags were
used.14
All culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out at the
Specialist Antimicrobial Chemotherapy Unit (SACU), Public Health Wales
Microbiology Laboratory at Cardiff University Hospital, using standard meth-
ods.14 MICs were determined using agar dilution methods,15 against seven
antibiotics commonly tested against urinary bacteria: amoxicillin, co-
amoxiclav (Augmentin), cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, nitrofuran-
toin and cefpodoxime. Cefpodoxime resistance can indicate the production
of extended-spectrum b-lactamase enzymes within bacteria.16 Breakpoints
were interpreted using EUCAST guidelines.17
Risk factors for bacterial resistance to antibiotics
Risk factor information was collected at DUTY recruitment using case report
forms (CRFs) completed by parents. Risk factors to be investigated were
identified a priori based on a consensus approach, and based on whether
the data had been collected on the CRFs. The risk factor information we col-
lected from each child’s CRF included primary care practice, age in months,
gender, ethnicity, postcode, socioeconomic status and method of urine col-
lection (clean-catch versus other). Socioeconomic status was reported
according to the methods proposed by Payne and Abel in 2012, allowing
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores to be generated UK-wide.18
Previous exposure to antibiotics
In addition to the risk factor information available from each child’s DUTY
CRF, we also collected risk factor information directly from the child’s pri-
mary care practice electronic clinical records relating to their previous anti-
biotic prescriptions in the 12months prior to their DUTY recruitment date.
Data collection took place between July 2014 and June 2015. This included
a list of all antibiotics prescribed to the child in the 12months prior to DUTY
recruitment (or since birth if the child was under 1 year of age at the time of
recruitment), and included specific details on: type of antibiotic prescribed,
date of prescription, suspension, daily dose and total volume prescribed.
We explored: (i) the relationship between any oral antibiotic prescribed
in the 12months prior to urine sampling and resistance to any antibiotic;
(ii) the total number of oral antibiotic courses prescribed and resistance to
any antibiotic; and (iii) the time of oral antibiotic prescriptions prior to urine
sampling (0–3 months, 3–6months, 6–9 months and 9–12 months) and
resistance to any antibiotic.
Sample size
Our previous global systematic review investigating antibiotic resistance in
UTI E. coli isolates indicated that in the ‘susceptible’ patient group 30% had
prior exposure to antibiotics;5 hence, we used this as an assumption of
exposure in the ‘susceptible’ group. Based on this systematic review an
assumption of an absolute difference in exposure of 20% was deemed fea-
sible, i.e. 0.1 or 0.5, corresponding to an OR of 0.26 or 2.34. Using these fig-
ures and assumptions, the study would yield at least 80% power to detect
a minimum important difference of 20% at the 5% two-sided a level.
Data analysis
The primary outcome of interest was resistance to antibiotics, reported as a
dichotomous (susceptible/resistant) outcome. The primary outcome meas-
ure for our risk factor analysis was an E. coli urinary isolate resistant to at
least one antibiotic, versus E. coli susceptible to all antibiotics, for both
pathogenic and contaminant E. coli. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was also
reported, defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or
more antimicrobial categories.19
Children’s demographic characteristics were compared with the DUTY
study reference standard results to check the generalizability of the
study findings. Previously, the children whose urine samples made up the
DUTY reference standard culture results were compared with the UK 2011
Census data and found to be generalizable for children under 5 years of age
in terms of gender and ethnicity.14
Statistical analysis
All patient characteristics were summarized descriptively, including all risk
factors for resistance to �1 antibiotic. Age in months was reported as a con-
tinuous variable; data were transformed if skewed. All descriptive statistics
were reported separately for total E. coli isolates, and for pathogenic and
contaminant urinary E. coli. A univariate analysis was conducted to deter-
mine association between resistance (to �1 reported antibiotic versus sus-
ceptible to all reported antibiotics) and each risk factor investigated in
pathogens and contaminants.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess differ-
ences in those children with the investigated risk factor and those without.
Separate regression models were developed for both pathogenic and con-
taminant urinary E. coli isolates and reported as such. Outcomes were
expressed as an odds ratio comparing risk of carriage of a resistant E. coli in

 those children with and without each investigated risk factor. Both crude
and adjusted regression models were produced and reported, the latter
adjusting for risk factors identified a priori as described earlier, in order to
reduce confounding.
Results
Participants and urinary isolates
Of the 5017 reference standard culture results available from the
SACU at Cardiff University Hospital, 858 children had E. coli cultured
from their urine samples at �103 cfu/mL as either a pure (one bac-
terial species grown) or mixed (multiple bacterial species grown)
culture. Only one isolate per child was collected and included in
the analysis. This was made up of 79 E. coli isolates which met the
laboratory diagnostic criteria for a UTI of pure or predominant
growth at .105 cfu/mL (pathogens); and 779 E. coli isolates cul-
tured at 103–105 cfu/mL as either a mixed or pure culture
(contaminants).
Of the 858 E. coli urinary isolates cultured at �103cfu/mL which
either did (n " 79) or did not (n " 779) meet the diagnostic criteria
for a UTI (Figure 1); 34 isolates (4.13%) did not have antimicrobial
susceptibility results available. This left 824 isolates for the preva-
lence analysis and since we were unable to collect previous antibi-
otic prescription information for 110 children, 694 for the analysis
of the role of previous antibiotic prescribing.
Table 1 summarizes children’s characteristics for all included
variables. For the 353 children whose urinary E. coli was resistant
to at least one antibiotic, 75.45% of the cohort was recruited in
England, 67.42% were female, 84.70% were white, and the mean
age was 22months. Deprivation was evenly distributed across all
five rankings. Missing data for all variables other than previous anti-
biotic prescriptions was very low (2.00%); for previous antibiotic
prescriptions, data could not be obtained for 15.82% of the 824
children. Pathogens were more frequently isolated from clean-
catch urine specimens, whereas contaminants were more fre-
quently isolated from either nappy pad or bag collection methods.
This has been previously investigated and discussed elsewhere.13
Generalizability of study participants
To assess generalizability, we compared our cohort to the original
DUTY population for whom reference standard urine results were
available (n " 5107); these data were representative of the 2011
UK census for children under 5 years.11 Our study had an over-
representation of younger age groups and of females (see
Figure S1, available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).

 most frequently (in 49.37% of pathogens and 37.32% of contami-
nants). Trimethoprim resistance was higher in pathogens at
27.85%, with co-amoxiclav resistance higher in contaminants at
21.48%. No isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin. No pathogens
were cefpodoxime resistant.
MDR
Of the 353 urinary E. coli resistant to at least one antibiotic, made
up of 41 pathogens and 312 contaminants, 28.05% (n " 99) were
MDR. The proportion of MDR in pathogens was 17.07%, compared
with 30.13% in contaminants (P value 0.04).

 Previous exposure to antibiotics
Previous antibiotic prescribing information was collected for
694 children; 303 children (43.66%) had received at least one
antibiotic during the 12 month time period (see Table 3).
Prescribing data for 130 children could not be collected, either
due to lack of engagement from primary care practices or miss-
ing information on the child’s DUTY CRF. There were no key dif-
ferences between children whose prescribing data were and
were not collected. Amoxicillin was the most common antibi-
otic prescribed in our cohort for the 12 months prior to urine
sampling.
Of those children for whom previous antibiotic prescription
information was known, 56.34% had not been prescribed any anti-
biotics within the 12 months prior to urine sampling. The proportion
of children previously exposed to antibiotics in the ‘susceptible’
group was 54.25%, versus 45.75% previously exposed to antibiot-
ics in the ‘resistant’ group.
Risk factors for acquisition of resistant urinary E. coli
Of all the patient demographic variables considered, there was a
suggestion that older children may be more likely to carry a resist-
ant pathogenic E. coli compared with younger children [adjusted
OR (aOR): 1.85, 95% CI: 1.02–3.53, P value 0.04]. We also found
that children living in the most deprived areas were more likely
to carry resistant contaminant E. coli, compared with children liv-
ing in the least deprived areas (aOR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.12–2.89,
P value 0.01). All crude and adjusted results for pathogens and
contaminants are presented in Table 4.
Regarding previous exposure to antibiotics, there was an associ-
ation between recent oral antibiotic exposure (within 0–3 months)
and resistance in both pathogenic (aOR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–4.39,
P value 0.04) and contaminant (aOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.09–2.67,
P value 0.01) E. coli urinary isolates.
Amoxicillin prescribing and resistance
Of all the antibiotics prescribed to children in our cohort, amoxicillin
was the most frequent, with 308 prescriptions given to 195 chil-
dren within the 12months prior to their recruitment to the DUTY
study. There was an association between being prescribed amoxi-
cillin in the 3 months prior to urine sampling and resistance to
amoxicillin in contaminant E. coli (adjusted OR: 1.23 CI: 1.01–2.84,
P value 0.04); no association was found for pathogenic E. coli.
Discussion
Prevalence of single and MDR in pathogenic and contaminant uri-
nary E. coli was high against several commonly prescribed primary
care antibiotics, namely amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav and trimetho-
prim, and lower for less commonly prescribed antibiotics including
ciprofloxacin and cefalexin. No isolates were resistant to nitrofur-
antoin. An association was observed between recent (0–3 months)
exposure to primary care antibiotics and resistance in both patho-
genic and contaminant E. coli cultured from children’s urine.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore prevalence of,
and risk factors for, resistance in urinary E. coli from children with
acute illness, irrespective of UTI diagnosis. All urine samples were
obtained from incident cases which was often an unknown in pre-
vious studies. The inclusion of contaminant E. coli isolates allows
for the investigation into carriage of resistance in children’s urinary
bacteria, as they are likely very similar to opportunistic pathogenic
E. coli isolates which met the UTI diagnostic criteria, and to E. coli
residing in the faecal flora, an important reservoir for the transfer
of resistance genes. This study therefore contributes to one of the
overarching aims of the UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance
Strategy—to improve the knowledge and understanding of anti-
microbial resistance.20
This study also has some limitations. Firstly, estimates used to
produce a sample size for this cohort were inaccurate with a differ-
ence in exposure of 8% rather than 20% reported in previous stud-
ies.5 Our sample size was based on our previous systematic review
exploring the global prevalence of resistance and associations with
previous antibiotic prescribing in children;5 and similar to those
reported in adults previously; therefore, our study was underpow-
ered given the small difference in exposure we observed.4,21
Secondly, our cohort included only 79 UTI-positive E. coli isolates
compared with 745 contaminant isolates. However, all organisms
likely originate from the children’s own faecal flora.10 This made it
difficult to explore the likelihood of developing a UTI if their E. coli
were resistant to at least one antibiotic. However, the main objective
of our study was to explore risk factors for carriage of E. coli within
the urinary tract in an otherwise healthy population of children;
therefore, inclusion of contaminant urinary bacteria was important.
Results in the context of existing research
Prevalence of resistance in urinary E. coli
Prevalence of MDR in urinary E. coli was higher in contaminants
than in pathogens. Whilst the reasons for this are largely
unknown, as we have little previous data to compare our findings
to, this may be a result of circulating MDR E. coli clonal types. This

 was previously reported in the USA, where a single MDR clonal
type was responsible for almost half of all community-acquired
UTIs in three geographically diverse communities.22,23
Another key finding was the pan-susceptibility to nitrofurantoin
in all E. coli isolates tested. Previous research has similarly sug-
gested that resistance to nitrofurantoin in children’s E. coli is
low;5,24 therefore, our findings provide additional evidence to
support the continued availability of nitrofurantoin as an effective
first-line
treatment
choice
for
uncomplicated
UTI.
Recent
NICE guidance now recommends nitrofurantoin be used over tri-
methoprim as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated UTIs in
adults,25 but the same recommendation has not yet been made
for children; likely due to the limited resistance data which is made
available specifically for children in the UK.

 Risk factors for acquisition of resistant pathogenic and
contaminant urinary E. coli
Previous exposure to antibiotics
There was an association between the child being prescribed an
antibiotic in the 3 months prior to urine sampling and carriage of
bacterial resistance, evident in both pathogenic and contaminant
E. coli isolates. This association was also observed for amoxicillin
prescribing and amoxicillin-resistant pathogenic E. coli. These find-
ings were comparable to our previous systematic reviews suggest-
ing stronger associations with more recent antibiotic exposure and
resistance in children’s E. coli UTI and faecal isolates.5,6 Another
previous study also found a relationship between exposure to anti-
biotics and resistance in common community-acquired infections
including UTI, where resistance was also associated with poorer
clinical outcomes for patients.26 We were unable to compare our
data directly to previous studies, as the majority of current
research focuses on pathogenic bacteria only.
Policy, clinical and research implications
The findings in this study suggest high-level resistance to some of
the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in primary care for chil-
dren. Overall prevalence of resistance was highest against amoxi-
cillin, trimethoprim and co-amoxiclav in both pathogenic and
contaminant E. coli, all of which are recommended first-line treat-
ments for UTI in children. In line with recommendations from infec-
tious disease societies across the USA and Europe of a 20%
resistance threshold for first-line UTI treatment,27 it may be that
these antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin, should no longer be rec-
ommended for use as a first-line treatment for UTI in the UK. The
interplay between organisms that cause infections and those
which simply colonize is poorly investigated, but becoming of
increasing interest due to rising antimicrobial resistance rates. It is
important to better understand whether isolates gain resistance
when present as an infecting organism, under antimicrobial chal-
lenge, or before infection starts when it is present as a colonizer. It
may be that colonizing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria act as a res-
ervoir for future hard-to-treat, antimicrobial-resistant infections.
We found evidence of an association between recent antibiotic
prescribing and resistance in this cohort of children. Frequent chal-
lenge with antibiotics can disrupt normal balance of the microbial
flora within the urinary and gastrointestinal tract, which can lead
to increased risk of bacterial overgrowth and infection.28 Clinicians
should consider the impact and necessity of further antibiotic
treatment before prescribing.
Further research should focus on more than just pathogenic
bacteria, but also on understanding the connection between
resistance in pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. If we were
able to predict resistance rates from both pathogenic and non-
pathogenic bacteria (which are also capable of causing infection)
and update prescribing guidelines to reflect this, the cycle of pri-
mary care antibiotic prescribing and development of bacterial
resistance as a result could potentially be interrupted.
Conclusions
Prevalence of resistance in children’s pathogenic and contaminant
urinary E. coli was high for several commonly prescribed primary
care antibiotics, namely amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav and trimetho-
prim; no isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin. High-level
resistance could render such antibiotics ineffective as first-line
treatments, and as a result require prescribing guidelines to be
updated to reflect local resistance patterns.
Antibiotic prescribing within 3 months prior to urine sampling in
children consulting to primary care with an acute illness was asso-
ciated with antimicrobial resistant E. coli in both pathogenic and
contaminant isolates. Recent antibiotic exposure exerts selective
pressure on both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria which
can alter the gut flora and subsequently the urinary tract. This can
create an environment where resistant bacteria are able to thrive
and persist. Future research must prioritize understanding resist-
ance in non-pathogenic bacteria, which could allow prescribing
guidelines to be updated before it affected patient therapeutic
outcomes.
