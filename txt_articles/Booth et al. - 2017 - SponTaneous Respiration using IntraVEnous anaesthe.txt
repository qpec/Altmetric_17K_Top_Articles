Abstract
Background. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has been shown to benefit oxygenation, ventilation and upper airway patency
in a range of clinical scenarios, however its use in spontaneously breathing patients during general anaesthesia has not
been described. Spontaneous respiration using i.v. anaesthesia is the primary technique used at our institution for tubeless
airway surgery. We hypothesized that the addition of HFNO would increase our margin of safety, particularly during man-
agement of an obstructed airway.
Methods. A retrospective observational study was conducted using a SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaes-
thesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) technique to manage 30 adult patients undergoing elective laryngotracheal
surgery.
Results. Twenty-six patients (87%) presented with significant airway and/or respiratory compromise (16 were stridulous, 10
were dyspnoeic). No episodes of apnoea or complete airway obstruction occurred during the induction of anaesthesia using
STRIVE Hi. The median [IQR (range)] lowest oxygen saturation during the induction period was 100 [99–100 (97–100)] %. The
median [IQR (range)] overall duration of spontaneous ventilation was 44 [40–49.5 (18–100)] min. The median [IQR (range)]
end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) level at the end of the spontaneous ventilation period was 6.8 [6.4–7.1 (4.8–8.9)] kPa. The
mean rate of increase in ETCO2 was 0.03 kPa min�1.
Conclusions. STRIVE Hi succeeded in preserving adequate oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide and airway patency.
We suggest that the upper and lower airway benefits attributed to HFNO, are ideally suited to a spontaneous respiration
induction, increasing its margin of safety. STRIVE Hi is a modern alternative to the traditional inhalation induction.

Respiration and the Airway
 The use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is gaining popularity
in anaesthesia. Multiple applications in critical care have been
associated with benefits to oxygenation and ventilation in both
apnoeic patients and spontaneously breathing patients.1 2 In
apnoeic patients, the Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation
Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) technique has been associated
with a prolonged apnoeic time and a reduced rate of rise of end-
tidal
carbon
dioxide
(ETCO2).3 In
spontaneously
breathing
patients, multiple physiological benefits of HFNO have been
described, which include (i) an increased FiO2, (ii) generation of
positive airway pressure, (iii) improved respiratory mechanics
and (iv) reduced upper airway resistance.1 2 4 5 To date, these
clinical benefits during spontaneous ventilation have been lim-
ited to awake patients (respiratory supportive care, preoperative
preoxygenation, postoperative support)1 2 6, sedated patients
[procedural
bronchoscopy
or
awake
fibreoptic
intubation
(AFOI)]5
7 or asleep patients with obstructive sleep apnoea
(OSA).8 The use of HFNO in spontaneously breathing patients
undergoing
general
anaesthesia
has
not
been
previously
described.
Spontaneous respiration using i.v. anaesthesia is the pri-
mary technique used at our institution for tubeless airway sur-
gery.9 Although we have found spontaneous ventilation to be
associated with numerous benefits, general anaesthesia does
have detrimental effects on respiratory mechanics, which may
limit application of the technique in certain patient subgroups,
particularly
those
with
severe
respiratory
co-morbidity.
Propofol is associated with reduced tidal and minute ventila-
tion, increased respiratory frequency and an upper airway
prone to collapse.10–12 We hypothesized that the clinical bene-
fits of HFNO to oxygenation, ventilation and upper airway
patency described in awake and sedated patients would be
ideally suited to spontaneously breathing patients undergoing
general anaesthesia. We report our initial experience combining
HFNO with our previously described spontaneous respiration
technique using i.v. anaesthesia in patients undergoing micro-
laryngoscopic surgery.
Methods
This study was conducted at the Princess Alexandra Hospital,
which is a teaching hospital in Brisbane, Australia, with an adult
tertiary ENT/Head and Neck surgical centre. Human Research
Ethics Committee approval from the Metro South Hospital and
Health Service (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) was obtained
before commencing the study (HREC/16/QPAH/471).
Between February 2016 and October 2016, a SponTaneous
Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal
oxygen (STRIVE Hi) technique was performed on 30 adult
patients presenting for elective microlaryngoscopic surgery.
Inclusion criteria involved: (i) a clinical indication to use the
technique, based on management of difficult airway pathology
during the induction and/or a surgical request for tubeless
anaesthesia during the procedure, (ii) use of a standardized pro-
pofol titration method (“Cp – Ce ¼ 1”, see below) and (iii) use of
HFNO with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0 during the
induction period. Patients with a pre-existing tracheostomy
were excluded from the study. Every patient that received the
STRIVE
Hi technique
and
met the
inclusion
criteria
was
included into the case series after providing written consent.
One patient that received STRIVE Hi was excluded after a FiO2 of
0.21 was delivered by the HFNO device during the induction. All
of the STRIVE Hi cases were managed by one of the authors, or a
trainee under their direct supervision.
A standardized protocol using a “Cp – Ce ¼ 1” formula was
used to titrate a Marsh-model propofol target-controlled infusion
(TCI) during the STRIVE technique. This “Cp – Ce ¼ 1” protocol
has been previously described and involved a stepwise increase
in the predicted plasma-site concentration target (Cpt) during
the induction.9 The starting Cpt was set at 2-3 mcg.ml�1 and
increased by 0.5-1 mcg.ml�1 when the predicted effect-site con-
centration (Ce) reached a point 1 mcg.ml�1 below the Cp (i.e. Cp –
Ce ¼ 1 mcg.ml�1). The Cp-Ce cycle was repeated until the Ce
reached the endpoint for airway instrumentation.
The HFNO was delivered using an OptiflowTM THRIVE –
Variable FiO2 system (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auckland,
New Zealand), which included a gas blender so that the oxygen
concentration could be reduced to prevent an airway fire in the
presence
of
laser,
which
followed
the
manufacturer’s
recommendations.
All patients received a pre-induction protocol of i.v. glycopyr-
rolate 0.2 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg and lignocaine 25 mg. Pre-
oxygenation with 100% oxygen occurred using the Optiflow nasal
cannula at a rate of 30 l.min�1 for one min followed by 50 l.min�1
for two min in a 10–20 degrees reverse Trendelenburg position.
Induction of anaesthesia commenced using the propofol TCI
protocol as described above. The Optiflow rate increased to
70 l.min�1 when loss of consciousness occurred during the
induction of anaesthesia and was maintained until the period of
spontaneous ventilation was complete. Upper airway patency
was maintained in combination with jaw thrust during the
induction period. Direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh blade
was performed at a Ce of 5–6 mcg.ml�1 and Co-Phenylcaine Forte
V
R (lignocaine 5% þ phenylephrine 0.5%, ENT Technologies Pty
Ltd, Hawthorne East, Australia) was sprayed onto the epiglottis,
vocal cords and subglottic trachea. Suspension laryngoscopy
occurred at a Ce of 6–7 mcg.ml�1, which defined the transition
between induction and maintenance phases of anaesthesia. The
surgery typically proceeded tubeless, while spontaneous ventila-
tion was maintained or in a minority with a tracheal tube and
mechanical ventilation. Low dose remifentanil (e.g. 0.01–0.05
mcg.kg�1.min�1) was commenced as necessary during the main-
tenance phase depending on the surgical conditions and proce-
dure being performed. The FiO2 was reduced to 0.3 using the gas
blender when the laser was in use. Respiratory rate monitoring
occurred using ECG impedance and/or modified qualitative cap-
nography (e.g. Hudson mask during the induction or via a short
metal cannula attached to the suspension laryngoscope, sam-
pling from its midpoint, during the maintenance phase). After
the surgery was complete, a supraglottic airway (The Ultimate
Laryngeal Mask, Ultimate Medical Pty Ltd, Richmond, Australia)
was inserted in the tubeless patients, followed by cessation of
the HFNO and anaesthetic infusions to allow emergence.
Editor’s key points
• High-flow nasal oxygen is potentially useful in patients
who are breathing spontaneously during general anaes-
thesia, but its efficacy has not been assessed.
• A retrospective assessment of 30 patients indicated that
high-flow nasal oxygen may be effective in preventing
hypoxia, hypercapnoea, and complete airway obstruc-
tion in patients who are breathing spontaneously during
total i.v. anaesthesia.

 Relevant data for all cases was retrospectively manually
extracted from an electronic Automated Anaesthetic Record
Keeping (AARK-Winchart) system, which was accessed online.
Data relating to the conduct of the anaesthesia (e.g. propofol
dosing and effect-site endpoints for airway instrumentation)
were manually entered into the anaesthetic record during each
case. Respiratory and haemodynamic data were automatically
incorporated into the anaesthetic record. The duration of spon-
taneous ventilation was defined as the period extending from
the induction of anaesthesia until a definitive airway was
placed, or the surgery was concluded.
Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured with pulse oxime-
try. ETCO2 was recorded from a closed circuit when a definitive
airway (supraglottic airway or tracheal tube) was placed at the
end of the spontaneous ventilation period. Baseline ETCO2 lev-
els were also recorded using a facemask before induction before
the application of high-flow nasal oxygen in 12 patients. Where
available, flow-volume loops were used to improve the accuracy
of quantitative ETCO2 data collection, by ensuring sampling
occurred when minimal discrepancy existed between inspira-
tory and expiratory volumes. Serial arterial blood gases (includ-
ing baseline) were also measured and used to determine arterial
oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaO2, PaCO2 respec-
tively) in five patients with significant cardio-respiratory co-
morbidity.
Data was analysed using StatPlus:mac Pro (AnalystSoft Inc,
Version v6). Simple correlation was used to assess the correla-
tion between carbon dioxide levels at the end of the spontaneous
ventilation period and the duration of spontaneous ventilation.
Results
The STRIVE Hi technique was performed on 30 patients under-
going elective microlaryngoscopy between February 2016 and
October 2016. There were 17 females and 13 males with a mean
age (SD [range]) of 55 (46-65 [31-78]) yrs. The median [IQR
(range)] ASA grade, weight and BMI was 3 [3–3 (2–4)], 80 [65–98
(59–130)] kg and 29 [28–34 (19–46)] kg.m�2, respectively.
Twenty-seven patients required surgery for benign airway
pathology, including 21 cases of laryngotracheal stenosis and
six cases of laryngotracheal papilloma. Two patients had malig-
nant laryngeal lesions causing ball-valve obstruction and one
head and neck patient had a suspected recurrence after pre-
vious reconstructive surgery and radiation.
Twenty-six patients (87%) presented with significant airway
and/or respiratory compromise: sixteen patients were stridu-
lous (ten at rest, six on exertion), ten patients were dyspnoeic
(two at rest, eight on exertion) and four patients were dysphonic
or asymptomatic. Four patients had an airway diameter less
than 5 mm, the most severe of which involved a 3 mm diameter
concentric subglottic stenosis (Fig. 1).
Several patients were particularly challenging as a result of
their combination of airway pathology and co-morbidity. These
airway/co-morbidity combinations included: (i) tracheal steno-
sis, BMI 42 and emphysema with mixed respiratory failure
(SpO2 85%, PaO2 6.5kPa, PaCO2 7.1kPa), (ii) ball-valve laryngeal
tumour, BMI 32 and symptomatic emphysema (SpO2 92%, PaO2
8.1kPa, dyspnoeic at rest), (iii) tracheal stenosis, BMI 37 and OSA
(SpO2 90%) and (iv) tracheal stenosis (5mm diameter), BMI 46
and 23 week pregnancy with rest stridor and severe exertional
limitation. The other patient with ball-valve obstruction was
referred with severe stridor at rest and had experienced a pre-
vious failed inhalation induction. One patient with previous
head and neck reconstruction and radiotherapy was a known
difficult intubation.
All patients tolerated the HFNO at 50 l.min�1 while con-
scious. No episodes of apnoea or complete airway obstruction
occurred during the induction phase using STRIVE Hi. The
median [(IQR (range)] lowest oxygen saturation recorded during
the induction was 100 [99–100 (97–100)] % (Fig. 2). The STRIVE Hi
propofol TCI dosing data and Ce endpoints for airway instru-
mentation are presented in Table 1.
In 27 patients, the STRIVE Hi technique continued into the
maintenance phase and provided tubeless anaesthesia during the
surgery. In three patients, the trachea was electively intubated
and mechanical ventilation facilitated the surgery. The surgery
included ten laser procedures, nine balloon dilatations, two com-
bined laser/balloon dilatations, six debridements and three diag-
nostic procedures. Only one case required unplanned termination
of spontaneous ventilation, which occurred during the mainte-
nance phase after remifentanil was commenced. A large overdose
of misprogrammed remifentanil resulted in apnoea and uncon-
trolled hypoxaemia while the FiO2 was 0.3 and was successfully
managed with tracheal intubation. Three cases of controlled oxy-
gen desaturation< 90% also occurred during laser surgery when
the FiO2 was 0.3. Oxygenation throughout various phases of the
spontaneous ventilation period is presented in Fig. 3.
The median [IQR (range)] duration of spontaneous ventilation
using STRIVE Hi was 44 [40–49.5 (18–100)] min. The median [IQR
(range)] duration of the induction was 20 [17–21 (14–26)] min. The
median [IQR (range)] period of FiO2 0.3 was 20 [9–25 (3-46)] min.
The median [IQR (range)] ETCO2 at the end of the spontaneous
ventilation period was 6.8 [6.4–7.1 (4.8-8.9)] kPa. Fig. 4 illustrates
the relationship between the duration of spontaneous ventilation
and ETCO2, which shows there is no correlation between these
variables. Fig. 5 shows the increase in carbon dioxide measured
from baseline to the end of the spontaneous ventilation period in
17 patients using two-point analysis. The mean rate of carbon
dioxide increase was 0.03 kPa min�1 using end-tidal data (12
patients) and 0.035 kPa min�1 using arterial blood gas data (five
patients). The complete serial arterial blood gas data sampled
from five patients is presented in Table 2.
Discussion
We found that use of STRIVE Hi had beneficial effects on oxy-
genation, ventilation and airway patency in our patients with

 tubeless) to prevent an airway fire, in keeping with published
recommendations.13 14 Three patients experienced controlled
oxygen desaturation during the reduced FiO2, which was toler-
ated to facilitate safe laser surgery. The combination of HFNO
and spontaneous respiration resulted in rapid re-oxygenation
when the FiO2 was increased. No patients experienced oxygen
desaturation <90% while the FiO2 was 1.0.
HFNO has been demonstrated to improve oxygenation and
respiratory mechanics by an increase in end-expiratory lung
volumes (i.e. functional residual capacity) in postoperative
patients and patients with both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic
respiratory failure.1 6 15 16 It is likely that these lower airway
effects benefited our spontaneously breathing patients during
general anaesthesia, particularly those with laryngotracheal
stenosis. A spontaneous ventilation induction has traditionally
been used to manage the obstructed airway,17 however recently
positive pressure ventilation with neuromuscular block has
been advocated, based on more favourable respiratory mechan-
ics.18 Although negative intrathoracic pressure and reduced
functional residual capacity are said to exacerbate extrathoracic
airway stenosis19, we did not experience this under STRIVE Hi
conditions. We believe that the positive airway pressure gener-
ated by HFNO counteracts a tendency to collapse, improves
airway patency and reduces airway resistance.1 5 Furthermore,

 we successfully anaesthetized several particularly high-risk
patients with co-existing airway and respiratory compromise,
without significant detriment to their respiratory function.
The aim of a STRIVE induction, whereby spontaneous venti-
lation is maintained throughout the entire induction period
using an upwardly titrated infusion rate of propofol, is to main-
tain oxygenation by preventing apnoea and complete airway
obstruction, while simultaneously achieving an adequate depth
of anaesthesia to tolerate airway instrumentation. We found
that the addition of HFNO offered several advantages that could
increase the margin of safety of a spontaneous ventilation tech-
nique during periods of inadvertent apnoea and/or total airway
obstruction.
HFNO has been reported to reduce the risk of hypoxaemia
from inadvertent apnoea during sedation for AFOI in obstructed
airways.7 We noticed a similar benefit during two episodes of
remifentanil-induced apnoea in the maintenance phase. Stable
oxygenation
allowed
time
for
spontaneous
respiration
to
recommence after the remifentanil was ceased. Although rapid
hypoxaemia occurred after a misprogrammed remifentanil
overdose caused apnoea in one case, this was unusual and
related to suspension laryngoscope positioning. Deep insertion
of the laryngoscope isolated the trachea from the oropharynx
and prevented any HFNO delivery to the lower airway, such that
the patient was effectively breathing room air, and had a limited
oxygen reservoir when the apnoea occurred.
We
also
noted
that
the
SpO2
remained
completely
unchanged during 60 s periods of complete airway occlusion in
every case of balloon dilatation for tracheal stenosis, except the
pregnant patient (who experienced a 5% decrease). This finding
contrasts our previous STRIVE series without the use of HFNO9,
and it is likely that the preserved oxygenation using HFNO also
resulted from an increased functional residual capacity.
The tendency for the upper airway to obstruct during anaes-
thesia, most commonly at the velopharynx, is well described.12
Propofol causes a dose dependent increase in upper airway col-
lapsibility, however particular vulnerability exists during the
early stages of a spontaneous ventilation induction.20 21 We
found that HFNO splinted the upper airway during our induc-
tions. Although minor jaw thrust was applied to ensure airway
patency, no patient required major upper airway intervention or
adjuvant use. This was also in contrast to our initial STRIVE ser-
ies without HFNO, where upper airway interventions were com-
mon and nasopharyngeal airways were required in most of the
inductions.9 Similar upper airway benefits using HFNO, attrib-
uted to the nasopharyngeal pressure generated by high flow
rates, have been reported in sedated patients undergoing bron-
choscopy and patients with OSA.5 7 8
Although the THRIVE technique has been shown to extend
the apnoeic window in patients with difficult airways, the ulti-
mate benefit of this was to improve the overall process of diffi-
cult intubation.3 We found that STRIVE Hi was associated with

 similar human factor benefits. The process of securing a defini-
tive airway, including suspension laryngoscope insertion, was
smooth, unhurried and uncomplicated. We also noticed several
areas where STRIVE Hi contrasted with THRIVE, although it is
difficult to directly compare the results of each study because of
their observational nature and potential for confounding and
measurement bias. Firstly, the rate of ETCO2 increase was much
lower in STRIVE Hi compared with THRIVE (0.03 vs 0.15 kPa.min-
1), despite a longer measurement period (average 47 vs 17 min).
STRIVE Hi was also extended up to an average of 56 min in
seven patients with a BMI >35, without any difference in out-
comes, which contrasts with THRIVE, where the safe upper limit
of apnoea may be only five min in morbid obesity. Our findings
are consistent with Corley and colleagues6, who reported the
greatest benefits to oxygenation and respiratory mechanics
from HFNO during spontaneous ventilation occurred in patients
with high BMIs.
The use of i.v. anaesthesia to maintain spontaneous ventila-
tion has several advantages compared with the more traditional
inhalation induction22 23, which was associated with multiple
failures in the 4th National Audit Project (NAP4).18 It has good
airway reflex suppression; separates anaesthesia delivery from
ventilation and its use can extend beyond the induction to facil-
itate tubeless airway surgery.9 22 In addition, as HFNO is an
open oxygen delivery system, it cannot be used during an inha-
lation induction, as a result of the dilutional effect on the
inspired volatile agents.24
This study is limited by its retrospective and observational
nature. Although the sample size was small and performed at a
single site with experience using STRIVE techniques, these
patients reflect the challenges faced at a tertiary head and neck
centre. As with all unprotected airways, we consider this techni-
que contraindicated in patients at high risk of aspiration. One
disadvantage using HFNO was the difficulty with carbon dioxide
sampling and its effect on respiratory rate monitoring during
the induction, compared with conventional capnography using
a closed circuit system. Most of our carbon dioxide data
involved end-tidal measurements, which may not accurately
reflect arterial levels.
We have shown that STRIVE Hi has fulfilled the primary
objective of airway management, which is to maintain oxygena-
tion during the process of securing a definitive airway.25
Although there is a current vogue in difficult airway manage-
ment to ablate spontaneous ventilation with neuromuscular
block, there are scenarios where maintenance of spontaneous
ventilation may be advantageous (e.g. anterior mediastinal
mass, asleep fibreoptic intubation). We propose that STRIVE Hi
is a modern alternative to the traditional inhalation induction
and research is warranted to explore further applications to
manage the difficult airway.
In conclusion, we have extended the application of HFNO
to spontaneously breathing patients during general anaesthe-
sia. The physiological benefits on both the upper and lower air-
way, which have been attributed to HFNO, are likely to increase
the margin of safety of a spontaneous respiration induction.
STRIVE Hi successfully managed patients with difficult and/
or
obstructed
airways
including
those
with
respiratory
compromise.
