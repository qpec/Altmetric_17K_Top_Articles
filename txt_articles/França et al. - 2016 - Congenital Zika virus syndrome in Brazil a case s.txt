Summary
Background In November, 2015, an epidemic of microcephaly was reported in Brazil, which was later attributed to 
congenital Zika virus infection. 7830 suspected cases had been reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health by 
June 4, 2016, but little is known about their characteristics. We aimed to describe these newborn babies in terms of 
clinical fi
 ndings, anthropometry, and survival.
Methods We reviewed all 1501 liveborn infants for whom investigation by medical teams at State level had been 
completed as of Feb 27, 2016, and classifi
 ed suspected cases into fi
 ve categories based on neuroimaging and laboratory 
results for Zika virus and other relevant infections. Defi
 nite cases had laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection; 
highly probable cases presented specifi
 c neuroimaging fi
 ndings, and negative laboratory results for other congenital 
infections; moderately probable cases had specifi
 c imaging fi
 ndings but other infections could not be ruled out; 
somewhat probable cases had imaging fi
 ndings, but these were not reported in detail by the local teams; all other 
newborn babies were classifi
 ed as discarded cases. Head circumference by gestational age was assessed with 
InterGrowth standards. First week mortality and history of rash were provided by the State medical teams.
Findings Between Nov 19, 2015, and Feb 27, 2015, investigations were completed for 1501 suspected cases reported to the 
Brazilian Ministry of Health, of whom 899 were discarded. Of the remainder 602 cases, 76 were defi
 nite, 54 highly 
probable, 181 moderately probable, and 291 somewhat probable of congenital Zika virus syndrome. Clinical, 
anthropometric, and survival diff
 erences were small among the four groups. Compared with these four groups, the 
899 discarded cases had larger head circumferences (mean Z scores –1·54 vs –3·13, diff
 erence 1·58 [95% CI 1·45–1·72]); 
lower fi
 rst-week mortality (14 per 1000 vs 51 per 1000; rate ratio 0·28 [95% CI 0·14–0·56]); and were less likely to have a 
history of rash during pregnancy (20·7% vs 61·4%, ratio 0·34 [95% CI 0·27–0·42]). Rashes in the third trimester of 
pregnancy were associated with brain abnormalities despite normal sized heads. One in fi
 ve defi
 nite or probable cases 
presented head circumferences in the normal range (above –2 SD below the median of the InterGrowth standard) and 
for one third of defi
 nite and probable cases there was no history of a rash during pregnancy. The peak of the epidemic 
occurred in late November, 2015.
Interpretation Zika virus congenital syndrome is a new teratogenic disease. Because many defi
 nite or probable cases 
present normal head circumference values and their mothers do not report having a rash, screening criteria must be 
revised in order to detect all aff
 ected newborn babies.

Introduction
Reports of a new exanthematic disease were issued in 
northeast Brazil in late 2014, and in early 2015, Zika 
virus outbreak was reported, following its probable 
introduction in 2013.1–3 By September, 2015, reported 
microcephaly cases increased sharply in this region, and 
an association with Zika virus was suggested.2,4 The 
causal association was acknowledged by WHO and by 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) in April, 2016.5–7 With the steady increase in 
microcephaly, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MOH) 
set up a surveillance system and as of June 4, 2016, 
7830 suspected cases had been reported.8
Clinical characteristics of newborn babies with 
microcephaly9–11 showed that they were diff
 erent from 
those resulting from toxoplasmosis, others (syphilis, 
varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cyto 
megalovirus, 
and herpes (TORCH infections), with severe intracranial 
calcifi
 cations and other neurological abnormalities. 
In addition to calcifi
 cations, neuro 
imaging identifi
 ed 
distinctive characteristics, including severe cortical 
malformations, ventri 
culomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, 
and abnormal hypodensity of the white matter.9,10,12,13
Published case series from Brazil included up to 
104 children.9–11 We reviewed the fi
 rst 1501 suspected 
cases with complete investigation in the MOH database 
to identify those with laboratory results, clinical 
observations, and neuroimaging fi
 ndings that were 
compatible with congenital Zika virus infection. We 
aimed to classify these newborn babies according to 
Lancet 2016; 388: 891–97

categories of diagnostic certainty, and to describe 
their clinical and anthropometric characteristics and 
prognosis.
Methods
Study population
On Nov 19, 2015, the MOH set up surveillance system 
for microcephaly and CNS malformations possibly 
associated with congenital infection. Suspected cases 
included live newborn babies with microcephaly defi
 ned 
as 33 cm or less for term boys and girls, which was 
reduced to 32 cm on Dec 12 (appendix p 4). Fetuses, 
miscarriages, and stillbirths with CNS alterations were 
also reported to the system, but were not included in the 
present analyses.
Procedures
Newborn babies had their head circumference measured 
in the maternity hospital using a protocol provided by the 
MOH. Those babies who fulfi
 lled these criteria were 
reported to the MOH while undergoing in-depth 
assessment in their home states through clinical 
examination followed, if needed, by neuroimaging and 
laboratory testing (fi
 gure 1). When the diagnostic work-up 
was completed, suspected cases were considered by the 
MOH to have been fully investigated, classifi
 ed as 
“confi
 rmed” or “discarded” and added to the national 
database,14 which included the child’s sex, head 
circumference, and state of residence. The amount of 
detail available on each suspected case varied. For 
example, a report might describe specifi
 c imaging signs 
such as calcifi
 cations, or simply inform that the 
examination was suggestive of congenital infection 
according to the MOH criteria (appendix p 6).15 Likewise, 
investigation of other infectious causes of fetal brain 
abnormalities could have been incomplete or unavailable. 
Available results for all suspected cases were re-reviewed 
by a medical geneticist (LS-F), a paediatrician (FCB), and 
an obstetrician (MFS), and classifi
 ed into fi
 ve categories: 
(1) defi
 nite cases, defi
 ned as newborns with laboratory 
evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy through 
serology or PCR, independently of other fi
 ndings. The 
other four categories included newborn babies without 
laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection: (2) highly 
probable cases, newborn babies with imaging reports 
mentioning specifi
 c fi
 ndings that were highly suggestive 
of Zika virus infection, including brain calcifi
 cations, 
ventricular enlargement, or both, with negative laboratory 
results for syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus; 
(3) moderately probable cases, newborn babies with 
imaging fi
 ndings as in category 2, but without results 
for one or more of the three infections (syphilis, 
toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus); (4) somewhat 
probable cases, newborn babies with imaging reports 
lacking a detailed description of the fi
 ndings, for which a 
state-level physician concluded that a congenital infection 
was likely involved, for whom laboratory results for 
syphilis, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus were negative 
or unavailable; (5) discarded cases, newborn babies that 
were not included in the above categories. All newborn 
babies with laboratory evidence of syphilis, toxoplasmosis, 
or cytomegalovirus were included in this category except 
those who were also positive for Zika virus.
Our main analyses were based on newborn babies 
investigated up to Feb 27, 2016. To derive epidemic curves 
by date of birth, we report on suspected cases as of 
April 30, 2016.
Newborn babies were linked individually to their birth 
records at the National Birth Registration System 
(SINASC; Brasilia, Brazil)16 to obtain information about 
gestational age and birthweight. The linkage variables 
include mother’s name, municipality, and date of birth.
Statistical analysis
We used the InterGrowth standards to calculate 
percentiles and Z scores of head circumference by sex 
and gestational age;17 scores were not calculated for 
138 newborn babies (9%) because of missing values for 
head circumference or gestational age or because the 
latter was outside the reference range (24–42 weeks). 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the literature using PubMed and Web of Science 
for “Zika virus”. Up to now, published case series of congenital 
Zika virus syndrome in Brazil were restricted to local studies 
with up to about 100 patients. These case series described 
clinical characteristics of aff
 ected newborn babies, but did not 
provide detailed information about anthropometry or 
prognosis and did not compare confi
 rmed and discarded cases.
Added value of this study
We report on 1501 suspected cases of which 602 were deemed 
to be defi
 nitely or probably due to Zika virus. In addition to 
describing these cases in terms of sex, gestational age, imaging 
fi
 ndings, and maternal history of rash, we present detailed 
analyses of anthropometry and survival, which were not 
previously addressed in the literature. We calculate the sensitivity 
of diff
 erent screening criteria including anthropometry and 
report of a rash. We also show that the peak of microcephaly 
occurred among infants born in late November, 2015.
Implications of all the available evidence
The Zika epidemic has been rapidly declining in recent weeks. 
Because a substantial proportion of defi
 nite or probable cases 
present head circumference values in the normal range, the 
initial focus on equating congenital Zika virus infection with 
microcephaly should be modifi
 ed.

For gestational ages expressed in full weeks, we added 
3 days to refl
 ect the midweek value.
We used χ² tests to compare proportions, and analysis of 
variance to compare means. 95% CIs were obtained from 
the Stata command margins, from a multinomial logistic 
regression model, so that dependence of the categories of 
each variable was taken into account. A receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) curve was calculated to show the 
predictive performance of head circumference in 
identifying defi
 nite or probable cases; specifi
 city was 
estimated on the basis of the normal distribution of head 
circumference values (appendix p 12). Data were analysed 
with Stata 13 (StataCorp 2013, Stata Statistical Software: 
Release 13, College Station, TX, USA StataCorp LP).
Newborn babies reported to the national surveillance 
system were added to an anonymised dataset. There was 
no primary data collection and informed consent was not 
required. The protocol was approved by the Research 
Ethics Committee of the Catholic University of Pelotas 
(reference 55979716.7
.0000.5339).

Results
By Feb 27, 2016, 5909 suspected cases had been 
reported,18 including 5554 (94%) liveborn infants. Of the 
latter, 1501 had complete investigations (27% of those 
reported; appendix p 7). The distribution of child ages at 
the time of reporting was skewed, with a median of 
8 days (IQR 1–57) and a mean of 32 days (SD 46). 
Information about birthweight and gestational age was 
obtained for 1385 newborns whose records were linked 
to the national birth registration database.
Figure 1 shows the investigation fl
 owchart rec-
ommended by the MOH. Of the 901 newborn babies 
who were discarded at State level, 547 (61%) did not 
require neuroimaging (appendix pp 8–11). After clinical 
and neuropsychomotor examination, these newborn 
babies were dismissed, most frequently because they 
had no obvious abnormalities such as craniofacial 
disproportion or neurological symptoms, or because 
they were proportionately small newborn babies (eg, 
with low birthweight). Detailed imaging reports were 
available for 686 suspected cases (ultrasonography 
results were available for 608, CT for 121, and MRI for 
15 newborn babies); 563 did not have imaging 
examinations and for the remaining 252, results were 
mentioned but the type of exam was not specifi
 ed 
(appendix p 9).
There 
were 
76 
defi
 nite, 
54 
highly 
probable, 
181 moderately probable, and 291 somewhat probable 
cases (table 1). There was high agreement between the 
original MOH and our revised classifi
 cations: 40 (7%) of 
the originally confi
 rmed cases were discarded after 
revision, and 42 originally discarded cases were 
considered as defi
 nite or probable cases.
Missing values for the variables under study are shown 
in the appendix (p 9), which also describes the availability 
of laboratory and imaging results.
583 (97%) of 602 defi
 nite or probable cases and 
749 (83%) of 899 discarded cases were from the northeast 
region (table 1), where 28% of all births in Brazil occur.

All nine states in this region had defi
 nite, highly, or 
moderately probable cases. Discarded cases included a 
higher proportion of female and term births than did 
defi
 nite or probable cases (table 1).
Using the proportional distribution of newborn babies 
by category (table 1), we estimated the curves of 
microcephaly cases by epidemiological week of birth 
(fi
 gure 2), including all those reported up to April 30, 2016. 
The peak of the microcephaly epidemic occurred in the 
last week of November, 2015, which is compatible with a 
peak of the Zika virus infection epidemic in late February 
and early March, 2015.
Information about the presence of a rash during 
pregnancy was available for 664 (44% of the total) women, 
of whom 266 (40%) reported a rash (table 1). Rashes were 
less frequent among discarded cases than among defi
 nite 
or probable cases (20·7% vs 61·4%, ratio 0·34 [95% CI 
0·27–0·42]), but did not vary signifi
 cantly (p=0·10) 
among the four categories of defi
 nite or probable cases. 
Among 183 defi
 nite or probable cases whose mothers 
provided information about the timing of the rash, 
141 (77%) of 183 reported that it took place in the fi
 rst 
trimester, 33 (18%) in the second trimester, and nine 
(5%) in the third trimester.
Information about survival at the median age of 8 days 
when reporting occurred was available for 1212 (81%) of 
1501 newborns. Confi
 dence intervals are large due to 
small numbers. Table 1 shows that discarded cases had 
lower mortality rates than did defi
 nite or probable cases 
(14 per 1000 vs 51 per 1000; rate ratio 0·28 [95% CI 
0·14–0·56]). 
Among 
523 
suspected 
cases 
with 
information, mortality rates were 97 per 1000 when 
mothers reported a rash, and 23 per 1000 when there was 
no such report (p<0·0001).
Table 2 shows the anthropometric characteristics by 
sex. Missing values are described in the appendix (p 11). 
Variability, expressed by the standard deviation, was 
substantially larger for confi
 rmed cases than for 
discarded cases. The discarded cases had signifi
 cantly 
larger head circumferences, head circumference Z scores 
(mean Z scores –1·54 for discarded cases vs –3·13 for 
defi
 nite or probable cases, diff
 erence 1·58 [95% CI 
1·45–1·72]), and birthweight than did defi

cases (table 2). After exclusion of discarded cases, no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erences were noted among the four 
remaining categories in terms of head circumference 
Z scores or birthweight, but head circumference values 
in cm increased as diagnostic certainty decreased. The 
ratio of head circumference to birthweight did not vary 
signifi
 cantly among the fi
 ve categories (data not shown).
The average head circumference Z scores varied 
(p<0·0001) according to presence of a rash: –2·0 
(SD 0·1) when a rash was not reported, –3·0 (0·1) when 
a rash was present in the fi
 rst trimester, –2·4 (0·2) in 
the second trimester, and –1·5 (0·5) in the third, and 
–2·3 (0·4) when a rash was reported but the mother did 
not recall when. Mortality rates were 25 per 1000 among 
newborns with head circumference less than –2 SD, 
and seven per 1000 for the remaining infants (p=0·02).
Table 2 and appendix (p 13) show that discarded cases 
were notably diff
 erent from the other four categories in 
terms of head circumference Z scores (p<0·0001). Scores 
seemed to be smaller in newborn babies with stronger 
evidence of Zika virus infection, but after exclusion of 
discarded cases the diff
 erence was no longer signifi
 cant 
(p=0·56). Even the defi
 nite category infection included 
nine 
(13%) 
of 
68 
newborn 
babies 
with 
head 
circumferences above –2 Z scores (table 2).
These data were used to draw a receiver operating 
characteristic curve (appendix p 12) showing the 
sensitivity (based on defi
 nite or probable cases) and 
specifi
 city (based on the normal distribution of head 
circumferences among non-aff
 ected newborns) of 
diff
 erent cutoff
 s for head circumference. The cutoff
  of 
–2 SD has a sensitivity of 83% and specifi
 city of 98%.
Among 319 defi
 nite or probable cases with full 
information, 161 (50%) of 319 had both microcephaly 
(<–2 Z scores) and a history of a rash, and 277 (87%) of 
319 had at least one of the two symptoms. For the 
266 suspected cases with a report of a rash, 77 (29%) of 
266 were discarded, indicating a positive predictive value 
of 71·1% (189/266).
Discussion
Our series of 602 defi
 nite or probable cases is six times 
larger than earlier reports.9–11 Our series includes all 
suspected 
cases 
in 
the 
country 
with 
complete 
investigations up to February, 2016, including those 
described in earlier series.9–11 Unlike earlier reports, 
which entailed in-depth assessment of newborn babies 
by a research team, we used routinely reported 
information to classify suspected cases into fi
 ve 
categories according to diagnostic certainty.
We show that defi
 nite or probable cases were 
substantially diff
 erent from discarded cases. Among the 
discarded cases, girls were over-represented because 
single sex cutoff
 s were used and girls tend to have 
smaller heads than boys.19 The higher prevalence of 
preterm birth among defi
 nite or probable cases than 
among discarded cases should be interpreted with 
caution. The fi
 xed cutoff
 s used for term newborn babies 
led to many false positives who were later discarded;19 
this is supported by the 6·3% preterm prevalence among 
discarded cases, compared with 11% in the northeast.20 
The four-fold excess mortality is likely to be real. Early 
neonatal 
mortality 
in 
the 
northeast 
is 
around 
ten per 1000,21 lower than the 14 per 1000 among 
discarded cases; these present lower mean birthweight 
than the general population, which is compatible with 
higher mortality. Although all suspected cases were 
selected on the basis of small head circumferences, 
defi
 nite or probable cases had substantially smaller 
means and greater SDs than discarded cases.
By contrast, the four categories of defi
 nite or probable 
cases were similar in terms of sex, gestational age, 
residence in the northeast region, head circumference 
Z scores, birthweight, and survival. There were only two 
signifi
 cant diff
 erences between the four categories: 
diagnostic certainty was positively associated with 
reported rashes and with smaller head circumferences 
before taking gestational age into account.
Although rashes were more commonly reported 
in early pregnancy, these also occurred later in 
gestation. As expected, the earlier the rash occurred 
during pregnancy, the smaller was the mean head 
circumference at birth, suggesting a causal association. 
Rashes were reported for more than 70% of defi
 nite or 
highly probable cases, and 62% of moderately probable 
cases. These rates are in the range of those reported 
earlier.9,10

Malformations associated with late-pregnancy rashes 
confi
 rm earlier reports from a prospective cohort22 and 
are compatible with the strong neurotropic eff
 ect of Zika 
virus.22,23 Such children would be born with normal sized 
heads as cranial growth largely takes place up to 
30 weeks,24 but yet present important brain damage. This 
fi
 nding also raises the possibility that Zika virus infection 
in newborn babies might lead to neurological damage.
Up to 2014, fewer than 15 newborns with microcephaly 
were reported monthly in Brazil, a number that increased 
by 100-fold from November, 2015, to February 2016. This 
substantial increase is partly due to biases, including 
increased awareness and changes in cutoff
  points.19 
Nevertheless, about 40% of suspected cases are being 
confi
 rmed by the MOH after investigation, a number that 
is consistent with our results. Additionally, neuroimaging 
suggests a substantially diff
 erent phenotype from 
previously described microcephaly cases.9,10
Our time series shows that the fi
 rst wave of the 
microcephaly epidemic is almost over, which is 
compatible with the seasonal pattern of infections 
transmitted by Aedes aegypti such as dengue, which occur 
in the fi
 rst half of the year. Whether there will be a second 
wave in late 2016, either in the northeast or in other areas 
of the country from which Zika virus infections were 
recently reported remains to be seen.
Our study has several limitations, including the 
incomplete 
documentation 
inherent 
to 
routine 
surveillance systems. The MOH issued detailed 
defi
 nitions of laboratory and neuroimaging fi
 ndings 
compatible 
with 
Zika 
virus-related 
microcephaly 
(appendix p 6), but it is not possible to ascertain 
compliance 
with 
these 
norms. 
Additionally, 
the 
comparison group used in our analyses was restricted to 
newborn babies with small head sizes. Although this 
restriction contributes to reducing selection bias (because 
comparisons originated from the same surveillance 
system), these children are hardly representative of the 
Brazilian population as a whole. There was strong digit 
preference for head circumferences, and gestational ages 
were expressed in full weeks for most cases. Further, 
women with severely aff
 ected infants might be more 
likely to recall a rash during pregnancy.
Another limitation is the scarce information about 
other infectious causes of microcephaly (appendix p 5). 
Because congenital rubella has been eradicated in 
the country, we prioritised ruling out of syphilis, 
toxoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus in our classifi
 cation 
of highly probable cases.
Despite the absence of full information for moderately 
and somewhat probable categories of cases, there are 
strong reasons to suppose that most of such newborn 
babies were aff
 ected by Zika virus congenital disease due 
to their similarity with the defi
 nite and highly probable 
categories, and because of the substantial increase in 
microcephaly in the northeast region.
The high cutoff
 s for head circumference adopted early 
in the epidemic made an unexpected contribution to the 
understanding of Zika virus congenital syndrome. About 
one in fi
 ve defi
 nite or probable cases had head 
circumferences in the normal range, and would not have 
been enrolled had more specifi
 c cutoff
 s been used. The 
fi
 nding of several newborn babies with neuroimaging 
abnormalities despite normal sized heads suggests that 
the initial focus on microcephaly was too narrow.
Figure 3 shows our current understanding of the Zika 
virus congenital syndrome. Because reporting is not 
complete, some newborn babies with Zika virus 
congenital syndrome are not included in the series. In 
view of the huge interest in the epidemic, we believe that 
under-reporting of microcephaly cases is rare, but 
newborn babies aff
 ected late in pregnancy might fail to 
be reported as their heads will be in the normal range. 
Among all women with Zika virus infection during 
pregnancy, a proportion—estimated to be one in fi
 ve25—
will present a rash. Rashes might also be reported by 
some women without Zika virus. Among Zika virus-
aff
 ected pregnancies, some fetuses will have brain 
abnormalities and microcephaly, others will have 
abnormalities with normal head sizes, and presumably 
others will not be aff
 ected.
The sensitivity of microcephaly alone to detect defi
 nite 
or probable cases was 83% (95% CI 79–86), and this 
increased slightly to 87% (84–90) when history of a rash 
was also considered. Recent guidelines defi
 ne suspected 
cases on the basis of microcephaly or other brain 
malformations; probable cases are further defi
 ned in 
terms of imaging fi
 ndings or the report of a rash during

pregnancy.26 Our positive predictive value of a rash 
among suspected cases was only 71∙1%, suggesting that 
these guidelines might have to be revisited.
Knowledge about Zika virus congenital syndrome is 
quickly evolving. At present, the relative sizes of the areas 
in fi
 gure 3 cannot be determined with certainty. 
Additionally, sizes will vary according to the intensity of 
Zika virus exposure in the birth cohort. There is no 
question, however, that just as our review shows that 
most suspected cases ended up being normal newborn 
babies with small heads, focusing on microcephaly alone 
will underestimate the true magnitude of this major 
epidemic.
