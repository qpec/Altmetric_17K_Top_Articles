the popularly of open cold water swimming, it is timely to review the various human responses to
cold water immersion (CWI) and consider the strength of the claims made for the effects of CWI.
As a consequence, in this review we look at the history of CWI and examine CWI as a precursor
to drowning, cardiac arrest and hypothermia. We also assess its role in prolonged survival
underwater, extending exercise time in the heat and treating hyperthermic casualties. More
recent uses, such as in the prevention of inflammation and treatment of inflammation-related
conditions, are also considered. It is concluded that the evidence base for the different claims
made for CWI are varied, and although in most instances there seems to be a credible rationale
for the benefits or otherwise of CWI, in some instances the supporting data remain at the level
of anecdotal speculation. Clear directions and requirements for future research are indicated by

Introduction: history
For centuries, cold water has been regarded as both ‘hero’
and ‘villain’, as having both beneficial and detrimental
effects. In 450 BC, Herodotus, describing the ill-fated
seaborne expedition of the Persian General Mardonius,
wrote, ‘ . . . those who could not swim perished from that
cause, others from the cold’. In December 1790, Dr James
Currie, a physician, stood with a crowd unable to help
as the crew of a stranded American sailing ship fell into
the 5°C sea and drowned. This experience led Currie to
undertake the first recorded experiments on the effects of
cold water immersion (CWI) on humans.
Claims for the health benefits of cool and CWI, spa or
sea, also date back centuries. According to Hippocrates,
water therapy allayed lassitude, and Thomas Jefferson
used a cold foot bath every morning for six decades to
‘maintain his good health’. Largely anecdotal evidence
extols the virtues of CWI or cold water swimming as a
means of improving well-being and health (Digby, 1587,
cited by Parr, 2011). These health benefits are believed
to be a consequence of the physiological responses and
biochemical milieu that occur from exposure to cold water
(Huttunen et al. 2004; Kukkonen-Harjula & Kauppinen,
2006). Physiological changes occur acutely during CWI,
with repeated bouts of CWI adaptive responses develop
that may also impact upon indices of health.
Inthemiddleages,peopledid notlearn toswimbecause
they would then not be able to cross the river Styx when
condemned to enter hell. In 1538, Wynmann wrote the
first swimming book in an attempt to introduce a ‘human
stroke’ and thereby reduce the number of drownings.
As early as 1750, published work recommended sea
swimming (and sea water drinking!) for the treatment
of a range of diseases (Russell, 1755; Buchan, 1769), with
winter considered the best time to engage in the activity.
Sea bathing reached a peak in popularity in the late 18th
century around the time of the development of the ‘swim
suit’ and ‘bathing machine’ (Fig. 1). Whole communities,
seaside resorts, were founded on the perceived health
benefits of sea swimming. The hazard associated with this
health benefit led to the introduction of beach lifeguarding
(Tipton & Wooler, 2016). The modern age of open water
swimming, as opposed to bathing, probably began on
3 May 1810, when Lord Byron swam several miles across
the Dardanelles (Hellespont) from Europe to Asia.
Recently, there has been a significant growth in the
numberofpeopleengaginginopen,coldwaterswimming,
in terms of both competitions (ice swimming, marathon
swimming, winter swimming and triathlon) and general
‘wild swimming’. With increased participation have come
renewed and enthusiastic claims for the physiological
and psychological health benefits associated with CWI.
It therefore seems timely to review the evidence for the
hazards and benefits associated with the stress of CWI.
Cold water: hazards
In 2012, an estimated 372,000 people (42 per hour) died
from immersion, assumed to be drowning. Immersion
is the third leading cause of unintentional injury-related
death, accounting for 7% of all such deaths (World Health
Organization, 2014). These figures are underestimations
owing to poor reporting in many Third World countries
that have a high number of deaths. The data also do not
include life-long morbidity caused by immersion-related
injuries,estimatedtobeamuchbiggernumericalproblem.
There is no strict definition of ‘cold water’. Given that
some of the hazardous responses to cold water appear
to peak on immersion somewhere between 15 and 10°C,
it is reasonable to say that cold water is water <15°C
(Tipton et al. 1991). However, the thermoneutral water
temperature for a resting naked individual is �35°C, so
it is possible for individuals to become very cold, with
time, on immersion in water below this temperature. The
correspondingtemperatureforthoseexercising(including
shivering) is �25°C (Tipton & Golden, 1998).
Historically, the threat associated with CWI was
regarded in terms of hypothermia or a reduction in deep
body temperature below 35°C. This belief was established
as a result of the Titanic disaster and supported by data
obtained during maritime conflicts of World War II.
However, more recently, a significant body of statistical,
anecdotal and experimental evidence has pointed towards

Cold water immersion: kill or cure?
other causes of death on immersion. For example, in 1977
a Home Office Report revealed that �55% of the annual
open water deaths in the UK occurred within 3 m of a safe
refuge (42% within 2 m), and two-thirds of those who
died were regarded as ‘good swimmers’. This evidence
suggests more rapid incapacitation than can occur with
whole-body cooling and consequent hypothermia.
The following four stages of immersion have been
associated with particular risks (Golden & Hervey, 1981;
Golden et al. 1991); the duration of these stages and the
magnitude of the responses evoked within them vary
significantly, depending on several factors, not least of
which is water temperature:
r Initial immersion (first 3 min), skin cooling;
r Short-term
immersion
(3
min
plus),
superficial
neuromuscular cooling;
r Long-term immersion (30 min plus), deep tissue
cooling (hypothermia); and
r Circum-rescue collapse: immediately before, during or
soon after rescue.
As a result of laboratory-based research, the initial
responses to immersion, or ‘cold shock’, were identified as
particularly hazardous (Tipton, 1989), accounting for the
majority of immersion deaths (Tipton et al. 2014). These
deaths have most often been ascribed to drowning, with
the physiological responses of a gasp and uncontrollable
hyperventilation, initiated by the dynamic response of
the cutaneous cold receptors, resulting in the aspiration
of the small volume of water necessary to initiate the
drowning process (Bierens et al. 2016). Relatively little
is known about the minimal rates of change of cold
receptor temperature necessary to cause cold shock. The
response has been reported to begin in water as warm
as 25°C but is easy to suppress consciously at that
temperature. In laboratory conditions, the respiratory
frequency response (an indication of respiratory drive)
peaksonnakedimmersioninawatertemperaturebetween
15 and 10°C, and is no greater on immersion in water
at 5°C (Tipton et al. 1991). The corresponding average
rates of change of chest skin temperature over the first
20 s of these immersions was 0.42 (water temperature
15°C), 0.56 (water temperature 10°C) and 0.68°C s−1
(water temperature 5°C). This suggests that an average
rate of change in chest skin temperature between 0.42 and
0.56°C s−1 on the first 20 s of immersion is sufficient to
evoke a maximal respiratory cold shock response.
Morerecently,ithasbeensuggested(Shattock&Tipton,
2012) that a larger number of deaths than once thought
may be attributable to arrhythmias initiated on immersion
by the coincidental activation of the sympathetic and
parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous
system by stimulation of cutaneous cold receptors around
the body [sympathetic activation (cold shock)] and in
the oronasal region on submersion or with wave splash
[vagal stimulation (diving response)]. This ‘autonomic
conflict’ is a very effective way of producing dysrhythmias
and arrhythmias even in otherwise young and healthy
individuals, particularly, but not necessarily, if a prolonged
breath hold is involved in the immersion (Tipton et al.
1994). It seems that predisposing factors, such as long
QT syndrome, ischaemic heart disease or myocardial
hypertrophy, are necessary for fatal arrhythmias to
evolve (Shattock & Tipton, 2012); many of these factors,
including drug-induced long QT syndrome, are acquired.
Non-fatal arrhythmias could still indirectly lead to death if
they cause incapacitation and thereby drowning (Tipton,
2013). The hazardous responses associated with the cold
shock response are presented in Fig. 2.
The problems encountered in short-term immersions
are primarily related to physical incapacitation caused by
neuromuscular cooling (Castellani & Tipton, 2015). The
arms are particularly susceptible because of their high
surface area to mass ratio. Low muscle temperatures affect
chemical and physical processes at the cellular level. This
includes metabolic rate, enzymatic activity, calcium and
acetylcholine release and diffusion rate, as well as the
series elastic components of connective tissues (Vincent &
Tipton, 1988). Maximal dynamic strength, power output,
jumping and sprinting performance are related to muscle
temperature, with reductions ranging from 4 to 6% per
degree Celsius reduction in muscle temperature down to
30°C (Bergh & Ekblom, 1979). At nerve temperatures
below �20°C, nerve conduction is slowed and action
potential amplitude is decreased (Douglas & Malcolm,
1955). Nerve block may occur after exposure to a local
temperature of between 5 and 15°C for 1–15 min. This
can lead to dysfunction that is equivalent to peripheral
paralysis and can, again, result in drowning owing to the
inability to keep the airway clear of the water (Clarke et al.
1958; Basbaum, 1973; Golden & Tipton, 2002; Fig. 3).
Even in ice-cold water, the possibility of hypothermia
does not arise for at least 30 min in adults. Hypothermia
affects cellular metabolism, blood flow and neural
function. In severe hypothermia, the patient will be
deeply unconscious. The progressive signs and symptoms
(approximate deep body temperature) are shivering
(36°C), confusion, disorientation, introversion (35°C),
amnesia (34°C), cardiac arrhythmias (33°C), clouding of
consciousness (33–30°C), loss of consciousness (30°C),
ventricular fibrillation (28°C) and death (25°C) (Bierens
et al. 2016). There is great variability between deep
body temperature and the signs and symptoms of
hypothermia. For example, although the deep body
temperature associated with death is often quoted as 25°C,
the lowest temperature recorded to date after accidental
exposure to cold (air) and with full recovery was 12.7°C
in a 28-month-old child (Associated Press, 2014). The
coldest adult survivor of CWI followed by submersion

had a body temperature of 13.7°C (Gilbert et al. 2000).
There is also a large amount of variation in the rate at
which people cool on immersion in cold water, owing
to a combination of thermal factors (including water
temperature and water movement, internal and external
insulation) and non-thermal factors (including body size
and composition, blood glucose, motion illness, racial and
sex differences; Haight & Keatinge, 1973; Gale et al. 1981;
White et al. 1992; Mekjavic et al. 2001; Golden & Tipton,
2002).
The

practical
consequence

hypothermiainwaterislossofconsciousness;thisprevents
individuals from undertaking physical activity to maintain
a clear airway and avoid drowning. Thus, once again,
drowning is often the end-point (Fig. 3).
About 17% of those who die as a result of immersion
die immediately before, during or after rescue (Golden
et al. 1991). The deaths immediately before rescue are
intriguing and probably related to behavioural changes at
this time or the relief and psychophysiological alterations
associated with imminent rescue, including a reduction in
circulating stress hormone concentration and an increase
in vagal tone. Death during rescue is most commonly
associated with a collapse in arterial pressure when lifted
vertical from the water and kept in that position for some
time (Golden et al. 1991).
Finally, in this section it is worth mentioning that
because sea water freezes at −1.9°C and human tissue at
−0.55°C it is possible to get frostbite in the sea, although
this is a rare occurrence. Much more common, but less
well known and understood, is non-freezing cold injury.
This can be caused by short immersions in very cold water
or longer duration immersions in cool water. In reality, the
details of the pathogenesis and pathology of non-freezing
cold injury are not fully understood, but the consequences
(cold sensitivity, hyperhidrosis and intractable pain) can
be debilitating and permanent (Golden et al. 2013; Heil
et al. 2016). Those advocating very cold water immersion,
for example postexercise, are often unaware of this
risk.

Cold water immersion: kill or cure?
Cold water: benefits
Prolonged survival under water. Generally, drowning
results in cardiopulmonary arrest within 2 min (Fainer
et al. 1951). Quan et al. (2014) reported on the outcome
of 1094 open water drownings; most (78%) had bad
outcomes (74% death, 4% severe neurological sequelae),
and of the good outcomes, 88% were submerged for
<6 min. This percentage falls rapidly (i.e. 7.4% of good
outcomes when submerged for 6–10 min), with the risk
of death or severe neurological impairment after hospital
discharge given as ‘nearly 100%’ when the duration of
submersion exceeds 25–27 min (Szpilman et al. 2012).
However, if the water is cold this time can be extended,
with the current ‘record’ being 66 min of submersion with
near-complete recovery (Bolte et al. 1988). In such cases,
the temperature of the water appears protective, with
records of submerged survival with minimal long-term
sequelae only having been reported in water <6°C (Tipton
& Golden, 2011). The Q10 temperature coefficient, a
measure of the rate of change of a biological or chemical
system as a consequence of increasing or decreasing the
temperature by 10°C, differs for different body systems;
metabolic
and
rhythmic
processes
are
particularly
depressed by hypothermia (Q10 of �3), and contractile
processes have a Q10 of �2. As hypothermia progresses,
metabolic and rhythmic processes are depressed more
than the rates of diffusion of different metabolites
(MacLean & Emslie-Smith, 1977). The hypoxic survival
time of the brain is extended by hypothermia, with
cerebral activity, and therefore oxygen demand, falling
close to minimal levels at a brain temperature of 22°C
(Adams & Victor, 1977).
The proposed mechanism of prolonged underwater
survival involves the 2 min of drowning-related flushing
of cold water in and out of the lung cooling the heart and
carotid artery blood supply to the brain, thereby selectively
cooling the brain, with consequent cerebral hypothermia
protecting the brain from hypoxia (Golden et al. 1997;
Tipton & Golden, 2011). Evidence for such a mechanism
can be found in the animal work of Conn et al. (1995),
who reported a 7.5–8.5°C reduction in carotid artery
temperature after 2 min of submersion, with much slower
cooling (0.8°C) during head-out cooling. The cooling
rate also slows significantly after cardiorespiratory arrest
(Conn et al. 1995), further supporting the involvement of
respiratory heat exchange in the initial fast rates of cooling
of carotid artery temperature. Although slower, continued
cooling via surface cooling does add important additional
protection; this helps to explain why those who cool the

most by this route owing to surface area-to-mass ratio
advantages (i.e. the young and the small) tend to comprise
the small number of individuals who have survived
prolonged immersion with minimal consequences. Given
that the brain is preferentially cooled, other sites for
measuring deep body temperature have little prognostic
value in such situations (Tipton & Golden, 2011).
Therefore, in contrast to the problems caused by
cold shock outlined in the previous section, in this
scenario (small individual submerged in water <6°C)
the hyperventilation associated with cold shock during
drowning may be beneficial rather than detrimental; this
highlights the importance of circumstance for drawing
such conclusions. Interestingly, the same protective
mechanism that can occur naturally during drowning in
very cold water has been considered as an intervention
to reduce ischaemic brain damage after cardiac arrest or
stroke. The challenge is to find a method that can cool
the brain rapidly enough to be of value (Hoa et al. 2008;
Rewell et al. 2017).
Deliberate cooling.
Cooling for hyperthermia and heat illness.
Cooling
strategies are used by athletes to cool themselves between
bouts of exercise. Such interventions are also used to treat
those with heat illness ranging from heat exhaustion to
potentially fatal heat stroke.
Various techniques, including ice-vests, air and water-
perfused vests, have been developed to cool individuals
between and following bouts of exercise. Of these, hand
immersion in cold water and whole-body fanning with
or without artificial sweating (water spraying) have
been shown to be preferential when a viable peripheral
circulation remains (Barwood et al. 2009). This is because
these techniques use the physiology of the body to deliver
heat to the skin via the circulation rather than trying to
overwhelm it and remove heat via conduction. The latter
approach runs the risk of evoking the body’s heat-loss
defence mechanisms, including vasoconstriction, thereby
resulting in slower cooling. The same mechanisms explain
why whole-body immersion in temperate water (26°C)
is as effective at removing heat from a resting body as
immersion in cold water (14°C) when there is a viable
circulation (Tipton, 2006; Taylor et al. 2008; Casa et al.
2010). However, in the absence of a viable circulation,
such as in heat stroke, heat loss by conduction remains the
only available route, and therefore, in such circumstances,
heat loss is inversely related to water temperature (Proulx
et al. 2003; Zang et al. 2015).
Precooling for performance.
It has long been known
that prolonged exercise performance is diminished in hot
environmentscomparedwithcoolerconditions(Galloway
& Maughan, 1997; Tatterson et al. 2000). The mechanisms
thought to underpin the ergolytic effect of heat are
complex and varied but are, broadly speaking, attributable
to the direct and indirect consequences of hyperthermia
on body temperatures (e.g. brain) and regional (e.g.
muscle/skin)bloodflows(Febbraio,2000;Nielsen&Nybo,
2003;Nybo,2008;Cheuvrontetal.2010).Anyintervention
that creates a heat sink by reducing the initial body
heat content (precooling) should enable the storage of
a greater amount of heat before reaching a given level
of hyperthermia. Thus, precooling might potentially be
ergogenic during exercise in a hot environment. Equally,
precooling may be debilitating if sufficient to impair
neuromuscular function (see “Cold Water Hazards”). Its
effect will therefore depend on the nature of the cooling
stimulus (muscle cooling versus deep body cooling)
and the event (power output versus endurance) to be
undertaken as well as environmental conditions.
Perhaps the first study examining the effect of
precooling on tolerance to hot conditions was conducted
by Veghte & Webb (1961), who used different durations
of CWI (16°C), as well as air cooling, to demonstrate
that the resting tolerance time in a high ambient
temperature (71°C) was inversely related to the initial
body temperature. The first precooling studies examining
exercise performance typically used pre-exercise cold
air
exposure,
rather
than
CWI,
and
investigated
performance
in
relatively
temperate
environmental
conditions
(18–24°C).
Nevertheless,
these
studies
demonstrated that reducing initial body heat content
resulted in reduced thermophysiological strain and
improved exercise performance (Schmidt & Br¨
uck, 1981;
Hessemer et al. 1984; Olschewski & Br¨
uck, 1988; Lee &
Haymes, 1995), although the combination of suboptimal
convective cooling and relatively high metabolic rates in
these studies would probably have induced a potentially
limiting thermal burden, even in these relatively benign
ambient conditions (Ely et al. 2007). However, because the
thermal conductivity of water is 24 times that of air, and
the energy required to heat a given volume of water by 1°C
is 3500 times that of air, the cooling power of cold water in
terms of human deep body temperature is approximately
three times that of cold air at the same temperature (Smith
& Hanna, 1975). Consequently, a given rate of heat loss can
be achieved at a higher temperature, and with a narrower
skin–environment temperature gradient in water, than
in air (Marino, 2002). Indeed, there is evidence from
meta-analysis that CWI is more effective than all other
types of precooling interventions (Jones et al. 2012)
Perhaps the seminal study examining the effectiveness
of pre-exercise CWI on exercise performance in the heat is
thatofBoothetal.(1997).Usingacounterbalanceddesign,
they got eight trained participants [average maximal
oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2 max) = 63.1 ml kg−1 min−1] to
undertake a 30 min run in hot, humid conditions (32°C,

60% relative humidity) on two occasions, i.e. with or
without(control)priorCWI.TheCWIconsistedof60min
of immersion in water which, to minimize discomfort,
was progressively cooled from �29 to �23°C. This
reduced the pre-exercise rectal temperature (Tre), mean
skin temperature (Tsk) and heart rate by �0.7°C, 5.9°C
and 13%, respectively. The reduced Tre, Tsk and heart
rate persisted for 20, 25 and 10 min, respectively during
the exercise bout and enabled the participants to run
significantly further than in the control condition (average
304 m). A similarly influential study was undertaken
by Gonz´
alez-Alonso et al. (1999), in which participants
undergoing 30 min of CWI at 17°C had an initial
average oesophageal temperature (Toes) of 35.9°C and
were subsequently able to cycle for 63 min at 60% ˙
VO2 max
in a hot environment (40°C, 19% relative humidity),
whereas immersion in 36°C water resulted in an initial Toes
of 37.4°C and an average time to exhaustion of 46 min.
After warm water immersion (40°C), a starting Toes of
38.2°C and time to exhaustion of 28 min were recorded.
Numerous subsequent studies have confirmed the efficacy
of precooling by CWI (e.g. Duffield et al. 2010; Siegel et al.
2012; Skein et al. 2012).
However, it should be noted that, in accordance with
Newton’s cooling law (Newton, 1700) and the heat
transfer equation (Fourier, 1807), in a hot environment
precooling increases the rate of heat transfer between the
human body and the environment as a consequence of an
increased thermal gradient (Taylor et al. 2014). The onset
of sweating is also delayed during exercise after precooling
(Wilson et al. 2002), which will diminish evaporative heat
loss. As a result, a precooled individual will gain heat
more rapidly than a hotter individual until convergence
at a common temperature (Booth et al. 2004). Thus,
although precooling by CWI represents an effective
strategy for enhancing endurance exercise performance
in a hot environment, its efficacy may be limited to
exercise durations shorter than the time taken for body
temperature to converge with that in non-precooled
conditions.
Postexercise CWI for recovery.
The use of CWI after
intense exercise is prevalent among sports people and
primarily stems from the belief that CWI facilitates
aspects of recovery and regeneration, thereby conferring
a potential training and performance advantage (Versey
et al. 2013; Leeder et al. 2015). The potential negative
aspects of postexercise immersion in ice-cold water, such
as non-freezing cold injury (see “Cold Water Hazards”),
often do not seem to be considered.
The physiological mechanisms by which postexercise
CWI influences recovery are not entirely clear (White
& Wells, 2013), but are most probably related to effects
of removal of body heat, reduced tissue temperature
and hydrostatic pressure effects, rather than to the cold
shock response (Fig. 4). For example, decreased tissue
temperature may reduce acetylcholine production and
lower nerve conduction velocity (Abramson et al. 1966)
and the firing rate of the muscle spindles (Ottoson,
1965). These alterations could decrease muscle spasm
and exert an analgesic effect (Meeusen & Lievens, 1986;
Wilcock et al. 2006). Alternatively, hydrostatic pressure

space, promoting the re-absorption of interstitial fluid
in a manner similar to compression stockings (Partsch
et al. 2004). Cold and hydrostatic pressure could also act
synergistically; decreased muscle temperature may reduce
oedema by reducing muscle perfusion (cold-induced
vasoconstriction) and fluid diffusion into the interstitial
space (Yanagisawa & Fukubayashi, 2010; Gregson et al.
2011), as well as through reduced permeability of the
cellular, lymphatic and capillary vessels (Cot´
e et al. 1988).
This might complement any hydrostatic pressure effects
on interstitial–intravascular fluid movement.
Regardless of the underlying mechanism, reduced
oedema is hypothesized to preserve the oxygen supply
to cells better; this supply may otherwise become
compromisedbylocalswellingandtheassociatedcapillary
constriction (Wilcock et al. 2006), although the extent
to which this is offset by the decreased perfusion is
unclear. Additionally, a decreased tissue temperature
should, as noted above, reduce the metabolic rate and
oxygen requirement of the cooled tissue (Drinkwater,
2008).Together,theseeffectscouldlessenexercise-induced
inflammation by decreasing hypoxic cell death or damage
and, by reducing the infiltration of leucocytes and
monocytes, minimize secondary tissue damage (Swenson
et al. 1996; Wilcock et al. 2006). Similar claims have been
made for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Kindwall, 1995).
Given these potential benefits, it is unsurprising that
the use of CWI for facilitating recovery has received
considerable attention within the literature. Indeed, a wide
variety of protocols have been investigated, with variations
in terms of the exercise ‘insult’, the timing of immersion
after exercise, the temperature, duration and depth of
immersion and the outcome measure reported. Thus,
given the potential mechanisms of action it is perhaps
not unexpected that there is variation in the reported
efficacy of CWI within the literature (White & Wells,
2013), with some studies supporting the efficacy of CWI
forrecovery(e.g.Baileyetal.2007;Vaileetal.2008;Ingram
et al. 2009) and others showing no benefit (e.g. Goodall
& Howatson, 2008; Corbett et al. 2012; Leeder et al.
2015). Nevertheless, meta-analyses (Leeder et al. 2012;
Machado et al. 2016) and a Cochrane systematic review
(Bleakleyetal.2012)oftherelevantstudieshaveconcluded
that CWI is effective at reducing perceived postexercise
muscle soreness, with some meta-analytic evidence also
supporting the effectiveness of CWI in reducing blood
creatinekinaseconcentrationsandimprovingtherecovery
of muscle power (Leeder et al. 2012). However, this
assertion should be tempered by the fact that, given the
nature of the intervention, it is difficult to administer a
true placebo in these studies. In one study that did include
a placebo treatment, the effect of CWI was found to be no
bigger than the placebo effect (Broatch et al. 2014).
It seems reasonable that the control conditions for such
studies should be the widely used active recovery rather
than nothing (rest). Indeed, recent research has reported
that infiltration of inflammatory cells, mRNA expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophins, and
the subcellular translocation of heat shock proteins
did not differ significantly between CWI and active
recovery groups after a single bout of resistance exercise.
This suggests that CWI is no more effective than
active recovery for reducing inflammation or cellular
stress in this single-bout exercise model (Peake et al.
2017).
Finally, if CWI reduces the inflammatory response to
exercise-induced trauma, and this response is important
for beneficial adaptations to repeated exercise bouts, i.e.
training, then CWI may in fact be counter-productive
(Schoenfeld, 2012). Indeed, recent evidence indicates that
CWI during a 12 week training programme attenuated
long-term gains in muscle mass and strength and blunted
the activation of key proteins and satellite cells in
skeletal muscle up to 2 days after resistance exercise
(Roberts et al. 2015). However, CWI may enhance
other aspects of the adaptive response to exercise.
Ihsan et al. (2014) have shown that a 15 min leg
immersion in 10°C water after a single exercise bout
consisting of 30 min submaximal running followed
by intermittent running to exhaustion enhances the
gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a key regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis, and vascular and metabolic
adaptations to exercise. Allan et al. (2017) have presented
similar evidence for increased PGC-1α expression with
leg CWI, but also demonstrated increased PGC-1α in
the non-immersed leg (relative to control conditions),
suggesting that this is a systemic response to CWI,
possibly as a consequence of β-adrenergic activation of
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
Importantly, these effects do not appear to be
confined to a single bout of exercise and CWI,
with Ihsan et al. (2015) demonstrating that some
(e.g. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, AMPK and
mitochondrial proteins complex I, complex III and
β-HAD), although not all, indices of mitochondrial
biogenesis were increased when individuals underwent
postexercise CWI after three sessions per week of
endurancetrainingfor4weeks.However,thephysiological
significance of these findings remains unclear, with
Yamane et al. (2006) reporting attenuated improvements
in
˙
VO2 max when CWI was used after training in a
4 week endurance training programme consisting of
three or four training sessions per week; it has been
suggested that CWI may dissociate the relationship
between mitochondrial content and exercise performance,
and the increase in mitochondrial content could be offset
by increased uncoupled mitochondrial respiration (Ihsan
et al. 2015). More work is required to elucidate these
potentially conflicting responses and to establish the

exposures) required to produce them.
Inflammation. Keeping with the topic of inflammation,
there
is
an
expanding
body
of
evidence
linking
inflammation with health and disease. It has been
shown that centenarians and supercentenarians have
lower levels of inflammation than community-living
very old (85- to 99-year-old) people (Arai et al. 2015).
This study also showed that although centenarians and
their offspring were able to maintain long telomeres,
telomere length was not a predictor of successful ageing,
whereas a low inflammation score was. Inflammation
has also been associated with conditions including atrial
fibrillation (Boos et al. 2006; Dernellis & Panaretou,
2004), atherosclerosis (Hansson, 2005), inflammatory
bowel disease (Kaser et al. 2010), type 2 diabetes (Donath
&Shoelson2011),Alzheimer’sdisease(Wyss-Coray,2006)
and depression (Miller & Raison, 2016).
Modification of the inflammatory response has been
associated with improved outcomes in both atrial
fibrillation (Dernellis & Panaretou, 2004) and depression
(M¨
uller et al. 2006). Cold water habituation has also been
shown to improve insulin sensitivity (Hanssen et al. 2015).
Certainly, habitual exercise is recognized as a therapeutic
intervention for type 2 diabetes (Boul´
e et al. 2001; Sigal
et al. 2006).
As noted, historical documents and anecdotal evidence
extol the virtues of CWI or cold water swimming as a
means of improving well-being and health (Digby, 1587,
citedbyParr,2011).Thesehealthbenefitsarebelievedtobe
a consequence of the physiological responses to CWI and,
particularly, alterations in these responses with cold water
adaptation (Huttunen et al. 2004; Kukkonen-Harjula &
Kauppinen, 2006). However, although controlled trials
investigating the therapeutic use of CWI are lacking, there
is a theoretical, physiological basis suggesting that this is
an area worthy of investigation (Shevchuk, 2008; Harper,
2012).
The aim of any therapeutic intervention should
be to reduce the magnitude of pro-inflammatory
triggers, and cold water adaptation, developed through
repeated immersions, may offer such a model. The
hypothesis is that cross-adaptation exists between CWI
and other forms of physiological stress, such as surgery
or inflammatory-based conditions. By reducing the
magnitude of the stress response, some of the negative
consequencesofthismaybereducedoravoided.Anecdotal
evidence also exists of therapeutic benefit from cold water
adaptation for conditions associated with chronically
elevated levels of inflammation (Harper, 2012; Starr, 2013;
Waters, 2016).
The stress and inflammatory responses of adapted
cold water swimmers were found to be lower than
those of unadapted volunteers. For example, resting
plasma noradrenaline concentrations were either similar
or declined in adapted swimmers (Hirvonen et al. 2002;
Lepp¨
aluoto et al. 2008). Catecholamine concentrations
were elevated from baseline by two- to threefold during
CWI in those who were cold habituated (Lepp¨
aluoto
et al. 2008), but these increases were less than those
observed in unadapted individuals (Goldstein & Frank,
2001; Lepp¨
aluoto et al. 2008). Additionally, repeated CWI
reduced plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to CWI
(Huttunen et al. 2000; Lepp¨
aluoto et al. 2008). Although
the cytokine responses to repeated CWI showed no change
in resting tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and
IL-1β in volunteers, provocation by lipopolysaccharide
stimulation resulted in reduced IL-6 after repeated CWI
(Dugu´
e & Lepp¨
anen, 2000). However, the cytokine
response must be treated with caution, because the
inflammatory response is complicated, and low values
are measured before cold water adaptation. It remains
to be determined what effect cold water adaptation has
on cytokine responses in patients with raised levels of
inflammatory markers.
After
CWI
and
cold-pressor
tests,
increased
concentrations of dopamine (ˇ
Sr´
amek et al. 2000),
serotonin (Hirvonen et al. 2002) and β-endorphins
(Suzuki et al. 2007) have been reported; these changes
are associated with improved mood or the ‘post-swim
high’ (Steinberg & Sykes, 1985). However, in contrast
to the sympathoadrenal response, the concentrations
of these chemicals have not been reported to change
after cold water adaptation (Hirvonen et al. 2002).
Pro-inflammatory cytokine release inhibits serotonin
production
and
can
promote
behavioural
change,
including initiation of depressive symptoms, such as
sadness, fatigue and social withdrawal (Slavic & Irwin,
2014). For example, the release of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) degrades
tryptophan, a precursor to serotonin, and competes with
the serotonin metabolic pathway. As a consequence,
serotonin availability is reduced (M¨
uller & Schwarz,
2007), a change that is thought to contribute to the
development of symptoms of depression (Almond,
2013). This mechanism has also been found in rats
displaying depression-like symptoms; swim training
of the rats inhibited activation of IDO and reduced
the
depression-like
symptoms
(Liu
et
al.
2013).
Consequently, it has been suggested that adaptation
to CWI could reduce pro-inflammatory responses in
humans, enhancing serotonin secretion and reducing
symptoms of inflammatory-based depressive disorders
(Fig. 5). It is not clear whether this pathway is specific for
depressive disorders or if it could potentially ameliorate
other inflammatory-based conditions.
Teleologically, it makes sense for there to be, at
least in part, a common or shared physiological
pathway in the response to stress. However, even having

M. J. Tipton and others
established a theoretical basis for the effect of cold
water adaptation on the inflammatory response, it is
still necessary to demonstrate that adaptation in one
system is reflected in another. Repeated exposure to a
stressor evokes specific adaptive responses (Adolph, 1956),
but there is also a component of general adaptation,
often involving the autonomic nervous system, that is
common to several stressors (Selye, 1950; Lunt et al.
2010).
Such ‘cross-adaptation’ was shown by Lunt et al.
(2010) when they demonstrated that habituation of the
sympathetic nervous response to short-term CWI (six
5 min immersions in 12°C stirred water) also improved
the response to moderate exercise in hypoxic conditions
(fraction of inspired O2 0.12). Repeated CWI has been
reported to increase the concentration of antioxidants
in winter swimmers (Siems et al. 1999). Specific cold
shock proteins have been identified in mammalian cells
(Fujita, 1999), and cold exposure increases the expression
of heat shock proteins (Holland et al. 1993; Lindquist et al.
2014). Thus, cold adaptation could enhance tolerance
to other forms of stress by upregulating cell-protective
mechanisms. This suggests that at the cellular level there
may be a generalized response to different forms of stress,
and it is these general responses which may allow, once
habituated, a reduction in the response to a new stressor,
if that new stressor shares the same general responses.
Thus, through cross-adaptation or cross-tolerance, it
may be possible to find common adaptive responses
that occur with repeated CWI (Fig. 5) and that also
reduce biochemical markers causing or contributing to
ill health. The combination of the neurotransmitter and
anti-inflammatory responses to repeated CWI may be the
cross-adaptive link.
Although cross-adaptation is probably the key to the
therapeutic effectiveness of cold water adaptation, there
are other mechanisms that may be used to enhance the
effect. Cold water adaptation studies typically use a set,
static immersion protocol; it is more likely that in real life,
cold water swimming will be the preferred technique. This
would then be expected to provide the additional health
benefits that are derived from exercise (Liu et al. 2013;
MacAuley et al. 2015). In addition, open water swimming
is thought to offer a range of other potentially beneficial
‘interventions’, including ‘green therapy’ (Gilbert, 2016)
and ‘blue therapy’ (Nutsford et al. 2016) as well as the
communal aspects and a sense of achievement (Waters,
2016). Green therapy and blue therapy involve access to
and use of outdoor, green and blue spaces; green spaces
are open land that is primarily vegetation, and blue
spaces are bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers or the
sea. Of particular note is the powerful parasympathetic
stimulation derived from immersing the face in cold water
(de Burgh Daly & Angell-James, 1979). Studies using
electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve have been shown
to have significant anti-inflammatory effects (Bonaz et al.
2016). Vagus nerve stimulation was approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
drug-resistant epilepsy and depression in 1997 and 2005,
respectively. Since then, 80,000 patients with epilepsy and
4000 with depression have had implanted bipolar pulse
generators connected to electrodes wrapped around the
left vagus nerve in the neck, with encouraging results
(Englot et al. 2011; Bonaz et al 2016). Cold immersion
of the face might represent a safer and cheaper means of
stimulating the vagus.
At present, research does not unequivocally support
the use of cold water adaptation (indoors or outdoors,

Immune function. Cold water swimmers claim to suffer
fewer and milder infections as a result of the practice
(Brenke, 1990). A boost to immunity from cold water
is biologically plausible; CWI causes the release of
stress hormones (Johnson et al. 1977; Kauppinen et al.
1989), and Dhabhar (2014) argues that short-term stress
readies the immune system to deal with injury or
infection. Research into the effects of CWI on immune
function has produced mixed results, possibly because
participants and protocols varied from unacclimatized
individuals taking a brief dip in ice-cold water (Dugu´
e
& Lepp¨
anen, 2000), to longer static CWI (Jansk´
y
et al. 1996), to experienced long-distance swimmers
training for 8 h (Kormanovski et al. 2010). In addition,
different leucocytes and immunoglobulins (Igs) have
been measured. Furthermore, changes in immune system
markers may not translate into altered in vivo defence
(Castellani et al. 2002), and very few studies asked
participants to report real illness. A general weakness
of research in this area is that many studies have small
numbers of participants, and differences between male
and female participants are often not reported. However,
participant recruitment is difficult, because cold water
swimming is a minority activity, and non-swimmers are
often reluctant to undergo CWI.
If CWI does benefit immune function, then there
should be improvements in both immune system markers
and real health over the course of an acclimatization
programme, and habitual cold water swimmers could
have the most robust systems. However, there may be
differences in the responses to static CWI and cold
water swimming, because exercise and cold both cause
physiological stress, and their combined effect might
exceed the individual effect of each (LaVoy et al. 2011).
The responses of the immune system to static CWI were
investigatedbyJansk´
yetal.(1996).Participantsunderwent
an initial single immersion, followed by repeated CWI
three times a week for 6 weeks, and the results are
summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that adaptation
altered both resting leucocyte numbers and their response
to static CWI, with both innate and adaptive cells being
affected. Nonetheless, these changes were small and of
uncertain significance, and repeated CWI did not alter the
Ig response (Jansk´
y et al. 1996).
Brazaitis et al. (2014) immersed men intermittently, as
shown in Table 1, and found that there were differences

between fast coolers and slow coolers, with only the latter
showingleucocytosis.ResponsestostaticCWIappeartobe
strongly influenced by the protocol and the participants.
The difference in leucocytosis between fast coolers and
slow coolers may have resulted from slow coolers having
been immersed for a total of 120 min as against a mean of
96 min for fast coolers, or from the two groups’ differing
responses to CWI. The use of alternating CWI and
rewarming might also have complicated the physiological
response. It seems also that the extent of the leucocytosis
might correspond to the magnitude of the stress. Jansk´
y
et al. (1996) found no increase in neutrophils after 60 min
in water at 14°C, whereas Brazaitis et al. (2014) reported
an increase of 55% after a total of 120 min in 14°C water
with periodic rewarming.
The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain.
Short-term leucocytosis arises from leucocytes leaving
organs such as the spleen in response to the increase in
catecholamines and cortisol, to be ready to deal with a
threat (Dhabhar, 2014). Leucocytes are transferred in the
blood to sites of potential infection, so arguably the most
important part of this short-term response is a subsequent
reduction in blood leucocytes as they move into tissues,
such as the skin (Dhabhar, 2014). This has not been
investigated in the context of CWI, but Yeager et al. (2016)
found that monocytes and neutrophils did indeed migrate
into sterile blister fluid in response to a dose of cortisol
corresponding to that released during acute stress. The
29% increase in resting monocyte levels over 6 weeks of
CWI reported by Jansk´
y et al. (1996) could indicate greater
numbers in the body and a boosted immune system, but
could also result from persisting presence in the blood
rather than in sites of infection. Neither Jansk´
y et al. (1996)
nor Brazaitis et al. (2014) considered real illness, and both
had only male participants.
Almost all the studies investigating the immune
response to dynamic CWI have had participants who
were experienced cold water swimmers; however, there
were wide variations in the swimming undertaken and
the markers considered, and it is not possible to separate
out the effects of exercise. Three studies asked swimmers
to report colds or flu [upper respiratory tract infection
(URTI)]. Upper respiratory tract infection is a useful
measure of in vivo immune function, being a very
common infection that challenges both innate and
adaptive elements (Hannigan et al. 2009). The results of
all these studies are summarized in Table 2.
Dugu´
e & Lepp¨
anen (2000) found that habitual cold
water swimmers had higher resting levels of some
leucocytes than non-cold-habituated people. They also
investigated the responses of both groups to brief dips in
ice-coldwaterbut,asthiswasafterasauna,itisnotpossible
to separate the effects of the two thermal stresses. This was
the only study to consider men and women separately,
and there were differences between the sexes. However,
the low participant numbers make it difficult to establish
the significance of these results.
Kormanovski et al. (2010) monitored 15 experienced
long-distance swimmers for 6 months. Seven of the group
completed three continuous long distance swims (LDS),
one of 6 h (in month 1) and two of 8 h (in months 3
and 6), whereas the other swimmers rested (controls).
All followed the same nutrition protocol. There were
differences between the LDS group and the control group
in leucocyte and Ig responses, over both the total study
period and the LDS periods. The heavy training load may
have slightly depressed basal levels of leucocytes in the LDS
group, but a training bout caused appreciable increases;
granulocyte numbers rose almost fourfold during the 8 h.
TheLDSgrouphadsignificantdecreasesinrestinglevels
of serum Igs and salivary IgA (sIgA) over the training
period, whereas control swimmers did not. During all
three LDS periods, sIgA decreased markedly but remained
unchanged in control swimmers, whereas serum Igs
showed no clear pattern in either group. As the authors
point out, Ig levels are subject to considerable diurnal
variation and can be considerably higher in the morning.
The sIgA result accords with decreases seen in dry-land
athletes with a heavy training load (Mortatti et al. 2012),
so may have been attributable to exercise rather than the
cold. The usefulness of Igs as markers of in vivo immune
function is not established. Some studies have found a
correlation between sIgA and URTI incidence (Gleeson
et al. 2012), but others have not (Tiollier et al. 2005). None
of the swimmers in this study reported an URTI during
the 6 months of training or the 3 months afterwards, thus
no relationship was found between immune markers and
real illness.
Lombardi et al. (2011) investigated unacclimatized
participants completing a 150 m race in cold water, and
found a significant increase in total leucocytes compared
with the previous day. There was no control group,
and although it is not possible to simulate CWI, it
would have been useful to take blood samples from
non-immersed control subjects, because the stress of
having blood taken could, in itself, affect immune markers
(Dhabhar, 2014).
In the last two of these studies (Lombardi et al. 2011;
Dhabhar, 2014) there seems again to be a link between the
magnitude of the stress and the leucocyte response. The
long-distanceswimmersinthestudybyKormanovskietal.
(2010)hadnosignificantchangeinagranulocytes(mostof
which are neutrophils) after 1 h, but after 2 h the numbers
had increased by �50%, with a fourfold increase after 8 h.
The unacclimatized swimmers in the study by Lombardi
et al. (2011) showed the fastest response, with neutrophil
numbers up 38% after a 150 m race. However, this was
compared with the previous day, so some of the increase
might have been attributable to race-day stress. All three
studies report higher leucocyte numbers in cold water

swimmers, but again it is not known whether these reflect
greater numbers in the body or redistribution between
different sites. The swimmers in the study of Kormanovski
et al. (2010) were highly trained, and those of Lombardi
et al. (2011) were unacclimatized and racing.
Other studies have focused on recreational habitual
cold water swimmers. Huang et al. (2011) compared
middle-aged cold water swimmers with a sedentary
group, and found that mononuclear cells from swimmers
inhibited growth of leukaemia cells four times more
effectively than those from control subjects. However, the
controlgroupcomprisedsedentaryadultsratherthanmen
undertaking a similar amount of dry-land activity, so did
not control for effects of exercise, and the swimmers were
much fitter than the control subjects ( ˙
VO2 max 46.9 versus
28.3 ml kg−1 min−1). Teległ´
ow et al. (2014) investigated
10 male winter swimmers and found no significant
changes over the winter in their post-swim serum IgA, IgG
or IgM. As blood samples were taken only after swimming,
it is not possible to establish whether their response to
immersion changed. There was also no control group
of non-swimmers, making it impossible to distinguish
between the effects of cold water and those of exercise.
Of all the above studies, only that of Kormanovski et al.
(2010) reported real illness in those exposed to cold water.
In spite of alterations in immune markers, none of the
swimmers suffered an URTI. However, this was a small
group of highly trained individuals and so may not be
representative of recreational cold water swimmers.
Two further studies investigated URTI incidence in
habitual cold water swimmers. Brenke (1990) surveyed
85 regular ice swimmers, of whom 40% stated that
they suffered fewer, less severe and shorter infections
than previously. In addition, he followed eight patients
at a remote rural practice and found a significant
reduction in consultations for flu-like illnesses. Collier
et al. (2015) compared URTI incidence and severity in
cold water swimmers with that in their cohabiting, but
non-swimming, partners and with pool swimmers, and
found that cold swimmers had fewer colds than their
partners, but there were no differences between cold and
pool swimmers.
All three studies that investigated URTI relied on
participant self-report of illness. This has two possible
drawbacks: first, it is difficult to remember having had
colds in the past as Brenke (1990) asked participants
to do; and second, many cold water swimmers are
deeply convinced that the practice is beneficial and so
may under-report infections, whether consciously or
otherwise. The swimmers in the study of Kormanovski
et al. (2010) were monitored by a medic during their
6 months of training, but were asked to report URTIs in
the 3 months that followed. Collier et al. (2015) reduced
the likelihood of recall error by asking participants to
report URTIs each week, but the possibility of biased
responses remains.
In spite of the repeated claims for the benefits of
cold water swimming, it is also possible that it may
be detrimental in large doses. Collier et al. (2015)
noted trends for positive correlations between cold water
exposure and URTI incidence and severity, as shown
in Table 2. If short-term stress is like an exercise

that enhances the effectiveness of the immune system,
then prolonged stress could lead to fatigue and a
reduced response. Dhabhar (2014) defines short-term
stress as lasting minutes to hours, and chronic stress
as being repeated for hours each day for weeks or
months. Frequent cold water swimming with prolonged
shivering afterwards might fall into the latter category.
Loria et al. (2014) found that regular winter swimmers
had abnormal daily cortisol variations, and Dhabhar
(2014) comments that prolonged stress can lead to
dysregulation of the diurnal cortisol cycle and to a
suppressed immune response. Eccles & Wilkinson (2015)
argue that both breathing cold air and chilling the body
surface increase the likelihood of URTI, partly because of
vasoconstriction in the nose. Exercise intensity may also
be relevant: Wang & Huang (2005) found that exercise
at 80%
˙
VO2 max led to lymphocyte apoptosis. Oxygen
consumption is greater in cold water, and
˙
VO2 max is
decreased (Tipton & Bradford, 2014), thus relative exercise
intensity is increased. Physiological stress could also be
affected by swim duration, air and water temperatures,
body composition and extent of acclimatization. These
factors could act together to push the impact of cold
water swimming on immune function from ‘benefit’ to
‘detriment’.
It is concluded that there is some evidence that the
short stress of CWI may prime the immune system
to deal with a threat, and thus be beneficial. Whether
this effect is augmented by swimming has not been
established and may depend on the frequency, intensity
and duration of the exercise, among other factors. The
disturbed diurnal cortisol rhythm seen by Loria et al.
(2014) suggests that an excess of cold exposure may lead
to continued physiological stress, and this could lead to
immunosuppression. Thus, the ‘optimal dose’ of cold
has yet to be determined, and is likely to differ between
individuals. The definitive studies in this complex area
await completion.

Summary and conclusion
The areas reviewed are presented in Fig. 6. We have
assessed the evidence base for the claims made for CWI
in each area using a modified version of the Scottish
Intercollegiate
Guidelines
Network
(SIGN)
criteria
(Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 2011).
Other areas continue to evolve and are worthy of further
study; included amongst these are the potential metabolic
and thermogenic benefits associated with cold exposure
and the activation of brown adipose tissue (Blondin et al.
2014). The role that CWI and acclimatization to CWI may
have in this area remains to be investigated in humans.
The closest investigators have come thus far is use of a
water-perfused cooling suit to demonstrate that brown
adipose tissue acts as a non-shivering thermogenesis
effector (Ouellet et al. 2012).
It is concluded that CWI is a significant cause of
death internationally, and the physiological precursors
to these deaths have been identified and investigated,
although not fully described in all instances. The
beneficial effects of CWI in terms of surviving prolonged
immersion, cooling hyperthermic casualties, pre-CWI for
enhanced performance in the heat, postexercise CWI
for recovery, and CWI adaptation as a treatment for
inflammation-related conditions or to boost the immune
system all remain to be elucidated fully. Each of these
areas has feasible rationales and hypotheses, but the areas
are complex and the impact of CWI can vary from
beneficialtodetrimentaldependingonthesubtleinterplay
of factors such as the following: duration and intensity of
cold water exposure; duration of post-CWI event; degree
of hyperthermia; control condition adopted; potential
benefit of inflammation; and nature of the exercise to be
performed. In short, for CWI, the evidence base for ‘kill’
is currently somewhat more developed than that for ‘cure’.
