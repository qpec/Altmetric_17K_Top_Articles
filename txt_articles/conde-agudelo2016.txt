Background
Kangaroo mother care (KMC), originally defined as skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn, frequent and exclusive
or nearly exclusive breastfeeding, and early discharge from hospital, has been proposed as an alternative to conventional neonatal care
for low birthweight (LBW) infants.
Objectives
To determine whether evidence is available to support the use of KMC in LBW infants as an alternative to conventional neonatal care
before or after the initial period of stabilization with conventional care, and to assess beneficial and adverse effects.
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches in CENTRAL (Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials; 2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), and POPLINE (Population Information
Online) databases (all from inception to June 30, 2016), as well as the WHO (World Health Organization) Trial Registration Data Set
(up to June 30, 2016). In addition, we searched the web page of the Kangaroo Foundation, conference and symposia proceedings on
KMC, and Google Scholar.
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing KMC versus conventional neonatal care, or early-onset KMC versus late-onset KMC, in LBW
infants.
Data collection and analysis
Data collection and analysis were performed according to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

 Main results
Twenty-one studies, including 3042 infants, fulfilled inclusion criteria. Nineteen studies evaluated KMC in LBW infants after stabiliza-
tion, one evaluated KMC in LBW infants before stabilization, and one compared early-onset KMC with late-onset KMC in relatively
stable LBW infants. Sixteen studies evaluated intermittent KMC, and five evaluated continuous KMC.
KMC versus conventional neonatal care: At discharge or 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age, KMC was associated with a statistically
significant reduction in the risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 to 0.92; eight trials, 1736 infants),
nosocomial infection/sepsis (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.54; five trials, 1239 infants), and hypothermia (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16 to
0.49; nine trials, 989 infants; moderate-quality evidence). At latest follow-up, KMC was associated with a significantly decreased risk
of mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; 12 trials, 2293 infants; moderate-quality evidence) and severe infection/sepsis (RR 0.50,
95% CI 0.36 to 0.69; eight trials, 1463 infants; moderate-quality evidence). Moreover, KMC was found to increase weight gain (mean
difference [MD] 4.1 g/d, 95% CI 2.3 to 5.9; 11 trials, 1198 infants; moderate-quality evidence), length gain (MD 0.21 cm/week,
95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; three trials, 377 infants) and head circumference gain (MD 0.14 cm/week, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.22; four trials,
495 infants) at latest follow-up, exclusive breastfeeding at discharge or 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to
1.25; six studies, 1453 mothers) and at one to three months’ follow-up (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.43; five studies, 600 mothers), any
(exclusive or partial) breastfeeding at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.34; 10 studies,
1696 mothers; moderate-quality evidence) and at one to three months’ follow-up (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31; nine studies, 1394
mothers; low-quality evidence), and some measures of mother-infant attachment and home environment. No statistically significant
differences were found between KMC infants and controls in Griffith quotients for psychomotor development at 12 months’ corrected
age (low-quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis suggested that inclusion of studies with high risk of bias did not affect the general
direction of findings nor the size of the treatment effect for main outcomes.
Early-onset KMC versus late-onset KMC in relatively stable infants: One trial compared early-onset continuous KMC (within
24 hours post birth) versus late-onset continuous KMC (after 24 hours post birth) in 73 relatively stable LBW infants. Investigators
reported no significant differences between the two study groups in mortality, morbidity, severe infection, hypothermia, breastfeeding,
and nutritional indicators. Early-onset KMC was associated with a statistically significant reduction in length of hospital stay (MD 0.9
days, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2).
Authors’ conclusions
Evidence from this updated review supports the use of KMC in LBW infants as an alternative to conventional neonatal care, mainly
in resource-limited settings. Further information is required concerning the effectiveness and safety of early-onset continuous KMC in
unstabilized or relatively stabilized LBW infants, as well as long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes and costs of care.

Kangaroo mother care to reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants
Review question: Does kangaroo mother care (KMC) reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight (LBW) infants?
Background: Conventional neonatal care of LBW infants (< 2500 g) is expensive and requires both highly skilled personnel and
permanent logistical support. KMC has been proposed as an alternative to conventional neonatal care of LBW infants. The major
component of KMC is skin-to-skin contact between mother and newborn. The other two components of KMC are frequent and
exclusive or nearly exclusive breastfeeding and attempted early discharge from hospital.
Study characteristics: We identified 21 randomized controlled trials (3042 infants) for inclusion in this review by searching medical
databases in June 2016.
Key results: Compared with conventional neonatal care, KMC was found to reduce mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age and at latest follow-up, severe infection/sepsis, nosocomial infection/sepsis, hypothermia, severe illness, and lower
respiratory tract disease. Moreover, KMC increased weight, length, and head circumference gain, breastfeeding at discharge or at 40
to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at one to three months’ follow-up, mother satisfaction with method of infant care, some measures
of maternal-infant attachment, and home environment. Researchers noted no differences in neurodevelopmental and neurosensory
outcomes at 12 months’ corrected age.
Quality of evidence: Most critical and important outcomes had moderate-quality evidence.

countries.

Description of the condition
Low birthweight (LBW), defined as weight at birth of less than
2500 g, irrespective of gestational age, has an adverse effect on
child survival and development, and may even be an important
risk factor for adult disease (Barker 1995). Overall, it is estimated
that 15% to 20% of all births worldwide are LBW, representing
more than 20 million births a year, the great majority of them re-
ported in low- and middle-income countries (WHO 2014). LBW
is a major contributor to both neonatal and child mortality (Lawn
2014; UNICEF 2015). A complex process of care named con-
ventional or modern neonatal care includes interventions already
proven to lower the burden of neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Conventional neonatal care of LBW infants is expensive and re-
quires both trained personnel and permanent logistical support.
This complexity is critical, mainly during the stabilization period,
until the infant has adapted to autonomous extrauterine life. In
low- and middle-income countries, financial and human resources
for neonatal care are limited, and hospital wards for LBW infants
are often overcrowded. Thus, interventions for LBW infants that
reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality and costs would signify
an important advance in care.
Description of the intervention
In 1978, Edgar Rey (Rey 1983) proposed and developed kanga-
roo mother care (KMC) at Instituto Materno Infantil in Santa Fe
de Bogotá, Colombia, as an alternative to the conventional con-
temporary method of care for LBW infants. KMC was initially
conceived to address the lack of incubators, the high rate of noso-
comial infection, and the occurrence of infant abandonment at
the local hospital. The term KMC is derived from similarities to
marsupial caregiving. Mothers are used as “incubators” to main-
tain infants’ body temperature, and as the main source of food
and stimulation for LBW infants, while they mature enough to
face extrauterine life in similar conditions as those born at term.
Initially, the method was applied only after the LBW infant had
stabilized, because LBW infants need a variable period of con-
ventional care before they are eligible for KMC. Stabilization of
respiratory, thermal, and feeding functions has been considered
crucial for the success of this intervention. The definition of sta-
bilization is not precise; stabilization has been defined as inde-
pendent of gestational age and weight, which are the main vari-
ables associated with those vital functions. Some recent studies
have evaluated the effectiveness of early-onset KMC (as soon as
possible after birth) for LBW infants born in hospitals with little
neonatal intensive care capacity (Nagai 2010; Worku 2005). Cur-
rently, the definition of KMC is characterized by significant het-
erogeneity (Chan 2016). The major component of KMC is skin-
to-skin contact (SSC), by which infants are placed vertically be-
tween the mother’s breasts firmly attached to the chest and below
her clothes. SSC is offered to infants as far as the mother-infant
dyad can tolerate it. Mothers can share the role of provider of SSC
with others, especially the babies’ fathers. The aim is to empower
the mother (parents or caregivers) by gradually transferring the
skills and responsibility for becoming the child’s primary caregiver
and meeting every physical and emotional need (Nyqvist 2010).
The other two components of KMC are frequent and exclusive
or nearly exclusive breastfeeding and attempts at early discharge
from hospital, regardless of weight or gestational age, with strict
follow-up. However, the last two components are less frequently
identified as part of KMC (Chan 2016).
Different modalities of KMC have been adopted around the world
(Charpak 1996), according to the needs of various settings. This
diversity includes exclusive and non-exclusive breastfeeding, breast
or gavage feedings, completely or partially naked, continuous (≥
20 hours per day) or intermittent (for short periods once or a few
times per day and for a variable number of days) SSC with variable
duration of exposure, and early-or-not hospital discharge.
KMC has been reported to be associated with similar neonatal
mortality after stabilization, some reduction of neonatal morbid-
ity, greater quality of mother-to-child bonding, and shorter hos-
pital stay and lower costs compared with standard, conventional
care of LBW infants. Some researchers have claimed that KMC
is the best option if neonatal care units are unavailable; if they
are available but are overwhelmed by demand, KMC would allow
rationalization of resources by freeing up incubators for sicker in-
fants (Ruiz-Peláez 2004).
This review covered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of
KMC with all its components, irrespective of duration of inter-
vention, breastfeeding patterns, and time to discharge from hos-
pital. We performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome
of mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age
and at latest follow-up according to type of KMC (intermittent
vs continuous), infant age at initiation of KMC (≤ 10 days vs
>10 days), setting in which the trial was conducted (low/middle-
income countries vs high-income countries), and infant stabiliza-
tion (before vs after). For all outcomes in stabilized LBW infants,
we performed subgroup analyses according to type of KMC (in-
termittent vs continuous). In addition, we included RCTs that
compared early-onset (starting within 24 hours after birth) versus
late-onset (starting after 24 hours after birth) KMC.
How the intervention might work
The intervention assumes that the mother maintains the infant’s
body temperature and is the main source of nutrition and stimu-
lation, which are the main components of conventional neonatal
care (Rey 1983). SSC would allow that an infant´ s demands for

 care may trigger neuropsychobiological paths that increase mater-
nal behavior and immediate response to infant needs, as well as
increased lactogenesis (Diaz-Rossello 2008). In addition, KMC
would empower the mother (parents or caregivers) by gradually
transferring the skills and responsibility for becoming the child’s
primary caregiver and meeting every physical and emotional need
(Nyqvist 2010).
Why it is important to do this review
We undertook this systematic review to determine whether KMC
reduces morbidity and mortality in LBW infants. We believe that
this review provides a valuable resource for clinicians and policy
makers in summarizing current best evidence and highlighting
gaps in research.

To determine whether evidence is available to support the use of
KMC in LBW infants as an alternative to conventional neonatal
care before or after the initial period of stabilization with conven-
tional care, and to assess beneficial and adverse effects.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized trials,
in which KMC (continuous or intermittent) was compared with
conventional neonatal care in stabilized or non-stabilized LBW
infants. Moreover, we included randomized trials that compared
early-onset KMC versus late-onset KMC. We excluded trials if
they were quasi-randomized, or if they evaluated effects of KMC
in healthy full-term infants or in those with birthweight ≥ 2500
g, which is the topic of a separate review (Moore 2012), or if they
used a cross-over design, or if they reported only results for physio-
logical parameters, or if they evaluated only the effect of KMC on
procedural pain in infants, which is the topic of a separate review
(Johnston 2014), or if they assessed the effect of KMC on infant
colic or on neonatal transport. In addition, we did not include
studies in which KMC was part of a package of interventions for
newborn care.
When trials were reported in abstracts, we planned to include
them, provided information on study methods was sufficient to
allow us to assess eligibility and risk of bias. If insufficient informa-
tion was reported, we attempted to contact trial authors to request
further information before deciding to exclude any study.
Types of participants
LBW Infants (defined as birthweight < 2500 g), regardless of ges-
tational age.
Types of interventions
• Comparisons of KMC with conventional neonatal care in
LBW infants, regardless of infant stabilization status, duration of
intervention, and breastfeeding patterns, and irrespective of
whether or not discharge from hospital was early.

Types of outcome measures
We chose primary outcomes to be most representative of the clin-
ically important measures of effectiveness and safety for these in-
fants. Secondary outcomes included other clinical measures of ef-
fectiveness, mother-infant attachment or interaction, satisfaction
with care, home environment and father involvement, and costs
of care.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
Appendix 1 shows the search strategy for the 2014 update. For
the 2016 update, we used criteria and standard methods of
The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Re-
view Group (see the Cochrane Neonatal Group search strategy
for specialized register). This included searches of the CENTRAL
(Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; 2016, Issue
6) in The Cochrane Library; and MEDLINE via PubMed, Em-
base, LILACS (Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Litera-
ture), POPLINE (Population Information Online), and CINAHL
(Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature)
databases (all from inception to June 30, 2016) using the following
search terms: (Kangaroo OR skin-to-skin OR [skin to skin]), plus
database-specific limiters for RCTs and neonates (see Appendix
2 for the full search strategies for each database). We applied no
language restrictions.
We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing or recently com-
pleted trials (clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization
International Trials Registry and Platform (www.whoint/ictrp/
search/en/), and the ISRCTN Registry (International Standard
Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry).
Searching other resources
We also searched the Web page of the Kangaroo Foundation, the
International Network of Kangaroo Care, conference and sym-
posia proceedings on KMC, reference lists of identified studies,
textbooks, review articles, and Google Scholar. In addition, we
performed journal handsearching and contacted investigators in-
volved in the field to locate unpublished studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and
its Neonatal Review Group. Two review authors retrieved and
reviewed independently all studies deemed suitable to determine
inclusion. We resolved disagreements through consensus.
Data extraction and management
Tworeviewauthorsindependentlyextracteddatainduplicate from
all reports and recorded them on a piloted form. We performed
no blinding of authorship. We extracted the following data for
each trial: authors; year of publication; country; level of care; hu-
man resources used; inclusion and exclusion criteria; study char-
acteristics; mean or median weight and gestational age at birth,
and infant age at enrollment by group; description of interven-
tions; co-interventions; mean or median duration of KMC; cri-
teria for infant discharge from the hospital; scheme for follow-
up of infants after discharge; numbers randomized and analyzed;
numbers of and reasons for withdrawal; and outcomes. Review
authors resolved differences in data extracted by discussion and
reached consensus. We sought additional information from indi-
vidual investigators when published information did not include
the required details. One review author (AC-A) entered data into
Review Manager software (RevMan 2014), and the other review
author (JLD-R) checked data for accuracy. We processed included
trial data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors who were not associated with any of the trials
assessed risk of bias individually in each included trial. Review au-
thors were not blind to author, institution, journal of publication,
or results when conducting methodological assessments, as they
were familiar with most of the studies. When differences in assess-
ment of risk of bias arose, we reached a consensus. We assessed risk
of bias by using the dimensions outlined in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We assessed
seven domains related to risk of bias in each included trial because
evidence suggests that these are associated with biased estimates
of treatment effect: random sequence generation, allocation con-
cealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of out-
come assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting,
and other bias. We made a judgment about risk of bias for each of
the seven domains as “low risk,” “high risk,” or “unclear risk.”
Random sequence generation
“Low risk” of bias: Investigators described a random component
in the sequence generation process such as random number ta-
ble, computer random number generator, shuffling of cards or en-
velopes, drawing of lots, or computerized minimization.
“High risk” of bias: Investigators described a non-random compo-
nent in the sequence generation process, such as odd or even date
of birth, based on date or day of admission, based on hospital or
clinical record number, or allocated by judgment of the clinician;
preference of the participant; availability of the intervention; or
results of laboratory tests.
“Unclear risk” of bias: information insufficient to permit judgment
of “low risk” or “high risk.”
Allocation concealment
“Low risk” of bias: Investigators used an adequate method to con-
ceal allocation, such as central allocation (including telephone
or web-based randomization) or sequentially numbered, opaque,
sealed envelopes.
“High risk” of bias: Investigators used a non-adequate method
to conceal allocation, such as open random allocation schedule
(eg, a list of random numbers), assignment envelopes without
appropriate safeguards, alternation or rotation, date of birth, or
case record number.
“Unclear risk” of bias: information insufficient to permit judgment
of “low risk” or “high risk.”
Blinding of participants and personnel
“Lowrisk”of bias: AsKMCcannot be implementedwhenmasked,
we considered adequate blinding of participants and personnel as
either of the following: (1) no blinding or incomplete blinding,
but review authors judged that the outcome was not likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding; or (2) blinding of participants and
key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that blinding could have
been broken.
“High risk” of bias: either of the following: (1) no blinding or
incomplete blinding, and the outcome was likely to be influenced
by lack of blinding; or (2) blinding of key study participants and
personnel attempted, but likely that blinding could have been
broken, and the outcome was likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding.
“Unclear risk” of bias: information insufficient to permit judgment
of “low risk” or “high risk.”
We assessed blinding of participants and personnel separately for
each outcome or each class of outcomes (objective and subjective).
Blinding of outcome assessment
“Low risk” of bias: We considered blinding of outcome assess-
ment to be adequate in either of the following: (1) no blinding
of outcome assessment, but review authors judged that outcome
measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding;
or (2) blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that
blinding could have been broken.
“High risk” of bias: either of the following: (1) no blinding of
outcome assessment, and outcome measurement was likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding; or (2) blinding of outcome as-
sessment, but likely that blinding could have been broken, and
that outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding.
“Unclear risk” of bias: information insufficient to permit judgment
of “low risk” or “high risk.”
We assessed blinding of outcome assessment separately for each
outcome or each class of outcomes (objective and subjective).
Incomplete outcome data
“Low risk” of bias: any one of the following: (1) no missing out-
come data; (2) reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be
related to true outcome; (3) missing outcome data balanced in
numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for miss-
ing data across groups; (4) for dichotomous outcome data, pro-
portion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk
not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention
effect estimate; (5) for continuous outcome data, plausible effect
size among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically rel-
evant impact on observed effect size; or (6) missing data imputed
by appropriate methods.
“High risk” of bias: any one of the following: (1) reasons for miss-
ing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with im-
balance in numbers or reasons for missing data across interven-
tion groups; (2) for dichotomous outcome data, proportion of
missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to
induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; (3)
for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size among missing
10

 outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias impact on ob-
served effect size; (4) “as-treated” analysis done with substantial
departure of the intervention received from that assigned at ran-
domization; or (5) potentially inappropriate application of simple
imputation.
“Unclear risk” of bias: reporting of attrition/exclusions insufficient
to permit judgment of “low risk” or “high risk.”
Selective reporting
“Low risk” of bias: any one of the following: (1) Study protocol
was available, and all of the study’s prespecified outcomes that were
of interest in the review were reported in the prespecified way;
or (2) the study protocol was not available, but it was clear that
published reports included all expected outcomes, including those
that were prespecified.
“High risk” of bias: any one of the following: (1) Not all of the
study’s prespecified primary outcomes were reported; (2) one or
more primary outcomes were reported using measurements, anal-
ysis methods, or subsets of data that were not prespecified; (3) one
or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; (4) one
or more outcomes of interest in the review were reported incom-
pletely, so that they could not be entered into a meta-analysis; or
(5) the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that
would be expected to have been reported for such a study.
“Unclear risk” of bias: information insufficient to permit judgment
of “low risk” or “high risk.”
Other bias
“Low risk” of bias: Study appeared to be free of other sources of
bias.
“High risk” of bias: At least one important risk of bias was present.
For example, the study (1) had a potential source of bias related
to the specific study design used; or (2) has been claimed to have
been fraudulent; or (3) had extreme baseline imbalance; or (4) used
blocked randomization in unblinded trials; or (5) had differential
diagnostic activity; or (6) had some other problem.
“Unclear risk” of bias: information insufficient to assess whether an
important risk of bias existed, or rationale or evidence insufficient
to suggest that an identified problem will introduce bias.
Review authors independently assessed risk of bias in included
studies and resolved discrepancies through discussion. We made
explicit judgments about whether studies were at high risk of bias,
according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), and we explored
the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses
(see Sensitivity analysis).
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous data, we have presented results as risk ratios
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data,
we have used mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. We calcu-
lated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or
harmful outcome (NNTB or NNTH) for outcomes for which in-
vestigators reported a statistically significant reduction or increase
in risk difference based on control event rates in the included stud-
ies.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the participating infant in individually
randomized trials. We had planned to include cluster-randomized
trials in the analyses, along with individually randomized trials,
but no such trials met our inclusion criteria.
We considered that cross-over trials would not be feasible for this
intervention, and consequently, we did not include such trials.
Dealing with missing data
For included studies, we noted levels of attrition in the
Characteristics of included studies tables. We analyzed outcomes
on an intention-to-treat basis. If this was not clear from the origi-
nal article, we carried out re-analysis when possible. We contacted
study authors for missing data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We tested heterogeneity of results among studies by using the
quantity I2, which describes the percentage of total variation across
studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance (Higgins
2003). A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, whereas
I2 values of 50% or greater indicate a substantial level of hetero-
geneity. We planned to pool data across studies using the fixed-
effect model if substantial statistical heterogeneity was not present.
If we noted substantial heterogeneity (I2 values ≥ 50%), we used a
random-effects model to pool data and made an attempt to iden-
tify potential sources of heterogeneity based on subgroup analysis
by type of KMC, infant age at initiation of KMC, setting in which
the trial was conducted, and risk of bias of trials.
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed publication and related biases visually by examining
the symmetry of funnel plots, and statistically by using Egger’s
test (Egger 1997). The larger the deviation of the intercept of
the regression line from zero, the greater was the asymmetry, and
the more likely it was that the meta-analysis would yield biased
estimates of effect. We considered a P value < 0.1 to indicate
significant asymmetry, as suggested by Egger.
Data synthesis
We performed statistical analyses using Review Manager software
(RevMan 2014) and analyzed outcomes on an intention-to-treat
basis. If data for similar outcomes from two or more separate
11

 studies were available, we combined data in a meta-analysis and
calculated a pooled RR or MD with associated 95% CIs.
Quality of evidence
We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the
GRADE Handbook (Schünemann 2013), to assess the quality of
evidence for the following (clinically relevant) outcomes: mortal-
ity at latest follow-up, severe infection/sepsis at latest follow-up,
hypothermia at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age,
weight gain at latest follow-up, any breastfeeding at discharge or
at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at one to three months’
follow-up, and psychomotor development at 12 months’ corrected
age (Griffith quotient for all subscales).
Two authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence
for each of the outcomes above. We considered evidence from
randomized controlled trials as high quality but downgraded the
evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limi-
tations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency
across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates
and presence of publication bias. We used the GRADEpro 2008
Guideline Development Tool to create a ‘Summary of findings’
table to report the quality of the evidence.
The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the quality of
a body of evidence in one of four grades:
1. High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to
that of the estimate of the effect.
2. Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the
effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
3. Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the
true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the
effect.
4. Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from
the estimate of effect.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We performed prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary out-
come of mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual
age and at latest follow-up according to type of KMC (intermit-
tent vs continuous), daily duration of KMC (< 2 hours vs 6 to
15 hours vs ≥ 20 hours), infant age at initiation of KMC (≤ 10
days vs > 10 days), setting in which the trial was conducted (low/
middle-income countries vs high-income countries), and infant
stabilization status at trial entry (before vs after). For all outcomes
in stabilized LBW infants, we performed subgroup analyses ac-
cording to type of KMC (intermittent vs continuous). We also
compared early-onset KMC (starting within 24 hours post birth)
against late-onset KMC (starting after 24 hours post birth).
It was not possible to perform planned subgroup analyses accord-
ing to birthweight, gestational age, and type of LBW owing to
limited available information.
Sensitivity analysis
We carried out a planned sensitivity analysis to explore the impact
of risk of bias on the general direction of findings or on the size
of the treatment effect for main outcomes when more than one
study contributed data. We did this by excluding trials with high
risk of bias in their results as judged by the review authors. For
the primary outcomes of “mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41
weeks’ postmenstrual age,” “mortality at latest follow-up,” ”severe
infection/sepsis at latest follow-up,“ and ”infant growth,“ we per-
formed sensitivity analyses by excluding trials with unclear alloca-
tion concealment and high levels of attrition (> 20%).

 Included studies
Twenty-one studies, including 3042 infants, fulfilled inclusion
criteria, of which 19 evaluated KMC in LBW infants after sta-
bilization (Acharya 2014; Ali 2009; Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo
2007; Cattaneo 1998; Charpak 1997; EkaPratiwi 2009; Gathwala

2003; Sloan 1994; Suman 2008; Whitelaw 1988), one evalu-
ated KMC in LBW infants before stabilization (Worku 2005),
and one compared early-onset KMC with late-onset KMC (Nagai
2010) in relatively stable LBW infants. Sixteen studies were con-
ducted in low- or middle-income countries (India (Ali 2009;
Gathwala 2008; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar 2016;
Nimbalkar 2014; Ramanathan 2001; Suman 2008); Ethiopia
(Cattaneo 1998; Worku 2005); Malaysia (Boo 2007); Mada-
gascar (Nagai 2010); Indonesia (Cattaneo 1998; Eka Pratiwi
2009); Nepal (Acharya 2014); Ecuador (Sloan 1994); Colombia
(Charpak 1997); and Mexico (Cattaneo 1998)), and five in high-
income countries (United States (Blaymore Bier 1996; Neu 2010;
Rojas 2003); United Kingdom (Whitelaw 1988); and Australia
(Roberts 2000)). The sample size ranged from 28 (Ramanathan
2001) to 777 (Charpak 1997) (median, 110). Five studies in-
cluded infants from multiple pregnancies (Ali 2009; Blaymore
Bier 1996; Boo 2007; Charpak 1997; Whitelaw 1988), and six
included only infants with birthweight ≤ 1500 g (Blaymore Bier
1996; Boo 2007; Ghavane 2012; Ramanathan 2001; Rojas 2003;
Whitelaw 1988). Infants with major congenital malformations or
severe perinatal complications and parental refusal to participate
in the study were reported as meeting exclusion criteria in the great
majority of included studies.
Eight studies did not provide data on the percentage of LBW
infants meeting eligibility criteria. Among studies conducted in
low- or middle-income countries, 37% (Eka Pratiwi 2009) to 87%
(Acharya 2014) of LBW infants met eligibility criteria, whereas for
studies conducted in high-income countries, percentages ranged
from 19% (Rojas 2003) to 50% (Whitelaw 1988). The mean or
median age of LBW infants at enrollment varied from < one hour
(Nimbalkar 2014)to32days(Roberts 2000)(median, sevendays).
Median or mean infant age at enrollment was < one day in three
studies (Eka Pratiwi 2009; Nimbalkar 2014; Worku 2005), one
to 10 days in eight studies (Ali 2009; Cattaneo 1998; Charpak
1997; Gathwala 2008; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar 2016; Nagai
2010; Suman 2008), 11 to 20 days in six studies (Ghavane 2012;
Neu 2010; Ramanathan 2001; Rojas 2003; Sloan 1994; Whitelaw
1988), and 21 to 32 days in three studies (Blaymore Bier 1996;
Boo 2007; Roberts 2000). One study did not report data on infant
age at enrollment (Acharya 2014). In the study that compared
early-onset KMC with late-onset KMC (Nagai 2010), mean age at
initiation of KMC was 19.8 hours in the early-onset KMC group,
and 33.0 hours in the late-onset KMC. Mean or median weight
of infants at recruitment ranged from 968 g (Blaymore Bier 1996)
to 2076 g (Nagai 2010) (median, 1611 g).
Trials were conducted under a variety of hospital conditions, reg-
ulations, and routines. However, descriptions of the KMC in-
tervention shows remarkable consistency across trials. In all in-
stances, the intervention included SSC and encouraged breast-
feeding. Early neonatal discharge from hospital was considered
only in the Colombian study (Charpak 1997). Among studies
evaluating KMC in stabilized LBW infants, 16 used intermittent
KMC (Acharya 2014; Ali 2009; Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo 2007;
Eka Pratiwi 2009; Gathwala 2008; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005;
Kumbhojkar 2016; Neu 2010; Nimbalkar 2014; Ramanathan
2001; Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Suman 2008; Whitelaw 1988),
and three used continuous KMC (Cattaneo 1998; Charpak 1997;
Sloan 1994). Only one study provided a detailed definition of sta-
bilization (Nagai 2010). The mean or median duration of KMC
per day was < two hours in six studies (Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo
2007; Neu 2010; Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Whitelaw 1988),
four to seven hours in three studies (Acharya 2014; Ali 2009;
Ramanathan 2001), eight to 17 hours in seven studies (Eka Pratiwi
2009; Gathwala 2008; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar
2016; Nimbalkar 2014; Suman 2008), and ≥ 20 hours in three
studies (Cattaneo 1998; Charpak 1997; Sloan 1994). Studies
that evaluated KMC in LBW infants before stabilization (Worku
2005) and compared early-onset KMC with late-onset KMC
(Nagai 2010) used continuous KMC. In studies evaluating in-
termittent KMC, the intervention was a combination of SSC
and radiant warmer/incubator. Standard neonatal care included
infant stay in incubator only (Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo 2007;
Charpak 1997; Neu 2010; Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Whitelaw
1988) or in radiant warmer only (Acharya 2014; Ali 2009; Kadam
2005; Kumbhojkar 2016; Nimbalkar 2014; Suman 2008; Worku
2005) or in incubator or radiant warmer (Cattaneo 1998; Eka
Pratiwi 2009; Gathwala 2008; Ghavane 2012; Ramanathan 2001;
Sloan 1994). Information provided to mothers in the conven-
tional neonatal care group on promotion of breastfeeding and on
facilitation and promotion of maternal involvement in the care of
the neonate, which are critical for the outcomes measured, was
not reported in eight trials (Acharya 2014; Blaymore Bier 1996;
Charpak 1997; Eka Pratiwi 2009; Kumbhojkar 2016; Nagai 2010;
Suman 2008; Worku 2005).
Eleven studies were performed in neonatal intensive care units
of tertiary care, public, maternity, or university hospitals (Ali
2009; Boo 2007; Eka Pratiwi 2009; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar
2016; Ramanathan 2001; Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Sloan 1994;
Suman 2008; Whitelaw 1988), four in neonatal units of university
hospitals (Cattaneo 1998; Gathwala 2008; Nagai 2010; Worku

 2005), two in ”kangaroo wards“ (KMC infants) and neonatal
intensive/intermediate care units of tertiary care hospitals (con-
trols) (Charpak 1997; Ghavane 2012), two in newborn nurseries
(Acharya 2014; Blaymore Bier 1996), one in a maternity ward
(Nimbalkar 2014), and one in both hospital and home (Neu
2010). Infants were cared for by both doctors and nurses in all
but two studies (Ghavane 2012; Neu 2010). In the Ghavane 2012
study, infants in the KMC group were cared for solely by their
mothers, who was supervised by a trained nurse. In the Neu 2010
study, the supportive intervention that promoted kangaroo hold-
ing of preterm infants by their mothers was performed by an ex-
perienced nurse. Nine studies reported clearly on criteria for dis-
charging infants from the hospital (Ali 2009; Boo 2007; Cattaneo
1998; Charpak 1997; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar
2016; Ramanathan 2001; Suman 2008). The most commonly re-
ported criteria were (1) good general health of the infant without
overt illness; (2) feeding well on exclusive or predominant breast-
feeding; (3) weight gain of 10 to 15 g/kg/d for ≥ three consecutive
days; (4) stable temperature for ≥ three consecutive days; and (5)
mother confident of taking care of the infant at home. In addi-
tion, three studies included an infant weight of ≥ 1300 to 1500 g
as a discharge criterion. Thirteen studies reported on schemes for
follow-up of infants after discharge from the hospital (Ali 2009;
Blaymore Bier 1996; Cattaneo 1998; Charpak 1997; Gathwala
2008; Ghavane 2012; Kumbhojkar 2016; Nagai 2010; Neu 2010;
Roberts 2000; Sloan1994; Suman 2008; Whitelaw1988). Insum-
mary, the most common scheme for follow-up was the following:
weekly until 40 weeks’ postmenstrual age, and monthly thereafter
until three to six months of age or corrected age. In five studies, the
last follow-up was provided at six months of age or corrected age
(Ali 2009; Blaymore Bier 1996; Neu 2010; Roberts 2000; Sloan
1994). Infants were followed up to 12 months of age or corrected
age in only two studies (Charpak 1997; Whitelaw 1988).
The main characteristics of the included studies are shown in the
table Characteristics of included studies.
Excluded studies
We excluded 50 studies: 21 because they were non-randomized
trials (Ahn 2010; Arandia 1993; Bera 2014; Bergman 1994;
Broughton 2013; Charpak 1994; Dala Sierra 1994; de Almeida
2010; de Macedo 2007; Feldman 2002; Gregson 2011; Ibe 2004;
Kashaninia 2015; Kristoffersen 2016; Lamy Filho 2008; Legault
1995; Lincetto 2000; Lizarazo-Medina 2012; Ohgi 2002; Silva
2016; Tallandini 2006), 10 because they included infants with
birthweight ≥ 2500 g and did not report results separately for the
subgroup of infants with birthweight < 2500 g (Anderson 2003;
Chiu 2009; Chwo 2002; Hake Brooks 2008; Huang 2006; Karimi
2014; Lai 2006; Mörelius 2015; Samra 2015; Sloan 2008), seven
because they reported only physiological outcomes (Bergman
2004; Dehghani 2015; Ludington-Hoe 1991; Ludington-Hoe
2000; Ludington-Hoe 2004; Ludington-Hoe 2006; Mitchell
2013), three because the method of generation of allocation to
treatment was quasi-randomized (Kambarami 1998; Miltersteiner
2005; Swarnkar 2016), three because allocation was performed by
a cross-over design (Legault 1993; Lyngstad 2014; Miles 2006),
two because KMC was part of a preventive package of interven-
tions for essential newborn care (Darmstadt 2006; Kumar 2008),
one because it evaluated only KMC for rewarming hypothermic
infants (Christensson 1998), one because it assessed only the ef-
fect of KMC on the mental health of mothers (Badiee 2014), one
because it evaluated only the effect of KMC on colonization sta-
tus of newborns’ nostrils (Lamy Filho 2015), and one because it
was published as an abstract only, and our attempts to locate full
publications or to contact study authors were unsuccessful (Udani
2008).
We have presented the main characteristics of the excluded studies
in the table Characteristics of excluded studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
We have depicted the risk of bias in included studies in Figure 2.
We judged that no study adequately addressed all seven domains.
We judged only two studies to adequately address six domains.
The methodological quality of the included trials was mixed, and
we carried out a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of ex-
cluding trials at high risk of bias. See Sensitivity analysis. The main
threats to validity were performance bias (by lack of blinding of
participants, personnel, and outcomes assessors) and selection bias
(by lack of information on methods used for concealment of treat-
ment allocation).

 Allocation
Most of the included studies used adequate methods to gener-
ate allocation sequence. Ten studies used random number tables
(Acharya 2014; Cattaneo 1998; Charpak 1997; Eka Pratiwi 2009;
Gathwala 2008; Nimbalkar 2014; Ramanathan 2001; Rojas 2003;
Sloan 1994; Worku 2005), and four studies used shuffling of en-
velopes (Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo 2007; Roberts 2000; Whitelaw
1988). Other methods of sequence generation used included web-
based random number generator (Ghavane 2012), computer ran-
dom number generator (Neu 2010), minimization computer-
ized technique (Nagai 2010), block randomization technique (Ali
2009), the sealed envelope method (Kadam 2005), and simple
randomization (Kumbhojkar 2016; Suman 2008).
Ten studies used sealed envelopes for concealment of treat-
ment allocation (Boo 2007; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005;
Kumbhojkar 2016; Neu 2010; Nimbalkar 2014; Roberts 2000;
Rojas 2003; Suman 2008; Whitelaw 1988), although only five
studies (Ghavane 2012; Neu 2010; Nimbalkar 2014; Rojas 2003;
Whitelaw 1988) explicitly stated that the envelopes were opaque,
sealed, and numbered. Investigators concealed allocation by using
a software that provided automatically random allocation (mini-
mization method) in only one study (Nagai 2010). Ten studies did
not report the method of allocation concealment (Acharya 2014;
Ali2009; Blaymore Bier 1996; Cattaneo 1998; Charpak1997; Eka
Pratiwi 2009; Gathwala 2008; Ramanathan 2001; Sloan 1994;
Worku 2005).
Blinding
As KMC cannot be implemented when masked, all included stud-
ies reported lack of blinding of participants and clinical staff. Only
two studies (Ghavane 2012; Nagai 2010) reported that outcome
assessors were masked to the intervention group of infants. Neu
2010 reported that four researchers assessed outcome measures,
two of whom were blinded to the hypotheses of the study but not
to group assignment of mother-infant dyads. The other two re-
searchers were blinded to group assignment and hypotheses. The
remaining trials did not state whether any attempt was made to
”blind“ outcome assessment.
We consider that performance and observer bias cannot be ex-
cluded owing to lack of blinding of participants and clinicians.
However, although this could affect assessment of subjective out-
comes such as parental and familial satisfaction, mother-infant at-
tachment, and social and home environment, or objective out-
comes such as breastfeeding, length of hospital length, and re-ad-
mission to hospital after discharge, it is much less likely to have
affected the primary outcomes (infant mortality, severe infection/
sepsis, severe illness, infant growth, and neurodevelopmental dis-
ability) and some secondary outcomes of this review (nosocomial
infection, mild/moderate infection or illness, hypothermia, and
hyperthermia).
Incomplete outcome data
Eight trials had no losses to follow-up and no exclusions post ran-
domization (Acharya 2014; Kadam 2005; Nagai 2010; Nimbalkar
2014; Ramanathan 2001; Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Whitelaw
1988). In seven studies, 1% to 10% of recruited infants were lost
to follow-up (Ali 2009; Blaymore Bier 1996; Charpak 1997; Eka
Pratiwi 2009; Gathwala 2008; Ghavane 2012; Sloan 1994). Boo
2007 excluded 12.3% of infants in the KMC group because SSC
sessions were carried out on less than 50% of hospital stay days
after recruitment. Two trials (Cattaneo 1998; Worku 2005) did
not report the number of infants lost to follow-up or excluded
after randomization. Kumbhojkar 2016 did not report the num-
ber of infants lost to follow-up or exclusions, but investigators
stated in the Discussion section of the article that ”poor follow-
up“ was provided in the control group. Suman 2008 had high risk
of attrition bias because 22.3% of infants were lost to follow-up.
Moreover, imbalance across intervention groups was evident in
numbers for losses to follow-up (KMC 10.2%; control 33.9%).
In addition, 6.4% of infants were omitted from reports of analyses
because they did not receive assigned care. Neu 2010 had high
risk of attrition bias because 9.2% of infants were lost to follow-
up and 16.1% were excluded post randomization.
Selective reporting
No study protocols were available. We compared outcomes listed
in the Methods section of articles against those reported in the Re-
sults section. Sixteen studies (Acharya 2014; Blaymore Bier 1996;
Boo 2007; Cattaneo 1998; Charpak 1997; Eka Pratiwi 2009;
Gathwala 2008; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar 2016;
Nagai 2010; Neu 2010; Nimbalkar 2014; Roberts 2000; Rojas
2003; Suman 2008) reported all outcomes listed in the Methods
section, and we assume that these reports probably included all
prespecified variables. Two studies (Ali 2009; Worku 2005) had
high risk of bias owing to selective outcome reporting. Worku
2005 did not report the great majority of outcomes listed in the
Methods section, such as mild/moderate and severe illness, sepsis,
diarrhea, pneumonia, aspiration, weight gain, and mother’s feel-
ings. In Ali 2009, non-significant results such as infant mortality
(primary outcome) and weight, length, and head circumference
at discharge and follow-up (secondary outcomes) were mentioned
but were not reported adequately. In the remaining three studies,
some secondary outcomes listed in the Methods section were not
reported (Ramanathan 2001), or they were mentioned but were
not reported adequately (Sloan 1994; Whitelaw 1988).

 Other potential sources of bias
We did not identify other potential sources of bias in 15 studies
(Acharya 2014; Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo 2007; Gathwala 2008;
Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005; Kumbhojkar 2016; Nagai 2010;
Neu 2010; Nimbalkar 2014; Ramanathan 2001; Roberts 2000;
Rojas 2003; Whitelaw 1988; Worku 2005). Three studies (Ali
2009; Charpak 1997; Eka Pratiwi 2009) used blocked random-
ization for sequence generation. When blocked randomization is
used in an unblinded trial, and when assignments are revealed af-
ter individuals are recruited into the trial, it is sometimes possible
to predict future assignments. This is particularly the case when
blocks are of a fixed size. Cattaneo 1998 carried out randomiza-
tion in blocks of six with stratification by weight at one of the
three participating centers. The trial performed by Sloan 1994
was stopped early because investigators found a highly significant
difference in severe morbidity at two months and at six months.
Randomized controlled trials that are stopped early are more likely
to be associated with greater effect sizes than RCTs not stopped
early (Bassler 2010). This difference is independent of the pres-
ence of statistical stopping rules and is greatest in smaller studies.
In the study by Suman 2008, groups were significantly different
at baseline in weight and age at enrollment.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Kangaroo
mother care versus conventional neonatal care for reducing
morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants
Comparison 1. Kangaroo mother care versus
conventional neonatal care
The comparison between KMC and conventional neonatal care
included 20 studies (2969 infants) and 49 outcomes, of which 24
were reported in more than one study.
Mortality (outcomes 1.1 to 1.4)
Kangaroo mother care was associated with a statistically significant
reduction in risk of mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age (3.2% vs 5.3%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92;
I2 = 0%; NNTB = 47, 95% CI 31 to 236; eight trials, 1736 infants)
(Analysis 1.1), and at latest follow-up (4.0% vs 6.0%; RR 0.67,
95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; I2 = 0%; NNTB = 50, 95% CI 32 to 331;
12 trials, 2293 infants; moderate-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.4)
(Figure 3). The significantly decreased risk of death at discharge or
at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age, and at latest follow-up, was
also demonstrated in the subgroup of studies that used continuous
(≥ 20 hours/d) KMC (mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96; I2 = 0%; three
trials, 1117 infants; mortality at latest follow-up: RR 0.67, 95%
CI 0.46 to 0.98; I2 = 0%; four trials, 1384 infants), the subgroup
of studies in which KMC was initiated within 10 days post birth
(mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age:
RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.88; I2 = 0%; five trials, 1412 infants;
mortality at latest follow-up: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.85; I2 =
0%; six trials, 1489 infants), the subgroup of studies conducted in
low/middle-income countries(mortalityatdischarge orat 40 to 41
weeks’ postmenstrual age: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.89; I2 = 0%;
seven studies, 1676 infants; mortality at latest follow-up: RR 0.65,
95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; I2 = 0%; 10 trials, 2162 infants), and the trial
in which KMC was used in unstabilized infants (RR 0.57, 95% CI
0.33 to 1.00). The statistically significant beneficial effect of KMC
on mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age
and on mortality at latest follow-up was not demonstrated in the
subgroup of trials that used intermittent KMC (< 2 hours/d and
between 6 and 15 hours/d), or that initiated KMC after 10 days
post birth, or that were conducted in high-income countries, or
that used KMC in stabilized infants.

 The sensitivity analysis limited to studies with adequate conceal-
ment of allocation revealed a similar reduction in mortality at dis-
charge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age, and at latest fol-
low-up, although this was not statistically significant (mortality at
discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age: RR 0.59, 95%
CI 0.19 to 1.81; I2 = 0%; five trials; mortality at latest follow-up:
RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.77; I2 = 0%; six trials). Similar results
were obtained when we excluded studies with high risk of attrition
bias (mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual
age: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.00; I2 = 0%; six studies; mortality
at latest follow-up: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; I2 = 0%; 10
studies).
We found no overall difference in risk of mortality at six months of
age oratsixmonths’ follow-up(RR0.99, 95%CI0.48to2.02; two
trials, 354 infants) (Analysis 1.2), and at 12 months’ corrected age
(RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.17; one trial, 693 infants) (Analysis
1.3) between KMC infants and controls.
Infection/illness (outcomes 1.5 to 1.14)
In stabilized LBW infants, KMC was associated with a statistically
significant reduction in severe infection/sepsis at latest follow-up
(6.6% vs 13.1%; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.69; I2 = 24%; NNTB
= 15, 95% CI 12 to 25; eight trials, 1463 infants; moderate-
quality evidence) (Analysis 1.5) (Figure 4), severe illness at six
months’ follow-up (5.3% vs 17.8%; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to
0.67; NNTB = 8, 95% CI 7 to 17; one trial, 283 infants) (Analysis
1.6), nosocomial infection/sepsis at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age (4.0%vs11.4%; RR0.35, 95%CI0.22to0.54;
I2 = 0%; NNTB = 14, 95% CI 11 to 19; five trials, 1239 infants)
(Analysis 1.7), lower respiratory tract disease at six months’ follow-
up (4.6% vs 12.5%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; NNTB =
13, 95% CI 9 to 73; one trial, 283 infants) (Analysis 1.9), and
hypothermia at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age
(7.6% vs 27.1%; RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.49; I2 = 52%; NNTB
= 5, 95% CI 4 to 7; nine trials, 989 infants; moderate-quality
evidence) (Analysis 1.11).

Kangaroo mother care to reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants (Review)

 Only the subgroup of trials that used intermittent KMC demon-
strated significantly reduced risk of severe infection/sepsis at lat-
est follow-up and hypothermia at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age. Subgroups of trials that used intermittent or
continuous KMC showed a statistically significantly reduced risk
of nosocomial infection/sepsis at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age.
We found no overall difference between KMC infants and con-
trols in risk of mild/moderate infection or illness at latest follow-
up (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.88) (Analysis 1.8), diarrhea at
six months’ follow-up (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.20) (Analysis
1.10), hyperthermia at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmen-
strual age (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.05) (Analysis 1.12), and re-
admission to hospital at latest follow-up (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34
to 1.06) (Analysis 1.14).
Intermittent KMC decreased length of hospital stay by 1.6 days,
although this difference was not statistically significant (95% CI -
0.2to3.4; Pvalue =0.08; 11 studies,1057infants)(Analysis 1.13).
Mean hospital stay from randomization to 41 weeks’ postmen-
strual age was 4.5 days for KMC infants and 5.6 days for control
infants in Charpak 1997. Investigators provided no standard devi-
ations. Cattaneo 1998 reported only median hospital stay, which
was 11 days in the KMC group versus 13 days in the control group.
Length of hospital stay was two days greater in KMC infants than
in control infants in Sloan 1994.
Sensitivity analyses using only studies with adequate allocation
concealment demonstrated a similar result for severe infection/
sepsis at latest follow-up (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.66) and for
hypothermia at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age
(RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.36). Additional sensitivity analyses
did not indicate that removing the study with high risk of attrition
bias (Suman 2008) had any important impact on overall effects
of KMC on severe infection/sepsis at latest follow-up (RR 0.54,
95% CI 0.38 to 0.76) and on hypothermia at discharge or at 40
to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.48).
Infant growth (outcomes 1.15 to 1.26)
Infants given kangaroo mother care gained more weight per day
(MD 4.1 g, 95% CI 2.3 to 5.9; 11 trials, 1198 infants; moder-
ate-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.18) (Figure 5) and had greater
increases in length (MD 0.21 cm, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; three
trials, 377 infants) (Analysis 1.22) and head circumference (MD
0.14 cm, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.22; four trials, 495 infants) (Analysis
1.26) per week than controls. Nevertheless, considerable hetero-
geneity was evident (I2 > 70%) among trials reporting gain in
weight, length, and head circumference. One trial (Charpak 1997)
reported that KMC infants had a larger head circumference at 6
months’ corrected age than controls (MD 0.34 cm, 95% CI 0.11
to 0.57; 592 infants) (Analysis 1.24). Investigators observed no
differences in weight, length, or head circumference at discharge
or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age (Analysis 1.15; Analysis
1.19; Analysis 1.23) or at 12 months’ corrected age (Analysis 1.17;
Analysis 1.21; Analysis 1.25), or in weight or length at 6 months’
corrected age (Analysis 1.16; Analysis 1.20). Sloan 1994 reported,
”there were nosignificantdifferencesbetweenthe groupsingrowth
indices during the six-month follow up.“

 We undertook sensitivity analysis by excluding studies with un-
clear allocation concealment and high risk of attrition bias to ex-
amine the impact on increases in both weight and head circumfer-
ence. We found no differences in the overall direction of findings.
Neurodevelopmental and neurosensory impairment
(outcomes 1.27 to 1.30)
Onlyone study(Charpak 1997)reportedresultsforneurodevelop-
mental and neurosensory impairment at one year of corrected age.
Researchers found no statistically significant differences between
KMC infants and controls in Griffith quotients for psychomotor
development (low-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.27), cerebral palsy
(Analysis 1.28), deafness (Analysis 1.29), and visual impairment
(Analysis 1.30). A secondary publication of the Charpak 1997 trial
reported that the subgroup of KMC infants with birthweight ≤
1800 g had a higher general developmental quotient than controls
at one year of corrected age (P value < 0.01).
Breastfeeding (outcomes 1.31 to 1.40)
Mothers of KMC infants were more likely to be breastfeeding
at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at one
to three months’ follow-up than mothers in the control group.
Compared with conventional care, KMC was associated with an
increase in the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge
or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age (66.3% vs 56.3%; RR
1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; I2 = 39%; NNTB = 11, 95% CI 7 to
25; six studies, 1453 mothers) (Analysis 1.31), and at one to three
months’ follow-up (86.9% vs 76.5%; RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to
1.43; I2 = 76%; NNTB = 7, 95% CI 3 to 131; five studies, 600
mothers) (Analysis 1.32), or any (exclusive or partial) breastfeed-
ing at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age (88.9%
vs 76.2%; RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.34; I2 = 80%; NNTB =
7, 95% CI 4 to 19; 10 studies, 1696 mothers; moderate-qual-
ity evidence) (Analysis 1.34) (Figure 6), at one to two months’
follow-up (77.9% vs 67.9%; RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.78; I
2 = 78%; six studies, 538 mothers) (Analysis 1.35), at 3 months’
follow-up (79.7% vs 69.8%; RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.23; I
2 = 41%; five studies, 924 mothers) (Analysis 1.36), and at one
to three months’ follow-up (80.4% vs 71.1%; RR 1.17, 95% CI
1.05 to 1.31; I2 = 62%; NNTB = 8, 95% CI 5 to 28; nine studies,
1394 mothers; low-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.37). It should be
noted that heterogeneity was substantial (I2 > 50%) among trials
reporting breastfeeding. Overall, investigators found no statisti-
cally significant differences between KMC and control for exclu-
sive or any breastfeeding at six to 12 months’ follow-up (Analysis
1.33; Analysis 1.38; Analysis 1.39) and at onset of breastfeeding
(Analysis 1.40). However, subgroup analyses showed that inter-
mittent KMC was associated with a significant increase in exclu-
sive breastfeeding at six to 12 months’ follow-up (84.6% vs 55.6%;
RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.10; one study, 75 women) and in
any breastfeeding at six months’ follow-up (54.7% vs 36.8%; RR
1.50, 95% CI 1.08-2.08; three studies, 143 women).

Forest plot of comparison: 1 Kangaroo mother care versus conventional neonatal care, outcome:
1.34 Any breastfeeding at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age - stabilized infants.
Statistically significant positive effects of KMC on breastfeeding
at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at one
to three and six months’ follow-up were demonstrated in the sub-
group of trials that used intermittent KMC but not in the sub-
group of trials that used continuous KMC. In addition, an in-
crease in the likelihood of any breastfeeding at one to two months’
follow-up was demonstrated in the subgroup of three trials (131
infants) conducted in high-income countries (RR 2.02, 95% CI
1.28 to 3.21; I2 = 23%).
Parental and familial satisfaction (outcome 1.41)
Only one study (Cattaneo 1998) evaluated parental and famil-
ial satisfaction with method of infant care. Mothers in the KMC
group were more satisfied with the method of care than were moth-
ers in the control group (91% vs 78%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05
to1.30; 269 mothers) (Analysis 1.41). Investigators found no sig-
nificant differences in satisfaction with method of care between
fathers and families of KMC and control groups.
Mother-infant attachment or interaction (outcomes 1.42 to
1.49)
Three studies (Charpak 1997; Gathwala 2008; Roberts 2000) re-
ported results on mother-infant attachment, and one (Neu 2010)
on mother-infant interaction.
A secondary publication of the Charpak 1997 trial reported two
series of outcomes that were assessed as manifestations of mother-
infant attachment. The first was the mother’s feelings and per-
ceptions of her premature birth experience, measured through a
”mother’s perception of premature birth questionnaire“ using a
Likert scale (1 to 5), 24 hours after birth and when the infant
reached 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age. The second outcome was
derived from observations of the mother’s and child’s responsive-
ness to each other during breastfeeding, using a ”nursing child
assessment feeding scale.“ Researchers compared a total of nine
items between KMC and control groups according to the interval
between birth and start of the intervention (one to two days, three
to 14 days, and longer than 14 days), as well as admission of the
infant to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (yes or not),
for a total of 45 comparisons. Overall, scores on six comparisons
(mother’s sense of competence [interval between birth and start
of intervention of one to two days], mother’s sense of competence
[infant admitted to NICU], mother’s sense of competence [infant
not admitted to NICU], mother’s feelings of worry and stress [in-
terval between birth and start of intervention of one to two days],
mother’s sensitivity [interval between birth and start of interven-
tion > 14 days], and infant responsiveness [interval between birth
and start of intervention > 14 days]) were significantly higher in
the KMC group than in the control group. Scores on two com-
23

 parisons (mother’s perceptions of social support [interval between
birth and start of intervention > 14 days, and infant not admitted
to NICU]) were significantly lower in the KMC group than in the
control group. Results showed no significant differences in scores
for the remaining 37 comparisons (Analysis 1.42; Analysis 1.43;
Analysis 1.44).
Gathwala 2008 evaluated mother-infant attachment at three
months’ follow-up through a structured maternal interview that
used attachment questions scored in such a manner that a higher
score indicated greater attachment. The total attachment score for
the KMC group (24.46 ± 1.64) was significantly higher than that
obtained for the control group (18.22 ± 1.79) (Analysis 1.45).
Roberts 2000 measured maternal stress levels in the NICU and
mothers’ perceptions of their maternal competence. Only the score
on the scale for ”relationship with the infant“ was significantly
higher in the KMC group (4.4 ± 0.46) than in the control group
(3.4 ± 1.16). Researchers found no significant differences between
KMC and control group scores on nursery environment, infant
appearance, staff behavior and communication, and parental con-
fidence in their parenting abilities (Analysis 1.46; Analysis 1.47).
Neu 2010 evaluated the mother-infant interaction at six months
of age by using the Stiil-Face Paradigm tool. Mother-infant dyads
in the KMC group showed more symmetrical, and less asymmet-
rical, co-regulation than mother-infant dyads in the control group
(Analysis 1.48). Multivariate analysis showed no differences be-
tween groups in infant vitality during the neutral face portion of
the Stiil-Face procedure. A secondary publication of the Neu 2010
study reported that KMC infants had similar scores for behavioral
regulation and development to those of infants who experienced
nurse-supported blanket holding at 40 to 44 weeks’ postmenstrual
age (Analysis 1.49).
Home environment and father involvement (outcome 1.50)
One trial (Charpak 1997) evaluated home environment and fa-
ther involvement at 12 months’ corrected age through a struc-
tured interview administered to parents during a home visit. The
total Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment
(HOME) score was significantly higher among kangaroo families
(0.28 ± 0.24) than in conventional care families (-0.51 ± 0.26)
(Analysis 1.50). Scores on father involvement were not reported,
but study authors claimed that KMC increased father involvement
(the father’s sense of responsibility and competence).
Costs of care
No study reported data on mean (SD) total medical and non-
medical costs for KMC and control groups. The overall cost was
”about 50% less for KMC“ in the Cattaneo 1998 study. Specif-
ically, the cost was US $19,289 for KMC and US $39,764 for
conventional care. In the Sloan 1994 study, ”costs of neonatal care
were greater in the control than in the KMC group.“ Overall, the
cost of hospital stay and postneonatal care at five months was US
$741 greater for the control than the KMC group. However, data
were available for only 49 infants (24 KMC, 25 control) at six
months’ follow-up.
All funnel plots showed no asymmetry, either visually or in terms
of statistical significance (P value > 0.10 for all, by Egger’s test).
Comparison 2. Early-onset kangaroo mother care
versus late-onset kangaroo mother care in relatively
stable infants
Only one trial (Nagai 2010), which was considered at low risk
of bias, compared early-onset KMC versus late-onset KMC in
relatively stable LBW infants. Early continuous KMC was begun
as soon as possible, within 24 hours post birth, and late continuous
KMC was begun after complete stabilization, generally after 24
hours post birth. This study included a total of 73 LBW infants
(early 37, late 36). Investigators reported no statistically significant
differences between early-onset KMC and late-onset KMC for
mortality at four weeks of age (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.18 to 20.53)
(Analysis 2.1) and at six months of age (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to
6.72) (Analysis 2.10), morbidity (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.28)
(Analysis 2.2) and severe infection (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to
1.49) (Analysis 2.3) at four weeks of age, re-admission to hospital
at four weeks of age (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.18 to 20.53) (Analysis
2.4) and at six to 12 months of age (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to
3.16) (Analysis 2.11), hypothermia (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.15 to
2.27) (Analysis 2.5), hyperthermia (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.56 to
1.99) (Analysis 2.6), weight gain at four weeks of age (MD 58.9
g, 95% CI -116.9 to 234.6) (Analysis 2.7), exclusive breastfeeding
at four weeks of age (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04) (Analysis
2.8), and stunting (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.48) (Analysis
2.12), severe stunting (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.73) (Analysis
2.13), wasting (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.77) (Analysis 2.14),
severe wasting (RR 0.00, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.00) (Analysis 2.15),
underweight (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.14) (Analysis 2.16),
and severe underweight (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.88) (Analysis
2.17) at six to 12 months of age. However, compared with late-
onset KMC, early-onset KMC was associated with a statistically
significant reduction in body weight loss from birth to 48 hours
post birth (MD 43.3 g, 95% CI 5.5 to 81.1) (Analysis 2.7) and in
length of hospital stay (MD 0.9 days, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2) (Analysis
2.9). In addition, early-onset KMC was associated with a non-
significant increase in the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding at
six months of age (41.4% vs 15.4%; RR 2.69, 95% CI 0.99 to
7.31) (Analysis 2.8).

Summary of main results

Kangaroo mother care to reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 This updated systematic review of 20 randomized controlled tri-
als (RCTs) comparing kangaroo mother care (KMC) and conven-
tional neonatal care found compelling evidence that KMC is as-
sociated with a reduction in mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41
weeks’ postmenstrual age and at latest follow-up, severe infection/
sepsis, and hypothermia, and an increase in weight gain and in
exclusive or any breastfeeding at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’
postmenstrual age and at one to three months’ follow-up. More-
over, growing evidence indicates that KMC reduces the risk of
nosocomial infection/sepsis at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ post-
menstrual age, and increases the gain in length and head circum-
ference, maternal satisfaction with the method, maternal-infant
attachment, and home environment. One trial (Charpak 1997)
reported no significant differences between KMC infants and con-
trols in a variety of neurodevelopmental and neurosensory out-
comes at one year of corrected age.
Overall, continuous KMC led to a reduction in mortality at dis-
charge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at latest follow-
up, and in nosocomial infection/sepsis, severe illness, and lower
respiratory tract disease, and an increase in weight gain, maternal
satisfaction with the method, and some measures of mother-infant
attachment and home environment. On the other hand, intermit-
tent KMC was associated with a decrease in the risk of severe infec-
tion/sepsis, nosocomial infection/sepsis, and hypothermia, and an
increase in weight, length, and head circumference gain, exclusive
or any breastfeeding at discharge or 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual
age and at one to three months’ follow-up, and mother-infant at-
tachment at three months’ follow-up.
Subgroup analyses showed that decreased risk of death at discharge
or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at latest follow-up was
demonstrated in the subgroup of trials that used continuous KMC
(≥ 20 hours/d), the subgroup of trials in which KMC was initiated
within 10 days post birth, the subgroup of trials conducted in low/
middle-income countries, and the trial in which KMC was used in
unstabilized infants. Sensitivity analysis suggested that inclusion of
studies with high risk of bias did not affect the general direction of
findings nor the size of the treatment effect, although the beneficial
effect of KMC on mortality turned non-significant or marginally
significant.
One small high-quality trial (Nagai 2010) suggested that early-on-
set KMC, compared with late-onset KMC, is associated with a sig-
nificant reduction in body weight loss from birth to 48 hours post
birth and in length of hospital stay, and a marginally significant in-
crease in the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of
age, with no significant difference in mortality, morbidity, severe
infection, re-admission to hospital, hypothermia, hyperthermia,
exclusive breastfeeding at four weeks of age, or infant nutritional
indicators at six to 12 months of age.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Participants in the included trials reflect the population for which
this intervention is currently considered, that is, low birthweight
(LBW)/preterm infants. Sixteen trials, including all five trials that
evaluated continuous KMC, were conducted in hospitals in low/
middle-income countries. Mortality at discharge was the only out-
come reported in the sole trial (Worku 2005) that compared KMC
with conventional neonatal care in LBW infants before stabiliza-
tion. The remaining 48 outcomes were reported in 19 trials that
evaluated KMC in stabilized LBW infants. We were unable to
draw conclusions about the effectiveness of KMC in unstabilized
LBW infants. Given these factors, the great majority of results of
our meta-analysis can be applied only to stabilized LBW infants
in low/middle-income countries. However, the beneficial effect of
KMC on any breastfeeding at one to two months’ follow-up was
also found among stabilized LBW infants in high-income coun-
tries.
As only a small trial compared early-onset KMC with late-onset
KMC, review authors could draw no firm conclusions regarding
apparent differences between these two types of management.
One randomized controlled cluster trial (Sloan 2008) assessed the
effect of community-based KMC on overall neonatal mortality, in-
fant mortality, and LBW neonatal mortality; investigators assigned
4165 infants in rural Bangladesh to community-based KMC or
control without KMC. Unfortunately, we did not include this
study in the review because 40% overall and 65% of newborns
who died were not weighed at birth, and missing birthweight was
differential for study group. Results show no difference in over-
all neonatal mortality rate or infant mortality rate. However, for
infants whose modeled birthweight was ≤ 2000 g, the neonatal
mortality rate was 9.5% in the community-based KMC group
and 22.5% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.37, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.86).
Quality of the evidence
Overall, we assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate for
most critical and important outcomes (Summary of findings for
the main comparison). We evaluated the risk of bias in included
studies by addressing seven specific domains (random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and
personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome
data, selective reporting, and other bias) discussed in section Risk
of bias in included studies. Review authors judged that 12 stud-
ies adequately addressed at least four domains (Acharya 2014;
Blaymore Bier 1996; Boo 2007; Ghavane 2012; Kadam 2005;
Kumbhojkar 2016; Nagai 2010; Neu 2010; Nimbalkar 2014;
Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Whitelaw 1988). Five studies ade-
quately addressed three domains (Charpak 1997; Eka Pratiwi
2009; Gathwala 2008; Ramanathan 2001; Suman 2008), and four
adequately addressed two or fewer domains (Ali 2009; Cattaneo
1998; Sloan 1994; Worku 2005).

 Overall, the quality of the studies was mixed, although sensitivity
analysis suggests that inclusion of studies with high risk of bias did
not affect the general direction of findings nor the size of the treat-
ment effect. Nevertheless, lack of blinding of outcome assessors in
most studies and the unclear method of allocation concealment
might present problems in terms of the overall quality of evidence.
Investigators must make every effort to improve research quality.
For some of the results described in the review (hypothermia,
weight gain, breastfeeding, and length of hospital stay), evidence
shows high levels of statistical heterogeneity. Some of this het-
erogeneity may have occurred as a result of clinical heterogeneity,
for example, different definitions of hypothermia were used, or
women may not have been asked about breastfeeding in the same
way in different trials. Results of meta-analysis with substantial
heterogeneity should be interpreted cautiously.
Potential biases in the review process
We attempted to reduce bias in the review process wherever possi-
ble. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and
findings of included studies. We tried to contact authors of studies
with missing data but obtained limited response. Despite differ-
ences in the timing of outcome measurements among studies, we
proceeded with meta-analyses for several outcomes, as interven-
tion effects were consistent among studies, although to varying de-
grees. Only one study reported about 50% of outcomes evaluated
in the review, precluding convincing conclusions on the effect of
KMC on such outcomes.
The beneficial effects of KMC on mortality at discharge or at 40 to
41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and at latest follow-up, severe infec-
tion/sepsis, and nosocomial infection found in our meta-analyses
are enhanced by the impressive statistical homogeneity observed
among trials (I2 = 0% to 7%).
To date, only one study (Charpak 1997) reported neurodevelop-
mental results at one year of corrected age. Longer-term assess-
ments of neurodevelopmental outcomes have not been published
yet, and some caution should perhaps be exercised in applying
these findings at 12 months’ corrected age, because it has been
suggested that assessments done at a relatively young age may be
insufficiently predictive of longer-term neurodevelopmental out-
comes, particularly with regard to cognitive functioning (Roberts
2010).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Previous versions of this review
Our assessment of the evidence was similar to that provided in
the previous version of this review (Conde-Agudelo 2014), which
concluded that ”the evidence from this updated review supports
the use of KMC in LBW infants as an alternative to conventional
neonatal care mainly in resource-limited settings.“ In the current
versionof thisreview, we includedthree additional trialsandresults
of infant neurobehavior at 40 to 44 weeks’ postmenstrual age
of a previously included study. Notwithstanding, the conclusions
of this updated review have not changed in relation to those of
the previous version of the review. It should be noted that the
first two versions of this review (Conde-Agudelo 2000; Conde-
Agudelo 2003), including only three trials (n = 1362 infants), had
concluded that ”although KMC appears to reduce severe infant
morbidity without any serious deleterious effect reported, there is
still insufficient evidence to recommend its routine use in LBW
infants.“ In these earlier versions, biases related to blinding of
participants, personnel and outcome assessors were assessed within
a single domain. In the current version , we assessed blinding of
participants and personnel in a domain that was separate from
bias related to blinding of outcome assessment, as recommended
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011).
The findings of the current updated version of this review allow
us to reassert that evidence is sufficient for review authors to rec-
ommend the use of KMC in stabilized LBW infants.
Other systematic reviews on KMC
Lawn 2010 performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to es-
timate the effect of KMC on neonatal mortality due to direct com-
plications of preterm birth. This review included observational
studies and excluded RCTs that initiated KMC after the first week
of life. In the meta-analysis of RCTs, which included three studies
(Charpak 1997; Suman 2008; Worku 2005) that provided data on
neonatal specific mortality, KMC was associated with a reduction
in neonatal death among infants < 2000 g (risk ratio [RR] 0.49,
95% CI 0.29 to 0.82; I2 = 0%; 988 infants). In the meta-analysis
of three observational studies, KMC was associated with decreased
risk of neonatal death in infants < 2000 g (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58
to 0.79; I2 = 54%; 8151 infants). Another meta-analysis, which
included five RCTs, showed that KMC reduced significantly the
risk of severe morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.65; I2 = 70%;
1520 infants).
Boundy 2016 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
of RCTs and observational studies to assess the effect of KMC
on neonatal outcomes among infants of any birthweight or gesta-
tional age. Studies with fewer than 10 participants, lack of a com-
parison group without KMC, and not reporting a quantitative
association were excluded. Among LBW infants < 2000 g, KMC
was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of mortality
at latest follow-up (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.89; I2 = 72%; 15
studies [9 RCTs and 6 observational studies]).
The results of our review suggest that KMC reduces the risk of
mortality at discharge or at 40 to 41 weeks’ postmenstrual age and

 at latest follow-up. Our estimated effects were similar to those of
Boundy 2016 and were smaller than those of Lawn 2010. Dif-
ferences between the findings of this updated review and those of
Lawn 2010 and Boundy 2016 are explained by inclusion of only
RCTs and of a greater number of studies in our review.

Implications for practice
Results of this updated review indicate that, currently, evidence is
sufficient to support the use of kangaroo mother care (KMC) in
stabilized low birthweight (LBW) infants as an alternative to con-
ventional neonatal care in resource-limited settings. Although cur-
rent evidence is mainly limited to the use of KMC in low/middle-
income countries, emerging evidence suggests that use of KMC
could improve breastfeeding rates in high-income countries. Sub-
group analyses suggest that both continuous KMC and intermit-
tent KMC are beneficial for stabilized LBW infants. Given that
the control group in studies evaluating continuous KMC was kept
in incubators or radiant warmers, the potential beneficial effects
of KMC on morbidity and mortality of LBW infants would be
expected to be greatest in settings in which conventional neonatal
care is unavailable.
To date, early-onset continuous KMC in unstabilized or relatively
stabilized LBW infants cannot be recommended on the basis of
evidence provided by two small trials.
Implications for research
Several areas require further study in light of the results of this
review.
• Methodologically rigorous trials are needed to further
explore the effectiveness of early-onset continuous KMC in
unstabilized or relatively stabilized LBW infants in low-income
settings. Studies should provide detailed information on
inclusion and exclusion criteria, methods used to generate and
conceal the allocation sequence, measures used to blind outcome
assessors to allocation of participants, completeness of outcome
data for each main outcome (attritions and exclusions), definition
of infant stabilization, infant age at initiation of KMC, and
frequency, daily duration, and total duration of the intervention,
and investigators should report adequately all prespecified
outcomes in the study protocol. We are aware that a planned
RCT (OMWaNA study) will assess the effect of early KMC
among unstable infants weighing ≤ 2000g in eastern Uganda.
• Only five RCTs, including a total of 256 infants, which
were conducted in developed countries and reported clinical
outcome measures, met minimal inclusion criteria (Blaymore
Bier 1996; Neu 2010; Roberts 2000; Rojas 2003; Whitelaw
1988). Therefore, randomized trials with an adequate sample
size are clearly needed to evaluate the use of continuous or
intermittent KMC in high-income settings and to report results
mainly on infant morbidity.
• Although some data on long-term neurodevelopmental and
neurosensory outcomes are available, continuing follow-up and
additional data for randomized children are justified, as more
subtle differences may become apparent in later childhood
(Roberts 2010).
• Additional studies are needed to investigate effects of early-
onset KMC on breastfeeding.
• Well-designed economic evaluations are needed to assess
the cost-effectiveness of KMC in low-, middle-, and high-
income settings.
• Exploration of mother-infant attachment should be
pursued in future trials, as this element has been inconsistently
evaluated across studies.
• Additional trials in different settings ensuring baseline
comparability of mortality, adequate KMC implementation, and
birthweight assessment are required to clarify the effect of
community-based KMC on LBW neonatal mortality before
community-based KMC programs are implemented and before
community-based KMC is included in essential newborn care.

Methods
Randomized controlled trial carried out in London, United Kingdom
Participants
Number of infants: 71
Inclusion criteria: infants from singleton or twin pregnancy with weight < 1500 g, stable
breathing with no oxygen requirement, and ≥ 1 parent speaking fluent English. Stable
infants were not excluded if they had congenital malformations such as hydronephrosis
or scoliosis, nor if they had intracranial lesions such as periventricular leukomalacia or
ventricular dilatation
Exclusion criteria: unreported
Infant stabilization status at trial entry: stabilized
Infant age and weight at trial entry: Mean (range) age at enrollment was 16 (1 to 66)

infants, respectively. No data on infant weight at recruitment
Interventions
KMC group: Infants were kept in an upright position, in SSC between the mother’s
breasts, with a cardiac or respiration monitor attached. Mean (range) duration of KMC
was 0.6 (0 to 1.5) hours per day (n = 35)
Control group: Mother was encouraged to visit as much as she liked and helped to take
her baby out of the incubator for a cuddle. However, baby and mother remained clothed
Care was taken that the normal contact group would receive no less attention from the
nursing staff (n = 36)

Methods
Randomized controlled trial carried out in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
Participants
Number of infants: 123
Inclusion criteria: infants with birthweight < 2000 g, singletons unless 1 of the twins
died, no major congenital malformations, and mother healthy and willing to participate
Exclusion criteria: unreported
Infant stabilization status at trial entry: non-stabilized
Infant age and weight at trial entry: Mean age at enrollment was 10.0 and 9.8 hours,
and mean birthweight was 1515 g and 1472 g for KMC and control infants, respectively
Interventions
Early KMC group: Infants were kept in continuous SSC with their mother beginning
immediately after birth or within the first 24 hours of life (before stabilization). The
mother kept her newborn infant between the breasts, in close contact with her body and
covered with her clothes day and night. Breastfeeding was the standard feeding method.
However, the mother could also feed her baby with formula milk using tube or cup
when needed. KMC could be combined with a heated room during low environmental
temperatures (n = 62)
Control group: Infants were kept in a heated room with overhead lamp warmers and
received oxygen therapy and breast, tube, cup, or mixed feeding (n = 61)
The 2 methods of care were applied and continued until the baby was considered sta-
bilized (stable temperature, stabilized cardiovascular status, satisfactory ability to suck,
and good general condition); then both group of babies were transferred to the ward
for routine kangaroo care service. KMC was continued at home after discharge in both
groups

Methods
Randomized controlled trial carried out in North Carolina and Illinois, United States
Participants
Number of infants: 162
Inclusion criteria: non-critically ill preterm infants with birthweight < 1750 g
Exclusion criteria: infants with congenital neurological problems (eg, congenital hydrocephalus, Down syndrome)
, mothers who had symptoms of substance exposure or who did not have custody of the infant or who had a risk
factor that could affect their ability to administer the intervention (eg, age < 15 years; history of psychosis or bipolar
disease; current diagnosis of major depression; non-English speaking); follow-up for 12 months unlikely
Infant stabilization status at trial entry: stabilized
Interventions
KMC group: Infants were kept in SSC in an upright position between the mother’s breasts, dressed with a diaper
and a hat. Mothers were instructed to perform the intervention at least once a day, 3 times a week, and for ≥ 15
minutes during infant hospitalization, and to continue at home until the infant was 2 months’ corrected age (n = 81)
Control group: Mothers spent a similar amount of time each week as KMC mothers with the study nurse, discussing
how to select and locate safe equipment needed to care for preterm infants at home, for example, clothes, diapers,
formula, and toys. Holding was not part of the control group intervention (n = 81)
Level of care: initially at the NICU, then at home
Human resources: nurses
Outcomes
Mother-infant relationship, maternal psychological distress, social and home environment, mother’s satisfaction
Notes
This study examined effects of KMC vs massage with auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular (ATVV) stimulation vs
an attention control group. If included in the review, we would exclude results of the ATVV intervention group

Appendix 1. Search strategy for the 2014 update
Electronic searches
The standard search strategy for the Cochrane Neonatal review Group was used.This included searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE,
LILACS, POPLINE, and CINAHL databases (all from inception to March 31, 2014), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2014) using a combination of keywords and text words related to KMC or SSC and LBW or
preterm infants. To ensure maximum sensitivity we placed no limits or filters on the searches.
INDEX TERMS
Text words
Kangaroo mother care; kangaroo mother method; kangaroo care; skin-to-skin contact, skin-to-skin care

Searching other resources
Web page of the Kangaroo Foundation, International Network of Kangaroo Care, conference and symposia proceedings on KMC,
reference lists of identified studies, textbooks, review articles, and Google scholar were also searched. In addition,we performed journal
hand searching and contacted investigators involved in the field to locate unpublished studies. No language restrictions were applied.
For studies with multiple publications, the data from the most complete report were used and supplemented if additional information
appeared in other publications.

The original review was carried out by Agustin Conde-Agudelo, Jose L. Diaz-Rossello, and Jose M. Belizán (Conde-Agudelo 2000). The
same review authors updated the review in 2003 (Conde-Agudelo 2003) and 2011 (Conde-Agudelo 2011). Agustin Conde-Agudelo
and Jose L. Diaz-Rossello updated the review in 2014 (Conde-Agudelo 2014). For this update, Dr Agustin Conde-Agudelo conducted
all statistical analyses, wrote the first draft of the review, and revised subsequent drafts in response to feedback. Dr Jose L. Diaz-Rossello
commented on the first draft of the updated review and contributed to the writing of the final draft.

We have updated the Background and Methods sections. After the protocol was published, a new version of the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommended a new approach to assess risk of bias. We changed our method of assessment to be
consistent with these recommendations. We decided to group studies into continuous KMC and intermittent KMC after looking at
variation in the interventions. We changed the labels for most primary and secondary outcomes and performed several new subgroup and
sensitivity analyses. In the latest version of this review, we have included studies that evaluated KMC before stabilization, intermittent
KMC, and early-onset KMC.
In this updated review, we have added the method and plan for ’Summary of findings’ tables and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation,
Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) recommendations; these were not included in the original protocol.
