Objective: Psychosis or mania after childbirth is a psychiatric
emergency with risk for suicide and infanticide.
Method: The authors reviewed the epidemiologic and ge-
netic research and physiological postpartum triggers (en-
docrine, immunological, circadian) of psychosis. They also
summarized all systematic reviews and synthesized the sparse
clinical studies to provide diagnostic recommendations, treat-
ment options, and strategies for prevention.
Results: The incidence of first-lifetime onset postpartum
psychosis/mania from population-based register studies of
psychiatric admissions varies from 0.25 to 0.6 per 1,000
births. After an incipient episode, 20%250% of women have
isolated postpartum psychosis. The remaining women have
episodes outside the perinatal period, usually within the bi-
polar spectrum. Presumably, the mechanism of onset is re-
lated to physiological changes after birth (e.g., hormonal,
immunological, circadian), which precipitate disease in ge-
netically vulnerable women. Some women have treatable
causes and comorbidities, such as autoimmune thyroiditis
or infections. N-methyl-D-aspartate-encephalitis or inborn
errors of metabolism may present after birth with psychosis.
Fewer than 30 publications have focused on the treatment of
postpartum psychosis. The largest study (N=64) provided
evidence that lithium is highly efficacious for both acute and
maintenance treatment. Another report (N=34) described
successful ECTtreatment. Inpatientcareis usuallyrequiredto
ensure safety, complete the diagnostic evaluation, and ini-
tiatetreatment.Therelapseriskafterasubsequentpregnancy
for women with isolated postpartum psychoses is 31% (95%
CI=22–42). Strategies for prevention of postpartum psy-
chosis include lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum
and proactive safety monitoring.
Conclusions: Postpartum psychosis offersan intriguing model
to explore etiologic contributions to the neurobiology of
affective psychosis.

Physicians have described women with acute psychiatric
symptoms after childbirth for millennia. In the 19th century,
the first case series appeared, of which Esquirol’s was the
most detailed (1). He described 92 women with postpartum
psychosis, of which 53% had predominantly manic symp-
toms, 38% had depressive symptoms, and 9% had non-
affective psychosis. French psychiatrist Louis-Victor Marcé
(for whom the international Marcé Society for Perinatal
Mental Health is named) published a monograph in 1858 that
included detailed clinical descriptions of 79 women with
postpartum disorders (2). Although these cases might
include women with infection and delirium, the striking
affective and psychotic presentation of women with post-
partum psychosis has been consistent over the last centu-
ries. We present two cases—one in the woman’s own words
and another as reconstructed from interview by the pa-
tient’s treating physician—to demonstrate presentations of
postpartum psychosis.
Marcédescribedthat“somewomeninwhomdepressionis
not strong enough to rob the mind of all lucidity, show a cold
bloodedness in the execution of their plans and a cleverness
that can’t always be outsmarted” (2).
The relationship between birth and psychosis has in-
trigued investigators who have hypothesized a distinct
pathophysiology; however, the fundamental molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying postpartum psychosis re-
main elusive. This disorder is officially registered as a rare
psychiatric disease in Orphanet (3), but postpartum psychosis
does not have an official DSM code. Much of this literature
has been generated in Europe, and severe mood disorders
(such as mania without psychosis) have been included in
the umbrella term “postpartum psychosis” based on the
relationship of the episode with childbirth. In the present
review, we provide a summary of the epidemiology, phe-
nomenology, pathophysiology, course, and prognosis of
postpartum psychosis, as well as diagnostic recommen-
dations, treatment options, and strategies for prevention.

 varies from 0.25 (4, 7) to 0.6 (1) per 1,000 births. These studies
presented inpatient admission rates and did not include women
treated in an outpatient setting or those who remained un-
treated. Although the absolute prevalence is low, the relative
risk for the first onset of affective psychosis is 23 times higher
within 4 weeks after delivery compared with any other period
during a woman’s life (4). Moreover, the incidence of new-
onset affective psychosis is very low during pregnancy and
significantlylessfrequent than outside thepostpartum period.
In addition to first-onset affective psychosis, the postpartum
period is also a high-risk period for relapse among women with
knownpsychiatricillness.Womenwithbipolardisorderaremore
likely to experience a puerperal psychiatric admission compared
withwomenwithotherpsychiatricdiagnoses(5,7–9).Moreover,
women with bipolar disorder are also at risk for episodes during
pregnancy, especially when they taper off medication.
Multiple studies examining naturalistic cohorts of women
with postpartumpsychosis have documented thetypical time
of symptom onset as between 3 and 10 days after birth (5, 10,
11). The onset of relapse in postpartum women with bipolar
disorder has been observed to be earlier, sometimes during
or immediately after delivery (12, 13). Psychiatric admission
typically occurs days or weeks after the onset of symptoms.
Early or prodromal symptoms of postpartum psychosis
include insomnia, mood fluctuation, and irritability, with
emergence of mania, depression, or a mixed state. Although
rapid mood fluctuations are a hallmark of the disease, women
suffering from postpartum psychosis often have symptoms
that are atypical in patients with bipolar disorder. For
example, mood-incongruent delusions are common and
often related to the theme of childbirth. Disorganized, un-
usual behavior and obsessive thoughts regarding the new-
born frequently occur. Postpartum psychosis is notable for its
delirium-like appearance, with cognitive symptoms such as
disorientation, confusion, derealization, and depersonaliza-
tion. Women have a relatively low incidence of symptoms such
as thought insertion, withdrawal or broadcasting, passivity
experiences, hallucinatory voices giving running commen-
tary, or social withdrawal (11, 14–18). Delusions of altruistic
homicide (often with associated maternal suicide) to “save
thembothfromafateworsethandeath”mayoccurandarean
important exploration within the clinical examination (19).
Postpartum psychosis is associated with an increased risk of
both suicide and infanticide (5).
A Dutch naturalistic cohort study reported an episode
duration of 1 month for women with manic features compared
with2.5 months for patients withmixedordepressedfeatures.
These times are similar to the median duration of episodes in
patients with bipolar disorder (11, 20). Patients with a shorter
duration of the acute episode of postpartum psychosis have a
more favorable prognosis compared with patients with longer
episodes (21, 22). The prognosis for patients with first-onset
postpartum psychosis is more favorable than that for the first
onset of affective psychosis outside the postpartum period
(21–24).
Following a first episode of postpartum psychosis, some
women will experience nonpuerperal mood episodes, for
which the postpartum psychosis is the first presentation of a

“The day after the delivery, I feel very tired, but I look
forward to the postpartum period. At day five, I sit behind
my computer; in the adjacent room my husband bottle
feeds our son. Our oldest son is watching TV. Without any
warning sign, suddenly my thoughts are unstoppable and
fly around. My brain is in a centrifuge and is connected to
the nearest electric outlet. My right hand makes circling
movements, which I cannot control. What happened? Did
I have a stroke? I get up and test myself—clearly I can move
and talk, but the environment feels strange. Something I
have never felt before, an almighty feeling. I feel connected
with all people in the world via invisible wires. Something
terrible is going on, but I cannot figure out what this is.
I am pacing up and down not knowing what to do.
Everything feels strange, and yet apparently nothing
changed. I tell my husband, “I will find you another wife.”
He is shocked. I see the panic in his eyes. I say to him,
“I became God.”
A Patient With First-Onset Postpartum Psychosis With Depressed Features
The patient was a well-dressed and impeccably groomed
professional woman who came to the clinic stating that she
was “depressed but no one believes me.” In response to
a question about unusual experiences, she responded in a
matter-of-fact manner:
“Inside me is a dark force. If you saw me when it comes
out,youwouldseeadarkshadowthatlookslikemeoutsideof
me. It is black, but you can see through it and put your hand
through it. The shadow takes over me and makes me do
things. Yesterday the shadow made me put a pillow over the
baby’s face, and I might have suffocated him if my toddler

outside on the porch with the baby and my daughter. If I kill
myself, will the shadow go away?” [It is noteworthy this
incident occurred in January in the Midwest].

POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS
 severe,life-long mood disorder (23, 25–28). After an incipient
postpartum affective psychosis, a woman has a 50%280%
chance of developing another serious psychiatric episode,
usually within the bipolar spectrum (29, 30). For 20%250%
of women, affective psychosis remains limited to the post-
partum period (23, 25–28). The wide ranges are due to
variability in figures from the few studies available. Women
with postpartum psychosis usually have one of two disease
courses: 1) isolated postpartum psychosis (vulnerability
to affective psychosis only after birth) or 2) postpartum
psychosis as an expression of bipolar mood disorder with
nonperinatal episodes.
ETIOLOGY
Postpartum psychosis is among the few psychiatric disorders
in which a clear etiological event is definable. Although
childbirth is a trigger for postpartum psychosis, many im-
portant questions regarding its pathophysiology remain un-
answered. A significant predictor is primiparity; therefore,
if a woman’s first delivery is not complicated by postpartum
psychosis, the likelihood becomes substantially lower after a
subsequent delivery (31). In contrast to postpartum unipolar
depression, life events and social stress are not implicated
in the etiology of postpartum psychosis (32, 33). Moreover,
investigators have not consistently identified obstetric risk
factorsforfirst-lifetimeonsetofpostpartumpsychosis(7,34).
Conducting neurobiological studies of patients with post-
partum psychosis is a challenge due to the low incidence of
the disorder combined with the acute severity. Presumably,
the mechanism of onset is related to specific physiological
changes at birth in genetically vulnerable women. Here,
we review the related genetic research and potential phys-
iological postpartum triggers (endocrine, immunological,
circadian).
Genetic studies in women with first-lifetime onset post-
partum psychosis are absent, but the vulnerability for post-
partum relapse in women with bipolar disorder has been
investigated. Postpartum psychiatric episodes may be a
marker of a familial form of bipolar disorder (35, 36). In a
major step toward identifying causative etiological factors,
JonesandCraddock(35)identifiedtheenrichmentofspecific
genetic variants of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT)
and a genome-wide significant linkage signal at chromosome
16p13 in patients with a history of bipolar disorder and
postpartum psychosis (37, 38). Exploration of estrogen re-
ceptor or glucocorticoid receptor gene polymorphisms in
relation to postpartum psychosis has not established an
association (39, 40). Encouraging for research potential, a
perinatal psychiatry genetic consortium, a large-scale col-
laborative research effort to disentangle the pathophysiology
of postpartum psychiatric disorders including postpartum
psychosis, has been established (35).
Little research has been targeted at understanding the
hormonal correlates of postpartum psychosis, and the ma-
jority of studies were performed two decades ago. During
pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone (among
other hormones) rise exponentially. Around 35 weeks gesta-
tion, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-binding protein
declines and results in a surge of CRH and ACTH, which
precede parturition. After birth, the precipitous drop in es-
trogen and progesterone levels occurs, and these hormones
normalize within 3 weeks (41). This many-fold concentra-
tion change in reproductive hormone levels associated with
parturition has been implicated in the etiology of postpartum
psychosis (42). Because estrogen mediates dopaminergic tone
in the hypothalamus, the onset of affective psychosis after
childbirth was reported to result in an increased sensitivity of
dopamine receptors (42); however, others have not replicated
thisfinding(43).Iftherapiddeclineinestrogenconcentrations
is the trigger for postpartum psychosis, immediate postbirth
administration might prevent psychosis. However, data from
opentrialsincludeasmallcaseseriessuggestingefficacywitha
high-doseoralestrogen-taperingregimenafterbirth(44)anda
randomized trial demonstrating no impact of a regimen of
transdermal estradiol on relapse in women at risk for post-
partum mood disorders (45).
An interesting relationship between cortisol and dopa-
mine exists in relation to postpartum psychosis. Animal
studies have suggested that glucocorticoid secretion in the
postpartum period is regulated, in part, by the dopaminergic
system (46). However, the role of dopamine in glucocorticoid
and prolactin secretion in postpartum women must be elu-
cidated within the context of lactation. The release of oxy-
tocin during suckling is associated with feelings of well-being
and relaxation and a hypo-responsiveness to stressors. An
interesting study conducted in the 1980s showed that one
woman with postpartum mania had high levels of oxytocin
metabolites (47).
Evidence is limited regarding the influence of pregnancy
hormones in the etiology of postpartum psychosis. In women
with and without a history of postpartum depression or
premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the role of changes in
gonadal steroid levels has been investigated by simulating
hormonal conditions related to pregnancy and parturition
(48, 49). Similarly, women at risk for postpartum psychosis
may have differential sensitivity to rapid changes in the plasma
concentrations of these hormones rather than having altered
peripheral levels (50, 51).
Postpartum activation of the immune system could be an
etiologic contributor to the acute onset of mania, psychosis
(52,53),anxiety,anddepression(52,54–56).Berginketal.(57,58)
have reported the co-occurrence of postpartum psychosis with
thyroiditis and preeclampsia, which have established autoim-
mune and inflammatory etiologies, respectively. In addition,
the investigators reported the identification of CNS auto-
antibodies in 4/96 (4%) of patients with postpartum psycho-
sis, which suggests autoimmune encephalitis in a subset
of cases (59). Two of these patients had anti-N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, while for the
other two patients the antigen was unknown. Furthermore,
they observed abnormalities in monocyte activation, T-cell

 function, and tryptophan breakdown in patients with
postpartum psychosis during the acute phase compared
with postpartum control subjects (52, 60). Specifically,
many patients had a monocytosis and did not show the
physiological T-cell elevation of the normal postpartum
period. These findings support the notion that immuno-
logical mechanism(s) contributed to affective instability
and psychosis.
Circadian rhythm disruption is common in postpartum
psychosis (61–65). Investigators have consistently reported
that women with psychosis have severe sleep disturbances,
which often herald the psychotic symptoms in the post-
partum period (66, 67). Sleep disruption resulting from labor
and delivery may initiate the circadian disruption and con-
tributetotheemergenceofanepisodeofmaniaormixedstate
(63). In first-time mothers, the early postpartum period is
characterized by more wakings, a later onset of stage 4 and
restorative REM sleep (62), and sleep loss (68).
In summary, postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric con-
dition with a mechanism of onset related to specific physi-
ological changes (e.g., hormonal, immunological, circadian
rhythm) leading to disease in genetically vulnerable women.
Whether these factors lead to a common pathway resulting
in psychosis or whether postpartum psychosis is a hetero-
geneous disorder with multiple etiologic contributors are
evolving research questions.
DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS
Screening for perinatal depression was recommended by
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (69). An under-
recognized concern is that postpartum women who screen
positive for depression may have bipolar rather than unipolar
disorder. In a large-scale screening study, 22.6% of screen-
positive women had bipolar disorder (70). Diagnostic clari-
fication of screen-positive women through interview or the
Mood Disorders Questionnaire (71) is an important addition
to the postpartum screening process. Additionally, a striking
14% of depressed women who had initial psychiatric contacts
during the first postpartum month converted to a bipolar
diagnosis within 15 years compared with 4% with a first
psychiatric contact unrelated to childbirth (72).
Women with postpartum psychosis require a high level
of care, and inpatient psychiatric hospitalization is recom-
mended for diagnostic assessment and treatment. Clinical
symptoms vary widely. Even in an individual woman, rapid
fluctuationsinsymptomsarereferredtoas“thekaleidoscopic
picture of postpartum psychosis” (73, 74). Assessment of
mood and psychotic symptoms (including thoughts of the
patient harming herself or her children) at multiple post-
partum time points is useful for diagnostic and maternal and
infant safety assessments. The diagnostic picture is typically
as follows (also see Figure 1):
1. Mania or mixed episodes (with or without psychotic
features);
2. Depressive episodes with psychotic features; and
3. Nonaffective psychotic episodes (occurring in ,10% of
cases).
Some women (variably estimated at 20%250%) experi-
ence episodes only during the postpartum period, without
recurrence outside this vulnerable time (21, 23, 25–28).
Psychotic symptoms can be overlooked because they are
either fluctuating or hidden (as in the second case presented
in the introduction of this article). It is important to ask both
the patient and her family about early symptoms of psycho-
sis, such as paranoid ideas, thoughts others might consider
unusual, or strong feelings of guilt. Depressed psychotic
symptoms often include suicidal and infanticidal thoughts
(e.g., my child is better off without me), and such patients
require a higher level of care to ensure safety of the mother
and infant. Assessment should include direct questions about
suicidal and infanticidal thoughts. Patients may experience
perceptualdisturbances,bothauditoryandvisual,withdirect
command for harmful actions. Examinations should include
assessment for treatable causes of psychosis, including acute
FIGURE 1. Diagnostic Considerations
•  
Postpartum psychosis is defi
 ned as a new occurrence of the 
following symptoms within 6 weeks postpartum: 
 
1. Mania/ mixed episodes with or without psychotic features
 
2. Depression with psychotic features
 
3. Psychosis without mood symptoms
•  
Establish whether the patient is presenting with a fi
 rst-
lifetime onset of psychosis or she has had previous 
episodes of depression, hypomania, or mania because this 
factor impacts prognosis. This requires careful exploration 
because many women will have past episodes that were not 
identifi
 ed.
•  
Women with fi
 rst onset postpartum psychosis usually have 
one of two disease courses: isolated postpartum psychosis 
(vulnerability to aff
 ective psychosis only after birth) or 
postpartum psychosis as an expression of bipolar mood 
disorder with non-perinatal episodes.
•  
Always inquire about thoughts of self-harm, harming her 
infant or other children. Non-judgmental inquiry can be 
made as follows: “Some new mothers have thoughts such 
as wishing the baby were dead or about harming the baby; 
has this happened to you?”
•  
Perform physical and neurological examination.
•  
Obtain comprehensive metabolic profi
 le, complete blood 
count, TSH, free T4, TPO antibodies, ammonia level, and 
urinalysis.
•  
Screen for substances of abuse that may present with 
psychotic symptoms secondary to intoxication or 
withdrawal.
•  
With neurological symptoms, consider brain imaging, 
cerebrospinal fl
 uid analysis and limbic encephalitis and 
antibody screening.

 infection, peripartum blood loss and anemia, and exacerba-
tion of predicting endocrine and/or autoimmune diseases.
Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count to
evaluate for an infectious process (including mastitis and
endometritis), urinalysis to assess for cystitis, and a com-
prehensive metabolic screen. Primary hypoparathyroidism
has been reported in a postpartum woman who presented
with psychosis, stool incontinence, seizures, and hypocal-
cemia (75). Thyroid autoimmune diseases occur in 5%27%
of women during the postpartum period (76), and the per-
centage is higher in women with postpartum psychosis (up to
20%) (57). Monitoring of thyroid function is advisable, es-
pecially in patients with thyroid peroxidase antibody posi-
tivity because these women are at the highest risk for thyroid
dysfunction. We recommend measuring thyroid-stimulating
hormone, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibodies both at
the time of diagnosis and a few months later (57). There is a
well-documented postpartum rebound of thyroid peroxidase
antibodies during the first months postpartum, and an initial
negative screen immediately postpartum does not rule out
thyroid disease.
Neurological symptoms, including seizures, decreased
consciousness, dyskinesia, overt motor symptoms, and
extrapyramidal symptoms raise the index of suspicion for
anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Primary screening for NMDAR
encephalitis can be done in serum, but false positivity is
common, and CSF analysis is preferable (59). Neurological
symptoms are indication for an MRI to evaluate whether
other brain pathology is present.
Lastly, childbearing is a physiological challenge to meta-
bolic pathways that may become stressed by the extreme
postbirth catabolic state. Previously unrecognized, late-onset
inbornerrorsofmetabolismcanpresentwithclinicalfeatures
similar to postpartum psychosis. Clinical information im-
portant in the differential diagnosis is an abnormal neuro-
logical examination, seizures, and, in urea cycle disorders, a
history of the patient’s avoidance of protein consumption
(77, 78). A serum ammonia concentration will identify the
presence of a urea cycle disorder. A positive test can be
followed by plasma amino acid analysis and further studies
(77, 78). A review of alcohol and substance use and drug
screen should be performed to identify toxic or withdrawal
syndromes that may present with psychotic symptoms.
TREATMENT
Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that re-
quires immediate psychiatric evaluation. In many countries,
inpatient mother and baby joint admission units are the
preferred treatment settings and are associated with im-
proved satisfaction with care and reduced time to recovery
(79, 80). Rare mother-infant psychiatric services have been
developed in the United States (79), but care is usually de-
livered to postpartum women in standard mental health
treatment settings. Involvement of the patient’s family or
significant others is an important component of care. They
typicallybringthenewmotherforevaluationandarealarmed
by the changes in her behavior. They are important allies in
medication compliance, maternal and infant safety moni-
toring, and support of the evolving maternal role. The goals of
treatment are not only to reduce psychiatric symptoms, but to
support self-esteem, confidence in mothering, social and family
function, and infant health and emotional development (81).
Less than 30 published studies describing the treatment
of postpartum psychosis were found in the literature (82).
The majority of these are case reports describing a single pa-
tient, and very few studies include more than 10 patients.
The largest evidence base exists for treatment with lithium,
antipsychotics, and ECT, and we therefore discuss these
treatment options. In case studies, lithium was an effective
monotherapy (83), and for adjunctive treatment (84, 85). A
recent naturalistic cohort study in 64 women provided evi-
dence that lithium is highly efficacious for acute treatment
of postpartum psychosis, as well as maintenance treatment
(86). The authors observed that nearly all patients (98.4%)
achieved complete remission, with a median episode dura-
tion of 40 days. The treatment regimen included sequential
administration of short-term benzodiazepines, antipsychot-
ics, and lithium, with response monitoring. The drug se-
quence was designed to promote sleep, target psychosis,
and stabilize mood, respectively. Women who remitted on
antipsychotic monotherapy continued the drug as mainte-
nance therapy, while the 48 women who required both anti-
psychotics and lithium to achieve remission were maintained
on lithium monotherapy. At 9 months postpartum, sustained
remission was observed in 79.7% of patients. Patients treated
with lithium monotherapy had a significantly lower rate of
relapse compared with those receiving antipsychotic mon-
otherapy (86). The authors of this study concur that most
women with postpartum psychosis have a particularly robust
response to lithium. In our opinion, lithium monotherapy is
the preferred initial intervention for postpartum psychosis
(see Figure 2).
Antipsychotic treatment has been described in case re-
ports on chlorpromazine, clozapine, pimozide, and quetia-
pine (82, 87). The study described above (86) demonstrated
that antipsychotic monotherapy was efficacious in 20% of
women within 2 weeks, after which nonremitted women
were treated with lithium (86). The overwhelming majority
of patients responded to adjunctive lithium treatment and
achieved clinical remission. The authors acknowledged the
likelihood that more patients might have had a favorable
response to antipsychotic monotherapy if they had been
treated longer than 2 weeks; however, antipsychotic mono-
therapy was not protective for sustained remission, in con-
trast to lithium monotherapy.
Few studies have explored the efficacy of ECT in the
treatment of postpartum psychosis (88). In one case, treat-
ment with chlorpromazine was ineffective, while ECT
resulted in remission (89). Similarly, a case series of five
women with treatment-refractory postpartum psychosis
described positive treatment outcomes with ECT (90).

 AretrospectivestudycomparedtheclinicalresponsestoECT
in women with postpartum psychosis compared with non-
postpartum psychosis. The postpartum group was found to
have greater clinical improvement following ECT compared
with the nonpostpartum group (91). In a study conducted in
India, 34 women received successful ECT treatment, and it
was proposed as a first-line treatment option (92). However,
in a cohort study, agitation, mania, and psychotic symptoms
responded well to pharmacotherapy in 98% of cases (86), and
none of these patients required ECT. ECT is the primary
treatment for patients with catatonia, severe agitation, or
refusal to eat or drink. Moreover, ECT should be considered
in patients with depression with psychotic features because
of the longer median duration of episode (115 days) compared
with postpartum mania (34 days) (9).
Studies on the efficacy of circadian rhythm interventions
to treat postpartum psychosis are lacking. Interesting treat-
ment options include add-on treatment with blue-blocking
glasses for patients in a postpartum manic state (93).
The management of a breastfeeding woman with acute
onset of psychosis is a challenging clinical situation that must
be individualized. The well-established benefits of breast-
feeding must be considered in the context of maternal mental
health, which is the priority in this situation. Sleep depri-
vation due to frequent awakenings for breastfeeding may
contribute to the onset and maintenance of mania, and
re-establishment of regular circadian patterns is critical to
recovery. Strategies to preserve sleep (another person to feed
the infant at night, pharmacotherapy to support sleep) are
critical for maternal well-being.
However, even seriously ill mothers with psychosis may
insist on breastfeeding as a condition of treatment accep-
tance.Inthesecases,weighingthepotentialbenefitsandrisks
of breastfeeding with pharmacotherapy remains a clinical
dilemma. Sparse data from mothers who provided paired
mother-infant serum lithium concentrations are available to
guide treatment (94–97). The range of the infant to maternal
concentrations varied from 5% to 65%, with the infant level
typically about 25% of the maternal level (94). One infant
became dehydrated during an infection and became toxic
(level: 1.4 mEq/L) (97). Although no serious adverse effects
wereobserved inthemajority ofthese breastfed infants,close
observation and monitoring of thyroid and renal function
was recommended. Few data are available for antipsychotic
drugs; however, the infant doses of olanzapine, risperidone,
quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole received through
breast milk have been estimated to be less than 5% of the
maternal dose (98). Limited use of short half-life benzodi-
azepine agents to promote sleep is preferred during the
postpartum period, while chronic use of benzodiazepines
during breastfeeding may result in infant sedation. The ex-
posure of the breastfed infant to maternal medications may
be reduced with the use of ECT (92), which requires short-
acting pharmacologic agents during the procedure. If the
mother is breastfeeding, the patient and family caregivers
should 1) be provided with breastfeeding support, 2) monitor
the infant for signs of toxicity (poor suck intensity, decreased
feeding, lethargy), 3) be educated about situations that ele-
vate the risk for infant dehydration (reduced feeding/oral
intake, excessive fluid loss, or fever), and 4) have access to
a pediatric professional willing to monitor the infant under
these circumstances.
PREVENTION
Guiding women at high risk for psychosis through pregnancy
and the postpartum period is a challenge for health care
professionals (99). The strongest risk factors for postpartum
psychosis are a history of bipolar disorder and/or a history
of postpartum psychosis (8, 100). Total postpartum relapse
rates for both groups are similar, but there are substantial
differences in the approach to prophylaxis.
In a recent meta-analysis, the overall postpartum relapse
risk was 37% in women with bipolar disorder (101). In 17% of
the cases, patients suffered from affective psychosis, mania,
mixed episodes, or relapses that required hospitalization.
The remaining patients had nonpsychotic affective episodes
(mostly depressive and a limited number of hypomanic
episodes). In women with bipolar disorder, postpartum re-
lapse rates were significantly higher among those who were
medication-free during pregnancy (66%, 95% confidence
interval [CI]=57–75) compared with those who used pro-
phylactic medication (23%, 95% CI=14–37) (101). Clearly, the
benefits of prophylaxis during pregnancy need to be carefully

Inpatient psychiatric treatment for the woman with 
postpartum psychosis is usually required for diagnostic 
evaluation, safety assessment, and treatment initiation.
•

 cant others who will 
be allies in her treatment and recovery.
•  
Lithium is the drug of fi
 rst choice during the acute phase 
of the illness unless contraindicated (e.g., due to impaired 
renal function, serious side eff
 ects during prior treatment).
•  
ECT, antipsychotic medication, or benzodiazepines are 
useful adjunctive treatments for the acute treatment of 
severe manic or psychotic symptoms. ECT should be 
considered in patients with severe catatonic features 
and depression with psychotic features, due to the 
relatively longer median duration of episode compared to 
postpartum mania.
•  
Maintenance treatment with lithium during the fi
 rst 6–9 
months postpartum (target blood level 0.6–0.8). Gradually 
tapering off
  lithium can be considered in women who have 
only postpartum episodes and who remain in full clinical 
remission during a time of low psychosocial stress.
•  
Avoid the use of antidepressants for the acute treatment 
of postpartum depression with psychotic features in the 
absence of appropriate mood stabilization because of the 
risk of exacerbating mood instability.

POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS
 weighed against the risks to the fetus (also see Figure 3). Few
dataareavailabletoevaluatetheefficacyofpharmacotherapy
when it is initiated immediately after delivery as a pro-
phylactic strategy in women who have not been treated
during pregnancy. However, in all studies using prophylactic
treatment with lithium, women with bipolar disorder had
significantly lower rates of postpartum relapse (102–104).
In contrast, valproate failed to demonstrate significant
prophylactic benefits (105). Olanzapine prophylaxis was
equivocal, and further investigation of second-generation
antipsychotics is warranted (45, 105, 106); however, the
established efficacy of lithium makes it the drug of first
choice.
The overall relapse risk for women with only postpartum-
onset psychoses is 31% (95% CI=22–42) as derived from
13 studies, 595 deliveries, and 528 patients (107). The risk of a
postpartum episode (affective psychosis, mania, mixed epi-
sode, or relapse requiring hospitalization) was significantly
higher in patients with a history of postpartum psychosis
(29%, 95% CI=20–41) compared with women with more
chronic forms of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, in stark
contrast to the high rates of relapse in women with bipolar
disorder during pregnancy, women with a history of psy-
chosis limited to the postpartum period are not at elevated
risk of psychiatric episodes during pregnancy (102). For this
subgroup of women, prophylaxis using either lithium or
antipsychotics immediately postpartum was highly effective
in preventing postpartum relapse (107).
We recommend different treatment algorithms for women
with chronic bipolar disorder and women with a history of
psychosis limited to the postpartum period. In women with
bipolar disorder, prophylaxis during pregnancy increases the
likelihood of maintaining mood stability during pregnancy
and preventing postpartum relapse. In contrast, prophy-
lactic treatment immediately after birth in women with a
history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period is
appropriate (102).
FUTURE RESEARCH
No randomized trials for the treatment of postpartum psy-
chosis(108)havebeenpublished;indeed,suchtrialswouldbe
challenging to conduct due to the low incidence. Fortunately,
the majority of women with postpartum-onset psychosis
experience remission with currently available interventions.
Elucidating the biological determinants of women who are
vulnerable to chronic forms of bipolar disorder compared
with women who only experience relapse immediately fol-
lowing delivery is of great pathophysiological interest.
Follow-up data will provide guidance to determine the du-
ration of treatment following remission and quantification of
the risk for conversion to bipolar disorder following a first-
onset postpartum psychosis.
The reproductive events that occur throughout women’s
lives can be conceptualized as a “longitudinal laboratory”
(109) for research hypothesis generation. Women act as their
own controls across time for evaluating changes in state
variables (present at the time of the episode) and trait vari-
ables (absent during active illness but indicative of risk for
the disorder). Research advances result from elaborating our
understanding of psychiatric disorders by discovering new
relationships between factors that explain aspects of illness
and wellness. Postpartum psychosis, although rare, is an ex-
ample of a psychiatric disorder with rapid progression from
wellness to severe disorder in association with the predictable
event of birth. Repeated childbirth experiences may result
in kindling (increased behavioral responsivity to the same
stimulation over time) with progression to spontaneous epi-
sodes not associated with the triggering event (birth) (110).
Postpartum psychosis offers an intriguing model to explore
etiologic contributions to the neurobiology of affective psy-
chosis as reviewed in this article (genetic, hormonal, immune,
circadian), as the boundary between psychiatric and neuro-
logical disorders fades and new interventions emerge.
We conclude where we began, with the observations of
Louis Victor Marcé (2), which remain true today: “Where
subjects are predisposed to mental illness through either
FIGURE 3. Strategies for Prevention of Postpartum Psychosis
Develop an individualized postpartum relapse prevention plan 
in collaboration with the patient, family, and obstetrical and 
pediatric care professionals including: 
•  
Description of medication prophylaxis (during pregnancy 
and/or after delivery)
•  
Progressive intervention strategies to be implemented, 
beginning with the earliest signs of prodromal symptoms of 
relapse 
•  
Coordination of pregnancy, labor, and pain management 
plan with the obstetrical team 
•  
Coordination with pediatric staff
  for monitoring an infant 
with in utero medication exposure
•  
Preference for feeding (breastfeeding or bottle feeding)
•  
Strategies to assist women in obtaining adequate sleep 
and maintain a stable circadian rhythm (signifi
 cant other to 
provide night feeding, sleep medication)
•  
Stress management planning for the family 
•  
Support of maternal-newborn attachment with family 
involvement 
For women with an isolated episode of postpartum 
psychosis:
Initiate pharmacologic prophylaxis, preferably with lithium, 
immediately after delivery for relapse prevention. 
For women with bipolar disorder:
Conduct risk-benefi
 t assessment and consider continuation 
of prophylactic medication during pregnancy to increase the 
probability of maintaining mood stability through childbearing. 
The woman’s medication response history will dictate the 
drug choice; however, the most evidence-based intervention 
is lithium. Data regarding the prophylactic effi
  cacy of 
lamotrigine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone are 
scarce.
