Long-term outcomes for neoadjuvant versus adjuvant 
chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of 
individual patient data from ten randomised trials
Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG)*
Summary
Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for early breast cancer can make breast-conserving surgery more 
feasible and might be more likely to eradicate micrometastatic disease than might the same chemotherapy given after 
surgery. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of NACT and the influence of tumour characteristics on 
outcome with a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from relevant randomised trials.
Methods We obtained information about prerandomisation tumour characteristics, clinical tumour response, surgery, 
recurrence, and mortality for 4756 women in ten randomised trials in early breast cancer that began before 2005 and 
compared NACT with the same chemotherapy given postoperatively. Primary outcomes were tumour response, 
extent of local therapy, local and distant recurrence, breast cancer death, and overall mortality. Analyses by 
intention-to-treat used standard regression (for response and frequency of breast-conserving therapy) and log-rank 
methods (for recurrence and mortality).
Findings Patients entered the trials from 1983 to 2002 and median follow-up was 9 years (IQR 5–14), with the last 
follow-up in 2013. Most chemotherapy was anthracycline based (3838 [81%] of 4756 women). More than two thirds 
(1349 [69%] of 1947) of women allocated NACT had a complete or partial clinical response. Patients allocated NACT 
had an increased frequency of breast-conserving therapy (1504 [65%] of 2320 treated with NACT vs 1135 [49%] of 
2318 treated with adjuvant chemotherapy). NACT was associated with more frequent local recurrence than was 
adjuvant chemotherapy: the 15 year local recurrence was 21·4% for NACT versus 15·9% for adjuvant chemotherapy 
(5·5% increase [95% CI 2·4–8·6]; rate ratio 1·37 [95% CI 1·17–1·61]; p=0·0001). No significant difference between 
NACT and adjuvant chemotherapy was noted for distant recurrence (15 year risk 38·2% for NACT vs 38·0% for 
adjuvant chemotherapy; rate ratio 1·02 [95% CI 0·92–1·14]; p=0·66), breast cancer mortality (34·4% vs 33·7%; 1·06 
[0·95–1·18]; p=0·31), or death from any cause (40·9% vs 41·2%; 1·04 [0·94–1·15]; p=0·45).
Interpretation Tumours downsized by NACT might have higher local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy than 
might tumours of the same dimensions in women who have not received NACT. Strategies to mitigate the increased 
local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy in tumours downsized by NACT should be considered—eg, careful 
tumour localisation, detailed pathological assessment, and appropriate radiotherapy.

Introduction
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)—ie, chemotherapy 
begun before breast cancer surgery—was introduced in 
the 1970s,1 aiming to downstage locally advanced 
(inoperable) disease and make it operable. NACT was 
subsequently extended to operable (early) breast cancer, 
mainly to allow breast-conserving surgery, and is now 
widely used, particularly for large tumours.2–4 Further-
more, NACT might be somewhat more likely to eradicate 
micrometastatic disease than might chemotherapy 
delayed until after surgery.
NACT might mitigate the hypo 
thesised stimulatory 
effect of surgery on occult disease5 and reduce tumour 
cell shedding during surgery. NACT might also provide 
useful in-vivo information about the chemosensitivity of 
the local (and, by implication, disseminated) tumour to 
different chemotherapy regimens, helping to guide 
subsequent drug selection.6,7 Conversely, by delaying 
surgery, NACT might increase the risk of metastatic 
spread, particularly for chemoresistant tumours.
Several randomised trials8–17 have compared NACT 
with the same chemotherapy given postoperatively. 
Interpretation of these trials is complicated, however, as 
the frequency of breast-conserving surgery often differed 
between groups because of tumour shrinkage after 
NACT. In certain trials,14,15 some good responders to 
NACT did not receive surgery, and high frequencies of 
local recurrence with NACT in these trials have been 
attributed to omission of definitive local therapy. Any 
such differences in the extent of surgery confound

comparisons of the efficacy of NACT with that of 
adjuvant chemotherapy.18,19 Another complication is that 
investigations of the influence of tumour characteristics 
on outcome need to use prerandomisation data, as 
analyses by postsurgical characteristics would be 
substantially biased by downstaging.20 To investigate 
such issues in more detail than was possible in reviews18,19 
of published data, we did a patient-level meta-analysis of 
the trials that directly compared any NACT regimen 
with the same regimen begun postoperatively.
Methods
Study design and participants
We sought data from all randomised trials in early 
(ie, operable) breast cancer that began before 2005 and 
compared NACT with the same chemotherapy begun 
after surgery (ie, standard adjuvant chemotherapy). 
NACT always started before surgery, although in some 
trials, some of the chemotherapy in the NACT group 
was given postoperatively, whereas all chemotherapy in 
the control group had to be postoperative (so trials such 
as NSABP B-2721 were ineligible). Trial identification 
and data checking were as reported previously22,23 and 
conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (Individual 
Patient Data).24 For every woman, we requested 
information from the trial’s principal investigator or 
another appropriate member of their research group 
about patient and tumour characteristics, treatments, 
dates of any local recurrence (breast, chest wall, or 
regional nodes), distant recurrence, contralateral breast 
or other second primary cancer, and date last known to 
be alive or date and underlying cause of death. To avoid 
bias, we sought data for tumour characteristics recorded 
before randomisation since these characteristics can be 
altered by neoadjuvant treatment. We also requested 
tumour response after NACT (assessed mostly by 
palpation and mammography). To investigate the 
influence of NACT on extent of surgery, we sought 
details of surgery planned at randomisation and surgery 
actually done. When planned surgery was unknown, it 
was inferred from clinical tumour size. Patient-level data 
for radiotherapy were unavailable.
Statistical analysis
A detailed description of the statistical methods has been 
previously published.22 Primary outcomes assessed were 
tumour response (complete response [no clinical 
evidence of disease after NACT], partial response 
[≥50% reduction in initial size], or stable or progressive 
disease [<50% reduction, no change, or increased tumour 
size]), extent of local therapy (mastectomy, lumpectomy 
[either with or without radiotherapy], and radiotherapy 
alone), local and distant recurrence, breast cancer death 
(via subtraction of the log-rank statistics of death without 
recurrence from those of overall survival23), and overall 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study
The Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group’s ongoing 
extensive searches of bibliographic databases, including 
MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts 
up to March 2017, identified 16 trials that compared 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with the same 
chemotherapy postoperatively. Meta-analyses of published 
reports indicate that NACT reduced the frequency of 
mastectomy but did not affect mortality. Interpretation is 
complicated, however, as the use of breast-conserving surgery 
often differed between groups because of tumour shrinkage by 
NACT. In certain trials, some patients with a good response did 
not receive surgery. Hence, women allocated NACT retained 
more breast tissue than did those allocated adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and higher local recurrence frequencies in some 
neoadjuvant trials than in others have been attributed to 
omission of definitive local therapy. 
Added value of this study
We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from trials 
that compared NACT with the same chemotherapy given 
postoperatively. We assessed effects of patient and tumour 
characteristics on tumour response, extent of local therapy, 
local and distant recurrence, breast cancer death, and overall 
mortality. This individual patient data meta-analysis, involving 
4756 women in ten trials, found that the frequencies of clinical 
response and breast-conserving therapy were higher for smaller, 
higher-grade, and oestrogen receptor-negative and 
progesterone receptor-negative tumours, and for one trial using 
anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. Although responders 
to NACT had lower distant recurrence and breast cancer 
mortality than did non-responders, when responders and 
non-responders were combined, distant recurrence and breast 
cancer mortality were similar for NACT and adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Local recurrence was, however, higher with 
NACT than with adjuvant chemotherapy, which persisted for 
10 years after treatment and was not confined to trials in which 
surgery could be omitted after response to NACT. 
Implications of all the available evidence
NACT is as effective as adjuvant chemotherapy in reducing the 
risk of distant recurrence and death from breast cancer. 
However, NACT is associated with higher local recurrence than 
adjuvant chemotherapy, which could be at least partly 
explained by wider use of breast-conserving therapy after NACT 
than with postoperative chemotherapy. Strategies to mitigate 
the increased local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy in 
tumours downsized by NACT should be considered—eg, careful 
tumour localisation, detailed pathological assessment, and 
appropriate radiotherapy.

mortality (death from any cause). Analyses were by 
intention to treat and are of first isolated local recurrence 
(site not generally available), any distant recurrence 
(irrespective of previous local or contralateral recurrence), 
breast 
cancer 
mortality, 
and 
all-cause 
mortality. 
We treated deaths from new cancers of unknown primary 
sites as breast cancer deaths. When no recurrence was 
reported before breast cancer death, we assumed distant 
recurrence to have just preceded it. We took deaths from 
an unknown cause without recorded recurrence to be 
non-breast cancer deaths. Comparisons of NACT 
response and frequency of breast-conserving therapy 
used regression models,25 accounting for tumour size 
and trial. We stratified log-rank analyses by trial, 
follow-up year, age at entry (<35 years, 35–44 years, 
45–54 years, 55–69 years, and ≥70 years), and 
prerandomisation clinical nodal status (N0 or other).
In such analyses, if a log-rank statistic (o−e) has 
variance v, then, defining z=(o−e)/√v and b=(o−e)/v, the 
event rate ratio (RR; NACT vs control) is estimated as 
exp(b) with SE=(RR−1)/z. RRs and confidence limits 
for RR are derived from those for b (by normal 
approximations). To test for a trend between n strata 
(eg, of age) in the effects of treatment, we supposed that 
stratum number s (s=1,2,…,n) has log-rank statistics 
(o–e) and v (with grand total over all strata O–E and V). 
We defined m, the mean stratum number, to be the sum, 
one term per stratum, of sv/V and define T to be the 
sum, one term per stratum, of (s–m)(o–e).26 The variance 
of T, var(T), is then the sum, one term per stratum, of 
(s–m)²/v. The trend test statistic (ie, the change from one 
stratum to the next in the log of the event RR) is then 
T/var(T), which has variance 1/var(T). Tests of whether 
two trends are the same involve subtraction of the 
corresponding trend test statistics from each other. 
A χ² statistic on one degree of freedom (χ²₁) for testing of 
whether some quantity Q differs significantly from zero 
is given by Q/var(Q). A χ² test (on n–1 degrees of 
freedom) for heterogeneity can be obtained by subtracting 
(O–E)²/V from the sum of the separate values, one per 
stratum, of (o–e)²/v. For analyses by regression, we 
estimated RRs by maximum likelihood; tests for trend 
and heterogeneity were by likelihood ratio.
Associations between baseline variables and outcome 
used prerandomisation values. Only two trials provided 
pathological response data, so correlations of charac-
teristics with response to NACT use clinical response 
data (available for eight of ten trials). Subgroup analyses 
compare outcomes in trials in which all women 
allocated NACT were, or were not, scheduled to receive 
breast surgery and in women whose initially planned 
local treatment was mastectomy or breast-conserving 
therapy (lumpectomy with or without radiotherapy or 
radiotherapy alone). Sensitivity analyses assess the 
potential effect27 on local recurrence of competing 
events 
(distant 
recurrence 
and 
death 
without 
recurrence) and of omission of trials with only first 
recurrences recorded. p values of 0·05 or less are 
described as significant. Analyses used Stata 13.1 and 
R 2.13.2.

Results
Individual patient data were available from ten8–17 of 
16 eligible trials identified and from 4756 (91%) of the 
5250 women in total (table 1, appendix pp 2, 6, 17). Trial 
entry year for participants was 1983–2002, median 
follow-up was 9 years (IQR 5–14), with the last follow-up 
in 2013, and median age was 49 years (43–57). 1604 deaths 
occurred, including 248 (15%) without recurrence. Of the 
4756 women included in the analysis, 3838 (81%) were in 
trials of regimens that included an anthracycline, one of 
which (902 women) also gave a taxane.13 Four trials 
(918 women) used MMM (mitoxantrone, methotrexate, 
and mitomycin-C)11,12 or CMF (cyclophosphamide, 
methotrexate, and fluorouracil)8,17 as NACT; in these 
trials, some chemotherapy in those allocated NACT was

given after surgery (table 1, appendix pp 3–4). No patients 
received trastuzumab.
Across all trials, NACT was associated with substantial 
tumour response (table 2), moderately increased use of 
breast-conserving therapy in the NACT group compared 
with the adjuvant chemotherapy group (figure 1), and an 
absolute increase in 15 year local recurrence of 
5·5% (95% CI 2·4–8·6; 21·4% for NACT vs 15·9% for 
adjuvant chemotherapy), corresponding to a RR of 
1·37 (95% CI 1·17–1·61; p=0·0001; figure 2A). The 
incidence of local recurrence was significantly higher 
with NACT than with adjuvant chemotherapy in years 
0–4 (RR 1·35 [95% CI 1·11–1·64]; p=0·003) and 
5–9 (1·53 [1·08–2·17]; p=0·02), with few local recurrences 
after year 10. Sensitivity analyses indicated no substantial 
influence of competing risks from other breast events on 
the RRs for local recurrence (appendix p 18).
As anticipated,18,19 the absolute increase in 10-year local 
recurrence with NACT was largest in the two trials14,15 in 
which, after NACT, many women did not have breast 
surgery (13·3% [95% CI 5·5–21·1]; 33·7% for NACT vs 
20·4% for adjuvant chemotherapy; RR 1·62 [95% CI 
1·20–2·19], p=0·002; figure 3B). In the other eight 
trials,8–13,16,17 surgery was scheduled irrespective of response 
to NACT, and the absolute increase in 10 year local 
recurrence was 3·2% (95% CI 0·6–5·8; 15·1% vs 11·9%; 
RR 1·28 [95% CI 1·06–1·55], p=0·01; figure 3A). However, 
the RRs for local recurrence in these two sets of trials 
were not significantly different (heterogeneity p=0·19).
Between-trial RRs for local recurrence ranged from 
0·67 (95% CI 0·24–1·91) to 4·59 (1·19–17·8), but this 
apparent heterogeneity was not significant (χ²10=11·8; 
p=0·30; figure 4A). RRs for local recurrence also did 
not differ significantly between the three classes of 
chemotherapy used in these trials (figure 4, appendix 
p 13), between trials in which chemotherapy in the NACT 
group was or was not completed after local therapy 
(appendix p 13), or between use or not of tamoxifen 
(figure 5, appendix p 13).
We noted no significant differences between NACT and 
adjuvant treatment in 15 year distant recurrence (38·2% for 
NACT vs 38·0% for adjuvant chemotherapy; RR 1·02 
[95% CI 0·92–1·14]; p=0·66), breast cancer death (34·4% 
vs 33·7%; 1·06 [0·95–1·18]; p=0·31), or death from any 
cause (40·9% vs 41·2%; 1·04 [0·94–1·15]; p=0·45; 
figure 2B, C, D). The RRs for these three outcomes did not 
differ significantly between any subgroups of trials, 
including those for which use of surgery was or was not 
dependent on response to NACT, those using different 
types of chemotherapy, or those using or not using 
tamoxifen (figure 3 C–F and figure 4B, appendix pp 7, 13). 
Three trials8,9,16 collected only first recurrence and death 
rather than all events; however, sensitivity analyses 
omitting these trials had no material effect on distant 
recurrence estimates (appendix p 18). Mortality from 
causes other than breast cancer was no different between 
the 
NACT 
and 
adjuvant 
chemotherapy 
groups 
(appendix p 7).
Information about clinical tumour response was 
available for 1947 (82%) of 2387 patients allocated 
NACT; 546 (28%) of 1947 had a complete response, 
803 (41%) of 1947 had a partial response, and 
598 (31%) of 1947 had stable or progressive disease 
(table 2, appendix p 8). The clinical tumour response to 
NACT affected surgical treatment decisions: more 
women with a complete response had breast-conserving 
therapy (452 [83%] of 544) than did those with a partial 
response (541 [68%] of 799) or no response 
(246 [42%] of 588). Consequently, we noted an 
imbalance by treatment group in the extent of surgery: 
although 
breast-conserving 
therapy 
was 
initially 
intended for equal numbers of patients in each group, 
actual use of breast-preserving therapy (including no 
surgery) was 1504 (65%) of 2320 in the NACT group 
versus 1135 (49%) of 2318 in the adjuvant chemotherapy 
group excluding patients with unknown surgeries 
(p<0·0001; figure 1, appendix pp 9, 10).
Figure 6 shows proportions of women with complete 
clinical response according to patient and tumour 
characteristics. Complete response decreased with 
increasing clinical tumour size (trend p<0·0001) and was 
higher with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative biopsies 
than with ER-positive biopsies (p<0·0001) and with

poorly differentiated tumours than with well or 
moderately differentiated tumours (trend p=0·001, even 
after allowance for high-grade tumours tending to be ER 
negative), and was higher in the one trial13 that combined 
anthracycline and taxane therapy than in the other trials 
(p<0·0001). Age, nodal status, and planned local therapy 
did not affect response.
The proportion of women having breast-conserving 
therapy in various different subgroups in the NACT and 
adjuvant chemotherapy groups are shown in figure 1. 
The strongest predictors of the effect of NACT on breast 
conservation frequency were tumour size, planned local 
therapy, and type of chemotherapy (all p<0·0001). The 
effect of NACT on surgery de-escalation was most 
apparent among women with large (20–49 mm or 
≥50 mm) tumours; we noted little effect of NACT on 
breast conservation frequency in women with small 
(<20 mm) tumours. As expected, women with 
mastectomy originally planned were more likely to have 
lesser surgery than were those with breast-conserving

(A) Local recurrence. (B) Distant recurrence. Three trials recorded causes of any deaths but only the first breast cancer event. Hence, for these trials, distant recurrence includes the first distant recurrence 
as the first event and death from breast cancer. The appendix (pp 3–4) contains a full description of each trial’s chemotherapy regimen. A=doxorubicin (adriamycin). BCCA=British Columbia Cancer 
Agency. BCSG=Breast Cancer Study Group. C=cyclophosphamide. E=epirubicin. ECTO=European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer. EORTC=European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer. F=fluorouracil. Fol=folinic acid. IB=Institut Bergonié. M=methotrexate. Mit=mitomycin-C. Mz=mitoxantrone. NCI=National Cancer Institute. NSABP=National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and 
Bowel Project. O–E=observed minus expected. P=paclitaxel. Tt=thiotepa. Vc=vincristine. Vd=vindesine. *Chemotherapy regimens given preoperatively in those allocated neoadjuvant and 
postoperatively in those allocated adjuvant chemotherapy. The number of cycles, agents, and drug doses (in mg/m) per cycle are given. †The Austrian BCSG VII trial8 has two entries to take into 
account the two postoperative chemotherapies given to both randomised groups (appendix pp 3–4).

effect on local recurrence of allocation to NACT should be 
greatest in women for whom mastectomy was originally 
planned. 252 (33%) of 754 women converted from planned 
mastectomy to breast-conserving therapy. However, 
although the RR for local recurrence among all women 
planned to have a mastectomy was 1·66 (95% CI 1·24–2·21) 
compared with 1·14 (0·86–1·52) for women with 
lumpectomy planned, the two-tailed test for heterogeneity 
was not significant (p=0·07; figure 5, appendix pp 11, 12).
Heterogeneity between the RRs for local recurrence 
was lower across all other tumour characteristics than it 
was for RRs in the subgroup by planned local therapy 
(figure 5); although the p value for the trend in RR with 
biopsy grade was 0·05, this p value could have been a 
chance finding given that it was the most extreme from 
many subgroup analyses. Despite surgery de-escalation 
being more common in larger tumours than in smaller 
tumours, and in the trial combining anthracycline and 
taxane13 than in trials of other regimens, the proportional 
increases in local recurrence did not vary significantly by 
tumour size or chemotherapy regimen (figure 5). 
RRs also did not differ by age, nodal status, ER or

progesterone receptor status, or period of follow-up. 
Patient-level data for radiotherapy were not available, and 
trial-level data for radiotherapy intent and practice were 
incomplete (appendix p 2), so the effect of radiotherapy 
on local recurrence cannot be studied. Radiotherapy was 
scheduled for most women who had breast-conserving 
surgery and actual use of radiotherapy was more frequent 
in the NACT than in the adjuvant therapy groups 
(appendix p 2). The RRs for distant recurrence and breast 
cancer mortality did not vary by any tumour factor 
measured, type of chemotherapy, timing of chemotherapy 
use in the NACT group, type of planned local therapy, or 
period of follow-up (appendix p 13).
As expected, distant recurrence and breast cancer 
mortality 
were 
substantially 
lower 
in 
complete 
responders than in non-responders (appendix p 14). 
However, women who had a complete clinical response 
after NACT had a frequency of local recurrence similar to 
that of partial responders or non-responders. Ordering of 
trials by the percentage of patients with a complete 
clinical response to NACT did not reveal any significant 
trend of improved recurrence or breast cancer mortality 
RRs in trials with a higher frequency of response 
(appendix p 16). No patterns emerged between trials in 
complete response when considering the year that the 
trial started or the frequency of breast-conserving therapy 
within a trial (appendix p 15).
Discussion
In early breast cancer, high frequencies of complete or 
partial clinical response can be achieved with NACT, 
which can lead to a higher frequency of breast-conserving 
therapy than with adjuvant chemotherapy. However, we 
found NACT to be associated with a higher frequency of 
local recurrence than was the same chemotherapy 
started after surgery. Reassuringly, the increase in local 
recurrence was not associated with any significant 
increase in distant recurrence or breast cancer mortality.
More than two thirds of patients receiving NACT 
responded, with more than a quarter achieving complete 
clinical response, despite some trials using old 
chemotherapy regimens and four administering some of 
the chemotherapy postoperatively. The one regimen that 
included both anthracycline and taxane had the highest 
frequency of complete response. Within trials, response 
was more common in women with small, ER-negative 
and progesterone receptor-negative, or high-grade 
tumours, as measured before randomisation, but was 
little affected by age, nodal status, or planned local 
therapy.8–17 As expected, use of NACT was associated with 
an increase in the use of breast-conserving therapy.
An increase in the use of breast-conserving therapy in 
women who responded well to NACT and who would 
otherwise have had mastectomy is a likely explanation 
for the increase in local recurrence in patients allocated 
NACT. As anticipated,18,19 the absolute increase in local 
recurrence was greatest in the two trials14,15 in which 
surgery could be avoided completely in the event of a 
complete clinical response to NACT. This apparent 
heterogeneity of effect was, however, not significant, and 
NACT appeared to also have resulted in some increase in 
local recurrence in the aggregated results from the eight 
other trials. Hence, the increased local recurrence with 
NACT is not wholly explained by omission of surgery. 
Other unexamined factors might also have contributed to 
the increased local recurrence with NACT. For example, 
after NACT, tumour localisation can be difficult28 and 
response patterns can be heterogeneous,29 making 
surgery technically more difficult than without use of 
NACT. Differing use of radiotherapy or axillary surgery 
in the NACT group might also have contributed to 
the higher local recurrence, although patient-level 
information about this factor was not available. Trial 
reports indicate that radiotherapy was scheduled for 
most women who had breast-conserving surgery and 
that actual use of radiotherapy was, if anything, more 
frequent in the NACT than in the adjuvant therapy 
groups. Thus, lesser use of radiotherapy after NACT than 
that without NACT is unlikely to explain this increase in 
local recurrence. Indeed, even with radiotherapy, local 
failure is higher after breast-conserving surgery than 
after mastectomy without radiotherapy.30
Our finding of an overall increase in local recurrence in 
the trials using optimal local treatment is at odds with a 
meta-analysis18 based on published data rather than 
individual patient data, but this discrepancy could be 
because the meta-analysis included comparisons that were 
confounded by differing background systemic therapy.
Tumour response is predictive of lower distant 
recurrence and death than an absence of tumour response. 
Compared with all women randomly allocated to adjuvant 
chemotherapy, outcomes were better for those with a 
complete clinical response after NACT than for those with 
a partial response and far better than for those with little 
or no response to NACT. However, even in trials with high 
frequencies of complete response, NACT was not 
significantly better than adjuvant chemotherapy with 
respect to distant recurrence or breast cancer mortality. 
This finding could be because tumour characteristics that 
are associated with higher response—such as smaller 
tumour size—are also associated with lower distant 
recurrence and are balanced between the NACT and 
adjuvant groups by random 
isation. In each trial, both 
groups eventually receive the same chemotherapy, so any 
differences between trials in the efficacy of chemotherapy 
regimens will apply to both groups. The CTNeoBC study6 
reported similar findings in that efficacy as assessed by 
high pathological complete response at the trial level did 
not correlate well with long-term efficacy.
A limitation of our meta-analysis is that we have not 
been able to assess reliably whether presurgical systemic 
therapy is more effective at eradicating micrometastatic 
disease than the same chemotherapy administered after 
recovery from surgery because of the confounding

effect of differences in the extent of surgery between 
women allocated NACT and those allocated adjuvant 
chemotherapy. A large trial with the same surgery and 
radiotherapy in the NACT and adjuvant chemotherapy 
groups could assess this question. At present, we cannot 
exclude the possibility that NACT does moderately 
reduce distant recurrence compared with the same 
chemotherapy given postoperatively, but that this 
benefit was obscured by an increase in local recurrence 
due to less extensive surgery after NACT than in 
patients who did not receive NACT. Trials of radiotherapy 
after surgery indicate that substantially decreasing local 
recurrence does also decrease breast cancer mortality, 
with about one breast cancer death prevented for every 
four 
local 
recurrences 
prevented.30 
The 
small, 
non-significant excess of breast cancer mortality in 
patients allocated NACT is consistent with this risk 
ratio, so could therefore be due to the increase in local 
recurrence, but it could equally well be a chance finding.
The main aim of NACT in contemporary practice is to 
reduce the extent of breast surgery, thereby making 
breast conservation feasible in women who would 
otherwise need mastectomy. In the time since the trials 
in this meta-analysis were done, pathology reporting, 
surgery, and radiotherapy have improved, and more 
effective systemic neoadjuvant regimens have been 
introduced than were available when these trials took 
place. These changes should increase the likelihood of 
successful downstaging to allow conservative surgery in 
current and future practice. But, although improvements 
in treatment mean local recurrence risk should be lower 
than in these trials, our findings indicate that tumours 
downsized by NACT might continue to be associated 
with higher local recurrence risk after breast-conserving 
surgery than might tumours of the same dimensions 
in women who have not received NACT. Strategies 
to mitigate the increased local recurrence after 
breast-conserving therapy in tumours downsized by 
NACT should be considered—for example, careful 
tumour localisation, detailed pathological assessment, 
and appropriate radiotherapy.31 Prospective randomised 
trials would also help to establish the optimal clinical 
management in this context.
NACT allows more breast-conserving therapy than 
does adjuvant chemotherapy and provides information 
about an individual patient’s response to a particular 
chemotherapy regimen. However, it appears to be no 
better than postoperative adjuvant treatment at reducing 
breast cancer mortality and, perhaps as a consequence of 
a reduction of the extent of surgery, NACT is associated 
with moderately increased local recurrence risk, which 
persists for at least 10 years.
