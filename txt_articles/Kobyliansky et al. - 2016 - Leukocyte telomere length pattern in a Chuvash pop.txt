ABSTRACT
Background: To our knowledge, there are no experimental studies
that have addressed the effects of starvation on the maintenance of
telomere length. Two epidemiologic studies that have addressed this
topic gave controversial results.
Objective: We characterized leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in
a Chuvash population that was comprised of survivors of the mass
famine of 1922–1923 and in these survivors’ descendants.
Design: The tested cohort consisted of native Chuvash men
(n = 687) and women (n = 647) who were born between 1909 and
1980 and who resided in small villages in the Chuvash Republic of the
Russian Federation. Data were gathered during 3 expeditions undertaken
in 1994, 1999, and 2002. With the use of this method of gathering the
study cohort, we were able to treat age and birth year as independent
variables (i.e., after adjustment for age, we were able to analyze how
LTL correlates with a birth year in the interval between 1909 and 1980).
The DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes was used to measure the
telomere length with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique.
Results: The main observations were as follows: 1) there were
shorter leukocyte telomeres in men born after 1923 (i.e., after the
mass famine) than in men born before 1922 (i.e., before the mass
famine); 2) there was a stable inheritance of shorter telomeres by
men of ensuing generations; and 3) there was an absence of a cor-
relation between LTL and birth year in women.
Conclusions: Our study does not provide direct evidence for leu-
kocyte telomere shortening in famine survivors. However, the com-
parative analysis of LTL in the survivors and their descendants
suggests that such an effect did take place. The study also implies
that mass famine may be associated with telomere shortening in
male descendants of famine survivors. This observation is in agree-
ment with the “thrifty telomere hypothesis” predicting that longer
telomeres are disadvantageous in nutritionally marginal environ-
ments.

INTRODUCTION
Compelling evidence has been collected showing that in-
termittent or periodic fasting, such as caloric restriction, may
slow the aging process, increase the life span, and reduce the
incidences of several age-related diseases (1, 2). However, some
studies have shown that caloric restriction may not only extend
but also shorten the life span (3, 4).
To date, one of the mechanisms that has been suggested to
drive aging and determine the life span is associated with the
function of telomeres (5–7). Telomeres are special nucleoprotein
complexes that consist of repeats of the TTAGGG sequence
located at the ends of chromosomes (8). This sequence is re-
peated over several thousand base pairs in humans (9). Telo-
meres shorten with each mitotic cycle because the replication
machinery is unable to copy the absolute ends of DNA (8).
Evidence that has been accumulated to date has suggested that
there is a strong connection between telomere dynamics and the
processes that determine the life span (10). The data have also
suggested that leukocyte telomere length (LTL)7 might serve as
a biomarker of human aging (11) although the question as to
what extent this might be still remains disputable (5).
To our knowledge, there have been no previous experimental
studies that have addressed the effects of starvation on the
maintenance of telomere length. Two epidemiologic studies that
have addressed this topic have recently been published and gave
controversial results. The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study has
revealed no association between antenatal exposure to famine and
the shortening of telomeres in peripheral blood leukocytes in
individuals aged 68 y (12). However, such an association has been
observed in a study that addressed LTL in individuals who ex-
perienced starvation during the siege of Leningrad in 1941–1944
(13). A possible explanation that would eliminate the contra-
dictions in results of these studies is that starvation during the
siege of Leningrad was much more severe and lasted far longer

 than did starvation during the Dutch famine (14, 15). Never-
theless, the question of whether starvation affects LTL deserves
additional studies (16). In the current work, we evaluated LTL
in a Chuvash population–based sample that was comprised of
survivors of the mass famine of 1922–1923 and in the survivors’
descendants.
Chuvashia is a rural area in the mid-Volga region of Russia. In
1921–1922, mass famine started in many rural regions of Russia
(17). In Chuvashia, the number of starving people started to
grow in January 1922, and in late March, w90% of the total
population was starving and going as far as eating corpses and
dead animals (17). The situation began to change at the end of
April 1923, and in late 1923, it was reported that mass famine in
Chuvashia could be regarded as having been overcome (17).
This information and the fact that rural Chuvash people are
generally characterized by low mobility (18) have given us
a good reason to speculate that most rural Chuvash people who
were living in the 1990s and in the early 2000s were either in-
dividuals who survived the famine or their descendants.
METHODS
Design
This trial was a retrospective cohort study. The exposure was
the mass famine of 1922–1923 in Chuvashia, and the outcome
was age-adjusted LTL.
Sample
The population sampled in the current study were native
Chuvash people who were residing in numerous small villages in
the Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation. The Chuvash
people are genetically related to Caucasians (i.e., the population
of the Mediterranean and the Middle-East) and scarcely possess
any indications of the Central Asian-Altaic gene flow (19). A
rural population in this area is homogeneous in terms of ethnicity,
occupation, diet, and physical activity. Most participants shared
similar socioeconomic conditions with agriculture being their
principal source of livelihood. Families that live in this area have
lived under the same environmental conditions for generations
and have not been exposed to an outside genetic flow (20).
Data collection
We collected data from residents of a number of small villages
located in the Volga region. The data were gathered during 3
expeditions that were undertaken during August and September
1994, May and June 1999, and September 2002. This way of
gathering the study cohort allowed us to treat age and birth year as
2 independent variables (i.e., after adjustment for age, we were
able to analyze how LTL correlates with a birth year in the in-
terval between 1909 and 1980). The same team of investigators
collected all of the information and performed all measurements
in all 3 expeditions. Data were retrieved from 1325 individuals
who belonged to 410 nuclear families. Data that were obtained
from self-completed questionnaires and were confirmed during
the interview included sex and occupation. Age was verified by an
identification document. The visit involved collecting the blood
samples, anthropometric measures (e.g., weight and stature), and
an interview. BMI (in kg/m2) was computed as the ratio of
weight divided by the square of height. To collect data about
alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, participants were
asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire. Tradition-
ally, in the Chuvash population, only men smoke, but alcohol
consumption is common for men and women at approximately
the same rate. Only 42 of 262 individuals reported that they had
never used or had stopped using alcohol. The index of alcohol
consumption was constructed as follows: 1 = people who never
used or rarely used (n = 114), 2 = moderate drinkers (#500 mL
alcohol/wk) (n = 91), and 3 = heavy drinkers (.500 mL/wk)
(n = 15). To evaluate the influence of cigarette smoking, the
male population was also divided into 3 categories as follows:
1 = nonsmokers who never smoked or rarely smoked (n = 51),
2 = nonregular smokers (#10 cigarettes/d) (n = 33), and
3 = regular smokers (.10 cigarettes/d) (n = 43). Data on chronic
morbidity and medical treatment were obtained from partici-
pants’ medical records and were completed during the interview,
and only individuals who were not taking a medicine to treat
a chronic illness were included in the study. Subjects signed an
informed consent form, and every part of the project was ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of
Tel-Aviv University (on 14 October 1998, 28 June 2000, and 28
March 2002). All procedures involved were consensual, and all
measurements were carried out in accordance with the guide-
lines approved by the Ethics Committee.
Telomere length evaluation
DNA was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes as de-
scribed elsewhere (21). Telomere length was measured with the use
of a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)–based technique
(22) with the use of services of the Laboratory of DNA Analysis
headed by M Korner at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Briefly, the reference gene used was 36B4. Telomere and 36B4
qPCR assays were performed in separate plates. Primers that were
used to amplify the telomere repeats and the 36B4 gene were Tel1b
[CGGTTT(GTTTGG)5GTT], Tel2b [GGCTTG(CCTTAC)5CCT],
36B4u (CAGCAAGTGGGAAGGTGTAATCC), and 36B4d
(CCCATTCTATCATCAACGGGTACAA). DNA samples were am-
plified in a total reaction volume of 20 mL that contained DNA
(0.5 ng/mL), 13 Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems), DMSO (1%), 150 nM primer Tel1b and 450 nM
primer Tel2b. For 36B4 reactions, amounts of primers were
150 nM 36B4u and 259 nM 36B4d. All samples, for both telomere
and 36B4 amplifications, were analyzed in triplicate with the use of
the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) in
a 96-well format. The thermal-cycling profile for the telomere as-
say was as follows: 958C incubation for 10 min followed by
35 cycles at 958C for 15 s, at 548C for 1 min, and at 728C for 30 s.
For 36B4, the thermal cycling profile was as follows: 958C in-
cubation for 10 min followed by 35 cycles at 958C for 15 s, at 568C
for 2 min, and at 728C for 15 s. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
data were analyzed with the use of the StepOne Software (v2.2.2;
Applied Biosystems). Melting curves were obtained and analyzed
at the end of amplification.
Each PCR plate included a sample of a DNA calibrator (10
randomly chosen DNA samples that were pooled together) that
was used to construct a 4-point standard curve (one-half dilutions
that started at 20 ng and were run in triplicates). The amplification
efficiency (E) was estimated for each PCR plate (55 plates both

 for the telomere and 36B4 signals) from the slopes of the
standard curves according to

ð1Þ
The mean 6 SD E values for the telomere and 36B4 signals
were 1.96 6 0.02 and 1.99 6 0.02, respectively. The telomere
length ratio (T:S) was calculated for each sample by applying the
following equation:
T:S ¼ ðE telplateÞ 2 Ct ðtelomere sampleÞ
ðE 36B4plateÞ 2 Ct ð36B4 sampleÞ O
ðE telplateÞ 2 Ct ðcalibrator sampleÞ
ðE 36B4plateÞ 2 Ct ðcalibrator sampleÞ
ð2Þ
where Ct is the threshold-cycle value.
The qPCR results were checked for whether there was an
outlier in a triplet if the CVof the Ct was .1%. If the removal of
a single outlier did not improve the CV of the replicate Cts for
a sample (CV #1%), the assay was repeated.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed with the use of
STATISTICA 7.1 software (StatSoft Inc.). Descriptive statistics
were used to characterize the study sample. Continuous piecewise
linear functions were used to model LTL dependence on age. This
model enabled the whole age interval to be divided into smaller
intervals with a constant rate of changes. The variables of max-
imum likelihood estimation were linear coefficients and positions
of interval borders (inflection points). Thus, e.g., the difference in
the df between a 1-interval linear model and a 2-interval linear
model is 2. We could find the most parsimonious model by
comparing models with a different number of intervals with the use
of a likelihood ratio test, as implemented in the statistical package
MAN (Tel Aviv University, 2013) (23). With the use of the most
parsimonious model, LTL phenotypes were adjusted for age in men
and women separately, and the standardized residuals [age-adjusted
and standardized leukocyte telomere length (LTLas)] were used in
further analyses. Similarly, multi-interval linear models were used
to estimate the dependence between LTLas and the birth year.
Pairwise familial correlations of LTLas for spouses (rsp),
parent-offspring (rpo), and siblings (rsib), were estimated with
the use of the MAN package. On the basis of these estimates, the
maximal heritability of LTL (H2) was calculated by applying the
following equation (21):
H2 ¼

A statistical comparison of LTLas between birth cohorts was per-
formed with the use of Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction.
The 2-tailed level of significance of differences was set at 0.0125.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics of the studied sample are provided in
Table 1. The mean 6 SD age in men (n = 678) was 47.9 6 0.66 y,
and in women (n = 647), it was 47.9 6 0.67 y. There was a strong
sex difference in LTL values (P , 0.0001) with the mean LTL in
men equal to 0.997, and in women, it was 0.917.
First, we checked how LTL in men and women was correlated
with BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption. No correlation
between BMI (r = 0.011, P = 0.787 for men; r = 0.019, P = 0.642
for women), smoking (r = 20.111, P = 0.092), alcohol con-
sumption (r = 0.007, P = 0.918 for men; r = 20.044, P = 0.533
for women), and LTL was observed.
We estimated the dependence between birth year and LTLas. In
men, in sets of regression models (linear and polynomial), the bi-
interval linear model was shown to be significant compared with
the simple linear regression model for LTLas (x2 = 11.43, df = 2,
P = 0.003). This bi-interval linear model was shown to be the
most parsimonious one in the multi-interval linear models. The
model showed an inflection point at the birth year 1922 with
a 95% CI for this point being of w1 y (Figure 1). This model
suggested that the famine of 1922–1923 might have influenced
telomere length in men. At the same time, no correlation between
birth year and LTL was observed in women (data not presented),
which suggested that their telomere lengths were not influenced
by the famine. We tested these suggestions by comparing LTLas
in 4 birth cohorts of men and women. The first cohort was
composed of individuals who were born in 1909–1921 [i.e., be-
fore the famine and, hence, exposed to the famine during child-
hood (children ranging from 1 to 13 y of age)]. The second cohort
was composed of individuals who were born in 1922–1923 (i.e.,
during the famine). The third cohort included individuals who
were born in 1924–1928 (i.e., after the famine). Such a time in-
terval allowed for the assumption that the parents of these in-
dividuals were exposed to the famine during reproductive ages.
Finally, the fourth cohort included individuals born after 1928.
We observed (Table 2) that telomeres in men born before the
famine (group 1) were significantly longer than in men who
were born after the famine (groups 3 and 4). Also, the shortest
telomeres were registered in men who were born shortly after
the famine (in 1924–1928; group 3), and the cohort of men who
were born after 1928 (group 4) had telomeres that were signif-
icantly longer than those in individuals in group 3 but shorter
than those in individuals in group 1. Finally, in men who were
born during the period of mass famine (1922–1923; group 2),
telomeres were seemingly shorter than in men in group 1
(P = 0.045), but the differences did not reach multiple-testing–
adjusted significance (P # 0.0125). At the same time, as we
expected, no difference in telomere length was observed in women
of the tested groups. Thus, the data characterizing LTL in birth-
year groups corresponded to the model depicting the correlation
of LTL with birth year in men (Figure 1) and the absence of
correlation with birth year in women.
Finally, we estimated family correlations and the heritability of
LTL (Table 3). Familial correlations were significant for all

tested cohort was estimated to be 0.63.
DISCUSSION
In a recent case-control study (13), LTL shortening had been
registered in individuals who survived the mass famine during the
siege of Leningrad in 1941–1944. The mechanisms underlying
this effect remain undefined. However, telomere shortening in
individuals who experienced starvation seemed to be explain-
able by the results of experimental studies that addressed the
mechanisms that determined the response to calorie restric-
tion and fasting. Indeed, the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that belongs to the phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase–related kinase family (24), and the in-
hibition of mTOR signaling has recently been suggested to be
one of the key molecular events among those induced by caloric
restriction and fasting (1, 2). What is pivotal in the context of the
discussion is the recent evidence that has shown that starvation
signals led to shorter telomeres in yeast and that this effect was
brought about via the inhibition of TOR signaling (25–27).
Because the function of mTOR is highly conserved (28), it
seems possible, although clearly speculative, to suggest that

simple linear regression model (x2 = 11.43, df = 2, P = 0.003). The point at year 1922 (dashed line) separating the 2 time intervals was optimal according to
the LH-ratio test. R denotes a value that was used to calculate the multiple regression coefficient (R2), which describes the proportion of explained variance.
Twenty-two men who were born before 1922 were tested. However, in 2 men who were born in 1917 (x axis), LTLas was shown to be practically identical at
0.773252 and 0.801081 (y axis). Therefore, their data points overlap. LH, maximum likelihood; LTL, leukocyte telomere length; LTLas, age-adjusted and

TELOMERE LENGTH IN POPULATION EXPOSED TO FAMINE
1413
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/104/5/1410/4564404 by guest on 03 June 2019
 there is the existence of an mTOR-controlled pathway through
which starvation can decrease telomere length in humans.
We observed (Table 2) that men who were born before the
famine (i.e., in 1909–1921) and were exposed to famine during
childhood exhibited longer telomeres than those of men who
were born shortly after the famine (i.e., born in 1924–1928).
One of the plausible explanations is that individuals who were
born in 1909–1921 starved during childhood but had parents
who were not exposed to the famine. By contrast, individuals
who were born in 1924–1928 did not starve but had parents who
were exposed to the famine during adulthood. LTL is sub-
stantially heritable with heritability ranging between 36% and
82% (29). In the population tested here, LTL heritability was
estimated at 63%. Furthermore, LTL at birth has been suggested
to be the main determinant of LTL throughout the human life
course (30). Therefore, it is conceivable that shorter telomeres in
nonstarved individuals who were born in 1924–1928 resulted
from starvation-induced telomere shortening in their parents.
Such a scenario assumes that famine had a stronger effect on
telomere length in reproductive cells of adults (parents) than in
leukocytes of children (individuals who were born in 1909–1921).
To our knowledge, there have been no studies that have addressed
this point. However, it seems that such a possibility cannot be
excluded if it is assumed that, in adults, mass famine has been
accompanied by a strong psychological stress, which has also
been shown to be associated with telomere shortening (31).
Another phenomenon that we observed in our study was that,
in unstarved men who were born during the period from 1929
to the early 1980s, telomeres were longer than in unstarved
men who were born in 1924–1928 but were significantly shorter
than in men who were born before the mass famine. However,
persistent short telomeres in men who were born after the
mass famine may not represent a simple heritable genetic trait.
A similar effect, except that it was not sex specific, was re-
cently observed in an experimental study in telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) heterozygous mice (32). In the study,
TERT+/2 mice were crossbred through 17 generations to obtain
a progressive telomere length shortening. The late-generation
TERT+/2 mice were intercrossed to produce genotypically
wild-type TERT+/+ mice for which telomere length was
characterized. It was observed that telomere length in TERT+/+
offspring was not longer than that of their TERT+/2 parents.
Moreover, when successive crosses were carried out in these
short-telomere TERT+/+ offspring, telomere length stayed
stable with no elongation for up to 6 generations. The authors
suggested that the species-specific set point for telomere
length is not determined by genotype alone but reflects his-
toric stressful events. This explanation is in agreement with
the “thrifty telomere hypothesis” (33), which states that
telomeres are important life-history markers that deter-
mine how much to invest in maintenance efforts over the life
course, particularly in rapidly proliferating tissues with high-
maintenance requirements. In the framework of this hypothesis,
inheriting longer telomeres is predicted to be disadvantageous
in nutritionally marginal environments (33). Our study, which
showed that there was shorter LTL in descendants of in-
dividuals who experienced severe starvation, conforms to the
hypothesis.
Finally, in the tested cohort, LTL in men was higher than in
women. This observation contradicts evidence that has been
collected to date that male mammals tend to have shorter telo-
meres than do female (10). The reasons for this discrepancy
remain unclear. However, in our earlier study in which we
addressed reproductive indexes in the same Chuvash population
(34), we observed that the girls’ mean age at menarche increased
from 15.4 y in the 1910s to 16.5 y in the 1930s and gradually
decreased to 14.0 y in the 1980s. Estrogen deficiency has been
implicated in the etiology of delayed menarche (35). Because
estrogen is the central mechanism that maintains telomere ho-
meostasis in women (10), it is conceivable that the Chuvash
women of the tested cohort might have had shorter telomeres
than those women of other populations.
Several limitations of this study have to be mentioned. First, our
study design was a retrospective cohort, which did not allow us to
obtain direct evidence of the effects of starvation on LTL of tested
individuals. Second, the tested population consisted of a small
number of individuals who survived mass famine. Nevertheless, the
results of our study seemingly support those of an earlier study (13)
that showed that famine may be a factor with a potential to induce
telomere shortening. Third, the observation that men but not women
exhibited changes in telomere length homeostasis was unexpected.
However, as previously mentioned, there is evidence that mTOR
inhibition may be a key event in a pathway whereby starvation
signals may induce telomere shortening. It has recently been shown
that life-span extension induced by the inhibition of mTOR activity
is a sex-dependent phenomenon (36). This observation implies that
mTOR may also control telomere length in a sex-dependent manner.
Fourth, markers of oxidation, inflammation, and glucose metabolism
were not available in the studied Chuvash sample. However, we
estimated the relation between LTL and BMI, which is a proxy for
both systemic inflammation and glucose metabolism, and showed no
correlation with BMI.
In conclusion, our study does not provide direct evidence for
leukocyte telomere shortening in famine survivors. However, the
comparative analysis of LTL in the survivors and their de-
scendants suggests that such an effect did take place. The study
also implies that mass famine may be associated with telomere
shortening in male descendants of famine survivors. The fact that
mass famines are on the wane (37) in no way means that studies
addressing this topic have lost actuality. On the contrary, the
world still faces the large and familiar problems of widespread
hunger and malnutrition. Because the term “hunger” may rep-
resent any part of the continuum of which the upper end is
famine, whereas malnutrition may be seen as a slow-burning
famine, it is conceivable that some individuals in a population
experiencing hunger or malnutrition will starve (37). Therefore,
experimental studies addressing long-term biological conse-
quences of starvation are warranted.

 The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—EK and DK: designed the
research and critically reviewed the manuscript; DT: developed a custom
program that collected PCR results and computed the relative telomere
length; and LK: performed the statistical analysis, analyzed the data, and
wrote the manuscript. None of the authors reported a conflict of interest
related to the study.
