Laboratory Diagnosis of Zika Virus Infection
Marie Louise Landry, MD; Kirsten St. George, PhD
� Context.—The rapid and accurate diagnosis of Zika virus
infection is an international priority.
Objective.—To review current recommendations, meth-
ods, limitations, and priorities for Zika virus testing.
Data Sources.—Sources include published literature,
public health recommendations, laboratory procedures,
and testing experience.
Conclusions.—Until recently, the laboratory diagnosis of
Zika infection was confined to public health or research
laboratories that prepared their own reagents, and test
capacity has been limited. Furthermore, Zika cross-reacts
serologically with other flaviviruses, such as dengue, West
Nile, and yellow fever. Current or past infection, or even
vaccination with another flavivirus, will often cause false-
positive or uninterpretable Zika serology results. Detection
of viral RNA during acute infection using nucleic acid
amplification tests provides more specific results, and a
number of commercial nucleic acid amplification tests
have received emergency use authorization. In addition to
serum, testing of whole blood and urine is recommended
because of the higher vial loads and longer duration of
shedding. However, nucleic acid amplification testing has
limited utility because many patients are asymptomatic or
present for testing after the brief period of Zika shedding
has passed. Thus, the greatest need and most difficult
challenge is development of accurate antibody tests for the
diagnosis of recent Zika infection. Research is urgently
needed to identify Zika virus epitopes that do not cross-
react with other flavivirus antigens. New information is
emerging at a rapid pace and, with ongoing public-private
and international collaborations and government support,
it is hoped that rapid progress will be made in developing
robust and widely applicable diagnostic tools.

Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus discovered
in 1947 in primates in the Zika Forest of Uganda during
surveillance for yellow fever.1 The virus was identified in
association with relatively small clusters of human infections
until 2007, when it caused an outbreak in Yap State,
Micronesia, that affected three-quarters of the population.2
In 2013, a larger ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia
occurred,3,4 associated with cases of Guillain-Barr´
e syn-
drome (GBS).5,6 However, when a 20-fold increase in
microcephaly was linked to a ZIKV epidemic in Brazil in
2015, the virus suddenly came to international attention.7–9
In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared
the Zika epidemic a public health emergency of interna-
tional concern and identified the development of reliable
and accessible diagnostic tests a priority. In this brief review,
the current status of laboratory testing, including recom-
mended sample types, methods, result interpretation, and
laboratory safety issues, will be discussed. This is a rapidly
developing field, and the reader is advised to regularly
consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) Web site or his or her state health department for the
most up-to-date recommendations.
LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS
Until recently, the laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infection
was limited to public health or research laboratories that
prepared
their
own
reagents.
This
limited
diagnostic
capacity created the need for prioritization of testing, with
the highest priority given to pregnant women.
In addition to limited test availability, the laboratory
diagnosis of ZIKV presents a number of other challenges.
The virus cross-reacts serologically with other flaviviruses,
such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, and yellow
fever virus (Table 1). Thus, current or past infection, or even
vaccination with another flavivirus, will often cause false-
positive or uninterpretable antibody results. The 2007
outbreak in Micronesia was initially identified as DENV by
a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig) M test. However, the Yap State
Department of Health suspected a different pathogen and
requested the assistance of the CDC, which subsequently
identified ZIKV.2
Detection of viral RNA during acute infection by reverse
transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other
nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provides more
specific results, but ZIKV is detectable only briefly during
acute illness.10 Furthermore, the utility of molecular testing
for the diagnosis of acute infection is limited, because 80%
of patients have no symptoms to alert the patient or the

 clinician to infection, and therefore no frame of reference for
onset date. With these limitations in mind, the approach to
laboratory testing is discussed below and summarized in
Tables 2 and 3.
Acute Infection
Zika virus RNA may be detectable in serum for several
days prior to, as well as several days after, symptom onset.11
Very recently, the testing of whole blood has been reported
to provide more prolonged detection of viremia, however,
more studies are needed to confirm the advantages of
testing this sample type.36 In contrast, ZIKV IgM antibody
begins to appear 4 to 7 days after onset of illness and
persists for approximately 12 weeks.10 Neutralizing anti-
bodies, detected by plaque reduction neutralization tests

b Positive ZIKV IgM result may be due to cross-reactive antibodies from infection with DENV or a pathogen other than ZIKV. Confirmatory PRNT is
required for all ZIKV IgM–positive samples. However, PRNT results can be difficult to interpret and may not always distinguish recent from past
ZIKV infection, or distinguish ZIKV from other flavivirus or multiflavivirus infections.

 (PRNTs), become detectable concurrently with IgM but
persist for years. Although virus in serum declines as
antibodies appear, ZIKV is shed in urine for longer, from 7
to 14 or more days after onset, and is usually at higher titer
in urine than in serum.12–14 Thus, molecular testing of urine
in addition to serum is strongly recommended. Virus can
also be detected in saliva, where it also tends to be shed for
longer and at higher titer than in serum.15 However, in
studies where all 3 sample types were collected, testing
saliva did not provide additional benefit above serum and
urine.14 Additionally, saliva has been found to be a less
consistent sample type than urine, with a higher incidence
of processing issues. The additional collection and testing of
saliva is therefore not routinely recommended.
For patients with symptomatic disease, serum, whole
blood, and urine should be submitted for molecular testing
(usually by real-time RT-PCR) as soon as possible after
onset of symptoms, preferably within the first few days.
Different laboratories have varying time limits for the
application of molecular ZIKV tests, ranging from within 7
to within 28 days following the onset of symptoms. For all
negative tests, serum should be automatically reflexed for
IgM testing. If serology is also negative, IgM testing should
be repeated on a later serum sample because it may be too
early to detect IgM. The rash illness of ZIKV can be
indistinguishable from that of DENV and Chikungunya
virus (CHIKV); thus, testing for all 3 viruses in acute
symptomatic cases may be a consideration if infection
occurred in an area where they were cocirculating.
Reports on prolonged ZIKV viremia in pregnant women16
have prompted the recommendation for laboratories to lift
their usual time restrictions for molecular testing on
pregnant patients.17 Zika virus has also been detected in
breast milk18 and in semen.19–21 Transmission via semen has
been shown to occur as a consequence of oral, vaginal, and
anal sex, before, during, and after onset of symptoms.22
Male-to-female, female-to-male, and male-to-male cases of
sexual transmission have been reported, and both the
detection of virus in semen and delayed transmission23
suggest that semen secretion can be ongoing for weeks to
months after infection. Although ZIKV RNA can be detected
in semen by RT-PCR, it is not a routinely performed test and
is not recommended for assessing infectivity.
Recent Exposure
Because 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic and the
virus is only transiently detectable in blood/serum and urine,
diagnosis with RT-PCR is often not possible. However, IgM
is reliably detected from approximately 2 to 12 weeks after
exposure. Thus, the screening test of choice for recent
subclinical infection is ZIKV IgM class capture enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA). In the event of
a positive or equivocal ZIKV MAC-ELISA screen, more
specific serologic testing by PRNT is required to compare
neutralizing antibody titers to ZIKV and other flavivruses.10
Serologic cross-reactivity to other flaviviruses can be seen
with the initial primary flavivirus infection, but titers to the
infecting virus are usually higher. In contrast, when prior
flavivirus infection or vaccination has occurred, the anam-
nestic response can yield high or higher titers to the
previous virus, leading to uninterpretable or confusing
results.
Congenital Infection of the Fetus
The primary means of detecting risk to the fetus is testing
of the mother. Where testing indicates a woman has been
infected during pregnancy, fetal ultrasound should be used
to monitor for developing abnormalities, including micro-
cephaly, disrupted brain development, intracranial calcifica-
tions and eye abnormalities, intrauterine grown restriction,
and limb abnormalities.24 Amniotic fluid has been reported
as positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR in some pregnancies with
affected fetuses.25–27 However, the role of amniotic fluid
testing in diagnosing ZIKV infection or disease in the fetus
is not well defined because of the lack of data on sensitivity,
optimal timing of testing, and predictive value of a positive
result for clinical disease.
Congenital Infection of the Infant at Birth
When an infant is born to a mother with known or
suspected ZIKV infection, infant serum, whole blood,
placental tissue, umbilical cord, and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) if obtained for another reason, should be sent for
ZIKV IgM, RT-PCR, and histopathology, as appropriate.
Importantly, several pieces of tissue should be sampled from
various areas of both the fetal and maternal sides of the
placenta for molecular testing.
Postmortem in the Fetus or Infant
For the diagnosis of ZIKV, both fresh and formalin-fixed
tissues should be collected for molecular testing, histopa-
thology, and immunohistochemical staining. Brain tissue
should be carefully sampled, making every effort to
maintain the brain architecture in order to evaluate
neuropathology. Placenta should be sampled extensively,
including any pathologic lesions. Samples of individual
organs should be submitted, including heart, lungs, liver,
kidneys, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, bone marrow, and
eyes, as well as blood and body fluids if available.
Photographs of grossly observed fetal malformations and
organ abnormalities should be prepared, if feasible.

 Neurologic Syndromes
In cases of suspected or diagnosed ZIKV infection
exhibiting acute meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis, sam-
ples of CSF, blood, and urine should be submitted for
molecular testing and serology. For postinfectious syn-
dromes, including GBS, virus may no longer be detectable.
However, blood/serum, urine, and CSF should still be
submitted for RT-PCR, and serum and CSF submitted for
serology.
Past Infection
Currently, IgG testing is not routinely available at public
health laboratories, where the focus is on the detection of
acute illness or recent infection. Although IgM may persist
for several months, detection is only reliable for 12 weeks
following onset of symptoms. Thus, there is a potential role
for IgG avidity testing to extend the detection of recent
infection. An accurate IgG test would also be useful for
population studies of seroprevalence and protection. Un-
fortunately, serologic cross-reactivity presents even more
issues for IgG testing because of the longevity of potentially
cross-reactive antibodies.
Blood Donor Testing
Retrospective testing of samples collected during the 2013
to 2014 outbreak in French Polynesia revealed 2.8% of blood
donors were positive for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR,11 and
transmission of ZIKV by blood products from an asymp-
tomatic, acutely infected donor has recently been docu-
mented in Brazil.28 Thus, the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) recommended in February 2016 that
in areas with ongoing local transmission of ZIKV, blood
collection cease unless screening by NAAT could be
implemented. In addition, in areas where local transmission
was not occurring, the following strategies were initiated:
donor deferral for 4 weeks based on travel to or residence in
areas with local ZIKV transmission, or sexual contact with
at-risk persons. However, many blood collectors, including
the Red Cross, began proactively using investigational
NAATs. On August 26, 2016, the FDA issued revised
guidance, recommending that all donations collected in the
United States and its territories be tested for ZIKV, or be
treated with an FDA-approved pathogen reduction device if
available. Currently there are two investigational NAAT
ZIKV assays available for testing donated blood. Addition-
ally, licensed pathogen reduction technologies are available
for plasma and platelets. For the most up-to-date informa-
tion, consult the CDC Web site: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/
transmission/blood-transfusion.html.
TEST METHODS
Zika virus testing for clinical purposes in the United States
must be performed using assays and reagents that have
been validated and approved by the CDC, or those that have
emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA. Because of
the potential consequences of positive test results on
decisions regarding termination of pregnancy, laboratory-
developed tests cannot be offered without the submission of
assay validation data to the FDA and the subsequent EUA
for their use. To aid in the development of test kits by
commercial companies,
the
FDA has
ZIKV reference
material available for validation studies. More information
is available at the FDA Web site at http://www.fda.gov/
downloads/EmergencyPreparedness/Counterterrorism/
MedicalCountermeasures/MCMIssues/UCM507010.pdf.
Additionally, the CDC is developing panels of sera from
patients who have had recent ZIKV infection, to assist with
the development of commercial serology assays.
Clinical test methods currently rely most prominently on
the detection of IgM, neutralizing antibody, or the detection
of viral RNA by NAAT (Table 4). Virus isolation for ZIKV is
performed by very few laboratories and has been difficult to
achieve from most primary clinical specimens. Diagnosis by
histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and electron mi-
croscopy of tissue is covered in a separate article in this
issue.
Antibody Response
Although serology is the most commonly applied
method for diagnosing both recent and past infections,
current antibody tests suffer from extensive cross-reac-
tivity due to the substantial sequence and structural
homology between the surface proteins of ZIKV and other
flaviviruses, particularly DENV. A study of 9 Thai patients
with documented recent DENV infections found all sera
were cross-reactive with ZIKV, including when tested
using neutralization tests, in the absence of current or
prior ZIKV infection.29 Because ZIKV is circulating in
countries with transmission of dengue viruses and also
where yellow fever or dengue vaccines are commonly
administered, the inability to reliably differentiate flavivi-
rus antibody responses is a serious impediment to
accurate diagnosis and surveillance. Thus, a high priority
in research and test development is identifying unique
epitopes for each virus in order to develop more specific
diagnostic tests.
MAC-ELISA Testing.—A MAC-ELISA developed at the
CDC Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory at Fort Collins,
Colorado, has been given EUA by the FDA and is provided
to US public health laboratories for diagnostic testing. The
MAC-ELISA is used for the qualitative detection of ZIKV
IgM antibodies in serum or CSF. Cerebrospinal fluid can
only be tested alongside a patient-matched serum speci-
men. Zika virus IgM is usually detectable by day 4 following
onset of illness and persists for 12 or more weeks following
initial infection. If a positive or equivocal result is obtained,
additional testing using PRNT must be performed by the
CDC or a CDC-designated laboratory for confirmation.
Negative MAC-ELISA results from samples collected in the
appropriate window have a strong negative predictive value
for recent ZIKV infection. However samples collected very
early in the course of infection should be also tested by RT-
PCR, and if negative, a convalescent serum should be
submitted.
In its current format the MAC-ELISA is a very labor-
intensive test, requiring the on-site preparation of 96-well
reaction plates coated with anti-human IgM. Following
incubation with diluted specimen, they are then reacted
with CDC-provided ZIKV culture lysate, recombinant
antigen, or uninfected cell culture lysate for background
determination. Subsequent incubation with a flavivirus
chimeric monoclonal antibody is then followed by a color
reaction. Each component of the MAC-ELISA must be
standardized and validated prior to use in the laboratory,
and restandardized when new lot numbers of reagents are
introduced. For test specimens, a screening dilution of 1:400
is used, and testing of the sample against the uninfected
antigen must fall within an acceptable range. Results are

 interpreted based on the ratio of color intensity in the ZIKV-
positive antigen well (P) and that in the control well (N).
Specimens with P/N values of greater than or equal to 3.0
are reported as ‘‘presumptive Zika IgM positive’’ and are
forwarded to the CDC or an approved laboratory for
confirmatory testing with PRNT. P/N values between 2.0
and 3.0 are considered equivocal, and further tests (RT-PCR
and/or PRNT, or collection of a convalescent serum sample)
should be performed. The most common cause of false-
positive results is cross-reactivity with antibodies to other
flaviviruses, especially DENV. However, IgM assays can be
false positive for other reasons as well.30
Although Zika IgG ELISA and avidity testing would be
useful additions to the diagnostic tools, reliable assays are
not yet available.
Neutralizing Antibody.—For more definitive results,
MAC-ELISA–positive or equivocal samples are tested for
neutralizing antibody by PRNT. In this method, serial
dilutions of patient serum are incubated for an hour at
room temperature with a standard challenge dose of
infectious virus to allow virus-specific antibody, if present,
to bind the virus. The serum-virus mixtures are then
inoculated onto cell culture monolayers, allowed to adsorb,
then overlaid with a semisolid medium. After a defined
incubation period, monolayers are fixed and stained, and
virus-induced plaques are enumerated (Figure). If neutral-
izing antibody is present, infectious virus will be neutralized,
and the number of plaques will be reduced. The end point is
defined as the dilution of serum that results in a 90%
reduction in viral plaques. In addition to ZIKV, tests for
antibodies to other cocirculating flaviviruses, or vaccine
viruses if the patient has been vaccinated, should be
performed, and results compared. The entire process can
take 3 to 4 weeks.
Result interpretation for ZIKV serology tests is complex.
Guidelines have been published in the Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report.31
Nucleic Acid Detection
Zika virus is an RNA virus, and a number of conventional
and real-time RT-PCR tests have been published in the
literature and reviewed elsewhere.32,33 Possibly one of the
most extensively used tests was a real-time assay devel-
oped by the CDC in response to the Yap State outbreak.10
As originally described, it incorporates reactions targeting
the premembrane and envelope genes of the virus. In a
protocol subsequently distributed by the CDC in 2016 to
public health laboratories, the premembrane assay was

 replaced with one for the NS2B gene. The envelope gene
assay is currently incorporated in the Trioplex assay, a
multiplex assay developed at the CDC for the detection of
ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV that has been given EUA by the
FDA.
Although there have been very few comparative clinical
studies of the performance of different ZIKV conventional
and real-time RT-PCR assays, a multiplex RT-PCR for ZIKV,
CHIKV, and DENV evaluated in clinical trials in Nicaragua
was recently found to be more sensitive for ZIKV detection
than the single-plex CDC ZIKV envelope gene assay.34
A number of commercial NAAT tests have now been
given EUA for clinical use by the FDA (Table 5). Many more
are in various stages of development and approval,
including some that can be performed on highly simplified
platforms. Allowance has been made for the use of
investigational tests to screen blood donations for ZIKV,
and the FDA has created reference materials to assist with
the development and validation of NAATs.
Virus Isolation
Although established cultures of ZIKV grow well in LLC-
MK2 cells, Vero E6 cells, and others, producing plaques in a
week or less as well as in suckling mice,35 the virus has been
very difficult to isolate from primary specimens. This is
believed to be due at least in part to the almost universally
low to very low viral loads in clinical specimens. In practice,
culture methods are reserved for specialized reference
laboratories, because RT-PCR and other molecular methods
are more sensitive, rapid, and avoid the biohazards of
working with infectious virus.
LABORATORY SAFETY
Samples collected from patients with suspected arbovirus
infections may contain high titers of potentially hazardous
viruses, especially CHIKV, and should be handled with
appropriate precautions. Serum and CSF samples should be
heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 568C prior to serologic
testing. Samples that may contain CHIKV should be
inactivated for 2 hours, because of the possibility of very
high CHIKV titers in blood.
The biosafety level classification of ZIKV varies in different
countries. In the United States, molecular and serologic
procedures can be performed in BSL-2 facilities with BSL-3
practices. All manipulations should be performed within a
Class II or higher biologic safety cabinet, and pregnant
women should be excluded from working with potentially
ZIKV-positive samples.
Samples tested by molecular methods are routinely added
to lysis buffer for nucleic acid extraction, and molecular lysis
buffers are variable in their viral inactivation properties.
Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that either the
method being used is one that completely inactivates virus,
or that lysed samples are being handled with an assumption
of the ongoing presence of live virus. Virus isolation should
only be attempted in experienced arbovirus reference
laboratories, and ZIKV cultures should not be handled by
pregnant women.
CONCLUSIONS
The rapid and accurate diagnosis of ZIKV infection is an
international priority. Recently, a number of commercial
NAAT tests have received EUA for clinical diagnostic use
from the FDA. Although this has expanded the availability
of ZIKV diagnostic services and alleviated some of the
testing burden on public health laboratories, NAAT has
limited utility in ZIKV diagnosis because most patients are
either asymptomatic or present for testing after the brief
period of likely viral shedding.
The greatest need and most difficult challenge is the
development of commercially available antibody tests for
the specific and sensitive diagnosis of recent ZIKV infection.
Research is urgently needed to identify ZIKV epitopes that
do not cross-react with other flavivirus antigens. New
information is emerging at a rapid pace, and with ongoing
public-private and international collaborations as well as
government support, it is hoped that rapid progress will be
Plaque reduction neutralization test of acute (A) and convalescent (B)
patient sera against Zika virus (ZIKV). Serial dilutions of patient serum
were each incubated with 100 plaque-forming units of ZIKV for 1 hour
at room temperature, then the serum-virus mixtures were inoculated
onto Vero monolayers. Following an incubation of several days,
cultures were fixed and stained, and virus-induced plaques were
enumerated. Plaque counts lower than 10 were considered negative.
In the examples shown here, the titers for both acute and convalescent
sera are 1:160, indicating exposure to ZIKV, but the timing of exposure
is inconclusive.
