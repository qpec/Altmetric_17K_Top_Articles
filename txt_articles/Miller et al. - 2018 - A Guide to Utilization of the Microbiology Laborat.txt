The critical nature of the microbiology laboratory in infectious disease diagnosis calls for a close, positive working relationship between 
the physician/advanced practice provider and the microbiologists who provide enormous value to the healthcare team. This document, 
developed by experts in laboratory and adult and pediatric clinical medicine, provides information on which tests are valuable and in 
which contexts, and on tests that add little or no value for diagnostic decisions. This document presents a system-based approach rather 
than specimen-based approach, and includes bloodstream and cardiovascular system infections, central nervous system infections, 
ocular infections, soft tissue infections of the head and neck, upper and lower respiratory infections, infections of the gastrointestinal 
tract, intra-abdominal infections, bone and joint infections, urinary tract infections, genital infections, and other skin and soft tissue 
infections; or into etiologic agent groups, including arthropod-borne infections, viral syndromes, and blood and tissue parasite infec-
tions. Each section contains introductory concepts, a summary of key points, and detailed tables that list suspected agents; the most 
reliable tests to order; the samples (and volumes) to collect in order of preference; specimen transport devices, procedures, times, and 
temperatures; and detailed notes on specific issues regarding the test methods, such as when tests are likely to require a specialized 
laboratory or have prolonged turnaround times. In addition, the pediatric needs of specimen management are also emphasized. There 
is intentional redundancy among the tables and sections, as many agents and assay choices overlap. The document is intended to serve 
as a guidance for physicians in choosing tests that will aid them to quickly and accurately diagnose infectious diseases in their patients.
Keywords.  specimen management; clinical relevance; specimen collection; clinical correlation; microbiology specimens.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
Unlike other areas of the diagnostic laboratory, clinical microbi-
ology is a science of interpretive judgment that is becoming more 
complex, not less. Even with the advent of laboratory automation 
and the integration of genomics and proteomics in microbiology, 
interpretation of results still depends on the quality of the speci-
mens received for analysis whether one is suspecting a prokaryote 
or a eukaryote as the etiologic agent, both of which are featured 
in this document. Microbes tend to be uniquely suited to adapt 
to environments where antibiotics and host responses apply pres-
sures that encourage their survival. A laboratory instrument may 
or may not detect those mutations, which can present a challenge 
to clinical interpretation. Clearly, microbes grow, multiply, and die 
very quickly. If any of those events occur during the preanalytical 
specimen management processes, the results of analysis will be 
compromised and interpretation could be misleading.
Physicians and other advanced practice providers need con-
fidence that the results provided by the microbiology labora-
tory are accurate, significant, and clinically relevant. Anything 
less is below the community standard of care for laboratories. 
To provide that level of quality, however, the laboratory requires 
that all microbiology specimens be properly selected, col-
lected, and transported to optimize analysis and interpretation. 
Because result interpretation in microbiology depends entirely 
on the quality of the specimen submitted for analysis, specimen 
management cannot be left to chance, and those that collect 
specimens for microbiologic analysis must be aware of what 
the physician needs for patient care as well as what the labora-
tory needs to provide accurate results, including ensuring that

specimens arrive at the laboratory for analysis as quickly as pos-
sible after collection (Table 1).
At an elementary level, the physician needs answers to 3 very 
basic questions from the laboratory: Is my patient’s illness caused 
by a microbe? If so, what is it? What is the susceptibility profile of 
the organism so therapy can be targeted? To meet those needs, 
the laboratory requires a specimen that has been appropriately 
selected, collected, and transported to the laboratory for analy-
sis. Caught in the middle, between the physician and laboratory 
requirements, are the medical personnel who actually select and 
collect the specimen and who may not know or understand what 
the physician or the laboratory needs to do their work. Enhancing 
the quality of the specimen is everyone’s job, so communication 
between the physicians, nurses, and laboratory staff should be 
encouraged and open with no punitive motive or consequences.
The diagnosis of infectious disease is best achieved by apply-
ing in-depth knowledge of both medical and laboratory science 
along with principles of epidemiology and pharmacokinetics 
of antibiotics and by integrating a strategic view of host–par-
asite interactions. Clearly, the best outcomes for patients are 
the result of strong partnerships between the clinician and the 
microbiology specialist. This document illustrates and promotes 
this partnership and emphasizes the importance of appropriate 
specimen management to clinical relevance of the results. One 
of the most valuable laboratory partners in infectious disease 
diagnosis is the certified microbiology specialist, particularly 
a specialist certified as a Diplomate by the American Board of 
Medical Microbiology, the American Board of Pathology, or the 
American Board of Medical Laboratory Immunology or their 
equivalent certified by other organizations. Clinicians should 
recommend and medical institutions should provide this kind 
of leadership for the microbiology laboratory or provide formal 
access to this level of laboratory expertise through consultation.
IMPACT OF SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT
Microbiology specimen selection and collection are the respon-
sibility of the medical personnel, not usually the laboratory, 
although the certified specialist may be called upon for consulta-
tion or assistance. The impact of proper specimen management on 
patient care is enormous. It is the key to accurate laboratory diag-
nosis and confirmation, it directly affects patient care and patient 
outcomes, it influences therapeutic decisions, it impacts hospital 
infection control, patient length of stay, hospital and laboratory 
costs, it influences antibiotic stewardship, and it drives laboratory 
efficiency. Clinicians and other medical personnel should consult 
the laboratory to ensure that selection, collection, transport, and 
storage of patient specimens they collect are managed properly.
TENETS OF SPECIMEN MANAGEMENT
Throughout the text, there will be caveats that are relevant to spe-
cific specimens and diagnostic protocols for infectious disease 
diagnosis. However, there are some strategic tenets of specimen 
management and testing in microbiology that stand as community 
standards of care and that set microbiology apart from other labo-
ratory departments such as chemistry or hematology.
TEN POINTS OF IMPORTANCE
1. Specimens of poor quality must be rejected. Microbiologists 
act correctly and responsibly when they call physicians to 
clarify and resolve problems with specimen submissions.
2. Physicians should not demand that the laboratory report 
“everything that grows.” This can provide irrelevant infor-
mation that could result in inaccurate diagnosis and inap-
propriate therapy.
3. “Background noise” of commensal microbiota must be 
avoided where possible. Many body sites have normal, com-
mensal microbiota that can easily contaminate the inappro-
priately collected specimen and complicate interpretation. 
Therefore, specimens from sites such as lower respiratory 
tract (sputum), nasal sinuses, superficial wounds, fistulae, 
and others require care in collection.
4. The laboratory requires a specimen, not a swab of a speci-
men. Actual tissue, aspirates, and fluids are always specimens 
of choice, especially from surgery. A swab is not the specimen 
of choice for many specimens because swabs pick up extra-
neous microbes, hold extremely small volumes of the speci-
men (0.05 mL), and make it difficult to get bacteria or fungi 
away from the swab fibers and onto media, and the inoculum 
from the swab is often not uniform across several different 
agar plates. Swabs are expected from the nasopharynx and 
to diagnose most viral respiratory infections. Flocked swabs 
have become a valuable tool for specimen collection and have 
been shown to be more effective than Dacron, rayon, and cot-
ton swabs in many situations. The flocked nature of the swab 
allows for more efficient release of contents for evaluation.
5. The laboratory must follow its procedure manual or face 
legal challenges. The procedures in the manuals should be 
supported by the literature, especially evidence-based lit-
erature. To request the laboratory to provide testing apart 
from the procedure manual places everyone at legal risk.
6. A specimen should be collected prior to administration of 
antibiotics. Once antibiotics have been started, the micro-
biota changes and etiologic agents are impacted, leading to 
potentially misleading culture results.
7. Susceptibility testing should be done only on clinically signif-
icant isolates, not on all microorganisms recovered in culture.
8. Microbiology laboratory results that are reported should be 
accurate, significant, and clinically relevant.
9. The laboratory should set technical policy; this is not the 
purview of the medical staff. Good communication and 
mutual respect will lead to collaborative policies.
10. Specimens must be labeled accurately and completely so 
that interpretation of results will be reliable. Labels such as 
“eye” and “wound” are not helpful to the interpretation of 
results without more specific site and clinical information 
(eg, dog bite wound right forefinger).

The microbiology laboratory policy manual should be available 
at all times for all medical personnel to review or consult and it 
would be particularly helpful to encourage the nursing staff to 
review the specimen collection and management portion of the 
manual. This can facilitate collaboration between the labora-
tory, with the microbiology expertise, and the specimen collec-
tion personnel, who may know very little about microbiology or 
what the laboratory needs to establish or confirm a diagnosis.
It is important to welcome and actively engage the micro-
biology laboratory as an integral part of the healthcare team 
and encourage the hospital or the laboratory facility to have 
board-certified laboratory specialists on hand or available to 
optimize infectious disease laboratory diagnosis.
HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
This document is organized by body system, although many 
organisms are capable of causing disease in >1 body system. There 
may be a redundant mention of some organisms because of their 
propensity to infect multiple sites. One of the unique features of 
this document is its ability to assist clinicians who have specific 
suspicions regarding possible etiologic agents causing a specific 
type of disease. When the term “clinician” is used throughout 
the document, it also includes other licensed, advanced practice 
providers. Another unique feature is that in most chapters, there 
are targeted recommendations and precautions regarding select-
ing and collecting specimens for analysis for a disease process. It 
is very easy to access critical information about a specific body 
site just by consulting the table of contents. Within each chapter, 
there is a table describing the specimen needs regarding a variety 
of etiologic agents that one may suspect as causing the illness. The 
test methods in the tables are listed in priority order according to 
the recommendations of the authors and reviewers.
When room temperature is specified for a certain time 
period, such as 2 hours, it is expected that the sample should 
be refrigerated after that time unless specified otherwise in that 
section. Almost all specimens for virus detection should be 
transported on wet ice and frozen at –80°C if testing is delayed 
>48 hours, although specimens in viral transport media may be 
transported at room temperature when rapid (<2 hours) deliv-
ery to the laboratory is assured.
HISTORY AND REQUEST
This document has been endorsed by the Infectious Diseases 
Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for 
Microbiology (ASM). This is not an official guideline of the IDSA 
but rather an authoritative guide with recommendations for uti-
lizing the microbiology laboratory in infectious disease diagno-
sis. It is a collaborative effort between clinicians and laboratory 
experts focusing on optimum use of the laboratory for positive 
patient outcomes. When the term “recommended” is used in this 
document, it is not a “graded” recommendation as would be found 
in a guideline, but rather the preferred or indicated approach for 
use or application. Future modifications of the document are to 
be expected, as diagnostic microbiology is a dynamic and rap-
idly changing discipline. Pediatric parameters have been updated 
in concordance with Pediatric Clinical Practice Guidelines and 
Policies, 16th ed., and The Red Book (2015), both published by the 
American Academy of Pediatrics. Comments and recommenda-
tions have been integrated into the appropriate sections.
I. BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS AND INFECTIONS OF 
THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
A. Bloodstream Infections and Infective Endocarditis
The diagnosis of bloodstream infections (BSIs) is one of the most 
critical functions of clinical microbiology laboratories. For the 
great majority of etiologic agents of BSIs, conventional blood cul-
ture methods provide positive results within 48 hours; incubation 
for >5 days seldom is required when modern automated continu-
ous-monitoring blood culture systems and media are used [1, 2]. 
This includes recovery of historically fastidious organisms such 
as HACEK [1] (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, 
Eikenella, and Kingella) bacteria and Brucella species (spp) [3, 4]. 
Some microorganisms, such as mycobacteria and dimorphic fungi, 
require longer incubation periods; others may require special cul-
ture media or non-culture-based methods. Although filamentous 
fungi often require special broth media or lysis-centrifugation vials 
for detection, most Candida spp grow very well in standard blood 
culture broths unless the patient has been on antifungal therapy. 
Unfortunately, blood cultures from patients with suspected can-
didemia do not yield positive results in almost half of patients. 
Table 2 provides a summary of diagnostic methods for most BSIs.
For most etiologic agents of infective endocarditis, conven-
tional blood culture methods will suffice [3–5]. However, some 
less common etiologic agents cannot be detected with current 
blood culture methods. The most common etiologic agents of 
culture-negative endocarditis, Bartonella spp and Coxiella bur-
netii, often can be detected by conventional serologic testing. 
However, molecular amplification methods may be needed for 
detection of these organisms as well as others (eg, Tropheryma 
whipplei, Bartonella spp). In rare instances of culture-negative 
endocarditis, 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA 
sequencing of valve tissue may help determine an etiologic agent.
The volume of blood that is obtained for each blood culture 
request (also known as a blood culture set, consisting of all bottles 
procured from a single venipuncture or during one catheter draw) 
is the most important variable in recovering bacteria and fungi 
from adult and pediatric patients with bloodstream infections [1, 
2, 5, 6]. For adults, 20–30 mL of blood per culture set (depending 
on the manufacturer of the instrument) is recommended and may 
require >2 culture bottles depending on the system. For neonates 
and adolescents, an age- and weight- appropriate volume of blood 
should be cultured (see Table 3 below for recommended volumes). 
A second important determinant is the number of blood culture 
sets performed during a given septic episode. Generally, in adults

with a suspicion of BSI, 2–4 blood culture sets should be obtained 
in the evaluation of each septic episode [5, 7].
The timing of blood culture orders should be dictated by 
patient acuity. In urgent situations, 2 or more blood culture sets 
can be obtained sequentially over a short time interval (min-
utes), after which empiric therapy can be initiated. In less urgent 
situations, obtaining blood culture sets may be spaced over sev-
eral hours or more.
Skin contaminants in blood culture bottles are common, very 
costly to the healthcare system, and frequently confusing to cli-
nicians. To minimize the risk of contamination of the blood cul-
ture with commensal skin microbiota, meticulous care should be

bTypically, blood specimens are split between aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. There may be circumstances in which it is prudent to omit the anaerobic vial and split blood spec-
imens between 2 aerobic vials. One example is when fungemia due to yeast is strongly suspected. Most manufacturers’ bottles accept a maximum of 10 mL per bottle.
cRecommended volumes of blood for culture in pediatric patients are shown in (Table 3) [1].
dThe success rate for recovery of Bartonella spp from blood even when optimum methods are used is extremely low.
eLegionella bacteremia occurs infrequently and rarely is the organism recovered from blood even when optimum culture techniques are employed.
fThe optimum urine specimen is the first voided specimen of the day.
gSince yeast are highly aerobic, when fungemia due to yeast is suspected, it might be prudent within a series of blood cultures to inoculate at least 1 blood specimen into 2 aerobic vials 
rather than the customary aerobic and anaerobic vial pair. Alternatively, a broth medium designed for enhanced yield of yeast (eg, MycoF/Lytic [BD Diagnostics, Sparks, Maryland]) or 
lysis-centrifugation may be used.
hSome dimorphic fungi and yeasts (eg, Malassezia spp) may be visualized on peripheral blood smears in some patients using one of a variety of fungal stains. Such requests should be made 
in consultation with the microbiology laboratory director.

taken in skin preparation prior to venipuncture. In addition, new 
products are now available that allow diversion and discard of the 
first few milliliters of blood that are most likely to contain skin 
contaminants. Consensus guidelines [2] and expert panels [1] 
recommend peripheral venipuncture as the preferred technique 
for obtaining blood for culture based on data showing that blood 
obtained in this fashion is less likely to be contaminated than blood 
obtained from an intravascular catheter or other device. Several 
studies have documented that iodine tincture, chlorine peroxide, 
and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) are superior to povidone-io-
dine preparations as skin disinfectants for blood culture [1, 2]. 
Iodine tincture and CHG require about 30 seconds to exert an 
antiseptic effect compared with 1.5–2 minutes for povidone-io-
dine preparations [2]. Two recent studies have documented equiv-
alent contamination rates with iodine tincture and CHG [8, 9]. 
CHG is not recommended for use in infants <2 months of age but 
povidone-iodine followed by alcohol is recommended.
Blood cultures contaminated with skin flora during collec-
tion are common but contamination rates should not exceed 
3%. Laboratories should have policies and procedures for 
abbreviating the workup and reporting of common blood cul-
ture contaminants (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viri-
dans group streptococci, diphtheroids, Bacillus spp other than 
B. anthracis). These procedures may include abbreviated iden-
tification of the organism, absence of susceptibility testing, and 
a comment that instructs the clinician to contact the laboratory 
if the culture result is thought to be clinically significant and 
requires additional workup and susceptibility results.
Physicians should expect to be called and notified by the 
laboratory every time a blood culture becomes positive since 
these specimens often represent life-threatening infections. If 
the physician wishes not to be notified during specific times, 
arrangements must be made by the physician for a delegated 
healthcare professional to receive the call and relay the report.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia/
fungemia:
• Volume of blood collected, not timing, is most critical.
• Disinfect the venipuncture site with chlorhexidine or 
2% iodine tincture in adults and children >2 months old 
(chlorhexidine NOT recommended for children <2 months 
old), using povidone-iodine and alcohol).
• Draw blood for culture before initiating antimicrobial therapy.
• Catheter-drawn blood cultures have a higher risk of contam-
ination (false positives).
• Do not submit catheter tips for culture without an accompa-
nying blood culture obtained by venipuncture.
• Never refrigerate blood prior to incubation.
• Use a 2- to 3-bottle blood culture set for adults, at least 1 aer-
obic and 1 anaerobic; use 1–2 aerobic bottles for children and 
consider aerobic and anaerobic when clinically relevant.
• Streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive organ-
isms and facultatively anaerobic organisms may grow best in 
the anaerobic bottle (faster time to detection).

The diagnosis of catheter-associated BSIs is often one of exclusion, 
and a microbiologic gold standard for diagnosis does not exist. 
Although a number of different microbiologic methods have been 
described, the available data do not allow firm conclusions to be 
made about the relative merits of these various diagnostic tech-
niques [10–12]. Fundamental to the diagnosis of catheter-associ-
ated BSI is documentation of bacteremia. The clinical significance 
of a positive culture from an indwelling catheter segment or tip 
in the absence of positive blood cultures is unknown. The next 
essential diagnostic component is demonstrating that the infec-
tion is caused by the catheter. This usually requires exclusion of 
other potential primary foci for the BSI. Some investigators have 
concluded that catheter tip cultures have such poor predictive 
value that they should not be performed [13].
Numerous diagnostic techniques for catheter cultures have 
been described and may provide adjunctive evidence of cathe-
ter-associated BSI; however, all have potential pitfalls that make 
interpretation of results problematic. Routine culture of intrave-
nous catheter tips at the time of catheter removal has no clinical 
value and should not be done [13]. Although not performed in 
most laboratories, the methods described include the following:
• Time to positivity (not performed routinely in most labora-
tories): Standard blood cultures (BCs) obtained at the same

time, one from the catheter or port and one from peripheral 
venipuncture, processed in a continuous-monitoring BC sys-
tem. If both BCs grow the same organism and the BC drawn 
from the device becomes positive >2 hours before the BC 
drawn by venipuncture, there is a high probability of cathe-
ter-associated BSI [14].
• Quantitative BCs (not performed routinely in most labora-
tories): one from catheter or port and one from peripheral 
venipuncture obtained at the same time using lysis-centrifu-
gation (Isolator) or pour plate method. If both BCs grow the 
same organism and the BC drawn from the device has 5-fold 
more organisms than the BC drawn by venipuncture, there is 
a high probability of catheter-associated BSI [15, 16].
• Catheter tip or segment cultures: The semi-quantitative 
method of Maki et al [12] is used most commonly; interpre-
tation requires an accompanying peripheral BC. However, 
meticulous technique is needed to reduce contamination and 
to obtain the correct length (5 cm) of the distal catheter tip. 
This method only detects organisms colonizing the outside of 
the catheter, which is rolled onto an agar plate, after which the 
number of colonies is counted; organisms that may be intralu-
minal are missed. Modifications of the Maki method have been 
described as have methods that utilize vortexing of the catheter 
tip or an endoluminal brush (not performed routinely in most 
laboratories). Biofilm formation on catheter tips prevents anti-
microbial therapy from clearing agents within the biofilm, thus 
requiring removal of the catheter to eliminate the organisms.
C. Infected (Mycotic) Aneurysms and Vascular Grafts
Infected (mycotic) aneurysms and infections of vascular grafts 
may result in positive blood cultures. Definitive diagnosis requires 
microscopic visualization and/or culture recovery of etiologic 
agents from representative biopsy or graft material (Table 4).
D. Pericarditis and Myocarditis
Numerous viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, fungi, and parasites 
have been implicated as etiologic agents of pericarditis and 
myocarditis. In many patients with pericarditis and in the over-
whelming majority of patients with myocarditis, an etiologic 
diagnosis is never made and patients are treated empirically. 
In selected instances when it is important clinically to define 
the specific cause of infection, a microbiologic diagnosis should 
be pursued aggressively. Unfortunately, however, the available 
diagnostic resources are quite limited, and there are no firm 
diagnostic guidelines that can be given. Some of the more com-
mon and clinically important pathogens are listed in Table 5 
below. When a microbiologic diagnosis of less common etio-
logic agents is required, especially when specialized techniques 
or methods are necessary, consultation with the laboratory 
director should be undertaken. There is considerable overlap 
between pericarditis and myocarditis with respect to both etio-
logic agents and disease manifestations.
II. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTIONS
Clinical microbiology tests of value in establishing an etiologic 
diagnosis of infections within the central nervous system (CNS) 
are outlined below. In this section, infections are categorized 
as follows: meningitis, encephalitis, focal infections of brain 
parenchyma, CNS shunt infections, subdural empyema, epi-
dural abscess, and suppurative intracranial thrombophlebitis.
Organisms usually enter the CNS by crossing a mucosal bar-
rier into the bloodstream followed by penetration of the blood–
brain barrier. Other routes of infection include direct extension 
from a contiguous structure, movement along nerves, or intro-
duction by foreign devices.
Usually 3 or 4 tubes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are col-
lected by lumbar puncture for diagnostic studies. The first 
tube has the highest potential for contamination with skin 
flora and should not be sent to the microbiology laboratory 
for direct smears, culture, or molecular studies. A minimum of 
0.5–1 mL of CSF should be sent immediately after collection to 
the microbiology laboratory in a sterile container for bacterial 
testing. Larger volumes (5–10 mL) increase the sensitivity of 
culture and are required for optimal recovery of mycobacteria 
and fungi. When the specimen volume is less than required 
for multiple test requests, prioritization of testing must be 
provided to the laboratory. Whenever possible, specimens for 
culture should be obtained prior to initiation of antimicrobial 
therapy.

CSF Gram stains should be prepared after cytocentrifugation 
and positive results called to the patient care area immediately. 
Identification and susceptibility testing of bacteria recovered 
from cultures is routinely performed unless contamination 
during collection or processing is suspected.
Most clinical microbiology laboratories do not perform all 
of the testing listed in the tables. This is especially true of sero-
logic and many molecular diagnostic tests. The availability of 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared NAATs for 
many agents is limited, requiring laboratory-developed tests to 
be used, with variable sensitivities and specificities. Although 
an FDA-cleared multiplex PCR targeting 14 organisms is avail-
able for diagnosing meningitis and encephalitis, it should not 
be considered a replacement for culture since clinical experi-
ence with the assay is limited and specificity issues have been 
reported [17, 18]. The expense and data interpretation chal-
lenges associated with next-generation sequencing have pre-
vented widespread use of this technology for the time being [19]. 
Serologic diagnosis is based on CSF to serum antibody index, 
4-fold rise in acute to convalescent immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
titer, or a single positive immunoglobulin M (IgM). Detection 
of antibody in CSF may indicate CNS infection, blood contami-
nation, or transfer of antibodies across the blood–brain barrier. 
Submission of acute (3–10 days after onset of symptoms) and 
convalescent (2–3 weeks after acute) serum samples is recom-
mended. Serum should be separated from red cells as soon as 
possible.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of CNS infections:
• Whenever possible, collect specimens prior to initiating anti-
microbial therapy.
• Two to 4 BCs should also be obtained if bacterial meningitis 
is suspected.
• Inform the microbiology laboratory if unusual organisms are 
possible (eg, Nocardia, fungi, mycobacteria), for which spe-
cial procedures are necessary. [20].
• Do not refrigerate CSF.
• CSF tubes #2 or #3, not #1, should be submitted for bacterial 
culture and molecular testing.
• Attempt to collect as much sample as possible for multiple 
studies (minimum recommended is 1 mL); prioritize multi-
ple test requests on small-volume samples.

gThe diagnosis of acute meningitis due to HIV, a condition that often arises during the early stages of the HIV retroviral syndrome, is best established based on compatible CSF findings (ie, 
a mild CSF lymphocytosis with a mildly elevated CSF protein level and normal glucose) combined with definitive evidence of recent HIV infection (see Section XIV, HIV diagnosis).

pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis) (Table 6). Patient age 
and other factors (ie, immunostatus, having undergone neuro-
surgery, trauma) are associated with specific pathogens.
Molecular testing has replaced viral culture for the diagno-
sis of enteroviral meningitis, but is not routinely relied on for 
the detection of bacteria in CSF where Gram stain and bacte-
rial culture should be ordered. The sensitivity of the Gram stain 
for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is 60%–80% in patients 
who have not received antimicrobial therapy and 40%–60% in 
patients who have received treatment [21]. Bacterial antigen 
testing on CSF is no longer recommended and should not be 
ordered nor should the laboratory provide this service. Early, 
incorrect assumptions held that selected antigen tests on CSF 
may have some value in patients who received therapy prior to 
specimen collection with negative Gram stain and negative cul-
ture results [22], but this is no longer recommended. In patients 
suspected of having bacterial meningitis, at least 2–4 blood cul-
tures should be performed, but therapy should not be delayed.
Organisms expected to cause chronic meningitis (symptoms 
lasting ≥4 weeks) include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, and 
spirochetes (Table 6). Because the sensitivity of nucleic acid ampli-
fication tests (NAAT) for M. tuberculosis in nonrespiratory speci-
mens may be poor, culture should also be requested [20, 23]. The 
reported sensitivity of culture for diagnosing tuberculous meningi-
tis is 25%–70% [24]. The highest yields for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
smear and AFB culture occur when large volumes (≥5 mL) of CSF 
are used to perform the testing. The cryptococcal antigen test has 
replaced the India ink stain for rapid diagnosis of meningitis caused 
by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii and should be 
readily available in most laboratories. This test is most sensitive 
when performed on CSF rather than serum. The sensitivity and 
specificity of cryptococcal antigen tests are >90%, but false-nega-
tive and false-positive results may occur, for example in patients 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. Complement 
fixation test performed on CSF is recommended for the diagnosis 
of coccidioidal meningitis since direct fungal smear and culture 
are often negative. Detection of Coccidioides antibody in CSF by 
immunodiffusion has lower specificity than complement fixation.
B. Encephalitis
Encephalitis is an infection of the brain parenchyma caus-
ing abnormal cerebral function (altered mental status, beha-
vior or speech disturbances, sensory or motor deficits). Despite 
advancements in molecular technology for the diagnosis of CNS 
infections, the etiologic agent of encephalitis often cannot be 
identified. The California Encephalitis Project identified a defi-
nite or probable etiologic agent for only 16% of 1570 immuno-
competent patients enrolled from 1998 to 2005 (69% viral, 20% 
bacterial, 7% prion, 3% parasitic, 1% fungal); a possible cause was 
identified for an additional 13% of patients [25]. Immunostatus, 
travel, and other exposure history (insects, animals, water, sex-
ual) should guide testing. The Infectious Diseases Society of 
America (IDSA) practice guidelines provide a detailed listing of 
risk factors associated with specific etiologic agents [26].
Although the diagnosis of a specific viral cause is usually based 
on testing performed on CSF, testing of specimens collected 
from other sites may be helpful. The virus most commonly iden-
tified as causing encephalitis is herpes simplex virus (HSV) with 
90% HSV-1. The sensitivity and specificity of NAAT for HSV 
encephalitis are >95%; early data showed that HSV is cultured 
from CSF in <5% of cases [27, 28]. Reports of false-negative 
HSV NAAT are the basis of recommendations to collect another 
CSF specimen 3–7 days later for repeat testing if HSV encepha-
litis continues to be suspected [26, 29]. The sensitivity of NAAT 
performed on CSF for enterovirus encephalitis is >95% and the 
sensitivity of culture is 65%–75% (recovery from throat or stool 
is circumstantial etiologic evidence) [27]. Additional NAAT 
specific for parechoviruses is recommended for young children 
[29]. Because the performance characteristics of molecular test-
ing for other causes of viral encephalitis are not well established, 
serology and repeat molecular testing may be required (Table 7).
C. Focal Infections of Brain Parenchyma
Focal parenchymal brain infections start as cerebritis, then 
progress to necrosis surrounded by a fibrous capsule. There are 
2 broad categories of pathogenesis: (1) contiguous spread (otitis 
media, sinusitis, mastoiditis, and dental infection), trauma, neu-
rosurgical complication, or (2) hematogenous spread from a dis-
tant site of infection (skin, pulmonary, pelvic, intra-abdominal, 
esophageal, endocarditis). A brain abscess in an immunocompe-
tent host is usually caused by bacteria (Table 8). A wider array of 
organisms is encountered in immunocompromised individuals.
D. Central Nervous System Shunt Infections
Shunts are placed to divert CSF for the treatment of hydrocephalus. 
The proximal portion is placed in a cerebral ventricle, intracranial 
cyst, or the subarachnoid space (lumbar region). The distal portion 
may be internalized (peritoneal, vascular, or pleural space) or exter-
nalized. Five to 15% of shunts become infected (Table 9). Potential 
routes of shunt infection include contamination at time of place-
ment, contamination from the distal portion (retrograde), break-
down of the skin over the shunt, and hematogenous seeding. Blood 
cultures should also be collected if the shunt terminates in a vascu-
lar space (ventriculoatrial shunt). Most CNS shunt infections are 
caused by bacteria. Fungi are more likely to cause shunt infections 
in immunocompromised patients and those receiving total paren-
teral nutrition, steroids, or broad-spectrum antibiotics. Culture of 
shunt or drain components after removal should not be performed 
unless the patient has symptoms of a CNS infection [35].
E. Subdural Empyema, Epidural Abscess, and Suppurative Intracranial 
Thrombophlebitis
Cranial subdural empyema and cranial epidural abscess are neu-
rosurgical emergencies that are usually caused by bacteria (strep-
tococci, staphylococci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, anaerobes, 
often polymicrobial) (Table 10). Mycobacteria and fungi are rare

causes. Predisposing conditions include sinusitis, otitis media, 
mastoiditis, neurosurgery, head trauma, subdural hematoma, 
and meningitis (infants).
The pathogenesis of spinal epidural abscess includes hematoge-
nous spread (skin, urinary tract, mouth, mastoid, lung infection), 
direct extension (vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis), trauma, or

postprocedural complication (surgery, biopsy, lumbar puncture, 
anesthesia). Spinal epidural abscess is usually caused by staphylo-
cocci, streptococci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. 
Nocardia spp, mycobacteria, and fungi may also cause spinal 
epidural abscess. Spinal subdural empyema is similar to spinal 
epidural abscess in clinical presentation and causative organisms.
Magnetic resonance imaging is the optimal diagnostic pro-
cedure for suppurative intracranial thrombophlebitis. The etio-
logic agent may be recovered from cerebrospinal fluid and blood 
cultures. Causative organisms are similar to cranial epidural 
abscess and cranial subdural empyema. Empiric antimicrobial 
therapy is usually based on the predisposing clinical condition.
III. OCULAR INFECTIONS
The spectrum of ocular infections can range from superficial, 
which may be treated symptomatically or with empiric topical 
antimicrobial therapy, to those sight-threatening infections that 
require aggressive surgical intervention and either topical and/
or parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Infections may occur in the 
anatomical structures surrounding the eye (conjunctivitis, bleph-
aritis, canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, orbital and periorbital celluli-
tis), on the surface of the eye (keratitis), or within the globe of the 
eye (endophthalmitis and uveitis/retinitis). Recommendations 
for the laboratory diagnosis of ocular infections are often based 
on studies where only small numbers of clinical specimens were 
examined so the evidence base for many recommendations is 
limited. Studies comparing multiple diagnostic approaches to 
determine the optimal means for detection of the infectious eti-
ology of keratitis and endophthalmitis are further hampered by 
small specimen size. Finally, frequent pretreatment with topical 
antibacterial agents further complicates laboratory diagnosis of 
both bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis [36].
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of ocular infections:
• Specimens should be labeled with the specific anatomic 
source, ie, conjunctiva or cornea, but not just “eye.”

• The Gram stain is useful in the diagnosis of conjunctivitis, so 
2 swabs per site may be appropriate; a paired specimen from 
the uninfected eye can be used as a “control” to assist in cul-
ture or Gram stain interpretation.
• Swab specimens are routinely used but provide a minimum 
amount of material. Consult the laboratory regarding sus-
picious agents. Corneal scrapings are preferred for keratitis 
diagnosis.
• Organisms that are part of the indigenous microflora are 
usually not involved in conjunctivitis but may be involved in 
postsurgical keratitis and endophthalmitis.
A. Specimen Collection, Processing, and Transport
Because ocular infections may involve one or both eyes and eti-
ologies may differ, clinicians must clearly mark specimens as to 
which eye has been sampled, especially in those patients who 
have bilateral disease.
Collection of specimens from anatomical structures sur-
rounding the eye is typically done using swabs (Table 11). The 
most commonly collected specimens are from the conjunctiva. 
Cultures for aerobic bacteria and detection of Chlamydia and 
viruses either by culture or NAAT are most commonly performed, 
although none are as yet FDA approved for detection in eye spec-
imens. Since direct microscopic examination may be useful in 
preliminary diagnosis of conjunctivitis, obtaining dual swabs, 
one for culture and one for smear preparation, is recommended. 
Smears may be made for Gram stain, calcofluor stain for fungi 
and Acanthamoeba, or direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) for 
Chlamydia trachomatis. Appropriate transport media should be 
provided by the laboratory and available at the collection site for 
specimens submitted for Chlamydia and/or viral culture or NAAT 
[36]. Although NAAT tests are preferred for the diagnosis of viral 
ocular infections because of their increased sensitivity and more 
rapid turnaround time, if viral culture is requested, specimens 
should be submitted on ice using viral transport medium, espe-
cially if specimen transport is prolonged [36].
Specimens obtained from either the surface or the globe 
of the eye are almost always collected by ophthalmologists. 
Specimen types include swabs of ulcers, corneal scrapings, 
impression membrane cultures, biopsies, or anterior chamber 
aspirates, or vitreous aspirates/washings [36, 37]. The volume of 
specimens is always limited. This specimen limitation makes it 
necessary for the laboratory to prioritize procedures depending 
on what organisms are sought; this should always be done after 
discussion with the ophthalmologist who collects the specimen 
and the infectious disease consultant when appropriate. This 
is particularly important because all major pathogen groups—
viruses, parasites, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi—can cause 
ocular infection. Both epidemiology and clinical presentation 
are used to narrow the organism(s) sought and the laboratory 
tests requested. Because of the limited specimen size seen with 
scrapings and biopsies, the laboratory and ophthalmologist

aNAATs for detection of C. trachomatis have not yet been approved in the United States for use with conjunctival swab specimens. Individual laboratories, however, may have validated 
NAATs for examination of specimens obtained from patients with conjunctivitis, and studies suggest that NAATs are more sensitive than cultures.
bUse of NAAT for detection of C. trachomatis is considered an “off-label” use of this test. Laboratories that offer such testing must conduct in-house validation of these assays before offering 
NAAT as a diagnostic test.
cCulturing of specimens thought to harbor herpes B virus (primate origin) requires use of biosafety level 4 precautions in the laboratory, and testing is almost always referred to a specialized 
reference laboratory. Consult the laboratory when herpes B virus is suspected.

may agree to inoculate these specimens onto media and pre-
pare smears at the bedside. In this case, the laboratory should 
supply the necessary media and slides to the ophthalmologist. 
If these supplies are stored in the clinic or operating suite for 
ready access by the surgeon, it is the laboratory’s responsibility 
to assure that these materials do not out-date and meet all qual-
ity control standards. Aspirates from the anterior chamber or 
vitreous are the optimal specimens for detection of anaerobic 
bacteria and viral agents; they can be submitted in syringes with 
needles removed. Syringes should be placed in a leak-proof 
outer container for transport. Injection of the fluid into a small 
sterile vial (provided by the laboratory) is preferable. The same 
principles for specimen collection and transport described for 
conjunctival specimens apply to these specimens as well.
B. Orbital and Periorbital Cellulitis
Orbital cellulitis is almost always a complication of sinusitis and 
the organisms associated with it include Streptococcus pneu-
moniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus 
pyogenes, Moraxella spp, anaerobic bacteria, Aspergillus spp, 
and the Mucorales (formerly Zygomycetes). Periorbital celluli-
tis usually arises as a result either of localized trauma or bacte-
remia most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, S. pyogenes, 
or S. pneumoniae [38]. Diagnosis of these infections is either 
based on positive blood cultures or, in the case of orbital cellu-
litis, culture of drainage material aspirated from the subperios-
teal region of the sinuses.
C. Infection of the Eyelids and Lacrimal System
Blepharitis, canaliculitis, and dacryocystitis are all superficial 
infections that are generally self-limited. The organisms asso-
ciated with these infections are predominantly gram-positive 
bacteria, although various gram-negative bacteria, anaerobes, 
and fungi all have been recovered [39]. A limitation of many 
studies of these infections is that microbiologic data on con-
trol populations are frequently lacking. The organisms com-
monly recovered are part of the indigenous skin microflora 
such as coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids, so 
attributing a pathogenic role to these organisms in these condi-
tions is difficult. Cultures from these sites are rarely submitted 
for diagnostic workup. If cultures for canaliculitis are consid-
ered, concretions recovered during canalicular compression or 
canaliculotomy are recommended. Strategies for the diagnosis 
of these superficial infections should be similar to those for 
conjunctivitis.
D. Conjunctivitis
Most cases of conjunctivitis are caused by bacteria or viruses 
that are typically associated with upper respiratory tract infec-
tions [40, 41]. Because of the distinctive clinical presentation of 
both bacterial and viral conjunctivitis coupled with the self-lim-
ited nature of these infections, determining its etiology is infre-
quently attempted [42]. When tests are requested, diagnosis 
of bacterial conjunctivitis is often compromised by the prior 
use of empiric antibacterial therapy [40, 41]. Sexually active 
patients who present with bacterial conjunctivitis should have 
an aggressive diagnostic workup with Gram stain and cultures 
because of their risk for N. gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis [43]. This 
is a sight-threatening infection which can result in perforation 
of the globe. In the developing world, trachoma, a form of con-
junctivitis due to specific strains of C. trachomatis is a leading 
cause of blindness, especially in children [44]. Off-label use of 
commercial NAAT assays is used for detection of this agent in 
research settings [44]. Certain organisms that are part of the 
indigenous skin and mucous membrane microflora, such as 
coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium spp, and 
viridans streptococci, are generally considered nonpathogenic 
when recovered from the conjunctival mucosa and are consid-
ered to be “normal flora.” In specimens taken from the surface 
or interior of the eye, these organisms along with Cutibacterium 
(Propionibacterium) acnes are considered pathogens, especially 
in patient postcataract or LASIK surgery [36]. Adenovirus, the 
etiologic agent of “pink eye,” is highly transmissible in a variety 
of settings. This is almost always a clinical diagnosis, although 
for epidemiologic purposes culture or NAAT can be done [36]. 
Most cases of neonatal conjunctivitis are due to Neisseria gon-
orrhoeae, C. trachomatis, or herpes simplex virus. Commercial 
NAATs for both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are not FDA 
approved for this specimen type so culture or in the case of 
C. trachomatis, DFA testing, if available, can be used [36, 44]. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a rare but life-threatening cause of 
neonatal conjunctivitis in hospitalized infants.
E. Keratitis
Corneal infections usually occur in 3 distinct patient popula-
tions: those with ocular trauma with foreign objects, those with 
postsurgical complications of corneal surgery, and in patients 
who practice poor hygiene associated with their extended-wear 
contact lenses [45, 46]. Postvaccination keratitis is a well-rec-
ognized complication of vaccinia vaccination and should be 
considered in the appropriate clinical setting [47]. Corneal 
infections can also result from reactivation of herpes viruses 
including HSV and varicella zoster virus [48]. It is important 
to note that the use of dyes and topical anesthetics may inhibit 
NAAT reactions used to diagnose keratitis [48]. The eye sur-
face should be thoroughly rinsed with nonbacteriostatic saline 
before specimens for NAATs are obtained [48, 49] (Table 12).
The most common corneal infections occur in patients who 
improperly use their contact lens system. Because these patients 
are usually treated with antimicrobial agents prior to obtain-
ing specimens for bacterial cultures, some ophthalmologists 
favor culturing contact lens solution and cases. However, cul-
ture of such solutions and cases is not recommended because 
of the frequency with which they are falsely positive [50, 51]. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of sporadic

contact lens–associated keratitis, but outbreaks of keratitis 
due to contamination of contact lens care solutions have been 
recently reported with both Fusarium and Acanthamoeba 
[50–53]. Sporadic cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis are increas-
ing, with >90% associated with improper contact lens use [54]. 
Postsurgical keratitis infections are frequently due to either 
coagulase-negative staphylococci or C. acnes, so in this setting 
these organisms should not be considered contaminants but 
as potential pathogens [36]. Keratitis postcorneal transplant is 
most commonly due to Candida spp (80% of cases). This is due 
in part to the most widely used corneal holding medium not 
containing any antifungal agents [55].

aThe relative likelihood of a specific etiology depends on the underlying reason for the development of keratitis.
bCulture plates, including a sheep blood agar plate and a chocolate agar plate, should be inoculated directly with material collected on the Kimura spatula directly at the patient’s bedside at 
the time corneal scrapings are obtained, usually applied to the agar surface as a number of small “C”-shaped inocula. If sufficient sample is available, a smear on a glass slide may also be 
prepared at the patient’s bedside after the plates are inoculated. The inoculated plates and slide (if prepared) are then transported directly to the microbiology laboratory.
cThe laboratory should be notified when Nocardia spp is suspected so that culture plates may be incubated for longer periods than normal, thus enhancing the chance of recovering this 
slow-growing organism. Additional media, such as BCYE, can enhance recovery of Nocardia.
dAcid-fast smears and mycobacterial cultures should be performed in all postoperative infections of the cornea. Mycobacterium chelonae is a common finding in such cases.
eAt least one culture plate or slant containing a nonselective fungal growth medium should be inoculated directly at the patient’s bedside at the time corneal scrapings are obtained. If 
sufficient sample is available, a smear on a glass slide may also be prepared at the patient’s bedside. This should be attempted only after plates/slants have been inoculated. The inoculated 
plates/slants and slide (if prepared) are then transported directly to the microbiology laboratory. 
The smear is stained with Calcofluor-KOH in the laboratory and examined for fungal elements.
fA corneal swab specimen is used to inoculate an agar plate containing nonnutritive medium at the patient’s bedside and then transported immediately to the laboratory. In the laboratory, 
the plate is overlaid with a lawn of viable Escherichia coli or some other member of the Enterobacteriaceae (ie, co-cultivation) prior to incubation. Alternatively, plates seeded with the bacteria 
are inoculated with a bit of corneal scraping material or a drop of a suspension of the scraped sample in sterile saline.

Keratitis following trauma due to foreign objects is frequently 
caused by organisms found in the environment. Included in this 
group are environmental gram-negative rods such as P. aerugi-
nosa, Nocardia spp, molds including dematiaceous fungi, and 
environmental mycobacteria [36].
Corneal biopsies are recommended in patients in whom 
keratitis persists or worsens. In a small series (n = 48), organ-
ism was found in 44% who had negative corneal scrapings. 
However, most pathogens were detected by histopathology 
(n = 19) and not culture (n = 9) [56]. Acanthamoeba sp (n = 8) 
and fungi (n = 6) represented most of the organisms detected 
by histopathology.
F. Endophthalmitis
Endophthalmitis can arise either by exogenous introduction of 
pathogens into the eye following trauma or surgery, or as a result 
of endogenous introduction of pathogens across the blood–eye 
barrier. Depending upon the mode of pathogenesis, the spectrum 
of causative agents will vary (Table 13). Specimens for diagno-
sis of endophthalmitis can be obtained by aspiration of aqueous

aAmong the long list of bacterial causes of endophthalmitis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Neisseria meningitidis occur almost exclusively as a result of endoge-
nous seeding of the eye. The other bacteria listed may cause endophthalmitis either secondary to trauma or surgery or following hematogenous seeding. 
bCulture plates, including a sheep blood agar plate and a chocolate agar plate, should be inoculated directly at the patient’s bedside at the time corneal scrapings are obtained (see footnote 
"b" for 
Table 12). If sufficient sample is available, a smear on a glass slide may also be prepared at the patient’s bedside after plates are inoculated. 
The inoculated plates and slide (if prepared) 
are then transported directly to the microbiology laboratory.
cThe laboratory should be notified when Nocardia spp is suspected so that special media can be used and routine culture plates will be incubated for up to 7 days.
dThe most common Mycobacterium sp recovered from intraocular infections is M. chelonae, and this occurs almost exclusively as a complication of surgical procedures.
eAcid-fast smears and mycobacterial cultures should be performed in all postsurgical infections of the eye. A 7H-11 agar or a Lowenstein-Jensen agar slant should be inoculated at the 
patient’s bedside. If sufficient clinical sample remains, a smear should be prepared. Both the slant and the smear (if prepared) should be transported directly to the laboratory for further 
processing. If after inoculating a slant and preparing a smear at the bedside, there is still unused specimen remaining, it should be transported in a sterile container immediately to the 
laboratory at RT for inoculation into broth media and subsequent instrument-based processing.
fAmong the fungi listed, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and other Candida spp cause endogenous endophthalmitis as a result of hematogenous seeding of the eye. The other fungi 
listed typically cause infection following traumatic inoculation of the eye.
gAt least one culture plate or slant containing a nonselective fungal growth medium should be inoculated directly at the patient’s bedside at the time corneal scrapings are obtained. If suffi-
cient sample is available, a smear on a glass slide may also be prepared at the patient’s bedside after plates/slants have been inoculated. The inoculated plates/slants and slide (if prepared) 
are then transported directly to the microbiology laboratory. The smear is stained with Calcofluor-KOH in the laboratory and examined for fungal elements.

fluid or vitreous fluid/washing or via biopsy [57–59]. Specimen 
amounts of both aqueous and vitreous fluid are small, so dis-
cretion must be exercised in determining for which agents the 
specimen should be examined. Alternatively, vitrectomy, a surgi-
cal procedure, allows collections of comparatively large fluid vol-
umes (>5 mL) by “washing” the vitreous with a nonbacteriostatic 
balanced salt solution [58, 59] or by membrane filtration.
Postoperative endophthalmitis is most often caused by 
gram-positive organisms with coagulase-negative staphylococci 
predominating; chronic postoperative endophthalmitis can be 
due to C. acnes, so this organism should not be routinely dis-
missed as a contaminant [58–61]. Postcorneal endophthalmitis 
is due primarily to Candida spp (65%) and gram-positive organ-
isms (33%), with Candida and the majority of the gram-positive 
organism resistant to the antimicrobials present in the cornea 
holding medium [56].
Environmental organisms such as dematiaceous fungi, 
Fusarium spp, Bacillus cereus, Nocardia spp, Mycobacterium 
chelonae, and glucose-fermenting gram-negative rods are more 
commonly encountered in patients with exogenous endoph-
thalmitis [61]. Endogenous endophthalmitis, because of its 
association with bacteremia and fungemia, is usually caused 
by those organisms most responsible for BSIs; for example, 
Candida albicans and related species, Aspergillus spp, S. aureus, 
S. pneumoniae, the Enterobacteriaceae (especially Klebsiella 
pneumoniae), and P. aeruginosa [62, 63]. Viruses and para-
sites are rarely found to cause endophthalmitis; however, as in 
cases of trauma or severe immunosuppression, infection due to 
agents such as the herpes viruses, Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara 
spp, Echinococcus spp, and Onchocerca volvulus do occur [64, 
65] and typically involve the uvea and retina. For further infor-
mation on the diagnosis of ocular infections caused by O. vol-
vulus, see Section XV-C.
G. Uveitis/Retinitis
The inflammation characteristic of uveitis/retinitis is typically 
due to either autoimmune conditions or is idiopathic [66]. Only 
infrequently is it due to infection, which is almost always caused 
by endogenous microbes accessing the eye via a breach in the 
blood–eye barrier. Because uveitis and retinitis, like endogenous 
endophthalmitis, are localized manifestations of systemic infec-
tions, diagnosis of the etiology of systemic infections should 
be coupled with a careful ocular examination, preferably per-
formed by an ophthalmologist with specific infectious disease 
expertise. Important causes of uveitis/retinitis include T. gondii, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV, varicella zoster virus, M. tuber-
culosis, and Treponema pallidum [64–67]. Toxocara canis and 
rubella are additional agents to be considered in pediatrics.
Toxoplasma gondii is the most common infectious cause of 
retinitis. Diagnosis is typically made on clinical grounds sup-
ported by serology. In the industrialized world, the presence of 
T. gondii IgG lacks specificity for the diagnosis of ocular toxo-
plasmosis; therefore, serology is only valuable in the setting of 
acute infection or when the patient has an ocular examination 
pathognomonic for toxoplasmosis, demonstrating retinocho-
roiditis in a majority of cases. The comparison of intraocular an-
tibody levels in aqueous humor to that in serum has been found 
to be a useful means for diagnosing ocular toxoplasmosis, al-
though not consistently accurate. Because the specimen needed 
for testing can only be obtained by an experienced ophthalmol-
ogist and is an invasive procedure, it is unlikely that this tech-
nique will be used outside the research setting [68]. NAAT of 
blood, vitreous, or aqueous fluids is not as sensitive as intra-
ocular antibody determinations, but the specimens for testing 
may be more easily obtained. Sensitivities of NAATs ranging 
from 50% to 80% have been reported in patients with T. gondii 
retinitis depending upon the sequence used and the specimen 
tested. It should be noted that the total numbers of specimens 
tested in these studies are small but there is increasing evidence 
to the diagnostic value of NAAT in T. gondii retinitis [68–72].
Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment, 
CMV retinitis has become much less frequent. Nevertheless, 
cases do occur in HIV patients who have either failed HIV ther-
apy or as an AIDS-presenting diagnosis [73]. In addition, CMV 
retinitis has been a well-recognized complication of bone mar-
row and solid organ transplantation, less frequent recently due 
to improvements in preemptive detection and therapy. CMV 
retinitis is frequently diagnosed clinically because of character-
istic lesions seen on ophthalmologic examination. Quantitative 
CMV NAAT performed on peripheral blood is also a useful 
tool in the diagnosis and management of this infection. Patients 
with detectable CMV viral loads have a higher likelihood of ret-
inal disease progression, and those with high CMV viral loads 
have increased mortality. Patients with undetectable CMV viral 
loads have a low likelihood of having virus that is resistant to 
antiviral agents [74]. Because of interlaboratory variation in 
viral quantification, what represents a positive CMV viral load 
and a high CMV viral load will vary among laboratories [75]. 
Physicians should consult the laboratory performing the CMV 
viral load for assistance with test interpretation.
Patients with ocular syphilis may present with normal CSF 
or may frequently have CNS findings associated with either 
acute syphilitic meningitis or neurosyphilis. Patients with 
syphilitic uveitis typically have high rapid plasma reagin (RPR) 
titers [67]. Cell counts, total protein, and glucose, along with 
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) testing of CSF, 
are recommended in clinical settings where syphilitic uveitis is 
suspected [67].
Finally, metagenomics analysis is beginning to be applied in 
research settings for the diagnosis of unusual cases of uveitis. This 
diagnostic approach is likely to be available for the diagnosis of 
endophthalmitis, uveitis, and retinitis in the near future [76].

. SOFT 
TISSUE INFECTIONS OF 
THE HEAD 
AND NECK
Infection of various spaces and tissues that occur in the head 
and neck can be divided into those arising from odontogenic, 
oropharyngeal, or exogenous sources. Odontogenic infections 
are caused commonly by endogenous periodontal or gingival 
flora [77]. These infections include peritonsillar and pharyngeal 
abscesses; deep space abscesses, such as those of the retropharyn-
geal, parapharyngeal, submandibular, and sublingual spaces; and 
cervical lymphadenitis [78, 79]. Complications of odontogenic 
infection can occur by hematogenous spread or by direct exten-
sion resulting in septic jugular vein thrombophlebitis (Lemierre 
syndrome), bacterial endocarditis, intracranial abscess, or acute 
mediastinitis [80, 81]. Accurate etiologic diagnosis depends upon 
collection of an aspirate or biopsy of inflammatory material from 
affected tissues and tissue spaces while avoiding contamina-
tion with mucosal microbiota. The specimen should be placed 
into an anaerobic transport container to support the recovery of 
anaerobic bacteria (both aerobic and facultative bacteria survive 
in anaerobic transport). Requests for Gram-stained smears are 
standard for all anaerobic cultures because they allow the labo-
ratorian to evaluate the adequacy of the specimen by identify-
ing inflammatory cells, provide an early presumptive etiologic 
diagnosis, and identify morphologic patterns indicative of mixed 
aerobic and anaerobic infections [82]. Additionally, spirochetes 
(often involved in odontogenic infection) cannot be recovered in 
routine anaerobic cultures but will be seen in the stained smear.
Infections caused by oropharyngeal flora include epiglotti-
tis, mastoiditis, inflammation of salivary tissue, and suppurative 
parotitis [77, 83]. Because the epiglottis may swell dramatically 
during epiglottitis, there is a chance of sudden occlusion of the 
trachea if the epiglottis is disturbed, such as by an attempt to col-
lect a swab specimen. Blood cultures are the preferred sample for 
the diagnosis of epiglottitis; if swabbing is attempted, it should 
be in a setting with available appropriate emergency response. 
Oropharyngeal flora also can extend into tissues of the middle 
ear, mastoid, and nasal sinuses, causing acute infection [77, 84]. 
Aspirated material, saline lavage of a closed space, and tissue or 
tissue scrapings are preferred specimens and must be transported 
in a sterile container. Tissues should be transported under sterile 
conditions and kept moist by adding a few drops of sterile, non-
bacteriostatic saline. Although rarely implicated, if anaerobic bac-
terial pathogens are suspected, anaerobic transport is required. 
Note that filamentous fungi are common causes of chronic sinus-
itis, and they may not be recovered on swabs, even those obtained 
endoscopically. Endoscopic aspirates or tissue scrapings are the 
specimens of choice. For microbiology analysis, it is always best to 
submit the actual specimen, not a swab of the specimen.
Infections caused by exogenous pathogens (not part of the 
oral flora) include malignant otitis externa, mastoiditis, animal 
bites and trauma, irradiation burns, and complications of sur-
gical procedures [84, 85]. Mucosal flora may play an etiologic 
role in these infections, most frequently gram-negative bacilli 
and staphylococci.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of head and neck soft 
tissue infections:
• A swab is not the specimen of choice for these specimens. 
Submit tissue, fluid, or aspirate when possible.
• Resist swabbing in cases of epiglottitis.
• Use anaerobic transport containers if anaerobes are suspected.
• Keep tissue specimens moist during transport.
The following tables include the most common soft tissue and 
tissue space infections of the head and neck that originate from 
odontogenic, oropharyngeal, and exogenous sources. The opti-
mum approach to establishing an etiologic diagnosis of each 
condition is provided.
A. Infections of the Oral Cavity and Adjacent Spaces and Tissues Caused 
by Odontogenic and Oropharyngeal Flora (Table 14)
B. Mastoiditis and Malignant Otitis Externa Caused by Oropharyngeal and 
Exogenous Pathogens (Table 15)
V. UPPER RESPIRATORY 
TRACT BACTERIAL AND 
FUNGAL INFECTIONS
Infections in the upper respiratory tract usually involve the ears, 
the mucus membranes lining the nose and throat above the epi-
glottis, and the sinuses. Most infections involving the nose and 
throat are caused by viruses (see Section XIV for testing informa-
tion). Inappropriate utilization of antibiotics for viral infections is a 
major driver of increasing antibiotic resistance. Proper diagnosis of 
infectious syndromes in this environment must involve laboratory 
tests to determine the etiology and thus inform the proper therapy.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of upper respiratory 
tract infections:
• Swabs are not recommended for otitis media or sinusitis. 
Submit an aspirate for culture.
• Most cases of otitis media can be diagnosed clinically and 
treated without culture support.
• Throat specimens require a firm, thorough sampling of the 
throat and tonsils, avoiding cheeks, gums, and teeth.
• Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria 
meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are not etiologic 
agents of acute pharyngitis and should not be identified or 
reported in throat cultures.
• Nasopharyngeal cultures cannot accurately predict the etio-
logic agent of sinusitis.
A. Otitis Media
Otitis media (OM) is the single most frequent condition caus-
ing pediatric patients to be taken to a healthcare provider and 
to be given antibiotics [86]. Acute OM with effusion is the

bBlood cultures should be performed at the discretion of the healthcare provider.
cNote that nucleic acid tests are not usually available locally and must be sent to a reference laboratory with a resulting longer turnaround time.
dThe laboratory should be alerted if Bartonella cultures will be requested so that appropriate media are available at the time the specimen arrives in the laboratory; even then, the yield 
of Bartonella culture is very low. When available, Bartonella nucleic acid testing is more sensitive. A portion of the specimen should be sent to the histopathology laboratory for H&E and

clinical variant of OM most likely to have a bacterial etiology 
and, as a result, most likely to benefit from antimicrobial ther-
apy [87, 88] (Table 16). Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable 
Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most 
common bacterial causes of OM, with S. aureus, Streptococcus 
pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurring less com-
monly [89]. Turicella otitidis and Staphylococcus auricularis 
are emerging pathogens thought to cause OM, but additional 
studies are needed to determine the true significance of these 
organisms [89, 90]. Chronic suppurative OM is associated with a 
higher rate of complications than acute OM. Pseudomonas aeru-
ginosa and S. aureus are the most common pathogens in chronic 
OM [91]. A variety of respiratory viruses are known to cause 
OM; however, there exists no pathogen specific therapy and as 
a result, there is little reason to attempt to establish an etiologic 
diagnosis in patients with a viral etiology. Efforts to determine 
the cause of OM are best reserved for patients likely to have a 
bacterial etiology (recent onset, bulging tympanic membrane, 
pain, or exudate) who have not responded to prior courses of 
antimicrobial therapy, patients with immunological deficiencies, 
and acutely ill patients [86, 88]. The only representative speci-
men is middle ear fluid obtained either by tympanocentesis or, 
in patients with otorrhea or myringotomy tubes, by collecting 
drainage on mini-tipped swabs directly after cleaning the ear 
canal. Cultures of the pharynx, nasopharynx, anterior nares, or 
nasal drainage material are of no value in attempting to establish 
an etiologic diagnosis of bacterial OM (Table 16) [92].
B. Sinusitis
Rhinosinusitis (the preferred term encompassing both acute 
and chronic disease) affects approximately 12%–15.2% of the 
adult population in the United States annually. The direct 
costs of managing acute and chronic rhinosinusitis exceed 
US$11 billion per year. The etiological agents of rhinosinus-
itis vary based upon the duration of symptoms and whether 
it is community acquired or of nosocomial origin (Table 17). 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable H. influenzae, and 
Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial causes 
of acute maxillary sinusitis. The role of respiratory viruses in 
sinusitis needs further study, but most patients with acute sinus-
itis have an upper respiratory virus detectable early in the illness 
[93]. Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli, Streptococcus 
spp, and anaerobic bacteria are associated more frequently with 
subacute, chronic, or healthcare-associated sinusitis [94]. The 
role of fungi as etiological agents is more controversial, possi-
bly due to numerous publications that used poor sample col-
lection methods and thus did not recover the fungal agents. In 
immunocompetent hosts, fungi are associated most often with

chronic sinusitis, though the significance of fungal presence in 
chronic sinusitis is frequently uncertain [93, 95, 96]. Invasive 
sinusitis due to fungal infections in severely immunocompro-
mised persons or uncontrolled diabetic patients is often severe 
and carries a high mortality rate.
Attempts to establish an etiologic diagnosis of sinusitis are 
typically reserved for patients with complicated infections or 
chronic disease (patients who are seriously ill, immunocom-
promised, continue to deteriorate clinically despite extended 
courses of antimicrobial therapy, or have recurrent bouts of 
acute rhinosinusitis with clearing between episodes). Swabs 
are not recommended for collecting sinus specimens since an 
aspirate is much more productive of the true etiologic agent(s) 
and is the specimen of choice. Endoscopically obtained swabs 
can recover bacterial pathogens but rarely detect the causa-
tive fungi [92, 97, 98]. In maxillary sinusitis, antral puncture 
with sinus aspiration (though seldom done) and, in adults, 
swabs of material draining from the middle meatus obtained 
under endoscopic guidance represent the only adequate spec-
imens. Cultures of middle meatus drainage specimens are not 
recommended for pediatric patients due to colonization with 
normal microbiota, which overlaps with potential respiratory 
tract pathogens. Examination of nasal drainage material is of 
no value in attempting to determine the cause of maxillary 
sinusitis. Surgical procedures are necessary to obtain specimens 
representative of infection of the frontal, sphenoid, or ethmoid 
sinuses. To establish a fungal etiology, an endoscopic sinus aspi-
rate is recommended [98] but is often unproductive for a fungal 
agent. Tissue biopsy may be more productive.
C. Pharyngitis
Acute pharyngitis accounts for roughly 1.3% of outpatient visits 
to healthcare providers in the United States and was responsible 
for 15 million patient visits in 2006 [99]. Most pharyngitis is 
viral and need not be treated, but 10%–15% of pharyngitis in 
adults and 15%–30% in children is due to group A streptococci 
[100]. Differences between the epidemiology of various infec-
tious agents related to the age of the patient, the season of the 
year, accompanying signs and symptoms, and the presence or 
absence of systemic disease are insufficient to establish a defin-
itive etiologic diagnosis on clinical and epidemiologic grounds 
alone [101]. Consequently, the results of laboratory tests play 
a central role in guiding therapeutic decisions (Table 18). 
Antimicrobial therapy is warranted only in patients with phar-
yngitis with a proven bacterial etiology [102].
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus) 
is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis and carries 
with it potentially serious sequelae, primarily in children, if left 
undiagnosed or inadequately treated. Several laboratory tests, 
including culture, rapid antigen tests, and molecular methods, 
have been used to establish an etiologic diagnosis of pharyngitis 
due to this organism [101, 103]. During the past few decades,

rapid antigen tests for S. pyogenes have been used extensively in 
the evaluation of patients with pharyngitis. Such tests are tech-
nically nondemanding, generally reliable, and often performed 
at the point of care. For any of these methods, accuracy and 
clinical relevance depend on appropriate sampling technique.
There is a consensus among the professional societies that 
negative rapid antigen tests for S. pyogenes in children should 
be confirmed by culture or molecular assay. Although this is 
generally not necessary for negative test results in adults due 
to the lower risk of complications, new guidelines suggest that 
either conventional culture or confirmation of negative rapid 
antigen test results by culture should be used to achieve maxi-
mal sensitivity for diagnosis of S. pyogenes pharyngitis in adults 
[103]. Laboratories accredited by the College of American 
Pathologists are required to back up negative rapid antigen 
tests with culture. Rapid, Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA)–waived methods for molecular group 
A Streptococcus testing provide improved sensitivity and may 
not require culture confirmation [104, 105], though they have 
not yet been incorporated into consensus guidelines.
The role of non–group A β-hemolytic streptococci, in partic-
ular, groups C and G, as causes of pharyngitis is controversial.

aA rapid antigen test for Streptococcus pyogenes may be performed at the point of care by healthcare personnel or transported to the laboratory for performance of the test. There are 
numerous commercially available direct antigen tests. These vary in terms of sensitivity and ease of use; the specific test employed will dictate the swab transport system used. In pediatric 
patients, if the direct antigen test is negative, and if the direct antigen test is known to have a sensitivity of <80%, a second throat swab should be examined by a more sensitive direct 
NAAT or by culture as a means of arbitrating possible false-negative direct antigen test results [102]. This secondary testing is not necessarily required in adults [103]. A convenient means 
of facilitating this 2-step algorithm of testing for Streptococcus pyogenes in pediatric patients is to collect a dual swab initially, recognizing that the second swab will be discarded if the 
direct antigen test is positive.
bDirect and amplified NAATs for Streptococcus pyogenes are more sensitive than direct antigen tests and, as a result, negative direct NAAT results do not have to be arbitrated by a sec-
ondary test. The swab transport device should be compatible with the NAAT used. Direct nucleic acid probe tests are usually performed on enriched broth cultures, thus requiring longer 
turnaround times. Some amplified tests for point-of-care use are quite rapid.
cDetection of group C and G β-hemolytic streptococci is accomplished by throat culture in those patients in whom there exists a concern for an etiologic role for these organisms. Only large 
colony types are identified, as tiny colonies demonstrating groups C and G antigens are in the Streptococcus anginosus (S. milleri) group. Check with the laboratory to determine if these 
are routinely looked for.
dArcanobacterium haemolyticum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Corynebacterium diphtheria cause pharyngitis only in limited epidemiologic settings. The laboratory will not routinely recover 
these organisms from throat swab specimens. If a clinical suspicion exists for one of these pathogens, the laboratory should be notified so that appropriate measures can be applied.
eUse of NAAT for detecting gonorrhea in throat specimens is currently an off-label use of this test but may be validated for use in the laboratory.
fIf the Monospot test is positive, it may be considered diagnostic for EBV infection. Up to 10% of Monospot tests are, however, falsely negative. False-negative Monospot tests are encoun-
tered most often in younger children but may occur at any age. In a patient with a strong clinical suspicion for EBV infection and a negative Monospot test, a definitive diagnosis can be 
achieved with EBV-specific serologic testing. Such testing can be performed on the same sample that yielded a negative Monospot test. Alternatively, the Monospot test can be repeated 
on a serum specimen obtained 7–10 days later, at which time, if the patient had EBV infection, the Monospot is more likely to be positive. See Section XIV on viral diagnostics.
gProbable cause of pharyngitis only in immunocompromised patients. Numerous rapid tests based on detecting HSV-specific antigen (by direct fluorescent antibody) directly in clinical mate-
rial have been developed; the nonspecific stain Tzanck test is very insensitive and is not recommended. A swab should be used to aggressively collect material from the base of multiple 
pharyngeal lesions, and then placed in a swab transport device which is compatible with the test to be performed. Culture may be useful in immunocompromised patients.
hHSV serology is useful primarily for immunostatus and exposure status testing. IgM serology is no longer recommended.

However, many healthcare providers consider these organisms 
to be of significance and base therapeutic decisions on their de-
tection. Rare cases of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis after 
infection with these species have been reported. Therefore, we 
have included guidance for detecting group C and G β-hemo-
lytic streptococci (large colony producers, since Streptococcus 
anginosus group, characteristically yielding pinpoint colonies, 
does not cause pharyngitis) in pharyngeal swab specimens, 
but indicate that this should be done only in settings in which 
these organisms are considered to be of significance, such as 
outbreaks of epidemiologically associated cases of pharyngitis. 
Recovery of the same organism from multiple patients during 
an outbreak should be investigated. Arcanobacterium haemo-
lyticum also causes pharyngitis but less commonly. It occurs 
most often in teenagers and young adults and causes a highly 
suggestive scarlatina-form rash in some patients. Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, in very specific 
patient and epidemiologic settings, may also cause pharyngitis 
[100].
Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of pharyngi-
tis in both adult and pediatric populations; however, it is unnec-
essary to define a specific etiology in patients with pharyngitis 
due to respiratory viruses since there exists no pathogen-di-
rected therapy for these agents. HSV, HIV, and Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) may also cause pharyngitis. Because of the epi-
demiologic and clinical implications of infection due to HSV, 
HIV, and EBV, circumstances may arise in which it is important 
to attempt to determine if an individual patient’s infection is 
caused by one of these 3 agents [100].
Recent studies have shown a relationship between 
Fusobacterium necrophorum and pharyngitis in some patients. 
In this case, throat infection could be a prelude to Lemierre syn-
drome. Fusobacterium necrophorum is an anaerobic organism 
and, as such, will require additional media and the use of anaer-
obic isolation and identification procedures, which most labo-
ratories are not prepared to use with throat specimens. Notify 
the laboratory of the suspected diagnosis and the etiologic agent 
so that appropriate procedures can be available. In the absence 
of anaerobic capability of the laboratory, this would be sent out 
to a reference laboratory [106–108].
VI. LOWER RESPIRATORY 
TRACT INFECTIONS
Respiratory tract infections are among the most common infec-
tious diseases. The list of causative agents continues to expand 
as new pathogens and syndromes are recognized. This section 
describes the major etiologic agents and the microbiologic 
approaches to the diagnosis of bronchitis and bronchiolitis; 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); hospital-acquired 
pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia 
(VAP); infections of the pleural space; bronchopulmonary 
infections in patients with cystic fibrosis; and pneumonia in the 
immunocompromised host. The reader is referred to various 
practice guidelines that have been written in recent years by the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Thoracic 
Society, and the American Society for Microbiology, among 
other clinical practice groups that describe the clinical features, 
diagnostic approaches, and patient management aspects of 
many of these syndromes.
The table below summarizes some important caveats when 
obtaining specimens for the diagnosis of respiratory infections.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of lower respiratory 
tract infections:
• NAATs have largely replaced rapid antigen tests and culture 
for respiratory virus detection.
• The laboratory should be contacted for specific instructions 
prior to collection of specimens for fastidious pathogens such 
as Bordetella pertussis.
• First morning expectorated sputum is always best for bacte-
rial culture.
• Blood cultures that accompany sputum specimens may occa-
sionally be helpful, particularly in high-risk patients with 
CAP.
• The range of pathogens causing exacerbations of lung dis-
ease in cystic fibrosis patients has expanded, and specimens 
for mycobacterial and fungal cultures should be collected in 
some patients.
• In the immunocompromised host, a broad diagnostic 
approach based upon invasively obtained specimens is 
suggested.
• Bronchoscopy with washings is the optimal diagnostic speci-
men in pediatrics.
A. Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis
Table 19 lists the etiologic agents and diagnostic approaches for 
bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation of chronic 
bronchitis, and pertussis, clinical syndromes that involve inflam-
mation of the tracheobronchial tree [109, 110]. Bronchiolitis 
is the most common lower respiratory infection in children 
[109, 110]. Viruses, alone or in combination, constitute the 
major causes of the syndrome characterized by bronchospasm 
(wheezing) resulting from acute inflammation, airway edema, 
and increased mucus production [109, 110]. Acute bronchitis 
is largely due to viral pathogens and is less frequently caused by 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Pertussis, 
classically known as whooping cough, caused by Bordetella per-
tussis, should be considered in an adolescent or young adult 
with paroxysmal cough. NAATs in combination with culture 
are the recommended tests of choice for B. pertussis detection. 
Currently there are a few FDA-cleared platforms for B. pertus-
sis detection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) has suggested best practices when using molecular tests 
for pertussis detection (https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/
diagnostic-testing/diagnosis-pcr-bestpractices.html).

aViruses are listed in decreasing order of frequency [110].
bSeveral US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared NAAT platforms are currently available and vary in their approved specimen requirements and range of analytes detected. Readers 
should check with their laboratory regarding availability and performance characteristics including certain limitations.
cRapid antigen tests for respiratory virus detection lack sensitivity and depending upon the product, specificity. A recent meta-analysis of rapid influenza antigen tests showed a pooled 
sensitivity of 62.3% and a pooled specificity of 98.2% [130]. They should be considered as screening tests only. At a minimum, a negative result should be verified by another method. 
Specimen quality is critical to optimize these tests.
dSpecimen type depends upon the virus that is sought. In general, throat swabs are at the least desirable. Care should be taken to preserve cells by using VTM or transporting specimens 
in a sterile container on wet ice as soon as possible after collection.
eThere are several FDA-cleared assays available at this time. Two assays are comprehensive multiplex panels that contain Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae as part of a 
comprehensive respiratory syndromic panel. 
There is one singleplex assay for M. pneumoniae. Availability is laboratory specific. Clinicians should check with the laboratory for validated spec-
imen sources, collection and transport, performance characteristics, and turnaround time. In general, avoid calcium alginate swabs and mini-tipped swabs for nucleic acid amplification tests.
fSensitivity in nonbacteremic patients with pneumococcal pneumonia is 52%–78%; sensitivity in bacteremic cases of pneumococcal pneumonia is 80%–86%; specificity in adults is >90%. 
However, studies have reported a 21%–54% false-positive rate in children with NP carriage and no evidence of pneumonia and adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [128, 131].
gCotton-tipped or calcium alginate swabs are not acceptable as they contain substances that inhibit polymerase chain reaction.
hPlating of specimens at the bedside is ideal but rarely done. Several types of transport media are acceptable. These include Casamino acid solution, Amies transport medium, and Regan-
Lowe transport medium (Hardy Diagnostics) [132].

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae do 
not play an established role in acute bronchitis but they, along 
with Moraxella catarrhalis, do figure prominently in cases of 
acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Several FDA-approved 
NAAT platforms are available for the detection of a broad range 
of respiratory viruses and some of the “atypical bacteria” asso-
ciated with respiratory syndromes. These have largely replaced 
rapid antigen detection tests and culture in most institutions. 
Performance characteristics vary among the various panels and 
singleplex NAATs. Specimen sources may also vary depending 
upon the assay. Readers should become familiar with the plat-
forms offered in their respective institutions and the approved 
specimen sources, collection devices, and transport require-
ments. Respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human 
metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, and type 3 parainflu-
enza virus are significant causes of bronchiolitis in infants and 
young children [111]. Coinfections are not uncommon and 
have been observed in up to 30% of cases. Several molecular 
panels for the detection of bacterial causes of pneumonia and 
their resistance markers are currently in clinical trials.
B. Community-Acquired Pneumonia
The diagnosis of CAP is based on the presence of specific symp-
toms and suggestive radiographic features, such as pulmonary 
infiltrates and/or pleural effusion. Carefully obtained microbio-
logical data can support the diagnosis, but often fails to provide 
an etiologic agent. Table 20 lists the more common causes of 
CAP. Other less common etiologies may need to be considered 
depending upon recent travel history or exposure to vectors or 
animals that transmit zoonotic pathogens such as Sin Nombre 
virus (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) or Yersinia pestis 
(pneumonic plague, endemic in the western United States).
The rationale for attempting to establish an etiology is that 
identification of a pathogen will focus the antibiotic manage-
ment for a particular patient [112]. In addition, identification 
of certain pathogens such as Legionella spp, influenza viruses, 
and the agents of bioterrorism have important public health 
significance. IDSA/American Thoracic Society (ATS) practice 
guidelines (currently under revision) consider diagnostic test-
ing as optional for the patient who is not hospitalized [113]. 
Those patients who require admission should have pretreat-
ment blood cultures, culture and Gram stain of good-quality 
samples of expectorated sputum and, if disease is severe, uri-
nary antigen tests for S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoph-
ila where available. The recommendations for children are in 
agreement with the adult recommendations with respect to 
when to obtain blood cultures and sputum cultures but dif-
fer slightly for other laboratory tests [114]. Testing for viral 
pathogens is recommended in both outpatient and inpatient 
settings [114]. Although a weak recommendation, in children 
with appropriate signs and symptoms, Mycoplasma pneumoniae 
testing is indicated. There are several molecular assays available 
for M. pneumoniae detection [114] and at least one assay that 
also detects Chlamydia pneumoniae. Urinary antigen testing for 
S. pneumoniae detection is not recommended for use in chil-
dren because of the poor specificity of the test [114].
Laboratories must have a mechanism in place for screen-
ing sputum samples for acceptability (to exclude those that are 
heavily contaminated with oropharyngeal microbiota and not 
representative of deeply expectorated samples) prior to setting 
up routine bacterial culture. Poor-quality specimens provide 
misleading results and should be rejected because interpre-
tation would be compromised. Endotracheal aspirates or 
bronchoscopically obtained samples (including “mini–broncho-
alveolar lavage” [BAL] using the Combicath [KOL Bio Medical 
Instruments, Chantilly, Virginia] or similar technology) may be 
required in the hospitalized patient who is intubated or unable 
to produce an adequate sputum sample. A thoracentesis should 
be performed in the patient with a pleural effusion.
Mycobacterial infections should be in the differential diagno-
sis of CAP that fails to respond to therapy for the typical CAP 
pathogens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, although declining in 
the United States in recent years, is still an important pathogen 
among immigrant populations. Mycobacterium avium complex 
is also important, not just among patients with HIV, but espe-
cially in patients with chronic lung disease or cystic fibrosis, and 
in middle-aged or elderly thin women [115].
C. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia
Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonias (HAP 
and VAP, respectively) are frequently caused by multidrug-re-
sistant gram-negative bacteria or other bacterial pathogens. 
Aside from respiratory viruses that may be nosocomially trans-
mitted, viruses and fungi are rare causes of HAP and VAP in the 
immunocompetent patient. Table 21 lists the organisms most 
commonly associated with pneumonia in the immunocompe-
tent patient with HAP or VAP.
The 2016 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend noninvasive 
sampling of the respiratory tract for both HAP and VAP [116]. 
In the nonventilated patient, the specimens could include those 
obtained by spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, or 
nasotracheal suction in an uncooperative patient and, in the 
ventilated patient, endonasotracheal aspirates are preferred 
[116]. Determining the cause of the pneumonia relies upon ini-
tial Gram stain and semi-quantitative cultures of endotracheal 
aspirates or sputum. A smear lacking inflammatory cells and 
a culture absent of potential pathogens have a very high nega-
tive predictive value. Cultures of endotracheal aspirates, while 
likely to contain the true pathogen, also consistently grow more 
mixtures of species of bacteria than specimens obtained by 
bronchoscopic techniques. This may lead to additional unnec-
essary antibiotic therapy. Quantitative assessment of invasively 
obtained samples such as BAL fluid and protected speci-
men brush specimens is often performed [116]. Quantities of

bacterial growth above a threshold are diagnostic of pneumonia 
and quantities below that threshold are more consistent with 
colonization. The generally accepted thresholds are as follows: 
endotracheal aspirates, 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL; 
BAL fluid, 104 CFU/mL; protected specimen brush samples, 
103 CFU/mL [116]. Quantitative studies require extensive lab-
oratory work and special procedures that smaller laboratories 
may not accommodate and are therefore not endorsed by the 
guidance despite studies that show decreased antibiotic utiliza-
tion with quantitative cultures [116]. Bronchial washes are not 
appropriate for routine bacterial culture.
D. Infections of the Pleural Space
An aging population, among other factors, has resulted in 
an increase in the incidence of pleural infection [117]. The 
infectious causes of pleural effusions differ between com-
munity-acquired and hospital-acquired disease. In a large 
multicenter study (MIST1) of 454 adult patients with pleural 
infection to assess streptokinase treatment, the major patho-
gens recovered in decreasing order of frequency were S. angi-
nosus group, S. aureus, anaerobic bacteria, other streptococci, 
Enterobacteriaceae, and S. pneumoniae [118]. Among patients 
with hospital-acquired infection, S. aureus tops the list, with 
at least half of them being methicillin resistant, followed by 
Enterobacteriaceae, the streptococci (anginosus group, S. pneu-
moniae), Enterococcus spp, and anaerobes [118, 119]. Table 22 
summarizes the major pathogens. Any significant accumu-
lation of fluid in the pleural space should be sampled by tho-
racentesis. Specimens should be hand carried immediately to 
the laboratory or placed into appropriate anaerobic transport 
media for transport. In some institutions, bedside inoculation 
into blood culture bottles has become an established practice. 
This is acceptable and has been shown to increase the sensitivity 
by 20% [119]. The manufacturer’s guidelines should be followed 
with respect to the volume inoculated and whether supplemen-
tation is required to enhance recovery of fastidious pathogens

bThere are several US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared assays available at this time. 
Two assays are multiplex panels that contain Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneu-
moniae as part of a comprehensive respiratory syndromic panel. There is one singleplex assay for M. pneumoniae. Availability is laboratory specific. Clinicians should check with the labora-
tory for validated specimen sources, collection and transport, performance characteristics, and turnaround time. In general, avoid calcium alginate swabs and mini-tipped swabs for NAATs.
cSeveral FDA-cleared NAAT platforms are currently available and vary in their approved specimen requirements and range of analytes detected. Readers should check with their laboratory 
regarding availability and performance characteristics, including certain limitations.
dSensitivity of NAAT with smear negative, culture positive is only 50%–80% (Updated Guidelines for Use of NAATs for Diagnosis of Tuberculosis. Morb Mortal Wkly Rept (MMWR) 2009;

such as S. pneumoniae. If blood culture bottles are used, an addi-
tional sample should be sent to the microbiology laboratory for 
Gram stain and culture of nonbacterial pathogens when indi-
cated. Even when optimum handling occurs, cultures may fail 
to yield an organism. Laboratory-developed NAATs targeting 
pneumococcal genes, such as those that encode pneumolysin 
and autolysin, in fluid from pediatric cases of pleural infection, 
have been very useful [117].
Fluid should be sent for cell count, pH, protein, glucose, lac-
tate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cholesterol. These values assist 
with the determination of a transudative or exudative process 
and in the subsequent management of the syndrome. A recent 
meta-analysis showed that the best predictors of an exudate were 
pleural fluid cholesterol level >55 mg/dL and an LDH >200 U/L 
or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol >0.3 
[120]. Most infections result in an exudate or polymorphonu-
clear leucocytes (PMNs) (empyema) within the pleural cavity. 
When tuberculosis or a fungal pathogen is thought to be the 
likely cause, a pleural biopsy sent for culture and histopathology 
increases the diagnostic sensitivity. Always notify the laboratory 
of a suspicion of tuberculosis so that appropriate safety pre-
cautions can be employed. The recently published IDSA/ATS/
CDC guidelines on the diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and 
children “weakly recommends” the measurement of adenosine

deaminase (ADA) and free interferon-λ (IFN-λ) in pleural fluid. 
This endorsement is based upon a sensitivity and specificity of 
ADA of ≥79% and ≥83%, respectively, as determined by several 
meta-analyses [121]. The figures for free IFN-λ were ≥89% and 
≥97% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively [121]. It should 
be stressed that the quality of evidence is low and both markers 
should be used in conjunction with hematologic and chemical 
parameters and other diagnostic tests such as NAAT, culture, 
and histology of a pleural biopsy. The performance of ADA in 
developed countries has been shown to be quite variable and is 
related to multiple factors including the type of method used, the 
likelihood of tuberculosis, and “false positive” results in patients 
with other causes of lymphocytic pleural effusion such as rheu-
matoid disease, mesothelioma, and histoplasmosis [122].
E. Pulmonary Infections in Cystic Fibrosis
Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic lung 
infections due to disruption of exocrine function that does 
not allow them to clear microorganisms that enter the distal 
airways of the lung. The spectrum of organisms associated 
with disease continues to expand and studies of the microbi-
ome demonstrate the complex synergy between easily culti-
vatable and noncultivatable organisms. Table 23 lists the most 
frequently isolated pathogens in this patient population. Early 
in childhood, infections are caused by organisms frequently 
seen in the non-CF pediatric population such as S. pneumo-
niae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. Of these organisms, methi-
cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has significantly 
increased in prevalence [123]. At some point, later in childhood 
or adolescence, P. aeruginosa becomes the most important 
pathogen involved in chronic lung infection and the concom-
itant lung destruction that follows. The P. aeruginosa strains 
adapt to the hypoxic stress of the retained mucoid secretions 
by converting to a biofilm mode of growth (mucoid colonies). 
Nosocomial pathogens such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 
Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Achromobacter ruhlandii 
may be acquired during a hospital or clinic visit. Burkholderia 
cepacia complex is a very important pathogen in these patients.

Burkholderia cenocepacia is highly pathogenic and is respon-
sible for rapid decline and death in a subset of patients who 
acquire the virulent clones. Special microbiological techniques 
are required to recover and differentiate B. cepacia complex 
from the mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. Less common gram-neg-
ative organisms that appear to be increasing in their frequency 
of recovery, but whose role in the pathogenesis of CF lung dis-
ease is still unclear, include Burkholderia gladioli, Ralstonia spp, 
Cupriavidus spp, Inquilinus spp, and Pandoraea [124, 125]. The 
reader is referred to the Parkins and Floto reference for a dis-
cussion of pathogens within the CF microbiota [123].
As CF patients have survived into adulthood, opportunistic 
pathogens such as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have 
been isolated with increasing frequency, ranging in prevalence 
from 6% to up to 30% in patients aged >40 years [123]. The 
M. avium complex and the Mycobacterium abscessus complex 
are the most commonly encountered NTM [123]. There is evi-
dence to suggest that both M. abscessus and M. avium complex 
contribute to lung destruction and should be treated when cul-
tures are repeatedly positive. Mycobacterial culture should be 
added to the routine cultures obtained from patients >15 years 
of age who present with exacerbations, as the incidence of 
Mycobacterium spp is likely underestimated due to failure to 
routinely assess patients for these organisms [124].
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common fungus recovered 
from CF patients, in whom it causes primarily allergic bron-
chopulmonary disease. Scedosporium apiospermum may cause 
a similar syndrome. Exophiala dermatitidis has been reported 
by some centers to cause chronic colonization of the CF airway 
[124]. Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans is a pathogen that has a 
propensity to cause disease in patients with CF [125]. Table 23 
summarizes the organisms most likely to cause exacerbation of 
pulmonary symptoms in CF patients [115, 123–127]. While a 
number of environmental nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli 
are frequently recovered from the sputum of these patients, 
their role in CF lung disease is either unknown at this time or 
unlikely to be of significance. These organisms have not been 
included in the table. Laboratories should spend resources on 
those pathogens proven or likely to play a significant role in pul-
monary decline in these patients.
F. Pneumonia in the Immunocompromised Host
Advances in cancer treatments, transplantation immunology, 
and therapies for autoimmune diseases and HIV have expanded 
the population of severely immunocompromised patients. 
Pulmonary infections are the most common syndromes con-
tributing to severe morbidity and mortality among these groups 
of patients.
Virtually any potential pathogen may result in significant ill-
ness, and the challenge for both clinicians and microbiologists 
is to rapidly differentiate infectious from noninfectious causes 
of pulmonary infiltrates. The likelihood of a specific infection 
may be affected by recently administered prophylaxis. Table 24 
focuses on the major infectious etiologies likely to be of interest 
in most immunocompromised hosts [128]. Patients are still vul-
nerable to the usual bacterial and viral causes of CAP and HAP. 
In addition, fungi, herpesviruses, and protozoa play a more sig-
nificant role and should be considered.
When rapid and noninvasive tests such as urine or serum anti-
gen tests and rapid viral diagnostics are not revealing, more defini-
tive procedures to sample the lung are required. Several diagnostic 
procedures can be performed, but usually the patient initially 
undergoes bronchoscopy with BAL with or without transbron-
chial biopsy. When an infiltrate is focal, it is important to wedge 
the scope in the pulmonary segment corresponding to the abnor-
mality on radiographs; otherwise, in diffuse disease, the scope is 
usually wedged in the right middle lobe or lingula. It is suggested 
that microbiology laboratories, in collaboration with infectious 
diseases physicians and pulmonologists, develop an algorithm for 
processing samples that includes testing for all major categories 
of pathogens as summarized in the table. Cytologic analysis and/
or histopathology are often needed to interpret the significance of 
positive NAAT or culture for herpesviruses, for example, and to 
definitively diagnose filamentous fungi. It should be noted, how-
ever, that histopathology alone is not sensitive enough to diagnose 
fungal infections and should be accompanied by immunostain, 
culture, and, when available, NAATs [128, 129]. In addition, serum 
and BAL galactomannan and serum 1–3 β-d-glucan tests may be 
helpful. However, cytology and/or histopathology are quite useful 
for distinguishing conditions such as pulmonary hemorrhage and 
rejection from infectious causes of infiltrates. Transthoracic nee-
dle aspiration, computed tomography–guided biopsies of pleu-
ral-based lesions, and open lung likewise may be considered if less 
invasive diagnostics are unrevealing.
VII. INFECTIONS OF 
THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
Gastrointestinal infections include a wide variety of disease 
presentations as well as infectious agents. For many of these 
infections, particularly noninflammatory diarrhea and acute 
gastroenteritis of short duration, no laboratory testing is recom-
mended [135]. This section addresses the laboratory approach 
to establishing an etiologic diagnosis of esophagitis, gastritis, 
gastroenteritis, and proctitis.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of gastrointestinal 
infections:
• The specimen of choice to diagnose diarrheal illness is the 
diarrheal stool, not a formed stool or a swab, with a notable 
exception in pediatrics where a swab is acceptable when feces 
is noted on the swab.
• Toxin or nucleic acid amplification testing for C. difficile 
should only be done on diarrheal stool, not formed stools, 
unless the physician notes that the patient has ileus.

A. Esophagitis
Esophagitis is most often caused by noninfectious conditions, 
such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. Infectious causes are 
often seen in patients with impaired immunity (Table 25). 
Fungal microscopy with Calcofluor or potassium hydroxide 
(KOH) or bacterial examination by Gram stain of esophageal 
brushings with histopathological examination and viral culture 
of esophageal biopsies will establish the diagnosis in most cases.
B. Gastritis
Helicobacter pylori is associated with atrophic gastritis, peptic 
ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. Diagnosis of H. pylori infec-
tion is critical as treatment can decrease morbidity. Testing is 
recommended for all patients with peptic ulcer disease, gas-
tric mucosa–associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and early 
gastric cancer. In some patients with dyspepsia, noninvasive 
testing is an option [136]. Both invasive and noninvasive tests 
(Table 26) are available to aid in the diagnosis [137]. Invasive 
tests such as Gram stain and culture of endoscopy tissue, his-
topathologic staining, and direct tests for urease require the 
collection of biopsy samples obtained during endoscopy from 
patients who have not received antimicrobial agents or pro-
ton pump inhibitors in the 2 weeks prior to collection and, 
as such, pose greater risks to the patient. Culture, although 
not routinely performed, allows for antimicrobial suscepti-
bility testing. The advantage to the noninvasive assays such 
as the urea breath test and stool antigen determinations is 
that patients can avoid endoscopy and gastric biopsy. They 
are also useful to test for organism eradication after therapy. 
Collection of specimens for the urea breath test may be per-
formed in the clinic. This assay has a sensitivity of approxi-
mately 95%, comparable to the invasive assays. Stool antigen 
tests have a reported sensitivity of 88%–98%, with sensitiv-
ity being higher in adults than in children. The noninvasive 
assays are also useful to test for organism eradication after 
therapy, the urea breath test having a somewhat higher sensi-
tivity than stool antigen detection. Serodiagnosis has a lower 
sensitivity (<90%) and specificity (90%) and is not useful for 
test of cure after therapy.
C. Gastroenteritis, Infectious, and Toxin-Induced Diarrhea
Gastrointestinal infections encompass a wide variety of symp-
toms and recognized infectious agents (Table 27). The appro-
priate diagnostic approach to diarrheal illness is determined 
by the patient’s age and status, severity of disease, duration 
and type of illness, time of year, and geographic location. 
Fecal testing using culture or culture-independent methods 
is indicated for severe, bloody, febrile, dysenteric, nosoco-
mial, or persistent diarrheal illnesses [138]. Communication 
with the laboratory is required to determine what organisms, 
methods, and screening parameters are included as part of 
the routine enteric pathogen culture or culture-independent 
method. Most laboratories will have the ability to culture for 
Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter and test for Shiga 
toxin–producing Escherichia coli. Culture independent meth-
ods are often routinely available for Clostridium difficile and, 
although available, may not be routinely employed for other 
bacterial and viral causes of gastrointestinal infections. Stool 
culture often fails to detect the causative agent and, when 
necessary, culture-independent methods are recommended 
as adjunct methods. The specimen of choice is the diarrheal 
stool (ie, takes the shape of the container). Multiple stool spec-
imens are rarely indicated for the detection of stool pathogens. 
In studies of adult patients who submitted >1 specimen, the 
enteric pathogen was detected in the first sample 87%–94% 
of the time, with the second specimen bringing the positive 
rate up to 98% [139]. In pediatric patients, the first specimen 
detects 98% of the enteric pathogens [140]. Thus, one sample 
for children and a second for selected adult patients may be 
considered. Rectal swabs are less sensitive than stool speci-
mens when culture methods are employed and are not recom-
mended for culture from adults, but in symptomatic pediatric 
patients, rectal swabs and stool culture are equivalent in the 
ability to detect fecal pathogens [141, 142]. Rectal swabs have

been shown to be as sensitive as stool specimens when cul-
ture independent methods are employed, although no tests are 
FDA-cleared for their use.
Stool Culture
Stool culture is indicated for detection of invasive bacterial 
enteric pathogens. When culture methods are employed, 
most laboratories routinely detect Salmonella, Shigella, and 
Campylobacter and, more recently, Shiga toxin–producing 
E. coli in all stools submitted for culture. Salmonella spp 
can take 24–72 hours to recover and identify to genus alone 
with the specific serotyping usually performed at the pub-
lic health laboratory level. It is recommended that tests for 
the detection of Shiga toxin, or tests to specifically detect 
Shiga toxin–producing E. coli O157:H7 or other Shiga 
toxin–producing serotypes, be included as part of the rou-
tine test. However, in some settings, these tests may require 
a specific request. Tests that detect only E. coli O157:H7 
will not detect the increasing number of non-O157 isolates 
being reported and may not detect all E. coli O157:H7 [143]. 
Screening algorithms that limit testing to bloody stools may 
also miss both O157 and non-O157 isolates. Screening of 
stool for toxin-producing E. coli is recommended for all 
pediatric patients.
Detection of Vibrio and Yersinia in the United States is usually 
a special request and requires additional media or incubation 
conditions. Communication with the laboratory is necessary. 
Laboratory reports should indicate which of the enteric patho-
gens would be detected. Laboratories are encouraged to pro-
vide enteric pathogen isolates to their public health laboratory 
and/or the CDC for pulsed-field gel analysis or whole-genomic 
sequencing for national surveillance purposes. Culture meth-
ods must be used for test of cure.
Selective use of multiplex NAATs for stool pathogens is very 
sensitive and, when positive for reportable agents, should either 
be cultured to recover the isolate or the stool provided to public 
health laboratories to culture, for epidemiologic follow-up.
Culture-Independent Methods
Culture independent methods are becoming increasingly avail-
able. Nucleic acid amplification assays vary from singleplex 
to highly multiplexed assays. It is imperative to communicate 
with the laboratory to determine what organisms are detected. 
Culture independent methods can detect pathogens in as little 
as 1–5 hours compared to the 24–96 hours often required for 
culture. These assays are reported to be more sensitive than cul-
ture and have resulted in much higher rates of detection [144]. 
Highly multiplexed assays allow for the detection of mixed 
infections, where the importance of each pathogen is unclear, 
and they may allow for the detection of pathogens, such as 
enteroaggregative E. coli or sapovirus, where the indication for 
therapy is unclear. Culture-independent methods should not be 
used as test of cure as they will detect both viable and nonviable 
organisms.
Clostridium botulinum
Botulism is an intoxication in which a protein exotoxin, bot-
ulinum toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum causes a 
life-threatening flaccid paralysis. Diagnosis, while not usually 
confirmed by the hospital microbiology laboratory, is made 
by clinical criteria, allowing prompt initiation of essential 
antitoxin therapy. The microbiologic diagnosis is dependent 
upon detection of botulinum toxin in serum (in patients with 
wound, infant, and foodborne disease), stool (in patients with 
infant and foodborne disease), and gastric contents/vomitus (in 
patients with foodborne disease). Toxin detection is performed 
in many public health laboratories and at the CDC. Culture can 
be performed on both feces and wounds, but the yield is low 
and most laboratories lack the necessary expertise to isolate and 
identify this organism [145].
Clostridium difficile
Numerous methods have been employed for the laboratory 
diagnosis of infection caused by Clostridium difficile. Toxigenic 
culture is probably the most sensitive and specific of the assays

aThe patient ingests a cocktail containing 13C-labeled urea and 15–30 minutes later, a breath sample is obtained and analyzed for the presence of 13C-labeled CO2 as an indication of the 
presence of H. pylori in the stomach.
bGram stain and culture of properly collected and transported biopsy specimens has a sensitivity of 95% as does histopathological examination, but is usually unavailable and considered 
inappropriate by some.
cAgar-based or rapid urease tests have a slightly lower sensitivity of 90%–95% but offer the advantage of providing rapid results. They may be performed at the point of care or in the labo-
ratory. When these tests are performed on gastric fluid, orogastric brush, or “string” specimens, they have lower sensitivity than when performed on biopsy specimens.

for the detection of C. difficile, although detection of a toxigenic 
organism is not, in itself, specific for infection. It is slow and 
labor intensive and not routinely performed in the commu-
nity hospital setting. Compared to toxigenic culture, the cyto-
toxin assay has a sensitivity of 85%–90%. The cytotoxin assay 
requires 24–48 hours and is also labor intensive. Thus, toxin 
detection by either enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immuno-
chromatographic methods are widely used in clinical practice. 
These assays have reported sensitivity of 70%–85% but are sig-
nificantly faster with results available in <2 hours. Utilization 
of an assay that detects both toxin A and toxin B improves the 
sensitivity. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen assays 
are sensitive but have poor specificity. NAATs for the detec-
tion of C. difficile have reported sensitivity of 93%–100%. To 
reduce turnaround time, reduce costs, and improve accuracy 
of C. difficile–associated disease, some laboratories employ an 
algorithm that utilizes GDH as a rapid screening test, followed 
by (or simultaneous to, as part of the same test platform), EIA 
for toxin A and B detection with or without cytotoxin testing or 
NAAT to arbitrate discrepant GDH and EIA toxin results. These 
algorithms allow for both the rapid reporting of most negative 
specimens and the sensitivity of cytotoxin testing or NAAT, but 
could result in delays depending on the laboratory testing algo-
rithm employed [146–148]. NAAT detects viable and nonviable 
organisms. To decrease the identification of colonized patients, 
some laboratories are performing both NAAT tests and tests to 
detect toxin production. Diarrheal stool specimens (not formed 
stools or rectal swabs) are required for the diagnosis of C. dif-
ficile disease (not colonization). The specimen should be loose 
enough to take the shape of the container. Formed stools should 
be appropriately rejected by the laboratory but with the proviso 
that formed stools from patients with ileus, or potential toxic 
megacolon, as noted by the physician, should be tested. When 
testing is limited to patients not receiving laxatives and with 
unexplained and new-onset diarrhea (≥3 unformed stools in 24 
hours), NAAT alone, or toxin EIA as part of a multistep algo-
rithm (GDH plus toxin, GDH plus toxin arbitrated by NAAT, 
or NAAT plus toxin) are the recommended test options. When

aA routine stool culture in most laboratories is designed to detect Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Campylobacter spp, and Escherichia coli O157 or Shiga toxin–producing E. coli.

may be done only on specific request.
dAvailable as part of some multiplex panels.
eSpecialized cultures are required to detect these organisms in stool specimens. In many cases, such cultures are performed only in public health laboratories and only in the setting of an 
outbreak. The laboratory should be notified whenever there is a suspicion of infection due to one of these pathogens.
fBacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus cause diarrheal syndromes that are toxin mediated. An etiologic diagnosis is made by demonstration of toxin in stool. 
Toxin assays are either performed in public health laboratories or referred to laboratories specializing in such assays.
gTesting for Clostridium botulinum toxin is either performed in public health laboratories or referred to laboratories specializing in such testing. The toxin is lethal and special precautions are 
required for handling. Note that it is considered a bioterrorism agent and rapid sentinel laboratory reporting schemes must be followed. Immediate notification of a suspected case to the 
state health department is mandated. For this purpose, 24-hour hotlines are available.
hImplicated food materials may also be examined for C. botulinum toxin, but most hospital laboratories are not equipped for food analysis.
iThe role of Blastocystis hominis as a pathogen remains controversial. In the absence of other pathogens, it may be important where symptoms persist. Reporting semi-quantitative results 
(rare, few, many) can help determine significance and is a College of American Pathologists accreditation requirement for participating laboratories.
jDetection of Strongyloides in immunocompromised patients may require the use of Baermann technique or agar plate culture.
kCryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia testing is often offered and performed together as the primary parasitology examination. Further studies should follow if a travel history or clinical

there are no institutionally agreed upon limiting criteria for 
stool submission, toxin EIA, as part of a multistep algorithm 
as defined above, is recommended, not NAAT testing alone. 
Repeat testing of patients previously positive as a “test of cure” 
is not appropriate. Repeat testing of patients negative by NAATs 
should not be performed for at least 6 days [148, 149].
Because of the presence of asymptomatic carriage, routine 
testing should not be performed in children <2 years of age, 
particularly in those <1 year (infants) [150]. Toxigenic C. diffi-
cile colonizes nearly 50% of infants in the first year of life, with 
asymptomatic rates at around 2 years of age approaching those 
of healthy adults. The presence of diarrhea is difficult to assess 
in this age group as loose or unformed stool can be difficult to 
discriminate. However, there are data to suggest that C. diffi-
cile may be the cause of disease in some infants. For children 
<2 years of age, testing for other causes should be pursued first, 
with C. difficile testing being performed only if there is no alter-
native cause and the symptoms are severe or the clinical presen-
tation is consistent with C. difficile infection [151].
Since 2000, an increase in C. difficile–associated disease 
with increased morbidity and mortality has been reported in 
the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The epi-
demic strain is toxinotype III, North American pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE) type 1 (NAP1), and PCR ribotype 027 
(NAP1/027). It carries the binary toxin genes, cdtA and cdtB, 
and an 18-bp deletion in tcdC. It produces both toxin A and 
toxin B [152]. A commercially available FDA-cleared NAAT for 
binary toxin and the tcdC deletion genes identifies this strain 
for epidemiological purposes. The severity of disease is believed 
to be due to toxin hyperproduction [153]. The association of 
binary toxin with disease severity is controversial.
Parasites
The number of specimens to be submitted for parasitologic exam-
ination may be a controversial subject [154, 155]. Historically, 
when using conventional microscopic procedures, it was recom-
mended that 3 specimens collected over a 7- to 10-day period 
be submitted for ova and parasite (O&P) examination. Options 
for cost-effective testing today include examination of a second 
specimen only when the first is negative and the patient remains 
symptomatic, with a third specimen being submitted only if the 
patient continues to be O&P negative and symptomatic. Targeted 
use of immunoassay testing or NAAT for the most common par-
asites based on geography, patient demographics, and physician 
request can also be used as a screen, with only negative patients 
with continued symptoms or patients with specific risk factors 
requiring full O&P examination. Immunoassays for Giardia are 
sensitive enough that only a single specimen may be needed. No 
data are available on the number of specimens required to rule 
out infection when NAAT is performed.
The specimen preservative to be used, often supplied by 
the laboratory, depends on the need to perform immunoassay 
procedures or special stains or NAAT on the specimens and 
the manufacturer’s recommendations for specimen fixative. It 
is imperative that the laboratory be consulted to assure proper 
transport conditions are utilized. Polyvinyl alcohol is the 
gold standard for microscopic examination; however, due to 
the presence of mercuric chloride, modifications that do not 
employ mercury have been developed. None of these modified 
preservatives allow stains to provide the same level of micro-
scopic detail, although with experience, they are acceptable 
alternatives.
In routine procedures, pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica 
cannot be differentiated from nonpathogenic Entamoeba dispar 
using morphologic criteria, so the laboratory report may indi-
cate E. histolytica/dispar [156]. Only an immunoassay or NAAT 
can differentiate these organisms.
Viruses
Viral causes of gastroenteritis are often of short duration and 
self-limited. Viral shedding may persist after resolution of 
symptoms. Although included as part of some multiplex NAAT, 
testing is not routinely performed except in immunocompro-
mised patients, infection control purposes, or outbreak inves-
tigations. In immunocompromised hosts, laboratory testing 
for CMV should be considered, using a quantitative NAAT 
performed on plasma. Of note, a negative NAAT does not rule 
out the possibility of CMV disease, and repeat testing may be 
required.
D. Proctitis
Proctitis is most commonly due to sexually transmitted agents, 
a result of anal–genital contact, although abscesses or perirec-
tal wound infections may present with similar symptoms. One 
sample is usually sufficient for diagnosis (Table 28).
VIII. INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS
This section is designed to optimize the activities of the micro-
biology laboratory to achieve the best approach for the iden-
tification of microorganisms associated with peritonitis and 
intraperitoneal abscesses, hepatic and splenic abscesses, pan-
creatitis, and biliary tract infection. As molecular analyses 
begin to be used to define the microbiome of the gastrointes-
tinal and genitourinary tract, contemporary culture protocols 
will surely evolve to accommodate new, emerging information. 
The future use of gene amplification and sequencing for identi-
fication of microorganisms in these infections will likely show 
that for every organism currently identified by culture, there 
will be several times that number that cannot be cultivated 
using current technologies. To remain focused on contempo-
rary methods currently available in the diagnostic microbiol-
ogy laboratory, the tables outline the most likely agents of each 
entity (Table 29) and how best to evaluate the situation with 
existing techniques (Table 30).

Factors to consider when collecting specimens for laboratory 
diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections:
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of intra-abdominal 
infections:
• The laboratory needs the specimen, not a swab of the spec-
imen. Sufficient quantity of specimen must be collected to 
allow the microbiology laboratory to perform all the neces-
sary and requested tests.
• The specimen of choice for an abscess is a sample of the con-
tents plus a sample of the wall of the abscess when possible.
• Pus alone may not reveal the etiologic agent since the PMNs 
may have destroyed morphological evidence of microbial 
invasion.
• While most molecular tests have excellent sensitivity, a 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAAT test should be an adjunct 
to a culture and never ordered alone. No current commercial 
methods are FDA-cleared for intra-abdominal specimens, so 
laboratories must have validated the test they use.
• If M. tuberculosis is present, it is usually a sign of dissemi-
nated disease that must be thoroughly investigated.
A. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis and Ascites
In cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), the source 
of the invading organism(s) is unknown and the syndrome can 
also be seen in patients with preexisting risk factors such as cir-
rhosis with ascites [157, 158]. SBP is an ascitic fluid infection 
without an evident intra-abdominal focus, tends to be monomi-
crobic, and is usually caused by aerobic organisms from the 
intestinal tract; therefore, anaerobic cultures are less valuable. 
Sufficient fluid (eg, 10–50 mL if available) should be obtained to 
allow for concentration by centrifugation and a cytospin Gram 
stain evaluation. At a minimum, at least 10 mL of peritoneal 
fluid (not swabs of the fluid) should be collected aseptically 
and transported to the laboratory prior to the administration 
of antimicrobial agents. Additional laboratory testing should 
include fluid analysis for protein, cell count and differential, lac-
tate concentration, and pH along with 2–3 sets of blood cultures 
for the identification of concomitant bacteremia (Table 29). 
Alternatively, because SBP and infections of ascites fluid tend to 
be monomicrobic, an aerobic blood culture bottle can be inoc-
ulated with fluid (volume dependent upon blood culture sys-
tem) if the presence of a single organism is reasonably certain. 
A Gram stain may be used prior to broth inoculation to evaluate 
the morphology of any organism(s) present in the specimen. 
Since the differentiation between SBP and secondary peritoni-
tis may be uncertain, it may be beneficial to submit peritoneal 
fluid in a sterile container for conventional culture and stain 
as well as to inoculate blood culture bottles at the bedside with 
the fluid. Mass spectrometry, sequencing, and 16S PCR can 
be used to identify isolates present in these specimens if these 
techniques are available to the laboratory. In the next few years, 
next-generation sequencing will be able to analyze such spec-
imens to determine the total microbial load by species. If >1 
morphologic type is noted in the Gram stain, a broth should 
not be inoculated. The caveat for use of blood culture bottles 
with fluid other than blood is that not all systems have been 
evaluated for this purpose. Furthermore, broth cultures do not 
accurately reflect the bacterial burden or the variety of organ-
isms at the time the specimen is obtained, and the presence of 
a true pathogen may be obscured by the overgrowth of a more 
rapidly growing organism.
Negative culture results in the presence of other indicators 
of infection should prompt an evaluation for fastidious or 
slowly growing organisms such as Mycobacterium spp, fungi, 
Chlamydia trachomatis, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
B. Secondary Peritonitis
The diagnosis of secondary peritonitis is dependent upon 
identifying a source for invading microorganisms—usually 
genitourinary or gastrointestinal flora [158, 159]. There are 
numerous causes of secondary peritonitis including iatrogenic

or accidental trauma, perforated appendix or diverticuli, typh-
litis, or intra-abdominal abscess. Complications from bariatric 
surgery may also cause secondary peritonitis. Unlike SBP, how-
ever, secondary peritonitis tends to be polymicrobic and may 
include anaerobic flora. Organisms such as S. aureus, N. gon-
orrhoeae, and Mycobacterium spp are unusual in this setting. 
Common etiologies include aerobic and anaerobic gram-nega-
tive rods (Bacteroides spp, E. coli, Klebsiella spp) and gram-pos-
itive flora (Clostridium spp, Enterococcus spp, Bifidobacterium 
spp, Peptostreptococcus spp). Infectious complications following 
bariatric surgery are frequently due to gram-positive cocci and 
yeast (Candida spp). Since many obese patients have had prior 
exposure to antibiotics, multidrug-resistant organisms are of 
concern [160, 161]. If typhlitis is suspected, C. difficile toxin 
testing, stool cultures for enteric pathogens, and blood cultures 
should be requested. Additionally, Clostridium septicum should 
be considered in neutropenic enterocolitis.
Peritoneal fluid should be sent to the laboratory in an anaer-
obic transport system for Gram stain and aerobic and anaer-
obic bacterial cultures. Inoculation of blood culture bottles 
alone with peritoneal fluid is not appropriate in this setting, as 
competitive bacterial growth in broth cultures could mask the 
recovery of clinically important pathogens (Table 29). Because 
CMV is a possible cause of secondary peritonitis, the micro-
biology laboratory should be contacted to arrange for special 
processing if CMV is of concern. The microbiology laboratory 
should also be contacted if N. gonorrhoeae is of concern as 
special processing or NAAT (this specimen type has no FDA-
cleared commercial platform for testing) will be necessary.
Because of the polymicrobic nature of secondary peritonitis, 
clinicians and other healthcare providers should not expect or 
request identification and susceptibility testing of all organ-
isms isolated. Rather, the laboratory should provide a general 
description of the culture results (eg, mixed aerobic and anaer-
obic intestinal flora) and selective identification of certain 
organisms such as MRSA, β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp, multi-
drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, and vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci (VRE), etc) to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy 
[157, 158, 162]. Patients who do not respond to conventional 
therapy should have additional specimens collected to examine 
for resistant organisms or for the presence of intra-abdominal 
abscesses.
C. Tertiary Peritonitis
This entity refers to persistent or recurrent peritonitis following 
unsuccessful treatment of secondary peritonitis. Tertiary peri-
tonitis might also indicate the presence of an intra-abdominal 
abscess or organisms that are refractory to broad-spectrum 
antimicrobial therapy such as VRE, Candida spp, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, or biofilm-producing bacteria such as coagu-
lase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Fluid cultures from cases of 
tertiary peritonitis are commonly negative for bacteria [157].

aIf Gram stain reveals multiple morphologies of organisms, do not inoculate blood culture bottles with the fluid, as competitive bacterial growth could mask the recovery of clinically signif-
icant pathogens. If fluid is inoculated into blood culture bottles, a conventional culture must also be used. Anaerobic cultures of peritoneal fluid are only necessary in cases of secondary 
peritonitis.

In any case, cultures appropriate for spontaneous or secondary 
peritonitis may be helpful (Table 30). The possibility of infec-
tion caused by unusual or slowly growing organisms such as fil-
amentous fungi and Mycobacterium spp should be entertained 
if bacterial cultures are negative for growth. If culture results 
in growth of Mycobacterium spp, it may represent disseminated 
disease. However, AFB and parasitic studies would only rarely 
be considered.
D. Peritoneal Dialysis–Associated Peritonitis
The evaluation of dialysis fluid from patients with suspected 
peritoneal dialysis–associated peritonitis (PDAP) is essentially 
identical to that used for SBP. Infections tend to be monomicro-
bic and rarely anaerobic. In the case of PDAP, however, the list 
of likely suspect organisms is quite different from SBP. Gram-
positive bacteria (predominantly Staphylococcus spp and, to a 
lesser extent, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium spp) account 
for >60% of cultured microorganisms. Gram-negative bacteria 
(mostly E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter spp) represent <30% 
of positive cultures while anaerobes comprise <3% of isolates 
[158, 163, 164]. Fungi, especially Candida spp, contribute to 
the same number of identified infections as anaerobes [165]. 
Cultures can remain negative in >20% of all cases of PDAP [163]. 
Again, 10–50 mL of dialysate should be collected for concentra-
tion and culture, cytospin Gram stain evaluation, analysis for 
protein, and cell count and differential (Table 30). Blood cultures 
are rarely positive in cases of PDAP [158]. Direct inoculation of 
dialysate or a concentrated dialysate into an aerobic blood cul-
ture bottle for automated detection has proven to be as effective 
as direct plating of centrifuged fluid [164, 165]. Consult directly 
with the microbiology laboratory when primary cultures of fluid 
are negative and additional cultures for slowly growing or highly 
fastidious organisms such as Mycobacterium, Nocardia, and fil-
amentous fungi should be pursued. If Nocardia is of concern, 
primary culture plates require prolonged incubation or culture 
on fungal media or buffered charcoal yeast extract agar.
E. Space-Occupying Lesions of the Liver
The primary diagnostic dilemma for cases of space-occupy-
ing lesions of the liver is distinguishing those caused by para-
sites (E. histolytica and Echinococcus) from pyogenic abscesses 
caused by bacteria or fungi. The location, size, and number of 
liver abscesses is often not helpful for differentiation purposes 
as the majority are in the right lobe and can be seen in single 
or multiple loci [166–168]. In regions where E. histolytica dis-
ease is endemic, the use of serology or serum antigen detection 
tests can be helpful to exclude amebic abscess [169], whereas 
examination of stool for cysts and trophozoites is generally not 
(Table 30). Liver abscess aspirates can be tested for the presence 
of E. histolytica antigen as well as submitted for direct micro-
scopic evaluation for parasites. When amebic disease is unlikely, 
the abscess should be aspirated and the contents submitted in 
anaerobic transport for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. 
Commonly recovered isolates include Klebsiella spp, E. coli, 
and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus 
spp including Streptococcus anginosus group spp, Enterococcus 
spp, viridans group streptococci, S. aureus, Bacteroides spp, 
Fusobacterium spp (especially with Lemierre syndrome), 
Clostridium spp, and, rarely, Candida spp [166–168]. Aerobic 
and anaerobic bacterial culture should be requested (Table 30). 
Blood cultures can also be helpful in establishing an etiology if 
collected prior to the institution of antimicrobial therapy [167, 
168]. Occasionally, patients with primary genital infections 
due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis can have extension of 
the disease to involve the liver capsule or adjacent peritoneum 
(Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).
F. Infections of the Biliary Tree
Not unexpectedly, bacteria commonly associated with biliary 
tract infections (primarily cholecystitis and cholangitis) are the 
same organisms recovered from cases of pyogenic liver abscess 
(see above and Table 29). Parasitic causes include Ascaris and 
Clonorchis spp or any parasite that can inhabit the biliary tree 
leading to obstruction [166]. At a minimum, cultures for aero-
bic bacteria (anaerobes if the aspirate is collected appropriately) 
and Gram stain should be requested. When signs of sepsis and 
peritonitis are present, blood and peritoneal cultures should be 
obtained as well.
For patients with HIV infection, the list of potential agents 
and subsequent microbiology evaluations needs to be expanded 
to include Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, Cystoisospora 
(Isospora) belli, CMV, and M. avium complex [166]. As the 
identification of these organisms requires special processing, it 
is important to communicate with the laboratory to determine 
test availability either on-site or at a reference laboratory.
G. Splenic Abscess
Most cases of splenic abscess are the result of metastatic or 
contiguous infectious processes, trauma, splenic infarction, 
or immunosuppression [169]. Infection is most likely aerobic 
and monomicrobic with Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, 
Enterococcus spp, Salmonella spp, and E. coli commonly iso-
lated. Anaerobic bacteria have been recovered in 5%–17% of 
culture-positive cases [170]. Aspirates should be processed in 
a similar manner as pyogenic liver abscesses including aerobic 
and anaerobic culture, Gram stain, and concomitantly collected 
blood culture sets (Table 30). Unusual causes of splenic abscess 
include Bartonella spp, Brucella melitensis, Streptobacillus 
moniliformis, Nocardia spp, and Burkholderia pseudomallei 
(uncommon outside of Southeast Asia or without sugges-
tive travel history) [171]. The laboratory should be notified if 
B. melitensis or B. pseudomallei is possible due to the need for 
increased biosafety/security precautions since they are poten-
tial bioterrorism agents. As in biliary disease, the spectrum of

organisms to be considered needs to be expanded to include 
Mycobacterium spp, fungi (including Pneumocystis jirovecii), 
and parasites for immunocompromised patients [171].
H. Secondary Pancreatic Infection
Most cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis are produced by 
obstruction, autoimmunity, or alcohol ingestion [172, 173]. 
Necrotic pancreatic tissue generated by one of these pro-
cesses can serve as a nidus for infection [172, 173]. Infectious 
agents associated with acute pancreatitis are numerous and 
diverse; however, superinfection of the pancreas is most often 
caused by gastrointestinal flora such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp, 
and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus 
spp, Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. 
Necrotic tissue or pancreatic aspirates should be sent for aero-
bic bacterial culture and Gram stain and accompanied by 2–3 
sets of blood cultures (Table 30). Antimicrobial susceptibility 
results from isolated organisms can be used to direct therapy to 
reduce the likelihood of pancreatic sepsis, further extension of 
infection to contiguous organs, and mortality. Sterile cultures of 
necrotic pancreatic tissue are not unusual but may trigger con-
sideration of an expanded search for fastidious or slowly grow-

IX. BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS
Osteomyelitis arises from hematogenous seeding of bone from 
a distant site, extension into bone from a contiguous site, or di-
rect inoculation of microorganisms into bone with surgery or 
trauma. Infections of native joints may also develop by any of 
these routes, with most occurring by hematogenous seeding. 
Infections of prosthetic joints are usually acquired from con-
tamination at the time of arthroplasty implantation, but may 
occur due to subsequent hematogenous seeding or extension 
from contiguous sites.
The potential list of causative agents of bone and joint infec-
tions is diverse and largely predicated on the nature and patho-
genesis of infection and the host. While bone and joint infections 
are usually monomicrobial, some may be polymicrobial.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of bone and joint 
infections:
• Swabs are not recommended for specimen collection, with 
aspirates and/or tissue biopsies being preferred.
• Blood cultures are indicated for detection of some agents of 
osteomyelitis and native joint infection, but not for routine 
prosthetic joint infection diagnosis.
• Joint fluids should ideally be cultured in blood culture bottles.
• For prosthetic joint infection diagnosis, 3–4 separate tis-
sue samples should be submitted for culture; sonication of 
explanted prostheses may also be used to detect pathogens in 
biofilms.
• When anaerobic bacteria are suspected, which includes all 
cases of prosthetic joint infection, anaerobic transport con-
tainers should be used for transportation of tissues and fluids 
to the laboratory, and anaerobic cultures performed.
• Some agents of bone and joint infection are nonculturable 
or poorly culturable and require molecular and/or serologic 
methods for detection.
A. Osteomyelitis
Osteomyelitis can occur following hematogenous spread, 
after a contaminated open fracture, or in those with diabe-
tes mellitus or vascular insufficiency. Vertebral osteomyelitis/
spondylodiscitis will be separately considered. Osteomyelitis 
is typically suspected on clinical grounds, with confirmation 
involving imaging and microbiologic and histopathologic 
tests. The peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated, 
and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive 
protein (CRP) are often elevated. Establishing an etiologic 
diagnosis, which is important for directing appropriate clin-
ical management since this varies by microorganism type 
and associated antimicrobial susceptibility, nearly always 
requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation. This 
can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sam-
pling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to 
the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, 
shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic 
material (Table 31). Swabs are not recommended. Cultures 
of sinus tracts are generally not recommended because recov-
ered organisms usually do not correlate with those found 
in deep cultures, although S. aureus shows modest correla-
tion. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually monobacterial, 
whereas that resulting from contiguous infection is often 
polymicrobial. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis of long 
bones mainly occurs in prepubertal children, but can occur 
in the elderly, injection drug users, and those with indwelling 
central venous catheters. In prepubertal children, the most 
common microorganisms involved are S. aureus and S. pneu-
moniae; Kingella kingae is common in children <4 years of 
age [174]. Osteomyelitis in neonates, especially in those 
with indwelling central venous catheters, typically results 
from hematogenous spread; commonly involved organisms 
include Streptococcus agalactiae and aerobic gram-negative 
bacteria, especially E. coli. Candida spp and P. aeruginosa 
are more commonly encountered in injection drug users and 
those with indwelling central venous catheters. In children, 
the diagnosis is often made based on clinical and imaging 
findings in the context of positive blood cultures. NAATs 
are particularly useful for diagnosing K. kingae bone and 
joint infection in children <4 years of age. In adults, imag-
ing-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary.
In osteomyelitis occurring after a contaminated open frac-
ture, the organisms listed above may be found, with enterococci,

fungi, and NTM alternatively being involved; microorganisms 
may derive from patient skin, contaminated soil, and/or the 
healthcare environment.
In patients with diabetes, osteomyelitis typically involves 
the foot as a complication of a chronic foot ulcer; a positive 
probe-to-bone test is associated with osteomyelitis. Specimens 
for bone culture (aerobic and anaerobic) and histology can be 
obtained by open debridement, needle puncture, or transcuta-
neous biopsy. Readers are referred to a guideline that provides 
greater detail on the diagnosis of diabetic foot infections [175].
Vertebral osteomyelitis/disc space infection/spondylodisci-
tis is often hematogenous in origin (eg, from skin and soft tis-
sue, urinary tract, intravascular catheter, pulmonary infection 
sites), but can occur postoperatively or following a procedure. 
Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci are 
most commonly involved, followed by gram-negative aerobes, 
streptococci, Candida spp, and, in patients with relevant risk fac-
tors, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (and occasionally NTM) and 
Brucella spp. Two sets of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial/candidal 
blood cultures and ESR and CRP should be obtained; in addition, 
Brucella blood cultures and serologic tests should be obtained 
in those in areas endemic for brucellosis, fungal blood cultures 
in those with relevant epidemiologic or host risk factors, and, as 
with other types of osteomyelitis, a purified protein derivative 
test or interferon-γ release assay may be considered in those at 
risk for tuberculosis (acknowledging a risk of both false-pos-
itive and false-negative results). Patients suspected of having 
native vertebral osteomyelitis based on clinical, laboratory, and

aSalmonella osteomyelitis occurs most often in patients with sickle cell trait or disease.
bStreptococcus pneumoniae osteomyelitis occurs most often in pediatric patients, not infrequently in the setting of pneumococcal bacteremia.
cBrucella spp will be recovered in standard aerobic bacterial cultures; however, the laboratory should be notified when Brucella spp is considered to be a potential cause of osteomyelitis so 
that cultures are examined only in a biological safety cabinet. Concomitant serologic testing is recommended.
dHematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp occurs most often in injection drug users. P
. aeruginosa is the most common bacterial cause 
of calcaneal osteomyelitis in individuals who develop this infection after stepping on nails while wearing sneakers.
eThe most common site of osteomyelitis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the vertebral bodies. M. tuberculosis also represents one of the most common causes of clavicular osteo-
myelitis. Commercial NAATs are not US Food and Drug Administration–approved for nonrespiratory sites, so a laboratory-developed/validated test must be used if NAATs are requested.
fChronic endodontic infections such as apical abscesses may extend into surrounding bone, resulting in osteomyelitis of the maxilla or mandible. These infections are caused by the aero-
bic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the oral cavity and may be either monomicrobial or polymicrobial. Actinomyces spp is a recognized pathogen in this setting; when Actinomyces spp is 
suspected, specimens should be transported to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions and cultures incubated for 10–14 days.
gMycetoma is a chronic soft tissue infection of the extremities which can also extend into contiguous bone and connective tissue. It occurs most often in tropical and subtropical climates and 
may be characterized by the development of draining sinuses. Etiologic agents are derived from the soil. Sinus tract drainage material, when present, may be representative of the etiology of 
underlying osteomyelitis. In addition to the stains and cultures noted in the table, sinus drainage should also be examined grossly and microscopically for the presence of “sulfur granules” 
characteristic of this disease. Furthermore, the laboratory should be notified of the possibility of Nocardia spp as a pathogen so that appropriate media (eg, Middlebrook agar, Sabouraud 
dextrose agar, buffered charcoal yeast extract) can be inoculated which facilitate recovery of this organism.

imaging studies, with S. aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, or 
Brucella bloodstream infection or, in an endemic setting, a pos-
itive Brucella serology, do not need further testing. For all others, 
imaging-guided aspiration/biopsy of a disc space or vertebral end-
plate is recommended, with the specimens submitted for Gram 
stain and aerobic and anaerobic culture and, if adequate tissue can 
be obtained, histopathology. If results are negative or inconclusive 
(eg, Corynebacterium spp is isolated), a second imaging-guided 
aspiration biopsy, percutaneous endoscopic discectomy and 
drainage procedure, or open excisional biopsy should be consid-
ered to collect additional specimens for repeat and additional test-
ing. Readers are referred to a guideline that provides greater detail 
on the diagnosis of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [176].
B. Infections of Native Joints and Bursitis
Joints can be hematogenously seeded by bacteria, or seeded by 
direct inoculation or from a contiguous focus, with the majority 
of infections being monoarticular. Staphylococcus aureus and 
Streptococcus spp are common causes of septic arthritis of native 
joints, followed by gram-negative bacilli, which mainly cause 
septic arthritis in neonates, the elderly, injection drug users, and 
the immunocompromised. Kingella kingae is the most common 
etiology of bacterial joint infection in children <4 years of age. 
Gonococcal arthritis is rare. Viruses, including parvovirus B19, 
Chikungunya virus, and rubella, among others, may be asso-
ciated with arthritis (Table 32). Subacute or chronic infectious 
arthritis may be caused by M. tuberculosis and NTM, Borrelia 
burgdorferi, Candida spp, Blastomyces sp, Coccidioides immitis/
posadasii, Histoplasma spp, Sporothrix sp, Cryptococcus neofor-
mans/gattii, and Aspergillus spp, among others. Septic bursitis, 
which usually involves the prepatellar, olecranon, or trochan-
teric bursae, is usually caused by S. aureus.
Although peripheral-blood white cell count, ESR, and CRP 
are often elevated, they are nonspecific. Arthrocentesis of a septic 
joint usually reveals purulent, low-viscosity synovial fluid with an 
elevated neutrophil count. Traditionally, a synovial fluid leukocyte 
count >50 000 cells/μL was considered to suggest septic arthri-
tis; however, lower counts do not exclude the diagnosis. Ideally, 
synovial fluid should be submitted for Gram stain, and cultured 
in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. If synovial fluid 
studies are negative, biopsy of the synovium may be required 
for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic cultures, histopathologic 
evaluation, and possibly fungal and mycobacterial stains and cul-
tures. Concomitant or secondary bacteremia or fungemia occurs 
sporadically in patients with septic arthritis; thus, blood cultures 
collected during febrile episodes are recommended.
C. Prosthetic Joint Infection
A special category of bone and joint infection exists for pros-
thetic joint infection (PJI), which may involve knee, hip, shoul-
der, elbow, or other prostheses [177]. Staphylococci, including 
not just S. aureus, but also the coagulase-negative staphylococci, 
especially Staphylococcus epidermidis, are particularly common 
causes, but many other organisms, including streptococci, 
enterococci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic bacteria 
(eg, Cutibacterium acnes, Finegoldia magna), and fungi, can be 
involved (Table 33). Cutibacterium acnes is particularly com-
mon in shoulder arthroplasty infection.
The diagnosis of PJI is ideally made preoperatively, but if this 
is not possible, diagnosis and, if present, definition of the infect-
ing organism(s) should be pursued at the time of revision or 
resection arthroplasty. Readers are referred to a guideline that 
provides detail on the diagnosis of PJI [178]. Preoperatively, 
ESR and CRP are recommended, as is arthrocentesis for syno-
vial fluid cell count, differential, and culture, ideally in aerobic 
and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Criteria for the interpre-
tation of synovial fluid cell count and differential in the pres-
ence of a prosthetic joint differ from those in native joints. 
Intraoperative frozen section analysis is a reliable diagnostic 
test. For tissue culture, multiple specimens should be submit-
ted for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, 4 if using conventional 
plate and broth cultures, and 3 if culturing tissues in aerobic and 
anaerobic blood culture bottles [179]. Tissue can be processed 
in a number of ways, including crushing, stomaching, and bead 
mill processing using glass beads [180]. Two or more intraop-
erative cultures or a combination of preoperative aspiration and 
intraoperative cultures that yield the same organism is consid-
ered definitive evidence of PJI. Notably, single positive tissue 
or synovial fluid cultures, especially for organisms that may be 
contaminants (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci, C. acnes), 
should not be considered evidence of definite PJI. Gram stains 
are not recommended. Isolation of C. acnes may require cul-
ture incubation times as long as 14 days. The pathogenesis of 
PJI relates to the presence of microorganisms in biofilms on the 
implant surface. Therefore, if the arthroplasty is resected, the 
implant components may be vortexed and sonicated and the 
resultant sonication fluid semi-quantitatively cultured [181]. 
Since fungi and mycobacteria are extremely rare in this setting, 
they should not be routinely sought.
X. URINARY 
TRACT INFECTIONS
Clinical microbiology tests of value in establishing an etiologic 
diagnosis of infections of the urinary tract are covered in this 
section, including specimens and laboratory procedures for the 
diagnosis of cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, 
and orchitis. Some special tests not available in smaller labora-
tories may be sent to a reference laboratory, but expect longer 
turnaround times for results.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infec-
tions (UTIs):
• Urine should not sit at room temperature for more than 30 
minutes. Hold at refrigerator temperatures if not cultured

 e48 • CID 2018:67 (15 September) • Miller et al
within 30 minutes, or use a urine transport device (boric acid 
or other preservative).
• Reflexing to culture after a positive pyuria screen should be a 
locally approved policy.
• The presence of 3 or more species of bacteria in a urine spec-
imen usually indicates contamination at the time of collec-
tion, and interpretation is fraught with error.
• Do not ask the laboratory to report “everything that grows” 
without first consulting with the laboratory and providing 
documentation for interpretive criteria for culture that is not 
in the laboratory procedure manual.
A. Urinary Tract Infection/Pyelonephritis
The IDSA guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of UTIs are 
published [182, 183] as are American Society for Microbiology 
recommendations 
[184]. 
These 
provide 
diagnostic 
recommendations that are similar to those presented here 
(Table 34). The differentiation of cystitis and pyelonephritis 
requires clinical information and physical findings as well as 
laboratory information, and from the laboratory perspective 
the spectrum of pathogens is similar for the 2 syndromes [185]. 
Culturing only urines that have tested positive for pyuria, 
either with a dipstick test for leukocyte esterase or other indi-
cators of PMNs, may increase the likelihood of a positive cul-
ture, but occasionally samples yielding positive screening tests 
yield negative culture results and vice versa [186]. The Gram 
stain is not the appropriate method to detect PMNs in urine, 
but it can be ordered as an option for detection of high num-
bers of gram-negative rods when a patient is suspected of 
suffering from urosepsis. Because urine is so easily contami-
nated with commensal flora, specimens for culture of bacterial 
urinary tract pathogens should be collected with attention to

aKingella kingae is the most common cause of septic joint infections before the age of 4 years.
bNeisseria gonorrhoeae cultures of synovial fluid may be negative. NAATs for N. gonorrhoeae should be performed on genitourinary sites and/or freshly voided urine and, if clinically indi-
cated, rectal and oropharyngeal swabs; culture for N. gonorrhoeae should be performed on specimens from genitourinary sites and, if clinically indicated, rectal and oropharyngeal swabs.
cSerology would be expected to be positive in the case of a positive NAAT or culture. Culture for Borrelia burgdorferi requires use of specialized media, rarely results in recovery of the 
organism, and is seldom done except in research settings.
dDetection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other Mycobacterium spp by microscopy or culture is very uncommon from synovial fluid in patients with joint infections due to these organ-
isms. Analysis of synovial tissue enhances the likelihood of detection.

minimizing contamination from the perineal and superficial 
mucosal microbiota [187]. Although some literature suggests 
that traditional skin cleansing in preparation for the collec-
tion of midstream or “clean catch” specimens is not of benefit, 
many laboratories find that such specimens obtained without 
skin cleansing routinely contain mixed flora and, if not stored 
properly and transported within 1 hour to the laboratory, yield 
high numbers of one or more potential pathogens on cul-
ture. Determining the true etiologic agent in such cultures is 
difficult, so skin cleansing is still recommended. The use of 
urine transport media in vacuum-fill tubes or refrigeration 
immediately after collection may decrease the proliferation 
of small numbers of contaminating organisms and increase 
the numbers of interpretable results. Straight or “in-and-out” 
catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides 
a less contaminated specimen. If mixed enteric bacteria in 
high numbers are recovered from a second, well-collected, 
straight-catheterized sample from the same patient, a enter-
ic-urinary fistula should be considered. Laboratory actions 
should be based on decisions arrived at by dialogue between 
clinician and laboratory.
Specimens from urinary catheters in place for more than a few 
hours frequently contain colonizing flora due to rapid biofilm 
formation on the catheter surface, which may not represent in-
fection. Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly 
discouraged, but if required, the specimen must be taken 
from the sampling port of a newly inserted device. Cultures of 
Foley catheter tips are of no clinical value and will be rejected. 
Collection of specimens from urinary diversions such as ileal 
loops is also discouraged because of the propensity of these

locations to be chronically colonized. Chronic nephrostomy 
collections and bagged urine collections are also of question-
able value. Multiple organisms or coagulase-negative staphylo-
cocci may be recovered in patients with urinary stents, and may 
be pathogenic. It is important that urologists and nephrologists 
who care for patients with complicated infections discuss any 
special needs or requests with the microbiology director or su-
pervisor. Specimens from these patients may contain a mixed 
flora and if specific interpretive criteria are documented for 
these specimen types, the laboratory must be aware of the doc-
umentation and the special interpretive standards. Laboratories 
routinely provide antimicrobial susceptibility tests on potential 
pathogens in significant numbers. Specimens obtained by more 
invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations, 
should be clearly identified and the workup discussed in ad-
vance with the laboratory, especially if the clinician is interested 
in recovery of bacteria in concentrations <1000 CFU per milli-
liter. Identification of a single potential pathogen in numbers as 
low as 200 CFU/mL may be significant, such as in acute urethral 
syndrome, but requests for culture results reports of <10 000 
CFU/mL should be coordinated with the laboratory so that an 
appropriate volume of urine can be processed.
While not without some exceptions, in febrile infants and 
young children (2–24 months) an abnormal urinalysis and a col-
ony count of >50 000 CFU/mL of a single organism obtained by 
either a suprapubic aspirate or catheterization is considered diag-
nostic [188]. More recent evidence would suggest that ≥104 CFU/
mL and a reliable detection of pyuria would pick up an additional 
significant proportion of children with true UTI [189].
Recovery of yeast, usually Candida spp, even in high CFU/
mL, is not infrequent from patients who do not actually have 
yeast UTI, thus interpretation of cultures yielding yeast is not 
as standardized as that for bacterial pathogens. Yeast in urine 
may rarely indicate systemic infection, for which additional 
tests must be conducted for confirmation (eg, blood cultures 
and β-glucan levels). Recovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
is best accomplished with first-void morning specimens of 
>20 mL, and requires a specific request to the laboratory so that 
appropriate processing and media are employed. Detection of 
adenovirus in cases of cystitis is usually done by NAAT. This 
testing is typically available at tertiary academic centers or refer-
ence laboratories. Polyoma BK virus nephropathy is best diag-
nosed by quantitative molecular determination of circulating 
virus in blood rather than detection of virus in urine. Such tests 
are usually performed in tertiary medical centers or reference 
laboratories.
B. Prostatitis
Acute bacterial prostatitis is defined by clinical signs and phys-
ical findings combined with positive urine or prostate secretion 
cultures yielding usual urinary tract pathogens [190–192]. The 
diagnosis of chronic prostatitis is much more problematic, and 
the percentage of cases in which a positive culture is obtained 
is much lower [193]. The traditional Meares-Stamey 4-glass 
specimen obtained by collecting the first 10-mL void, a mid-
stream specimen, expressed prostate secretions (EPSs) and 
a 10-mL post–prostate massage urine is positive if there is a 
10-fold higher bacterial count in the EPS than the midstream 
urine. A 2-specimen variant, involving only the midstream and 
the EPS specimens, is also used. A positive test is infrequent, 
and chronic pelvic pain syndrome is not frequently caused by a 
culturable infectious agent. It should be remembered that pros-
tatic massage in a patient with acute bacterial prostatitis may 
precipitate bacteremia and/or shock. Table 35 summarizes the 
approach to laboratory diagnosis of prostatitis.
C. Epididymitis and Orchitis
Epididymitis in men <35 years of age is most frequently asso-
ciated with the sexually transmitted pathogens Chlamydia 
trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC). NAATs are 
the most sensitive and a rapid diagnostic procedure for these 
agents, and each commercially available system has its own 
collection kit. Culture of GC is recommended when antibiotic 
resistance is a concern, and special media are required for anti-
microbial susceptibility testing, which may be referred to a pub-
lic health laboratory. In men >35 years of age, gram-negative 
and gram-positive pathogens similar to the organisms causing 
UTI and prostatitis may cause invasive infections of the epi-
didymis and testis. Surgically obtained tissue may be cultured 
for bacterial pathogens, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
will be performed. Fungal and mycobacterial disease are both 
uncommon, and laboratory diagnosis requires communication 
from the clinician to the laboratory to ensure proper medium 
selection and processing, particularly if tissue is to be cultured 
for these organisms.
Bacterial orchitis may be caused by both gram-negative 
and gram-positive pathogens, frequently by extension from a 
contiguous infection of the epididymis. Viral orchitis is most 
frequently ascribed to mumps virus. The diagnosis is made by 
IgM serology for mumps antibodies, or by acute and convales-
cent IgG serology. Other viral causes of epididymo-orchitis are 
Coxsackie virus, rubella virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella 
zoster virus (VZV). Systemic fungal diseases can involve the 
epididymis or testis, including blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, 
and coccidioidomycosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis may also 
involve these sites [194]. Table 36 summarizes the approaches 
to specimen management for cases of epididymitis and orchitis.
XI. GENITAL INFECTIONS
Both point-of-care and laboratory tests to identify the micro-
biological etiology of genital infections are described below. In 
addition, because recommendations exist for screening of gen-
ital infections for specific risk groups, these are also presented. 
In this section infections are categorized as follows: cutaneous

genital lesions, vaginitis and vaginosis, urethritis and cervicitis, 
and infections of the female pelvis, including endometritis and 
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Testing in special popula-
tions, such as pregnant patients, children, and men who have 
sex with men (MSM) are noted where applicable but readers 
are referred to the more comprehensive guidelines referenced.
There is considerable overlap in symptoms and signs for 
many genital infections, and clinical diagnosis alone is neither 
sensitive nor specific. Thus, diagnostic testing is recommended 
for the following reasons: appropriate treatment can be focused 
for eradication, reduction of transmission as well as symptom-
atic relief, specific diagnosis has the benefit of increasing thera-
peutic compliance by the patient and the patient is more likely 
to comply with partner notification [195, 196].
Providers should also recognize that despite diagnostic test-
ing, 25%–40% of the causes of genital infections or symptoms 
may not be specifically identified, and that many infections are 
acquired from an asymptomatic partner unaware of their infec-
tion. In fact, patients who seem to “fail” therapy and continue to 
exhibit symptoms and/or have positive tests for sexually trans-
mitted infections (STIs) are most likely to have been reinfected 
by their sexual partner [197, 198]. Thus, referral for partners for 
specific testing and/or directed treatment is essential to prevent 
reinfection and is especially true for patients who may be preg-
nant or are HIV positive. Finally, because the vast majority of 
genital infections are STIs and communicable, they are a public 
health concern. Patients and their providers should note that 
positive tests for CT, GC, syphilis, chancroid, and HIV require

reporting in accordance with state and local statutory require-
ments by the laboratory and/or the provider. Reporting of addi-
tional STIs varies by state [195].
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of genital infections:
• For vaginosis (altered vaginal flora) a Gram stain and recently 
available microbiome-based assays are more specific than 
culture and probe testing for Gardnerella vaginalis alone.
• Resistant Candida spp occur in 10%–15% of patients with 
recurrent yeast vulvovaginitis.
• Most laboratories use a reverse syphilis screening algorithm; 
treponemal specific test first (EIA/chemiluminescence 
immunoassay) followed by nontreponemal (rapid plasma 
reagin [RPR]) to confirm.
• Testing simultaneously for CT, GC, and Trichomonas is 
optimal for detection of the most common treatable STIs in 
female patients.
• High-risk individuals (eg, MSM) should have extragenital 
sites evaluated (rectal, oropharyngeal) for GC and CT.
• Screen for group B streptococcus at 35–37 weeks of preg-
nancy using both vaginal and rectal swabs; susceptibility of 
group B Streptococcus is not routinely performed unless the 
patient is penicillin allergic.
• Screen for HIV in each new pregnancy during the first prena-
tal visit or trimester as well as third trimester even in previ-
ously tested pregnancies and in sexually active patients aged 
13–64 seeking evaluation for STIs.
• Undertake partner testing and/or treatment of positive index 
cases to prevent reinfection.
• Co-testing with hrHPV and cytology increases detection of 
cervical cancer compared to cytology alone.
• High-risk HPV and genotyping helps triage management of 
women >30 years of age.
• Recognized emerging diagnostic issues:
o Mycoplasma genitalium as a cause of nongonococcal ure-
thritis in males and cervicitis and PID in females.
o Acquisition of hepatitis C virus by sexual transmission in 
MSM [195].
o Resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to antimicrobials [195].
A. Genital Lesions
Genital lesions may have multiple simultaneous infectious etiol-
ogies that make them a challenge to diagnose and treat properly. 
Guidelines from the CDC recommend that all patients present-
ing with a genital lesion should be evaluated with a serological 
test for syphilis, as well as diagnostic tests for genital herpes and 
for Haemophilus ducreyi where chancroid is prevalent. Because 
many of the genital lesions exhibit inflammatory epithelium 
that enhances the transmission of HIV, serologic screening for 
HIV infection is recommended in these patients as well [195]. 
Table 37 shows the diagnostic tests for identifying the etiology 
of the most common genital lesions.
For suspected cases of HSV genital lesions, viral culture, DFA 
and/or NAATs are commonly used for diagnosis. As methods 
for specific testing for vesicles varies among laboratories, consul-
tation with the laboratory before specimen collection is appro-
priate. While many NAATs are FDA-cleared and the preferred 
diagnostic because they provide typing and are the most sensi-
tive, especially where suboptimal collection or nonulcerative or 
vesicular lesions may be present, there may be limitations as to 
specimen source able to be tested and/or patient age depending 
on the NAAT used. Culture is more likely to be positive in patients 
that have vesicular vs ulcerative lesions, specimens obtained from 
a first episodic lesion vs a recurrent lesion, and specimens from 
immunosuppressed patients rather than immunocompetent. 
DFA allows assessment of an adequate specimen and can be a 
rapid test if performed on-site; isolates should be typed to deter-
mine if they are HSV-1 or HSV-2 since 12-month recurrence 
rates are more common with HSV-2 (90%) than HSV-1 (55%). 
Serology cannot distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 unless a 
type-specific glycoprotein G–based assay is requested [195, 197]
Point-of-care tests or tests that can be signed up for online 
and are antibody-serologic tests should not be used in patient 
populations with a low likelihood of HSV infection (no symp-
toms, no high-risk history) because a low index value positive 
is not specific and often yields false-positive results. In one 
study where HSV-2–positive indexes were reviewed, increasing 
the cutoff index value yielded better specificity. Similarly, early 
stages of infection result in false-negative results.
In children presenting with genital lesions, providers should 
not assume HSV as the only etiology and should consider 
potential atypical presentation of VZV. DFA and NAATs are 
best for detection of VZV, as culture is less sensitive. No NAAT 
FDA-cleared assays are available at the time of this writing, 
although some laboratories may offer a laboratory-developed 
test (LDT). Pregnant patients with a history of genital herpes 
should be assessed for active lesions at the time of delivery.
Updated consensus guidelines for the management of women 
with abnormal cervical cytologic lesions and testing for HPV as 
well as the use of genotyping tests were published in 2013. The 
updated guidelines are discussed by Massad et al in The Journal 
of Lower Genital Tract Disease (including corrections from the 
original guidelines published), available on the website http://
www.asccp.org/asccp-guidelines [199–201]. The guidelines 
are very comprehensive and present what is considered the 
optimal prevention strategies that would identify those HPV-
related abnormalities likely to progress to invasive cancers while 
avoiding destructive treatment of abnormalities not destined to 
become cancerous [202]. An updated consensus guideline fre-
quently asked questions section is also available at http://www.
asccp.org/consensus-guidelines-faqs. As with previous guide-
lines, HPV testing refers to validated HPV assays that have been

slide allows distinction between HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV.
bSeveral NAATs are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared. Specimen source and test availability are laboratory specific. Provider needs to check with laboratory for allowable 
specimen source and turnaround time. More sensitive than culture and DFA, especially when lesions are past vesicular stage.
cCheck with laboratory; most are maintained and shipped at RT

dSerology can be non-specific for HSV-1 and HSV-2 differentiation; should be limited to patients with clinical presentation consistent with HSV but with negative cultures by NAAT; request 
type-specific glycoprotein G–based assays that differentiate HSV-1 and HSV-2.
eHigh-risk HPV testing currently recommended in women ≥30 years of age. HPV testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of HPV in a sexual partner or in patients aged ≤21 years 
(adolescents); options for women aged 21–29 years vary depending on cytology, HPV-16/18 genotyping in cytology negative and high-risk HPV positivity helps with triage.
fThe diagnosis of genital warts is most commonly made by visual inspection; high-risk HPV testing is not recommended.
gDarkfield microscopy not widely available.
hLimited availability typically performed in public health laboratories.
iViable organisms are not required for optimal test performance; clarify source (genital, oral, rectal) because nonpathogenic treponemes can be detected in nongenital sites.
jNontreponemal tests (RPR and VDRL) are less sensitive in early and late disease, and become negative after treatment; do not use to test pregnant patients due to potential for false-positive results.
kTreponemal tests: EIA or CIA formats, TPPA, and FTA-ABS; monitor titers using same type of test and/or same laboratory; positive for life; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected 
patients may have unusual serologic responses.
lTreponemal test may be performed first with subsequent testing done with nontreponemal tests such as RPR (reverse testing algorithm). Confirmation with a second treponemal test dif-
ferent than the first is required in positive EIA/CIA but negative RPR tests. For laboratories that routinely perform the reverse algorithm, a special request for testing by RPR may be required 
when following positive syphilis patients for treatment effectiveness.
mUncommon genital ulcers in the United States are typically diagnosed by clinical presentation, risk factors, and exclusion of syphilis and HSV; HIV testing should be part of workup.
nGram stain with chancroid organisms shows small rods or chains in parallel rows, “school of fish”; culture requires special media and sensitivity is only 30%–70%. Testing should only be 
performed by laboratory that regularly performs this testing.
oCell culture sensitivity about 30%; rectal ulcers in men who have sex with men.
pMIF titers ≥256 with appropriate clinical presentation suggests lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).
qComplement fixation titers ≥64 with appropriate clinical presentation suggests LGV, sensitivity 80% at 2 weeks.
rNAATs for C. trachomatis (CT) will detect L1–L3 but do not distinguish these from the other CT serovars; typical lesion sites not FDA-cleared; some laboratories have validated rectal swabs; 
NAAT performed through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in outbreak situations [210].
sPlace a drop of mineral oil on a sterile scalpel blade. Allow some of the oil to flow onto the papule. Scrape vigorously 6 or 7 times to remove the top of the papule. (Tiny flecks of blood 
should be seen in the oil.) Use the flat side of the scalpel to add pressure to the side of the papule to push the mite out of the burrow. Transfer the oil and scrapings onto a glass slide (an 
applicator stick can be used). Do not use a swab, which will absorb the material and not release it onto the slide. For best results, scrape 20 papules.

analytically and clinically validated for cervical cancer and veri-
fied precancer cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ by the FDA. 
Only testing for hrHPV types that are associated with cervical 
cancer is appropriate [202, 203]. Because the 2013 guidelines 
are lengthy, with 18 flowchart figures, essential changes and 
retained 2006 consensus guidelines are listed below.
Essential changes from prior management guidelines related 
to screening include:
• Cytology (Papanicolaou [Pap] smear) screening is only 
acceptable in women <30 years of age.
• High-risk HPV testing is unacceptable for routine manage-
ment of women aged 21–29 years.
• Co-testing with cytology and hrHPV is preferred in women 
≥30–65 years of age.
• High-risk HPV–negative and atypical squamous cells of 
undetermined significance (ASC-US) results should be fol-
lowed with co-testing at 3 years, not 5.
• In general, results of cytology negative but hrHPV positive 
warrant HPV-16/18 genotype to identify patients at higher 
risk for progression to cervical cancer.
Prior management guidelines from the 2006 consensus guide-
lines for the management of women with abnormal cervical 
screening tests [203] retained include:
• Women <21 years of age do not need routine cervical 
screening.
• Endocervical specimens in liquid cytology medium have a 
higher sensitivity for detecting significant lesions and facili-
tate subsequent HPV testing in patients because tests can be 
done from the same specimen.
• High-risk HPV testing is not recommended for ages 21–29 as 
a routine test but is recommended for the purposes of triag-
ing women >25 years of age with ASC-US or ASC-H (atyp-
ical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous 
intraepithelial lesion).
• Only testing for hrHPV types associated with cervical cancer 
is appropriate.
• HPV-negative and ASC-US results are insufficient to allow 
exit from screening at age 65 years.
• In women >30 years of age, co-testing strategies with nega-
tive cytology but positive hrHPV reflex to 16/18 genotyping 
should be considered
Follow-up testing for abnormal cytology and/or positive hrHPV 
is complicated and readers are referred to the American Society 
for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines for manage-
ment decisions and the free teaching modules available (http://
www.asccp.org/asccp-guidelines.
In 2015, additional interim clinical guidance papers were 
published for use of primary hrHPV testing for cervical cancer 
screening without Pap [201, 202]. An overview of possible 
advantages and disadvantages were addressed. Assessment from 
large databases showed major advantages in primary hrHPV 
screening as an alternative to current guidelines. Detection 
of hrHPV and genotypes 16/18 allowed triaging effectively as 
far as disease detection, number of screening tests, and overall 
colposcopies performed. Major disadvantages identified were 
a doubling of the number of colposcopies in ages 25–29 (thus 
why primary screening was recommended at age >30 years), 
and that primary hrHPV testing alone did not allow assessment 
of specimen adequacy that co-testing offered. A point-counter-
point on primary screening showed that this strategy is not yet 
fully accepted [203].
Patients with a cervix remaining after hysterectomy, HIV-
infected patients, and patients that have received one of the 
HPV vaccines should undergo routine Pap and HPV screening 
and management. Testing should be postponed when a woman 
is menstruating [195, 202, 203].
In the United States, testing for syphilis is most commonly 
performed by serology and requires 2 tests. Traditionally test-
ing has consisted of initial screening with an inexpensive non-
treponemal test (ie, RPR), then retesting reactive specimens 
with a more specific, and more expensive, treponemal test (ie, 
Treponema pallidum particle agglutination). If a nontrepone-
mal test is being used as the screening test, it should be con-
firmed, as a high percentage of false-positive results occur in 
many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis. When both 
test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. 
Many high-volume clinical laboratories have reversed the test-
ing sequence and begin the testing algorithm first with a spe-
cific treponemal test, such as an EIA or chemiluminescence 
immunoassay, and then retesting reactive results with a non-
treponemal test, such as RPR, to confirm diagnosis. Screening 
with a treponemal test can identify persons previously positive, 
treated, and/or partially treated for syphilis as well as yield false 
positives in patients with low likelihood of infection. If the fol-
low-up confirmation test (RPR) is negative, it requires the lab-
oratory to perform a different treponemal-specific test to guide 
management decisions (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibody–
absorbed) [194, 204]. Treponema pallidum cannot be seen on 
Gram stain and cannot be cultured in the routine laboratory. 
Darkfield exam for motile spirochetes is unavailable in the ma-
jority of laboratories.
Chancroid, caused by the gram-negative organism H. ducreyi, 
lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) caused by C. trachomatis 
serovars L1, L2, or L3, and granuloma inguinale (donovaniasis) 
caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella 
granulomatis, are genital ulcers uncommon in the United 
States and are typically diagnosed by clinical presentation, 
identification of high-risk factors, and exclusion of the more 
common genital lesions (syphilis and HSV). Chancroid may be 
identified by Gram stain and culture but is not recommended

to be performed unless by a laboratory experienced in this test-
ing. NAATs for C. trachomatis will detect LGV serovars but not 
specific serovars, but none are FDA-cleared for genital ulcer 
sites. Rectal swabs in patients with proctitis are recommended, 
and testing is available in laboratories that have validated this 
source [205].
B. Vaginosis/Vaginitis
The diagnoses of bacterial vaginosis (BV), or altered vaginal 
flora, and vaginitis caused by fungal organisms (vulvovaginal 
candidiasis [VVC]) or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), are often 
considered clinically and diagnostically as a group because of 
their overlapping signs and symptoms. However, the mode of 
transmission and/or acquisition is not necessarily that of an STI 
for VVC, but may be for BV and is for TV. A number of point-
of-care tests can be performed from a vaginal discharge spec-
imen while the patient is in the healthcare setting. Although 
point-of-care tests are popular, the sensitivity and specificity for 
making a specific diagnosis vary widely and these assays, while 
rapid, are often diagnostically poor. Some of the tests include a 
pH strip test, scored Gram stain for BV, wet mount for TV, and 
10% KOH microscopic examinations for VVC. For BV, use of 
clinical criteria (Amsel diagnostic criteria) is equal to a scored 
Gram stain of vaginal discharge. However, a scored Gram stain 
is more specific than probe hybridization, point-of-care tests, 
and culture that only detect the presence of G. vaginalis as 
the hallmark organism for altered vaginal flora) Table 38. For 
VVC and TV, the presence of pseudohyphae and motile tricho-
monads, respectively, allows a diagnosis. However, proficiency 
in microscopic examination is essential given that infections 
may be mixed and/or present with atypical manifestations. 
Unfortunately, consistent microscopic examination of vaginal 
specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories 
to perform and wide variation of sensitivities (40%–70%) for 
both TV and VVC using smear examination exists relative to 
NAAT and culture, respectively [206]. It should be noted that 
recent publications utilizing NAATs highlight the prevalence 
of Trichomonas as equal to or greater than CT and GC in cer-
tain patient populations and point to a growing trend toward 
screening for TV, CT, and GC simultaneously [207, 208]. More

recently, microbiome-based multiplex NAATs have become 
available for the diagnosis of BV and have been validated in 
several reference laboratories. One commercial product is now 
FDA-cleared. Preliminary data show greater specificity of this 
approach compared to methods that identify only G. vagina-
lis, as well as consistency in both reproducible as well as stan-
dardized results. Tests for the entities of vaginosis/vaginitis are 
shown in Table 38 [209–214].
C. Urethritis/Cervicitis
Urethritis and cervicitis share common signs and symp-
toms and infectious etiologies in male and female patients, 
respectively. Table 39 combines the diagnostic tests used 
to identify the pathogens common to both. In addition, 
because screening for CT and GC has reduced the reper-
cussions related to infections and subsequent PID, the fol-
lowing guidelines for screening women for CT and GC have 
been presented by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 
2014 
(available 
at: 
https://www.uspreventiveservicestask-
force.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/
chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-screening).
Annual CT Screening
➢ Sexually active women aged ≤25 years and those pregnant
➢ Older women with the following identified risk factors:
• new sex partner
• multiple partners
• partner with an STI
• inconsistent condom use, not in a monogamous relationship
• previous or coexisting STI
• exchanging sex for money or drugs
GC Screening (Consider Local Epidemiology and Risk)
➢ Sexually active women aged ≤25 years and those pregnant
➢ Similar criteria as above for CT
For laboratory diagnosis of CT and GC, NAATs are the pre-
ferred assays for detection because of increased sensitivity 
while retaining specificity in low-prevalence populations (preg-
nant patients) and the ability to screen with a noninvasive urine 
specimen [195]. Vaginal specimens in women (either provider 
or self-collected) and urine specimens in men are preferred 
specimen sources. In MSM, rectal and oropharyngeal testing 
is recommended. NAATs on samples other than genital (rectal, 
oropharyngeal, conjunctival) are currently not FDA-cleared and 
require in-house validation. Providers need to confirm with the 
laboratory if these sources will be tested. In general, retesting 
patients with a follow-up test for CT or GC (test of cure) is not 
recommended unless special circumstances exist (pregnancy, 
continuing symptoms). However, patients that are at higher risk 
for STIs should be screened within 3–12 months from the initial 
positive test for possible reinfection because those patients with 
repeat infections are at higher risk for PID. Requirements for 
testing practices and/or need for confirmatory testing in pedi-
atric patients may vary from state to state, especially in potential 
victims of assault; check with state guidelines. Appropriate pro-
viders or laboratories that perform testing in children should be 
consulted [195].
Recently, prevalence studies using NAATs have shown that 
Trichomonas is as common as CT and more common that GC 
in certain clinical and geographic settings, with a uniquely high 
presence in women and men over 40 and in incarcerated popu-
lations. In addition, the ulcerative nature of TV infection leads 
to sequelae similar to those of CT and GC, including perinatal 
complications as well as susceptibility to HIV and HSV acqui-
sition and transmission. FDA-cleared NAATs allow testing 
from the same screening specimens used for CT and GC test-
ing, with significantly improved sensitivity over wet mount or 
hybridization test.
Mycoplasma genitalium is a recognized pathogen in nongono-
coccal urethritis and nonchlamydial nongonococcal urethritis 
in males and likewise cervicitis and PID in females. Fifteen per-
cent to 25% of infections may be due to this organism, and resis-
tance to first-line agents is rising [215, 216]. A NAAT may be 
the best option for detection of M. genitalium, due to issues with 
culture and cross-reactivity with serologic tests. While there is 
no FDA-cleared assay available, multiple laboratories have val-
idated molecular assays. Culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma is 
not recommended because of the high prevalence of coloniza-
tion in asymptomatic, sexually active people [195, 217].
D. Infections of the Female Pelvis
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a spectrum of disor-
ders and can be a serious infection in the upper genital tract/
reproductive organs (uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) and 
includes any single or combination of endometritis, tubo-ovar-
ian abscess, and salpingitis. PID can be sexually transmitted or 
naturally occurring, has the highest incidence in ages 15–25, 
and is the leading cause of infertility in women [218] (http://
www.ashasexualhealth.org/stdsstis/pid/).
PID can be clinically difficult to identify when patients pre-
sent with mild or nonspecific symptoms. Finding symptoms on 
physical examination (cervical motion tenderness) as well as 
other criteria (elevated temperature or mucopurulent discharge) 
increases the specificity and positive predictive value of labo-
ratory tests. Diagnostic tests are dependent on the clinical se-
verity of disease, epidemiological risk assessment, and whether 
invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy and/or endometrial 
biopsy, are used. Bacterial tests performed on non–aseptically 
collected specimens (endocervical or dilatation and curettage) 
have limited utility in diagnosing PID. Actinomyces spp are part 
of normal flora and can often be seen on Pap smears. While

Actinomyces spp have been associated with intrauterine devices 
(IUDs) in the past, they are very uncommon and usually occur 
most commonly in 2 settings: if a patient has an infection at 
the time of insertion of an IUD and if the IUD is left in place 
past the recommended time of removal (typically 5 years) [219]. 
If Actinomyces infection is suspected, the laboratory should be 
notified to culture such samples anaerobically, including an an-
aerobic broth that is held for ≥5 days. Patients with suspected 
PID should be tested for CT, GC, and HIV. Both difficulty in 
diagnosis as well as significant potential sequelae should make 
the threshold for therapy low [220].
Postpartum endometritis should be suspected when the 
patient presents with high fever (≥101°F [38.3°C] or >100.4°F 
[38.0°C] on >2 occasions >6 hours apart after the first 24 hours 
of delivery and up to 10 days postdelivery), abdominal pain, 
uterine tenderness, and foul lochia. Usually a multiorganism

syndrome, the infection is most commonly seen in patients 
with unplanned cesarean delivery because of the inability to 
introduce antibiotics quickly. Postpartum endometritis can 
be reduced by testing and treating for symptomatic BV late in 
pregnancy, which has been associated with preterm labor and 
prolonged delivery. Late postpartum endometritis suggests pos-
sible chlamydia or other chronic STI.
Although the role of culture in the setting of endometritis 
is controversial, diagnostic tests to consider in the diagnosis of 
PID and postpartum endometritis are shown in Table 40.
E. Special Populations
Children for whom sexual assault is a consideration should be 
referred to a setting or clinic that specifically deals with this sit-
uation. Readers are referred to the references by Girardet et al 
and the 2015 CDC guidelines, where NAAT and noninvasive 
specimens have yielded excellent results [195, 221].
In MSM, the typical genital sites are not always infected (eg, 
the urethra or urine). Recommendations from the CDC now 
include screening in this population at a number of sites for GC 
and CT, including rectum, oropharynx, and urethra. Readers 
are referred to the CDC treatment guidelines for further recom-
mendations [195] and a review of extragenital infections caused 
by CT and GC [221].
In pregnant patients, screening for HIV
, syphilis, hepatitis B sur-
face antigen, CT, and GC (if in high-risk group or high-GC-prev-
alence area) is routine. Symptomatic patients with vaginosis/
vaginitis should be tested for BV and Trichomonas. Screening for 
group B streptococci (GBS) should occur at 35–37 weeks with 
both rectal and vaginal swab specimens submitted to optimize 
identification of carriers. Laboratories typically use an enrich-
ment broth and selective media to enhance recovery for GBS. 
While NAATs are available for GBS, the sensitivity is optimal only 
when performed from an enrichment broth specimen. Women 
with bacteriuria with GBS (as single pathogen or predominant 
pathogen isolated) indicate high carriage and increased risk 
for transmission of GBS to the neonate. Treating GBS prior to 
35–37 weeks does not eliminate the need to treat at the time of 
delivery, and patients are assumed to be carriers. Susceptibility 
testing of GBS is not routinely performed and recommended 
only if the patient is allergic to penicillin. Group A streptococci 
are not detected by GBS PCR tests. Past history of STIs, those in 
higher-risk groups, and/or clinical presentation consistent with 
infection, should be assessed for other pathogens as warranted 
(ie, HSV if vesicular lesions are present). Although rare, Listeria 
infection in the pregnant woman (usually acquired via ingestion 
of unpasteurized cheese or other food) can be passed to the fetus, 
leading to disease or death of the neonate. Due to nonspecific 
symptoms, diagnosis is difficult, but blood cultures from a bac-
teremic mother may allow detection of this pathogen in time for 
antibiotic prophylaxis Screening tests (serology, stool cultures) in 
pregnant women are not appropriate [222].
XII. SKIN AND SOFT 
TISSUE INFECTIONS
Cutaneous infections, often referred to as skin and soft tissue 
infections (SSTIs), occur when the skin’s protective mecha-
nisms fail, especially following trauma, inflammation, macer-
ation from excessive moisture, poor blood perfusion, or other 
factors that disrupt the stratum corneum. Thus, any compro-
mise of skin and skin structure provides a point of entry for 
a myriad of exogenous and endogenous microbial flora that 
can produce a variety of infections. Infections of the skin and 
soft tissue are often classified as primary pyodermas, infections 
associated with underlying conditions of the skin, and necro-
tizing infections. Representative primary cutaneous infections 
of the skin include cellulitis, ecthyma, impetigo, folliculitis,

furunculosis, and erysipelas and are commonly caused by a nar-
row spectrum of pyogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and/
or Streptococcus pyogenes [group A Streptococcus]). Secondary 
infections are often extensions of preexisting lesions (traumatic 
or surgical wounds, ulcers), which serve as the primary por-
tal of entry for microbial pathogens and are often polymicro-
bial (mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms) involving 
subcutaneous tissue. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) typically 
originate in a wound, secondary to a neuropathic ulceration. 
Anaerobic bacteria are important and predominant pathogens 
in DFIs and should always be considered in choosing ther-
apeutic options. The majority of DFIs are polymicrobial but 
gram-positive cocci, specifically staphylococci, are the most 
common infectious agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is involved 
in the majority of chronic DFIs but its relevance related to treat-
ment decisions is not clear. Surface cultures of such wounds, 
including decubitus ulcers, are not valuable, as they usually 
represent colonizing microbes, which cannot be differentiated 
from the underlying etiologic agent. Tissue biopsies after thor-
ough debridement, or bone biopsies through a debrided site, are 
most valuable. Necrotizing cutaneous infections, such as necro-
tizing fasciitis, are usually caused by streptococci (and less often 
by MRSA or Klebsiella spp), but can also be polymicrobial. The 
infection usually occurs following a penetrating wound to the 
extremities, is often life-threatening, and requires immediate 
recognition and intervention. On rare occasions, necrotizing 
fasciitis occurs in the absence of identifiable trauma.
For the common forms of SSTIs, cultures are not indicated 
for uncomplicated infections (cellulitis, subcutaneous abscesses) 
treated in the outpatient setting. Whether cultures are beneficial 
in managing cellulitis in the hospitalized patient is uncertain and 
the sensitivity of blood cultures in this setting is low. Cultures 
are indicated for the patient who requires operative incision and 
drainage because of risk for deep structure and underlying tissue 
involvement and cases of therapeutic failure [223].
In this section, cutaneous infections, involving skin and soft 
tissue, have been expanded and categorized as follows: trauma 
associated, surgical site, burn wounds, fungal, human and ani-
mal bites, and device related. Although the majority of these 
infections are commonly caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes, 
other microorganisms, including fungi and viruses, are import-
ant and require appropriate medical and therapeutic manage-
ment. It is important that the clinician be familiar with the 
extent or limitation of services provided by the supporting lab-
oratory. For example, not all laboratories provide quantitative 
cultures for the assessment of wounds, especially burn wounds. 
If a desired service or procedure is not available in the local 
microbiology laboratory, consult with the laboratory so that 
arrangements can be made to transfer the specimen to a qual-
ified reference laboratory with the understanding that turn-
around times are likely to be longer, thus extending the time to 
receipt of results.
A major factor in acquiring clinically relevant culture and 
associated diagnostic testing results is the acquisition of appro-
priate specimens that represent the group of diseases discussed 
in this section. Guidelines for obtaining representative speci-
mens are summarized as follows:
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of SSTIs:
• Do not use the label “wound” alone. Be specific about body 
site and type of wound (for example “human bite wound, 
knuckle”).
• The specimen of choice is a biopsied sample of the advancing 
margin of the lesion. Pus alone or a cursory surface swab is 
inadequate and does not represent the disease process.
• Do not ask the laboratory to report everything that grows.
A. Burn Wound Infections
Reliance on clinical signs and symptoms alone in the diag-
nosis of burn wound infections is challenging and unreliable. 
Sampling of the burn wound by either surface swab or tissue 
biopsy for culture is recommended for monitoring the presence 
and extent of infection (Table 41). Quantitative culture of either 
specimen is recommended; optimal utilization of quantitative 
surface swabs requires twice-weekly sampling of the same site to 
accurately monitor the trend of bacterial colonization. A major 
limitation of surface swab quantitative culture is that microbial 
growth reflects the microbial flora on the surface of the wound 
rather than the advancing margin of the subcutaneous or deep, 
underlying damaged tissue. Quantitative bacterial culture of 
tissue biopsy should be supplemented with histopathological 
examination to better ascertain the extent of microbial inva-
sion. Be advised that quantitative bacterial cultures may not be 
offered in all laboratories; quantitative biopsy cultures should 
be considered for patients in whom grafting is necessary. For 
laboratories that provide quantitative wound culture services 
to wound care centers, which predominately manage chronic 
wounds, obtaining clinically relevant results is dependent upon 
obtaining tissue from deep within the wound to avoid surface 
and subsurface microbial flora, which essentially colonize these 
areas and are part of a biofilm. Collection of specimens using 
swabs is discouraged due to the significant limitations of swabs: 
(1) high risk of contamination with surface and subsurface con-
tamination, and (2) limited specimen capacity (500 μL) leading 
to insufficient quantity of specimen, especially when cultures 
(fungal, mycobacterial) other than bacteriology are requested. 
Prior to any sampling or biopsy, the wound should be thor-
oughly cleansed and devoid of topical antimicrobials and debris 
that can affect culture results. Blood cultures should be collected 
for detection of systemic disease secondary to the wound.
The application of NAAT for detection of listed viruses is com-
monly restricted to blood and/or body fluids. It is advisable that the 
clinician determine if the local supporting laboratory has validated 
such assays and if the laboratory has assessed the performance

with tissue specimens. This precaution would also apply to the 
molecular detection of MRSA (except for one FDA-cleared test for 
S. aureus and MRSA from SSTIs) and VRE [224, 225].
B. Human Bite Wound Infections
The human oral cavity contains many potential aerobic and 
anaerobic pathogens and is the primary source of pathogens that 
cause infections following human bites. The most common of 
these are Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Clostridium spp, 
pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods, and Fusobacterium 
spp. Such infections are common in the pediatric age group and 
are often inflicted during play or by abusive adults. Bite wounds 
can vary from superficial abrasions to more severe manifesta-
tions including lymphangitis, local abscesses, septic arthritis, 
tenosynovitis, and osteomyelitis. Rare complications include 
endocarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, and sepsis with accom-
panying disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially in 
immunocompromised patients.
In addition to the challenge of acquiring a representative 
wound specimen for aerobic and anaerobic culture, a major 
limitation of culture is the potential for misleading informa-
tion as a result of the polymicrobial nature of the wound. It is 
important that a Gram stain be performed on the specimen to 
assess the presence of indicators of inflammation (eg, neutro-
phils), superficial contamination (squamous epithelial cells), 
and microorganisms. Swabs are not the specimen of choice 
in many cases (Table 42). Major limitations of swabs vs tissue 
biopsy or aspirates include (1) greater risk of contamination 
with surface/colonizing flora; (2) limited quantity of specimen 
that can be acquired; (3) drying unless placed in appropriate 
transport media, which in itself dilutes out rare microbes and 
further limits the yield of the culture [226–228].
C. Animal Bite Wound Infections
As with human bite wounds, the oral cavity of animals is the 
primary source of potential pathogens and thus the anticipated 
etiological agent(s) is highly dependent upon the type of ani-
mal that inflicted the bite (Table 43). As dogs and cats account 
for the majority of animal-inflicted bite wounds, the 2 most 
prominent groups of microorganisms initially considered in the 
evaluation of patients are Pasteurella spp, namely P. canis (dogs) 
and P. multocida subsp multocida and subsp septica (cats) or 
Capnocytophaga canimorsus. Other common aerobes include 
streptococci, staphylococci, Moraxella spp, and saprophytic 
Neisseria spp. Animal bite wounds are often polymicrobial in 
nature and include a variety of anaerobes. Due to the complex-
ity of the microbial flora in animals, examination of cultures for 
organisms other than those listed in Table 43 is of little bene-
fit since these organisms are not included in most of the com-
mercial identification systems (conventional and automated) 
databases [229–238]. Matrix-assisted laser desorption–ion-
ization mass spectrometry has proven valuable in identifying 
organisms when conventional phenotypic systems have failed. 
If rabies or herpes B infection is suspected, contact the local or 
state public health laboratory for assistance and advice on how 
to proceed.

D. Trauma-Associated Cutaneous Infections
Infections from trauma are usually caused by exogenous or 
environmental microbial flora but can be due to the indi-
vidual’s endogenous (normal) flora (Table 44). It is strongly 
recommended that specimens not be submitted for culture 
within the first 48 hours posttrauma as growth from speci-
mens collected within this time frame most likely represents 
environmental flora acquired at the time of the trauma epi-
sode (motor vehicle accident, stabbings, gunshot wounds, 
etc). The optimal time to acquire cultures is immediately after 
debridement of the trauma site [239–242]. It is strongly rec-
ommended that initial cultures focus on common pathogens, 
with additional testing being reserved for uncommon or rare 
infections associated with special circumstances (eg, detection 
of Vibrio spp following saltwater exposure) or patients with 
chronic manifestations of infection or who do not respond to 
an initial course of therapy.
Although not considered in quite the same manner as exter-
nal trauma, intravenous drug users inject themselves with exog-
enous substances that may include spores from soil and other 
contaminants that cause skin and soft tissue infections, rang-
ing from abscesses to necrotizing fasciitis. Agents are similar 
to those in Table 44, with the addition of Clostridium sordel-
lii, C. botulinum (causing wound botulism), and the agents of 
human bite wounds (Table 42) among skin poppers who use 
saliva as a drug diluent.
E. Surgical Site Infections
Surgical site infections (SSIs) may be caused by endogenous 
flora or originate from exogenous sources such as healthcare 
providers, the environment, or materials manipulated during 
an “incisional” or “organ/space” surgical procedure. Incisional 
infections are further divided into superficial (skin and subcu-
taneous tissue) and deep (tissue, muscle, fascia). Deep incisional 
and organ/space infections are the SSIs associated with the high-
est morbidity. The reader is referred to the CDC guidelines for 
prevention of surgical site infections, 2014, for specific defini-
tions of SSIs (http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/9pscs-
sicurrent.pdf). Of the microbial agents listed below (Table 45), 
S. aureus, including MRSA, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 
and enterococci are isolated from nearly 50% of these infections 
[243]. Although enterococcal species are commonly isolated 
from superficial cultures, they are seldom true pathogens; regi-
mens that do not include coverage for enterococci are successful 
for surgical site infections. To optimize clinically relevant lab-
oratory results, resist the use of swabs during surgical proce-
dures, and instead submit tissue, fluids, or aspirates.
F. Interventional Radiology and Drain Devices
Common interventional devices that are used for diagnostic or 
therapeutic purposes include interventional radiology and surgi-
cal drains. The former consists of minimally invasive procedures 
(angiography, balloon angioplasty/stent, chemoembolization,

quency ablation, cryoablation, line insertion, inferior vena cava

inserted gastrostomy, dialysis access and related intervention,

tion, and endovenous laser ablation of varicose veins) performed 
using image guidance. Procedures are regarded as either diag-
nostic (eg, angiogram) or performed for treatment purposes (eg, 
angioplasty). Images are used to direct procedures that are per-
formed with needles or other tiny instruments (eg, catheters). 
Infections as a result of such procedures are rare but should be 
considered when evaluating a patient who has undergone inter-
ventional radiology, which constitutes a risk factor for infection 
due to the invasive nature of the procedure.
A variety of drainage devices are used to remove blood, 
serum, lymph, urine, pus, and other fluids that accumulate in 
the wound bed following a procedure (eg, fluids from deep 
wounds, intracorporeal cavities, or intra-abdominal postoper-
ative abscess). They are commonly used following abdominal, 
cardiothoracic, neurosurgery, orthopedic, and breast surgery. 
Chest and abdominal drains are also used in trauma patients. 
The removal of fluid accumulations helps to prevent seromas 
and their subsequent infection. The routine use of postopera-
tive surgical drains is diminishing, although their use in certain 
situations is quite necessary.
The type of drain to be used is selected according to quality 
and quantity of drainage fluid, the amount of suction required, 
the anatomical location, and the anticipated amount of time 
the drain will be needed. Tubing may also be tailored accord-
ing to the aforementioned specifications. Some types of tub-
ing include round or flat silicone, rubber, Blake/channel, and 
triple-lumen sump. The mechanism for drainage may depend 
on gravity or bulb suction, or it may require hospital wall suc-
tion or a portable suction device. Drains may be left in place 
from 1 day to weeks, but should be removed if an infection 
is suspected. The infectious organisms that may colonize a 
drain or its tubing typically depend on the anatomical loca-
tion and position of the drain (superficial, intraperitoneal, or 
within an organ, duct or fistula) and the indication for its use. 
Interpretation of culture results from drains that have been in 
place for >3 days may be difficult due to the presence of colo-
nizing bacteria and yeast.
Drains are characterized as gravity, low-pressure bulb evac-
uators, spring reservoir, low pressure, or high pressure. Fluids 
from drains are optimal specimens for collection and sub-
mission to the microbiology laboratory. All fluids should be 
collected aseptically and transported to the laboratory in an 
appropriate device such as blood culture bottle (aerobic), ster-
ile, leak-proof container (ie, urine cup), or a citrate-containing 
blood collection tube to prevent clotting in the event that blood 
is present. Expected pathogens from gravity drains originate

from the skin or gastrointestinal tract; for the remaining drain 
types, skin flora represent the predominate pathogens.
G. Cutaneous Fungal Infections
The presence of fungi (molds or yeasts) on the skin poses a chal-
lenge to the clinician in determining if this represents contamina-
tion, saprophytic colonization, or is a true clinical infection. For 
convenience, the fungi have been listed by the type of mycosis 
they produce (Table 46): for example, dermatophytes typically 
produce tinea (ringworm)–type infections; dematiaceous (darkly 
pigmented molds and yeast-like fungi) cause both cutaneous and 
subcutaneous forms of mycosis; dimorphic fungi generally cause 
systemic mycosis and the presence of cutaneous lesions signifies 
either disseminated or primary (direct inoculation) infection; 
yeast-like fungi are usually agents of opportunistic types of mycoses 
but can also manifest as primary or disseminated disease as is true 
for the opportunistic molds (eg, Aspergillus spp, Fusarium spp). In 
addition to the recommended optimal specimens and associated 
cultures, fungal serology testing (complement fixation and immu-
nodiffusion performed in parallel, not independent of the other) 
is often beneficial in diagnosing agents of systemic mycosis, spe-
cifically those caused by Histoplasma and Coccidioides. In cases of 
active histoplasmosis and blastomycosis, the urine antigen test may 
be of value in identifying disseminated disease.
The clinician should be aware that dematiaceous fungi 
(named so because they appear darkly pigmented on laboratory 
media) do not always appear pigmented in tissue but rather hy-
aline in nature. To help differentiate the dematiaceous species, 
a Fontana-Masson stain (histopathology) should be performed 
to detect small quantities of melanin produced by these fungi. 
It is not uncommon for this group of fungi to be mistakenly 
misidentified by histology as a hyaline mold such as Aspergillus 
spp. This highlights the importance of correlating culture 
results with histological observations in determining the clin-
ical relevance since the observation of fungal elements in his-
topathology specimens is most likely indicative of active fungal 
invasion [244, 245].
XIII. ARTHROPOD-BORNE INFECTIONS
The clinical microbiology tests of value in establishing an etiol-
ogy of various arthropod-borne diseases are presented below. 
Those transmitted by ticks are most likely to require clinical 
laboratory support (Table 47). Borreliosis includes relapsing 
fever, Borrelia miyamotoi infection, and Lyme borreliosis; these 
diseases are transmitted by ticks to humans. Lyme borreliosis or 
Lyme disease (primarily due to infection with Borrelia burgdor-
feri or Borrelia mayonii in the United States), a multisystem dis-
ease that can affect the skin, nervous system, joints, and heart, is 
the most frequently reported tick-borne disease in the northern 
hemisphere [246]. Most commonly, early localized Lyme disease 
(LD) is diagnosed on clinical grounds, including the presence of

aThere is an US Food and Drug Administration–cleared NAAT for direct detection of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus from swabs of wounds and pus.
bMycoplasma hominis has caused infections post–joint surgery and post–abdominal surgery, particularly after cesarean deliveries. A series of sternal wound infections due to Legionella 
spp were traced to contamination of the hospital water supply. A post–hip surgery Legionella infection occurred after skin cleansing with tap water. Proper water treatment should remove 
the risk for such infections.

erythema migrans. Erythema migrans (EM; an expanding rash) 
was previously considered pathognomonic for Lyme borrelio-
sis; however, other infections can mimic this dermatologic pre-
sentation (eg, southern tick-associated rash illness, cellulitis). 
Diagnostic testing for LD in patients who present with a char-
acteristic EM rash, alongside an appropriate exposure history, 
is contraindicated, as antibodies to B. burgdorferi may not yet 
be detectable, leading to false-negative results and undertreat-
ment. While NAAT for LD-associated Borrelia spp is available 
through multiple reference laboratories, performance of this 
testing on whole blood or other blood fractions for detection of 
early disseminated or late stages of LD is not recommended due 
to low sensitivity in this specimen source.
A notable exception to this is NAAT for B. mayonii; this 
newly described agent of LD is associated with a higher level 
of spirochetemia, and given the lack of serologic assays able to 
detect specific antibodies to this species, NAAT of whole blood 
is recommended for detection of B. mayonii [247]. For atypical 
EM, serology may be obtained and, if negative, one may obtain 
a convalescent serum or continue observation to see if the EM 
becomes more characteristic. Otherwise, NAATs may be per-
formed on EM biopsy specimens to confirm early localized LD 
if the visual appearance of the EM rash is questionable. Serologic 
testing using a 2-tiered testing algorithm (TTTA) remains the 
testing methodology of choice for both early disseminated and 
late stages of LD. The TTTA currently recommended by the 
CDC involves an initial EIA or indirect fluorescent antibody 
(IFA) screen for antibodies to LD-associated Borrelia spp, fol-
lowed by supplemental Western blot or immunoblot testing for 
specific IgM- and IgG-class antibodies to B. burgdorferi in any 
sample positive or equivocal by an EIA/IFA screen. Immunoblot 
testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi should not be performed 
as a standalone test as specificity is reduced.
Borrelia burgdorferi–specific IgG and IgM scoring is based 
on the presence of at least 5 out of a possible 10 diagnostic IgG 
bands and 2 of a possible 3 IgM bands following reaching the 
threshold of a positive or equivocal screening EIA [248]. The 
IgM blot is not clinically meaningful in patients who present

30 days or longer after symptom onset due to high rates of false 
positivity. Additionally, seropositivity for both IgM- and IgG-
class antibodies to LD-associated Borrelia spp may persist for 
months to years (>10–15 years) following resolution of the 
infection [249]. Since positivity by the TTTA may reflect remote 
exposure rather than current infection, it is recommended that 
only symptomatic patients with an appropriate exposure history 
be tested for LD. Finally, multiple LD “specialty” laboratories 
have emerged in recent years, claiming expertise in tick-borne 
disease diagnosis and offering LD diagnostic assays with 
improved sensitivity [250, 251]. These laboratories may not be 
CLIA-approved and offer LD diagnostic assays using methods 
and interpretive criteria for which validation data has neither 
been made publically available nor been vetted by high-quality 
peer review. Submission of patient specimens to such laborato-
ries is not recommended.

aOther tick-borne diseases should be considered if patients have traveled to international destinations. Because travel between North America and Europe is common, Lyme borreliosis 
caused by Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii have been included in the table. Tick-borne rickettsial diseases such as African tick-bite fever (ATBF) or Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) occur 
worldwide and might have epidemiologic, seasonal, and clinical features that differ from those observed in the United States [253]. Of note, tick-borne disease caused by Rickettsia parkeri 
is emerging; this organism has a similar clinical presentation as ATBF and MSF with fever, headache, eschars, and regional lymphadenopathy [255]. State laboratories and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention can perform NAATs on swab or biopsy.
bOrganisms are best detected in blood while a patient is febrile. With subsequent febrile episodes, the number of circulating spirochetes decreases. Even during initial episodes, organisms 
are seen only 70% of the time.
cSpecial media and technical expertise is required for culture of Borrelia spp that cause relapsing fever. A centrifugation-based enrichment method followed by Giemsa staining is a rapid 
and viable approach [256].
dNot valuable for an immediate diagnosis; however, serologic testing is available through public health and some private laboratories. An acute serum (obtained within 7 days of the onset of 
symptoms) and convalescent serum (obtained at least 21 days after the onset of symptoms) should be submitted for testing. Of significance, early antibiotic treatment can blunt the antibody 
response and antibody levels may fall quickly during the months after exposure.
eTo date, 18 genomic species are reported in the literature; 3 are confirmed agents of localized, disseminated, and late manifestations of Lyme disease and are listed in the table. Another 
9 species have been described with possible pathogenic potential [257]. Serologic assays used in North America are designed to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These 
assays, particularly the blots, are insensitive for detection of B. garinii, B. afzelii, or B. mayonii antibodies. Immunoblots for detection of antibodies to B. garinii or B. afzelii are available at 
select commercial reference laboratories. Lyme VlsE-based ELISAs will detect infection with B. garinii or B. afzelii. Also, Lyme C6 testing is available and US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)–approved if suspicious for acquiring B. garinii or B. afzelii.
fEM is the only manifestation of Lyme disease in the United States that is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Positive culture rates 
for secondary EM lesions, primary EM lesions, and large-volume (≥9 mL) blood or plasma specimens are 90%, 60%, and 48%, respectively [258]. If skin is biopsied, >1 biopsy sample 
should be taken for culture due to uneven distribution of spirochetes; disinfect the skin prior to collection and submit tissues in sterile saline. Culture is rarely performed outside of research 
settings. Serologic testing in patients with early localized Lyme disease is insensitive and associated with a low negative predictive value due to the low level of antibodies present at this 
stage of infection.
gIxodes ticks have a broad host range, thereby increasing the chance of acquiring multiple pathogens from reservoir hosts. Thus, patients with one documented tick-transmitted disease are 
at increased risk for infection with another tick-transmitted organism. Patients with a diagnosis of Lyme disease have demonstrated immunoserologic evidence of coinfection with Babesia 
microti, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, or Ehrlichia spp; coinfection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (including Powassan/deer tick virus) should also be considered [259].
hPerform an IgM and an IgG Western blot (WB) during the first 4 weeks of illness on a patient with a positive EIA. An IgM WB is not interpretable after a patient has had symptoms for 
>1 month’s duration because the likelihood of a false-positive test result for a current infection is high in these persons; therefore, in patients with symptoms >4 weeks, only test an IgG WB 
(http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/healthcare/clinician_twotier.html). In addition, a positive IgM WB is considered positive only if 2 of the following 3 bands are present: 24 kDa, 39 kDa, and 41 kDa. 
Similarly, a positive IgG WB is considered positive only if 5 of the following 10 bands are present: 18 kDa, 21 kDa, 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa, 41 kDa, 45 kDa, 58 kDa, 66 kDa, and 93 kDa. 
Laboratories performing this testing are strongly encouraged to report only the presence/absence of these specified bands since misinterpretation of Lyme disease WBs can otherwise 
possibly occur.
iLaboratory assays for the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis are of limited clinical value [260].
jOther Lyme-associated diseases can be diagnosed by NAAT (turnaround time [TAT], 24-48 h) or culture (TAT
, 3 days to 6–12 weeks). Acceptable specimens for multiple erythemata or 
borrelial lymphocytoma, Lyme carditis, Lyme arthritis, and acrodermatitis are skin biopsy, endomyocardial biopsy, synovial fluid or biopsy, and skin biopsy, respectively [259, 261]. Although 
Borrelia can be detected by NAAT in blood or CSF
, its usefulness for the diagnosis of Lyme disease in these specimen sources is limited. For example, Borrelia DNA is detected in the blood 
of less than half of patients in the early acute stage of disease when the EM rash is present, and if symptoms of Lyme disease have been present for a month or more, spirochetes can no 
longer be found in blood. Similarly, NAAT testing of CSF specimens is positive in only about one-third of US patients with early neuroborreliosis, and is even less sensitive in patients with 
late neurologic disease. The utility of testing synovial fluid and other specimen types is not well established and should be considered only under special circumstances and skin biopsy is 
not generally recommended because patients with EM can be reasonably diagnosed and treated on the basis of history and clinical signs alone.
kCommunication with the laboratory is of paramount importance when ehrlichiosis is suspected, to ensure that Wright-stained peripheral blood smears will be carefully examined for intra-
cytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) in either monocytes or neutrophils or bands.
lSerologic testing for Anaplasma phagocytophilum is associated with a specificity of 83%–100%, with cross-reactivity occurring in patients infected with Ehrlichia spp, Rickettsia rickettsiae, 
and Coxiella burnetii, among others. A newly discovered Ehrlichia spp was reported to cause ehrlichiosis in Minnesota and Wisconsin; this Ehrlichia is closely related to Ehrlichia muris [262].
mSensitivity of IFA antibody titers for tick-borne rickettsial diseases (RMSF
, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis) is dependent on the timing of specimen collection; the IFA is estimated to be 
94%–100% sensitive after 14 days of onset of symptoms and sensitivity is increased if paired samples are tested.
nTreatment decisions for tick-borne rickettsial diseases for acutely ill patients should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory confirmation of a diagnosis. Fundamental understanding of 
signs, symptoms, and epidemiology of the disease is crucial in guiding requests for tests and interpretation of test results for ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, and RMSF
. Misuse of specialized 
tests for patients with low probability of disease and in areas with a low prevalence of disease might result in confusion.

Classical relapsing fever transmitted by the bites of soft
 
(argasid) ticks burdens residents or travelers to mainly the 
western United States, although sporadic cases occur in the 
south-central states. Louse-borne relapsing fever is endemic to 
tropical countries or may become epidemic in refugee camps; 
travelers would be the only patients who might present with 
louse-borne relapsing fever, and their diagnosis would be sim-
ilar to that for tick-borne relapsing fever. Relapsing fever pres-
ents as recurrent fevers of several days’ duration, terminating 
with crisis and resuming after a few days; febrile episodes are 
marked by the presence of large numbers of spirochetes in the 
peripheral blood. Relapsing fever-like borreliae (B. miyamotoi) 
transmitted by the same hard tick as that transmitting the agents 
of LD cause fever that has a less characteristic presentation and 
may be confused with human granulocytic anaplasmosis; spiro-
chetes are sparse in peripheral blood but are usually detectable 
by NAAT (particularly reverse-transcription PCR [RT-PCR]). 
Recent data suggest that both acute and convalescent sera from 
patients with B. miyamotoi infection are frequently reactive by 
first-tier serologic assays for LD (eg, C6 EIA) and convalescent 
sera may be positive of B. burgdorferi–specific IgM blots [252]. 
Despite this, testing for B. miyamotoi infection using B. burg-
dorferi serologic assays is not recommended.
In the United States, rickettsial diseases that are transmitted 
by ticks include Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) due to 
Rickettsia rickettsii; “mild” RMSF (Rickettsia parkeri and other 
spotted fever group Rickettsia spp), human granulocytic ana-
plasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), human monocytic 
ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), and ehrlichiosis caused by 
Ehrlichia ewingii or Ehrlichia muris [253, 254]. Although clin-
ically similar, these diseases are epidemiologically and etio-
logically distinct illnesses. Endemic typhus and flea-borne 
typhus (Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia felis, respectively) may 
also infect people in the United States, mainly in warmer sites 
where fleas are common throughout the year. Rare epidemic 
typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii) cases have been recorded in the 
United States from contact with flying squirrels or their nests. 
Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari), comprising a mild febrile dis-
ease with rash and eschar, is maintained by mouse mites in 
many large urban areas. The diagnosis of patients with these 
infections is challenging early in the course of their clinical 
infection since signs and symptoms are often nonspecific or 
mimic benign viral illnesses. Rash is usually present in most 
acute rickettsiosis, but skin color may prevent its recognition. 
The likelihood of severe morbidity or mortality with delaying 
treatment for RMSF means that patients should be presump-
tively treated without waiting for laboratory confirmation, 
which rests mainly on seroconversion.
In addition to borreliosis and rickettsial diseases, babesiosis, 
tularemia, Powassan/deer tick virus encephalitis, and Colorado 
tick fever virus are also transmitted by ticks in the United States. 
While not yet officially confirmed, emerging viruses, such as 
Heartland virus and Bourbon virus, are also strongly suspected 
to be transmitted to humans via tick vectors. With the excep-
tion of babesiosis, which may comprise as much as a third as 
many cases as Lyme borreliosis in some sites, these other tick-
borne infections are relatively rare (a tenth as common as Lyme 
borreliosis). Annually, tick-transmitted viral infections are on 
the order of 25 or fewer cases a year nationally; however, this is 
likely an underrepresentation due to the lack of available clini-
cal assays for routine detection of these emerging vector-borne 
infections. Most cases due to these less common infections pres-
ent with fever >38.9°C (>102°F) but other than the arboviral 
infections with neurologic signs, the presentation is nonspecific. 
Other than the use of NAAT and assessment of blood smears for 
detection of Babesia spp, laboratory confirmation of a diagnosis 
of these less common infections depends on seroconversion.
As the most of the organisms transmitted by ticks are infre-
quently encountered in clinical specimens, many clinical micro-
biology laboratories do not provide all of the services listed in 
the table below. Of significance, while relapsing fever, ehrlichi-
osis, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis can all be rapidly diagnosed 
by examining peripheral blood smears, a negative smear result 
does not necessarily rule out these tick-borne infections due 
to the often low and variable sensitivity of a peripheral blood 
smear examination. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and ele-
vated liver enzymes may also help establish the need for specif-
ically testing for these tick-borne infections.
Body lice may transmit the agent of trench fever (Bartonella 
quintana), and fleas that of diverse bartonelloses, including cat 
scratch disease due to Bartonella henselae. Transmission may 
occur by bites of these arthropods, but a more likely mode of 
exposure is to the infectious louse or flea excreta. The barton-
elloses may present as acute febrile disease, with or without 
lymphadenopathy. These gram-negative bacteria are fastidious 
and slow growing, requiring hemin and a humidified carbon 
dioxide atmosphere. If lymphadenopathy is present, aspirates 
may be cultured; whole blood needs to be lysed for effective 
cultivation. NAAT is more sensitive and rapid. The IFA test may 
confirm infection, particularly if seroconversion is documented; 
there is significant IgG cross-reactivity between the bartonellae, 
though, and thus specific identification of the infecting species 
may not be possible without cultures or NAATs.
While laboratory identification of arthropods submitted 
by patients can provide limited information with respect to 
exposure risk, testing of these arthropods for the presence of 
infectious agents has no clinical value. For example, testing of 
engorged or partially engorged ticks for tick-borne infectious 
organisms should be avoided as the presence of an organism 
(via nucleic acid detection) in a tick does not indicate that the 
infectious agent was transmitted to the patient. Symptomatic 
patients, not the removed arthropod, should be tested for spe-
cific vector-borne infections, guided by clinical presentation, 
duration of symptoms, and exposure history.

For all of the arthropod-borne infections, clinical specimens for 
culture, molecular analysis, and the majority of serologic assays 
are, for the most part, sent to reference laboratories. In addition, 
because most NAATs for the diseases listed are not FDA-cleared, 
such tests are not universally available. As with most infections, 
paired serologic testing of patients suspected of having a tick-
borne disease, with samples collected at presentation and at 3–4 
weeks of follow-up, provide the best probability of confirming a 
diagnosis. With these limitations in the availability of and perfor-
mance of various testing formats (ie, culture, molecular analysis, 
and the majority of serologic assays), the provider needs to check 
with the laboratory for availability of testing, the optimum testing 
approach, appropriate specimen source, and turnaround time.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of arthropod-borne 
infections:
• Arthropod-borne diseases may be difficult to diagnose 
because signs and symptoms are generally nonspecific early 
in infection, including fever, chills, aches, pains, and rashes.
• Patient residence, travel history, recent exposure, and poten-
tial for tick bite are important.
• Serology remains the best tool for confirming the diagnosis 
of Lyme disease.
• NAATs are the preferred diagnostic modality for acute 
infection with Anaplasma, B. miyamotoi, Babesia spp, and 
Ehrlichia spp. Babesia may also be a microscopic diagnosis 
where available.
• Consultation with the microbiology laboratory is normally 
required to determine the specimens accepted, the available 
diagnostic assays, the location of the testing laboratory, and 
the turnaround time for results.

. VIRAL SYNDROMES
This section will review commonly encountered viral infections 
in the United States, realizing that there are a myriad of viruses 
associated with human disease. Clinical microbiology labora-
tory tests that are commonly used to establish a diagnosis of 
viral infections are outlined below. Tests for HIV, EBV, CMV, 
VZV, HSV, human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), enteroviruses, 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, adenovirus, 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, BK virus, JC virus, hep-
atitis A to E viruses, parvovirus (erythrovirus) B19, measles, 
mumps, rubella, rabies virus, dengue virus, parechovirus, para-
influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, West Nile virus 
(and other encephalitides), and Zika virus are specifically high-
lighted. Not all clinical microbiology laboratories provide the 
comprehensive services outlined in the tables below, especially 
in the case of serologic and molecular tests. When the recom-
mended testing is not available in a local laboratory, it can often 
be referred to a reference or public health laboratory, although 
this approach may yield a delay in obtaining results.
Though an increasing number of molecular tests for infec-
tious agents are gaining FDA clearance, many molecular 
assays for viral pathogens are LDTs, offered by CLIA-certified 
laboratories. Although LDTs require validation according to 
CLIA requirements prior to clinical use, performance may 
vary between laboratories. Throughout this section, the acro-
nym NAAT generally refers to RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR. 
Other specific techniques may be substituted with appropriate 
validation.
While molecular assays offer strong laboratory evidence for 
the presence of a viral agent, serologic tests may not be as con-
clusive. Notably, detection of IgM-class antibodies against a va-
riety of viral agents may be associated with false-positive results 
[263]. Therefore, if the pretest probability of acute infection is 
low to moderate, it is good practice to measure IgG (or total IgG 
and IgM) antibodies at the time of presentation (acute phase) 
and 2–3 weeks later (convalescent phase) to assess for serocon-
version, or if possible and depending on the assay format, to 
demonstrate a 4-fold or greater rise in antibody titers. False-
positive results may also occur in assays measuring IgG-class 
antibodies, especially between closely related viruses (eg, fla-
viviruses). Additionally, maternal IgG antibodies readily cross 
the placenta and may confound laboratory results in neonates. 
Finally, the possibility of false-negative serologic results must 
also be recognized, particularly for patients who present soon 
after (~7 days) symptom onset or in patients who are signif-
icantly immunosuppressed. It is therefore important to care-
fully consider all patient factors, including age, co-circulating 
viruses, exposure and vaccination history, immunostatus, and 
timing of presentation when interpreting serologic results for 
diagnostic purposes.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of viral syndromes:
• Viral syndromes should be considered based on the patient’s 
age, immune status, exposure and vaccination history, and 
many other variables.
• Viral yields are highest early in the infectious process.
• Samples should be obtained and tested for the most likely 
agents, with residual specimen being stored (preferably fro-
zen) in the laboratory in case additional testing is necessary. 
Typically, it is not cost-effective to test initial samples broadly 
for numerous viruses.
• Sample collection and handling are essential components of 
obtaining a reliable viral test result; consult the microbiology 
laboratory to determine which specimens should be obtained 
and how to transport them to the laboratory.
• Many laboratories will not have broad virologic testing capa-
bilities, requiring specimens to be referred externally and 
resulting in longer turnaround times for results.
• Antibody cross-reactivity among some closely related viral 
agents may result in nonspecific serologic results.

• Tests for immunity, previous viral infection (eg, for tissue 
donors), and new infections may have different assay for-
mats, even when the same virus is being evaluated.
A. Human Immunodeficiency Virus
HIV type 1 (HIV-1) is an RNA virus with a genome consisting 
of 3 major genes encoding capsid proteins (gag p55, p24, and 
p17), reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase (pol p66, p51, 
and p31), and envelope glycoproteins (env pg160, gp120, and 
gp41). HIV viruses are classified based on the relatedness of 
their genome into types 1 and 2, groups, and clades. HIV-1 is 
categorized into groups M, O, and P, with M being most com-
mon [264, 265]. HIV-1 is more common than HIV type 2 (HIV-
2) in the United States, but the latter should be considered in 
persons who were born in, have traveled to, have received blood 
products from, or have had a sexual partner from West Africa, 
as well as those who have been similarly exposed to HIV-2–
infected persons in any geographic area.
After exposure to HIV, HIV RNA is detectable in plasma 
by 10–12 days, followed by appearance of HIV p24 antigen in 
serum or plasma at 15–17 days. Depending on the sensitivity 
of the serologic assays used, HIV-specific antibodies are detect-
able in serum or plasma at the earliest at 21 days after exposure. 
Performing an HIV RNA test after a negative initial antibody 
and/or antigen test in persons suspected of acute infection 
may therefore be helpful. Due to the time course of test posi-
tivity and the possibility of seronegativity, laboratory diagnosis 
of primary (acute) HIV-1 infection is usually based on a high 
quantitative HIV-1 RNA (viral load) result (typically >105 cop-
ies/mL) or qualitative detection of HIV-1 RNA and/or provi-
ral DNA (Table 48) [266]. However, in the setting of nonacute 
HIV infection, HIV viral load assays should be used with cau-
tion for diagnosis of HIV infection because of the possibility of 
false-positive results. Since false-positive results are generally of 
low copy number (<1000 copies/mL), low copy number results 
should prompt retesting of a second specimen. Notably, because 
there is a 10- to 12-day period after infection when serologic 
markers are not detectable, testing another specimen 2–4 weeks 
later should be considered if initial antibody, antigen, or RNA 
tests are negative. NAAT is not 100% sensitive in individuals 
with established HIV infection due to viral suppression, either 
naturally or therapeutically, or improper specimen collection/
handling. If NAAT is used to make a diagnosis of acute HIV-1 
infection, subsequent HIV-1 seroconversion by conventional 
serologic testing is recommended.
In the neonate, serologic testing is unreliable due to per-
sistence of maternal antibodies; quantitative HIV-1 RNA testing 
is as sensitive as qualitative HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA 
testing for the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection [267]. NAAT is rec-
ommended at 14–21 days, 1–2 months, and 4–6 months after 
birth, in infants born to HIV-1–infected mothers. Since the 
availability of HIV serologic assays in the 1980s, HIV screening 
tests have evolved to the current fourth- and fifth-generation 
assays in which recombinant and synthetic HIV peptide anti-
gens are used in the detection of HIV p24 antigen and specific 
IgM and IgG antibodies. Such assays generally yield positive 
results by 4–6 days after positive NAAT results. Fifth-generation 
screening assays have the advantage over fourth-generation 
assays in their ability to discriminate among HIV-1 p24 anti-
gen, HIV-1 antibodies, and HIV-2 antibodies.
HIV-1 p24 antigen is detected in serum or plasma usually by 
14–16 days after infection (before antibody becomes detectable), 
and it typically decreases below detection limits thereafter, limit-
ing the utility of p24 antigen testing alone for the diagnosis of HIV 
infection. The US Association of Public Health Laboratories and 
the CDC now recommend the use of fourth-generation assays 
for initial screening of individuals for diagnosis of HIV infection 
[264, 265]. The testing algorithm using such assays recommends

that serum or plasma specimens with reactive screening test 
results be tested in reflex with HIV antibody differentiation 
immunoassays that can distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibodies. If the antibody differentiation assay result is nega-
tive, further testing with a qualitative or quantitative NAAT is 
recommended to rule out acute HIV-1 infection. If the differen-
tiation assay is positive, viral load testing (and usually also CD4 
cell count determination) is recommended to direct manage-
ment. Alternatively, if a fifth-generation HIV antigen/antibody 
combination assay is used as the initial test and if only the HIV 
p24 antigen is reactive, then such specimens can be tested subse-
quently by NAAT, whereas those specimens that are reactive for 
HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies can be tested subsequently with HIV 
antibody differentiation assays. Use of third-generation screen-
ing assays is limited to the diagnosis of nonacute HIV-1 infec-
tion (Table 48), since these assays can detect only HIV-1 and 
HIV-2 antibodies. Serum or plasma specimens that are reactive 
with such screening assays can be tested further with HIV anti-
body differentiation assays for confirmation. Individuals with 
initially reactive results in whole blood, serum, plasma, or saliva 
tested with rapid HIV antibody-only or antigen-antibody assays 
(eg, point-of-care rapid tests) should be tested further by lab-
oratory-based fourth- or fifth-generation HIV immunoassays 
to determine the HIV infection status as described above. The 
current Association of Public Health Laboratories/CDC HIV 
testing algorithm no longer recommends supplemental HIV-1 
antibody Western blot testing because of the subjectivity, labor 
intensity, and limited access of this manual assay.
Antiviral drug resistance testing is recommended for patients 
with acute or chronic HIV infection prior to initiating therapy 
(including treatment-naive pregnant HIV-1–infected women), 
virologic failure during combination drug therapy, and subopti-
mal suppression of viral load after initiating therapy. Genotypic 
resistance testing is recommended generally for treatment-naive 
patients, while phenotypic resistance testing is reserved mainly 
for treatment-experienced patients whose genotypic HIV resis-
tance profiles show multiple resistance-associated mutations 
that could not predict an effective antiviral drug combination.
B. Epstein-Barr Virus
Epstein-Barr virus is a cause of mononucleosis among immu-
nocompetent individuals and lymphoproliferative disease in 
immunocompromised patients. An elevated white blood cell 
count with an increased percentage of atypical lymphocytes is 
common in EBV-associated mononucleosis. Heterophile anti-
bodies usually become detectable between the sixth and tenth 
day following symptom onset, increase through the second or 
third week of the illness and, thereafter, gradually decline over 
a year or longer. False-positive heterophile antibody results may 
be observed in patients with autoimmune disorders, leukemia, 
pancreatic carcinoma, viral hepatitis, or CMV infection. False-
negative results are obtained in approximately 10% of patients, 
and are especially common in children younger than 4 years.
When the results of rapid Monospot or heterophile testing 
are negative, additional laboratory testing (Table 49) may be 
considered to differentiate EBV infection from a mononucle-
osis-like illness caused by CMV, HIV, or Toxoplasma gondii. In 
this situation, EBV-specific antibody testing for IgG- and IgM-
class antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-
Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) is recommended. The presence of 
VCA IgM (with or without VCA IgG) antibodies in the absence 
of IgG antibodies to EBNA suggests recent, primary infection 
with EBV. The presence of anti-EBNA IgG antibodies indicates 
that infection occurred at least 6–12 weeks prior, and there-
fore, is suggestive of a past (remote) infection with EBV. IgG-
class antibodies to EBNA generally develop 2–3 months after 
primary infection and are detectable for life. Over 90% of the 
adult population has IgG-class antibodies to VCA and EBNA 
antigens, although approximately 5%–10% of patients who have 
been infected with EBV fail to develop antibodies to EBNA.
EBV is associated with lymphoproliferative disease in patients 
with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including 
patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, recipients 
of organ or peripheral blood stem cell transplants, and patients 
infected with HIV. An increase in the EBV viral load in periph-
eral blood or plasma, as measured by a quantitative NAAT, may 
occur in patients before the development of EBV-associated 
lymphoproliferative disease. Viral loads should be measured 
no more frequently than once per week, and these levels typ-
ically decrease with effective therapy. A difference in the viral 
load of ≥0.5 log10 between samples, preferably evaluated by 
the same assay, is typically required to demonstrate a signifi-
cant change. Conversion of EBV copies/mL to IU/mL using 
the World Health Organization (WHO) standard (or a WHO

traceable standard) allows for laboratory-to-laboratory com-
parison of results. Tissues from patients with EBV-associated 
lymphoproliferative disease may show monoclonal, oligoclonal, 
or polyclonal lesions. The diagnosis of EBV-associated lymph-
oproliferative disease (eg, posttransplant lymphoproliferative 
disorder) requires multiple tests, including quantitative NAAT, 
radiology (eg, positron emission tomography scan), and detec-
tion of EBV DNA, RNA, or protein in biopsy tissue.
NAATs may be used to detect EBV DNA in CSF of patients 
with AIDS-related CNS lymphoma. However, EBV DNA may 
also be present in the CSF of patients with other abnormalities 
(eg, CNS toxoplasmosis, pyogenic brain abscesses), and there-
fore, positivity is nondiagnostic. Detection of EBV-specific anti-
bodies in CSF may indicate CNS infection; however, it may also 
be observed if the CSF fluid becomes contaminated with blood 
during collection, or if there is transfer of antibodies across the 
blood–brain barrier. Calculation of the CSF-to-serum antibody 
index may be helpful, but this type of testing is not performed 
in most clinical laboratories.
C. Cytomegalovirus
Cytomegalovirus is a member of the Herpesviridae family and 
causes acute and latent infection. Infection with CMV is very com-
mon, resulting in mild or asymptomatic disease in most immu-
nocompetent individuals. However, CMV is a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised hosts, espe-
cially transplant recipients. Serologic testing for CMV-specific anti-
bodies is typically limited to pretransplant screening of the donor 
and recipient (Table 50). This is usually accomplished by testing 
for anti-CMV IgG-class antibodies, which, when present, indicate 
past exposure to CMV
. The utility of testing for IgM-class antibod-
ies is more limited, and may serve as an adjunct in the diagnosis 
of recent CMV infection; however, false-positive CMV IgM results 
may occur in patients infected with EBV or with immune disorders.
In recipients of solid organ or peripheral blood stem cell trans-
plants, monitoring CMV viral loads by a quantitative NAAT is 
used to diagnose CMV-associated signs and symptoms, to guide 
preemptive treatment, and to monitor response to antiviral ther-
apy. For laboratories using LDTs, Standard Reference Material 
(SRM) is available from the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology for CMV viral load measurement. SRM 2366, which 
consists of a bacterial artificial chromosome that contains the 
genome of the Towne strain of CMV, is used for assignment 
of the number of amplifiable genome copies of CMV/volume 
(eg, copies/μL). However, 4 FDA-approved assays (Abbott

Kit, Qiagen, Inc; Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan CMV Test, 
Roche Molecular Systems, Inc; Cobas CMV, Roche Molecular 
Systems, Inc) are now available that are calibrated against the 
WHO standard and allow for normalization of results to inter-
national units per milliliter. Conversion of copies/mL to IU/mL 
using the WHO standard (or a WHO traceable standard) allows 
for laboratory-to-laboratory comparison of results.
Cytomegalovirus can be cultured from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (and other clinical specimens). However, 
isolation is labor-intensive and can take up to 14 days. The turn-
around time can be reduced to 1–2 days with the use of the shell 
vial assay. In addition to a long turnaround time, culture-based 
assays have poor sensitivity for the recovery of CMV. Because 
the viral load is typically high and CMV is shed in the urine of 
newborns, urine culture for CMV continues to be used at some 
institutions for the diagnosis of congenital CMV infection.
Cytomegalovirus antigens can be demonstrated by immuno-
histochemical or in situ hybridization tests of formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded tissues. Cytomegalovirus DNA, detected 
using NAAT in a variety of clinical specimens, may be useful in 
diagnosing CMV disease.
Among immunocompromised patients with CMV infection, 
the potential exists for the emergence of resistance to antiviral 
agents. A variety of assays can be used to assess antiviral resistance, 
most commonly by sequencing of the UL97 (phosphotransferase 
gene) and UL54 (DNA polymerase gene) genes. Sequencing-based

assays are performed on DNA amplified directly from clinical 
specimens, provided they contain a sufficient quantity of CMV 
DNA. Alternatively, the virus can first be isolated in cell culture. 
Ganciclovir resistance most commonly emerges due to point 
mutations or deletions in UL97 (with foscarnet and cidofovir 
unaffected), with mutations at 3 codons (460, 594, 595) being 
most common. UL54 point mutations or deletions occur less fre-
quently. If UL54 mutations are selected by ganciclovir or cidofovir, 
there is typically cross-resistance to both ganciclovir and cidofovir 
but not foscarnet. However, if mutations are selected by foscarnet, 
there is usually no cross-resistance to ganciclovir or cidofovir.
NAATs may be used to detect CMV DNA in CSF of patients 
with suspected CMV CNS infection, but false-positive results 
may occur (eg, in patients with bacterial meningitis in whom 
CMV DNA in blood crosses the blood–brain barrier and con-
taminates CSF). Detection of antibodies in CSF may indicate 
CNS infection; however, it may also be observed if the CSF fluid 
becomes contaminated with blood during collection, or if there 
is transfer of antibodies across the blood–brain barrier.
D. Varicella Zoster Virus
Varicella zoster virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family 
and causes chickenpox and shingles (zoster). Serology is not 
usually recommended for the diagnosis of acute disease, but the 
presence of anti-VZV IgM antibodies typically indicates recent 
exposure to VZV
. However, an elevated IgM response may also be 
observed in patients with recent immunization to VZV or reac-
tivation of latent virus. A positive VZV IgG with a negative IgM 
result suggests previous exposure to VZV and/or response to vac-
cination. A negative IgG result coupled with a negative IgM result 
indicates the absence of prior exposure to VZV and no immunity, 
but does not rule out VZV infection as the serum specimen may 
have been collected before the appearance of detectable antibod-
ies. Negative results in suspected early VZV infection should be 
followed by testing a new serum specimen in 2–3 weeks.
Although viral culture can be used to recover VZV from clin-
ical specimens, it may take up to 14 days for cytopathic effect to 
be observed. Due to this delay in turnaround time, NAATs have 
become routinely used for the diagnosis of VZV and offer the 
most sensitive and rapid approach to detect the virus (Table 51). 
For dermal lesions that are suspected to be associated with 
VZV infection, a culture transport swab should be vigorously 
rubbed on the base of the suspect skin lesion; the vesicle may 
be unroofed to expose the base. The swab should then be placed 
in viral transport media and transported to the testing labora-
tory. A less sensitive method for diagnosis is detection of viral 
antigens by direct fluorescent antibody stain of lesion scrapings. 
Suspected VZV-associated skin lesions should be clinically dif-
ferentiated from smallpox. Information regarding clinical man-
ifestations of smallpox, including differentiation from VZV 
pocks, and laboratory testing can be found on the CDC website 
(https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/index.html).
VZV NAATs can be performed on CSF as an aid to the diag-
nosis of VZV CNS infection. Detection of anti-VZV IgM anti-
bodies in the CSF may also be used to support a diagnosis of 
VZV meningoencephalitis, but if performed, should be com-
pleted alongside evaluation of anti-VZV levels in serum and 
NAAT in CSF.
E. Herpes Simplex Virus
Herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and -2 (HSV-2) are com-
mon causes of dermal and genital lesions, but may also result in 
CNS disease or congenital infections. Serology should not be 
used a primary diagnostic test, but may assist in determining a 
patient’s exposure status to HSV-1/2. The presence of IgG-class 
antibodies to the HSV-1/2 glycoprotein G antigen indicates previ-
ous exposure to the corresponding serotype of the virus. Positive 
IgG results do not differentiate past from current, active infection 
unless seroconversion is determined by testing acute and conva-
lescent phase specimens. A 4-fold increase in anti-HSV IgG levels 
may suggest recent exposure; however, most commercial assays 
no longer yield a titered result that can be used quantitatively. The 
presence of IgM-class antibodies to HSV suggests primary infec-
tion; however, anti-HSV IgM reactivity is often absent at the time 
of lesion development, with IgM seroconversion occurring 1–2 
weeks after infection. Also, commercial IgM assays are not able 
to reliably distinguish between infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2, 
and may be falsely positive due to other viral infections, alloanti-
bodies present during pregnancy, or autoimmune disorders.
NAAT is the most sensitive, specific, and rapid test for 
diagnosis of HSV-associated skin or mucosal lesions and can 
detect and distinguish HSV-1/2 (Table 52). For collection of

specimens, a viral culture transport swab should be vigorously 
rubbed over the base of the suspect skin or mucosal lesion; the 
vesicle may be unroofed to expose the base. Older, dried, and 
scabbed lesions are less likely to yield positive results. Culture 
and direct fluorescent antibody testing are less sensitive than 
NAATs, especially for the detection of HSV-1/2 from CSF.
HSV NAATs are now considered the gold standard to diag-
nose HSV CNS disease [268]. The assay should detect and dis-
tinguish HSV-1/2; type 1 is most commonly associated with 
encephalitis and type 2 with meningitis. Viral culture of CSF is 
insensitive for diagnosis of HSV CNS disease and should not be 
used to rule out HSV encephalitis/meningitis.
F. Human Herpesvirus Type 6
Human herpes virus type 6 causes roseola infantum in children 
and can cause primary infection or reactivation in immuno-
compromised patients. Although serologic testing is not the 
preferred means of establishing a diagnosis of HHV-6 infection, 
IgG seroconversion, the demonstration of anti–HHV-6 IgM, or 
a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody titers using paired sera may indi-
cate recent infection. Commercial assays do not typically dis-
tinguish between variants A and B. Because of the ubiquitous 
nature of HHV-6, most people have been exposed to the virus 
by 2 years of age. Therefore, a single positive result for anti-
HHV-6 IgG may not be able to differentiate recent infection 
from remote exposure. The most commonly used molecular test 
for the laboratory diagnosis of HHV-6 is NAAT and at least one 
multiplex test platform for this is FDA-cleared; some of these 
tests differentiate variants A and B (Table 53). However, quali-
tative NAAT does not differentiate replicating from latent virus. 
HHV-6 DNA quantification may be useful in this regard, as 
well as in monitoring response to antiviral therapy. HHV-6 may 
be shed intermittently by healthy and immunocompromised 
hosts. Therefore, detection of HHV-6 in blood, body fluids, or 
even tissue does not definitively establish a diagnosis of disease 
caused by HHV-6. Chromosomally integrated HHV-6, which 
results in high HHV-6 levels in virtually all clinical specimens, 
may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of active infection. HHV-6 
can be cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (and 
other clinical specimens) [269]. However, viral isolation is 
labor-intensive, taking up to 21 days. The detection time can be 
shortened to 1–3 days with the use of shell vial culture assay. In 
addition to a long processing time, culture-based assays suffer 
from poor sensitivity and do not differentiate between variants 
A and B. If tissue biopsy is performed, HHV-6 antigens can be 
targeted by immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization tests 
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.
G. Parvovirus (Erythrovirus) B19
Parvovirus B19 is associated with a variety of clinical syn-
dromes including erythema infectiosum (ie, “slapped-cheek” 
rash or “gloves-and-socks” syndrome) or arthralgia/arthri-
tis in immunocompetent individuals, transient aplastic cri-
sis in patients with hemoglobinopathies or who are otherwise

immunosuppressed, and congenital infection and possibly fetal 
death (eg, hydrops fetalis) occurring in nonimmune women 
who acquire the virus during pregnancy. Disease is often bipha-
sic beginning as a self-resolving, nonspecific febrile illness, fol-
lowed by onset of rash and/or arthralgia approximately 1 week 
later. Importantly, the classic rash is immunologically mediated, 
as its appearance corresponds with development of an IgM anti-
body response to the virus. Serologic testing for the presence 
of IgM- and/or IgG-class antibodies to parvovirus B19 is the 
recommended diagnostic testing method for evaluation of a 
parvovirus B19 infection (Table 54). IgM-class antibodies to 
the virus are detectable within 10–12 days postinfection, with 
IgG detectable by 2 weeks [270–272]. Notably, approximately 
90% of patients presenting with erythema infectiosum have 
detectable IgM antibodies to parvovirus B19 at the time of pre-
sentation [272]. Antibodies to parvovirus B19 reach peak titers 
within 1 month, and while the presence of IgM-class antibod-
ies suggests recent infection, they can persist for months. The 
presence of IgG antibodies alone is indicative of past exposure; 
these may remain detectable for life and are thought to provide 
lasting immunity to reinfection. Serologic testing for parvovi-
rus B19 remains the recommended methodology for evaluation 
of pregnant women with possible exposure or infection; posi-
tive results for both IgM and IgG antibodies to parvovirus B19 
suggest infection within the last 3 months and a possible risk of 
infection to the fetus. Importantly, serologic tests may be neg-
ative in an immunocompromised host, despite prior exposure 
to the virus.
Parvovirus B19 NAATs may provide improved sensitivity 
over serologic methods in patients presenting with transient 
aplastic crisis or chronic anemia. Despite the lack of FDA-
cleared molecular assays for parvovirus B19, NAAT is the 
preferred noninvasive technique for laboratory diagnosis of 
parvovirus B19-related anemia in immunosuppressed individ-
uals, including solid organ transplant recipients. An important 
caveat regarding NAAT for diagnosis of parvovirus B19-related 
anemia is that parvovirus B19 DNA has been anecdotally 
detected for extended periods in serum, even in healthy indi-
viduals [273]. The presence of giant pronormoblasts in bone 
marrow is suggestive of parvovirus B19 infection, although 
such cells are not always detected.
H. Measles (Rubeola) Virus
Although endemic measles was proclaimed eliminated in the 
United States in 2000 as a result of high vaccination rates and 
vaccine efficacy (~97% following 2 doses), travel-associated 
cases (and spread among unvaccinated individuals) continue 
to occur (www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html). Immunity 
to measles is indicated by the presence of IgG-class antibodies 
to the virus. While diagnosis of recent (acute) measles infection 
can be made on clinical grounds, supportive laboratory find-
ings include a positive antimeasles IgM result. IgM antibodies 
are often positive by the time the rash appears, but up to 20% 
of patients may be serologically negative within the 72 hours 
after rash onset. Therefore, in suspected measles cases, initially 
seronegative cases during the acute stage, a second specimen 
collected 72 hours after rash onset should be collected and 
tested for antimeasles IgM to document seroconversion. IgM 
antibodies to measles may be detectable for a month or longer 
following disease onset and may also be positive in recently vac-
cinated individuals. A serologic diagnosis of acute measles may 
be established by demonstrating seroconversion of antimeasles 
IgG antibodies or a 4-fold rise in IgG titers between acute (col-
lected at the time of rash onset) and convalescent (collected 
10–30 days later) specimens (Table 55). Notably however, quan-
titative or semi-quantitative testing for antimeasles antibodies 
(ie, determining a titer) is no longer routinely available in local 
or reference laboratories. Measles virus can be isolated by cul-
ture or detected by NAAT from throat, nasal or nasopharyngeal 
swabs, or urine collected soon after rash onset; such testing is 
typically limited to public health laboratories [274].
Infrequently, measles infection may lead to development 
of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) later in life. 
Measurement of antibodies to measles in CSF is recommended 
in suspected cases of SSPE. Importantly, intrathecal antibody 
synthesis of these antibodies should be confirmed by ruling out 
introduction of antimeasles antibodies into the CSF via blood 
contamination (eg, during a traumatic lumbar puncture) or 
defective blood–brain barrier permeability.
I. Mumps Virus
Similar to measles, mumps is considered eliminated in the United 
States, though travel-associated cases among unvaccinated

individuals continue to occur, and while effective, the mumps 
vaccine has a protective rate of approximately 88% following 
administration of the 2 doses (www.cdc.gov/mumps/vaccina-
tion.html). Immunity to mumps is suggested by the presence of 
antimumps IgG-class antibodies. While mumps infection pres-
ents with classic symptoms (eg, parotitis), diagnosis of infection 
can be supported by a positive serologic test for antimumps IgM 
antibodies and/or seroconversion or a 4-fold rise of mumps 
IgG antibody levels between acute and convalescent phase sera 
(Table 56). Ideally, acute phase sera should be collected immedi-
ately upon suspicion of mumps virus infection and/or symptom 
onset and convalescent sera collected approximately 5–10 days 
thereafter. IgM antibodies to mumps typically become detectable 
during the first few days of illness, peak approximately 1 week 
after onset, and may remain detectable for a few months. As with 
serologic testing for measles, quantitative or semi-quantitative 
(ie, determining a titer) testing for mumps IgG-class antibodies 
is no longer routinely available in local or reference laboratories.
Notably, previously immunized patients who are subse-
quently infected with mumps may not develop a detectable IgM 
response to the virus. For such individuals, confirmation of 
mumps infection requires isolation of the virus itself or detec-
tion of viral RNA; these tests are largely limited to public health 
laboratories and the CDC. The preferred specimen source for 
culture and/or NAAT is an oral or buccal swab around the 
affected parotid gland and Stensen duct [275]. Mumps virus 
RNA may be detected prior to onset of parotitis until 5–9 days 
after symptom onset. Unlike for measles, urine samples are not 
considered as sensitive for mumps culture or NAAT, as the virus 
is often not detected in this specimen source until at least 4 days 
following symptom onset.
J. Rubella Virus
Rubella (German measles or 3-day measles) was officially pro-
claimed eliminated from the United States in 2004, largely due 
to intense vaccination efforts; with <10 cases reported per year, 
these are often travel associated and sporadic. Serologic testing 
for detection of antirubella antibodies can be used to establish 
immunity or to provide laboratory-based evidence for rubella 
infection (Table 57). The presence of IgG antibodies to rubella

virus in an asymptomatic individual indicates lifelong immu-
nity to infection. Acute rubella infection can be serologically 
confirmed by documenting seroconversion to IgM and/or 
IgG positivity or a 4-fold rise in antirubella IgG titers between 
acute and convalescent serum specimens. As with measles and 
mumps serologic assays, however, assays providing quantitative 
titers for antibodies to rubella are not commonly offered at local 
or reference laboratories.
Only approximately 50% of patients are positive for IgM 
antibodies to rubella at the time of rash onset, which empha-
sizes the importance of collecting a convalescent sample. Acute 
phase serum should be collected upon patient presentation and 
again 14–21 days (minimum of 7) days later. Due to the rarity of 
rubella in the United States and thus the low pretest probability 
of infection, serologic evaluation should only be performed in 
patients with appropriate exposure risks and a clinical presenta-
tion highly suggestive of acute rubella; in patients not meeting 
these criteria, positive rubella IgM results should be interpreted 
with caution as they may be falsely positive.
Congenital rubella syndrome can be diagnosed by the pres-
ence of IgM-class antibodies to rubella in a neonate, alongside 
symptoms consistent with congenital rubella syndrome, appro-
priate exposure history of the mother, and lack of maternal 
protective immunity. NAAT for detection of rubella RNA can 
be performed on throat or nasal swabs and urine, though such 
testing is largely limited to public health laboratories and/or the 
CDC. Specimens for NAAT should be collected within 7 days of 
presentation to enhance sensitivity.
K. BK Virus
BK virus is a polyomavirus that may cause allograft nephrop-
athy in renal transplant recipients and hemorrhagic cystitis, 
especially in bone marrow transplant patients. A definitive di-
agnosis of these conditions requires renal allograft biopsy with 
in situ hybridization for BK virus.
Detection of BK virus by NAAT in plasma may provide an early 
indication of allograft nephropathy, although there are currently 
no FDA-cleared NAATs (Table 58) [276]. Urine cytology or quan-
titative NAAT may be used as a screening test, and if positive, may 
be followed by BK viral load testing of plasma, which has a higher 
clinical specificity. As there are no FDA-cleared quantitative 
NAATs available for monitoring BK viral loads, each institution 
must establish a threshold for identifying patients at highest risk of 
BK virus–associated nephropathy. Urine NAATs for BK virus may 
be more sensitive than detection of decoy cells (virus-infected cells 
shed from the tubules or urinary tract epithelium) using urine 
cytology, as BK virus DNA is typically detectable earlier in the 
urine than are decoy cells. However, shedding of BK virus in urine 
is common. Therefore, if used as a screening test, only high levels 
(ie, above a laboratory-established threshold that correlates with 
disease) should be considered significant. Urine testing for BK 
virus places the laboratory at risk for specimen cross-contamina-
tion, as extremely high levels of virus in the urine may lead to car-
ryover between specimens and, potentially, false-positive results.
L. JC Virus
JC virus is the etiologic agent of progressive multifocal leukoen-
cephalopathy (PML), which is a fatal, demyelinating disease of 
the CNS that occurs in immunocompromised hosts. Histologic 
examination of brain biopsy tissue may reveal characteristic 
pathologic changes; however, in situ hybridization for JC virus 
may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Detection of JC virus 
DNA in CSF specimens by NAAT has largely replaced the need 
for tissue biopsy for laboratory diagnosis of PML (Table 59).

A serologic test (STRATIFY JCV) is now FDA-cleared for 
screening patients who are considering treatment with certain 
immunomodulating therapies (eg, natalizumab). A positive 
result by this test is indicative of prior exposure to JCV, and 
potentially elevated risk of developing PML, if initiating treat-
ment with the immunomodulating drug natalizumab.
M. Dengue Virus
Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes spp 
mosquitos and is most often associated with a febrile illness in 
travelers returning from endemic regions (eg, Caribbean, South 
and Central America, Asia). Diagnosis of DENV infection is 
most often established by serologic methods for detection of 
IgM- and/or IgG-class antibodies to the virus or detection of 
the DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen (Table 60). In 
cases of primary infection, IgM-class antibodies to DENV are 
detectable as early as 3–5 days after symptom onset and remain 
detectable for 2–3 months, whereas IgG antibodies to the virus 
appear 10–12 days after onset and are detectable for months to 
years [277]. Notably, in secondary or repeat DENV infection, 
IgM antibodies may not be detectable. An initially negative 
serologic profile for DENV in a patient for whom dengue fever 
is strongly suspected should be followed up with repeat sero-
logic evaluation on a serum specimen collected 7–10 days after 
disease onset. Seroconversion to either anti-DENV IgM and/
or IgG seropositivity is strongly suggestive of recent infection. 
However, due to the similar antigenic profiles between mem-
bers of the Flavivirus genus, false-positive results for antibodies 
to DENV may occur in patients with a prior flavivirus infec-
tion (eg, West Nile virus, St Louis encephalitis virus, or Zika 
virus). Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) are con-
sidered the reference standard for detection of antibodies to 
arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) and provide improved 
specificity over commercial serologic assays; however, due to 
the complexity of testing, PRNT is currently only available at 
select public health laboratories and the CDC.
Following infection with DENV, patients may be viremic for 
4–6 days after symptom onset. Though viral isolation is possible 
during this timeframe, it is not routinely performed in clinical 
laboratories [278]. Detection of DENV RNA by NAAT is pre-
ferred for acutely ill patients. Recently, detection of the DENV 
NS1 antigen, which is secreted from infected host cells as early 
as 1 day after symptom onset and up to 10 days thereafter, has 
become an acceptable alternative to NAAT for diagnosis of 
acute DENV infection.
N. Hepatitis A and E Viruses
Diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is confirmed 
by detecting HAV IgM antibody (Table 61). However, false-posi-
tive HAV IgM antibody results can occur due to low positive pre-
dictive value of assays used in population with low prevalence of 
acute hepatitis A [279]. The presence of HAV IgG antibody indi-
cates either past or resolved hepatitis A infection or immunity to 
this viral infection from vaccination. Alternatively, the same hep-
atitis A state can be deduced by the presence of combined HAV 
IgG and IgM total antibodies in an asymptomatic patient with 
normal liver tests and/or absence of HAV IgM antibody.
Hepatitis E is usually a foodborne illness in developing coun-
tries due to ingestion of hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmitted in 
contaminated food and water. However, such infection in devel-
oped countries may be encountered in return travelers (acute 
hepatitis E) or organ transplant recipients (acute or chronic) 
[280]. Because presentation of acute hepatitis A and E are indis-
tinguishable clinically from one another, diagnosis of the latter is 
made usually by presence of HEV IgM antibody (appearing by 
4–6 weeks after exposure and lasting for 2–4 months) and absence 
of HAV IgM antibody in serum or plasma. HEV IgG antibody is 
detectable in serum and plasma usually by 4 weeks after clinical 
presentation. However, with delayed humoral response in organ 
transplant recipients who are immunosuppressed from antirejec-
tion therapy and suspected to have acute hepatitis E, diagnosis 
may need to be made with molecular assays for detection of HEV 
RNA in serum or plasma. Individuals with ≥3 months of HEV 
viremia are considered to have chronic hepatitis E, and quantifi-
cation of HEV RNA in serum or plasma can be used to monitor 
disease progression and response to antiviral therapy.
O. Hepatitis B, D, and C Viruses
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may be detected in the 
presence of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 
[281]; it indicates that the person is infectious. In acute infec-
tion, its appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and 
it remains detectable for 1–6 weeks. The tests for detecting 
hepatitis B and D disease are primarily serologic and molecu-
lar (Table 62). Care providers should check with the laboratory

on the minimum volumes of blood needed, as some molecular 
platforms require more blood than others.
The presence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) indi-
cates recovery from and immunity to HBV infection, as a result 
of either natural infection or vaccination. In most patients with 
self-limited acute HBV infection, HBsAg and HBsAb are not 
detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma.
Hepatitis B core (HBc) IgM antibody appears during acute 
or recent HBV infection and remains detectable for about 
6 months. A serologic “window” occurs when HBsAg disap-
pears and HBsAb is undetectable. During this “window” period, 
infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM antibody.
HBc total antibodies appear at the onset of symptoms of 
acute hepatitis B infection and persist for life. Their presence 
indicates acute (positive HBc IgM antibodies), recent (both 
HBc IgM and HBc total antibodies), or previous (positive HBc 
total antibodies but negative HBc IgM antibody) HBV infec-
tion. There is currently no commercially available test for HBc 
IgG antibody in serum or plasma.
A chronic HBV carrier state is defined by persistence of 
HBsAg for at least 6 months. In patients with chronic hepati-
tis B, the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum 
or plasma is a marker of high viral replication levels in the 
liver. Loss of HBeAg and emergence of antibody to HBeAg 
(ie, HBe antibody) is usually associated with improvement of 
underlying hepatitis and a reduction in the risk of hepatocel-
lular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Alternatively, disappearance of 
HBeAg may denote the emergence of a precore mutant virus; 
high concentrations of HBsAg and HBV DNA, in the absence 
of HBeAg and presence of HBe antibody, suggest the presence 
of a HBV precore mutant virus. Hepatitis B viral DNA is pres-
ent in serum or plasma in acute and chronic hepatitis B infec-
tion [282]. Quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma 
may be included in the initial evaluation and management of 
chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when the serologic test 
results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation 
and monitoring a patient’s response to therapy. Other molec-
ular laboratory tests used in the diagnosis and management of

chronic hepatitis B infection have been reviewed and include 
assays for determining viral genotype, detection of genotypic 
drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore muta-
tions [282].
Detection of HBs antibody in the absence of HBc total anti-
bodies distinguishes vaccine-derived immunity from immunity 
acquired by natural infection (in which both HBs antibody and 
HBc total antibodies are present). Current commercially avail-
able assays for detecting HBs antibody yield positive results 
(qualitative) when antibody levels are ≥10 mIU/mL (or ≥10 
IU/L) in serum or plasma, indicating postvaccination immu-
nity (protective antibody level). Quantitative HBs antibody 
results are used to monitor adequacy of hepatitis B immuno-
globulin therapy in liver transplant recipients receiving such 
therapy during the posttransplant period.
In acute hepatitis D superinfection of a patient with known 
chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis D virus (HDV) antigen, HDV 
IgM, and total antibodies are present (Table 62). In acute hepa-
titis B and D coinfection, the same serologic markers (ie, HDV 
antigen, HDV IgM, and total antibodies) are present, along with 
HBc IgM antibody.
The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection usually 
begins with a screening test for HCV IgG antibody in serum 
or plasma immunoassays. Antibody may not be detectable 
until 6–10 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Individuals 
with negative HCV antibody screening test results do not need 
further testing for hepatitis C (Table 63), except in immuno-
compromised individuals (in whom development of HCV IgG 
antibody may be delayed for up to 6 months after exposure) or 
those with suspected acute HCV infection. Those with positive 
screening HCV IgG antibody test results should undergo con-
firmatory or supplemental testing for HCV RNA by molecular 
test methods. Signal-to-cutoff ratios (calculated by dividing the 
optical density value of the sample tested by the optical den-
sity value of the assay cutoff for that run) are an alternative 
to supplemental testing (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/
LabTesting.htm). Supplemental HCV IgG antibody assays 
can confirm the presence of HCV antibodies in patients with 
positive HCV IgG antibody screening test results, but none of 
these assays are currently FDA-approved for clinical use in the 
United States. According to the latest recommendations from 
the CDC [283], all individuals born during 1945–1965 should 
be screened at least once for evidence of HCV infection.
Hepatitis C virus RNA can be detected by NAATs soon after 
infection as well as in chronic infection. NAATs for HCV can 
be performed qualitatively or quantitatively (by RT-PCR or 
transcription-mediated amplification methods). Highly sen-
sitive molecular assays for quantification of HCV RNA in 
serum or plasma (limit of detection of ≤25 IU/mL) are neces-
sary to monitor patients’ virologic response and to determine 
cure (ie, sustained virologic response) from antiviral therapy. 
Determination of HCV genotype and subtypes (ie, 1–6 and 
1a vs 1b) is used to guide the choice and duration of antivi-
ral therapy and predict the likelihood of response to therapy, as 
different genotypes and subtypes varying in virologic response 
to current treatment regimens and in likelihood of antiviral 
resistance before or during direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treat-
ment. Pretreatment testing for HCV genome-specific resis-
tance-associated substitutions (RASs) by conventional (Sanger) 
or next-generation sequencing assay methods is recommended 
by the FDA and/or current clinical practice guideline (https://
www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/resistance) prior to initiating 
certain DAA therapy combinations for infection due to certain 
HCV genotypes: (1) HCV NS3 RAS for simeprevir in genotype 
1 infection, and (2) HCV NS5A RAS for elbasvir-grazoprevir 
or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 1a infection, and daclat-
asvir/sofosbuvir or velpatasvir/sofosbuvir in genotype 3 infec-
tion. Per recent recommendations from the FDA (https://www.
fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm522932.htm), all patients prior 
to initiating DAA therapy should be screened for evidence of 
prior or current HBV infection (positive for HBc total antibod-
ies and/or HBsAg), so that affected patients can be monitored 
and managed appropriately for reactivation of HBV during and 
after DAA therapy.

A human genomic polymorphism interleukin 28B (IL-28B) 
genotype CC (within an interferon-γ promoter region on 
human chromosome 9) is associated with good likelihood of 
spontaneous resolution of HCV infection in acutely infected 
individuals as well as high probability of sustained viral response 
in those receiving interferon-based combination therapy for 
chronic HCV infection. Now with interferon-based therapy no 
longer in use for chronically HCV-infected individuals, IL-28B 
genotype testing is used mainly to predict likelihood of sponta-
neous resolution of acute HCV infection.
P. Enterovirus and Parechovirus
Enteroviruses are a large group of viral pathogens that may cause 
disease ranging from mild respiratory infection, to paralysis or 
severe CNS infection. NAAT of CSF is more sensitive than viral 
culture for the diagnosis of enteroviral CNS infection (Table 64). 
Plasma or serum is useful for diagnosis of sepsis syndrome in a 
newborn due to enterovirus, but testing is less reliable beyond 
the newborn period. In the right clinical scenario, detection of 
enterovirus from throat or stool specimens may provide circum-
stantial evidence of CNS infection; however, if this is performed, 
it should be accompanied by NAAT testing of CSF.
Serologic evaluation for enteroviruses requires assessment of 
acute and convalescent titers, due to the high seroprevalence 
in the population. Therefore, serology is typically not useful in 
clinical practice, with the exception of determining whether a 
patient with myocarditis has had exposure to enteroviruses (eg, 
Coxsackie B virus).
Parechoviruses have clinical presentations similar to entero-
viruses, but are classified as a different genus and require a spe-
cific NAAT for detection (laboratory validated only, except for 
one current multiplex assay that is FDA-cleared).
Q. Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Respiratory syncytial virus causes bronchiolitis and/or pneumo-
nia and is most common in infants and young children, although 
it can cause respiratory illness in adults and severe disease in 
immunocompromised hosts. NAAT testing has become the 
diagnostic method of choice, and the preferred specimen types 
include a nasopharyngeal swab or BAL fluid, if the patient has 
evidence of lower respiratory tract infection (Table 65). Several 
FDA-cleared NAAT platforms exist. Although RSV can be 
recovered in routine viral culture, this approach is time-consum-
ing and cytopathic effect may not be observed for up to 2 weeks.
Serology is not recommended as a diagnostic method in 
patients with suspected RSV infection. The seroprevalence to 
RSV is high, and the presence of IgG-class antibodies generally 
indicates past exposure and immunity.
R. Influenza Virus Infection
Rapid diagnosis of influenza virus infection (≤48 hours following 
the onset of symptoms) is needed to facilitate early administration 
of antiviral therapy. The virus may be rapidly detected by NAAT or 
direct antigen detection from a nasopharyngeal swab (Table 66). 
Sensitivity is higher for NAAT than rapid antigen detection. Rapid 
screening tests may perform poorly during influenza season 
(especially for detection of pandemic H1N1 and swine-associated 
H3N2 strains), and negative tests should be confirmed by NAAT 
or culture prior to ruling out influenza infection. During seasons 
of low prevalence of influenza, false-positive tests are more likely 
to occur when using rapid antigen tests. The performance of 
influenza assays, including NAAT and rapid antigen tests, varies 
depending on the assay and the circulating strains. NAAT is now 
considered the gold standard for detection of influenza virus in 
clinical samples. Several FDA-cleared NAAT platforms exist.
Influenza virus can be recovered in routine viral cell culture, 
but confirmation is needed, typically through the use of hemad-
sorption and/or hemagglutination techniques. Serologic testing 
is not useful for the routine diagnosis of influenza due to high 
rates of vaccination and/or prior exposure.
S. West Nile Virus
West Nile virus (WNV), alongside other endemic arbovi-
ruses including St Louis encephalitis, Lacrosse encephalitis, 
and California encephalitis viruses, can cause CNS infections.

Laboratory diagnosis of WNV, and most other arboviruses, is 
typically accomplished by detecting virus-specific IgM- and/
or IgG-class antibodies in serum and/or CSF [284] (Table 67). 
IgM antibodies to WNV are detectable 3–8 days after symp-
tom onset and often taper off 2–3 months later, though serop-
ersistence in serum for up to 12 months has been documented. 
Seroconversion to anti-WNV IgM and/or IgG positivity 
between acute and convalescent sera (collected 7–10 days 
apart) is strongly suggestive of a recent WNV infection. The 
presence of anti-WNV IgG alone at the time of presentation is 
indicative of prior WNV infection, and evaluation for an alter-
native etiology is recommended. Serologic diagnosis of WNV 
CNS infection may be established by detection of IgM anti-
bodies to WNV in CSF as antibodies in this class do not nat-
urally cross the blood–brain barrier. However, introduction 
of blood into the CSF during a traumatic lumbar puncture or 
defective permeability of the blood–brain barrier may lead to 
falsely elevated IgM levels in the CSF. False-positive results for 
both anti-WNV IgM and IgG antibodies may occur in patients 
who have been vaccinated against yellow fever virus or fol-
lowing natural infection with other flaviviruses (eg, dengue, 
St Louis encephalitis viruses). To rule out cross-reactivity, it 
is recommended that specimens reactive for WNV antibodies 
be tested by PRNT.
Detection of WNV RNA by NAAT in serum and CSF is asso-
ciated with higher sensitivity in immunosuppressed patients 
due to the delayed immune response and thus prolonged WNV 
viremia in this population. Viral culture, while possible, is insen-
sitive and not routinely offered at local or reference laboratories.
T. Adenovirus
In otherwise healthy individuals, adenoviruses may cause mild, 
self-limiting respiratory illness or conjunctivitis, with most 
cases being diagnosed on clinical grounds. Occasionally, adeno-
virus infections in immunocompetent hosts can result in death, 
especially in children with asthma. In immunocompromised 
patients, adenoviruses may cause pneumonia, disseminated in-
fection, gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, meningoencepha-
litis, or hepatitis.
The diagnosis of adenoviral infections is typically made using 
NAAT, viral culture, and/or histopathology (Table 68). Viral 
culture has a long turnaround time (~5 to 7 days), but this can 
be reduced by using shell vial technology. Plasma viral load 
(assessed by quantitative NAAT) may be useful as a marker for 
preemptive therapy, to diagnose adenovirus-associated signs 
and symptoms, and to monitor response to antiviral therapy in 
some immunocompromised populations.
U. Rabies Virus
Rabies virus infects the CNS and is most often transmitted 
through the bite of a rabid animal. Diagnostic testing for rabies 
is not offered through most hospital or reference laboratories; 
therefore, consultation with a local public health laboratory 
or the CDC should be performed immediately in suspected 
rabies cases.
No single test is sufficient to diagnose rabies antemortem 
(Table 69). NAATs and viral isolation can be performed on sa-
liva, immunohistochemistry may be performed on skin biop-
sies at the nape of the neck for detection of rabies antigen in the

cutaneous nerves, and antirabies antibody testing is available 
for serum and CSF specimens. Postmortem histopathology of 
brain biopsies in patients with rabies are notable for mononu-
clear infiltration, perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes, lympho-
cytic foci, and Negri bodies. Serologic testing may be used to 
document postvaccination seroconversion, if there is signifi-
cant deviation from a prophylaxis schedule.
V. Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a rodent-
borne virus that can cause meningoencephalitis and may be 
life-threatening in immunosuppressed persons. Serologic test-
ing is the mainstay of diagnosis for LCMV infection, and is typ-
ically established by demonstrating a 4-fold or greater increase 
in IgG-class antibody titers between acute and convalescent 
phase serum samples, or by detection of anti-LCMV IgM anti-
bodies (Table 70). Detection of antibodies in the CSF may indi-
cate CNS infection; however, it may also be observed if the CSF 
fluid becomes contaminated with blood during collection, or 
if there is transfer of antibodies across the blood–brain barrier. 
NAAT can also be used to diagnose LCMV infection, but is lim-
ited to select public health laboratories.
W. Human Coronavirus
The coronaviruses are host specific and can infect a variety 
of animals as well as humans. Four distinct genera have been 
described with human pathogens belonging to the genera 
alphacoronavirus (229E and NL63) and betacoronavirus, lin-
eage A (OC43 and HKU1) lineage B (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome [SARS] coronavirus), and lineage C (Middle East 
respiratory syndrome [MERS] coronavirus).
Human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 are 
associated with the common cold with symptoms of rhinorrhea, 
congestion, sore throat, sneezing, and cough and may present 
with fever. In children, the viruses have also caused exacerba-
tion of asthma and otitis media.
Respiratory secretions or nasopharyngeal swabs placed in 
appropriate VTM are the specimens of choice. Diagnostic tests 
include NAATs, which are now common in commercial respi-
ratory panels.
Suspected cases of SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus 
require immediate notification to the laboratory. Guidance for 
testing can be found at www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html and www.
cdc.gov/coronavirus/MERS/index.html.
X. Parainfluenza
Parainfluenza viruses are a major cause of croup (laryngo-
tracheobronchitis), bronchiolitis, and pneumonia as well as 
upper respiratory tract infections. Of the 4 antigenically dis-
tinct types, types 1 and 2 are most commonly associated with 
croup syndrome, while type 3 is associated most commonly 
with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Parainfluenza virus infec-
tions account for up to 11% of all hospitalizations in children 
<5 years old [285].
Respiratory secretions or nasopharyngeal swabs placed in 
appropriate VTM are the specimens of choice. Diagnostic tests 
include culture, which may take 4–7 days for detection, and 
NAATs, which are now common in commercial respiratory 
panels.
Y. Human Metapneumovirus
Human metapneumovirus has been shown to cause acute respi-
ratory tract disease in people of all ages. The virus has been 
associated with cases of bronchiolitis in infants as well as pneu-
monia, exacerbations of asthma and croup, and upper respira-
tory infections with concomitant otitis media in children. Most 
commonly, children present with mild to moderate symptoms.

exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pneu-
monia have been detailed in adults. When diagnostic tests are 
required, the specimens of choice are respiratory secretions or 
nasopharyngeal swabs placed in VTM. Diagnostic tests include 
immunofluorescent assays and NAATs, which are now available 
in several commercial respiratory panels.
Z. Zika Virus
Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flavivirus genus and trans-
mitted by Aedes spp mosquitos, has been causally linked to con-
genital birth defects, including microcephaly [286]. Diagnostic 
tests available for ZIKV include NAATs for viral RNA, sero-
logic evaluation for IgM antibodies to the virus, and PRNTs, 
considered the reference standard for detection of neutralizing 
antibodies to arboviruses (Table 71). Selection between these 
methodologies (ie, NAAT vs serology) is primarily dependent 
on when the patient presents in relation to symptom onset or 
last possible exposure to ZIKV [287]. Currently, the CDC rec-
ommends molecular testing by NAAT on serum and urine in 
symptomatic patients and pregnant women with illness duration 
of 14 days or less. While a positive NAAT result for ZIKV is diag-
nostic for infection, a negative result does not exclude infection 
as viremia or viruria may have passed by the time the specimen 
was collected. Patients negative by NAAT, particularly pregnant 
women, for whom ZIKV infection remains in the differential, 
should be evaluated using a serologic assay for antibodies to 
the virus. The most current guidelines and recommendations 
regarding evaluation and testing for ZIKV can be found on the 
CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/index.
html). False-positive ZIKV IgM serologic results may occur in 
patients with a prior or current infection with a closely related fla-
vivirus, including WNV or DENV. Therefore, clinical decisions 
regarding patient management should not be based on a reac-
tive ZIKV IgM serologic result alone. Confirmatory PRNTs for 
ZIKV neutralizing antibodies should be performed for all sam-
ples reactive by an anti-ZIKV IgM serologic assay. Finally, due 
to co-circulation of DENV and Chikungunya viruses in regions 
where ZIKV is endemic, and the often-times similar disease 
manifestation among these arboviruses, concurrent evaluation 
for DENV and Chikungunya virus should be considered.
XV. BLOOD AND 
TISSUE PARASITE INFECTIONS
Blood and tissue parasites comprise a large number of protozoa 
and helminths found in both tropical and temperate climates 
worldwide [288–290]. Some parasitic infections are associated 
with high morbidity and mortality (eg, malaria, amebic encepha-
litis), whereas others cause only mild or asymptomatic disease (eg, 
filariasis due to Mansonella spp, toxoplasmosis in immunocom-
petent adults). As expected, the most commonly submitted spec-
imens for laboratory identification of these parasites are whole 
blood, tissue aspirates/biopsies, and serum for serologic studies.
Microscopy remains the cornerstone of laboratory testing for 
the identification of most blood parasites and many tissue par-
asites [289–291]. Expert microscopic examination of Giemsa-
stained thick and thin peripheral blood films is used for detection 
and identification of the protozoan blood parasites Plasmodium, 
Babesia, and Trypanosoma, and the filarial nematodes Brugia,

Wuchereria, Loa loa, and Mansonella, whereas microscopic 
examination, culture and/or nucleic acid amplification of ulcer 
samples, bone marrow, tissue aspirates, and biopsies are useful 
in the diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis, 
trichinosis, toxoplasmosis, and leishmaniasis. Although requir-
ing a minimal amount of reagents and equipment, the accuracy 
of microscopic methods requires well-trained and experienced 
technologists. Even in the best hands, diagnosis may be ham-
pered by sparseness of organisms on the slide and the sub-
jective nature of differentiating similar-appearing organisms 
(Plasmodium vs Babesia; various microfilariae) or in identifying 
the species of Plasmodium present. The laboratory can enhance 
the sensitivity of these methods by employing a number of con-
centration procedures such as buffy coat examination, centrif-
ugation, and filtration. In all of these procedures, samples must 
be properly obtained, transported to the laboratory as quickly as 
possible, and processed in a timely fashion to preserve organism 
viability and/or morphology. Organism viability and morphol-
ogy may be adversely affected by a number of different factors 
including temperature, humidity, and exposure to fixatives or 
anticoagulants. Transportation requirements are described for 
each organism in the corresponding sections below.
Serologic assays for detection of antibodies are available as 
adjunctive methods for the diagnosis of a number of blood and 
tissue parasite infections. Unfortunately, none are sensitive or 
specific enough to be used to establish the diagnosis on their own. 
In particular, assays for infection with one helminth will often 
cross-react with antibodies to a different helminth [290]. When 
available, antibody titers may be used to determine the strength 
of the immune response or detect a trend in antibody levels over 
time. IFA can provide quantitative titer results but reading the 
slides is subjective and inherently prone to varying results. In 
contrast, EIAs typically provide only qualitative positive or nega-
tive results determined by an arbitrarily set breakpoint. Thus, cli-
nicians will not be able to determine if a positive result was a very 
strong positive or a very weak one without calling the laboratory 
for more information. This can have important implications for 
interpretation of results that are not entirely consistent with the 
clinical picture. In some cases, it is desirable to confirm the result 
of an EIA by using a more specific immunoblot assay.
Laboratory methods that detect parasite antigens and/or nucleic 
acid provide an attractive alternative to traditional morphologic 
and serologic techniques. For example, a simple rapid immu-
nochromatographic card assay for the detection of Plasmodium 
(BinaxNOW Malaria, Alere, Waltham, Massachusetts) has been 
cleared by the FDA for in vitro diagnostic use, and many more 
assays are commercially available for this purpose outside of the 
United States [292]. Rapid detection tests (RDTs) are particu-
larly useful in acute care settings such as emergency departments 
or outpatient clinics to establish a diagnosis of malaria quickly 
while awaiting results of confirmatory blood films. These meth-
ods are also commonly used in smaller laboratories or during 
times (eg, night shift) when personnel with sufficient expertise 
to screen and interpret blood films for parasites. In general, most 
malaria RDTs, including the BinaxNOW Malaria, are adequately 
sensitive in typical patients with symptomatic malaria (“fever 
and chills”) but lose sensitivity when the parasitemia is very low 
or infection is due to non-falciparum species [292]. Finally, the 
CDC [289] and a number of reference laboratories in the United 
States, Canada, and Europe perform extremely sensitive NAATs 
such as real-time PCR assays for certain blood and tissue para-
sites, including Plasmodium, Babesia, Toxoplasma, and the agents 
of amebic encephalitis. Clinicians should consult their micro-
biology laboratory to determine if their reference laboratory or 
other entity offers the desired testing. Molecular assays may be of 
particular use in patients with very low parasitemias or in specif-
ically identifying organisms that cannot be differentiated micro-
scopically. However, DNA may persist for days or weeks after 
successful treatment and detection does not necessarily correlate 
with the presence of viable organisms. In addition, the current 
restriction to the reference laboratory setting means that the time 
from specimen collection to receipt of result may be longer than 
desired for optimal patient care. In situations where infection is 
potentially life-threatening, initial testing should be performed 
locally and empiric treatment should be considered while await-
ing results from the outside laboratory.
Key points for the laboratory diagnosis of blood and tissue 
parasites:
• Microscopy is the cornerstone of laboratory identification 
but is highly subjective and dependent on technologist expe-
rience and training.
• Proper specimen collection and transport are essential com-
ponents of morphology and culture-based techniques.
• Serology shows significant cross-reactivity among helminths, 
including filaria.
• There are a limited number of antigen detection methods 
available for blood and tissue parasites in the United States.
• Automated hematology analyzers may fail to detect malaria 
or babesiosis parasites; request manual stain and evaluation 
if either agent is suspected.
• NAATs are useful for detection of low parasitemia or in spe-
cifically identifying organisms that cannot be differentiated 
microscopically.
• Antigen and nucleic acid detection methods should not be 
used to monitor response to therapy, since antigen or DNA 
may be detectable for days to weeks after successful treatment.
• NAATs for detecting blood and tissue parasites are currently 
available only from specialized laboratories and turnaround 
time may be prolonged.

to Naegleria fowleri, 
Acanthamoeba spp, and 
Balamuthia mandrillaris 
(free-living amebae)
Microscopy and culture of CSF or brain tissue
Specimens for culture should not be refrigerated. Balamuthia 
mandrillaris does not grow on standard agar (requires specialized 
cell culture). PCR from tissue or CSF is available from the CDC 
and some reference labs. Stained and unstained tissue slides 
may also be sent for identification of amebic trophozoites and/
or cysts.
Angiostrongyliasis and 
Gnathostomiasis
Serology available at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, 
Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand (http://www.
tm.mahidol.ac.th/en/tmhm/index-m.htm)
In eosinophilic meningitis, larvae may be rarely seen in CSF
. Larvae 
may also be seen in tissue sections with associated eosinophils 
and/or necrosis.
Babesiosis due to Babesia 
microti, Babesia divergens, 
Babesia duncani, and 
Babesia sp MO-1 strain
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood 
films
Real time PCR available from CDC and reference labs. Most PCR 
assays detect B. microti only. Serology does not distinguish be-
tween acute and past infection.
Baylisascaris encephalitis
Serology available from the CDC
Larvae may be seen on histopathologic sections of brain tissue.
Cysticercosis and 
echinococcosis
Serology from the CDC or referral laboratories. Cross- 
reactivity may be observed between tests for 
either organism.
Encysted larvae and/or hooklets can be seen in tissue biopsies or 
aspirates of cysts (echinococcosis).
Filariasis due to species of 
Wuchereria, Brugia, and 
Mansonella
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood 
films. Examination of concentrated blood speci-
mens (Knott, Nuclepore filtered blood, or buffy coat) 
increases sensitivity. Antibody and/or antigen de-
tection EIA (Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi) 
in blood by the CDC or reference lab
Blood films for W. bancrofti and B. malayi should be collected 
between 10 am and 2 pm when microfilariae are circulating. 
Repeat exams may be necessary due to low parasitemia. 
Serology does not differentiate between these filariae.
Filariasis, onchocerciasis
due to Onchocerca volvulus
Microscopy of “skin snip” after incubation in saline 
at 37°C.
“Skin snips” should be from areas nearby nodules and should 
be “razor thin” with no visible blood. Histopathologic examina-
tion of skin biopsy or resected nodule (onchocercoma) can iden-
tify microfilariae and/or adults. Serology from reference lab; does 
not differentiate between filaria.
Leishmaniasis, cutaneous
due to various Leishmania spp
Microscopic exam of Giemsa-stained smears of bi-
opsy touch impressions or aspirate from leading 
edge of ulcer; culture and PCR are available through 
the CDC (contact CDC for collection kit prior to 
collecting biopsy)
Treatment is dependent on species identification (using culture 
or PCR) for disease acquired in South or Central America. 
Histopathology is less sensitive than impression smears, culture, 
and PCR. Serology is not useful for cutaneous disease.
Leishmaniasis, visceral due to 
various Leishmania spp
Microscopic exam of Giemsa-stained bone marrow 
aspirate/ 
biopsy, splenic aspirate; culture, PCR and serology 
is available from the CDC (contact CDC for collec-
tion kit prior to collecting biopsy)
Positive rK39 serology is reported to be both sensitive and specific 
for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in various endemic 
areas of the world.
Malaria due to Plasmodium 
falciparum, Plasmodium 
ovale, Plasmodium vivax, 
Plasmodium malariae, 
Plasmodium knowlesi
Stat microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick 
and thin blood films (repeat testing every 12–24 h 
for a total of 3 exams before ruling out malaria); 
rapid antigen detection tests followed by confirma-
tory blood films within 12–24 h
Antigen tests lack sensitivity with low parasitemia and non-fal-
ciparum malaria and do not differentiate all species. PCR 
from some reference laboratories will detect and differentiate all 
species. Calculation of percentage parasitemia (using thick or 
thin blood films) is required for determining patient manage-
ment and following response to therapy.
Toxocariasis (visceral larva 
migrans)
Serology from CDC or referral laboratories
Larvae are only rarely seen in histopathologic sections of biopsies 
of liver or other infected tissues.
Toxoplasmosis due to 
Toxoplasma gondii
Serology (IFA, EIA, ELFA) from CDC or reference lab 
for detection of IgM and IgG. Positive IgG seen 
in up to 15%–40% of US population due to pre-
vious exposure. IgG avidity test and serial titers 
may distinguish between recent and past infection.
Cysts and tachyzoites can be seen in specimens from immunocom-
promised patients (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, brain biopsy); PCR 
is available from some reference labs.
Trichinosis due to Trichinella 
spiralis and other species
Serology (EIA) from the CDC or reference lab
Encysted larvae can be seen in histopathologic sections of muscle 
biopsies.
Trypanosomiasis, African 
(African sleeping sickness) 
due to Trypanosoma brucei 
gambiense (West African) 
or T
. b. rhodesiense (East 
African)
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood 
films or buffy coat preps. Parasitemia is often 
low, requiring repeated exams. Aspirates of 
chancres and lymph nodes may also be examined. 
Centrifuged CSF should be examined to eval-
uate for late stage disease. 
There is an infection 
hazard from live organisms in blood specimens.
Plasma cells with large eosinophilic antibody globules may be seen 
in CSF and brain biopsy. Card agglutination test for trypanosomi-
asis is available in endemic settings for detection of T
. b. gambi-
ense infection. Contact the CDC or Prince Leopold Institute of 
Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium (http://www. 
itg.be/E/card-agglutination-test-for-human-trypanosomiasis).
American trypanosomiasis 
(Chagas disease) due to 
Trypanosoma cruzi
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood 
films or buffy coat preps. Serology available through 
the CDC. There is an infection hazard from live 
organism in blood specimens.
Parasitemia is very low in chronic infection. IgG antibody may 
persist for decades and its presence is considered evidence of 
chronic infection. An FDA-approved test is available for screening 
blood donors but is not available for diagnostic purposes.

bolded. Subsequent sections A and B provide more detailed in-
formation on the diagnosis of parasitic infections that are of par-
ticular concern to practitioners in North America (babesiosis 
and American trypanosomiasis) or in which rapid and accurate 
diagnosis is crucial because of the life-threatening nature of the 
infection (malaria and babesiosis). With all testing, it is impor-
tant to note that results are only as reliable as the experience, 
resources, and expertise of the laboratory performing the tests. 
In general, large public health and reference laboratories are 
more likely than community laboratories to have the experience 
and volume of specimens to properly validate the more esoteric 
tests. Direct communication by phone or email will sometimes 
hasten specimen processing and result reporting from public 
health laboratories, especially when there is an urgent clinical 
situation. The DPDx website at the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/
dpdx/diagnosticprocedures/index.html) provides a list of cur-
rently available diagnostic tests for parasitic infections available 
from the CDC. The CDC also provides a valuable telediagnos-
tic consultation service that can be accessed through the DPDx 
website for both the laboratorian and clinician. The availability 
of rapid shipping methods (FedEx, United Parcel Service, United 
States Postal Service, etc) and email or other electronic commu-
nication allow reporting of results from specialty laboratories, 
including those in Europe and Asia, in surprisingly short peri-
ods of time. It is useful to obtain shipping information from such 
laboratories to avoid unnecessary delays because of customs or 
airline regulations or other delivery problems.
A. Babesia and Malaria
Babesiosis is caused primarily by Babesia microti in the United 
States and Babesia divergens in Europe [293]. More recently, 
a small number of infections occurring in California and 
Washington have been attributed to Babesia duncani, while 
B. divergens–like organisms including the MO-1 strain have 
been detected in patients residing in Missouri, Kentucky, 
Washington, and Arkansas [293]. Human malaria is caused by 4 
Plasmodium spp: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae 
[287, 288]. The simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has also 
been reported to cause a significant portion of human cases in 
parts of Southeast Asia [293]. Table 73 summarizes the labora-
tory tests available for these agents.
The gold standard method for diagnosis of both malaria and 
babesiosis is microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick 
and thin blood films [293, 294]. Although this method requires 
a minimum amount of resources (staining materials and 
high-quality, well-maintained microscopes), skilled and expe-
rienced technologists must be available to obtain maximum 
accuracy and efficiency. Because both babesiosis and malaria 
are serious infections that can progress to fatal outcomes if not 
diagnosed and treated accurately, it is necessary for healthcare 
facilities to have ready access to rapid accurate laboratory test-
ing [293]. Samples should be obtained from fresh capillary or 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) venous blood and 
slides prepared and read immediately.
Thick blood films are essentially lysed concentrates which 
allow rapid detection of the presence of parasites consistent 
with either Plasmodium or Babesia but may not allow for dif-
ferentiation of the 2 organisms. The thick film is made using 
2–3 drops of blood that have been “laked” (lysed) by placement 
into a hypotonic staining solution. This releases the intracel-
lular parasites and allows for examination of multiple (20–30) 
layers of blood simultaneously. For this reason, it is the most

sensitive method for microscopic screening and allows detec-
tion of very low levels of parasitemia (<0.001% of red blood 
cells [RBCs] infected) [293]. Use of the “scratch method” allows 
for improved adherence of the thick film to the slide and facil-
itates rapid examination (ie, it can be examined as soon as the 
blood is visibly dry) [294]. In contrast to thick films, thin films 
are prepared like a hematology peripheral smear and are fixed 
in ethanol before staining. Fixation retains the structure of the 
RBCs and intraerythrocytic parasites and provides ideal mor-
phology for Plasmodium spp identification. It also allows for 
optimal evaluation and differentiation of Plasmodium from 
Babesia parasites, although the different Babesia spp cannot be 
distinguished from one another by morphology alone. Staining 
is best performed with Giemsa at a pH of 7.2 to highlight the 
microscopic features of the parasites. Wright-Giemsa and rapid 
Field stains are also acceptable. The CDC provides additional 
guidelines for inactivating hemorrhagic fever viruses such as 
Ebola in clinical specimens (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/
healthcare-us/laboratories/safe-specimen-management.html).
Both thick and thin films should be screened manually, since 
automated hematology analyzers may fail to detect Plasmodium 
and Babesia spp parasites [293]. The slides should first be 
screened at low power using the 10× objective for identifica-
tion of microfilariae, followed by examination under oil immer-
sion [290, 291, 293, 294]. The laboratorian should examine a 
minimum of 100 microscopic fields using the 100× objective 
on the thick and thin films before reporting a specimen as neg-
ative. Additional fields (at least 300) should be examined for 
patients without previous Plasmodium exposure since they may 
be symptomatic at lower parasite levels [294]. It is important to 
remember that Babesia and Plasmodium may at times be indis-
tinguishable on blood films and that both can be transmitted 
by transfusion, so each can occur in atypical clinical settings. 
Clinical and epidemiologic information must be considered 
and additional testing may be required.
If parasites are identified and the laboratory does not have 
expertise for species identification, then a preliminary diagno-
sis of “Plasmodium or Babesia parasites” should be made, fol-
lowed by confirmatory testing at a reference or public health 
laboratory. The CDC provides rapid telediagnostic services for 
this purpose (http://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/contact.html). While 
awaiting confirmatory testing, the primary laboratory should 
relay the message to the clinical team that the deadly parasite 
P. falciparum cannot be excluded from consideration. Repeat 
blood samples (≥3 specimens drawn 12–24 hours apart, ideally 
during febrile episodes) are indicated if the initial film is nega-
tive and malaria or babesiosis is strongly suspected.
When Plasmodium spp are identified, one can enumerate 
the number of infected RBCs and divide by the total number of 
RBCs counted to arrive at the percentage of parasitemia. This is 
best determined by using the thin film. Quantification can also 
be performed using the thick film, but this method is less precise. 
Quantification is used to guide initial treatment decisions and to 
follow a patient’s response to antimalarial treatment [293].
An alternative to Giemsa-stained blood films for morpho-
logic examination is the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method 
[293]. This test detects fluorescently stained parasites within 
RBCs and requires specialized equipment. It acquires maxi-
mum efficiency for the laboratory if multiple specimens are 
being processed at the same time, which is seldom the case in 
US laboratories. In addition, it requires preparation of a thin 
blood smear if a QBC sample is positive, since specific identi-
fication and rate of parasitemia will still need to be determined 
by the latter method [293]. For these reasons, the QBC method 
is seldom used in the United States at this time.
Although morphologic examination is the conventional 
method for diagnosis of malaria, it requires considerable time and 
expertise. Malaria RDTs provide cost-effective, rapid alternatives 
and can be used for screening when qualified technologists are 
not available [288]. These methods are rapid immunochromato-
graphic tests using dipstick, card, or cassette formats in which a 
nitrocellulose membrane with bound parasite antigens are incor-
porated. The most commonly used antigens are Plasmodium 
lactate dehydrogenase, Plasmodium aldolase, and P. falciparum 
histidine-rich protein 2. There are a number of commercially 
available options, although the BinaxNow Malaria is currently 
the only test approved by the FDA. Depending on the number of 
antigens employed, RDTs may detect to the genus level, species 
level (most commonly P. falciparum), or both. In general, RDTs 
are somewhat less sensitive than thick blood films and may be 
falsely negative in cases with very low rates of parasitemia and 
non-falciparum infection [292]. The performance characteristics 
of the commercially available assays vary widely; the WHO pro-
vides several useful publications on the performance and selec-
tion of available malaria RDTs [292]. Given the lower sensitivity, 
positive RDTs should be confirmed by examination of thick and 
thin blood films, ideally within 12–24 hours of patient presenta-
tion. Blood film examination is also necessary for positive cases 
to confirm the species present and calculate the degree of para-
sitemia [295]. In the United States, Canada, and Europe, RDTs 
are primarily used for initial screening in settings where reliable 
blood films are not be readily available (evening shift, small com-
munity laboratories) or when the clinical situation is critical and 
an immediate diagnosis is required (stat laboratory in the emer-
gency department). Such RDT testing should be followed as soon 
as possible by good-quality thick and thin blood film examina-
tion. It is important to note that RDTs may be falsely positive for 
several days after eradication of intact parasites since antigens 
may still be detected. Therefore, the assay should not be used to 
follow patients after adequate therapy has been given.
Serology plays little role in diagnosis of acute babesiosis and 
malaria, since antibodies may not appear early in infection and 
titers may be too low to determine the status of infection. The 
primary use of antibody detection is for epidemiologic studies

and as evidence of previous or relapsing infection. Serologic 
testing is also used for blood donor screening. IFA is the most 
readily available commercial assay for Babesia; IgM titers ≥1:16 
and IgG titers ≥1:1024 indicate acute infection, as does a 4-fold 
rise in titer. IgG titers of 1:64–1:512 with negative IgM and no 
titer rises in serial specimens suggest previous infection or 
exposure. There is insufficient evidence for use in diagnosis 
of B. divergens, B. duncani, or MO-1 infections. Serology for 
Plasmodium spp is available through the CDC.
Rapid NAATs have recently been developed for malaria and 
babesiosis and are available from some commercial reference 
laboratories and the CDC, although none are FDA-cleared. 
These methods offer similar or improved sensitivity to the thick 
blood film and require no specialized parasitologic expertise. 
NAATs may be useful in accurate diagnosis of acute infection 
if blood films are negative or difficult to obtain and in the dif-
ferentiation of malaria parasites from Babesia or nonparasitic 
artifacts. Finally, NAAT may provide diagnostic confirmation 
in cases empirically treated without prior laboratory diagnosis 
by detection of remnant nucleic acid. Because residual DNA 
can be detected days (or even weeks to months in asplenic per-
sons) after intact parasites have been eradicated, NAATs should 
not be used to monitor response to therapy. When a NAAT is 
positive for Plasmodium or Babesia parasites, blood films must 
still be examined to determine the percentage parasitemia.
It is important to stress that requests for malaria and babe-
siosis diagnosis should be considered “stat” and testing per-
formed as rapidly as possible. NAAT assays may be rapid but are 
usually limited to the reference laboratory setting, and the total 
turnaround time will be too long to enable rapid institution of 
antimalarial therapy. In such cases, the primary use of NAATs 
is for confirmation of infection, assistance in species identifica-
tion, and differentiation of malaria from Babesia.
B. American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas Disease) Caused by Trypanosoma 
cruzi
American trypanosomiasis may consist of acute, latent, and 
chronic phases, and the optimal diagnostic method differs with 
each stage. The standard method for diagnosis of American try-
panosomiasis during the acute phase of infection (4–8 weeks in 
length) is microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood or 
buffy coat films, since extracellular trypanosomes will be pres-
ent at this time (Table 74). As with blood films for malaria and 
Babesia, a minimum amount of resources (staining materials and 
high-quality microscopes), as well as proficient and experienced 
technologists, must be available to obtain maximum accuracy 
and efficiency. On stained preparations, the motile trypomasti-
gote forms typically adopt a “C” shape and can be differentiated 
from the similar-appearing trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma 
brucei by the presence in T. cruzi of a large posterior kinetoplast. 
In comparison, the kinetoplast of T. brucei trypomastigotes is 
much smaller. Of course, these infections can also be likely dif-
ferentiated on epidemiologic grounds. Motile organisms can also 
be observed in fresh wet preparations of anticoagulated blood or 
buffy coat, although most US laboratories are unfamiliar with 
this method. Unfortunately, infection is rarely diagnosed in the 
acute stage since only 1%–2% of infected individuals present 
with symptoms during this time period [289, 290].

Microscopy is less useful during the latent and chronic 
stages of infection when rates of parasitemia are very low. 
The diagnosis in these stages may be established serologically 
or by microscopic examination of tissue aspirates or biopsies. 
The nonmotile (amastigote) intracellular form of T. cruzi pre-
dominates during this phase of the infection. Culture in easily 
prepared Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium or similar media of 
any appropriate blood or tissue specimen during the acute and 
chronic stages will add to the sensitivity of laboratory diagnosis 
and may be available through the CDC or specialized reference 
laboratories. Live trypanosomes are highly infectious and spec-
imens must be handled with care using “standard precautions” 
for the handling of blood and body fluids.
Serology by commercially available enzyme-linked immuno-
assay (ELISA) kits is of greatest use during the latent and chronic 
stages of disease when parasites are no longer easily detected in 
peripheral blood preparations by microscopy. Positive ELISA 
results are considered evidence of active infection and would 
exclude potential blood/tissue donors who test positive from 
acting as donors, as the infection has been shown to be trans-
mitted by transfusion and transplantation.
