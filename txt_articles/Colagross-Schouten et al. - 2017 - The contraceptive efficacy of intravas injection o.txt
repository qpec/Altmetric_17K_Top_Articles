Abstract
Background: Options for male contraception are limited. The purpose of this study was to use a nonhuman primate
model to evaluate Vasalgel™, a high molecular weight polymer being developed as a contraceptive device for men.
Methods: Sixteen adult male rhesus monkeys received intravas injections of Vasalgel, consisting of 25% styrene maleic
acid in dimethyl sulfoxide. After a one-week recovery, males were returned to outdoor group housing, which included
at least 3 and up to 9 intact, breeding females with a successful reproductive history.
Results: Treated males have had no conceptions since Vasalgel injections. All males were housed with intact females
for at least one breeding season and seven have been almost continually housed with females for 2 years. Complications
were minor and included one incident of incorrect placement of Vasalgel into the vas deferens and the development of
a sperm granuloma in one animal. Three unilateral vasectomies were performed, one was necessary for incorrect
placement of Vasalgel, the other two were elective.
Conclusions: Intravas injection of Vasalgel in sexually mature adult male rhesus monkeys was effective in preventing
conception in a free-living, group environment. Complications were few and similar to those associated with
traditional vasectomy.

Résultats: Les mâles traités n’ont induit aucune grossesse après l’injection de Vasalgel™. Les mâles ont tous été hébergés
avec des femelles normales au moins pendant une saison reproductive, et sept d’entre eux ont quasiment été
continuellement hébergés avec les femelles pendant 2 ans. Les complications furent mineures; elles ont été
constituées par un incident de mise en place défectueuse du Vasalgel™ dans le canal déférent, et par le développement
d’un granulome spermatique chez un animal. Trois vasectomies unilatérales ont été réalisées, l’une rendue nécessaire
pour mise en place incorrecte du Vasalgel™, les deux autres le furent par choix.
Conclusions: L’injection intradéférentielle de Vasalgel™ chez des singes rhésus mâles adultes s’est avérée efficace
à empêcher toute conception dans un environnement de groupe vivant en liberté. Il y eut peu de complications;
elles furent semblables à celles observées pour la vasectomie traditionnelle.

Background
Options for non-permanent male contraceptives are
limited to condoms, with no long-term methods cur-
rently available. While vasectomy is very effective as a
permanent contraceptive, it is technically challenging to
reverse, with low rates of fertility following vasectomy
reversal surgery [1].
However, there have been recent advances in developing
potentially reversible contraceptive methods that target
the vas deferens. RISUG® (Reversible Inhibition of Sperm
Under Guidance) is a styrene maleic anhydride (SMA)
product for intra-vas injection that lines the vas, but does
not occlude it [2]. The presence of RISUG in the vas is
said to create a pH level that generates a positive charge
that in turn disrupts the acrosomal membrane and pre-
vents normal sperm transport through the female repro-
ductive tract [3]. That product has been studied in
nonhuman primates and found to be an effective contra-
ceptive that could be removed from primates with percus-
sive and vibratory massage, returning fertility [4, 5]. While
various formulations of RISUG have been studied in India
over several decades, no product has successfully been
brought to market as of yet.
Another intra-vas injection product, Vasalgel™ is a
high molecular weight polymer being developed in the
US as a contraceptive device for men [6]. Vasalgel is an
SMA acid polymer dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulf-
oxide), formulated to adhere to strict regulatory stan-
dards. Unlike RISUG, Vasalgel does not claim any
pharmaceutical effect and is understood to work by oc-
cluding the vasa deferentia. After injection into the vas
deferens, the SMA acid forms a hydrogel that appears
to be tissue adherent, fills the lumen and acts as a
mechanical barrier to the passage of sperm [6]. Vasalgel
has proven to produce reliable, durable azoospermia in
rabbits in which semen parameters were followed for
12 months after treatment [6]. Vasalgel was subse-
quently flushed from the vasa deferentia of these
rabbits, successfully restoring sperm flow (Personal
communication, Waller, 2016).
The purpose of the current study is to further test
Vasalgel in a nonhuman primate model in a setting that
is closer to a free-living environment, which includes ac-
cess to intact, breeding females with a successful repro-
ductive history. This study evaluates the effectiveness of
Vasalgel in adult male rhesus monkeys living in small
group housing for at least one breeding season and up
to 2 years.
Methods
Vasalgel test group
Sixteen adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)
were housed at the California National Primate Research
Center (CNPRC) in large outdoor enclosures in groups
of approximately 10 to 30 animals that included infants,
juveniles, and adults. Ten of the 16 males had previous
conceptions (Table 1). Males on this study were of
varying social ranks with approximately equal numbers
of very high ranking and low ranking animals. These
housing units, referred to as “corn cribs”, are open air,
dual-room gazebo-style housing, approx. 700 sq. ft. and
include perches, play structures, chew toys and other
enrichment devices. The adult population of each en-
closure is typically one to three sexually mature males
and two to nine sexually mature, intact females. Rhesus
males and females reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years
of age. The CNPRC is accredited by the Association for
the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC), associated with the University of
California – Davis and is one of eight National Primate
Research Centers maintained and funded by the National
Institutes of Health. At the time of study enrollment,
animals were assigned to the CNPRC outdoor breeding
colony. All experimental procedures were approved in ad-
vance by the University of California, Davis Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals were

 fed commercial monkey diet and water ad libitum plus
daily foraging mix and weekly produce. Males enrolled
were sexually mature, and ranged in age from 4 to 16 years
(mean 7.08 ± 3.0 years) and weighed from 7 to 20 kg
(mean 11.37 ± 3.20 kg). Males were intermittently housed
indoors for procedure recovery and occasional treatment
for routine health issues, but those periods were typically
brief (1 to 2 days) and none exceed 20 days per episode.
Indoor housing conditions were maintained at 37 °C with
a 12:12 h light:dark cycle and provided with ad libitum
monkey chow and water.
Age-matched vasectomy group
Only for the purpose of comparing the rate of post-
procedure complications, 16 age-matched, previously va-
sectomized males were computer-selected from over 120
vasectomized males in the CNPRC colony. These males
were randomly selected based on matching their age at
vasectomy to the ages of the Vasalgel group males (mean
7.1 ± 3.0 years). No other comparisons were made. These
males were not co-housed with the Vasalgel males.
Test article
Vasalgel consisted of 25% solution by weight of styrene
maleic acid (SMA) in DMSO. The average molecular
weight (Mw) of the SMA anhydride (Poly(Styrene-co-
Maleic Anhydride, CAS Registry Number: 25736-61-2)
was 377 kDa according to standardized gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) methodology (Scientific Polymer,
Ontario, NY). The final test article was prepared and
packaged in a nitrogen atmosphere in 2 ml glass vials by
Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA, USA).
Implantation of test article
Animals were sedated with ketamine (10 mg/kg IM,
Ketamine hydrochloride, Bioniche Pharma, Rosemont, IL)
and atropine (0.05 mg/kg IM, Baxter HealthCare Corp.
Deerfield, IL), weighed, intubated and then maintained on
isoflurane (0.5–2.0%) for the duration of the surgery. After
preparation of the surgical site, an approximate 2–3 cm
incision was made just caudal to the right and left inguinal
rings to expose the spermatic cords. The tunic was incised
(~2 cm) and the vas deferens was isolated. The exter-
nal diameter vas deferens in the rhesus monkey is

 approximately 2.0 mm [7], only slightly smaller than
human [8]. The vasa deferentia were carefully elevated
using stay suture and blunt instrumentation to stabilize the
vas during injection. Once sufficiently isolated, the vas
deferens was injected with approximately 100 μl of Vasalgel
over about 30–45 s using a 24 gauge 3/4 inch catheter
(Surflo, Terumo Medical Corporation, Somerset, NJ)
inserted in a cranial direction.. A luer-lock syringe was re-
quired to maintain connection with the catheter as signifi-
cant pressure was required to move the viscous Vasalgel
through the catheter and into the vas deferens. After Vasal-
gel placement, the catheter was removed, and the vas defe-
rens was carefully observed for about 30 s to assess for any
leakage of Vasalgel. This volume of Vasalgel filled approxi-
mately 2 cm of the length of the vas deferens. The vas
deferens was returned to the spermatic cord and the site
was closed with 3-0 Vicryl ((Ehticon Inc., Sommerville, NJ)
in a simple continuous pattern. Animals received bupre-
norphine hydrochloride (0.03 mg/kg IM, Buprenex Reckitt
Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, VA) twice a
day for 1 day and ketoprofen (5 mg/kg IM, Ketofen, Fort
Dodge, Fort Dodge, IA) once a day for 3 days for post-
operative
analgesia.
Animals
also
received
cefazolin
(25 mg/kg IM, ANCEF ® GlaxoSmithKline, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC) twice a day for 3 days. All surgical
procedures were performed by the same surgical team and
animal recovery was uneventful. Animals were monitored
post-operatively daily for 7 days and then returned to
group housing. Standard veterinary care was provided
throughout the study.
Fertility assessment
Animals in corn crib housing units are sedated at least
twice per year for routine health monitoring, preventive
veterinary care and for pregnancy assessment via palpa-
tion or ultrasound. Paternity of all offspring is deter-
mined via blood samples collected from offspring at
approximately 4 to 6 months of age and submitted for
genetic testing to the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory,
School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California,
Davis [9]. The expected pregnancy rate for sexually mature
females in “corn crib” style housing is approximately 80%
per breeding season, from unpublished data kept for col-
ony management purposes over the past 40 years.
Results
Intravas injection of the Vasalgel was successfully ac-
complished in all 16 male subjects. All males on this
study were housed with females for at least one breeding
season, which for rhesus monkeys in the Northern
Hemisphere is generally mid-September to mid-February
[10]. However, our experience at CNPRC timed mating
colony is that females can become pregnant from mid-
September to mid-May. Rhesus females have menstrual
cycles of approximately 28 days and have cycles most
of the year with the exception of a few months in sum-
mer – generally June, July and August, thus males had
extensive exposure to cycling females. The mean time
(± SEM) of co-housing with females was 1.19 ± 0.14 years
with a range of 5 months 14 days (0.45 years) to 2 years.
The shortest duration began in early September and con-
tinued until mid-April (Male # 15), thus covering a
complete breeding season. No conceptions occurred for
any of the Vasalgel males. As detailed in Table 1, seven of
the males (Male # 1 – 7) have been almost continually
housed with intact females for two breeding seasons with-
out conceptions. There were no systematic behavioral
studies performed, but routine behavioral monitoring had
observation of breeding behavior for all study males that
were monitored.
Instillation of Vasalgel
Due to the viscous nature of Vasalgel, a significant
amount of pressure was required to instill material into
the narrow vas deferens. The use of a luer-lock syringe
to prevent separation of the catheter from the syringe
was required and application of a consistent level of
pressure over 10 to 20 s proved to be the most success-
ful method. Efficiency of application improved with sur-
geon experience handling the material and effectively
manipulating the vas deferens to allow for smooth
catheter placement.
Surgical complications
Incorrect placement
(Animal 3) During instillation of Vasalgel, the injection
site of the left vas deferens appeared to have significant
leakage. It was noted that there was potential damage to
the wall of the vas deferens associated with infiltration
of Vasalgel under the sheath. Due to the uncertainty of
successful Vasalgel placement, a traditional vasectomy
was performed on the side in question. The affected area
of the left vas deferens was isolated, double ligated with
Vicryl 3–0 and transected. Closure of the surgical site
was the same as for Vasalgel sites. Vasalgel was success-
fully placed into the right vas deferens in the animal and
no complications were observed.
Sperm granuloma
(Animal 10) During a routine sedation approximately
2 months post-operatively, a small (approximate 1 cm)
opening near the right surgical site was observed. The
associated tissue was erythematous and a mild amount
of white, viscous discharge was present near the open-
ing. It was determined cytologically to be a sperm granu-
loma and a surgical repair, resulting in a traditional
vasectomy as described above, was performed on the
right side. No further complications were observed.

 Social trauma-surgical intervention
Animal 2 was admitted to the CNPRC indoor hospital
for nonspecific trauma associated with bite wounds and
lacerations to the right leg, left cheek and neck, 1 day
after returning to his home cage, which was 7 daysays
after Vasalgel placement. Examination revealed a firm
swelling palpable at the left surgical site, extending into
the scrotum. It could not be determined if the swelling
was associated with trauma from fighting with other
males, a sperm granuloma or a hydrocele. Although no
external evidence of trauma to the genital area was
found at the time of the physical examination, possible
internal trauma from male-to-male aggression could not
be definitely ruled out. Exploratory surgery was elected,
resulting in an attempt to perform a traditional vasec-
tomy as described above (using 4–0 Prolene) due to the
presence of a hydrocele. The presumed vas deferens was
submitted for histopathology. The histopathology revealed
that the spermatic cord had multiple areas of pyogranulo-
matous inflammation admixed with free spermatids, fibrin
and hemorrhage along the surface of the spermatic cord,
confirming the presence of a left spermatic granuloma
(Fig. 1). Adjacent to these areas, but not associated with
any inflammation, were small irregular foci of basophilic
to amphophilic granular to crystalline material presumed
to be Vasalgel (Fig. 2). Thus, it appeared that the inflam-
mation was associated with the presence of extraluminal
sperm, rather than from the presence of Vasalgel. After
reviewing the histopathology and medical report, it was
determined that the presence of Vasalgel was incidental to
the post-operative complications.
To determine the comparative complication rate
between Vasalgel placement and traditional vasectomy,
16 age-matched vasectomized adult rhesus monkeys
were identified. As shown in Table 2, five out of the 32
vasa (15.6%) from traditionally vasectomized animals
developed sperm granulomas.
Discussion
Vasalgel placement into the vas deferens of mature male
rhesus macaque monkeys produced reliable contracep-
tion, as evidenced by the lack of pregnancies in sexually
mature, reproductively viable females with which the
study males were co-housed. Vasalgel placement allowed
for a rapid return to group housing, providing minimal

 disruption to the social structure of the group while not
impeding natural behaviors such as mating. Further-
more, as evidenced in the histology from Animal 2, it
appears that the presence of Vasalgel does not incite a
localized inflammatory reaction. This finding is similar
to that found in the rabbit, in which tissue response to
the presence of Vasalgel was minimal [6]. Although fur-
ther histologic evidence from rhesus macaques would be
helpful, the goal of this study was to rapidly return
animals to their home environments to allow them to
continue to maintain their social status within their
group hierarchy.
Further support for the tissue compatibility of SMA
products is evidenced by reports on the use of RISUG
in similar animal models. The safety of the SMA vas-
occlusive product RISUG in nonhuman primates has
been previously reported [5, 11]. Long term studies in
langur monkeys indicated that after 540 days of vas
occlusion and 150 days of non-surgical reversal, the im-
pact on associated tissues was minimal and temporary.
For example, the vas deferens, which had initially showed
loss of epithelial cells and loosened smooth muscle layer,
evidenced a return to normal within 150 days of reversal.
The epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicles remained
unaltered and no sperm granulomas or sperm antibodies
were found in the study subjects [5]. Thus, previous re-
search on RISUG supports the efficacy and safety of SMA
intra-vas contraception.
Complications during Vasalgel placement in one ani-
mal (Animal 3) were associated with damage to the wall
of the vas deferens, likely as a result of incorrect place-
ment of the catheter, resulting in incomplete penetration
of the wall of the vas deferens. This resulted in extra-
luminal leakage of Vasalgel within the thin fibrous
sheath surrounding the vas, likely weakening the overall
structure. Once pressure was applied to fill the vas, defi-
cits within the wall were evident, requiring a traditional
vasectomy on this side. Regardless, the occurrence rate
of surgical complication was low (one out of 32 vasa
deferentia) and occurred very early in the study, during
the first day of Vasalgel instillation in one of the first
animals. Subsequent surgical dates proceeded without
incident, likely a result of surgeon experience gained
with Vasalgel instillation, improving ease of successful
placement.
In this study, we noted only one sperm granuloma
associated with the Vasalgel placement post-operatively.
A sperm granuloma is a collection of extravasated sperm
that is observed near the vasa deferentia in vasectomized
patients, generally caused by leakage from the incision
in the vas deferens or from a rupture of the epididymis.
Sperm granulomas can present as a small, pea-sized
lump under the skin or as a leakage of white, viscous
material from the skin incision site. Sperm granulomas
are common complications of vasectomy in humans, typi-
cally occurring in the 2nd to 3rd week post-operatively in
approximately 60% of cases [12]. Most sperm granulomas
are asymptomatic and self-resolve over time. From our
results in this study, Vasalgel instillation appears to
have a low rate of sperm granuloma formulation (1/32
vas deferens), and may have a lower rate than tradi-
tional vasectomy in rhesus macaques when compared
to other studies [13, 14]. Aged matched control rhesus
macaques from the CNPRC that had a traditional vas-
ectomy were found to have a higher incidence of sperm
granuloma than animals that underwent the Vasalgel
procedure (Table 2). The high rate of sperm granu-
lomas after traditional vasectomy in sexually mature
rhesus monkeys may be associated with both physical
and sexual activity after release into their enclosures, as
physical and sexual activity is typically restricted in
men after vasectomy procedures in an attempt to re-
duce the occurrence of sperm granulomas.
The only other complication observed was in Animal
2 and may have been a consequence of conspecific
trauma. Mature males are known to fight at increased
rates during the breeding season [15, 16] and, due to
their large canine teeth, can inflict severe wounds in a
single, brief altercation. Although conspecific trauma is
a risk associated with group housing, group housing
allows for development of the normal social hierarchy
and interactions that this species may experience in the
wild [17], provides opportunities for engagement with
animals of varying ages, encourages self-motivated ex-
ercise through freedom of movement within the enclos-
ure and is considered imperative to the psychological
well-being of non-human primates [18].
Conclusion
Vasalgel placement within the vas deferens seems to be an
effective method for contraception in adult male rhesus
macaques living in social group settings. Placement pre-
vented conception and was durable throughout the obser-
vation period in all animals, which covered as long as two
full breeding seasons in some animals. Additionally, the
presence of Vasalgel appears to be well tolerated and
placement resulted in minimal complications. Further
study, including the possibility of reversal by flushing the
gel from the vasa deferentia in this species, is warranted.
