Background: Survival with the epithelioid subtype of malignant mesothelioma (MM) is longer than the biphasic or sarcomatoid
subtypes. There is concern that cytology-diagnosed epithelioid MM may underdiagnose the biphasic subtype. This study examines
survival differences between patients with epithelioid MM diagnosed by cytology only and other subtypes diagnosed by histology.
Methods: Demographics, diagnosis method, MM subtype and survival were extracted from the Western Australia (WA)
Mesothelioma Registry, which records details of all MM cases occurring in WA.
Results: A total of 2024 MM cases were identified over 42 years. One thousand seven hundred forty-four (86.2%) were male,
median (IQR) age was 68.6 (60.4–77.0) years. A total of 1212 (59.9%) cases were identified as epithelioid subtype of which 499
(41.2%) were diagnosed using fluid cytology only. Those with a cytology-only diagnosis were older than the histology group
(median 70.2 vs 67.6 years, Po0.001), but median survival was similar (cytology 10.6 (5.5–19.2) vs histology 11.1 (4.8–19.8) months,
P ¼ 0.727) and Cox regression modelling adjusting for age, sex, site and time since first exposure showed no difference in survival
between the different diagnostic approaches.
Conclusions: Survival of cytologically and histologically diagnosed epithelioid MM cases does not differ. A diagnostic tap should
be considered adequate to diagnose epithelioid MM without need for further invasive testing.
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an uncommon, aggressive
cancer that affects the pleural and peritoneal tissues and is caused
by the inhalation of asbestos fibres. Latency from first exposure
varies from 15 to 50 years (Olsen et al, 2011), there is no cure and
median survival is 10–12 months (Brims and Maskell, 2013). The
incidence of MM varies internationally and reflects historical
utilisation of asbestos in the twentieth century (WHO, 2010).
Western Australia (WA) did have the highest incidence per capita
of MM in the world principally due to the mining and widespread
utilisation of crocidolite from the mining of blue asbestos at
Wittenoom during the last century (Musk et al, 1992; Reid et al,
2014).

 cytology only has been controversial. According to the Consensus
Statement of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group, ‘The
diagnosis of MM must always be based on the results obtained
from an adequate biopsy in the context of appropriate clinical,
radiologic and surgical findings’ (Husain et al, 2013). The British
Thoracic Society guidelines offer a more pragmatic approach
stating, ‘a biopsy is recommended if there is doubt about the
diagnosisy as cytology may be unreliable’ (British Thoracic
Society Standards of Care, 2007). Pooled data from different
studies demonstrate a 30% sensitivity for the cytological diagnosis
of MM (Renshaw et al, 1997b; Churg et al, 2000; Stahel et al, 2008),
which is considered to be too low to be useful as a diagnostic tool
(Husain et al, 2013). One of the reasons for this is the different
biological behaviour of the pathological subtypes of MM. Epithelioid
MM (the most common form, B60% of cases) more readily sheds
cells into the pleural or peritoneal space and these can be identified
on cytological examination. By contrast, sarcomatoid MM cells
generally do not shed into the pleural or peritoneal space, leading to a
poor cytological diagnostic yield for the sarcomatoid subtype and the
possibility of misclassification of biphasic MM as epithelioid MM
using the cytology-only approach. A cytological diagnosis of MM,
however, has practical advantages including that it is minimally
invasive, easily performed and inexpensive. It has been previously
demonstrated that in an experienced laboratory a cytological
diagnosis of MM can be accurately and reliably made (Hjerpe et al,
2015) with a definitive diagnosis of MM in 73% of all cases, with
no false-positive diagnoses of malignancy (Segal et al, 2013).
The pathological subtype of MM has a strong influence on
survival with the epithelioid type associated with a longer survival
as compared with biphasic and sarcomatoid MM (Musk et al, 2011;
Brims et al, 2016). Although chemotherapeutic approaches are
limited in MM, it is generally accepted that there are better
responses to treatment with the epithelioid subtype (Bille
´ et al,
2015). There is, therefore, a clinical advantage to identify the
mesothelioma pathological subtype, with prognostic and thera-
peutic implications. This study aimed to analyse survival between
cytology-only and histologically diagnosed epithelioid MM to
establish if a clinically meaningful difference exists between
patients diagnosed by the two techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case ascertainment. The Western Australia Mesothelioma Reg-
istry (WAMR) was established in 1962 and is linked to the Western
Australian Cancer Registry, which records all cancer types and
survival data for the state. Cancer is a notifiable disease in WA and
all incident cases of MM are investigated. The WAMR research
officer gathers information from pathology laboratories, hospitals
and clinics, and all cases are reviewed by a committee that includes
an expert pathologist, a respiratory physician, an epidemiologist
and an occupational physician to confirm the diagnosis and record
all available information on past asbestos exposure. All cases have
clinical, radiological and pathological features discussed. In cases of
ambiguity, the original sample was requested and (re)analysed in
our institution’s laboratory. Where there is remaining doubt in the
diagnosis, the case is regarded as ‘suspected’ and the data were not
included in this analysis. For each case, age, sex, site of disease,
dates and methods of diagnosis, histological subtype, date of death
and available history of asbestos exposure are sought and
documented. When additional new diagnostic material was
obtained, records were changed or updated to reflect the subtype
or means of diagnosis. Therapeutic information and staging data
are not available on the database.
Pathological diagnosis. Every pathology report was reviewed (by
KBS) to confirm the diagnosis with all available cytology, histology,
necropsy,
immunohistochemistry
and/or
electron-microscopy
(EM) reports considered for assessment. Diagnostic criteria did
not change significantly over the study period, although the
increasing use of immunohistochemical stains over the last 15
years essentially replaced the use of EM. All specimens have
routine smears and a cell block prepared following cytocentrifuga-
tion, with 5 ml of the supernatant frozen and stored. The cell block
specimen ensures that paraffin-embedded material is available for
immunohistochemical and molecular studies. The subtype of
mesothelioma was recorded as epithelioid, sarcomatoid, biphasic
or not defined. Cases diagnosed by effusion cytology are accepted
as true cases and recorded as epithelioid (Segal et al, 2013).
Data analysis. Data was extracted on all confirmed MM cases
available on the WAMR for which survival data and means of
diagnosis was determined. For this study, cases considered to be
epithelioid were subdivided by diagnostic method into ‘epithelioid
– cytology’ and ‘epithelioid – histology’ to allow comparison.
Overall, survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis (from
pathological report) to date of recorded death on the WA Cancer
Registry; the date of censoring was 31 December 2012.
Continuous variables were described by their means and
standard deviations and compared using t-tests. Proportions were
used to summarise categorical variables and compared using
w2-tests. Survival between groups was compared using the log rank
test and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate
the association between the different diagnostic approaches, other
explanatory variables and survival. Kaplan–Meier survival curves
were also produced and analysed by decade of diagnosis. All
statistical tests reported are two-tailed. Statistical calculations and
data manipulation were performed using SPSS (Version 23.0.
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).
The study was approved by the Department of Health WA
Human Research Ethics Committee.
RESULTS
A total of 2024 (1744 (86.2%) male) cases of MM were identified
over a period of 42 years, median age at diagnosis was 68.6
(interquartile range (IQR): 60.4–77.0) years, 110 were alive at end
of follow-up. Pleural MM was present in 1888 (93.3%) cases. Of
those with a known exposure source (n ¼ 1750), 1467 (83.8%) of
cases had occupational exposure, ex-Wittenoom miners and
township residents made up 25.9% of the cohort.
A total of 1212 (59.9%) cases had epithelioid subtype MM of
which 499 (41.2%) were diagnosed using effusion cytology only.
When comparing the diagnostic group for epithelioid MM, those
with a cytological diagnosis only were older, but there was no
difference in any other parameters (Table 1).
The different MM subtypes with median survival times are
presented in Table 2. Survival varied statistically significant
between all groups (Po0.0001 by log rank test: Figure 1). There
was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between
the epithelioid – histology and cytology-only subgroups (P ¼ 0.73,
by log rank test), but there was a statistically significant difference
when comparing cytology-only to biphasic or sarcomatoid subtype
survival (P ¼ 0.0001). When comparing survival stratified by
decade of diagnosis there was a trend towards increasing median
survival, Table 3 and Figure 2.
Peritoneal MM was present in 136 (6.7%) cases. The median
survival in this group was less than pleural MM (4.5 (IQR 2.3–9.0)
vs 8.8 (IQR 3.9–17.1) months, Po0.005). There were 102 cases of
epithelioid peritoneal MM. Median age at diagnosis (66.4 years,
IQR: 58.4–73.7) was similar to the overall cohort and did not vary
between diagnostic group (histology 67.7 vs cytology-only 64.0
years, P ¼ 0.58). There was no statistically significant survival

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that cases with a cytology-only diagnosis
of epithelioid MM have a similar survival outcome when compared
with those with a histological-derived diagnosis of epithelioid MM.
In addition, there is a consistent and clear separation of survival
curves of (cytologically or histologically diagnosed) epithelioid MM
from histologically diagnosed biphasic MM, which indicates that in
this population there appears to be no clinically meaningful
difference between cytologically and histologically diagnosed
epithelioid MM.
Current international guidelines cite historical concerns with
regard to using cytology as a means of diagnosing MM and it is
widely accepted that this method is not useful for the diagnosis of
sarcomatoid-containing tumours. There is accumulating evidence
that a cytological diagnosis of MM supported with supplementary
techniques such as immunohistochemistry is as reliable as
histopathological diagnosis (Rakha et al, 2010). Concern has been
raised that a cytologically derived MM diagnosis may misclassify
biphasic MM as epithelioid, because the sarcomatoid component
cells are not shed into the pleural space, leading to errant
classification. By using survival as a surrogate for different MM
histology, the current study does not support this misclassification
notion. In contrast, the results of this study demonstrate that cases
with a diagnosis of epithelioid MM using cytology only have no
significant difference in overall survival as compared with cases
with histologically diagnosed epithelioid MM and, importantly,
there is a statistically significant separation in survival outcome
when compared with biphasic or sarcomatoid MM.
After appropriate clinical history and imaging, a diagnostic
aspiration is widely accepted as the first invasive investigation for
an unexplained pleural or peritoneal effusion in most cases. This
allows a cytological analysis and a diagnosis of a malignant pleural/
peritoneal effusion in many cases. The importance of this current
study is that with appropriate cytopathological expertise and
technique, a diagnosis of epithelioid MM can be confidently made,
potentially with no requirement for further invasive biopsies using
an image-guided approach or thoracoscopic techniques. A previous
audit of practice in our institution demonstrated that on average a
cytology report was available 29 days before subsequent tissue
diagnosis for MM cases (Segal et al, 2013). Therefore, cytological
analysis has clear advantages for patients and healthcare resources.
Clinicians can reliably inform patients of the diagnosis and
prognosis with the knowledge that there is no clinically meaningful
difference
between
overall
survival
with
either
diagnostic
technique.
Effusion cytology is minimally invasive and inexpensive, which
are further important considerations in this population given the
limited life expectancy. A cytological diagnosis of MM should fulfil
one of the following criteria: indisputable malignant cells on
cytomorphological criteria, which demonstrate mesothelial phe-
notype confirmed by ancillary testing; or cytomorphological
features which are not unequivocally malignant, but with ancillary
techniques confirming malignancy and a mesothelial phenotype
(Hjerpe et al, 2015). The diagnosis of mesothelioma in effusion

 samples is made using a combination of morphological features
and immunohistochemistry. The main change that has occurred
over the past 20 years is the current availability of reliable
immunohistochemical mesothelial markers such as calretinin,
CK5/6, D240, mesothelin and WT1, as well as more specific
glandular markers, for example, TTF1 (lung), PAX8 (gynaecolo-
gical tract, kidney, thyroid). These immunohistochemical markers
have facilitated the distinction between adenocarcinoma and
mesothelioma and this has resulted in a dramatic reduction in
the use of EM to confirm tumour phenotype, whereas previously
EM was a routine part of the diagnosis, it is now almost never
performed. Additional tests to distinguish between benign and
malignant mesothelial cells, including BAP1 immunohistochem-
istry and FISH for p16 (CDKN2A), have become available more
recently; these latter tests were not in common use during the time
period of the current study (Hwang et al, 2016).
As the epithelioid subtype of MM is the most common, the
findings of the present study have important implications for the
majority of MM cases. It is important to note that some cases of
epithelioid MM cannot be diagnosed by cytology and need
tissue biopsy for diagnosis, but also that tissue biopsy itself may
not always accurately define MM subtype (Bueno et al, 2004),
therefore,
both
groups
in
this
study
may
contain
some
biphasic cases.
Cancer is a notifiable disease in WA, confirming that selection
bias is unlikely as all cancer cases from across the state are notified.
All diagnoses of MM were confirmed by an expert pathologist,
with further case review sought to differentiate into MM subtype if
required. The cohort of cytology-only diagnosed MM were older
(median age 67.6 vs 70.2 years), which likely reflects different
clinical practice for an older population, favouring a less invasive
approach. Cox regression demonstrated that age, male sex and
peritoneal MM had a statistically significant association with
survival, but there was no significant effect of different diagnostic
approach. The cases were predominantly male and occupationally
exposed to asbestos, as is characteristic of this disease worldwide.
Although nearly a quarter of cases were ex-Wittenoom workers or
residents (with heavy exposure to exclusively crocidolite), there is
no evidence to suggest that exposure to different asbestos fibre
types leads to different clinical outcomes (Franklin et al, 2016).
Therefore, the data are generalisable to other asbestos-exposed
populations around the world.
When stratified by decade of diagnosis, the median survival
increased over time with a trend towards significance (1970–1980
7.6 months, IQR 2.9–18.9 vs 2000–2012 11.8 months, IQR 6.0–
20.3; P ¼ 0.083; Figure 2). Combined systemic pemetrexed/
cisplatin is the only therapy proven to improve overall survival
in MM and this has been available in our institution since early
2006 (Vogelzang et al, 2003). Therefore, the trend towards
increasing median survival demonstrated is likely to represent a
lead-time bias with improving diagnostic expertise, approaches and
increased awareness of MM by clinicians, as previously described
(Musk et al, 2011). There are relatively few studies examining
sensitivity
of
mesothelioma

effusion
cytology.
Historically,
sensitivities
of
around
30%
are
often
quoted
(Renshaw et al, 1997a), however, experienced laboratories in areas
of high incidence can achieve sensitivities of over 70% (Segal et al,
2013), and other more recent studies document sensitivities of

 50–60% (Rakha et al, 2010; Pinelli et al, 2012). The recent addition
of new immunohistochemical stains (BAP1) and FISH studies
(CDKN2A/p16) hold great promise for increasing the sensitivity of
mesothelioma diagnosis in effusion samples in all laboratories
(Walts et al, 2016).
There are a number of potential limitations of this study that
should be considered when interpreting the data. It is possible that
there is underrepresentation of all true MM cases in the state due
to a missed diagnosis or wrong classification as a secondary pleural
cancer; however, this is unlikely to proportionally represent many
cases. As the cytology group was older at the time of diagnosis it is
possible that they were more unwell and unable to undergo more
invasive
diagnostic
techniques.
It is
also
likely
that
some
cytologically diagnosed epithelioid MM cases were in fact biphasic,
however, this is equally true for histological biopsy specimens
(Bueno et al, 2004). Because of the design of this study, there is no
ability to assess the accuracy, sensitivity or specificity of either
means of diagnostic approach; there is no record on the WAMR of
if a case had the subtype changed after expert review or
confirmation at post-mortem.
This study does not demonstrate that cytology-only diagnosed
epithelioid MM is biologically the same as histologically diagnosed
epithelioid MM. It does, however, demonstrate that there is no
difference in clinically meaningful outcomes for patients using
these two different diagnostic techniques. Although there are no
data for treatment or disease staging, these parameters are unlikely
to strongly influence the outcomes over and above cell type that is
widely acknowledged to be one of the most influential variables.
There is currently no evidence to suggest that there would be any
difference in treatment response to chemotherapy between these
groups. It is recognised that in an era of personalised medicine
with genetic or immunological testing of tumour samples, there are
occasions where a larger sample of (biopsy) material may be
desirable. Similarly, if a patient is being considered for a study
examining surgical approaches, there is also a recognised need for
multiple biopsies, from both hemithoraces and mediastinum
(Alvarez et al, 2009). When a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made
from an effusion specimen, it is almost invariably a highly cellular
sample; cases that are not shedding significant numbers of cells
into the fluid will usually require biopsy for diagnosis. In these
cellular fluid samples, cells shed from large areas of pleura are
being collected, rather than the very limited sampling of thin core
(image guided) or small biopsy samples obtained at pleuroscopy.
The number of cells available in cell blocks prepared from fluid
samples is thus generally far greater than that in biopsy material.
In this large cohort, this study demonstrates that the survival
characteristics
of
cytology-only
and
histologically
diagnosed
epithelioid MM do not differ. In an experienced laboratory, a
cytological diagnosis of epithelioid MM is clinically acceptable and
is not associated with a clinically important different outcome
when compared with histologically diagnosed cases. Therefore, a
diagnosis of MM by effusion cytology may be sufficient for clinical
management without the need for further invasive testing.
