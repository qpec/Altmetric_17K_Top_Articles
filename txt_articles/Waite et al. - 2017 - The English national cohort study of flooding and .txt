Abstract
Background: In winter 2013/14 there was widespread flooding in England. Previous studies have described an
increased prevalence of psychological morbidity six months after flooding. Disruption to essential services may
increase morbidity however there have been no studies examining whether those experiencing disruption but not
directly flooded are affected.
The National Study of Flooding and Health was established in order to investigate the longer-term impact of
flooding and related disruptions on mental health and wellbeing.
Methods: In year one we conducted a cross sectional analysis of people living in neighbourhoods affected by
flooding between 1 December 2013 and 31 March 2014. 8761 households were invited to participate. Participants
were categorised according to exposure as flooded, disrupted by flooding or unaffected.
We used validated instruments to screen for probable psychological morbidity, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ 2), Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) checklist (PCL-6).
We calculated prevalence and odds ratios for each outcome by exposure group relative to unaffected participants,
adjusting for confounders.
Results: 2126 people (23%) responded. The prevalence of psychological morbidity was elevated amongst flooded
participants ([n = 622] depression 20.1%, anxiety 28.3%, PTSD 36.2%) and disrupted participants ([n = 1099] depression
9.6%, anxiety 10.7% PTSD 15.2%).
Flooding was associated with higher odds of all outcomes (adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% CIs for depression
5.91 (3.91–10.99), anxiety 6.50 (3.77–11.24), PTSD 7.19 (4.33–11.93)).
Flooded participants who reported domestic utilities disruption had higher odds of all outcomes than other
flooded participants, (aORs, depression 6.19 (3.30–11.59), anxiety 6.64 (3.84–11.48), PTSD 7.27 (4.39–12.03) aORs
without such disruption, depression, 3.14 (1.17–8.39), anxiety 3.45 (1.45–8.22), PTSD 2.90 (1.25–6.73)). Increased
floodwater depth was significantly associated with higher odds of each outcome.
Disruption without flooding was associated with borderline higher odds of anxiety (aOR 1.61 (0.94–2.77)) and higher odds
of PTSD 2.06 (1.27–3.35)) compared with unaffected participants. Disruption to health/social care and work/education was
also associated with higher odds of psychological morbidity.
Conclusions: This study provides an insight into the impact of flooding on mental health, suggesting that the impacts of
flooding are large, prolonged and extend beyond just those whose homes are flooded.

 Background
Floods have significant health impacts. In the last decade
[1] over 1000 people were killed by floods and 5 · 6 million
more were affected in the World Health Organization
(WHO) European region.
Immediate impacts from flooding are usually due to
injuries, infections, chemical hazards, and disruption to
health services; the longer term effects are less well
understood and may arise from displacement, damage to
homes, and loss of domestic utilities [2].
Research suggests that climate and population change
will result in more frequent flooding in the United
Kingdom (UK) [3]. River flooding may affect 250,000–
400,000 additional people across Europe by the 2080s
with the UK and Central Europe among the most
severely affected [2].
The impact of flooding on physical health includes
injury and infectious disease, particularly gastrointestinal
illness [4]. In high income countries such as the UK
floods cause few immediate deaths; it is estimated that
mental health problems are responsible for 80% of all
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to
floods in the UK [5]. A recent systematic review
concluded that there is a shortage of research into the
mental health effects of fluvial flooding, as opposed to
coastal, tsunami or hurricane related [6]. Previous
studies have described an increased prevalence of
psychological morbidity in the short term [7, 8]; indi-
viduals affected by floodwater in the home were found
to be two to five times more likely to suffer psycho-
logical morbidity three to six months after flooding
compared to unaffected individuals. Disruption to
essential services increased such morbidity [7].
The time course of the mental health impact of flooding
is not well understood. Previous epidemiological studies
undertook surveys up to six months after flooding. Quali-
tative evidence suggests that the impact on mental health
may last for years after flooding [8], but this has not been
quantitatively described using longitudinal data.
In the winter of 2013/14 there was widespread river,
coastal and surface water flooding in England. Approxi-
mately 6500 addresses were flooded; flood warnings
were issued to 2.5 million properties [9]. Many people
whose homes were not flooded suffered significant dis-
ruption including interruption to infrastructure and do-
mestic utilities. Many different flooding events occurred
over at least four months, including river, coastal and
surface water flooding.
The National Study of Flooding and Health was estab-
lished in order to investigate the longer term impact of
flooding and related disruption on mental health and
wellbeing, to help direct preventive and follow up ac-
tions,
and
to
reduce
harm
from
future
flooding.
Uniquely, we will follow up participants who suffered
disruption in the absence of flooding as well as flooded
individuals, beginning 12 months after flooding with
annual follow up thereafter in order to address two re-
search gaps; providing descriptions of both the persist-
ence of symptoms of psychological morbidity beyond six
months, and the impact on those whose lives were dis-
rupted by the flooding but who did not personally have
floodwater in their homes. Our objectives in the first
year of the study were to:
1) Describe the prevalence of probable depression,
anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
at one year among individuals exposed to flooding
or disruption from flooding compared to those
unexposed
2) Identify personal and sociodemographic
characteristics associated with psychological
morbidity.
Methods
Study design
A cross sectional analysis one year after flooding was
undertaken, nested within a planned cohort study. All
participants lived in neighbourhoods affected by flooding
in the south of England between 1 December 2013 and
31 March 2014.
We obtained lists of those postcode areas affected by
flooding held by local authorities (Gloucestershire, Wilt-
shire, Surrey, Sedgemoor, South Somerset, and Tonbridge
and Malling). These were gathered for emergency response
purposes and varied in content and format. We used the
Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF), which is a
complete listing of properties in the United Kingdom, to
generate a list of the full addresses of all residential proper-
ties in each postcode area. [10] The PAF was accessed using
Addressbase, an Ordnance Survey product which allows
each unique address to be classified as residential or
commercial.
Study population
A recruitment pack including a questionnaire was sent
to each household address in the postcode areas identi-
fied. In Surrey, due to larger numbers, recruitment packs
were sent to all addresses supplied by the local authority
as well as 4110 addresses chosen at random from the list
of 7205 identified by Addressbase. Recruitment packs
were distributed by post in January 2015. All adults aged
over 18 residing at addresses to which recruitment packs
were sent were invited to participate; a cover letter ad-
vised households requiring more than one questionnaire
to either request additional questionnaires by telephone
or to complete the survey online.

 Data collection
We invited participants to return the questionnaire by
post or online. The 36-item questionnaire included a be-
spoke 19 item exposure assessment. All participants
were asked if their home had been flooded as well as
questions to ascertain if they had experienced a range of
disruptions and potential secondary stressors (such as
aspects of insurance).
We followed the definition of flooding used in previ-
ous studies for comparability [7, 11]. Participants were
allocated to one of three categories:
Unaffected participants, who reported no flooding or
disruption to their lives from flooding in their area
Disrupted participants, defined as those who reported
no floodwater in the liveable rooms of their home and
at least one of the following disruptions:
� Evacuation
� Flooding of non-liveable areas, garages, gardens or
the street
� Interruption to household utilities (electricity, gas,
oil, water, drainage, septic tank)
� Loss of communications (postal or
telecommunications)
� Interruption to health or social care access, in or
away from the home
� Difficulty accessing work, own or children’s
education
� Interruption to other amenity e.g. getting to shops
or social activities
Flooded participants, who reported floodwater in at
least one liveable room of their home
Participants who reported flooding were asked to an-
swer questions about duration, depth and consequences
including damage to the home and displacement. We
collected demographic data including sex, date of birth,
ethnicity, marital status, household composition and ten-
ure, education, employment, and the presence of any
limiting long term illness.
We used validated instruments and cut-off scores
employed in clinical practice to screen for symptoms
suggestive of probable mental health outcomes; these in-
cluded the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) for
depression, Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2)
for anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
checklist (PCL-6) for PTSD. Cut-off scores were ≥3 for
PHQ-2/GAD-2 and ≥14 for PCL-6 [12–14]. The ques-
tionnaire is attached as an appendix/online resource.
Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) deprivation score
using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was
assigned to each participant using postcode of residence.
Participants were then divided into five groups, based on
the all-England LSOA IMD rank [15].
Statistical methods
Prevalence of each mental health outcome was calcu-
lated as a percentage of the total for each exposure cat-
egory. We calculated odds ratios for each mental health
outcome in each exposed group relative to the un-
affected group, adjusting by logistic regression for those
variables considered a priori as potential confounders.
These were age group, sex, local authority (sampling de-
sign strata), ethnicity, marital status, education level, em-
ployment, and deprivation score. All these a priori
confounders were included in the model as categorical
variables, regardless of significance. Odds ratios were
considered to show a significant (p < 0.05) difference
from the unaffected group if the 95% confidence interval
did not include 1. In analyses yielding odds ratios for or-
dered sub-groups of exposure (e.g. by depth of flooding),
we carried out a Wald test for the trend over those odds
ratios, ignoring the reference (unaffected) group.
Participants who provided inadequate data to allow ex-
posure categorisation were excluded from further ana-
lysis. Participants who did not complete an outcome
instrument were excluded from analysis of that measure
only. Data were entered using Epidata (Epidata Associ-
ation, Denmark). The online questionnaire was designed
using SelectSurvey (ClassApps, USA). Analyses were
performed using Stata 12 (Statacorp, USA).
Results
We sent recruitment packs to 8761 households. Re-
sponses were received from 2126 participants from 2014
households (household response rate 23%). 251 partici-
pants (12.5%) responded online. Participant characteris-
tics by exposure group are shown in supplementary
information.
Exposure classification could be assigned for 2006 par-
ticipants. In total, 285 (14.2%) were classified as un-
affected, 622 (31.0%) as flooded and 1099 (54.8%) as
disrupted.
The prevalence of probable depression, anxiety and
PTSD was elevated amongst both flooded and disrupted
participants,
compared
with
the
unaffected
group
(Table 1). Adjusted odds of probable psychological mor-
bidity were six to seven times higher for flooded than
unaffected participants and 1.5–2.0 times higher for dis-
rupted participants (Table 2).
Association between psychological morbidity and
floodwater (Table 3)
An increased effect for increased depth of flooding
was observed for each outcome. The adjusted odds of
probable PTSD amongst flooded participants increased
from approximately 4.5 times higher for floodwater
depth <30 cm to nearly 15 times higher for depth
>100 cm (p < 0.01). A similar increase was seen for
Waite et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:129

 probable depression and anxiety. Participants reporting
floodwater in the home for more than 24 h had slightly
higher odds of adverse outcomes, in particular depres-
sion, than those flooded for a shorter period. Beyond
24 h there was no evidence for increasing odds of prob-
able psychological morbidity with increased duration of
flooding.
The small number (27) of participants who had not
regained use of all liveable rooms of their home had
markedly higher odds of all outcomes when compared
with either unaffected participants or those who had
been flooded and had regained the use of all rooms at
the time of answering the questionnaire.
Those flooded and also evacuated had six to seven
times higher odds of probable psychological morbidity
than unaffected participants and somewhat higher odds
than those flooded but not evacuated, significantly so for
PTSD (p < 0.01). Overall, those who were flooded and
who moved out for any duration had over eight times
higher odds of probable PTSD than unaffected partici-
pants and significantly higher odds than those who were
flooded but did not leave their home (p < 0.01). The nine
participants who had been displaced and did not plan to
move back had particularly high odds of all outcomes,
though given the small numbers, estimates were impre-
cise and differences with other flooded persons not
significant.
Association between probable psychological morbidity
and disruptions (Tables 4 and 5)
Flooded participants who reported disruption to do-
mestic utilities had six to seven times higher odds of
probable psychological morbidity than unaffected par-
ticipants, higher than flooded participants who did
not report such disruptions, though only significantly
so (p < 0.05) for probable PTSD. Disruption or loss of
access to health or social care was associated with
over nine times higher odds of probable PTSD than
unaffected participants
and borderline
raised odds
compared to flooded participants who did not report
such disruptions (Table 4).
There were only modestly increased odds of psycho-
logical morbidity in flooded participants who reported
disruption
to
work,
education
or
communications
compared with those who were flooded and did not
report such disruptions, and none different signifi-
cantly (P < 0.05). Amongst disrupted participants who
did not report flooding, disruption to health and social
care was associated with significantly increased odds
of psychological morbidity compared with unaffected
participants and borderline significantly increased odds
of depression and anxiety compared with those who
reported other forms of disruption (Table 5). Disrup-
tion of access to work and education was also associ-
ated with increased odds of psychological morbidity
compared with both unaffected participants and those
who reported other forms of disruption. Significantly
increased odds of all outcomes were also observed for
loss of access to shops or social activities.
Discussion
Our study has shown that both flooding and certain
forms of disruption from flooding are associated with el-
evated high risk of psychological morbidity. This is the
first study to have examined the impact on people living
in areas which experienced flooding but who did not
have floodwater in their own homes and the first to
examine associations between psychological morbidity
and particular disruptions.
Even amongst those who did not have floodwater in
their homes, loss of access to health or social care, work,
education or social activities were associated with ele-
vated odds of psychological morbidity a year after

For disrupted participants, we found that loss of access
to health and social care was associated with the greatest
increase in odds of psychological morbidity; loss of ac-
cess to employment, education and other activities were
also significant.
For this cross sectional analysis, data was collected via
self-completed questionnaires and was subject to several
potential biases. There are no national or local registers
of flooded homes; we thus needed to make extensive ef-
forts to identify a suitable population. We wrote to indi-
vidual postcode areas rather than entire administrative
districts (such as local authorities). This means that we
cannot compare the characteristics of our respondents
with the population data from, for example, the census
in order to check the representativeness of our respon-
dents. We could not know the number of unaffected,
disrupted and flooded households in each area, hence
we sought a wide range of self-reported exposure infor-
mation. We examined the impact of flooding on mental
health in several areas of the south of England. On this
occasion, affected areas included some of the most afflu-
ent parts of the country. We anticipated this scenario
and designed our analysis to allow for this; in adjusting
for age, sex, pre-existing illness, deprivation, local au-
thority, ethnicity, marital, education, and employment

 statuses we have taken into account confounding from
these factors. The very low numbers of participants from
the most deprived areas and who were from ethnic mi-
nority groups affects generalisability of our findings to
these groups.
We aimed to identify sufficient numbers of partici-
pants who had experienced disruption and flooding and
in doing so wrote to households, inviting all members to
participate. A number of limitations are inherent in this
approach; the responders were self selecting and, be-
cause we only sent one questionnaire to each household
it would have been more difficult for additional house-
hold members to participate.
It was possible that places which experienced only lim-
ited flooding or minor disruption were not known to
local authorities. Similarly, those who experience flood-
ing regularly may not have sought help from the local
authority.
It was notable that smaller numbers of unaffected re-
spondents participated than disrupted or flooded respon-
dents, potentially because they were less interested in the
topic of the study. Previous research suggests topic interest
may have resulted in people who were particularly adversely
affected by the flooding being more likely to participate
[16–18], potentially inflating our estimates of the associ-
ation between flooding and psychological morbidity. It is
also possible that unaffected people with symptoms of po-
tential psychological morbidity were less likely to respond
than people with symptoms who had experienced flooding
or disruption, which would also have exaggerated the effect
size.
An alternative interpretation is that, since avoidance is
a symptom of many forms of psychological morbidity,
sufferers may have been more likely to avoid completing
the questionnaire which constituted an unpleasant re-
minder of the floods, leading to an underestimate of
prevalence in all groups. The prevalence of psychological
morbidity amongst unaffected respondents was in keep-
ing with previous studies [7]. By way of context, it has
been estimated that the prevalence of mixed anxiety and
depressive disorder in England is approximately 8.8%
with prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder of ap-
proximately 4.4% [19]. Those people who were worst af-
fected by flooding may have been missing from our
sample, if they were still displaced from their homes at
the time our questionnaires were sent out. As this group
might be expected to have greater risk of psychological
morbidity, this may also have led to underestimations in
the effect size.
Interpretation of specific comparisons must be cau-
tious. Although the number and strength of the associa-
tions are such that most are very unlikely to be due to

 chance, there were many statistical tests of association
undertaken so that that some “significant” ones might
be chance findings. Further work is required to under-
stand and validate these findings which have been
quantified here for the first time. It is logical that
amongst
flooded
participants,
increased
depth
of
flooding would be associated with increased psycho-
logical morbidity. The observed effect for this variable
was plausible and gave us confidence that our study
provided a true representation of the impact of flood-
ing on mental health. We found a plateau effect in the
odds of psychological morbidity with increasing flood
duration which requires further exploration. Potential
explanatory factors include community support, the
actions of emergency services or other mitigating
factors after the initial flood event. Odds ratios for dis-
ruption type are not mutually adjusted (i.e. for types of
disruption) and thus we cannot be sure whether ob-
served associations with specific disruptions reflect
individuals also experiencing another form of disrup-
tion. This is particularly important when interpreting
more marginally elevated odds of morbidity.
Finally, our outcome measurement tools are used as
clinical screening tools; whilst they indicate probable
presence of disease, they are not clinically diagnostic.
Conclusions
Rates of psychological morbidity among flooded partici-
pants one year after flooding were between 20.1% and
36.2%. These rates are comparable to a previous UK
study [7] at three to six months post flooding. An ele-
vated risk was also observed amongst those whose
homes were not flooded but their lives were nevertheless
affected. Flooding is likely to exacerbate the challenge of
poor mental health in many communities. Commis-
sioners and providers of primary, community and men-
tal health services as well as emergency planners should
prepare for an increased need for services in areas af-
fected, or likely to be affected, by flooding.
Levels of depression and PTSD amongst people whose
homes were flooded were comparable to the rates of
clinically diagnosable disorder among the members of
the public involved in major incidents. For example, 30–
40% of those closest to the site of a terrorist attack have

 been found to have clinically diagnosable mental health
disorder [20]. National Institute of Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidelines, currently under revision,
for the management of PTSD following major disasters
cautiously recommend that consideration be given to
proactive screening of victims for mental health disorder,
followed by referral for appropriate evidence-based treat-
ment where required [21]. While flooding is not expli-
citly referred to in this guidance, the high rates of
disorder identified in this study suggest that proactive
approaches to identify and support people affected by
flooding could be valuable.
Amongst those whose homes were flooded, factors in-
cluding increased depth of floodwater, loss of a utility or
more than 24 h of flooding of the home were associated
with increased odds of psychological morbidity. This
may reflect severity of flooding and serve as useful
markers to help identify and support people at risk of
psychological morbidity and suggests that limiting in-
gress of water to flooded homes may prevent greater
mental health impacts on occupants in addition to the
obvious limitation of damage to the home.
Disruption to health and social care access increased
the risk of psychological morbidity for those who usually
use these services and either had floodwater in their
homes or were disrupted in other ways. This suggests
that those involved in response and recovery should
identify and support these individuals and prioritise
reinstatement of services.
Amongst those disrupted by flooding but without
floodwater in the home, disruption to work and educa-
tion was a more important predictor of psychological
morbidity than in those who were flooded, possibly be-
cause they were not already dealing with the stress of
damage to the home. Reinstating access to these activ-
ities may thus reduce mental health impacts as well as
supporting community recovery more generally. This
study provides an insight into the impact of flooding on
probable depression, anxiety and PTSD. These associa-
tions suggest that the mental health impacts of flooding
are prolonged and extend beyond just those who are
flooded. This represents a key finding for providers of
these services as well as agencies who respond to
emergencies.
