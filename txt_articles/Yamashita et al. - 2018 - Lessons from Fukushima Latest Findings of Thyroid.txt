The increase in risk for late-onset thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure is a potential health effect after a
nuclear power plant accident mainly due to the release of radioiodine in fallout. The risk is particularly elevated in
those exposed during infancy and adolescence. To estimate the possibility and extent of thyroid cancer occurrence
after exposure, it is of utmost importance to collect and analyze epidemiological information providing the basis
for evaluation of radiation risk, and to consider radiobiology and molecular genetics. In this regard, the dose–
response of cancer risk, temporal changes in the rates of thyroid cancer, its histopathological types and subtypes,
and frequency of underlying genetic abnormalities are important. At present, however, it is difficult or impossible
to distinguish radiation-induced thyroid cancer from spontaneous/sporadic thyroid cancer because molecular
radiation signatures, biomarkers of radiation exposure, or genetic factors specific to radiation-induced cancer have
not yet been identified. The large-scale ultrasound screening in Fukushima Prefecture of Japan demonstrated a
high detection rate of thyroid cancer in young individuals, revealing 116 and 71 cases in the first and second
rounds, respectively, among the same cohort of approximately 300,000 subjects. These findings raised concerns
among residents and the public that it might be due to putative exposure to radiation from the accident at
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. This review summarizes evaluations by international organizations and
reviews scientific publications by the authors and others on childhood thyroid cancer, especially those relevant to
radiation, including basic studies on molecular mechanisms of thyroid carcinogenesis. Clinical details are also
provided on surgical cases in Fukushima Prefecture, and the effect of thyroid ultrasound screening is discussed.
Correct understanding of issues relating to radiation and the thyroid are essential for interpretation of thyroid
cancer in Fukushima.

Prefecture (Fukushima city, the capital) and throughout East

evacuation areas (about 8% of the territory of Fukushima
Prefecture) by March 2012. The multiple disasters and nuclear

residents about the influence of radiation on their health. In
response to these concerns, the Fukushima Health Manage-
ment Survey was launched in July 2011 as a means of addi-
tional healthcare for residents (1–3).
Radiation epidemiology data, based on the results of the
long-term study of radiation effects on atomic bomb survivors
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, unambiguously demonstrate that
thyroid cancer risk is increased by external radiation expo-
sure in a dose- and age-dependent manner (4). A sharp increase
in the incidence of childhood thyroid cancer in Belarus was

 initially reported four to five years after the Chernobyl accident
(5). Given the dose-dependent thyroid cancer risk and the re-
sults of in vitro irradiation experiments showing that high-dose
exposure induces genetic alterations such as gene rearrange-
ments seen in thyroid cancer tissues (6–8), radiation exposure
is undoubtedly a risk factor for thyroid cancer.
It is now becoming evident that exposure doses in Fu-
kushima residents are much lower than those from the Cher-
nobyl accident, and no strong evidence in support of the causal
relation of thyroid cancer with radiation exposure in Fukush-
ima is available so far (9,10). Thus, good epidemiological
studies are still in demand. While reports by international
agencies on the Fukushima accident state that proving the
causal relation under such low exposure ranges is extremely
difficult (11,12), the analyses of genetic abnormalities and
pathological characteristics are now in progress to offer some
clues on the possible etiology of papillary thyroid carcinoma
(PTC) in Fukushima patients.
Before discussing issues related to thyroid cancer in
Fukushima and lessons learned, this review briefly provides
an overview on the most relevant findings in the areas of
radiation epidemiology, and addresses some aspects of the
Chernobyl accident and molecular characteristics of PTC in
order to demonstrate how they apply to Fukushima.
Epidemiological Studies of Radiation
Exposure and Thyroid Cancer
To clarify the relationship between a disease and possible
causes using an epidemiological study method, the validity of
the causal relationship must first be verified. Essentially, five
criteria must be met: the consistency of association (univer-
sality of association among humans, places, and time), the
strength of association (quantity–reaction association), the
specificity of association (the validity of cause and out-
come), the temporality of association (the temporal order of
cause and outcome), and the coherence of association (non-
conflicting with substantive knowledge) (13).
As for the development of thyroid cancer after radiation
exposure, the cause has been presumed reasonable, and the
risk has been quantified, considering these criteria. The re-
sults of epidemiological studies in various groups exposed to
radiation can be summarized as follows. Both external
(14,15) and internal radiation exposure, as occurred after the
Chernobyl accident (16), increase thyroid cancer risk. Al-
though the results in either case depend on the accuracy of
dose estimates and reliability of the long-term follow-up
(cancer registration and death certificates), it is possible to
conclude that cancer risk increases dose dependently, even if
uncertainties are considered. Based on the results of the
analysis in atomic bomb survivors and other groups exposed
to radiation, the risk of thyroid cancer largely increases at
exposure doses >100 mSv, which is an international con-
sensus (17,18). Recent reports, however, suggest the exis-
tence of a dose-dependent trend even below this exposure
level (14,15). Since many cases of thyroid cancer are being
diagnosed in patients without a history of radiation, the five
criteria mentioned above must be considered in order to es-
tablish the causality between thyroid cancer and radiation.
Effective doses to the thyroid in the general population
after the Fukushima accident have been estimated to be less
than several mSv for the majority of people, including infants
and children (11,12). No radiation level corresponding to
thyroid dose >50 mSv was detected among 1080 children
directly examined with a scintillation survey meter at the end
of March 2011 (the highest 95th percentile, 20.9 mSv in
Iwaki city) (19). Further discussions regarding the risk based
on these estimates are necessary. What is important in un-
derstanding and interpreting the results of thyroid ultrasound
examinations in Fukushima is the advanced ability of sci-
entific thinking and explanation, taking into account the fact
that the natural history of asymptomatic abnormalities in
infants, children, adolescents, and young adults is now being
clarified through the introduction of a large-scale screening
program. Claims based only on the numbers of detections are
irrational; it is necessary to contemplate demographic char-
acteristics of the population and its size, the type of expo-
sure, the dose and dose rate, thyroid examination method, and
its detection sensitivity, as well as other confounding factors.
Especially in case of low-dose exposures, relevance to con-
founding factors, such as hereditary predisposition, iodine
deficiency, hyperthyrotropinemia, obesity, smoking, various
hormone levels, and possible exposure to carcinogenic che-
micals, needs to be addressed (20,21). So far, the international
agencies and scientific experts support the notion that in view
of low doses to the public, the increase of radiation-related risk
for thyroid cancer is highly unlikely (11,12,22).
Thyroid Cancer After Chernobyl
Nuclear Power Plant Accident
During the first five years after Chernobyl, the only source
of data on thyroid cancer was from cancer registries, and
no systematic ultrasound screening program had been im-
plemented at that time. In Belarus, the cancer registry was
well developed even before the accident, and all childhood
thyroid surgeries were performed in the Thyroid Tumor Centre
in Minsk city, from which the first report on the increase in the
number of children with thyroid cancer was published in 1992
(5). Based on the increase in the number of cases with years
after the report, it has been suggested as circumstantial evi-
dence of the link with the Chernobyl accident (Fig. 1). Similar
reports were submitted later from Ukraine and Russia (23).
Estimation of the internal thyroid doses progressed after
that, and the increase of thyroid cancer risk due to internal
exposure to radioactive iodine was clarified; the risk was
seen in individuals <18 years of age at the time of accident.
The results of case-control studies through international co-
operation also demonstrated the increase in the risk for PTC
among those who were exposed to relatively high doses to
the thyroid (16). Currently, cohort studies are continuing in
Belarus and Ukraine in cooperation with the United States,
and both studies concordantly reported the existence of
similar dose-dependent thyroid cancer risks from radiation
(24,25). Thus, the increase of thyroid cancer risk has been
epidemiologically confirmed after the Chernobyl accident.
One point that should be noted is the degree of contribution
from enhanced medical assessment to the increase in the
number of surgeries for thyroid cancer (26). A recently
conducted study that set out to compare the incidence of
thyroid cancer in the population <18 years of age at exposure
to Chernobyl fallout, which is under medical surveillance,
with corresponding nationwide data found an increase of 6.7
averaged for the period from 1991 to 2013 (27).

 Genetic Alterations in Thyroid Cancer
Resulting from Radiation Exposure
PTC is generally the most common histological type of
thyroid cancer, and the increase in thyroid cancer post
Chernobyl has been largely limited to PTC. Constitutive
activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway has been
confirmed for the majority of tumors. The most characteristic
alterations include gene rearrangements, among which the
RET/PTC family is the most abundant, and point mutations of
the BRAF (BRAFV600E) and RAS family genes (28). These
oncogenic alterations typically occur in a mutually exclusive
manner in cancerous tissue. There is a high frequency of
BRAFV600E in PTC from adult patients without a history of
radiation exposure (28,29).
With regard to gene rearrangements, many in vitro and
in vivo experimental results on the effects of radiation have
been reported, and the molecular mechanism of repairing
DNA damage is now being elucidated. For example, it has
been proposed that the structural basis of RET/PTC1 for-
mation might be due to a propensity of recombination of the
RET and CCDC6 loci after DNA double-strand breakage in
the loop structure in the 16.1 Mb region of chromosome
10q11.21 (30).
As for the relevance to radiation exposure, although there
are results on the induction of chromosomal rearrangements
in in vitro high-dose irradiation experiments (6,8) and in
PTC tissues from atomic bomb survivors exposed to high
doses (7,31), the reproducibility is low or absent at low-dose
or low dose-rate irradiation, and do not provide insights into
signature genes, which would be characteristic of radiation-
induced thyroid cancer. In some cases of internal thyroid
exposure during infancy in Chernobyl, a higher frequency of
RET/PTC3 rearrangements has been found in early-onset
childhood thyroid cancers with a latency from 5 to 10 years
(32). Gene rearrangements are indeed frequent in early-onset
childhood thyroid cancers in Chernobyl cases, and it is im-
portant to perform an analysis comparing those with sporadic
cases matched by age and considering possible differences in
ethnicity and geographic region. Although other gene re-
arrangements said to be more frequent in radiation-related
PTC have also been reported (33), they need to be reex-
amined in sporadic childhood thyroid cancers, in which the
same rearrangements may occur at lower frequencies. In
addition, the types of gene rearrangements are diverse, and
they are also found in sporadic adult PTC, although at a
reduced frequency. The results of genetic analyses show that
fusion genes, which are frequent (33–85%) in children and
adolescents, have also been observed in adult PTCs at a rate
of about 14% (34).
Thus, further investigations are necessary to reveal the
mechanism explaining the age-dependent difference in the
rearrangement frequency: at what age and how the frequency
of rearrangement decreases in adult thyroid cancers and why
BRAFV600E, which is rare or less frequent in childhood, dras-
tically increases after adolescence. A study of operated cancer
cases in Fukushima has revealed that the profile of genetic
alterations is similar to that of adult sporadic PTC (Fig. 2)
(35,36). One possible explanation would be that thyroid can-
cers in young Fukushima patients might be a result of early
detection of PTCs, which may (or may not) become clinically
significant in adulthood, due to screening.
There are also reports on other molecular characteristics,
such as differences in gene expression between normal and
cancer tissues (37,38). So far, no reliable molecular signature
has been established. An analysis of Chernobyl cases re-
ported that CLIP2, which is located on chromosome 7q11.23,
is specifically amplified in a subset of cases compared to
unexposed PTCs, and that on immunohistochemistry, a sig-
nificant difference in the level of protein expression is ob-
served (39). Further studies, including analyses with more
advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing,
are necessary to identify molecular signatures associated with
radiation exposure.
Susceptibility to Radiation-Induced Thyroid Cancer
Hereditary factors may contribute to the risk of develop-
ing a disease at the individual level. Applicable to the risk
for radiation-related thyroid cancer, finding markers of sus-
ceptibility or resistance in order to understand why some
individuals develop malignancy after exposure to a similar
dose of radiation while the vast majority does not would be a
substantial advance. Genetic association studies in sporadic
thyroid cancer lead to the identification of four chromosomal
loci with five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) dis-
playing the following most significant association signals:
rs966423 (DIRC3), rs2439302 (NRG1), rs965513 (PTCSC2/
FOXE1), rs944289 (PTCSC3), and rs116909374 (MBIP1)
(40–42), and an additional study, using an extremely large
cohort, recently discovered six novel chromosomal regions
whose effects are less pronounced (43). The strongest asso-
ciation signal was detected for rs965513 (PTCSC2/FOXE1)
located on chromosome 9q22.33. A genome-wide associa-
tion study using Chernobyl cases showed a strong association
of SNPs in the same FOXE1 region, but no markers specific
for radiation-induced thyroid cancer have been found to
date (44).
In a study of the Japanese population, rs965513 (PTCSC2/
FOXE1) and rs944289 (PTCSC3) also showed significant as-
sociation with sporadic PTC, although variant allele frequencies

 are low (45–47). Future SNP analyses of Fukushima cases are
also awaited.
Since thyroid carcinogenesis in FOXE1 overexpression
mice has not been confirmed, regardless of exposure to ra-
diation (48), a further search of susceptibility markers is
needed with advanced technologies including the analysis of
gene–environmental interactions.
Outline of the Fukushima Health
Management Survey Project
After the compound disaster in East Japan in March 2011,
the Japanese Government and Fukushima Prefecture estab-
lished a fund for the long-term health management of Fu-
kushima
residents
and
started
the
Fukushima
Health
Management Survey (3). The project consists of a basic
survey for estimating the external exposure doses for the
initial four months and four detailed surveys, one of which is
a thyroid ultrasound examination (Fig. 3).
The basic survey was started in July 2011, and thyroid
ultrasound examinations took place in October of the same
year (49,50). While the initial external exposure was of the
greatest concern, it subsequently became clear that the doses
were <1 mSv for the majority of the two million residents in
Fukushima, and 1–5 mSv for the forced evacuees, with one
case of resident with a maximum of 25 mSv exposure (51).
Other important estimates of the internal thyroid equivalent
dose in the residents evacuated from the sites in vicinity of the
Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant are nearly all <30 mSv, al-
though the uncertainty is large (19).
In the middle of confusion and absent information on ex-
ternal and internal dose estimates, the thyroid ultrasound
examinations were started in October 2011 for all residents
aged £18 years at the time of accident in Fukushima (49). In
brief, only thyroid ultrasound is performed during the pri-
mary examination at any screening cycle. Using strict ul-
trasound examination criteria and a defined protocol, and
based on the finding A, B, or C (Table 1), the resident is then
instructed to have one of three types of examination: finding
A—the same examination at the next screening; B—con-
firmatory examination covered by health insurance; or C—an
immediate confirmatory examination. In the latter situation,
the resident undergoes an additional elaborate ultrasound
examination, a blood test for measuring the thyroid function
and autoantibodies, and a urine analysis to measure iodine
secretion. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is re-
commended if sonographic findings of nodules or cysts cor-
respond to FNAC criteria for potential malignancy (52).
According to the survey protocol, examinations are con-
ducted every two years for each resident until the 20 years of
age and every five years thereafter.
Results of Thyroid Ultrasound
Examinations in Fukushima
A preliminary screening was conducted as the first ex-
amination in the period from October 9, 2011, until March 31,
2014, and considered to be the baseline survey. This and
consecutive screening rounds were performed successively
in municipalities in the descending order of air dose. In the
two years between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016, the
second round, or the first full-scale survey, was completed,
and currently the second full-scale survey, which is the third
round, is underway (see Fig. 3). The results of thyroid ul-
trasound examinations have been summarized elsewhere
(53), and an update is provided here according to the most
recent Prefectural Oversight Committee Meeting for Fu-
kushima Health Management Survey held on June 5, 2017.
In brief, sonographic results are classified into three ma-
jor categories: A, B, or C (see Table 1). As shown in Table 2,
in the preliminary baseline screening, the percentage of
subjects receiving the primary examination was 81.7% of the
target population of 367,649 persons, and the number of those
needing confirmatory examination was 2294, combining
the B and C categories. FNAC was performed in 547/2130
subjects who had undergone a confirmatory examination, and

 116 subjects were diagnosed as having suspicious or malig-
nant lesions. Of those 116 subjects, 102 have already received
surgery, with 101 being diagnosed with thyroid cancer and
one as having a benign tumor (54).
In the first full-scale survey, which was the second-round
screening, the participation rate in the primary examination
was 71.0% of 381,256 people. Among them, 2226 subjects
required a confirmatory examination because of a category B
finding in the primary examination. FNAC revealed 71 sub-
jects with malignant or suspicious for malignancy results
after examining 1832 patients (82.3%, the confirmatory
examination rate). Of them 44 underwent surgery, and all
were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. The rate of a category
B finding in the preliminary (or the first round) and the
following full-scale (or the second round) screening cycles
was both 0.8%. The rate of a category A2 finding increased
from 47.8% in the preliminary screening to 59.0% in the
full-scale screening (54).
Some subjects identified during either the preliminary or the
following full-scale surveys with nodules judged malignant or
suspicious of malignancy have been under observation with-
out undergoing surgery. Among 187 subjects diagnosed with
nodules categorized as malignant or suspicious for malignancy
in the first two examinations, 146 underwent surgery (including
one case that was shown to be benign on postoperative pa-
thology examination), and 41 are scheduled for surgery or are
under observation without a definite plan for surgery. The latter
are those who have tumors with a diameter <10mm and are
not suspected of having lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal
tumor extension, or distant metastasis. The observation in-
cludes blood tests and ultrasound examinations at time intervals
from about six months to one year. If any of them are moving to
attend college or to be employed outside Fukushima Prefecture,
or if an increase in tumor size is observed, the subject and/or the
parents/guardians usually prefer to choose surgery.
The intermediate result of the third-round survey shows a
similar diagnostic trend. Although collecting information on
cancer takes time, it is expected that data analysis will con-
tinue to progress, including data for FNAC and operated
cases. As of March 31, 2017, 35.8% of participants of the

 target population of 336,616 persons were examined. Among
them, 691 needed confirmatory examinations. FNAC was
performed in 11 patients, and four cases were deemed to have
suspicious or malignant lesions (54).
In addition, as by-products of the large-scale thyroid ul-
trasound examinations, the growth curves of thyroid volume
by age and sex, and ultrasonographic appearance and the
frequency of ectopic intrathyroidal thymus and thyroid
hemiagenesis have been reported (55–57).
Surgical Findings in Childhood, Adolescent,
and Young Adult Thyroid Cancer in Fukushima
Out of 146 surgical cases, 126 patients underwent surgery
at Fukushima Medical University Hospital, and 125 were
postoperatively diagnosed with thyroid cancer (52,58). The
following is a detailed report on these 125 cases. The male-to-
female ratio was 1:1.8. Age at the time of diagnosis was 9–23
years old (Mage = 17.8– 3.1 years), and age at the time of the
earthquake was 5–18 years old (Mage = 14.8– 2.7 years). The
maximum tumor diameters were 5–53mm (M = 14– 8.5 mm).
The location of the tumor was unilateral in 121 (96.8%) cases
and bilateral in four (3.2%) cases. Among the unilateral cases,
68 were in the right lobe and 53 in the left lobe.
There were 44 cases of thyroid microcarcinomas without
signs of invasion or metastasis before surgery. Among these
cases, 11 patients chose surgery for the reasons described
above, despite non-surgical follow-up being recommended.
Among the remaining 33 cases, 20 displayed extension be-
yond the thyroid capsule (EX1), three had lymph node me-
tastasis, 10 were suspected of having invasion of the recurrent
laryngeal nerve, seven had a suspected of invasion of the
trachea, one case had coexisting Graves’ disease, and one had
a concomitant lung tumor. Most microcarcinomas were
identified as non-encapsulated neoplasias both before surgery
and on pathology after surgery.
The mean tumor diameter of operated thyroid cancers in
Fukushima (14 mm) and the rate of distant metastasis (2%)
are in contrast with a past report on childhood thyroid cancer
in Japan (59). According to that study, the average tumor di-
ameter and the rate of lung metastases were 40mm and 19%,
respectively (59), which indicates that before the screening in
Fukushima, childhood thyroid cancers were usually detected
at a more advanced stage.
TNM classification
In the preoperative clinical TNM (cTNM) classification,
cT1 was 80.8%, cT2 and cT3 (EX1) were 9.6% each, and no
cases of cT4 (EX2) were identified. All cT3 tumors were
cEX1 and had a tumor size >4 cm in two cases. cN1 was
22.4%. Three cases were classified as M1. all patients had
lung metastasis diagnosed on preoperative CT.
In the postoperative pathological TNM (pTNM) classifi-
cation, pT1 was 59.2%, pT2 1.6%, pT3 39.2%, and there
were no cases of pT4. Comparing with the preoperative data,

 T1b and T2 decreased, while T3 (EX1) markedly increased.
pN1 was 77.6% in contrast to the preoperative data, showing
a marked increase. N1b for the lateral lymph nodes roughly
remained the same. Since lateral lymph node dissection (D2,
D3) was performed only in the cases diagnosed with positive
findings on computed tomography (CT) and/or ultrasound
imaging and/or FNAC, the preoperative and postoperative
rates did not differ markedly. By contrast, N1a (D1) increased
from 4% to 60.8%, which seems to reflect the fact that lymph
node metastasis in the tracheal area is not easily detected on
preoperative CT or ultrasound examination. Prophylactic
dissection of lymph nodes on the affected side, including
tracheal lymph nodes, was performed in all cases.

and lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy in 114 (91.2%) cases.
The skin was incised for about 3 cm for hemithyroidectomy
and 4–5 cm for total thyroidectomy. The Lap Protector Mini�
(HAKKO Co. Ltd., Chikuma, Japan) was used to protect the
wound margin, an intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM)
device (NIM Nerve Monitoring Systems; Medtronic, Min-
neapolis, MN) was used to avoid injuring the recurrent or the
superior laryngeal nerves in a narrow field of vision. Lymph
node dissection was performed in all cases: 82.4% underwent
central compartment (D1) dissection, which was expanded to
lateral compartments in 17.6% (D2 16%, D3 1.6%).
The reasons for the high number of lobectomies performed
in Fukushima, which contrasts with the surgical reports from
Chernobyl (60,61), are the following. Patients are of a young
age, and in Japan, radioisotope therapy after total thyroid-
ectomy is not recommended for such patients. Furthermore,
there is also a problem of psychological distress and the re-
duction of compliance resulting from the lasting hormone
administration after total thyroidectomy in young patients.
Thus, lobectomy was performed, considering these reasons
as well as the consensus among thyroid experts in Japan.
Pathological diagnosis
The postoperative pathological diagnosis revealed 121
(98.6%) cases of PTC, three cases of poorly differentiated
carcinoma, and one case of thyroid cancer whose final di-
agnosis is pending. The PTCs included 110 cases of the
classical type, four cases of the follicular variant, three cases
of the diffuse sclerosing variant, and four cases of the
cribriform-morular variant. The relatively high incidence of
the latter subtype is associated with familial adenomatous
polyposis. This could be seen as one advantage of the
screening program, as detection of the previously undiag-
nosed underlying genetic condition would have enabled
earlier treatment of the gastrointestinal component of this
condition, illustrating the potential merit of screening.
Intrathyroidal spread was observed in 61.6%, and calcifi-
cations, such as psammoma bodies, were observed in 78.4%.
The rates of lymph node metastasis and extrathyroidal tumor
extension were also high, especially the rate of lymph node
metastasis, which exceeded 70%. These findings, as well as a
high rate of intrathyroidal spread and of calcifications,
however, are common for childhood PTC (59,62). The details
of histopathological analysis of cases from Fukushima are
currently under examination.
Complications
Except for the patients who underwent total thyroidec-
tomy, no cases of hypothyroidism were observed, except in a
patient who received thyroid hormone before the operation
because of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Subclinical hypothy-
roidism with a slight thyrotropin elevation was observed in a
few cases. Neither hypoparathyroidism nor postoperative
bleeding occurred. Unilateral prolonged paralysis of the re-
current laryngeal nerve was documented in one (0.8%) case.
Effect of Screening
Considering the benefits and the drawbacks of screening,
diagnostic criteria of the primary examination of children and
adolescents with a good prognosis should be such that un-
necessary confirmatory examinations are avoided as much as
possible, although health checkups should continue uninter-
rupted for a long period. The rate of category A2 findings
(nodules £5 mm and/or cysts £20 mm) was high (47.8%).
Most were cysts, which led to the arguments, both within
Japan and overseas, that the rate of those had rapidly in-
creased in Fukushima because of radiation. Later, at the re-
quest of the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, the Japan
Association of Breast and Thyroid Sonology conducted
surveys following the same procedure as in Fukushima in
Aomori, Yamanashi, and Nagasaki Prefectures, resulting in
the detection of a high rate of category A2 findings (56.5%),
which is thought to be high due to the high resolution of the
ultrasonographs used (63,64). Incidentally, the subjects ex-
amined in the three Prefectures were aged ‡3 years, which
was slightly older than those in Fukushima. In the Fukushima
first full-scale survey (second screening), however, the age of
the evaluated subjects increased for two to three years, and
the rate of category A2 findings rose to 59%, which was
similar to the survey results in the three Prefectures. This is
due to the fact that cysts are observed less frequently in in-
fants and are more prevalent in school-age children (49).
Understanding Thyroid Cancer
in Fukushima
According to the studies reported until now, it is difficult at
this point to attribute thyroid cancers in Fukushima to the
direct effects of radiation exposure. The reasons are as fol-
lows. Exposure doses in Fukushima are significantly lower
than those in Chernobyl (65). There is no apparent regional
difference in the rate of thyroid cancer cases among the
residential areas at the time of the earthquake and, hence,
exposure status of the patients (50,66). The mean age of the
subjects diagnosed with thyroid cancer was 10–15 years at
the time of accident, while there were no cases in younger
children (aged 0–5 years for the first four years), who are
more vulnerable to radiation exposure (67–69). Although it is
expected that thyroid cancer will also be detected at certain
frequencies in those who were infants at the time of accident
after some years, its causes need to be specially investigated.
The pathological findings are similar in children from non-
exposed areas. Lastly, the frequency of BRAF gene mutations
among all genetic alterations in cancer tissue is high, nearly
the same as in adult thyroid cancers, and the frequency of
gene rearrangement is substantially lower than that in Cher-
nobyl (35,36).
FINDINGS OF THYROID CANCER IN FUKUSHIMA
17
 Importantly, increased detection rates and subsequent
overtreatment linked to this are an issue (70,71). The criteria
of ultrasound examinations need to be set reasonably upon
reaching a consensus among Japanese thyroid experts and
considering all benefits and drawbacks (49,50,58). It is be-
coming apparent that the frequency of discovering adult
thyroid cancer has increased worldwide (72,73), and in-
creased detection by ultrasound imaging is attracting atten-
tion as one of the causes. In Korea, the rate of FNAC for small
tumors was 94.4%, and it was 100% if the tumor size was
>5 mm until 2009. As a result of considering increased de-
tection, the rate decreased to 53.5% in 2014 for tumors
<5 mm and to 80.2% for those >5 mm with the annual de-
crease in operations by 35% (74). The possibility of increased
detection under very special circumstances after the accident
in Fukushima cannot be ruled out. However, operative in-
dications as well as FNAC indications were considered
carefully. The FNAC rate in Fukushima is about 10% for
nodules 5–10 mm in size if the examination criteria are
strictly followed.
While new measures to solve these issues are necessary, the
latest ATA management guidelines for children and adults
with thyroid nodules also have benefits and disadvantages
(75,76). The use of individual treatment strategies according to
risk assessment based on surgical findings of PTC has been
proposed. Its foundation is the fact that PTC may comprise
high-risk, low-risk, as well as very low-risk tumors (e.g., latent
cancer or microcarcinoma in some cases). The latter reflects a
‘‘silent’’ cancer (or precancerous lesion), which does not
progress to a clinically significant tumor during the patient’s
lifetime. These findings, however, are mostly based on surgical
experience and retrospective analysis in adult patients and/or
autopsy studies, and it is difficult to project those directly onto
children, adolescents, and young adults. In this regard, further
follow-up of the Fukushima cohort may provide unique in-
sights into the incidence and natural history of small tumors in
young individuals and, with time, shed light on the problem of
whether the tumors detected and treated at a young age will
change the incidence of larger tumors in the aging cohort (69).
In any case, the individual prognosis cannot be accurately
determined at the time of FNAC at present. It is therefore
urgent to search not only for intraoperative and postoperative
prognostic factors but also for predictive prognostic factors at
the FNAC/preoperative stage. To develop better guidelines
on thyroid examination after a nuclear accident, the positive
experience of natural observational follow-up of cases with a
good prognosis should be considered. The Japanese experi-
ence with this approach in the management of adult thyroid
microcarcinomas can be provided as an example of im-
proving the quality of care (77). The experience accumulat-
ing for papillary thyroid microcarcinomas illustrates that
there is an ongoing need to reduce and prevent inappropriate
detection and subsequent overtreatment.
Conclusion
The lessons from Fukushima show the necessity of cor-
rect understanding of the issues on radiation and the thyroid.
Epidemiological studies conducted thus far demonstrate
that the dose-dependent risk of radiation-induced thyroid
cancer can be assessed and used for projections in the popu-
lation once exposure has taken place. These predictions are not
applicable, however, at the individual level or in situations
with a very low exposure dose. Radiation risk assessment,
radiation safety, and protection are very different problems,
which are not always easy to comprehend. The accident at the
Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant caused a biased risk per-
ception, which is now a pressing social problem similar to
that observed after Chernobyl (78,79). Consequently, the
association between radiation and the thyroid has reminded
people of the reiteration of Chernobyl and brought about a
simplistic way of assuming that the high incidence of thyroid
cancers has been caused by radiation exposure. This, in turn,
has further augmented excessive anxiety, worries, and wrong
interpretations of the results of elaborate large-scale ultra-
sound thyroid screening, having a psychological and mental
impact on those exposed to radiation (80). It is thus necessary
to deepen the understanding of radiation and the thyroid,
both among healthcare professionals and the public, and to
develop appropriate radiation risk communication by exam-
ining in detail the data of long-term epidemiological surveys
and by studying the relation with the exposure dose and other
factors, and to rely on the insights provided by cancer biology
and genetics. The lessons from Fukushima emphasize the
importance of education in radiation risk and proper under-
standing of thyroid cancer biology (54,81,82). These obser-
vations also provide a valuable opportunity to reconsider
the significance, benefits, and disadvantages of early diag-
nosis and treatment of thyroid cancer.
Finally, one more area of concern emanating from mis-
understanding of radiological consequences and screening
results is that it is critical to avoid irrational stigmatization of
the children of Fukushima (82), bearing in mind that anyone
may have disease or seeds of disease yet live a healthy life.
