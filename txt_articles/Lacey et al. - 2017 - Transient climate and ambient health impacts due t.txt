Residential solid fuel use contributes to degraded indoor and
ambient air quality and may affect global surface temperature.
However, the potential for national-scale cookstove intervention
programs to mitigate the latter issues is not yet well known,
owing to the spatial heterogeneity of aerosol emissions and
impacts, along with coemitted species. Here we use a combina-
tion of atmospheric modeling, remote sensing, and adjoint sen-
sitivity analysis to individually evaluate consequences of a 20-y
linear phase-out of cookstove emissions in each country with
greater than 5% of the population using solid fuel for cooking.
Emissions reductions in China, India, and Ethiopia contribute to
the largest global surface temperature change in 2050 [combined
impact of −37 mK (11 mK to −85 mK)], whereas interventions in
countries less commonly targeted for cookstove mitigation such
as Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan have the largest per cook-
stove climate benefits. Abatement in China, India, and Bangladesh
contributes to the largest reduction of premature deaths from
ambient air pollution, preventing 198,000 (102,000–204,000) of
the 260,000 (137,000–268,000) global annual avoided deaths in
2050, whereas again emissions in Ukraine and Azerbaijan have
the largest per cookstove impacts, along with Romania. Global
cookstove emissions abatement results in an average surface tem-
perature cooling of −77 mK (20 mK to −278 mK) in 2050, which
increases to −118 mK (−11 mK to −335 mK) by 2100 due to
delayed CO2 response. Health impacts owing to changes in ambi-
ent particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 µm or
less (PM2.5) amount to ∼22.5 million premature deaths prevented
between 2000 and 2100.

lobally over 3 billion people presently use solid fuel for
meal preparation (1). The extent of this activity and the
associated air quality pollutant emissions have led to numerous
cookstove intervention studies and programs, such as the Global
Alliance for Clean Cookstoves work to implement 60 million
clean cookstoves by 2017 (cleancookstoves.org/about/news/11-
20-2014-market-enabling-roadmap-phase-2-2015-2017.html). A
primary goal of these efforts is to improve indoor air qual-
ity, estimated to cause ∼4.3 million premature deaths annu-
ally, along with enhancing livelihood of woman and children
via reprieval from fuel collection and other solid fuel cooking-
related tasks (2).
The magnitude of the emissions of aerosols, aerosol precur-
sors, and greenhouse gases from solid fuel use has also moti-
vated studies of the impact of these emissions on climate and
ambient air quality. An estimated 370,000–500,000 global prema-
ture deaths in adults occur annually owing to ambient exposure
to fine particulate matter associated with residential cookstoves
(3–5), and there are as many as 1.0 million global annual pre-
mature deaths of adults and children under the age of 5 y from
combined residential and commercial energy generation (which
includes solid fuel use for cooking) (6). This is a significant frac-
tion of the ∼2.9 million premature deaths owing to degraded
ambient air quality from all sources (5). These emissions’ climate
impacts have also been quantified to some extent; for example,
Bailis et al. (7) estimate that 1.9–2.3% of the global CO2 emis-
sions are from wood fuel, enough to cause a radiative forcing
(RF) of 25–47 mW m−2 (8), whereas the aerosol RF ranges from
−20 mW·m−2 to 80 mW·m−2 (9, 10). The large range of uncer-
tainty in the aerosol climate impact of cookstoves stems from
uncertainties regarding fuel characterization given coemissions
of absorbing or reflective species, compounded by uncertainties
in the interactions of aerosols with clouds (11, 12).
Although these previous studies have highlighted the poten-
tial cobenefits of reducing cookstove emissions globally, such
findings are limited in terms of their relevance for evaluating
domestic-scale mitigation efforts. First, the impacts of aerosols
on climate and ambient air quality are highly spatially variable
owing to several factors, and thus global-scale assessments may
not well represent the consequences of national-scale action
plans. Unlike long-lived greenhouse gases, which are well mixed
in the atmosphere and have a constant impact per ton of emis-
sion globally, aerosols have atmospheric residences times on the
order of 1 wk; their spatial distributions thus contain sharp gra-
dients that lead to order of magnitude regional variances in their
health and climate impacts per ton of emission, depending on
factors such as their proximity to populated areas (e.g., ref. 13),
their impact on RF in different regions (14), and the regional cli-
mate sensitivity to forcing (15). Second, integrated assessment of
cookstove interventions must account for both greenhouse gas
(GHG) and aerosols, which is a challenge owing to the disparate
timescale of the climate impacts of aerosols (decades) compared
with that of long-lived GHGs (centuries). Finally, modeling
Significance
Widespread use of solid fuels for cooking results in a signifi-
cant source of anthropogenic emissions. Of foremost concern
for indoor air quality, reductions to these emissions could also
impact both climate and ambient air quality. These potential
cobenefits are appealing to efforts aimed at reducing cook-
stove emissions on national to urban scales, but have yet to
be comprehensively evaluated at these scales. We thus esti-
mate the per cookstove impacts on ambient air quality and
global mean surface temperature for every individual coun-
try with significant cookstove use, considering reductions to
both aerosols and long-lived greenhouse gases over the next
century. This estimation provides information for policy mak-
ers evaluating climate and ambient air quality cobenefits of
cookstove intervention programs worldwide.

 studies of aerosol health impacts are often detailed yet limited
to a single region or are global yet suffer from errors in exposure
estimation at coarse model scales (16).
To address these limitations, here we estimate the transient
(present day to 2100) climate and ambient health impacts of
national-scale coemissions of aerosols, aerosol precursors, and
GHGs resulting from a 20-y phase-out of cookstove emissions
in each country with greater than 5% of the population using
solid fuels for cooking (101 countries in total). Attribution of
these impacts to emissions from individual countries and species
is made possible through the use of adjoint sensitivity analysis,
building on our earlier work evaluating climate impacts of car-
bonaceous aerosols (11) and of source attribution of exposure
to ambient particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of
2.5 µm or less (PM2.5) resolved throughout the globe using
remote sensing observations (13).
Methods
Transient climate and health impacts are calculated for a scenario in which
emissions of aerosols, aerosol precursors, and GHGs from solid fuel cooking
are linearly eliminated over a 20-y horizon. Details of the emissions, models,
and methods summarized here are provided in Supporting Information.
Transient climate impacts are estimated as follows. Adjoint model cal-
culations (14) are used to calculate the sensitivities of regional RF in four
different latitude bands with respect to grid-scale emissions of aerosols
and aerosol precursors. Regional RF values are combined with absolute
regional temperature potentials (15, 17) to estimate surface temperature
response. This approach, introduced in Lacey and Henze (11), is expanded
here by including GHGs and transient temperature responses. GHG emis-
sions are modeled using transient functions for species-specific radiative
impacts (18, 19), which relate the timescale of emissions to the resulting
transient RF impacts (Tables S1 and S2) . These GHG RF impacts are then com-
bined with the aerosol RF to estimate the total RF as a transient function.
This net RF is multiplied by the transient global mean sensitivities and inte-
grated for all prior years to estimate the temperature response of an emis-
sions perturbation as a function of time. To account for uncertainties in RF,
ranges of radiative efficiencies of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) from
multimodel ensemble estimates (8, 20, 21) are applied (Table S3). Whereas
the climate responses to these ranges of RF estimates are calculated using
absolute regional temperature potentials (ARTPs) derived from a single cli-
mate model [Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)], other studies have
found consistency between ARTP-based projections and mean surface tem-
perature responses across models (SI Methods, Temperature Response). Fur-
ther uncertainties in climate impacts are derived from ranges of emissions
factors based on fuel characterizations (22, 23). The uncertainties in climate
impacts from GHGs are estimated as ±10% of their total impact and are
combined with the species-specific SLCP errors in quadrature.
We also estimate global premature mortality due to chronic exposure
to ambient concentrations of PM2.5. To mitigate uncertainties in expo-
sure estimates owing to model resolution (e.g., ref. 16), satellite-derived
PM2.5 concentrations (24) are used to redistribute GEOS-Chem PM2.5 con-
centrations from the 2◦ × 2.5◦ to the 0.1◦ × 0.1◦ scale following Lee et al.
(13). Population-weighted PM2.5 exposure is calculated using population
estimates at the same resolution (25), which have been rescaled to 2050
national-scale population based on 2010 United Nations World Population
Prospects (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/).
The modeled exposure estimates are combined with disease-specific rela-
tive risk (RR) parameters for disease-specific integrated exposure responses
(IER) (26) for all people over the age of 30 y and country-level baseline mor-
tality rates (27) to estimate premature deaths from exposure to ambient
PM2.5. The causes of premature mortality considered are ischemic heart dis-
ease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, cerebro-vascular disease, and
lung cancer. The adjoint model is used to calculate the sensitivities of global
premature deaths with respect to grid-scale speciated emissions perturba-
tions (13). Transient health impacts are estimated by linear interpolation of
sensitivities calculated for the present day and the year 2050 [using Rep-
resentative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 emissions] and are assumed
to increase post-2050 following the same rate of change as 2020–2050 to
approximate sustained changes in population. Uncertainties in the health
response are calculated following Lee et al. (13), in which the model was
run with perturbed IER responses and baseline mortality rates correspond-
ing to ±1 SD for each impact. These are combined with a comparison of
results obtained using different satellite-derived PM2.5 surfaces (24, 28) to
estimate the range of annual premature deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5
exposure from solid fuel cookstove use; our central estimate uses the Global
Burden of Disease 2013 exposure dataset (24) for consistency with other
health impacts studies.
Results
Climate. Transient global climate impacts for removal of cook-
stove emissions, from each emitted species, are shown in Fig. 1.
For aerosols, we present impacts of emissions of sulfur dioxide
(SO2), primary black carbon (BC), and primary organic carbon
(OC), as well as additional secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
formed from volatile organic carbon emissions. Fig. 1A shows
these contributions to the net transient temperature response.
SLCP impacts dominate the response for the first half of the
century, whereas the GHG impacts, particularly CO2, become
increasingly important by 2100, consistent with previous studies
of other types of mitigation (29–31). Cooling caused by removal
of the absorptive species (BC, CO2, and CH4) outweighs the
warming from removal of reflective aerosols (OC and sulfate, the
latter from coal), with BC contributing the most to the surface
temperature impact.
The use of adjoint sensitivities allows us to identify the
contribution of each country’s emissions to global climate

change. Fig. 1B shows countries with the largest contributions
of national-scale emissions to the global average surface tem-
perature response in 2050, with the breakdown of each species’
contribution to that impact, along with Brazil and Mexico for
comparison. Note that countries with large GHG contributions
will have relatively larger overall impacts in later decades than
are shown in Fig. 1B, as GHG effects increase, consistent with
global-scale trends shown in Fig. 1A; the tabulated transient
national-scale contributions for all countries with larger than
5% solid fuel use can be found in Dataset S1. Considering
only carbonaceous aerosols, Lacey and Henze (11) highlighted
the value of mitigating BC emissions in high-latitude countries,
which incur the largest-magnitude cooling response per kilo-
gram of abated BC emission, whereas the removal of coemit-
ted OC in many countries (e.g., Central and South America
and parts of Africa) leads to a net warming. Accounting for
coemitted GHGs, here we find that in regions wherein residen-
tial solid fuel emissions have a large OC component, the climate
impact from CO2 and CH4 counteracts the cooling impact of
these reflective aerosols. This occurs in African countries that
use large amounts of nonrenewable solid fuels (7), as shown by
the larger percentage of contribution of CO2 to the net temper-
ature impact in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya. Fig. 1B
also shows the uncertainties in the net global surface tempera-
ture response. For several countries (e.g., Ethiopia, Bangladesh,
Kenya), the range of temperature impacts spans zero, mean-
ing that removal of these countries’ emissions may have a net
warming.
Health. Fig. 2A shows each species’ contribution to cumulative
and annual global premature deaths avoided due to changes in
ambient PM2.5 from the removal of cookstove emissions. The
large increase in annual avoided deaths from 2000 to 2020 is due
to the phased emissions reduction. The change in annual avoided
premature death from 2020 to 2100 is due to increases in popu-
lation and changes in the formation of sulfate aerosol caused by
shifts in anthropogenic emissions.
The health impacts in Fig. 2B show that OC is the largest con-
tributor to ambient PM2.5 exposure from cookstove emissions
throughout all countries. This plot also highlights the importance
of SO2 emissions in countries that use a combination of tradi-
tional wood and herbaceous fuels along with coal. The countries
with the largest contribution to global premature deaths from
exposure to ambient PM2.5 from cookstoves are not necessar-
ily the countries with the highest solid fuel use or number of
cookstoves (i.e., Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Kenya). Large ambient
health impacts from emissions in countries such as Nepal, Pak-
istan, and Vietnam are due to transport of PM2.5 over populated
regions. In contrast, emissions in countries such as Ukraine and
Romania contribute to a large percentage of the global health
impact owing to high baseline mortality rates (13).
Cobenefits. To directly compare climate and ambient air quality
impacts, we have calculated each country’s percentage of con-
tribution to global climate and health impacts and plotted these
in Fig. 3 on the x and y axes, respectively. Other studies have
compared health and air quality impacts by monetizing both cli-
mate and health (e.g., ref. 32). To avoid confounding the esti-
mated transient global impacts with the changing social costs of
emissions and statistical values of life, we present both as sepa-
rate objectives and recognize that country-specific impacts could
be monetized in future studies. To illustrate, the impacts plotted
here are calculated for 2050, but values for each decade between
2000 and 2050 for 101 countries are provided in Dataset S2.
Countries are color coded by continent to highlight differences

as a response to the phased removal of cookstove emissions. In
general, African countries tend to contribute to a larger temper-
ature response due to large amounts of cookstove use and the
cooling potential from the removal of the associated GHG emis-
sions. In contrast, the ambient health impacts of emissions from
African countries are smaller than in other regions due to the
lower population densities. Countries in Southeast Asia tend to
contribute to more balanced climate and ambient health impacts
in part due to higher population densities and transport of pri-
mary aerosol emissions over populated areas, as well as signif-
icant solid fuel use and high aerosol radiative efficiencies. The
large ambient health impacts from Eastern European emissions
reductions are a function of higher baseline mortality rates (13).
Also note that impacts of emissions from China and India lie out-
side the plot axes.
Whereas the overall magnitude of the impacts is important
in understanding the drivers of global climate and ambient air
quality, of more value with regard to policy, specifically cook-
stove interventions, are the impacts on a per cookstove basis.
We thus next consider (Fig. 4) the national-scale contributions
to global climate and air quality impacts divided by the national-
scale number of cookstoves, which is estimated using the num-
ber of people using solid fuels in 2010 (1) and the household
size from the Global Burden of Disease Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation. Per cookstove (i.e., marginal) impacts
are largest for cookstoves in certain regions not typically tar-
geted for cookstove interventions (30), such as those in Central
Asia and Eastern Europe, with emissions from Azerbaijan rank-
ing the highest in terms of climate and second highest in terms
of health.
Discussion and Conclusions
The results presented here show that for the year 2050, the
impacts from the phased removal of global solid fuel cookstove
emissions are a global average surface temperature cooling of
77 mK (ranging from a 20-mK warming to a 278-mK cooling)
and an avoidance of 260,000 (137,00–268,000) annual prema-
ture deaths due to ambient PM2.5 exposure, cumulatively avoid-
ing 10.5 (5.55–10.80) million premature deaths from 2000 to
2050. Aerosols contribute 41% to the central estimate of net
global cookstove climate impacts by 2050 and alone may be cool-
ing or warming with large uncertainties based on fuel type and
aerosol’s climate impacts. However, net climate impacts of cook-
stove emissions reductions are likely cooling, when considering
benefits of curbed GHG emissions, which become increasingly
prominent on longer time horizons. National-scale contributions
of cookstove emissions to global premature deaths due to ambi-
ent PM2.5 exposure are driven by primary organic carbonaceous
aerosol.
Emissions from cookstoves in China and India are the largest,
and they contribute the most to ambient air quality and climate
impacts; however, the role of other countries does not in general
always correspond to the magnitude of their emissions. Fig. 5
depicts how ambient air quality and climate benefits of cookstove
interventions are modulated by the role of transport of aerosols
over populated regions, the combined impacts of absorbing and
reflective components of aerosols, the ratio of GHG to aerosol
emissions as a function of fuel type, and the magnitude of semi-
and indirect climate effects of opposite sign. Several countries
(Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine) rank in the
top 20 in terms of their coimpacts without being ranked highly
in terms of total population using solid fuels. Despite a smaller
amount of cookstove use, intervention programs in these coun-
tries are estimated to result in the highest cobenefit per cook-
stove replaced owing to increased climate impacts of BC due to
transport to the Arctic and over snow and the increased number
of premature deaths due to high baseline mortality rate in these
regions.
Although this study uses state-of-the-art modeling techniques
to estimate climate and health impacts, several assumptions must
be made to allow for efficient model calculations. We consider a
range of emissions factors for BC to OC, but our estimates do not
explicitly consider uncertainties in total carbonaceous emissions
(although marginal impacts, to first order, are less sensitive to
this type of uncertainty). We attempt to account for this when
estimating health impacts by considering a range of satellite-
derived PM2.5 datasets (24, 28), but additional assessment of
cookstove emissions inventories and resulting PM2.5 concentra-
tions would be valuable (33). Our work only crudely treats SOA
formation and is sensitive to uncertainties in emission factors of
nonmethane organic compounds (34, 35). New understandings

in the roles of SO2 and NOx emissions on SOA formation (e.g.,
ref. 36) may indicate our SOA estimates are lower bounds. Our
methods also use global estimates of aerosol semi- and indirect
climate impacts (37) and assume a central BC radiative forcing
from Bond et al. (38) that has been suggested to be 27% too
large (39). Our adjoint sensitivities were calculated using a single
year of meteorology (2009) that may not reflect a climatologi-
cal mean, although error bounds of our radiative forcing esti-
mates do draw from comparisons of multiyear modeling stud-
ies. Future work may be able to extend the source attribution
techniques used in our study for direct RF to indirect effects
and account for future changes in meteorology. For the health
impacts, our assumption that present-day mortality rates persist
throughout the scenarios may lead to overestimates, as recent
work predicts that baseline mortality rates in the top countries
impacted by changes in solid fuel use may decrease by 30% in
2050 (40). Finally, we have focused on the impact of cookstove
emissions under an illustrative yet simplistic phase-out scenario.
If instead cookstoves were replaced with tier 1 or tier 2 solid-
fuel cookstoves, we would expect a 28% and 56% reduction,
respectively, in health and climate impacts from this replace-
ment, given the emissions factors for these stoves (41). Tier 3
and tier 4 stoves require access to different fuel sources and a
more comprehensive integrated assessment of life-cycle impacts.
Nonetheless, despite the stated uncertainties and assumptions,
this work provides information to decision makers to evalu-
ate climate and ambient health impacts of current and ongoing
cookstove interventions (cleancookstoves.org/about/news/11-20-
2014-market-enabling-roadmap-phase-2-2015-2017.html).
