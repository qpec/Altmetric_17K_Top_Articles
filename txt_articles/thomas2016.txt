Background
A systematic review found that 3% of working adults who had received influenza vaccine and 5% of those who were unvaccinated
had laboratory-proven influenza per season; in healthcare workers (HCWs) these percentages were 5% and 8% respectively. Healthcare
workers may transmit influenza to patients.
Objectives
To identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the effects of vaccinating healthcare workers on the incidence
of laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, death from pneumonia and admission to hospital for respiratory illness in those aged 60
years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs).
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to October 2015) and Web
of Science (2006 to October 2015), but Biological Abstracts only from 1969 to March 2013 and Science Citation Index-Expanded
from 1974 to March 2013 due to lack of institutional access in 2015.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of influenza vaccination of healthcare workers caring for individuals aged 60
years or older in LTCIs and the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or
hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract infection) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Effects on dichotomous outcomes were measured as risk differences
(RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.

 Main results
We identified four cluster-RCTs and one cohort study (n = 12,742) of influenza vaccination for HCWs caring for individuals ≥ 60
years in LTCIs. Four cluster RCTs (5896 residents) provided outcome data that addressed the objectives of our review. The studies were
comparable in their study populations, intervention and outcome measures. The studies did not report adverse events. The principal
sources of bias in the studies related to attrition, lack of blinding, contamination in the control groups and low rates of vaccination
coverage in the intervention arms, leading us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes due to serious risk of bias.
Offering influenza vaccination to HCWs based in long term care homes may have little or no effect on the number of residents who
develop laboratory-proven influenza compared with those living in care homes where no vaccination is offered (RD 0 (95% CI -0.03
to 0.03), two studies with samples taken from 752 participants; low quality evidence). HCW vaccination probably leads to a reduction
in lower respiratory tract infection in residents from 6% to 4% (RD -0.02 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.01), one study of 3400 people; moderate
quality evidence). HCW vaccination programmes may have little or no effect on the number of residents admitted to hospital for
respiratory illness (RD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, one study of 1059 people; low quality evidence). We decided not to combine data
on deaths from lower respiratory tract infection (two studies of 4459 people) or all cause deaths (four studies of 8468 people). The
direction and size of difference in risk varied between the studies. We are uncertain as to the effect of vaccination on these outcomes
due to the very low quality of evidence. Adjusted analyses, which took into account the cluster design, did not differ substantively from
the pooled analysis with unadjusted data.
Authors’ conclusions
Our review findings have not identified conclusive evidence of benefit of HCW vaccination programmes on specific outcomes of
laboratory-proven influenza, its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract
illness), or all cause mortality in people over the age of 60 who live in care institutions. This review did not find information on co-
interventions with healthcare worker vaccination: hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine,
avoiding admissions, antivirals and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) not to work. This review
does not provide reasonable evidence to support the vaccination of healthcare workers to prevent influenza in those aged 60 years or
older resident in LTCIs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review
and to test further these interventions in combination.

Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for people aged 60 or older living in long-term care institutions
Review question
We wanted to know if vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza reduces the risk of older individuals in long-term care institutions
(LTCIs) acquiring influenza infections from healthcare workers.
Background
The signs and symptoms of influenza are similar to those of many other respiratory illnesses, therefore it is important in studies testing
the effects of influenza vaccination to prove by laboratory tests, which are highly accurate, whether residents in LTCIs actually have
influenza or another respiratory illness.
Study characteristics
Our evidence is current to October 2015. Overall five studies were included in our review but we used data from three trials with 5896
residents . In one trial the average age was 77 and 71% were female, in another this was 82 years and 70% were female, and in the last
this was 86 years and 77% were female. One study was supported by the Greater Glasgow Health Board Care of the Elderly Unit, one
by the Wellcome Trust and for one there was no statement.
Key results and quality of the evidence
The method of randomisation used was at low risk in two trials and unclear in one. In all three studies allocation concealment and
blinding were unclear. In two studies data could not be included from everyone who was recruited and this put their results at a high
risk of bias. All three studies reported outcomes completely. However, in all three trials there was performance bias due to incomplete
influenza vaccination of healthcare workers in the intervention arms. No studies reported on adverse events.

 Offering influenza vaccination to healthcare workers who care for those aged 60 or over in LTCIs may have little or no effect on
laboratory-proven influenza (low quality evidence). HCW vaccination programmes probably have a small effect on lower respiratory
tract infection (moderate quality evidence), but they may have little or no effect on admission to hospital (low quality evidence). It is
unclear what effect vaccination programmes have on death due to lower respiratory tract illness (very low quality evidence) or all cause
deaths (very low quality evidence).
This review did not find information on other interventions used in conjunction with vaccination of healthcare workers (for example,
hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding new admissions, prompt antiviral use,
asking healthcare workers with an influenza-like illness not to work). High quality randomised controlled trials testing combinations
of these interventions are needed.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different
Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
1Downgraded one level due to serious risk of bias: high risk of performance/ detection bias.
2Downgraded one level due to serious imprecision: confidence interval includes clinically important differences with either
intervention.
3Downgraded two levels due to very serious inconsistency: meta-analysis was not undertaken for this outcome in view of the
high levels of statistical heterogeneity for this outcome and variation in the direction of the effect across the studies,.
4 Downgraded one level due to serious risk of bias: high risk of attrition bias.

Description of the condition
Healthcare workers, such as doctors, nurses, other health profes-
sionals, cleaners and porters (and also family visitors), may have
substantial rates of clinical and sub-clinical influenza during in-
fluenza seasons (Elder 1996; Jefferson 2009; Ruel 2002). Labo-
ratory-proven influenza in the general population on average ac-
counts for a small proportion of ’influenza-like illnesses’. A sys-
tematic review of 29 observational studies with 58,245 partici-
pants during 97 influenza seasons found that 3% (95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 1.79% to 5.15%) of vaccinated working adults
had a symptomatic influenza infection (tested by serology) per in-
fluenza season. Among vaccinated healthcare workers 4.8% (95%
CI 3.23% to 7.16%) had an influenza infection per influenza sea-
son. Of unvaccinated working adults 5.12% (95% CI 3.08% to
8.52%) had an influenza infection per season; in unvaccinated
HCWsthiswas7.54%(95%CI4.86%to11.70%)(Kuster 2011).
Healthcare workers often continue to work when infected with
influenza, increasing the likelihood of transmitting influenza to
those in their care (Coles 1992; Weingarten 1989; Yassi 1993).
However, areviewof infectiontransmissioninhospitalswasunable
to provide numerical data for influenza transmission by HCWs
(Sydnor 2014). Those aged 60 or older in institutions such as long-
stay hospital wards and nursing homes are at risk of influenza and
its complications, especially if affected with multiple pathologies
(Fune 1999; Jackson 1992; Muder 1998; Nicolle 1984).
Description of the intervention
One way to prevent the spread of influenza to those aged 60 years
or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs) may be
to vaccinate healthcare workers. The Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP)
recommends vaccination of all healthcare workers (Harper 2004).
However, only 36% of healthcare workers in the US were vacci-
nated in 2003 (CDC 2003), 35% of staff in LTCIs in Canada
were vaccinated in 1999 (Stevenson 2001), and 34% to 44% af-
ter a RCT in 43 geriatric healthcare settings in France to increase
vaccination rates (Rothan-Tondeur 2010). Nurses and (in some
institutions) physicians, tend to have lower influenza vaccination
rates than other healthcare workers. This relatively low uptake may
partly be a reflection of doubts as to the vaccine’s ability to pre-
vent influenza (Ballada 1994; Campos 2002-3; Ludwig-Beymer
2002; Martinello 2003; Quereshi 2004). The design and execu-
tion of campaigns to increase vaccination rates are also important
(Doebbeling 1997; NFID 2004; Russell 2003a; Russell 2003b),
in order to provide an intervention at minimal risk of bias from
inadequate randomisation, concealment of allocation, blinding,
attrition, incomplete reporting and inappropriate statistical anal-
ysis.
How the intervention might work
Healthcare workers are the key group who enter nursing and LT-
CIs on a daily basis. The immune systems of the elderly are less re-
sponsive to vaccination and vaccinating healthcare workers could
reduce the exposure of those aged 60 years or older to influenza.
Why it is important to do this review
Previous systematic reviews of the effects of influenza vaccines in
those aged 60 years or older are now out of date or do not include
all relevant studies. The Gross 1995 review is 17 years old and its
conclusions are affected by the exclusion of recent evidence. The
Vu 2002 review has methodological weaknesses (excluding stud-
ies with denominators smaller than 30 and quantitative pooling
of studies with different designs), which are likely to undermine
the conclusions. A systematic review by Jordan 2004 of the effects
of vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza on high-risk
individual elderly reports significantly lower mortality in the el-
derly (13.6% versus 22.4%, odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% CI 0.4
to 0.84) but does not include the latest studies. The Burls 2006
systematic review of the effects on elderly people only identified
the RCTs by Potter 1997 and Carman 2000. Anikeeva 2009 does
not include the study by Lemaitre 2009. It is important to pro-
vide accurate information for policy makers and to highlight the
need for high quality trials to test combinations of interventions,
including healthcare worker vaccination.
There are Cochrane systematic reviews assessing the effects of in-
fluenza vaccines in children (Jefferson 2012), the elderly (Jefferson
2010), healthy adults (Demicheli 2014), people affected with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Poole 2010), and cystic
fibrosis (Dharmaraj 2009).

 Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
RCTs and non-RCTs (cohort or case-control studies) reporting
exposure and outcomes by vaccine status.
Types of participants
Healthcare workers (nurses, doctors, nursing and medical stu-
dents, other health professionals, cleaners, porters and volunteers
who have regular contact with those aged 60 years or older) of all
ages, caring for those aged 60 years or older in institutions such as
nursing homes, LTCIs or hospital wards.
Types of interventions
Vaccination of healthcare workers with any influenza vaccine given
alone or with other vaccines, in any dose, preparation or time
schedule, compared with placebo or with no intervention. Stud-
ies on vaccinated elderly are included in reviews looking at the
effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly (Jefferson 2010). The
Demicheli 2014 review looked at the effects of vaccination in
healthy adults such as healthcare workers.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
We used the following outcomes as the basis for our ’Summary of
Findings’ table:
1. Cases of influenza in those aged 60 years or older confirmed
by viral isolation or serological supporting evidence (or both),
plus a list of likely respiratory symptoms.
2. Lower respiratory tract infection.
3. Admission to hospital for respiratory illness.
4. Deaths caused by respiratory illness.
5. Deaths from any cause
We excluded studies reporting only serological outcomes in the
absence of symptoms.We didnotconsideroutcomesforhealthcare
workers.
After the last publication of this review (Thomas 2013), two
reviews were undertaken to assess the appropriateness of ILI
(Thomas 2014a; Appendix 1) as outcome measures and we de-
cided not to use these outcome measures as they are misleading.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
For this 2015 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), which contains the
Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s Specialised Reg-
ister, MEDLINE (March 2013 to October week 3 2015), Em-
base.com (March 2013 to October 2015) and Web of Science
(March 2013 to October 2015). See Appendix 2 for details of
previous searches. There were no language restrictions.
We searched MEDLINE and CENTRAL using the follow-
ing search strategy. We combined the MEDLINE search with
the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying
randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximising version
(2008 revision); Ovid format (Lefebvre 2011). We adapted the
search strategy to search EMBASE (Appendix 3) and Web of Sci-
ence (Appendix 4).
We also combined the following search strategy with the SIGN
filter (SIGN 2009) for identifying observational studies and ran
the searches in MEDLINE and adapted them for EMBASE and
Web of Science (see Appendix 5).

Institutes of Health trials registry (latest search 28 January 2016).
We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects
(DARE) 2013 (part of The Cochrane Library) and reviewed the
references for further possible studies. We searched bibliographies
of retrieved articles and contacted trial authors for further details,
if required.

 Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (TJL, RET) independently reviewed the ab-
stracts by using the following inclusion criteria.
1. People 60 years or older.
2. LTCIs or hospitals.
3. Healthcare workers.
4. Influenza vaccination.
5. Death from any cause.
Disagreements were resolved by a third review author (TOJ).
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (RET, TJL) applied the inclusion criteria to all
identified and retrieved articles and extracted data from included
studies into standard Cochrane Vaccines Field forms. We extracted
the following data in duplicate.
• Methods: purpose; design; period study conducted and
statistics.
• Participants: country or countries of study; setting; eligible
participants; age and gender.
• Interventions and exposure: in intervention group and
control group.
• Outcomes in those aged 60 years or older residing in LTCIs.
Two review authors (RET, TJL) independently checked data ex-
traction and disagreements were resolved by third review author
(TOJ).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We carried out assessment of methodological quality for RCTs us-
ing the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2011). We assessed
the quality of non-RCTs in relation to the presence of poten-
tial confounders using the appropriate Newcastle-Ottawa Scales
(NOS) (Wells 2005). The NOS asks whether all possible precau-
tions against confounding have been taken by the study designers
and links study quality to the answer. We translated the number of
inadequately reported or conducted items into categories of risk
of bias. We used quality at the analysis stage as a means of inter-
preting the results. The review authors resolved disagreements on
inclusion or methodological quality of studies by discussion. Two
review authors (RET, TOJ) checked quality assessment.
We looked for details of formal ethics approval and informed con-
sent of participants.
Measures of treatment effect
We assessed efficacy against laboratory-proven influenza, pneu-
monia, deaths from pneumonia and hospitalisation using risk dif-
ferences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We chose to
analyse the data as risk differences. The number needed to vacci-
nate (NNV) was computed as 1/RD.
Unit of analysis issues
All three RCTs that provided outcome data that met our criteria
had a cluster design. We adjusted the study estimates for cluster-
RCTs by dividing the events and sample sizes in each treatment
group with the study design effect. to derive the ’effective sample
size’. This was based on formulae described in full in Chapter 16
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011). This generates a design effect based on the in-
tracluster correlation coefficient and average cluster size. The de-
sign effect used to for each study is given in the Characteristics of
included studies tables.
In previous versions of this review we used generic inverse variance
outcome types to analyse trial effect estimates for rates of events
or risk of odds ratios as available from the included studies. We
adopted an alternative approach for convenience since the pre-
ferred measure of effect was the risk difference.
Dealing with missing data
We did not use any strategies to impute missing outcome data and
recorded missing data in the ’Risk of bias’ table.
We contacted trial authors to ascertain the intra-cluster correla-
tion coefficient (ICC) and to confirm statistical analyses before
proceeding to adjust events and totals to use in the analysis of
data. In the absence of an ICC for two studies (Carman 2000;
Potter 1997), we assumed an ICC of 0.023 based on a larger study
(Hayward 2006).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We used the Chi2 test and I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity across
the pooled studies. For outcomes where there was evidence of
statistical variation above 50%, we based decisions on whether to
combine data on the magnitude and direction of the effects across
the studies
Assessment of reporting biases
We identified only three cluster-RCTs that met our criteria for
outcome data and so we could not create a funnel plot to assess
publication bias due to the small number of included studies.
Data synthesis
We meta-analysed with a random-effects model as it could not
be assumed that the studies came from similar populations. We
used Review Manager 5.3 to create ’Summary of findings’ tables
(RevMan 2014).

 GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ table
One author assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE meth-
ods. We created a ’Summary of findings’ table using the follow-
ing outcomes: cases of influenza, lower respiratory tract infection,
admission to hospital for respiratory illness, deaths caused by in-
fluenza or its complications and deaths from any cause. We used
the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of
effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the
quality of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies that
contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes
(Atkins 2004). We used methods and recommendations described
in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) and used GRADE-
pro GDT software (GRADEpro GDT 2015) to rate the quality
of evidence. Downgrading decisions for the randomised trial evi-
dence resulted in one of four quality ratings (high, moderate, low
or very low) depending on the number of levels the evidence was
downgraded. We justified all decisions to downgrade or upgrade
the quality of studies using footnotes in Summary of findings for
the main comparison, and we made comments to aid the reader’s
understanding of the review where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Whenever data presented in the study allowed it, we carried out
subgroup analysis according to the vaccination status of residents
aged 60 years or older. We assessed the following outcomes that
arose during the influenza season.
1. Laboratory-proven influenza infections (by paired serology,
nasal swabs, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) or tissue culture).
2. Lower respiratory tract infection.
3. Hospitalisation for respiratory illness.
4. Death from respiratory tract illness.
5. Death from any cause.
Sensitivity analysis
With only three cluster-RCTs that met our criteria for outcome
data, a sensitivity analysis was not feasible.

Description of studies
Results of the search
A search on 27 October 2015 identified 153 RCTs and 236 obser-
vational studies. A search in clinical trials registries on 27 January
2016 identified 11 citations but no new studies were included in
this update. Neither the 2013 nor the 2009 searches identified
new RCTs for inclusion.
The 2015, 2013 and 2009 searches (with duplicate results) in to-
tal identified 2825 papers (766 RCTs, 2059 observational stud-
ies) and (with duplicates removed) 1841 papers (383 RCTs, 1443
observational studies).
In the first publication of this review we also examined 312 reports
for detailed assessment from the review on the effects of influenza
vaccines in the elderly (Jefferson 2010). Due to the comprehensive
nature of this Cochrane review we carried out a review with a
very focused study question and benefited from extensive searches,
which generated a large number of ’hits’ but a relatively low yield
of studies to include.
After our review’s second edition, reviews of ILI (Thomas 2014a)
and all-cause mortality (Thomas 2014b) were conducted that led
us to the decision for the third publication of this review to exclude
outcome data relating to influenza-like illness (Appendix 1) and
all-cause mortality(Appendix 6)asoutcome measures. Twostudies
that were in the second publication no longer contribute outcome
data to this review: one cluster-RCT (Hayward 2006), because the
main outcome measure was all-cause mortality and the secondary
measure was ILI; and a cohort study (Oshitani 2000), which used
ILI as the outcome measure.
Included studies
Five studies met the inclusion criteria (see Characteristics of
included studies table). Three cluster-RCTs contribute data to the
outcomes of interest to this review, recruiting a total of 5896 par-
ticipants(Carman 2000; Lemaitre 2009; Potter1997). These three
studies were comparable in their study populations, intervention
and outcome measures. The studies did not report on adverse
events.
Excluded studies
We excluded all 747 new citations identified in the 2013 review
update and the 379 in the 2015 searches because they either did
not have influenza vaccination outcome data for those aged 60
years or older or healthcare workers, or both, or did not report the
outcome data we specified, or reported only influenza antibody
levels.
Risk of bias in included studies
See the ’Risk of bias’ tables and Figure 1 and Figure 2. We down-
graded the quality of evidence for each of the outcomes of interest
due to risk of bias arising from lack of blinding or attrition bias.

 Allocation
There was adequate sequence generation in three studies. One
used a random number table (Carman 2000), one used a cen-
tralised random number generator (Lemaitre 2009), and for the
third study we considered that the process was likely to have been
carried out reliably (Hayward 2006). However, there was uncer-
tainty in one study (Potter 1997): “Hospital sites were stratified by
unit policy for vaccination, then randomised for their healthcare
workers to be routinely offered either influenza vaccination and
patients unvaccinated...”.
Blinding
No RCTs explicitly stated that they had appropriate means
of blinding participants or study personnel to vaccination. In
Carman 2000 and Potter 1997 there is no statement that any re-
searcher, assessor, data analyst, healthcare worker or participant
was blinded. In Carman 2000 the study nurses “took additional
opportunistic nose and throat swabs from non-randomised pa-
tients who the ward nurses thought had an influenza-like illness”.
In Potter 1997 ward nurses paged the research nurses “if any pa-
tients under their care developed clinical symptoms suggestive of
upper respiratory tract viral illness, influenza, or lower respiratory
tract infection,” and in Lemaitre 2009 “Influenza vaccination was
further recommended during face-to-face interviews with each
member of staff ... The study team individually met all administra-
tive staff, technicians and caregivers to invite them to participate
and volunteers were vaccinated at the end of the interview.”
Incomplete outcome data
Incomplete data were not addressed in the three studies (Carman
2000; Hayward 2006; Potter 1997).
Selective reporting
No study appeared to report results selectively.
Other potential sources of bias
For Potter 1997 potential sources of bias were as follows.
1. Selection bias: the total number of long-term care hospitals
in West and Central Scotland is not stated. There were
inconsistencies in outcome gradients (Table 1). In the population
under observation, Potter 1997 reported 216 cases of suspected
viral illness, 64 cases of influenza-like illness, 55 cases of
pneumonia, 72 deaths from pneumonia and 148 deaths from all
causes. In the sub-population of both vaccinated staff and
patients, Potter 1997 reported 24 cases of suspected viral illness,
two cases of influenza-like illness, seven cases of pneumonia, 10
deaths from pneumonia and 25 deaths from all causes. As these
gradients are not plausible (one would expect a greater
proportion of cases of influenza-like illness to be caused by
influenza during a period of high viral activity), the effect on all-
cause mortality is likely to reflect a selection bias rather than a
real effect of vaccination.
2. Performance bias: 67% of staff in active arm one and 43%
in active arm two were vaccinated.
3. There is no description of the vaccines administered,
vaccine matching or background influenza epidemiology.
For Carman 2000 potential sources of bias were as follows.
1. Selection bias: the total number of long-term care hospitals
in West and Central Scotland is not stated. In the long-term care
hospitals in which healthcare workers were offered vaccination,
residents had higher Barthel scores.
2. Performance bias: only 51% of healthcare workers in the
Lemaitre 2009 arm received vaccine in the long-term care
hospitals where vaccine was offered and 4.8% where it was not;
48% of patients received vaccine in the arm where healthcare
workers were offered vaccination and 33% in the arm where
healthcare workers were not.
3. Statistical bias: the analysis was not corrected for clustering,
unlike the Potter 1997 pilot; in the long-term care hospitals
where healthcare workers were offered vaccination, the patients
had significantly higher Barthel scores and were more likely to
receive influenza vaccine (no significance level stated) and due to
missing data these differences could not be adjusted for other
than by estimation. Statistical power may also have been a
problem as the detection rate of 6.7% was lower than the
estimated rate of 25% used in the power calculation.
The Potter 1997 and Carman 2000 cluster-RCTs can be regarded
as investigations in the same geographical area with a modest pos-
sible but unknown overlap of staff and residents. Only three of the
long-term care hospitals in the Potter 1997 study were included in
the Carman 2000 cluster-RCT because some of the homes were
closed down (e-mail communication from Dr. Stott) but the con-
tinuity of staff between the institutions is unknown.
Ethics approval: Carman 2000, Lemaitre 2009 and Potter 1997
received formal ethics approval. Carman2000 and Potter 1997 ob-
tained written informed consent from healthcare workers and wit-
nessed verbal consent from participants for nose swabs to be taken
and Potter 1997 for blood samples. The LTCIs already had policies
for opting in or opting out of influenza vaccination. Lemaitre 2009
obtained face-to-face informed consent from healthcare workers.

 The main findings of the review are presented in Summary of
findings for the main comparison.
Primary outcomes
1. Cases of influenza in those aged 60 years or older
confirmed by viral isolation or serological supporting
evidence (or both), plus a list of likely respiratory symptoms
Potter 1997 reported outcomes only for unvaccinated patients.
We computed a risk difference (RD) of 0.01, 95% confidence
interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.05, P value = 0.73); low quality evidence.
Carman 2000 reported data on influenza cases among vaccinated
and unvaccinated patients combined. We computed a RD of -
0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03, P value = 0.54). We were able to pool
the results for Carman 2000 and Potter 1997 and we computed
an overall RD of -0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03, P value = 0.45, I
2 statistic = 0% (Analysis 1.1). The pooled RD based on adjusted
study effect estimates was 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03 (Analysis
2.1).
2. Lower respiratory tract infection
OnlyPotter1997 reporteddataforlowerrespiratorytractinfection
and reported results separately for vaccinated and unvaccinated
patients. For vaccinated patients we computed a RD of -0.02,
95% CI -0.05 to 0.01, P value = 0.21. For the unvaccinated we
computedaRDof -0.02, 95%CI-0.06to 0.03,Pvalue =0.47.For
the vaccinated and unvaccinated patients combined we computed
a RD of -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.01, P value = 0.15, I2 statistic
= 0% (Analysis 1.2); moderate quality evidence.
3. Admission to hospital for respiratory illness
Only Lemaitre 2009 provided data for “admissions to hospital for
respiratory illness” and we computed a RD of 0.00, 95% CI -0.02
to 0.02, P value = 0.84 (Analysis 1.3). The pooled RD based on
adjusted study effect estimates was RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to
0.03 (Analysis 2.3), low quality evidence.
4. Deaths caused by respiratory illness
Potter 1997 reported data for deaths from pneumonia separately
for vaccinated patients and unvaccinated patients. For vaccinated
patients we computed a RD of -0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.01,
P value = 0.09 and for the unvaccinated we computed a RD of
-0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.01, P value = 0.18. Lemaitre 2009
reported results for “deaths from respiratory illness” (not further
defined) for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients combined and
we computed a RD of 0.00 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.01, P value = 0.23)
(Analysis 1.4). Since the I2 statistic was high (81%) we decided
not to combine the data across the studies and we have rated the
quality of evidence as very low.
5. Deaths from any cause
Potter 1997 reported outcomes separately for vaccinated patients
(RD -0.07 (-0.13 to -0.01) and unvaccinated patients RD 0.06
(95% CI -0.12 to -0.01). Carman 2000, Hayward 2006 and
Lemaitre 2009 reported data for vaccinated and unvaccinated pa-
tients combined. The size of the effect varied considerably across
the three studies (I squared 83%), with RDs between -0.09 and -
0.01 (Analysis 1.5). In view of the variation in the size and direc-
tion of the effects we elected not to combine the data in a meta-
analysis.
D I S C U S S I O N
We identified four cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
which met our criteria for outcome data to answer the question of
whether vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza protects
those aged 60 years or older residing in long-term care institutions
(LTCIs).
Pooled data showed no effect on specific outcomes: laboratory-
proven influenza (Carman 2000; Potter 1997), lower respiratory
tract infections (Potter 1997), admissions to hospital for lower
respiratory tract illness (Lemaitre 2009), and deaths from lower
respiratory tract illness (Lemaitre 2009; Potter 1997), with the
95% confidence interval (CI) in each case including unity.
One question is what the maximum contribution that influenza
vaccination of people aged 60 years or older could make in reduc-
ing total annual mortality. A population study by Simonsen 2006
used data from the US national multiple-cause-of-death databases
from 1968 to 2001 and found that for those aged 65 years or older,
mortality attributable to pneumonia or influenza never exceeded
10%of all deathsduringthose winters. The study byVila-Córcoles
2007 of 11,240 Spanish community-dwelling elderly, conducted
between January 2002 and April 2005, found the attributable
mortality risk in individuals not vaccinated against influenza was
24 deaths/100,000 person-weeks within influenza periods. Vacci-
nation prevented 14% of these deaths for the population and one
death was prevented for every 239 annual vaccinations (ranging
from 144 in winter 2005 to 1748 in winter 2002). It should be
noted that these data are not for residents of LTCIs. A mathemat-
ical model predicted that for a 30-bed unit, an increase in health-
care worker vaccination rates from 0% to 100% would decrease
resident influenza infections by 60% (van den Dool 2008).

 Summary of main results
We identified three cluster-RCTs that provided outcome data that
met our criteria. Pooled data showed that there was no effect on
laboratory-proven influenza, lower respiratory tract infections, ad-
missions to hospital for respiratory illness or deaths from respira-
tory illness.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Four cluster-RCTs focused directly on the question of the effect
of healthcare worker vaccination on the mortality and morbidity
of long-term care facility residents aged 60 years or older. The
cluster-RCTs have certain common features: they are all under-
powered to detect any difference in influenza mortality, which is
a rare event. All participants, were they residents or carers, were
unblinded to their intervention status. All trials showed no reduc-
tion in influenza or its complications (the registered indication for
the vaccines). Our review has yielded no clear indication of ben-
efit on specific outcome measures of influenza. It is noteworthy
that the studies did report significant results for a syndrome (in-
fluenza-like illness - ILI), which is caused only in part by influenza
viruses. The absence of usable outcome data for the specific ef-
fects of healthcare worker vaccination programmes from Hayward
2006 and Oshitani 2000 restricts the applicability of our findings
further.
Quality of the evidence
We downgraded the quality of evidence for each outcome due to
risk of bias (Summary of findings for the main comparison). A
key uncertainty for the outcomes of influenza and hospital ad-
mission due to respiratory infection is low power, prompting us
to downgrade for imprecision. The analysis of both adjusted and
unadjusted study results for three of the four outcomes of interest
were consistent with each other. We considered the inconsistency
in the size and direction of the risk differences for cause specific
and non-specific mortality to be very serious. We decided not to
combine the data for these outcomes. However, the high I2 statis-
tic observed for the outcomes of influenza-related mortality and
mortality due to any cause were lower after recalculating the events
and sample sizes to take account of the design effect . We discuss
the consequences of our choice of effect measure below.
Potential biases in the review process
We are aware of two important features of our approach that could
have influencedourresultsandconclusions. Firstly, the high degree
of statistical heterogeneity for the outcome of influenza-related
mortality may reflect the decision to use risk difference. As an
absolute measure of effect risk difference is less likely to be stable
across the different studies than relative measures such as odds
or risk ratios. Secondly, the intracluster correlation coefficients
(ICCs) we used for two of the studies were based on the estimate
provided by Hayward 2006. Although the recalculation of the
effective sample size was done in accordance with recommended
procedures (Higgins 2011), we have assumed that the adjustment
required is the same across the outcomes extracted for each study.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Ahmed 2014 identified the same cluster-RCTs that we did and
rated the quality of evidence for many influenza-specific outcomes
as low and very low (italics in original, bolding added), which is
compatible with our assessments although we have downgraded
for different reasons (see below). The evidence for non-specific
outcomes was graded as moderate quality.
Ahmed included three observational studies that we excluded:
Bénet 2012 (cannot separate outcomes for those > 60), Enserink
2011 (outcome measure is ILI) and Wendelboe 2011 (problems
in design and execution such that the results cannot be relied
on). Both our review and Ahmed’s used laboratory-confirmed in-
fluenza as an outcome. However, the other outcomes we assessed
were specific to influenza (hospitalisation for influenza and deaths
from influenza) whereas Ahmed used non-specific outcomes (all-
cause hospitalisation and all-cause deaths). We also assessed lower
respiratory tract infection. None of our outcome measures had
statistically significant results.

Implications for practice
The four cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) contributing
outcome data to our review are at high risk of bias and pooled data
have not shown convincing evidence of benefit on the outcomes
of direct interest, namely laboratory-proven influenza (low qual-
ity evidence), lower respiratory tract infections (moderate qual-
ity evidence), admissions to hospital (low quality evidence), and
deaths from lower respiratory tract illness or from all causes (very
low quality evidence). Where meta-analysis was possible the 95%
confidence interval (CI) in each case has not excluded little or
no effect of vaccination programmes. We conclude that there is
an absence of high quality evidence that vaccinating healthcare
workers against influenza protects people aged 60 years or older in
their care on influenza-specific outcomes. There is little evidence
to justify medical care and public health practitioners mandating
influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for the el-
derly in long-term care institutions (LTCIs).

Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for people aged 60 or older living in long-term care institutions (Review)

 Implications for research
There are currently only three cluster-RCTS that provide outcome
data that meet our criteria to evaluate the impact on residents aged
60 years or older of vaccinating their healthcare workers against
influenza. All of these studies are at high risk of bias. RCTs are
needed with minimal risk of bias from sequence generation, fail-
ure to conceal allocation, and performance, attrition and detection
bias and these should be adequately powered for the key outcomes
of laboratory-proven influenza, hospitalisation for pneumonia and
death from pneumonia. They should carefully define and mea-
sure outcomes including laboratory-proven influenza, lower res-
piratory tract infection, cause of hospitalisation and deaths from
pneumonia. They should carefully consider the degree to which
they must, to adequately assess outcomes, obtain proof of diagno-
sis for all participants by laboratory testing all participants with
appropriate symptoms for influenza and all other likely viruses,
performing blood cultures, white blood cell counts and other lab-
oratory investigations and chest X-rays if pneumonia is suspected,
and following the course of all hospitalised patients by scrutinising
individual records so that they can definitively assess all outcomes
and co-morbidities. A particular issue in the analysis of data from
studies with a cluster design is the provision and use of an intra-
cluster correlation coefficient (ICC). It is a major limitation with
the analysis of data in our review that we have not had available
a reliable estimate of this quantity for each of the outcomes of
interest.
The area of interest is those aged 60 years or older in LTCIs.
Therefore, if the existing LTCIs’ organisational structure is to be
used to implement the interventions, these will need to be given to
clusters of residents aged 60 years or older and healthcare workers,
which will make blinding difficult. An important ethical issue is
informed consent by those aged 60 years or older and healthcare
workers. It is not ethical to blind participants or healthcare workers
but the researchers, data assessors and statisticians could all be
blinded.
The elderly are much keener to be vaccinated than healthcare
workers and there is extensive literature about the group of health-
care workers who say they do not feel vulnerable to influenza, do
not believe the vaccine is effective and are afraid of side effects,
and some of these do not perceive risk for their patients. Persis-
tence of these beliefs may limit uptake by healthcare workers and
make it difficult to test conclusively the effect of very high levels
of healthcare worker influenza vaccination.
A large publicly funded trial is needed to test combinations of
interventions to reduce influenza and mortality from influenza in
those aged 60 years or older in LTCIs with thorough delivery of
each intervention: vaccinating residents and healthcare workers,
hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven
influenza in individuals with influenza-like illness by using nasal
swabs, quarantine of floors and entire LTCIs during outbreaks,
avoiding new admissions, prompt use of antivirals and asking
healthcare workers with an influenza-like illness not to present for
work.

Methods
Purpose: to assess the effects of staff vaccination against influenza on resident mortality
in long-term care hospitals
Design: cluster-randomised study (C-RCT) conducted in Scotland during the 1996 to
1997 influenza season. The study identified 10 long-term care geriatric hospitals in West
and Central Scotland with a policy of vaccinating all patients against influenza if they
had no contraindications and then only on the request of the patients or their relatives.
Pairs of hospitals in each of these clusters were matched on patient enrolment and then
in a Latin square design were randomised by a table of random numbers for the HCWs
to be offered influenza vaccination or not
Anonymous questionnaires were sent to ward nurses on 31 March 1997 to ask if they had
received influenza vaccination and these data were used to estimate vaccine acceptance
for all HCWs in hospitals where influenza vaccine had not been offered to HCWs. In
each hospital a random sample chosen by computer of 50% patients was selected for
virological monitoring
Data from the Scottish Centre for Infection and Epidemiological Health and from GPs
were used to define the start of the influenza season. Combined nasal and throat swabs
were taken from patients every 2 weeks from 14 December 1996 to 14 February 1997.
Opportunistic samples were also taken from patients whom the ward nurses thought
had influenza. Samples were taken within 12 hours of death of any patient who died.
Samples were analysed by RT-PCR analysis
Results were summarised for the 2 groups of LTCIs. Hospitals were not well-matched
for patient vaccination rates and Barthel scores (Wikipedia 2009) and post-hoc statistical
adjustments could not be made because of missing data. The outcome was the empirical
logic of mortality for each cluster (= natural logarithm of the odds on death)
Statistics: the power calculation was based on the previous study by Potter 1997 and
the authors computed that with 1600 patients in 20 hospitals they would have ≥ 80%
power to detect a decrease in mortality from 15% to 10% with alpha = 0.05 (2-tailed),
allowing for the clustered design. The power calculation for virological sampling showed
that 500 patients would be required to give 80% power at 5% significance (2-tailed) to
detect a decrease in influenza infection from 25% to 15%
Mortality rates were compared in the 2 groups with the Mann-Whitney test. “Incomplete
data for patient-level covariates meant that a full multilevel approach to the analysis was
not possible without making strong, implausible and untestable assumptions about the
mechanisms that led to the incomplete data. Instead, we calculated summary statistics to
describe the mix of patients in each hospital and these values were included in a multiple
linear-regression analysis. The response variable in these analyses was the empirical logit
of each hospital’s mortality rate that is, the natural logarithm of the odds on death.”
Participants
Country: Scotland
Setting: 20 long-term care hospitals in Glasgow
Eligible participants: 749 participants were residents of facilities in the arm in which
1217 HCWs were offered vaccination (620 accepted) and 688 in the arm in which
HCWs were not offered vaccination. Day and night nurses, doctors, therapists, porters
and ancillary staff (including domestic staff and ward cleaners) were offered influenza

vaccination
Age: 82
Gender: 70% F
Interventions
Intervention: influenza vaccination. The type, dosage and route are not described. A
good match in the study year between the prevailing strain and the vaccine strains was
reported
Control: no influenza vaccination
Outcomes
1. RT-PCR and tissue culture for influenza A or B. A random sample of 50% of
patients in each hospital was selected for virological monitoring of influenza infections
by nose and throat swabs every 2 weeks, which were sent for RT-PCR analysis and
tissue culture. “At the times when study nurses took routine samples, they took
additional opportunistic nose and throat swabs from non-randomised patients who the
ward nurses thought had an influenza-like illness. The ward staff were asked to take
routine nasal swabs within 12 hours of death for any patient who died.”
2. Mortality (all causes)
(N.B. clinical outcomes were not reported but were used to investigate the viral circula-
tion in the facility)
Notes
The situation that 10 long-term care hospitals had a policy of routinely vaccinating
residents for influenza vaccination and 10 did not, permitted a Latin square design RCT
of offering influenza vaccination or not to HCWs within each of these clusters
Analysis was not according to intention-to-treat
Mean cluster size: 72 (based on mortality data)
Intra-cluster correlation coefficient: 0.023 as reported in Hayward 2006
Despite no difference in isolation of influenza viruses between clusters, the authors con-
clude that vaccines are protective. In addition, they fail to comment on the implausibility
of the vaccines’ effect on aspecific outcomes (ILI) and lack of effect on influenza

No selective reporting
Other bias
High risk
1. Selection bias: the total number of
long-term care hospitals in West and
Central Scotland is not stated. In the
long-term care hospitals in which HCWs
were offered vaccination, residents had
higher Barthel scores
2. Performance bias: only 51% of
HCWs in the arm received vaccine in the
long-term care hospitals where vaccine
was offered and 4.8% where it was not;
48% of patients received vaccine in the
arm where HCWs were offered
vaccination and 33% in the arm where
HCWs were not
3. Statistical bias: the analysis was not
corrected for clustering, unlike the Potter
1997 pilot; in the long-term care hospitals
where HCWs were offered vaccination,
the patients had significantly higher
Barthel scores and were more likely to
receive influenza vaccine (no significance
level stated) and due to missing data these
differences could not be adjusted for other
than by estimation. Statistical power may
also have been a problem as the detection
rate of 6.7% was lower than the estimated
rate of 25% used in the power calculation

Methods
Purpose: to increase staff vaccination rates in care homes by adoption of a policy to
encourage staff to be vaccinated against influenza and providing vaccination clinics
Design: C-RCT; 48 nursing homes were placed in matched pairs (by size of home, %
of high dependency and mortality of residents) within 3 regions (northern, central and
southern England), then the 25 homes that most closely matched were selected and
randomised by a researcher, blinded to the home’s identity and characteristics, using a
table of random numbers. Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel
surveillance scheme were used to divide the study into periods of influenza activity and
no influenza activity
Duration of study: 3 November 2003 to 28 March 2004 and 1 November 2004 to 27
March 2005
Interval between intervention and when outcome was measured: 3 November 2003 to
28 March 2004 and 1 November 2004 to 27 March 2005
Power computation: to detect reduction in all-cause mortality of residents from 15% to
10% (intra-cluster variance = 2.3%) with 90% power and alpha = 0.05% level required
20 pairs of homes each with an average of 20 residents (based on findings from pilot
study)
Statistics: outcomes were analysed using aggregate data for each cluster and “to take
account of the matched clustered design we used a random-effects meta-analysis. This
treated the results from each pair of homes as a separate study and provided a pooled
estimate of effect weighted for the size of homes and the size of the effects and their
standard errors.” “When significant protection of residents was observed we calculated
the number of staff vaccinations needed to prevent one event in residents (number
needed to treat) as number of vaccinations given in all intervention homes divided by
the average number of residents in all intervention homes multiplied by the weighted
rate difference.”
Participants
Country: UK
Setting: private chain of nursing homes, whose policy was not to offer influenza vacci-
nation to staff
Eligible participants: (health status): 1 intervention and 1 control home were unable
to provide data so they and their matched home were excluded, leaving 44 homes for
analysis; eligible staff were all staff in intervention homes (full-time: n = 844 in both
2003 to 2004 and in 2004 to 2005) and (part-time: n = 766 in 2003 to 2004 and n =
882 in 2004 to 2005)
Age: Avg 83
Gender: 71% F
Interventions
Intervention 1: Adoption of policy in intervention homes of vaccinating staff against
influenza, including a lead nurse in each home was trained to promote vaccination of
staff; distribute leaflets and posters and liaise to provide 3 vaccination clinics for staff
in each home. Staff were sent a letter explaining the study and the potential benefits of
influenza vaccination
Control: staff in control homes received a letter describing the study and the Department
of Health recommendation that those with chronic illnesses should receive influenza
vaccination
No attempt to influence vaccination of residents in any home

Methods
Purpose: to assess the effect of staff and resident influenza vaccination on resident all-
cause mortality
Design: C-RCT. A written invitation was sent to the 376 nursing homes with 50 to 200
elderly people (out of a total 1105 nursing homes) in the Paris area and 88 responded.
Of these, 40 with staff influenza coverage < 40% during the 2005 to 2006 winter season
were selected. Each institution was pair-matched on size, staff vaccination coverage 2005
to 2006 and Group Iso Resources (GIR) weighted average disability score (which ranges
from 1 = severe disability to 6 = total autonomy). Randomisation was centrally based
using a random number generator
Statistics: it was assumed that the influenza epidemic would last 2 months, mortality
would be 8% in the control arm and resident mortality would be reduced 40% after
staff vaccination to 4.8% in the intervention arm. 20 pairs of nursing homes with 2000
residents in each group were required to obtain 80% power with 2-tailed hypothesis
testing. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. “Odds ratios were calculated using alternating
logistic regression, with one-nested log odds ratios to model the association between the
responses of the same pair and the same nursing home within the pair.” “In secondary
analyses, multivariate estimates were adjusted for the residents’ age, vaccination status,
GIR disability score and Charlson comorbidity index.”
Participants
Country: France
Setting: 40 nursing homes near Paris
Eligible participants: 3483 patients in the 40 nursing homes
In the intervention arm there were 1592 residents at the beginning and 130 entered
the homes during the study period (total = 1722); 989 staff were present at recruitment
and 678 (68.6%) were vaccinated. In the control arm there were 1558 residents at the
beginning and 120 entered the homes during the study period (total = 1678); there were
1015 staff at recruitment and 323 (31.8%) were vaccinated
1452 (84.3%) of patients in the intervention and 1385 (82.5%) in the control group
were vaccinated during the 2005 to 2006 winter season

Gender: 77.% F
Interventions
Intervention:
1. Promotional campaign with posters, leaflets and an information meeting with the
study team to sensitise staff to the benefits of influenza vaccination for oneself and
residents
2. Face-to-face interviews with each member of staff present in nursing homes
between 6 November and 15 December 2006
3. The study team met all administrative staff, technicians and caregivers to invite
them to participate and those who volunteered were vaccinated at the end of the
interview. The vaccine was inactivated Influvac (Solvay Pharma Laboratories), with 15
µG of each of A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like (H3N2), A/New Caledonia/20/99

Methods
Purpose: to assess the effect of staff and resident influenza vaccination rates on resident
influenza-like illness (ILI)
Design: prospective cohort study assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccination levels
in patients of long-term nursing care facilities (LTCIs) by vaccination coverage rates
of HCWs (less than 10 or more than 10 vaccinated HCWs per facility), in Niigata,
Japan. Niigata Prefecture and Niigata City conducted mandatory surveys of influenza
vaccine status and occurrence of ILI every 2 weeks from January to March 1999. During
this period more than 20% of facilities had outbreaks and more than 10% of residents
experienced ILI during an influenza A (H3N2) epidemic. All LTCIs in Niigata Prefecture
provided reports. Information (assumed questionnaires) included number of residents
in each institution, number of vaccinated residents and staff and weekly ILI in residents.
No ILI definition is reported
An influenza outbreak was defined as 10% of more of the residents in a home reporting
ILI symptoms during a week
2 types of LTCIs, special nursing homes for the elderly and geriatric health services
facilities, were used. Both are for the elderly who need constant care, special nursing
homes are for the elderly who have more severe conditions
Statistics: X2andFisher’sexacttestforunivariate analysis. X2 forlinear trendand Mantel-
Haenszel ORs for different categories of resident vaccination rates. Logistic regression

Participants
Country: Japan
Setting: 149 LTCIs in Niigata Prefecture and Niigata City
Eligible participants: the text reports 12,784 residents in 149 facilities were included in
the study with 3933 (30.8%) vaccinated and 7459 staff with 1532 (20.5%) vaccinated.
However, table 2 shows 8669 residents living in homes where fewer than 10 staff were
vaccinated and 4073 living in homes with 10 staff vaccinated, for a total of 12,742. The
totals for residents living in homes with fewer than 10 staff vaccinated is given as 8699
but the subcategories add to 8669 and for the homes where 10 staff were vaccinated the
total is given as 4085 but the subcategories add to 4073

Interventions
Intervention: trivalent influenza vaccine containing A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1), A/Syd-
ney/5/97 (H3N2) and B/Mie/1/93, which was a good match against the circulating
strain. No mention of pneumococcal vaccination is made
Control: no control group
Outcomes
ILI (no case definition). During the period of surveying the number of ILI cases per
week exceeded 10% of the residents in 34 (22.8%) of facilities
Notes
Choice of outcome is inappropriate (ILI is a non-specific outcome)

Methods
Purpose: to assess the effect of staff and patient vaccination against influenza in residents
1. Serologically proven influenza
2. ILI
3. Lower respiratory tract infection
4. Deaths (from all causes)
5. Deaths (from pneumonia)
Design: 6 geriatric long-stay hospitals in Glasgow in 1994 had an “opt-out” policy in
which patients were routinely given influenza vaccine unless they refused it or had a
major contraindication and 6 had an “opt-in” policy in which patients were given vaccine
only if they or their relatives requested it following advertisement on the ward that it was
available
Hospitals were stratified by policy on vaccination then randomised for their HCWs to
be “routinely offered either influenza vaccination or no vaccination.” Study conducted
in Scotland, during the 1994 to 1995 influenza season, in the community. Follow-up
period was 1 October 1994 to 31 March 1995. 12 hospitals were randomly allocated to
offer vaccination of HCWs or not; facilities were grouped according to the vaccination
policy. The vaccination of staff and patients was voluntary. The study thus presents data
on 4 sub-populations:
- staff and patients not vaccinated (S0P0)
- staff not vaccinated, patients vaccinated (S0PV)
- staff and patients vaccinated (SVPV)
- staff vaccinated and patients not vaccinated (SVP0)
Statistical analysis: “Baseline characteristics, morbidity and mortality in the 4 groups of
hospitals were compared using the X2 test, unpaired Student’s test and Wilcoxon rank
sum test as appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for the effects of staff
and patient vaccination. Survival analysis was by Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates,
using the Tarone Ware test for statistical significance. Cluster analysis, examining mor-
tality rates and other outcomes by hospital site, was also done.”

Participants
Country: Scotland
Setting: 12 geriatric medical long-term care hospitals in Glasgow
Eligible participants: 1059 hospital residents. All 1078 HCWs (day and night nurses and
nursing auxiliaries, ward cleaners, doctors, therapists and porters) in SVPV and SVP0
hospitals were offered vaccination but “voluntary workers, patients’ friends and relatives
and other casual or occasional ward visitors were not offered vaccine.” Observed units
were hospitals and not patients
654 (61%) of the 1078 agreed to participate; vaccination was contraindicated in 34 (3%)
and 47 (4%) were on long-term sick leave and unavailable
The physical dependency level of patients was measured on the 20-point Barthel scale.
The hospitals where patients were routinely offered vaccination (S0PV and SVPV) had
lower Bartel scores (P value = 0.003) than those not offered vaccination but there were
no differences between hospitals where HCWs were vaccinated and those where they
were not
Age: 77
Gender: 71% F
Interventions
Vaccination of patients and HCWs began October 1994 (“4 weeks before the earliest
likely start date of the annual influenza outbreak”). Parenteral influenza vaccine. Vaccine
strains probably matched the circulating strain
Outcomes
1. Serologically proven influenza (paired sera in 225 consenting patients in the
“patients not vaccinated” arms)
2. ILI (defined as a temperature of ≥ 37°C, “plus one of the following symptoms:
new-onset cough, coryza, sore throat, malaise, headache, or muscle aches” - reported
singly or within the ILI outcome) and was monitored from the end of October 1994 to
the end of March 1995
3. LRTI (“was identified by the presence of (1) pulmonary crackles, wheeze or
tachypnoea plus temp ≥ 37 °C or WBC > 10 x 109/L or (2) a positive sputum culture”
and was monitored from the end of October 1994 to the end of March 1995
4. Deaths (from all causes)
5. Deaths (from pneumonia)
All deaths and discharges and admissions to the wards were recorded
Ward staff notified the research nurse of any patient who developed clinical symptoms
of upper respiratory tract viral illness, influenza or lower respiratory tract infection and
the research nurse visited the patient within 24 hours to record symptoms, clinical signs
and investigations on standardised forms. “Chest radiographs were not included as part
of the routine assessment of suspected lower respiratory tract infection, as for many of
the peripheral hospitals, it would have required an ambulance journey for the patient.
” “Patients with suspected viral illness who gave verbal consent had a nasopharyngeal
aspirate (NPA) sample obtained within 48 hours of notification of symptoms. IFA for
influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydia psittaci and adenovirus
antigens” were obtained
Antibody levels to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) were ascertained by com-
plement fixation in consenting patients who had not received influenza vaccination
Notes
Staff vaccination was incomplete and variable; results were presented by hospital group
and not by vaccination status of patients. The authors concluded that vaccination of
HCWs was associated with lower mortality and ILI. These benefits were not evident

1. Selection bias: the total number of
long-term care hospitals in West and
Central Scotland is not stated. There were
inconsistencies in outcome gradients (see
Table 1). In the population under
observation, Potter 1997 reported 216
cases of suspected viral illness, 64 cases of
ILI, 55 cases of pneumonia, 72 deaths
from pneumonia and 148 deaths from all
causes; in the sub-population of both

reported 24 cases of suspected viral illness,
2 cases of ILI, 7 cases of pneumonia, 10

Study of 18 long-term care facilities in the Netherlands in which GPs and nurse practitioners
reported ILI cases. They did not use the WHO or CDC ILI definitions but required sudden
onset and one symptom (fever or febrile feeling, malaise, headache, sore throat or shortness of
breath). These criteria include many respiratory illnesses. They compared patient ILI incidence in
facilities with < 15% and ≥ 15% HCW vaccination, December 2008-April 2009. There were “no
institutional influenza outbreaks” but “ILI was frequently diagnosed.” This absence of outbreaks
implies that their ILI measure did not measure influenza. Nevertheless, they computed an adjusted
rate ratio for patient ILI rates = 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 1.2)

Retrospective cross-sectional study of 344 nursing homes (310 replied) from one chain in the US,
with reports of staff and resident vaccination rates and whether the home had an ILI cluster (≥ 3
residents with ILI within 72 hours)
Wendelboe 2011
75 long-term care facilities in New Mexico, US, during the influenza seasons of 2006-7 and 2007-
8. 12% (9 homes) provided no reports in 2006-7 and 18% (which computes as 13.5 homes!) no
reports in 2007-8. However, data are presented for all 75 homes (15 homes which had an outbreak
and 50 which had none). An influenza outbreak was defined as a single patient case. Cases were
diagnosed by viral culture or a rapid antigen test
The authors noted that: “The ecologic study design limits our ability to control for certain charac-
teristics such as the distribution of residents’ ages and the presence of comorbidities… For example,
it is possible that certain facilities cared for residents in poorer health, which likely resulted in those
patients who were vaccinated against influenza being less effectively protected from influenza by
vaccination.” The authors also noted that: “Another potential limitation is that we restricted our
surveillance to HCWs with direct patient care. Future surveillance systems may find it helpful
to include all healthcare personnel (including clerical, dietary, housekeeping, maintenance, and
volunteer personnel)…”
There were no data on the total number of patients during the 2 years. The odds of an “outbreak”
were paradoxically higher with resident vaccination rates of 91% to 100% compared to 0% to
90% (OR 4.85, 95% CI 1.17 to 20.18) implying more vulnerable patients were more likely to
be vaccinated. The authors computed an adjusted OR of 0.76 (0.62 to 0.93) for a reduction in
“outbreaks” for a 10% increase in HCW vaccination. However, with only 21 cases and an unknown
denominator it is inappropriate to place weight on the odds ratios computed for the effects of
HCW vaccination. This is not a RCT and is subject to unmeasured confounders such as a superior
LCT culture, which limits the transmission of influenza by hand-washing, quarantining patients
and limiting visitors

Appendix 1. Reasons not to use influenza-like illness in assessing the effectiveness of influenza
vaccines
Influenza-like illness (ILI)
We believe that there are seven reasons not to use ILI as an outcome.
1. There are multiple definitions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition is a temperature ≥ 38°C,
cough or sore throat or both and the absence of a known cause other than influenza (CDC 2006). Health Canada’s Flu Watch uses
fever, cough and ≥ one of sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia or prostration (www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch).
2. The percentage of ILI cases that are laboratory-proven influenza cases is low. During the 2009 H1N1p pandemic in Marseille,
GPs assessed 660 patients as ILI cases: 158 were positive for A/H1N1p. Of the 502 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) influenza-negative patients 296 were randomly selected for further testing: 82 were positive for at least one other virus (58
human rhinovirus, nine parainfluenza viruses 1-4, nine human coronavirus OC43, five enterovirus, four adenovirus and two human
metapneumovirus) and 204 were negative for all 18 viruses tested (Thiberville 2012). A RCT in 46 Hutterite colonies in Canada
defined ILI as fever ≥ 38°C, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headaches, sinus problems, muscle ache, fatigue, ear ache and chills but
only 37 (26%) of 142 tested were PCR positive (Barbara 2012). A study in India defined ILI as sudden onset of fever > 38°C or a
history of sudden onset of fever in the recent past (< three days), cough or sore throat and/or rhinorrhoea and SARI (severe acute
respiratory infections) as an ILI with breathlessness or difficulty in breathing/tachypnoea or clinically suspected pneumonia (in
children) with increased respiratory rates. They isolated influenza from only 617 (4.43%) of 13,928 throat or nasal swabs (Chadha
2011). A study in Taiwan of 26,601 ILI cases found influenza in only 25% by viral culture or RT-PCR (Chuang 2012).
3. A review of 25 studies in which physicians had diagnosed patients as having ILI found in most studies < 25% are RT-PCR
positive, some patients had adenovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
or multiple respiratory viruses, or bacteria, and 50% identified no pathogen (Thomas 2014a).
4. There is a remarkable similarity between the symptoms of influenza A/H1N1p and human rhinovirus. Of the 660 patients in
Marseille, 85% had a fever (91% H1N1p, 79% HRV), 83% had a cough (97%, 86%), 75% had ILI symptoms (89%, 74%), 65% a
sore throat (65%, 69%), 93% asthenia (96%, 88%), 80% myalgia (80%, 74%), 63% rhinorrhoea (74%, 81%), 77% headache
(78%, 69%), 65% chills (74%, 52%), 40% arthralgia (41%, 31%) and 35% nausea (39%, 23%) (Thiberville 2012).
5. Some studies use ILI in circular definitions resulting in unclear outcomes. The Australian Flutracking programme defined ILI as
the proportion of participants in their programme who had both fever and cough during the peak influenza period for each year 2007
to 2009. In a completely circular manner the peak influenza period was defined as the four consecutive weeks with the highest
Flutracking ILI rates. No analysis was performed of whether any symptom correlated with laboratory-proven influenza (Dalton
2011). A study of “influenza activity” in Hong Kong also achieved circularity by confounding together the laboratory proven
influenza rate and the ILI rate: “The product of the laboratory influenza detection rate and the GP ILI consultation rate was used as
the reference standard indicator of influenza virus activity, rather than the laboratory data alone which suffer from denominator
dilution during periods of non-influenza epidemics and the GP ILI data alone which suffer from numerator dilution because not all
ILI episodes are associated with influenza” (Lau 2012).
6. Some studies argue that multiple viral activity databases which may have peaks at similar times measure the same phenomenon.
A study in Singapore during the 2009 pandemic defined ILI by the WHO criteria, plus new onset respiratory symptoms and
temperature > 38°C and multiplied the rate of ILI cases diagnosed by 23 sentinel GPs (n of patients not stated) by the “relative
proportion of ILI seen by the average GP“ and thereby estimated the ILI rate at 15% (Bayesian credible intervals 10%, 25%). A
separate serological study of samples from 727 adult patients four weeks before, four weeks after the epidemic peak and four weeks
after the epidemic subsided estimated the influenza rate at 17% (BCI 14%, 20%) and the two rates were presented as confirming each
other. There was no relationship between the two samples, which were merely used to attempt estimates of the rate of ILI and
influenza activity during the epidemic and no assessment was made of the utility of the ILI definition (Lee 2011). A study of
”influenza activity“ during 166 weeks in the US 2003-8 compared the CDC Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (which uses the
CDC ILI definition and a network of ”health care providers“), Google Flu Trends (weekly percentage of persons seeking health care
with ILI) and the CDC Influenza Virologic Surveillance System. The Pearson correlation coefficient between Google Flu trends and
CDC Virus surveillance was 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.79) and with CDC ILI surveillance was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.96) and
between the two CDC databases 0.85 (0.81 to 0.89). There was no attempt to identify individuals across all three databases and no
assessment of the utility of symptoms (Ortiz 2011).
7. Influenza rapid diagnostic tests have low sensitivity. There is an increasing tendency to use rapid influenza diagnostic tests for ILI
cases. A review of 159 studies evaluating 26 rapid influenza diagnostic tests found the pooled sensitivity was 62.3% (95% CI 57.9%
47

 to 66.6%) and specificity 98% (97.5% to 98.7%), with lower sensitivity in adults 53.9% (47.9% to 59.8%). If these are used to assess
the effectiveness of influenza vaccines further inaccuracy will be introduced (Chartrand 2012).
Appendix 2. Previous search
For our original search in 2006 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Database
of Systematic Reviews and the NHS Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1);
MEDLINE (January 1966 to Week 1, February 2006); EMBASE (1974 to March 2006); Biological Abstracts (1969 to December
2005) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (1974 to March 2006).
MEDLINE was searched using the following search terms in combination with stages I, II and III of the highly sensitive search strategy
defined by The Cochrane Collaboration and detailed in Appendix 5b of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Deeks 2005).
A search in 2013 identified no new studies for inclusion. A search on 27 October 2015 identified 153 RCTs and 236 observational
studies. No studies were eligible for inclusion.

This strategy was adapted to search the other electronic databases. See below for the EMBASE search strategy. There were no language
or publication restrictions. The search of CENTRAL included trial reports identified in the systematic search by hand of the journal
Vaccine. To identify additional published and unpublished studies the Science Citation Index-Expanded was used to identify articles
that cite the relevant studies. The relevant studies were also keyed into PubMed and the Related Articles feature used.

 Appendix 6. Reasons not to use all-cause mortality as an outcome measure in assessing the
effectiveness of influenza vaccines
All-cause mortality
There are three reasons not use all-cause mortality to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccine.
1. Mortality attributable to influenza is a small proportion of all deaths. For those aged ≥ 65 in the US national multiple-cause-of-
death databases 1968 to 2001 mortality attributable to pneumonia or influenza never exceeded 10% of all winter deaths (Simonsen
2006). All-cause deaths could be subject to considerable bias and fluctuations as an estimate of influenza mortality.
2. The number of nursing home residents with proven respiratory infections is low. A unique inclusive prospective study in France
of 44,869 nursing home residents aged ≥ 65 found < 4.5% of the nursing home residents studied had an upper or lower respiratory
tract infection, with 1.31% definite (95% CI 1.09 to 1.68) (using McGeer’s consensus definition, which is a physician diagnosis
(McGeer 1991)) and 3.34% probable (2.88 to 3.87). Influenza vaccine had been received by 93.4% of the patients and
pneumococcal vaccine by 13% (Chami 2011).
3. Many cases of ”influenza“ are not laboratory-proven and are not recorded on death certificates. Three statistical approaches have
attempted to use existing databases to predict mortality due to influenza.
i) The first assumes all differences in mortality comparing virus and non-virus seasons are due to influenza. A study in France
using data from a sentinel network of GPs estimated only 3.35% (176,053) of all 5,295,480 deaths from 1998 to 2007 were due to
ILI and 2.14% (113,240) due to cold spells. Mortality in the four winter months correlated with reported ILI (r = 0.75, P value =
0.02) (Pin 2012). A study in the US and Japan had similar findings (Charu 2011). Mortality due to influenza cannot be estimated
from these ILI data.
ii) The second distributes ”influenza related deaths“ among co-morbidities. A study of weekly mortality data from the US
National Health Statistics database 1997 to 2007 attributed an average of 11.92 (95% CI 10.1 to 13.6) deaths/100,000 to influenza,
with 9.41 (8.3 to 10.5) to A/H3N2 years and 2.51 to influenza B years. These 11.92 deaths/100,000 ascribed to influenza were then
further partitioned into: all circulatory causes 4.6 (3.79 to 5.39), all respiratory 3.58 (3.04 to 4.14), cancer 0.87 (0.68 to 1.05),
diabetes 0.33 (0.26 to 0.39), renal disease 0.19 (0.14 to 0.24), CNS 0.42 (0.31 to 0.53) and Alzheimer’s 0.41 (0.3 to 0.52) and the
authors concluded that 69% of the ”influenza associated mortality“ was attributable to circulatory and respiratory causes (Goldstein
2012). A study in the US and South Africa estimated excess deaths over baseline winter deaths as 16% for South Africa and 6% for the
US. Within co-morbidity diagnoses the percentage of excess deaths over baseline winter deaths for all respiratory causes was estimated
as 25% and 14%, for pneumonia and influenza as 29% and 20%, for cerebrovascular events as 16% and 4%, for diabetes as 13% and
5% and for ischaemic heart disease as 9% and 6% (Cohen 2010). A study in Canada assumed that recorded influenza-certified deaths
substantially underrepresented influenza activity and estimated there were 3834 (1.9%) ”influenza-attributable deaths“ and allocated
877 to ischaemic heart disease, 563 to pneumonia, 529 to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 349 to other heart
disease, 295 to cancer and 249 to stroke and then assessed whether their statistical model provided good predictions of these allocated
deaths (Schanzer 2007). The precise number of deaths due to influenza cannot be known from these data and statistical methods.
iii) The third computes a moving mortality average for the 13-month period centred on each month, assuming that these 13-
month periods would be ”unaffected by preceding or following epidemics.“ For each disease class and month the 13-month moving
average is then subtracted from the observed mortality. For unpublished data 1959 to 1999 from the public use data files of the US
National Center for Health Statistics the authors created a time series for each class with a common metric by converting data into z
scores with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. The peak months for pneumonia and influenza coincided with those for
ischaemic heart disease 34 of 40 times, with cerebrovascular disease 33 of 40 times and with diabetes 30 of 40 times. However,
midwinter peaks for pneumonia and influenza, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes varied in size and differed
widely in mean values and seasonal variation. As expected, the tallest peaks in mortality curves occurred during the A(H3N2) 1968/9
pandemic and were lower in years where influenza A(H1N1) and B predominated and categorisation by influenza type correctly
sorted winter seasons as having low or high mortality, without requiring additional information (Reichert 2004). The precise number
of deaths due to influenza cannot be known from these data and statistical methods.
iv) A review of studies that used large databases to estimate mortality due to influenza identified four studies, which analysed
the data with several statistical models: Poisson and ARIMA models produced higher mortality estimates than Serfling, and Serfling
higher than GLM. It is unknown which model is more accurate (Thomas 2014b).

 Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for people aged 60 or older living in long-
term care, 24 February 2016
Summary
Dear Thomas et al,
Working with colleagues from PHE England we have just conducted an appraisal of all systematic reviews relevant to vaccinating
healthcare workers in the UK. The rationale for this analysis was ongoing uncertainty among healthcare workers about the rational and
evidence base for the current policy.
We included nine systematic reviews, including the Cochrane review ‘Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for people
aged 60 or older living in long-term care institutions’.
We are concerned by the decision of the authors of the current Cochrane review to exclude two outcomes included in previous versions
of their review, and disagree with the rationale they presented. The fact that these were the only two outcomes presenting statistically
significant and clinically important results leaves the authors open to criticisms of academic bias.
While we accept that the outcomes ‘clinically suspected influenza’ and ‘all-cause mortality’ are less specific than ‘proven influenza’
and ‘influenza-related mortality’, there are good reasons for trial authors to choose these outcomes as they are easier to measure, and
exclusion of this data from the review is unhelpful to policy makers and healthcare workers.
Policy makers using Cochrane reviews, require a transparent summary of the evidence for all policy relevant outcomes accompanied
by an appraisal of the quality of that evidence. We believe that decisions about the relative importance of different outcomes, or the
validity of different effects, should not be made by authors, whose job it is to summarise the available evidence, and then use formal
processes such as GRADE to assess the certainty around the estimates.
Rather than adding clarity and transparency to the situation, we think that this decision by the Cochrane authors has added further
confusion, and it would help policy makers to include these outcomes in the review.
I agree with the conflict of interest statement below:
I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of
my feedback.

Thank you for your comment. We reached the decision to exclude the non-specific outcomes prior to the last version of the review for
reasons which we summarise here. A review of estimates of influenza-associated mortality in those ≥ 65 in statistical databases found
that: (1) for studies which compared different statistical models “For four studies Poisson and ARIMA models produced higher estimates
than Serfling, and Serfling higher than GLM. Which model is more accurate is unknown.” and (2) concluded that in estimating
mortality from influenza: “Key problems are insufficient testing for influenza, using influenza-like illness, heterogeneity of seasonal and
pandemic influenza, population aging, and incomplete confounder control (co-morbidities, frailty, vaccination history) …” (Thomas
RE, Vaccine 2014;32:6884-6901).
We provide further elaboration on the reasons not to use ILI in Appendix 1 to support our view that ILI is not an acceptable outcome
measure. However, we have decided to reinstate the outcome of mortality since we recognise that decision-makers will be interested to
assess how far this outcome might be affected by vaccines. Since there will be some interest in the outcomes we provide below a table
that reports the previous findings of this review for the outcomes of ILI with the original odds ratios:

Since the first version of this review we have restricted the types of outcome measures to reflect specific effects of the vaccine which has
led us to exclude measures effect relating influenza-like illness. We have described the limitations of ILI-outcomes in Appendix 1.
As a response to the feedback submitted on our review in 2016 we have reinstated the outcome of mortality due to any cause.
We have changed the measures of effect from risk ratios to risk differences because risk differences are easier to interpret than relative
effect measures.
