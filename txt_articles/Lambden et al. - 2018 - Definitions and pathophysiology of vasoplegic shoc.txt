Abstract
Vasoplegia is the syndrome of pathological low systemic vascular resistance, the dominant clinical feature of which
is reduced blood pressure in the presence of a normal or raised cardiac output. The vasoplegic syndrome is
encountered in many clinical scenarios, including septic shock, post-cardiac bypass and after surgery, burns and
trauma, but despite this, uniform clinical definitions are lacking, which renders translational research in this area
challenging. We discuss the role of vasoplegia in these contexts and the criteria that are used to describe it are
discussed. Intrinsic processes which may drive vasoplegia, such as nitric oxide, prostanoids, endothelin-1, hydrogen
sulphide and reactive oxygen species production, are reviewed and potential for therapeutic intervention explored.
Extrinsic drivers, including those mediated by glucocorticoid, catecholamine and vasopressin responsiveness of the
blood vessels, are also discussed. The optimum balance between maintaining adequate systemic vascular resistance
against the potentially deleterious effects of treatment with catecholamines is as yet unclear, but development of
novel vasoactive agents may facilitate greater understanding of the role of the differing pathways in the
development of vasoplegia. In turn, this may provide insights into the best way to care for patients with this
common, multifactorial condition.
Keywords: Vasoplegia, Shock
Background
Vasoplegia is an abnormally low systemic vascular resist-
ance (SVR) that is manifest as profound hypotension or the
requirement for therapies to avoid this, in the presence of a
normal or increased cardiac output (Fig. 1). Physiologically,
a low SVR is defined as a low ratio of difference in blood
pressure between arterial (MAP) and venous pressures
(RAP) to the cardiac output [SVR = (MAP − RAP)/CO].
Clinically, vasoplegia is often recognised in the absence of
such comprehensive haemodynamic data. The causes of
vasoplegia are diverse, and several definitions have been de-
scribed for specific causes; similarly, related terminologies
are variably used. The absence of consensus clinically based
definitions of vasoplegia impede progress in understanding
the pathophysiology of vasoplegia; this is particularly true
when considering the similarities between vasodilatory
shock due to sterile or non-sterile causes—for example
hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation in early
burns injury versus early sepsis.
Patients

hospitals
most
commonly
experience
hypotension due to vasodilatation because of the admin-
istration of general or neuraxial anaesthesia, and even
when transient this has been associated with adverse
outcomes [1–3]; however, further discussion is beyond
the scope of this review. Similarly, hypotension due to
vasodilatation resulting from neurogenic shock has a
discrete pathophysiology (loss of sympathetic innervation
due to spinal cord injury) and is not considered further.
This review focuses on the causes of vasoplegia that reflect
a varied response to pathogen-associated molecular pat-
terns (PAMPS) and damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPS) (Fig. 2). The response to these stimuli generates
a combination of vasodilatation and increased capillary
permeability. Capillary leak, coupled with greater vessel
capacitance mediated by vasoplegia may result in absolute,
or more commonly relative, hypovolemia. Fluid resuscita-
tion to treat this phenomenon is a standard of care, but

 this does not treat the underlying pathology and positive
fluid balance is associated with harm [4].
It is uncertain if it is justifiable to consider vasoplegia
to be a pathophysiologically distinct entity representing
uncontrolled failure of vascular homeostasis or to repre-
sent the end of a spectrum of vasodilatation.
Vasoplegic shock (VS), synonymous with distributive
shock, is a more significant circulatory perturbation that is
best described as vasoplegia with evidence of tissue hypo-
perfusion which may be accompanied with hyperlactatae-
mia [5]. The presence of a raised lactate portends a
particularly grave prognosis in the presence of shock or
indeed septic shock [6, 7]. This review describes the key
mechanisms involved in the development of VS, a process
that is mediated by a diverse set of pathways which com-
bine and contribute to the evolution of the shock state.
Advancing our understanding of these pathways and their
role in the transition from adaptive physiological to
maladaptive pathological response may provide novel
diagnostic tools, prognostic insights and therapeutic tar-
gets to guide the management of vasoplegia.
To date, our treatment options are limited and do not tar-
get some of the main pathophysiological pathways. First-line
vasopressor therapy is typically with catecholamines and
resistance
is
referred
to
as
catecholamine-resistant
hypotension (CRH). Although vasopressor infusion is re-
quired in order to maintain an adequate MAP
, significant
variation remains in clinical practice, particularly with regard
to personalised targets depending on premorbid characteris-
tics, and current research efforts are addressing this issue [8].
Moreover, it is well recognised that infused catecholamines
are associated with a range of adverse effects on the meta-
bolic, immune and coagulation systems [9, 10].
The tools available to clinicians to monitor the severity
and impact of vasoplegia are limited [11, 12] and existing
treatment goals may not result in the desired tissue level ef-
fects on microvascular flow [13]. Improved understanding
of the pathophysiology of vasoplegia combined with new
tools to monitor the impact of interventions on vessel func-
tion may lead to the development of the next generation of
vasoactive therapies. The measurement of cardiac output,
systemic blood pressure and central venous pressure allow
derivation of the SVR, although targeting ‘normal’ values
with insufficient consideration of their components may be
hazardous [13].
Causes of vasoplegia
Sepsis
The commonest cause of vasoplegia in critical care is
sepsis. The incidence is dependent upon the definition
used and the patient population under consideration
[14]. Receipt of vasopressors, where appropriate, is now
recognised as a cardinal feature of septic shock and in-
deed the most recent definition of septic shock does not
require the presence of persistent hypotension. However,
it includes administration of vasopressors to maintain a
mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg (in the ab-
sence of hypovolaemia) and an elevated blood lactate
level [15] in the presence of sepsis. This contrasts with
earlier
definitions

 reflected by a low MAP (< 60 mmHg) in the absence of
hypovolaemia and other cause of hypotension [16].
Cardiac surgery
Vasoplegia and VS occurring in patients following cardiac
surgery are the second commonest cause. Diagnosis is more
complex as there is an ever-present risk of impaired cardiac
output contributing to hypotension, the cause of which must
be ascertained early—differentiating between reduced pre-
load from bleeding, impaired myocardial contractility or the
occurrence of cardiac tamponade. The second main compli-
cating factor is the frequent use of vasodilatory inotropes that
directly influence vascular tone. Therefore, although no con-
sensus definition exists, there are several working definitions
that combine i) hypotension in the absence of a low cardiac
output state and ii) absence of infection; additional criteria
may also include the absence of vasodilatory inotropes such
as dobutamine or milrinone, or presence of evidence of tis-
sue hypoperfusion. Clinical factors that predispose to the
development of vasoplegia following cardiac surgery have
been described [17–19] and various treatment regimens
considered, including the use of alternative vasoconstrictors
[20–22]. Although vasoplegia following cardiac surgery is
often attributed to exposure to an extracorporeal circuit the
evidence in support of this remains mixed [23].
Non-cardiac surgery
Hypotension due to vasodilatation in patients following
major non-cardiac surgery is usually manifest as require-
ment for vasopressors to maintain an adequate MAP follow-
ing appropriate resuscitation to restore euvolaemia, and its
incidence is seldom reported. Reported risk factors include
prolonged surgery and significant requirement for blood
transfusion [24, 25]. Where postoperative admission to a
critical care environment is routine, the use of vasopressors
in the postoperative period to support blood pressure
following optimisation of fluid status is commonplace. Al-
though vasopressors may be required to counteract the sys-
temic vasodilatory effects of neuraxial blockade, such as
epidural analgesia, where requirements are significant in an
adequately resuscitated patient then this should be consid-
ered to be vasoplegia.
Burns, trauma and pancreatitis
These are conditions united by significant tissue injury,
with consequent hypermetabolism, systemic inflamma-
tion and predisposition to developing organ dysfunction.
Vasoplegia could be considered to be one such organ
dysfunction, and is a recognised complication of poly-
trauma, burns [26–28] and, even in the absence of infec-
tion, severe pancreatitis—where vasoplegia is associated
with adverse outcome [29, 30].
The pathophysiology of vasoplegia
Normal physiology
SVR is determined by changes in arteriolar diameter, con-
trolled by the contractile activity of the vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMC) in the tunica media. The contractile
state of the VSMC is referred to as the vascular ‘tone’ and is
regulated through intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentra-
tion. VSMC contraction is driven by a rise in cytosolic Ca2+
concentration through release of stored Ca2+ from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum as well as extracellular Ca2+ influx
through voltage-sensitive channels. Relaxation of the VSMC
is driven by a fall in cytosolic Ca2+, due to uptake of Ca2+
by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and expulsion of potassium
(K+) or Ca2+ (via K+ channels and Ca2+-ATPase pumps)
into the extracellular space, resulting in cellular hyperpolar-
isation
and
vasodilation.
Vascular
tone
is
therefore
dependent on the rate of Ca2+ influx versus removal, which
in turn is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms
[31]. Intrinsic regulators include:
i.
endothelial secretions (nitric oxide, prostacyclin,
endothelin)
ii. vasoactive metabolites (acidosis, hypoxia, hydrogen
peroxide)
iii. autacoids (serotonin, prostaglandins, thromboxane A2)
Extrinsic regulation is largely mediated by sympathetic
neural control and vasoactive hormones, which include
adrenaline, angiotensin II and vasopressin.
The pathophysiology of vasoplegia: intrinsic regulators
Nitric oxide
Nitric oxide (NO), first identified as the endothelial-derived
relaxing factor (EDRF) [32], is a critical regulator of vascu-
lar function in both health and disease. NO diffuses freely
from the endothelium into the neighbouring VSMC and
bloodstream causing vasodilation, inhibition of VSMC pro-
liferation, platelet activation and leukocyte adhesion. It
is generated from L-arginine by endothelial nitric oxide
synthase [33], and to a lesser extent neuronal nitric
oxide synthase [34] (eNOS and nNOS, respectively).
These calcium-dependent constitutive isoforms pro-
duce NO in picomolar concentrations and this induces
cGMP-PKG-mediated vasodilation [35–37]. Inflamma-
tory autacoids, including bradykinin and thrombin, in-
crease NO production and vasodilation by activating
eNOS. In addition, inflammatory cytokines and PAMPs
such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce the synthesis
of the third calcium-independent, inducible NOS iso-
form (iNOS). This results in an increase in NO of two
to three orders of magnitude above baseline and is a
major driver of acute vascular dysfunction in shock
[38]. Administration of non-selective inhibitors of NOS
has been shown to be associated with improvement in

 haemodynamics in patients with septic shock but also,
despite this, increased mortality—probably through the
impact of NOS inhibition on immune cell and cardiac
NO production [39, 40]. Therapies that target the vas-
culature and regulate, but not entirely abolish, the in-
crease in NO synthesis may offer a more favourable
profile to those previously tested to-date in clinical
trials [41].
Prostanoids
Prostacyclin (PGI2) is produced by the endothelium consti-
tutively and causes platelet aggregation [42] and induces
cAMP-PKA-mediated vasodilation [43, 44]. Prostacyclin
production is greatly increased in inflammation and contrib-
utes to vasodilation. A broad range of inflammatory
stressors and/or PAMPs, including interleukin 1(IL-1),
tumour necrosis factor α (TNF- α), hypoxia and LPS, pro-
voke the induction of COX-2 isoform and increased synthe-
sis of PGI2 by prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) [45–47], which
drives vasoplegia. Therapeutic trials of nonselective COX in-
hibition in sepsis proved inconclusive, with any beneficial ef-
fects on the degree of vasoplegia mediated by PGI2 likely
offset by other prostaglandin-mediated actions [48].
A short lived prostainoid, thromboxane A2 (TXA2)
opposes the actions of PGI2 and promotes vasoconstric-
tion and platelet aggregation [49]. Therefore TXA2 has
been implicated as a potential causative factor in the in-
creased risk of cardiac ischaemia in patients taking
COX2 inhibitors [50]. TXA2 regulates vascular tone
through binding to thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) recep-
tors in vascular smooth muscle and, in keeping with
other agents, promotes calcium influx and vascocon-
striction [51]. Animal studies have suggested that knock-
out of the TP receptor is associated with reduced iNOS
expression and protection against vascular hyporespon-
siveness, suggesting a role for TXA2 as a regulator of
vasoplegia [52, 53]. In humans, limited evidence suggests
that the balance between TXA2 and PGI2 may be im-
portant with high relative levels of TXA2 associated with
worse outcome in a preliminary study of patients with
sepsis [54].
Endothelin 1
Endothelin 1 (ET1) is the predominant isoform of the
endothelin family and is a small peptide which acts as a
vasoconstrictor [55]. ET1 activates endothelin A (ETA) re-
ceptors in the VSMC, which again drive the elevation of
intracellular Ca2+ and contraction [56]. Subtypes of
endothelin B (ETB) receptors, found in the endothelium
and vascular smooth muscle, act as an autoregulatory
mechanism for controlling basal tone through vasodilata-
tion and smooth muscle contraction [57]. In conditions of
inflammatory stress, however, ET1 has potentially deleteri-
ous effects through the activation of a number of
signalling pathways, increasing synthesis of IL-1, TNF-a
and IL-6 [58]. Selective and non-selective blockade of the
ET receptor subtypes have been shown to have promise in
a range of animal models [59].
Oxygen free radicals
Uncoupling of endothelial NOS enzymes may cause an in-
crease in reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dys-
function [33]. The superoxide anion may reduce NO to
form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which acts as a powerful
oxidising agent that provokes cellular dysfunction and
vasoplegia [60]. Under physiological conditions, the super-
oxide radical anion is metabolised by superoxide dismut-
ase (SOD). Non-enzymatic mechanisms for superoxide
metabolism are mediated by ascorbic acid and uric acid.
In shock states, excess NO production results in excess
ONOO− production, which may be attenuated by antioxi-
dants [61], and reactive oxygen species (ROS) may also
cause the deactivation of catecholamines, a phenomenon
that can be reversed by the administration of a synthetic
mimic of superoxide dismutase [62].
Hydrogen sulphide
Hydrogen
sulphide
(H2S)
is
synthesised
from
the
amino acid L-cysteine through vitamin B6-dependent
cystathionine-β-synthase or cystathionine-γ-lyase [63].
H2S readily diffuses into the vascular smooth muscle
and at low concentrations may have cytoprotective
effects, although in sepsis concentrations are signifi-
cantly elevated [64]. At higher concentrations, H2S
contributes to the development of vasodilatory shock
through a range of oxygen-dependent actions, including
inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase with impairment of
mitochondrial function, activation of potassium ATP
channels and inhibition of endothelial angiotensin con-
verting enzyme activity [63, 65–67]. In addition, H2S inter-
acts with NO, which may attenuate NO actions [68, 69].
H2S has also been suggested as a potential therapeutic
agent leading to the development of a cytoprotective
hibernation-like state. Animals treated with H2S are pro-
tected from both lethal hypoxia [70] and haemorrhage
[71]. This finding has led to the pre-clinical study of H2S
treatment
in
modulating
the
deleterious
effects
of
ischaemia-reperfusion injury in experimental models, in-
cluding porcine myocardial injury [72].
Non-endothelial: potassium channel hyperpolarisation
As indicated, efflux of potassium through ATP-sensitive po-
tassium channels is an important mechanism for the regu-
lation of VSMC membrane potential. Over-activation of
potassium channels results in hyperpolarization of the cell,
with resulting inactivation of voltage-gated calcium chan-
nels. The subsequent vasodilatation is an important driver
of vascular dysfunction. In addition to endothelial-derived
Lambden et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:174 
Page 4 of 8
 mediators, a number of circulating factors can drive potas-
sium channel-mediated vascular dysfunction, including
hypoxia [73], reduced pH [74] and increased circulating lac-
tate [75]. The vascular dysfunction induced by inflamma-
tory stress such as endotoxin [76] led to the hypothesis that
inhibition of potassium channels may offer a novel thera-
peutic strategy. Animal models showed haemodynamic
improvements
following
inhibition
with
the
specific
ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide
[77]. However, phase 2 randomised controlled trials in hu-
man subjects demonstrated no benefit [78], and concerns
regarding non-vascular effects limit its potential utility [79].
The pathophysiology of vasoplegia: extrinsic regulators
Catecholamine resistance
The development of vasoplegia may also be driven by
changes in the efficacy of circulating catecholamines in
generating VSMC contraction. Animal models suggest
that in later stages of sepsis, alpha-1 adrenoceptor
expression falls, resulting in peripheral resistance to nor-
epinephrine [80, 81]. In human studies, the expression
of peripheral receptors appears to be related to illness
severity, with increased expression in mild disease and
reduced expression observed in severe sepsis, suggesting
that in patients with vasoplegia, a similar pattern to that
observed in rodent models may occur [82].
Fig. 3 Endothelial and smooth muscle-mediated mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in shock. Hormonal and mechanical factors drive endothelial cell
activation in the vasculature. Increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generates increased production of nitric oxide
(NO) from arginine. NO directly reduces vascular tone through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, which catalyses the conversion of GTP to cyclic
GMP. In addition, NO combines with oxygen free radicals (O2
−) produced by dyfunctional mitochondria and a number of enzymes, including endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), NADPH and xanthine oxidase. The synthesised peroxynitrite also directly contributes to smooth muscle relaxation. Hydrogen
sulphide (H2S) is synthesised from L-cysteine by cystathionine-β-synthase or cystathionine-γ-lyase (CBL). In shock, H2S reduces vascular tone through
inhibition of mitochondrial function and activation of potassium channels. Arachidonic acid is converted to vasoactive prostaglandins via a two-step
pathway involving cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms and prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), which synthesises prostacyclin (PGI2). This in turn drives vasodilatation
via the activation of stimulatory G-protein-coupled receptors (Gs), which promotes synthesis of cyclic AMP (AMP) from ATP by adenylate cyclase (AC).
Thrombxane A2 (TXA2) is synthesised from the common intermediate PGH2 and plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone in shock states. In the
smooth muscle, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by a number of routes drives smooth muscle relaxation through potassium channel- and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-mediated hyperpolarization and activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Glucogorticoids (G) activate glucocorticoid receptors (GR)
through both classic and non-classic mechanisms to regulate vascular tone, a process that is impaired in a number of ways in shock. Changes in
expression of adrenergic (α1) and vasopressin (VR) receptors and their circulating agonists impair the function of vascular smooth muscle in shock states

Page 5 of 8
 Corticosteroid response
Glucocorticoids drive diverse tissue responses in inflam-
mation, including circulating immune cell function and
cytokine release [83]. These processes are driven by
regulation of a number of intermediate pathways, in-
cluding inducible NOS-mediated NO synthesis and
COX2 activity [84]. In the vasculature, steroid receptors
are present in both endothelial and vascular smooth
muscle and, under physiological conditions, potentiate
the response to circulating catecholamines and angioten-
sin II [85, 86]. In addition, the rapid cellular actions of
steroids can promote increased concentrations of second
messengers such as inositol-3-phosphate and cAMP
[87, 88]. Limited evidence suggests that critical illness-related
corticosteroid insufficiency may develop in shock states.
Causes of this insufficiency include relative insufficiency of
the HPA axis [89], adrenal failure [90] or necrosis [91], and
in some cases peripheral resistance to corticosteroids [90].
These factors may combine to exacerbate vascular dysfunc-
tion in shock and provide a mechanism for the proposed
benefit of exogenous steroid administration to reduce the se-
verity or duration of vasopressor dependence in septic shock
[92–94].
Endogenous vasopressin
Vasopressin acts via specific V1 receptors on the VSMC
surface to promote increased intracellular calcium via G
protein-coupled receptors and phospholipase C, which
in turn drives contraction. In septic shock, plasma con-
centrations of vasopressin increase in the early stages of
shock; however, after 24 h levels fall to sub-normal
levels, which may be a mechanism for loss of vascular
tone [95]. This may be associated with a reduction in
peripheral receptor numbers, a phenomenon observed
in animal models [81]. In addition, V2 receptors on
endothelial cells may provoke vasodilatation via the
increased synthesis of NO [96].
Conclusions
Although vasoplegia is a well-recognised phenomenon, it
still suffers from the lack of a unifying clinical definition.
This prevents clinical trialists and translational scientists
from sharing the common language necessary to facilitate
research and increase understanding of this phenomenon.
Certainly, we believe that a uniform approach to describing
vasoplegia would reap benefits and stimulate further inves-
tigation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
Vasoplegia is a complex phenomenon centred around vas-
cular reactivity with multiple contributory potential mecha-
nisms (outlined in Fig. 3). The advent of further alternatives
to catecholamines, such as angiotensin II [97], may herald a
new approach to treatment and the potential for alternative
approaches—for further details, the reader is invited to con-
sult the treatment article published in the same series.
Optimum targets for systemic blood pressure remain con-
tentious, and increasingly and appropriately, the pharmaco-
logical agents used to achieve these goals will be more
closely scrutinised.
