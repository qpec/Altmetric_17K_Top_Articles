BACKGROUND
Small lifestyle-intervention studies suggest that modest weight loss increases the chance 
of conception and may improve perinatal outcomes, but large randomized, controlled 
trials are lacking.
METHODS
We randomly assigned infertile women with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters) of 29 or higher to a 6-month lifestyle in-
tervention preceding treatment for infertility or to prompt treatment for infertility. The 
primary outcome was the vaginal birth of a healthy singleton at term within 24 months 
after randomization.
RESULTS
We assigned women who did not conceive naturally to one of two treatment strategies: 
290 women were assigned to a 6-month lifestyle-intervention program preceding 18 
months of infertility treatment (intervention group) and 287 were assigned to prompt 
infertility treatment for 24 months (control group). A total of 3 women withdrew con-
sent, so 289 women in the intervention group and 285 women in the control group were 
included in the analysis. The discontinuation rate in the intervention group was 21.8%. 
In intention-to-treat analyses, the mean weight loss was 4.4 kg in the intervention group 
and 1.1 kg in the control group (P<0.001). The primary outcome occurred in 27.1% of 
the women in the intervention group and 35.2% of those in the control group (rate ratio 
in the intervention group, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS
In obese infertile women, a lifestyle intervention preceding infertility treatment, as com-
pared with prompt infertility treatment, did not result in higher rates of a vaginal birth 
of a healthy singleton at term within 24 months after randomization. (Funded by the

Lifestyle Program in Obese Infertile Women
O
besity is a major public health 
problem.1 In most developed countries, 
14 to 20% of women of reproductive age 
are obese (body-mass index [BMI; the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in 
meters], ≥30), whereas in some countries, the 
prevalence of obesity is as high as 60%.1
Obesity negatively affects female reproductive 
health because it is associated with increased 
risks of menstrual dysfunction, anovulation, and 
infertility.2-4 Success rates with ovulation induc-
tion and assisted reproductive techniques are 
lower among obese infertile women than among 
normal-weight women.5,6 The risks of miscar-
riage,6,7 gestational diabetes, hypertensive disor-
ders, preterm birth, and cesarean section are 
higher among obese pregnant women than 
among those who are not obese. Risks of shoul-
der dystocia and infants with macrosomia are also 
higher among obese pregnant women,8-10 and 
risks of congenital anomalies and perinatal 
and infant death are also increased.11,12
Various guidelines have advocated lifestyle-
intervention programs aiming at weight loss of 
5 to 10% of body weight as the first step in car-
ing for obese infertile women.13,14 However, large 
randomized, controlled trials assessing the ef-
fectiveness of lifestyle-intervention programs to 
support these guidelines are lacking. We there-
fore performed a multicenter randomized trial 
involving obese infertile women to assess the 
effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention preceding 
infertility treatment.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We conducted a multicenter randomized trial at 
six university medical centers and 17 general 
hospitals in the Netherlands. The trial protocol 
(available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org) was approved by the medical ethics 
committee of the University Medical Center 
Groningen and the board of directors at each 
participating center. The last author assumes 
responsibility for the completeness and accuracy 
of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol. The protocol was pub-
lished previously.15
Participants
Infertile women between 18 and 39 years of age 
with a BMI of 29 or higher were eligible to par-
ticipate in the trial. Women were considered to 
be infertile if they had chronic anovulation 
(oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and low levels 
of gonadotropins and low or undetectable levels 
of estrogen [World Health Organization (WHO) 
class I anovulation] or oligomenorrhea or amen-
orrhea and serum follicle-stimulating hormone 
and estradiol levels within the normal range 
[WHO class II anovulation])16 or if they had an 
ovulatory cycle and had unsuccessfully tried to 
conceive for at least 12 months. Women with 
severe endometriosis, premature ovarian failure, 
or endocrinopathy (e.g., women with type 1 dia-
betes or Cushing’s syndrome) and those who 
were eligible for donor insemination because of 
azoospermia were excluded, as were women with 
untreated preexisting hypertension and those 
with hypertension-related complications in a pre-
vious pregnancy.17
After they provided written informed consent, 
women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
one of two treatment strategies: a 6-month life-
style intervention preceding 18 months of infer-
tility treatment (intervention group) or prompt 
infertility treatment for 24 months (control 
group). Randomization was performed online 
and was stratified according to trial center and 
ovulatory status. The appropriate infertility treat-
ment was determined and recorded before ran-
domization, since blinding of the treatment as-
signments was not possible.
Lifestyle Intervention
The lifestyle intervention consisted of a 6-month 
structured program with the goal of the loss of 
5 to 10% of the woman’s body weight at ran-
domization.18-21 The program was developed ac-
cording to the recommendations of the National 
Institutes of Health22 and was piloted in a single-
center study.23,24 It included six outpatient visits 
and four telephone consultations during a 24-
week period.
Participants were guided by intervention 
coaches who had a degree in nursing or by dieti-
tians who were trained before the trial. The in-
tervention coaches were supervised on site by 
one trained nurse, had yearly group training 
sessions, and used a standardized computerized 
system to minimize practice variation among 
coaches. Information that included body weight, 
menstrual dates, and calorie intake was cap-
tured in this system by the coaches.25 Women 
were advised to reduce their energy intake by

600 kcal daily with the assistance of an online 
diet diary26 while maintaining a minimum ca-
loric intake of 1200 kcal per day. They were also 
advised to engage in moderate-intensity physical 
activity, with a target level of 10,000 steps per 
day (monitored by a step counter), and at least 
30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise two or 
three times per week.27 The coaches also pro-
vided motivational counseling to promote aware-
ness of a healthy lifestyle and formulate indi-
vidualized goals.
Women discontinued the intervention if an 
ongoing pregnancy was achieved, and if a preg-
nancy ended in a miscarriage, they were allowed 
to resume the intervention. After women com-
pleted the intervention, infertility treatment was 
initiated according to the Dutch infertility guide-
lines,28 irrespective of their BMI. To enhance 
adherence to the intervention, women who lost 
5 to 10% of their initial weight or reached a BMI 
below 29 in the first 6 months after random-
ization could proceed with their indicated in-
fertility treatment before the intervention was 
finished. Women who missed two or more con-
secutive sessions were considered to have not 
completed the intervention and received treat-
ment according to local protocols. Local proto-
cols were based on Dutch infertility guidelines,28 
but they differed among infertility clinics; some 
centers required a BMI below a certain level 
(ranging from 30 to 40), whereas other centers 
treated obese women irrespective of their BMI.
Participants were informed in advance that 
they would not automatically receive infertility 
treatment if they did not complete the interven-
tion. The follow-up of all women who were 
randomly assigned to the intervention group 
(including those who did not complete the inter-
vention) continued until 24 months after ran-
domization.
Control Strategy
Women who were assigned to the control group 
received prompt treatment in accordance with 
Dutch infertility guidelines, irrespective of their 
BMI.28 Treatment of women with anovulatory 
infertility began with ovulation induction, and 
clomiphene citrate was generally administered 
first.29 The initial dose of clomiphene citrate was 
50 mg per day orally, typically for 5 days, start-
ing on the second to the fifth day after the onset 
of natural or progestin-induced menses. If preg-
nancy did not occur in 6 to 12 cycles or if clomi-
phene resistance developed (i.e., ovulation was 
not induced after the dose was increased to the 
maximum dose of 150 mg per day), gonadotro-
pin therapy was initiated in a low-dose step-up 
regimen (starting with 75 IU per day) for a 
maximum of 12 cycles.29
In women who ovulated, treatment depended 
on the estimated probability of natural concep-
tion in the next 12 months according to the 
Hunault prediction model.30 If this probability 
was estimated to be less than 30%, women could 
undergo up to six cycles of intrauterine insemi-
nation with or without ovulation induction.
In vitro fertilization (IVF) was initiated in 
women with tubal disease or after intrauterine 
insemination cycles failed. Intracytoplasmic 
sperm injection (ICSI) was used in couples with 
severe male-factor infertility (total motile sperm 
count, <1 million sperm per milliliter or <3 mil-
lion sperm per milliliter in women in whom 
intrauterine insemination failed).28
Couples with a good prognosis for natural 
conception (i.e., ≥30% in the next 12 months)30 
received expectant care for 6 to 12 months. In-
fertility treatment was continued until couples 
declined further treatment or until further treat-
ment was considered to be ineffective.
During the 24 months after randomization, 
research nurses recorded data on infertility 
treatments (e.g., the types of treatment, number 
of cycles, and types and doses of medication) 
and reproductive outcomes (including the course 
and outcomes of pregnancies and complica-
tions) in a Web-based digital case-record form. 
If needed, the general practitioner was contacted 
to obtain missing information on primary and 
secondary outcomes. If a woman conceived with-
in 24 months after randomization but the preg-
nancy ended thereafter, monitoring was contin-
ued until the pregnancy ended. These pregnancies 
were not included in the analysis of the primary 
outcome.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the vaginal birth of a 
healthy singleton at 37 weeks or more within 24 
months after randomization. A child was con-
sidered to be healthy if he or she was born alive 
without major congenital anomalies.31,32
Prespecified secondary outcomes included a 
change in the woman’s weight, waist circumfer-
ence, and blood pressure (measured manually or 
electronically while she was in a sitting position)

The Hunault prognostic score is based on a model assessing the chance of spontaneous pregnancy in infertile couples with unexplained 
 
infertility or mild male-factor infertility. Factors in the model are the woman’s age, the duration of infertility, primary or secondary infertility, 
sperm motility, and the referral status (secondary or tertiary care) of the couple. Scores range from 7 to 73%, with higher scores indicating 
a better chance of natural conception within the next year.30

such as torsion, bleeding, or infection after fol-
licle aspiration), gestational diabetes,33 and hyper-
tension disorders during pregnancy (gestational 
hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and 
the HELLP syndrome, which is characterized by 
hemolysis, elevated liver-enzyme levels, and a low 
platelet count17).
The secondary outcome of stillbirth was sub-
divided into antepartum and intrapartum still-
birth12 after a gestational age of 16 weeks.12 Re-
lated secondary outcomes were the gestational 
age at delivery, preterm birth (birth before 37 
weeks), method of delivery (spontaneous or as-
sisted vaginal birth or emergency or elective 
cesarean section), and the duration of labor.
Adverse outcomes in women included post-
partum hemorrhage (≥1000-ml blood loss). Ad-
verse neonatal outcomes included neonatal 
death,12 shoulder dystocia, a 5-minute Apgar 
score below 7, an arterial pH of less than 7.05, 
admission to and the duration of stay in a neo-
natal intensive care unit, and small-for-gesta-
tional-age or large-for-gestational-age status, 
which was defined as a birth weight below the 
10th percentile or above the 90th percentile, 
respectively (according to the Dutch reference 
curves34), within 24 months after randomiza-
tion. In addition, we assessed the outcomes of 
live birth (independent of gestational age, method 
of delivery, and health of the newborn), time to 
pregnancy, and birth weight within 24 months 
after randomization.
Statistical Analysis
The power calculations were based on an as-
sumption of an increase in the rate of vaginal 
birth of a healthy singleton at term from 45% in 
the control group to 60% in the intervention 
group,3,35,36 a 20% discontinuation rate during 
the lifestyle intervention,37 and a 5% loss to 
follow-up. We calculated that a sample of 285

Lifestyle Program in Obese Infertile Women
women per group would provide the trial with a 
power of 80% at a two-sided alpha level of 5%.
Primary analyses were performed on an inten-
tion-to-treat basis. Differences between groups 
were expressed as relative risks or odds ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals. For continuous 
variables, differences were calculated with the 
use of the Mann–Whitney U test. No adjust-
ments for multiple comparisons were made.
To estimate the time to pregnancy, including 
censoring of data in cases of incomplete follow-
up, the cumulative rate of vaginal births of 
healthy singletons at term and rates of live 
births were compared with the use of Kaplan–
Meier analyses and the log-rank test. Neonatal 
outcomes were compared with the use of multi-
level analysis (generalized estimating equations).
We performed a per-protocol analysis in which 
women who did not complete the intervention 
were excluded from the intervention group. Two 
post hoc subgroup analyses (one that involved 
women with anovulatory infertility and the 
other that involved women with unexplained 
infertility) also were performed. All statistical 
analyses were conducted with the use of SPSS 
software, version 22.0 (IBM).
Results
Between June 9, 2009, and June 22, 2012, we 
identified 822 women who were eligible to par-
ticipate in the trial; 577 of these women pro-
vided written informed consent. A total of 290 
women were randomly assigned to the interven-
tion group and 287 were assigned to the control 
group; 3 women withdrew informed consent, for 
a total of 289 and 285 women, respectively.
Baseline characteristics were similar in the 
two groups (Table 1). A total of 10 women were 
lost to follow-up, so data on 280 women in the 
intervention group and 284 women in the con-
trol group were available for the intention-to-
treat analysis (Fig. 1).
Lifestyle Intervention
A total of 63 women (21.8%) discontinued the 
lifestyle intervention after a median of 2.8 months 
(interquartile range, 14 days to 3.9 months) 
(Fig. 1). The mean (±SD) weight loss after 
6 months was 4.4±5.8 kg in 236 nonpregnant 
women and 1.1±4.3 kg in the 128 women in the 
control group (P<0.001). Among women who 
were randomly assigned to the lifestyle interven-
tion, 89 (37.7%) lost 5% or more of their original 
body weight; none of the women in the control 
group lost 5% or more of their original body 
weight over the first 6 months. The mean weight 
loss in the 186 women who completed the inter-
vention program was 5.3±6.1 kg, and 80 of them 
(43.0%) lost 5% or more of their original body 
weight.
From baseline to 6 months, the change in 
waist circumference was significantly greater in 
women in the intervention group than in women 
in the control group. Changes in blood pressure

did not differ significantly between the groups 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able at NEJM.org).
Pregnancy Outcomes
Within 24 months after randomization, the fre-
quency of vaginal births of healthy singletons at 
term was significantly lower in the intervention 
group than in the control group: 76 (27.1%) ver-
sus 100 (35.2%) (rate ratio in the intervention 
group, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 
to 0.99) (Fig. 2A and Table 2); rates of live births 
within 24 months after randomization followed 
a similar pattern (Fig. 2B and Table 2). Rates of 
ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy were 
not significantly different between the groups. 
After the inclusion of data from pregnancies 
that were conceived within 24 months after ran-
domization but ended following that period, 
there were no significant between-group differ-
ences in the rates of vaginal births of healthy 
singletons at term or in the rates of live births 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The median time to pregnancy resulting in 
the vaginal birth of a healthy singleton at term 
was 7.2 months in the intervention group (inter-
quartile range, 2.6 to 12.0) versus 5.2 months in 
the control group (interquartile range, 2.4 to 10.1; 
P 
= 
0.06) (Fig. 2A). The median times to preg-
nancy resulting in a live birth were 8.8 months 
(interquartile range, 3.5 to 13.2) in the interven-
tion group and 5.2 months (interquartile range, 
2.6 to 9.4) in the control group (P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 2B).
Infertility Treatment
Overall, significantly more women in the inter-
vention group than in the control group had 
ongoing pregnancies that resulted from natural 
conception (Table 3). In the intervention group, 
90% of the women who completed the interven-
tion program, as compared with 87% of the 
women in the control group, received treatment 
according to the Dutch infertility guidelines.
The number of treatment cycles was lower in 
the intervention group than in the control group 
(679 vs. 1067). In the intervention group, women 
who did not complete the intervention program 
had fewer natural conceptions and fewer received 
infertility treatment than those who did com-
plete the program (Tables S3 and S4 and Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Complications and Adverse Events
The frequencies of complications related to preg-
nancy and labor in women and neonates did not 
differ significantly between the groups (Tables 2 
and 3). There were no significant between-group 
differences in neonatal outcomes, mean birth 
weight, or the number of small-for-gestational-
age infants.
Per-Protocol and Post Hoc Analyses
The per-protocol analysis showed no significant 
differences in the rates of the primary outcome 
or in live-birth rates between the groups. The 
rate of natural conception was significantly high-
er and the percentage of women who received

Lifestyle Program in Obese Infertile Women
Discussion
In this multicenter, randomized trial involving 
obese infertile women, a 6-month structured 
lifestyle intervention preceding infertility treat-
ment did not result in higher rates of term births 
of vaginally delivered healthy singletons at 24 
months than rates of these births among women 
who received prompt infertility treatment. The 
rates of pregnancy-related, labor-related, and neo-
natal complications and neonatal outcomes were 
similar in the two groups. The frequency of natu-
ral conception was significantly higher and the 
number of infertility treatments was significantly 
lower in the intervention group than in the con-
trol group. After exclusion of women who did 
not complete the intervention program from the 
intervention group, birth rates and the time to 
pregnancy were similar in the two groups.
We chose the primary outcome to take into 
account the ways in which preconception weight 
loss may be advantageous during pregnancy and 
labor (i.e., reduced risks of pregnancy complica-
tions and cesarean delivery). This choice was in 
line with recent recommendations emphasizing 
that live birth should be the outcome in infertil-
ity trials.38
Limitations of the trial should be noted. For 
one, blinding was not possible. However, we 
specified the type of infertility treatment before 
randomization in order to minimize differences 
in treatment assignments; this led to similar dis-
tributions of infertility treatment in both groups. 
Moreover, bias was unlikely in the assessment of 
the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes.
We compared two treatment strategies of 
equal duration; the 6-month lifestyle interven-
tion was an integrated part of the intervention 
strategy. Since any comparison between the 
groups had to be performed at the same time 
after randomization, women in the intervention 
group were generally able to access infertility 
treatment for only 18 months, as compared with 
24 months in the control group. This led to an 
increased time to pregnancy and to lower birth 
rates within the follow-up period of 24 months. 
However, there were no significant between-
group differences in birth rates after we took 
into account pregnancies that were conceived 
within but ended after the follow-up period.
Only 38% of the participants reached their 
target weight loss of 5 to 10% of the original 
body weight. The discontinuation rate of 22% 
was similar to that in similar intervention pro-
grams involving infertile women.37
A more intensive program or one involving 
better strategies to enhance adherence might 
have resulted in more weight loss, but it is un-
known whether more weight loss would have led 
to a higher birth rate than the rate in our trial.20 
Moreover, excessive weight loss in a short period 
of time was discouraged, since such a reduction 
in weight has been reported to have a negative 
effect on the outcome of assisted reproductive 
technology39 and to be associated with an in-
creased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such 
as low birth weight or miscarriage.40 In conclusion, 
this randomized trial showed that a 6-month 
structured intervention program to facilitate 
weight loss preceding infertility treatment, as 
compared with prompt infertility treatment, did 
not improve rates of vaginal birth of healthy sin-
gletons at term during 24 months of follow-up.
