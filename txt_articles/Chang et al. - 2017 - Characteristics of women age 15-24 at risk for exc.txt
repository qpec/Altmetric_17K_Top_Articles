Abstract
Purpose
Excess weight gain during pregnancy is a serious health concern among young pregnant
women in the US. This study aimed to characterize young women at highest risk for gaining
over the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy.
Methods
Using a database that is representative of births in large U.S. cities, The Fragile Families
and Child Wellbeing Study, we identified mothers of singleton term-infants age 15–24 years
at the time of delivery. Institute of Medicine guidelines were used to categorize each moth-
er’s weight gain as less than, within, or more than recommended during pregnancy. Multino-
mial logistic regression models for weight gain category were performed, controlling for age,
race/ethnicity, federal poverty level (FPL), health status, and prepregnancy BMI.
Results
Among the weighted sample (n = 1,034, N = 181,375), the mean (SD) age was 21 (3) years,
32% were black, 39% were Hispanic, 44% reported income under the Federal Poverty
Level, 45% were overweight or obese before pregnancy, and 55% gained more weight than
recommended during pregnancy. Women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy
were at increased risk for gaining more pregnancy weight than recommended, compared to
normal-weight women (adjusted Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) = 3.82, p = 0.01; RRR = 3.27,
p = 0.03, respectively). Hispanics were less likely than non-Hispanics to gain more weight
than recommended (RRR = 0.39, p = 0.03).

 Conclusions
The majority of mothers ages 15–24 gained excess weight during pregnancy, a strong risk
factor for later obesity. Prepregnancy overweight or obesity and non-Hispanic ethnicity pre-
dicted excess pregnancy weight gain. Interventions and policies should target these high-
risk young women to prevent excess weight gain.
Introduction
Weight gain during pregnancy has lasting health implications for both mothers and infants.
Excessive weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of dangerous complications during
pregnancy, including diabetes, hypertensive disease, fetal growth abnormalities, operative
delivery, and stillbirth, and contributes to the risk of long-term obesity in both mother and
child[1–9]. Inadequate weight gain is associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and fail-
ure to initiate breastfeeding[10]. As a result, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) have called for more effective interventions to
promote healthy weight gain during pregnancy to address this critical public health issue
[9,11].
In the US, less than 40% of women gain within the IOM recommended guidelines, while
nearly 50% gain over the recommended weight during pregnancy[9,10,12–14]. Promoting
healthy pregnancy weight gain among young women is particularly important, as the US has
one of the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy among high-income countries and rising
rates of obesity among women and adolescents[15–17]. Despite recent declines in teen birth in
the US, in 2014, nearly 1 in 15 births in 2014 was to a teenager (age 15–19 years)[18]. As a
result, morbidity related to inappropriate weight gain continues to contribute to poor health
among at-risk young mothers and their children.
Some interventions designed for adult women have been shown to be effective at maintain-
ing healthy weight gain during pregnancy[19–22]. However, few interventions have been
designed specifically for pregnant adolescents or young women. Pregnant adolescents and
young women likely have different needs and preferences than pregnant adults, and as a result,
interventions for this at-risk group should be tailored to their distinct needs and preferences to
be effective. To appropriately tailor interventions, there is a critical need to understand the
characteristics of adolescents and young women who are at greatest risk for inappropriate
weight gain during pregnancy.
Risk factors for inappropriate pregnancy weight gain are known among adults and prepreg-
nancy BMI, age, and race[9,23,24]. However, the effects of sociodemographic factors on inap-
propriate weight gain among pregnant adolescents and young women is unclear. The aim of
this study is to use a large national sample to identify risk factors for inappropriate weight gain
during pregnancy specifically among adolescents and young women.
Materials and methods
The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study follows a cohort of mother and father dyads
and their children born in large US cities between 1998 and 2000 (roughly three-quarters of
dyads are unwed parents). “Fragile families” denotes that these families are at greater risk of
breaking up and living in poverty than more traditional families[25]. National weights make
the data representative of births in the 77 US cities with populations over 200,000[26].

 The study extracted information from medical records about mothers’ pregnancy and
delivery (including prepregnancy BMI), and the mother’s weight gain during pregnancy. Fol-
low-up interviews gathered additional information, including access to and use of healthcare
and childcare services, experiences with local welfare and child support agencies, parental con-
flict and domestic violence, and child health and well-being. Because this data set provides a
unique glimpse into the many factors that may affect weight gain during pregnancy, it has the
potential to be used to create a typology of pregnant adolescents and young women who gain
appropriate weight versus those who do not.
The cohort of interest was pregnant women between the ages of 15 and 24 at time of deliv-
ery to capture adolescents as they transitioned into adulthood[27]. Data was further restricted
to those who had medical record information available and carried singleton pregnancies to
term (37 weeks or later). Mothers were categorized into BMI categories using prepregnancy
height and weight information. Prepregnancy BMI among those who were 18 or older were
categorized using standard cut-offs (<18.5 = underweight, 18.5–25 = normal, 25–30 = over-
weight, 30–40 = obese, 40+ = morbidly obese) and those between the ages of 15–17 were cate-
gorized using age-specific percentiles from the CDC (<5th percentile = underweight, 5th-85th
percentile = normal, 85th-95th = overweight, 95th+ = obese, BMI of 40+ = morbidly obese)
[28,29]. IOM guidelines updated in 2009 for gestational weight gain vary by prepregnancy
BMI: underweight women should gain between 28 and 40 lbs., normal weight between 25 and
35 lbs., overweight between 15 and 25 lbs. and obese and morbidly obese between 11 and 20
lbs.[9]. The guidelines have been shown to be appropriate for both adults and adolescents[12].
These guidelines were used to categorize each mother’s weight gain as less than recommended,
within recommended, or more than recommended during pregnancy.
Factors that contributed to an increased likelihood of gaining more weight than IOM
guidelines recommended were assessed with weight gain category (less than recommended,
within recommended, more than recommended) during pregnancy as the outcome. Bivariate
analyses, Chi-squared tests and ANOVA as appropriate, were performed evaluating factors
potentially associated with pregnancy weight gain including baseline age, socioeconomic status
(SES), race, ethnicity, federal poverty level (FPL), health status, insurance status, marital status,
situational history variables (homelessness, inadequate money, living with biological father),
poor nutrition, alcohol use, tobacco use, other drug use, medical comorbidities, preexisting
medical conditions, time when prenatal care began, and prepregnancy BMI category.
The final adjusted multinomial logistic regression model included factors that were signifi-
cant in the bivariate models or have been shown to be associated with weight gain during preg-
nancy in the IOM’s conceptual framework[9]. These included age, race, ethnicity, SES, current
health and prepregnancy BMI category as covariates. Interactions between covariates, primar-
ily between prepregnancy BMI and age, were also investigated. All analyses were adjusted
using national survey weights with STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
The University of Michigan IRB determined this study to be not regulated.
Results
There were 1,413 mothers between the ages of 15 and 24 in the national sample with available
medical record data. Mothers who carried multiples (n = 20), gave birth prior to 37 weeks
(n = 142) or had unknown gestational age at delivery (n = 3) were excluded from analysis. An
additional 214 mothers were removed due to missing either prepregnancy BMI or weight gain
during pregnancy data, leaving a final unweighted analytic sample size of 1,034.
The average age of the weighted sample was 21 years (SD = 3.0) with roughly equal distribu-
tion across races and a large proportion (39.0%) being Hispanic and falling below the FPL

 (43.9%). Nearly half of mothers had a normal BMI (49.1%), while another quarter (26.3%)
were overweight prior to becoming pregnant (Table 1).
Based on IOM guidelines over half (55.2%) of the weighted sample gained more than rec-
ommended during pregnancy, 27.2% gained within guidelines, and 17.7% gained less than rec-
ommended. Bivariate analysis found prepregnancy BMI to be the only factor significantly
associated with weight gain category (p-value = 0.002), with overweight and obese individuals
having higher probabilities of gaining more than the recommended weight compared with
other categories. (Table 1)
A multinomial logistic regression model including age, race, ethnicity, federal poverty level,
current health and prepregnancy BMI category as covariates did not find any significant asso-
ciations between gaining less than recommended compared to within recommended guide-
lines (Table 2).

 Prepregnancy BMI category (p-value = 0.04) and ethnicity (p-value = 0.03) were signifi-
cantly associated with gaining more than recommended compared to within recommended
guidelines. Overweight and obese individuals had higher likelihoods of gaining more than rec-
ommended, when compared with normal weight individuals (Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) (95%
CI) = 3.82 (1.39, 10.49) and 3.27 (1.15, 9.26), respectively). Hispanics were less likely to gain
over the recommended weight (RRR (95% CI) = 0.39 (0.17, 0.90)) than non-Hispanics. Inter-
actions between prepregnancy BMI category and other covariates including age, race, ethnic-
ity, self-reported health and federal poverty level were not found to be significant.

 The marginal probability of each outcome category was estimated across prepregnancy
BMI categories using the final model (Fig 1). Mothers who were overweight or obese prior to
getting pregnant had substantially higher probabilities of gaining more than the recommended
guidelines, compared to normal-weight women. The other prepregnancy BMI groups showed
no significant difference between probabilities of gaining under, within or over the recom-
mended guidelines.
Discussion
Categorical weight gain was similar in our sample of 15–24 year-old women compared to
cohorts that include older women (under IOM guidelines: 18% vs 21%; within: 27% vs 32%;
over: 55% vs 47%)[30]. Overweight and obese pregnant young women were more likely to
gain excess weight during pregnancy compared to normal weight peers, while Hispanic young
women were less likely than non-Hispanic peers to gain excess weight during pregnancy.
These findings are also consistent with previously reported national and state-level data that
included older adults[9,14,31]. No characteristic was associated with gaining too little weight
compared to gaining within the guidelines.
Though 15 year olds are arguably different than 24 year olds, younger mothers in our sam-
ple did not have a different risk for excess weight gain than older mothers. This finding high-
lights the importance of prepregnancy BMI at any age for predicting weight gain during
pregnancy. Interestingly, Hispanic women in this study were found to be less likely to gain
excess weight. Future studies that aim to understand the reason for this distinction could help
develop interventions among those at elevated risk for excess weight gain. Our findings also
have important implications for the care of pregnant adolescents, young women, and their
children today.
First, BMI is objective data that is readily obtained during usual clinical care and can be eas-
ily used to identify young pregnant women at-risk for gaining excess weight during pregnancy.
There is no need for complicated tests or a prolonged screening process. Based on a Cochrane
Systematic Review, high-quality evidence indicates that diet or exercise, or both, during preg-
nancy can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain in pregnancy[32]. Once at-risk women are
identified, available resources to improve diet and exercise habits can be provided to prevent
long-term morbidity associated with excess weight gain. Next, pregnancy has been shown to
be a time when women are particularly activated and engaged in their health[33,34]. Over-
weight and obese adolescents and young women would likely benefit from support and
resources to achieve healthy diet and exercise habits regardless of pregnancy status. During
pregnancy, young women often have increased number of clinical visits and community sup-
port which can lead to greater opportunities to address these important issues.
In addition to intrauterine changes that may occur with excess weight gain in pregnancy,
poor health habits are often passed on from mothers to their infants[34–36], creating an inter-
generational cycle of poor health among these at-risk families. As a result, accurate informa-
tion, resources and support to achieve healthy weight gain is particularly important for over-
weight and obese pregnant adolescents and young women. Studies have shown that clinicians
may be uncomfortable discussing weight gain with pregnant women[37,38], but that pregnant
women are interested in receiving more information about this topic[39]. Adolescent pregnant
women in particular may have an even higher need for counseling due to the increased preva-
lence of body dissatisfaction among this age group[40]. Interventions and programs must be
designed that take adolescent-specific factors into account.
Finally, obese adolescents have also been found to be significantly less likely to use birth
control compared to normal weight adolescents, despite having similar levels of sexual activity

 [40]. Efforts to provide responsible education and resources to all adolescents to prevent unin-
tended pregnancy can have greater effects beyond contraception; these efforts may also reduce
the risk of long-term morbidity associated with obesity among this at-risk group.
Limitations
Our findings are subject to certain limitations. First, these data are cross-sectional and cannot
be used to infer causation. BMI data was extracted from medical records and may be either
patient self-report or anthropometric measurements. These data were also collected in 1998
and 2000 and may no longer represent epidemiologic patterns seen today. However, our study
uses a nationally representative sample of births among at-risk adolescents and young women,
and includes many social factors that have been hypothesized to be related to weight gain dur-
ing pregnancy. Finally, our sample may not be sufficiently powered to examine interaction
effects as described in our methods, though the results with our current sample (n = 1,034)
found only small effects that did not approach significance.
Conclusion
Prepregnancy BMI and ethnicity are important factors that predict excess pregnancy weight
gain among adolescents and young women age 15–24. Interventions and policies should focus
on high-risk women to prevent excess weight gain-related morbidity among these mothers
and their children.
