IMPORTANCE There is increasing interest in using price transparency tools to decrease
health care spending.
OBJECTIVE To measure the association between offering a health care price transparency
tool and outpatient spending.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two large employers represented in multiple market
areas across the United States offered an online health care price transparency tool to their
employees. One introduced it on April 1, 2011, and the other on January 1, 2012. The tool
provided users information about what they would pay out of pocket for services from
different physicians, hospitals, or other clinical sites. Using a matched difference-in-
differences design, outpatient spending among employees offered the tool (n=148 655) was
compared with that among employees from other companies not offered the tool
(n=295 983) in the year before and after it was introduced.
EXPOSURE Availability of a price transparency tool.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual outpatient spending, outpatient out-of-pocket
spending, use rates of the tool.
RESULTS Mean outpatient spending among employees offered the tool was $2021 in the year
before the tool was introduced and $2233 in the year after. In comparison, among controls,
mean outpatient spending changed from $1985 to $2138. After adjusting for demographic
and health characteristics, being offered the tool was associated with a mean $59 (95% CI,
$25-$93) increase in outpatient spending. Mean outpatient out-of-pocket spending among
those offered the tool was $507 in the year before introduction of the tool and $555 in the
year after. Among the comparison group, mean outpatient out-of-pocket spending changed
from $490 to $520. Being offered the price transparency tool was associated with a mean
$18 (95% CI, $12-$25) increase in out-of-pocket spending after adjusting for relevant factors.
In the first 12 months, 10% of employees who were offered the tool used it at least once.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among employees at 2 large companies, offering a price
transparency tool was not associated with lower health care spending. The tool was used by
only a small percentage of eligible employees.

P
rice transparency tools have increased in popularity
in response to observed price variation across physi-
cians, hospitals, and other clinical sites1-3 and because
patients bear a larger fraction of spending through increased
deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance. More than half
of US states have passed legislation establishing price trans-
parency websites or mandating that health plans, hospitals,
or physicians make price information available to patients.4
Websites have emerged to “crowd source” price information,
and health plans have introduced price transparency tools
for enrollees.5,6 Employers have also contracted with compa-
nies such as Truven Health Analytics and Castlight to pro-
vide their employees with price transparency tools.7
These tools can help patients identify and seek less ex-
pensivecarefromproviderssuchashospitals,physicians,labo-
ratories, imaging centers, and other clinicians. Given the weak
relationship between price and quality,8 it is assumed that pa-
tients can price shop for less expensive health care services
without sacrificing quality.
Despite the enthusiasm for price transparency efforts,
little is known about their association with health care
spending. One study found that users of a price transparency
tool received less expensive laboratory tests, advanced
imaging, and office visits.7 However, these results were lim-
ited to the narrow population that used the tool and a lim-
ited set of health care services. From the perspective of an
employer or health plan that is deciding whether to offer
such a tool, the most relevant question is whether the tool
will reduce aggregate spending across all their employees or
enrollees. To understand the association between price
transparency tool availability and outpatient spending,
this study compared the health care spending patterns of
employees of 2 companies that offered a price transparency
tool with patterns among employees of other companies that
did not offer the tool.
Methods
The objective was to study whether having access to more
price information was associated with reduction in annual
outpatient spending in the first 12 months after introduc-
tion. Outpatient spending was defined as payments to a phy-
sician, hospital, laboratory, imaging center, or other clinician
such as a nurse practitioner or physician assistant (hence-
forth, physicians and other clinicians will be referred to as
clinicians), summing patient out-of-pocket spending and
health plan reimbursement for all outpatient care. Employ-
ees (and their dependents) of 2 large companies that offered
the Truven Treatment Cost Calculator were compared with a
control population who was not offered a price transparency
tool. The Harvard Medical School Human Studies Commit-
tee deemed the study exempt from review.
Price Transparency Tool
The tool provides users with estimated total and out-of-
pocket spending for approximately 330 services including
imaging, outpatient surgeries, and office visits. The website
facilitates price comparison by providing the average price
for the service within the community and clinician-specific
prices. Two features of this price transparency tool address
shortcomings of older tools.3,9 First, to provide accurate real-
time estimates of a user’
s out-of-pocket amount, the tool’
s
results incorporate benefit structure and the user’
s remaining
deductible. Second, search results reflect episode-level prices
rather than single-procedure prices. For example, outpatient
colonoscopy prices include estimates for the clinician per-
forming the procedure, anesthesia, and related laboratory
services. Moreover, price estimates for 8 chronic conditions
(eg, diabetes) reflect recommended, routine care and poten-
tial spending associated with complications over a year.
Overall, the capabilities and implementation strategies
appear similar to other tools currently offered.10 More than 21
million people across the United States have access to this
price transparency tool.11
Study Data
The Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and En-
counters database comprises deidentified health insurance
claims for inpatient care, outpatient care, and prescription
drugs for more than 50 million people from self-insured em-
ployers and health plans. Within these data, markets were de-
fined by metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs); for those who
lived outside an MSA, states served as markets.
The tool’
s web log file contains data on searches for spe-
cific types of care (but does not capture other uses of the web-
site). It identifies time and date of search as well as proce-
dures or conditions searched. For 1 employer that offered the
tool, price results from the search were also available.
Analytic Sample
Intervention Population
The intervention population consisted of employees of 2
companies that offered the price transparency tool and pro-
vided their claims data to MarketScan. Employer A intro-
duced the tool on January 1, 2012. It is located in the west-
ern United States and had 58 271 employees in 6 markets
enrolled in preferred provider organization plans with an
individual deductible up to $500. Employer B introduced
the tool on April 1, 2011. It is a national employer with
90 973 employees in 361 markets across all regions enrolled
in higher cost-sharing plans with individual deductibles
between $500 and $2500 (details on how individuals’
deductibles were determined are available in eAppendix 1 in
the Supplement).
These employers were chosen because they did not
make changes to their deductibles or co-payments in the
year before or after the tool was offered. Additionally, they
had the highest rates of tool utilization. This higher uptake
was attributable to greater promotional efforts, which
included promotion during the open enrollment period and
ongoing promotion such as senior management endorse-
ments, prominent display on the employee web portal, post-
ers, and mailings.
The intervention population comprised employees of-
fered the tool because spending across all employees is

arguably the most important outcome from an employer’

spective,andsuchanintention-to-treatanalysisaddressescon-
founding from unobservable differences between tool users
and nonusers.
To ensure that any observed changes were not due to
changes in employee composition, the intervention popula-
tion was restricted to those continuously enrolled in a single
health plan in the 12 months before and 12 months after in-
troduction of the tool. Employees aged 65 years or older were
excluded to avoid confounding from Medicare coverage.
Control Population
ThecontrolpopulationincludedemployeesinMarketScanwho
werealsocontinuouslyenrolledoverthestudyperiod,matched
to employees in the intervention population using both exact
matching and propensity score matching. Exact matches on
health plan characteristics that may affect the strength of the
association between availability of price transparency and
spending were required: plan type (preferred provider orga-
nization, high-deductible health plan/consumer-directed
health plan) and deductible category (individual annual de-
ductible of $1-$500, $501-$1250, or $1251-$2500). In addi-
tion, matching was done on propensity scores. The propen-
sityscoremodelincludedagecategories,sex,andcomorbidities
in the preintervention year and produced the probability of
each person being offered the price transparency tool. Greedy
nearest neighbor matching with replacement was done to find
potentialcontrolswithasimilarpropensityscore.Matchedpro-
pensity scores were required to be within a caliper of 0.8 SDs.12
Each individual in the intervention group was matched to up
to 2 control individuals.
Matching was done in 2 stages. In the first stage, controls
in the same market were identified (79% of matches). Inter-
vention cohort members who were not matched in this first
stage were matched to those in an “expanded” market. The ex-
panded market consisted of MSAs with per capita outpatient
spendinglevelsinthepreinterventionyearandspendingtrends
for up to 4 years prior to the intervention similar to the treat-
ment group MSAs (details in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
Trends were calculated using all enrollees, not just continu-
ously enrolled individuals.
Becausetheinterventionwasintroducedat2differenttime
points, the study period for each control was aligned with that
of their matched intervention group counterpart.
Analytic Strategy
The association between the availability of a price transpar-
ency tool and health spending using a difference-in-
differences framework was assessed.13 The approach used the
change in intervention group outcomes from the 12 months
before to the 12 months after the introduction of the tool, mi-
nus the corresponding change in the matched controls dur-
ingthesameperiod.ThemodelforthemeanoutcomeQit(such
as spending) for employee i at time t is
E(Qit) = β0 + β1(PTi × postt) + β2PTi + β3(postt × Ai) +
β4(postt × Bi) + γXit
where PTi indicates whether employee i was offered a
price transparency tool, postt indicates a postintervention
time period, Ai indicates being an employee of employer A or
matched control, Bi indicates being an employee of employer
B or matched control, and Xit (age category, sex, comorbidity
indicators) are observable features of the person. Interaction
terms for employer A or B cohort dummies and postt account
for the difference in timing of the intervention. The param-
eter of interest was β1, which estimated the differential pre-
post change in the intervention vs control cohorts. Statistical
tests were 2-sided and were considered statistically signifi-
cant at P<.05. All statistical analyses were completed using
SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
A key assumption of difference-in-differences analyses
is that the trends in outcomes are similar before the inter-
vention. Quarterly outpatient spending trends in the prein-
tervention year are presented in eAppendix 2 in the Supple-
ment. Spending levels were similar between the intervention
and control cohorts, but in the last quarter of the preinter-
vention year, the control cohort’
s spending increased rela-
tively faster.
Outcomes
Spending
The primary outcome was total annual spending for outpa-
tient care. Outpatient care is the focus of the analysis
because it is more suitable to price shopping than inpatient
care, which is often emergent and the price of which almost
invariably exceeds the deductible. A secondary spending
outcome was the patient’
s annual out-of-pocket spending
for outpatient care. Out-of-pocket spending was the sum of
all deductible, co-payment, and co-insurance payments. To
lessen the effect of outliers, outpatient spending and out-of-
pocket outpatient spending were winsorized at the 1% and
99% levels.14
The analyses on these 2 spending outcomes were esti-
mated with a linear regression model. Heteroscedasticity-
consistent standard errors were used to calculate 95% confi-
dence intervals. Because the control cohort could not be
matched to employers, standard errors could not be clus-
tered by employer. In a sensitivity check, the analyses were
repeated using a 2-part model with a first-stage probit on
the probability of nonzero spending and a second-stage pro-
bit on log-transformed spending with a normal distribution
and identity link.
Switching to Lower-Priced Settings
In the data, the facility fees for services such as surgery,
radiology, and laboratory tests performed in a hospital-
based outpatient department (HOPD) were often aggregated
for an entire set of services provided on a given day instead
of being broken down by individual service. This limited
the ability to calculate service-level price. As a proxy for
measuring switching to less expensive clinicians, HOPD
utilization was examined. Prices at HOPDs are typically
much higher than at freestanding facilities for equivalent
services.15 Numerous interventions encourage patients to
save money by switching away from clinicians in HOPDs
to clinicians in freestanding facilities.16,17 Because it was
an intuitive measure of receiving less expensive care, the

number of services that were received in HOPD settings was
used as a proxy.
The number of HOPD visits was modeled using a nega-
tive binomial regression on the subsample of employees who
hadatleast1outpatientserviceinthepreinterventionandpost-
intervention years. To account for differences across employ-
ees in overall outpatient utilization in a given year, the log-
transformed count of total outpatient visits for that employee
was included in the model.
Subgroup Analyses
Given that employees with higher cost sharing may be more
responsive to the price transparency tool, a subgroup analy-
sis of employees with high annual deductibles (>$1250) was
conducted.Also,asubgroupanalysisofthosewithchroniccon-
ditions(CharlsonComorbidityIndexscore>1)wasconducted18
because employees with more health issues may have more
opportunities to shop for health care using a price transpar-
ency tool.
Sensitivity Analyses
To test the robustness of the results, several additional tests
were conducted. First, the analysis was done separately for
employers A and B to test whether results are consistent
across both. Second, to address potential confounding from
selecting matches from other markets, an analysis using
only controls from within the same markets as the interven-
tion cohort was done. Third, for employer B—for which data
were available—a 2-year follow-up analysis was done to
assess the longer-term effects of offering price transparency.
Fourth, as noted above, for the analyses on outpatient
spending and out-of-pocket spending, a 2-part model for
the probability of nonzero spending and the magnitude of
spending conditional on nonzero spending was conducted.
Fifth, the analyses were conducted on the subpopulation of
employees who had used the tool at least once and their
matched controls.
Use of the Price Transparency Tool
Use rates for the price transparency tool and search behav-
ior among the intervention cohort were examined. Employ-
ees were coded as users if they or anyone else in their family
searched the website. All searches for a given service on a
day were counted as a single use. Three measures of price
transparency tool usage were defined: users who searched
at least once, users who searched at least 3 times on differ-
ent days, and users who searched at least twice with a
30-day gap in between. The latter 2 measures identify users
who were more engaged in the tool and used it repeatedly.
Most commonly searched services and price estimates for
employer A, for which such information was available, were
described.
Results
The intervention and control populations included 148 655
and 295 983 individuals, respectively. In the intervention
population, 50% were female, 67% were aged 18 years or
older, 11% had 1 or more chronic illnesses, and 21% had an
annual deductible greater than $1250 (Table 1). Standard-
ized mean differences were 1.5% or less, indicating that the
intervention and control populations were well balanced on
measured characteristics.
Spending
Among the intervention cohort, mean total outpatient spend-
ing increased from $2021 to $2233, while among the control
cohort, mean spending increased from $1985 to $2138. In the
adjusted difference-in-differences analysis, offering a price
transparency tool was associated with higher mean spending
($59; 95% CI, $25-$93). This constitutes a 2.9% increase in
spending from preintervention spending (Table 2).
Mean outpatient out-of-pocket spending in the interven-
tion cohort increased from $507 to $555 compared with $490
to $520 in the control cohort. In the adjusted difference-in-
differences regression, offering a price transparency tool was
associated with higher mean annual out-of-pocket spending
($18; 95% CI, $12-$25; a 3.6% increase from preintervention
spending).
Switching to Lower-Priced Settings
Hospital-based outpatient department services among
those in the intervention group with at least 1 outpatient
visit increased from 1.45 to 1.54 compared with an increase
from 1.98 to 2.00 in the control cohort. In the adjusted
model, offering a price transparency tool was associated
with an increase in the use of HOPD services (0.06 [4.1%];
95% CI, 0.04-0.08).
Subgroup Analyses
In subgroup analyses among employees with a higher annual
deductible (>$1250) and those with more chronic conditions,
there were no statistically significant decreases in overall
spending, out-of-pocket spending, or shift in visits from the
HOPD (Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses
As in the overall analysis, there was no evidence of a statis-
tically significant decrease in outpatient spending, out-of-
pocket outpatient spending, or switching to non-HOPD
settings in either employer separately (eAppendix 4 in the
Supplement). For employer A, there was a non–statistically
significant decrease (−$17; 95% CI, −$71 to $38) in outpa-
tient spending, although results on other outcomes were
consistent with the main results (out-of-pocket spending
increased by $20 [95% CI, $12-$28] and HOPD visits
increased by 0.12 [95% CI, 0.09-0.16]). There was no statis-
tically significant decrease when only controls from within
the same markets as the intervention cohort were used
(eAppendix 5 in the Supplement), when a 2-part model was
specified (eAppendix 6 in the Supplement), or 2 years after
tool introduction for employer B (eAppendix 7 in the
Supplement). Fifth, users of the tool had increased spend-
ing compared with their matched controls ($407; 95% CI,
$301-$541), although, as discussed in eAppendix 8 in the

was driven at least partially by a selection bias.
Use of the Price Transparency Tool
Inthefirst12months,10%ofemployeesinthetreatmentgroup
searched the website for a price estimate at least once, 8%
searched at least 3 times, and 3% searched at least twice with
a 30-day gap in between (Figure). Among employees who
searched at least once, 86% had at least some spending in the
postintervention period. Top searches on the price transpar-
ency website were for obstetric deliveries, colonoscopy, of-
fice visits, and gastric bypass surgery. The majority of searches
(68%) were for services with total price estimates higher than
$500, and 53% of searches had total price estimates higher
than $1250. For employer B, data were available for up to 24
months after offering the tool. By 24 months, 18% of employ-
ees had logged on once and 15% had logged on at least 3 times
(eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).

Discussion
In this analysis, offering a health care services price trans-
parency tool to employees was not associated with lower
outpatient spending. This was also true in subanalyses
focused on employees with higher health plan deductibles
and those with comorbidities at baseline. Furthermore,
those offered the price transparency tool did not shift their
care from higher-priced HOPD settings to lower-priced
ambulatory settings.
A series of factors may underlie the lack of a negative
association between offering the price transparency tool
and outpatient spending. First, despite selecting 2 employ-
ers with the highest uptake and substantial marketing from
the employers, use of the tool was relatively low, with only
10% of employees logging on in the first year of its introduc-
tion. Such low use rates have been reported for other price
transparency tools.7,19-22 Moreover, low utilization is the
most commonly reported challenge to price transparency
initiatives by insurers who offer tools.10 Patients may not
find the information compelling or may simply forget about
the tool if they seek health care infrequently.
Second, there may be limited opportunities for patients
to save money via the tool. Price shopping is most useful for
care that is nonemergent and of lower cost, and there may
be a limited set of services that meet those criteria. A recent
report found that only 40% of spending is attributable to
shoppable services.23 In this study, a substantial fraction of
searches were for services whose prices exceeded the

An employee was coded as a user if he or she or anyone else in the family
searched the website. Three measures of price transparency tool utilization
were defined: users who searched at least once (�1 log-on), users who
searched at least 3 times on different days (�3 log-ons), and users who
searched at least twice (�2 log-ons) with a 30-day gap between searches.

a Analyses of HOPD visits were limited to individuals with at least 1 outpatient
visit in preintervention and postintervention years. The analysis of individuals
with high deductibles included 71 331 individuals. The HOPD analysis of
individuals with CCI scores >1 had 14 783 individuals. All outcomes were
measured annually and per employee. Explanatory variables were age
category, sex, and comorbidity indicators.
bThe CCI is a weighted count of 22 medical diagnoses in the past year.
Diagnoses are given weights of 1, 2, 3, or 6 based on their association with
subsequent 1-year mortality (score range, 0-43).18

employee’
s deductible, so that out-of-pocket amounts
would be the same regardless of which clinician or hos-
pital was chosen. Also, approximately half of employees
met their deductible within the year. After reaching their
deductible, patients may have little incentive to price
shop.20 Third, a common service through which patients
could benefit from price shopping is clinician office
visits. However, many patients have established relation-
ships with their clinicians that they may wish to maintain
regardless of price.
Price transparency could be effective if combined with
health plan benefit designs that create a larger incentive to
receive care from less expensive clinicians. For example,
under reference-based pricing, a patient pays the difference
between the negotiated and reference price (for example,
$30 000 for hip surgery in one program).24 Because pa-
tients are responsible for the “last dollar,” they may be more
cost conscious, even for higher-priced services such as sur-
gery. Bonus programs in which patients receive incentives
if they receive care from less expensive clinicians or facili-
ties may also increase patient interest in price data.25 Proac-
tively contacting patients and providing information about
less expensive care may be more effective than passively
waiting for them to seek this information on their own
via a website.17
Among those offered the tool, a modest but statistically
significant increase ($59 [2.9%]) in outpatient spending was
observed. Offering price transparency could increase spend-
ing if patients equate higher prices with higher quality and
therefore use the tool to selectively choose higher-priced
clinicians. The tool reports both total price and out-of-
pocket amounts, and patients may use total price to identify
higher-priced clinicians when their out-of-pocket price
are the same. However, given the statistically significant
increase in spending was not observed in all subanalyses
and given findings of prior work on price transparency,7 this
is speculative and would need to be confirmed in future
studies. A more conservative interpretation is that the study
failed to find evidence of meaningful savings associated
with availability of a price transparency tool.
This analysis had several limitations. First, it was limited
to 2 employers and a single price transparency tool. Future
work should evaluate other price transparency initiatives.
Second, the analysis focused on the first year after price
transparency was introduced. A 2-year follow-up analysis for
1 employer with available data was done, and results were
qualitatively similar. Third, the outcomes do not capture
other beneficial aspects of a price transparency tool such as
helping patients better estimate the out-of-pocket spending
they will face, track their deductible, or identify which clini-
cians or sites are in the health plan’
s network. Fourth, the
analysis focused on aggregate spending. As seen in prior
work, users of a price transparency tool might save money
for individual services. Aggregate spending, however, is the
outcome we believe to be most relevant to employers or
health plans evaluating whether to offer such a tool, and
reported savings in small subgroups for a few services would
not drive meaningful aggregate savings (consistent with the
main conclusion). Finally, as demonstrated in eAppendix 2 in
the Supplement, before the intervention, the control group’
s
spending grew relatively faster than the intervention group’
s
spending. This difference, had it persisted, would bias the
results toward erroneously finding that the tool reduced
spending. Since the results suggest the opposite, this likely
does not affect the conclusion that the price transparency
tool was not associated with a decrease in spending. How-
ever, it could indicate other unobserved differences between
the intervention and control groups.
Conclusions
Among employees at 2 large companies, offering a price trans-
parency tool was not associated with lower health care spend-
ing. The tool was used by only a small percentage of eligible
employees.
