Abstract
Background: Maternal and paternal depression has been associated with infants’ behavioral sleep problems. Behavioral
sleep interventions, which alter parental cognitions about infant sleep, have improved infant sleep problems. This study
reports relationships between parental depression, fatigue, sleep quality, and cognitions about infant sleep pre and
post-intervention for a behavioral sleep problem.
Methods: This secondary analysis of data from Canadian parents (n = 455), with healthy infants aged 6-to-8-months
exposed to a behavioral sleep intervention, examined baseline data and follow-up data from 18 or 24 weeks post
intervention (group teaching or printed material) exposure. Parents reported on sleep quality, fatigue, depression, and
cognitions about infant sleep. Data were analyzed using Pearson’s r and stepwise regression analysis.
Results: Parents’ fatigue, sleep quality, sleep cognitions, and depression scores were correlated at baseline and follow-up.
At baseline, sleep quality (b = .52, 95% CI .19–.85), fatigue (b = .48, 95% CI .33–.63), doubt about managing infant sleep
(b = .44, 95% CI .19–.69), and anger about infant sleep (b = .69, 95% CI .44–.94) were associated with mothers’ depression.
At baseline, fathers’ depression related to sleep quality (b = .42, 95% CI .01–.83), fatigue (b = .47, 95% CI .32–.63), and doubt
about managing infant sleep (b = .50, 95% CI .24–.76). At follow-up, mothers’ depression was associated with sleep quality
(b = .76, 95% CI .41–1.12), fatigue (b = .25, 95% CI .14–.37), doubt about managing infant sleep (b = .44, 95% CI .16–.73),
sleep anger (b = .31, 95% CI .02–.59), and setting sleep limits (b = −.22, 95% CI -.41-[−.03]). At follow-up, fathers’ depression
related to sleep quality (b = .84, 95% CI .46–1.22), fatigue (b = .31, 95% CI .17–.45), sleep doubt (b = .34, 95% CI .05–.62), and
setting sleep limits (b = .25, 95% CI .01–.49).
Conclusions: Mothers’ and fathers’ cognitions about infant sleep demonstrate complex relationships with their depression
scores. While mothers’ setting sleep limit scores are associated with decreased depression scores, fathers’ setting limits
scores are associated with increased depression scores. Parental doubts about managing infant sleep and difficulties with
setting sleep limits require attention in interventions.

 Background
Parenting is a very complex area, particularly in the context
of
parent-identified
infant behavioral
sleep
problems.
Twenty to 30% of young children have sleep disturbances
[1]. Sleep problems can persist for about 30% of children,
particularly infants [2]. Behavioral sleep problems are evi-
dent when infants’ sleep time is shorter than age-
appropriate norms and infants show evidence of sleep loss
[3]. The presence of a behavioral sleep problem also
depends on whether parents define infants’ sleep as a prob-
lem [1]; parents commonly view frequent infant night wak-
ing with crying beyond 6 months of age as a problem [4].
Maternal stress, depressive symptoms, and poorer self-
reported health [5], and poor paternal general health [6]
and depressive symptoms have been associated with
infants’ behavioral sleep problems [7, 8]. Moreover, in
mothers without a past history of depression, infant
sleep problems have had a greater impact on mothers’
severe psychological distress [6]. Fathers attending a ser-
vice for early parenting difficulties reported higher levels
of distress when children had more severe sleep prob-
lems [9]. Children’s sleep problems persisting from
infancy or recurring in preschoolers have been associ-
ated with higher maternal depression scores [10].
For parents, fatigue, sleep quality, and psychological
distress (including depression) are associated. Mothers
and fathers have reported high levels of fatigue with
parental sleep quality contributing to fatigue in the first
6 months post birth [11]. Poorer sleep quality has also
been associated with higher parental fatigue levels in
families with infants, toddlers, and preschoolers [9, 12].
Fatigue in the postnatal period accounted for 59% of the
variance in mothers’ depression scores [13]. Maternal fa-
tigue at 12 months post-birth predicted depression
scores at 18 months post-birth [14]. In early parenthood,
poor sleep quality contributed to variance in fathers’
anxiety and stress but not depression scores [15]; be-
cause parental sleep quality, fatigue, and parental dis-
tress, including depression, are linked, it is important to
examine contributions of parents’ sleep quality and fa-
tigue to depression. This is particularly important for
fathers who have received minimal research attention.
Parental cognitions (expectations and attitudes) about
infant sleep, in particular doubts about managing infant
sleep, difficulty with setting sleep limits, and anger at in-
fants’ demands around sleep, have consistently been as-
sociated with infant behavioral sleep problems [16–19].
When maternal cognitions about sleep and depression
for mothers of 31 children with behavioral sleep prob-
lems and 170 control mothers were compared, mothers
of children with sleep problems reported more doubts
about managing infant sleep, anger at infants’ demands
around sleep, and depressive symptoms than controls
[20]. Mothers with higher levels of depressive symptoms
have reported more infant night waking and more
maternal worries (cognitions) about adequately respond-
ing to their infants' needs at night [21].
Because parental cognitions drive parents’ behaviors
around infant sleep, modifying their cognitions is a
major element in behavioral interventions to improve in-
fants’ sleep [1]. Regardless of whether maternal depres-
sion precedes infant sleep problems or infant sleep
problems precede depression, an area of great debate in
the literature, [22] interventions to resolve infant behav-
ioral sleep problems have improved infant night waking
[4, 23, 24] and maternal and paternal depression scores
post intervention [8, 25–27]. Moreover, mothers of in-
fants
exposed
to
a
preventative
sleep
intervention
reported lower depression scores and fewer doubts (cog-
nition) about managing their infants’ sleep problems
than a control group [28].
Parental depression has implications for many parenting
interactions with infants. Caregiving by mothers with de-
pression can involve more intrusive or withdrawn interac-
tions, less preventative health care visits (immunization),
and less satisfaction with breastfeeding [29]. Maternal
postnatal depression has been associated with increased
paternal depression and parenting stress, and less optimal
father-infant interactions [30]. Paternal depressive symp-
toms have been linked with children’s internalizing and
externalizing behaviors in early childhood [31].
Relationships between parental depression scores, fa-
tigue, sleep quality, and infant sleep cognitions require
examination. Using baseline data (prior to group assign-
ment and intervention exposure) and follow-up data
(post intervention exposure) from mothers and fathers
of healthy 6–8 month-old-infants with behavioral sleep
problems, this secondary analysis aimed to: 1) identify
proportions of mothers and fathers reporting high and
clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline
and follow-up; 2) identify mothers’ and fathers’ means
and standard deviations for depression, sleep quality, fa-
tigue, and sleep cognitions (baseline, follow-up and
change
scores);
3)
examine
relationships
between
mothers’ and fathers’ depression, sleep quality, fatigue,
and sleep cognitions scores at baseline and follow-up; 4)
explore the variance in mothers’ and fathers’ depression
scores explained by sleep quality, fatigue, and sleep cog-
nitions scores at baseline and follow-up; and 5) explore
the variance in mothers’ and fathers’ change in depres-
sion scores explained by changes in sleep quality, fatigue,
and sleep cognition scores from baseline to follow-up.
Methods
The study, from which these data are drawn for second-
ary analysis, was a randomized controlled trial to evalu-
ate a cognitive-behavioural sleep intervention for healthy
6-to-8-months-old infants based on improvement in
Hall et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:104

 parental perceptions of infant sleep problems and re-
duced infant night waking at 6 weeks post-intervention
[8]. The study sample was recruited between September
2009 and March 2011. Parents, who reported a diagnosis
of depression or receiving treatment for depression (anti-
depressant medications or cognitive therapy), had diag-
nosed sleep problems, or worked permanent night shifts,
were excluded. An infant sleep problem was defined as an
infant waking two or more times per night and/or wakes
lasting more than 20 min, occurring at least four nights
per week for a minimum of 3 weeks [32]. Two hundred
and thirty-five families (including 8 single-parent families)
provided baseline data and 188 families provided follow-
up data. This secondary analysis reports combined control
and
intervention
group
data
from
baseline
(before
randomization) and outcomes assessed at 18–24 weeks
post-intervention exposure (follow-up).
A brief summary of the trial follows; details about the
trial have been published elsewhere [8]. The primary
outcome measure was significant infant sleep disturbance:
parent report of a severe sleep problem or actigraphic
wakes of greater than two per night averaged over five
nights.
Secondary
outcomes
were
improvements
in
parents’ perceptions of their mood, fatigue, and sleep
quality, and the quality of their cognitions about infant
sleep. Following randomization into intervention and con-
trol groups, both groups received a 2-h teaching session
and 2 weeks of bi-weekly telephone support calls. The
intervention group received information about managing
infant sleep problems and the control group received in-
formation about managing infant safety risks. Trial out-
comes were assessed at 6 weeks post-teaching session.
Following that assessment, the sleep group received a
pamphlet summarizing the safety information and the
safety group received a pamphlet reproducing the infor-
mation taught in the sleep intervention training session.
At baseline and follow-up, parents completed ques-
tionnaires which included demographic questions, and
measures of parental sleep quality, fatigue, depression,
and cognitions about infant sleep. Parents provided
follow-up data at 24 weeks post-intervention exposure
(sleep and safety training); however, because the control
group was exposed to the sleep intervention (printed
material) at 6 weeks post-intervention their data collec-
tion occurred at 18 weeks post sleep intervention.
In the study database, parental designation was by pri-
mary and secondary caregiver because one caregiver
took the lead for the intervention. In only one two-
parent family, the primary caregiver was male and all
single parents were females; therefore, we refer to
mothers (primary caregivers) and fathers (secondary
caregivers) in this paper. One family self-identified as a
lesbian couple. At follow-up, 188 mothers and 171
fathers responded with questionnaire data. Because this
is a secondary analysis of data obtained for a trial, power
calculations were not undertaken for examining relation-
ships among psychological variables.
Measures
At baseline, data were collected on parents’ age, marital/
partner status, years of formal education, number of
children, work status and hours of work, family income,
rating of infant sleep problem severity, and ethnicity.
Data were also collected on infant gender, birth order,
age, breast feeding status, and co-sleeping. At follow-up,
only data about parents’ age, length of relationship, high-
est level of education, and ethnicity and infant gender
were not collected again.
The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CESD) was used to measure depressive symptoms
[33]. Higher scores indicated higher levels of symptoms,
with a score of ≥16 being used as the cut-off point for
high depressive symptoms and ≥22 being used to indi-
cate clinically significant depression. The CESD has
demonstrated reliability and validity when used with
childbearing populations [34]. In a quasi-experimental
intervention study for infants’ behavioral sleep problems,
the measure indicated a significant improvement in
mood following the intervention (p = .001) [25]. In this
study, Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.89 to 0.90. The
use of the term depression in this paper is not intended
to indicate a diagnosis of clinical depression.
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used
to assess parents’ sleep quality [35]. Higher scores indi-
cate worse sleep quality. The PSQI has demonstrated
relationships between lifestyle regularity and sleep qual-
ity in healthy subjects [36]. In a quasi-experimental
study of an intervention for parents with infants with
behavioral sleep problems, sleep quality improved sig-
nificantly post-intervention (p < .001) [25]. In this study,
Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.53 to 0.69.
The Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Scale
(MAF) Global Fatigue Index (GFI) was used to assess
fatigue [37]. Higher scores equal more fatigue. Reliability
and validity of the measure was supported with two large
cohorts of postnatal women [38]. In a quasi-experimental
study of an intervention to manage an infant sleep prob-
lem, MAF scores demonstrated significant reductions in
parental fatigue post-intervention (p < .001) [25]. In this
study, Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.94 to 0.95.
The Maternal Cognitions about Infant Sleep Question-
naire (MCISQ) was used to measure parents’ thoughts
about managing infant sleep [16]. The questionnaire
comprises 20 items with five subscales including: limit
setting around infant sleep, anger about sleep, doubt
about managing infant sleep, the necessity of feeding
infants at night, and infant sleep safety. Higher scores in-
dicate more difficulty with managing sleep. The MCISQ
Hall et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:104 
Page 3 of 10
 has predicted settling strategies and infant sleep prob-
lems [17, 39] and differentiated infants with poor and
good sleep quality using parental difficulty with limit set-
ting [18]. In a small quasi-experimental study using the
MCISQ, parents’ cognitions improved after a sleep inter-
vention for infant behavioral sleep problems including:
setting sleep limits (p < .001, d = 1), anger about sleep
problems (p < .001, d = 0.7), doubt about handling sleep
problems (p < .001, d = 0.7), and necessity for night feed-
ing (p < .001, d = 1) [25]. In this study, Cronbach’s alpha
for the subscales ranged from 0.5-0.75.
Parental perceptions about infant sleep were measured
using the Child Sleep Question from the Longitudinal
Study of Australian Children (LSAC). The measure has
been used in a number of studies to indicate the extent
to which parents perceived their child to have a sleep
problem (no, mild, moderate, or severe) [40–43].
Statistical analysis
For baseline and follow-up, we calculated univariate
descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) and
normality statistics for continuous, demographic, and
subscale data, and percentages for categorical data. We
examined changes in proportions of parents with de-
pressive symptomatology and clinically depressive symp-
tomatology based on cut-off scores on the CESD. We
calculated change scores (follow-up - baseline) for all of
the variables and used Pearson’s r to examine correla-
tions among continuous variables.
To examine mothers’ and fathers’ predictors of depres-
sion, we undertook six forward stepwise multiple regres-
sion analyses, two at baseline, two at follow-up and two
using change scores to determine the best combination
of sleep quality, fatigue, and cognitions about infant
sleep for predicting depression. To control for interven-
tion/control group allocation, group assignment was
entered as an independent variable in all of the models;
we used change scores for one model. We entered all
eight of the independent variables (group, fatigue, sleep
quality, sleep doubts, sleep limits, sleep anger, sleep
safety, and sleep and feeding) simultaneously. When the
backward method was used the results were the same.
The assumptions were met for performing multiple re-
gression analysis. No two independent variables included
in the models had an association of r ≥ 0.60, minimizing
potential for multi-collinearity. Checks of assumptions
yielded no indicators of multicollinearity. The outcome
variables at follow-up were slightly heteroscedastic. We
used IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24 (IBM
Corp, Armonk, N.Y., USA) and considered p-values
<0.05 as statistically significant. Correlation analyses
were two-sided. We compared observed proportions of
parents reporting none-mild sleep problems using a
Fisher’s exact test with adjustment for baseline severity
using the Mantel-Haenszel test, including corresponding
95% confidence intervals for differences in proportions. We
used ANOVA to examine change of scores between base-
line and follow-up for primary and secondary caregivers.
Results
Demographic data at baseline and follow-up demonstrate
similar characteristics (See Tables 1 and 2). By follow-up,
most mothers had returned to paid employment. Given
the infants’ ages were between 11 and 16 months at
follow-up the proportion of infants still breastfeeding was
very high (55.2%). At follow-up, most mothers identified
infant sleep as not a problem or a mild problem (72.3%)
compared with baseline where the majority identified a
moderate to severe problem (81%). A minority of parents
(26.2%) were co-sleeping at follow-up. We used Chi-
Square to compare parents by missing data on their CESD
scores at follow-up based on their demographic character-
istics at baseline; there were no significant differences on
family income, education, parents’ age, partner status,
sleep problem rating, or cultural identity.
At baseline, mothers’ mean depression scores exceeded
the cut-off for the CESD for high depressive symptoms
but the fathers’ mean scores did not (See Table 3). The
mean change scores indicated that all of the variables
(higher scores = more difficulties) changed in the desired
direction. Mothers’ and fathers’ means on the CESD
were equivalent at follow-up.

 At baseline, 47.8% (n = 111) of mothers and 34.5%
(n = 76) of fathers reported CESD scores ≥16. At
follow-up, only 18.1% (n = 34) of mothers and 14.6%
(n = 25) of fathers reported CESD scores of ≥16. At
baseline, 29.7% (n = 69) of mothers and 18.6% (n = 41)
of fathers reported CESD scores ≥22, while, at follow-
up, only 8.5% (n = 16) of mothers and 7.6% (n = 13) of
fathers reported CESD scores of ≥22.
At baseline (n = 455, mothers and fathers) and follow-
up (n = 359, mothers and fathers), parental fatigue, sleep
quality, doubts about managing infant sleep, difficulties
with sleep and feeding, anger about infant sleep, sleep
safety, and difficulties setting sleep limits for infants
were significantly positively correlated with depression
scores. The cognition scores were also significantly posi-
tively correlated with parental sleep quality and fatigue.
Sleep quality, fatigue and depression were moderately
correlated (See Table 4).
At baseline, mothers’ depression was associated with
sleep quality (b = .52), fatigue (b = .48), doubt about
managing infant sleep (b = .44), and anger about infant
sleep (b = .69). The model accounted for 47% of the vari-
ance (see Table 5). At baseline, fathers’ depression re-
lated to sleep quality (b = .42), fatigue (b = .47), and
doubt about managing infant sleep (b = .50). The model
accounted for 39% of the variance (See Table 6).
At follow-up, mothers’ depression was associated with
sleep quality (b = .76), fatigue (b = .25), doubt about man-
aging infant sleep (b = .44), sleep anger (b = .31), and set-
ting sleep limits (b = −.22). The model accounted for 39%
of the variance (see Table 5). At follow-up, fathers’ depres-
sion was linked to sleep quality (b = .84), fatigue (b = .31),
sleep doubt (b = .34), and setting sleep limits (b = .25). The
model accounted for 48% of the variance (see Table 6).
When change scores were examined change in fatigue
(b = .25), sleep anger (b = .59), sleep quality (b = .53),
and sleep doubt (b = .38) was associated with change in
maternal depression scores, with the model accounting
for 33% of the variance. Fathers’ change in depression
scores related to changes in fatigue (b = .36), sleep safety
(b = .89), and sleep anger scores (b = .37), with the model
accounting for 35% of the variance (See Table 7).
Discussion
Our results demonstrated reductions in parents’ levels of
high and clinically significant depression scores from
baseline to follow-up. All of the change scores reported
indicated reductions in fatigue, poor
sleep quality,
depression, and problematic parental cognitions about
infant sleep from baseline to follow-up. The variables all
demonstrated small to moderate statistically significant
correlations. At baseline and follow-up, maternal depres-
sion was associated with fatigue, sleep quality, doubt
about managing infant sleep, and sleep anger. At follow-
up, setting sleep limits had a statistically significant
negative relationship with maternal depression. At base-
line and follow-up, paternal depression was related to
fatigue, sleep quality, and doubt about managing infant
sleep. At follow-up only, paternal depression was associ-
ated with setting sleep limits. To control for baseline, we
also examined variables associated with mothers’ and
fathers’ change in depression scores from baseline to
follow-up. Mothers’ changes in depression followed a
similar pattern to variables associated with depression
scores. Changes in maternal fatigue, sleep quality, sleep
anger and doubt about managing infant sleep related to
change in maternal depression. For fathers, the pattern
was quite different because changes in fatigue, sleep
anger, and infant safety during sleep were associated
with changes in paternal depression.

correlations
among depression scores and fatigue and sleep quality
scores in a sample of men and women who had not been

 recruitment. Moreover, sleep quality and fatigue were
not only making significant contributions to depression
scores at baseline but also at 18 to 24 weeks follow-up,
when our infants’ mean age was 12.9 months. Change in
depression scores was associated with fatigue change for
mothers and fathers, although change in sleep quality
was only significant for mothers. Our findings emphasize
the importance of Giallo and colleagues’ work demon-
strating that maternal fatigue at 12 months post-birth
predicted depression scores at 18 months post-birth
[14]. In other studies, infants’ sleep problems at 4 and 6
months have been associated with increased paternal de-
pression and poor personal sleep quantity and quality
[7] suggesting fathers’ mental health is also suffering.
High levels of parental fatigue have also been associated
with lower parenting competence, greater stress, more
irritability in parent–child interactions, and poorer sleep
quality [12].
Parental cognitions have also been associated with
infant behavioral sleep problems [16–19] but effects of
parental cognitions on depression, in combination with
parental fatigue and sleep quality, are rarely studied. Our
results indicated that parental cognitions consistently
contributed to variance associated with maternal and
paternal depression when sleep quality and fatigue were
also considered, in particular, parents’ doubts about
managing infant sleep. Setting sleep limits contributed
to variance in depression scores for mothers and fathers
only at follow-up and for mothers, the relationship was
negative (less difficulty setting sleep limits associated

 with lower depression scores). In another study, when
mothers identified children as having behavioral sleep
problems, their cognitions about infant sleep were sig-
nificantly positively correlated with their depression
scores; doubts about infant sleep, difficulties with limit
setting, and anger about infant sleep, and scores on the
depression measure were significantly higher in the
infant behavioral sleep problem group than in the feed-
ing problem or control groups [20].
At baseline, but not at follow-up, mothers’ anger about
infant sleep problems was contributing more variance to
their depression scores than sleep quality. Fathers’ anger
did not make a statistically significant contribution to
depression variance at baseline or at follow-up but their
change scores for sleep anger and fears about infant
safety contributed to their depression change score.
Parents may be fearful of losing control and harming
their infants when experiencing anger about infant sleep
problems. Fathers have reported anger about infants’
sleep problems at 4 and 6 months of age [7].
In our study, the patterns in relationships between
cognitions and parental depression indicated that parents’
doubts about managing infant sleep persisted in contribut-
ing to depression score variance and fathers’ difficulties
with setting sleep limits had a positive relationship with
depression. Morrell linked infant night waking with prob-
lematic parental cognitions about limit setting, doubt, and
anger to over-intrusive and rejecting parental interactions
[16]. Difficulties with setting limits can persist because
mothers’ difficulty setting limits for 12-months-old infants
has predicted objectively measured night waking problems
when children are 4 years old [44]. When Teti and Crosby
tested models correlating maternal depressive symptoms,
‘dysfunctional cognitions (worries about infant needs and
maternal helplessness/loss of control)’
, and infant night
waking, for cohorts between 5 weeks and 25.3 months,
they suggested that maternal depressive symptoms, night-
time presence, and worries about infant night needs were
driving infant sleep problems [21]. They also acknowl-
edged; however, that chronic infant night waking and
distress could elicit maternal interventions that increase
maternal distress. Rather than endless academic specula-
tion about whether parental depression is driving infant
sleep problems or infant sleep problems are driving paren-
tal depression it is important to offer parents interventions
to manage infant sleep problems.
In our study, there was a marked improvement in par-
ents’ depression from levels at baseline to 18–24 week
follow-up; there was a reduction in proportions of
mothers and fathers scoring above cut-offs on the CESD
for depressive symptomatology by between 11 and 30%.
The literature has demonstrated that, not only have infant
behavioral sleep problems been consistently associated
with maternal depression scores [5, 8, 26, 27] and, under
the rare circumstances where fathers are assessed, with
paternal depression scores [7, 8, 25], but also that inter-
ventions
for
infant
behavioral
sleep
problems
have
improved infant night waking [4, 8, 23] and maternal and
paternal depression scores [8, 25–27]. A recent trial by
Gradisar and colleagues reported that graduated extinc-
tion (also called controlled comforting) improved infant
sleep and decreased infant cortisol levels and maternal
stress compared with controls (sleep education) [24].
Limitations
This secondary analysis of the trial data relies on a sam-
ple of convenience. Although we did not detect any
demographic differences on missing CESD scores it is
possible that retention bias could have been operating.

 reduced the likelihood of parents experiencing marital
or parenting conflict participating in the study. We ex-
cluded parents with diagnosed depression or receiving
treatment for depression because pre-existing chronic
depression would be unlikely to be sensitive to changes
in infants’ night waking but excluding those parents
limits the generalizability of our findings. We combined
the control group and intervention group study partici-
pants because, at follow-up, there were no significant
differences between groups on depression, fatigue, or
sleep scores, combining the groups increased the study
power, and we wanted to examine relationships between
parental cognitions and depression following interven-
tions for infants’ behavioral sleep problems.
It is a limitation that parents were exposed to different
forms of the intervention (face-to-face as opposed to writ-
ten materials) at different time points. The control group
received intervention materials 6 weeks later than the inter-
vention group, which could influence the utility of the
intervention. Other researchers have reported that compar-
isons of face-to-face treatment and exposure to written ma-
terials revealed no differences in efficacy post-intervention
[45, 46]. When we compared intervention and control
groups at follow-up, there were no significant differences
on any of the measures except for parents’ perceptions of
the severity of the infant sleep problem of none-mild
(96.3% intervention versus 86% control, p < .001, 95% CI
2.8%–17.8%) and a significant improvement in intervention
group fathers’ sleep doubt (F(1,171) = 5.6, p = 0.02) and
comfort with sleep and feeding (F(1,171) = 8.8, p = 0.004)
compared with the control group. It may be possible that
fewer fathers in the control group were exposed to the
sleep intervention through reading the written material.
Strengths
We used the comparison of baseline and follow-up data
to explore changes in parents’ psychological variables for a
large sample of parents with infants in a narrow age range
(i.e., developmentally similar). We used tools with evi-
dence for reliability and validity for parents’ psychological
measures. Our inclusion of fathers is an important step
forward in understanding parents’ patterns of cognitions.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates complex associations between
mothers’ and fathers’ depression scores, sleep quality, fa-
tigue, and sleep cognitions. Findings suggest it is important
to provide parents with ongoing support to attend to fa-
thers’ comfort with setting limits about infant sleep and
mothers’ anger about infant sleep. Additional support to
reduce doubts about managing infant sleep and further
study of differences in mothers’ and fathers’ cognitive re-
sponses to children’s sleep problems would improve the
effectiveness of sleep interventions.
