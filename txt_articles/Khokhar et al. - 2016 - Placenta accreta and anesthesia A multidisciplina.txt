ABSTRACT
Placenta accreta (an abnormally adherent placenta) is one of the two leading causes of peripartum hemorrhage and the most 
common indication for peripartum hysterectomy. Placenta accreta may be associated with significant maternal hemorrhage at 
delivery owing to the incomplete placental separation. When placenta accreta is diagnosed before delivery, a multidisciplinary 
approach may improve patient outcome.
Key words: Anesthesia; hemorrhage; placenta accreta
Introduction
Normally, the placenta adheres to the decidua basalis layer, 
allowing for a smooth separation of the placenta from 
the uterine wall after delivery. In patients with abnormal 
placentation, the placenta has invaded past the decidua basalis 
layer. The incidence of placenta accreta among deliveries is low 
(0.04%). However, it accounts for up to 50% of all caesarean 
hysterectomies most of which are unplanned. Placenta accreta 
(an abnormally adherent placenta) is one of the two leading 
causes of peripartum hemorrhage and the most common 
indication for peripartum hysterectomy.[1] This has anesthetic 
implications because it is necessary to prepare for the potential 
danger of major hemorrhage. Anesthesia management of the 
hemorrhage consisted of blood and fluid replacement, guided 
by an assessment of the amount of blood loss along with 
heart rate, urine output, and systemic blood pressure. General 
anesthesia is preferred due to the longer operating times, 
massive hemorrhage and need for an extension of surgery 
including iliac vessel exposure. A multidisciplinary approach 
may improve patient outcome. We report a case placenta 
accreta with planned hysterectomy using multidisciplinary 
approach resulting in decrease morbidity and mortality.
Case Report
A 35-year-old female, weighing 70 kg, gravida six presented 
for an elective cesarean section. Her past obstetric history 
included five previous cesarean sections for cephalo-pelvic 
disproportion and expected lengthy procedures under 
general anesthesia uneventfully. There was no significant 
past medical or surgical history. All routine laboratory results 
were in normal range except hemoglobin that was 9 g/dl. 
Ultrasonography of abdomen showed placenta accreta. Hence, 
elective cesarean section with consented hysterectomy, 
under general anesthesia was planned. In view of expected 
massive blood loss, adequate packed red blood cells (PRBCs) 
and blood products were available in the operation theater. 
The patient was on the operating theater table with a wedge 
under the right hip. Standard monitors (electrocardiogram,

noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oxymeter) were 
applied. Her baseline vitals were within normal limits. After 
5 min of preoxygenation, induction of anesthesia was done 
with intravenous (IV) propofof 150 mg. Tracheal intubation 
was facilitated by IV suxamethonium 100 mg and with cricoid 
pressure. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen and air 
(50%), sevoflurane (1.0-1.5%) and IV cisatracurium 12 mg.
Two peripheral IV lines (16 gauge and 18 gauge) were 
secured. A 20 gauge arterial cannula placed in the left radial 
artery and ultrasound guided 7.5 Fr triple lumen central 
venous catheter placed in a right internal jugular vein. Prior 
to cesarean section urologists did a cystoscopy to rule out 
intra-vesical invasion of the placenta and inserted bilateral 
ureteric stents to avoid ureteric injury and identification 
during hysterectomy and Foley’s catheter inserted. A healthy 
female baby of 2.1 kg with normal Apgar score was delivered. 
Thereafter, carbetocin (pabal) 100 µg IV and oxytocin IV 
infusion (30 units in 500 ml Ringer’s lactate) were started. 
Placenta left in the uterus and hysterotomy wound sutured 
to avoid partial placental delivery inducing hemorrhage. Both 
uterine arteries clamped and hysterectomy done. During 
surgery, blood loss was almost 1 L. Intraoperative heart 
rate and blood pressure remained stable, and hemoglobin 
dropped to 8 g/dl that was replaced with two units of PRBCs. 
The procedure lasted for 2 h and she received total 2500 ml IV 
fluid including Ringer’s lactate and PRBCs with urine output 
of 100 ml/h. At the end of surgery, neuro-muscular block 
was reversed with glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg IV and neostigmine 
sulfate 2.5 mg IV. In immediate postoperative period, patient 
was conscious, cooperative, with adequate muscle tone and 
power. Her vitals were stable. In the postoperative room, she 
was supplemented with face mask and 1 unit of PRBCs was 
infused. Postoperative pain managed by patient controlled 
analgesia. She had an uneventful in the postoperative course.
Discussion
There are varying degrees of abnormal placentation. 
Placenta accreta vera occurs when the placenta adheres to 
the myometrium. Placental invasion into the myometrium is 
termed placenta increta. Placenta percreta involves invasion 
of the placenta through the myometrium to the uterine serosa 
and may include invasion into other pelvic organs. A scar 
from a previous cesarean delivery or other uterine surgeries, 
pelvic radiation,[2,3] or localization of the placenta in an area 
deficient of decidua around the cervical os (placenta previa)[4] 
may allow for abnormal decidualization. However, many cases 
of placenta accrete occur in the absence of a decidualization 
defect.[5] In such cases, the abnormal placentation may be due 
to excessive invasion of the trophoblast.
The incidence of placenta accreta has increased steadily 
during the past several decades — Most likely secondary to 
the rising rate of cesarean deliveries — and currently occurs 
at a rate of 1:500 deliveries.[6] Placenta previa, especially 
with a history of cesarean delivery, is a major risk factor 
for placenta accrete.[7] The rate of cesarean delivery in the 
United States has risen by 53% from 1996 to 2007. As of 
2007, one-third of all deliveries in the United States was by 
cesarean, with Louisiana having the third highest cesarean 
delivery rate in the country.[8] The incidence of abnormal 
placentation in patients with a placenta previa increases 
from 3% with no history of cesarean delivery to >60% in 
patients with more than 2 prior cesarean deliveries. As the 
incidence of cesarean delivery rises, so will cases of abnormal 
placentation.[9] However, it is important to remember that 
abnormal placentation can occur even in patients without 
a prior history of cesarean delivery. Multiparity, advanced 
maternal age, previous dilation and curettage, hypertensive 
disorders, and tobacco use are also risk factors for accreta 
in patients with a placenta previa.[10]
Patients with placenta accreta usually require a hysterectomy. 
As diagnosis cannot be established definitively with 
ultrasound, diagnosis can be made only at surgery. When 
placenta accreta is diagnosed antenatally, generally the 
placenta is left attached while hysterectomy is performed.[11] 
In our hospital, we have assembled an obstetric hemorrhage 
team that consists of a maternal fetal medicine specialist, 
obstetrician, anesthesiologist, intensivist, and neonatologist. 
After initial case review, an interventional radiologist, 
urologist, and a blood bank physician are consulted if 
deemed necessary. In our case by use of multi-disciplinary 
team approach and pre-operative preparations, we decrease 
the patient morbidity, and mortality and patient’s outcome 
was good.
Conclusion
Patients with placenta accreta are at risk for significant 
hemorrhage at delivery. The key to a successful outcome 
in these cases is a multidisciplinary approach, appropriate 
communication, and early planning. Favorable maternal 
and fetal outcomes have resulted from this team-based 
 
approach.
