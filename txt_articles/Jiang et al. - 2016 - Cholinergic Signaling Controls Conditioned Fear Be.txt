In Brief
Jiang et al. demonstrate that
manipulating BLA cholinergic input is
important for emotional memory
acquisition/retention. Stimulating ACh
input increases principal neuron
excitability and enhances glutamatergic
synaptic plasticity in BLA. AChR
antagonists block these effects.

SUMMARY
We examined the contribution of endogenous cholin-
ergic signaling to the acquisition and extinction of
fear- related memory by optogenetic regulation of
cholinergic input to the basal lateral amygdala (BLA).
Stimulation of cholinergic terminal fields within the
BLA in awake-behaving mice during training in a
cued fear-conditioning paradigm slowed the extinc-
tion of learned fear as assayed by multi-day retention
of extinction learning. Inhibition of cholinergic activity
during training reduced the acquisition of learned fear
behaviors. Circuit mechanisms underlying the behav-
ioral effects of cholinergic signaling in the BLA were
assessed by in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological
recording. Photostimulation of endogenous cholin-
ergicinput(1)enhances firingofputativeBLAprincipal
neurons through activation of acetylcholine receptors
(AChRs), (2) enhances glutamatergic synaptic trans-
mission in the BLA, and (3) induces LTP of cortical-
amygdala circuits. These studies support an essential
role of cholinergic modulation of BLA circuits in the
inscription and retention of fear memories.
INTRODUCTION
Emotionally salientexperiencescanbeindeliblyinscribed inmem-
ory. Recall of either highly aversive or appetitive events engages
distributed brain networks whose activity is tuned by various neu-
romodulators, including acetylcholine (ACh; Hasselmo and Sarter
2011; Hermans et al., 2014; LeDoux 2012; Luchicchi et al., 2014;
Picciotto et al., 2012). Cholinergic signaling has long been impli-
cated in attending to and remembering emotionally potent experi-
ences, but the precise role of ACh signaling in mnemonic process-
ing of highly salient events has remained elusive (Dani and
Bertrand 2007; Hasselmo and Sarter 2011; Luchicchi et al.,
2014; Sarter et al., 2014). The major challenge to dissecting the
role of endogenous ACh in the formation and retention of potent
memories has been the inability to selectively and reversibly
manipulate the activity of cholinergic inputs, which tend to be
sparsely distributed, extensively arborized, and intermingled
with projections of other transmitter phenotypes (Wu et al., 2014).
Studies of fear in humans and in rodents have implicated the
amygdala as an essential circuit component in the network that
encodes the formation, recall, and extinction of fear memory
(Adolphs 2013; Duvarci and Pare 2014; Herry and Johansen
2014; Zelikowsky et al., 2014). In particular, direct activation of
principal neurons within the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) has
been shown to be sufficient to associate sensory input with condi-
tioned fear responses (Johansen et al., 2010; Tye et al., 2011). The
strong similarities between the networks that are related to fear
in humans with those in other species underscore the potential
utility of dissecting the modulation of amygdala circuitry in animal
models as a vital step to inform development of treatments for
anxiety and fear disorders (Schiller and Delgado 2010).
In both humans and rodents, the BLA receives a particularly
rich cholinergic projection arising primarily from the nucleus ba-
salis (NBM) with some contribution from the horizontal limb of
the diagonal band of Broca (Woolf 1991). The NBM cholinergic
neurons and their projections to the BLA are interspersed with
neurons and fibers of other transmitter phenotypes, preventing
selective stimulation or inhibition by standard electrophysiolog-
ical or pharmacological techniques. Even with selective immu-
noablation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, defining the
role of ACh signaling in fear learning has remained a challenge
(Baxter and Bucci 2013). In this study, we used optogenetic tech-
niques to specifically stimulate or inhibit cholinergic inputs within
the BLA, enabling us to assess the contribution of cholinergic
signaling to cue conditioned fear behaviors in mice and to test
the role of cholinergic inputs in the modulation of cortical-BLA
circuit plasticity in in vivo preparations and in acute, ex vivo brain
slice preparations.
RESULTS
Our first goal was to develop and validate methods for the selec-
tive activation of cholinergic neurons and their terminal fields in

 the BLA of awake-behaving mice and anesthetized mice, and in
acute ex vivo slices of the BLA (Figure 1). We have used a set of
excitatory (oChIEF) and inhibitory (eNpHR3.0; Halo) light-sensi-
tive probes engineered into adeno-associated viral (AAV) vec-
tors. Both vectors are a flip excision switch design that requires
Cre-mediated recombination for expression (Figure 1A). Viruses
were injected into the basal forebrain nuclei of ChAT-Cre mice at
1 week post-weaning (Figure 1B, top), resulting in robust expres-
sion of the labeled optoprobes in ChAT-positive (cholinergic)
neurons in the NBM and throughout the cholinergic terminal
fields within the BLA 2–4 weeks post-infection (Figure 1C, top).
Specificity and Efficiency of Viral Vector Expression in
Cholinergic Neurons
To confirm specific viral expression in cholinergic neurons and
their projections, we crossed ChAT-Cre mice with mice in which
all the cholinergic neurons were genetically labeled with tauGFP,
yielding a mouse line that expressed both Cre and tauGFP in
all cholinergic neurons (Figure 1B, bottom). ChAT-Cre/tauGFP
mice were injected with AAV9-DIO-oChIEF-tdTomato at 1 week
post-weaning. Two weeks after gene delivery, we prepared
coronal brain slices containing the NBM (bregma �0.4 mm to
�1.06 mm) and quantified viral expression by counting the
number of cells that were singly labeled with either the tauGFP
or oChIEF-tdTomato and the number of cells that were doubly
labeled with both fluorescent proteins (Figure 1C). Quantification
of the total number of neurons per z stack projection that were
singly labeled by either the tauGFP or oChIEF-tdTomato and
the number of NBM neurons that were doubly labeled revealed
an infection efficiency of �50% (45.1 ± 1.6, n = 6 animals). Viral
targeting was specific for ChAT+ neurons and their projections:
only 3% of the oChIEF-tdTomato-positive NBM neurons lacked
detectable tauGFP staining (Figure 1D). Likewise, high-resolution
imaging of the cholinergic projections within the BLA revealed
that oChIEF-tdTomato labeling along axonal processes was
localized immediately adjacent to, and overlapping with, tauGFP
(Figure 1C, bottom right; inset).
Fidelity of Photostimulated Suprathreshold Firing in
oChIEF-Expressing Cholinergic NBM Neurons
We next tested the properties of oChIEF-expressing cholinergic
NBM neurons in ChAT-Cre mice in both in vivo and acute, ex vivo
preparations. In vivo photoactivation of oChIEF-expressing neu-
rons within the NBM was elicited by 5 ms pulses of 473 nm laser
light delivered at 1–25 Hz through a 200 mm diameter optical fiber
stereotactically positioned in the NBM. Extracellular recordings
from the NBM reliably revealed one-to-one, photostimulation-
locked action potential firing up to frequencies of �20 Hz. Spike
fidelity dropped off at higher stimulation frequencies (Figure 1E).
Spike fidelity also dropped off at 20 Hz in whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings from oChIEF-expressing NBM neurons identified in
acute slice (ex vivo) studies (Figure 1F). Ex vivo recordings in
NBM demonstrated that tauGFP+ (ChAT+) neurons significantly
differed from tauGFP� (ChAT�) neurons in firing rate, threshold
for firing, and spike waveform, and that the spike properties of
oChIEF-expressing, tauGFP+ neurons were identical to those
of tauGFP+ NBM neurons that did not express oChIEF, suggest-
ing that cholinergic NBM neurons were unaffected by expression
of oChIEF-tdTomato (Figure S1, available online).
In addition to assessing whether photostimulation effectively
elicited depolarizing responses in the NBM, we further examined
the relationship between the intensity of light exposure (mW/mm2)
and the net change in conductance evoked in oChIEF-expressing
NBM neurons (Figure 1G). Light intensities of 0.7 mW/ mm2 were
sufficient to evoke maximal conductance responses. There was
no further increase or decrease in light-evoked conductance
with as much as 7 mW/mm2.
To assess potential experimental confounds of photostimula-
tion per se, we performed a series of control studies using
coherent wavelength illumination in mice labeled with floxed viral
GFP probes lacking the associated opsin channels and in ChAT-
tauGFP mice (Figure S2). These illumination controls, in addition
to studies with floxed opsin containing virus with mismatched
wavelength illumination, indicate that there were no confounding
effects of illumination per se on behavioral measures, NBM or
BLA excitability, or cortical-BLA synaptic transmission in either
in vivo or ex vivo studies (Figure S2).
Optogenetic Manipulation of Cholinergic Tone in BLA
Alters Fear Learning and Extinction Behaviors
Because of the established literature relating the BLA to associa-
tive fear conditioning (Gale et al., 2004; Myskiw et al., 2014) and
the continuing debate as to the role of cholinergic signaling in
fear and extinction learning behaviors (Knox and Keller 2015;
Kutlu et al., 2016; Lalumiere and McGaugh 2005; Pidoplichko
et al., 2013; Santini et al., 2012), we tested the effects of optoge-
netic manipulation of endogenous ACh signaling in the BLA using
a classical associative, cue-conditioning paradigm. To assess the
contribution ofcholinergic signaling in theBLA to fearlearning and
recall as well as to subsequent retention of extinction learning, we

detected with light intensities of 1–7 mW/mm2. See Figures S1–S3.

 photoactivated oChIEF- or eNpHR3.0-expressing cholinergic ter-
minal fields in ChAT-Cre mice during the training period of the
associative learning paradigm via implanted fiber-optic cannulae
targeted to the dorsal surface of the BLA (Figure 2).
We first tested whether altering the activity of cholinergic inputs
in the BLA during the conditioned fear training per se would alter
the extent of fear learning (Figures 2A and 2D). Control animals
were either virally infected and implanted with optical fibers, but
were not light exposed during training (Figure 2), or were infected
withan AAVencodingGFPaloneandwereexposed tolightduring
the training period (Figure S2). In addition, we compared the ef-
fects of a single tone-shock pairing with that of three tone-shock
pairings (Table S1). Post hoc analyses across the nine separate
cohorts (87 mice; Table S1) revealed that all of the control condi-
tion mice were equivalent in their freezing behavior during the pre-
training, training, and recall phases. The number of pairings did
affect subsequent retention of extinction learning. For experi-
ments using photostimulation, we focused on the three tone-
shock pairings to test the effect of increased cholinergic activa-
tion on the durability of fear learning, whereas for photoinhibition
of the cholinergic inputs we focused on the single pairing protocol
to minimize laser exposure times. Experimental animals were
processed identically to controls except that these mice were
exposed to photostimulation (oChIEF; 473 nm) or photoinhibition
(Halo; 590 nm) during the training period (Figures 2A and 2D,
respectively). Note that the photo treatments were only adminis-
tered during the pairing protocol of the fear training; the test of
the establishment of fear learning and all assessments of the
retention of extinction learning were conducted without any addi-
tional manipulations of cholinergic inputs by light (Figure 2A
versus Figures 2B and 2C; Figure 2D versus Figures 2E and 2F).
For activation of cholinergic inputs during training (Figure 2A;
Table S1), oChIEF-expressing cholinergic fibers in the BLA
were photoactivated concurrently with each tone-shock pairing
during the training period. Over the course of the training proto-
col, the freezing behavior of both the control mice (no light,
n = 15) and the blue-light-exposed mice (n = 18) showed a signif-
icant increase with time (F(17,594) = 5.54, p < 0.0001). However,
there was no significant difference in the extent of freezing be-
tween the control and the photostimulated groups during the
training period (F(1,594) = 0.56, p = 0.45; Figure 2A).
Twenty-four hours post-training, we measured the extent of
fear learning by assessing freezing behavior to the tone alone
(Recall). In oChIEF-expressing mice, the experimental (i.e., pho-
tostimulated during training) and the control mice displayed a
similar, elevated freezing behavior in response to cue alone
compared to freezing in response to the cue prior to training
(control, p < 0.001, U = 84; oChIEF activated, p < 0.001,
U = 78; Mann-Whitney rank-sum test). Comparison of the extent
of recall in controls with those subject to optogenetic stimulation
of oChIEF-expressing cholinergic inputs to the BLA during
training revealed that photostimulation was without significant
effect (Figure 2B; Recall following three tone-shock pairings,
n = 2 cohorts, 15 controls versus 18 photostimulated; Mann-
Whitney rank-sum test; U = 102.5, p = 0.247).
In contrast, subsequent examination of the time course of
retention of extinction learning revealed that mice that had
been exposed to photostimulation of the oChIEF-expressing
cholinergic terminal fields in the BLA during the initial training
were significantly more resistant to extinction learning than con-
trols (Figure 2C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Table
S1). Control animals displayed significant reductions in the
amount of time spent freezing to cue after only 1 day of extinction
learning and returned to a new steady-state, baseline level of
freezing within 3 days. In contrast, oChIEF-expressing mice
that had received photostimulation during the initial training
period showed a significantly greater response to the tone than
the controls through 5 days of extinction training (Wilcoxon
(C) Extinction. Top: schematic of paradigm for extinction training. Extinction learning involved exposing the mice to the same 30 s tone ten times at pseudo-
random intervals. Bottom: retention of extinction learning was tested 24 hr after each extinction training session by measuring the time spent freezing in response
to the first 30 s tone (mean ± SEM). Extinction training and test of recall were repeated daily for 7 days. Significant differences in freezing as a function of days of
extinction learning were found between control and oChIEF groups at all days except on day 7.
(D–F) Inhibition of cholinergic terminal fields: effects on recall and extinction.
(D) Training. Top: schematic of training paradigm with optogenetic inhibition of cholinergic terminal fields in BLA. On the training day, mice were exposed to one
30 s, 5 kHz, 80 dB tone (green block) co-terminating with a 2 s, 0.8 mA foot shock (black line). At the tone onset, mice in the Halo group (gray/yellow; n = 22)
received 2.5 min of continuous photostimulation (590 nm, yellow block) of the dorsal surface of the BLA. Control mice (black, n = 18) received no photostimulation.
Bottom: plot of time spent freezing over the 4 min of training with or without optogenetic inhibition. Prior to the cue 3 optogenetic pairing, there was no significant
difference in time spent freezing between groups. Immediately after the onset of photostimulation, a highly significant difference in freezing was found (mean ±
SEM; p < 0.001).
(E) Recall. Top: schematic of test of recall (as in B). Recall was measured as the time spent freezing to the tone. Bottom: there was a statistically significant
difference in the extent of Recall between Control and Halo-trained groups (p = 0.018).
(F) Extinction. Top: schematic of paradigm for extinction training. Extinction training and test of retention of extinction learning were performed as described
above. Bottom: overall, there was no significant difference in the retention of extinction learning between groups (mean ± SEM).
(G) Effect of intra-BLA infusion of cholinergic antagonists on fear conditioning and retention of extinction learning. To test the contribution of AChRs to fear
conditioning and retention of extinction learning, we compared the behavior of mice with bilateral, intra-BLA injections of saline alone (Vehicle Control) versus those
injected with blocking concentrations of both nicotinic and muscarinic AChR antagonists (mecamylamine; MEC 20 mM + atropine 1 mM) versus those injected with
blocking concentrations of atropine alone (1 mM). Blocking concentrations of both nAChR and mAChR antagonists, but not mAChR antagonists alone, reduced
recall (saline, n = 17; atropine and MEC, n = 8; atropine, n = 9; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, F(2,31) = 6.935, p = 0.003 for group effect; saline recall
versus atropine and MEC recall, p = 0.017; saline recall versus atropine alone recall, p = 0.797; atropine alone recall versus atropine and MEC recall, p = 0.003).
There was significantly greater retention of extinction learning in the group administered both atropine and MEC as compared to vehicle control, while the degree of
retention of extinction learning was unaffected by atropine (one-way ANOVA on ranks; H = 6.417, df = 2, p = 0.04; control versus mixed antagonists p < 0.05).

 rank-sum test; oChIEF stimulated versus control; extinction day
[E]1, p < 0.003; E2, p < 0.002; E3, p < 0.003; E5, p < 0.05 versus
E7, p = 0.34). The difference in the profile of retention of extinction
learning between groups was also significant as compared by
two-way ANOVA (F(1,227) = 26.784, p < 0.001; Figure 2C). These
results imply that increased endogenous cholinergic signaling in
the BLA renders the fear memory more resistant to extinction.
Photoinhibition of cholinergic terminal fields within the BLA
during training resulted in a strong and virtually immediate inhibi-
tion of the freezing response to the tone-shock pairing (Fig-
ure 2D). This difference was highly significant (two-way ANOVA;
F(1,181) = 51.8, p < 0.001). Motor activity during periods in which
there was no freezing did not differ between photoinhibited and
control mice (see Movie S1). Measures of recall of fear learning
24 hr after training again revealed significant increases in freezing
in response to the cue in both control (n = 18; p < 0.001) and
eNpHR3.0-expressing, photoinhibited mice (n = 22; p < 0.001).
However, comparison of the extent of recall revealed that the
learned cue association was significantly decreased by photoin-
hibition during training (Figure 2E; Mann-Whitney rank-sum test;
U = 226, p = 0.018; n = 18 controls versus 22 optoinhibition;
Movie S1). Comparison of the profile of the retention of extinction
learning in controls versus animals subjected to inhibition of
cholinergic input during fear training did not reveal any difference
(Figure 2F; two-way ANOVA; F(1,188) = 0.836, p = 0.362).
In sum, these data underscore the substantive and distinct ef-
fects of enhancement versus those of suppression of cholinergic
signaling in the acquisition and extinction of fear conditioning
behaviors. Cue-conditioned fear learning is robust 24 hr after
training. Inhibition of cholinergic input within the BLA concomi-
tant with cue-shock pairing was sufficient to significantly
decrease the extent of learned fear behaviors. In contrast, photo-
stimulation of cholinergic input within the BLA during training
did not alter the extent of recall, but significantly decreased the
retention of the extinction of learned fear behavior.
In light of recent controversies about the role of cholinergic
signaling per se, as opposed to other co-released neurotrans-
mitters in striatum and cortex (Higley et al., 2011; Ren et al.,
2011; Saunders et al., 2015), we directly tested the contribution
of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to fear conditioning and
retention of extinction learning. We examined the effects of
intra-BLA infusion of vehicle versus infusion of AChR blockers
via chronically implanted cannulae during training on recall and
retention of extinction without further manipulation of the cholin-
ergic signaling (Figure 2G; Table S1). The results of these exper-
iments were as follows: (1) intra-BLA infusion of vehicle alone did
not alter the strength of fear conditioning or retention of extinc-
tion, and (2) intra-BLA infusion of blocking concentrations of
both nicotinic (nAChR) and muscarinic (mAChR) antagonists
significantly depressed fear learning (ANOVA; F(2,31) = 6.935,
p = 0.003; control, n = 17 versus mixed antagonists, n = 8,
p < 0.05) and enhanced the retention of extinction learning
compared with vehicle control (one-way ANOVA on ranks;
H = 6.417, df = 2, p = 0.04; control versus mixed antagonists
p < 0.05). In the nine mice infused with blocking concentrations
of mAChR antagonist alone, fear conditioning and extinction
were not significantly different from the vehicle control, consis-
tent with an important contribution of nAChR signaling. Post
hoc histological verification was used to confirm cannula place-
ments and virus expression in the BLA (Figure 2H).
Excitation of BLA Neurons by Optogenetic Stimulation of
Endogenous Cholinergic Input In Vivo
We next sought to investigate the circuit-level mechanisms that
might underlie the behavioral effects of optogenetic stimulation
or inhibition of cholinergic terminal fields in the BLA by combining
photostimulation and electrophysiological recording in vivo
(Figure 3). All in vivo experiments were conducted 3–4 weeks
following injection of AAV-DIO-oChIEFtdTomato into the NBM/
DB of ChAT-Cre mice. For a subset of these studies, we also em-
ployed broad-spectrum antagonists of AChRs to complement
the studies on the effects of halorhodopsin and to assess if the
effects of activating or inhibiting cholinergic terminal fields result
from release of ACh per se. In all in vivo recording studies,
animals were anesthetized and optical fibers, coupled to extra-
cellular recording electrodes, were stereotactically positioned
within the BLA to allow optogenetic stimulation of local cholin-
ergic terminal fields and simultaneous collection of extracellular
single-unit recordings from BLA principal neurons. Single units
were identified by a combination of template waveform matching
and cluster analysis of principal components (Figures 3 and S4).
A subset of studies utilized an ‘‘injectrode’’ configuration to
permit concurrent, local delivery of AChR antagonists.
The data presented in Figure 3 are from a total of 50 units
recorded in animals with oChIEF expression in the cholinergic
terminal fields within the BLA and with optical fiber and elec-
trode/injectrode placement confirmed post hoc. Early studies
examined the parameters for photostimulation and found that
responses were optimized at 100 pulses (Figure S3). Figure 3A
illustrates the experimental configuration for stimulation and
recording (top) and shows a representative raw data trace of
spike activity in one of the 38 regular-spiking BLA neurons stud-
ied (middle). The inset of two spike waveforms shown in the top
panel of Figure 3A illustrates the profile of a regular-spiking
BLA neuron (black) and a fast-spiking neuron (gray). Regular-
spiking BLA neurons, which have longer-duration action poten-
tials and lower firing rate than the briefer and faster-firing neu-
rons, comprise >75% of the isolated units and are considered
putative BLA principal neurons (Duvarci and Pare 2014). The
relatively rare, fast-firing neurons are thought to be BLA interneu-
rons and were not included in this study. Below the raw data
trace of this sample regular-spiking neuron is the corresponding
peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) of activity recorded for 20 s
before and after photostimulation of oChIEF expressed in cholin-
ergic inputs (5 s, 20 Hz, 473nm). Photostimulation of cholinergic
input to the BLA (indicated by the blue bars) elicited a robust in-
crease in firing rate in this BLA unit, from 0.5 Hz before photosti-
mulation to rates ranging from 2 to 6.5 Hz (average = 2.6 Hz) for
the 20 s following photostimulation (Figure 3A, bottom, and
Figure S3).
We next tested whether the observed increased firing of puta-
tive BLA principal neurons was dependent on the activation of
AChRs. We first tested the efficacy of a mixture of broad-spec-
trum muscarinic and nicotinic AChR antagonists delivered
locally to the recording site. Pooled data for 22 regular-spiking
BLA single units that were stably recorded through the control

 period and during and after intra-BLA infusion with the AChR
blockers are shown in the merged PSTHs (Figures 3B and S4).
The insets in Figure 3B show examples of spike waveforms
before, during, and after recovery from drug treatment. Control
and recovery conditions included intra-BLA infusion with
ACSF. The consistency of these waveforms suggests that it is
the same unit recorded under all three conditions. Additional
evaluation of the stability of recordings throughout these manip-
ulations was obtained by principal component analyses (Fig-
ure S4). All 22 of these regular-spiking units exhibited a
statistically significant increase in firing rate in response to pho-
tostimulation of cholinergic input under control conditions
(vehicle control; Figure 3B, top, and Figure 3C, left; R2 = 0.147;
p % 0.05). Injectrode delivery of both atropine and mecamyl-
amine (MEC) within the BLA resulted in a profound, but revers-
ible, decrease in baseline firing, as well as an ablation of the pho-
tostimulated increase in spiking activity of all of the units studied.
These findings are consistent with AChR-mediated effects of
photostimulation (Figures 3B and 3C, middle panel). In addition,
the notable decrease in baseline firing rate following delivery of
the AChR antagonist cocktail (but prior to photostimulation) is
consistent with control of baseline activity of putative BLA prin-
cipal neurons, at least in part, by ongoing activation of AChRs.
Both baseline activity and photostimulated increases in BLA
firing recovered to pre-antagonist levels following a 30–60 min
washout of the antagonist cocktail, and with infusion of the
vehicle control (Figures 3B and 3C, last panel). Following drug
washout, the average firing rate in the vehicle control returned
to �0.7 Hz ; the average firing with vehicle post-photostimulation
was increased to 1.0 Hz (R2 = 0.106; p % 0.05; Figure 3C, right).
A subset of experiments testing the effects of the nicotinic
AChR antagonist, MEC, alone revealed a qualitatively similar
profile to the mixed AChR antagonist cocktail. BLA unit baseline
firing was decreased, the photostimulated firing rate increase
was blocked, and both phenomena were fully recovered
following washout of MEC. As such, we conclude that nicotinic
AChRs contribute to both the baseline firing and the observed
increase in BLA firing elicited by photostimulation of cholinergic

infusion of artificial CSF (control), of both AChR antagonists (MEC + atropine, at 10 mM and 500 nM, respectively), and after antagonist washout (Recovery). During
the control period, photostimulation evoked a statistically significant increase in firing frequency (from 0.71 to 0.99 Hz). In the presence of MEC + atropine, the
baseline firing frequency was suppressed by more than 50% (0.32 Hz). Subsequent photostimulation in the presence of these AChR antagonists did not change
spike frequency. Both the baseline BLA firing rate and the excitatory response to photostimulation recovered after antagonist washout. Insets show sample
waveforms of representative units before, during, and after drug administration. Dotted lines show the average firing frequency obtained during the 20 s before

 inputs to the BLA (Figure 3E). These data are consistent with our
findings on effects of AChR antagonists on fear conditioning and
retention of extinction learning (Figure 2G).
To examine the temporal relationship between changes in
firing of regular-spiking BLA neurons and photostimulation of
the cholinergic terminal fields in BLA in vivo, we plotted cumula-
tive spike counts for all 38 regular-firing units and examined the
population data obtained for the 2,000 ms immediately before
and after the onset of the photostimulation (Figure 3D; 20 Hz
photostimulation indicated by vertical blue lines). This analysis
revealed interesting complexity in the temporal pattern of activity
following photostimulation of cholinergic terminal fields. The first
1–8 flashes elicited an immediate pause in firing that lasted
�400 ms (Figure 3D; inset). This brief pause was followed by a
sustained increase in firing frequency that remained elevated
for up to 30 min following termination of the photostimulation.
Photostimulation of Cholinergic Input in Acute Slice
Preparations
We next sought to examine the synaptic mechanisms by which
ACh exerts circuit-level effects in the BLA by combining photo-
stimulation of cholinergic terminal fields with whole-cell patch-
clamp recording from putative BLA principal neurons in ex vivo
(acute slice) preparations. All ex vivo recordings were from adult
mice of the same age as those tested in both the behavioral and
in vivo recording studies. First, we tested the effect of photoac-
tivation of oChIEF-expressing cholinergic input on firing rates of
putative BLA principal neurons (n = 21). The typical firing rate of
these neurons at rest potential (Vm = �55–60 mV) was extremely
low (<0.1–0.5 Hz; Figure 4Bi). Current injection to depolarize
the BLA neurons increases the baseline spike rate to 1 Hz
(Figure 4Bii). Under both of these recording conditions, 10 Hz
photostimulation of cholinergic terminal fields elicited a robust

Representative recording at resting membrane potential = �60 mV (n = 9 neurons). The spontaneous action potential frequency at rest potential (<0.1 Hz)

(D) Firing frequency ± photostimulation in sequential recordings from putative principal BLA neurons treated with muscarinic and/or nicotinic AChR antagonists
(mean ± SEM). Sequential recordings show robust increase in firing rate with the first round of photostimulation (p < 0.05, n = 3). Photostimulation in the presence
of atropine (0.5 mM) elicited a significant increase in firing (p < 0.05, n = 3). Following washout of atropine and wash in of MEC (10 mM), control baseline firing rates
were restored. Subsequent photostimulation in the presence of MEC was without significant effect. Recovery of photostimulated increase in firing was seen after
washout of MEC (p < 0.05, n = 3) Right: photostimulation with both MEC and atropine in the bath did not increase the firing rate. All data are presented normalized
to initial control firing rate. See also Figure S2.

 increase in firing rate that persisted above baseline rates for
5–35 min (Figure 4C).
The timing of detectable changes in membrane potential rela-
tive to the onset of photostimulation appeared to depend on the
prior state of the recorded neuron. In 9 of 12 neurons in which the
membrane potential was set to �50 mV by current injection,
photostimulation elicited a membrane hyperpolarization within
�80 ms of the first pulse (Figure 4Bii). Without current injection,
small (2–4 mV) depolarizations could be detected in 4 of 9 neu-
rons immediately after the first pulse (i.e., within the time required
to fully open the shutter, �8 ms). In all but one of the neurons
examined at their resting membrane potential (i.e., in the absence
of current injection), membrane hyperpolarization was not de-
tected. All 21 neurons studied by ex vivo current-clamp recording
displayed increased firing rate within 1–10 s of the onset of photo-
stimulation of the cholinergic terminal fields within the BLA, as
seen in the in vivo recordings. This increase in firing rate post-
photostimulation of the cholinergic inputs to BLA was seen
whether or not it was preceded by a transient hyperpolarization.
To further assess the AChR(s) that mediate the photosti-
mulation-induced increase in firing frequency, we repeated this
experiment in the presence of mAChR and nAChR antagonists.
Figure 4D presents data from sequential recordings in a subset
of neurons that met recording criteria throughout the time
required to test all four conditions (i.e., control ± photostimula-
tion, mAChR antagonist alone ± photostimulation, nAChR antag-
onist alone ± photostimulation, and recovery/post-control ±
photostimulation). The initial response to photostimulation was
a robust increase in firing (�43 control). After the firing rate
had returned to baseline or near baseline levels (10–30 min),
we tested the mAChR antagonist atropine. Atropine (0.5 mM)
did not block the increase in action potential firing elicited by
photostimulation. In some experiments, application of musca-
rinic antagonists appeared to somewhat increase baseline firing
frequency and augment the excitatory effects of photostimula-
tion (Figure 4D). The nAChR antagonist MEC significantly in-
hibited the increased firing frequency of BLA principal neurons
that was elicited by photostimulation (Figure 4D). The photosti-
mulated response completely recovered following washout of
all antagonists (Figure 4D). Overall, these sequential recordings
(Figure 4D), and a separate set of population recordings
with both muscarinic and nicotinic blockers (Figure 4D, right;
MEC + atropine ± photostimulation, n = 11; Wilcoxon rank-
sum test, p = 0.12), indicate that both mAChRs and nAChRs
appear to contribute to the changes in BLA excitability elicited
by photoactivation of cholinergic terminal fields. Thus, endoge-
nous ACh released by stimulation of the NBM projections to
the BLA—with the same pattern as used in our behavioral and
in vivo recording studies—increased BLA pyramidal neuron
excitability by activating AChRs. In view of the effects of AChR
antagonists on baseline firing, ongoing AChR activity may influ-
ence resting activity ex vivo as it does in vivo.
Endogenous ACh Signaling Modulates Glutamatergic
Synaptic Transmission in BLA
The observed increase in suprathreshold activity following
photostimulation of oChIEF-expressing cholinergic terminal
fields in BLA could arise by direct and/or indirect actions of
ACh. We probed the synaptic mechanisms that contribute to
the enhanced firing of BLA neurons seen following optogenetic
stimulation by assessing whether photostimulation of endoge-
nous ACh inputs elicited changes in glutamatergic transmission
in the BLA. We examined tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant, glutama-
tergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (Figures 5A and
5B) in putative BLA principal neurons. Voltage-clamp recordings
collected in the presence of both TTX and bicuculline (to block
Na+-channel- and GABA-A-receptor-mediated changes in excit-
ability, respectively) revealed a baseline rate of glutamatergic
transmission (EPSCs) at �2 Hz. Following a 10 Hz burst of photo-
stimulation of the cholinergic inputs to the BLA, the TTX-resis-
tant, glutamatergic EPSC frequency increased significantly
without changing amplitude, consistent with an increase in
release probability (Figures 5A and 5B; TTX-resistant EPSC fre-
quency, p < 0.01, n = 11, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test;
amplitude, p = 0.2, n = 11, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
Assessment of cumulative data also indicated a significant
decrease in interevent intervals without a significant shift in the
cumulative distribution of TTX-resistant EPSC amplitudes (Fig-
ure 5B; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; ISI [interstimulus interval],
p < 0.01; amplitude, p = 0.9; n = 11). The basic AChR pharma-
cology of photostimulated changes in TTX-resistant EPSCs
matched that seen in our studies of photostimulated changes
in BLA firing. Photostimulation of oChIEF-expressing cholinergic
input significantly increased the TTX-resistant EPSC frequency
in the presence or absence of atropine (0.5 mM atropine; pre-
versus post-photostimulation, 0.97 Hz versus 1.27 Hz, n = 10,
p = 0.002), whereas MEC abolished the facilitation of TTX-resis-
tant EPSCs induced by photostimulation of cholinergic terminal
fields (pre- versus post-photostimulation, 0.96 Hz versus
0.84 Hz, n = 7, p = 0.8).
The TTX-resistant, glutamatergic EPSC activity assessed
above arises from all glutamatergic inputs to the BLA principal
neurons. We next asked whether photostimulation of oChIEF-
expressing cholinergic terminal fields in BLA would alter the pro-
file of stimulus-evoked glutamatergic transmission (eEPSCs;
Figures 5C and 5D). Cortical afferents to the BLA in the external
capsule (EC) were electrically stimulated (Figure 5C). Prior
studies testing paired-pulse stimulation of cortical-BLA synap-
ses over a 20–200 ms ISI revealed robust paired-pulse facilita-
tion in young (pre-weaning) mice in response to a 50 ms ISI,
consistent with low release probability synapses (paired-pulse
ratio �1.5; Jiang and Role, 2008). Using the same stimulation
protocol in the 2- to 3-month-old mice studied here, a more
modest paired-pulse facilitation was seen (Figures 5C and 5D).
Following photostimulation (10 Hz), the amplitudes of both the
first (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05, n = 8) and sec-
ond (p < 0.05, n = 8) paired-pulse eEPSCs were significantly
increased, consistent with photostimulation eliciting increased
glutamate release and/or increased postsynaptic responsive-
ness (Figures 5C and 5D). The paired-pulse ratio was not
different following photostimulation of cholinergic input (pre-
versus post-photostimulation, 1.28 ± 0.17 versus 1.08 ± 0.07,
p = 0.29, n = 8, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), although the trend to-
ward a decrease is consistent with the increase in release prob-
ability revealed by the analysis of TTX-resistant glutamatergic
EPSCs (Figures 5A and 5B).

 Photo Stimulation of Cholinergic Input Enhances
Plasticity of Cortical-BLA Excitatory Transmission
Because of the established literature linking synaptic plasticity to
learning and memory, and prior studies demonstrating nAChR
potentiation of glutamatergic transmission in regions related to
mnemonic processing (Dani and Bertrand 2007; Halff et al.,
2014; Zhang et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2013), we tested whether
endogenous ACh signaling in the BLA might exert long-lasting
changes in cortical-BLA synaptic transmission. The studies pre-
sented in Figures 6 and 7 examine possible synaptic plasticity
correlates for the observed, persistent changes in fear-related
behaviors following manipulation of endogenous ACh signaling
in the BLA in awake-behaving mice (Figure 2).
Theta-burst (q) stimulation of cortical-BLA circuits reliably
elicits a transient potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic trans-
mission. Pairing q stimulation with exposure to nicotine lowers
the threshold for activation of long-term potentiation (Jiang
et al., 2013; Jiang and Role 2008; Mansvelder and McGehee
2000). To examine whether photoactivation of oChIEF-express-
ing cholinergic inputs in the BLA altered the profile of glutamater-
gic synaptic transmission before and after q stimulation of
cortical-BLA synapses, we evoked transmission with ‘‘minimal’’
stimulation of the EC, i.e., at a stimulation strength of sufficiently
low intensity to evoke a steady-state response rate of �50%
successes at 0.1 Hz stimulation (Figure 6A, control; Figure 6B,
first 8 min). A single q stimulation of the EC typically elicited a
brief potentiation reflected in a transient increase in the evoked
response success rate and/or an increase in eEPSC amplitude
that returned to baseline within 3–5 min (Figures 6A and 6B;
q alone).
Pairing the q stimulation with 10 Hz photostimulation of
oChIEF-expressing cholinergic inputs elicited a sustained poten-
tiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, with a significant
increase in both the stimulus-evoked response success rate and
in the eEPSC amplitude. Cortical-BLA transmission remained
elevated for the duration of the recording (53 min; Figure 6B).
Pooled data from 11 experiments in which q stimulation alone
elicited brief potentiation of minimally evoked eEPSCs shows
that pairing of q stimulation of cortical-BLA inputs with optoge-
netic activation of cholinergic inputs significantly enhanced
cortical-BLA glutamate release probability and eEPSC ampli-
tude compared with either control or with q stimulation alone
(Figure 6C; post q + photostimulation versus control, amplitude,
p < 0.01, success probability [Ps], p < 0.01; post q + photostimu-
lation versus post q alone, amplitude, p < 0.01, Ps, p < 0.05;
paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Repeat q stimulation did not

(p < 0.01, n = 11). There was no statistically significant effect on TTX-resistant glutamatergic EPSC amplitude.

 result in sustained potentiation of cortical-BLA synapses (Fig-
ure S6). Thus, pairing of q stimulation of cortical inputs with pho-
tostimulation of oChIEF-expressing cholinergic inputs to the BLA
was sufficient to convert short-term enhancement of cortical-
BLA glutamatergic transmission into a long-lasting potentiation
by increasing both the probability of evoked glutamate release
and the magnitude of evoked postsynaptic responses in
cortical-BLA circuits.
To assess whether cholinergic stimulation per se might be suf-
ficient to induce plasticity of cortical-BLA circuits, we examined
the ability of patterned photostimulation of cholinergic inputs to
strengthen evoked excitatory cortical-BLA transmission in the
absence of any pairing protocol (Figure 7A). We found that a
burst of 100 (10 bursts at 10 Hz) flashes of 473 nm light could
elicit long-lasting potentiation of glutamatergic transmission
evoked by minimal stimulation of the cortical input (long-term
potentiation [LTP] R 35–78 min; Figures 7A and 7B). The LTP
was reflected both in statistically significant increases in the
probability of evoked responses to minimal intensity stimulation
(paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p < 0.05, n = 7) and an increase
in the amplitude of the postsynaptic (glutamatergic) eEPSCs
(paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p < 0.01, n = 10; Figure 7C).
Control studies demonstrate that 10 Hz 3 10 s exposure to
473 nm light in a ChAT-tauGFP (non-opsin) mouse does not
affect synaptic transmission (Figure S2D). Photostimulation of
oChIEF-expressing cholinergic inputs in the presence of AChR
antagonists had no effect on synaptic plasticity (n = 19). Taken
together, these studies suggest that photostimulated release
of endogenous ACh can not only lower the threshold for synaptic
plasticity in a paired stimulation protocol but that activation of
cholinergic inputs alone is sufficient to elicit LTP of glutamatergic
transmission in cortical-BLA circuits.
DISCUSSION
Our key findings are as follows: (1) a single period of patterned
stimulation or inhibition of cholinergic terminal fields in the BLA
during conditioned fear training was sufficient to alter fear
learning and the retention of extinction learning; (2) endogenous
cholinergic signaling is required for normal fear learning and for
the retention of extinction; (3) endogenous cholinergic signaling
modulates the excitability of putative BLA principal neurons
via interaction with both muscarinic and nicotinic AChRs; ACh
signaling within the BLA regulates firing rates in a similar manner
in vivo and ex vivo; and (4) endogenous ACh modulates the
threshold for LTP ex vivo. The fact that stimulation of cholinergic
terminal fields in the BLA is sufficient to induce LTP at cortical-
BLA synapses and to drive persistent increases in BLA neuronal
spiking both in vivo and ex vivo supports our proposal that the
manipulation of cholinergic tone within the BLA regulates cue-
conditioned fear learning and retention of fear extinction behav-
iors by mechanisms that involve ACh signaling per se (Figure 8).
This study provides direct evidence for an essential role of
cholinergic input to the amygdala in the formation and retention
of one of the best studied emotionally salient memories: fear. Our
findings underscore that ACh is more than just a modulator of
fear memories; ACh is a requisite component of conditioned
fear learning. We propose that the cholinergic regulation of fear
learning derives, at least in part, from the effects of ACh on
the excitability of, and the glutamatergic transmission to, the

EC that did not elicit a postsynaptic response (i.e., failures) are indicated by amplitudes of 0 pA. The number of failures was briefly reduced after q stimulation
alone. Thirty minutes following q stimulation + photostimulation of the cholinergic terminal fields, failures were eliminated (i.e., eEPSC success probability ap-
proached 100%). The amplitude of eEPSCs briefly increased after q stimulation alone, whereas enhancement of eEPSC amplitude was sustained for the duration
of the recording after pairing of q stimulation and photostimulation.

(p < 0.03, n = 11). Paired q stimulation plus optogenetic stimulation also significantly increased the population eEPSC amplitude (p < 0.001, n = 11). The increase
induced by q stimulation plus photostimulation was significantly greater than the increase induced by q stimulation alone. Bottom: success rate was not increased
by q stimulation alone. A significant increase was seen after paired stimulation (p = 0.007, n = 8). See also Figures S2 and S5.

 principal neurons in the BLA. Our antagonist studies in vivo and
ex vivo underscore that it is ACh per se, rather than other co-
stored and/or co-released transmitters (Higley et al., 2011; Ren
et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2015), that is responsible for the
observed effects on behavior and on BLA neuronal excitability.
The current in vivo electrophysiological studies also provide
support to the notion that ACh can act rapidly and exert pro-
longed changes in network excitability (Chen et al., 2015, Egger-
mann et al., 2014, Luchicchi et al., 2014, Sarter et al., 2014). In
the BLA, brief photoactivation of cholinergic terminal fields eli-
cited rapid changes in action potential firing (tdelay = 62 ms; Fig-
ure 3D) or in membrane potential (tdelay = 10–100 ms) and
slower but prolonged increases in firing rates of putative prin-
cipal neurons (Figures 3 and 4). In other in vivo recording studies
in which we assessed the action potential firing elicited by photo-
activation of the cholinergic neurons in the NBM per se and the
consequent enhancement of BLA neuronal firing, the tdelay
was about six times longer––but still consistent with the ‘‘rapid
ACh transients’’ reported by Sarter et al. (Sarter et al., 2014).
We used acute slice electrophysiological recording to analyze
the circuit and synaptic mechanisms that might underlie the sus-
tained changes in learning and the enhanced BLA excitability
following in vivo manipulation of cholinergic inputs to the BLA.
Although less direct than in vivo assays, our ex vivo findings
are
also
consistent
with
AChR-mediated
potentiation
of
cortical-amygdala glutamatergic transmission that can persist
for >1 hr after the initial ACh signaling has occurred. Photostimu-
lation of cholinergic projections enhances the probability of
glutamate release and the magnitude of evoked EPSPs in
cortical-BLA circuits, and lowers the threshold for LTP. These
modulatory effects of endogenous ACh are strikingly reminiscent
of the effects of brief, low-dosage exposure of cortical-BLA syn-
apses to nicotine (Jiang et al., 2013; Jiang and Role 2008).
Indeed, in all of our studies, nAChRs were an essential compo-
nent of the observed effects of cholinergic stimulation. Inhibition
of both nAChR and mAChR activity by intra-BLA infusion of an-
tagonists during training inhibits conditioned fear learning and
enhances extinction, whereas mAChR block alone does not.
Likewise, nAChR antagonists blocked the increased excitability
observed in response to photostimulation in vivo, and blocking
nAChRs alone significantly lowered the baseline firing rate of
BLA neurons in vivo. These data are consistent with a role for
ongoing activation of AChRs in setting the steady-state level of
BLA firing.
Both our in vivo and ex vivo studies show that the net effect of
cholinergic input is to increase excitability. Recent studies have
demonstrated that a subset of neurons within the amygdala is
activated both during conditioned fear learning and during recall.
Direct stimulation of these BLA neurons can elicit fear behaviors,
providing strong evidence that these neurons are part of a mem-
ory trace (Nonaka et al., 2014; Redondo et al., 2014). The likeli-
hood that a neuron is recruited into the memory trace is related
to the excitability of the neuron: electrophysiological studies
demonstrate altered presynaptic plasticity of cortical inputs
to BLA neurons in the memory trace (Nonaka et al., 2014; Yiu
et al., 2014). Our findings that endogenous ACh modulates the
excitability of principal neurons in the BLA, regulates cortical-
BLA synaptic plasticity, and influences the acquisition of fear-
related behaviors argue strongly for a critical role of ACh modu-
lation in amygdala-based learning and memory.
Our findings that the net effect of cholinergic input is to in-
crease excitability contrast with the conclusions of a recent
report of net inhibitory actions of photostimulation of cholinergic
inputs to BLA (Unal et al., 2015). The dissimilarity of our results
most likely derives from differences in recording paradigms
and/or in the stimulation protocol for photoactivation of cholin-
ergic inputs. We find that photostimulation of cholinergic inputs
with current injection to depolarize the recorded BLA neurons
elicits a transient hyperpolarization, followed by the slower,
longer-lasting increases in BLA excitability that are seen in vivo

 and ex vivo in neurons at rest potential. The photostimulation
paradigms are also somewhat different; we adopted the
specific protocols for cholinergic terminal field stimulation in
our in vivo and ex vivo studies based on what we had found
to be effective in changing the associative fear learning of the an-
imals (Table S1).
In all of our studies of photostimulation of cholinergic input
to BLA principal neurons, we observed only three direct, light-
evoked postsynaptic responses (Figure S6). In these instances,
the recorded responses were fast, inward synaptic currents.
The rarity of this result underscores that under our conditions,
the predominant effect of photostimulation of cholinergic input
in BLA is modulation of glutamatergic transmission rather than
direct activation of postsynaptic receptors.
Overall, we find that stimulation of endogenous ACh release
during exposure to conditioned fear training results in a more
persistent memory of the learned fear. Equally important is
that interference with cholinergic input to the BLA during fear
training ablates the formation of the memory and results in a
rapid return to control behaviors following extinction training.
In view of the key role of ACh in attention, cue detection, and
mnemonic processing (Sarter et al., 2014), as well as the
relationship between cholinergic degeneration and the progres-
sive loss of short-term memory in diseases such as Alzheimer’s
disease, the use of cholinergic enhancement therapies for
pro-cognitive treatments remains an area of intense study.
Likewise, the more anecdotal but intriguing literature poten-
tially linking nicotine exposure to the exacerbation of cued
memory recall, as in post-traumatic stress disorder (Rasmus-
son et al., 2006), makes it tempting to speculate that manipula-
tion of endogenous cholinergic signaling in specific terminal
fields might provide novel treatment approaches to memory
dysfunction.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse use was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at Stony Brook University.
Viral Delivery
ChAT-Cre mice (post-natal day [P]21 to P30) were infected in the NBM
with AAV9-CAG-DIO-oChIEF-tdTomato, AAV9-Ef1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP, or
AAV9-CAG-DIO-eGFP. Viral stocks were obtained from the UNC vector core.
Behavioral Testing
Animals underwent cue-associated fear conditioning and extinction training
with either photostimulation or locally delivered AChR antagonists within the
BLA. Details of the behavioral paradigms used are presented in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures and Table S1.
Electrophysiological Recording
In vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings were done in the BLA and in
the NBM. The procedures used for electrophysiological recordings, photosti-
mulation, and drug delivery are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Statistics
Statistical analyses of electrophysiological data typically used non-parametric
statistical tests including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov for cumulative distributions
with n > 1000, Mann-Whitney, and paired-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test
with Origin 9.1. The median values are reported from the entire population
tested. The ex vivo electrophysiological data are from 153 recordings from
62 mice. Unless otherwise noted, n values reported are numbers of recordings.
Behavioral data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney, and one- and two-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

Figure 8. Proposed Mechanism for Effect of BLA Cholinergic Tone
on Conditioned Fear Learning and Retention of Extinction Learning
Behaviors
Fear conditioned mice freeze in response to tone (Recall). The freezing
response decreases following several days of multiple tone exposures.
Enhancing endogenous cholinergic signaling in the BLA during conditioned
fear training did not alter freezing behavior assayed 24 hr later, but decreased
the response to the extinction sessions, consistent with the fear memory
being more persistent over long periods of time. In contrast, reducing
cholinergic signaling in the BLA during the initial training period reduced the
freezing behavior during recall and led to greater retention of the extinction
learning.
