Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist has fostered safe
practice for 10 years, yet its place in emergency surgery has not been assessed on a global scale. The aim
of this study was to evaluate reported checklist use in emergency settings and examine the relationship
with perioperative mortality in patients who had emergency laparotomy.
Methods: In two multinational cohort studies, adults undergoing emergency laparotomy were compared
with those having elective gastrointestinal surgery. Relationships between reported checklist use and
mortality were determined using multivariable logistic regression and bootstrapped simulation.
Results: Of 12 296 patients included from 76 countries, 4843 underwent emergency laparotomy. After
adjusting for patient and disease factors, checklist use before emergency laparotomy was more common
in countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI) (2455 of 2741, 89⋅6 per cent) compared
with that in countries with a middle (753 of 1242, 60⋅6 per cent; odds ratio (OR) 0⋅17, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅14
to 0⋅21, P < 0⋅001) or low (363 of 860, 42⋅2 per cent; OR 0⋅08, 0⋅07 to 0⋅10, P < 0⋅001) HDI. Checklist
use was less common in elective surgery than for emergency laparotomy in high-HDI countries (risk
difference −9⋅4 (95 per cent c.i. −11⋅9 to −6⋅9) per cent; P < 0⋅001), but the relationship was reversed in
low-HDI countries (+12⋅1 (+7⋅0 to +17⋅3) per cent; P < 0⋅001). In multivariable models, checklist use was
associated with a lower 30-day perioperative mortality (OR 0⋅60, 0⋅50 to 0⋅73; P < 0⋅001). The greatest
absolute benefit was seen for emergency surgery in low- and middle-HDI countries.
Conclusion: Checklist use in emergency laparotomy was associated with a significantly lower perioper-
ative mortality rate. Checklist use in low-HDI countries was half that in high-HDI countries.

Introduction
The volume of surgical procedures performed worldwide
is large1 and, although many advances have been made
in the past several decades, surgical care exposes patients
to substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. The safety
of surgical care has gained traction within the global
health landscape, yet it remains a pressing concern in both
resource-rich and -poor settings2. In 2009, the WHO
released a 19-item surgical safety checklist for implemen-
tation in countries around the world3. The checklist was
designed to promote understanding and cohesive commu-
nication, and to ensure good practice among all surgical
team members at three specific intervals: before induction
of anaesthesia, before skin incision, and before the patient
leaves the operating theatre3. Although the improvement
in outcomes was dramatic4, uptake of this safety tool
remains to be quantified on a large scale. Attention sur-
rounding use of the checklist in resource-limited settings
is of particular relevance to surgical care and outcomes4.
Process-related discrepancies, such as lack of a particu-
lar safe practice protocol, are chief contributors to adverse
surgical events5. Despite the potential benefits of check-
list use, there are numerous barriers to implementation6,
7.
Dynamic educational and social factors, such as ambi-
guity and confusion around the purpose of the checklist
and negative attitudes to checklist adoption among some
team members, contribute to poor checklist uptake8,

addition, in settings where resources are limited, comple-
tion of a checklist that focuses on unavailable items can
seem pointless, for instance in the absence of pulse oxime-
try or antibiotics10,
11. Despite these barriers to implemen-
tation and completion, it has been suggested5 that absence
of the checklist itself may serve as a major contributor to
adverse surgical events.
Although data supporting the effectiveness of the
checklist in fostering improved surgical outcomes are
encouraging, studies in globally representative populations
are uncommon. Furthermore, checklist outcomes have
been studied largely within elective general surgery and
subspecialty settings, with only a few studies examining
checklist use in emergency care12,
13. Attitudes to checklist
use by providers working in emergency settings can be
negative12. A survey of obstetric care providers found that
one-third believed a checklist would be an inconvenience
in emergencies14. Despite this, the benefit of checklist use
does extend to emergency surgical care, as shown in an
analysis of the original WHO checklist study in urgent
operations across eight countries13. Importantly, it is also
possible that the benefit of the checklist may be greatest in
emergency situations, given the increased risks15.
Using a large, validated, global data set, this study aimed
to compare reported use of the WHO Surgical Safety
Checklist in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy
and elective gastrointestinal surgery. Associations were
sought between checklist use and perioperative mortal-
ity, accounting for country developmental level as well as
patient and disease factors.
Methods
Study design and participants
Data were collected prospectively within two international,
multicentre, observational cohort studies: GlobalSurg 116
and GlobalSurg 217. Both studies were performed by
the GlobalSurg Collaborative group using prespecified
published protocols (NCT0217911218, NCT0266223119).
This
collaborative
methodology
has
been
described
elsewhere20. A UK National Health Service Research
Ethics review considered both GlobalSurg 1 and Glob-
alSurg
2
exempt
from
formal
research
registration
(South East Scotland Research Ethics Service, refer-
ences
NR/1404AB12
and
NR/1510AB5).
Individual
centres obtained their own audit, ethical or institutional
approval. Details of data validation have been described
and published previously16,
17. Results of this analysis
are reported according to Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
guidelines21.
In both contributing studies, investigators from health-
care facilities worldwide that fulfilled the inclusion cri-
teria were invited to participate and submit data using
an online platform22. Small teams of investigators were
recruited via email, social media and through personal
contacts. Investigators collected data during at least one
2-week interval during study windows. In GlobalSurg
1, investigators identified consecutive patients between 1
July 2014 and 21 December 201416. This study included
any patient undergoing emergency intraperitoneal surgery,
defined in the study methods16. In GlobalSurg 2, investiga-
tors included consecutive patients between 4 January 2016
and 31 July 201617. This study included all patients under-
going elective or emergency gastrointestinal surgery17.
In both studies, patients were followed to day 30 after
surgery, or for the duration of their inpatient stay in
locations where follow-up was not feasible. Local inves-
tigators uploaded records to a secure online database,
using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
system23.
Data from both GlobalSurg 1 and GlobalSurg 2 were
combined to create a multicentre data set. Variables were
cross-referenced and streamlined for coding consistency.
Patients were then selected as having undergone emer-
gency laparotomy or elective gastrointestinal surgery.
Emergency laparotomy was captured using the defini-
tion from the UK National Emergency Laparotomy
Audit24, adapted for global settings. Trauma laparotomy
was included, whereas laparoscopic procedures and indi-
viduals aged less than 18 years were not included in the
analysis.
Variables
The primary outcome measure was 30-day perioperative
mortality, expressed as a proportion. Perioperative mortal-
ity was defined as ‘
any death, regardless of cause, occur-
ring within 30 days of surgery in or out of the hospital’
25.
The metric was calculated by dividing the number of peri-
operative deaths by the total number of included opera-
tions performed26. The primary explanatory variable was
reported use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist.
Checklist use was recorded as ‘
no, not available’
, ‘
no, but
available’
, ‘
yes’
, or ‘
unknown’for each patient in the study.
Reported use of the checklist was calculated as a proportion
recorded as ‘
yes’of the total number of patients included.
Countries were stratified into three tertiles according to
the Human Development Index (HDI) rank27. This is a
composite statistic of life expectancy, education and income
indices published by the United Nations. HDI was chosen
over purely economic measures of country development

on the principle that ‘
people and their capabilities should
be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a
country, not economic growth alone’
27.
Patient-level variables included age, sex, diabetes, smok-
ing status and ASA fitness grade. For simplification, ASA
was grouped as a score of less than III and one of III or
more. Disease-level variables included six major diag-
nostic groups: abdominal wall, benign foregut, benign
midgut/hindgut, malignancy, trauma/injury and other.
Operative characteristics, including the requirement for a
bowel resection and the level of contamination, were also
included.
Power considerations
GlobalSurg 1 and GlobalSurg 2 both included a priori
sample size calculations that accounted for the uncertainty
in the data coming from collaborating countries18,
19. In
making between-group comparisons of checklist use by
HDI country or urgency, a difference from 10 to 5 per cent
can be shown with α = 5 per cent and β = 10 per cent (90 per
cent power) with group sizes of 582.
Statistical analysis
Differences between HDI tertiles were tested with Pear-
son’
s χ2 test and Kruskal–Wallis test for categorical and
continuous variables respectively. Multivariable logistic
regression models were used to adjust for confounding in
analyses of checklist use and 30-day perioperative mortal-
ity. Coefficients are expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95
per cent confidence intervals and P values derived from
percentiles of 10 000 bootstrap replications. Models were
constructed using the following principles: variables asso-
ciated with outcome measures in previous studies were
accounted for; demographic variables were included in
model exploration; all first-order interactions were checked
and included in final models if found to be influential;
final model selection was informed using a criterion-based
approach minimizing the Akaike information criterion and
discrimination determined using the c-statistic (area under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve). Hier-
archical models accounting for clustering within countries
were not used in this analysis owing to colinearity between
explanatory variables of interest and country. Model resid-
uals were checked (residuals versus fitted values; normality
plot of standardized deviance residuals; and residuals versus
leverage), and goodness of model fit determined using the
Hosmer–Lemeshow test.
T
o help translate model outputs to real-life quantities
of interest, bootstrapped simulations of model predictions
were performed at specified co-variable levels. This enables
the results of regression analyses to be expressed as proba-
bilities, with the intention of these being more intuitive to
interpret than ORs.
All analyses were undertaken using the R Foundation
statistical program R 3.4.14, with finalfit28 and dplyr
packages (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).
Data sharing
The data set can be explored using an online visualization
application at http://data.globalsurg.org.
Results
A total of 26 228 patient records were sourced from
the GlobalSurg 1 (10 745, 41⋅0 per cent) and GlobalSurg
2 (15 483, 59⋅0 per cent) data sets (Fig. 1). For 552 patients
(2⋅1 per cent) 30-day mortality and/or checklist use was not
known; these were removed. Patterns of missing data were
examined and not considered to influence final results
(Tables S1 and S2, supporting information). For 13 380
patients (51⋅0 per cent) the inclusion criteria were not
fulfilled, and these were removed; reasons included under-
going an emergency procedure other than emergency
laparotomy and age less than 18 years. The included pro-
cedures by country HDI are shown in Table S3 (supporting
information). The final data set represents 12 296 patients
from 76 countries, with 326 centres from GlobalSurg 116
and 356 centres from GlobalSurg 217.
Demographics
Extensive data relating to patient and operative charac-
teristics by HDI group and surgery type are provided
in Tables S4–S6 (supporting information) to allow a full
understanding of the population. Patients were distributed
across HDI groups as shown in Fig. 1. Patients undergoing
emergency laparotomy were older, more likely to be men,
had a higher ASA score, were less likely to have cancer,
and had a higher rate of wound contamination (Table S4,
supporting information). Those undergoing emergency
laparotomy in low-HDI compared with high-HDI coun-
tries were younger, more likely to be men, had a lower
ASA score, were less likely to have had a bowel resec-
tion or cancer, and more likely to have wound contamina-
tion (Table S5, supporting information). Similar differences
were seen in the elective surgery group (Table S6, support-
ing information).

Use of WHO Surgical Safety Checklist
Reported WHO Surgical Safety Checklist use across
the entire cohort was 8881 of 12 296 (72⋅2 per cent).
There was little difference in checklist use overall when
comparing emergency laparotomy with elective surgery
(73⋅7 versus 71⋅2 per cent respectively). Checklist use dif-
fered in high- (84⋅5 per cent) compared with middle- (59⋅4
per cent) and low- (47⋅3 per cent) HDI country groups
(Table 1).
A multivariable regression model was used to adjust
for confounding and identify predictors of checklist use
(Table S7, supporting information). A significant interac-
tion was found between type of surgery and country HDI
for checklist use: the patterns of checklist use by surgery
type were different across HDI groups. After adjusting for
patient and operative characteristics, checklist use contin-
ued to be lower in low- and middle-HDI countries (Fig. 2a).
T
o convey differences in checklist use more intuitively,
bootstrapped predicted probabilities of checklist use were
determined (Table 2). Absolute risk differences for emer-
gency laparotomy versus elective surgery differed by HDI
group. Checklist use was less common for elective surgery
than emergency laparotomy in the high-HDI group (abso-
lute risk difference −9⋅4 (95 per cent c.i. −11⋅9 to −6⋅9)
per cent; P < 0⋅001), no different in the middle-HDI group
(1⋅9 (−2⋅3 to 6⋅5) per cent; P = 0⋅357) and more com-
mon in the low-HDI group (12⋅1 (7⋅0 to 17⋅3) per cent;
P < 0⋅001).
Mortality in emergency laparotomy
Overall, 30-day mortality after emergency laparotomy
(621 of 4843, 12⋅8 per cent) was ten-times higher than
for elective surgery (94 of 7453, 1⋅3 per cent) (Table S8, sup-
porting information). There was notable variation in mor-
tality after elective surgery by HDI group, but less variation
after emergency laparotomy in the unadjusted analysis.
However, after adjustment for confounding, significant dif-
ferences were seen in 30-day mortality after emergency
laparotomy in low- (OR 2⋅43, 95 per cent c.i. 1⋅81 to
3⋅25; P < 0⋅001) and middle- (2⋅80, 2⋅20 to 3⋅56; P < 0⋅001)
HDI groups compared with the high-HDI group (Fig. 2b;
Table S8, supporting information). Thirty-day mortality
after elective surgery in low-HDI countries was equiva-
lent to 30-day mortality after emergency laparotomy in
high-HDI countries.
Use of checklist and 30-day mortality
Overall, reported use of the WHO Surgical Safety Check-
list was associated with a lower 30-day mortality (471 of
8881, 5⋅3 per cent) compared with reported non-use (244
of 3415, 7⋅1 per cent) (Table S8, supporting information).
In models adjusting for confounders, reported use of the
checklist was still associated with a significantly lower
30-day mortality (OR 0⋅60, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅50 to 0⋅73;
P < 0⋅001). Again, to create a more intuitive interpretation
of the mortality model, adjusted predicted probabilities

of 30-day mortality were created to allow comparisons
across HDI group, surgery type and reported checklist
use (Fig. 3; Table S9, supporting information). No inter-
action between checklist use and 30-day mortality was
seen for HDI or type of surgery. Thus, as expected, a
significant checklist effect was seen for each combination
of surgery type and HDI group, with magnitudes of
effect shown in Fig. 3. The greatest absolute risk differ-
ence for checklist use was seen in emergency surgery in
low-HDI (absolute risk reduction 4⋅6 (95 per cent c.i.
2⋅7 to 7⋅0) per cent; P < 0⋅001) and middle-HDI (5⋅1

information).

Discussion
In this large multinational prospective cohort study,
reported use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist
was associated with a significant reduction in 30-day
perioperative mortality. This relationship was consistent
and independent of key patient and disease-related vari-
ables. Checklist use in low-HDI countries was half that
of high-HDI countries, and this effect persisted after
accounting for differences in patient and disease charac-
teristics. Checklist use was lower for elective surgery than
for emergency laparotomy in high-HDI countries; this
finding was unexpected. The association between checklist
use and lower mortality was consistent across HDI groups
and type of surgery, even after adjustment for case mix.
The greatest absolute benefits were found in emergency
surgery in low- and middle-HDI countries, owing to the
higher baseline mortality rate.
Evidence supporting use of the surgical safety checklist
in hospital practice is widely positive and supports the
promotion of the checklist in patient safety programmes
worldwide2. A strength of this study is the breadth of
countries and hospitals that contributed prospectively
collected data. Use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist
in low- and middle-income countries was 2928 of 5248
(55⋅8 per cent), the same as that reported in the recent

GlobalSurg Collaborative
African Surgical Outcomes Study (6183 of 10 836, 57⋅1
per cent)29. In the present study, checklist use was found
to be significantly lower in some low- and middle-HDI
countries compared with high-HDI countries, yet the
association with lower mortality was still seen. This clearly
highlights an area for practice change. Fostering aware-
ness to motivate local checklist champions is important,
but may be difficult in more remote environments. In
regions with less established local organizational infras-
tructure, the checklist may simply have not come to the
attention of providers. Supportive governmental and aca-
demic institutions are crucial in facilitating the process,
through continued professional development and ministry
of health-accredited programmes30. Successful implemen-
tation of the checklist requires careful thought and local
adaptation. Avoiding the perception of the checklist as just
a ‘
tickbox’exercise is crucial for success9.
This study explored the hypothesis that checklist use is
lower in emergency settings due to the particular chal-
lenges therein. Focus on emergency laparotomy provided
a more homogeneous study group, rather than including
all patients undergoing emergency surgery. Checklist use
has been studied extensively in elective surgery, but has
received less attention in emergency surgery, particularly in
global settings13. Narratives that highlight time pressures,
low staffing, inflexible hierarchies and lack of resources
during times of emergency promote an idea that the check-
list should not be prioritized in urgent care. The present
study shows that the checklist can be used in emergency
settings, and commonly is. Moreover, associations between
checklist use and better outcomes are just as evident in
emergency laparotomy as in elective surgery. The capacity
for checklist implementation in settings providing emer-
gency surgical care should not be undervalued. On the con-
trary, there may be much to gain for emergency surgery in
low- and middle-income settings, given the higher baseline
mortality rate.
A number of weaknesses to the approach taken here
may be discussed. In general, the methodology is subject
to selection bias at hospital level. Collaborators self-select
to take part, which may reflect better resourced institu-
tions contributing than is seen in the general population.
During the study period, consecutive patients must be
recruited so that selection bias at patient level is minimized.
Data were validated particularly carefully in the Global-
Surg 2 study17. As described previously, patient recruitment
together with a subset of variables were re-collected by
an independent team in contributing hospitals. In centres
with the fewest resources, this can be a challenge, partic-
ularly where there are no formal written records. Some
collaborators described the GlobalSurg data as of better
quality than what was otherwise available within their
hospital.
With regard to checklist use itself, collaborators sim-
ply reported whether a WHO Surgical Safety Checklist
had been used before surgery. No review was undertaken
of what form the checklist took, what local adaptations
may have been introduced, whether there was broad team
acceptance of the process, or whether the implementa-
tion was deemed successful. Self-reported checklist use is
a poor reflection of meaningful compliance with checklist
items31, and partial compliance reduces the positive ben-
efits on outcomes derived from this32. Furthermore, the
use and appropriate implementation of a surgical safety
checklist may represent a wide range of health service sys-
tem characteristics, including organizational and manage-
ment attributes that support good clinical practices. Facil-
ities reporting high use may also be those with significant
resources, staffed by individuals familiar with key patient
safety concepts who work together to ensure reliable sys-
tems are in place to deliver consistent patient care.
This study shows that the WHO Surgical Safety Check-
list can be used in emergency surgery in resource-poor
settings. The association with lower mortality is likely
to reflect broader health system differences that priori-
tize safe and effective surgical care, yet the checklist plays
an important part. Much of the benefit is likely to come
from behaviours that can be difficult to measure, such as
improved communication, better team work, identification
of potential problems before they occur, and empowerment
of members of staff at all levels. The checklist likely helps
improve surgical safety by providing a framework for focus-
ing teams on specific critical safety standards that are fre-
quently assumed to have occurred but may not be adhered
to. It can also help identify specific lapses and process weak-
nesses that can be the focus of improvement efforts. Where
standards are either not known or not clear, the checklist
can raise awareness of them and help guide hospital poli-
cies and protocols. It can even create a ‘
team-generated
Hawthorne effect’
, whereby all perioperative personnel
are involved in the responsibility of ensuring compliance
with standards, and observe completion together using the
checklist.
The data reported here have important implications for
policy-makers. T
en years after the introduction of the
checklist, there is much work to be done in promoting
its adoption worldwide. Local adaptation and ownership
are clearly important in ensuring long-term sustainable
change33. Further studies around the details of imple-
mentation in resource-constrained settings will help tailor
checklist procedures to local needs, thereby ensuring great-
est effect. Strong compliance and effective implementation
