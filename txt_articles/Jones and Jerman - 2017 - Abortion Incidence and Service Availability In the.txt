Abortion Incidence and Service Availability 
In the United States, 2014
CONTEXT: National and state-level information about abortion incidence can help inform policies and programs 
intended to reduce levels of unintended pregnancy.
METHODS: In 2015–2016, all U.S. facilities known or expected to have provided abortion services in 2013 or 2014 were 
surveyed. Data on the number of abortions were combined with population data to estimate national and state-level 
abortion rates. The number of abortion-providing facilities and changes since a similar 2011 survey were also assessed. 
The number and type of new abortion restrictions were examined in the states that had experienced the largest pro-
portionate changes in clinics providing abortion services.
RESULTS: In 2014, an estimated 926,200 abortions were performed in the United States, 12% fewer than in 2011; the 
2014 abortion rate was 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44, representing a 14% decline over this period. The 
number of clinics providing abortions declined 6% between 2011 and 2014, and declines were steepest in the Midwest 
(22%) and the South (13%). Early medication abortions accounted for 31% of nonhospital abortions, up from 24% in 
2011. Most states that experienced the largest proportionate declines in the number of clinics providing abortions had 
enacted one or more new restrictions during the study period, but reductions were not always associated with declines 
in abortion incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between abortion access, as measured by the number of clinics, and abortion rates is 
not straightforward. Further research is needed to understand the decline in abortion incidence.

Information about abortion incidence in the United States 
is necessary to estimate accurate pregnancy rates and to 
determine rates of unintended pregnancy.1 In 2011, there 
were 1.06 million abortions, and 21% of pregnancies 
were terminated.2 These fi
 gures reveal that abortion is not 
uncommon. Abortion incidence in 2011 was remarkable 
for several reasons. Between 1990 and 2008, the abor-
tion rate declined an average of 2% per year,3 but between 
2008 and 2011, it dropped 13%.2 Fewer women had abor-
tions in 2011 than in 2008 because fewer women became 
pregnant when they did not want to: Over this period, the 
proportion of pregnancies that were unintended declined 
from 51% to 45%, and the rate of unintended pregnancy 
dropped 18%, from 54 to 45 per 1,000 women.1
Research suggests that a rise in contraceptive use was 
responsible for at least some of the decline in unintended 
pregnancy between 2008 and 2011, and that increased use 
may have continued into more recent years. Reliance on 
long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods—the 
IUD and the implant—increased 130% between 2007 and 
2009,4 and this trend continued, albeit at a slightly slower 
pace, through 2012.5 The proportion of clients obtaining 
LARC methods at Title X–supported family planning clin-
ics rose from 7% in 2011 to 11% in 2014.6 Clients at Title 
X–supported facilities are disproportionately young and 
low-income,7 and these populations account for the major-
ity of unintended pregnancies.1 Thus, even relatively small 
increases in LARC use among this population could reduce 
the incidence of unintended pregnancy and abortion.
Abortion incidence can also decline if women who want 
abortions are unable to obtain them; abortion restrictions 
have the potential to reduce abortion incidence by imped-
ing access to services. Between 2008 and 2011, some 24 
states enacted 106 abortion restrictions.2 However, no 
strong evidence exists that these restrictions were the main 
factor behind the decline in abortion. While some hospitals 
and physicians’ offi
 ces provided abortions, the overwhelm-
ing majority of procedures—95%—were accounted for by 
clinics.2 Between 2008 and 2011, the number of clinics 
providing abortions declined by only 1%, and decreases 
in abortion incidence occurred in almost all states, includ-
ing states that enacted multiple restrictions and states that 
enacted none.2 Some of the laws implemented in 2008–
2011 would not be expected to have a measurable impact 
on abortion incidence—for example, regulations requir-
ing that new information be added to existing counseling 
materials. Additionally, 62 of the 106 abortion restrictions 
were enacted in 2011, and many were not implemented or 
enforced until late in the year. Thus, their impact might not 
have been evidenced until 2012 (or later).
State efforts to restrict abortion have maintained their 
momentum, and states have enacted hundreds of new 
restrictions pertaining to abortion since 2011.8 Most 
restrictions, such as mandated ultrasounds and in-person

essarily her state of residence. Past iterations of this survey 
used a simple “yes/no” item to determine whether hospi-
tals had provided terminations, and this was intended to 
capture terminations for any reason. However, to ensure 
that we were capturing all abortions, and not only elective 
ones, the item was expanded to include specifi
 c reasons 
for providing an abortion: for health indications (such as 
fetal anomaly or health of the mother), because a patient 
requested one and for other reasons. This strategy was also 
adopted during nonresponse follow-up, when hospital 
facilities were contacted by telephone.
In addition to the foregoing items, nonhospital facilities 
were asked about the proportion of services accounted for 
by abortion and the number of early medication abortions 
provided. The survey instrument defi
 ned early medication 
abortions as procedures performed up to nine weeks’ ges-
tation; to ensure that we captured all such abortions (and 
not just those done with mifepristone), we asked provid-
ers to identify the type of medication used, distinguishing 
among mifepristone (with misoprostol), methotrexate and 
misoprostol alone. The 2014 survey included two new 
items for nonhospital facilities. We asked respondents to 
estimate the total number of days on which the facility was 
unable to provide abortion services in 2014 because of 
efforts to come into compliance with local or state laws or 
regulations. This item was intended to capture the poten-
tial impact of TRAP and other types of laws on abortion 
services. In addition, we asked if the facility had treated any 
patients for missed or failed abortion as a result of women’s 
attempts to end a pregnancy on their own and, if yes, to 
estimate the total number of patients seen for this reason. 
This item was intended to serve as a crude measure of the 
prevalence of self-induced abortion.
The survey universe comprised all facilities known to 
have provided abortions in 2011, as well as possible new 
abortion-providing facilities, as identifi
 ed via Internet 
searches, telephone directories, media articles and mem-
bership directories of organizations that work with abor-
tion service providers. We mailed the fi
 rst questionnaire to 
all facilities in the universe in March 2015, and we followed 
with two mailings at four-week intervals to nonrespon-
dents. Intensive follow-up of nonrespondents was con-
ducted via telephone, fax and e-mail between June 2015 
and April 2016 to obtain completed questionnaires; these 
efforts prioritized obtaining the total number of abortions 
over other survey items. During this phase of data collec-
tion, more than 11,800 contacts were made with approxi-
mately 1,800 facilities, including administrators at facilities 
that had closed.
We also requested abortion data from health department 
agencies in the District of Columbia and the 45 states in 
which they were available. Reliability and type of infor-
mation available varied across states. Where possible, we 
collected the number of abortions by facility, but most 
commonly, we obtained information by county of occur-
rence or facility type; in some states, we were able to obtain 
only the total number of abortions. This information was 
counseling requirements, are intended to discourage 
women from having abortions, thereby reducing demand 
for services.9 However, legislators have increased efforts to 
restrict the provision of abortion, typically through targeted 
regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP
, laws.9,10 These 
laws place burdensome regulations on abortion providers 
and the facilities in which they work. Perhaps the most 
high-profi
 le case was Texas, which, in 2013, implemented 
TRAP laws requiring that physicians who provided abor-
tions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that 
clinics providing abortions meet the standards of ambu-
latory surgical centers. Following the implementation of 
these laws, more than half of the 46 clinics in the state 
closed, and the abortion rate had declined 13% by April 
2014.11 In June 2016, the Supreme Court overturned both 
provisions of this law,12 and in the succeeding four months, 
the decision was cited three times to block enforcement of 
abortion restrictions in Alabama,13 Florida14 and Indiana.15 
Moreover, the Supreme Court has denied judicial review 
to pending cases in Mississippi and Wisconsin,16 and more 
TRAP laws are likely to be challenged. However, as of 
August 1, 2016, some 24 states had implemented TRAP 
laws, and these regulations may have affected access to 
abortion in 2013 and 2014.17
When unable to access abortion services in the face of 
restrictive laws, some women may turn to self-induced 
abortion.18 One study estimated that as many as 100,000 
women aged 18–49 residing in Texas had ever attempted 
to end a pregnancy on their own,18 and a media analysis 
found that interest in self-induced abortion—as measured 
via Google searches—was higher in states with restrictive 
abortion laws than in states without them.19 If substantial 
numbers of women were able to have abortions outside of 
a health care setting, the estimated incidence of abortions 
occurring in clinical settings would be too low.
This study summarizes fi
 ndings from the Guttmacher 
Institute’s most recent Abortion Provider Census, refl
 ecting 
abortion incidence and the number of facilities providing 
abortion in 2013 and 2014. Because of the important role 
of clinics, we examine the abortion policy context in states 
that experienced the greatest proportionate changes in the 
number of these types of facilities.
METHODS
Survey Content and Fielding
Data for this study come from the Guttmacher Institute’s 
2014 Abortion Provider Census, which surveyed the 
known universe of abortion-providing facilities in the 
United States.2 Questionnaires were similar to the instru-
ment used in 2011; some modifi
 cations were made for 
clarity, and several new items were added. Nonhospital 
facilities (clinics and physicians’ offi
 ces) received a longer 
questionnaire than hospitals because of differences in ser-
vice provision. Regardless of facility type, all respondents 
were asked the number of induced abortions that were 
provided at their location in 2013 and 2014; hence, the 
state in which a patient obtained an abortion was not nec-

 ces and abortions 
missed by our survey.
We obtained approval for this study through expedited 
review by the Guttmacher Institute’s federally registered 
institutional review board.
Analysis
Census Bureau data on the population of women aged 
15–44 on July 1, 2013, and July 1, 2014, were used 
as denominators for calculating abortion rates for the 
entire United States and for each state and the District of 
Columbia.20 We estimated the national abortion ratio as 
the proportion of pregnancies (excluding those ending in 
miscarriages) that ended in abortion. To do this, we com-
bined our abortion counts with National Center for Health 
Statistics data on the number of U.S. births in the one-year 
periods beginning on July 1 of 2013 and 2014 (to match 
conception times for births with those for abortions).21–23
We distinguished among four types of abortion- 
providing 
facilities: abortion clinics, nonspecialized clinics, hospitals 
and physicians’ offi
 ces. Abortion clinics are defi
 ned as non-
hospital facilities in which half or more of patient visits are 
for abortion services, regardless of annual abortion case-
load. Nonspecialized clinics are nonhospital sites in which 
fewer than half of patient visits are for abortion services. 
Physicians’ offi
 ces are defi
 ned as facilities that provide 
fewer than 400 abortions per year and have names suggest-
ing that they are private practices. Physicians’ offi
 ces that 
provide 400 or more abortions per year were categorized as 
nonspecialized clinics; because of their relatively large case-
load, we assume that their service provision more closely 
mirrors that of a nonspecialized clinic. 
Eighty percent of nonhospital facilities provided infor-
mation on early medication abortion, 60% provided infor-
mation on self-induced abortion and 63% answered items 
about lost service days. Response rates to these measures 
varied by facility type and caseload, and we constructed 
weights to account for these differences.
Our analysis takes a particularly close look at states 
that experienced the largest changes in clinics of both 
types between 2011 and 2014. Specifi
 cally, we exam-
ined the 10 states that experienced the proportionately 
largest declines in clinics and the 10 that exhibited the 
largest increases, and compared three measures: the per-
centage change in abortion rate between 2011 and 2014, 
the number of abortion restrictions enacted between 
2012 and 2014, and whether the state had a TRAP law. 
Information on state laws came from the Guttmacher 
Institute.24–27 Appendix Table 1 (Supporting Information) 
provides a list of laws and the states in which they were 
implemented.
used to supplement and validate information obtained 
from abortion-providing facilities and was sometimes used 
to generate estimates for nonresponding facilities.
Of the 2,313 facilities in the universe of potential 
 
abortion-providing facilities, we collected data from 868 
(38%) via the questionnaire and from 463 (20%) during 
telephone follow-up. Health department data were used 
to determine caseloads for 460 facilities (20%). We esti-
mated abortion fi
 gures for 390 facilities (17%). For 265 
of these, we based our estimates on abortion numbers 
from previous census results and service patterns of other 
abortion-providing facilities in the community; for another 
125, we used information from key informants (e.g., grass-
roots organizations and individuals who were knowledge-
able about reproductive health services in a community) 
and the facilities’ websites. The majority of nonrespond-
ing facilities for which we made estimates (291 of the 390) 
were hospitals and physicians’ offi
 ces, and both types of 
facilities typically have small caseloads;2 75 of the 390 facil-
ities were estimated to have provided no abortions during 
the survey period. The remaining 132 facilities (6%)* in 
the overall universe were found to be closed or to have 
stopped providing abortion services.
Of the abortions counted in 2014, some 68% were 
reported via questionnaire, and an additional 20% dur-
ing nonresponse follow-up. Five percent of abortions were 
reported by health departments, and 7% were estimated 
using historical data and information from key informants 
and facilities’ websites.† Notably, the extent to which 
data had to be estimated was not uniform across states. 
The highest proportions of missing data were seen in the 
District of Columbia (12%), Florida (21%), Georgia (11%), 
Hawaii (19%), Michigan (15%), New Jersey (16%), New 
Mexico (21%) and Oklahoma (18%).
Undoubtedly, some facilities that provide abortion care, 
especially those with small caseloads, are not known to us 
and are excluded from our census. To address this issue, 
we used the American Medical Association’s master list to 
obtain a random sample of 2,000 physicians who iden-
tifi
 ed their specialty as obstetrics and gynecology,‡ and 
who provided a phone number; the latter was necessary 
so that we could conduct phone follow-up. Notably, 49% 
of all obstetrician-gynecologists on the master list did not 
provide a phone number, and our strategy assumed that 
these physicians did not differ from those who did with 
regard to abortion provision. We mailed a survey to each 
of the sample’s physicians asking, among other things, 
whether they had provided abortions in 2014 and, if so, 
how many. If a physician did not respond to any of three 
mailings, we made up to three attempts to contact the 
individual by phone. During fi
 elding, we determined that 
74 physicians in the sample were already known to us 
to provide abortion services, and 432 physicians were 
deceased, retired or unreachable because of incorrect 
contact information; 551 did not respond to mailings or 
telephone follow-up. The information we obtained from 
the responding 943 physicians was used to estimate the 
*Percentages add up to more than 100% because of rounding.
†Similarly, in 2011, some 86% of abortions were reported by facilities, 4% 
were reported by health departments and 10% were estimated.
‡We excluded obstetrician-gynecologists who, because of their subspe-
cialty, were highly unlikely to provide abortion care.
 Abortion Incidence and Service Availability in the United States, 2014
20 
Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health
Six percent fewer clinics were providing abortions 
in 2014 than in 2011 (Table 4). The number of clinics 
decreased in 25 states, remained stable in 14 states and the 
District of Columbia, and increased in 11 states. In 2014, 
fi
 ve states—Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South 
Dakota and Wyoming*—had only one clinic that provided 
abortion services.
The Northeast was the only region that had more clinics 
providing abortion services in 2014 than in 2011; the num-
ber increased by 14%, largely because of an increase from 
24 to 41 in New Jersey. Most of the New Jersey facilities 
were nonspecialized clinics that started offering early medi-
cation abortion (not shown). The Midwest experienced the 
largest decline in clinics—22%, or 27 clinics. Most of this 
decrease was accounted for by Michigan (which lost 10 
clinics), Ohio (six) and Iowa (fi
 ve). The South also experi-
enced a substantial decline in clinics (13%); more than half 
of this was accounted for by the loss of 18 clinics in Texas. 
In the West, the number of clinics fell by 7%.
In 2014, some 90% of U.S. counties had no clinics that 
provided abortion care, and 39% of women aged 15–44 lived 
in those counties; these numbers were essentially unchanged 
from the 2011 fi
 gures of 89% and 38%, respectively
.2 Access 
to abortion services appeared to be best in California, 
Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and Nevada, 
where fewer than 10% of women lived in a county without 
a clinic. More than 90% of women residing in Mississippi, 
Missouri or Wyoming lived in a county without a clinic.
Of the 943 physicians from whom we obtained infor-
mation, 58, or 6%, reported providing an average of 
RESULTS
Abortion Incidence
The number of abortions and the abortion rate declined 
steadily between 2011 and 2014, by 3–6% per year (Table 1). 
In 2014, there were 926,200 abortions, and the abortion 
rate was 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44. 
This is the lowest rate since abortion was legalized nation-
ally in 1973.3 Nineteen percent of pregnancies (excluding 
miscarriages) ended in abortion in 2014, a decrease of 11% 
from the 2011 fi
 gure of 21%.
Overall, the abortion rate declined 14% between 2011 
and 2014, while the number of abortions dropped by 12% 
(Table 2). The rate declined in almost all states. Increases 
were generally small (1–4% in Arkansas, Kansas, Michigan, 
Mississippi, North Carolina and Vermont), but the District of 
Columbia had an increase of 15%. Three states experienced a 
decline in the abortion rate that was at least twice the national 
decline (Delaware, 41%; Hawaii, 33%; and Texas, 28%).
Abortion rates dropped in all four regions of the country
, 
but declines were steeper in the West and the South (16% 
each) than in the Midwest (9%) and the Northeast (11%). 
Following previous patterns, the Northeast maintained the 
highest abortion rate, followed by the West, the South and the 
Midwest. The fi
 ve highest abortion rates were in the District 
of Columbia, New York, New Jersey
, Maryland and Florida; 
rate declines in the four states ranged from 5% to 18%.
Facility Type and Numbers
In 2014, a total of 1,671 facilities provided at least one 
abortion (Table 3). Abortion clinics accounted for 16% of 
all facilities but for 59% of all abortions (Figure 1), largely 
because a majority of these facilities had caseloads of 1,000 
or more per year. Nonspecialized clinics represented 31% 
of all known abortion-providing facilities and accounted 
for 36% of abortions. While many of these clinics primar-
ily serve contraceptive and family planning clients, about 
half provided 400 or more abortions per year. Thirty-eight 
percent of facilities were hospitals; however, most of these 
provided fewer than 30 abortions per year, and these types 
of facilities accounted for 4% of all abortions. Finally, pri-
vate physicians’ offi
 ces made up 15% of abortion facilities 
and provided 1% of procedures.
The total number of abortion facilities declined 3% 
between 2011 and 2014, but the drop was particularly 
marked among abortion clinics (17%), especially those 
with caseloads of 1,000–4,999 per year (26%). The num-
ber of nonspecialized clinics that provided abortions 
remained stable. The 7% increase in the number of hos-
pitals providing abortions was likely due to the fact that 
the 2014 survey did a better job of capturing abortions 
provided for reasons of fetal or maternal indications. The 
number of physicians’ offi
 ces providing abortions declined 
by 14% between 2011 and 2014.

25 abortions per year. Assuming the respondents were 
representative of the universe of 33,379 practicing 
 
obstetrician-gynecologists in the United States,28 our main 
survey missed 2,069 physicians, who collectively provided 
51,725 abortions in 2014. If this estimate is correct, our 
study undercounted the total number of abortions by 5%.
Early Medication Abortion
In 2014, an estimated 272,400 early medication abor-
tions were provided in nonhospital facilities, representing 
a 14% increase since 2011 (Table 5). Early medication 
abortions accounted for 31% of all nonhospital abor-
tions, compared with 24% in 2011. Half or more of all

gestation in 2014 were early medication procedures (not 
shown), up from approximately 36% in 2011.* While 
other drugs can be administered in early medication abor-
tion, the overwhelming majority—97%—were done with 
mifepristone; the remaining procedures used methotrexate 
or misoprostol alone.
The use of early medication abortion increased across 
all facility types and sizes between 2011 and 2014. While 
abortion clinics saw only a 2% increase, nonspecialized 
clinics and physicians’ offi
 ces reported increases of 26% 
and 20%, respectively. Though nonspecialized clinics 
accounted for 36% of all abortions, they provided 51% of 
all early medication abortions.
For 2014, we estimated that 900 nonhospital 
 
facilities—87% of all nonhospital provider sites— 
provided early medication abortion (not shown). The 
overwhelming majority of both abortion clinics (99.8%) 
and nonspecialized clinics (88%) offered this service. At 
least 23% of all nonhospital facilities offered only early 
medication abortions; most of these facilities were non-
specialized clinics, and 38% of such clinics offered only 
early medication abortion. Most facilities that provided 
only early medication abortions were located in areas 
that were also served by facilities offering surgical abor-
tion, though 11 were the sole abortion-providing facility 
in the metropolitan statistical area in which they were 
located.
State Abortion Policy Context
Abortion restrictions were associated with a decrease 
in the number of abortion and nonspecialized clinics, 
but fl
 uctuations in clinic numbers—whether decreases 
or increases—were not clearly associated with abortion 
rates. Eight of the 10 states that experienced the largest 
proportionate declines in the number of clinics over the 
period 2011–2014 implemented at least one new abor-
tion restriction between 2012 and 2014, and six enacted 
three or four (Table 6). Four states—Arizona, Michigan, 
Ohio and Texas—implemented TRAP regulations dur-
ing this period, and four had TRAP laws in place prior 
to 2012.29 Hawaii and Iowa experienced substantial 
declines in the number of clinics providing abortions, 
but enacted no new abortion restrictions and, along with 
Montana, had no TRAP laws.
Seven of the states that experienced the largest propor-
tionate declines in clinics also experienced a larger than 
average decline in the abortion rate. However, the states 
with the two largest proportionate declines in clinic 
numbers—Missouri and Utah—experienced declines in 
the abortion rate that were comparable to the national 
average. And while Michigan had 33% fewer clinics in 
abortions (50–68%) provided by facilities with annual 
 
caseloads of fewer than 400 procedures were early medi-
cation abortions.
We assumed that the majority of facilities provided medi-
cation abortion up to nine weeks’ gestation; this was the 
gestational limit defi
 ned on the survey. Using gestational 
data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
we estimated that 45% of abortions up to nine weeks’

2014 than in 2011, the state’s abortion rate increased 
slightly.
Patterns among the 10 states with the largest 
 
proportionate increases in the number of clinics further 
demonstrated that changes in clinic numbers and abortion 
rates were not clearly related. The abortion rate declined in 
eight of these states and increased slightly (3–4%) in two. 
Only one of these 10 states enacted new abortion restric-
tions between 2012 and 2014; Kansas enacted four new 
provisions, even as one new facility opened. Two states—
Rhode Island and Connecticut—had implemented TRAP 
laws prior to 2012.
 Abortion Incidence and Service Availability in the United States, 2014
24 
Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health
Abortion incidence can be affected by service availabil-
ity. The overwhelming majority of abortions—95%—are 
provided by abortion clinics and nonspecialized clinics, and 
6% fewer clinics provided abortions in 2014 than in 2011. 
Declines in the numbers of clinics were most pronounced 
in the Midwest (22%) and the South (13%), regions of 
the country where the majority of new abortion restric-
tions were enacted during the study period.26,27 However, 
regional patterns in clinic numbers did not always corre-
spond with changes in abortion rates, as rate declines were 
steepest in the West and the South (both 16%) and lowest 
in the Midwest (9%). And while the Northeast had more 
clinics providing abortion care in 2014 than in 2011, that 
region’s abortion rate declined 11%. These patterns dem-
onstrate that the relationship between abortion access, as 
measured by numbers of clinics, and abortion rates is not 
straightforward. These trends may obscure more nuanced 
relationships between clinics with the largest caseloads 
and abortion rates. For example, abortion clinics provided 
the majority of abortions in 2014 (59%), but the num-
ber of such clinics with annual caseloads of 1,000–4,999 
declined by 26%.
Six of the 10 states that experienced the greatest propor-
tionate declines in the number of clinics enacted three or 
four new abortion restrictions between 2012 and 2014, 
and four of these states implemented new TRAP laws. At 
the same time, however, two of the 10 states did not enact 
new restrictions during this period, and three had no TRAP 
laws. Thus, restrictions alone do not account for declines 
in clinic numbers. Michigan and Ohio both experienced 
a 33% decline in the number of clinics providing abor-
tion services, and both implemented multiple restrictions, 
including TRAP laws, between 2012 and 2014. However, 
some Michigan facilities located near the Ohio border were 
able to both meet the TRAP requirement and expand ser-
vices to meet increased demand from women in the neigh-
boring state.30 This may have been one reason why the 
abortion rate in Michigan increased slightly.
Hawaii and Iowa experienced larger than average 
declines in both numbers of clinics and abortion rates, and 
neither had TRAP laws or enacted new abortion restric-
tions. The decline in abortion incidence in Iowa may have 
been due to reduced levels of unintended pregnancy. In 
2006, Iowa expanded access to family planning for low-
income women, and between 2007 and 2013, a privately 
funded initiative sought to increase access to LARC meth-
ods among the same population.31 Areas of the state with 
the most exposure to these programs experienced larger 
declines in abortion than did those with less exposure.31 
We are not aware of similar programs or initiatives in 
Hawaii, and it is unclear what accounted for the changes 
there. The loss of two abortion-providing clinics may 
have reduced access to the procedure. However, only 5% 
of women in Hawaii lived in a county without a clinic in 
2014, so this seems unlikely. Alternately, because 19% of 
abortions in Hawaii were estimated using information from 
sources other than the facilities where the abortions were

one-third were in Texas.

Other Potential Impacts o 
f Restrictions
Overall, 4% of nonhospital facilities (located in 15 states) 
reported  
being unable to provide care on one or more days 
in order to be in compliance with local or state regula-
tions (not shown). These closures presumably occurred in 
response to state inspections, as well as TRAP and other 
types of laws. Facilities in the South were the most likely to 
report lost days (15%),* followed by those in the Midwest 
(5%). Only 1% of nonhospital facilities in the Northeast 
and the West reported lost service days.
Twelve percent of nonhospital facilities reported treat-
ing at least one patient who had attempted to end her 
pregnancy on her own in 2014 (not shown). This fi
 gure 
included facilities in 30 states, but there were regional vari-
ations: The proportion of facilities that had treated such 
patients was higher in the South and the Midwest (21% 
and 16%, respectively) than in the West (10%) and the 
Northeast (8%). More than two-thirds of facilities were able 
to quantify this caseload, and three-quarters reported hav-
ing treated 10 or fewer of these patients in 2014.
DISCUSSION
The long-term decline in abortion continued through 
2014; in that year, the abortion rate and ratio were both 
lower than those documented in 1973, the year abortion 
was legalized nationwide. The drop in abortion was found 
in all but six states and the District of Columbia, though 
there was substantial variation across states. It is beyond 
the scope of this descriptive study to explore the larger 
dynamics responsible for these patterns, but we suggest 
several potential factors that may have contributed to some 
of the observed patterns.
 Volume 49, Number 1, March 2017

estimated using other sources may introduce inaccuracy 
into the data.
Undoubtedly, some abortion-providing facilities were not 
counted because we were unable to identify them. Our sur-
vey of a random sample of obstetrician-gynecologists sug-
gests that some 2,000 physicians who provide abortions in 
their private practice were not captured in our study; hence 
our estimate of abortions may be 5% lower than it would 
have been if these providers had been included.
While we are confi
 dent that our study captured most, if 
not all, clinics that provide abortion services, we are aware 
that some of the information in this study is already out 
of date. The media have closely monitored clinic closures 
(and reopenings) in Texas; as of June 2016, some 18–21 
clinics were providing abortion services there,32 whereas we 
counted 28. In part, this difference is due to our inclusion 
of facilities that provided at least one abortion in 2014; a 
number of clinics closed at some point in that year, many in 
response to the TRAP laws,11,33 and more facilities closed in 
2015.34,35 Substantial numbers of clinics may have closed in 
other states as well, while other facilities may have opened 
(or reopened).
Some evidence suggests that women who live in states 
that have restrictive abortion laws are turning to self-
induced abortion,18,19 but our study did not capture abor-
tions that occurred outside of medical settings.36 Overall, 
12% of nonhospital facilities had seen at least one patient 
who had attempted to end her pregnancy on her own in 
2014, and reports of self-induction were greater in the 
performed, we may have underestimated the number of 
procedures that occurred, and the actual change in abor-
tion incidence may be smaller (or larger).
At least some of the decline in abortion across the United 
States likely is due to declines in unintended pregnancy. Use 
of LARC methods increased 36% among all women using 
contraceptives between 2009 and 2012,5 and 48% among 
clients at Title X–supported family planning facilities.6 
Clients at the latter facilities are disproportionately young 
adults and lower income women, two groups who are at the 
highest risk for unintended pregnancy.1 Additionally, reli-
ance on LARC methods has been increasing since 2002,4 
and this may have had a cumulative effect. For example, 
the most commonly used IUD is effective for fi
 ve (or more) 
years, and the implant for three; if a majority of women 
who received LARC methods in 2011 were still using them 
in 2014, they would have been protected from unintended 
pregnancy during the entire study period.
Limitations
We are aware of several shortcomings of our study. We 
obtained responses from only 58% of facilities that we 
believed provided abortions in 2014. Health department 
data, which can be of variable quality, were used to deter-
mine caseloads for 20% of facilities, and we estimated 
caseloads for 17%. Moreover, some states required more 
estimation than others. The overwhelming majority of the 
abortions that we counted—88%—were based on infor-
mation given to us by providers, but the fact that 12% were

South and the Midwest, regions that had higher numbers 
of abortion restrictions.26,27 If reliance on self-induced abor-
tion was higher in 2014 than in 2011, the observed decline 
in abortion would not be as large as our fi
 ndings suggest.
Our abortion counts and rates are tabulated by state of 
occurrence. The fi
 ve states with the lowest abortion rates 
were Wyoming, South Dakota, Mississippi, Kentucky and 
Idaho. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention suggest that in 2012, some 14% of abortion 
patients who lived in South Dakota went out of state for 
services, as did more than 90% of abortion patients who 
lived in Wyoming.37 Thus, the abortion numbers and 
rates in this study do not always refl
 ect abortion incidence 
among women who reside in a given state.
Conclusions
Abortion is an important indicator of unintended preg-
nancy, but it is unclear whether the most recent decline in 
abortion is due to fewer women’s having unintended preg-
nancies, more women’s being unable to access abortion ser-
vices or some combination of these dynamics. That there 
were fewer clinics providing abortions in 2014 than in 
2011 could be attributed to several factors. In some states, 
increased abortion restrictions likely contributed to the 
decline in abortions, but in others, the decline may have 
been driven by a drop in demand. For example, increased 
reliance on LARC methods likely contributed to the decline 
in unintended pregnancy that occurred between 2008 and 
2011.1 If women continued to experience fewer unin-
tended pregnancies in 2014, there may have been less need 
for abortion services and, in turn, decreased need for pro-
viders. Future research should aim to elucidate patterns 
in abortion incidence and numbers of abortion-providing 
facilities and identify reasons for change. In addition, 
because state legislatures continued to pass new abortion 
restrictions in 2015 and 2016, subsequent research will 
need to monitor the accessibility of abortion services.
