Summary
Background
A number of studies demonstrate that children who are younger within their school
year have poorer academic attainment and are more likely to have special educational needs. Few,
however, have considered the impact relative age may have on child mental health, behaviour and
happiness in school.
Methods
This paper utilized data from the Supporting Teachers and Children in Schools study
(2075 pupils aged 5 to 9 years from 80 primary schools) to explore the relationship among relative
age, behaviour and happiness in school. Behavioural and emotional development was assessed by
using the teacher-reported and parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the
Pupil Behaviour Questionnaire. Children’s happiness within school was assessed by using the How I
Feel About My School Questionnaire.
Results
Relatively younger children had higher Total Difficulties scores on the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire than their peers. There was a mean increase per 30-day decrease in
relative age of 0.09 (95% CI: 0.03 to 0.16; p = 0.007) in teacher-reported and 0.08 (0.001 to 0.16;
p = 0.05) in parent-reported scores. There was little evidence of a relationship between relative age
and children’s behaviour and happiness in school.
Conclusions
For children with complex difficulties, being relatively young for their school year may
be an additional stressor that may undermine mental health.
The youngest children in a school year may be nearly an entire
year younger than their oldest peers. A number of studies have
demonstrated that children born later in the school year are
more likely to achieve lower scores in tests of academic
attainment at primary (Sharp et al. 1994; McPhillips & Jordan-
Black 2009) and secondary school (Cobley et al. 2009), be
overrepresented within lower ability streaming groups
(D. Thompson 1971) and be identified as having special
educational needs (SEN) (Wilson 2000; Gledhill et al. 2002).
These ‘relative age effects’ can impact on a child’s future
education and career prospects. As similar effects have been
detected in countries with different school entry cut-off dates,
it would seem that relative age rather than season of birth is the
driving influence (Goodman et al. 2003). Indeed, the scores of
relatively young children did not differ significantly from their
older peers on age-standardized measures of attainment in the
British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey 1999
(Goodman et al. 2003). These findings have led to the UK
Department of Education reviewing the guidance on school
admissions to allow parents to defer their child’s entry to
school by 1 year if they are born in the summer (Department
for Education 2014a). Despite evidence supporting the link
between relative age and academic attainment, the policy
changes about school entry in the UK and the increasing focus

 of schools on mental health issues described in the succeeding
texts (Department for Education 2014b; Institute for Public
Policy Research 2016; Parker et al. 2016), few studies have
considered the impact relative age may also have on a child’s
mental health and well-being in school.
Child psychopathology, well-being and happiness have been
a key focus for a number of school-based initiatives worldwide,
including programmes such as the Healthy Schools
Programme (Warwick et al. 2009) and the Social and
Emotional Aspects of Learning Programme (Hallam 2009).
Disruptive behaviour is the most common type of childhood
psychiatric disorder in the school-age population (Ford et al.
2003, Newlove-Delgado et al. 2015) and is strongly associated
with stress, burnout and exit from the profession among
teachers as well as disrupting the learning of all in the
classroom (Wharton 2009; Tsouloupas et al. 2010; Aloe et al.
2014). Teachers feel very torn between supporting individual
children whose poor mental health impedes their ability to
cope in the classroom and their duty to the rest of the class
(Richardson et al. 2015). Poor mental health and disruptive
behaviour is an accepted impediment to learning and has been
linked to a number of adverse outcomes later in life, including
conduct disorder, anti-social behaviour, crime, substance
misuse, educational failure and violence (Collishaw et al.
2004). Such adverse side effects not only present during
childhood but also persist throughout adolescence, leading to
poor future prospects and high costs to society (Scott et al.
2001). Using a combination of psychological distress based on
scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)
(Goodman 2001) and psychiatric interviews in a large
population-based sample, Goodman et al. (2003) reported
that children who were younger within their school year had
poorer mental health than their relatively older peers.
Similarly, in a large sample of African American and European
American children, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders was
higher among children who were youngest within their
academic year (Polizzi et al. 2007). Patalay et al. (2015) also
found that relatively younger adolescents had more emotional
symptoms and peer problems when compared with relatively
older peers using SDQ data from a large population-based
sample (born 1996–1998).
Studies in North America, Sweden and Canada have also
indicated that relatively younger children in school are more
likely to have received a diagnosis of, and receive a prescription
for, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Elder
2010; Marrow et al. 2012; Halldner et al. 2014). Goodman
et al.’s (2003) study is unique in that it considers
psychopathology in general, but the data were collected in
1999 and, as there have been numerous changes in policy and
practice (e.g. free part-time early years’ education) since, they
may not reflect children’s experiences now.
Within adults, there is a known relationship among
‘happiness’, an affective component of well-being and
cognitive functions which can influence learning. For example,
Fredrickson and Branigan (2005) found that positive versus
neutral affect was associated with increased attention and
cognition, and others have found that positive affect may also
help increase creative (Isen et al. 1987) and holistic thinking
(Isen et al. 1991). There are indications that relatively young
children may be more unhappy at school (see Crawford et al.
2011), be more likely to be bullied (Department for Education
2010), have lower levels of self-esteem (Fenzel 1992; A.
Thompson et al. 2004) and commit suicide (Thompson et al.
1999) than their older peers. However, to our knowledge, few
studies have considered the impact that being young relative to
others in your class may have on a child’s happiness,
particularly happiness at school.
The objective of the current study was to explore the
relationship of relative age with child mental health, behaviour
and happiness in school (hereafter referred to as ‘happiness’) in
a large sample of primary school children aged 4 to 9 years old.
We predicted that relatively younger children would (i) have
poorer mental health; (ii) be more disruptive than their older
peers; and (ii) be less happy.
Method
This paper presents an analysis of baseline data from the
Supporting Teachers and Children in Schools (STARS) study, a
cluster randomized controlled trial of the Incredible Years
Teacher Classroom Management programme (Ford et al.
2012). Ethical approval for the study was granted by Peninsula
College of Medicine and Dentistry Research Ethics Committee,
now University of Exeter Medical School.
Participants
The sample comprised 2075 children (out of 2188 eligible)
aged 4 to 9 years from 80 schools in Devon, UK. Eligible
schools were state-funded mainstream primary schools.
Schools placed in special measures by Ofsted were excluded.
Devon has a predominantly White British (93.5%) population
with areas of high deprivation (Devon County Council 2013).
Participating schools were from a mixture of urban (54%) and
non-urban locations and 18% located in a deprived area
(lowest quintile according to the Index of Multiple
Deprivation) (McLennan et al. 2011). More than half of

 schools (58%) had higher than the English mean proportion of
children eligible to receive free school meals (Department for
Education 2012).
Procedure
Parents had 2 weeks to opt themselves and their child out of
the trial; teachers provided written consent and children verbal
assent. Data were collected during the first half of the autumn
term in 2013 (15 schools), 2014 (30 schools) and 2015 (35
schools). Children in Foundation (ages 4–5) and Key Stage 1
(ages 5–7) were given one-to-one support to complete the
How I Feel About My School Questionnaire (see succeeding
texts), while children in Key Stage 2 (ages 7–9) completed it as
a class-based activity. Parents received paper questionnaires,
while teachers and SEN co-ordinators used a web-based
electronic database. Parents and teachers were thanked for
completing measures by receiving a £5 or £20 gift voucher,
respectively.
Outcome measures
Mental health was assessed by using teacher and parent
versions of the SDQ (Goodman 1997). The SDQ comprises 25
items that span five subscales (behaviour, emotions, over-
activity/concentration, peer relationships and pro-social
behaviour); the respondents answer a mixture of positively
and negatively worded statements on a three-point Likert scale
[not true (0), somewhat true (1) or certainly true (2)]. The 20
items in the first four subscales are summed to give a Total
Difficulties score (range 0–40), with higher scores indicating
greater difficulties (Goodman 1997, 2001). The SDQ is a brief,
valid and reliable measure [internal consistency, Cronbach’s
alpha (α) = 0.73; cross-informant correlation, Pearson’s
correlation (r) = 0.34; test–retest stability after 4 to 6 months,
α = 0.62] and is widely used to assess mental health in
childhood.
Children’s behaviour in school
The Pupil Behaviour Questionnaire (PBQ) was developed for
STARS (Ford et al. 2012) and was adapted from a scale used
extensively in school effectiveness studies (Gray et al. 1988).
Teachers answered questions measuring classroom behaviours
such as talking out of turn or making rude remarks. Responses
to the six items are on a three-point Likert scale of never (0),
occasionally (1) or frequently (2), with higher scores (range 0–
12) indicating more disruptive behaviour. The PBQ has good
internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.86), with factor analysis
confirming a one-factor structure, indicating that all six
questions measure the same dimension (Allwood & Ford in
preparation). There is preliminary evidence of validity, with a
moderate convergence between the PBQ and teacher-
completed SDQ Total Difficulties scores and Conduct subscale
[Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rs) = 0.43 and 0.45,
respectively] (Allwood & Ford in preparation).
Children’s happiness in school context
This was measured by the How I Feel About My School
(HIFAMS) Questionnaire, which was also developed for use in
the STARS study (Ford et al. 2012). This measure includes
seven questions about how children feel about their school,
relationships with their peers, teacher and learning. Answers
are on a three-point Likert scale, with emoticons indicating sad
(0), OK (1) and happy (2). Higher scores indicate greater
happiness at school (range 0–14). Allen et al. (2017) found that
HIFAMS demonstrated adequate 2-week test–retest reliability
[Spearman’s correlation (rs) = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.69] and
moderate internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.62).
Other measures
Assessing Pupils’ Progress
The Assessing Pupils’ Progress (APP) is an assessment tool
used to measure children’s attainment in literacy and
numeracy in English schools, to enable professionals to track
progress against nationally agreed criteria (Department for
Children, Schools and Families 2009). Teacher-reported
attainment levels for each child were compared with the level
expected by an average child in their year group. Results were
categorized as Working Below Age-Related Expectations or At/
Above Exact Age-related Expectations.
Special educational needs
Special educational needs co-ordinators reported whether a
child had any recognized SEN or extra support.
Demographic characteristics
Alongside child age and gender, parents were asked to indicate
their own educational level (any qualifications vs none) and
describe their current housing situation (home owner vs not)
(Ford et al. 2012). Children’s postcodes, where available,
indicated whether they lived in an area categorized as in the
lowest quintile based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation.

 Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted by using STATA software,
version 13.
Study measures were summarized for all children and by
relative age category. Sample characteristics were compared
against Devon norms.
The main analyses examined the relationship between
relative age (predictor variable) and each of the following
outcomes: mental health (teacher and parent SDQ Total
Difficulties score), disruptive behaviour (PBQ) and happiness
(HIFAMS), using random effects linear regression, specifying
school as a random effect. This method allows for the
correlation between the responses of pupils within schools
(clusters). Relative age was rescaled in such a manner that the
regression coefficient is the estimated mean increase in the
continuous outcomes per 30-day decrease in relative age.
Relative age was used as a categorical variable when
summarizing the data with three levels defined by the child’s
month of birth [oldest (September to December), middle
(January to April) and youngest (May to August)].
Crude (unadjusted) analyses and analyses adjusted for
potential confounders (gender, SES and year group) were run.
The regression results reported are based on the analyses of 20
multiply imputed datasets, in which missing values were filled in,
with the assumption that data were missing at random. Data
were imputed by using the chained equations (fully conditional
specification) method (Royston 2004) with all study variables
(outcomes, relative age, potential confounders and mediators)
included in the imputation model. Analyses of imputed data
provided essentially the same results as those from complete case
analyses. The mi impute STATA command was used to impute
missing data and mi estimate to analyse the imputed datasets.
Results
Descriptive results
Teachers, children and parents provided data on 100%, 98%
and 70% of the sample, respectively. The median (interquartile
range; range) number of children per school was 27 (24 to 28;
17 to 33). Table 1 reports the characteristics of the recruited
children. Numbers of children with SEN and those in the
lowest quintile for the Index of Multiple Deprivation were
representative of Devon, but SEN levels were slightly higher
than the percentage for England (18.5%) (Department for
Education 2012). Just over half of children had below average
APP literacy and numeracy scores, as expected for an
assessment at the beginning of the school year. Mean
teacher-reported SDQ Total Difficulties scores were lower for
children whose parents completed the parent questionnaire
(6.2) than for those whose parents did not (7.9).
A higher percentage of relatively young children had SEN or
extra support compared with their older peers and was
reported to be below average on the APP literacy and
numeracy measures (Table 1).
Responses across all outcome measures indicated that,
overall, children had low levels of disruptive behaviour and
high scores for happiness. Similarly, SDQ Total Difficulties
scores were similar to those for the primary school population
within Great Britain (mean teacher 6.7 and parent 8.6 scores;
see http://www.sdqinfo.org/) as expected for a sample selected
from mainstream education (Table 2).
Relative age as a predictor of happiness, mental
health and behaviour
Relatively young children had marginally higher SDQ Total
Difficulties scores as reported by teachers and parents compared
with their older peers (Table 3). On average, an 8-month
difference in relative age resulted in the younger children (born
later in the academic year) having SDQ Total Difficulties scores
that were higher by 0.74 points (as reported by teachers) and
0.64 points (as reported by parents). However, no differences
were found between relatively younger and older children on the
behavioural (PBQ) and happiness (HIFAMS) outcomes.
Discussion
The current study found a statistically significant relationship
between relative age and children’s mental health, albeit of low

 strength. Relative age was not, as we initially predicted,
associated with behaviour or happiness. In the succeeding
texts, we explore our findings in the context of the existing
literature and their implications for policy and practice and
consider the strengths and limitations of the data.
The effect of relative age tends to be most evident in
activities that are ‘characterized by age grouping, competition
and selection ability’ (A. Thompson et al. 2004 p. 314),
components that are all present in the education environment.
Children who are relatively young within their academic year
were more likely to score higher on a well-established measure
of child mental health, the SDQ, but at group level, the
differences were such that they would be unlikely to make a
difference in isolation at an individual level. Our findings do
replicate other studies (Ford et al. 2003; Crawford et al. 2011;
Patalay et al. 2015), which implies that there may be a number
of relatively young children for whom the additional stress of
trying to keep up with older, more developmentally advanced
children at school may compound other adversities. Relative
age may become more important when there are other
challenges to mental health and learning.
The absence of a strong relationship between relative age
and child mental health at a group level may reflect an
increased focus on social and emotional wellbeing in UK
schools during the early years of this century. For example,
there has been a substantial increase in the entitlement to free
early years of education (Brewer et al. 2014), increased
emphasis on the foundation stage (Department for Education
2014c) and an increase in well-being initiatives within schools.
It is possible such changes may limit the impact of relative age on
mental health, despite its continuing effect on perceived
academic attainment and SEN status.
In contrast to our findings, previous studies have found
that relative age can impact on behavioural problems
(Norbury et al. 2015) and conditions such as ADHD. The
PBQ focuses on low-level classroom disruption, such as
talking to peers, rather than general behaviour problems
(lying and stealing), and does not measure core symptoms of
ADHD. This was a surprising finding as we anticipated that
relatively young children would struggle more than their
older peers to meet the behavioural expectations of the
classroom.

Psychosocial impact of relative age in children

 Similarly, we found no evidence that happiness at primary
school was affected by relative age. Previous research has
suggested that relatively young children are more likely to have
lower levels of self-esteem (Fenzel 1992; A. Thompson et al.
2004), be bullied at school (Department for Education 2010)
and commit suicide (A. Thompson et al. 1999), which could
plausibly be associated with unhappiness. Additionally, Patalay
et al. (2015) found a small but significant effect of relative age
on the emotional symptom subscale of the SDQ in students
aged 11–13 years. Children may not experience an emotional
effect of relative age in school until they are older than our
sample (4–9 years) and more able to compare themselves with
others. More research is needed to clarify the impact of relative
age on happiness and emotional difficulties in school children
of different ages.
Recent changes in policy that may reduce or amplify the
effect of relative age, such as allowing parents to defer their
summer-born child’s entry to school by a year in England
(Department for Education 2014a), should be closely
monitored. Education and mental health practitioners should
be aware that relative age may be an additional risk factor for
those struggling with multiple difficulties, but our findings
suggest that it is unlikely to significantly affect an individual
child’s mental health in isolation.
Our study has several strengths. It is one of the first to
investigate the impact of relative age on children’s happiness
in school. The combination of a large sample with well-
validated and reliable measures of child mental health allows
us to confidently assert the current impact of relative age on
child mental health among primary schools in Devon. We
found the expected relationships between relative age and
academic attainment and SEN status, which suggests that our
unexpected results in relation to behaviour and happiness
were findings that were not solely due to the unusual
characteristics of our sample.
However, given that the participants were recruited from
southwest England, our results may not generalize to other
areas, particularly those with high numbers of children from
ethnic minority groups. While return rates for teacher-
reported (100%) and child-reported (98%) measures were
excellent, we only had parent SDQ scores for 70% of the
sample. Teacher reports suggest that children whose parents
did not return questionnaires were likely to experience poorer
mental health. Multiple imputations allowed us to fill in
missing data. In addition, previous research suggests that
despite the inevitable loss of those living in deprivation and
with poorer health from child mental health research, the
pattern of association will not necessarily have been altered
(Wolke et al. 2009). Finally, our data were cross-sectional, and
it may be that the impact of the detected differences in
attainment, SEN status and mental health might have led to
later difficulties with behaviour and unhappiness. Alternatively,
as the developmental variation between the youngest and
oldest in the school year might be expected to narrow with age,
these differences might be expected to reduce over time.
In summary, we found that relative age has a small but
significant association with children’s mental health but does
not impact young children’s behaviour and happiness at
school. Future research is needed to further explore the
developmental trajectory of relatively young children in terms
of their behaviour and happiness longitudinally, among older
school children and across different geographic locations.

Key messages
• This study suggests that children who are born later in the
academic year and are therefore relatively younger than
their peers have poorer mental health as rated by teachers
and parents.
• In keeping with previous studies, findings showed
population level effects on child mental health by relative
age, but these average differences were too small to be
clinically significant in isolation at an individual level.
• We found little evidence of a relative age effect on child-
reported happiness or teacher-reported low-level
disruptive behaviour in school.

 • For children with multiple challenges, relative age may be
an additional stressor that could undermine mental health
and is therefore worth considering when undertaking
assessments.
• Parents deferring their summer-born child’s entry to
school by a year are likely to circumvent the negative
impact of relative age on mental health.
