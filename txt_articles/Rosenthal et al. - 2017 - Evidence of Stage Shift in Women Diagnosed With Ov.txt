Purpose
To establish the performance of screening with serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), interpreted
using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA), and transvaginal sonography (TVS) for women at
high risk of ovarian cancer (OC) or fallopian tube cancer (FTC).
Patients and Methods
Women whose estimated lifetime risk of OC/FTC was $ 10% were recruited at 42 centers in the
United Kingdom and underwent ROCA screening every 4 months. TVS occurred annually if ROCA
results were normal or within 2 months of an abnormal ROCA result. Risk-reducing salpingo-
oophorectomy (RRSO) was encouraged throughout the study. Participants were observed via
cancer registries, questionnaires, and notification by centers. Performance was calculated after
censoring 365 days after prior screen, with modeling of occult cancers detected at RRSO.
Results
Between June 14, 2007, and May 15, 2012, 4,348 women underwent 13,728 women-years of
screening. The median follow-up time was 4.8 years. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with invasive
OC/FTC within 1 year of prior screening (13 diagnoses were screen-detected and six were occult at
RRSO). No symptomatic interval cancers occurred. Ten (52.6%) of the total 19 diagnoses were stage I
to II OC/FTC (CI, 28.9% to 75.6%). Of the 13 screen-detected cancers, five (38.5%) were stage I to II
(CI, 13.9% to 68.4%). Of the six occult cancers, five (83.3%) were stage I to II (CI, 35.9% to 99.6%).
Modeled sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for OC/FTC detection
within 1 year were 94.7% (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%), 10.8% (6.5% to 16.5%), and 100% (CI, 100% to
100%), respectively. Seven (36.8%) of the 19 cancers diagnosed , 1 year after prior screen were
stage IIIb to IV (CI, 16.3% to 61.6%) compared with 17 (94.4%) of 18 cancers diagnosed . 1 year after
screening ended (CI, 72.7% to 99.9%; P , .001). Eighteen (94.8%) of 19 cancers diagnosed , 1 year
after prior screen had zero residual disease (with lower surgical complexity, P = .16) (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%)
compared with 13 (72.2%) of 18 cancers subsequently diagnosed (CI, 46.5% to 90.3%; P = .09).
Conclusion
ROCA-based screening is an option for women at high risk of OC/FTC who defer or decline RRSO,
given its high sensitivity and significant stage shift. However, it remains unknown whether this
strategy would improve survival in screened high-risk women.

INTRODUCTION
Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and
Lynch syndrome (LS) account for a significant
minority (15% to 25%) of ovarian cancers (OCs)1,2
and confer a high risk for OC: 11% to 37% by age
70 years in BRCA2 carriers and 39% to 65% in
BRCA1 carriers.3,4 Other lower-penetrance ho-
mologous repair pathway genes have been impli-
cated in familial OC.5,6
Although medium-term survival with BRCA-
associated OC exceeds that of sporadic OC,7,8 the
long-term outlook remains poor.9 Risk-reducing

 salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) for women older than 35 years of
age to prevent OC or fallopian tube cancer (FTC) and to detect
occult neoplasia is recommended as the only proven mortality-
reducing intervention.10,11 Although effective when used
premenopausally,10,11 RRSO causes infertility and premature
menopause, with associated cardiovascular risks,12 osteoporosis,13
and neurologic risks14 (although premature menopause can be
treated with hormone replacement therapy). Some women decline
RRSO regardless of OC risk, and others prefer to defer it (eg, until
menopause). Effective OC screening would be a welcome option
for such women.
Annual OC screening in the general population that uses
a cutoff for the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)
was associated with improved survival.15 In the high-risk pop-
ulation, we16 and others17-20 have reported annual screening using
a CA-125 cutoff and transvaginal sonography (TVS). Although we
demonstrated high sensitivity (. 80%) and positive predictive
value (PPV; 25%), two symptomatic interval cancers occurred, and
69% of detected cancers were stage III to IV.16 This annual
screening interval has been associated with a poor 10-year survival
rate of 36% in BRCA1/2 carriers.21
Multimodal screening with the risk of ovarian cancer algo-
rithm (ROCA) to interpret serial CA-125 results, and TVS as
a second-line test, in the randomized general-population United
Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening
(UKCTOCS) achieved high sensitivity and specificity.22,23 Signif-
icantly more (40%) low-volume (stages I, II, or IIIa) invasive
epithelial ovarian/peritoneal cancers were identified compared
with unscreened controls (26%) on an intention-to-screen anal-
ysis, and the trial provided an encouraging, though not definitive,
mortality benefit.24
Random assignment to a nonscreening arm is thought to be
unacceptable to high-risk women and clinicians.16 Even if ethical, it
would likely be unfeasible, so research screening in this population
is limited to prospective cohort studies. To our knowledge, this is
the first published study to use ROCA-based screening to define
sensitivity in the high-risk population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
A prospective multicenter cohort screening study was undertaken within
the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). Ethical ap-
proval was given by the Eastern Multicentre Research Ethics Committee
(Reference No. 97/5/007). The protocol can be found online.25
Entry Criteria
High-risk women at an estimated minimum 10% lifetime risk of
OC were recruited; inclusion criteria (Data Supplement, online only)
depended on family history or predisposing mutations. Documentation
(death certificates and/or histopathology reports) of relevant cancers was
required, and eligibility was confirmed by the coordinating center (CC).
Clinical genetic testing was performed by accredited NHS laboratories.
After screening ended, 45.2% of the study population underwent BRCA1/2
next-generation sequencing research testing.26
Recruitment
Participants were recruited at 42 centers in the UK by specialist
nurses, clinical geneticists, or gynecologists. In December 2006, participants
in the UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UK FOCSS) Phase I
(annual screening using a CA-125 cutoff and TVS)16 were invited to join this
study—UK FOCSS Phase II. Other participants were recruited de novo.
Women were counseled about RRSO and screening limitations. All par-
ticipants provided written consent.
Screening
The trial database16 scheduled serum CA-125 tests every 4 months
and TVS annually. Venipuncture packs were mailed to participants for use
in primary care and blood samples returned to the CC laboratory for CA-
125 assay.23 Results were uploaded to the database, which calculated OC
risk using the high-risk ROCA, which also incorporated the higher a
priori risk in our population and different reference levels for risk strat-
ification for postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women, be-
cause of the higher baseline CA-125 and variability in premenopausal
women.27 Menopausal status was determined by the database by using the
age of participants and their responses to questions about gynecologic
history and/or symptoms, which were returned with serum samples (Data
Supplement).
Initial risk of ovarian cancer (ROC) was based on initial CA-125 level
and estimated age-specific OC incidence. Subsequently, ROC was based on
absolute CA-125 level and rate of change. Initially high or increasing CA-
125 levels (even , 30 iU/ml) generated a high ROC, whereas initially low,
stable-high (even . 30 iU/ml), or decreasing levels generated low ROCs.
ROCA results were used for triage, including expedition of repeat CA-125
tests and/or TVS after abnormal results (Data Supplement).
Collaborating centers performed scans and completed proformas
(Data Supplement), which were classified by the database according to
predetermined criteria (Data Supplement).16 When indicated, women
were referred to a gynecologist for clinical assessment, with a view to
surgical removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries. The final decision about
surgery was made after additional investigation and discussion with the
patient.
Follow-Up
Participants were flagged (by their unique NHS number) with rel-
evant cancer registries, which provided cancer and/or death data.16 Col-
laborators notified the CC when women withdrew before routine screening
ended (June 30, 2011). Women were observed through cancer registries
with censorship that was based on date of death, last notification from the
registry, or last contact if they were lost to registry follow-up. Participants
were sent health questionnaires in January 2011 and April 2013 specifically
asking about surgery that involved removal of fallopian tubes/ovaries and
cancer diagnosis.
Diagnostic Documentation
Whenever women underwent salpingo-oophorectomy, the CC ob-
tained documentation of indication, operation notes, and histopathology/
cytopathology reports. These were reviewed by a gynecologic oncologist
(A.N.R.) and pathologist (E.B./N.S.) and were classified according to the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). Trial surgery was defined as either
screen-positive or screen-related (nonconcerning abnormal results, such as
simple cysts and/or transient/stable abnormal ROC results that contrib-
uted to the participant’s decision to undergo surgery).15 Centers were
provided with an RRSO protocol, which advocated serial sectioning of
fallopian tubes/ovaries (Data Supplement). A surgical complexity score
was assigned using recognized criteria (Data Supplement).28
Statistical Analysis
For performance analyses, data were censored 365 days after the last
UK FOCSS screen. Invasive OC, FTC, or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC)
diagnosed , 365 days after the last screen were included. Cancers that
occurred after censoring and diagnosed before February 28, 2016 were

 reported but not included in the performance analyses. The study was
powered to estimate sensitivity within 10% (expected 95% CI), given an
annual OC incidence of 0.5%. Analyses were done with Stata (version 14;
STATA, College Station, TX).
Compliance with blood tests and scans was defined as the proportion
of requested tests received by the CC. These were analyzed separately and
according to screen type (eg, routine, protocol-indicated repeat).
Women who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy were only classified
as having undergone RRSO if they were asymptomatic, they had normal
results at prior screen, and the recruiting center indicated RRSO as the
reason for withdrawal. Cases in which abnormal results prompted surgery
were true positive (TP) if invasive epithelial OC/FTC was diagnosed. All
other diagnoses (including borderline/benign tumors) that resulted from
surgery that was prompted by abnormal results were false positive (FP).
Cases in which nonconcerning test results (simple cysts/transiently ele-
vated CA-125) contributed to the decision for surgery were classified as
screen-related surgery, to provide estimates of likely additional surgeries in
any future screening program. True-negative (TN) designations were for
those patients in whom the last screen was normal and no OC/FTC was
diagnosed , 365 days. Patients who presented with clinically diagnosed
interval cancers between screens or , 365 days after the final screen were
considered false negative (FN). Prevalent cases were those diagnosed at first
screen. Incident cases were those diagnosed subsequently. For women who
transferred from Phase I (annual CA-125 cutoff and scan) to Phase II
(ROCA every 4 months and annual TVS), their first Phase II screen was
classified as incident.
We reported performance according to whether occult cancers di-
agnosed , 365 days after a prior screen were classified as FN or TP.16 In an
attempt to estimate true sensitivity, we assumed that the proportion of
occult cancers identified at RRSO, which would have been screen detected
had women not undergone surgery, would be identical to that observed in
those who continued screening. We then used the lower confidence limit of

UK FOCSS Phase II Screening Results
 observed sensitivity in women who did not undergo RRSO as a con-
servative estimate of occult cancer detection sensitivity, and we
rounded the predicted number of occult cancers detected to the nearest
integer.
Because the protocol required parallel CA-125 and TVS, the results of
which influenced each other’s timing, it was not possible to calculate
performance characteristics per test. Therefore, we calculated these metrics
per woman-screen year (WSY) for the protocol overall.
To allocate WSYs to correct outcomes we applied the following rules;
for TP and FP detection screens, the WSYthat commenced with that screen
was classified as TP or FP, respectively. WSYs before the detection screen
were TN. For occult cancers diagnosed , 365 days after prior screen, the
WSY that commenced with that screen was classified as FN or TP (de-
pendent on analysis type), and prior WSYs were TN. For TN cases, all
WSYs were classified TN.
To investigate potentially avoidable delays, we analyzed screening
and screen-to-surgery intervals.16 Detection screens were defined as
an abnormal TVS and/or abnormal ROC that led to a surgery/biopsy
that diagnosed OC/FTC. Delayed screens were defined as any detection
screen performed after the protocol-indicated date. Delay was cal-
culated as the detection screen date minus the protocol-indicated date.
The interval from screen date to diagnosis was calculated to the date of
surgery/biopsy. We compared International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics stage and postsurgery zero residual disease rates in OC/
FTC diagnosed during and , 365 days from the end of UK FOCSS
screening with those diagnosed . 365 days after screening ended. We
also compared stage-distribution and zero residual disease rates in
incident screen-detected cancers in Phases I and II of the study. No
survival analysis was performed because of the low number of events
observed.
RESULTS
Between June 14, 2007, and May 15, 2012, 4,531 women were
recruited. This included 2,362 (66.3%) of 3,563 eligible women
from UK FOCSS Phase I (Fig 1). Table 1 lists inclusion indications.
A total of 183 (4.0%) women withdrew before screening (Fig 1).
The outcome of the remaining 4,348 women (96.0%) were ana-
lyzed. The median age at recruitment was 45.5 years (range, 34.2
to 84.8 years). Of the eligible women, 1,278 women (29.4% of
participants) underwent mutation testing, and 1,965 (45.2%)
subsequently underwent next-generation sequencing.24 Over-
all, 924 (21.3%) women were known mutation carriers (further
demographics in Data Supplement).
The last cancer notifications from NHS Digital were received
on February 28, 2016 (England/Wales), May 15, 2016 (Scotland),
and April 19, 2016 (Northern Ireland); the last death notifications
were received on March 14, 2016 (all countries). Follow-up was
possible for 4,046 women (93.1%). Median follow-up beyond last
screen/withdrawal was 4.7 years (range, 0 to 8.7 years).
Screening/Compliance
The 4,348 screened participants underwent 13,728 WSY
(median, 3.26 screen-years per woman; range, 1.00 to 5.94 screen-
years per woman). A total of 189 women (4.3%) ceased screening
by choice. Five hundred fifty-eight (12.8%) ceased because
of surgical removal of both fallopian tubes/ovaries for RRSO
(n = 534) or indeterminate reasons (n = 24). A total of 377 women
(8.7%) whose last screen was abnormal continued screening until
May 15, 2012, by which time 315 had normal results and did not
undergo surgery. Care was transferred to local gynecologists for the
62 women who still had abnormal results. Three of these 62 women
underwent surgery; none had cancer.
Compliance with requested routine CA-125 tests and scans
were 92.1% (27,138 of 29,450 CA-125 tests) and 94.6% (9,100 of
9,619 scans), respectively (Data Supplement). Compliance for
scans was based on reports received, not scans undertaken, so it is
likely an underestimate. Protocol-indicated repeat test compliance
was higher: 97.4% (4,716 of 4,834) of blood tests, and 98.8% (2,792
of 2,825 ) of scans requested were received.
Of the 32,587 blood samples received, routine tests comprised
83.3% (27,138 of 32,587), protocol-triggered repeats comprised
14.5% (4,716 of 32,587), and 2.2% (733 of 32,587) were requested
by study clinicians (eg, because CA-125 levels had increased by
$ 50%, despite a normal ROC). A total of 2,233 (6.9%) of 32,587
blood samples were discarded because they arrived more than 56
hours after venipuncture. Of the 12,038 scan results, 75.6% (9,100 of
12,038) were annual, 23.2% (2,792 of 12,038) were triggered early by
abnormal ROC results and/or previous abnormal scans, and 1.2%
(146 of 12,038) were repeated because of a poor view of the ovaries.
Overall, 162 (3.7%) of 4,348 women underwent screen-positive
trial surgery. Thirteen of these 162 women had screen-detected
cancers. The remaining 149 (3.4%) of the 4,348 women underwent

 false-positive surgery prompted by abnormal results (Table 2). Of
these 149 women who underwent false-positive surgery, 46 (30.9%)
had an abnormal ROC alone, 62 (41.6%) had an abnormal scan alone,
and 41 (27.5%) had abnormal results for both tests. Overall, 95
(63.8%) of the 149 women who underwent false-positive surgery had
benign ovarian pathology, two (1.3%) had borderline ovarian tumors,
and 52 (35.0%) had other/no pathology identified. An additional 37
(0.9%) of the 4,348 women underwent screen-related trial surgery.
Invasive OC/FTC/PPC
Thirty-seven women were diagnosed with invasive cancer
before February 28, 2016 (Table 3); nineteen occurred during
13,728 WSY , 365 days after prior screen and/or withdrawal
(annual incidence 0.14%). In addition, 18 women were diag-
nosed . 365 days after their last UK FOCSS screen (median,
666 days; range, 400 to 2,159 days). The median age at diagnosis in
the 37 women diagnosed with OC/FTC/PPC was 50 years (range,
37 to 79 years). All diagnoses occurred in families with hereditary
breast-ovarian cancer. Thirty-four (91.2%) of the 37 women were
diagnosed with high-grade serous carcinoma. Cancers in 31
(83.8%) of the 37 women occurred in mutation carriers—24
(64.9%) were BRCA1 carriers and seven (18.9%) were BRCA2
carriers. Three (8.1%) of the 37 women were BRCA1/2 negative;
one (2.7%) of the 37 women had a BRCA2 variant of unknown
significance; two (5.4%) of the 37 women were untested. Of the 37
women diagnosed with OC/FT/PPC, 23 (62.2%) knew they carried
pathogenic mutations and 14 (37.8%) had a history of breast
cancer. No OC occurred in women with a family history of LS or those
who were mutation carriers for the syndrome (n = 192; 558 WSY).
The 19 invasive OC/FTCs diagnosed within 365 days of prior
screen included one prevalent screen-positive OC (International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIc) and 18 in-
cident cancers. Twelve of the 18 incident OC/FTCs were screen
detected and six were occult cancers identified at RRSO. Of the
12 patients with incident screen-detected cancer, 11 (91.7%) had
an abnormal ROC and 5 (41.7%) had a normal TVS at detection
(compared with zero of 13 patients who had normal TVS at de-
tection in UK FOCSS Phase I; P = .015). The median CA-125 level
at detection was 53.8 iU/ml (range, 11.7 to 219.2 iU/ml) in UK
FOCSS Phase II (, 30 iU/ml in four of 12 patients) compared
with 73 iU/ml (range, 4 to 3,874 iU/ml) in Phase I, which did not
mandate assay type and recommended premenopausal and
postmenopausal cutoffs of 35 and 30 iU/ml, respectively, rather
than according to the ROCA. Five (38.5%) of the 13 screen-
detected OC/FTCs (CI, 13.9% to 68.4%) and 5 (83.3%) of the
six occult OC/FTCs (CI, 35.9% to 99.6%) were stage I to II.
Overall, 10 (52.6%) of the 19 cancers diagnosed within 365 days of
prior screen were stage I to II (CI, 28.9% to 75.6%).
Eighteen cancers were diagnosed . 365 days after the end of
UK FOCSS screening. Two occult cancers were detected at RRSO,
three cancers were detected at annual screening performed locally,
and 13 were detected when women presented with symptoms.
Only one (5.6%) of the 18 cancers was diagnosed at stage I to II (CI,
0.2% to 27.3%).
Women were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with stage

of 19; CI, 16.3% to 61.6%) compared with those diagnosed
subsequently (17 [94.4%] of 18; CI, 72.7% to 99.9%; P , .001).
Twelve (92.3%) of 13 women who had screen-detected cancers had
zero postsurgical residual disease (CI; 64.0% to 99.8%). Overall, 18
(94.8%) of 19 women diagnosed with OC during UK FOCSS had
zero postsurgical residual (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%) compared with 13
(72.2%) of 18 women who were diagnosed subsequently (CI, 46.5%
to 90.3%; P = .09). None of the women diagnosed during UK FOCSS
required complex surgery, one had interval surgery. Three of the
subsequently diagnosed women required complex surgery, seven had
interval surgery, and two had no debulking (Table 3). The proportion
of women diagnosed with OC during UK FOCSS who had neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy (1 [5.3%] of 19 women; CI, 0.1% to 26.0%)
was significantly lower than in the women diagnosed subsequently

UK FOCSS Phase II Screening Results
 (eight [44.4%] of 18 women; CI, 21.5% to 69.2%; P = .008). The
mean surgical complexity score28 inwomen diagnosed during screening
or less than 365 days after the final screen was 2.7 compared with 4.3 in
those diagnosed subsequently (Mann-Whitney U test, P = .16).
Screening/Surgical Intervals
The median delay in incident detection screens in this Phase II
study was 6 days (range, 0 to 87 days) compared with 88 days
(range, 6 to 737 days) in Phase I (gamma generalized linear model,
P = .004). The median interval between detection screen and
diagnosis in this Phase II study was 82 days (range, 9 to 209 days)
compared with 79 days (range, 15 to 184 days) in Phase I (P = not
significant). Reasons for the delay included falsely reassuring scans
and reluctance to undergo surgery (Table 3).
Screening Performance
All 13 cancers (100%) in women who did not undergo RRSO
were screen detected (CI, 75.3% to 100%). Hence, for modeled
sensitivity, the lower confidence limit of 75.3% was used to con-
servatively estimate the proportion of occult cancers which would
have been screen detected had women not undergone RRSO.
Modeled sensitivity, PPV, and negative predictive value (NPV)
for the detection of OC/FTC at 1 year for the whole population were
94.7% (CI, 74.0% to 99.9%), 10.8% (CI, 6.5% to 16.5%), and 100%
(CI, 100% to 100%), respectively. PPV was significantly better in
BRCA1/2 carriers than in women who had an unknown mutation
status (Table 4).
Comparison of Phase I With Phase II
Key comparisons of UK FOCSS Phase I and Phase II are listed
in Table 5. Rates of clinically presenting interval cancers, zero
residual disease after surgery, modeled sensitivity, proportions of
women diagnosed with cancer stage less than IIIb, screening delays,
and proportions with normal scans at referral were all better in
Phase II, but only the comparisons of screening delays and pro-
portions with normal scans at referral were significant.
DISCUSSION
These UK FOCSS Phase II results suggest that in a high-risk population,
ROCA-based multimodal screening every 4 months, alongside re-
minders of the effectiveness of RRSO, is associated with high sensitivity,
significantly lower high-volume disease, and a high zero residual disease
rate after surgerycompared withwomen from the same cohort inwhom
cancer was diagnosed . 1 year after screening ended. Two similar US
studies were published while this paper was in press as a combined
analysis, with three of six incident cancers found at stage I/II.29
The strengths of this study are its size, multicenter setting,
centralized screening with a validated algorithm, and reliable multiple-
source follow-up. A limitation is the nonrandomized design. However,
data about OC diagnosed after screening ended allowed comparisons
in the absence of a nonscreening arm. Other limitations include the
unknown mutation status of many participants and the small number
of incident cancers, which limited power. Although screening delays
were effectively eliminated (median, 6 days), the median interval
between abnormal results and surgery continued to be . 2 months
(82 days in this Phase II study v 79 days in Phase I). There were still
some long intervals as a result of patient reluctance to undergo surgery
and falsely reassuring imaging associated with an abnormal ROC at
referral, as seen in UKCTOCS.23
During and within 1 year of UK FOCSS screening, no patients
with interval cancers presented with symptoms, sensitivity was

 high, and there was a significant stage shift compared with patients
who had cancers diagnosed more than 1 year after screening ended.
The significantly higher proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage IIIa
or lower (ie, microscopic abdominal disease at worst) during the
study was associated with more primary surgery and with higher
zero residual disease achieved with less complex surgery. Published
complete cytoreduction rates in clinically presenting BRCA1/2
carriers ranged from 28% to 30%.2,30 The overall findings suggest
a screening-mediated reduction in disease volume. It is likely this
would translate into reduced surgical morbidity and fewer in-
complete resections. It remains unknown whether this would im-
prove survival in screened high-risk women. We were unable to
analyze survival, because there were only three deaths in the 37
women with invasive OC/FTC/PPCs at censorship on March 14,
2016. Although this is encouraging, medium-term survival of OC in
BRCA1/2 carriers is better than that of BRCA1/2-negative patients.7,8
The performance characteristics of screening every 4 months
were encouraging; overall incident sensitivity was 94.7%, with
occult cancer detection modeled, and PPV was 10.8% (ie, greater
than the suggested 10% level for general-population screening).16
However, PPV is less relevant in high-risk populations for whom
RRSO is already recommended as optimal management. As ex-
pected, PPV was better in BRCA1/2 carriers (42.9%) than in
women who had an unknown mutation status (7.7%) because of
the lower cancer incidence in women with an unknown status.
The high compliance with blood tests and TVS suggests that the
protocol is feasible and acceptable. However, compliance might not
be maintained outside a trial. A parallel psychological study found
moderate cancer distress at 1 week in women with abnormal ROCA
and/or scan results, which led to higher withdrawal from screen-
ing.31 However, there was no significant effect on general anxiety
and/or depression on return to routine screening or at 9 months.
In conclusion, our protocol achieves encouraging perfor-
mance characteristics, is associated with a low rate of high-volume
disease at primary surgery, and had a high zero residual disease rate
at low levels of surgical complexity. RRSO remains the treatment of
choice for women at high-risk of OC/FTC. In those not ready or
willing to undergo surgery, multimodal screening using ROCA
every 4 months and TVS (at an interval determined by the ROCA),
with regular discussions about the effectiveness of RRSO, appears
to be a better option than symptom awareness alone. Such
screening should not be viewed as an alternative to surgery, but it
does seem to offer a better chance of avoiding a diagnosis of
advanced incompletely resectable OC/FTC in the interim.
