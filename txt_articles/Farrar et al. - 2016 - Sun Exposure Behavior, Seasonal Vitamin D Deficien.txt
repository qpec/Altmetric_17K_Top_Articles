Context: Vitamin D is essential for bone health in adolescence, when there is rapid bone mineral
content accrual. Because cutaneous sun exposure provides vitamin D, there is no recommended
oral intake for UK adolescents.
Objective: Our objective was to assess seasonal vitamin D status and its contributors in white
Caucasian adolescents and examine bone health in those found deficient.
Design: Prospective cohort study was undertaken.
Setting: Six schools in Greater Manchester, UK, were included.
Participants: Participants were 131 adolescents between 12 and 15 years of age.
Intervention(s): Seasonal assessment of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), personal sun
exposure, and dietary vitamin D. Adolescents deficient (25OHD �10 ng/ml/25 nmol/liter) in at least
one season underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (lumbar spine, femoral neck), with bone
mineral apparent density correction for size, and peripheral quantitative computed tomography
(distal radius) for volumetric bone mineral density (BMD).
Main Outcome Measure: Serum 25OHD and BMD measurements.
Results: Mean 25OHD was highest in September: 24.1 (SD, 6.9) ng/ml and lowest in January: 15.5
(5.9) ng/ml. Over the year, 16% were deficient in � one season and 79% insufficient (25OHD �20
ng/ml/50 nmol/liter) including 28% in September. Dietary vitamin D was low year-round, whereas
personal sun exposure was seasonal and predominantly across the school week. Holidays ac-
counted for 17% variation in peak 25OHD (P � .001). Nineteen adolescents underwent bone
assessment, which showed low femoral neck bone mineral apparent density vs matched reference
data (P � .0002), three with Z less than or equal to �2.0 distal radius trabecular volumetric BMD.
Conclusions: Sun exposure levels failed to provide adequate vitamin D, with approximately one-
quarter of adolescents insufficient even at summer peak. Seasonal vitamin D deficiency was prev-
alent and those affected had low BMD. Recommendations on vitamin D acquisition are indicated
in this age-group. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 3105–3113, 2016)

itamin D regulates calcium absorption and bone
mineralization and is essential for bone health.
Vitamin D deficiency, a circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin
D (25OHD) concentration of less than 10 ng/ml (25
nmol/liter) (1, 2), can cause rickets in children and os-
teomalacia in adolescents and adults. Higher levels are
desirable, with less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) re-
garded insufficient by several authorities (3–5) because
of an association with suboptimal musculoskeletal
health (6). Maintaining vitamin D status is particularly
important during adolescence, a critical time for bone
development, with approximately one-third of adult

 peak bone mineral content accrued during the pubertal
growth spurt (7, 8).
The major source of vitamin D is cutaneous synthesis
initiated through sunlight’s UVB, with usually only low
amounts obtained through diet. Previtamin D, formed by
UVB conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol, undergoes heat
isomerization to vitamin D then hepatic hydroxylation to
25OHD, the main circulating form and accepted indicator
of vitamin D status. A further, renal, hydroxylation pro-
duces the active hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. At
northerly latitudes, negligible UVB in winter sunlight
means vitamin D must be made and stored during summer
months (9).
CurrentUKnationalguidanceonvitaminDacquisition
assumes those aged 4–64 years gain their vitamin D re-
quirements from sunlight alone, thus there is no recom-
mended nutrient intake (1). Short, regular exposures to
summer sunlight containing the requisite UVB are consid-
ered to avoid vitamin D deficiency (10). However, exces-
sive UV radiation (UVR) exposure is the principal external
cause of most skin cancers, with childhood sunburn a risk
factor for later development of melanoma (11). Thus, rec-
ommendations to protect children include limiting sun
exposure between 11 AM and 3 PM, wearing covering cloth-
ing and sunscreen (12). Meanwhile, substantial propor-
tions of the global population, including the UK, are re-
portedtohavelowvitaminDstatus(9,13),andricketshas
returned as a clinical concern (14).
Thecross-sectionalNationalDietandNutritionSurvey
of the UK white population indicated that in 1997–1998,
10%bloodsamplesof11–14yearoldshad25OHDbelow
10 ng/ml and 40% below 20 ng/ml, all seasons combined
(15). Adolescents appeared at greater risk of low vitamin
D status than younger children, with amount of outdoor
exercise a contributor (16). A more recent mixed-ethnicity
study found 73% of 51 female adolescents (37 nonwhite)
had 25OHD lower than 12 ng/ml (17). These studies in-

The aim of this study was to determine vitamin D status
throughout the year, influence of personal sun exposure,
and dietary vitamin D intake in white adolescents, and to
examine bone health parameters in those found vitamin D
deficient in one or more seasons.
Materials and Methods
Study design and subjects
A single-center, prospective cohort study in healthy, ambu-
lant white Caucasian (sun-reactive skin type I–IV) (18) adoles-
cents, 12–15 years of age. History of photosensitivity was an
exclusion criterion. Subjects were recruited through five fee-pay-
ing schools and one free (state) school in Greater Manchester,
UK. In January, April, June, and September 2011, blood samples
were taken for 25OHD, personal sun exposure, and ambient
UVB levels were evaluated, and dietary vitamin D estimated.
Adolescents with vitamin D deficiency underwent bone assess-
ment between June and September 2012. Ethical approval was
obtained (North Manchester Research Ethics Committee, 10/
H1008/58), and volunteers gave written informed consent. The
study was performed according to Declaration of Helsinki
principles.
Serum 25OHD and biochemical analyses
Serum was stored at �20°C until study completion. Concen-
trations of 25OHD were determined by liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry using an ABSciex 5500 tandem mass
spectrometer and the Chromsystems 25OHD kit for liquid chro-
matography tandem mass spectrometry, following the manufac-
turers’ instructions (intra- and interassay coefficient of variation
3.7% and 4.8%, respectively). The laboratory is accredited by
Clinical Pathology Accreditation UK (No. 0865) and certified
proficient by the Vitamin D Quality Assurance Scheme (DE-
QAS). Serum PTH was measured in January and September us-
ing the OCTEIA immunoenzymometric assay following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd)
with sensitivity 0.06 pmol/liter (intra- and interassay coefficient
of variation 4% and 6%, respectively). Baseline serum biochem-
istry included calcium, renal, and liver function.
Personal and ambient UVR, time outdoors, and
dietary vitamin D assessment
Adolescents wore polysulphone film badge UVR dosimeters
(9), 1 week in each season, on outer clothing of upper chest/
anterior shoulder, with one badge for weekdays and one for
weekend. Dosimeters recorded total erythemal dose as a proxy
for UVR exposure effective for vitamin D synthesis. Badges were
included in analyses unless unworn (information from subject;
absent pinhole in badge holder). Ambient UVR was recorded
during badge-wearing weeks using a GUV-541 filter radiometer
(Biospherical Instruments Inc.; positioned at latitude 53.47°N,
longitude –0.23W, altitude 76 m) based at the University of
Manchester. This instrument supplies a 1 minute average of er-
ythemal irradiance, and runs continuously as part of an atmo-
spheric monitoring program (19) providing data for the Euro-
pean UV Database and the World Ozone and Ultraviolet
Radiation Data Centre of the World Meteorological Organiza-
tion. Adolescents concurrently completed sun exposure diaries

 tions, clothing, dedicated sunscreen product and sun protection
factor–containing face cream use (9), and oral vitamin D intake
was estimated through daily dietary logs recording: vitamin D
supplements; vitamin D–fortified foods; oily fish, butter, mar-
garine and other spreads; milk; eggs; cheese; and red meat (20).
Diary days were excluded from analyses if not completed.
Bone assessments
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of lumbar
spine (LS) and proximal femur were performed using an Hologic
QDR 4500 Discovery scanner (Hologic), software version
12.6.1, fast array mode (21). Measurements of bone mineral
content, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone area were made
in the LS L1-L4 and femoral neck (FN). Bone mineral apparent
density (BMAD) was calculated as described for LS (22) and FN
(23). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of
nondominant radius was performed by XCT-2000 scanner
(Stratec), software version 5.5d (24). Trabecular and total (cor-
tical � trabecular) volumetric BMD (vBMD) were measured at
the 4% distal site. Data were compared to sex- and age-matched
published reference data for Manchester white Caucasian ado-
lescents for DXA (n � 442, 239 males) (21) and pQCT (n � 629,
380 males) (24). Results are expressed as SD from the age-
matched mean (Z score) (25, 26), with Z score below –2.0 de-
fined as reduced BMAD or vBMD.
Statistical analysis
A sample of n � 100 permitted assessment of population SD
with adequate precision (27), and gave 80% power (0.05�) to
detect correlations higher than 0.3 between 25OHD level and

dropout. Post hoc comparisons were made between males vs
females and fee-paying vs state schools using Mann-Whitney
test, and within-season weekday vs weekend UVR exposure and
time outdoors by Wilcoxon signed-rank test, without adjust-
ment for multiple testing. Multiple linear regression explored
associations between late summer peak 25OHD and demo-
graphic and behavioral characteristics; models first assessed how
much 25OHD variation demographic factors could explain, fol-
lowing which behavioral factors were added. Sun exposure,
25OHD and body mass index data were log-transformed to lin-
earize relationships and stabilize variance. Proportion of ex-
plained variance was quantified by reduction in R2 as behavioral
variables were removed from the model. To reduce “overfit-
ting,” variables were selected based on substantive interest and
previous multivariable analyses of other cohorts (9). Analyses
were performed on available-case basis and assumed no system-
atic differences between subjects with complete and missing
data, beyond those accounted for by factors included in the
model.
Results
The study population comprised 131 adolescents. Three
withdrew after the first data collection period and six after
the second. Seventy-five adolescents provided blood sam-
ples in four seasons, 38 in three, 11 in two, and 7 in one
season. Dietary log return was 71–88% across seasons
(88–97% complete); sun exposure diary return was 72–
91% (84–95% complete); badge return was 61–71% for
weekday (93–99% complete; ie, worn 5 days) and 52–
76% for weekend (96–100% complete; ie, worn 2 days).
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Baseline
serum biochemistry showed no substantive abnormalities.
Circulating 25OHD levels showed a seasonal cycle
(Figure 1A), mean (SD) 25OHD reaching a September
peak of 24.1 (6.9) ng/ml where 28% and 3% adolescents
had levels below 20 and below 10 ng/ml, respectively (Fig-
ure 1B). Mean 25OHD at January trough was 15.5 (5.9)
ng/ml, with 74% and 17% at less than 20 and than less 10
ng/ml, respectively. In total, 21 adolescents had 25OHD
below 10 ng/ml: 2 year-round, 2 in three seasons, 6 in two
seasons, and 11 in one season; only 4 adolescents in this
subgroup achieved 25OHD of at least 20 ng/ml during the
year (June/September). For males, mean 25OHD was 23.9
(7.2) and 14.7 (5.5) ng/ml in September and January, and
for females 24.3 (6.7) and 16.3 (6.1) ng/ml, respectively,
with no significant between-sex difference in levels or
%subjects below 20 or below 10 ng/ml. Mean (SD) PTH
in January and September was 45 (16) and 41 (16) pg/ml,
respectively.
Median personal UVR dose assessed through polysul-
phone badges followed seasonal ambient UVR, and
showed higher exposure was acquired across the school-
week than the weekend (Figure 1C). Total UVR dose over
seven days correlated with 25OHD in June (Spearman � �
0.31; P � .02; n � 59) and not in other seasons. Median
personal UVR/d was lower on weekend days than preced-
ing weekdays in all seasons, with males receiving higher
UVR doses/d on weekdays in June and September than
females (P � .001; data not shown).
In their diaries, adolescents recorded a similar total
time/d outdoors on the weekends and weekdays, such that
the school week contributed more than the weekend to
total time/week outdoors (Table 2, Figure 2, A and B).
Overall, the longest periods of time outdoors were in June,
the month with most daylight hours and ambient UVB,

 males spending more time outdoors than females (Table
2). Time recorded outdoors/d between 10:00 and 15:00
hours was lower on weekdays, where dictated by the
school-day routine, than on weekend days in all seasons
(all P � .001).
Males exposed less %skin surface area on weekdays
than weekends in all seasons, attributable to more cov-
ering school uniform, whereas females exposed similar
skin surface area at weekdays and weekends (Table 2).
Head garments (comprising hats and caps) were worn
infrequently.
Remarkably, no adolescents reported wearing dedi-
cated sunscreen products in any season in the United
Kingdom. No males and few females used sun protection
factor–containing face cream once/more during the re-
porting periods: six (6%), nine (9%), ten (11%), and nine
(8%) adolescents in June, September, January, and April,
respectively.
The majority (86%) of adolescents reported a holiday
on at least one occasion during the study, most frequently
at European locations, latitudes 41–50°N, during July–
August (Supplemental Table 1). Their mean 25OHD was
24.8 (6.3) and 15.9 (5.7) ng/ml in September and January,
respectively, compared with 18.5 (8.9) and 12.7 (6.7) in
those not taking a holiday.
Estimated dietary vitamin D was low with no seasonal
difference. Median (interquartile range) vitamin D intake
for January, April, June, and September was 2.1 (1.3–3.4),
1.9 (1.1–3.3), 1.7 (1.0–2.7), and 1.9 (1.1–2.9) �g/d, re-
spectively. Only 27 adolescents (21%; five males) took
supplements containing vitamin D in at least one season
(range, 0.02–20 �g/d). Mean 25OHD of this group was
24.6 (6.2) and 17.0 (5.4) ng/ml in September (n � 25) and
January (n � 16), respectively. Only five adolescents (4%;
all females) took supplements year-round; their mean
25OHD was 27.5 (6.8) and 17.3 (6.2) ng/ml in September
and January, respectively.
Adolescents at private school had lower 25OHD levels
than those at state school (mean, 21.8 vs 24.6 ng/ml in
June; P � .02). Further exploration revealed their lower
UVR dose/d than state school adolescents on weekdays in
April, June, and September (P � .02 to � 0.001), no dif-
ference at weekends, and that they spent less time/d out-
doors on weekdays in these periods (median 72, 83, 69 vs
150, 162, 158 minutes, respectively; all P � .001).
Multiple linear regression showed demographic factors
explained very little (R2 � 0.07) of variation in September
25OHD, no individual factor being a significant predictor
(Table 3). Addition of behavioral factors substantially in-
creased the variation in September 25OHD explained by
the model (R2 � 0.33; Table 3). Taking a holiday at any
time during the year explained 17% variation, accounting
for approximately half the predictive value of the model.
Bone densitometry data for the 19 vitamin D deficient
adolescents (10 males) completing bone assessments are
expressed as SD (Z) scores, calculated using Manchester
ethnicity-specific, sex- and age-matched reference data for
DXA (21) and pQCT (24) (Figure 3). The group’s mean Z
score of –0.8 for FN BMAD was significantly lower than
the reference population (P � .0002). Mean LS BMAD Z
score was –0.2 and LS BMAD was categorized as normal
in all but one adolescent whose measurement was reduced
(Z score �–2.0), whereas the FN BMAD Z score was at
least –2.0 in all adolescents. The distal radius mean vBMD
Z score of –0.4 for trabecular bone was the same as for
total bone. Three males had reduced (Z score �–2.0) tra-

Discussion
We have addressed a knowledge gap regarding longitudi-
nal vitamin D status and personal sun exposure levels in
adolescence. A clear seasonal pattern was seen in circu-
lating 25OHD in white adolescents at mid-UK latitude
(equivalent to Edmonton, Canada, and Hamburg, Ger-
many), with highest mean concentration (24.1 ng/ml) at
the end of summer, followed by early summer, reflecting
the higher personal UVR exposure observed in summer
and spring, respectively (Figure 1, A and C). A key finding
was the remarkably high prevalence of vitamin D defi-
ciency in this white cohort, 16% adolescents demonstrat-
ing 25OHD below 10 ng/ml in at least one season. More-
over, 28% and 74% adolescents failed to reach the
desirable 20 ng/ml level at the general summer peak and
winter trough, respectively. Previous UK studies reporting
10% (15) and 2.9% (27) of white adolescents with
25OHD below 10 ng/ml examined 25OHD on a single
occasion. Our study highlights the value of repeated, sea-
sonal, measures, and shows a greater than anticipated po-
tential for suboptimal bone health revealed in this age
group.
We found dietary vitamin D did not contribute to sea-
sonal vitamin D status change, median intake across sea-
sons being low and constant at 1.7–2.1 �g/d. This low
intake is consistent with the 1.7 �g/d reported for a similar
age group in Northern Ireland, UK (28) and the lower end
of the range reported in Europe (29). This is lower than the
5 �g/d recommended by the World Health Organization
(30) and the 2.7–4.2 �g/d across seasons found in white
adultswhowerestudiedunderidenticalprotocolstothecur-
rentstudyinGreaterManchester(9).VitaminDsupplement
use was low and irregular with very few adolescents taking
them in all seasons, although a gender difference was noted,
with 22/27 taking supplements being female.
Personal sun exposure levels assessed through both
measurement of polysulphone badge UVR dose and dia-
ries recording time outdoors, highlighted the greater con-

 tribution of the school week relative to the weekend (Fig-
ures 1C and 2A). A pattern of higher badge UVR dose/d
was seen according to season, and also on weekdays com-
pared with weekend days in all seasons. Weekend dose
showed a greater variability than weekday, reflecting
school-day regularity. Adolescents’ diaries indicated that
the higher badge UVR dose/d on weekdays compared to
weekend days was not due to longer recorded time spent
outdoors (total time or 10:00–15:00 hours). Future stud-
ies could explore whether this relates to greater use of
shaded outdoor space on weekends, such as town centers
with tall buildings. Compliance with badge-wearing may
also contribute, through enhanced supervision on school
days. Previous data on personal sun exposure of adoles-
cents at northerly latitudes are sparse, with one available
study in the United Kingdom; this assessed 14–15 year
olds (n � 86) across April–July 1994 and revealed their
lowerexposurelevelsrelativetoyoungerchildren(31,32).
Median times outdoors for adolescents were 99 and 90
minutes/d on weekdays and weekends, thus by compar-
ison with our data (Table 2) there is no indication that
overall time spent outdoors by UK adolescents has
fallen in the past 20 years. A Danish study performed in
three summers, 1999–2001, indicated that children and
older teenagers spent less time outdoors (approximately
40–50 minutes/d; again found to be higher in the
younger than the older group) than the adolescents in
our study; however, assessment methods differed and
prevailing weather conditions may have contributed
(32, 33).
Because total sun exposure received during the school
week is greater than at weekends, school activity timeta-
bling and sun protection policy can have major impact on
vitamin D status in adolescents. Interestingly, in our co-
hort state school adolescents demonstrated higher UVR
doses and longer time outdoors on weekdays than private
schooladolescents,whichmayreflectdifferencesinschool
activities/conditions. Overall, males spent more time out-
doors than females, although their weekday uniform cov-
ered a higher skin surface area (Table 2), and a similar
vitamin D status was seen.
Approximately one-third of the observed variation in
peak (September) 25OHD was accounted for with the
factors included in the multivariable regression model.
Holiday-taking dominated as a predictor of peak level,
accounting for 17% of the variation in the sample. We
estimate that a participant taking a holiday had 1.8� the
peak 25OHD, on average, of a participant who did not. In
contrast, the school day routine and uniform of the ado-
lescents during weekdays produced an overall low varia-
tion in sun exposure behavior in this UK sample, which
may explain why these parameters were not explanatory
in the model.
Subclinical vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect
bone mineralization in adolescents because of a high per-
centage of bone mineral content accrual at this life stage
(8). Peak bone mass is also considered an important de-
terminant of osteoporotic fracture risk in later life (7).
Female adolescents with low 25OHD (�16 or �18.5 ng/
ml) are reported to have lower distal radius areal BMD
than those with higher 25OHD (�16 or 29.6 ng/ml, re-
spectively) (6, 34), with no difference for males (6). Our
wider assessment of bone health in seasonal vitamin D
deficiency (25OHD �10 ng/ml) contributes evidence that
bone mineralization is suboptimal in low vitamin D status
adolescents. We found a small proportion of these defi-
cient adolescents had clinically significantly reduced BMD
(either BMAD or vBMD; Z score �–2.0), whereas the
subgroup as a whole had significantly lower FN BMAD
scores than the Manchester reference population for this
age group (Figure 3). If a pattern of seasonal vitamin D
deficiency is maintained through adolescence, children
may fail to accrue their potential peak bone mass, with
implications for future bone health. A meta-analysis of six
randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation con-
ducted in Finland, Denmark, China, and Lebanon, in
mainly female, mixed-ethnicity 10–17 year olds, con-

 cluded that although supplementation of those with
25OHD below 14 ng/ml could give clinically useful BMD
improvement, this requires confirmation (35).
Strengths of this study include pan-seasonal assessment
of 25OHD, personal UVR dose, time outdoors, and diet,
providing a more comprehensive picture of behavior/life-
style and vitamin D status than single-point assessments,
and distinguishing seasonal from the less prevalent sus-
tained vitamin D deficiency. A further strength is our fol-
low-up investigation of bone health parameters in the de-
ficient subset, using robust bone densitometry and
interpretative methods. For LS and FN, BMAD was cal-
culated, as the standard measure of DXA (areal BMD) can
cause underestimates in children. BMAD adjusts for bone
thickness by calculating volumetric density and is a more
appropriate measurement in this age group (22, 23).
Moreover, Z scores were calculated by comparison to
large local reference datasets for DXA and pQCT, avoid-
ing incorrect classification of individuals as having low
bone density for their age (21, 24). Limitations include
behavioralassessmentsin1-weeksnapshotsperseasonfor
reasons of compliance, sparse detail on outdoor activities
because of overall intensity of assessments, and absent
bone densitometry data for the whole cohort. The P values

 presented in this manuscript are nominal owing to the
large number of comparisons available.
In conclusion, a high percentage of this UK white ad-
olescent sample had serum 25OHD falling below the 20
ng/ml sufficiency level and even into deficiency (�10 ng/
ml). Seasonally deficient adolescents had significantly
lowered FN BMAD compared with local reference data.
Taking holidays was a significant predictor of 25OHD,
and vitamin D supplement use was scarce. As UK current
sun exposure patterns do not provide an adequate source
of vitamin D, amendments are required to recommenda-
tions on vitamin D acquisition in this age group. Although
wider skin surface area exposure to sunlight might safely
increase vitamin D status, oral vitamin D supplements
may be beneficial during this critical time for bone
development.
