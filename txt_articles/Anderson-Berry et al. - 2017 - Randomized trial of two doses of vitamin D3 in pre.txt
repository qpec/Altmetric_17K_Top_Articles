Abstract
Background
Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation for preterm infants span a wide range of
doses. Response to vitamin D supplementation and impact on outcomes in preterm infants
is not well understood.
Objective
Evaluate serum 25(OH)D3 concentration changes after 4 weeks in response to two different
doses of vitamin D3 supplementation in a population of premature infants and quantify the
impact on NICU outcomes.
Design
32 infants born at 24–32 weeks gestation were prospectively randomized to receive 400 or
800 IU/day vitamin D3 supplementation. Serum 25(OH)D3 levels were measured every 4
weeks. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare serum levels of 25(OH)D3 at 4
weeks and each subsequent time point. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Serum 25(OH)D3 levels at birth were 41.9 and 42.9 nmol/l for infants in the 400 IU group
and 800 IU group, respectively (p = 0.86). Cord 25(OH)D3 concentrations significantly corre-
lated with gestational age (r = 0.40, p = 0.04). After 4 weeks of D3 supplementation, median
25(OH)D3 levels increased in both groups (84.6vs. 105.3 nmol/l for 400 vs. 800 IU/day

the 400 IU group were significantly more likely to have dual energy x-ray absorptiometry

Conclusions
Improvement in 25(OH)D3 levels at 4 weeks, bone density, and trends towards improve-
ment in linear growth support consideration of a daily dose of 800 IU of vitamin D for infants
<32 weeks cared for in the NICU.
Background
Vitamin D status has impact on current and future health in children and neonates and has
documented impact in most organ systems in the body, making it a critical area of research
[1]. Many aspects of clinical application of vitamin D supplementation in the smallest preterm
infants need additional supportive evidence. Vitamin D supplementation for preterm and
term neonates is currently recommended by many groups including the American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the Endocrine Society, and the European
Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) [2]. However,
significant differences remain in the recommended target goals for 25(OH)D levels and in the
recommended doses for specific neonatal populations from these expert bodies (Table 1). The
IOM recommends a 25(OH)D level of 50 nmol/l based on bone health and mineralization.
This recommendation is based, in part, off of work by Priemel et al evaluating bone

 mineralization defects and vitamin D deficiency in iliac crest bone of adults [3]. The authors of
this paper however, conclude that doses of supplementation of vitamin D should ensure 25
(OH)D levels of 75 nmol/l to maintain skeletal health. There is an obvious lack of substantial
data in infancy with regards to bone health and ideal supplementation. Additionally, many
recommendations are specifically for term neonates and do not apply to preterm, very low
birth weight (VLBW) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. The AAP and ESPGHAN
statements that do provide recommended intakes for preterm infants differ, and are based on
limited prospective randomized controlled trial evidence [2–4]. The Endocrine Society also
recommends a target level of >75 nmol/l and ESPGHAN an even higher target of >80 nmol/l.
Very little data is available regarding response to vitamin D supplementation in the smallest
and youngest infants (<1200 grams at birth), a population that might see the most benefit
from normalized vitamin D status. Supplementation during NICU hospitalization with 800 IU
in a cohort of infants <1500 grams showed no safety concerns with all infants having levels
above 25 nmol/l but 21% of infants still insufficient at 36 weeks CGA [10]. Another trial evalu-
ating placebo, 200 IU and 800 IU daily vitamin D supplement evaluated levels at 36 weeks and
days of respiratory support, showing prevention of vitamin D deficiency with the 800 IU dose,
and an improvement in serum levels with the 200 IU dose as compared to placebo, but no dif-
ference in days alive or in respiratory support [11].
Historically, levels of 25(OH)D greater than 50 nmol/l have been associated with prevention
of rickets in infants and children, a disease of extreme nutritional deficiency. As the role of
vitamin D in immune function, respiratory health, allergy and atopic disease, and many other
tissue and organ functions becomes apparent, adjustments have been suggested in optimal
serum level of 25(OH)D [12–14]. Recent literature from adult, pediatric and neonatal popula-
tions demonstrate improved outcomes such as normalization of PTH at levels >75 nmol/l
[15–17].
It is likely that preterm infants will have a compromised vitamin D status at birth. Many
studies in the United States and abroad have documented maternal status to be suboptimal
and have called for national programs to improve maternal vitamin D status with increased
supplementation dose and frequency [18–26]. The fetus relies solely on maternal stores for
vitamin D in utero, and typically has cord blood levels approximately 50–75% of the maternal
value [6,27,28]. Bodnar showed as few as 4.1% of black and 37.3% of term white infants having
adequate (>80 nmol/l) levels at delivery, while McCarthy showed 78% of infants to have lower
than optimal levels [18,29]. Importantly, several studies have documented an association with
decreasing 25(OH)D levels and lower gestational age at delivery allowing for a situation where
preterm infants are a highly vulnerable population at birth with regards to their vitamin D sta-
tus [15,28,30].
Vitamin D intake during the first year of life from milk or formula diet and supplemental
foods has not been shown to consistently equal 400 IU/day, the amount recommended by the
AAP or the IOM for term infants [31,32]. Preterm infants have a smaller size, leading to
decreased volume intake, and often have a compromised nutritional status during the initial
hospitalization and are even less likely to get adequate vitamin D intake from diet [15].
Our objective with this double blinded, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the
effects of two different doses (400 IU vs 800 IU) of vitamin D3 on a preterm patient population
for the duration of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization with respect to
improvement in percentage of infants with 25(OH)D levels >75 nmol/l, growth, PTH normal-
ization, and bone density as measured by global (DEXA) measurements. Additionally, we will
evaluate response to supplementation in the subset of infants weighing <1200 grams as there
is minimal information available regarding response to vitamin D supplementation in this spe-
cific high-risk group.

 Methods
Institutional Review Board permission was obtained (final version– 3, approved March 1,
2012) to enroll with parental consent from parents aged 19 or greater, patients <32 weeks ges-
tational age to be enrolled in the randomized controlled trial in a Midwestern academic medi-
cal center Newborn Intensive Care Unit. The study statistician generated a randomization
sequence stratified by race (white and non-white) using SAS software and the study pharma-
cist randomized each infant. Infants were randomized to receive either 400 IU or 800 IU of
vitamin D3 enterally with the initiation of enteral feedings in addition to parenteral MVI while
on parenteral nutrition and enteral vitamin D from breast milk and human milk fortifier or
preterm formula. The study vitamin D was delivered in a brown oral syringe (to protect the
product from light) and the product was identical in color, volume and smell regardless of
dose. The screening and flow of infant enrollment is shown in Fig 1. All vitamin D

 formulations were prepared and dispensed by a research pharmacist who was independent of
the study. Investigators and NICU staff were blinded to subject group assignment. Serum 25
(OH)D3 levels were measured every 4 weeks simultaneously in triplicate using a novel, very
sensitive LC-MS/MS-based method involving derivatization with DMEQ-TAD in the Depart-
ment of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences at Queens University, Ontario, Canada. Serum
iPTH was measured using The Access Intact PTH assay (Beckman-Coulter Inc, Fullerton, CA,
USA) [33]. Serum calcium was measured using the SYNCHRON1 System (Beckman-Coulter
Inc, Fullerton, CA, USA). At-term corrected gestational age (40 weeks +/- 4 weeks) bone den-
sity was measured by total body DEXA scan (Discovery A (SIN85958) Hologic, Software
v.13.3). Premature infant bone density was evaluated based on curves published by Rigo et al
[34]. Exclusion criteria included infants with congenital abnormalities, gastro-intestinal, liver,
or kidney disease, inborn errors of metabolism, parathyroid disease, disorders of calcium
metabolism, and infants receiving seizure medication or steroids. The study was registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01469650).
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 32 infants (16 per group) was needed to achieve 80% power to detect a differ-
ence after 4 weeks of intervention of 7.2 ng/ml (18 nmol/L) between the null hypothesis that
both group means are 23.1 ng/ml (57.7 nmol/L) 25(OH)D and the alternative hypothesis that
the mean of the 800 IU group is 30.3 ng/ml (75.6 nmol/L) 25(OH)D with known within-group
standard deviation of 7.0 ng/ml (17.5 nmol/L) and an α = 0.05. All data were analyzed follow-
ing the intention-to-treat paradigm, in which infants were analyzed according to their ran-
domized assignment. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous data between
the dose groups and the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for comparisons between time
points. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical data between the dose groups. Asso-
ciations between continuous variables were assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient.
All statistical analysis were performed utilizing SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Thirty-two infants were enrolled in the study (16 per group) and were included in the final
analysis. 38% of the total study population was classified as non-white and this was equal in
both dosing groups. Infants in the 400 IU dosing group were 43% female, and infants in the
800 IU group were 50% female, a non-significant difference. There were no significant differ-
ences between the two groups at birth. Gestational age, birth anthropometrics and in hospital
growth are presented in Table 2.
25OHD changes by vitamin D dose
Cord blood 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly correlated with gestational age (r = 0.40,
p = 0.04), but had no correlation with sex or race. Concentration of 25(OH)D2 were not
detectable in any of the samples; therefore, all results presented are for serum 25(OH)D3 con-
centrations. After 4 weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation in addition to dietary vitamin D
intake, median 25(OH)D3 levels increased in both groups (84.6 vs. 105.3 nmol/l for 400 vs. 800
IU/day respectively), with significantly greater improvement in the higher dose group
(p = 0.048). After 8 weeks of D3 supplementation, median 25(OH)D3 levels increased in both
groups (135 vs. 164 nmol/l for 400 vs. 800 IU/day respectively, p = 0.3) (Table 3). Due to

 discharge from the NICU which led to discontinuation of study participation, it is likely there
were too few subjects included at this time point to detect a statistically significant difference
in 25(OH)D levels between the two groups. After 8 weeks of treatment; however, a larger pro-
portion of patients receiving the 800-dose level had 25(OH)D3 levels above 75 nmol/l relative
to patients receiving the 400-dose level (89% vs. 73%, p = 0.59) however, this did not reach sta-
tistical significance with no reportable differences in the two groups at this time point. Infant
25(OH)D levels had significant change between week 4 and 8 (p = 0.0003), 400 group
(p = 0.0186) and 800 group (p = 0.0156) indicating that neither group had achieved steady
state during the NICU hospitalization.

 (likely due to reduced sample size) higher percentile ranking for weight at 36 weeks CGA (28th
vs. 18th percentile respectively, p = 0.14), again without a statistical difference. There were no
significant differences in adverse outcomes between the two groups for hyperbilirubenimia
requiring phototherapy (15 in each dose group p = 1), need for chronic diuretics (2 in each
dose group, p = 1), or chronic lung disease (400 IU group 6, 800 IU 3, p = 0.43).
Calcium metabolism and DEXA scan
There was no difference in serum calcium levels or hypercalcemia at any point between the
two groups (Fig 2). While there was no difference in bone mineral density (BMD) between the
two groups, a higher proportion of infants in the 400 IU group had global DEXA bone mineral
content (BMC) measurements <10 percentile (56% vs 16% p = 0.04) [34]. DEXA Fat and Fat
Free Mass was not different between the two groups (p = 0.44) Mean corrected gestational age
at DEXA was 39.5 weeks and was not different between the two groups.
Dietary vitamin D intake
Vitamin D intake from diet was calculated for subjects by week of study. There were statisti-
cally but not clinically significant differences in the intake of vitamin D from diet favoring the
400 IU group during the 1st and 7th weeks of the study (Table 4). No significant trends were
associated with season of birth or with PTH level (measured at 4 and 8 weeks) at any study
time point.

 Results for infants <1200 grams at birth
As some of the smallest and youngest patients to be enrolled in a vitamin D trial, infants in the
study <1200 grams at birth were evaluated for 25(OH)D3 status and response to supplementa-
tion regardless of supplementation group, and compared to the larger infants in the study.
These results are shown in Table 5.
Discussion
Our study demonstrated a significant improvement in 25(OH)D3 status of premature infants
with vitamin D3 supplementation, with a higher proportion of infants in the 800 IU group
achieving desired serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations above 75 nmol/l at 4 weeks. Our group of
preterm infants at birth had suboptimal vitamin D status with the median of both groups dem-
onstrating levels below 75 nmol/l. Preterm infants fed breast milk or formula without supple-
mentation have been shown in previous studies to have decreasing levels over the subsequent

 weeks (28%) or to maintain their 25(OH)D status at suboptimal levels [32]. We showed signifi-
cant improvements in vitamin D status between the groups supplemented with 400 IU and
800 IU at four weeks of age. As the number of participants in each group decreased over time,
we believe this warrants further investigation. After eight weeks of supplementation, the group
of infants supplemented with 400 IU of vitamin D3 had 27% of infants with levels of 25(OH)
D3 less than <75 nmol/l as compared to only 11% of infants with 25(OH)D <75 nmol/l in the
group supplemented with 800 IU D3. (p = 0.59) Natarajan et al reported improvement in 25
(OH)D levels in preterm infants 28–34 weeks when using a target of >50 nmol/l in a group
supplemented with 800 IU as compared to 400 IU. 67% of this cohort supplemented with 400
IU daily had levels <50 nmol/l at the completion of the study period [35]. A notable difference
between this study and ours is that in Natarajan’s intervention the dose of vitamin D supple-
mentation was reduced to account for dietary intake of vitamin D and the total intake of vita-
min D was 400 IU or 800 IU. In our study supplementation of vitamin D was in addition to
dietary vitamin D leading to greater total daily intake. In our study, several infants in the 400
IU group had levels lower than cord levels at both 4 and 8 weeks, but no infants in the 800 IU
group had a decrease in 25(OH)D levels, evidence that 400 IU of supplementation in this high-
risk group may not be adequate.
The AAP and the IOM support maintaining 25(OH)D levels >50 nmol/l in order to pro-
mote optimal bone health [5,6,8]. While both study populations did achieve this lower median
target with supplementation at either 400 or 800 IU of vitamin D3 by the fourth week of study
intervention, a number of individual subjects in both groups did not achieve this target by four
weeks (n = 4) of study intervention. This highlights our concern that while the described inter-
vention at either dose is successful for achieving mean targets >75 nmol/l in both groups in
composite, individual subjects remain at risk for bone hypo-mineralization (rickets or bone
disease of prematurity) despite standard (400 IU) or higher dose (800 IU) intervention.
Bone health has long been the primary association with vitamin D in infants and children.
Initial studies of and recommendations for vitamin D intake were designed to prevent rickets
in term infants targeting a serum 25(OH)D level of >50 nmol/l [36,37]. The preterm popula-
tion of patients is at high risk for bone disease of prematurity, and improving delivery of vita-
min D may have a positive impact on bone health. Improving vitamin D alone is not adequate
to prevent poor bone mineralization; this physiology is also dependent on delivery of appropri-
ate amounts and ratios of calcium and phosphorus in the parenteral and enteral diet, as well as
a patient’s over all nutrition status [21]. Elevation of alkaline phosphatase has historically been
associated with bone disease of prematurity however in our practice we have found that this
marker normalizes in VLBW populations given improved calcium and phosphorus from birth
and therefore lacks sensitivity to more subtle variations in bone health status in this patient
population. No significant difference was appreciated in PTH at either 4 or 8 weeks between
the two dosing groups. This may be due to lack of maturity of the PTH axis in infants of this
gestational age or reflective of the overall 25(OH)D status of each group with small numbers
not being powered to reach significance.
Evaluation of bone density by DEXA scan is one of several methods available to evaluate
bone health in premature infants. Rigo et al have described detailed bone density curves with
DEXA for preterm infants allowing for standardization of evaluation in this population [34].
In other measures of preterm infant growth, measurements below the 10th percentile indicate
intra- or extra-uterine growth failure [38,39]. Using this 10th percentile standard, a signifi-
cantly higher proportion of infants in the 400 IU vitamin D group were at risk for low bone
density than their peers in the 800 IU dosing group (56% vs 16% p = 0.04 n = 16). Other meth-
ods of evaluating bone health include ultrasound and chemical markers in serum and urine
such as alkaline phosphatase or osteocalcin and deoxypyridinoline, which were outside the

 scope of this study [40,41]. Of note, there is no gold standard of evaluation in this challenging
population [40,42].
No patients developed hypervitaminosis D as defined by tetany, hypercalcemia, or clinical
intolerance of study drug on either dose, even with the wide variation in response to supple-
mentation in the two populations with a maximum increase in 25(OH)D level of 252.7 nmol/l
in the 800 IU D3 group [38], and a minimum change in 25(OH)D level of -2.87 nmol/l in the
400 IU group. It is likely that for a proportion of high-risk preterm infants a dose of 400 IU is
adequate for normal cellular and tissue function, however there is a significant proportion of
the population which does not adequately respond to this dose and in which a higher dose
such as 800 IU or 1200 IU may be advantageous. As reported by Gallo et al, a population of
healthy breastfed infants required up to 1600 IU daily to achieve increased plasma 25(OH)D
concentrations of >75 nmol/L [43]. No studies using doses from 400–1600 IU daily in this
patient population have reported undesired side effects [29,35,43–45].
The smallest infants in our study had responses to vitamin D3 supplementation similar to
their larger peers despite dosing in total IU per day instead of a weight based dosing. This
response without evidence of overdose at either dosing level in the smallest infants helps to
support the safety and efficacy of these recommended doses for infants less than 1200 grams, a
question that has been raised by others [6].
After 8 weeks of supplementation of preterm infants with 800 IU, 11% of infants have 25
(OH)D levels below 75 nmol/l, the level that many including the Endocrine Society consider
optimal for both skeletal and extra-skeletal effects [9,46]. This, coupled with the lack of danger-
ously high levels or clinical side effects reported with dosing between 400–1600 IU in preterm
infants, lead us to argue for consideration of and additional evaluation of the 800 IU dose of
vitamin D in addition to vitamin D from diet sources in this high-risk hospitalized patient
population. Reports of clinical effects from vitamin D overdose in infants and children are
quite rare. In a case series of 7 children aged 0.7–4.2 years, Kara et al report intake between
66,000 and 800,000 IU daily for periods of up to two months in an erroneously produced fish
oil product containing 800,000 IU of vitamin D/dose. Serum 25(OH)D mean levels were
1547.5 nmol/l and patients presented with hypercalcemia, vomiting, anorexia, fever, weakness
and constipation. All patients were hospitalized for IV therapy but no lasting complications
were documented [47]. Jones has outlined a mechanism by which this toxicity may present
arguing that 25(OH)D3 at these concentrations displaces 1-alpha,25(OH)2D from vitamin D
binding protein leading to increased gene transcription [48]. Given serum response to such
high doses over a 2-month period, it is unlikely that response would be toxic or lead to hyper-
vitaminosis D when dosing at 800 IU/day throughout the course of NICU hospitalization.
One group of neonates would be at risk from such dosing recommendations that is infants
with Williams syndrome, formerly known as idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy, a genetic
syndrome associated with a deletion of 27 genes on chromosome 7 [49]. These patients are
often dysmorphic with a wide and slack mouth, underdeveloped mandible, elfin facies, supra-
valvular aortic stenosis, low set ears, craniostenosis, and increased bone density [50]. Patients
will have hypercalcemia and some will show abnormal accumulation of 25(OH)D, however
most will have normal 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels while hypercalcemic or normocalce-
mic [50]. Supplementation of these patients with vitamin D would not be advisable. Hospital-
ized preterm infants will have early and often frequent evaluation of calcium levels in the
course of their normal care, so inadvertent hypercalcemia is unlikely to go undiagnosed in a
<32-week preterm patient population.
Trends toward improved growth in both length and weight are also important outcomes
that require additional exploration. Growth in the NICU period has a direct correlation to
neurodevelopmental outcomes, and is critical to an infant’s long-term success [51]. Additional

 research is necessary, particularly for smaller and more preterm infants who are at high risk
for development of bone demineralization, rickets of prematurity, extrauterine growth failure,
and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, all of which have the potential to be positively impacted by
improved 25(OH)D levels.
This study is the only study to date to evaluate infants as small as 24 weeks EGA; others
have reported data on infants 28 weeks and greater. These infants are the highest risk infants
and are in need of additional evaluation of vitamin D status and response to supplementation.
Our DEXA scan evaluation of these infants at term corrected age is an important indicator of
both short term and long-term benefits of improvement in vitamin D status. Our study, how-
ever; does have limitations. We were only able to evaluate 32 infants, which limits the statistical
significance of some of our outcomes. Additionally, a number of infants (16) did not complete
the outpatient DEXA scan despite multiple attempts to schedule and reschedule the scan and
to accommodate any special travel or transportation needs of the family. We were unable to
adequately assess maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy in the cohort studied, as mater-
nal records often did not report the amount of vitamin D in the prescribed prenatal vitamin.
However, given that the majority of prenatal vitamins have 400 IU of vitamin D and this has
not been shown to increase levels in pregnancy this likely does not have any impact on our
described results.
Conclusions
Administration of 400 or 800 IU of vitamin D3 improves vitamin D status at 4 weeks as com-
pared to cord levers in high risk infants <32 weeks EGA at delivery. Dosing vitamin D3 daily
at 800 IU in this population significantly improves 4 week 25(OH)D3 status as compared to a
400 IU daily dose. Additionally, risk of bone density less than the 10th percentile as measured
by DEXA at term corrected age is decreased with a dose of 800 IU daily while in the NICU.
Although this study was underpowered to show a statistical difference between the two dosing
levels at all points of evaluation, not all infants achieved levels of 75 nmol/L at 4 or 8-week
measurements, and a number of infants have levels <50 nmol/l at 4 weeks. There was also a
trend towards improvement in linear growth in the infants dosed at 800IU of vitamin D3 daily
as compared to the lower dose. Our results support a daily supplementation dose of 800 IU as
compared to 400 IU in this at risk extremely preterm patient population. Evidence continues
to mount in support of this supplementation of preterm infants with vitamin D early in hospi-
talization [44]. Vitamin D toxicity is a rare event, and tolerance of even higher doses of vitamin
D have been reported in a variety of populations [9,52]. Alternatively, the risks of recommen-
dation of too low a dose may have significant impact on individual and population health with
disease outcomes associated with low vitamin D status, including hypocalcemic seizures,
growth restriction, fractures, and elevation of serum parathyroid hormone [53–55]. In fact,
some authors, including Heaney, have argued that a physiological reference for optimal vita-
min D status would be between 100 and 130 nmol/L stating that based on physiological out-
comes such as normalization of PTH and adequate vitamin D supply in breast milk this level is
safe for disease prevention without association of toxicity [56]. Other authors have recom-
mended loading doses to more quickly improve vitamin D status in at risk populations, a strat-
egy that merits further investigation [57].
Our results agree with previous evidence that supports an association between vitamin D
status, gestational age, and growth in premature infants. The optimal dose of vitamin D sup-
plementation for preterm infants during the early neonatal period warrants further investiga-
tion, but it is reasonable and safe to recommend daily supplementation in addition to dietary
intake with 800 IU of vitamin D to high-risk preterm infants while hospitalized in the NICU in

 order to target a level of 25(OH)D that is >75 nmol/l, as we have shown this to improve bone
health defined by DEXA in this at-risk population.
