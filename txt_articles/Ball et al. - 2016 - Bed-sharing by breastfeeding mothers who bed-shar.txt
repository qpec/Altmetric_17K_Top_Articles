ABSTRACT
Aim: To explore the link between breastfeeding duration and bed-sharing frequency
among women reporting a prenatal intention to breastfeed.
Methods: About 870 participants in a randomised breastfeeding trial, recruited at mid-
pregnancy, provided weekly snapshots of breastfeeding and bed-sharing behaviour for
26 weeks following birth. Strength of prenatal breastfeeding intent was recorded at
recruitment using Likert-type scales.
Results: Outcomes were frequency of bed-sharing at home for at least one hour per week,
and time to cessation of breastfeeding. There were insufficient data to classify bed-sharing
pattern in 192/870 (22%) of mothers. Of the remainder, 44% (299/678) of participants
‘rarely’ or ‘never’ bed-shared, 28% (192/678) did so ‘intermittently’ and 28% (187/678)
did so ‘often’. These three groups did not differ significantly in marital status, income, infant
gestational age, maternal age or delivery mode. Significantly, more participants who bed-
shared ‘often’ reported strong prenatal breastfeeding intent (70% vs. 57% and 56% for
‘intermittent’ and ‘rare’ bed-share groups) and attached high prenatal importance to
breastfeeding (95% vs. 87% and 82%). Significantly, more women who bed-shared
frequently were breastfeeding at 6 months (p < 0.0001) than those who intermittently or
rarely/never bed-shared.
Conclusion: Women with strong motivation to breastfeed frequently bed-share. Given the
complex relationship between bed-sharing and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
appropriate guidance balancing risk minimisation with support for breastfeeding mothers
is crucial.
Breastfeeding is important for immediate infant and mater-
nal well-being and for lifetime health. It is well documented
that the use of breastmilk substitutes is associated with
poorer outcomes for both infants and mothers (1,2).
Breastfeeding is therefore widely recommended by interna-
tional health agencies (e.g. 3), with the World Health
Organization recommending exclusive breastfeeding for the
first 6 months of life, continued thereafter for at least
2 years with the addition of appropriate complementary
foods (4). Numerous studies have examined the factors
influencing initiation and continuation of breastfeeding
(e.g. 5–7) and how to use this knowledge to best support
mothers in achieving their breastfeeding goals (e.g. 8).
Infant sleep location is one factor affecting breastfeeding
in western societies that is still poorly understood. The

Key notes
�
Infant sleep location is associated with breastfeeding
duration; mothers who bed-share consistently breast-
feed for longer than mothers who do not bed-share.
�
Frequent bed-sharers differed from intermittent and
rare/never bed-sharers only in the strength of their
prenatal breastfeeding intent, the importance they
attached to breastfeeding and subsequent duration of
any and exclusive breastfeeding.
�
Singular messages to avoid bed-sharing are unhelpful;
risk minimisation approaches are needed for these
mothers.

 parents to avoid bed-sharing (e.g. 11,12), means this is a
topic where further research is vital. To date, the relation-
ship between breastfeeding and mother–infant bed-sharing
has been explored in several ways: the direct effect of bed-
sharing on breastfeeding behaviour and physiology has
been examined in laboratory, hospital and domestic settings
(e.g. 13–15); the correlation between bed-sharing practice
and breastfeeding outcomes has been statistically demon-
strated in large epidemiological studies (16–19); and the
importance of the experiential relationship between bed-
sharing and breastfeeding has been described by mothers in
qualitative studies (9,10,20).
The evidence that parent–infant sleep sharing is associ-
ated
with
sudden
and
unexpected
deaths
in infancy
(SUDI) in certain hazardous contexts is strong. These
deaths may be designated as accidental (e.g. wedging,
overlaying, suffocation) or unexplained, with the latter
fulfilling the designation for SIDS (sudden infant death
syndrome) as ‘the sudden unexpected death of an infant
<1 year of age, with onset of the fatal episode apparently
occurring during sleep, that remains unexplained after a
thorough investigation’ (21). Multiple studies have found
an association between SIDS and infants sleeping with
adults on surfaces other than a bed, bed-sharing with
parents who smoke or who have taken drugs, medications
or
alcohol,
and
bed-sharing
with
a
preterm
or
low
birthweight infant (22). In the absence of these hazards,
however, the most recent evidence reveals no increased
risk, at least in the UK (23).
Parent–infant bed-sharing is neither uniformly risky nor
safe for infants; it is therefore important to anticipate which
mothers are most likely to bed-share, to understand how
risk might vary for each group and to tailor appropriate
guidance that balances risk minimisation with support for
breastfeeding mothers. More than a decade ago, Blair &
Ball (24) reported that 50% of English parents, the majority
of them breastfeeding mothers, found themselves bed-
sharing with their baby regardless of their prenatal beliefs
that they would not do so (25). At that time, breastfeeding
initiation rates in England and Wales were comparatively
low (68%); recent increases in breastfeeding initiation in
England (to 83%) means that even more babies will
experience bed-sharing. This study therefore examines
enrolment and follow-up data from a previously published
large randomised trial of breastfeeding and infant sleep
location in a UK hospital postnatal ward to consider the
sleep arrangements of breastfeeding mothers and infants, to
identify which breastfeeding mothers bed-share and to
explore how bed-sharing relates to breastfeeding outcomes.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
We used data from 870 mothers who participated in a
randomised controlled trial between 2008 and 2010 that
was designed to detect whether different bassinette types
used in the postnatal ward of a large tertiary hospital in
north-east England affected breastfeeding duration. We
previously reported that the trial intervention (provision of
a sidecar bassinette on the postnatal ward as opposed to
the usual free-standing bassinette) was not associated with
a significant difference in breastfeeding duration or fre-
quency of bed-sharing once at home (26). As no differ-
ences in behaviour were detected between the two trial
arms, we were able to combine the follow-up data from all
trial participants to examine breastfeeding and at-home
bed-sharing in this sample. The study design and primary
outcomes have been described in detail elsewhere (26), but
briefly, the participants were recruited at their 20-week
gestation antenatal scan if they met the following criteria:
fluent enough English to understand the nature of the trial;
pregnant with a normal single infant; and open to the
possibility
of
breastfeeding.
The
latter
criterion
was
assessed using a Likert-type scale in which potential
recruits were asked to rate their intention to breastfeed.
Those who indicated that they had ‘no intention to
breastfeed’ were not recruited; all others were provided
with information and asked to consider participation.
Women were also asked for baseline demographic infor-
mation, including whether they had previously breastfed, at
the time of enrolment.
Women who miscarried, delivered at <37 weeks of
gestation or had infants that were transferred to the
Neonatal Unit were excluded from the trial. Following
discharge, feeding and sleeping practices were reported
weekly for 26 weeks using an automated telephone system
with
reminder
postcards
sent
via
mail.
Participants
responded to questions using their telephone keypad,
and responses were captured via an interactive database
(described in 27). If participants failed to respond, they
were contacted by telephone, letter or email to obtain
follow-up data.
Breastfeeding variables
Prenatal feeding intentions were assessed by asking women
to indicate the strength of their breastfeeding intent, and
how important they considered breastfeeding to be, on
Likert-type scales during enrolment (Fig. 1). Note that
categories one and two for the importance of breastfeeding
scale have been combined, as very few women chose either
category: this is labelled as ‘Unimportant’ in the results
below. Breastfeeding outcome variables were based on
weekly responses to the automated telephone system.
Participants were asked:
In the last week, has your baby been:
1 breastfed or received expressed breast milk (Yes/No);
2 formula fed (Yes/No);
3 fed other liquids not including medicines or water
(Yes/No);
4 fed solid foods (Yes/No).
The outcome measures analysed here are (i) time to
cessation of any breastfeeding (baby no longer receiving
human milk) and (ii) time to cessation of exclusive
breastfeeding
(baby
receiving
breastmilk
plus
other
substances).

Bed-sharing and breastfeeding outcomes
 Bed-sharing
Participants responded to three questions about sleep on a
weekly basis:
1 in the last week, did your baby sleep in your bed while
you were asleep (Yes/No);
2 if so, was this for at least an hour (Yes/No);
3 if so, did this occur on more than one night in that
week (Yes/No).
Responses to the latter question were discarded due to
missing data (>50%). We therefore focused on whether the
mother–infant dyad bed-shared for at least an hour each
week.
The above definition allowed us to separate mothers and
babies who slept together for extended periods from those
cases where babies fell asleep in their mother’s arms, or
while feeding and were returned to their own sleeping space
within a short period of time. The latter were not cate-
gorised here as ‘bed-sharers’. The choice of 1 hour as the
cut-off was arbitrary, representing a standard unit of time
that participants were familiar with and which has been
used in other studies.
Characterising bed-sharing and bed-sharers
For each participant, bed-sharing behaviour was cate-
gorised in 4-week blocks, beginning from the infant’s birth
week; data from weeks 25 and 26 were omitted so that
intervals were uniform in length. Each 4-week period was
characterised by the majority behaviour, as long as data for
no more than 1 week was missing. In each block, a dyad
was designated as ‘no bed-share-0’ if the mother did not
report sleeping with her baby for at least an hour in at least
one of the 4 weeks in the block, ‘occasional bed-share-1’ if
she reported sleeping with her baby for at least an hour
in 1 week only, ‘moderate bed-share-2’ if she reported
sleeping with her baby for at least an hour a week in any
2 weeks in a block and ‘frequent bed-share -3’ if a dyad
slept together for at least an hour in three or four of the
4 weeks in a block, or ‘Missing data-9’. These were coded
and the codes used to create an ordered sequence repre-
senting each dyad across the six 4-week blocks. For
illustration, the sequence 011399 denotes a dyad with no
bed-sharing in weeks 1–4, occasional bed-sharing in weeks
5–12, frequent bed-sharing in weeks 13–16 and missing data
for weeks 17–24. These sequences were used to identify
subgroups of dyads with similar bed-sharing patterns across
the 24-week period based on the consistency of their bed-
sharing behaviour.
Visual inspection was used to sort the coded sequences
into groups, and the grouping criteria were documented.
Cluster analysis was also performed, but failed to improve
on the groups created by systematic coding and visual
inspection. Four groups of sequences emerged: dyads
that bed-shared (i) never or occasionally, (ii) intermittently,
(iii) often and (iv) those that provided insufficient data
(Table 1). Responders (groups a–c) were compared with
nonresponders (group d) to ascertain whether there were
any differences in demographic factors (Table 3).
The socio-economic and birth circumstances of mothers
were summarised in the form of percentages for categorical
variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous
variables: this was done for the whole cohort, and by bed-
share group. Chi-squared and analysis of variance tests were
used to detect whether there were any statistically signifi-
cant differences between these groups in the distribution of
explanatory variables: the comparisons were between the
three subgroups with near-complete bed-sharing data, and
then between these groups combined and those for whom
bed-sharing data were often missing to assess the general-
isability of the available results.

Bed-sharing and breastfeeding outcomes
Ball et al.
 The distribution of the length of ‘any’ and ‘exclusive’
breastfeeding was compared between bed-sharing sub-
groups. Breastfeeding data were censored at 26 weeks or
time of drop-out from the study (defined as failure to
provide data for at least 4 successive weeks). The Kaplan–
Meier survivor functions for any and exclusive breastfeed-
ing were generated for each bed-sharing group, illustrated
by a graph, and summarised by the median time to stopping
breastfeeding. The log-rank test was used to test for a
difference in breastfeeding duration across bed-sharing
groups.
RESULTS
Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of the 870 trial
participants contributing data on breastfeeding and bed-
sharing for these analyses: the socio-economic make-up is
typical
of
women
considering
breastfeeding,
tending
towards older age, more education and higher income.
Trial participants providing no data tended to be slightly
younger, less likely to be White and had a lower household
income (26).
Bed-sharing behaviour
There was insufficient data to classify bed-sharing pattern
for 192/870 (22%) of mothers. Of the remainder, 44%
(299/678) of participants ‘rarely’ or ‘never’ bed-shared,
28% (192/678) were in an ‘intermediate’ group who did
so intermittently and 28% (187/678) did so ‘often’ (for at
least an hour). When we applied less stringent bed-
sharing criteria (bed-sharing of any duration), very few
mothers reported never sleeping with their baby at all
(15/870, 2%).
Breastfeeding outcomes and infant sleep location
Figure 2a shows the duration of any breastfeeding in the
three bed-sharing subgroups. A greater proportion of
women continued breastfeeding for longer in those sub-
groups where bed-sharing was more common: this differ-
ence is statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The median
time to cessation of any breastfeeding was 14 weeks for
those who rarely bed-shared, 24 weeks for intermediate
bed-sharers and over 26 weeks for those who bed-shared
often.
Figure 2b shows the duration of exclusive breastfeeding
by bed-sharing subgroup. Only 66% overall initiated exclu-
sive breastfeeding and this dropped sharply over the first
few weeks after birth. A greater proportion of women
continued exclusive breastfeeding for longer in those
subgroups where bed-sharing was more common: this
difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The
median time to cessation of exclusive breastfeeding was
3 weeks for those who rarely bed-shared, 5 weeks for
intermediate bed-sharers and 10 weeks for those who bed-
shared often.
Characteristics associated with bed-sharing patterns
The participant characteristics for each bed-share group are
shown in Table 3. The results of the significance tests
comparing the three bed-sharing groups with near-com-
plete data (rarely/intermediate/often) are given in the
p-value* column. There were no significant differences
across these three bed-share groups in terms of marital
status, household income, infant gestational age, maternal
age or delivery mode. However, significantly, more mothers
who bed-shared often reported prenatally that they deemed
it important to breastfeed their child (70% compared to
57% and 56%, respectively, for those who bed-shared
intermittently,
or
rarely/never).
Furthermore,
women
expressing strong prenatal intent to breastfeed bed-shared
most frequently (i.e. 95% of ‘often’ bed-sharers, 87% of

Bed-sharing and breastfeeding outcomes
 ‘intermittent’ vs. 82% of ‘rarely’ bed-share groups, respec-
tively, reported they ‘would like to’ or ‘will definitely’
breastfeed). This patterning did not simply reflect prior
breastfeeding experience; previous breastfeeders comprised
52% of frequent, 48% of intermittent and 40% of rare or
never bed-sharers. In addition, there were differences in
educational background and ethnicity. A greater proportion
of mothers who bed-shared frequently (62%) and intermit-
tently (58%) had a university education compared to those
who regularly returned their infant to a crib (50%). Few
mothers in the study identified themselves as being of
non-White ethnicity (9%); however, non-White mothers
comprised
12%
of
the
group
who
bed-shared
often,
compared to 6% in those who rarely bed-shared.
The results of the significance tests comparing those who
had provided near-complete bed-sharing data (combined
across the rare/intermediate/often subgroups) to those with
insufficient bed-sharing data to characterise them (poor
response) are given in the p-value** column. When those
mothers who had provided bed-sharing data were com-
pared to those whose data were incomplete, the latter were
younger, more likely to be non-White, and have lower
household income.
DISCUSSION
Only 15 of 870 women with a prenatal intention to
breastfeed reported that they never slept with their baby
during the first 24 weeks of life. Women who bed-shared
frequently were significantly more likely to continue breast-
feeding to 6 months, than those who bed-shared intermit-
tently or did not bed-share, supporting the results of a
recent U.S. study (18). However, in the present study, a
significantly greater proportion of frequent bed-sharers also
continued exclusive breastfeeding for longer, contrary to
the U.S. findings, although exclusive breastfeeding was not
very common.
The women participating in this UK study were recruited
during mid-pregnancy and intended to breastfeed. The
majority considered breastfeeding to be very or extremely
important, and the vast majority were highly motivated to
breastfeed their child. Those with a strong prenatal inten-
tion to breastfeed, previous breastfeeding experience and
higher educational achievement are known to continue
breastfeeding for longer than other groups (17). We found
that those who bed-shared more often were more commit-
ted to their breastfeeding intent, more likely to be university
educated and less likely to be White.
Given the relationship observed here between bed-
sharing behaviour and prenatal intent to breastfeed, it
seems likely that women who are motivated to achieve their
breastfeeding
goals
incorporate
bed-sharing
into
their
night-time
feeding
strategy,
a
behavioural
complex
McKenna & Gettler (28) have recently termed ‘breast-
sleeping’. Prior studies indicate that parents learn by
experience that bed-sharing facilitates breastfeeding (25);
one recent study found that mothers now create and share
narratives that emphasise the importance of bed-sharing for
coping with night-time breastfeeding (20).
From the previous analysis of data from this study (17),
we found that non-White ethnicity was associated with a
significantly longer duration of breastfeeding, but not with
exclusive breastfeeding. We have now shown a significant
association between ethnicity and bed-sharing activity. The
lack of consistency in association with both types of
breastfeeding could be a consequence of the small sample
of women in this study identifying as part of an ethnic
minority, but given similar results in another recent UK
study (29), it is more likely that this outcome reflects
different cultural ideas regarding the introduction of com-
plementary foods (30).
Given the complex relationship between bed-sharing and
SIDS, it is important that those parents most likely to bed-
share understand the risk of SIDS given their own familial
context. By engaging nulliparous women during pregnancy
in conversations about the strength of their intentions to
breastfeed, the importance they attach to breastfeeding, and
their educational background, those most likely to incor-
porate bed-sharing into night-time infant care can be

 identified, which would enable risk minimisation informa-
tion to be personalised to their circumstances. This is
important as parents with no prior experience of night-time
parenting need information about the risks associated with
unintentional bed-sharing and how to minimise the poten-
tial risks that may arise with planned bed-sharing. This is a
preferable strategy to attempting to eliminate bed-sharing in
this group which (i) is unlikely to be successful and (ii) may
cause unintended harm by undermining breastfeeding
duration.
There are limitations to this study. The problem of
missing data limited the detail of the analysis that we hoped
to achieve. Due to this missing data, younger mothers and
mothers
from lower
income households
were under-
represented in the sample. Ethnic minorities also made up
a small fraction of the sample due to the limited ethnic
variability in the locality of the study; it would be valuable
to repeat the study in a different area to evaluate the
reproducibility of the results. The data set was generated as
part of a study recruiting women with a prenatal intent to
breastfeed, so these results cannot be generalised to women
making alternate feeding choices for their child.
This study has unpicked some relevant details underlying
the well-known association between breastfeeding and bed-
sharing, demonstrating that women who are strongly
motivated to breastfeed are those who most frequently
bed-share. This suggests that commitment to breastfeeding
engenders bed-sharing for many women, and an explana-
tion for why women who bed-share breastfeed for longer
than women who do not bed-share is that they begin with a
stronger commitment to breastfeed. As the vast majority of
participants in this study slept for some period with their
babies, this indicates that all breastfeeding mothers need
information on doing so as safely as possible.
The results of this study do not support previous argu-
ments that bed-sharing protects against early weaning. They
do, however, raise the question of whether recommenda-
tions to avoid bed-sharing impede some women from the
achievement of their breastfeeding goals, and thereby cause
unintended harm to infant and maternal well-being, and
even to lifetime health.
