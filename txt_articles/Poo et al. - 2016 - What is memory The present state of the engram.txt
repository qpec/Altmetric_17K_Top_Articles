Abstract
The mechanism of memory remains one of the great
unsolved problems of biology. Grappling with the
question more than a hundred years ago, the German
zoologist Richard Semon formulated the concept of
the engram, lasting connections in the brain that
result from simultaneous “excitations”, whose precise
physical nature and consequences were out of reach
of the biology of his day. Neuroscientists now have
the knowledge and tools to tackle this question,
however, and this Forum brings together leading
contemporary views on the mechanisms of memory
and what the engram means today.
The cellular basis of memory
Mu-ming Poo
Neurobiological studies of memory over the past century
have progressed along two relatively independent lines of
inquiry: the top-down approach examines the animal’s be-
haviors associated with memory acquisition, consolidation,
and retrieval, as well as the brain regions underlying these
processes, whereas the bottom-up approach explores the
cellular and circuit mechanisms of memory encoding and
storage by examining the patterns of neuronal firing and the
efficacy of synaptic transmission. In his monumental treatise
[1] The Organization of Behavior (1949), Donald Hebb
made a bold attempt to link these two lines of inquiry by
postulating that perceptual memory resides in specific “cell
assemblies” formed by the strengthening of interneuronal

connections due to correlated activities during memory ac-
quisition. The discovery of activity-induced long-term po-
tentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of central
synapses in the 1970s and 80s further sparked the interest of
a whole generation of neurobiologists in studying synaptic
plasticity and its relationship to memory. There is now gen-
eral consensus that persistent modification of the synaptic
strength via LTP and LTD of pre-existing connections
represents a primary mechanism for the formation of mem-
ory engrams. In addition, LTP and LTD could also lead to
the formation of new and elimination of old synapses and
thus changes in structural connectivity in the brain. Indeed,
early development of neural circuits, whereby neural activity
sculpts synaptic connectivity [2], depends on processes simi-
lar to that associated with LTP and LTD in the adult brain
and could be considered as the imprinting of memory en-
grams generated by early experience.
In this Forum, a group of experts on the cellular mecha-
nisms of memory were invited to present their views on
“what is memory”, including where and how memory en-
grams are stored, consolidated, and retrieved. Drawing on
an elegant set of studies, Michele Pignatelli, Tomás Ryan,
and Susumu Tonegawa illustrate how recently developed
techniques to tag and manipulate neurons have begun to
establish a causal link between neuronal activity, persistent
synaptic changes, and an animal’s memory-associated be-
haviors. The theme of persistent synaptic changes and their
causal role in memory is taken up by Tobias Bonhoeffer,
who summarizes the evidence that dendritic spines, where
excitatory synapses are located, represent the basic cellular
unit for memory; long-term memory is stored in a set of
spines that are formed or modified during learning and
these changes may persist throughout the animal’s life.
Based on the findings of activity-induced transcrip-
tional activation and synapse-specific local translation of
proteins, Kelsey Martin expands on the idea that the
basic building block of memory is the synapse, where

 both pre- and postsynaptic elements together with
associated glial processes form an integral unit with an
individual identity and distinct “neighborhood”. Andrii
Rudenko and Li-Huei Tsai redirect attention to the nu-
clei of engram cells, discussing the evidence that epigen-
etic alterations of the neurons activated during memory
acquisition may be involved in the long-term retention
of memory. They propose that such epigenetic modifica-
tion represents a priming event during the initial phase
of memory formation; memory retrieval would then
trigger the expression of the primed genes, leading to
protein synthesis and synaptic modification at individual
synaptic units.
Depending on the availability of cellular resources,
immediate modifications (LTP and LTD) and long-term
turnover (formation and elimination) of individual syn-
aptic units are bound to influence other units on the
same postsynaptic cell. Richard Tsien, Gord Fishell, and
Caitlin Mullins focus on the important issue of lateral
synaptic
interaction
and
redistribution
of
synaptic
strength associated with LTP and LTD, from the point of
view of cellular homeostasis as well as the normalization
and signal-to-noise ratio of neuronal activities, and
propose a conceptual scheme to address the underlying
mechanisms.
The hippocampus is unique in being a key brain re-
gion for memory formation and a region in which adult
neurogenesis
occurs.
Associated
with
hippocampus-
dependent spatial memory, Tiago Gonçalves, Matthew
Shtrahman, Stephen Johnston, and Fred Gage discuss an
intriguing new dimension in the cellular mechanisms of
memory formation, whereby continuous addition of
newborn dentate gyrus neurons in the adult hippo-
campus, with their enhanced synaptic plasticity, may
contribute significantly to establishing the engram for
spatial memory.
As
proposed
by
David
Marr
in
his
model
of
hippocampus-dependent memory [3] and supported by
many experimental and clinical studies, episodic memor-
ies are transferred after acquisition from the hippocampus
to the neocortex for long-term storage. The mechanisms
underlying the transfer and consolidation of spatial mem-
ory are discussed by John Long and György Buzsaki in the
context of hippocampal and entorhinal sharp wave-
ripples. These activity patterns occur during sleep or non-
attentive brain states and are replays of neuronal firing
sequences triggered by recent experience, for example
they can be temporally compressed replayed versions of
the sequential neuronal firing seen as the animal traverses
through a particular environment. As discussed by myself
and Yang Dan, although spike timing-dependent plasticity
could offer a synaptic mechanism for storing sequence
information with intervals up to a few hundreds of
milliseconds, it remains largely unknown how neural
circuits store and recall the temporal sequence of informa-
tion up to seconds and longer, periods often associated
with episodic memory. A compression of the temporal
sequence of events such as occurs during sharp wave-
ripples in the hippocampus and neocortex offers a
potential solution.
The contributing articles of this Forum reflect the
tremendous progress made in our understanding of the
cellular building blocks of memory. There is a clear con-
sensus on where the memory engram is stored—specific
assemblies of synapses activated or formed during mem-
ory acquisition—and a substantial body of knowledge on
how the engram is generated and maintained in the
brain. However, knowing the building blocks and their
properties is far from understanding the architecture of
the “memory palace”. As Charles Stevens indicates in his
epilogue, and the readers will soon discover, many new
territories are now open for exploration.
Engram cell connectivity as a substrate for
memory storage
Michele Pignatelli, Tomás J. Ryan, and Susumu Tonegawa
The storage of information refers to the systematic
process of collecting and cataloging data so that they
can be retrieved on request.
One of the most enlightening conceptualizations of
the neural representation of stored memory information
was developed by Richard Semon, who conceived the
Engram Theory, a theory of memory traces [4]. Accord-
ing to this theory, as fortified by contemporary know-
ledge, learning activates a small ensemble of brain cells,
inducing
in
these
cells
persistent
physical/chemical
changes. In addition, reactivation of these cells by
relevant recall cues results in retrieval of the specific
memory. The theory poses an important question: what
is the nature of the persistent changes?
In his seminal book published in 1949, Donald Hebb
proposed a mechanism based on synaptic plasticity as a
substrate of memory [1]. With an example of two cells
connected by an excitatory synapse, if the activation of
one cell leads to the activation of the second one, the
connection between the
two cells is reinforced, a
postulate that has been confirmed experimentally [5–8].
The increase in connectivity strength within a diffuse
group of cells in a more complex feedforward circuit re-
sults in the emergence of an engram cell ensemble.
The systematic dissection of the molecular mecha-
nisms involved in synaptic plasticity has revealed that
the cascade of events underlying the plastic changes
requires two distinct phases [9, 10]. In the encoding
phase, also known as early long-term potentiation
(E-LTP), an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
mediated by post-synaptic NMDA receptors elicits a
change in synaptic weight by increasing the insertion and

 the conductance of AMPA receptors [11]. The dendritic
spines that support the post-synaptic machinery rapidly
increase in number [12]. In a second phase lasting a few
hours after the initial encoding period, the increased syn-
aptic weight is maintained by a protein synthesis-
dependent process known as cellular consolidation, during
which the steady state synthesis of AMPA receptors is
shifted to a higher level. This second phase is known as
late LTP (L-LTP) [9, 10] and is sensitive to protein synthe-
sis inhibitors (PSI).
To date, memory storage has mainly been investigated
by pharmacological or molecular manipulation and by
correlating synaptic changes with the strength of memory
recall. Only recently has it become possible to specifically
tag cells activated by learning. The demonstration that
these cells are part of a memory engram ensemble was
provided by a series of “optogenetic” experiments where a
learning-induced
tagging
strategy
was
employed
to
express channelrhodopsin [13] in a small population of
learning-activated cells [14, 15]. The opsin allowed for the
artificial light-induced reactivation of the cellular popula-
tion labeled during learning and resulted in memory
retrieval. The same tagging strategy also verified the
reactivation
of
tagged
cells
upon
presentation
of
retrieval cues.
Tagging “engram” cells offers a straightforward oppor-
tunity to investigate the nature of the persistent changes
that occurred in these cells in response to learning. In a
recent study [16], “engram cells” were compared to
“non engram cells” (non-tagged cells) by ex vivo patch
clamp
recordings
after
contextual
fear
conditioning
(CFC). Engram cells displayed changes in synaptic weight
typical of LTP such as high current amplitude, insertion of
AMPA
receptors,
high spontaneous
excitatory post-
synaptic current frequency and amplitude, and increased
dendritic spine density. These changes were blocked by
the systemic injection of PSI specifically within the
consolidation window. Therefore, it is now clear that cells
recruited by learning display synaptic changes typical of
LTP and are reactivated by retrieval cues, and their
reactivation can elicit memory recall. Remarkably, how-
ever, protein synthesis-dependent L-LTP seems to be dis-
pensable for memory storage because direct optogenetic
activation of the engram cells in PSI-injected mice elicited
full memory recall under a variety of conditions.
If L-LTP is dispensable for memory storage, what
mechanism is responsible?
An integral memory engram may consist of preferential
connectivity between engram cell ensembles distributed
across multiple brain regions. In the same report [16] it
was shown ex vivo that engram cells from the dentate
gyrus established preferential connections with engram
cells in the downstream hippocampal CA3 region in a
feedforward excitatory engram cell circuit. Remarkably,
this preferential connectivity was maintained in mice
rendered amnesic by treatment with PSI within the con-
solidation window, suggesting that memory storage may
survive retrograde amnesia in the form of a neural con-
nectivity pattern. Indeed, optogenetic stimulation of DG
engram cells in vivo elicited similar cellular reactivation
patterns not only in the CA3 region but also in the
amygdala for both control and amnesic groups, thus
confirming the persistence of engram cell connectivity.
These observations support the concept of preferential
connectivity of engram cell ensembles distributed across
multiple brain regions, which is established during learn-
ing and persists despite disruption of consolidation and
thereby provides a lasting substrate for memory storage.
These data also suggest that the synaptic potentiation
observed in consolidated engram cells is necessary for
memory retrievability and not for storage [17]. While
regulation of synaptic weight provides a scalar quantity
to control information retrieval, synaptic connectivity
holds the information specificity. This is because synap-
ses that are activated during the encoding stage will dic-
tate the eventual pattern of cellular connectivity of the
upstream and downstream engram cell ensembles. This
notion is compatible with the broad view that synapses
are the basic units of information storage (see Bonhoeffer,
this Forum).
How would the specific connectivity pattern between
engram cell ensembles be formed by specific learning?
Neural connections are formed during development and
certain circuits hold the innate capability to elicit complex
behavioral reactions in response to specific perceptual cues
[18]. However, this does not seem to be the case in the hip-
pocampal formation because inactivation of the down-
stream CA1 region before CFC results in anterograde
amnesia which cannot be bypassed by direct optogenetic
stimulation of DG engram cells [16]. Thus, the memory cir-
cuit is not configured under anterograde amnesic conditions
and is not, therefore, genetically determined but requires
hippocampal activity during memory encoding. As reported
by Ryan et al. [16], learning-induced changes in connectivity
patterns are insensitive to PSI. So is E-LTP [9, 10] and this
early phase of plasticity may provide a framework to in-
vestigate the formation of new connections. For instance,
blocking NMDA receptor function should impair the
emergence of learning-induced connectivity patterns.
During the induction of LTP, existing connections can
be potentiated [19] but new connections can also emerge
[20]. A hypothetical way this might happen is through the
activation of silent synaptic connections [21]. These
synapses expressing only NMDA receptors and not
AMPA receptors can become unsilenced through AMPA
receptor insertion, a mechanism that could, in principle,
Poo et al. BMC Biology  (2016) 14:40 
Page 3 of 18
 support the formation of learning-induced changes in en-
gram cell connectivity. Another possibility is that local
dendritic protein synthesis contributes to the rapid syn-
apse formation on engram cells, independently of its role
in synaptic potentiation (see Martin, this Forum).
What then maintains the learning-induced engram cell
connectivity that is initiated during encoding?
Although learning-induced synaptic potentiation would
be suppressed by PSI, the new connectivity pattern could
persist through unsilenced synaptic connections of basal
unpotentiated strength (Fig. 1). Consistent with this per-
spective, it has been recently shown that optogenetically
induced long-term depression (LTD) of amygdala cells
impaired existing conditioned fear responses but subse-
quent optogenetically induced LTP of the same cells
could restore optogenetic cue-evoked recall of the fear
memory [22].
The ability to tag cells activated by learning has
opened up new horizons in the investigation of memory

connection between engram cells occurs either by potentiation of existing connections (blue dotted circles) or by unsilencing synapses (red dotted

higher level and the disruption of consolidation with protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI) results in retrograde amnesia. However, during PSI-induced
amnesia, memory storage persists within an engram-specific set of weak synaptic connections

in the storage of information.
Spines and synapses as basic elements of memory
storage
Tobias Bonhoeffer
In his seminal work, Donald Hebb [1] proposed that the
basic mechanism by which memories are stored in the
brain is the enhancement of synaptic strength and, in
connection with that, morphological changes of the re-
spective synaptic contacts. In other words he proposed
that synapses and not cells are the basic building blocks
of memory, from a theoretical perspective a reasonable
suggestion as there are approximately 10,000–100,000
times more synapses in the brain than neurons.
By now it is well established that morphological
changes at the synaptic level occur in conjunction with
stimuli that are thought to mimic learning events. In
vitro experiments [12, 23] have shown that long-term
potentiation results in the addition of dendritic spines,
tiny protrusions which harbor synaptic contacts. Tens of
thousands of these spines decorate the dendrites of most
excitatory cells in the hippocampus and the neocortex.
And indeed, further studies showed that spines not only
come and go but also change their shape during putative
learning events [19], a suggestion that had been put for-
ward in a purely theoretical paper by Francis Crick [24].
So, it is well established that spines emerge, disappear,
and change with cellular events thought to underlie
learning processes. But is this merely a correlation or are
there ways towards showing that these events really lie
at the basis of learning and memory storage in the brain?
Recent experiments have made substantial progress in
this respect.
The first study that made a clear case that spines are
important for the long-term storage of information was
done in the visual cortex of mice [25]. In the visual cor-
tex it is well known that synaptic connections are estab-
lished or modified with changes in visual experience,
like the temporary closure of one eye. These plastic
changes are often used as a proxy for what happens dur-
ing memory formation since they share key features: it
is, for instance, a universally accepted fact in memory re-
search that information that has been acquired early in
life can be learned much more easily a second time, even
if it had been “completely forgotten” in the meantime.
This effect has been called “savings” [26] and is a hall-
mark of most memory processes. It has been shown that
the same effect occurs in the visual system [27]. Mice
were monocularly deprived for a couple of days early in
life so that the visual system adapted to this change of
the visual environment. Subsequently, animals were sub-
jected to normal vision again so that their visual cortex
reverted to normal function. If monocular deprivation
was then performed a second time, much later in life,
when normally this procedure has only a very limited
effect (if any), substantial adaptation still takes place
because of the early experience that the animal has had.
Importantly, this savings effect could be related to new
spines that emerged during the first plasticity episode
and persisted [25]. The fact that there was no growth of
additional spines during the second plasticity period,
while the functional adaptation occurred much faster
and more reliably, suggests that the persistent spines
facilitate the second adaptation [25]. Therefore, these
spines serve to “remember” the previous sensory experi-
ences the animals had. Two subsequent studies [28, 29]
further bolstered the case by showing that also in the
motor cortex the generation of new spines forms the
basis of learning motor tasks of different sorts. Interest-
ingly, in one of these studies [28] it was also found that
relearning a task occurred faster and did not involve the
generation of new spines, again arguing for persistent
spines “memorizing” specific motor tasks. Furthermore,
this study demonstrated that learning different tasks
involves different sets of spines, providing a strong
argument for spines and not cells being the relevant
entity for information storage in the brain.
These three papers were among the first to make a
strong case for a causal relationship between new
(or changing) spines and learning or information storage
in the brain. Subsequently, a number of studies further
strengthened this hypothesis. Some of them used fear con-
ditioning to show that also in this paradigm learning is
paralleled by structural changes: fear extinction and fear
conditioning are marked by the generation or removal of
spines in the frontal association cortex [30] and the
auditory cortex [31]. One particularly interesting finding
in this context is that extinction induces appearance of
spines that were eliminated upon the original fear
conditioning to the same stimulus but not to a distinct
conditioned stimulus, suggesting that the spines are again
specifically associated with extinction of one specific asso-
ciation [30]. Interestingly, also in a completely different
animal model—song learning in zebra finches—it was
shown that new spines are generated in the forebrain
nucleus HVC when an animal learns a new song from a
tutor [32].
Finally, what about the experiment that has long been
on the agenda [33], namely to specifically ablate spines
that have been generated during learning? If the above
interpretations are true, spine ablation should lead to
forgetting of the information that was learned when the
new spines were generated. First important strides in
that direction have been made in a recent experiment by
the group of Haruo Kasai [34], who specifically labeled
spines that were generated at a particular time window
immediately after learning. When these spines were later
Poo et al. BMC Biology  (2016) 14:40 
Page 5 of 18
 ablated or at least reduced in size, the animal indeed
forgot the previously learned information. The learning
paradigm is so far relatively simple (rotarod learning)
but it provides a very nice indication that the generation
of new spines or their enlargement is truly causal at least
in some forms of learning.
Taken together, there is now considerable evidence
from different species as well as from different learning
paradigms that spines, and thus synapses, change when
an animal learns. Furthermore, there are convincing in-
dications that the maintenance of previously established
structural connections on the level of dendritic spines
explains the memory phenomenon of savings. Finally, if
spines are ablated, an animal forgets what it has learned
through the addition of new or stronger spine synapses.
All of these experiments seem to point strongly towards
the notion that spines or synapses (and not entire cells)
may be the smallest unit of memory storage in the brain
and it may, therefore, be most appropriate to say that
the “engram” of a memory is laid down in the set of
spines or synapses that are changed when specific infor-
mation is stored. This is of course not to say that
engrams are not visible on the level of single cells
(see preceding contribution to this Forum by Pignatelli,
Ryan, and Tonegawa); after all, the activity of cells is
determined by the complement of their synapses. Yet, the
finest resolution of the engram may only become apparent
if one truly considers everything on the basis of the
pattern of synapses or spines which are changed during a
particular memory event.
A cell biologist’s view of memory: revisiting the
neuron doctrine
Kelsey C. Martin
Over a century ago, the anatomist Ramon y Cajal used
the Golgi staining method to visualize individual cells in
the brain. He observed that the brain was composed of
discrete cells rather than of a “reticular network” of
interconnected cells (as was commonly believed at the
time). Cajal’s observations provided critical support for
the neuron doctrine, which postulates that the neuron is
the central unit of the brain. At the same time, his
drawings revealed the beautiful complexity, polarity, and
compartmentalization of neurons: cell bodies elaborating
axonal and dendritic processes, forming up to thousands
of synapses with one another. With a remarkable amount
of prescience, Ramon y Cajal also speculated that
memories were stored as increases in the numbers of
connections between neurons. This idea forms the
basis of learning-related synaptic plasticity—the idea
that memories are stored as changes in the number
and strength of synapses between neurons—a frame-
work that has endured as a model for understanding
the biology of memory.
Studies of memory in rodents and goldfish performed
in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that long-term
memory required protein synthesis whereas short-term
memory did not [35]. Subsequent studies of learning-
related plasticity in organisms ranging from Aplysia
sensory-motor synapses to rodent hippocampal synapses
similarly demonstrated that long-lasting forms of plasti-
city can be differentiated from short-term plasticity by
their dependence on RNA and protein synthesis [36].
Molecular biological approaches led to the identification
of many genes that contribute to long-term plasticity
and memory and to the elucidation of specific patterns
of neuronal activity and specific signaling pathways that
trigger changes in RNA and protein synthesis within
neurons. These findings gave rise to the idea that activity-
dependent changes in the neuronal transcriptome and
proteome mediate and/or maintain the changes in neur-
onal structure and physiology that result in persistent
changes in synaptic strength.
Initially, studies of gene expression underlying mem-
ory focused on activity-dependent changes in transcrip-
tion in the nucleus. The discovery of immediate early
genes, such as c-fos, arc, and zif268, that were induced
during memory formation implied that the neuron was
the unit of long-term plasticity and memory [37]. Imme-
diate early genes are now widely used to map neurons
involved in memory formation, in line with the idea that
memories are encoded within networks of discrete neu-
rons in the brain.
In contrast to this neuron-centric view of memory
formation, studies of learning-related plasticity revealed
that plasticity was synapse-specific, that is, it could occur
at some but not all synapses made by an individual
neuron [38]. This finding raised questions about how
the products of gene expression, synthesized in the nu-
cleus, could be targeted to alter structure and function
at subsets of synapses within a single, highly polarized
and compartmentalized neuron. One solution to this
question came from findings that mRNAs localized to
distal dendrites and synapses [39], where their transla-
tion could be regulated by activity. These findings in-
cluded
detection
of
polyribosomes
at
the
base
of
synapses as well as the identification of a subset of
mRNAs that localized to distal dendrites. Studies from
several labs have identified hundreds to thousands of
dendritically localized mRNAs [40–42] translation of
which could alter the structure and function of synapses,
thereby making the synapse (or neighborhood of synapses),
rather than the entire neuron, the unit of plasticity.
Local translation at synapses has been shown to regu-
late translation in a synapse-specific manner [43, 44]
and inhibiting local translation at synapses in a variety of
in vitro preparations has been shown to block long-term
learning-related plasticity [45, 46]. In one of these
Poo et al. BMC Biology  (2016) 14:40 
Page 6 of 18
 preparations, the Aplysia sensory-motor culture system,
we
directly
tested
the
relationship
between
trans-
criptional regulation in the nucleus and translational
regulation at the synapse during synaptic plasticity and
found that stimulus-induced newly transcribed localized
mRNAs were delivered throughout the neuron but were
only translated at locally stimulated synapses [47]. The
implication of this finding is that activity-dependent
transcription sets the entire neuronal arbor in a state of
readiness to respond to local cues via regulated transla-
tion of localized mRNAs. From the perspective of
activity-dependent gene regulation, this idea shifts the
focus from the neuron as the unit of plasticity to the
synapse (or neighborhoods of synapses). In so doing, it
underscores the need to refine the current neuron-based
maps of memories by developing synaptic maps of
memory in the brain (Fig. 2).
The focus on the synapse as the unit of plasticity calls
into question aspects of the neuron doctrine. Thus,
while the neuron doctrine assumes that neurons are
separate, autonomous units, cell biological studies of
synapses indicate that all components of the synapse are
intimately interconnected, including not only the pre-
and post-synaptic compartments but also glial processes.
For example, in one study of local translation at Aplysia
sensory-motor synapses, we found stimulus-induced
local translation of a reporter depended on trans-
synaptic signals from the post-synaptic motor neuron
compartment to the presynaptic sensory neuron com-
partment [44]. Taking the idea of non-cell autonomy to
an extreme, recent studies have reported that neurons
and/or glia can transfer mRNAs and microRNAs to
neighboring neurons and/or glia [48]. This finding raises
the provocative idea that gene expression can be regulated
by transfer of genetic information from cell to cell. As
such, the idea of “local” translation serving to alter the
structure and function of synapses encoding a memory
suggests that “synaptic maps” of memory are not encoded
by discrete synaptic compartments of individual cells but
rather by complex fluid synaptic neighborhoods. These
neighborhoods include not only the products of gene
expression that are made in the nucleus of the neuron the
synapse belongs to but also signals (including RNAs) from
neighboring neurons and glia.
To add an additional layer of complexity onto this view
of memory, single cell RNA sequencing experiments have
uncovered remarkable complexity in the nerve cells and
glia within the brain [49]. These findings indicate that syn-
aptic neighborhoods are not just comprised of common
modules of pre-synaptic, post-synaptic, and glial compo-
nents but that they also exist in a multitude of distinct fla-
vors or “ethnicities” as neighborhoods. A recent electron
microscopic reconstruction of a small volume of mouse
neocortex revealed that the formation of synapses between
neurons is more dependent on cell identity than on prox-
imity [50]. The diversity of cell identities, in combination
with the idea that cell identity drives synapse formation,
indicates that generating a synaptic map of memory will
require understanding the distinct identities of the partici-
pating cells as well as the details of their cell-to-cell
interactions.
As a cell biologist interested in understanding mem-
ory, the challenges moving forward include identifying
conserved local processes that persistently alter synaptic
function and developing methods to manipulate these
processes in order to test their function in the formation
and storage of memory. Possibilities include local mech-
anisms of translational regulation at synapses, trans-
Fig. 2. Neuron versus synaptic maps of memory. The Golgi method used by Ramon y Cajal at the turn of the 19th century revealed that the
brain consisted of individual nerve cells, leading to the formulation of the neuron doctrine. In modern neurobiology, expression of soluble
fluorescent proteins allows visualization of individual neurons in the brain or, as shown here, in a hippocampal pyramidal neuron in dissociated
culture (blue) (a). Identification of immediate early genes, such as cFos, provides a means of labeling the nuclei of individual neurons that are
activated to undergo transcription following neuronal activity (violet) (b). This provides a neuron-level map of activity. However, each neuron
forms thousands of synapses, shown in c by labeling a single neuron with presynaptic (green) and postsynaptic (red) markers (yellow where the
pre- and post-synaptic elements are adjacent to one another). Note that this neuron is connected to other neurons in the culture that are not
shown. Developing a synaptic rather than a neuron-wide map of memory requires obtaining activity-dependent markers that label the activated
synapses rather than nuclei. Understanding synaptic maps will not only require understanding the identity of individual neurons but also the
details of their cell-to-cell interactions

 synaptic signaling pathways (including the transfer of
RNAs via extracellular vesicles), interactions between
synaptic cell-adhesion molecules, and even extracellular
matrix dynamics. As an example of the latter, Roger
Tsien has proposed that memories may be stored in the
pattern of holes formed within the perineuronal net, a
specialized extracellular matrix structure that is formed
at the end of critical periods in the brain [51]. Taken to-
gether, recent lessons learned suggest that elucidation of
these local processes requires consideration of the syn-
aptic compartment as a local environment rather than as
a collection of separate and autonomous membrane
bound compartments. While morphology, from Golgi
stains to electron microscopy, emphasizes the boundar-
ies between cells in the brain, molecular cell biological
studies uncover a fundamental role for local cell–cell
interactions and interconnections in the encoding of
memories.
Memory as a functional consequence of
epigenetic priming in engram neurons
Andrii Rudenko and Li-Huei Tsai
Memory formation, storage, and recall constitute the
essence of human nature. The search for the mecha-
nisms underlying learning and memory has revealed the
importance of a number of molecular and cellular
processes, such as activity-dependent gene expression,
intracellular signaling cascades, and synaptic plasticity
[52, 53]. The long-lasting attempts to characterize mem-
ory localization recently resulted in identification of
specific neuronal populations—so-called engrams—that
provide a physical location for the storage and retrieval
of memory traces [14, 15, 54, 55]. Despite discovery of
the engram cells, molecular mechanisms of memory
storage remain unclear. We propose that epigenetic
alterations taking place in these cells may represent a
critical process involved in the long-term retention of
memory traces.
One well-studied example of such alterations is histone
acetylation, a covalent mark of active chromatin. Muta-
tions in CBP, a gene product necessary for the acetylation
of multiple memory genes, result in severe intellectual dis-
ability in humans as well as in mice [56–58]. Conversely,
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) were shown to re-
store histone acetylation and ameliorate cognitive deficits
in a CBP-deficient mouse model [56, 57]. Moreover,
HDACi have been found to ameliorate memory deficits in
mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease [59, 60]. In addition
to histone acetylation, several other epigenetic mecha-
nisms, including DNA methylation and hydroximethyla-
tion, have also been demonstrated to regulate memory
function [61, 62].
While inhibiting HDACs was found to be effective in
enhancing synaptic plasticity and memory, such inhibition
per se, in the absence of neural stimulation, produced very
limited results [63, 64]. Thus, HDAC inhibition appears to
convey its effects on learning and memory via facilitating
gene expression elicited by neural activity, a phenomenon
known as epigenetic priming [65, 66].
As discussed earlier in this Forum by Pignatelli, Ryan,
and Tonegawa, a recent study by Ryan et al. [16] has
elegantly demonstrated that inhibiting protein synthesis
during the memory consolidation window does not dis-
rupt memory retrieval by means of engram activation.
This exciting observation suggests that while augmented
synaptic strength may be critical for memory encoding,
some other mechanisms, potentially involving epigenomic
modifications in engram neurons, appear to be necessary
for memory trace storage. The recent discovery that long-
term memory can be re-instated following erasure of its
synaptic expression strongly supports this idea [67]. We
propose
that,
mechanistically,
the
engram
cells
are
marked, or tagged, not only synaptically [68] but also at
the epigenetic level, be it histone acetylation, methylation,
DNA methylation, or Topoisomerase IIβ-dependent topo-
logical changes of the DNA/chromatin, as recently sug-
gested by our work [62, 69]. Specifically, the initial phase
of memory formation would cause changes in the epigen-
etic state of the engram cells through a priming event
which may be protein synthesis-independent (for example,
epigenetic modifications to make specific genomic regions
poised
for
efficient
transcriptional
activation).
Such
changes may also lead to long-lasting alterations in chro-
matin structure and function underlying the memory
consolidation process. Finally, memory retrieval would
signal the engram cells potentiating initial epigenetic
priming, including molecular events such as generation of
DNA breaks within the promoter areas of early response
genes such as c-Fos, Npas4, Nr4a1, and Egr1 [69],
triggering expression of the primed genes leading to pro-
tein synthesis and increases in the number and strength of
the synapses. Such a chain of events may explain why,
even after considerable neurodegeneration, HDAC inhib-
ition coupled with behavioral training is capable of re-
instating learning and retrieval of long-term, and even
remote, memory [59, 70]. This scenario may be possible if
engram cells, epigenetically primed by the initial learning
experience and capable of re-engaging in the chain of mo-
lecular events leading to memory retrieval, still remain in
the brain after neurodegeneration.
We should note that in these early days of functional
memory engram investigation, we still do not have
satisfactory answers to many important questions. For
example, the exact molecular and structural features of
engram-containing networks, or potential mechanisms
that might allow participation of a specific neuron in
different engram ensembles, currently remain unknown.
Moreover, although there is accumulating evidence of
Poo et al. BMC Biology  (2016) 14:40 
Page 8 of 18
 the epigenetic marks/tags that would prime engram cells
for an efficient transcriptional response, the exact nature
of those marks remains unclear. Deciphering such prim-
ing signatures will help us immensely in understanding
the mechanistic basis of memory processing.
Memory mechanisms: LTP and LTD in partnership,
not merely in opposition
Richard W. Tsien, Gord Fishell, and Caitlin Mullins
How memory is stored in the brain can be effectively
queried by examining how this process is affected in
neuropsychiatric conditions. To this end, many aspects
of the emerging pathophysiology of autism spectrum
disorders (ASD) may provide insight into the tuning of
synaptic strength in memory [71]. In ASD and related
intellectual disability (ID), gene discovery points to dys-
regulation of interrelated neuronal functions, including
control of nuclear gene expression, local protein synthe-
sis in dendrites, and excitation:inhibition (E:I) coordin-
ation. These functions are linked together in feedback
loops involving electrical or chemical sensors, termed
“homeostats”. The feedback loop may malfunction as a
result of disease-causing mutations in any of the compo-
nents. Given the effects of these disorders on cognition,
it is likely no accident that the same set of functions
loom large in current thinking about memory. Indeed,
consideration of ASD and other neuropsychiatric dis-
eases provides fresh perspective on the basic underpin-
nings of memory. From this viewpoint, we offer some
thoughts about the relationship between LTP and LTD
and the way that information in the brain may be stored
and retrieved.
In an intriguing study published in 2012, Bourne and
Harris used serial section electron microscopy to com-
pare dendrites receiving either theta burst LTP or
control stimulation [72]. As expected for LTP [34, 73],
they found single spines with increased postsynaptic area
by 2 h. Surprisingly, however, this occurred concomitant
with a remarkable reduction in the number of small
spines, leaving the total postsynaptic area per unit den-
dritic length unchanged compared with control (Fig. 3a).
The constancy of total postsynaptic area per unit den-
dritic length fits well with prevailing concepts about
homeostasis and normalization, but it also raises pro-
vocative questions about the neurobiological mechanism
and organization of memory.
Two previously proposed and rather different hypoth-
eses considered here might explain the underlying basis
Fig. 3. Possible mechanisms of synaptic modification in memory storage. a Structural synaptic scaling is analyzed by serial section electron microscopy
in hippocampal tissue under control and LTP (induced via theta burst stimulation) conditions. Control and LTP dendrites have equal postsynaptic areas
(red outline) despite differences in synaptic density and size. Adapted from [72], with permission. b Representation of metaplasticity occurring, shifting
the plasticity threshold (θm). The graphs on the top row depict the distribution of synaptic responses, red shading indicating LTP and white shading LTD.
The four synapses illustrated (bottom row) reflect how the shifting of θm would impact the strength of individual synapses (intensity of red shading
correlating to strength). Stage 1 depicts a saturating event, where all of the synaptic strengths have been excited to levels above θm. Stage 2 shows a
metaplastic response to the activity levels reached in stage 1. In stage 2, θm has shifted such that some synapses are below the new threshold and
weaken in stage 3. This changed θm leads to a new stable state, illustrated in stage 4. Reproduced from [75], with permission. c Synaptic potentiation at
one spine (center, upward-pointing black arrow added for emphasis) is predicted to temporarily increase activity at adjacent spines. In response to the
increased activity, homeostatic plasticity weakens the entire area (negative feedback arrows), with closely neighboring spines being disproportionately
weakened (downward-pointing white arrows). The weakened spines allow the overall dendritic length to maintain a constant level of activity with the
central spine still maintaining a level of potentiation. Adapted from [76], with permission

 of
Bourne
and
Harris’
observations.
In
reviewing
evidence for a “sliding threshold” concept [74], synaptic
plasticity with flexible rules (metaplasticity), Deisseroth
et al. [75] discussed a scheme that could fit with Bourne
and Harris’ results (Fig. 3b). If a stretch of dendrite
receiving strong inputs undergoes LTP but then autore-
gulates the threshold dividing LTD and LTP, it would
attain a new equilibrium that fractionates the synapses
into stronger and weaker subpopulations (Fig. 3b). Also
pertinent to Bourne and Harris’ results, Rabinowitch
and Segev [76] focused on lateral coordination of synap-
tic strength, invoking unknown mechanisms of local
regulation on dendritic branches. In their hypothesis,
LTP at spines receiving strong synaptic input is yoked
together by a compensatory mechanism that weakens, or
even eliminates, nearby neighbors (Fig. 3c).
Although these papers make no reference to each other,
they converge on a shared view of synaptic plasticity,
jointly supported by biological evidence and theoretical
rationale: a synapse may undergo Hebbian strengthening
or weakening as an individual entity but, over time, it can
also behave as a connected entity, operating in coordin-
ation with other synapses in the same neuron or dendritic
branch. Further, LTP and LTD can cooperate to redis-
tribute synaptic weight. This notion differs from the trad-
itional analogy between synapses and digital information
storage devices, in which bits are stored and retrieved
independently. On the other hand, coordination amongst
multiple synapses, made by different inputs, provides
benefits with regard to issues of normalization and signal-
to-noise.
What can be said about the molecular mechanism(s)
that might allow or even drive the coexistence of LTP
and synaptic weakening in close proximity along a
stretch of dendrite? This question has received much
less attention than strengthening and weakening of the
same synapses (see, for example, an elegant demonstra-
tion of LTP and LTD in direct opposition [22]). In the
spirit of this Forum, we list here multiple possibilities for
such lateral interaction:
1. Concentration
of
the
excitatory
neurotransmitter
glutamate ([Glu]) must fall off with increasing distance
from a strong input and could play some role in
lateral interactions. Whereas NMDA receptors are
essential for most forms of postsynaptically expressed
LTP and are driven by high [Glu], lower levels of [Glu]
would be sensed by the more sensitive metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGluR) at nearby synapses and
could foster LTD mechanisms.
2. Different programs of local protein synthesis may
be triggered by NMDARs and mGluRs and support
LTP (e.g., increased synthesis of AMPA receptors)
or LTD (e.g., upregulation of Arc). As we propose
elsewhere [71], mutual inhibition between such
translational programs could help enforce a sharp
threshold dividing LTP and LTD, whereby local
signals mediate LTP proximally and LTD at a
distance. Interestingly, defects in either program
can give rise to ASD.
3. βCaMKII
(beta
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II) is well-suited to serve as a local
sensor of activity-dependent rises in Ca2+ because
of its high Ca2+/CaM sensitivity. Hence, βCaMKII
can also serve as an arbiter, dictating the decision
between exo- and endocytosis of AMPARs to pro-
mote LTP/LTD. High [Ca2+] activates βCaMKII,
increasing AMPAR exocytosis [77]. In contrast,
low [Ca2+] leads to CaM-free, kinase-deactivated
βCaMKII interacting with Arc, facilitating AMPAR
endocytosis [78].
4. AMPA receptors can also be redistributed along the
dendritic length by coordination of exocytosis of
AMPARs and LTP at one site with endocytosis of
AMPARs and LTD in flanking regions. A frank
lateral transfer of AMPARs [79] could support a
coupling of LTP/LTD at nearby dendritic spines.
Many studies on the cell biology of the dendrite take
on different meaning if considered in this light. Also, an
organizational principle of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”
might engender marked strengthening of some synapses
(rich getting richer) at the expense of others (poor
getting poorer), thus contributing to empirical observa-
tions of a highly skewed distribution of synaptic weights
[80–82]. It remains to be seen, however, whether the
observations of Bourne and Harris are relevant to
behavioral memory in vivo and whether the tradeoff of
synaptic strength is predominantly a local, dendritic
branch-based phenomenon as suggested by Rabinowitch
and Segev [76] or also strongly dependent on regulation
at the neuron-wide level [75, 83]. We have spoken little
about the temporal dimension but the static snapshots
in Fig. 3 are clearly shorthand for complex dendritic dy-
namics. Whatever the molecular/subcellular mechanism
and dynamics, tradeoffs in synaptic strength will have a
strong influence on the way that memory traces are
stored and retrieved. As the debate continues about
memory engrams and persistent changes at the level of
synapses, synaptic neighborhoods, ensembles of cells,
and even whole circuits, we would do well to consider
redistribution in net synaptic strength as an underlying
mechanism, rather than merely net increases or de-
creases. Perhaps we should modify silicon-based notions
of memory units with independent read-write capabil-
ities and embrace assemblies—not just “cell assemblies”
[1, 17] but also “synaptic assemblies”—in their full
spatiotemporal glory.

 A role for adult-born neurons in pattern
separation
J. Tiago Gonçalves, Matthew Shtrahman,
Stephen T. Johnston, and Fred H. Gage
Memory involves the complex interplay between form-
ing representations of novel objects or events and devel-
oping generalizations of similar experiences. Distinct
instances of similar events must be discriminated—for
example, being able to find your car at work despite
parking in a different spot every day—but, at the same
time, experiencing just a fragment of a familiar experi-
ence, such as a particular smell, can trigger specific
memories from your childhood. The interplay between
forming distinct memories and generalizing events is
conceptualized to involve two separate processes: pat-
tern separation and pattern completion.
The dentate gyrus (DG) is the information gateway of
the hippocampal formation and as such plays a crucial
role in hippocampal function, including the formation of
episodic memories. Additionally, the DG is one of only
two regions within the mammalian brain that generates
new neurons throughout the life span of an individual in
both rodents and humans [84–86]. There is increasing
evidence that adult-born dentate granule cells (DGCs)
are important for fine pattern separation of similar but
distinct events [87, 88].
The DG as a pattern separator
The elegantly delineated anatomy of the hippocampus
has long served as a substrate for theories about
memory formation. It is grossly delineated into a series
of interconnected loops within four major subregions.
Specifically, the DG of the hippocampus receives excita-
tory input from the entorhinal cortex (EC) via the per-
forant path [89]. The DG then projects through the
mossy fiber tract to form powerful synaptic connections
with CA3 neurons, which in turn project to CA1, form-
ing the classic trisynaptic pathway. In addition, the DG
projects to and receives input from local inhibitory inter-
neurons, most notably from the hilus.
In rodents, the DG contains approximately four- to
fivefold more neurons than up- or downstream EC and
CA3, respectively. Thus, input from relatively few cells is
processed by a much larger neural network within the
DG before generating a condensed output. However,
only a small percentage of DGCs is activated in response
to a given event [90, 91]. Based on these characteristics,
modeling studies postulate that the DG is a competitive
network that can function as a pattern separator by par-
tially de-correlating inputs [3, 92]. One prediction from
this theory is that the DG is critical for forming memor-
ies of events that are similar but not identical to each
other. This prediction is supported by accumulating evi-
dence from both high-resolution functional MRI studies
in humans and studies of “behavioral pattern separation”
in rodents [93, 94], where subjects discriminate between
similar environments or sensory stimuli presented at dif-
ferent times.
What mechanistic role do adult-born DGCs play in
behavioral pattern separation?
Although the gross anatomical connectivity of the DG
suggests a role in pattern separation, the DG’s ability to
perform this function appears to be further enhanced via
its ability to incorporate new neurons. Adult-born DGCs
undergo a lengthy process of morphological and physio-
logical maturation before they fully integrate into the
local hippocampal network [95]. Each immature DGC
enters a critical period of greater plasticity approximately
4 to 6 weeks after it is born. These immature DGCs ex-
hibit greater excitability [96], receive less inhibition from
local interneurons [97], are more broadly tuned to input
stimuli [98], and exhibit greater synaptic plasticity [99]
than
mature
cells.
Therefore,
immature
adult-born
DGCs may perform unique computational tasks critical
for hippocampal function, in particular behavioral pat-
tern separation [87, 100].
The physiological properties of immature neurons at
the single-cell level, however, might yield counterin-
tuitive predictions at the circuit level. While hyperexcit-
ability and broad tuning of immature neurons may allow
the hippocampus to encode novel stimuli, their broad
tuning would also seem to suggest that a hippocampal
circuit rich in immature neurons would fire more fre-
quently and indiscriminately to various environmental
inputs. Yet, this explanation appears to conflict with the
role of the DG in pattern separation. Therefore, it has
recently been proposed that, though hyperexcitable
themselves, these immature neurons’ key contributions
could be to suppress overall DG activity, maintain net-
work sparseness, and thereby decrease interference be-
tween memory representations [101–103] as illustrated
in Fig. 4. Individual immature neurons may be more
excitable and broadly tuned but it is hypothesized that
these cells in turn activate inhibitory interneurons in the
DG and hilus, resulting in greater inhibition of mature
DGCs. Developing a unified picture of how single-cell
physiological features combine to determine circuit-level
responses and behavior presents a great challenge for
future work.
Future steps for understanding the role of adult-born
neurons in the DG
Previous efforts to link DG function to cellular and mo-
lecular mechanisms have been hindered by technical
limitations. First, although extracellular recording of
DGCs has been used to monitor the dynamics of neur-
onal firing patterns, sparse activity within the DG makes
Poo et al. BMC Biology  (2016) 14:40 
Page 11 of 18
 it difficult to locate neurons, identify neuronal subtypes,
and monitor the activity of a large population of DGCs
[104]. Second, immunohistochemical analysis of imme-
diate early gene expression, such as c-fos, can assess ac-
tivity across a large population but only at limited time
points, providing a limited snapshot of DG activity.
Nevertheless, advances in in vivo recording techniques
promise to eventually enable the monitoring of DG cells
during behaviorally relevant tasks. In vivo imaging
methods [105] in particular would be perfectly suited for
recording DG activity—hundreds of cells can be moni-
tored simultaneously and cellular subtypes identified
through the use of genetic markers. Combined with
modern techniques to manipulate activity in adult-born
neurons, imaging large populations of neurons in vivo
would permit testing the hypothesis that immature and
mature DGCs work cooperatively to maintain the nor-
mal sparse network activity of the DG. These methods
also have the potential to provide further insights into the
mechanisms behind memory formation and recall, revolu-
tionizing our understanding of the features encoded by
both mature and immature DGCs and of how responsive-
ness to those features changes with learning.
Mechanisms for memorizing temporal sequence
and interval
Mu-ming Poo and Yang Dan
The temporal sequence and interval of events are
essential elements of episodic and procedural memories.
Where and how sequence and interval information is
stored in the brain remains a mystery. If modifications
of synaptic connectivity are the cellular substrates for
memory storage, then the challenge is to understand
how distributed synaptic changes within neural circuits
represent the sequence and interval of previously experi-
enced sensory or motor events.
In his physiological postulate for perceptual memory,
Hebb [1] proposed that reverberating activity generated
by perceptual experience along distinct neuronal path-
ways could provide temporary storage of the experience.
Repeated firing of a specific assembly of neurons in a
particular temporal sequence could then serve to im-
print the memory by modifying synaptic connections
among the cells and re-activation of the assembly in this
sequence represents recall of the memory.
The popular version of Hebb’s postulate refers to synaptic
modifications based on correlated pre- and postsynaptic fir-
ing (“cells that fire together wire together”), and it received
experimental validation with the discovery of long-term po-
tentiation (LTP) [5] and long-term depression (LTD) [106]
induced by high- and low-frequency presynaptic stimula-
tion, respectively—high-frequency stimulation results in
postsynaptic spiking and thus LTP due to correlated
activity, whereas low-frequency stimulation fails to do so,
leading to LTD. The discovery of spike timing-dependent
LTP and LTD [107, 108] led to further revision of Hebb’s
learning rule—the sequence of pre- and postsynaptic spik-
ing, rather than simple coincidence of activity, is critical
for determining whether the synapse is strengthened or
weakened. The defined time windows for spike timing-
dependent plasticity (STDP) [8, 109, 110] and its presence
at many excitatory synapses [111] suggest that temporal
information may be stored via STDP, and Hebb’s assembly
could be established by sequence-dependent synaptic

drive these interneurons, enhancing feedback inhibition from the hilus, which results in decreased overlap of activated DGCs and output to CA3,

 strengthening or weakening. In addition to the well-
studied
sequence
replay
in
the
hippocampus
(see
contribution by Long and Buzsáki in this Forum), this
hypothesis was supported by a finding that repetitive
visual stimulation with a unidirectional moving spot that
evokes sequential spiking of the cortical neurons enhances
their sequential firing in response to a flashed stimulus, in
a manner that depends on the speed of the conditioning
stimulus and activation of NMDA receptors in the visual
cortex [112].
The time window for STDP, normally quite narrow
(~20 ms) for LTP and wider and more variable (~20–
100 ms) for LTD, also imposes a limit on the time inter-
vals between pre- and postsynaptic spiking that can leave
a long-term imprint at the synapse. Could the interval be
extended via polysynaptic excitation within a network? A
simple test of this idea was performed in a random synap-
tic network formed by dissociated hippocampal neurons
in culture. Repetitive pair-pulse stimulation at a fixed
interval was applied to a single input neuron and changes
in the efficacy of polysynaptic connections within the net-
work were measured. The result showed that intervals up
to a few hundred milliseconds could lead to distributed
long-term modifications (both LTP and LTD) of polysyn-
aptic pathways within the network [113]. While this study
provides proof of principle for encoding long intervals
through polysynaptic delays, does the natural neuronal
network in the brain contain serially connected groups of
synchronously firing neurons (synfire chain) [114] to
encode long sequences and temporal intervals? The find-
ing of sequential firing of neurons in the premotor area
HVC of songbirds during each song syllable (which
lasts >100 ms [115]) indicates the existence of synfire
chains in the brain, the formation of which underlies song
learning [116]. Spike sequences lasting for several seconds
have also been observed in the mammalian neocortex [117].
In addition to STDP in polysynaptic networks, mem-
ories of time intervals on the order of seconds are also
likely to involve other mechanisms. In a study in zebra-
fish larvae, Sumbre et al. [118] applied a unidirectional
moving visual stimulus repeatedly at a fixed temporal
interval (several seconds) and recorded the population
activity of tectal neurons with Ca2+ imaging. They found
that following cessation of the visual stimulation, se-
quential firing of the tectal neurons resembling that
evoked by the moving stimulus reappeared at the same
time interval as the conditioning stimuli, and this
rhythmic reappearance lasted for up to 20 s. This post-
conditioning spontaneous rhythmic firing of tectal neu-
rons reflects short-term memory of a specific rhythm
with time intervals of seconds. Interestingly, since the
tectal activity did not persist continuously through the
several seconds of interval, it is unlikely mediated by
reverberation of activity in the polysynaptic network.
The underlying circuit mechanism and the location of
memory storage in this case remain unknown.
Remembering the association between events sepa-
rated by intervals ranging from seconds to tens of sec-
onds has been referred to as temporal associative
learning, and has been found in recent studies to depend
critically on entorhinal cortex (EC)–hippocampal circuits
[119–121]. Pathway-selective inhibition and optogenetic
activation of the EC–hippocampal circuit showed that
layer II “island cells” and layer III neurons of the EC con-
trol temporal associative learning [119, 120]; in particular,
persistent activity of medial EC layer III neurons may play
a key role [121]. Recent studies have also shown the exist-
ence of hippocampal “time cells” that fire at particular mo-
ments in a temporally structured experience [122–124],
suggesting a function that parallels that of place cells in
spatial memory. The sequential activation of such time
cells in the hippocampus may reflect temporally struc-
tured inputs from the cortex and other brain regions or
alternatively firing chain generated within local hippo-
campal circuits by repetitive sequential activity-induced
strengthening of synaptic connections.
Theories and models of sequence learning and interval
timing have been proposed [125–127] but very few
studies have directly addressed the circuit and synaptic
mechanisms [128, 129]. Since the cellular and synaptic
building blocks of memory are increasingly well charac-
terized and the technology for manipulating specific cells
is becoming available (see other contributions to this
Forum), the storage mechanisms for sequence and inter-
val information are now amenable to fruitful exploration.
Understanding these mechanisms is a pre-requisite for
further studies of circuit mechanisms underlying higher
cognitive functions involving complex temporal informa-
tion processing such as human language, the ultimate
challenge to neuroscience.
Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple: a repetitive
mechanism to support single trial learning
John Long and György Buzsáki
Memories are not “imprinted” immediately but evolve
over time. Memory has many forms and supportive
brain mechanisms. While learning complex skills and
habits, such as walking elegantly in high-heel shoes or
riding a unicycle, may require tens to thousands of repe-
titions, consciously remembering episodic information,
such as recalling one’s first date, often requires only a
single trial. The brain can achieve such a feat by deploy-
ing a mechanism that repeats segments of the original
episode subconsciously hundreds to thousands of times
after the experience. Such repetitions occur during non-
attentive, off-line states of brain operation in the form of
hippocampal
sharp
wave-ripples
(SPW-Rs).
SPW-Rs
operate as a time-compressing mechanism, which can
Poo et al. BMC Biology  (2016) 14:40 
Page 13 of 18
 transfer information from the hippocampus to numerous
regions of the neocortex. SPW-Rs also serve as a pre-
conscious “mixer” of existing knowledge and recently
acquired information. Thus, acquiring episodic memory
is a two-stage process, initiated by a rapid encoding
mechanism during attentive waking and followed by a
protracted consolidation process during “off-line” states
of the brain [130].
SPW-Rs are self-generated hippocampal patterns
The SPW-R complex is the most synchronous and
phylogenetically preserved pattern in the mammalian
brain, associated with enhanced transient excitability in
the hippocampus and its partner structures. These
super-synchronous bursts arise when the release of
subcortical neuromodulators within the hippocampus is
decreased—for example, during consummatory behav-
iors and slow wave sleep. A SPW-R is a superposition of
two events, the sharp wave-related population burst
(SPW), which emerges in the strongly recurrent system
of the CA2/3 regions, and the fast ripple oscillation,
which is dominant in the CA1 output circuit of the
hippocampus. The synchronous discharge of CA3 pyr-
amidal cells excites primarily the mid-apical dendrites of
the CA1 region and the inward currents brought about
by this transient depolarization process (40–150 ms)
manifest extracellularly as the local field potential SPW.
The response of target circuits to the strong SPW-
related depolarization is a fast oscillatory balancing act
between
principal
cells
and
perisomatic
inhibitory
interneurons, resulting in the LFP ripple and the phase-
locked discharge of sequentially active neurons [130]. It
is this waking history-dependent, sequential firing of a
large fraction of hippocampal cells, and consequent re-
cruitment of neocortical neurons, that makes SPW-Rs a
candidate biomarker for memory consolidation.
Compressed replay of experience during SPW-Rs
serves memory
The restructuring of hippocampal–cortical networks
through synaptic plasticity is necessary for the formation
of new episodic memories. Neurons participating in
SPW-R events are organized to fire sequentially and the
orderly structure of these events reflects a temporally
compressed version of the sequential neuronal firing pat-
terns observed in the waking animal [131, 132] (Fig. 5;
“replay”). For example, the sequences of “place cells”
[133] in a novel environment are formed from a combin-
ation of relatively fast-firing and slow-firing groups of
pyramidal neurons. Conspicuously, the former neurons
exhibit relatively unchanging temporal dynamics while
the latter are highly plastic. The greater plasticity of
slow-firing pyramidal neurons is evidenced by their
greater gain in place specificity during maze exploration
and their increased SPW-R-related recruitment during
sleep following waking experience [134]. These sequences
are not confined to the hippocampus–entorhinal system;
the SPW-R output also brings about sequential activations
in neocortical circuits, such as the prefrontal cortex [135],
leading to systems-level consolidation of the memory
trace. Even more direct evidence for the role of SPW-R
sequences in memory consolidation is provided by close-
loop truncation of SPW-Rs. Selective elimination of the
hundreds of SPW-R-assisted replays of recently learned
sequences during post-learning sleep prevented rats from
becoming proficient at a spatial-reference memory task
[136]. This supports the hypothesis that single-trial learn-
ing is made possible by repeated off-line SPW-R replays of
the wake-experienced episode.
Memory and planning: retrospective and prospective roles
for SPW- R
A particularly striking feature of SPW-Rs is that the
neuronal sequences contained in them can propagate
both forward and backward (Fig. 5) relative to waking
experience. Before the beginning of a journey upon a fa-
miliar maze, the upcoming sequences are preplayed dur-
ing SPW-Rs in a forward manner; that is, prior to a run,
the CA1 pyramidal cells fire in a sequence consistent
with the upcoming trajectory of the animal in the maze.
At the end of the journey, again, the same neurons are
reactivated during SPW-Rs but now in a reversed direc-
tion as the hippocampus recapitulates the landmarks
passed by the animal, though in a time-compressed
manner. These findings support the hypothesis that for-
ward replay events play a role in “planning” upcoming
trajectories [137]. This hypothesis is further supported
by several recent experiments that demonstrate that the
routes chosen by the animal in two-dimensional envi-
ronments or between maze corridors can be predicted
by the spike sequence content of SPW-Rs [138]. The
subconscious route-priming role of SPW-Rs is also sup-
ported by other experiments, which show that truncat-
ing SPW-Rs prior to a choice results in a spatial working
memory deficit [139]. Because the neurons participating
in SPW-Rs sequences are drawn from a diverse pool of
log-scale firing rate distributed neurons, with varying
coding, biophysical, circuit, and plasticity properties,
these events can transit a vast array of preexisting and
new information to downstream cortical partners [134].
To date, memory mechanisms in experimental animals
are typically studied in the framework of spatial naviga-
tion [133]. However, it is important to emphasize that
mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from
mechanisms of navigation in the physical world. There-
fore, neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real
and mental space, as well as place memory and episodic
memory, are fundamentally the same [140].

 Where is the study of Hebbian memory
mechanisms going?
Charles F. Stevens
BMC Biology brought together some of the leaders in
the learning and memory field to identify, from eight
separate perspectives, some of the currently most im-
portant questions and approaches for understanding
memory formation, consolidation, and retrieval. My job
is to relate the current state of the field to how, in my
opinion, it might evolve.
With rare, and highly valued, exceptions, a field de-
velops organically from where it started and from the
questions that grew out of each advance along the way.
Although several of the contributions to this Forum re-
late key ideas from earlier eras (Cajal, Golgi, and Semon)
to modern views, my starting point for the questions
that drive learning and memory research will be Hebb’s
1949 “firing - > wiring” proposal [1] for learning (cited in
the introduction to this Forum and in four of the
contributions).
Although Hebb’s book was always well known to
psychologists, it had essentially no impact on neurophysi-
ology (as neuroscience was known in those days) for about
a quarter of a century because the longest lasting form of
synaptic plasticity known before 1973 (the date of Bliss and
Lomo’s LTP paper [5]) was post-tetanic potentiation (PTP)
and this form of plasticity lasted, at most, only a few
minutes. The only suggested brain mechanism for memory
storage
had
been
“reverberating
circuits”
and
Von
Neumann gave a compelling argument against the plausi-
bility of this idea in his 1957 lectures at Yale on “The
computer and the brain” [141]. Neurophysiologists were all
very interested in the cellular basis of memory—everyone
agreed it was a central problem—but no one had any idea
how to study it.
As with any novel finding at odds with current know-
ledge and concepts, Bliss and Lomo’s LTP paper [5] did not
make an immediate splash. Indeed, during the next decade
only a hand-full of researchers worked on LTP. But over
the succeeding decades the study of LTP grew explosively
to become a large and important sub-field of neuroscience,
some would even say a preoccupation. As this Forum
shows, we have learned an enormous amount about synap-
tic plasticity in the two-thirds of a century since Hebb’s The
Organization of Behavior. But where will we go now?
First, I need to confess that my record for predicting
the future is abysmal: I have failed close to 100 % of the
time. This time, however, I am trying a new strategy to
see if I can move up from abysmal to, say, just terrible.
This new approach is to see where the questions that
drive our research have come from and then ask what
we might have missed in asking these questions. Because
of space constraints, I will focus on a single question:
what might Hebbian learning be missing?
Although Behaviorism is pretty much dead [142], there
is absolutely no question that reinforcement plays a key
role in what behaviors an animal selects. And, as anyone
who has experienced a traumatic event can tell you, the
circumstances associated with the event are committed
to an enduring memory (what were you doing when you
heard about the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks in the United
States?). Of course, everyone is aware of this, yet the
focus on Hebb’s rule tends to neglect these other types
of learning. Major exceptions to this are the climbing
fibers in the cerebellum and the mossy fibers in the CA3
region of the hippocampus, where a single impulse or
brief burst will fire the target neuron and is believed to
potentiate the other synapses that are active at the same
time. For both of these cases, Hebb’s rule is sufficient to
determine what needs to be learned.
Fig. 5. Place cell sequences experienced during behavior (middle panel) are replayed in both forward (left panel) and reverse (right panel) direction
during awake SPW-R. The rat is moving from left to right on a familiar track. Spike trains for place fields of 13 CA3 pyramidal cells (color ticks, spikes
of individual neurons) on the track are shown before (forward replay; left red box), during (middle), and after (reverse replay; right blue box) a single
traversal. The CA1 local field potential is shown on top (black traces) and the animal’s velocity is shown below. Reproduced from [137]

 So my specific prediction is that future scientists work-
ing on LTP/LTD (or STDP) will also include reward
(positive or negative) related mechanisms in their inves-
tigations of synaptic plasticity at the molecular, cellular,
circuit, and behavioral levels.
Where can we look to get guidance on wedding Hebb’s
rule to reinforcement learning? One of the simplest and
best studied examples of alternative learning rules is the
fruit fly olfactory system, where flies can learn to
approach or avoid any odor if that odor is paired with
reward (sugar water) or punishment (electric shock). A
good example from Glenn Turner’s laboratory [143] is
an electrophysiological study showing how a specific
dopamine neuron can decrease the synaptic strength of
inputs into a specific mushroom body output neuron
(MBON). The inputs into the MBON are synapses from
2000 mushroom body Kenyon cells and each odor acti-
vates a specific subpopulation of the Kenyon cells, about
100/2000. These 100 cells constitute a tag for that odor
[144], a unique subpopulation of Kenyon cells whose fir-
ing stands in for the odor’s combinatorial code generated
by odorant receptor neurons in the fly’s antennae. When
the odor is paired with a shock, the specific dopamine
neuron whose synapses overlap with the MBON’s den-
dritic arbor and with the Kenyon cell’s axonal arbor is
activated. Firing of this dopamine neuron is what causes
the Kenyon cell synapses to weaken and this change in
synaptic strength is responsible for the avoidance of the
odor associated with punishment.
Most scientists who study LTP/LTD/STDP use mam-
mals as their experimental animals. It seems, however,
that the dopamine system is, to a large degree, evolu-
tionarily conserved even though the fly circuits are
generally less complex than the corresponding ones in
vertebrates. I am not aware of a review article that docu-
ments the insect/vertebrate parallels in the dopamine
systems but the literature on the amygdala, a vertebrate
center for valence learning, is vast [145] and can be
compared to the large fly literature devoted to mush-
room body learning and memory [146].
We can see over the next few years if my success for
predicting future trends in science has improved.
