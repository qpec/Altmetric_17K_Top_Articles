BK channel inactivation gates daytime excitability
in the circadian clock
Joshua P. Whitt1, Jenna R. Montgomery1,w & Andrea L. Meredith1
Inactivation is an intrinsic property of several voltage-dependent ion channels, closing the
conduction pathway during membrane depolarization and dynamically regulating neuronal
activity. BK K þ channels undergo N-type inactivation via their b2 subunit, but the
physiological significance is not clear. Here, we report that inactivating BK currents
predominate during the day in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the brain’s intrinsic clock circuit,
reducing steady-state current levels. At night inactivation is diminished, resulting in larger BK
currents. Loss of b2 eliminates inactivation, abolishing the diurnal variation in both BK current
magnitude and SCN firing, and disrupting behavioural rhythmicity. Selective restoration of
inactivation via the b2 N-terminal ‘ball-and-chain’ domain rescues BK current levels and firing
rate, unexpectedly contributing to the subthreshold membrane properties that shift SCN
neurons into the daytime ‘upstate’. Our study reveals the clock employs inactivation gating as
a biophysical switch to set the diurnal variation in suprachiasmatic nucleus excitability that
underlies circadian rhythm.

 I
nactivation gating of ion channels is essential to electrical
signalling in most neurons. First characterized in Hodgkin and
Huxley’s classic studies of the action potential1, since then,
several distinct inactivation mechanisms have been identified
in Na þ, Ca2 þ and K þ channels2–5. Among voltage-gated K þ
channels, inactivation can occur via the classic ‘ball-and-chain’
mechanism involving pore occlusion by an intrinsic N-terminal
‘ball’ located on the cytosolic side of the a pore-forming subunit6.
In contrast, large conductance Ca2 þ- and voltage-activated
BK K þ
channels (KCa1.1, KCNMA1) are not intrinsically
inactivating7,8. However, inactivating BK currents have been
observed
in
some
central
neurons,
sensory
neurons
and
neuroendocrine
cells9–17.
In
adrenal
chromaffin
cells,
BK
inactivation is mediated by the b2 subunit18 and shares several
common features with Shaker N-type inactivation, including a
rapid time course and contribution of intracellular domains
sensitive to proteolytic cleavage19. Chromaffin cells express both
inactivating
and
non-inactivating
BK
channels,
associated
with distinct action potential behaviour20. Yet despite the well-
described mechanistic basis, understanding the physiological
relevance for BK inactivation has been complicated by other
properties conferred by the b2 subunit, including a shift in the
voltage dependence of activation and slowing of activation and
deactivation kinetics18,21.
To understand the role of BK channel inactivation in neuronal
excitability, we identified a circuit where b2 is expressed22 and
where dynamic regulation of the BK current is critical for
neural coding, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
hypothalamus23–25. The SCN circuit undergoes synchronized
daily oscillations in action potential firing frequency26, and
circadian
behavioural
and
physiological
characteristics
are
established by the parameters of the SCN circuit rhythm27,28.
BK channel expression varies over the circadian cycle in both
mouse SCN and fly clock neurons24,29–31. The daily rhythm in
BK protein abundance is linked to Per2 (ref. 24), a component of
the
canonical
transcription–translation
feedback
loop
that
encodes circadian time32. Correlated with expression levels,
SCN neurons exhibit a diurnal difference in steady-state BK
current magnitude, with smaller currents recorded during the day
and larger currents at night23,24,31. Both loss of BK current at
night and aberrant increase in BK current during the day result in
disrupted circuit rhythmicity, establishing the diurnal variation in
BK current as essential for expressing behavioural rhythms23–
25,29,33. Loss of this diurnal rhythm in BK current has been
recently linked to degradation of circadian rhythm in aged
animals33, underscoring the significance of understanding the
mechanisms that drive rhythms in BK channel activity in SCN.
Here we report that the b2 subunit produces inactivation of
SCN
BK
channels.
Using
patch-clamp,
long-term
action
potential, and behavioural recordings, we show that loss of b2
(b2 KO) abolishes the diurnal variation in both BK current
magnitude and SCN firing, and disrupts circadian circuit and
locomotor rhythmicity. We link these changes in excitability
specifically to BK channel inactivation by taking advantage
of the modular nature of b2, which allows selective rescue
of inactivation via delivery of the isolated b2 N-terminal
‘ball-and-chain’ domain. We further reveal that neurons with
inactivating BK currents fire faster, have depolarized membrane
potentials and increased input resistance, demonstrating that
inactivation unexpectedly contributes to the daytime ‘upstate’
in SCN neurons by controlling the amount of subthreshold
BK current during the inter-spike interval. Thus, inactivation
underlies the shift in BK’s influence on excitability between day
and night, and regulation of this biophysical mechanism is a
central node for the circadian regulation of firing in the SCN
clock circuit.
Results
b2 regulates SCN circuit rhythmicity and circadian behaviour.
The SCN expresses two subunits with the potential to modify BK
channel properties, b2 and b4 (ref. 22), but of these, only b2 can
cause inactivation of BK currents7,8. Since b subunits are
proposed to tailor BK channel properties and contribute to
distinct patterns of excitability across tissues34, to establish the
importance of the b2 subunit in the SCN circuit, we made long-
term recordings of spontaneous action potential activity from
wild-type (WT) and b2 KO SCNs. Individual SCN neurons
function as coupled, autonomous oscillators, generating a robust
synchronized rhythm in firing in ex vivo cultures (Fig. 1a)28,35. b2
KO SCNs had significantly reduced rhythmicity overall (Fig. 1b).
This was due to both a decrease in the number of rhythmic
recordings, as well as a reduction in the circadian amplitude
of the rhythmic recordings (Fig. 1c,d)36. The circadian period of
the rhythmic activity was not different (WT, 24.2±1.3 h and b2
KO,
23.4±1.2 h,
P ¼ 0.8),
instead,
the
reduced
circadian
amplitude stemmed from decreased action potential activity at
the peak (Fig. 1e).
Alterations in the SCN circuit were correlated with disrupted
circadian behaviour (Fig. 1f–g). Like SCN circuit activity,
circadian behavioural amplitudes were reduced in b2 KO mice
(Fig. 1h; Supplementary Table 1). Decreased circadian beha-
vioural amplitudes are associated with a more labile pace-
maker23,37,38, and consistent with this, b2 KO mice re-entrained
about a day faster to a 6-h phase advance of the light:dark cycle
and had augmented responses to a phase-shifting light pulse
(Fig. 1i,j; Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1). Taken
together, these results suggest that b2 is important for the
circadian patterning of action potential activity in the SCN
circuit, and that this mechanism is required for proper circadian
rhythmicity in the animal as a whole. Furthermore, the circadian
alterations were specific to loss of b2, as deletion of the b4
subunit, which is also expressed in SCN22, did not result in
significant changes in neuronal firing or behavioural activity
(Fig. 1c–e; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Discussion).
b2 mediates BK current inactivation in SCN neurons. To
determine the functional relevance of b2 regulation of SCN
circuit rhythmicity, we recorded BK currents from SCN neurons
using whole-cell voltage clamp. We observed two types of
macroscopic BK currents which varied by the amount of current
decay observed during the voltage step (Fig. 2a). Currents that
exhibited a pronounced decay within 30 ms were termed BKi and
had a fractional current ratio (IBK/IBKpeak)o0.7 at þ 90 mV
(Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). These BKi currents decayed
with time constants of 44±4 ms (at þ 90 mV, n ¼ 13) (Fig. 2c;
Supplementary
Fig.
2c,d),
similar
to
inactivating
BK
currents
described
in
other
neuronal
types18,20.
Other
currents were relatively sustained with little decay, termed BKs
(IBK/IBKpeak40.7). The much slower time course of decay for BKs
currents (172±13 ms, n ¼ 17; Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 2c) is
consistent with non-inactivating BK currents that show a limited
attenuation of current due to Ca2 þ clearance18. Overall, during
the day, most currents were BKi, while at night, most currents
were BKs (Fig. 2d). This suggested that the number of neurons
exhibiting BKi and BKs currents between day and night SCNs was
responsible for the diurnal difference observed in the steady-state
BK current magnitude within SCN (Fig. 2e).
Supporting this idea, we did not find that daytime BKi currents
decayed more rapidly, and thus to a lower fractional current
value, compared with night time BKi currents. Instead, the
average BKi current density (Fig. 2f) and fractional current values
(Supplementary Fig. 2b) were similar between day and night.

 These observations support a model where the simple summation
of BKi to BKs currents is a central factor in the day versus night
BK current levels observed across the SCN.
Since the b2 subunit produces inactivation of BK channels
expressed in heterologous cells and native tissues7,8,18,34,39,
we examined b2 levels to determine whether expression of the
b2 subunit was correlated with the increased number of BKi
currents
observed
in
daytime
SCNs.
BK
complexes
were
immunoprecipitated from SCNs harvested across the circadian
cycle. Although the expression of b2 did not differ across
time points (Fig. 3a,b), the relative ratio of b2 associated with the
BK a subunit was higher during the day (Fig. 3c), correlated with
the higher proportion of BKi currents (Fig. 2d). At night as
a expression increased, the ratio of b2:a was lower and consistent
with the increased number of BKs currents.
To determine whether b2 was required for the macroscopic
BKi current decay in SCN, we recorded BK currents from b2 KO
neurons. Only BKs currents were observed in b2 KO neurons
(Fig. 4a,b; Supplementary Fig. 2a), implicating inactivation as the
mechanism for the decay of BKi currents. As a consequence of
converting all currents to BKs during the day, the diurnal
difference in BK current magnitude was abolished in b2 KO

 SCNs (Fig. 4c). Although the small number of BKi currents
observed in WT neurons at night were also eliminated, the overall
night time b2 KO BK current levels remained unchanged. This
was expected since the vast majority of currents were already
identified as BKs in WT neurons at night. Further consistent with
loss of inactivation, the fractional current values and macroscopic
current decay time constants were increased in b2 KO during the
day, with no change at night (Fig. 4d,e; Supplementary Fig. 2a–c).
These results demonstrate that b2 underlies the reduction in
steady-state BK current levels during the day and is thereby the
central regulator of the diurnal difference in SCN BK current. As
a control, we also assayed the expression level and diurnal pattern
of the BK channel a subunit in b2 KO SCNs and found
no difference (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c), corroborating the
alterations in BK current magnitude stemmed from a loss of b2
function and not alteration of BK channel trafficking.
b Subunits produce complex effects on BK channel gating,
including
slowing
activation
and
deactivation,
and
shifting
the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized
potentials7,8,34,39. However, b2-mediated inactivation is separably
mediated by the intracellular N terminus, and transplantation or
exogenous application of this domain confers inactivation gating to
the BK a subunit in the absence of the b2 subunit7,11,40,41.
Conversely, mutation of the three residues comprising the
hydrophobic ‘ball’ (DFIW) removes inactivation while leaving
other gating properties of b2 intact42. If inactivation is the major
determinant of the day versus night difference in steady-state
current levels, then selective restoration of inactivation during the
day with the isolated N terminus should restore this difference to
b2 KO neurons. Alternatively, failure to restore the decreased
daytime BK current levels via inactivation with the b2N terminus
would suggest that other properties conferred by the b2 subunit are
necessary for the daytime decrease in steady-state BK current levels.
To test this, we first delivered the b2N terminus (b2N) as a
soluble peptide to BK channels expressed in heterologous
HEK293
cells
(Fig.
5).
b2N
produced
a
dose-dependent
inactivation, while a peptide harbouring the FIW mutation
produced
no
effect
(b2NDFIW;
Fig.
5a–d).
The
voltage
dependence of inactivation with b2N was similar to the intact
b2 subunit (Fig. 5e), and tinact values at b2N concentrations above
50 mM were similar to WT BKi currents recorded during the day
from SCN neurons (Fig. 5d). We next applied the b2N peptide to
SCN neurons via the patch pipette.
In b2 KO SCN neurons, application of b2N, but not b2NDFIW,
restored the macroscopic decay and reduced the fractional
current (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Fig. 2a). The voltage dependence
of inactivation and tinact values with b2N in b2 KO were similar
to WT BKi currents recorded during the day (b2 KO þ b2N at
þ 90 mV: 40±4 ms, n ¼ 20, Fig. 6a; Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).
Furthermore, b2N decreased b2 KO BK current levels back to
levels comparable to WT neurons (Fig. 6b), without affecting the
voltage dependence of BK current activation (Supplementary
Fig.
5)
or
other
voltage-activated
outward
currents
(Supplementary Fig. 6). The restoration of daytime BK current
levels by b2N support the conclusion that inactivation is the
critical function of the b2 subunit that underlies its role in driving
the diurnal variation in BK current properties in SCN.
Inactivation controls daytime membrane properties and firing.
If inactivation is required for the diurnal difference in BK
currents, then loss of the b2 subunit or selective rescue of
inactivation with b2N should alter neuronal activity. To test this,
we recorded spontaneous action potentials from WT and b2
KO SCN neurons. WT neurons fire at higher frequencies during
the day and decrease firing at night (Fig. 7a,b). Neurons with BKi
currents fired faster than those with BKs currents regardless of
time of day, suggesting that inactivation may play a role in setting
firing rate. Furthermore, the relative difference in firing between
BKi and BKs neurons during the day was as large as the net

 diurnal difference in firing across the SCN (Fig. 7b), suggesting
BK inactivation may be fundamental to the diurnal regulation of
firing rate. Consistent with this, b2 KO neurons did not exhibit a
day–night difference in firing rate, stemming from a marked
reduction in daytime firing (Fig. 7b,c). To verify that the reduced
firing, which was correlated with larger BK currents in b2 KO
neurons (Fig. 6b), was due to BK, the BK channel blocker
paxilline was applied. The reduced firing in b2 KO neurons was
reversed by paxilline (Fig. 7b), demonstrating that BK channels
were responsible for the altered excitability in b2 KO neurons.
These results corroborate the reduced peak firing observed in
SCN circuit recordings (Fig. 1e). In addition, these data may also
explain why loss of BK currents during the day has apparently
little effect on WT firing rates24,43. A detectable change in firing
after BK block in WT neurons may be precluded under standard
daytime conditions when two-thirds of SCN neurons undergo BK
inactivation. Following this idea, application of b2N, but not
b2NDFIW, increased daytime b2 KO firing rates back to WT levels
(Fig. 7b,d). b2N had no further consequences on firing beyond
that of blocking the BK current with paxilline (Fig. 7b),
demonstrating that the restoration of firing with b2N acts
selectively through BK channels. These results suggest that
inactivation normally removes BK currents from influencing
action potential firing rate during the day. Illustrating this in
another way, b2N could also aberrantly suppress BK current
(Fig. 8a–c) and elevate firing if applied to WT neurons at night
(Fig. 8d), underscoring the basis for the normal reduction in the
number of BKi currents found in the SCN at night.
What membrane properties does BK inactivation regulate to
facilitate daytime firing? A central node for circadian regulation
of action potential frequency is the balance of subthreshold
excitatory
and
inhibitory
currents
that
bring
the
resting
membrane potential closer to the firing threshold during the
day, or further from threshold at night26,44. K þ currents are
proposed to be central regulators of the day–night difference in
firing by regulating the daily transition between the daytime

 ‘upstate’ and night time ‘downstate’44–47. These states are
designated
by
differences
in
the
subthreshold
membrane
properties, with the most attention focused on the increase in
night time K þ current associated with hyperpolarization of the
membrane and lower input resistance44,45,47,48. BK channels
comprise a component of this upregulated K þ current, and loss
or block of BK currents causes depolarization of the baseline
membrane
potential
and
hyperactive
firing
at
night23–25.
However, block of BK currents also depolarizes the membrane
potential during the day43,47,49, suggesting a role for BK
channels in daytime excitability not previously explored. Thus
to
determine
whether
BK
inactivation
makes
a
converse
contribution to the daytime reduction in K þ current that
defines the ‘upstate’ that is required for higher frequency firing,
we compared membrane parameters from neurons during the
day and night, and with loss of b2 or restoration of inactivation.
First, we found that BKi neurons had inter-spike membrane
potentials ranging from � 36 to � 51 mV, while BKs neurons
ranged from
� 47 to
� 54 mV during the day. Loss of
inactivation in b2 KO neurons resulted in hyperpolarization of
the inter-spike membrane potential compared with WT BKi
neurons
( � 57±1.4 mV
versus
� 50±1.1 mV,
respectively;
Po0.001,

This
shift
could
be
rescued
by

( � 52±0.8 mV), but not b2NDFIW ( � 56±1.5 mV; one-way
ANOVA, P ¼ 0.04; Bonferroni post hoc, Po0.05 for BKi versus
b2 KO or b2NDFIW), suggesting that BK channel inactivation
affects membrane potential during the inter-spike interval. To
further address this, resting membrane potential (Vm) and input

 ( � 55±1.7 mV and 0.7±0.1 GO, respectively; Fig. 9a,b). This
suggests less current would be required to elicit an action
potential in BKi compared with BKs neurons.
If inactivation of BK currents is involved in the changes in Vm
and Ri between BKi and BKs neurons, then loss of b2 should also
alter these parameters. We found that the Vm and Ri of daytime
b2 KO neurons was more similar to WT neurons at night
(Fig. 9a,b), suggesting b2 is required for the daytime ‘upstate’.
Furthermore, b2N restored the Vm and Ri values in b2 KO
neurons back to values comparable to WT, establishing the
sufficiency for inactivation of the BK current to convert the
daytime membranes to pro-excitable. Although b2 can also affect
excitability by shifting the voltage dependence of activation and
slowing activation and deactivation gating18,21 (Supplementary
Discussion), the data presented here affirm that these functions
are not directly involved in the diurnal regulation of membrane
properties that control firing frequency in SCN.
The effect of inactivation on resting membrane potential and
input resistance predicts that inactivation of BK currents would
occur during the inter-spike interval. To demonstrate this, we
recorded BK currents from traditional voltage step commands
across the subthreshold range of membrane potentials, as well as
BK currents evoked by SCN action potential commands (Fig. 10;
Supplementary Fig. 7). BKs current–voltage relationships showed
that daytime BK current activated at voltages more positive than
� 60 mV (Fig. 10a,b). There was 5–12pA of current evoked in the
subthreshold range, between the average resting and threshold
potentials of SCN neurons ( � 55 to
� 40mV). Night time
subthreshold BK currents (BKs) were also larger than the net
daytime BK current (Supplementary Fig. 7a). In contrast, daytime
BKi neurons had significantly reduced current in the subthreshold
voltage range (Fig. 10a,b). Consistent with data obtained from
voltage steps, using daytime SCN action potential commands
delivered at the normal daytime firing frequency, the amount of BK
current activated during the inter-spike interval was negligible in
BKi neurons compared with BKs neurons (Fig. 10c,d) or at night
(Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). BK currents evoked at the peak of the
action potential command were also reduced in BKi neurons
compared with BKs neurons during the day (Fig. 10e) or at night
(Supplementary Fig. 7d). In parallel experiments using daytime
action potential commands applied to channel complexes expressed
in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a–j), the subthreshold
current was reduced in patches containing BK/b2 or BK/b2N
compared with a-only channels (Supplementary Fig. 8f–i).
To further demonstrate that inactivation could affect BK
current levels at these subthreshold voltages in SCNs, b2 KO
neurons were held at a conditioning voltage for 100 ms,
corresponding to the shortest inter-spike intervals encountered
in spontaneously firing SCN neurons, followed by a step to
þ 90 mV to elicit a maximal BK current response (Fig. 10f).
Inactivation delivered via b2N reduced the maximal BK current
elicited following conditioning voltages in the subthreshold range,
compared with b2 KO cells treated with b2NDFIW (Fig. 10f,g).
Further depolarization of the conditioning potential resulted in
progressive current reduction that was dependent on the presence
of inactivation (Fig. 10f,g). Similar results were obtained with BK
channels expressed in heterologous cells with the intact b2
subunit or with b2N (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). These results
suggest that inactivation can reduce BK current under conditions
similar to the native inter-spike interval and provide a basis for
understanding the effect of BK inactivation on the resting
membrane potential and input resistance.
The data further propose that because some BK current would
be inactivated before an action potential, the current evoked by an
action potential would be reduced. This would be expected to
occur during the day in BKi neurons. To test this, we quantified
the peak BK current evoked by daytime action potentials applied
to SCN neurons (Fig. 10c,e) and to BK/b2 or BK/b2N channels
expressed in heterologous cells (Supplementary Fig. 8e–h,j). The
action potential-evoked BK current was reduced in BKi versus
BKs neurons (Fig. 10e) and in BK/b2 or BK/b2N conditions in
HEK293 cells compared with a-only channels (Supplementary
Fig. 8j). Taken together, these data support a model where BK
current inactivation is necessary during the day to regulate the
membrane parameters that initiate firing (membrane potential
and input resistance), while concurrently reducing the BK current
activated during an action potential. This idea further predicts
there would be little difference in the action potential waveforms
of BKi versus BKs neurons, an observation confirmed by analysis
of daytime action potential parameters (Supplementary Fig. 9).

 b2-mediated inactivation thus comprises an essential switch that
shifts membrane properties between day and night states by
inhibiting or permitting subthreshold BK current activation.
Discussion
The
circadian
patterning
of
neuronal
excitability
is
an
evolutionarily conserved feature of time-encoding circuits26,50.
In SCN neurons, which fire relatively slow, spontaneous action
potentials characteristic of pacemaker neurons49, the balance of
currents during the inter-spike interval is proposed to be the
predominant regulator of firing rate and a major node for
circadian regulation26,44,45,48. Correlated with the increased
number of BKi currents in SCN during the day, most neurons
have a more depolarized resting membrane potential that is closer
to threshold (DV B7 mV, from our data), increasing the
likelihood of firing an action potential. At night, and correlated
with the shift to BKs currents, the hyperpolarizing shift places the
membrane potential further from threshold (DV B12 mV),
reducing excitability. The amount of current required to produce
this shift is small (B5 pA), owing to the high input resistance of
SCN neurons, and the balance can be tipped either by altering the

 excitatory currents that bring the membrane potential closer
threshold, or the inhibitory currents that take the membrane
away from threshold. Recently, the identity of the channel
underlying the persistent Na þ
current
that provides the
depolarizing drive on excitability was identified as the leak
Na þ channel NALCN51. However, the identity of the K þ
channels counterbalancing the excitatory current has been
uncertain, particularly during the day when SCN neurons
undergo a dramatic reduction in K þ current44,45,49. Although
abrogation of one type of K þ current during the day, the
fast delayed rectifier, has also been shown to decrease firing
frequency,
the
reduced
firing
stems
from
slower
action
potential repolarization and not from depolarization of the
resting membrane potential52. Consequently, a direct test of
whether the daily shift in submembrane K þ currents is required
to drive the day–night difference in action potential firing has
been elusive.
In this study we provide surprising evidence linking alterations
in BK current with the daytime increase in input resistance,
depolarization of the membrane and higher frequency firing.
BK currents were previously thought to mainly play a night
time-restricted role as part of the surge of K þ current that
results in the firing nadir24,44,45. The less significant role for BK
channels in setting daytime frequency was attributed to a decrease
in expression of the pore-forming a subunit. However, in the b2
KO, the intact circadian pattern of a expression was insufficient
to support normal diurnal variation in BK current or SCN firing,
suggesting there must be other mechanisms that limit BK
channels from influencing daytime membrane properties. We
demonstrate that inactivation, achieved through b2-dependent
regulation of BK channel biophysical properties between day and
night, is the central mechanism that changes the influence of
BK channels on membrane properties between day and night.
Inactivation facilitates the daytime membrane ‘upstate’ by
reducing the BK current between spikes that would normally
inhibit action potential initiation. Inactivation also reduces action
potential-evoked current, and the sum of these two mechanisms
effectively removes BK channels from influencing daytime
excitability. In b2 KO SCN neurons, the absence of BK
inactivation
during
the
day
results
in
passive
membrane
properties
that
look
much
like
night
time
membranes.
Correspondingly, with b2N, restoration of inactivation is both
necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the Vm and Ri properties
that define the daytime membrane state. Importantly, the
identification of this biophysical mechanism to functionally
reduce a K þ current suggests that the balance of excitatory and
inhibitory currents is more actively regulated during the day than
previously thought45. Moreover, the disruption of circadian
behaviour in the absence of the b2 subunit underscores
the importance of both BK inactivation, and the diurnal
variation in SCN submembrane properties, in the regulation of
circadian rhythmicity. As such, BKi currents comprise an
electrophysiological
signature
for
a
previously
undetected
class
of
essential
oscillator
in
SCN
that
makes
a
vital
contribution to circadian behaviour. Even so, the residual
rhythmicity in b2 KOs hints that neuronal heterogeneity
contributes redundant mechanisms to circadian behavioural
rhythmicity (Supplementary Discussion), and it remains to be
determined how SCN neurons without inactivating BK channels
balance their daytime currents to control firing, and what
separable contribution these cells make to circadian behaviour.
Given that the BK current must be functionally reduced by
inactivation, what is the relevance of the daytime clock-linked
decrease in BK a subunit expression24,30? Such differences in
ion channel expression across the circadian cycle are broadly
proposed
to be central to rhythmicity26,
but an explicit
mechanism that translates channel expression differences into
action potential activity has not been established. In this study, we
showed b2 KO SCNs retained the normal day–night difference in
BK a expression, yet still displayed disrupted BK steady-state
current levels and action potential firing, demonstrating that
circadian differences in the BK a subunit alone are insufficient to
drive rhythmicity. Our data instead suggest a model in which the
clock-linked changes in a expression control the ratio of b2:a.
Since expression of b2 does not vary appreciably between day and
night, the higher daytime b2:a ratio facilitates inactivation in the
majority of SCN neurons, permitting transition to the ‘upstate’.
At night, inactivation is overcome by increased a subunit
expression,
reducing
the
b2:a
ratio
and
facilitating
the
‘downstate’. In support of this hypothesis, aberrantly increasing
daytime
BK
expression
reduces
inactivation
in
the
SCN
(Supplementary Discussion).
The data in SCN also provide a framework for understanding
the physiological relevance of BK channel inactivation, which is
too slow to produce substantial BK current decay during a typical
central nervous system action potential53. In other neurons where
higher frequency firing prevails, BK inactivation is thought to
contribute to spike frequency adaptation, which also integrates
over timeframes longer than a single action potential10,15,17. In
SCN neurons, which exhibit depolarized membrane potentials
and slow spontaneous firing, the results here suggest that enough
channels
undergo
inactivation,
or
remain
cumulatively
inactivated, during the inter-spike interval (100–500 ms) to
impact the input resistance and resting membrane potential.
Given tinact values of 35–100 ms in BKi neurons, steady-state
inactivation may be most relevant for setting the subthreshold BK
current level during the inter-spike interval. SCN neurons have
been shown to undergo subthreshold Ca2 þ oscillations49,54,
raising the possibility that Ca2 þ influx independent of the action
potential could contribute to BK channel activation, and
consequently BK inactivation, during the inter-spike interval. In
addition, the restoration of firing rate with b2N reveals that
inactivation mediated by the N terminus is sufficient for this role.
N-type inactivation typically occurs from the open state7,8, but
BK channels may also inactivate from closed states, affecting the
amount of steady-state current55. Thus, the data in this study
reveal a surprising twist to how cells use BK channels to regulate
excitability. While BK channels perform diverse roles spanning
excitable and non-excitable cells, in the CNS they are mostly
known for regulating firing frequency by underlying the fast
AHP56–58. Here we show in SCN, BK current activated outside of
the action potential is potentially the major contributor to
frequency regulation, making dynamic regulation of subthreshold
BK current via inactivation a novel role for BK channels.
In summary, although the combination of BKi and BKs
expressing cells has been observed within other tissues18, the
significance for how these currents work together to set
the ensemble properties underpinning physiological function is
not yet apparent53. In SCN, the cycling between predominantly
BKi currents during the day and predominantly BKs currents at
night suggests that partnering with the b2 subunit generates a
hardwired mechanism linked to the intrinsic clock to dynamically
disengage BK channels from regulating action potentials during
one phase of the circadian cycle.

 were collected from mice housed on a reverse 12:12 LD cycle. All procedures
involving mice were conducted in accordance with the University of Maryland
School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Guidelines and approved by the IACUC
Committee.
Organotypic slice culture. Brains were harvested from postnatal day 4 mice, and
the hypothalamus was blocked and sectioned into 300 mm coronal slices using a
manual chopper (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Slices containing SCN nuclei
were transferred onto Millicell filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and cultured
as interface explants in a CO2 incubator as described23. After 2 days, 20 mM
cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C, no. C6645; Sigma) was added to inhibit
glial proliferation, and the media was changed every 3 days thereafter.
Multielectrode array recordings. After 7 days in culture, organotypic slices were
cut from the surrounding membrane, inverted over the 64-electrode grid, and
adhered to 0.1% polyethylenimine and collagen-treated P210A probes (Alpha MED
Scientific, Osaka, Japan). Probes were placed on a MED CO2P connector
headstage, sealed with a vacuum-greased coverslip, and maintained in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator at 37 �C for the duration of the recordings. Media changes were
maintained every 3 days.
Signals from all electrodes on the probe were collected simultaneously with the
64-channel integrated amplifier (Alpha MED Scientific) and analysed as described
previously23. Five-second data samples were collected every 5 min at 20 kHz in
Conductor v3.1f (Alpha MED Scientific) and filtered at 100 Hz. Spontaneous
extracellular action potentials from visually identified electrodes within the SCN
were discriminated offline using threshold-based event counting. Circuit analysis
was performed on each slice from three cycles of activity at all electrodes within the
SCN. The multiunit spontaneous action potential activity from each electrode
located within the SCN was classified as rhythmic or arrhythmic. For rhythmic
recordings, a 2 h moving window average was applied to the raw data to calculate
the daily firing rate peak, and the ‘day’ firing rate value was the average of activity
for 2 h centred around the peak for each recording. Firing rate at the trough was
calculated from 2 h of activity at the nadir between two peaks. Arrhythmic firing
was calculated as the average firing across the whole cycle. Circadian amplitude was
reported as the w2 periodogram peak value (Clocklab; Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL,
USA). t, the length of the circadian period of the neural activity rhythm, was
determined as the highest peak above the 99% confidence interval of a w2
periodogram.
Circadian behavioural rhythms. For locomotor rhythms, mice (3–5 months old)
were housed individually in cages containing a running wheel for 10 days in LD
and 16 days in constant darkness (DD). Activity was sampled every 10 min in
ClockLab software (Actimetrics). Actograms were constructed by double-plotting
consecutive days of activity over the recording period. Circadian period and
amplitude were determined from 10 days of wheel running activity in DD in
Clocklab software as described previously23,24. For re-entrainment experiments,
after 7 days of stable entrainment, the LD cycle was phase advanced by 6 h. The
response was calculated as the number of days to stable re-entrainment. After
keeping mice in DD for 8 days, phase shifts in response to light pulses were
calculated as the number of hours between the activity onset regression fits before
and after a 30-min light pulse delivered in early subjective night (CT16). Alpha was
determined as the length of time an animal had consolidated activity using default
settings with manual adjustment, with rho defined as the portion of the cycle
outside of alpha. Bouts were calculated using default settings. Data was excluded
from mice that failed to run on wheels for two consecutive days.
Western blots. A single block of hypothalamus containing the SCN (B2 mm) was
harvested at the indicated time points from mice (2- to 3-months old). Four
micrograms solubilized protein from individual SCNs were loaded per lane.
Densitometry of BK doublet band (1 mg ml � 1 L6/60 mouse monoclonal a-BK
antibody, Neuromab; University of California, Davis, CA, USA) to DM1a
anti-tubulin (1:75,000; Sigma T-9026) was performed as described previously23 and
presented as a proportion of ZT20. Three independent circadian cycle tissue
harvests were performed for each condition.
For immunoprecipitation, individual SCNs (B50 mg of protein) were pre-
cleared by incubation with 20 ml TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads (Rockland
Immunochemicals; Limerick, PA, USA) for 2 h at 4 �C (ref. 18). Protein samples
were centrifuged at 13,200 r.p.m. for 30 min to precipitate the beads. Supernatant
was collected and mixed with 1 mg of anti-BK a subunit antibody (anti-KCa1.1,
#1184–1200, Alamone Labs; Jerusalem, Israel) and rotated for 2 h at 4 �C. 50 ml
TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads were added, and the mixture was rotated overnight
at 4 �C, centrifuged at 13,200 r.p.m. for 30 min to precipitate beads, and the
supernatant was discarded. Beads were washed three times and resuspended in
20 ml lysis buffer. Protein was run on a western blot as detailed previously and
probed with 1 mg ml � 1 anti-BK (L6/60; Antibodies Incorporated; Davis, CA, USA);
1:75,000 anti-a-Tubulin (DM1a; Sigma; St Louis, MO, USA); or 1 mg ml � 1 anti-b2
(N53/32; Antibodies Incorporated; Davis, CA, USA). Full size images for western
blots are presented in Supplementary Figs 3 and 4.
Acute SCN slice preparation. Mice were sacrificed in the light, at zeitgeber time
(ZT) ZT0–2 (day time points) or ZT11–12 (night) from 3- to 6-week-old mice.
Brains were rapidly removed and placed into ice-cold sucrose-substituted saline
containing the following (in mM): 1.2 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 Na2HPO4, 3.5
KCl, 3.8 MgCl2, 10 glucose and 200 sucrose. Coronal slices were cut at 300 mm on a
VT1000S vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at 3–4 �C. Slices
containing SCN were recovered for 1–3 h (day) and 17–19 h (night) at 25 �C
submerged in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mM: 125 NaCl, 1.2
MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 Na2HPO4, 3.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2 and 10 glucose).
Slices containing SCN were transferred to the recording chamber
(RC26GLP/PM-1; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA) with gravity flow bath
perfusion of 1–2 ml min � 1 oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 25 �C.
Neurons were visualized with a Luca-R DL-604 EMCCD camera (Andor, Belfast,
UK) under IR-DIC illumination on an FN1 upright microscope (Nikon, Melville,
NY, USA). Recordings were made from cells in the centre of the SCN. Current- and
voltage-clamp recordings were made with a Multiclamp 200B or 700B amplifier
and pCLAMP v10 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Data were
acquired at a 20 or 100 kHz sampling rate. Drugs were delivered to the bath by a
computer-controlled pressurized perfusion system (ValveLink 8.2; Automate
Scientific, Berkeley, CA, USA) at the concentrations indicated from 1,000 � stocks.
Recording windows were at the peak (ZT4-8) and nadir (ZT17-21) of the circadian
rhythm in spontaneous action potential firing, corresponding to the ‘day’ and
‘night’ time points, respectively. Although the action potential frequencies in this
study were lower than our previous studies performed at 35� (refs 22,23), the
day–night difference in firing frequency in this study is preserved (Fig. 4a,c). All
recordings were made with synaptic transmission intact, unless indicated
(Tetrodotoxin was applied for all Vm and Ri measurements, as well as the
subthreshold BK currents in Fig. 5). Reported N’s are the number of neurons, and
data for each condition was derived from 5 to 15 slices (1–6 neuronal recordings
per slice).
SCN electrophysiology. SCN neurons were recorded in whole-cell configuration,
first in current-clamp mode to collect action potential data, then switched into
voltage clamp mode to obtain macroscopic voltage-activated outward K þ currents.
Electrodes (4–7 MO) were filled with internal solution, in mM: 123 K-methane-
sulfonate, 9 NaCl, 0.9 EGTA, 9 HEPES, 14 Tris-phosphocreatine, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3
Tris-GTP, and 2 Na2-ATP, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The electrode solution
was adjusted to 305 mosM with glucose, and bath osmolarity was 300 mosM. This
internal solution supports BK current activation and spontaneous firing23,49. After
GO seal and whole-cell break-in, membrane properties were elicited from a
þ 20 mV voltage step from a holding potential (Vh) of � 90 mV. Access resistance
was verified to beo25 MO witho±5% change at the end of the recording (on
average B15 MO). Series resistance was compensated at 80%.
For action potentials, data were acquired in 10 s sweeps and filtered at 10 kHz.
Frequency was calculated as the average of each sweep. Baseline potential was
determined as the average inter-spike potential in the presence of spontaneous
activity. Template-based action potential analysis was performed in Clampfit 10
(Molecular Devices) to obtain action potential peak and half-width (t1/2) values.
Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) peak was determined as the peak negative value of
the action potential, and AHP amplitude was the baseline membrane potential
minus the AHP peak value. Threshold analysis was performed by taking the
derivative of each action potential event in the 10 s segment to determine the
inflection in the voltage trajectory (Clampfit). This method gives a set of values
per neuron with lower standard deviation than automated analysis using dV/dt
of 4–5 V s � 1 (ref. 49). Action potential analysis was performed blind with respect
to genotype or time point.
In voltage-clamp mode, total voltage-activated K þ currents were elicited from a
holding potential of � 90 mV, stepping from � 110 to þ 90 mV for either 30 or
150 ms in 20 mV increments. BK currents were isolated by focal application of
the BK antagonist paxilline (10 mM), and subtracting currents after paxilline from
the initial current. The effective concentration of paxilline in the recoding
chamber was 3.75 mM. Currents were averaged from three to five voltage families.
Current–voltage (I–V) relationships were constructed from the current level at
30 ms from each potential, unless noted otherwise (peak or steady-state values).
Current density values were obtained by normalizing to cell capacitance, which did
not differ between day and night (7.0±0.5 and 6.8±0.4 pF, respectively) or
between WT and b2 KO (7.7±0.7 and 7.1±0.4 pF, n ¼ 27, 20, respectively).
Voltage values were adjusted for the liquid junction potential of 10 mV. tinact values
were calculated from single exponential fits of the macroscopic current decay from
the þ 90 mV step for 150 ms (Clampfit, Molecular Devices). BKi and BKs currents
were categorized as described using the current ratio at 30 ms from þ 90 mV step
(BKio0.07, BKs40.07), corresponding to tinact valueso110 ms.
For passive membrane properties, whole-cell recordings were performed as
above using the same internal solution as for current- and voltage-clamp recording,
with tetrodotoxin (1 mM) in the bath. After break in, the membrane potential was
recorded, followed by current injection steps (0 to � 25 pA, in 5 pA increments).
Input resistance was calculated as the linear slope of the voltage. For experiments
where currents were categorized as BKs or BKi, cells were switched to voltage-
clamp mode after recording Vm and Ri, and BK currents were isolated and tinact
values were obtained as described in the previous section.

 For BKi and BKs recordings of Vm, Ri, subthreshold SCN BK currents, and BK
currents evoked by action potential commands, recordings were performed in
1 mM tetrodotoxin. After recording Vm and Ri as described above, cells were
switched to voltage-clamp mode and stepped from a holding potential of � 90 to
þ 90 mV for 150 ms to determine BKi and BKs by tinact as described previously.
After holding at � 150 mV for 100 ms, cells were stepped from � 60 to � 30 mV
(in 5 mV increments), and then stepped back to � 150 mV for 100 ms followed by
action potential commands. Previously acquired native action potential waveform
was obtained from daytime or night time SCN recordings. For day (Fig. 10c) and
night (Supplementary Fig. 7), the action potential parameters are indicated in the
figure legends. Three sequenced action potentials were applied at the average BKi
daytime firing rate (2.25 Hz) or night time BKs firing rate (1 Hz) as depicted in the
figures. Current–voltage relationships were plotted, and the action potential-evoked
peak and subthreshold currents were normalized to the cell capacitance.
Drugs and b2N peptides. Paxilline and tetrodotoxin (Tocris, Bristol, UK) were
prepared as 1,000 � stocks in DMSO and water, respectively. b2N, was synthesized
as the first 45 amino acids of the b2 subunit (MFIWTSGRTSSSYRQDEKR-
NIYQKIRDHDLLDKRKTVTALKAGED) (GenScript, Piscatawa, NJ, USA)41.
b2NDFIW was a 42 amino acid peptide with the underlined FIW deletion.
Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in intracellular solution as 100 � stocks
and added at the final indicated concentrations.
HEK cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. HEK293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA) were transfected with the BKSRKR a subunit cDNA (Genbank accession
#JX46275), with or without b2 (ref. 34), both in pcDNA3.1. DNA was transfected at
1 mg (a only) or 1 mg a and 1.7mg b2 per 35mm dish using TransIT (Mirus Bio,
Madison, WI, USA). Cells were plated on glass coverslips 3–5h later and recorded
from 20 to 30h after transfection. Patch-clamp recording was performed using the
voltage-clamp mode in the inside-out patch configuration using thin-walled bor-
osilicate pipettes with resistances of 2–5 MO as described previously60. Recordings
were made at room temperature, and the data were acquired at 50kHz and filtered at
10kHz. The bath (intracellular) solution was composed of (mM): 140 KMeSO3, 2
KCl, 20 HEPES and 5 HEDTA. Free [Ca2 þ]i was calculated using Webmax C
Standard software61, to a final concentration of 50 mM (from 1 M CaCl2 stock). The
pipette (extracellular) solution consisted of (mM): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1
MgCl2 and 10 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. Cells were held at
� 150mV, followed by a maximally activating test step to þ 150 mV for 150 ms.
Data were collected only from patches with o0.7 fractional current (Ipeak/Iss). BK
currents were elicited from patches using the voltage protocols indicated in the
figures. Single-exponential functions were fit to the macroscopic current decay at
þ 90mV.
For activation of BK currents by action potential commands (Supplementary
Fig. 8e), the daytime action potential waveform (as in Fig. 10c) was applied after
the standard voltage protocol in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode. The pipette
(intracellular) and bath (extracellular) solution were the same as used in the SCN
whole recordings above. The action potential-evoked peak current, or the
subthreshold current, was normalized to the maximal current elicited from each
patch.
Statistics. The number of neurons (BK current and action potential recordings),
the number of mice (circadian behaviour) or the number of SCN slice cultures
(multielectrode array recordings) are represented as n. Group sample sizes were
determined based on power calculations using effect sizes estimated from previous
experiments. Behavioural comparisons were performed as comparisons between
WT and b2 KO, or WT and b4 KO, using an unpaired Student’s t-test. One-way
ANOVAs were used for comparisons with more than two conditions, and the
P values reported in the text are the Bonferroni post hoc tests only for comparisons
where the main effect was Po0.05. Factorial ANOVA was used for comparing
multiple conditions across voltages, with Bonferroni post hoc P values for specific
comparisons reported in the text. Categorical data (number of rhythmic versus
arrhythmic recordings, or BKi versus BKs) were compared with Fisher’s exact test,
with the Fisher’s P value reported in the text. Statistical tests were run in Origin
(Originlabs, Northampton, MA, USA). All values are presented as mean±s.e.m.
