Abstract
Background—Injury to the ipsilateral graft used for reconstruction of the anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) or a new injury to the contralateral ACL are disastrous outcomes after successful 
ACL reconstruction (ACLR), rehabilitation, and return to activity. Studies reporting ACL reinjury 
rates in younger active populations are emerging in the literature, but these data have not yet been 
comprehensively synthesized.
Purpose—To provide a current review of the literature to evaluate age and activity level as the 
primary risk factors in reinjury after ACLR.
Study Design—Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods—A systematic review of the literature was conducted via searches in PubMed (1966 to 
July 2015) and EBSCO host (CINAHL, Medline, SPORTDiscus [1987 to July 2015]). After the 
search and consultation with experts and rating of study quality, 19 articles met inclusion for 
review and aggregation. Population demographic data and total reinjury (ipsilateral and 
contralateral) rate data were recorded from each individual study and combined using random-
effects meta-analyses. Separate meta-analyses were conducted for the total population data as well 
as the following subsets: young age, return to sport, and young age + return to sport.
Results—Overall, the total second ACL reinjury rate was 15%, with an ipsilateral reinjury rate of 
7% and contralateral injury rate of 8%. The secondary ACL injury rate (ipsilateral + contralateral)

 for patients younger than 25 years was 21%. The secondary ACL injury rate for athletes who 
return to a sport was also 20%. Combining these risk factors, athletes younger than 25 years who 
return to sport have a secondary ACL injury rate of 23%.
Conclusion—This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that younger age and a 
return to high level of activity are salient factors associated with secondary ACL injury. These 
combined data indicate that nearly 1 in 4 young athletic patients who sustain an ACL injury and 
return to high-risk sport will go on to sustain another ACL injury at some point in their career, and 
they will likely sustain it early in the return-to-play period. The high rate of secondary injury in 
young athletes who return to sport after ACLR equates to a 30 to 40 times greater risk of an ACL 
injury compared with uninjured adolescents. These data indicate that activity modification, 
improved rehabilitation and return-to-play guidelines, and the use of integrative neuromuscular 
training may help athletes more safely reintegrate into sport and reduce second injury in this at-
risk population.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments of the 
knee.59 The incidence of ACL injuries in the United States is currently estimated to be 
between 100,000 and 200,000 annually.2 Athletes who injure their ACL often miss extended 
periods of participation in sport, with potential consequences including lost scholarship 
earnings and long-term disability, especially in the form of osteoarthritis.8 ACL injuries are 
also a burden on the health care system, with annual costs exceeding US$625 million.15,16,20
The ACL injury rate is highest in younger athletes who participate in high-risk sports that 
involve cutting and pivoting, such as basketball, football, skiing, and soccer.3,7 Common risk 
factors for ACL injuries include female sex and young age (especially in adolescents).4 
Complete ACL ruptures are usually season-ending injuries resulting in the need for operative 
reconstruction. It is widely accepted that ACL reconstruction (ACLR) of the young active 
adult (18-35 years) should be pursued to reduce knee laxity, episodes of instability, and the 
incidence of subsequent injuries, including meniscal tears.59
Numerous factors affect a good outcome after ACLR such as surgical technique, graft 
choice, graft fixation, postoperative rehabilitation, and patient education. Unfortunately, 
graft failure and contralateral ACL rupture can still occur even after successful ACLR. Graft 
failure rates after ACLR range from 3% up to 25% in some populations.10 The causes of 
graft failure and contralateral ACL rupture are not clear, but research suggests that they may 
include a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because these complications 
are less frequent compared with initial ACL rupture, current literature discussing graft 
failure and contralateral ACL injury after primary ACL injury is limited. As the frequency of 
ACL injuries and surgical interventions increases, more thorough clinical information is 
being deposited into databases to track these complications. These data and the studies 
arising from them form the basis for this systematic review, which provides an analysis of 
the current literature that assesses the risk factors of age and activity level after ACLR with 
regard to secondary ACL injury. We hypothesized that young age and return to sport would

 be proxies for increased second ACL injury risk. By synthesizing existing literature, this 
review may help to better understand outcomes after ACLR and reduce the prevalence of 
second ACL injuries.
Methods
The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
guidelines were followed when conducting and reporting this review and meta-analysis.
Literature Search
An independent information specialist was consulted during the design phase of the search 
process. The electronic search engines PubMed (1966 to July 2015) and EBSCO host 
(CINAHL, Medline, SPORTDiscus [1987 to July 2015]) were used to search the following 
keywords in both databases (acl and anterior cruciate ligament were searched for each 
phrase): acl reconstruction return to sport, acl reconstruction outcomes, acl risk factors, 
revision acl risk factors, contralateral acl risk factors, and age acl risk factors. This yielded 
7098 abstracts for initial review after duplicates were removed. The full text of an article 
was obtained if the title or abstract discussed age and/or activity level as a risk factor for 
recurrent or contralateral ACL rupture. Articles that were not written in English were not 
considered in this review. Articles that did not specifically discuss rerupture and/or 
contralateral rupture rates in relation to age and/or activity level were excluded. Specifically, 
to be included, ACL injuries needed to be stratified into statistically comparable age groups, 
or the activity level/sport played at the time of reinjury needed to be reported.
A total of 71 articles were obtained and read in their entirety, of which 53 were excluded 
because they did not break down reinjury risk factors into age and/or activity level 
categories. In addition to the electronic searches, experts in the field were contacted for 
further article suggestions and to attempt to identify pertinent unpublished studies. 
Corresponding authors of articles were contacted for additional information as needed. 
References from the included articles were also reviewed to ensure all articles meeting 
inclusion criteria were identified. Supplementary references from the American Association 
of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines, Management of Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
Injuries, were also reviewed. At the conclusion of the search, 19 articles met the inclusion 
criteria (18 from the initial electronic search and 1 identified via a journal email alert after 
the initial search) and were included in this review of the literature. A summary of the 
literature search process can be seen in Figure 1.
Assessment of Study Quality
The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and a modified Downs and Black11 
checklist were used to measure the methodological quality of the included studies. The 
PEDro scale is used to rate the methodological quality of randomized control trials, while 
the modified Downs and Black checklist is appropriate for rating nonrandomized studies. 
The PEDro scale consists of 11 items, 10 of which assess the internal validity of a study and 
are scored by allocating a point to each criteria that is met (see Table 1 for item categories). 
The Downs and Black checklist was modified to include only criteria that were relevant to 
Wiggins et al.

 assessing potential sources of bias in the included studies (see Table 2). This led to a 
checklist of 11 items. The more items that are satisfied, the less risk of bias in the study. 
Each study was independently assessed by 2 authors, and any disagreements were resolved 
by arbitration and consensus. The results of these assessments are shown in Tables 1 and 2. 
The mean PEDro score was 2.8 (range, 2-4), and for the modified Downs and Black 
checklist, the mean number of items rated was 8.8 (range, 7-10). The scores on the PEDro 
scale were low relative to the maximum possible total score of 10 because of the 
nonrandomized nature of the included studies. From the Downs and Black checklist, studies 
mostly did not indicate whether the included subjects were representative of the population, 
and only 1 study performed a power calculation.
Level of Evidence Method
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine level of evidence was used to rate each study. The 
level of evidence assesses research design quality. Levels of evidence for each study can be 
seen in Table 1.
Data Extraction
The population size and number of participants were recorded from each study. The primary 
variables extracted were the ipsilateral ACL reinjury rates, contralateral ACL injury rates (if 
reported), and total secondary ACL injury (if reported) rates. If reinjury rates were reported 
for a specific patient age range or patients who returned to play in sports, the rates for these 
subgroups were separately recorded. The specific type of sport (soccer, rugby, football, etc) 
and the nature of the sport (high-risk jumping/cutting vs low-risk) were also extracted. One 
author (A.J.W.) recorded all of the pertinent data from the included articles, and 2 other 
authors (D.K.S. and K.E.W.) independently reviewed these data for accuracy and 
completeness. When mean age data were not reported, corresponding authors were 
contacted via email in an attempt to collect this information; however, no additional data 
were gained from these efforts.
Reinjury rate data were analyzed using a random-effects proportion meta-analysis (weighted 
for individual study size) using StatsDirect. Reinjury proportions for individual studies and 
pooled estimates were summarized in forest plots for the total study population as well as 
the following subgroups: young age, return to sport, and young age + return to sport. Data 
were combined ensuring that data from the same participants were not included twice. If 
data were reported for the same participants in more than 1 article, data were extracted from 
the article with the greatest number of participants. This resulted in data being pooled from 
Paterno et al (2014)51 but not Paterno et al (2012),50 and Bourke et al5 and Salmon et al53 
were excluded if Bourke et al6 was used. Similarly, 3 studies2,3,14 analyzed data from the 
Swedish National Anterior Cruciate Ligament Register. For calculations, the one study with 
the largest sample size of this group was used; The study by Fältström et al14 was used in 
calculating pooled estimates for the whole population for total reinjury, ipsilateral reinjury, 
and contralateral reinjury. The study by Fältström et al14 was also used to calculate pooled 
estimates of total reinjury and contralateral injury in the young age group, while the study by 
Andernord et al3 was used to calculate ipsilateral reinjury in the young age group. Only 1 
study24 used data from the Multi-center Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) group

 database, so this study was included in all calculations for which it qualified. If a study 
performed survival analysis, the percentage of surviving ACLs was multiplied by the 
number of patients within a respective group to calculate injury incidence.
Summaries of Included Studies
Ahldén et al—Ahldén et al2 published data from the Swedish National Anterior Cruciate 
Ligament Register on patients (N = 16,351; average age, 25.3 years [primary ACLR], 26.2 
years [revision ACLR]) 5 years after ACLR. Outcome variables for this study included both 
ipsilateral revision ACLR and contralateral ACLR. The overall revision/reconstruction rate 
calculated from patients who underwent index ACLR during 2005 only was 9.1% for all 
ages (contralateral ACLR, 5.0%; revision ACLR, 4.1%). The highest ACL reinjury rates 
were for soccer players 15 to 18 years old, for whom the overall revision/reconstruction rate 
was 16.7% (revision ACLR rate, 9.1%; contralateral ACLR rate, 7.6%). Female soccer 
players aged 15 to 18 years had an overall revision/reconstruction rate of 22.0% (revision 
ACLR rate, 11.8%; contralateral ACLR rate, 10.2%), whereas the rate for male soccer 
players of the same age was a significantly lower 9.8% (revision ACLR rate, 5.4%; 
contralateral ACLR, 4.4%) (P = .02). The authors did not report injury incidence data on the 
15-to 18-year age group as a whole. Therefore, comparisons of reinjury rates among young 
patients who returned to different sports were not made.
Andernord et al—Andernord et al3 also published a prospective cohort study (N = 16,930; 
9767 males, 7163 females) using data from the Swedish National Knee Ligament Register, 
which examined the association between common patient factors and the risk of revision 
ACLR over a 2-year period. Contralateral ACL ruptures were not included. The overall 
revision ACLR rate was reported as 1.8%. Age was a significant risk factor for revision. 
Adolescents (age at initial ACL injury, 13-19 years) had a 3.5% incidence of revision, with 
an increased relative risk of 2.67 and 2.25 for males (P < .001) and females (P < .001), 
respectively. Results also demonstrated that athletes who returned to soccer had an increased 
risk of ACL reinjury, with the relative risk for males and females being 1.58 (P < .001) and 
1.43 (P < .001). The revision rates for males and females aged 13 to 19 years who played 
soccer were 4.3% and 4.6%. This was almost 3 times higher than the risk for ACL revision 
in the total study population. Combining the risk factors of age and activity level further 
increased the risk for ACL revision surgery within the subset of subjects aged 13 to 19 at the 
time of index ACLR who returned to soccer (male relative risk [RR] = 2.87, P < .001; 
female RR = 2.59, P < .001). As the register records only patients who undergo revision 
ACLR, the reported rates may be conservative as they do not consider those who may have 
suffered a graft rupture but choose activity modification/nonoperative management over 
surgical treatment.
Borchers et al—Borchers et al4 published a case-control study (N = 322; average age, 
27.9 years) from single-surgeon MOON group data with 2-year follow-up. Of the 322 
reconstructions, 21 patients had graft failure at the 2-year follow-up (failure rate, 6.5%). 
Those with a higher activity level (Marx activity score ≥13) had a 5.53 greater odds of 
reinjury than did those with a lower activity level at the time of graft failure (95% CI, 
1.18-28.61; P = .03). Investigators also found that patients who underwent allograft ACLR

 had a 5.56 greater odds of graft failure than those receiving a soft tissue autograft (95% CI, 
1.55-19.98; P = .009). On the basis of stratum-specific odds ratio calculations, the authors 
theorized that high activity levels and allograft use may have a multiplicative effect on ACL 
graft failure.
Bourke et al (2012a)—Bourke et al6 published a 15-year follow-up (average time after 
ACLR, 16.8 years) to a single-surgeon case series (N = 673; average age, 29 years). This 
study population included the cohorts from Bourke et al5 and Salmon et al,53 respectively. 
Activity levels were measured using the International Knee Documentation Committee 
(IKDC) scale.22 The combined ACL reinjury rate was reported as 23% (170/673); 75 
patients (11.1%) sustained a graft rupture, and 95 patients (14.1%) sustained a contralateral 
ACL rupture (as this adds to 25.2%, it may be that some patients in the study sustained both 
graft failure and contralateral ACL rupture). The data suggested that the risk for contralateral 
ACL injury may peak later than graft rupture, as contralateral injuries occurred at a rate of 
2.4% within 2 years after ACLR compared with a rate of 5% for ipsilateral reinjuries in the 
same period. Those who returned to their preinjury sport after ACLR had a secondary ACL 
injury rate of 26.0% (11.0% ipsilateral, 15.0% contralateral) and an increased hazard ratio 
(HR) for contralateral ACL injury (HR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.4; P = .003). In addition, those 
who were aged <18 years at the time of primary ACLR were more likely to experience a 
contralateral ACL injury (HR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.3; P = .011). Graft rupture was not found 
to be associated with return to preinjury sport.
Bourke et al (2012b)—Bourke et al5 reported a single-surgeon case series (N = 186; 
average age at primary ACLR, 25.8 years) with 15-year follow-up to examine long-term 
outcomes after primary hamstring ACLR for patients who had isolated ACL injuries. This 
population was a smaller subset of the cohort reported on in the above Bourke et al6 study. 
The secondary ACL injury rate for all ages was 27.4%, with ipsilateral graft failure at 17.7% 
(33/186; 1.1% per year) and contralateral ACL rupture at 9.7%. Patients aged ≤18 years at 
initial ACLR experienced ipsilateral graft failure at a rate of 34.2% (13/38) compared with 
patients aged >18 years at ACLR, who had a 13.5% (20/148) failure rate (HR = 3.0; 95% CI, 
1.5-6.0; P = .002). According to a multivariate Cox regression analysis, patients ≤18 years at 
the time of surgery were more than 3 times more likely to rerupture their graft when 
compared with patients >18 years (P = .03). A closer look at the mechanism of reinjury 
revealed that 14 of the 33 patients (42.4%) with ipsilateral ACL rerupture were participating 
in cutting/pivoting sports at the time of reinjury.
Ellis et al—Ellis et al12 published a retrospective comparative study (N = 79) that 
examined the rate of revision ACLR in a patient population aged younger than 18 years. 
Contralateral ACL injuries after primary ACLR were not reported. The study showed an 
ipsilateral ACL revision rate of 11%. The most common cause of graft failure was during 
sporting activity 12 months or less from initial surgery (77%). “Pivoting, landing, or 
twisting” was the most frequent type of mechanism (44%). The level of sporting activity for 
all patients was not reported. Twelve percent of patients were unable to be contacted at the 
time of follow-up, which may underestimate the true revision rate.

 Fältström et al—Fältström et al14 published data from the Swedish National Anterior 
Cruciate Ligament Register (N = 20,824; average age, 26.7 years) to determine predictors 
for additional ACLR (both graft revision and contralateral ACLR). The duration of patient 
follow-up ranged from 6 to 104 months. The rates of revision ACLR and contralateral 
ACLR for all age groups were 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively, with a secondary rate of ACL 
injury of 6.2%. However, a 4-fold (HR = 4.26) increase in ipsilateral revision ACLR and 
contralateral ACLR in patients <16 years old at the time of their index injury relative to 
those >35 years old was also reported. This group's rate of secondary ACL injury was 
12.6%, with ipsilateral reinjury at 6.0% and contralateral ACL injury at 6.5%. Patients aged 
16 to 25 years had a 3-fold increase in ACL reinjury (4.6% ipsilateral revision ACLR rate, 
3.6% contralateral ACLR rate, 8.2% total). It was also noted that playing soccer at the time 
of initial ACL injury significantly increased the patients' risk of sustaining a further ACL 
injury in the future relative to other sports/causes (P = .023). The authors used revision 
ACLR as a primary endpoint as opposed to ACL graft failure, which may underestimate the 
risk of ipsilateral reinjury.
Kaeding et al—Kaeding et al23 performed a prospective cohort study using both single-
surgeon data (n = 281) and consortium data (n = 691) obtained from MOON at 2-year 
follow-up. Revision ACLR was used as an outcome measure. Single-surgeon data were used 
to develop a multi-variable regression model, which was then applied to data collected from 
a consortium of surgeons. Combined data (average age, 26.6 years) will be reported here as 
it may be more generalizable and better representative of global trends in reinjury after 
ACLR. In total, 4.9% (45/926) of patients experienced ipsilateral graft failure after ACLR. 
Contralateral injury was not measured. The greatest percentage (37.5%) of these injuries 
occurred in patients in the 10- to 19-year age group. Patients in the 10- to 19-year age group 
had an 8.2% failure rate. Those in the 20-to 29-year age bracket reported a 4% failure rate, 
30 to 39 years had a 1.8% rate, and 40 to 49 years had a 1.7% rate.
Kamath et al—Kamath et al25 published a case series of Division I National Collegiate 
Athletic Association athletes (N = 89) who underwent ACLR before matriculating to college 
(n = 35) and after matriculation (n = 54). All athletes returned to play (RTP), defined in the 
study as a “successful return to a varsity roster after ACLR.” Athletes who had 
reconstructive surgery before attending college had a high secondary ACL injury rate of 
37.1% (13/35), with a 17.2% (6/35) ipsilateral rerupture rate and a 20% (7/35) contralateral 
rupture rate. Athletes who underwent ACLR during college had a 1.9% (1/54) ipsilateral 
reinjury rate and an 11.1% (6/54) contralateral rupture rate, for a total reinjury rate of 13.0% 
(7/54) in this cohort. Combining these 2 subsets, the entire cohort had a total reinjury rate of 
22.5% (20/89), with a 7.9% (7/89) ipsilateral rerupture rate and a 14.6% (13/89) 
contralateral rupture rate. The authors concluded that high levels of ipsilateral and 
contralateral ACL ruptures are seen in those who return to a high level of activity, and an 
even higher rate is seen among younger patients who return to a high level of activity.
Kamien et al—Kamien et al26 published a cohort study (N = 98; average age, 28.0 years) 
in which they followed patients for 2 years after ACLR with a single surgeon. Contralateral 
ACL injuries were not considered. Investigators found a total population ipsilateral ACL

 reinjury rate of 15.3% (15/98). Patients aged <25 years failed at a significantly greater rate, 
25% (12/48), compared with 6% (3/50, P = .011) in those aged .25 years.
Laboute et al—Laboute et al28 reported a case series of patients (N = 298; average age, 
26.2 years) followed for 4 years after ACLR. Subjects underwent ACLR performed by 48 
French surgeons using either patellar tendon or hamstring tendon autografts. Data on 
contralateral reinjury were not reported in this study. Using results from a questionnaire, 
investigators found 26 reruptures (failure rate, 8.7%). The highest rate of rerupture was 
found in patients returning to soccer, 20.8%, compared with rugby, 6.4% (P = .03). Sports 
categorized as “pivoting” accounted for 25 (96%) of the reinjuries, while “pivoting with 
contact” occurred in 19 (73%). A nonsignificant trend toward increased reinjury was noted 
with increasing competitive levels; 8.1% regional level, 10.4% national level, 12.5% 
international level. Interestingly, 11 patients were advised to try less risky sports (ie, 
“pivoting with no contact,” “weightbearing with no pivoting,” and “nonweightbearing”). 
None of these 11 patients sustained a reinjury. This study was limited by a poor 
questionnaire response rate (55.1%).
Lind et al—Lind et al32 published a cohort study (N = 12,193) using data from the Danish 
ACLR registry, which examined the rate of revision ACLR and its relationship with patient 
age. Contralateral ACL injuries were not reported. The cohort showed an overall ipsilateral 
reinjury rate of 4.7%. The most common cause of graft failure was “new trauma” (38%), of 
which “sport” was the most frequent type (83% of new trauma). Patients <20 years old had a 
significantly higher revision rate (8.7%) than those >20 years old (2.8%; adjusted RR, 2.58; 
95% CI, 2.02-3.30). In addition, functional activity (measured by the Tegner score) was 
significantly lower 1 year after revision ACLR when compared with primary ACLR. Like 
the Swedish registry, the Norwegian registry records only revision surgery data, which may 
underestimate the true revision rate.
Magnussen et al—Magnussen et al34 followed a cohort of patients (N = 256; average age, 
25.0 years) who underwent an ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts for an average of 14 
months (range, 6-47 months) to evaluate patient age as a predictor for revision ACLR. 
Contralateral ACLR data were not collected. An overall ipsilateral ACL reinjury rate of 
7.0% (18/256 patients) was reported, but a much higher reinjury rate was seen when only the 
younger patients were analyzed. Specifically, for patients <20 years old, the rate was 14.3% 
(17/119), compared with only 0.7% (1/158; P < .0001) in patients >20 years old. The 
authors noted that 11 of the 18 failures were in competitive athletes, and the remaining 7 
were in recreational athletes. Unfortunately, there was no information about the sports 
patients returned to after surgery.
Paterno et al (2012)—Paterno et al50 published their data from a prospective case-control 
study (N = 102; 63 cases, 39 controls; average age of cases, 16.3 years). Subjects were 
followed for injury surveillance for 12 months after initial testing at the time of RTP. Athlete 
exposure (AE; defined as “participation in a game or practice session in a pivoting or cutting 
sport within their individual or team sport”) and injury data were recorded. Contact ACL 
injuries were excluded from the study. It should be noted that by including only athletes who

 returned to high-risk sports, injury rates may be elevated compared with studies that do not 
use this criterion. The secondary ACL injury rate within 12 months of RTP in subjects with 
prior ACLR was 25.4% (16/63), with 6.3% (4/63) reinjuring the ipsilateral knee and 19.0% 
(12/63) sustaining a contralateral ACL rupture (P = .08-.09). Compared with the control 
group (1/39 ACL rupture), those who sustained an initial ACL injury and underwent ACLR 
were 15 times more likely (RR = 15.24, P = .0002) to go on to an additional ACL injury. 
The authors also reported that females with prior ACLR were 16 times more likely to suffer 
an ACL injury relative to controls (RR = 16.02; P = .0002) and 4 times more likely than 
males with prior ACLR to reinjure their ACL (RR = 3.65; P = .05).
Paterno et al (2014)—Paterno et al51 conducted a cohort study in which subjects who had 
undergone ACLR and returned to a cutting/pivoting sport (n = 78; average age, 17.1 years) 
and healthy control subjects (n = 47; average age, 17.2 years) were followed for 2 years. 
This study included 63 patients from the 2012 study published by Paterno et al,50 meaning 
that an additional 15 patients were added to that cohort for this study. Exclusion/inclusion 
criteria were the same as the aforementioned study. Injury and AE data were recorded, and 
incidence rates were calculated for both ipsilateral and contralateral ACL injuries. Of the 
subjects with a previous ACL injury and ACLR, 29.5% (23/78) sustained a second injury, 
with 7 (9.0%) subjects injuring the ipsilateral graft and 16 (20.5%) subjects injuring the 
contralateral ACL. As 12 of 63 patients in the 2012 study reinjured their ACL, this means 
that an extremely high number of the new patients added to this cohort were reinjured (9/15, 
60%). Overall, ACL injury was 5.71 times more likely in those previously injured than in 
controls (RR = 5.71, P = .0003) Also, females with prior injury and ACLR sustained new 
injuries at a much greater rate than female controls (RR = 4.51, P = .0003). There was no 
such relationship found in the male subjects studied. Females were found to have a greater 
number of contralateral ACL injuries (n = 14) than their male counterparts (n = 2). 
Investigators also found that 30.4% of second injuries occurred at <20 AEs and 52.2% at 
<72 AEs, showing a trend toward reinjury early in the RTP period. Once again, it should be 
noted that the study included only those who returned to activity in high-risk cutting/
pivoting sports, which may explain that relatively high rates of graft failure and contralateral 
injury.
Reid et al—Reid et al52 published a single-center retrospective case series (N = 100) of 
adolescents younger than 16 years who underwent ACLR. They examined the rate of 
ipsilateral graft failure after ACLR, contralateral ACL rupture, and functional outcomes 4 
years after ACLR (1-9 years). The study showed a secondary ACL injury rate of 11%. Nine 
percent sustained an ipsilateral ACL reinjury, while 2% sustained a contralateral ACL injury. 
The most common cause of graft failure or mechanism for new contralateral injury was not 
mentioned. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) questionnaire was 
used to assess the patient's functional outcome after surgery. Eighty of the 100 patients 
completed the KOOS, and results demonstrated restriction in sports and recreation with a 
mean ± SD score of 54 ± 17.6 (100 = no problem, 0 = extreme problem). The other 4 key 
KOOS domains were 60 ± 13 for symptoms, 65 ± 10 for pain, 70 ± 6.4 for activities of daily 
living, and 47.2 ± 20.1 for quality of life. These data indicate that 4 years after ACL 
reconstruction, many of the patients had not yet returned to a fully functional state.

 Therefore, their reinjury rates cannot be extrapolated to the younger athletic population that 
does return to high levels of activity.
Salmon et al—Salmon et al53 reported a single-surgeon case series (N = 612; average age, 
28.0 years) that assessed patients who had undergone primary ACLR at 5 years after 
operation via telephone interview. This population was a smaller subset of the cohort 
reported in the above Bourke et al6 study. Both contact and noncontact injuries were 
included in the series. Activity levels to which patients returned were measured via IKDC 
scores. Secondary ACL injury occurred in 71 patients in the population (12.1%), with 39 
patients (6.4%) suffering an ipsilateral ACL graft failure and 35 patients (5.7%) suffering a 
contralateral ACL rupture. In the subset of patients who experienced ipsilateral ACL failure, 
41.0% (16/39) occurred within the first 12 months after ACLR, while contralateral ACL 
ruptures occurred later (P = .001). Those subjects who returned to an IKDC activity level 1 
or 2 had a secondary ACL injury rate of 18.5%, with ipsilateral reinjury and contralateral 
injury rates of 8.0% and 10.5%, respectively. Returning to these higher levels of activity 
significantly increased the odds for contralateral injury by 10-fold compared with those 
classified IKDC level 3 or 4 (1% incidence of contralateral injury). There was also a trend 
toward increased risk of ipsilateral ACL failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.6) with 
high activity level.
Shelbourne et al—Shelbourne et al56 published a cohort study (N = 1415; average age, 
21.6 years) in which patients were followed for 5 years after ACLR. Investigators collected 
data on the incidence of both ipsilateral and contralateral ACL injury, as well as patient age 
and activity levels. Activity level data were recorded at the time of RTP and included the 
specific sports to which patients returned. The overall secondary ACL injury rate was 9.6% 
(136/1415), with 4.3% (61/1415) ipsilateral reinjury rate and 5.3% (75/1415) contralateral 
injury rate. Women were found to sustain a second ACL injury at a higher rate (12.5%, 
69/552) than men (7.8%, 67/863; P = .004). Patients <18 years old also had a greater 
secondary ACL injury rate (17.4%) than patients 18 to 25 years old (6.7%) and >25 years 
old (3.9%; P < .0001). In the subset of patients <18 years old, 8.7% had reinjuries to the 
ipsilateral knee and 8.7% had contralateral injuries. It should be noted that a small number 
(n = 2) of nonathletes were included in the sample.55 Of the second injuries sustained by 
patients <18 years old, 98% occurred during high school– or collegiate-level sports 
competition. Younger athletes also returned to sport participation earlier than patients aged 
18 to 25 years and >25 years (P < .0001), but an early RTP (<6 months) did not result in 
greater rates of either ipsilateral (P = .60) or contralateral ACL injury (P = .91). While the 
mechanism of reinjury was not broken down by age group, more than 80% of all ACL 
reinjuries were sustained while participating in high-risk sports, with 52% occurring while 
playing basketball and 15% during soccer.
Webster et al—Webster et al61 published a single-surgeon case-control study (N = 561, 
average age, 28 years) with an average 5-year follow-up. The main outcome variables 
studied were both ACL graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury. The secondary ACL 
injury rate for ipsilateral graft rupture and contralateral injury was 12%, with 4.5% for 
ipsilateral ACL reinjury and 7.5% contralateral ACL injury. Patients <20 years old at index

 surgery had the highest rate of secondary ACL injury at 29.1% (13.6% ipsilateral, 15.5% 
contralateral). Those <20 years old at surgery were 6 times more likely to sustain an 
ipsilateral ACL injury and 3 times more likely to sustain a contralateral ACL injury 
compared with patients older than 20 years. Activity level was also a significant risk factor 
for reinjury. Athletes who participated in cutting or pivoting sports had a 4-fold increase in 
ipsilateral ACL injury and a 5-fold increase in contralateral ACL rupture. The authors 
concluded that age itself may be a risk factor, or age may be a proxy for other risk factors, 
because of the high rate of return to high-risk sports by younger patients.
Results
The pooled ipsilateral ACL reinjury rate (14 studies) was 7% (95% CI, 5%-8%; I2 = 91%), 
and the pooled contralateral ACL injury rate (7 studies) was 8% (95% CI, 5%-13%; I2 = 
97%) (Figure 2). Taking the 7 studies that report both ipsilateral and contralateral data, the 
pooled secondary ACL injury rate was 15% (95% CI, 10%-22%; I2 = 98%) (Figure 2). As 
can been seen from Table 3, there were large differences in the number of participants 
included between the individual studies. Data from 4 studies were derived from ACL 
registries,2,3,14,32 and in each of these, the end point for failure was revision surgery or 
contralateral ACLR. This was also the case for a further 5 studies,4,12,23,34,52 whereas injury 
data were used to classify graft rupture and contralateral ACL injury in all the other included 
studies. Five studies also included only younger patients.12,25,50-52
Table 4 shows the studies in which secondary ACL injury rates were separately reported for 
a younger cohort (<25 years). The pooled ipsilateral ACL reinjury rate across 11 studies was 
10% (95% CI, 7%-14%; I2 = 94%) (Figure 3). For the 6 studies6,14,51,52,56,61 that reported 
both ipsilateral and contralateral ACL injury data, the pooled secondary ACL injury rate was 
21% (95% CI, 16%-27%; I2 = 86%) in the younger group, with a contralateral injury rate of 
11% (95% CI, 7%-16%; I2 = 87%). Both Paterno et al50,51 and Bourke et al6 showed 
contralateral injury rates to be relatively higher than ipsilateral reinjury, whereas there was 
little difference between these rates in the remaining studies.
All studies that reported ACL injury rates for athletes who returned to sports are shown in 
Table 5. The pooled secondary ACL injury rate (Figure 4) calculated from 6 
studies2,6,25,51,56,61 was 20% (95% CI, 14%-27%; I2 = 92%). Ipsilateral reinjury and 
contralateral injury rates were 8% (95% CI, 6%-11%; I2 = 75%) and 12% (95% CI, 
8%-16%; I2 = 88%), respectively. Along with the Paterno et al studies,50,51 3 more 
studies6,25,53 reported contralateral ACL injury rates equal to or greater than ipsilateral 
reinjury rates.
Table 6 shows studies that report reinjury data from young athletes (<25 years old) who 
return to high-risk sports after ACL injury and reconstruction. For this subgroup, the pooled 
secondary ACL injury rate was 23% (95% CI, 16%-30%; I2 = 79%), with an ipsilateral 
reinjury rate of 10% (95% CI, 8%-12%; I2 = 23%) and a contralateral injury rate of 12% 
(95% CI, 8%-17%; I2 = 76%) (Figure 5). Figure 6 summarizes the total secondary ACL 
injury rates across each of the subgroup meta-analyses.

 Discussion
This systematic review highlights age and activity level as key risk factors in reinjury after 
ACLR. Specifically, patients of younger age (<25 years) and those who return to a high level 
of activity, especially in high-risk cutting/pivoting sports such as soccer, are at increased 
risk. These factors place ACLR patients at a significantly higher risk for both graft rupture 
and contralateral ACL injury when compared with their noninjured counterparts. 
Epidemiological studies have reported primary ACL injury rates of 0.6% and 0.8% in 
populations of adolescents48 and high school basketball players,38 respectively. Comparing 
these rates to the 23% rate of secondary ACL injury calculated in this meta-analysis, young 
athletes who return to sport are at approximately 30 to 40 times greater risk of sustaining an 
ACL injury during sport relative to their uninjured counterparts.
The aggregate pooled rate of repeat ACL injury found in this review is 15% (Figure 2). This 
rate was calculated from 7 studies that provided data on both ipsilateral and contralateral 
injuries. The aggregate pooled contralateral injury rate was 8%. When including the 7 
studies that reported only ipsilateral injuries, the incidence rate of ipsilateral reinjury was 
7%. The total reinjury rate in our review is within the wide spectrum of values found in the 
literature ranging from 3% to 29.5%.27,31,51,62 This wide range is likely due to data that 
include ACL injury in all age ranges, follow-up periods, and activity levels. Studies often 
include athletes who do not RTP, therefore not placing their graft or contralateral extremity 
at increased risk. In addition, studies differ in outcome measures (Table 3), with many using 
graft/native ACL injury, while others collect surgical data on revision or contralateral ACLR. 
Aggregated rates should be interpreted with the understanding that those studies that collect 
data on surgical interventions only may fail to capture a subset of patients who sustain a 
secondary ACL injury but chose nonoperative management such as activity modification 
over surgical management.
Unfortunately, reinjury is not just limited to the operated limb. As shown in Tables 3 to 6 
and Figures 2 to 5, current evidence shows that, on average, rates of contralateral ACL injury 
exceed the rates of ipsilateral graft rupture after ACLR, regardless of age or activity level. 
The causes of contralateral ACL tear are unclear but likely multifactorial. Risk factors for 
bilateral ACL tears have been hypothesized to include notch width, sex, knee alignment, 
and/or genetic predisposition.18,39,57 However, the increased incidence of contralateral 
injury may be due to the persistence of the same risk factors that predispose patients to 
initial injury,21 graft type,31 remaining functional deficits at the time of RTP,54 or altered 
motor patterns that protect the reconstructed knee but increase stress on the contralateral 
limb.13,49 Increased contralateral injury is especially prevalent in females, as highlighted by 
Paterno et al.50,51 Although not specifically addressed in this review, females may be 
particularly at risk for deficits in the uninvolved limb at the time of injury or as a result of 
the development of compensatory mechanisms during rehabilitation. Additional measures 
should be taken during the rehabilitation of this group to address impairments in the 
uninvolved limb after ACLR. More long-term research studies are needed to identify causes 
prospectively. This type of analysis is often not possible in a review such as this.

 Age and Activity Level: Risk Factors for Secondary ACL Injury
The causes of graft failure may include age, high-risk sports participation, incomplete 
healing, and inadequate rehabilitation. Of particular interest is the role of age in graft 
rupture. It is often theorized that younger individuals are more susceptible to ACL injuries 
because there is greater ligament length due to the rapidly developing bones.10 As a result, 
when ACL rupture does occur in the young, athletic patient, surgical treatment of an ACL 
tear is commonly performed to restore knee stability, reducing the risks of subsequent injury 
and the progression of degenerative changes.
Many reports have shown that there is value to ACL reconstruction after the age of 30 to 40 
years.3,23,29 However, the same available literature is not as prevalent for patients aged <20 
to 25 years. An examination of the reviewed studies that reported age-specific injury 
incidence rates (Table 4) reveals that patients <20 to 25 years old experience further ACL 
injury at a greater rate relative to the overall population. While studies that include only 
young athletic populations who return to their previous activity level are rare, registries with 
large data pools are beginning to emerge.2,3,14,27,32,35 These studies are able to analyze 
results by age and activity categories, thus shedding light on those at highest reinjury risk. A 
recent article reporting data from the Kaiser Permanente ACLR registry concluded that age 
had a significant effect on both revision ACLR and contralateral ACLR.35 For each year 
increase in age, a lower risk of revision ACLR (8% per year) and contralateral ACLR (4% 
per year) was noted. Kaeding et al23 found a similar trend in the ipsilateral knee, reporting 
that a given patient is 2.3 times more likely to undergo revision ACLR than a patient who is 
10 years older. Understanding specific patient risk factors is necessary so physicians can 
counsel their patients appropriately on reinjury risk as well as take steps to prevent 
reinjuries.
Paterno et al (2012)50 reviewed incidence rates of reinjury in young, active patients after 
they had returned to sport after ACLR. It is thought that these patients may be at increased 
reinjury risk since they are more likely to return to high-risk activities after ACLR.2,3,25,56,61 
Shelbourne et al56 reported a 92% return to high-risk sports among those <18 years old. 
Similarly, Webster et al61 reported that 88% of patients <20 years old returned to these 
sports. Our examination of return to sport and associated ACL reinjury rates can be found in 
Figures 4 and 5. Aggregated results from our review suggest that patients who return to 
sports have a higher reinjury rate than those who do not.
We found the greatest incidence rate of ACL reinjury (23%) when synthesizing the results 
from studies that analyzed young patients (<20-25 years old) who return to high-risk sports 
(Table 6; Figure 5). Shelbourne et al55,56 included a small subset of subjects who did not 
return to sports within their age-specific results reported here, and therefore, these rates may 
actually be less than the true reinjury rates within this high-risk group. Furthermore, Ahldén 
et al2 reported specific subgroup results on 15- to 18-year-old soccer players only, excluding 
those who returned to other high-risk sports.
As risk related to patient age is not modifiable, we must look for other potentially modifiable 
characteristics within the younger patient population. Laboute et al28 reported that, in a 
subset of 11 patients who were told to try less risky sports (“pivoting with no contact,”

 “weightbearing with no pivoting,” and “nonweightbearing”) after ACLR, no further injuries 
occurred. While statistical comparison was not made between this group and the patients 
who returned to high-risk sports, these data provide insight that activity modification may 
provide a viable strategy for patients to avoid future injury while maintaining some level of 
participation in athletics. This method may have limited use, however, as many patients have 
goals to return to previous levels of play in sports in which they played before injury.
Modifications to RTP guidelines may have great potential to reduce reinjury risk and 
improve performance after ACLR. Even though RTP guidelines exist in the literature, there 
is still no consensus on which is best, and many physicians continue to clear patients based 
on time from surgery or personal experience.47 A number of variations in RTP guidelines 
exist, as evidenced by the studies included in this review. The most widely accepted 
guideline was published in 2009 by the AAOS.1 According to the AAOS, evidence is 
lacking to suggest that RTP be based on a timeline that specifies a wait time between injury/
surgery and returning to normal, functional activity. The guideline makes the same statement 
regarding the use of functional goals to be met before RTP. However, support has grown 
recently for the latter approach of achieving certain levels of functional criteria before return 
to full activity.6,30,45,63 To summarize the current literature, a hamstring-to-quadricep 
strength ratio of at least 85% of baseline is recommended before athletes returning to 
cutting, pivoting, and jumping sports. The patient's involved leg should be within 90% 
symmetry of their uninvolved leg for time and distance for single-legged, crossover, and 
triple hops for distance, as well as a 6-m timed hop test.17,51,61
Despite these guidelines, there is still a significant risk of reinjury, especially early after RTP 
from an ACLR. Paterno et al51 (2014) found that more than 30% of repeat injuries occur 
within 20 games or practice sessions of RTP. Laboute et al28 also noted that patients who 
returned to sport in <7 months were more likely to be reinjured than those who returned 
after 7 months. This may indicate that while the athlete is able to perform the above tasks, 
they still have not recovered completely. This notion is supported by existing literature that 
has described functional asymmetries/deficits that persist after RTP in ACL-reconstructed 
athletes.30,36,45,49 The reconstructed knee in particular may be at increased risk early after 
RTP relative to the contralateral knee.6,53 Further investigation is warranted to look more 
closely at RTP guidelines to aid in the development of standardized therapy protocols that 
minimize the risk of athletes returning to sports with persistent deficits.
The key to preventing injury and subsequent repeat injury may lie in the initiation of proper 
training at a young age. Literature has illustrated that neuromuscular training has been 
effective at preventing ACL injuries.20,37,40,44 As most training does not start early 
enough,40 the post-surgical rehabilitation program may be an ideal time to emphasize key 
movements including proper landing and pivoting mechanics. Using training techniques 
such as integrative neuromuscular training, which has been successful in reducing primary 
risk factors and injury incidence in young athletes,43,42,44 may provide opportunities to 
improve strength and biomechanics19,41 that contribute to a lower incidence of repeat injury 
in high-risk populations.9,46 More data are needed to evaluate the exact frequency of repeat 
injury, but at the same time, post-ACLR rehabilitation techniques need to be reexamined to

 note the cause of variation found in this analysis and also what exercises need to be 
emphasized.
Limitations
There are a number of limitations associated with this review. One limitation is the difficulty 
of ensuring that all ipsilateral and contralateral injuries were identified. Inadequate reporting 
of secondary injuries can lead to a misrepresentation of the injury rates. Another limitation is 
the lack of standardized data across studies regarding age, sex, follow-up time, and activity 
level/AEs at the time of reinjury. As mentioned above, outcome measures varied and some 
studies used surgical outcome measures, which may underestimate the true incidence of 
ACL reinjury.
Graft type, size, and surgical techniques also varied among the studies reviewed here. Many 
studies used single-surgeon data, and others relied on data from national registers that come 
from many different surgeons. We recognize that graft type and size may play roles in 
reinjury after ACLR4,23; however, these factors were beyond the scope of our review. That 
being said, a recent review by Wasserstein et al60 found that allografts were more likely than 
autografts to fail in patients <25 years who return to high levels of activity. Our current 
estimate of reinjury in this young and active population is based on 4 studies that used 
autografts at rates of 92.3%,51 .96.1%,2 100%,56 and 100%.61 Therefore, we believe that our 
estimate is firmly based on the current best surgical practices.
Sex may also influence both subjective and objective outcomes after primary ACLR. A 
recent meta-analysis by Tan et al58 indicates that females have greater knee laxity and lower 
Lysholm and Tegner activity scores compared with males. In addition, females return to 
sports less frequently than males do and have increased rates of revision ACLR.58 These 
outcome disparities among the 2 sexes likely play a significant role in reinjury in young, 
athletic populations. However, individual analysis of the sexes was not completed in the 
present review as a number of the included studies did not report the information necessary 
to complete this analysis.
Concurrently, rehabilitation methods and progressions, as well as RTP guidelines, differ 
among the studies reviewed. Deficient RTP guidelines may allow athletes to return to sports 
participation before regaining functional symmetry, subsequently increasing their risk of 
reinjury. While we understand that these methodological variations may have partially 
contributed to differences in incidence rates between individual studies, we believe that the 
high level of evidence and comprehensive analysis presented in this review will provide 
medical professionals and patients with a widely applicable understanding ACL reinjury.
Conclusion
This systematic review reported results after ACLR in the population as a whole, as well as 
in the younger population and those who return to play sports. A pooled total ACL reinjury 
rate for all patients was found to be 15%, while those <20 to 25 years old had a rate of 21%. 
The rate of secondary ACL injury among patients who return to sports was 20%. Most 
concerning, the incidence of reinjury in young patients (<20-25 years) who returned to high-

 risk sport was 23%. This means that nearly 1 in 4 young athletic patients who sustain an 
ACL injury and return to high-risk sport will go on to sustain another ACL injury at some 
point in their career, and they will likely sustain it early in the RTP period. Compared with 
uninjured adolescents, a young athlete who returns to sport after ACLR may be at a 30 to 40 
times greater risk of ACL injury. These data indicate that activity modification, improved 
rehabilitation and RTP guidelines, and the use of integrative neuromuscular training may 
help athletes more safely reintegrate into sport and reduce second injury in this at-risk 
population.

aA “1” indicates a “yes” score, and a dash indicates a “no” score. PEDro, Physiotherapy Evidence Database.
bThe PEDro scale is optimal for evaluating randomized control trials; therefore, it should be interpreted with caution in the studies included here, as they are nonrandomized. 1 = eligibility criteria specified; 
2 = random allocation of subjects; 3 = allocation concealed; 4 = similar groups at baseline; 5 = blinding of subjects; 6 = blinding of intervention providers; 7 = blinding of outcome assessors; 8 = outcomes 
obtained from 85% of subjects; 9 = use of intent-to-treat analysis if protocol violated; 10 = between-group statistical comparison; 11 = point measures and measures of variability.

aPopulation means for follow-up time and age and the number of participants used in meta-analyses are presented here. Age at primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) was used when 
specified. Outcome variables differed across studies, and those that measured surgical outcomes may have underestimated true ACL reinjury incidence. N/A, not applicable; NR, not reported.
bAverage age at primary ACLR was used when age at both primary and revision ACLR was reported.
cThe population size above reflects the total number of study participants. A population of 2130 was evaluated for reinjury outcomes.

dThe authors reported a rate of 23%, but we calculated a rate of 25.3% based on reported ipsilateral and contralateral reinjury rates.18
eAll subjects were <16 years old at primary ACLR.
fMeans were calculated from all available data (excluding Ahldén et al,2 Andernord et al,3 Bourke et al [2012b],5 Paterno et al [2012],50 and Salmon et al53).
gPooled total and contralateral reinjury rates were calculated from 7 studies that reported both ipsilateral and contralateral injury rates. The pooled ipsilateral reinjury rate was calculated from 14 studies that 
reported ipsilateral reinjury rates. Ahldén et al,2 Andernord et al,3 Bourke et al (2012b),5 Paterno et al (2012),50 and Salmon et al53 were excluded, as these study cohorts were included in other studies 
that were used in the calculation.

dAll subjects were <16 years old at primary ACLR.
eWebster et al61 reported a rate of 16% for contralateral ACL injury in patients <18 years calculated using n = 107 but calculated the total reinjury rate in patients <18 with n = 110. We chose to report the 
contralateral injury rate with n=110 for consistency with the total reinjury calculation within the article.
fMeans were calculated from all available data (excluding Ahldén et al2, Andernord et al3, Bourke et al [2012b]5, and Paterno et al [2012]50).
gPooled total and contralateral reinjury rates were calculated from 6 studies that reported both ipsilateral and contralateral injury rates (excluding Ahldén et al2 and Paterno et al [2012]50). The pooled 
ipsilateral reinjury rate was calculated from 11 studies that reported ipsilateral reinjury rates. Ahldén et al2, Bourke et al (2012b),5 Fältström et al14, and Paterno et al (2012)50 were excluded, as these 
study cohorts were included in other studies that were used in the calculation.

aPopulation mean follow-up time and the number of participants used in the meta-analyses are presented here. Studies were excluded from Table 5 if they did not report data on reinjury after return to play. 
The mean was calculated from the 6 studies that reported both ipsilateral and contralateral injury rates (Laboute et al,28 Paterno et al [2012],50 and Salmon et al53 were not included). One study measured 
surgical intervention as the outcome measure. N/A, not applicable.
bStudies in which patients returned to high-risk (cutting/pivoting/jumping) sports.
cReturn-to-play data were calculated using survival percentages provided for those returning to preinjury sports.
dTwo different population sizes were reported for ipsilateral reinjury and contralateral injury, respectively; an average is listed here.
ePopulation size was calculated using reported numbers of patients in the 3 reported age groups and reported percentages of each group that returned to sport.
fPooled total and contralateral reinjury rates were calculated from 6 studies that reported both ipsilateral and contralateral injury rates. The pooled ipsilateral reinjury rate was calculated from 7 studies that 
reported ipsilateral reinjury rates. Paterno et al (2012)50 and Salmon et al53 were excluded, as these study cohorts were included in other studies that were used in the calculation.

aMean follow-up time and the number of participants used in meta-analyses for return to play in high-risk (pivoting/cutting/jumping) sports are presented here. Studies were excluded from Table 6 if they 
did not report age-specific data on reinjury rates (including contralateral anterior cruciate ligament injury) after return to play in high-risk sports. Mean follow-up was calculated from 4 studies (Paterno et al 
[2012]50 was not included). One study measured surgical intervention as the outcome measure.
bThe same proportion of patients (92%) <18 years old returned to high-risk sport as the proportion of patients who suffered an index injury during high-risk sport (92%).
cPooled total, ipsilateral, and contralateral reinjury rates were calculated from 4 studies. Paterno et al (2012)50 was excluded, as their cohort was included in the Paterno et al (2014)51 study.
