ABSTRACT
The skin microbiome is a complex ecosystem with important implica-
tions for cutaneous health and disease. Topical antibiotics and antiseptics are often
employed to preserve the balance of this population and inhibit colonization by
more pathogenic bacteria. However, despite their widespread use, the impact of
these interventions on broader microbial communities remains poorly understood.
Here, we report the longitudinal effects of topical antibiotics and antiseptics on skin
bacterial communities and their role in Staphylococcus aureus colonization resistance.
In response to antibiotics, cutaneous populations exhibited an immediate shift in
bacterial residents, an effect that persisted for multiple days posttreatment. By con-
trast, antiseptics elicited only minor changes to skin bacterial populations, with few
changes to the underlying microbiota. While variable in scope, both antibiotics and
antiseptics were found to decrease colonization by commensal Staphylococcus spp.
by sequencing- and culture-based methods, an effect which was highly dependent
on baseline levels of Staphylococcus. Because Staphylococcus residents have been
shown to compete with the skin pathogen S. aureus, we also tested whether treat-
ment could influence S. aureus levels at the skin surface. We found that treated mice
were more susceptible to exogenous association with S. aureus and that precoloniza-
tion with the same Staphylococcus residents that were previously disrupted by treat-
ment reduced S. aureus levels by over 100-fold. In all, the results of this study indi-
cate that antimicrobial drugs can alter skin bacterial residents and that these alterations
can have critical implications for cutaneous host defense.

ntimicrobial drugs are commonly employed to inhibit the growth of pathogenic
microorganisms. However, these interventions are rarely narrow in spectrum,
instead acting on a range of bacterial species in our commensal microbiota (1). A
number of studies have elucidated this effect in gut microbial populations, describing
a dramatic reorganization of resident communities (2). This includes decreased bacterial
diversity and outgrowth by previously minor contributors (3–5). Importantly, these
alterations can persist for months to years posttreatment (6–8) and also affect a number
of host functions, including metabolism, immunity, and transcriptional regulation
(9, 10).
Despite these findings, few studies have assessed the impact of antimicrobial drugs
at alternative body sites, such as the skin. Rather, the majority of research at this site has
been devoted to a subset of easily cultured microorganisms studied in isolation (11).
This includes MIC tests of pathogenic skin bacteria, as well as exogenous colonization
studies in which nonresident test microorganisms are applied to the skin prior to

 treatment (12). While these results are often applied more broadly, their main purpose
is to inform the effect of antimicrobial drugs on transient infectious bacteria rather than
on more stable members of the community (13). As such, few studies have truly
assessed the impact of antimicrobial drugs on inhabitant cutaneous populations. This
dearth of research is especially notable given the frequency with which humans disrupt
skin bacterial communities in both clinical and nonclinical settings. Indeed, the intent
of most antiseptics is to sterilize the skin by employing agents with nonspecific
mechanisms of action (14), with little regard for their effect on the resident microbiota.
While culture-independent surveys have recently illuminated the complexity of the
skin microbiota (15–17), its necessity for normal function and disease remains unclear.
One postulated function includes a role in colonization resistance, whereby members
of the commensal microbiota could protect the host from infection by opportunistic
and pathogenic skin microorganisms (18). This particular process has been well docu-
mented in the gut. Here, numerous studies have highlighted the ability of bacterial
residents to impair colonization by pathogenic bacteria through immune activation,
nutrient exclusion, and the production of toxic metabolites (19). Antibiotics have also
been shown to shift the resident microbiota and render hosts more susceptible to
certain pathogenic bacteria (20). This includes studies of the sporulating bacterium
Clostridium difficile, which can recur repeatedly in response to antibiotic treatment
but can also be controlled in most patients following the administration of fecal
material from healthy unaffected donors (21–23). Importantly, this particular effect is
not isolated to C. difficile, as a number of bacterial pathogens, including vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus and Salmonella enterica, have been shown to exploit newly
available niches in response to treatment as well (24–26).
Similar to tests in the gut, recent studies have begun to assess the potential for skin
microorganisms to play a role in colonization resistance. This includes defense against
Staphylococcus aureus by unique strains of S. epidermidis (27), S. lugdunensis (28), and
most recently, S. hominis (29). Here, it was found that certain individuals are colonized
by host-specific Staphylococcus strains with the ability to alter S. aureus colonization
patterns. While these studies also suggest that a removal of resident bacteria with
antimicrobial agents could promote S. aureus colonization, no study to date has
assessed this hypothesis in detail. Indeed, the long-term impact of topical antimicrobial
drugs on skin bacterial communities and their ability to alter colonization patterns by
S. aureus competitors remains largely unknown.
Here, we report this missing link by assessing the effect of antibiotics and antiseptics
on the resident skin microbiota through a comparative time-series analysis. We report
a differential impact of treatment on skin bacterial inhabitants, with the greatest
disturbances elicited by a broad-spectrum triple antibiotic cocktail of bacitracin, neo-
mycin, and polymyxin B. By contrast, we report a relatively muted effect of antiseptics,
with only modest alterations to overall bacterial community structure. Despite these
differences, we identified a conserved decrease in the levels of Staphylococcus residents
regardless of treatment, a result that was strongly influenced by baseline levels of
Staphylococcus.
Because commensal Staphylococcus spp. have been shown to impair colonization
by the skin pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we further evaluated this antimicrobial
effect in the context of S. aureus colonization resistance. We show that treatment can
promote exogenous association with S. aureus and that the same Staphylococcus
residents disrupted by treatment are also capable of S. aureus competition, decreasing
S. aureus levels by over 100-fold in precolonization experiments. In all, our results
demonstrate that antimicrobial drugs can elicit long-term shifts in skin bacterial com-
munities and that treatment with these agents has key implications for host suscepti-
bility to pathogens such as S. aureus.

 SKH-1 hairless mice twice daily for 1 week with the narrow-spectrum antibiotic mupi-
rocin, a broad spectrum triple antibiotic ointment ([TAO] bacitracin, neomycin, poly-
myxin B), or their respective vehicles, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and petrolatum (see
Fig. S1a in the supplemental material). These particular antibiotics were chosen for their
range of activities as well as their extensive use as both therapeutic and prophylactic
agents in both clinical and nonclinical settings (30). In all, antibiotics led to durable
changes in skin bacterial residents, with populations forming three distinct clusters (I to
III) and four subclusters (IIIA to IIID) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, clusters I and IIIA were
composed largely of baseline and early time point samples high in Staphylococcus,
while treatment with antibiotics led to sustained decreases in Staphylococcus (Fig. S1b)
and alternative clustering patterns. By contrast, cluster II was composed almost entirely
of TAO-treated mice, a group that exhibited significant increases in Enterobacteriaceae,
Porphyromadaceae, and Ruminococcaceae, as well as significant decreases in Lachno-
spiraceae and certain taxa classified more generally within the Clostridiales family (Fig.
1b to d). This distinction led to a marked absence of TAO-treated mice from clusters

 IIIB to IIID and, similar to that seen with Staphylococcus, was sustained for multiple
weeks posttreatment.
Unlike TAO-treated mice, those administered mupirocin displayed community shifts
largely in line with those treated with the vehicle PEG. Indeed, while these mice
exhibited significant increases in Alistipes and decreases in Oscillibacter and Staphylo-
coccus (Fig. S1b and c), these minor changes were not enough to elicit separate
clustering patterns among the two treatment groups. These particular changes also
displayed similar kinetics to those of bacterial taxa in TAO-treated mice, including
immediate increases in rarified abundance and sustained posttreatment effects, under-
scoring the difficulties faced by skin communities when attempting to reacclimate
upon treatment cessation.
An analysis of bacterial burden revealed a contrasting effect of antibiotics on
absolute abundance as well. While mupirocin led to the characteristic decreases often
associated with antibiotic treatment, TAO treatment resulted in increases in bacterial
load at numerous time points as measured by 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR (qPCR)
(Fig. S1d). These findings further highlight the impact of antibiotic treatment on
skin communities and suggest that the changes elicited by TAO may also be due to
increases in the overall numbers of certain bacteria and not just their relative
proportions.
Topical antibiotics shift bacterial community structure. To better quantify these
results at the community level, we next evaluated the diversity of bacterial populations
over time. Similar to taxonomic analyses, we observed a relative stability in un-
treated mice and those treated with PEG, mupirocin, and petrolatum when testing
alpha diversity metrics such as Shannon diversity, which takes into account the
richness and evenness of taxa (Fig. 2a). By contrast, those treated with TAO
exhibited an immediate and significant decrease in diversity starting after a single
day (d1) of treatment, an effect that was maintained for greater than 1 week post-
treatment. This was also recapitulated when evaluating community similarity by the
weighted UniFrac metric, which assesses population differences based on abundance
and phylogeny. When comparing each mouse to their baseline (d0) samples, we
observed significantly greater differences in the TAO-treated group than in the vehicle-
treated mice, a trend not shared by those administered mupirocin (Fig. 2b). Additional
visualization of these samples by principal coordinate analysis further confirmed these
results, as distinct clustering patterns were observed when comparing TAO-treated
mice to other treatment groups (Fig. 2c).
Previously, others have shown similarities in the functional composition of a pop-
ulation despite differences in community membership and structure (31). To evaluate
whether antibiotic treatment could lead to changes in the functional potential of skin
inhabitants, we also utilized the PICRUSt software package (32) to infer metagenomic
content of our populations. Specifically, PICRUSt analysis focuses on chromosomally
encoded conserved differences among species as a method to approximate functional
disparities. We found that treatment with antibiotics and vehicles led to a number of
significant differences in genes predicted to be associated with metabolism, signaling,
transport, and biosynthesis, among others (see Fig. S2). As such, the potential exists
that by shifting the residents of the cutaneous microbiota, treatment may shift the
functional capabilities of these populations as well.
Antiseptic treatment elicits only modest changes to skin bacterial community
structure. Following our tests with antibiotic regimens, we next endeavored to eval-
uate the impact of antiseptics, a more promiscuous class of antimicrobials, on the skin
microbiome. We reasoned that these topical interventions should provide an even
greater impetus for community disruption due to their indiscriminate mechanisms and
proven efficacy in clinical settings (14). To evaluate this hypothesis, we treated mice
with the common clinical antiseptics alcohol (80% ethanol) and povidone-iodine (10%)
and compared this to mice treated with water or untreated controls (see Fig. S3a).
Surprisingly, we observed no clustering of mice in response to antisepsis when taking

 into account major taxonomic groups at even the earliest (d1) posttreatment time point
(Fig. 3a). Furthermore, when comparing the relative abundances of individual taxa
following treatment, we detected no significant differences among treated mice and
untreated controls (see Table S1). To evaluate whether subtle differences could con-
tribute to a disruption at the population level, we also tested the diversity of commu-
nities in response to treatment. Similar to our taxonomic analyses, we found that
antiseptic treatment resulted in no significant differences to Shannon Diversity (Fig. 3b),
nor could we detect significant clustering by treatment using beta diversity metrics
such as weighted UniFrac at d1 posttreatment (Fig. 3c). To assess whether we had
missed decreases in absolute abundance by focusing our analyses on the relative
proportions of taxa, we also tested the impact of treatment on the bacterial load of
communities. Once again, we observed no significant differences between treated and
untreated mice (Fig. 3d), further underscoring the stability of cutaneous bacterial
communities in response to antiseptic treatment.
As this result was particularly surprising, we also compared bacterial phylotypes at
baseline to their d1 counterparts. This enabled us to evaluate whether treatment could
shift populations in a conserved manner, thus explaining the modest effects seen
between regimens at d1 posttreatment. However, when comparing the abundances of
major taxonomic groups, we once again observed relatively few changes from d0 to d1
in response to treatment. Only Staphylococcus results differed significantly, and only in
response to alcohol treatment (Table S2). Interestingly, this effect was strongly depen-
dent upon starting communities, as mice with higher baseline levels of Staphylo-

 coccus were more strongly disrupted than those with lower baseline levels, regardless
of treatment (Fig. S3b.). In all, this indicates that antiseptics elicit a more muted
response in skin bacterial populations, but that their effects may be dependent upon
starting communities.
Culture-based studies recapitulate sequence analyses of skin microbiota dy-
namics. Our finding that most antiseptics elicited only minor changes to the resident
skin microbiota was particularly surprising given the wealth of data describing their
benefit in clinical settings. To address this discrepancy, we next sought to validate our
findings using culturable skin inhabitants. Specifically, Staphylococcus spp. were chosen

 as a proxy because of their established response to topical antimicrobials in the clinic
and their importance to human health. These bacteria were also the only inhabitants
to vary in response to both antibiotics and antiseptics in our sequencing experiments
and thus represented the best opportunity to verify our results in a culture setting.
Because our antiseptic experiments showed antibacterial effects were dependent
upon baseline communities, we began by designing a system to control Staphylococcus
levels in murine populations. Specifically, we observed that mice housed in cages
changed once per week displayed a significant elevation in Staphylococcus levels (high
Staphylococcus [HS]) compared with those changed more frequently (low Staphylococ-
cus [LS]) (Fig. 4a). When controlled over time, this effect could be maintained for
multiple weeks and had the potential for reversibility, as mice swapped from frequent
to infrequent cage changes rapidly converted to the alternate phenotype. Cage change
frequency and monitoring thus presented the opportunity to maintain Staphylococcus
at distinct levels prior to treatment.
To evaluate the impact of antimicrobial drugs on culturable Staphylococcus, we
began by housing mice in cages with frequent or infrequent changes and then treating
with PEG, mupirocin, petrolatum, or TAO. Similar to sequencing experiments, antibiotic
treatment led to a significant decrease in Staphylococcus starting at d1 posttreatment
regardless of starting community, although this effect was more pronounced in LS mice
(Fig. 4b and c). Interestingly, while we also observed a gradual decrease of Staphylo-
coccus in response to PEG treatment, petrolatum-treated LS mice displayed increased
Staphylococcus colonization at early time points and elevated levels of Staphylococcus
compared with those in untreated controls in HS mice. Because our sequencing results
revealed similar decreases in Staphylococcus in response to treatment with antibi-
otics but not petrolatum, this represents a reproducible mechanism in multiple
testing protocols.
To assess this effect in the context of antiseptics, a separate cohort of HS and LS
mice was next treated with water, alcohol, or povidone-iodine and compared with
untreated controls. Unlike those treated with antibiotics, no significant differences in
Staphylococcus were observed in LS mice following treatment with water, alcohol, or
povidone-iodine compared to baseline colonization at d1 posttreatment (Fig. 4d).
Moreover, while Staphylococcus colonization in HS mice was significantly decreased
following treatment, untreated mice with a single cage change exhibited an almost
identical reduction in colonization, confirming that a change in environment can also
have significant impacts on bacterial communities (Fig. 4e). In all, these experiments
indicate that antibiotics and antiseptics have distinct effects on skin bacterial residents
and that the magnitude of this response can vary depending upon starting commu-
nities.
Antimicrobial drugs reduce colonization by Staphylococcus aureus competitors.
After confirming our sequencing results with culture experiments, we next endeavored to
explore the ramifications of cutaneous bacterial community disruption. As previous
studies have suggested a role for the skin microbiota, and specifically resident Staph-
ylococcus spp., in S. aureus colonization resistance (27–29), we chose this particular
commensal-pathogen pair for further analysis. We were particularly attracted by the
ability of antimicrobial drugs to shift communities for multiple days posttreatment,
suggesting a window in which S. aureus could access the skin unencumbered by
competing residents or antimicrobial drugs. As alcohol was found to have relatively
minor effects on skin bacterial residents, with the exception of Staphylococcus spp., we
first tested whether treatment with this antiseptic could promote S. aureus association.
Specifically, mice were treated with alcohol, similar to in previous experiments, and
then exogenously associated with S. aureus 1 day posttreatment. As hypothesized, we
observed a slight but significant increase in S. aureus levels in treated mice compared
with that in untreated controls, indicating a reduction in colonization resistance in
response to treatment (Fig. 5a).
Because this effect could also be the result of additional factors, including previously
unidentified microbial inhabitants, we next profiled individual Staphylococcus isolates

 that were reduced by antimicrobial treatment in our previous experiments. We rea-
soned that if these bacteria were the true source of colonization resistance, then adding
them back to the skin should reduce S. aureus association in kind. Following phenotypic
analysis and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we isolated five unique resident
Staphylococcus genotypes, namely, AS9, AS10, AS11, AS12, and AS17. Comparing these

genomic variability within the 16S rRNA gene region, suggesting a relative permissivity
at the skin surface for these particular taxa (see Fig. S4).
To assess the colonization potential of each isolate, we next compared their growth
dynamics under various conditions. When comparing growth in enriched medium, we
observed distinct differences among isolates, with AS17 S. lentus and AS11 S. xylosus
displaying the most robust expansion kinetics (Fig. 5c). By contrast, AS9 S. epidermidis
appeared to replicate the slowest and exhibited the most gradual exponential curve.
AS10 S. xylosus and AS12 S. nepalensis both displayed intermediate growth patterns. To
further evaluate colonization potential, we assessed the ability of these isolates to

 colonize murine dorsa in vivo. Specifically, mice were housed in frequently changed
cages to reduce endogenous Staphylococcus and then were epicutaneously inoculated
every other day for 1 week to promote association with individual Staphylococcus
isolates. Despite variable growth dynamics in vitro, all isolates colonized mice to an
equal titer in vivo, suggesting conserved undefined factors to promote colonization at
the skin surface (Fig. 5d).
As each of these isolates displayed notable colonization when added to murine
hosts, we further tested all five to see whether they could also represent potential S.
aureus competitors. To evaluate the ability of each isolate to restrict S. aureus coloni-
zation, we precolonized mice with each Staphylococcus resident, similar to the method
described above, and then challenged them with S. aureus 1 day later. While isolates
exhibited various levels of competition, all resulted in significant decreases to S. aureus
association compared with that in uncolonized mice (Fig. 5e). Indeed, most mice
exhibited greater than 10-fold reductions in S. aureus, and many, including those
precolonized with S. epidermidis, were capable of decreasing S. aureus by levels greater
than 100-fold. In all, this shows that skin bacterial residents can compete with S. aureus
at the skin surface and that their removal can impact S. aureus colonization potential.
DISCUSSION
Given the expansive use of topical antibiotics and antiseptics, it is somewhat
surprising that longitudinal studies to evaluate their effects on a community-wide scale
are not more common. Here, we report that antimicrobial drugs can elicit significant
changes to skin bacterial community membership and structure, albeit to various
degrees. We also demonstrate that these alterations can have important consequences
for colonization resistance and the skin pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.
Previous work has focused extensively on antibiotics and the gut microbiota. These
studies have highlighted the ability of antimicrobials to disrupt bacterial communities
and the consequences of these drugs on host physiology (34). One such example
includes the elimination of colonization resistance, leading to increased susceptibility
to bacterial infections (35). By altering the structure of bacterial populations in the gut,
antibiotics can shift the balance in favor of more infectious microorganisms (19).
Clostridium difficile is perhaps the best-studied representation of this effect (36). How-
ever, additional pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and Salmonella
enterica can also exploit newly available niches and cause disease (37, 38). As a result,
the true question has transcended beyond whether or not antimicrobial drugs can
promote pathogenicity to how best to mediate these unintended consequences.
The first step in such ventures is the elucidation of antimicrobial effects on a
community-wide scale. While studies of the gut have been vital to this endeavor, we
present the skin as an additional body site worthy of consideration. In our investiga-
tions, triple antibiotic ointment (TAO) was found to provoke the greatest response in
microbial residence, with a significant decrease in bacterial diversity and domination by
previously minor contributors. While these changes originated as a result of treatment-
specific effects, they often endured, and in some cases were enhanced, following
treatment cessation. This indicates that disrupted resident skin bacteria may also
undergo multiple levels of succession prior to community stabilization, similar to that
in the gut (39).
In accordance with their mechanisms of action, we also found the overall effect
of mupirocin to be relatively minor compared with that of TAO. While TAO led to
profound increases in bacteria from multiple families, including Enterobacteriaceae
and Porphyromonadaceae, mupirocin produced relatively minor shifts in less-abundant
taxa such as Alistipes and Oscillibacter. This finding is particularly notable as certain
members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families have known
intrinsic resistance mechanisms against TAO components, such as polymyxin B (40, 41).
This could also explain the increase in overall bacterial load seen in mice following TAO
administration, as certain bacteria may thrive when given access to a newly available
cutaneous niche.

 Perhaps most surprisingly, we also report a relatively muted impact of antiseptics on
the skin microbiota, with alcohol and povidone-iodine both failing to shift baseline
communities in a significant manner. While it is tempting to explain this finding as an
inability of 16S rRNA gene sequencing to distinguish between live and dead bacteria,
we find this conclusion unlikely in the context of results from our studies and from
those before us. Indeed, our ability to detect differences in TAO-treated mice within 1
day of treatment provides strong evidence to the contrary. Others have also reported
similar community responses to both decolonization protocols (42) and mild and
antibacterial soaps (43), further validating this assertion.
Rapid repopulation of the skin could also explain our perceived lack of effect in
response to antiseptic stress. However, as our study and those before us employed
relatively early posttreatment samplings, we find it unlikely that residents could recol-
onize the skin in such a short period of time. Indeed, many of the bacteria observed in
our experiments have been shown to exhibit particularly slow growth dynamics in
previous examinations (44, 45). However, repopulation is likely shaped by both the
magnitude of change and the environment. As such, future work will be necessary to
establish a more complete understanding of this process as it relates to skin bacterial
dynamics.
With this in mind, it is important to note that multiple studies have shown a
reduction of certain culturable skin inhabitants in response to antisepsis. This includes
residents from the commonly studied genus Staphylococcus, often chosen for its
ease of use in culture-based experiments (46, 47). In line with these findings, we also
observed a decrease in Staphylococcus residents in our sequencing and culture studies.
However, we note that, because this bacterium was only one member of the larger
community, this decline did not lead to shifts in overall population structure. As such,
we hypothesize that the true utility of antiseptics may lie in their ability to disrupt a
particular subset of microorganisms at the skin surface, while leaving the underlying
community relatively unchanged.
Interestingly, Staphylococcus residents also exhibited distinct baseline-dependent
dynamics in response to antiseptic treatment during our sequencing experiments.
Specifically, we observed that mice with high levels of Staphylococcus responded
more readily to treatment than mice with low levels of colonization. This suggested a
nuanced impact of antiseptics on certain bacterial inhabitants, whereby treatment
effects could vary depending upon starting communities. To verify this hypothesis, we
developed a system in which Staphylococcus could be tested for antimicrobial suscep-
tibility at both high and low colonization levels. As anticipated, we found the efficacy
of antiseptics to be highly dependent upon baseline communities. Mice with low levels
of Staphylococcus at baseline (LS) exhibited little to no decline in Staphylococcus, while
those in mice with high levels (HS) were reduced by approximately 100-fold. Impor-
tantly, we observed a similar effect in control HS mice, suggesting that higher levels of
Staphylococcus are less stable in general, and thus represent atypical colonization. By
contrast, the inability of antiseptics to reduce Staphylococcus in LS mice indicates a
relative stability in this community and a population capable of resisting the short-term
stressors of antisepsis. We believe these studies have important implications for anti-
microbial efficacy, particularly in the case of human skin, as humans are likely exposed
to a greater number of transient microorganisms than are laboratory mice housed in
more controlled environments (48).
When comparing antibiotic and antiseptic treatments, we observed that a standard
course of antibiotics was more capable of community disruption than was acute
antisepsis. While these are the most commonly employed regimens in the clinic, further
research should also evaluate the effects of long-term antiseptic treatments on the skin
microbiota as well as other delivery mechanisms. Indeed, the potential exists that
consistent exposure to antiseptics through alternative means may have a more signif-
icant impact on skin inhabitants due to increased contact time or bioavailability. This is
especially important when considering the rise of decolonization practices in the clinic,

 remove resident Staphylococcus species (49, 50). While these methods efficiently re-
move endogenous S. aureus from the nares and extranasal body sites, they likely alter
the underlying skin microbiota in kind. Without proper recolonization, these interven-
tions could feasibly elicit long-term shifts in the skin microbiota, similar to that in
our experiments, and promote infection by more dangerous hospital- and community-
acquired pathogens (51–53).
To assess this very possibility, we investigated the potential of treatment to promote
S. aureus colonization at the skin surface in our mouse model. In response to treatment,
we observed a significant increase in S. aureus levels compared with that in untreated
controls following exogenous association, suggesting an increase in cutaneous permis-
sivity. As previous studies have illustrated the role of certain Staphylococcus spp. to
compete with S. aureus for colonization (27–29), we proceeded by testing the ability
of murine Staphylococcus isolates to compete with S. aureus. Specifically, we chose
Staphylococcus residents that were disrupted by antibiotic and antiseptic treatment in
our previous experiments for further analysis. This enabled us to determine whether
these particular bacterial residents were responsible for the decrease in colonization
resistance and to confirm the ability of antimicrobial drugs to alter communities with
the potential for S. aureus competition. Importantly, we found that all isolates were
capable of protecting against S. aureus association, with a number of mice exhibiting
reductions in S. aureus levels by over 100-fold. These results support the notion that
antimicrobial drugs can impact S. aureus colonization resistance and argue for en-
hanced stewardship in the context of posttreatment recovery.
In all, we describe the importance of antimicrobial drugs to skin bacterial commu-
nity dynamics. By detecting unique changes in the microbiota in response to topical
antibiotics and antiseptics, we present the skin as a body site capable of reproducible
disruptions and fluctuations in colonization resistance. For this reason and others, we
further advocate for the judicious use of antibiotics and antiseptics, as well as increased
monitoring of bacterial populations, to combat the unintentional consequences which
can follow cutaneous perturbations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice. Six-week-old female SKH-1 immunocompetent hairless mice were purchased from Charles
River and acclimated for at least 2 weeks prior to testing. Throughout experimentation, mice were
housed on ALPHA-Dri bedding and given ad libitum access to autoclaved food and water. Mice treated
with the same antimicrobial drug or exogenous Staphylococcus strains were housed together to avoid
mixing, and at least two cages were used per condition to assess caging effects. All cages were changed
three to four times per week during the course of a study unless otherwise noted. All mouse procedures
were performed under protocols approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Antimicrobial treatment and sample collection. For experiments involving antibiotics, mice were
treated every 12 h for 7 days on the dorsum with mupirocin (2% in polyethylene glycol), a triple antibiotic
ointment (bacitracin, 400 U; neomycin, 3.5 mg; polymyxin B, 5,000 U in petrolatum), or their respective
vehicles, polyethylene glycol (PEG 400 and PEG 3350) and petrolatum. Mice were swabbed longitudinally
as described in Fig. S1a in the supplemental material, with collections occurring prior to morning
applications during treatment to minimize experimental disruptions. For experiments involving antisep-
tics, mice were treated on the dorsum with UltraPure water (MoBio), alcohol (80% ethanol), or povidone-
iodine (Betadine, 10%) every 8 h, three times in total. Mice were swabbed as described in Fig. S3a, with
d1 collections occurring 4 h after the final treatment. At least three cages of three mice each were used
for all conditions to evaluate caging effects. All treatments were applied with sterile UV-irradiated cotton
swabs (Beauty 360; CVS), and samples were collected with sterile foam-tipped applicators (Puritan). A
standard topical inoculum of approximately 150 �l per mouse was utilized for both antibiotic and
antiseptic experiments. All swabs were stored at �20°
C prior to extraction.
Bacterial DNA isolation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR. Bacterial DNA was extracted
as described previously (54). Briefly, Ready-Lyse lysozyme solution (Epicentre), bead beating, and heat
shock at 65°
C were used to lyse cells. The Invitrogen PureLink kit was used for DNA extraction. During
our testing, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was found to better approximate murine skin
communities than V1V3. PCR and sequencing of the V4 region were thus performed using 150-bp
paired-end chemistry and the barcoded primers 515F (5=-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3=) and 806R
(5=-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3=) (55) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Accuprime high-fidelity Taq
polymerase was used for PCR cycling conditions of 94°
C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°
C for 45
s, 50°
C for 60 s, and 72°
C for 90 s, and ending with 72°
C for 10 min. For bacterial load comparisons, 16S
rRNA genes were amplified by qPCR using Fast SYBR green master mix (Fisher Scientific) and the qPCR
optimized primers 533F (5=-GTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAA-3=) and 902R (5=-GTCAATTCITTTGAGTTTYARYC-

Samples were compared to standard curves generated from known concentrations of serially diluted
bacterial DNA to calculate burden.
Microbiome analysis. Raw sequences were assembled, demultiplexed, and trimmed to yield
24,026,791 total high-quality V4 reads. Sequences were then further processed using QIIME 1.7.0 prior to
downstream analyses (56). Briefly, sequences were de novo clustered into operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) based on 97% similarity by UClust (57), and taxonomy was assigned to the most abundant
representative sequence per cluster using the RDP classifier (58). Sequences were aligned by PyNAST
(59), and chimeric sequences were removed using ChimeraSlayer (60) along with those identified as
“Unclassified,” “Bacteria;Other,” or “Cyanobacteria.” Singletons were also removed in addition to any
OTU found at greater than 1% abundance in at least 50% of kit and environmental control samples
to eliminate potential contaminating sequences. All antiseptics, antibiotics, and vehicles were similarly
sequenced and evaluated for possible contaminating sequences. All samples were rarified to 5,000
sequences/sample corresponding to an average Good’s coverage of 0.95/sample, and samples below this
cutoff were removed from downstream analyses. Alpha and beta diversity matrices were calculated in
QIIME, and statistical analysis and visualization were performed in the R statistical computing environ-
ment (61). Heat maps were constructed by condensing all OTUs above 0.1% to the top 30 taxonomic
identifications. The PICRUSt bioinformatics software package was used to infer functional content of
bacterial communities (32).
Caging effects. Mice were housed three per cage with three cages per group, and cages were
randomly assigned to be changed every other day (frequently) or once per week (infrequently) for 4
weeks. Swabs were taken every 7 days prior to changes of the infrequent group and cultured for
Staphylococcus residents on mannitol salt agar ([MSA] Acumedia) overnight at 37°
C. At day 28 (d28), mice
from each cohort were reassigned to the alternate groups and swabbed for an additional 4 weeks to
evaluate normalization.
Antimicrobials and alternate Staphylococcus communities. Mice were assigned to frequent or
infrequent cage changes prior to treatment to generate low Staphylococcus and high Staphylococcus
communities, respectively, and treated as described above. During experimentation, all cages were
changed on a frequent schedule with untreated mice representing controls. Swabs were taken at
baseline, d1, day 4 (d4), and day 7 (d7) for antibiotic-treated mice and at baseline and 4 h posttreatment
for antiseptic-treated mice. Samples were cultured on MSA overnight at 37°
C to enumerate Staphylo-
coccus numbers.
Staphylococcus isolation, sequencing, and phylogenetic tree. To obtain a more complete profile
of our Staphylococcus isolates, phenotypically distinct Staphylococcus colonies were picked from MSA
plates following culture from murine dorsa prior to and after antimicrobial treatment. DNA was extracted
from colonies as described above, and DNA was PCR-amplified using full-length 16S rRNA gene primers
(27F and 1492R). The primary PCR conditions used were 98°
C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95°
C for 45 s, 56°
C
for 60 s, and 72°
C for 90 s, and 72°
C for 10 min. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed
by Sanger sequencing, and resident Staphylococcus isolates were compared to known Staphylococcus
16S rRNA genes downloaded from the RDP database (33). Phylogenetic trees were generated by FastTree
(62) and visualized in FigTree v1.4.3.
Growth curves. Staphylococcus isolates were grown at 37°
C in liquid Luria broth (Fisher Scientific) for
12 h with shaking at 300 rpm. Samples were taken every hour and optical density was determined at 600
nm (OD600) using the BioTek Synergy HT plate reader.
Exogenous Staphylococcus colonization and S. aureus competition. Staphylococcus isolates were
grown overnight in liquid Luria broth (Fisher Scientific) at 37°
C and 300 rpm. On the following day,
isolates were subcultured, incubated to achieve log growth, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) to acquire 108 CFU/ml inoculums. Titers were validated by culture and OD600 measurements.
Two cages of three mice each were frequently changed to reduce levels of endogenous Staphylococcus
and were monoassociated at the dorsum with 200 �l of Staphylococcus isolate inoculum using a sterile
swab. Applications of Staphylococcus suspensions were repeated every other day over the course of 1
week for a total of four applications. Mice were then swabbed 1 day following the fourth application, and
swabs were cultured on MSA overnight at 37°
C for CFU enumeration. S. aureus strain 502A with selective
streptomycin resistance was chosen for S. aureus competition studies because of its proven efficiency in
skin colonization and its potential for pathogenicity (63, 64). S. aureus was grown in a manner similar to
that of Staphylococcus isolates and applied 1 day posttreatment or 1 day postmonoassociation with
individual Staphylococcus isolates. Control mice were administered PBS only. Mice were then swabbed
the following day for S. aureus, and swabs were cultured on LB agar with streptomycin for selective CFU
enumeration.
