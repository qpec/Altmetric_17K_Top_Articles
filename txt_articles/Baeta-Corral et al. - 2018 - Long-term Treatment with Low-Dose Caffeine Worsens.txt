Coffee or caffeine has recently been suggested as prophylaxis for dementia. Although
memory problems are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, this dementia is also
characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms called Behavioral and Psychological
Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). The impact of preventive/therapeutic strategies on both
cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms can be addressed in the 3xTg-AD mice, since
they exhibit cognitive but also BPSD-like profiles. Here, we studied the long-term effects
of a low dose of caffeine in male 3xTg-AD mice and as compared to age-matched non-
transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging. Animals were treated (water or caffeine
in drinking water) from adulthood (6 months of age) until middle-aged (13 months of
age), that in 3xTg-AD mice correspond to onset of cognitive impairment and advanced
stages, respectively. The low caffeine dosing used (0.3 mg/ml) was previously found
to give a plasma concentration profile in mice roughly equivalent to that of a human
coffee drinker. There were significant effects of caffeine on most behavioral variables,
especially those related to neophobia and other anxiety-like behaviors, emotionality, and
cognitive flexibility. The 3xTg-AD and NTg mice were differently influenced by caffeine.
Overall, the increase of neophobia and other anxiety-related behaviors resulted in an
exacerbation of BPSD-like profile in 3xTg-AD mice. Learning and memory, strongly
influenced by anxiety in 3xTg-AD mice, got little benefit from caffeine, only shown after
a detailed analysis of navigation strategies. The worsened pattern in NTg mice and the
use of search strategies in 3xTg-AD mice make both groups more similar. Circadian
motor activity showed genotype differences, which were found to be enhanced by
caffeine. Selective effects of caffeine on NTg were found in the modulation of behaviors
related to emotional profile and risk assessment. Caffeine normalized splenomegaly of
3xTg-AD mice, a physical indicator of their impaired peripheral immune system, and
trended to increase their corticosterone levels. Our observations of adverse caffeine
effects in an Alzheimer’s disease model together with previous clinical observations
suggest that an exacerbation of BPSD-like symptoms may partly interfere with the
beneficial cognitive effects of caffeine. These results are relevant when coffee-derived
new potential treatments for dementia are to be devised and tested.

Chronic Caffeine Worsens 3xTg-AD Mice BPSD
INTRODUCTION
Caffeine, a non-selective A1 and A2A receptor antagonist,
is one of the most consumed drugs all over the world.
The average consumption of caffeine in humans is around
300–
400 mg/day (three to four cups of coffee) and its effects in
several physiological functions, such as locomotion, sleep, and
cardiovascular function, depend on the dose and duration of
the consumption (Fredholm et al., 1999, 2017; Fredholm, 2007).
A large part of the cognitive enhancing properties of caffeine is
due to its indirect action on arousal, mood, and concentration
(reviewed by Nehlig, 2010). Thus, low doses of caffeine
(20–
200 mg/day) have been associated with positive effects
on subjective mood: wellbeing, confidence, motivation, alert,
security, efficiency, concentration, and desire for socialization
(see Griffiths et al., 1990; Silverman et al., 1994). In this low
range, caffeine (up to 300–
400 mg) has also a stimulating action
with biphasic motor effects (Fredholm et al., 1999). However,
restraint from moderate or high intake of coffee (more than four
cups a day) is recommended due to negative effects of caffeine
on pregnancy, risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular problems,
anxiety, sleep disturbances, and alterations in physiological
functions such as locomotion (Fredholm et al., 1999; Johansson
et al., 2001; Giménez-Llort et al., 2005; Fredholm, 2007;
Hermansen et al., 2012).
In the last decade, a neuroprotective role of caffeine and other
compounds of coffee such as theophylline has been postulated
and it is of a growing interest (Maia and de Mendonç
a, 2002;
Chen et al., 2010; Eskelinen and Kivipelto, 2010; Cao et al., 2012).
For instance, the study “
Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and
Dementia”(Eskelinen et al., 2009) indicated that consumption of
three to five cups of coffee daily average age of the population
is associated in 65% of cases, with a lower risk of developing
dementia in the future. Although the whole complexity of aging
process is still unknown, the use of caffeine to treat cognitive
deficits associated with natural aging and those in Alzheimer’
s
disease is foreseen as promising. With that, a substantial number
of studies have been published suggesting preventive effects of
coffee or caffeine on Alzheimer’
s disease (e.g., Arendash et al.,
2006; Solfrizzi et al., 2015; Kolahdouzan and Hamadeh, 2017;
Oñatibia-Astibia et al., 2017; Wierzejska, 2017).
The role of caffeine as a possible protective agent is
supported by the pharmacological action of caffeine blocking
adenosine A2A receptors, which show an aberrant expression
and function in aging and related diseases (Marques et al.,
2011). At the experimental level, long-term caffeine treatment
has been demonstrated to ameliorate cognitive impairment in
animal models of Alzheimer disease: βA-injection mouse models
(Dall’
Igna et al., 2007; Canas et al., 2009) and transgenic mouse
models including APP (Arendash et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2009;
Chu et al., 2012), APP/PS1 (Cao et al., 2011; Han et al., 2013), and
more recently in a tau transgenic model (Laurent et al., 2014).
Most importantly, because among the underlying mechanisms
the reduction of amyloid beta production is postulated (Arendash
et al., 2006). Interestingly, age-like HPA-axis dysfunction has
been related to overactivation of caffeine-binding adenosine
A2A receptors in rats mimicking the upregulation found in the
forebrain of aged and AD patients, and their direct regulatory
action on glucocorticoid receptor function (Batalha et al., 2016).
The main clinical manifestation of dementia is a decline in
cognitive function. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)
are quite prevalent among the patients since early stages of
Alzheimer’
s disease (Reisberg et al., 1987) and show a clear
trend toward increasing their frequency with the progress of the
disease (Piccininni et al., 2005). The symptoms, also referred as
“
Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia”(BPSD),
may include depression, apathy, hallucinations, delusions,
agitation, aggression, and sleep disturbances. This wide array of
NPS or BPSD is considered a strong source of distress and burden
for AD patients and caregivers. The treatment of these NPS is a
major challenge (Wang et al., 2016) as it is the understanding of
the pathophysiology underlying their comorbidity in Alzheimer’
s
disease (e.g., reviewed by Corrêa-Velloso et al., 2018). At the
experimental level, research in animal models of Alzheimer’
s
disease has focused on the cognitive deficits while few of them
have also considered their non-cognitive profile (reviewed by
Giménez-Llort et al., 2007). Since 2006, our laboratory has been
devoted to characterize the cognitive but also the non-cognitive
symptoms (i.e., anxiety, phobias, bizarre behaviors, hyperactivity,
disinhibition, apathy and motivation, persistence of behaviors,
and diurnal rhythm disturbances) in the homozygous 3xTg-
AD mice created by LaFerla (Oddo et al., 2003). As we have
consistently reported (e.g., Giménez-Llort et al., 2006, 2008, 2010;
Baeta-Corral and Giménez-Llort, 2014, 2015; Torres-Lista and
Giménez-Llort, 2014, 2015; Manuel et al., 2016), these animals
show a noticeable BPSD-like profile. Recently, depressive-like
profile has also been reported in the 3xTg-AD mice (Romano
et al., 2015), early symptoms bearing some resemblance to bipolar
disorder have also been noticed (Corrêa-Velloso et al., 2018), and
the effects of preventive/therapeutical strategies on such BPSD-
like symptoms have began to be studied (García-Mesa et al., 2011,
2012; Blázquez et al., 2014; Cañete et al., 2015; Torres-Lista and
Giménez-Llort, 2015; Sabogal-Guáqueta et al., 2017).
In our focus of interest, the 3xTg-AD mice and their non-
transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging may be useful
to investigate whether the aging process or the presence of
an anxiety-like BPSD profile may modify the output of the
potential therapeutic benefits of caffeine. The effects of caffeine
on sensorimotor performance (open field, balance beam, string
agility) and anxiety level [elevated plus-maze (EPM)] have been
addressed by Arendash and Cao (2010), in the APPSwe mice.
In the present work, we explored the effects of a long-term
(7 months) chronic treatment with a very low oral dose of caffeine
(0.3 mg/kg) starting at the adulthood until the middle age (from
6 to 13 months of age) of 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared
to age-matched NTg mice. In the transgenic mice, these ages
correspond to the onset and advanced stages of the disease,
respectively (Oddo et al., 2003). Since adenosine receptors
are involved in neuronal but also non-neuronal mechanisms,
including immunoendocrine responses, the effects of chronic
treatment were assessed on sensorimotor functions, physiology
[body weight (BW), circadian motor activity, and survival],
immunoendocrine system (spleen size and corticosterone), and
behavior (exploratory activity, bizarre movements, emotional

and anxiety-like behaviors, risk assessment, visual perceptual
learning, and reference spatial learning and memory). The effects
of caffeine on other BPSD such as apathy/depression were
indirectly monitored by means of opposed behaviors [exploration
in the activity tests (ACT), floating in the Morris water maze
(MWM)] and tests [hole-board (HB) for novelty seeking, cue
learning with a visual platform in the water maze].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Homozygous

harboring
PS1/M146V, APPSwe, and tauP301L transgenes were genetically
engineered at the University of California, Irvine, as previously
described
(Oddo
et
al.,
2003).
Briefly,
two
independent
transgenes (encoding human APPSwe and human tauP301L, both
under control of the mouse Thy1.2 regulatory element) were
co-injected into single-cell embryos harvested from homozygous
mutant PS1M146V knock-in (PS1KI) mice. The PS1 knock-in
mice were originally generated as a hybrid C57BL/6 x 129.
Thirty-eight 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice and C57BL/6 x 129
mice from 15 l of a breeding program that was established
in our laboratory at the Medical Psychology Unit, Universitat
Autònoma de Barcelona, were used in this study. All the animals
were housed three to four per cage and maintained (Makrolon,
35 × 35 × 25 cm) under standard laboratory conditions (12 h
light:dark, cycle starting at 8:00 h, food and water available
ad libitum, 22 ± 2◦C, 50–
60% humidity). The circadian activity
was recorded during one whole light–
dark (LD) period, and the
rest of the tests from 9:00 to 13:00 h.

(Kilkenny et al., 2010) and the Spanish legislation on “
Protection
of Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes”
and the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU)
on this subject. The protocol CEEAH 2481/DMAH 8700
entitled “
Risk factors and preventive/therapeutical strategies in
Alzheimer’
s disease: studies in triple-transgenic 3xTg-AD mice”
was approved by Departament de Medi Ambient i Habitatge,
Generalitat de Catalunya.
Caffeine Treatment
Mice were allowed to consume ad libitum either drinking water
or caffeinated drinking water at 0.3 mg/ml (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, United States) beginning at 6 months of age, considered
the age of onset of cognitive symptoms in this animal model.
The experimental design consisted in the following groups: NTg
vehicle, NTg caffeine, Tg vehicle, and Tg caffeine (n = 8–
10,
in each group). Caffeine treatment was continued throughout
behavioral testing until the end of the experiment (13 months of
age).
It has been previously confirmed that this treatment regimen
leads to a 1.5 mg daily dose in a mouse and it is equivalent to
an approximately 500 mg daily caffeine intake (approximately
five cups of coffee) by a human (Johansson et al., 1996;
Arendash et al., 2006). A plasma concentration of caffeine about
30 µM (circa three cups of coffee daily) has been recommended
to probe the beneficial effects of caffeine on cognition (Costenla
et al., 2010).
Behavioral Assessments
The effects of the chronic caffeine treatment on physical and
behavioral profile of 3xTg-AD mice and their NTg counterparts
were assessed at 13 months of age, considered advanced stages
of disease in this animal model. The battery of behavioral tests
consisted in the evaluation of sensorimotor functions and a
series of classical unconditioned tasks measuring locomotion
and exploratory activity, anxiety-like behaviors, and cognitive
functions.
Day 1. Corner Test (CT) and Open-Field (OF) Test
Neophobia was evaluated in the corner test (CT) for 30 s. Animals
were individually placed in the center of a clean standard home
cage, filled with wood shave bedding. Number of corners visited,
latency to realize the first rearing, and the number of rearings
were recorded.
Immediately after the CT, mice were placed in the center of an
open field (homemade woodwork, white box, 50 × 50 × 20 cm)
and observed for 5 min. The temporal profile of the following
sequence of behavioral events was recorded: duration of freezing
behavior, latency to leave the central square and that of entering
the peripheral ring, as well as latency and total duration of
self-grooming behavior. Horizontal (crossings of 10 × 10 cm
squares) and vertical (rearings with a wall support) locomotor
activities were also measured. Bizarre behaviors observed in
this test were also measured according to the previous reported
criterion (Baeta-Corral and Giménez-Llort, 2014). During the
tests, defecation boli and urination were also recorded.
Day 2. Hole-Board (HB) Test
Mice were placed in the center of the apparatus (woodwork white
box of 32 × 32 × 32 cm) with four holes (3 cm diameter)
equally spaced in the floor of the HB. In the exploratory
behavior, non-goal-directed (rearings) and goal-directed (head-
dips) exploratory activities were measured for 5 min. Moreover,
the time spent head-dipping, the latencies of first movement, first
dipping, and to explore the four different holes (this last one
was established as criterion of the four holes exploration) were
also measured. Repetition of already visited holes before reaching
the criterion was considered as errors and the total number was
measured. Defecation boli were also recorded.
Day 3. Dark–Light Box (DLB) Test
The dark–
light box (DLB) test (Panlab, S.L., Barcelona,
Spain) consists of a two-compartment box (black and dark,
27 × 18 × 27 cm; white and illuminated 20 W, 27 × 27 × 27 cm)
connected by an opening (7 × 7 cm). The mice were placed into
the dark compartment and observed for 5 min. Latency to enter
into the lit compartment (all four paws criterion), number of
entries, total time spent, and distance covered as well as number
of rearings and groomings in this compartment were noted. Risk
assessment was measured by means of the latency and number

of stretch attendances toward the lit area. Defecation boli and
urination in each of both compartments were measured.
Day 4. Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) Test
The plus-maze (woodwork, black Plexiglass) consisted of two
enclosed arms (EAs, 30.3 × 5.3 × 15 cm, transparent walls) and
two open arms (OAs, 30.3 × 5 cm) forming a square cross with
a 5.3 × 5 cm square center piece. The apparatus was elevated
40 cm above the floor. The animal was placed in the center of
the plus-maze facing one of the OAs. The number of entries (all
four paws criterion) into OA and EA, the time spent in each arm,
and defecation boli were recorded for 5 min. The anxiety index
TOA/(TOA+TEA) was calculated as time in the OA/(time in the
OA + time in the EA).
Day 5. T-Maze (TM) Test
The apparatus consists in a T-shaped maze (two short arms
of 25 × 8 cm and a long arm of 30 × 8 cm). The working
memory paradigm assessed in the T-maze (TM) consisted in two
consecutive trials: one forced choice in the first trial and one
free choice (recall trial) in the second trial, with a 90-s intertrial
interval. In the forced choice, only one of the arms according to a
random order and contrabalanced in each group was accessible.
The animal was placed inside the “
vertical”arm of the maze with
its head facing the end wall and it was allowed to explore the
maze. After spending 20 s in the accessible arm, the animal was
put back into the home cage starting box. This 20 s period was
established as the learning criterion. In the recall trial, the animal
was allowed to explore the maze in a free choice trial where both
arms were accessible. The arm chosen by the mice and the time
spent in each arm during the free choice was recorded. The choice
of the already visited arm in the previous trial before exploring
the arm that was inaccessible was considered as an error and the
total number was calculated. Also the time spent to explore the
three arms of the maze was recorded. Finally, defecation boli and
urination were also recorded.
Day 6. Marble Test (MB)
The procedure for marble test (MB) was adopted with minor
modifications from that originally described by Broekkamp et al.
(1986). Mice were placed individually in a standard home cage
(Macrolon, 35 × 35 × 25 cm). The cage contained six glass
marbles (dimensions 1 × 1 × 1 cm) evenly spaced making a
triangle (three rows of three, two, and one marbles per row only
in the left area of the cage) on a 5-cm thick layer of sawdust.
The mice were left in the cage with marbles for a 30-min period
after which the test was terminated by removing the mice and
counting the number of marbles: intact (the number of marbles
untouched), rotated (the number of marbles rotated 90◦ or 180◦),
half-buried (the number of marbles at least 1/
2 buried by sawdust),
and buried (the number of marbles 100% buried by sawdust).
Day 7. Body Weight (BW) and Sensorimotor
Functions (SMT)
The physical condition of the mice was evaluated by their BW
and sensorimotor functions. Visual reflex and posterior legs
extension reflex were measured three times by holding the animal
by its tail and slowly lowering it toward a black surface. Motor
coordination and equilibrium were assessed twice (20-s trials) in
two consecutive rod tasks of increasing difficulty. The distance
covered and the latency to fall off a wooden (1.3 cm wide) and a
metal wire (1 cm diameter) rod (both, 1 m long) were recorded.
The hanger test was used to measure prehensibility and motor
coordination by the distance covered and the number of elements
of support and the latency to fall. The animal was allowed to cling
with its forepaws from the middle of a horizontal wire (2 mm
diameter, 40 cm length, divided into eight 5 cm segments) for
two trials of 5 s. A third trial of 60 s was used to complement
these measures with that of muscle strength or resistance. All the
apparatus were suspended 40 cm above a padded table.
Days 8–15. Circadian Motor Activity Test (ACT)
Three mice per day were tested for 23 consecutive hours
(beginning at 15.00 h, periods of 30 min) in a multicage activity
meter system (three cages simultaneously, Actitrack, Panlab, S.L.,
Barcelona, Spain) set to measure spontaneous locomotor activity.
Each testing cage (Macrolon, 35.3 × 35.3 × 25 cm) contained
clean sawdust and had food and water available. Weight of
animals was recorded before and after the test. Food intake (FI)
also was measured.
Days 16–21. Morris Water Maze (MWM) Test
Animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the
MWM test consisting of 1 day of cue learning and 4 days of
place learning for spatial reference memory, followed by one
probe trial. Mice were trained to locate a hidden platform (7 cm
diameter, 1 cm below the water surface) in a circular pool for
mice (Intex Recreation Corp., Long Beach, CA, United States;
91 cm diameter, 40 cm height, 25◦C opaque water), located in
a completely black painted 6 m2 test room. Mice failing to find
the platform were placed on it for 10 s, the same period as the
successful animals. The protocol (Giménez-Llort et al., 2007) was
used as follows: 1 day of cue learning, 4 days of place learning
followed by a probe trial.
Cue learning with a visible platform
On the first day, the animals were tested for the cue learning
of a visual platform consisting of four trials in 1 day. In each
trial, the mouse was gently released (facing the wall) from one
randomly selected starting point (E or W) and allowed to swim
until it escaped onto the platform, elevated 1 cm above the water
level in the N position and indicated by a visible striped flag
(5.3 × 8.3 × 15 cm). Extra maze cues were absent in the black
painted walls of the room.
Place learning with a hidden platform
On the following day, the place learning task consisted of four
trial sessions per day for 4 days with trials spaced 30 min
apart. The mouse was gently released (facing the wall) from one
randomly selected starting point (E or W, as these are equidistant
from the target) and allowed to swim until escaped onto the
hidden platform which was now located in the middle of the S
quadrant. Mice that failed to find the platform within 60 s were
placed on it for 10 s, the same period as was allowed for the

successful animals. White geometric figures, one hung on each
wall of the room, were used as external visual clues.
Probe trial
One hour thirty minutes after the last trial of the place learning
task, the platform was removed from the maze and the mice
performed a “
probe trial”of 60 s to evaluate their spatial memory
for the platform position.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses
Behavior was evaluated by both direct observation and analysis
of videotape-recorded images. Variables of time (escape latency,
quadrant preference), distance covered, and swimming speed
were analyzed in all the trials of the tasks. The escape latency
was readily measured with a stopwatch by an observer unaware
of the animal’
s genotype and confirmed during the subsequent
video-tracking analysis. A video camera placed above the
water maze recorded the animal’
s behavior and thereafter an
automated system (Smart, Panlab S.L., Barcelona, Spain) enabled
computerized measurement of the distance traveled by the
animal during the trials. The swimming speed (cm/s) of the mice
during each trial was calculated. In the probe trial, the time spent
in each of the four quadrants, the distance traveled along them,
and the number of crossings over the removed platform position
(annulus crossings) were also measured retrospectively by means
of the automated video-tracking analysis.
Finally, the swim paths for each mouse in each trial of the cue
learning task, place learning task, and probe trial were analyzed
following the swimming strategies described by Janus (2004) and
classified according to three criteria: the objective (non-search
behaviors, namely floating and circling, vs. search strategies),
the direction (goal-directed vs. non-goal-directed strategies), and
the variety (single vs. mixed strategies) (see Baeta-Corral and
Giménez-Llort, 2015).
Survival and Immunoendocrine Status
Mortality was recorded from 6 to 13 months of age. The effects
of caffeine on the neuroimmunoendocrine status (Giménez-
Llort et al., 2014) were monitored by means of the levels of
corticosterone and the size (weight in milligram) and relative
size (% vs. BW) of the spleen (Giménez-Llort et al., 2008).
Splenomegaly was used as a physical indicator of the altered
status of the peripheral immune system in 3xTg-AD mice
(Giménez-Llort et al., 2012; Marchese et al., 2014).
Mice were sacrificed and samples of about 0.5 ml of
whole trunk blood were collected into heparinized tubes and
centrifugated immediately at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The
plasma obtained was stored at −20◦C. Corticosterone content
(nanogram per milliliter) was analyzed using a commercial kit
(Corticosterone EIA Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd., Boldon,
United Kingdom) and ELISA EMS Reader MF V.29.-0.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 software. All
data are presented as mean ± SEM or percentage. To evaluate
the effects of genotype and caffeine treatment a 2 × 2 factorial
analysis design was applied. Differences were studied through
Multivariate General Lineal model analysis, followed by post hoc
Duncan’
s test comparisons. P < 0.05 was taken as statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Figures 1–
7 summarize the behavioral phenotype exhibited by
male 3xTg-AD and NTg at 13 months of age and the effects of
caffeine on these behaviors.
Corner Test (CT)
Genotype
and
treatment
effects
were
found
in
the
CT
(Figures 1A–C). Horizontal locomotor activity measured by
number of corners visited was reduced in the 3xTg-AD mice
[G, F(1,30) = 4.760; p < 0.05] as compared to the NTg
animals. Vertical activity was influenced by caffeine, with treated
animals showing higher latencies to perform a first rearing
[T, F(1,30) = 4.676; p < 0.05] and a reduction in the total number
of rearings [T, F(1,30) = 4.571; p < 0.05].
Open-Field Test
Genotype differences were found in the ethogram (Figure 1D),
the behavioral sequence of events, pointing out to increased
thigmotaxis. 3xTg-AD animals spent more time leaving the
center of the apparatus [G, t(1,14) = −2.785; p < 0.05] and
arriving at the periphery [G, F(1,30) = 4.366; p < 0.05].
Caffeine increased the time spent in the center in NTg+caff
animals whereas it was reduced in the 3xTg-AD group [GxT,
F(1,30) = 4.936; p < 0.05]. Once the animals arrived to
the periphery, self-grooming behavior was delayed in time
in NTg+caff mice as compared to their control group [T,
F(1,30) = 7.158; p < 0.05 and GxT, F(1,30) = 8.194;
p < 0.01] although the total duration of self-grooming (NTg-Veh:
2.25 s ± 0.48; NTg-Caff: 1.00 s ± 0.50; Tg-Veh: 1.50 s ± 0.50;
Tg-Caff: 1.75 s ± 0.52) was not modified.
Regarding the locomotor activity (Figures 1E–H), 3xTg-AD
mice showed a reduced number of crossings as compared to NTg
animals [G, F(1,30) = 12.132; p < 0.01]. Moreover, caffeine had
a bidirectional effect increasing this horizontal component in
the NTg genotype whereas reducing it in the 3xTg-AD treated
animals [minute 4; GxT, F(1,30) = 8.994; p < 0.01]. In the vertical
activity, 3xTg-AD mice showed a reduced number of rearings as
compared to the NTg mice [G, F(1,30) = 10.944 p < 0.01]. No
stereotyped rearing was observed in NTg mice (NTg-Veh: none)
and their presence was scarce in the other groups (NTg-Caff:
0.33 ± 0.30; Tg-Veh: 0.17 ± 0.10; Tg-Caff: 1.25 s ± 0.90).
Finally, the NTg+caff group showed an increase in defecation
behavior whereas it was reduced in the 3xTg-AD+caff group
[(NTg-Veh: 2.00 s ± 0.20; NTg-Caff: 3.50 ± 0.20; Tg-Veh:
3.67 ± 1.0; Tg-Caff: 2.50 ± 0.62) GxT, F(1,30) = 4.681; p < 0.05].
Hole-Board Test
Significant changes in the exploratory activity were detected in
the HB test (Figures 2A–D) All groups showed similar latencies
in the first movement and to explore the first hole. The reduction
in the exploratory activity in the 3xTg-AD groups was the most
significant difference observed in this test [G, F(1,30) = 13.492;

[T, F(1,30) = 5.290; p < 0.05]. The 3xTg-AD groups performed
more head dippings [G, F(1,30) = 4.750; p < 0.05] and total time
spent in this activity was higher as compared to the NTg groups
[G, F(1.30) = 4.818; p < 0.05]. Hundred percent of the 3xTg-

especially in the 3xTg-AD mice [GxT, F(1,30) = 6.365; p < 0.05].
Dark–Light Box Test
Stretch attendance activity (Figures 2E,F) was present in NTg
but not in 3xTg-AD mice [G, F(1,30) = 17.690; p < 0.001] and
caffeine increased the latency of stretch attendance in the NTg
mice [T, F(1,30) = 11.842; p < 0.01 and GxT, F(1,30) = 11.842;
p < 0.01].
The incidence of animals that entered into the lit area ranged
50–
70% in the NTg mice and increased to the 90–
100% in the
3xTg-AD mice [G, F(1,30) = 9.098; p < 0.01]. The disinhibitory
behavior of the 3xTg-AD groups was shown as a reduced latency
to enter into the lit area [Figure 4B; G, F(1,30) = 4.859; p < 0.05],
more than double of crossings between the two compartments
[G, t(1,14) = −3.049; p < 0.01], and less time into the lit area [G,
F(1,30) = 4.158; p < 0.05].
Finally, a genotype and a genotype × treatment interaction
effect was found in total defecation [G, F(1,30) = 4.158; p < 0.05
and GxT, F(1,30) = 6.794; p < 0.05, respectively].
Elevated Plus Maze
The latency to enter into the OA [G, F(1,30) = 20.029; p < 0.001]
and the anxiety index TOA/(TOA+TEA) [G, F(1,30) = 43.619;
p < 0.001] indicated that 3xTg-AD animals were more anxious
than NTg mice (Figures 2G,H). All groups showed a similar
number of entries in all the arms and the central piece
[all Fs(1,30) < 3.583; p > 0.068, n.s.]. A genotype and
a genotype × treatment interaction effects were found in
defecation behavior [G, F(1,30) = 4.536; p < 0.05 and GxT,
F(1,30) = 6.648; p < 0.05, respectively].
T-Maze Test
In the forced trial, 3xTg-AD groups spent less time to reach the
intersection point of the TM [G, F(1,30) = 5.729; p < 0.05] and to
reach the criterion of the 20 s exploration [G, F(1,30) = 56.375;
p < 0.05]. In the recall, the number of errors before choosing
the unexplored arm in the previous trial was lower in the
3xTg-AD genotype [G, F(1,30) = 6.111; p < 0.05]. However,
3xTg-AD-treated animals reduced their efficiency to explore
both arms since they spent more time to reach the goal [GxT,
F(1,30) = 4.188; p < 0.05] (Figures 3A–D).
Marble Test
The 3xTg-AD mice buried a higher number of marbles [G,
F(1,28) = 20.802; p < 0.001] whereas NTg animals left them intact
[G, F(1,28) = 8.660; p < 0.01]. Caffeine reduced the number of
marbles buried in the 3xTg-AD genotype [GxT, F(1,28) = 5.565;
p < 0.05] (Figure 3E).
Body Weight and Sensorimotor Functions
At 6 months of age, before the treatment was started, the 3xTg-
AD mice were overweighed (+20.26%) [t, F(1,32) = −5.603,
p < 0.000]. The genotype effect was maintained till the end of
the treatment (+20.09%) [G, F(1,30) = 68.826; p < 0.001].
At 13 months of age, the genotype × treatment interaction
effects [GxT, F(1,30) = 7.383; p < 0.05] pointed out a reduction of
the BW induced by caffeine in the 3xTg-AD animals (Duncan’
s
test, p < 0.05 vs. 3xTg-AD+veh group) but the treatment did not
correct the overweight of 3xTg-AD mice (Duncan’
s test, p < 0.05
vs. NTg+caff).
In the sensory-motor functions, no deficits were found in the
reflexes assessed, with all the animals obtaining the maximum
score. In the wood rod test, most animals petrified (no distance

covered) and this response determined a high latency to fall.
Still, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited longer latencies to fall than NTg
animals [G, F(1,30) = 12.037; p < 0.01]. Caffeine increased the
latency to fall in the NTg genotype [T, F(1,30) = 4.841; p < 0.05].
When the complexity of the task was increased (metal wire
test) all groups showed worse equilibrium, but no differences
were found between the groups neither in the latency to fall
nor in the distance covered. In the Hanger test, the 5 s trial
showed genotype-dependent differences in the latency to fall [G,
F(1,30) = 7.879; p < 0.01]. This effect was confirmed in the 60 s
trial [G, F(1,30) = 6.561; p < 0.05] (Figures 4A–E).
Circadian Motor Activity Test
A circadian temporal course was found in the 23 h motor
activity period studied [t, F(23,690) = 29.732; p < 0.001] that
differed between genotype [txG, F(23,690) = 4.570; p < 0.001],
treatment [txT, F(23,690) = 5.360; p < 0.001], and the
interaction between these two factors [txGxT, F(23,690) = 2.858;
p < 0.001] (Figure 5A). During the first hour of habituation,
time [t, F(11,330) = 78.341; p < 0.001] and genotype
[G, F(11,330) = 9.395; p < 0.01] effects were found. Besides,
“
time × genotype” [txG, F(11,330) = 7.984; p < 0.001],
“
time × treatment”[txT, F(11,330) = 2.591; p < 0.01], and
“
time × genotype × treatment” [txGxT, F(11,330) = 4.083;
p < 0.001] interaction effects were found (Figure 5B) with
treated 3xTg-AD mice showing a reduced locomotor activity as
compared to their non-treated group.
3xTg-AD+veh mice showed a reduced total motor activity
[G, t(1,15) = 6.591; p < 0.01]. Caffeine increased the overall
spontaneous motor activity along a 23-h LD period in the 3xTg-
AD genotype [Figure 5C; GxT, F(1,30) = 11.525; p < 0.01],
and more significantly, during the dark cycle [Figure 5E;
F(1,30) = 15.311; p < 0.001].
Morris Water Maze Test
Figures 6A–C illustrate the “
day-by-day”(left panel) and “
trial-
by-trial”(right panels) acquisition curves.
In the cue learning task (Figure 6A, CUE), genotype and
treatment effects were found, with 3xTg-AD mice reaching the
visible platform faster than NTg [G, F(1,30) = 17.727; p < 0.001].
Independently of the genotype, treated animals spent more time
[T, F(1,30) = 30.891; p < 0.001] and showed longer distance
covered [T, F(1,30) = 28.171; p < 0.001] to find the platform than
non-treated mice. 3xTg-AD mice showed an increased swimming
speed [G, F(1,30) = 68.397; p < 0.001] and caffeine increased
the swimming speed in both treated groups [T, F(1,30) = 5.394;
p < 0.05].
In the place learning task (PT), when the cue was removed
and the platform was hidden, animals exhibited a different
genotype- and treatment-dependent acquisition curves, with
3xTg-AD animals finding faster the hidden platform along the
4 days of the test [G, F(1,30) = 6.920; p < 0.05]. Caffeine increased
the time spent [T, F(1,30) = 11.449; p < 0.01] and the distance
covered [T, F(1,30) = 15.566; p < 0.001] to reach the platform as
compared to their non-treated groups. Swimming speed showed
a consistent genotype effect [G, F(1,30) = 21.239; p < 0.001].
Caffeine modified the swimming speed in an opposite manner,
since it was increased in the NTg and reduced in the 3xTg-AD
animals [GxT, F(1,30) = 9.540; p < 0.05].

[Figures 6A–C, right panels; RMA, F(3,90) > 2.984; p < 0.05].
Between all the differences found, it is interesting to note that
caffeine effects were found both in long-term (T1) and short-
term (T3 and T4) memory trials. The acquisition level achieved
at the end of the place task (distance PT4 and PT4.4) was similar
in all the groups [G and T, F(1,30) < 1.631; p > 0.05, n.s.].
In the probe trial (Figure 6D), all the groups showed similar
ability to distinguish the platform quadrant during the place
task [all ANOVAs, F(3,28) > 25.522; p < 0.001] despite the
NTg+caff group did it with one or two lower scale [all ANOVAs,

∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001 vs. the corresponding non-treated group.
Qualitative analysis of the non-search behaviors and search
strategies allowed to find caffeine effects (Figure 7) based on
the distinctive characteristics of both genotypes: presence of
floating and the use of “
single-”and “
goal-directed”strategies
in the NTg genotype in contrast to “
circling” and “
mixed”
and “
non-goal-directed” strategies in the 3xTg-AD mice.
Caffeine modified these swimming patterns, reducing differences
between genotypes. Thus, the NTg+caff group showed a
higher proportion of “
mixed”and “
non-goal-directed”strategies
whereas the 3xTg-AD group showed more “
single-”and “
goal-
directed”strategies.
Moreover, in the cue learning task, caffeine reduced the
incidence of floating [T, F(1,30) = 7.660; p < 0.01] and increased
the incidence of “
thigmotaxis”(test exacte de Fisher; p < 0.05) in
both treated groups.
In the probe trial, all the vehicle animals (100%) swam
“
directly” to the platform quadrant during the place task,
whereas nearly 50% of the 3xTg-AD+caff animals used “
random
search.”When the animals failed to find the platform, NTg+veh
mice alternated different strategies. In contrast, 3xTg-AD mice
persisted in their behavior. A higher variety of strategies was
shown by both genotypes of treated animals.

However, the differences were not significant when analyzed
statistically.
The weight of the spleen was increased in 3xTg-AD mice
[G, F(1,30) = 6.549; p < 0.05]. In the treated groups,
caffeine showed a tendency to reduce the weight of the spleen
[T, F(1,30) = 2.721; p = 0.109, n.s.]. In 3xTg-AD+caff mice, this
reduction was sufficient to restore the normal weight of the
spleen [G, t(1,16) = −1.145; p = 0.269, n.s. vs. the control group
NTg+veh] (Figure 4F).
Corticosterone levels showed slight increases due to genotype
[G, F(1,30) = 1.983; p = 0.169, n.s.] that did not reach
statistical significance. If any, treatment [T, F(1,30) = 0.728;

mice.
DISCUSSION
This study analyzes, in a translational scenario, the long-term
effects of a chronic low dose of caffeine started at the onset of
disease (6 months of age) in 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model
for Alzheimer’
s disease characterized by cognitive but also BPSD-
like profile (Giménez-Llort et al., 2006). The behavioral effects
were assessed at advanced stages (13 month of age) when both
amyloid and tau pathologies are present (Oddo et al., 2003). At
this age, we have consistently reported that survival male 3xTg-
AD mice starts to be compromised (Giménez-Llort et al., 2008,
2010; García-Mesa et al., 2016; Torres-Lista et al., 2017). Effects
were compared to age-matched NTg mice with normal aging,
that according to the background strain represent overcoming
the middle age. The results showed significant effects of caffeine
in most of the variables, especially those related to neophobia

and other anxiety-like behaviors, emotionality, and cognitive
flexibility. Thus, anxiogenic effects were seen in middle-aged
animals and that effect, in the 3xTg-AD model, resulted in an
aggravation of its BPSD-like pattern. The groups treated with
caffeine did not improve their long-term memory until they
completed the behavioral spatial reference memory paradigm in
the water maze, and the short-term memory, in any case, was
disadvantaged. It was only in the second time interval of the
probe trial, where the 3xTg-AD group treated with caffeine was
able to use search strategies similar to those exhibited by both
groups of NTg mice. In addition, the behavioral analysis pointed
at distinct genotype-dependent functional capacity of caffeine-
treated animals to meet task-dependent performance demands.
Thus, selective effects of caffeine for the 3xTg-AD genotype were

observed in the increase of the circadian motor activity and the
reduction of body and spleen weights, indicators of the functional
and neuroimmune status. Caffeine also exerted bidirectional
effects: stimulating motor activity in NTg mice in the open-
field (OF) test but reducing it in the 3xTg-AD; increasing the
emotionality of NTg mice and decreasing it in the 3xTg-AD in the
OF, EPM, and HB; and finally, modifying the navigation strategies
in the learning tasks of the MWM, making them more similar.
The anxiogenic effects induced by caffeine were observed, in
general, as an increase of neophobia and the anxious profile.

(thigmotaxis) in the OF, and the delay in the risk assessment
activity in the DLB demonstrated these anxiogenic effects. The
increase in defecation observed in the NTg+caff group suggests
an increased emotionality induced by caffeine. These results
agree with those obtained in animals treated with high doses
of caffeine, which were more emotionally reactive and showed
more immobility, defecation, and urination than control animals
(Anderson and Hughes, 2008). In 3xTg-AD animals, increased
anxiety profile induced by chronic caffeine treatment led to a
worsening BPSD pattern, where the behavioral response varied
depending on the level of anxiety that each test involves.
In this regard, direct exposure to an open and illuminated
field caused a reduction in motor activity, almost completely.
Conversely, in mild stressful environments such as the case of
the motor ACT, the anxious response was reflected as an increase
in the hyperactive pattern characteristic of 3xTg-AD animals

Baeta-Corral et al.
Chronic Caffeine Worsens 3xTg-AD Mice BPSD
(Giménez-Llort et al., 2007). In the cue learning task of the
MWM, this increase of the hyperactivity pattern induced by
caffeine was also observed as an increase in the swimming speed
as compared to the 3xTg-AD+veh group, that may explain the
reduction of floating behavior. The stimulating effects of caffeine
at the motor level were observed in NTg animals as an increase
in the number of crossings in the OF and the swimming speed in
the learning tasks of the MWM. As expected (i.e., Nehlig et al.,
1992), this stimulatory effect of the horizontal motor activity
was in decrement to the vertical activity, considered the variable
that better reflects the exploratory behavior per se (Colorado
et al., 2006). Therefore, caffeine exerted its effects increasing
hyperactivity (locomotion) and reducing vertical exploratory
behavior.
As introduced before, here it is interesting to note that a
depressive-like profile paired to monoaminergic alterations has
been recently reported in the 3xTg-AD mice using two models
of stress-coping behavior (FST, Porsolt forced swim test, and
Tail suspension test) and with an anhedonia test such as the
sucrose preference test (Romano et al., 2015). In the current
study, the effects of caffeine on behavioral despair were not
directly addressed, i.e., using the forced swim test in order to
avoid carry on effects on the MWM. Also, because in our hands
3xTg-AD mice showed a persistence of behaviors in the FST that
interfered with the interpretation of the performances (Torres-
Lista and Giménez-Llort, 2014, 2015). Instead, the presence of
immobility (floating) was taken into account in all the trials
in the maze (as described in Baeta-Corral and Giménez-Llort,
2015) and the “
Cue learning with a visible platform”was a
specific paradigm used to control lack of motivation as well
as sensorimotor differences. Besides, the effect of caffeine on
other variables such as exploration in the ACTs and more
specifically the performance in the HB test for novelty seeking
was among the studied behaviors as opposed to the expression of
apathy/depressive symptoms.
Regarding sensorimotor functions, the results obtained in
the balance of 3xTg-AD mice cannot exclude the presence of a
false positive, since the innate fear of heights made that group
showing more petrifaction (i.e., genotype 3xTg-AD treated with
caffeine) were those that stayed longer on the rod. This is in
agreement with prior results obtained at the same age, in female
3xTg-AD mice (Giménez-Llort et al., 2007). In contrast, in
NTg animals that roam the rod, caffeine improved balance but
worsened muscle resistance in this genotype. Similar results were
also obtained by our laboratory in the behavioral assessment A1
receptor knockout mice (Giménez-Llort et al., 2002), a genetic
strategy to emulate the chronic effects of caffeine (Johansson
et al., 2001).
It has been shown that chronic caffeine treatment prevents
weight gain in rodents that were fed a high fat diet (Moy and
McNay, 2013). In the present work, the long-term treatment with
a low dose of caffeine modified, but not corrected, the overweight
of 3xTg-AD mice. We have already shown that overweight is a
characteristic of the Spanish colony of 3xTg-AD mice, since onset
of disease (Giménez-Llort et al., 2010), it is related to a higher
relative contribution of white adipose tissue (WAT) (Giménez-
Llort et al., 2010; García-Mesa et al., 2011, 2012) and could not
be corrected by health strategies such as forced (Giménez-Llort
et al., 2010) or voluntary exercise (García-Mesa et al., 2011). In
the present work, the increase in the nocturnal activity found in
3xTg-AD+caff mice could explain their weight loss.
The MWM showed that the increased latency, distance,
and speed that chronic caffeine indiscriminately exerts over
both genotypes in the cue learning task does not correspond
to the expected cognitive effects, quite the contrary. In the
first experience in the maze, the benefits attributed to caffeine
improving attention (Griffiths et al., 1990), did not confer any
advantage to the animals in this learning task, considered as
a visual perceptive learning. In the following three trials for
short-term memory, the effects were also contrary to those
expected, since caffeine increased the distance covered to reach
the platform. In the second paradigm, the place learning task,
increased speed in the NTg group and decreased in the 3xTg-AD
could emulate stimulant and depressant effects of low and high
doses of caffeine, respectively (Fredholm et al., 1999). Thus, the
chronic low-dose (0.3 mg/kg) acted exhilarating swimming speed
in the NTg group, while in 3xTg-AD mice –which consistently
show a higher speed than NTg animals –the reduction induced
by caffeine may be the result of a depressant drug effect. Although
it seems that caffeine improved short-term memory because it did
so in a pair of trials, this fact could be considered exceptional in
the face of nine trials in which the effects of caffeine involved
a significantly worse execution. At the end of this task, all
experimental groups reached the same level of acquisition and
in the probe trial, conducted after 1 h 30 min, all of them
also showed the same ability to remember the position of the
final platform. Still, the NTg+caff group did so with one or
two lower orders of magnitude. Considering that in the first
trials of everyday, quantitative values between NTg and 3xTg-
AD were more distinct, it is likely that a 24-h probe trial
would have been more suitable to detect cognitive differences. In
general, quantitative results show that, under these experimental
conditions, cognitive outcomes were strongly conditioned by
the genotype differences in swimming speed or the hyperactive
profile shown in our 3xTg-AD colony.
The anxiogenic conditions that the MWM represents for
mice were also reflected in the high level of floating observed
in NTg animals and the sustained increase in the speed of
3xTg-AD mice. As we have extensively discussed in a precedent
report’
(Baeta-Corral and Giménez-Llort, 2015), this means that
in this colony of 3xTg-AD mice, the MWM may probably not
be specific to assess hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits
related to spatial memory, as in other models for AD (i.e.,
Arendash et al., 2009). In this mice model, the MWM may involve
the assessment of cognition under anxiogenic conditions and
therefore the measurement of emotional memory depending on
limbic system. Therefore, the anxiogenic effects of caffeine may
have counteracted the potential cognitive effects in both visual
perceptive (cue learning task) and spatial (place learning task)
learning and memory tasks. The fact that the acquisition curve
of the 3xTg-AD animals showed an even better performance
than NTg mice reminds us of the results obtained in this colony
of animals in the conditioned fear test (España et al., 2010). In
that work, not only the 3xTg-AD model but also APPSwe and

Chronic Caffeine Worsens 3xTg-AD Mice BPSD
APPSwe/ind models showed an enhanced contextual conditioned
fear response that was dependent on their respective levels of
accumulation of βA in the basolateral amygdala.
The possible masking that the presence of flotation could exert
on the measures of latency and distance was also considered. The
analysis of these variables including the time invested in flotation
indicated that results did not differ from those obtained when
the total floating time was excluded. Regarding this “
non-search
behavior,”caffeine reduced the incidence of floating in the cue
learning task in both genotypes. This action could be explained
by its effects increasing attention or motivation in this learning
and memory visual perceptive task. The effects of increasing the
incidence of “
thigmotaxis,”that is a non-goal-directed swimming
around the wall of the pool, would be consistent with the
horizontal locomotor hyperactivity induced by caffeine in the OF.
In order to better understand the results shown in the
MWM, we analyzed the swimming strategies developed along
the different trials of the three paradigms (Baeta-Corral and
Giménez-Llort, 2015). The detailed analysis of strategies unveiled
traits that allowed to distinguish both genotypes: single- and
goal-directed strategies in NTg animals but mixed and non-goal-
directed in the 3xTg-AD ones. In the present work, caffeine
decreased genotype differences in learning and memory tests,
because the NTg-treated animals showed mixed and non-goal-
directed strategies and, conversely, the 3xTg-AD exhibited single-
and goal-directed strategies attributed to a normal pattern.
Therefore, behaviors that were previously easy discriminated,
now were more similar.
In the probe trial, two intervals could be distinguished: the
first section of navigation until the animals arrive to the previous
location of the platform, and the remaining interval in which
the animals could look for it or not in a new location. While in
the first interval, all animals, 3xTg-AD and NTg, swam directly
to the platform, caffeine treatment reduced in 50% the use of
this strategy in the 3xTg-AD+caff group. In the second interval
could be hypothesized that the animals are facing a problem
similar to the first day of the place task, with the exception that
now there have already fulfilled the acquisition process. Here,
the 3xTg-AD mice showed a poor cognitive flexibility using
steadily a single strategy, which could be considered an inefficient
response to solve this situation. Interestingly, we have reported
poor cognitive flexibility shown as persistence of behaviors in the
forced swim test at more advanced stages of disease (17 months
of age) (Torres-Lista and Giménez-Llort, 2014). In this sense,
it is important to note that caffeine increased the variety of
strategies in the 3xTg-AD group suggesting improved cognitive
integration processes that may be taking part in the resolution of
the problem.
Regarding mortality data in this study, the number of animals
is far from the minimum necessary to reliably assess the degree
of survival and the effects of caffeine on it. Still, what our
results suggest is that the data are congruent with the increased
vulnerability of male 3xTg-AD mice at neuroimunoendocrine
level, that could explain an important 40% of mortality at 12–
13 months of age (Giménez-Llort et al., 2008) that can reach
100% at 15 month of age (García-Mesa et al., 2016). The observed
mortality in the NTg+caff group would be in agreement with
the reduced survival curve we reported in A1 knockout mice
(Giménez-Llort et al., 2002). While health benefits of caffeine
and coffee are increasingly recognized, there are also notable
reports of adverse effects of especially high-dose caffeine (Jain
et al., 2017), including a case report of psychotic symptoms in a
patient with dementia (Golden et al., 2015). The neurochemical
scenario produced by long-term loss of A1 and A2a receptor
function has been addressed in A1 (Johansson et al., 2001) and
A2a (Ledent et al., 1997) knockout mice. Perhaps adverse effects
can be sufficiently avoided by partial receptor blockade by low
doses. Already now, there is reason to consider caffeine intake in
patients with BPSD and its reduction in difficult-to-treat cases.
Since our first report (Giménez-Llort et al., 2008) proposing
gender-specific immunoendocrine aging in 3xTg-AD mice,
we have consistently reported that simple measures of weight
and relative weight of peripheral organs indicate splenomegaly
and thymus involution in this AD model. Both are considered
physical
indicators
of
peripheral
immunological
system
aging (reviewed by Giménez-Llort et al., 2012) and impaired
neuroimmunoendocrine crosstalk in AD (Giménez-Llort et al.,
2014). More recently other laboratories have worked on this
issue and successfully demonstrated the validity of splenomegaly
as part of the autoimmune manifestations in the 3xTg-AD
model (Marchese et al., 2014). In the present work, relative
spleen size was slightly modulated by caffeine in both genotypes,
a modulatory effect enough to restore the normal weight of
the spleen in the 3xTg-AD mice. This suggests that in the
3xTg-AD+caff group, there could be an improvement in the
deregulation of this network that recently has been described as
relevant in AD (Giménez-Llort et al., 2014).
At the endocrine level, slight increases of corticosterone
were observed due to genotype and treatment, without reaching
statistical significance. This trend would be in agreement with our
first report on the increase of glucocorticoid levels in male 3xTg-
AD mice at more advanced stages of disease, concomitantly to
increased anxiety and peripheral immune dysfunction (Giménez-
Llort et al., 2008). Stress-like patterns of increased corticosterone
secretion and decreased thyrotropin are described among the
neuroendocrine effects of caffeine, while chronic treatment is
known to induce tolerance to these effects (Spindel et al., 1983).
Immunomodulatory effects of caffeine by the decrease of
cytokines (Frost-Meyer and Logomarsino, 2012) have also been
proposed to contribute to neuroprotection, e.g., in Alzheimer’
s
disease (Horrigan et al., 2006). A better balance between pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines in favor of anti-inflammation is also
posed as the main hypothesis to explain the effects of caffeine
reducing the inflammatory processes in severe life-threatening
conditions (Bessler et al., 2012). Further experiments addressing
the effects of chronic caffeine on peripheral cytokine levels will
help to better elucidate its actions on the impaired neuro-immune
system in AD.
CONCLUSION
The present results provide evidence of the adverse effects of
caffeine in 3xTg-AD mice with a BPSD-like profile that raises

the concern for its general recommendation to AD patients.
These results confirm that caffeine, despite its everyday use and
relative lack of government regulation, is a potent compound
with multifaceted effects. Our study adds to the evidence for
caffeine and other adenosine-receptor blockers have distinct
physiological effects. Some ways to deal with these multi-effects
are to optimize the dose, to use active substances in coffee other
than caffeine, and to use synthetic drugs modeled after caffeine,
such as subtype-selective adenosine receptor antagonists, rather
caffeine itself. We speculate that over a chronic treatment with
caffeine, the exacerbation of anxiety-like BPSD symptoms may
partially interfere with the beneficial cognitive effects to the extent
that they can be in the opposite direction.
