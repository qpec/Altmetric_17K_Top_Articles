ABSTRACT
Objective: This was a study of positive psychological traits in a group of rural Italians aged 90 to 101 years,
and their children or other family members.
Design: Mixed-methods quantitative (standardized rating scales) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews)
study.
Setting: Study participants’ homes in nine villages in the Cilento region of southern Italy.
Participants: Twenty-nine nonagenarians and centenarians and 51 family members aged 51–75 years, selected
by their general practitioners as a part of a larger study called CIAO (Cilento Initiative on Aging Outcomes).
Methods: We used published rating scales of mental and physical well-being, resilience, optimism, anxiety,
depression, and perceived stress. Qualitative interviews gathered personal narratives of the oldest-old
individuals, including migrations, traumatic events, and beliefs. Family members described their impressions
about the personality traits of their older relative.
Results: Participants age >90 years had worse physical health but better mental well-being than their younger
family members. Mental well-being correlated negatively with levels of depression and anxiety in both
the groups. The main themes that emerged from qualitative interviews included positivity (resilience and
optimism), working hard, and bond with family and religion, as described in previously published studies of
the oldest old, but also a need for control and love of the land, which appeared to be unique features of this
rural population.
Conclusions: Exceptional longevity was characterized by a balance between acceptance of and grit to overcome
adversities along with a positive attitude and close ties to family, religion, and land, providing purpose in life.
Key words: resilience, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, qualitative research

Across the globe, population is aging at an

will rise to 88.4 million by 2050 (United States
Census Bureau). The number of centenarians in
the world will increase from 180,000 in 2000 to
3.2 million by 2050 (United Nations, 2002). A
number of studies have examined why and how
near centenarians and centenarians live to such
an advanced age (Poon et al., 1992; Andersen-
Ranberg et al., 1999; Perls et al., 1999; Andersen-
Ranberg et al., 2001; Perls and Terry, 2003; Willcox
et al., 2006; Poon et al., 2007; Engberg et al., 2008;
Zeng et al., 2008).
A vast majority of the published studies on the
oldest old are quantitative, aimed at testing specific
hypotheses, especially regarding biological under-
pinnings of extreme longevity. However, qualitative
research is also needed to allow these exceptionally
old
adults
to
communicate
their
experiences,
personal views, and life strategies through their
narratives. Qualitative studies enable individualized
data collection, capturing the complex interactions
between participants and their social environment.
Participatory action research involved in qualitative
interviews allows one to engage with the research
participants in a meaningful and reciprocal way
(Hutnik et al., 2016). The small number of
published qualitative studies in the oldest-old
adults, primarily conducted in urban and suburban
settings, have reported on stress-coping strategies,
adaptiveness to losses and life changes, positive
attitudes, and relationships with others (Pascucci
and Loving, 1997; Archer et al., 2005; Darviri et al.,
2009; Wong et al., 2014; Hutnik et al., 2016).
This study provides a comprehensive under-
standing of the positive traits among nonagenarians
and centenarians (N&Cs) from the Cilento region
of Italy, the center of the “Birthplace of the
Mediterranean Diet” (Keys and Keys, 1959). To
our knowledge, this is the first study of N&Cs
using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods
in both the seniors and their young-old family
members (Y-Os). It is also the first qualitative study
of such individuals from Italy, and one of only
three investigations of rural N&Cs, the others being
those in the rural US mid-west, by Pascucci and
Loving (1997) and Hinck (2004), which included
four centenarians and thirteen individuals aged 85–
98 years, respectively.
The hypotheses for the quantitative study, based
on other investigators’ (Darviri et al., 2009; Poon
et al., 2010; Jeste and Oswald, 2014; Lavretsky,
2014; Hutnik et al., 2016) as well as our previous
research in a community-based sample from San
Diego, California (Jeste et al., 2013; Martin et al.,
2015; Thomas et al., 2016) were (1) the N&Cs
would score higher on mental well-being and lower
on physical well-being compared to Y-Os; (2)
and the mental well-being scores would correlate
positively with scores on resilience and optimism,
and inversely with severity of subjectively perceived
stress, anxiety, and depression in both the groups.
The semi-structured qualitative interviews of the
N&Cs and Y-Os were designed to generate themes
related to exceptional longevity.
Methods
Participants
Study participants included 29 individuals (19
women and 10 men) aged 90 to 101 years, who
had been referred to this study by their general
practitioners. We also interviewed these N&Cs’ 51
Y-O children or other family members, usually two
per family (28 women and 23 men), aged 51 to
75 years. The N&Cs’ ages were validated by the
inspection of the respondents’ identification cards
by the general practitioners and interviewers.
The study was conducted in Cilento, an area
of about 1,721 square km and a population of
about 222,500 inhabitants in the Southern part
of Italy. To visit and interview the older adults
and their families, the interviewers traveled from
villages situated on the coast to those in rural parts
of Cilento. Sometimes it took up more than an
hour to drive from one village to another. The
nine villages were Acciaroli, Casal Velino, Futani,
Vallo della Lucania, Montano Antilia, San Mauro
La Bruca, Gioi, Stella Cilento, and Sessa Cilento.
The older adults interviewed live in single-floor
houses, and frequently have visitors. Generally, they
live with a Y-O family member (usually a son
or a daughter). The Y-Os interviewed showed a
great sense of duty and respect toward their older
relative.
Quantitative measures
We used Italian versions of standardized published
measures, which were brief, easy to administer,
and not distressing to the participants. Physical
and mental health were measured with the Medical
Outcome Study (MOS) SF-12 (Short Form - 12)
(Ware et al., 1996). Other measures of positive
attributes included ten-item Connor Davidson
Resilience Scale (Connor and Davidson, 2003;
Campbell-Sills and Stein, 2007) and five-item Life
Orientation Test – Revised for optimism (Herzberg
et al., 2006). Negative outcomes (perceived stress,
anxiety,
and
depression)
were
measured
with
Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983), the
Brief Symptom Inventory (Boulet and Boss, 1991;
Derogatis, 1993), and nine-item Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001),
respectively.

Qualitative interviews
A semi-structured interview was conducted in
Italian over one hour by an experienced psycho-
logist (Scelzo) who spoke the specific dialect of
the Cilento region and had previous experience in
interviewing very old people. She sought to gather
information concerning these N&Os’ life histories
in terms of traditions, culture, values, trauma, grief,
losses, immigration, and personality. Most of the
N&Cs were interviewed in the presence of their Y-
Os so that information could be shared, especially
when the N&Cs could not hear or speak properly.
Most participants showed a great interest in the
study.
The Italian qualitative interviews were translated
into English by Scelzo. In the first stage (open
coding), three authors (Scelzo, Montross, Jeste)
read all the interviews and coded repeated themes.
These
authors
also
highlighted
parts
of
the
interview that seemed to be of importance for these
N&Cs’ lives. Then, the three authors jointly listed
all the emerging themes and their interpretation.
Inter-rater reliability for identifying the themes
exceeded 90%. The Y-Os’ interviews were coded
in a similar fashion, with the focus being on their
older relatives’ (i.e. N&Cs’) personality.
Statistical analysis
We used the generalized estimating equations to
compare the two age groups by taking into account
correlated outcomes among the index subject and
associated family members. Spearman’s correla-
tions were employed for examining associations.
Results
Quantitative study
There were no significant gender differences (data
not shown) on any measure among N&Cs. Com-
pared to Y-Os, the N&Cs had significantly higher
scores on SF-12 mental well-being component,
despite having worse scores on physical well-
being component. There were no significant group
differences in the scores on resilience, optimism,
perceived stress, anxiety, or depression (Table 1).
As hypothesized, the SF-12 mental component
(well-being)
scores
in
both
groups
correlated
inversely with scores on anxiety and depression;
however, only in the Y-Os, mental well-being
scores correlated with resilience and optimism, and
inversely with perceived stress scores (Tables 2A
and 2B). Note that the sample size of Y-Os was
larger (n = 51) than that of N&Cs (n = 29). There
were very few significant correlations of age or
SF-12 physical component score with positive traits
or mental states in either group.
Qualitative interviews of nonagenarians
and centenarians
Several themes emerged from the semi-structured
interviews of the N&Cs, pertaining to positivity
(resilience and optimism), working hard, bond with
family and religion, and love of the land. Overall,
the N&Cs showed a strong sense of self-efficacy
and a belief in continuing to persevere regardless
of setbacks. At the same time, there was a strong
bond with their family, religion, and land among
these villagers. The interviews with Y-Os provided
external confirmation of the positive traits in their
older relatives, and also emphasized the latter’s
tendency to exert control.
Individual themes are listed below along with
representative
corresponding
quotes
from
the
interviewees.
Positivity: resilience and optimism
The N&Cs recounted their recovery from losses,
especially those of their loved ones, through a
balance between acceptance and grit, along with
optimism:
I lost my beloved wife only a month ago and I am
very sad for this. We were married for 70 years. I was
close to her during all her illness and I have felt very
empty after her loss. But thanks to my sons I am now
recovering and feeling much better. I have 4 children,
10 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren. I have
fought all my life and I am always ready for changes. I
think changes bring life and give chances to grow.
I have had a heart condition for which I have
undergone surgery but I am now okay. I have also had
two very serious car accidents and I have risked losing
my life. But I am still here!!
I am always thinking for the best. There is always a
solution in life. This is what my father had taught me:
to always face difficulties and hope for the best.
I am always active. I do not know what stress is.
Life is what it is and must be faced… always! If I have
to say, I feel younger now than when I was young!
The Y-Os expressed great appreciation for the
N&Cs’ resilience and positivity:
She is very resilient: always finding a solution for
every problem!
My mother is a very strong person, this is why she is
well and is still alive despite the grief for my two sisters.
She was like a bersagliere (a member of the regiment
of the Italian Army). She was very strong, optimistic,
and positive. She loved people, she loved her family
and she was always aiming to help the others.

 Mixed-methods study of oldest old in rural Italy
35
We always come to our father. He still is our point
of reference and an example for us, for the way he takes
things. He is a very strong person… even after the loss
of our mother, he appears to be strong…
She is always singing. She enjoys life! An example
for me - for us all!
Working hard
Without exception, the N&Cs emphasized their
ingrained work ethic:
Work was our life.
Work saved my life!! One day an Officer came to
the barrack and asked ‘who can mend shoes?’ Me, I
answered! And from there on I stayed into the barrack
and mended shoes for everybody. I could have gone
and fought and I am sure I would have died if it wasn’t
for my work!
The Y-Os echoed their respect for the N&Cs’
hard work:
I am always careful about my nanny because she
is so active that if you do not pay attention, she does
things she mustn’t do like hanging linen!
She (my mother-in-law) was a point of reference for
us all. She worked very hard, she was an angel!
Need for control
A surprisingly consistent finding was the descrip-
tion of the N&Cs by the next (younger) generation
as controlling, domineering, and stubborn:
My mother is a very strong and stubborn person.
She is an agreeable woman but she also tries to be
dominant.
She is a very strong person and she always wants
things to be done in her own way. My husband, her
son, has to come and visit her every day. He is her
reason for life. She must know everything about him,
and has to be always in control. So, if I want to do
something with my husband, like going away for a
holiday, we cannot do it, because he doesn’t want
his mother to be upset by his absence. She is very
dominant and has always found strength in others. He
has always had this strong bond with his parents and
still now looks after his mum’s things rather than ours!
My father is not a sweet person. He was like a
dictator, always worried about material things. He is
definitely a selfish and dominant person!
Bond with family and religion
Both the N&Cs and Y-Os stressed the strong bond
within the family and with their Catholic religion
(God):
My family has always been very close.
I spent a lot of time knitting and sewing for my
family.
I feel well and young. I am happy looking after my
family.
We were a close family of 5 children. We loved each
other a lot and helped each other.
I strongly believe in God and I have always been a
Catholic.
My family has always been very close and we have
always had so much faith in God!
I have never celebrated New Year’s Eve away from
my family!
What is life for me? Life to me is Acceptance! We
have to accept whatever comes in our life because it is
part of God’s drawing.
She (the mother) is not well and my dad is really
worried for her. They live in symbiosis.
She is obsessed by the order. She is a very religious
person and she loves listening to recorded programs
talking about that, especially now that she is not able
to see very well.
She loved people, she loved her family and she was
always aiming to help others.
She has always faced her life with a smile on her
face, with her faith in God.
Love of the land
A noteworthy feature among these rural families
was their deep and heartfelt affection for the land:
They are telling me not to go to the land anymore!
The land is my life! They say I am ill but they don’t
know that I become ill if they do not allow me to work
my land… I need to stay in touch with it. I cannot stay
at home all the time. I feel I can die!
We all worked the land. I love the countryside and
I mostly use products of our land: pulses, olive oil,
wheat.
In my life I have done everything since I was 13
years old, carrying chops of wood on my head. I also
used to pick olives. I have always worked the land.
She has always worked at home as a housewife and
looked after her family. My father died 14 years ago at
the age of 94. I know that my grandparents were 97
and 84 when they died. They all worked the land.
Land and hunting have always been what my father
loved the most. He was never at home.
Discussion
Our quantitative results are similar to those from
the Successful Aging Evaluation or SAGE Study
at UC San Diego that included a community-
based sample of over 1,500 San Diegans ages 21–
100 years, in terms of the “paradox” in which
older adults have better mental health than younger
adults, despite declines in physical function (Jeste
et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2016). The results of
the qualitative study support the published findings
of positivity (resilience and optimism), hard work,
and strong bond with family and God in the N&Cs.

However, two novel features of the present study
were the N&Cs’ strong need for control, described
by the family in terms such as “domineering,”
along with a love for the land in this rural
region. The Y-Os (children, caregivers, or other
family members) sometimes complained about the
stubbornness shown by the N&Cs when asked to
stop their outdoor activities. The N&Cs’ desire for
control may appear contrary to longevity research
that indicates an association of longevity with a
relaxed personality style and not focusing on things
one cannot control. The Cilento N&Cs were still
quite active and wanted to be in charge of their
social life. Social engagement was stressed by both
N&Cs and Y-Os for making them feel important,
responsible, and connected.
Resilience was closely connected to N&Cs’
personal identity. Lavretsky (2014) considers cen-
tenarians to be role models of resilience in that they
have survived a century of major risks and threats,
and successfully adapted to myriad daily stressors
throughout their long life. Hill and Turiano (2014)
emphasize that exceptional longevity, which in
a way reflects sustainability, requires a complex
dynamic involving identity, tradition, and change,
suggesting
the
importance
of
being
resilient,
optimistic, and having a purpose in life. There
is growing literature suggesting that a sense of
purpose in life is associated with subjectively as well
as objectively measured health, functioning, and
longevity (Kim et al., 2017). For the Cilento N&Cs,
the love of land along with a strong attachment to
family and religion accompanied by a focus on hard
work seem to provide a sense of higher purpose and
meaning to their life.
One study reported that the predictive efficacy
of physical health and cognitive astuteness was
overshadowed by the above-mentioned psychoso-
cial factors (von Faber et al., 2001). Another
found that socialization strategies, stress-related
life strategies, and adaptiveness were important
elements of exceptional longevity and appeared
to be effective in overcoming adversity such as
bereavement and experiencing conflicts (Darviri
et al., 2009). Hutnik and colleagues reported
that centenarians had mastered the art of positive
framing and developed psychological flexibility with
regard to change (Hutnik et al., 2016). Read
and Carstensen have proposed a socio-emotional
selectivity theory, according to which time horizons
shrink with aging and people become increasingly
selective, investing greater psychological resources
in
positive
(emotionally
meaningful)
than
in
negative (stressful) activities and goals (Read and
Carstensen, 2012).
N&Cs had higher scores on SF-12 mental well-
being than Y-Os, but the two groups were similar
in resilience, optimism, anxiety, depression, and
perceived stress. The finding with SF-12 is similar
to that from a number of other studies that have
reported increased level of mental well-being with
aging. In our SAGE study, we used the larger
SF -36 scale, and obtained similar results, along
with an aging-associated increase in the score on
a scale for satisfaction with life. The observed lack
of a group difference in resilience and optimism in
Cilento is consistent with reports of a correlation
between parental longevity and offspring’s positive
attitudes in two cohorts of over 2,000 community-
dwelling older people in the Netherlands (Rius-
Ottenheim et al., 2012). This might suggest a
partially linked heritability of longevity and positive
traits. Furthermore, resilience and optimism are
relatively stable personality traits.
The present study has several limitations. It is
based on retrospective accounts of life experiences
and strategies, which are susceptible to bias. Also, it
used semi-structured and not in-depth interviews,
making a full exploration of emerging themes
difficult. Similar to the Hutnik et al. study (Hutnik
et al., 2016), we sought to address the limitations
of small-scale qualitative investigation by employing
participatory action research which involved both
the N&Cs and Y-Os in co-constructing their stories
to generate richer in-depth data. Our sample was
likely biased – i.e. we used data from relatively
healthy and functional N&Cs who were capable of
communicating satisfactorily with an interviewer in
an hour-long interview. It is also possible that the
results were skewed to the positive side because
the N&Cs might be reluctant to discuss openly
their weaknesses and worries in front of others,
out of concern for their own reputation (Lin,
2002; Hwang, 2012). However, several participants
described their losses and how they tried to
overcome the adversities. Our sample size was
adequate for the qualitative study in terms of
reaching the saturation point, but small for the
quantitative study. However, we should point out
difficulties in recruiting relatively healthy N&Cs in
a rural setting. Our results may not generalize to
urban or suburban samples or those from other
countries or cultures.
A notable strength of this study is that it is, to
our knowledge, the first one to examine positive
psychological traits in N&Cs from rural areas using
three different methods: quantitative assessment
using standardized rating scales, semi-structured
qualitative interviews of these individuals in their
homes, and interviews of their adult children and
other family members. Thus, this study provides
a more comprehensive picture of the positive
traits among the N&Cs than either quantitative or
qualitative studies alone can offer. Moreover, the

 Mixed-methods study of oldest old in rural Italy

family members’ interviews provided insight into
an additional characteristic of uncompromising
stubbornness and domineering personality. The
love of the land felt by these exceptionally old
people is also a unique feature of these persons who
grew up and still live in rural surroundings.
We plan to follow these individuals longit-
udinally, with multi-domain assessments includ-
ing state-of-the-art biomarkers. Our quantitative
measures of positive traits will help us evaluate
biological associations of these traits with cellular
and molecular markers of inflammation, oxidative
stress, and metabolic function, among others. Such
studies may pave the way for developing novel
biological as well as behavioral interventions to
enhance positive traits in younger individuals too,
thus promoting not only longevity but also health,
well-being, and happiness in later life. Studying the
strategies of exceptionally long-lived and lived-well
individuals, who not just survive but also thrive and
flourish, enhances our understanding of health and
functional capacities in all age groups.
