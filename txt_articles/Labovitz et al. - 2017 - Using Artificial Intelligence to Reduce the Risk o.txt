reatment adherence is a critical component of antico-
agulation therapy. The recent introduction of direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) offers a more convenient alternative 
to warfarin, including a wide therapeutic window, few drug 
and food interactions, and fixed dosing without the need for 
laboratory monitoring. Although DOACs have reduced the 
need for regular monitoring, they have also placed pressure on 
patients to self-manage. At the same time, the shorter half-life 
of DOACs makes medication adherence a significant concern.1 
Laboratory tests currently used to monitor vitamin K antago-
nists are either too sensitive or too insensitive to DOACs to act 
as reliable measures of adherence, making dose titration and 
the determination of failure of therapy versus poor adherence 
challenging in routine clinical practice.2,3 As a result, subop-
timal rates of adherence4–6 to DOACs go undetected, placing 
patients at increased risk of stroke and bleeding.
Most studies rely on claims data and patient self-reports to 
measure adherence: both are unreliable.7,8 Other measures, 
such as electronic medication packaging, although provid-
ing a date and time stamp, are largely limited to adherence 
studies and have limited effect on adherence.9 Adherence 
interventions (counseling, educational, text messages, 
and electronic monitoring) have demonstrated mixed 
results.10,11 The major limitation of these approaches is that 
they do not verify drug administration. Although blood lev-
els are considered the gold standard, interperson variation, 
logistics, and cost make them impractical in routine clinical 
practice.12
Because of its ability to ensure treatment adherence, directly 
observed therapy has been used for decades to measure and 
maximize adherence for treatment of tuberculosis and HIV 
infection, and in inpatient settings. The artificial intelligence 
(AI) platform (AiCure, New York, NY) automates directly 
observed therapy using AI to visually confirm medication 
ingestion on smartphones (Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Background and Purpose—This study evaluated the use of an artificial intelligence platform on mobile devices in measuring 
and increasing medication adherence in stroke patients on anticoagulation therapy. The introduction of direct oral 
anticoagulants, while reducing the need for monitoring, have also placed pressure on patients to self-manage. Suboptimal 
adherence goes undetected as routine laboratory tests are not reliable indicators of adherence, placing patients at increased 
risk of stroke and bleeding.
Methods—A randomized, parallel-group, 12-week study was conducted in adults (n=28) with recently diagnosed ischemic 
stroke receiving any anticoagulation. Patients were randomized to daily monitoring by the artificial intelligence platform 
(intervention) or to no daily monitoring (control). The artificial intelligence application visually identified the patient, the 
medication, and the confirmed ingestion. Adherence was measured by pill counts and plasma sampling in both groups.
Results—For all patients (n=28), mean (SD) age was 57 years (13.2 years) and 53.6% were women. Mean (SD) cumulative 
adherence based on the artificial intelligence platform was 90.5% (7.5%). Plasma drug concentration levels indicated that 
adherence was 100% (15 of 15) and 50% (6 of 12) in the intervention and control groups, respectively.
Conclusions—Patients, some with little experience using a smartphone, successfully used the technology and demonstrated 
a 50% improvement in adherence based on plasma drug concentration levels. For patients receiving direct oral 
anticoagulants, absolute improvement increased to 67%. Real-time monitoring has the potential to increase adherence 
and change behavior, particularly in patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

Methods
Eligible patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke (with or without 
preceding transient ischemic attack and with a score between 1 and 
20 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and receiving 
oral anticoagulation therapy were randomized to daily monitoring 
by the AI platform (intervention) or to no daily monitoring (control) 
in this 12-week, randomized, parallel-group, controlled, single-site 
study. All patients were prescribed warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
or apixaban. Patients attended 4 clinic visits (baseline and weeks 
4, 8, and 12); prothrombin time/international normalized ratio and 
the activated partial thromboplastin time were regularly measured. 
Medication adherence was measured by pill counts, plasma sampling, 
and the AI platform. Informed consent was obtained before entering 
the study. The study was approved by an institutional review board.
Exploratory, hypothesis-generating analyses were performed for 
all randomized patients who took at least 1 dose and included data 
through week 12.
AI Platform
Patients randomized to the intervention group were provisioned mobile 
devices with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-
compliant application installed. Software algorithms identified the 
patient, the medication, and the confirmed ingestion. The software 
provided medication reminders and dosing instructions. Late doses 
triggered notifications within the hour and before the end of the dos-
ing window. Real-time data were encrypted and transmitted to web-
based dashboards for review. Clinic staff received automated text 
messages or emails if doses were missed, late, or based on incorrect 
usage. AI app data fell into 5 categories: (1) visual confirmation of 
ingestion, (2) self-reported dose via the AI app, (3) self-reported dose 
by clinic staff, (4) missed dose, and (5) dose taken in clinic (Figure I 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Results
A total of 117 patients were screened, with 28 patients ran-
domized; 15 to the AI platform and 13 to the control group. 
One patient randomized to the control group withdrew from 
the study before the first dose taken and is excluded from 
further analysis. Baseline demographics were similar across 
both groups (Table). Mean (SD) age was 57.0 years (13.17 
years), and 53.6% of patients were women. Patients receiv-
ing DOACs (n=20) outnumbered patients on warfarin (n=8). 
Previous smartphone usage and comfort with smartphones 
were comparable between the 2 groups.
Adherence for All Subjects
A total of 2234 adherence parameters were collected during 
12 weeks for patients monitored with the AI app. Mean (SD) 
cumulative adherence (visual confirmation of drug adminis-
tration using the AI app) was 90.5% (7.5%; Figure 1).
Mean (SD) cumulative adherence based on pill count was 
97.2% (4.4%) for the AI platform group and 90.6% (5.8%) 
for the control group. A total of 108 plasma samples (4 per 
patient) were collected across both groups (3 samples were 
clotted). Plasma samples were marked as adherent if drug 
concentration levels were above the minimum required thera-
peutic range (Cmin). Fifty percent (6 out of 12) and 100% (15 
out of 15) of patients in the control and intervention groups, 
respectively, had all samples above Cmin. Among patients 
deemed nonadherent (n=6), all were in the control group and 
all were prescribed DOACs. At all clinic visits, the interven-
tion group had a higher percentage of samples above Cmin than 
the control group (Figure 2).
Substudy—Adherence for Patients 
Receiving DOACs
More than half of the patients (n=19) received DOACs. Mean 
(SD) cumulative adherence (visual confirmation of drug 
administration using the AI app) was 90.1% (7.3%). Mean 
(SD) cumulative adherence based on pill count was 96.4% 
(5.1%) for the AI platform group and 90.9% (6.0%) for the 
control group. Mean (SD) cumulative adherence based on 
pill count for subjects with plasma samples below therapeu-
tic range was 90.5% (5.6%) compared with 95.3% (5.9%) for 
subjects with plasma samples above therapeutic range. On the 
basis of drug concentration levels, 33% (3 out of 9) in the 
control and 100% (10 out of 10) in the intervention group had 
all samples above Cmin.
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time and 
Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio
Averages for activated partial thromboplastin time and pro-
thrombin time/international normalized ratio were similar 
across the control and intervention groups: activated partial 
thromboplastin time, 48.4 and 41.7, respectively; prothrombin 
time, 32.9 and 35.1, respectively; and international normal-
ized ratio, 3.1 and 3.4, respectively.

pre- and poststudy questionnaire, overall 73.3% and 83.3% of 
patients, respectively, answered extremely good when asked 4 
questions to rate the AI platform as a medication management 
tool and as a means to improve the doctor/patient relationship.
Discussion
This study used a novel artificial intelligence platform to assess 
and increase medication adherence in patients with a recently 
diagnosed ischemic stroke. Unlike most studies, which rely on 
indirect measures, to our knowledge, this study was the first 
randomized controlled trial to compare adherence rates of all 3 
DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) and warfarin 
together based on daily real-time monitoring against a control 
group and verified by plasma sampling. Suboptimal adher-
ence across all DOACs confirms previous findings although 
this study suggests that adherence might be lower than previ-
ously recognized; high adherence to warfarin underlines the 
value of routine laboratory tests to, in effect, ensure adherence. 
Absolute improvement of 67% in patients taking DOACs and 
monitored by the AI app—and confirmed by drug levels—
demonstrates the potential value of daily real-time monitor-
ing to measure and maximize adherence. Few studies have 
deployed smartphone apps in middle-aged or elderly popu-
lations.13 Consistent use and general likability of the AI app 
over 12 weeks underscores the possibility of harnessing new 
technologies to optimize adherence in patients on DOACs for 
whom routine laboratory tests are not good indicators of adher-
ence. AI platforms have the potential to accurately monitor 
medication ingestion and change patient behavior.
