BACKGROUND: Early pubertal timing in girls is one of the best-replicated antecedents of a range 
of mental health problems during adolescence, but few researchers have examined the 
duration of these effects.
METHODS: We leverage a nationally representative sample (N = 7802 women) managed 
prospectively from adolescence over a period of ∼14 years to examine associations of age at 
menarche with depressive symptoms and antisocial behaviors in adulthood.
RESULTS: Earlier ages at menarche were associated with higher rates of both depressive 
symptoms and antisocial behaviors in early-middle adulthood largely because difficulties 
that started in adolescence did not attenuate over time.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the emotional sequelae of puberty extend further 
than documented in previous research, and suggest that earlier development may place 
girls on a life path from which it may be difficult to deviate. The American Academy of 
Pediatrics already provides guidelines for identifying and working with patients with early 
pubertal timing. Pediatricians and adolescent health care providers should also be attuned 
to early maturers’ elevated mental health risk and sensitive to the potential duration of 
changes in mental health that begin at puberty.

 Sweeping changes in biology, 
appearance, self-perception, 
behavior, and emotion combine to 
make puberty one of the most pivotal 
phases of the life span. Although 
puberty presents challenges for 
all adolescents, girls who mature 
ahead of their peers are particularly 
vulnerable. Earlier pubertal 
timing in girls is one of the best-
replicated antecedents of adolescent 
mental health problems, including 
depression, anxiety, disordered 
eating, delinquency, substance use, 
and school failure or dropout.1 
Because physical maturation is 
entwined with changes in social roles 
and relationships, this association 
is commonly attributed to the 
natural difficulty of contending 
with new changes and stressors at a 
younger chronological age2 coupled 
with specific, puberty-triggered 
neural changes that may increase 
susceptibility for psychopathology 
during adolescence.3
Surprisingly little is known about 
the long-term impact of earlier 
development. Although hundreds 
of studies document associations of 
early pubertal timing with mental 
health through late adolescence, 
almost no researchers have 
conducted assessments past this 
point. This is likely, in part, due to the 
financial and logistical complexities 
of managing participants for 
extended periods of time. The small 
body of research on long-term effects 
varies in methodology, sample size, 
and demographics but suggests 
several points worth considering. 
First, from the animal literature, 
mice who experience high levels of 
stress during puberty display greater 
levels of depressive symptoms 
in adulthood than mice that are 
stressed pre- or postpubertally.4 
One plausible interpretation is that 
puberty constitutes a sensitive period 
for emotional development, with 
events and experiences at this time 
more likely to impart lasting effects 
on well-being. Second, retrospective 
studies indicate that women in 
inpatient treatment of substance 
dependence and eating disorders 
report earlier ages at menarche 
than healthy controls.5, 
 
6 Third, 
a handful of prospective studies 
report associations of early puberty 
with elevated rates of depression, 
substance abuse, eating disorders, 
and antisocial behavior in early 
adulthood, 
7– 
9 but at least 1 major 
longitudinal study does not.10
Two possible trajectories might 
characterize early puberty’s 
relationship with long-term health. 
One route is for difficulties related 
to pubertal timing simply to persist 
over time. In support of this, 
experiencing 1 episode of major 
depressive disorder increases the 
likelihood of future depressive 
episodes, and the onset of depression 
in childhood or adolescence is 
strongly associated with psychosocial 
impairment, symptom severity, 
and number of recurrences of 
depression in adulthood.11, 
 
12 
Therefore, early pubertal timing 
may be associated with long-
term psychopathology because 
symptoms began in adolescence 
and (although they may have 
fluctuated episodically) continued 
into adulthood. Alternatively, girls’ 
difficulties may worsen over time. 
Because adolescence often serves as 
a foundation for future life events, 
girls who experience psychopathology 
during this time may be more likely 
to face compromised career and 
educational options, related life 
stressors, and feelings of futility 
regarding potential improvements or 
changes to their lives (a phenomenon 
sometimes called stress generation).13 
This trajectory would result in 
higher or more severe depression in 
adulthood even after accounting for 
symptoms in adolescence.
A third possibility is that the 
struggles associated with earlier 
development are transient, 
naturally waning as girls age 
into adulthood, strengthen their 
inter- and intrapersonal resources, 
and encounter new social contexts 
and life circumstances. Certainly, the 
experiences that often mediate early 
puberty’s association with adolescent 
mental health are specific to that 
development stage and primarily 
reflect the growing importance of 
peers. For example, difficulty getting 
along with less physically developed 
peers plays a role in the onset of 
depression, whereas affiliation 
with new (and often older) peer 
groups has been identified as key for 
antisocial behavior.14 
– 
16 It is logical to 
expect that when the social upheavals 
of adolescence pass, early-developing 
girls’ emotional difficulties may 
likewise attenuate.
If early puberty leads to long-term 
disruptions in psychological well-
being, the public health implications 
of a declining age at pubertal 
onset may be larger than presently 
assumed; if the disruptions of early 
puberty are limited to adolescence, 
the public health implications may be 
weaker. Without a better awareness 
of the magnitude and longevity of 
early puberty’s effects, we cannot 
know whether, when, and on what 
processes to intervene. In response 
to these gaps in knowledge, we aim 
in the current study to clarify long-
term associations of early pubertal 
timing in girls with depressive 
symptoms and antisocial behaviors in 
adulthood.
METhODS
Data were drawn from the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health (Add Health), 
17 a nationally 
representative study in which 
researchers assess adolescent 
health and risk behavior. Add Health 
was collected in 4 waves between 
1994 and 2008 and is notable for 
a high degree of racial, ethnic, and 
socioeconomic diversity. Of the 20 745 
participants interviewed in-home at 
Wave I, 10 480 were girls (Mage = 15.8 
years; range: 11–21 years). Follow-up 
MENDlE et al

Downloaded from 
 interviews were completed from 1995 
to 1996 (Wave II; Mage = 16.1 years; 
range: 12–23 years), 2001 to 2002 
(Wave III; Mage = 21.7 years; range: 
18–27 years), and 2007 to 2009 
(Wave IV; Mage = 28.7 years; range: 
24–34 years). Add Health provides 
survey and design weights to account 
for the clustered nature of the sample 
and produce nationally representative 
point and variance estimates based 
on sampling design and attrition.18 
The current analyses comprise 7802 
female participants for whom data 
were available on age at menarche 
and who also had valid survey 
weights. Sample characteristics are 
reported in Table 1.
Measures
Age at Menarche
Participants reported at Waves I and 
II if they had ever had a menstrual 
period and, if so, during which month 
and year they experienced the first 
menstrual cycle. At Wave III, they 
were asked, “How old were you 
when you got your period for the first 
time?” Test-retest reliability for age 
at menarche measured at Waves I, II, 
and III by using Cronbach’s coefficient 
α was 0.80. The first reported age 
at menarche was used to avoid 
telescoping bias, 
19 which occurs 
when individuals remember events 
as closer to the date of the interview 
than they actually are. This was most 
often reported at Wave I (89.7% of 
the sample). Frequencies for age at 
menarche are presented in Table 2.
Depressive Symptoms
At Waves I and IV, participants 
completed the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
Scale (CES-D), 
20 a self-report 
measure of cognitive, affective, 
and physiologic symptoms of 
depression experienced in the past 
week. Although the full CES-D was 
given at Wave I, a 10-item short 
form was given at Wave IV. The 
correlation between the full CES-D 
and 10-item abbreviated version at 
Wave I was r = 0.96, indicating the 
short form adequately represented 
the information provided in the 
full version; to keep measurement 
consistent, the short version 
was used to quantify depressive 
symptoms at Waves I and IV. For 
each item, participants reported 
whether they had experienced that 
symptom, where 0 = “never or rarely, 
” 1 = “sometimes, 
” 2 = “a lot of the 
time, 
” and 3 = “most of the time or all 
of the time.” Scores of 8 to 10 have 
been suggested as clinical cutoffs for 
the short-form CES-D.21, 
 
22
Antisocial Behaviors
At Waves I and IV, participants 
reported frequency of engagement 
in antisocial behaviors in the past 12 
months, with 0 = “never, 
” 1 = “1 or 2 
times, 
” 2 = “3 or 4 times, 
” and 3 = “5 
or more times.” Behaviors assessed 
at both time points included property 
damage, stealing something worth 
>$50, stealing something worth 
<$50, breaking into a building, and 
selling drugs. Wave I additionally 
included running away from home, 
lying to parents, driving a car 
without the owner’s permission, 
shoplifting, and being loud and 
rowdy in public, whereas Wave IV 
included deliberately writing a bad 
check, using someone else’s debit 
card without permission, and buying

Additional Covariates
Analyses included demographic 
and familial covariates commonly 
associated with earlier puberty or 
elevated depression and/or antisocial 
behaviors: race and/or ethnicity 
(with European American as the 
reference category), father absence 
(coded as absent from birth, early 
childhood, or middle childhood, with 
father presence as the reference), and 
socioeconomic indicators indexed by 
receipt of public assistance, household 
income–to–needs ratio at Wave I, and 
maternal education (with no high 
school degree as the reference).23, 
 
24  
Age at Wave I was also included 
because older age permits more time 
for symptoms to emerge and because 
during adolescence, older adolescents 
tend to report higher levels of 
depressive symptoms and antisocial 
behaviors than younger adolescents.
Missing Data
The analytic sample included all 
individuals with age at menarche 
but not necessarily complete data on 
all covariates or Wave IV dependent 
variables (Fig 1 A and B). To address 
missing data, data were multiply 
imputed by using the ice command in 
Stata 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX), which is based on a regression-
switching protocol using chained 
equations.25 Missing covariates ranged 
from 0.1% (for race and/or ethnicity) 
to 28% (income–to–needs ratio). Ten 
imputed data sets were generated, 
with coefficients and SEs combined by 
using the MI estimate command. Girls 
with complete data on all variables did 
not differ in age at menarche or Wave 
IV antisocial behaviors from those 
who needed imputation for 1 or more 
variables. However, participants with 
complete data for all variables reported 
fewer depressive symptoms at Wave 
IV than those with missing data for 1 
or more variables (M = 5.55 vs 5.86; t 
[7790] = 3.04; P < .01).
Analytic Strategy
A series of ordinary least-squares 
regression models was used to assess 
associations of age at menarche 
with (1) depressive symptoms and 
(2) antisocial behaviors. All models 
were weighted by using Wave IV 
survey and design weights.18 Models 
represented 3 different conceptual 
associations between pubertal 
timing and psychological outcomes.

Downloaded from 
 mental health during adolescence. 
The lingering influences model 
regressed depressive symptoms and/
or antisocial behaviors at Wave IV on 
age at menarche and covariates. This 
model did not include adolescent 
symptom levels to test a direct 
association of pubertal timing with 
mental health in adulthood. The 
increasing influences model included 
adolescent levels of symptoms as 
an additional covariate to estimate 
whether early pubertal timing was 
related to depressive symptoms and/
or antisocial behaviors in adulthood 
above and beyond what might be 
predicted by adolescent levels. 
For each model, age at menarche 
was entered both as a linear and a 
quadratic term to assess potential 
nonlinear effects.
RESULTS
Depressive Symptoms
As shown in Table 3, the proximal 
influences model suggested that age 
at menarche significantly and linearly 
predicted depressive symptoms 
during adolescence, with later ages 
of menarche associated with lower 
levels of symptoms (b = −0.87; P < 
.05). There was also a marginally 
significant quadratic association  
(b = 0.03; P = .09) indicating a trend 
for depressive symptoms to be more 
steeply related to earlier menarche. 
To illustrate, a girl who reached 
menarche at age 10 years (∼2 years 
earlier than the mean) would have 
depressive symptoms 8% of 1 SD 
greater in adolescence, whereas a  
girl who reached menarche at age  
8 years would have depressive  
symptoms 25% of 1 SD greater. By 
Wave IV, when participants were  
nearly 30 years of age, associations  
of menarche with depressive  
symptoms were still evident. The 
lingering influences model indicated  
that menarche was both linearly  
(b = −0.84; P < .05) and quadratically 
(b = 0.03; P < .05) associated 
with symptoms at Wave IV. This 
corresponds to an effect of 6% of 1 
SD for a girl who reached menarche 
at age 10 years and 20% of 1 SD 
for those who reached menarche 
at age 8 years relative to those who 
reached menarche at 12 years. 
When accounting for baseline levels 
of depressive symptoms at Wave I 
in the increasing influences model, 
menarche was no longer significantly 
associated with symptoms at Wave 
IV (blinear = −0.61, ns; bquadratic = 
0.02, ns). Collectively, this pattern of 
results suggests that early-maturing 
girls are more prone to depressive 
symptoms in adulthood than their 
later-maturing peers primarily 
because they become depressed as 
adolescents, and this vulnerability 
persists over the next decade and 
one-half.
Antisocial behavior
A slightly different pattern of results 
emerged for antisocial behaviors  
(full model results displayed in  
 
Tables 4). In the proximal influences 
model, age at menarche was  
significantly and linearly related 
to antisocial behaviors during 
adolescence, with early-maturing  
girls reporting a higher frequency  
of antisocial behaviors (b = −0.09;  
P < .05). These results indicate that

Downloaded from 
 a girl who reached menarche at age 
10 years would display antisocial 
behaviors 5% of 1 SD greater in 
adolescence than those who reached 
menarche at the mean age of 12 
years; a girl who reached menarche 
at age 8 years would have antisocial 
behaviors 10% of 1 SD greater. This 
association persisted longitudinally  
(lingering influences model;  
b = −0.02; P < .05) and remained 
marginally significant and of similar 
magnitude even after including 
adolescent levels of antisocial 
behaviors in the model (increasing 
influences model; b = −0.02; P = 
.08). These findings indicate that 
earlier menarche is associated with 
higher rates of antisocial behaviors 
in both adolescence and adulthood 
even after accounting for important 
demographic covariates. Although 
marginally significant, it may also 
be possible that antisocial behaviors 
slightly worsen in adulthood for 
early-maturing girls relative to later-
maturing girls. Quadratic associations 
of age at menarche with antisocial 
behaviors were not significant in 
any models of antisocial behaviors; 
consequently, the quadratic term was 
dropped from final models.
DISCUSSION
Earlier pubertal timing in girls is 
often accompanied by distinct rises in 
the prevalence, severity, and onset of 
psychopathology. These associations 
have been documented consistently 
over the past half-century in diverse 
communities within America and 
in various cultures and countries 
around the world.26 Although many 
psychological disorders in adults first 
emerge in childhood and adolescence, 
 
27 surprisingly few researchers have 
examined the longevity of pubertal 
timing effects, likely because of the 
practical complexities of managing 
participants for extended periods of 
time. As a result, the overwhelming 
majority of researchers have not 
conducted assessments past late 
adolescence.
Not understanding the long-term 
sequelae of earlier puberty is 
not merely a gap in the research 
literature but a public health issue. 
The age of pubertal onset has 
declined dramatically over the past 
half-century.28, 
 
29 It is difficult to 
know whether, when, and on what 
processes to intervene if we cannot 
establish how much pubertal timing 
matters for well-being later in life. 
Results from the current study 
suggest that girls who experienced 
earlier menarche continued to 
report elevated psychopathology 
in early-to-middle adulthood even 
after accounting for demographic 
and contextual variables commonly 
associated with vulnerability for 
mental health. These findings 
align with the broad body of work 
linking early puberty with higher 
psychopathology during adolescence1 
as well as with the few studies 
showing longer-term associations 
with mental health in adulthood.5

Downloaded from 
 to show higher levels of symptoms 
in adulthood primarily because 
they were more likely to become 
depressed as adolescents, and that 
propensity for depression seems to 
have been sustained over time. It 
is unlikely that these women were 
continually depressed, without 
remission, from adolescence into 
adulthood. Rather, the effect of 
pubertal timing was robust enough to 
withstand vicissitudes in the timing 
of assessments relative to depressive 
episodes. In addition, effects seemed 
to be nonlinear, suggesting that 
effects are more pronounced and 
menarche is more steeply related to 
depressive symptoms when it occurs 
at a younger age.
Antisocial behaviors were also 
elevated among women who 
experienced earlier menarche. 
The more typical developmental 
pattern is for externalizing to lessen 
postadolescence because of ongoing 
neural maturation, improvements 
in impulse control, and increased 
orientation toward future life 
events.30, 
 
31 The discrepancy in 
antisocial activity between early 
and not-early maturers widened in 
adulthood relative to adolescence, 
although it should be noted that 
effects for antisocial behaviors were 
relatively modest and smaller in 
magnitude than those found for 
depressive symptoms. However, 
given the myriad influences that 
predict antisocial behaviors coupled 
with the high cost these behaviors 
present to society, even a small effect 
of pubertal timing is notable.
This study is one of the few studies 
of puberty on which researchers 
managed participants past 
adolescence, providing needed 
information about the magnitude 
of the risk of earlier development. 
But it also holds several limitations. 
Chief among these is an imperfect 
understanding of the mechanisms 
underlying these longitudinal effects. 
Because early puberty disrupts social, 
emotional, and academic trajectories, 
there are numerous reasons why it 
might be associated with continued 
psychological vulnerability. A 
challenge for future researchers 
is to specify the cognitive, social, 
neural, and biological mechanisms 
that mediate this continued risk. Of 
particular importance are hypotheses 
that go beyond developmental 
characteristics generally limited 
to adolescence. Now that we have 
ascertained the longevity of effects, 
our mechanistic hypotheses require 
updating as well.
Second, our indicator of pubertal 
timing was age at menarche. 
Although menarche is one of the 
most commonly used indicators of 
pubertal timing, it typically occurs 
at Tanner Stage 4 or 5 and would 
not capture social, emotional, or 
hormonal processes that occur 
earlier in puberty. Third, we used 
only youth self-reports of adolescent 
psychopathology and do not have 
parental reports to provide a more 
complete picture of functioning. 
We also only consider 2 domains of 
psychopathology and cannot assume 
that long-term effects extend to 
other disorders. Finally, it should be 
noted that research on early pubertal 
timing has been disproportionately 
skewed toward girls. All extant 
research suggests that puberty is 
more challenging for girls than for 
boys, and girls experience a greater 
severity and diversity of clinical 
symptoms associated with physical 
development. Yet it is hard not to see 
the dearth of research on pubertal 
timing in boys as a limitation of the 
current study as well as the field 
more broadly.
CONCLUSIONS
Girls’ pubertal timing is directly 
connected to mental health. Yet, 
puberty is underrepresented in 
research compared with other 
correlates of psychopathology, and 
there have been no purposeful efforts 
to investigate its influence beyond 
the adolescent years. The current 
research suggests that the sequelae of 
earlier development are not transient 
growing pains but are predictive 
of difficulties and challenges 
that persist into adulthood. 
Understanding the longevity of these 
associations offers new challenges to 
researchers, practical information for 
pediatricians and adolescent health 
care providers, and highlights that 
the emotional sequelae of puberty 
may endure well past the proximal 
period of adolescence.
