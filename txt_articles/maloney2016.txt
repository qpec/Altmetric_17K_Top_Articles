What is already known about this topic? Many patients are allergic to both grass and ragweed, and dual administration
of grass and ragweed sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets may be indicated for some of these patients.
What does this article add to our knowledge? In patients allergic to both grass and ragweed, following a 2-week period
of sequential single SLIT-tablet treatment, simultaneous administration of grass and ragweed SLIT tablets within 5 minutes
was well tolerated.
How does this study impact current management guidelines? This study found that after tolerability with single SLIT-
tablet administration has been established, dual treatment with grass and ragweed SLIT tablets may be able to be followed
by simultaneous tablet administration at home.
BACKGROUND: Dual treatment with grass and ragweed
sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets has not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the safety and tolerability of dual
grass and ragweed SLIT-tablet administration.
METHODS: This open-label, multicenter trial (NCT02256553)
enrolled North American adults (N [ 102) allergic to grass
and ragweed. The trial had 3 periods, each of 2 weeks duration.
In period 1, subjects received once-daily timothy grass SLIT
tablet (2800 bioequivalent allergen unit; Merck, Inc, Kenil-
worth, NJ/ALK, Hørsholm, Denmark). In period 2, subjects
received a short ragweed SLIT tablet (12 Ambrosia artemisii-
folia 1-U; Merck/ALK) every morning and a grass SLIT tablet
every evening. In period 3, subjects received once-daily grass
and ragweed SLIT tablets within 5 minutes (simultaneous
intake). The primary end point was the proportion of subjects
with 1 or more local swelling events in each period. Secondary
end points were the proportion of subjects with 1 or more local
adverse events (AEs), that discontinued the treatment because
of AEs, and subjects with 1 or more local AEs requiring
treatment.

periods 1, 2, and 3, the proportions of subjects with 1 or more
local AEs were 71%, 69%, and 56%, respectively; the
proportions discontinuing the treatment because of treatment-
related AEs were 5%, 1%, and 2%, and the proportions with 1 or

Ragweed and grass are prevalent allergens in North America,
with an estimated 30% to 40% of the US population reporting
current hay fever symptoms to each of these allergens.1 In
Canada, sensitivity to ragweed and grass is as high as 33% and
29%, respectively.2 Furthermore, patients are often allergic to
both grass and ragweed. In North American clinical trials of grass
or ragweed sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablets, approxi-
mately 65% of grass-allergic subjects were also sensitized to
ragweed3 and approximately 50% of ragweed-allergic subjects
were also sensitized to grass.4 Dual administration of SLIT tab-
lets may be indicated for some patients allergic to both grass and
ragweed. Indeed, treatment with multiple allergens is common
practice with subcutaneous immunotherapy.
Grastekand Ragwitek (Merck & Co, Inc,Kenilworth, NJ/ALK,
Hørsholm, Denmark) are SLIT tablets approved for use in the
United States and Canada for the treatment of timothy grass (or
cross-reactive grass) pollen- and short ragweed pollen-induced
allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis (AR/C). The pre-
scribing information for the ragweed and timothy grass SLIT
tablets recommends that treatment without uptitration be initiated
at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of the respective pollen
season5,6; in North America, this time period for ragweed would
coincide with the grass pollen season when patients receiving grass
SLIT tablets were still undergoing treatment. Therefore, simulta-
neous administration of grass and ragweed SLIT tablets would be
required to treat AR/C associated with both allergens.
Although the tolerability of the individual grass and ragweed
SLIT tablets has been demonstrated in double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized clinical trials,3,4,7,8 there are no available
data on dual administration of these tablets. Furthermore, there
is no guidance on dosing schedules introducing dual-tablet
administration without uptitration. The primary objective of
this phase 4 trial was to evaluate a sequential dosing schedule and
characterize the safety and tolerability of dual grass and ragweed
SLIT-tablet administration in adults with grass and ragweed
pollen-induced AR/C.
METHODS
Study design and treatment
This was a phase 4, multicenter, open-label trial in adults with
both ragweed and grass allergy conducted from October 13, 2014, to
February 18, 2015, at 3 sites in the United States and Canada
(P006; NCT02256553). Trial protocols were approved by the
appropriate institutional review boards, and written informed con-
sent from subjects was obtained before the start of the trial.
Treatment was initiated shortly after the ragweed season. There
were 3 periods to the trial (Figure 1) and 5 clinic visits. At clinic visit 2,
subjects received the full maintenance dose of the grass SLIT tablet
(Grastek/Grazax; MK-7243, 2800 bioequivalent allergen unit; Merck
& Co, Inc/ALK) with no uptitration and under supervision at the
clinic followed by a 30-minute observation. For the remainder of
period 1, subjects self-administered 1 grass SLIT tablet every evening.
At clinic visit 3, subjects received 1 maintenance dose of the ragweed
SLIT tablet (Ragwitek; MK-3641, 12 Ambrosia artemisiifolia 1-U;
Merck & Co, Inc/ALK) under supervision in the morning, followed
by a 30-minute observation. That same evening subjects self-
administered 1 grass SLIT tablet. For the remainder of period 2,
subjects self-administered 1 ragweed SLIT tablet every morning and 1
grass SLIT tablet every evening. At clinic visit 4, subjects received both
ragweed SLIT tablet and grass SLIT tablet within 5 minutes (referred
to as simultaneous administration) under supervision, followed by a
30-minute observation. For the remainder of period 3, subjects self-
administered 1 ragweed SLIT tablet and 1 grass SLIT tablet within
5 minutes each day. The timing of at-home dosing during period 3 was
at the discretion of the subject, but was to be at approximately the same
time each day. Subjects were instructed not to place both tablets under
the tongue at the same time, but to take the ragweed SLIT tablet first,
followed by the grass SLIT tablet once the ragweed SLIT tablet had
dissolved (dissolution time is typically <10 seconds). Subjects were
reminded by telephone the day before clinic visit 3 and clinic visit 4 not
to take their study medication(s) the next day before coming to the
clinic. Compliance was assessed by subject interview during clinic
visits and was calculated as the number of days on therapy/number of
days should be on therapy � 100%.
Subjects were instructed not to swallow during the first minute
after SLIT-tablet administration. A washout period of 7 days before
visit 2 was required for antihistamines. The use of medications as a
pretreatment to prevent adverse events (AEs) was not allowed during
the trial, but medications (except antihistamines) were allowed to
treat AR/C symptoms. Subjects using low- or medium-dose inhaled
corticosteroids were allowed to continue during the trial, as long as
they were on a stable regimen for at least 2 weeks before screening.
Self-injectable epinephrine was provided to each subject in the event
of a systemic reaction, and subjects were instructed on its use.
Key inclusion and exclusion criteria
Subjects eligible for the trial were men or women aged 18 to 65
years, with a clinical history of physician-diagnosed ragweed and
grass pollen-induced AR/C of at least 1 year duration, with or
without asthma. A positive skin prick test response from the Duotip
device (Lincoln Diagnostics, Inc, Decatur, Ill), defined as an average
wheal diameter 5 mm or larger than that of the saline control to both

 A artemisiifolia and Phleum pratense, was required. Subjects were
required to have an FEV1 of 70% or more of predicted at both
screening and visit 2 following at least a 6-hour washout period of
short-acting b2-agonists. Subjects with unstable, uncontrolled, or se-
vere asthma or with asthma treated with long-acting b2-agonists at
screening were excluded. Other key exclusion criteria were a history of
anaphylaxis with cardiorespiratory symptoms due to previous immu-
notherapy or inhalant allergens, a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis,
history of severe systemic allergic reaction or severe local reaction to
SLIT, allergen immunotherapy within the past month, receipt of
maintenance doses of ragweed and/or grass subcutaneous immuno-
therapy for 1 month or more within the last 5 years, previous exposure
to grass or ragweed SLIT, or pregnancy. Discontinuation criteria
included any life-threatening treatment-related adverse event (TRAE),
persistent and escalating AEs in the mouth or throat, severe or
persistent symptoms of esophagitis, severe treatment-related anaphy-
lactic reaction, or difficulty controlling asthma.
Assessments
The primary end points of the trial were the proportion of subjects
with 1 or more event of local swelling (ie, pharyngeal edema, laryngeal
edema, mouth edema, oropharyngeal swelling, palatal edema, tongue
swelling/edema, or throat tightness) during each of the periods 1, 2,
and 3. Secondary end points were the proportion of subjects with 1 or
more event of a local AE (ie, local swellings as listed for the primary end
point, as well as lip swelling/edema, ear pruritus, dysphagia, oral
discomfort, glossodynia, oral pruritus, oral hypoesthesia, throat irri-
tation, oral paresthesia, or stomatitis), the proportion of subjects with 1
or more AE that led to study discontinuation, and the proportion of
subjects with 1 or more local AE that required symptomatic treatment
during each trial period. Other safety assessments included monitoring
of vital signs, oropharyngeal examination, and pulmonary function
tests at each clinic visit.
An exploratory end point was the subject’s overall perception of
tolerability for the study medications over the previous 7 days before
clinic visits 3, 4, and 5. This assessment was measured by a
questionnaire that asked how willing the subject would be to take
the medication every day if asked to do so by his or her doctor.
Possible answers were “Definitely,” “Probably,” “Neutral,” “Prob-
ably not,” and “Definitely not.”
A Side Effect Report Card was developed by the study sponsor
and used as a method to actively capture AEs by a list of closed-
ended questions in real time on a daily basis from each subject.
The card collected information on AEs identified by the World
Allergy Organization (WAO) as local AEs of SLIT (see Table E1 in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).9 Each
day subjects captured any events that occurred within 60 minutes of
SLIT-tablet administration. During periods 1 and 3, subjects
captured events once daily after SLIT-tablet administration. During
period 2, subjects captured events twice daily, once after each SLIT-
tablet administration. AEs were also monitored during in-clinic visits
and by interviewing of subjects.
The intensity and relatedness to treatment of all AEs reported by
the subjects were assessed by the investigators. Per protocol, intensity
was assessed as mild (easily tolerated), moderate (discomfort enough
to interfere with daily activity), or severe (incapacitating with
inability to do work or usual activity). A modified WAO grading
system was applied programmatically as a secondary method for
grading the intensity. The WAO grading defines severity as follows:
Mild (grade 1): not troublesome and no symptomatic treatment
required and no discontinuation of SLIT because of local side effects;
moderate (grade 2): troublesome or requires symptomatic treatment
and no discontinuation of SLIT because of local side effects; severe
(grade 3): grade 2 and SLIT discontinued because of local side ef-
fects.9 To grade severity in a more objective way, the “troublesome”
component was not included in the modified version of the WAO
grading system.
Any AE considered possibly related to treatment was considered a
TRAE. Serious AEs were defined as any AE that was life-threatening
or resulted in death, persistent or significant disability, resulted in
hospitalization or prolonged an existing hospitalization, congenital
anomaly/birth defect, cancer, or other medically important event.

 There was 1 accidental overdose of 2 ragweed SLIT tablets with
subsequent development of mild throat irritation that was consid-
ered a serious AE per the study protocol, but did not meet the
regulatory requirement for seriousness. For this analysis, the event
was not considered a serious AE.
Statistical analyses
All safety analyses were conducted on all treated subjects.
Approximately 100 subjects were planned for the trial. With 100
subjects, the half-width of the 95% CI for an AE rate of 20% was
8.3. For the primary and secondary end points, the 95% CI was
calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. AEs captured via
subject interview and monitoring, as well as AEs captured on the
Side Effect Report Card, were all collected in the same database to
determine the incidence of AEs. Analyses were conducted using SAS
version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Subjects
A total of 102 subjects were enrolled in the study and included
in the analysis; 91 (89%) completed the study. Discontinuations
were due to AEs (n ¼ 9), protocol violation (n ¼ 1), and subject
withdrawal not related to treatment (n ¼ 1). The subjects’ de-
mographic characteristics are presented in Table I. No subject
reported having previously received allergen immunotherapy.
Overall safety
Overall compliance with the study medication was 96.1%.
Single and dual administrations of the SLIT tablets were well
tolerated. There were no reported severe swellings, systemic
allergic reactions, asthma exacerbations, events that met the
regulatory definition of serious, or reactions treated with
epinephrine during the trial. One subject accidentally took more
than 1 ragweed SLIT tablet during period 2 and developed mild
throat irritation. Overall, 95 subjects (93%) reported any
treatment-emergent AE, and 93 subjects (91%) experienced any
TRAE (Table II). There was a trend toward a declining pro-
portion of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs and TRAEs
over the course of the trial (Table II). In the last week of the trial,
54 subjects (53%) experienced TRAEs, and on the last day of the
trial, 7 subjects (7%) experienced TRAEs. The most commonly
reported TRAEs (�5% of the subjects) overall and during each
treatment period were throat irritation, oral pruritus, and ear
pruritus (see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jaci-inpractice.org). Most (99%) AEs were graded mild to
moderate. Tongue and mouth ulcerations assessed as treatment-
related were reported at an overall incidence of 12% and 17%,
respectively (see Table E2), and recurred for a median of 1 day
and 3 days, respectively. Investigators visually confirmed ulcers in
only 1 subject. All tongue and mouth ulcerations were assessed as
mild and did not contribute to any treatment discontinuations.
Assessment of local swellings
There were no local swellings in the mouth assessed as severe
in intensity. The proportions of subjects experiencing at least 1
event of local swelling were 14%, 22%, and 15% for periods 1,
2, and 3, respectively. For period 2, the proportion of subjects
experiencing local swellings was 17% with the ragweed SLIT
tablet and 14% with the grass SLIT tablet. Figure 2 shows the
onset and recurrence of all reported treatment-related local
swellings of any type or intensity (n ¼ 103). Most subjects
experienced local swellings that were assessed as mild; a few (n ¼
12) had swellings that were considered by the investigators to be
of moderate intensity. Overall, there were more events of local
swelling in period 2 due to the introduction of the ragweed tablet
and the onset of new local swellings associated with the grass
tablet. In period 3, the frequency of new-onset local swellings
decreased compared with period 2 (4% vs 17%, respectively).
Most swellings recurred for less than 15 days, suggesting reso-
lution of side effects.
Proportion of subjects with AEs
The proportions of subjects experiencing at least 1 local AE
were 71%, 69%, and 56% for periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Except for 1 event of throat irritation in period 3 that was
assessed as severe, all other local AEs were assessed as mild or
moderate in intensity (Figure 3). In period 3, the frequency of
new-onset local AEs decreased compared with that during period
2 (7% vs 50%, respectively). In the last week of the trial, 52
subjects (51%) experienced local AEs, and on the last day of the
trial, 5 subjects (5%) experienced local AEs.
The proportions of subjects who discontinued because of AEs
were 5%, 1%, and 3% for periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Of
the 9 discontinuations due to AEs, 8 were considered related to
treatment by the investigator (Table II). In general, the subjects
who discontinued often had multiple, persistent local AEs that
escalated in intensity over time. The 1 subject who discontinued
in period 2 experienced local AEs of mild intensity in period 1,
which escalated to moderate local AEs and upper abdominal
pain/nausea in period 2. The TRAEs (mild mouth edema and
moderate edema under the tongue) that led 2 subjects to dis-
continue in period 3 were newly-onset in period 3.
The proportions of subjects who experienced at least 1 local
AE that required symptomatic treatment were 4%, 4%, and 1%
for periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Out of the total 9 subjects
who required symptomatic treatment, 3 (3%) discontinued the
trial (n ¼ 2 in period 1, and n ¼ 1 in period 2); these AEs would
be graded as severe according to the WAO grading system. The
medications used to treat the local AEs included diphenhydra-
mine, cetirizine, loratadine, and pantoprazole.

 Recurrence, duration, and onset of local AEs
In general, most local AEs that were reported by more than 1
subject recurred by medians of 1 to 3 days (Table III). The
recurrence of mouth edema and tongue edema tended to be
slightly longer than that of other local AEs. During observed
doses at the clinic visits, the median durations of local AEs that
were reported by more than 1 subject generally ranged from 15
to 25 minutes (Table IV). Overall, the median onset of local AEs
that were reported by more than 1 subject in each treatment
period was generally within a week of treatment initiation
(Table V).
Patient satisfaction
Approximately 90% (89%, 91%, and 88% in periods 1, 2,
and 3, respectively) of the subjects throughout all the 3 periods
responded that they would definitely/probably take the medi-
cation if asked to do so by their doctor.

 DISCUSSION
Many patients are allergic to both grass and ragweed, and
simultaneous treatment of AR/C related to these allergens using
SLIT tablets would require dual-tablet administration. This trial is
the first to demonstrate a simple and well-tolerated method for
introducing dual and simultaneous administration of SLIT tablets.
The end points for this trial were selected on the basis of AEs of the
most clinical concern and with a frequency high enough to detect a
potential safety signal. The primary end point was the proportion
of subjects experiencing AEs with the potential to compromise the
upper airway (local swellings). It is encouraging that there were no
reported severe swellings in the mouth or throat, and all swellings
of any type were of mild or moderate intensity and of short
duration and recurrence. As expected, there were overall more
reports of local swellings during the period when the subjects were
introduced to the second allergen SLIT tablet (period 2) compared
with the period when subjects received the first allergen SLIT tablet
(period 1). It is of interest to note that the introduction of ragweed
allergen appears to influence new-onset swellings related to grass
SLIT tablet. This may be due to increased tissue hyperreactivity
related to ragweed allergen administered in the morning. However,
there was no increase in local swelling when comparing the 2
tablets during period 2 separately, and the intensity of local
swellings did not worsen (no local swellings assessed as severe were
reported during the trial). It still raises the question whether there
would be an increased risk of AEs or more severe AEs if 2 tablets are
introduced simultaneously from the start. The trial shows that if a
subject experiences a swelling it may occur later than the first day of
administration, and will typically be noticeable for approximately
20 minutes and reoccur for less than 15 days. Only 1 subject
discontinued because of AEs during period 2, indicating that the
AEs were tolerable for most subjects and local swellings were
noticeable but not bothersome. During the period when both
tablets were administered simultaneously (period 3), the propor-
tion of subjects experiencing local swelling was similar compared
with the period when subjects received only 1 SLIT tablet. In
addition, simultaneous administration was well tolerated. Only 1
subject experienced a severe AE (throat irritation), and simulta-
neous administration did not increase the proportion of subjects
experiencing any local AE, discontinuations due to AEs, or the
proportion of subjects using symptomatic medications to treat AEs
when compared with single SLIT-tablet administration.
The overall AE profile was similar to that observed with
pivotal trials of grass and ragweed SLIT tablets alone.3,4,7,8 The
overall incidence of treatment-emergent AE and TRAEs was
higher than that observed in pivotal trials, although, as in the
pivotal trials, most of the TRAEs in the present trial were not
severe. By period 3, the incidence of TRAEs and most of the
individual AEs was similar to that in pivotal trials. There are
several reasons that may explain the overall higher incidence of
AEs in this trial. One possibility is due to the use of the modified
WAO Side Effect Report Card. The solicitation of specific local
AEs with every tablet intake may have prompted subjects to be
more aware of perceived AEs, as opposed to retrospective
recollection at clinic visits. This phenomenon was demonstrated
in an analysis of 3 clinical trials, where the percentage of subjects
experiencing AEs was higher using solicited methods versus
unsolicited AE reporting.10 In the present trial, the lack of a
FIGURE 3. Proportion of subjects with at least 1 local AE by treatment period and intensity
. Subjects could be counted more than once
(ie, if a subject experienced both a moderate and a mild reaction, the subject was counted twice). The denominator used was all treated
subjects (n ¼ 102). *Both tablets attributed as the cause of the AE, or the investigator was not sure which tablet attributed to the AE.

 placebo comparison eliminated the ability to demonstrate that
the higher event rate was indeed due to soliciting AEs. Another
explanation is that the open-label trial design resulted in a
reporting bias. Whatever the reason for the higher incidence of
AEs, the overall rate of discontinuations due to AEs was 9%,
which was similar to that observed in pivotal trials (range of 5%-
10% for active treatments).3,4,7,8 More importantly, it appears
that sequential introduction of 2 SLIT tablets followed by
simultaneous administration did not result in reduced tolerability
or apparent increase in severe AEs. Furthermore, 88% of the
subjects in period 3 reported that they would use the treatment if
prescribed by their doctor. Together these data indicate that the
AEs experienced did not dissuade subjects from dual SLIT-tablet
treatment.
Mild events of mouth and tongue ulceration/sores, AEs spe-
cifically solicited on the WAO Side Effect Report Card, were
reported in this study, which were not as frequently reported in
pivotal trials. Investigators visually confirmed ulcers in only 1
subject, and it is uncertain whether the ulcer/sores were more a
sensation than an objective finding. The brief recurrence of the
ulcers suggests minimal mucosal lesions and suggests that sub-
jects may have misinterpreted the question as “sore mouth/
tongue.” A published case report suggests that mucosal lesions
could affect the safety of SLIT.11 Therefore, the prescribing in-
formation for ragweed and timothy grass SLIT tablet recom-
mends stopping treatment in the case of oral inflammation or
wounds to allow complete healing of the oral cavity.5,6
Few other studies have investigated the tolerability of SLIT
with multiple allergens. A postmarketing survey of 433 children
investigated the tolerability of SLIT drops with a single extract
versus a mixture of multiple extracts by soliciting AEs via diary
cards.12 During the follow-up period, there was no significant
difference in the incidence of AEs between children receiving
single or multiple extracts. Most of the AEs were mild and were

 equally distributed between the 2 groups. Three children dis-
continued because of persistent oral pruritus; 2 of the children
who discontinued were receiving multiple extracts. A double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 58 subjects was
primarily focused on the efficacy of single versus a mixture of
multiple allergen SLIT drops, but found no significant difference
in the number of AEs between these groups.13
The present trial was designed using an “add-on” dosing
approach. The use of sequential introduction of the SLIT tablets
ensured that tolerance to the first tablet was developed before the
introduction of the second tablet and that tolerance to both
tablets was established before simultaneous administration. The
proportion of subjects experiencing a new onset of local swelling
or local AEs was markedly lower in period 3 compared with that
in period 2, indicating that tolerance was indeed achieved before
simultaneous administration. During the trial, subjects who were
still experiencing AEs from a previous period were allowed to
continue into the next period. In real-world practice, physicians
should use discretion when proceeding to dual administration by
considering the characteristic and intensity of any recurring AE.
During period 2, the administration of the 2 tablets was at
different times of the day to allow subjects to determine which
tablet was the cause of an AE, if an AE occurred. The use of
medications to pretreat for AEs was prohibited to ensure
adequate safety monitoring, and the trial was conducted outside
the pollen seasons to reduce the incidence of AR/C symptomatic
medication use, which could confound AE reporting. This trial
was subject to the limitations inherent in open-label studies,
including reporting bias as mentioned above. Furthermore,
because of the overall low rate of systemic allergic reactions to
SLIT, the sample size in this study was not adequate to rule out
an increased risk of systemic allergic reactions with dual
administration and the results must therefore be interpreted with
caution. The safety of dual SLIT-tablet administration in pa-
tients with uncontrolled asthma was not assessed and is therefore
unknown. In addition, the population of subjects with asthma in
the present trial may have been overestimated because asthma
status was determined by clinical history and was not confirmed
by reversibility or challenge testing.
This trial demonstrated that a 4-week sequential SLIT-tablet
dosing schedule without uptitration followed by simultaneous
intake of ragweed and timothy grass tablets was well tolerated.
This study found that patients who tolerate both grass and
ragweed tablets when administration is separated by several hours
