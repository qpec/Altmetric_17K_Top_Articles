IMPORTANCE The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been increasing rapidly,
with current estimates of 1 in 68 children affected. Simultaneously, use of prenatal
ultrasonography has increased substantially, with limited investigation into its safety and
effects on brain development. Animal studies have demonstrated that prenatal
ultrasonography can adversely affect neuronal migration.
OBJECTIVE To quantify prenatal ultrasound exposure by the frequency, timing, duration, and
strength of ultrasonographic scans in children with later ASD, developmental delay, and
typical development.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control study included 107 patients with ASD,
104 control individuals with developmental delay, and 209 controls with typical
development. Participants were identified from medical records based on prenatal care and
delivery at Boston Medical Center, a diverse, academic, safety-net medical center, from July 1,
2006, through December 31, 2014, with a gestational age at birth of at least 37 weeks. Data
were analyzed from May 1, 2015, through November 30, 2017.
EXPOSURES Ultrasonographic exposure was quantified by the number and timing of scans,
duration of exposure, mean strength (depth, frame rate, mechanical index, and thermal
index), and time of Doppler and 3- and 4-dimensional imaging.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Among participants with ASD and controls with
developmental delay and typical development, ultrasound exposure was quantified and
compared per trimester and for the entire pregnancy, with adjustment for infant sex,
gestational age at birth, and maternal age.
RESULTS A total of 420 participants were included in the study (328 boys [78.1%] and 92 girls
[21.9%]; mean age as of January 1, 2016, 6.6 years; 95% CI, 6.5-6.8 years). The ASD group
received a mean of 5.9 scans (95% CI, 5.2-6.6), which was not significantly different from the
6.1 scans (95% CI, 5.4-6.8) in the developmental delay group or the 6.3 scans (95% CI,
5.8-6.8) in the typical development group. Compared with the typical development group,
the ASD group had shorter duration of ultrasound exposure during the first (290.4 seconds
[95% CI, 212.8-368.0 seconds] vs 406.4 seconds [95% CI, 349.5-463.3 seconds]) and
second (1687.6 seconds [95% CI, 1493.8-1881.4 seconds] vs 2011.0 seconds [95% CI,
1868.9-2153.1 seconds]) trimesters but no difference in the number of scans. The ASD group
had greater mean depth of ultrasonographic penetration than the developmental delay group
in the first trimester (12.5 cm [95% CI, 12.0-13.0 cm] vs 11.6 cm [95% CI, 11.1-12.1 cm]). The ASD
group had greater mean depth than the typical development group during the first (12.5 cm
[95% CI, 12.0-13.0 cm] vs 11.6 cm [95% CI, 11.3-12.0 cm]) and the second (12.9 cm [95% CI,
12.6-13.3 cm] vs 12.5 cm [95% CI, 12.2-12.7 cm]) trimesters.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found significantly greater mean depth of
ultrasonographic penetration in the ASD group compared with the developmental delay
group in the first trimester and compared with the typical development group in the first and
second trimesters. Further research is needed to determine whether other variables of
ultrasound exposure also have adverse effects on the developing fetus.

 A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of a group of
neurodevelopmental conditions causing significant
deficits in social communication and restricted and/or
repetitive behaviors that interfere with function.1 The preva-
lence of ASD has increased rapidly during the past several de-
cades, with current estimates of 1 in 68 individuals affected.2
Although this increase may in part be from changes in diag-
nostic criteria, heightened awareness and screening, and im-
proved diagnostic instruments, ongoing evidence points to an
increase in prevalence. Genetic causes of autism continue to
beidentifiedbutstillexplainfewerthanhalfofcases.Ofmount-
ing concern is that the increase in ASD may be partially ex-
plained by exposure to a variety of toxic environmental fac-
tors causing adverse effects to the developing fetus. For
example, recent data have shown an increased risk of ASD in
children born to mothers with obesity and pregestational or
gestational diabetes3 or herpes simplex virus type 2.4 A com-
bination of genetic predisposition and environmental expo-
sures likely contribute to a heightened risk for ASD. This study
assessed prenatal ultrasonography as a possible environmen-
tal exposure contributing to the increasing incidence of ASD.
As the incidence of ASD has sharply increased during
the past several decades,2 the use of prenatal ultrasonogra-
phy has also increased substantially. Ultrasonographic
technology is minimally regulated, resulting in significant
fetal ultrasound exposure5-8 with little research into its
safety.9,10 First-trimester use of ultrasonography has
become commonplace,11,12 with new technology resulting in
more detailed images requiring longer exposure and higher-
powered energy emission. Although prenatal ultrasonogra-
phy has generally been regarded as safe, most studies on
safety evaluated technology before 1992, when regulations
were stricter and machines were less powerful. Studies in
rodents6,13-15 have demonstrated that moderate amounts of
prenatal ultrasound exposure can adversely affect neuronal
migration and postnatal behavior, with a dose-response
relationship caused by ultrasound-induced hyperthermia
and/or mechanical cellular perturbation. Despite more than
10 years of speculation about a correlation between ultraso-
nography and ASD,9-11,16-18 few studies have assessed this
association14,19 and even fewer have evaluated effects of the
current use of ultrasonography. Our study explored whether
an association exists between fetal ultrasound exposure and
later ASD in a population of children born at Boston Medical
Center (BMC), an academic safety-net medical center serv-
ing a diverse population of families, many with low socio-
economic status. This research will add to the limited
knowledge about the current use of ultrasonographic tech-
nology with respect to the number, timing, duration of
exposure, and strength of prenatal scans and possible
adverse effects to the developing fetus.
Methods
Inthiscase-controlstudy,patientswithASDandcontrolgroups
with developmental delay (without ASD) or typical develop-
ment were identified retrospectively from medical records
stored in the Clinical Data Warehouse at BMC. Criteria for ini-
tial selection included (1) maternal prenatal care at BMC, (2)
birth at BMC from July 1, 2006, through December 31, 2014,
and (3) gestational age at birth of at least 37 weeks. Among this
population, we identified children with ASD, after which 1 con-
trol individual with developmental delay and 2 controls with
typical development were selected to correspond to each pa-
tient with ASD by sex, birthdate (±90 days), and maternal age
(±3 years). Approval for this study was obtained from the in-
stitutional review board at Boston University Medical Center,
which waived the need for informed consent for this retro-
spective medical record review.
Identification of Cases
Diagnosis of ASD was performed by a developmental-
behavioral pediatrician and based on codes 299.00, 299.10,
299.80,and299.90fromtheInternationalClassificationofDis-
eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), confirmed by Autism Diagnos-
ticObservationSchedulefindings20orbyDSM-IVorDSM-5cri-
teria.Diagnosisofdevelopmentaldelaywithoutaccompanying
ASD was identified by ICD-9 codes 783.4, 315.9, 317, 318, and
319 and required deficits in at least 2 developmental do-
mains. Children with typical development had no past or
present symptoms of ASD, developmental delay, or other neu-
rologic abnormalities. Cases of multiple gestation and those
with missing ultrasonographic data were excluded.
Ultrasonographic Data Collection
We obtained ultrasonographic data from the Viewpoint Data-
base and/or the Centricity Picture Archiving and Communica-
tion System at BMC. Data collected from each scan included
gestational age at scan, total time of exposure, time-weighted
mean depth, frame rate (number of ultrasound pulses per sec-
ond), mechanical index, soft-tissue thermal index, total time
of Doppler use, and total time using 3-dimensional (3-D) and
4-D imaging.
Time of exposure was calculated based on screenshots
taken throughout the scan, with the time stamp on the first
screenshot marking the start time and the time stamp on the
Key Points
Question Is prenatal ultrasonography frequency, timing, duration,
or strength associated with later diagnosis of autism spectrum
disorder?
Findings In this case-control study of 420 children, those with
autism spectrum disorder were exposed to greater mean depth of
ultrasonographic penetration during the first and second
trimesters compared with typically developing children and during
the first trimester compared with developmentally delayed
children. No association between the number of scans or duration
of ultrasound exposure and later autism spectrum disorder was
found.
Meaning Increased depth of prenatal ultrasonographic
penetration may be associated with perturbations in fetal
neuronal cortical migration and later autism spectrum disorder;
this correlation deserves further study.

 final screenshot marking the end time. Consequently, all val-
ues calculated represent the minimum duration of ultra-
sound exposure because participants may have had addi-
tional ultrasound exposure not documented by screenshots
storedinthedatabaseor,lesslikely,additionalexposureatout-
side prenatal imaging centers. Time gaps of greater than 5 min-
utes between screenshots were assumed to indicate real gaps
in ultrasound exposure and were not included in the calcula-
tion of overall exposure time. These cutoffs were based on
analysisoftherawultrasonographicdatathatshowedfewgaps
longer than 5 minutes and on discussion with multiple ultra-
sonographic technicians at BMC.
For time-weighted variables (depth, frame rate, mechani-
cal index, and soft-tissue thermal index), we calculated a
weighted mean based on duration at each setting. When cal-
culating duration at each setting, we used the midpoint be-
tween 2 screenshots as the estimated point when settings were
changed. We also evaluated exposure by trimester, as de-
fined by the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecol-
ogy as gestational age no greater than 13 weeks 6 days in the
first trimester, 14 weeks 0 days to 27 weeks 6 days in the sec-
ond trimester, and at least 28 weeks in the third trimester.21
For the trimester analysis, ultrasonographic variables mea-
suringthemechanicalindexandsoft-tissuethermalindexwere
excluded because they were only intermittently recorded, par-
ticularly during third-trimester scans.

characteristics or perinatal risk factors (Table 1).
When considering pregnancies in their entirety, we found
no statistically significant difference in the timing of the ini-
tial ultrasonographic scan (Table 1), the number of scans, or
the total time of ultrasound exposure in the ASD group com-
pared with the developmental delay group. In addition, we
found no difference in time-weighted mean depth, frame rate,

 During the first trimester, time-weighted mean depth of
scans in the ASD group was greater (12.5 cm; 95% CI, 12.0-
13.0 cm) than in the developmental delay group (11.6 cm; 95%
CI, 11.1-12.1 cm). The ASD group also had longer duration of 4-D
imaging exposure (6.6 seconds; 95% CI, 1.0 to 12.2 seconds)
than did the developmental delay group (0.8 seconds; 95% CI,
−4.7to6.2seconds).Nootherultrasonographicmeasuresquan-
tified by trimester were different between the ASD and devel-
opmental delay groups (Table 3). After eliminating the chil-
dren who received late prenatal care, a difference in mean
depth remained during the first trimester in the ASD group
(12.3 cm; 95% CI, 11.9-12.7 cm) compared with the develop-
mental delay group (11.5 cm; 95% CI, 11.2-11.8 cm).
ASD vs Typical Development Groups
Mothers of children with ASD were more likely than mothers
of children with typical development to be 35 years or older
(32[29.9%]vs41[19.6%]).Inaddition,mothersofchildrenwith
ASD were more likely to be late registrants for prenatal care
compared with mothers of children with typical develop-
ment (8 [7.5%] vs 3 [1.4%]) (Table 1). Time-weighted mean
depth of penetration was higher in the ASD group during first
(12.5 cm [95% CI, 12.0-13.0 cm] vs 11.6 cm [95% CI, 11.3-
12.0 cm]), second (12.9 cm [95% CI, 12.6-13.3 cm] vs 12.5 cm
[95% CI, 12.2-12.7 cm]), and third (15.1 cm [95% CI, 14.7-
15.5 cm] vs 14.8 cm [95% CI, 14.5-15.0 cm]) trimesters. We ob-
served no difference in other ultrasonographic variables mea-
sured across the entire pregnancy (Tables 2 and 3).

statistically significant differences were noted in any ultraso-
nographic variables during the third trimester (Table 3).
After eliminating children who received late prenatal care,
the ASD group still had a greater mean ultrasonographic depth
than the typical development group during the total preg-
nancy (13.5 cm [95% CI, 13.1-13.8 cm] vs 12.9 cm [95% CI, 12.6-

but we found no difference in the number of scans in any
trimester.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the most detailed analysis to
date of 21st century prenatal ultrasound exposure. Prenatal
use of ultrasonography has increased substantially during
the past several decades, with limited investigation of its
possible adverse effects on neuronal migration and fetal
brain development. Multiple articles have stressed the need
to investigate further the role that prenatal ultrasound expo-
sure, particularly during the first trimester, may play in later
development of autism.7,10,11,18,22 Of note, the mean number
of total scans in our study was more than 5, considerably
more than the 1 to 2 scans recommended by the American
Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology in low-risk
pregnancies.23,24 Use of screening prenatal ultrasonography
in low-risk pregnancies offers no improvement in neonatal
outcomes compared with prenatal ultrasonography used
only when medically necessary.25,26 The American Congress
of Obstetrics and Gynecology recently stated, “Ultrasound
energy delivered to the fetus cannot be assumed to be com-
pletely innocuous, and the possibility exists that such bio-
logical effects may be identified in the future.

 evaluation of the safety of contemporary prenatal ultra-
sound exposure is critical.
Exposuretoadverseenvironmentaleffectsduringallstages
of pregnancy can influence neuronal migration in the brain.
Animal studies demonstrate that prenatal ultrasound expo-
sure may activate the differentiation of neural progenitor cells
and result in extended proliferation and erroneous distribu-
tion of neurons within the cortical layers, increasing the risk
for neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including ASD.9,17,18
Outside obstetrics, energy generated by ultrasound can pro-
duce focused tissue ablation, taking advantage of the modali-
ty’
s hyperthermic properties.27 Hyperthermia is a known te-
ratogen during pregnancy, and even small increases in fetal
tissue temperature owing to ultrasonography can be suffi-
cient to cause tissue damage.28-30 Furthermore, effects of fe-
tal tissue hyperthermia may be underestimated owing to dif-
ferences in structure and density of fetal tissue compared with
adult tissue.28,30
Studies in animals have shown ultrasonography to have
adverse effects on the developing brain.15,31,32, In mice, ultra-
sound exposure in utero for 30 minutes or longer during
neuronal migration to the cerebral cortex caused neurons to
fail to acquire their correct cortical position. Instead, neu-
rons remained scattered in various cortical and subcortical
layers, with the degree of maldispersion positively associ-
ated with the amount of ultrasound exposure.13 In addition,
mice exposed to 30 minutes of ultrasound at fetal day 14.5
(the peak of brain development in mice) were significantly
less social 3 weeks after birth than were mice exposed to
sham ultrasound.14
A large cohort study of infants33 from 1976 to 1978 found
thatthoseexposedtoultrasoundhadanoddsratioof1.32(95%
CI, 1.16-1.51) for being left-handed, a finding that was con-
firmed in subsequent meta-analyses.34,35 These studies sug-
gest that ultrasound exposure can influence cerebral hemi-
spheric specialization. Höglud Carlsson et al19 demonstrated
no significant difference in incidence of ASD after exposure to
ultrasound at 12 vs 18 weeks of gestational age, but the inves-
tigators quantified use of ultrasonography with 15-year-old
data. These studies assessed the effects of ultrasonography at
lower frequency and power than used today, and the findings
cannot necessarily be extrapolated to current technologies.

 Our study demonstrated no increase in the number of pre-
natalscansordurationofultrasoundexposureinchildrenwith
later ASD compared with controls with developmental delay
or typical development. In fact, the ASD group had overall
shorter duration of scans during the first and second trimes-
ters compared with controls with typical development. The
children with ASD received their first scan a mean of 10 days
later than those with typical development, were more likely
to have received late prenatal care, and were more likely to be
born to mothers 35 years or older. Even after eliminating those
with late prenatal care, children with ASD still had shorter du-
ration of ultrasound exposure in the first and second trimes-
ters. Socioeconomic factors, such as access to care, are likely
at play in these associations because lower socioeconomic sta-
tus has been associated with an increased risk of ASD36 and
probably with less access to prenatal care. Of note, our study
did not find an increase in gestational diabetes, pregesta-
tional diabetes, or obesity in the mothers of the children with
ASD compared with mothers of children with typical devel-
opment, in contrast to the recent findings of Li et al.3
Time-weighted mean depth of ultrasonography in the first
and second trimesters was greater in the ASD group com-
pared with the group with typical development, with no ac-
companying difference in maternal body mass index. We also
found a greater time-weighted mean depth in the first trimes-
ter in the ASD group compared with the developmental delay
group, although this association may be influenced by greater
obesity in mothers of children with ASD compared with moth-
ers of children with developmental delay (because greater ul-
trasonographicdepthisrequiredforimaginginobesemothers).
Although our study specifically observed an association
between increased ultrasonographic depth and later ASD,
multiple factors are likely related to ultrasonographic strength,
and larger sample sizes will be needed to clarify these
associations.
Our study is, to our knowledge, the first one known to in-
vestigate different variables of ultrasound exposure in con-
junction with later ASD or nonautistic developmental delay.
Increased depth of ultrasonography may be associated with
injury to the fetal brain resulting from mechanical neuronal
perturbation and/or hyperthermia, as demonstrated in mice
models.13,15 As ultrasonographic depth increases, wave fre-
quency and strength decrease, but the volume of fetal tissue
exposed to ultrasonic energy increases because the wave en-
ergy dissipates in a wedge shape. Therefore, use of greater-
depth ultrasonography may be more likely to alter subepen-
dymal or germinal matrix cell migration rather than the more
superficial cerebral cortical cells of the developing brain. In ad-
dition, the dispersion of energy to include more bone (ie, fe-
tal skull) may allow for increased overall intracranial tempera-
ture because of the high acoustic energy absorption in bone
that rapidly converts to thermal energy, which is conducted
to nearby soft tissue. The amount of energy to which the fetal
brain is exposed during ultrasonography is still largely an ap-
proximation estimated by the mechanical index and soft-
tissue thermal index (which take into consideration acoustic
pressure, acoustic frequency, and acoustic power at a given
depth). The association between ultrasonographic variables,
such as depth and frequency, and overall energy exposure is
highly dependent on the type of tissue being imaged.37,38 More
accurate measurement of ultrasonographic-induced mechani-
cal and thermal changes in the fetus is needed to understand
the association between ultrasonographic variables and po-
tential adverse effects on the fetus.
Doppler studies pose the highest risk for thermal effects
on the fetus, because the intensity and acoustic power are the
highestamongalltypesofultrasonographyandmaycausesub-
stantial temperature increase in the fetal skull and surround-
ing brain tissue.6 The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gy-
necology reports no clinical benefit of 3- or 4-D imaging and
suggests that conventional 2-D ultrasonography be the
standard.24 All US guidelines suggest following the ALARA (as
low as reasonably achievable) principle during ultrasound
exposure,39 but the ALARA principle does not provide any spe-
cific, evidence-based limit for safe use.23,24,39 Although our
study did not observe a difference in the timing or duration
ofDoppler,3-D,or4-DstudiesintheASDgroupcomparedwith
the developmental delay or typical development groups, fur-
ther assessment of these modalities is needed to better un-
derstand their mechanical and/or thermal effects on brain
development.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. It was retrospective, rely-
ing on ultrasonographic screenshots as a proxy for determin-
ing overall exposure, which may have underestimated or in-
sufficiently represented exposure duration, although identical
methods and assumptions were applied to all scans. In addi-
tion, the study excluded preterm infants, who are known to
be at higher risk for ASD3 but who receive fewer scans be-
cause of their shorter gestation. Furthermore, we did not have
accurate data on maternal smoking, a variable associated with
an increased ASD risk.3 Because a complex association may ex-
ist among maternal body mass index, gestational diabetes, ul-
trasonographic depth, and/or overall exposure and later ASD,
further evaluation of these intertwined variables is needed.
In the future, a large prospective cohort study will be a
more definitive way to evaluate possible associations be-
tween prenatal ultrasound exposure and later risk of ASD. Fu-
ture studies should more closely document total exposure
across all trimesters of pregnancy. More research is needed to
evaluate the various types of ultrasound exposure, including
Doppler and 3- and 4-D imaging, and their potential terato-
genicity. In addition, future studies should compare transab-
dominal and transvaginal approaches, which likely affect fe-
tal exposure. Finally, a larger and broader study population
would allow for more comprehensive evaluation of the inter-
play between maternal demographics and other environmen-
tal factors that likely affect ultrasonographic timing and
strength and later risk for autism.
Conclusions
In this detailed study of prenatal use of ultrasonography, we
found no significant difference in the number or duration of

further study in animal and human populations. Studies are
