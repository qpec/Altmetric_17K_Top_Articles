Summary
Despite calls for the routine implementation of pre-operative exercise programmes to optimise patient fitness before
elective major surgery, there is no practical guidance for providing safe and effective exercise in this specific context.
The following clinical guideline was developed following a review of the evidence on the effects of pre-operative exer-
cise interventions. We developed a series of best-practice and, where possible, evidence-based statements to advise on
patient care with respect to exercise training in the peri-operative period. These statements cover: patient selection
for exercise training in surgical patients; integration of exercise training into multi-modal prehabilitation pro-
grammes; and advice on exercise prescription factors and follow-up. Although we acknowledge that further research
is needed to identify the optimal exercise prescription in different clinical scenarios, we urge peri-operative teams to
make use of these recommendations.

Summary of key recommendations
1
Pre-operative exercise training should be offered
to
patients
scheduled
for
major
or
complex
elective surgery with a view to improving their
physical fitness and health status and reducing the
risk of peri-operative morbidity and mortality. If
resources are limited, priority of referral to pre-
operative exercise training should go to patients
who are at increased risk of peri-operative compli-
cations, such as those with low cardiorespiratory
fitness.
2
Pre-operative exercise training should be offered
as part of a multi-modal prehabilitation pro-
gramme that addresses a variety of peri-operative
risk factors including cigarette smoking, excessive
alcohol consumption, and anaemia.
3
Healthcare professionals making referrals to a pre-
operative exercise programme should have basic
knowledge about what the programme entails and
its potential effects. A pre-operative exercise pro-
gramme should be presented to the patient by the
referring clinician as a fundamental part of their

 pre-operative optimisation, rather than an optional
extra.
4
The referral process and/or the initial assessment
for pre-operative exercise training offer an impor-
tant opportunity to explore the patient’s under-
standing of exercise, address concerns and educate
patients about the benefits of exercise training,
both during the peri-operative period and in the
longer term. The referral/assessment stage also
provides an opportunity to assess and refer for
treatment of comorbidities before commencing
exercise training.
5
The setting of the pre-operative exercise pro-
gramme, skill mix of the team, and other comor-
bidities should always be considered in the risk
assessment of patients entering the programme.
6
Patients
should
undergo
thorough
assessment
before commencing pre-operative exercise train-
ing. The assessment should identify: contraindica-
tions to exercise; current health status, including
comorbidities; current treatments, including medi-
cations; ongoing investigations; and prior and cur-
rent levels of physical activity. The assessment
should also ideally include an objective evaluation
of functional capacity and a questionnaire-based
assessment of quality of life.
7
The patient’s response to exercise training should
be evaluated using repeat assessments of func-
tional capacity and quality of life. Clinical out-
comes and patient experience should also be
documented.
8
Early identification and referral of patients who
may benefit from pre-operative exercise training is
essential to allow sufficient time to intervene. Ide-
ally, pre-operative exercise training should com-
mence as early in the surgical pathway as possible,
ensuring
a
minimum
training
duration
of
four weeks.
9
To ensure endurance, strength and respiratory
muscle function benefits, ideally a combination of
aerobic training, resistance training and inspira-
tory muscle training should be delivered during a
pre-operative exercise programme. The frequency,
intensity and duration of each exercise component
should be tailored to each patient, taking into con-
sideration their initial fitness and health status.
10
The pre-operative exercise programme should be
supervised and delivered by individuals with rele-
vant expertise. Self-managed (unsupervised) exer-
cise training is feasible but patients must be
carefully selected. Mechanisms for offering remote
support and provision of home exercise equip-
ment should also be considered.
Why was this clinical guideline
developed?
In the past few years, there have been several system-
atic reviews on the effects of pre-operative exercise
training in patients awaiting elective major surgery
[1–5]. These reviews highlight sufficient clinical trial
data to support pre-operative exercise training as being
safe and efficacious. However, to facilitate the transla-
tion of this evidence into clinical practice, clinicians
must know sufficient details about appropriate and
effective exercise interventions and their components.
Therefore, the aim of this document is to provide a
practical, evidence-based guideline on how to deliver
pre-operative exercise training to patients awaiting
major, non-cardiac surgery. This guideline is aimed
primarily at practitioners within the UK. This includes
anaesthetists, surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, gen-
eral practitioners and other healthcare professionals. It
is intended to inform those conducting pre-operative
exercise programmes and also those who manage sur-
gical patients who may be referred into a prehabilita-
tion service.
Background to pre-operative exercise
training
The prevalence of physical inactivity is high world-
wide, particularly in older adults [6, 7]. Chronic physi-
cal inactivity accelerates the age-associated declines in
maximal aerobic capacity and functional fitness [8, 9]
and increases the risk of developing several chronic
health conditions, including cardiovascular
disease,
obesity, colon and breast cancer, and Type-2 diabetes
[10].
The resultant effects of chronic physical inactivity
may place individuals at an increased risk of complica-
tions when undergoing major or complex surgery. For
example, there is developing evidence of an association
between
low
cardiorespiratory
fitness
and
adverse

 peri-operative outcomes across a range of surgical spe-
cialties [11]. Although many surgical, anaesthetic and
patient-related factors contribute to outcome, a critical
factor appears to be the body’s physiological reserve to
cope with the neuro-endocrine stress imposed by major
surgery [12]. Individuals unable to meet this demand
appear to be at highest risk of developing peri-operative
complications [13], as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Recently published data demonstrate the potential
contextual relevance of peri-operative fitness to meet
this demand, with in-hospital mortality rates of 0.5–
3.6% for patients undergoing major surgery in the UK
[14, 15]. Non-fatal complications occur far more fre-
quently and may affect patients well beyond hospital
discharge [16, 17]. Reduced quality of life and inde-
pendence, increased rates of readmission, reduced
longer term survival and an increased health economic
burden may all follow. Healthcare professionals work-
ing across peri-operative medicine should develop
strategies to address this problem [18–20].
Improving fitness before surgery through exercise
training seems a logical step in achieving this, and is
termed ‘prehabilitation’ [21]. Prehabilitation initiatives
aim to create sufficient physiological reserve to deal
with the subsequent surgical stress response, leading to
a reduced risk of peri-operative complications. This
concept is detailed in Fig. 1. The idea of utilising the
broader pre-operative encounter to optimise patient
health is attractive, with patients potentially more
responsive to lifestyle behaviour change at this time
(i.e. surgery as a ‘teachable moment’ [22]).
Referral and assessment of patients for
pre-operative exercise training
A number of recommendations can be made about the
referral process for pre-operative exercise training.
First, early identification and referral are essential to
allow sufficient time to intervene. Ideally, prehabilita-
tion initiatives should commence as early in the
surgical pathway as possible, with a minimum of
four weeks of exercise training being desirable for
meaningful improvements in fitness to be achieved.
Second, patients who are being referred for prehabilita-
tion should be given oral and written information
about what this will entail and the potential benefits.
Experience from pulmonary rehabilitation indicates
that the uptake and effects of prehabilitation may be
positively influenced by the initial clinician interaction
and by what information is provided about the pro-
gramme [23–25]. Initial discussions with the patient
should also seek to identify their goals for prehabilita-
tion, which should then be recorded, and may aid
Figure 1 The prehabilitation concept. Following major surgical intervention all patients experience an acute drop in
physiological reserve/functional capacity followed by a recovery and rehabilitation phase (A). A low physiological
reserve/functional capacity may increase the risk of peri-operative complications and lead to a slower, sometimes
incomplete recovery (B). A prehabilitated patient may possess greater physiological reserve/functional capacity at the
time of surgery, facilitating a more rapid and complete recovery (C). Crucially, in the event of a complicated recov-
ery, prehabilitated patients may be better placed to retain their functional independence and quality of life in the
longer term (D).

 motivation. The type of healthcare professional that
undertakes these initial discussions and provides rele-
vant information may differ between settings according
to local patient pathways, but referrals should always
be made by people who have at least a basic knowl-
edge about what the programme entails and its poten-
tial
effects.
Furthermore,
pre-operative
exercise
training should be presented by the referring clinician
as a fundamental component of pre-operative prepara-
tion, rather than an optional extra.
Ideally, pre-operative exercise training should be
offered to all patients undergoing elective major or
complex surgery, with the aim of improving physiolog-
ical and functional reserve to both reduce the risk of
peri-operative morbidity and mortality, and facilitate
postoperative recovery of functional capacity. However,
if resources are limited, priority of referral to pre-
operative exercise training should go to patients who
are at increased risk of peri-operative complications,
such as those with low cardiorespiratory fitness. Fig. 2
highlights
a
potential
decision
making
tool
for
identifying those patients who may benefit most from
a pre-operative exercise programme.
Patients should undergo thorough screening and
baseline
assessment
before
starting
pre-operative
exercise training. As a minimum, patient baseline char-
acteristics, surgical indication and comorbidities, and
any relevant investigations and treatments, should all
be recorded. Any contraindications to exercise should
be identified, such as unstable angina, uncontrolled
hypertension, significant aortic stenosis, acute illness or
fever, and uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias (see [27]
for full list). Risk assessment should be performed
using recognised criteria. Objective baseline evaluation
of physical fitness (e.g. cardiopulmonary exercise test-
ing, 6-min walk distance), activity levels and health-
related quality of life are recommended to inform the
exercise prescription and the level of supervision
required; however, an initial supervised period is rec-
ommended for most patients. Repeat assessments are
recommended where possible at the end of the pro-
gramme, before surgery, to allow for monitoring of
Figure 2 Flow chart to assist clinicians in identifying patients who may benefit from pre-operative exercise training.
This should be used in conjunction with clinical judgement and locally available options. See relevant NICE guidance
[26] for examples of major/complex elective surgery.

 programme effectiveness, as with UK cardiac rehabili-
tation services [28].
Evaluation of other potentially harmful lifestyle
factors, such as smoking status and alcohol consump-
tion, is recommended as part of the initial evaluation
as ‘clustering’ [29] is common. Where concerns are
identified, referral to relevant services is recommended
due to the cumulative potential negative effects on
peri-operative outcomes in at-risk individuals [30, 31].
Pre-operative exercise training:
evidence and recommendations
The recommendations included in this guideline were
based on the best available evidence. A systematic
search process was undertaken to identify systematic
reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled
trials that compared the effect of pre-operative exercise
training with standard care or a ‘control condition’ on
cardiorespiratory fitness and postoperative outcomes in
adults awaiting elective major non-cardiac surgery.
The study search and selection processes are presented
in Appendices S1–S3 in Supporting Information.
The database search yielded 57 records, 42 of
which were ineligible on title and abstract screening.
Inspection of the reference lists and citations of the
remaining 15 records yielded a further 28 potentially
eligible records. Thirty-four out of the 43 records were
systematic
reviews
of
prehabilitation
interventions
before major surgery, and a further six were non-sys-
tematic literature reviews on this topic. However, 39
out of the 43 records that underwent full-text screen-
ing
were
excluded,
with
reasons
described
in
Appendix S3 in Supporting Information. Four system-
atic reviews were eligible for inclusion [2–5]. Four
recently published randomised controlled trials that we
were aware of were also included [32–35]. These stud-
ies had not been included in any of the included
reviews, so their inclusion provided a more compre-
hensive representation of the current evidence base.
General
characteristics
of
the
four
systematic
reviews and four randomised controlled trials are
shown in Table 1. All were published in 2016 or 2017.
A total of 21 relevant individual randomised controlled
trials including 1057 participants were identified. Two
randomised controlled trials [36, 37] overlapped across
two of the systematic reviews [3, 4]. A list of the
included
reviews
and
trials
is
presented
in
Appendix S4 in Supporting Information. Three sys-
tematic reviews included meta-analyses on the effects
of
pre-operative
exercise
training
[2,
4,
5]:
one
Cochrane review had a target population of patients
undergoing lung resection surgery for non-small cell
lung cancer and co-primary outcomes of postoperative
pulmonary complications and postoperative duration
of intercostal catheter use [2]; one review focused on
patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and had
co-primary outcomes of postoperative mortality, dura-
tions of stay in hospital and the intensive care unit,
and ‘all postoperative complications’ [4]; and one
review was of people with cancer undergoing both
neo-adjuvant cancer treatment and surgery, which did
not specify a primary outcome [5]. The remaining
review included studies of patients undergoing major
abdominal cancer surgery [3]. All reviews used recog-
nised tools to assess methodological risk of bias in
their included studies. Of the four additional trials we
identified,
two
included
patients
awaiting
elective
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
repair
[34,
35],
one
included patients awaiting lung resection surgery for
non-small cell lung cancer [33], and one included
adults aged ≥ 70 years undergoing major abdominal
surgery [32].
The role and structure of pre-operative exercise
programmes
As highlighted, one of the main aims of pre-operative
exercise training is to increase physiological reserve to
minimise the risk of peri-operative complications.
However, through the literature appraisal process we
identified that the rationale for pre-operative exercise
training varied between the 21 trials, forming six cate-
gories: to reduce postoperative pulmonary complica-
tions by improving pulmonary function (four studies);
to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications by
improving pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory
fitness (five studies); to reduce postoperative pul-
monary complications and enhance the postoperative
recovery of functional capacity (one study); to reduce
postoperative complications and enhance the postoper-
ative recovery of functional capacity (two studies); to
reduce postoperative complications by improving car-
diorespiratory fitness (seven studies); to improve or

 maintain cardiopulmonary/cardiometabolic health dur-
ing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (two studies).
Clarifying
the
rationale
for
prehabilitation
is
important because this will inform the exercise pre-
scription. This relates to the training principle of
specificity, whereby the exercises used should be rele-
vant and appropriate to the desired outcome. With
this in mind, it is perhaps unsurprising that all 10
interventions targeting a reduction in postoperative
pulmonary complications included respiratory muscle
training, either in isolation (four studies), in combi-
nation with aerobic exercise training (four studies) or
in combination with aerobic and resistance exercise
training (two studies). The remaining 11 interventions
all included an aerobic exercise component, either in
isolation (six studies), in combination with resistance
training (four studies), or resistance training and
respiratory
muscle
training
(one
study).
Another
example of specificity is that all interventions aimed
at enhancing
the postoperative recovery of func-
tional capacity included resistance training, muscle
strength being an important determinant of func-
tional status.
Detailed descriptions of the interventions used in
the 21 trials are provided in Appendix S5 in Support-
ing Information. Here, an overview of the three main
exercise
components
(respiratory
muscle
training,
aerobic training and resistance training) is provided.
Specific
recommendations
are
presented
after
the
effects of pre-operative exercise training on important
fitness and health outcomes have been summarised.
Inspiratory muscle training was the main form of
respiratory muscle training, being clearly described in
eight out of the 11 respiratory muscle training compo-
nents. The frequency of inspiratory muscle training
ranged from three sessions per week to twice daily,
with sessions typically lasting 15 min (range 10–
30 min). The participants were trained to use an inspi-
ratory threshold-loading device with a load typically in
the range of 10–60% of maximal inspiratory pressure,
although one study described an interval training
approach involving six cycles of six inspirations at 60–
80% of maximum inspiratory pressure, interspersed by
rest intervals of 5–60 s [38]. In at least three interven-
tions, perceived exertion was used to guide the pro-
gression of training, aiming to maintain a moderate/
somewhat hard (two studies) or hard (one study)
intensity during each session.
The most common aerobic exercise modality was
cycle ergometry, present in 10 out of the 17 aerobic
training components. Treadmill or normal overground
walking was included in eight interventions. Other
aerobic modalities included recumbent cross-trainer
(n = 2), rowing ergometry (n = 1) and arm ergometry
(n = 1). Eight aerobic components involved continuous
training, five involved interval training, one involved a
combination of continuous and interval training, and
two involved circuit-based training. The specific format
of aerobic training was unclear in the remaining study.
In nine interventions, the intensity of exercise was
guided using heart rate responses (n = 3), perceived
exertion (n = 3) or using both approaches (n = 3). Aer-
obic training was most commonly undertaken for 30–
45 min per session (range 10–60 min) and three to
seven times per week (range 1–15 sessions).
Of the seven resistance training components, six
included a combination of upper- and lower-body
exercises, and one included only lower-body exercises.
Details on the specific exercises used were poorly
reported.
Two
interventions
involved
circuit-based
training, two involved use of elastic resistance bands,
two involved functional exercises (e.g. chair sit-to-
stand), and three involved dumbbells or fixed resis-
tance machines. One study reported using two sets of
10–12 repetitions for each exercise, whereas another
used single-set training at an 8–15 repetition maxi-
mum. The frequency of resistance training ranged
from two to four sessions per week.
Eleven out of the 21 interventions were supervised,
mostly in a clinical setting (n = 9; for example, hospital
physiotherapy gym or outpatient clinic). Three interven-
tions were unsupervised, and seven involved a mixture
of supervised and unsupervised exercise training. The
duration of pre-operative exercise training most com-
monly ranged from two to four weeks (n = 15, 71%),
but was 12 to 16 weeks in the two studies of patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy [29, 30].

One study reported no in-hospital
deaths in either group [51]. Pooled data
from four studies (n = 158) showed PET
reduced postoperative pulmonary
complications by 67% (RR (95%CI) 0.33
(0.17–0.61)). Postoperative LOS was also
lower in the exercise group (MD (95%
CI) �4.24 days (�5.43 to �3.06);
4 studies)
One study [61] reported an improvement in _
VO2peak from baseline
to post-intervention in the PET group (14.9 � 2.3 ml.kg�1.min�1
to 17.8 � 2.1 ml.kg�1.min�1; p < 0.01), with no change in the
control group (p > 0.05)
‘(PET) may reduce the risk of
developing a postoperative

interpreted with caution due
to disparities between the
studies, risk of bias, and small
sample sizes’
Hijazi et al. [3]
Severity of postoperative complications
was graded in three studies using the
Clavien–Dindo classification. In one
study [36], patients whose functional
capacity deteriorated during PET were
at higher risk of complications. There
was no significant difference in
complications between groups in the
other studies [37, 41]
In one study [62], PET increased _
VO2peak by
2.51 ml.kg�1.min�1 (p = 0.002)
‘delivery of such programs is
feasible’
‘findings and recommendations
are limited by the
heterogeneity in the literature’
Limitation: One of the included
studies used an intervention
that also included
postoperative exercise training

Moran et al. [4]
No deaths were reported in any
study. Pooled data from nine studies
showed a 41% reduction postoperative
complications in PET vs. control (OR
(95%CI) 0.59 (0.38–0.91)). There were
no significant differences in LOS
between exercise and control groups
(MD (95%CI) �1.62 days (�7.57 to 4.33);

In one study [36], _
VO2peak increased from 1.395 � 76 to

(p = 0.003) and from 1.400 � 71 to 1.511 � 84 ml.min�1 in a
walking and breathing group (p = 0.007)
‘(PET) appears to be beneficial
in decreasing the incidence of
postoperative complications;
however, more high-quality
studies are needed to validate
its use in the preoperative
setting.’
Limitation: The methodological
quality of studies was very low,
and two of the included
studies did not isolate the
effects of PET ([59] and [63])

 following pre-operative exercise training, as measured
using cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All seven of
these studies reported data on peak oxygen uptake, with
five studies demonstrating a statistically significant
improvement following pre-operative exercise training.
In those five studies, the improvement relative to con-
trol was consistently greater than 2.5 ml.kg�1.min�1; a
change that is likely to be clinically important [35]. The
limited effect on peak oxygen uptake in the two remain-
ing studies may be due to the use of an active compara-
tor in one study [36] and a lower-than-intended
intensity of exercise in the other [35, 39].
Only two trials reported data on anaerobic thresh-
old (expressed in ml.kg�1.min�1), which is perhaps
surprising given the interest that has been placed on
this variable as an indicator of fitness for surgery [13].
In the study by Barakat et al. [34], which assessed the
effects of circuit-based pre-operative exercise training
before
elective
abdominal
aortic
aneurysm
repair
(n = 124), anaerobic threshold increased from median
[IQR] 12.0 [10.4–14.5] ml.kg�1.min�1 at baseline to 13.9
[10.6–15.1] ml.kg�1.min�1 at pre-surgery (p = 0.012).
There was no significant change in the control group
(�0.2 ml.kg�1.min�1, p = 0.532). These findings were
limited by pre- and post-training cardiopulmonary
exercise test data only being recorded for 33 out of 62
exercise and 15 out of 62 control participants and the
analysis of within-group changes rather than between-
group differences. In contrast, the study of Tew et al.
[35], which also involved patients awaiting elective
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 53), showed no
substantial
between-group
difference
in
anaerobic
threshold following four weeks of pre-operative high-
intensity interval training: the adjusted mean difference
(95%CI) being 0.3 (�0.4 to 1.1) ml.kg�1.min�1. How-
ever, there was evidence of interindividual heterogene-
ity, with one-third of the exercise participants possibly
to very likely being positive responders, defined as an
improvement of > 1.5 ml.kg�1.min�1. The
authors
suggested that their exercise safety criteria limited the
progression of training, which, in turn, probably lim-
ited adaptations in cardiorespiratory fitness.
Health-related quality of life
Only two pilot trials reported data on health-related
quality of life. The data of Tew et al. [35] suggest a

Main conclusions and
limitations
Tew et al. [35]
There were no in-hospital or 30-day
deaths in either group. One PET group
participant died 12 weeks after hospital
discharge. Mean total POMS count up
to hospital discharge was 2.3 with PET
and 2.1 in control (MD (95%CI) 0.2
(�0.3 to 0.7)). There was no substantial
group 9 postoperative day interaction.
Median [IQR] LOS was 7 [4.5–8.5] vs. 6
[4–8] days for PET and control groups,
respectively
For PET vs. control at pre-surgery:
AT = 11.7 vs. 11.4 ml.kg�1.min�1
(MD (95%CI) 0.3 ml.kg�1.min�1 (�0.4 to 1.1))
_
VO2peak = 16.8 vs. 16.3 ml.kg�1.min�1
(MD (95%CI) 0.5 ml.kg�1.min�1 (�0.6 to 1.7))
EQ-5D utility score = 0.864 vs. 0.796 (MD (95%CI) 0.068 (0.002–0.135))
For PET vs. control at 12 weeks post-discharge:
EQ-5D utility score = 0.837 vs. 0.760 (MD (95%CI) 0.077 (0.005–0.148))
SF-36 physical function = 49.4 vs. 46.5 (MD (95%CI) 2.9 (0.4–5.4))
‘the findings support the
feasibility and acceptability of

definitive trial is warranted.’

 small beneficial effect of pre-operative high-intensity
interval training on general health status and physical
functioning, but not mental health (Table 2). For exam-
ple, the mean EQ-5D utility index value before surgery
was 0.864 in the exercise group and 0.796 in the control
group, the mean difference (95%CI) being 0.068 (0.002–
0.135); this difference appeared to be maintained at
12 weeks post-discharge (0.837 vs. 0.760; mean differ-
ence (95%CI) 0.077 (0.005–0.148)). In the study by
Hornsby et al. [40], the effects of a 12-week aerobic
exercise training programme were assessed in 20
patients receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for breast
cancer. Quality of life was assessed using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast and Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General instruments,
and there was no significant differences between groups
on either measure (p = 0.685 and p = 0.431, respec-
tively).
Peri-operative clinical outcomes
Small sample sizes and low event rates prevent conclu-
sions being drawn about the effects of pre-operative
exercise training on short-term (e.g. 30-day) peri-
operative mortality. For example, the two systematic
reviews that included postoperative mortality as an
outcome both stated that no postoperative deaths
occurred in any study [2, 4]. Across the four additional
trials we included (485 patients in total), there were
five 30-day deaths in each study group.
More data are available on peri-operative complica-
tions, but the results appear inconsistent and potentially
dependent on the type of surgical population and com-
plication being studied (Table 2). Across all surgical
populations, no study has reported that pre-operative
exercise training increases postoperative complications.
In people undergoing lung resection for non-small cell
lung cancer, there is evidence that pre-operative exercise
training can reduce postoperative pulmonary complica-
tions (e.g. pneumonia, severe atelectasis). For example, a
meta-analysis of four studies (158 patients) demon-
strated a relative risk reduction of 67% (risk ratio (95%
CI) 0.33 (0.17–0.61)) [2]; however, the evidence was
graded as low quality due to high risk of bias and small
sample sizes in the included studies. The meta-analysis
result is supported by a recent trial of 164 patients [33],
which showed a lower incidence of postoperative
pulmonary complications in the group allocated to
interval training-based prehabilitation vs. usual care
(23% vs. 44%; p = 0.018). In patients undergoing major
intra-abdominal surgery (e.g. bowel resection, radical
cystectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair), the
impact of pre-operative exercise training on peri-opera-
tive complications is less clear, with interpretation
clouded by lack of standardisation in outcome measures.
In the systematic review by Hijazi et al. [3], three trials
that included a variety of abdominal surgical popula-
tions recorded complications using the Clavien–Dindo
classification, with none of them reporting significant
between-group differences [36, 37, 41]. A recent trial of
144 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery also
reported no effect of pre-operative exercise training on
the
severity
of
complications
assessed
using
the
Clavien–Dindo classification [32]; however, the propor-
tion of patients with postoperative complications was
lower (31% vs. 62%; relative risk ratio (95%CI) 0.5 (0.3–
0.8)) when complications were defined as any deviation
from the normal postoperative course according to the
standards of the European Society of Anaesthesiology
and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [42].
Finally, out of the two trials that have included patients
undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
[34, 35], one showed a lower incidence of postoperative
cardiac, pulmonary and/or renal complications in the
exercise group vs. control (22.6% vs. 41.9%, RR = 0.54,
p = 0.021) [34], whereas the other showed no substan-
tial difference in mean total Postoperative Morbidity
Survey count up to the point of discharge from hospital
(2.3 vs. 2.1; difference (95%CI) 0.2 (�0.3 to 0.7)) [35].
Hospital length of stay
The effect of pre-operative exercise training on length
of hospital stay also appears to be inconsistent. In
the lung cancer literature, a meta-analysis of four
studies (158 patients) showed that length of hospital
stay was lower following prehabilitation vs. control
(mean
difference
(95%CI)
�4.24 days
(�5.43
to
�3.06)) [2]; however, this was not supported by the
trial by Licker et al. [33], which showed a median
[IQR] length of stay of 10 [8–2] days in the prehabil-
itation group vs. 9 [7–3] days in the control group
(p = 0.223). In a systematic review of pre-operative
exercise training before major intra-abdominal surgery

Tew et al. | Pre-operative exercise training before major non-cardiac surgery
Anaesthesia 2018
 [4], a meta-analysis of four studies (232 patients)
showed no significant difference in length of stay
between exercise and control groups (mean difference
(95%CI) �1.62 days (�7.57 to 4.33)), with the qual-
ity of evidence rated as ‘very low’. Other trial evi-
dence is mixed, with two studies showing some
evidence of reduced length of stay [32, 34], and one
showing no substantial difference [35].
Exercise-related adverse events
Data on exercise-related adverse events were presented
in one of the systematic reviews [5] and all four of
the additional trials [32–35]. The review of Loughney
et al. [5] cited the results of a study exploring the
safety and efficacy of aerobic exercise training in peo-
ple with operable breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant
chemotherapy [40]. This study reported that three
non-life threatening/non-ECG-related adverse events
occurred
during
baseline
exercise
testing,
which
resulted in prematurely stopping the tests due to exer-
cise-induced oxygen desaturation (SpO2 = 84%), anxi-
ety attack and dizziness. All symptoms/signs resolved
promptly upon cessation of exercise and did not pre-
clude study participation. One aerobic training-related
adverse event was observed, consisting of unexplained
leg pain that quickly resolved following exercise cessa-
tion. Three of the additional trials reported that no
adverse events occurred during pre-operative exercise
training [32–34]. The remaining trial reported one
exercise-related adverse event that resulted in the ter-
mination of an exercise session: a single episode of
short-lived angina that was relieved through self-
administration of glyceryl trinitrate [35].
Limitations and issues of the current evidence
base
In the current literature regarding pre-operative exer-
cise training in patients undergoing elective major
non-cardiac surgery, several issues were identified that
we recommend are addressed in future research.
First, there are a limited number of relevant ran-
domised controlled trials, many of which have small
sample sizes, and are from a single centre. There is a
need for multi-centre randomised controlled trials with
specifically-designed
pre-operative
exercise
training
programmes and a carefully selected patient population
to strengthen current evidence. Encouragingly, a search
of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
identified more than 30 ongoing trials in this area.
Second, there is heterogeneity of the included patient
populations. Patients scheduled for different surgical
procedures have different characteristics in terms of
pre-operative physical status and comorbidities, which
will likely influence the efficacy of pre-operative exer-
cise training. Group-level analyses in trials may mask
inter-individual differences in response. Research is
needed to identify which type of pre-operative exercise
training works best in different clinical scenarios. Only
then will peri-operative teams be able provide evi-
dence-based individualised programmes. Third, there
is a lack of standardisation of pre-operative exercise
programmes in terms of composition (physical/pul-
monary), duration and frequency. The aforementioned
inconsistent
effects
of
pre-operative
exercise
pro-
grammes may be partly due to heterogeneity in inter-
vention design. In particular, there has been variation
in the type of exercise used (e.g. high-intensity interval
training vs. moderate-intensity continuous training,
resistance training vs. aerobic training; inspiratory
muscle training vs. whole-body training), the duration
of exercise training, its frequency and timing. To some
extent, variation in programme design is expected, as
the specific goals of training may differ according to
the type of surgical procedure and patient characteris-
tics. Regardless, head-to-head trials of different pre-
operative exercise interventions would be beneficial to
identify optimal exercise prescriptions. Finally, there is
also a lack of standardisation of outcome measures.
Development of a core outcome set for prehabilitation
trials would facilitate comparisons between studies and
enhance evidence synthesis through maximum inclu-
sion of studies into meta-analyses.
Practical guidelines for pre-operative exercise
training
When prescribing any exercise training programme,
consideration should be given to the principles of
frequency, intensity, time, type, volume and progres-
sion [43]. Pre-operative exercise training is principally
aimed
at
increasing
physiological
and
functional
reserve
through
performing
structured,
purposeful
exercise training; however, a combination of regular
12

Tew et al. | Pre-operative exercise training before major non-cardiac surgery
 exercise training and general physical activity should
be encouraged for longer term fitness, health and well-
being. In most cases, it would be appropriate for a
pre-operative exercise programme to include a combi-
nation of aerobic training, resistance training and
inspiratory muscle training to promote positive adapta-
tions in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength
and
endurance
and
respiratory
muscle
function,
respectively. The frequency, intensity and duration of
each exercise component should be tailored to each
patient, taking into consideration their initial fitness
and health status. As mentioned, a minimum of
four weeks of exercise training is desirable for mean-
ingful improvements in fitness to be achievable.
Sessions should be individualised, supervised by
appropriately trained members of staff (at least ini-
tially) and include warm-up and cool-down sections
before and after the main conditioning phase, respec-
tively. If considering the promotion of self-managed
(unsupervised) exercise training, the following impor-
tant factors need careful consideration: mechanisms to
offer remote support; provision of home exercise
equipment; and patient selection.
The setting in which pre-operative exercise train-
ing is offered will depend on the available infrastruc-
ture and resources. Despite financial constraints within
the current National Health Service, a range of poten-
tial
settings
exists.
This
includes
cardiac
and
pulmonary rehabilitation facilities, hospital- or com-
munity-based physiotherapy clinics and community
wellbeing centres.
Simply prescribing ‘exercise’, in a generic sense, to a
patient is insufficient guidance and is unlikely to achieve
the desired outcomes. To help clinicians prescribe/de-
liver evidence-based exercise interventions, we provide
practical details for three pre-operative scenarios in
Fig. 3 (intra-abdominal surgery), Fig. 4 (thoracic sur-
gery) and Fig. 5 (neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and
surgery for cancer). Uncertainties in the prehabilitation
evidence base prevent presentation of a single interven-
tion for each scenario. Therefore, a typical intervention
or a range of practical options from various studies is
presented. The information about each intervention is
presented using key headings from the TIDieR (Tem-
plate for Intervention Description and Replication)
guide for intervention reporting [44].
Multi-modal prehabilitation and
rehabilitation
Simultaneously addressing multiple lifestyle behaviours
may yield greater rewards than solely focusing on exer-
cise, and given the propensity for unhealthy behaviours
(e.g. physical inactivity, smoking and excessive alcohol
consumption) to co-occur or cluster in the population
[29], a wider approach to prehabilitation appears
important. The optimal package of interventions is cur-
rently unknown, but a multi-modal prehabilitation pro-
gramme that addresses both behavioural (e.g. exercise,
nutrition, smoking) and clinical (e.g. anaemia, frailty)
peri-operative risk factors may harness the concept of
aggregating marginal gains already well established in
enhanced recovery initiatives. The ideal scenario may
be a blurring of the lines between prehabilitation and
enhanced recovery, such that one programme leads into
the next, punctuated by surgery, with minimal interrup-
tion. This idea is particularly appealing in the case of
exercise, where evidence suggests that early postopera-
tive exercise rehabilitation enhances the recovery of
functional status [57, 58]. There is some evidence that
the pre-operative period may represent a more appro-
priate time than the postoperative period to implement
an intervention [59]; however, further research is
needed to determine if a combination of prehabilitation
plus early rehabilitation is superior to prehabilitation
alone.
Barriers and facilitators of
implementation
Successful
implementation
of
prehabilitation
pro-
grammes may prove challenging. A range of institution-
alised cultural and attitudinal barriers exist that could
affect
pre-operative
initiatives
to
varying
degrees.
Patient-related factors include motivation, time and
financial worries, and limiting comorbidities. System-
related barriers include lack of educational opportunities
highlighting the benefits of exercise, insufficient infras-
tructure, and concerns about the feasibility of delivery
and cost effectiveness of potential programmes. Paton
et al. [60] reviewed 14 case studies utilising enhanced
recovery programmes, identifying inherent differences
in programme elements between surgical specialities
and difficulty of incorporating certain components into
established pathways. Several barriers to implementation

 were discussed, the main ones being resistance to change
from patients and staff and lack of funding or support
from management. Based on evidence drawn from
enhanced recovery initiatives [60], the development and
implementation of successful and sustainable prehabili-
tation programmes may rely on several factors: effective
leadership (including a dedicated project lead to co-or-
dinate and sustain multidisciplinary team working);
continuity of the pathway; ongoing educational initia-
tives for staff, patients and patient representatives; col-
laborative
decision
making
between
primary
and
secondary care with agreement of objectives and goals
to allow focused local planning and action, and the
availability of dedicated resources.
