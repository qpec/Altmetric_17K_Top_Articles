The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms
(MDROs) across global healthcare networks poses a serious threat
to hospitalized individuals. Strategies to limit the emergence and
spread of MDROs include oversight to decrease selective pressure
for MDROs by promoting appropriate antibiotic use via antibiotic
stewardship programs. However, restricting the use of one antibi-
otic often requires a compensatory increase in the use of other
antibiotics, which in turn selects for the emergence of different
MDRO species. Further, the downstream effects of antibiotic treat-
ment decisions may also be influenced by functional interactions
among different MDRO species, with the potential clinical implica-
tions of such interactions remaining largely unexplored. Here, we
attempt to decipher the influence network between antibiotic
treatment, MDRO colonization, and infection by leveraging active
surveillance and antibiotic treatment data for 234 nursing home
residents. Our analysis revealed a complex network of interactions:
antibiotic use was a risk factor for primary MDRO colonization,
which in turn increased the likelihood of colonization and infec-
tion by other MDROs. When we focused on the risk of catheter-
associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) caused by Escherichia coli,
Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus we observed that cocolo-
nization with specific pairs of MDROs increased the risk of CAUTI,
signifying the involvement of microbial interactions in CAUTI path-
ogenesis. In summary, our work demonstrates the existence of an
underappreciated healthcare-associated ecosystem and strongly
suggests that effective control of overall MDRO burden will require
stewardship interventions that take into account both primary and
secondary impacts of antibiotic treatments.

T
he successful treatment of bacterial infections has been sig-
nificantly undermined by the emergence and spread of
multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (1). Antibiotic-resistant
healthcare-acquired infections are of particular concern, as
MDROs complicate treatment of infections, hinder effective
treatment of comorbid conditions, and increase risk of morbidity
and mortality (2–5). While the threats of MDROs in acute-care
hospitals are well known, MDROs are not limited to those settings.
In particular, residents in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) often
have underlying medical conditions that make them particularly
vulnerable to infections. Moreover, the high rates of MDRO col-
onization (6) and antibiotic use (7–9) among LTCF residents
further put this population at risk for contracting infections. Fur-
thermore, the frequent transfers between LTCFs and other health-
care facilities leads to the dissemination of MDROs throughout
the healthcare network, creating a substantial economic and
clinical burden that permeates healthcare systems (10, 11).
Given the central role of antibiotic use in both the emergence
and proliferation of MDROs (12), antibiotic stewardship programs
that enforce more judicious use of antibiotics have become a
cornerstone of modern infection prevention (13–15). In addition to
efforts to reduce total antibiotic consumption, stewardship pro-
grams also emphasize reductions in the use of specific antibiotics
based on studies linking these antibiotics to increased rates of
transmission and infection with high-priority MDROs (16–19).
However, the studies used to inform stewardship decisions gener-
ally evaluate the risk of antibiotic resistance associated with single-
bacterial species. This single-species view of MDRO epidemiology
does not reflect the complex reality; most healthcare facilities
have multiple circulating MDRO species (20, 21), and indi-
viduals are often colonized by more than one MDRO (22–24).
Thus, interventions based on a single-species perspective can re-
sult in unintended consequences. For example, in one study, re-
ducing cephalosporin use successfully decreased prevalence of
cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella (25), but—because carbapenems
were used instead of cephalosporin—resulted in increased imipenem
resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25). This example illus-
trates the inherent interdependencies between antibiotic use and
MDROs and emphasizes that an optimal stewardship program
must take into account circulating MDRO populations and the
network of antibiotic-mediated interactions among them.
Here, we take an ecologic approach and describe how inter-
actions among antibiotics and different MDRO species influence
the dynamics of MDRO colonization and infection in LTCFs. To
Significance
The proliferation of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is
one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. Despite
great efforts to prevent MDRO spread in healthcare facilities,
antibiotic-resistant infections remain a significant threat. We
hypothesized that current infection prevention initiatives are
hindered by their targeting of individual MDROs; neglecting the
fact that healthcare institutions have multiple circulating MDRO
species whose propagation is driven by competing risk factors.
We tested this hypothesis by identifying risk factors for the
spread of multiple MDROs among nursing home residents and
unraveled a complex network of interactions between antibiotic
exposure and microbial factors. Our results indicate that inter-
actions among MDROs and underlying drivers must be consid-
ered simultaneously to design optimal strategies to reduce
MDRO propagation.

 accomplish this, we leveraged longitudinal surveillance data
and diagnostic records collected in the Targeted Infection
Prevention study during 2010 and 2013 (26, 27). Briefly, the
prevalence of MDROs in the groin and perirectum and asso-
ciated metadata for 234 nursing home (NH) residents who were
catheterized >72 h were included in this study. Our analysis
revealed a complex network of associations between MDROs
and antibiotics that drives colonization and infection. In-
triguingly, in many cases, a primary event such as antibiotic
administration or MDRO colonization increased risk of new
MDRO acquisition or clinical infection. Our work strongly
argues for a shift from the current single-species stewardship
paradigm toward the design of interventions that account for
the downstream impacts of treatment decisions mediated by the
ecology of MDROs in healthcare facilities.
Results
NH Residents Are Heavily Colonized with Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.
The characteristics of the study population have been published
elsewhere (26, 27). Briefly, 122 (52%) males and 112 (48%) fe-
males were followed at baseline, day 15, and monthly for up to a
year. Excluding participants that only had one visit, follow-up days
ranged from 12 to 379 d, with a median of 57 d. The mean age was
73.9 ± 12.8 y, with an average physical self-maintenance score of
21.8 ± 3.9 and Charlson’s comorbidity score of 2.8 ± 1.9. MDROs
most commonly colonizing the groin and perirectal area were
VRE (n = 71; 30.3%); MRSA (n = 70; 29.9%); and resistant
Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli (n = 71; 30.3%),
Proteus mirabilis (n = 62; 26.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 28;
12.0%), and P. aeruginosa (n = 23; 9.8%) (Fig. 1). The distribution
of various MDROs across facilities is shown in SI Appendix, Fig.
S1. Only considering these species, 55 (23.5%) residents were
colonized with one species, 49 (20.9%) were colonized with two
species, and 46 (20%) were colonized with more than two species
during their stay. Over the course of the study, 146 residents (62%)
received at least one course of treatment with one of 50 different
antibiotics (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2a). The high cocoloni-
zation and antibiotic use rates observed in these NHs prompted
us to ask how antibiotic use and preexisting MDRO colonization
influence risk for subsequent acquisition of new MDROs.
Existing Bacterial Colonization Increases the Risk of Secondary
Acquisition. To discern if functional interactions were likely to be
mediating MDRO spread, we first tested whether the observed
high frequency of multi-MDRO colonization is due to the chance
accumulation of MDROs in susceptible individuals, or if particular
sets of MDROs preferentially cocolonized individuals. Applying
a permutation analysis that controls for the observed burden of
multi-MDRO colonization (28), we observed that colonization
patterns are highly nonrandom, with pairs of MDROs having
varying degrees of positive and negative association with each
other (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). To more effectively leverage our
longitudinal sampling, we next considered colonization as a time-
varying variable and tested whether preexisting MDRO coloni-
zation predicted new colonization with a different MDRO species
(29). In particular, we constructed models that only considered

 colonization with other MDROs and assessed the hazard ratio
(HR) of acquiring a secondary organism in the presence of another
organism. In this analysis, P. mirabilis showed high connectivity,
where preexisting P. mirabilis colonization increased the risk of
acquiring A. baumannii, MRSA, and VRE (unadjusted HR >
2 and P < 0.05 in all cases), and preexisting colonization with
A. baumannii, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa increased the risk of ac-
quiring P. mirabilis (HR > 2 and P < 0.05 in all cases) (SI Appendix,
Table S3). Note that observed associations were not always bi-
directional, as exemplified by E. coli predicting MRSA acquisition,
but MRSA not being associated with E. coli acquisition (un-
adjusted HR = 2.06 and 0.37; P = 0.03 and 0.33, respectively) (SI
Appendix, Table S3). Together, these results indicate that cocolo-
nization is not simply a stochastic process, but is shaped by un-
derlying microbial and host factors.
Many-to-Many Relationships Between Antibiotic Exposure and MDRO
Colonization. We next explored associations between antibiotic use
and risk of subsequent MDRO acquisition (30, 31). We grouped the
50 different antibiotics used during the study into 18 classes; resi-
dents were most often exposed to cephalosporins, quinolones, pen-
icillin combinations, and glycopeptides (SI Appendix, Table S2a).
The spectrum of activity of each class is provided in SI Appendix,
Table S2b. As different antibiotics have different modes of action
and target specificity, we investigated whether individual antibiotic
classes were associated with the acquisition of specific MDRO
species. We treated antibiotic exposure as a time-varying variable,
adding 30 d after the end of antibiotic administration to account
for prolonged disruption of microbiome-mediated colonization
resistance. We observed that multiple antibiotics could be asso-
ciated with acquisition of a single MDRO; for example, amino-
glycosides, cephalosporins, and glycopeptides exposures were all
associated with VRE acquisition. Conversely, a single antibiotic
could be associated with acquiring multiple MDRO species;
for example, aminoglycosides increased risk of acquiring VRE,
A. baumannii, E. coli, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa (unadjusted
HR > 2 and P < 0.05 in all cases) (SI Appendix, Table S4). These
observations highlight the many-to-many relationship between
antibiotics and MDROs, offering a perspective that could be
overlooked in data analyzed with a focus on single MDRO species
or individual antibiotics.
Microbial and Antibiotic Factors Jointly Influence Bacterial Colonization.
Having shown that the acquisition of MDRO species is influ-
enced by microbial and antibiotic factors, we next fit multivariate
Cox regression models to estimate individual and joint effects.
We included in the models all microbial and antibiotic factors
with at least modestly significant associations (P < 0.1) and
strongly associated resident characteristics (HR of >2 and P
value <0.05, namely, sex) and accounted for clustering of mea-
sures by resident and facility. Using associations that were sta-
tistically significant in the multivariate Cox regression model

whereas bacterial colonization could either be the risk factor for subsequent colonization, or a result of antibiotic exposure and/or previous coloni-
zation. The magnitude of the hazard ratio is reflected in edge thickness and shown in numbers. All associations shown are statistically significant with
P < 0.05.

 (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Table S5), we constructed a
network model demonstrating how risk of acquiring each MDRO
was influenced by a distinct set of microbial and antibiotic factors.
Strikingly, except for MRSA, all MDRO colonization was found
to be positively associated with at least one other MDRO and one
antibiotic. Most MDROs emerged in response to a single antibi-
otic class, such as VRE to glycopeptides, E. coli to penicillin,
P. mirabilis to nitrofurans, and P. aeruginosa to carbapenems.
While several MDROs were associated with the acquisition of
other MDROs, P. mirabilis appeared to be the “hub” species,
given its central role in connecting many MDRO species. This
network of interactions suggests that antibiotic exposure increased
the risk of acquiring MDROs, which in turn altered the risk of
colonization with an additional MDRO.
Cocolonization Is Associated with Increased Risk of Having Specific
Species in CAUTI Urine Culture. Colonization is a first step toward
infection; therefore we wondered whether microbial interactions
in colonized residents influence clinical trajectories. One of the
most common hospital-acquired infections is urinary tract in-
fection, especially among those with an indwelling catheter (32).
For this analysis, we included the 234 residents with an in-
dwelling urinary catheter for longer than 72 h. In total, 70 resi-
dents had a clinically diagnosed catheter-associated urinary tract
infection (CAUTI) during the course of the study (26). Exclud-
ing CAUTIs that were present before enrollment, P. mirabilis
(n = 38), Enterococcus spp. (n = 22), E. coli (n = 20), and
Staphylococcus spp. (n = 13) were the most commonly isolated
bacteria in their urine. The distribution of species-specific CAUTI
across facilities is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. After adjust-
ment for functional status and sex, risk of CAUTI was not
associated with preexisting groin or perirectum monocoloniza-
tion by the species detected in the urine (SI Appendix, Table S6).
However, for CAUTI associated with Enterococcus, E. coli, and
MRSA, we observed that the presence of a specific cocolonizing
species in the groin or perirectum increased the risk of infection.
In particular, the cooccurrence of VRE and E. coli increased risk
of Enterococcus in urine, and the cooccurrence of E. coli or
MRSA with P. mirabilis increased the risk of E. coli or MRSA in
the urine, respectively (HR > 2, P < 0.1 in all cases; Fig. 3). This
bacterial network shows that the effects of antibiotic exposure
contribute to colonization as well as disease, potentially medi-
ated by synergistic interactions between colonizing MDROs.
Discussion
Antibiotic use invariably selects for antibiotic resistance. Our task
is to preserve the effectiveness of existing antibiotics by minimizing
the emergence and spread of MDROs to maximize the time until
existing antibiotics become ineffective. As we show using longi-
tudinal data from nursing homes, this task is complicated by the
interdependencies among MDROs and antibiotics. We uncovered
a complex set of relationships, where colonization and infection
with different MDRO species were associated with distinct sets of
microbial and antibiotic risk factors. This work demonstrates the
importance of designing strategies that account for the complex
set of interdependencies among different MDROs and the anti-
biotics that influence their spread.
Among the MDRO species included in our study, P. mirabilis was
located most centrally. P. mirabilis increased risk of acquiring other
MDROs, and risk of acquiring P. mirabilis was influenced by the
presence of other colonizing MDROs. P. mirabilis is known for its
propensity to produce both monospecies and polymicrobial bio-
films, commonly with urease-producing species (33, 34). Although
MRSA is the only species in our culture collection that has been
characterized as a urease producer (35), a recent study showed that
P. mirabilis urease production is enhanced in the presence of urease
nonproducers, including Enterococcus, A. baumannii, and E. coli
(36). Thus, communication among MDROs, whether dependent on
chemical signaling or physical contact, may underlie the associa-
tions among these organisms.
The colonization of bacterial pairs, including E. coli/Enterococcus,
P. mirabilis/E. coli, and P. mirabilis/MRSA, synergistically increased

another MDRO colonization (**P < 0.05), or the risk of having a species-specific CAUTI when colonized by an MDRO (*P < 0.1). Red numbers indicate the
hazard ratio of having a species-specific CAUTI in cocolonized residents; the hazard ratio of having such outcome in residents colonized by only one MDRO is
not significant.

 risk of developing a CAUTI. In animal and in vitro systems, E. coli
and Enterococcus together alter biofilm formation and modulate the
metabolic milieu, potentially promoting polymicrobial infections
(37). Similarly, P. mirabilis and E. coli promote one another’s growth
by using complementary metabolic pathways, with coinfection pro-
moting the colonization and persistence of both species (38). These
interspecies interactions are consistent with our observation that
P. mirabilis/E. coli cocolonization increased the risk of subsequent
movement into the urine and suggests enhanced pathogenic poten-
tial when both species were present. Lastly, Proteus species and
Staphylococcus aureus increase each other’s virulence in mouse and
Caenorhabditis elegans models, although the molecular mechanism
remains to be investigated (39–41). It is also noteworthy that while P.
mirabilis increased risk of CAUTI with other organisms, no colo-
nizing partners were identified as specifically increasing the risk of
P. mirabilis CAUTI. We hypothesize that the lack of observed as-
sociation may be a consequence of Proteus’ diverse interaction
partners precluding the detection of specific interactions with our
small number of CAUTI cases (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Together,
these observations suggest that interspecies interactions may en-
hance microbial pathogenic potential. That we found supporting
evidence from model systems for each of our associations validates
our approach of using surveillance data analysis to identify clinically
significant polymicrobial interactions. These interactions can then be
studied mechanistically using model systems.
A limitation in our study is that only high-priority MDROs were
collected; thus we cannot know the role of other members of host
microbial communities in mediating risk of acquisition and in-
fection with MDROs. Future studies should collect both resistant
and susceptible pathogens and, potentially, specimens for micro-
biome analysis to provide a complete picture of the microbial
ecology at both intra- and interresident levels (42–46). Despite this
limitation, our study represents an important proof-of-concept for
the application of surveillance data and standard epidemiological
tools to dissect how host, microbial, and treatment factors influ-
ence colonization and infection with MDROs. The success of our
approach, as indicated by the concordance of our findings with
prior epidemiologic and experimental studies, supports its po-
tential role in studying the ecology of MDROs in a variety of
healthcare settings. The complex network of interactions among
MDROs and antibiotic treatments found in the current pop-
ulation indicates that additional studies are necessary to better
inform the design and evaluation of stewardship interventions
aimed at preventing emergence and spread of MDROs.
Methods
Study Population and Design. We performed a post hoc analysis of
data collected through the Targeted Infection Prevention (TIP)
study. Written informed consent to collect microbiological and
resident-level data was obtained from each resident or his or her
durable power of attorney, and the study was approved by the
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. The TIP
study, a cluster-randomized intervention trial aiming to reduce
the prevalence of drug-resistant organisms in nursing homes, was
conducted in Michigan between May 2010 and April 2013 (27).
Details of the trial design and outcomes have been reported
previously (27, 47–49). In short, 12 community-based nursing
homes (NHs) were randomly assigned as control or intervention
sites, with 215 and 203 enrolled residents, respectively. Longi-
tudinal data regarding indwelling device use, functional status,
comorbidities, urine culture results, and antibiotic administration
were collected from each resident at the time of enrollment up to
1 y, until discharge, device removal, or death. Microbiological
samples were collected from multiple body sites to assess
antibiotic-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization at baseline,
day 15, and monthly for up to a year. The body sites included
the nares, oropharynx, enteral feeding tube insertion site,
suprapubic catheter site, groin, perirectal area, and wounds.
Standard microbiological methods were used to isolate and identify
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Gram-negative bacteria re-
sistant to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime.
For the present study, we limited our population to 234 residents
who had urinary catheter for longer than 72 h, as catheterized
residents are known to experience different clinical trajectories
from noncatheterized residents (50). We included in our analysis
only MDROs colonizing the groin and perirectum. The analysis of
catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) risk included
only residents who had full baseline demographic and CAUTI
symptom information (n = 234) (26).
Data Organization. Based on the positive correlation found between
rectal colonization and infecting strains present in CAUTI (51, 52),
we specifically considered MDROs colonizing two body sites, the
groin and perirectal region, in the analysis. We further defined our
bacteria of interest to those that were detected microbiologically in
more than 20 residents across visits during the study to focus on the
more prevalent colonizers, namely, VRE, MRSA, Acinetobacter
baumannii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. As samples were collected monthly, the exact time
when bacterial colonization started and/or ended was unknown.
Therefore, when a positive culture was identified, we arbitrarily
assigned each day until the next visit as colonized. Colonization
status was treated as a time-dependent variable and was coded
dichotomously, 1 if detected, and 0 if undetected, on a day-to-day
basis (example scenarios provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S3). An-
tibiotics were categorized into classes (SI Appendix, Table S1).
Antibiotic exposure has long-lasting impact on the intestinal
microbiota, such as community structure and development of
MDROs, for years (53, 54). To assess the prolonged effects of
antibiotics on the acquisition of MDROs, we extended antibiotic
exposure by 30 d past the end of antibiotic administration (ex-
ample scenarios provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization. All analyses were con-
ducted using RStudio R version 3.3.2 (55). We used Cox propor-
tional hazard models to test for the effects of (i) presence of
an earlier bacterial colonizer on acquiring secondary colonization;
(ii) antibiotic exposure on MDRO colonization; and, (iii) bacterial
colonization on CAUTI urine culture results (MRSA, Enterococcus,
E. coli, and P. mirabilis). The “coxph” function from the “survival”
package in R was used to perform the analysis (56). Without
adjusting for covariates, our preliminary results indicated that both
primary colonization and antibiotic exposure increased the risk of
acquiring specific MDROs. Subsequently we entered all variables
significantly associated (P < 0.1) with secondary colonization into a
single multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity
score, functional status, intervention, and clustering by resident and
facilities. Here we used the “coxme” function (57). Resident-level
characteristics, namely, age, comorbidity score, functional status,
and intervention that did not have a significant HR (P < 0.05) were
removed from the model. The final model for colonization was
adjusted for sex, and the CAUTI model was adjusted for functional
status and sex. Statistically significant variables (P < 0.05) associ-
ated with each outcome were then organized into a matrix for di-
rected network visualization using the “igraph” package in R (58).
