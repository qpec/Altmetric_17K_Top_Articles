BACKGROUND
Acute left ventricular dysfunction is a major complication of cardiac surgery and is 
associated with increased mortality. Meta-analyses of small trials suggest that levo-
simendan may result in a higher rate of survival among patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery.
METHODS
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in-
volving patients in whom perioperative hemodynamic support was indicated after 
cardiac surgery, according to prespecified criteria. Patients were randomly assigned 
to receive levosimendan (in a continuous infusion at a dose of 0.025 to 0.2 μg per 
kilogram of body weight per minute) or placebo, for up to 48 hours or until discharge 
from the intensive care unit (ICU), in addition to standard care. The primary outcome 
was 30-day mortality.
RESULTS
The trial was stopped for futility after 506 patients were enrolled. A total of 248 pa-
tients were assigned to receive levosimendan and 258 to receive placebo. There was no 
significant difference in 30-day mortality between the levosimendan group and 
the placebo group (32 patients [12.9%] and 33 patients [12.8%], respectively; abso-
lute risk difference, 0.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −5.7 to 5.9; 
P 
= 
0.97). There were no significant differences between the levosimendan group 
and the placebo group in the durations of mechanical ventilation (median, 19 hours 
and 21 hours, respectively; median difference, −2 hours; 95% CI, −5 to 1; P 
= 
0.48), 
ICU stay (median, 72 hours and 84 hours, respectively; median difference, −12 hours; 
95% CI, −21 to 2; P 
= 
0.09), and hospital stay (median, 14 days and 14 days, respec-
tively; median difference, 0 days; 95% CI, −1 to 2; P 
= 
0.39). There was no significant 
difference between the levosimendan group and the placebo group in rates of hypo-
tension or cardiac arrhythmias.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients who required perioperative hemodynamic support after cardiac surgery, 
low-dose levosimendan in addition to standard care did not result in lower 30-day 
mortality than placebo. (Funded by the Italian Ministry of Health; CHEETAH

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
E
very year, more than 1 million pa-
tients undergo cardiac surgery in the United 
States and Europe.1 Acute perioperative left 
ventricular dysfunction is a major complication af-
fecting up to 20% of such patients2,3 and is associ-
ated with increased mortality.4 Inotropic drugs 
(catecholamines and phosphodiesterase type 3 
[PDE-3] inhibitors) are the cornerstone of post-
operative hemodynamic support.3,5 However, no 
randomized, controlled trials have shown the su-
periority of any inotropic agent in terms of major 
clinical outcomes. Furthermore, meta-analyses and 
observational studies suggest that catecholamines 
and PDE-3 inhibitors may increase mortality.6,7
Levosimendan (Simdax, Orion) is an inotropic 
agent that has been shown to be associated with 
a higher rate of survival than other inotropic agents 
in meta-analyses,8 especially those involving pa-
tients undergoing cardiac surgery.9-11 A network 
meta-analysis ranked levosimendan as the most 
likely inotrope to reduce mortality among patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery.12 Treatment with levo-
simendan results in greater cardiac output than 
does treatment with catecholamines or PDE-3 in-
hibitors, with minimal effect on myocardial oxy-
gen consumption.13,14 Moreover, it has antioxidant, 
antiinflammatory, and direct cardioprotective ef-
fects.13 Accordingly, it is widely used in several 
countries.
Considering the pharmacologic properties of 
levosimendan and the results of previous studies, 
we hypothesized that the administration of levo-
simendan, in addition to standard treatment, 
might result in lower mortality in this context. 
Accordingly, we designed the Levosimendan to 
Reduce Mortality in High Risk Cardiac Surgery 
Patients: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled 
Trial (CHEETAH) to test the hypothesis that levo-
simendan treatment in addition to standard ino-
tropic treatment would result in lower mortality 
than placebo among patients with perioperative 
cardiovascular dysfunction after cardiac surgery.
Methods
Trial Design
We performed this randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled trial at 14 centers in Italy, Russia, 
and Brazil. The trial protocol (available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org) was approved 
by the ethics committee at all the participating 
centers. Details of the trial methods and statisti-
cal analysis plan have been published previously.15
The trial was funded by the Italian Ministry 
of Health and received a start-up grant from the 
European Association of Cardiothoracic Anesthe-
siologists. Levosimendan was provided free of 
charge by the manufacturer (Orion) to centers that 
recruited patients in Italy; all the centers in Russia 
and Brazil purchased the drug at full cost. The 
funders and Orion had no role in the trial design, 
the data collection and analysis, the writing of the 
manuscript, or the decision to submit the manu-
script for publication. All the authors vouch for 
the completeness and accuracy of the data and all 
analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol.
Enrollment Procedure, Criteria,  
and Randomization
All the patients who were scheduled for cardiac 
surgery at the trial centers provided preoperative 
written informed consent. Patients then underwent 
randomization if they met the enrollment criteria 
either in the operating room or in the intensive 
care unit (ICU). Patients were included if they had 
perioperative cardiovascular dysfunction, which 
was defined as the presence of at least one of the 
following criteria: a preoperative left ventricular 
ejection fraction of less than 25%, preoperative 
support with an intraaortic balloon pump, or the 
need for support with an intraaortic balloon pump 
or high-dose inotropic support (defined as a va-
soactive–inotropic score of ≥10 as described in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) 
in order to be weaned from cardiopulmonary by-
pass or at any time within the first 24 hours after 
surgery.
Exclusion criteria were a previous adverse re-
sponse to levosimendan, inclusion in another 
randomized trial, receipt of levosimendan in the 
previous 30 days, receipt of a kidney or liver trans-
plant, liver cirrhosis, a decision to use extracorpo-
real membrane oxygenation, or the presence of a 
do-not-resuscitate order. Patients undergoing an 
emergency operation were also excluded because 
it would have been difficult to obtain informed 
consent.
Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 
1:1 ratio, to receive either levosimendan or placebo. 
Randomization was performed with the use of a 
computer-generated, permuted block sequence

stratified according to trial center. Trial-group 
assignments were concealed in sealed, opaque, 
sequentially numbered envelopes. Physicians, in-
vestigators, data collectors, and outcome assessors 
were unaware of the trial-group assignments.
Clinical Regimen
Patients were assigned to receive a blinded infu-
sion of either levosimendan or placebo as prepared 
by dedicated trial personnel. Levosimendan was 
diluted as 12.5 mg in 100 ml of 5% glucose. A 
mixed-vitamins solution with a yellow color, 
devoid of relevant cardiovascular effects and in-
distinguishable in appearance from levosimendan, 
was used as placebo (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Levosimendan or placebo was initiated as a 
continuous infusion at a dose of 0.05 μg per kilo-
gram of body weight per minute. The dose could 
then be increased or decreased at the discretion 
of the attending physician; the minimum dose was 
0.025 μg per kilogram per minute, and the maxi-
mum dose 0.2 μg per kilogram per minute. The 
infusion could be continued for up to 48 hours 
(to allow for prolonged support in the most com-
promised patients) or until ICU discharge. In this 
pragmatic trial,16 all clinical decisions, with the 
exception of the administration of the trial regi-
men, were left to the discretion of the attending 
physicians, including hemodynamic monitoring 
and management. However, an advisory flowchart 
for open-label inotrope management was provided 
to investigators (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Data Collection and Follow-up
We collected preoperative data on baseline char-
acteristics and coexisting conditions, intraopera-
tive and postoperative treatment data, postopera-
tive laboratory values, duration of mechanical 
ventilation, durations of ICU and hospital stays, 
and major outcomes. Baseline hemodynamic data 
were collected at randomization (most patients 
were already receiving hemodynamic support with 
high-dose inotropic agents, an intraaortic balloon 
pump, or both). We also collected data on the in-
cidence of hypotension, arrhythmias, and other 
adverse events during the administration of the 
infusion, as well as information on protocol 
deviations. Telephone follow-up was performed 
at 30 days and 180 days after randomization by 
an investigator who was unaware of the trial-
group assignments.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of the trial was 30-day 
mortality. Prespecified secondary outcomes were 
the following: acute kidney injury,17 a need for 
renal-replacement therapy, a composite outcome 
of death and need for renal-replacement therapy, 
duration of mechanical ventilation, and durations 
of stay in the ICU and hospital.15 We also collected 
data on the following outcomes: need for advanced 
mechanical circulatory support, myocardial infarc-
tion, type 1 or type 2 neurologic damage,18 need 
for tracheostomy, sepsis, pneumonia, and medi-
astinitis. Definitions of the outcome measures are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Cause 
of death in the ICU and hospital was recorded with 
the use of previously validated criteria (see the 
Supplementary Appendix).19
Statistical Analysis
The sample-size calculation was based on a two-
sided alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power. On the 
basis of meta-analyses that estimated that mor-
tality would be reduced from 12.7% to 4.7% with 
levosimendan use,9,10 we expected 10% mortality 
in the placebo group and 5% mortality in the 
levosimendan group. Accordingly, we calculated 
that a sample of 435 patients per group was need-
ed. In order to account for protocol deviations and 
withdrawal of consent, we planned for 500 pa-
tients per group to undergo randomization.
Interim analyses were planned after enrollments 
of 25% and 50% of the sample size.20,21 The first 
review by the data and safety monitoring board 
(at 25% enrollment) led to a decision to decrease 
the sample from 1000 to 500 patients, because a 
higher-than-expected overall mortality rate of 
13.5% and a lower-than-expected withdrawal rate 
of 0% were observed. The second review by the 
data and safety monitoring board (at 50% of the 
originally planned enrollment) led to the deci-
sion to stop the trial on the grounds of futility 
(see the Supplementary Appendix).
Details of the statistical analysis plan have 
been published previously.15 Primary analyses com-
paring levosimendan with placebo were performed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle. No 
imputation for missing data was applied. Per-pro-
tocol and as-treated analyses were also performed.

Data are presented as medians and interquar-
tile ranges for nonnormally distributed variables 
and as means and standard deviations for nor-
mally distributed variables. Dichotomous data (in-
cluding the primary outcome) were compared by 
two-tailed chi-square tests with the Yates correc-
tion or by Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
primary analysis was not adjusted for covariates. 
Continuous measurements were compared with 
the use of the Mann–Whitney U test. A logistic-
regression model with stepwise selection was used 
to identify predictors of death (see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Prespecified subgroup analyses 
were performed as described in the Supplementary 
Appendix. In all the subgroup analyses, hetero-
geneity was estimated by the chi-square test for 
heterogeneity and the I2 statistic.
All reported P values are two-sided. Data were 
stored electronically and analyzed with the use of 
Stata software, version 13 (StataCorp).
Results
Trial Population and Baseline Characteristics
From November 2009 through April 2016, we ob-
tained written informed consent from 4725 pa-
tients. Of these, 506 patients underwent random-
ization, with 248 patients being randomly assigned 
to receive levosimendan and 258 to receive placebo 
(Fig. 1). Most patients underwent randomization in 
the operating room because high doses of ino-
tropes were indicated for weaning from cardio-
pulmonary bypass (61 patients [12.1%]) or in the 
ICU because of postoperative acute cardiovascu-
lar dysfunction (329 [65.0%]). Only a minority of 
patients underwent randomization preoperatively 
because of low ejection fraction (22 patients [4.3%]). 
The remaining 94 patients (18.6%) underwent ran-
domization because they received support with an 
intraaortic balloon pump. The timing of the ran-
domization of patients who underwent random-
ization in the ICU is shown in Figure S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. The baseline and intra-
operative characteristics of the patients were simi-
lar in the levosimendan group and in the placebo 
group (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Infusion of Levosimendan or Placebo
The mean (±SD) duration of the infusion was 
33±14.6 hours in the levosimendan group and 
32±13.5 hours in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.17). The 
mean dose was 0.066±0.031 μg per kilogram per 
minute in the levosimendan group, with a volume 
equivalent to a dose of 0.075±0.033 μg per kilo-
gram per minute administered in the placebo 
group (P 
= 
0.002). An increase from the initial 
dose of 0.05 μg per kilogram per minute was 
performed in 127 patients (51.2%) in the levosi-
mendan group, as compared with 159 (61.6%) in 
the placebo group (P 
= 
0.02). Reasons for the in-
terruption of the infusion and for unblinding are 
reported in Tables S2 and S3, respectively, in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Hemodynamic Variables and Process of Care
Hemodynamic data were not available for all pa-
tients, because hemodynamic monitoring was not 
required and was performed according to the 
clinical condition of the patient and the judgment 
of the physician. The available hemodynamic data, 
the rates of use of vasoactive drugs, and the ino-
tropic score after randomization were similar in 
the two groups. There was no between-group dif-
ference in the available postoperative laboratory 
values. (Details are provided in Tables S4 through 
S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
No patient was lost to 30-day follow-up, and all 
the patients who underwent randomization were 
included in the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig. 1). 
At 30 days, there had been 32 deaths (12.9% of 
patients) in the levosimendan group and 33 deaths 
(12.8%) in the placebo group (absolute risk differ-
ence, 0.1 percentage points; 95% confidence in-
terval [CI], −5.7 to 5.9; P 
= 
0.97) (Table 2). There 
were no significant differences in the cause of 
death (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
No significant differences in secondary outcomes 
were observed (Tables 2 and 3). Kaplan–Meier sur-
vival plots showed no between-group difference in 
mortality rates over time (hazard ratio, 1.02; 
95% CI, 0.65 to 1.59; P 
= 
0.94) (Fig. 2). Results of 
the as-treated and per-protocol analyses, which also 
showed no significant between-group differences, 
are reported in Tables S10 and S11, respectively, in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Results of the prespecified and exploratory sub-
group analyses are reported in Figures S3 and S4, 
respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix. There 
were no significant treatment-by-subgroup interac-
tions. Analysis of 30-day mortality with stratifi-
cation according to trial center did not identify

a significant interaction. Results of univariate and 
multivariate analyses of association of baseline 
variables with 30-day mortality confirmed the lack 
of effect of levosimendan. (Details are provided in 
Fig. S5 and Tables S12 and S13 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.)
Serious adverse events were reported in 107 of 
245 patients (43.7%) in the levosimendan group 
and in 131 of 254 (51.6%) in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.08) (Table 3). Hypotension during the infu-
sion was observed in 62 of 246 patients (25.2%) in 
the levosimendan group and in 54 of 253 (21.3%)

Levosimendan for Hemodynamic Support
in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.31). There were 89 cases 
of arrhythmias, with no significant difference be-
tween the two groups.
Discussion
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial involving patients who re-
quired hemodynamic support after cardiac sur-
gery, the administration of levosimendan was not 
associated with lower 30-day mortality than pla-
cebo. There was also no significant between-group 
difference in mortality in any subgroup. No sig-
nificant difference was seen between the levosi-
mendan group and the placebo group in the inci-
dence of hypotension or arrhythmias.
Previous meta-analyses of randomized, con-
trolled trials8-11 showed a higher rate of survival with 
levosimendan than with other treatment regimens 
among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. These 
findings were not confirmed in our trial. A ben-
efit of levosimendan with regard to survival was 
also not shown in the LEVO-CTS (Levosimendan 
in Patients with Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunc-
tion Undergoing Cardiac Surgery Requiring Cardio-
pulmonary Bypass) trial, the results of which have 
been published in the Journal.23 A similar pattern 
of positive results from small randomized trials 
and meta-analyses of randomized trials of levo-
simendan,8,10,24 contradicted by a subsequent piv-
otal trial, has been observed in patients with severe 
sepsis25 or heart failure.26,27
Cardiac surgery was considered to be the most 
promising context for observing a beneficial effect 
of levosimendan, owing to the transient nature of 
postoperative myocardial dysfunction.28,29 Myocar-
dial stunning accounts for the majority of cases 
of perioperative heart failure,2,28,29 and usually the 
heart recovers within 24 to 48 hours. Because of 
its pharmacologic characteristics (increase in car-
diac output with little increase in myocardial oxy-
gen consumption), levosimendan appeared to be 
the ideal inotropic agent to support heart func-
tion in such patients. However, in our trial, levo-
simendan did not result in lower mortality than 
placebo, nor did it improve other relevant outcomes 
in this context. Our findings do not support the 
administration of levosimendan in addition to 
standard care in the management of cardiac dys-
function after cardiac surgery.
Our trial differs from previous trials in cardiac 
surgery, which mostly investigated the use of le-
vosimendan in patients undergoing coronary-
artery bypass grafting (CABG). Less than half our 
patients underwent CABG, and a similar propor-
tion underwent mitral-valve surgery. Thus, it is pos-
sible that perioperative cardiovascular dysfunction 
may have different pathophysiological features in

Ongoing cardiogenic shock was defined as a state of end‑organ hypoperfusion due to cardiac failure. The definition in‑
cluded the following hemodynamic variables: persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure of 80 to 90 mm Hg or a 
mean arterial pressure that was 30 mm Hg lower than the baseline value) with a severe reduction in cardiac index  
(<1.8 liters per minute per square meter of body‑surface area without support or 2.0 to 2.2 liters per minute per square 
meter with support) and adequate or elevated filling pressure (e.g., a left ventricular end‑diastolic pressure of >18 mm 
Hg or a right ventricular end‑diastolic pressure of >10 to 15 mm Hg), as measured with a pulmonary‑artery catheter or 
assessed by means of echocardiography.22

these patients and hence result in a different re-
sponse to levosimendan. However, in a prespeci-
fied subgroup analysis, we found no influence of 
the type of surgery on outcome.
Several previous studies of levosimendan in 
cardiac surgery, including the LEVO-CTS trial,23 
focused on patients with reduced preoperative ejec-
tion fraction.11 In contrast, we enrolled patients 
with ongoing myocardial dysfunction requiring 
inotropic support. Although subgroup analyses 
involving patients with reduced ejection fraction 
at baseline did not show any beneficial effect of 
levosimendan in our trial, there were too few such 
patients for us to draw conclusions.
The dose of levosimendan that was used in our 
trial differs from that used in other studies. In 
most previous trials, a loading dose was adminis-
tered, and in all previous trials, an infusion of at 
least 0.1 μg per kilogram per minute was used.11,30 
In our trial, we did not use a loading dose, and the 
infusion of levosimendan was started at 0.05 μg 
per kilogram per minute to avoid hypotension.

‡  
Acute kidney injury was assessed with the use of a five‑category scoring system to evaluate risk, injury, failure, loss, and 
end‑stage kidney injury (RIFLE).17 Risk was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of at least 1.5 times the 
baseline value, a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of more than 25% from baseline, or a urine output of 
less than 0.5 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour for 6 hours. Injury was defined as an increase in the serum creat‑
inine level of at least 2 times the baseline value, a decrease in the GFR of more than 50% from baseline, or a urine out‑
put of less than 0.5 ml per kilogram per hour for 12 hours. Failure was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine 
level of at least 3 times the baseline value, a serum creatinine level of at least 4 mg per deciliter, a decrease in the GFR 
of more than 75% from baseline, a urine output of less than 0.3 ml per kilogram per hour for 24 hours, or anuria for  
12 hours.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Although attending physicians were permitted to 
increase the infusion dose, the mean infusion dose 
of levosimendan that was administered in our trial 
was 0.07 μg per kilogram per minute. We chose 
this conservative approach because loading doses 
and high-dose infusions have been associated with 
hypotension and a less marked beneficial effect on 
survival.10 In a recent trial involving patients with 
sepsis, an infusion dose of 0.2 μg per kilogram 
per minute was associated with a higher incidence 
of hypotension and arrhythmias and a higher rate 
and longer duration of norepinephrine infusion 
than placebo25 — effects that did not occur in our 
trial. At the lower dose we used, we found no dif-
ference in cardiac index over time between the two 
groups (although cardiac index was not systemati-
cally recorded in our patients). However, a hemo-
dynamic effect of levosimendan is suggested by the 
greater number of attempts to increase the dose in 
the placebo group and the higher mean dose in 
the placebo group.
Our trial has some limitations. First, the trial 
was interrupted early on the grounds of futility 
for the primary outcome (30-day mortality). This 
situation may have increased the potential for type 
II error in the secondary outcomes. Second, despite 
the signals of a hemodynamic effect of levosimen-
dan, we cannot rule out the possibility that higher 
doses might have been effective in reducing mor-
tality, although higher doses might also have in-
creased the risk of adverse effects such as hypo-
tension and arrhythmias. Third, we investigated 
a mixed population of patients who were under-
going different cardiac surgical operations, includ-
ing a few patients (2.2%) without cardiopulmonary 
bypass. However, none of the subgroup analyses 
suggested a benefit in association with levosimen-
dan treatment. Fourth, we did not systematically 
collect cardiac-output data, which could have 
helped us understand and interpret the results of 
the trial. Owing to the fact that our enrollment 
criteria were based mainly on the need for hemo-
dynamic support, we may have enrolled some pa-
tients who did not have underlying severe cardiac 
dysfunction.
In conclusion, in patients with perioperative left 
ventricular dysfunction requiring hemodynamic 
support after cardiac surgery, a low-dose infusion 
of levosimendan did not result in lower 30-day 
mortality than placebo nor did it positively affect 
any secondary-outcome measures as compared 
with placebo.
