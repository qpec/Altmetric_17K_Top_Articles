IMPORTANCE The majority of individuals with type 1 diabetes do not meet recommended
glycemic targets.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of continuous glucose monitoring in adults with type 1
diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injections.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label crossover randomized clinical trial
conducted in 15 diabetes outpatient clinics in Sweden between February 24, 2014, and June 1,
2016 that included 161 individuals with type 1 diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of at least
7.5% (58 mmol/mol) treated with multiple daily insulin injections.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive treatment using a continuous
glucose monitoring system or conventional treatment for 26 weeks, separated by a washout
period of 17 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Difference in HbA1c between weeks 26 and 69 for the 2
treatments. Adverse events including severe hypoglycemia were also studied.
RESULTS Among 161 randomized participants, mean age was 43.7 years, 45.3% were women,
and mean HbA1c was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol). A total of 142 participants had follow-up data in
both treatment periods. Mean HbA1c was 7.92% (63 mmol/mol) during continuous glucose
monitoring use and 8.35% (68 mmol/mol) during conventional treatment (mean difference,
−0.43% [95% CI, −0.57% to −0.29%] or −4.7 [−6.3 to −3.1 mmol/mol]; P < .001). Of 19
secondary end points comprising psychosocial and various glycemic measures, 6 met the
hierarchical testing criteria of statistical significance, favoring continuous glucose monitoring
compared with conventional treatment. Five patients in the conventional treatment group
and 1 patient in the continuous glucose monitoring group had severe hypoglycemia. During
washout when patients used conventional therapy, 7 patients had severe hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes
treated with multiple daily insulin injections, the use of continuous glucose monitoring
compared with conventional treatment for 26 weeks resulted in lower HbA1c. Further
research is needed to assess clinical outcomes and longer-term adverse effects.

I
ntensive insulin therapy resulting in good glycemic con-
trol has been shown to prevent and reduce the progres-
sionofdiabetes-relatedcomplicationsinpatientswithtype
1 diabetes.1 Today, intensive glycemic control is generally
achieved through multiple daily insulin injections or continu-
ous subcutaneous insulin infusions through an insulin pump.2
Regularself-measuredcapillarybloodglucosevalueshavebeen
crucial to optimal insulin dosing for good glycemic control.3-5
In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has
become an option for optimal insulin dosing and other
activities.6 The advantages of CGM include providing continu-
ous feedback on estimated glucose values and illustrating glu-
cose trends. CGM systems include a subcutaneous sensor with
atransmitterattachedandcontinuousreportingofglucoselev-
els and trends to the patient by a handheld monitor.
Data from clinical trials of CGM have been mixed regard-
ingitseffectonglycemiccontrol.7Suchtrialshave,forexample,
consisted only of patients with the following characteristics:
(1) continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions; (2) initiated
CGM and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions simulta-
neously; or (3) included patients with both multiple daily insu-
lininjectionsandcontinuoussubcutaneousinsulininfusions.7-10
Posthocfindingshavealsobeenmixed,inthatglycemiccontrol
appears to differ when CGM is combined with either multiple
daily insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusions.8-10 Although the majority of adults with type 1 dia-
betes in the United States and Europe are treated with multiple
daily insulin injections, to our knowledge, clinical trials evalu-
atingCGMvsconventionaltherapyinpersonstreatedwithmul-
tiple daily insulin injections have not been performed.
The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of CGM on
glycemiccontrol,hypoglycemia,well-being,andglycemicvari-
ability in individuals with type 1 diabetes treated with mul-
tiple daily insulin injections.
Methods
The GOLD trial was approved by the ethics committee at the
University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. All partici-
pants provided verbal and written informed consent (trial pro-
tocol in Supplement 1).

Screening
Individuals aged 18 years or older with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
of at least 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) treated with multiple daily in-
sulin injections were included. Patients were required to have
a fasting C-peptide level of less than 0.91 ng/mL (to convert
to nmol/L, multiply by 0.331) and diabetes duration of greater
than 1 year. Race and ethnicity were classified by the investi-
gator or other research staff; if there was any uncertainty, the
final decision was made in collaboration with the participant.
Patients treated with insulin pumps were excluded. The
study design, including other inclusion and exclusion criteria,
have been described elsewhere.11 All laboratory tests were ana-
lyzedatacentrallaboratory(ResearchCentreforLaboratoryMedi-
cine,KarolinskaUniversityHospital,Stockholm,Sweden).Gothia
Forum (Gothenburg, Sweden) performed trial monitoring.
Run-in Period
During a 6-week run in, patients completed masked CGM for 2
weeksandquestionnairesregardingthefollowingcharacteristics:
subjectivewell-being(WorldHealthOrganization-5[WHO-5]),12
treatmentsatisfaction(DiabetesTreatmentSatisfactionQuestion-
naire [status version and change version]),13-15 fear of hypogly-
cemia(HypoglycemiaFearSurvey),16-18hypoglycemicconfidence
(HypoglycemiaConfidenceQuestionnaire),anddiabetes-related
distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale).19,20 During masked
CGM,glucoselevelswererecordedbutwerenotseenbythepa-
tient. After masked CGM, patients were excluded if they either
didnotbelievetheywouldweartheCGMsensormorethan80%
of the time or did not perform adequate calibrations during the
run in (on average ≥12 of 14 during a 7-day period).
Randomization
Patients were randomized 1:1 into the first treatment period
to CGM using the Dexcom G4 PLATINUM stand-alone system
or conventional therapy. Randomization was performed by a
centralized web-based program stratifying patients by site ac-
cording to a predefined sequence; random block size varied
between 1 + 1 and 2 + 2 (eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Treatment
CGM was compared with conventional therapy using only self-
monitoringofbloodglucose.Patientswerenotblindedtotreat-
ment. All patients received basic instruction on insulin dosing,
suchasboluscorrection,foodchoices,andtheeffectofphysical
activity on glucose control. A graph was displayed for patients

Key Points
Question Does continuous glucose monitoring improve glycemic
control in adults with type 1 diabetes treated with multiple daily
insulin injections?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 161 adults with type 1
diabetes, glycemic control was improved during continuous
glucose monitoring compared with conventional treatment
(hemoglobin [HbA1c] of 7.92% vs 8.35% [63 vs 68 mmol/mol]).
The mean difference in HbA1c was 0.43% (4.7 mmol/mol).
Meaning Continuous glucose monitoring may result in better
glycemic control compared with conventional treatment, but
further research is needed to assess clinical outcomes and
longer-term adverse effects.

Clinical Assessments
Patientswereassessedatthestartofeachtreatmentperiodand
at weeks 2, 4, 13, and 26. HbA1c was measured at all visits in
each treatment period except week 2.
MaskedCGMwasperformed2weeksbeforebothtreatment
periods. During conventional therapy, masked CGM was also
performed during 2 of the 4 last weeks to evaluate total time in
hypoglycemia, euglycemia, hyperglycemia, and glycemic vari-
ability. At all visits, CGM and self-measurements of blood glu-
cose data were downloaded and used to assess glucose levels,
number of self-measurements of blood glucose, time CGM was
inuse,andforoptimizingglycemiccontrol.Tomaintainanequal
number of visits for both treatment periods, the study did not
permit extra patient visits for improving glycemic control.
End Points
TheprimaryendpointwasthedifferenceinHbA1cbetweenCGM
and conventional therapy at weeks 26 and 69. Secondary end
pointsincludedmeanamplitudeglycemicexcursions22;thestan-
dard deviation of glucose levels; and the amount of time in hy-
poglycemia, hyperglycemia, and euglycemia during CGM use.
Other end points included the following questionnaire results:
DiabetesTreatmentSatisfactionstatus(minimumscore,0;maxi-
mum,36;highervalueindicatesbettersatisfaction)andchange
in satisfaction (minimum, −18; maximum, 18; higher value in-
dicates better change in satisfaction), WHO-5 Well-Being Index
(minimum, 0; maximum, 100, higher value indicates better
well-being), Hypoglycemic Fear Behavior Scale (minimum, 0;
maximum, 4; higher value indicates greater fear) and Hypogly-
cemic Fear Worry Scale (minimum, 0; maximum, 4; higher
valueindicatesgreaterfear),andtheProblemAreasInDiabetes
scale (minimum, 0; maximum, 100; higher value indicates
greater problems). Other end points were the number of self-
measurementsofbloodglucoseandrateofseverehypoglycemia,
definedasunconsciousnessfromhypoglycemiaorrequiringas-
sistance from another person. All end points were described in
theoriginalprotocolsubmittedtotheethicalcommitteebefore
study start (Supplement 1). At study start, the protocol was
amended to substitute number of self-measurements of blood
glucose as an end point for total insulin dose, and the Hypogly-
cemia Confidence Questionnaire was added.
Statistics
The reduction 0.3% (3 mmol/mol) in HbA1c is generally con-
sidered a clinically meaningful reduction to reduce diabetic
long-term complications.23,24 The study was powered to de-
tectadifferenceof0.3%(3mmol/mol)inHbA1cbetweenweeks
26 and 69 at 90% power and assuming a standard deviation
of 1.1%, which required 144 participants. Assuming a dropout
rate of 10%, 160 individuals were required for enrollment.
No interim analysis was performed.
The full analysis set consisted of all randomized patients
who had at least 1 follow-up measurement in each treatment
period. The safety analysis consisted of all randomized pa-
tients who received treatment (CGM or conventional therapy)
at any time with patients assigned to treatment administered
but not randomized treatment.
The primary efficacy analysis was the difference in HbA1c
at weeks 26 and 69 between CGM and conventional therapy

for the full analysis set, with adjustment for treatment period
andpatienteffectsusingprocedureforgeneralizedlinearmod-
els in SAS software, with sequence, patient (sequence), pe-
riod, and treatment as class variables.
The last observation carried forward principle was ap-
plied for any missing efficacy measurements from the last
weeks of each treatment period. Last observation carried for-
ward was not applied to measurements at the first visit in each
treatmentperiod.Aposthocsensitivityanalysisofprimaryout-
come was performed by multiple imputation with 50 study
samplings on all patients randomized by using demograph-
ics, baseline characteristics, baseline comorbidities, and HbA1c
values at run in and randomization as imputation variables.
A second post hoc sensitivity analysis investigating the effect
of the site and interaction between site and treatment mod-
eled as fixed effects on the primary outcome was performed.
Secondary efficacy analyses of normally distributed vari-
ables were also adjusted for treatment period and patient ef-
fects on the full analysis set. For other secondary efficacy vari-
ables,theFishernonparametric2-samplepermutationtestwas
used to test between treatment sequences on period changes
(except for analysis of the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic
events in which the treatment groups were handled as 2 in-
dependent samples and tested using the Fisher exact test).
The theory of sequential multiple test procedures was ap-
plied for the primary and secondary confirmatory analyses.
If a 2-sided test gave a significant result at the .05 signifi-
cance level, the total test mass of .05 was transferred to the
next variable in the test sequence until a nonsignificant re-
sult was achieved. All these significant tests were then con-
sidered confirmatory. All other end points are considered de-
scriptive and are presented in eTable 3 (in Supplement 2).
Calculations were performed using SAS statistical soft-
ware version 9.4.

2 (2.9%) patients at the end of CGM therapy and 3 (4.1%) at the
end of conventional therapy.
Glycemic Outcomes
Results of prespecified analyses of the primary and second-
ary end points are shown in Table 3. For the primary efficacy
analysis, mean (SD) HbA1c during CGM use was 7.92% (0.8%)
(63 mmol/mol) and during conventional treatment was 8.35%
(0.9%) (68 mmol/mol) (mean difference, −0.43% [95% CI,
−0.57% to −0.29%] or −4.7 mmol/mol [95% CI, −6.27 to −3.13
mmol/mol]); P < .001). HbA1c was lower in CGM-treated pa-
tients during the first and second treatment periods, whereas
levels were similar at the beginning of both periods (Figure 2).
ThestandarddeviationofbloodglucoseestimatedbyCGMand
compared with masked CGM during conventional treatment
was lower during CGM use than conventional therapy (68.49
vs 77.23 mg/dL; P < .001) as was the case for mean amplitude
of glycemic excursions (Table 3).

Treatment Adherence
Overall mean time of CGM use, estimated by the proportion
of CGM data downloaded in relation to follow-up time, was
87.8% during CGM treatment periods. CGM use ranged be-
tween 86.5% and 91.9% during various study visits (eTable 1
in Supplement 2). HbA1c was reduced by 0.46% (0.31%-
0.61%) in patients using the CGM sensor more than 70% of the
time, and there was no significant difference in HbA1c for those
using the CGM sensor for less than 70% of the time.
Self-measurement of Blood Glucose
Patients performed a mean (SD) of 2.75 (1.39) self-
measurements of blood glucose during CGM therapy and 3.66
(2.30) during conventional therapy.

patients treated with CGM (n = 11) had reduced HbA1c from ran-
domizationtofollow-up—from9.4%to8.4%(reduction,1.0%)—
whereaspatientswithconventionaltherapyhadincreasedHbA1c
from 9.9% to 10.0% (increase, 0.1%).
Hypoglycemia
DuringCGMuse,themean(SD)percentageoftimepatientswere
in a hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dL) was 2.79% (2.97%) and
4.79%(4.03%)duringconventionaltherapyandforglucoselev-
els of less than 54 mg/dL, the percentage of time was 0.79%
(1.23%)duringCGMuseand1.89%(2.12%)duringconventional

patient-years).Therewere7severehypoglycemiaeventsduring
thewashoutperiodwhenpatientswereundergoingconventional
therapy (event rate, 0.41 per 1000 patient-years).
Adverse Events
In total, there were 77 patients with 137 adverse events dur-
ing CGM and 67 patients with 122 adverse events during con-
ventional therapy (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). There were no
obvious numerical differences for any adverse event be-
tween the treatments. One patient in the CGM group discon-
tinued use because of an allergic reaction to the sensor. There
were 7 patients with a total of 9 serious adverse events during
CGM treatment and 3 patients with total of 9 serious adverse
events during conventional treatment (eTable 5 in Supplement
2). Ketoacidosis was not reported during the study.
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Outcome HbA1c
In a sensitivity analysis (performed by using multiple impu-
tation) of the primary outcome, including all participants in
the trial (n = 161), the effect on HbA1c by CGM was 0.39% (95%
CI, 0.24%-0.55% [P < .001]). The second sensitivity analysis
of primary outcome (adjusted for the site effect and interac-
tion between site and treatment) showed an HbA1c reduction
of0.43%(95%CI,0.22%-0.64%[P < .001])forCGMusevscon-
ventional therapy. The interaction between site and treat-
ment term was not significant (P = .84).
Post hoc Analysis
The weight at the end of conventional therapy was 82.5 kg and
for CGM therapy was 83.1 kg (mean difference, 0.63 [P = .01])
and total daily insulin dose was 57.8 U (0.69 units/kg) at the
endofconventionaltherapyand56.5U(0.67units/kg)forCGM
therapy(meandifferencefortotaldoseinU/kg,−0.02[P = .01]).
Discussion
In this crossover study of persons with type 1 diabetes treated
withmultipledailyinsulininjections,CGMwasassociatedwith
a mean HbA1c level that was 0.43% (4.7 mmol/mol) less than
conventionaltreatment.Moreover,glycemicvariabilitywasre-
duced by CGM. Subjective well-being and treatment satisfac-
tion were greater during CGM than conventional therapy.

The population evaluated in the current study differs to a
great extent from earlier clinical trials of CGM.7-10,25,26 The cur-
rent study aimed to include a more general population of per-
sons with type 1 diabetes. In contrast to earlier trials, the cur-
rent study had no upper limit of HbA1c for inclusion, which
includes the group of patients with the greatest excess
mortality27,28 and the highest risk of diabetic complications
since an exponential relationship exists between higher HbA1c
levels and diabetic complications.23 Hence, finding treat-
ment options for reducing HbA1c in these patients is of great
concern. Baseline HbA1c was also high (8.7%) in the current
population, and not only was mean HbA1c reduced but fewer
patients also had very high HbA1c levels during CGM therapy.

Also in contrast to earlier CGM-studies,7-10,25,26 the current

CGM than conventional therapy (2.7 vs 3.7 measurements/d).
When used in connection with an insulin pump, CGM may
ease adjusting insulin doses with respect to observed CGM
patterns.2 Certain processes in the pump can also be guided by
CGM information, such as halting the insulin infusion during a
rapid decline in glucose.26 Conversely, most adults with type 1
diabetes are treated with multiple daily insulin injections.29
Therefore,novelcomplementarytreatmentstrategiesareneeded
onabroadlevel.Intheintervention/controlsequence,HbA1cre-
verted back to prestudy levels during the washout period
(Figure 2), indicating that there was no carry-over effect. In ac-
cordance with earlier findings,9 these results also suggest that
the effectiveness of CGM depends on uninterrupted use during
multiple daily insulin injections treatment. Our study in-
creasesknowledgeinthefieldoftype1diabetesinreportingthat
CGM may be a beneficial option for multiple daily insulin injec-
tions–treated patients with respect to HbA1c levels.
A novel feature of this trial is a more comprehensive inves-
tigationofpsychosocialvariables,whicharenowrecognizedas
ahighpriorityinclinicaldiabetesguidelines.30Toourknowledge,

fect on well-being is consistent with previous studies that have

fidence improved during CGM therapy, but it should be inter-
preted with greater caution since this was an exploratory end

Thisstudyhadanumberoflimitations.First,19patients(ap-
proximately 12.0%) had no follow-up data in the second treat-
mentperiodandwerenotincludedintheprimaryanalysis.Gen-
erally, in a parallel-group study, this can lead to an imbalance
betweengroups.However,inthecurrentstudy,patientsserved
as their own controls and thus no such problem existed. It has
therefore been proposed that the full analysis set population
shouldbeusedincrossoverstudiesasthemainanalysis.37Inad-
dition,withthecrossoverdesign,itcanbedeterminedwhether
results are going in the same direction during the first treat-
ment period from a parallel design perspective. Sixteen of the
19 patients who had no follow-up data in the second treatment
periodhadHbA1c dataduringthefirstfollow-upperiod.Among
these patients, those with CGM had a 1.0% decrease in HbA1c,
whereas those with conventional therapy had an increase of
0.1%.ThereweremorepatientstreatedwithCGMthanconven-
tionaltherapywhodiscontinuedtreatmentduringthefirsttreat-
mentperiod.ThiswasduetopatientswantingtocontinueCGM
andthereforenotcompletingthestudywhilereceivingconven-
tional therapy in the second period and also due to patients ex-
periencing device-related problems (Figure 1).
A second limitation is that the study could not be blinded
and hence patients were aware of the intervention. It cannot
be excluded that this, to some extent, could have influenced
the treatment effect. Although the current reduction in HbA1c
may be clinically important, other treatment alternatives are
needed for persons with type 1 diabetes to obtain good glyce-
mic control on a broad level. In addition, the current results
are restricted to patients with HbA1c of at least 7.5%.
Conclusions
Among patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes
treated with multiple daily insulin injections, the use of CGM
compared with conventional treatment for 26 weeks resulted
in lower HbA1c. Further research is needed to assess clinical
outcomes and longer-term adverse effects.
