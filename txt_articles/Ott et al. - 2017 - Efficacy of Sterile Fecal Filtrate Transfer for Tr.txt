BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) is a highly effective therapy for recurrent Clostridium
difficile infection (CDI). However, transferring undefined living
bacteria entails uncontrollable risks for infectious and meta-
bolic or malignant diseases, particularly in immunocompro-
mised patients. We investigated whether sterile fecal filtrates
(containing
bacterial
debris,
proteins,
antimicrobial
com-
pounds, metabolic products, and oligonucleotides/DNA), rather
than intact microorganisms, are effective in patients with CDI.
METHODS: We performed a clinical case series to investigate
the effects of fecal filtrate transfer (FFT) in 5 patients with
symptomatic chronic-relapsing CDI at the Department of In-
ternal Medicine I at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein
(Kiel, Germany). Patients were followed up for at least 6
months and for up to 33 months. Stool was collected from 5
donors selected by the patients, and fully characterized ac-
cording to FMT standards. Stool was sterile-filtered to remove
small particles and bacteria; the filtrate was transferred to
patients in a single administration via nasojejunal tube. Fecal
samples were collected from patients before and at 1 week and
6 weeks after FFT. Microbiome, virome, and proteome profiles
of donors and patients were compared. RESULTS: In all 5
patients, FFT restored normal stool habits and eliminated
symptoms of CDI for a minimum period of 6 months. Proteome
analyses of selected FFT filtrates showed no obvious protein
candidates associated with therapeutic efficacy. 16S ribosomal
RNA gene sequencing detected diverse bacterial DNA signa-
tures in the filtrates. Analysis of virus-like particles from a
filtrate found to reduce symptoms of CDI showed a complex
signature of bacteriophages. Bacterial phylogeny and virome
profile analyses of fecal samples from recipients indicated
longitudinal changes in microbial and viral community struc-
tures after FFT. CONCLUSIONS: A preliminary investigation of
5 patients with CDI shows that transfer of sterile filtrates from
donor stool (FFT), rather than fecal microbiota, can be suffi-
cient to restore normal stool habits and eliminate symptoms.
This finding indicates that bacterial components, metabolites,
or bacteriophages mediate many of the effects of FMT, and
that FFT might be an alternative approach, particularly for
immunocompromised patients.

F
ecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly
effective therapy of recurrent Clostridium difficile
infection (CDI) with consistent disease resolution rates of
85%–90% after 1 treatment and up to 100% after a second
treatment, using either fresh or cryopreserved stool from
healthy, well-characterized donors.1–17 The paradigm of
FMT is to improve intestinal dysbiosis by transferring stool
preparations containing a stable, viable, diverse, and normal
microbial community from a healthy donor or from defined
intestinal bacterial strains.
Despite the superb efficacy and the good short-term
safety profile of FMT, it bears major problems of stan-
dardization and is accompanied by potentially incalculable
long-term risks, many of which are inherent to the transfer
of living microorganisms.6,18,19 Standardized recruiting of
well-characterized healthy stool donor populations and the
use of microbe-conserving freezing procedures for stool
preparations is used to overcome the problem of availability
and some of the safety issues.1,4,7,9,12–14,16,20 Although FMT
also has been shown to be safe and efficacious in immu-
nocompromised patients,21,22 it still would be highly desir-
able to reduce the risk of adverse events in patients with
limited eligibility for FMT.1,14,21 Moreover, even the most
rigorous and costly donor screening procedures,1,4,20 or
defined panels of bacteria, cannot exclude the risk of
transferring unknown pathogens or undetectable functional
characteristics within the living microorganisms to the

bolic diseases, cancer, atopy, or autoimmunity.4,6,18–20,23–26
The original concept of FMT is based on 2 main premises,
namely that patients with dysbiosis have either completely
lost their healthy microbiota or that their microbiota is un-
able to regain its normal functionality, and that these diverse
pathologic states of the intestinal microbiota can be corrected
by transferring a stable, viable, diverse, and healthy microbial
community contained in stool preparations or defined bac-
terial groups from healthy donors. Classic FMT techniques
therefore all aim to maintain as much of the microbial di-
versity and natural composition of the donor microbiota as
possible, and techniques using defined sets of bacteria have
the goal to transfer both the necessary and the sufficient
microbial players. Interestingly, the results from recent
clinical investigations, which successfully used different
FMT-related techniques for the treatment of CDI, now allow
determination of the intersection of the underlying thera-
peutic principles. A recent study clearly has shown the long-
term co-existence of donor and host microbiota after FMT;
however, whether a more efficient transfer (ie, higher simi-
larity between donor and host) correlates with clinical suc-
cess of FMT currently is unclear.27
In FMT using freshly prepared stool or cryopreserved stool
containing living microbiota from either single or pooled
donor feces,1–17 the therapeutically active agent(s) theoreti-
cally could just as well be elements of the virome, other
components of the fecal water, or even products of the donor’s
human cells. However, the similar success rates of therapies
using defined panels of fecal bacteria (eg, rectal bacter-
iotherapy28 or the microbiota suspension RBX2660 [Rebiotix,
Roseville, MN]29) or a selection of bacterial spores, such as the
nontoxinogenicC difficilestrain M3,30 stronglysuggest thatthe
active agents are containedinthe bacterialfraction, which may
include, for example, specific structures, antimicrobial com-
pounds, and/or metabolites produced by the transferred
bacteria oralso maybeintegratedbacteriophages(prophages)
that may be activated and released under certain conditions.31
With FMT, considerable amounts of stool water con-
taining dead bacteria, their debris, and their metabolites are
transferred in addition to the living microbiota.31 Given the
diversity of effective therapies for CDI as outlined earlier,
we examined whether the ingredients of fecal water alone
(eg, bacterial debris, proteins, antimicrobial compounds,
metabolic products, or oligonucleotides/DNA) had any
clinical efficacy in patients with CDI. For this purpose,
conventionally produced FMT preparations additionally
were sterile-filtered to enable sterile fecal filtrate transfer
(FFT) from healthy donors to 5 patients for the therapy of
chronic-relapsing CDI-associated symptomatology.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This was an open-label case series performed at the
Department of Internal Medicine I of the University Hospital
Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, Germany. The application of FFT for
the treatment of chronic-relapsing CDI-associated symptom-
atology received full and unconditional approval by the
Institutional Review Board (medical governance commission)
of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein. All participants
provided written informed consent.
Study Population
Donors and patients were screened according to compre-
hensive guidelines.1 According to German guidelines and cor-
responding standard operating procedures of our hospital, the
following test plan was realized. All patients were tested for 3
diagnostic characteristics of C difficile infection: (1) enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay for C difficile–specific glutamate
dehydrogenase (Techlab C. Diff Quik Chek Complete; Techlab,
Blacksburg, VA), (2) C difficile toxin enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (Techlab C. Diff Quik Chek Complete), and (3)
detection of toxin-producing C difficile by culture. Any 2 posi-
tive results of these tests were considered a definitive diagnosis
of C difficile infection. Patients were followed up clinically for a
period of at least 6 months for no recurrence of symptoms; the
first patient has been symptom-free since January 2014. The
patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Stool Preparation
Fresh donor stool was collected and stored in an airtight
container at 4�C until processing. As a general rule, stool was
processed no later than 2 hours after collection, and the trans-
plantation to the recipient was performed no later than 6 hours
after stool donation. In a dedicated biosafety cabinet, approxi-
mately 50 g of fecal material was weighed and transferred to a
standard commercial blender (Moulinex Multi Moulinette 400
W; SEB, Écully, France). Subsequently, 500 mL of sterile normal
saline (0.9% sodium chloride) was added, and the stool was
homogenized for approximately 1 minute at the highest blending
level. The resulting slurry then was distributed into ten 50-mL
centrifugation tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and
centrifuged for 10 minutes at approximately 1800 � g to pellet
large particles. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a
beaker and filtered 3 times through disposable cellulose paper
filters (pore size, 5–10 mm) placed in a stainless-steel sieve. For
the conventional FMT treatment of patient 2, the resulting pre-
filtered slurry containing the fecal microbiota then was applied
by nasojejunal tube as described later.
Preparation of FFT Filtrates
For preparation of the FFT filtrate, the prefiltered stool
slurry was filtered further using a custom-built air pressure
filtration system (PALL, Dreieich, Germany) including a 5.7 L
(6 bar) UCON pressure unit (UCON, Hausach, Germany) and a
WIKA 0.5-inch TC inline diaphragm seal (±6 bar, S/N; WIKA,
Klingenberg, Germany) at a pressure of 1.5–2 bars and with the
following filtration steps: (1) small-particle removal using 2
consecutive depth filters: Seitz K 700 P 60 D (retention rating,
6.0–15.0 mm; PALL) plus Seitz KS 50 P 60 D (retention rating,
0.4–0.8 mm; PALL); and (2) microbiota depletion using a SUPOR
EKV Filter Mini Kleenpak 0.2-mm unit (PALL).
The resulting FFT filtrate was a light brown, clear liquid
with a subjectively less unpleasant and intensive odor in
comparison with the prefiltered, microbiota-rich slurry used in
conventional stool preparations for FMT.

the FFT filtrates, samples of the filtrates and of the original

 materials were subjected to bacterial culture. In brief, the fil-
trates and donor stools were transported to the accredited
clinical microbiology laboratory of the University Hospital
Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel (Germany) under anaerobic condi-
tions. Here, filtrates and donor stool samples (dissolved in
sterile saline) were streaked onto sterile blood agar plates
(Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood: casein peptone 12.0 g,
meat peptone 5.0 g, sodium chloride 5.0 g, beef extract 3.0 g,
yeast extract 3.0 g, corn starch 1.0 g, sheep blood 5%, agar
13.5 g, and demineralized water up to 1000 mL; catalogue
number PB5008A; Remel, Lenexa, KS) and cultured in parallel
under anaerobic and aerobic conditions at 37�C for up to
48 hours. Donor stool was used as a positive control. Bacterial
growth could not be observed from FFT filtrates, whereas the
corresponding stool cultures yielded abundant colony numbers
under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
Administration of FFT Filtrates
Before FFT administration, 1000 mL of Klean-Prep intesti-
nal lavage solution (Norgine, Marburg, Germany) was admin-
istered to the patients via a nasojejunal tube inserted by
gastroscopy using a fiberoptic system (Olympus, Hamburg,
Germany) and controlled by an APPLIX Smart/Vision system
(Fresenius KABI, Bad Homburg, Germany). Subsequently, the
FFT filtrate was transferred to a plastic bag (APPLIX HydroBag;
Fresenius KABI) and administered via the same nasojejunal
tube within approximately 30 minutes.
Microbiota and Virus Analyses of Fecal Samples
and FFT Filtrates
Genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the
PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions,32 with some modifications
as described previously.32
The 16S ribosomal RNA gene variable regions V433 or
V3–V434 were amplified in duplicate reactions using 2 mL of
fecal genomic DNA. The amplified products were run on
agarose gels to assess the amplicon size and amplification
performance. Amplicon quantities were normalized using the
SequalPrep kit (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Darmstadt, Germany). Equal amounts of polymerase chain re-
action products were pooled in a single tube and sequenced on
an Illumina MiSeq platform using 2 � 250 bp (for V4 regions)
and 2 � 300 bp (for V3–V4 regions) sequencing kits (Illumina,
San Diego, CA).
Sequencing reads were processed primarily for quality con-
trol using the software Mothur.35 Forward and reverse reads
were assembled to form contigs (herein referred to as se-
quences). Sequences with any ambiguous base or more than 6
homopolymers as well as sequences not perfectly matching with
16S-specific primers and/or barcode indices were removed from
downstream analysis. This initial quality control enabled us to
remove spurious sequencing artifacts. The remaining sequences
were aligned to the Mothur-curated Silva reference alignment
(release 123) and eliminated, if not aligned to a specific 16S
variable region. The sequences remaining after this step were
screened for chimeric origin by using the Uchime algorithm,36
and chimeras were removed. Finally, sequences were assigned
to taxonomic hierarchy using Greengenes reference training sets
(13_8_99 release) with an 80% confidence threshold. This
reference training data set contains approximately 10% species
level classification. Sequences classified as eukaryotic, chloro-
plastic, mitochondrial, or of unknown origin also were removed
from analysis. Sequences restricted to bacterial origins only were
clustered into phylotypes (label ¼ 1) using Greengenes reference
taxonomy. Phylogenetic nominations of phylotypes were deter-
mined by using the complete taxonomy file generated as
described earlier. Principle coordinate analysis was performed
using PAST software37 version 3.10 on distance matrices based
on the presence/absence or the relative abundances of bacterial
phylotypes in fecal microbiota. Bacterial estimated richness
(Chao 1) and diversity (nonparametric Shannon index) were
calculated on subsamples using shared phylotypes (4708
sequences
per
sample)
to
adjust
the
sampling
depth.
Subsampling and diversity estimation were performed using
Mothur.35
Virus-like particle purification and DNA extraction were
performed for patients 4 and 5, their donors, and the FFT
filtrates as described previously,38 with some modifications.
The detailed methods are included in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods section. Only the preparations from
the samples of patient 4 fulfilled all quality criteria and could be
analyzed adequately.

Samples of the FFT filtrates used to treat patient 4 (1 sam-
ple) and patient 5 (2 separate FFT filtrates prepared on

Results
Case Histories and Outcomes
Patient 1 was a 59-year-old Caucasian woman who
presented with 3 episodes of recurrent CDI over a 6-month
period (confirmed by positive testing for C difficile gluta-
mate dehydrogenase and C difficile toxins A and B). The
patient’s first episode of CDI had occurred after sigmoid
resection owing to life-threatening recurrent diverticulitis
with severe bleeding, which had required therapy with
ciprofloxacin
and
metronidazole
(Table
1).
At
initial
diagnosis, the patient suffered from pseudomembranous
colitis. After comprehensive screening,1 the patient was
treated with sterile FFT filtrate from stool from the pa-
tient’s son. The patient could be discharged on the next day
and was symptom-free after 3 days. C difficile remained
undetectable (culture, toxin) 4 weeks after the procedure.
The patient had no further diarrhea, regained her normal
weight, and has remained symptom-free to date (2 years
and 5 months at the completion of the study on June 30,
2016) (Table 1).
Patient 2 was a 73-year-old Caucasian woman who had
suffered for years from recurrent fetid diarrhea and
802

 abdominal pain that developed after a CDI treated with
antibiotics (Table 1). Although symptoms recurred, labora-
tory tests for C difficile toxins A and B or other pathogens
performed during previous outside appointments remained
negative. However, the symptoms responded to antibiotic
therapy with metronidazole and vancomycin, suggesting an
active role of C difficile in the pathogenesis of recurrent
diarrhea in this patient. The further history comprised
gastrectomy with postoperative chemotherapy 7 years pre-
viously and 1 episode of acute diverticulitis requiring anti-
biotic intervention 1 year before CDI. Three months after
symptomatic recurrence, conventional FMT was performed
(jejunal infusion of stool from the patient’s husband) after
comprehensive screening.1 FMT resulted in a moderate
increase in body temperature (up to 38�C) for approximately
2 hours after FMT and in 1 episode of watery diarrhea for 2
days after FMT. The patient reported a significant reduction
of symptoms including normalization of stool frequency and
consistency (�2 formed stools/day). Diarrhea and abdom-
inal pain recurred after 2 weeks, and 3 months after FMT the
patient presented with similar symptoms as before. Tests for
C difficile glutamate dehydrogenase were positive, however,
results for toxin detection were inconclusive and culture
failed; a polymerase chain reaction was not performed. The
patient’s husband also was used as a donor for FFT, which
was well tolerated. Neither a change in body temperature
nor diarrhea were observed, and the patient could be
discharged the next day. The patient was symptom-free after
3 days and has been symptom-free since (2 years at the
completion of the study) (Table 1).
Patient 3 was a 72-year-old Caucasian man hospitalized
because of acute C difficile–associated diarrhea, which was
his second relapse of CDI (Table 1). The history was sig-
nificant for chronic therapy with cyclosporine after kidney
transplant 24 years previously, with a series of severe in-
fections, including septicemia resulting from an earlier CDI
3 years before the present episode. Comorbidities included
severe coronary heart disease with multiple stent implants,
syndrome X, and current nicotine abuse. The current CDI
episode
required
hospitalization
because
of
extensive
diarrhea and fever leading to loss of kidney function
(glomerular filtration rate, 48 mL/min). Therapy with
vancomycin, rifaximin, and Saccharomyces boulardii failed,
as documented by repeated detection of C difficile glutamate
dehydrogenase and toxins A and B in stools. Because of the
history of infectious complications, FFT was preferred over
conventional FMT to avoid any infection risk through the
transfer
of
living
microbiota.
After
comprehensive
screening,1 the patient was treated with an FFT filtrate from
the patient’s sister. FFT was well tolerated without fever or
any other side effects. The patient was discharged from the
hospital on the day after FFT treatment, was symptom-free
after 3 days, and has remained so until today (2 years at the
completion of the study) (Table 1).
Patient 4 was a 49-year-old Caucasian man presenting
with a third episode of acute C difficile infection with severe
diarrhea and dehydration (Table 1). The patient was
immunosuppressed because of chronic human immunode-
ficiency virus infection and received antiviral therapy. After
treatment with cefuroxime and clindamycin for Staphylo-
coccus aureus infection after bone surgery in July 2015,
the patient developed severe diarrhea. The diagnosis of
C difficile infection was established by positive tests
as described earlier. Under antibiotic therapy with metro-
nidazole, symptoms of C difficile infection ceased. Within a
few weeks after initial treatment, however, symptoms re-
occurred with positive test results for C difficile infection.
A course of vancomycin stopped the symptoms, but C
difficile infection recurred again after approximately 3
weeks. A second course of vancomycin over 10 days
improved the clinical symptoms. After vancomycin, a ther-
apy with FFT filtrate (from the patient’s sister) was per-
formed in December 2015. The FFT therapy was well
tolerated without side effects. The patient was discharged
on the next day, became symptom-free after 2 days, and has
remained so to date (6 months at the completion of the
study) (Table 1).
Patient 5 was a 75-year-old Caucasian woman with a
diagnosis of colon cancer of the sigmoid (May 2015), which
was removed surgically (Table 1). A few days after surgery,
the patient developed sutural dehiscence with local infec-
tion. The patient was treated with diverse antibiotics for this
local infection before severe diarrhea occurred and C diffi-
cile infection was detected by the tests described earlier. She
received several courses of metronidazole and vancomycin,
the last time before FFT therapy. We performed FFT therapy
in December 2015 using fecal material from a nonrelated
donor as a prophylaxis against further episodes of C difficile
infection. The patient showed no side effects, could be dis-
charged on the next day, was symptom-free after 4 days,
and has remained so until today (6 months at the comple-
tion of the study) (Table 1).
Fecal Bacterial and Viral Profile Analysis in
Donors and Patients
After the surprising treatment success with patient 1,
16S ribosomal RNA gene-based microbiota analyses were
performed for the subsequent 4 patients using amplicon
sequencing. When comparing samples from before, 1 week
after, and 6 weeks after FFT treatment, we found that FFT
led to substantial bacterial community shifts in all patients
(Figures
1–4
and
Supplementary
Figures
1
and
2).
b-diversity analyses (Supplementary Figure 3) showed that
in none of the cases did the shifts represent a close phe-
nocopy of the donor fecal microbiota community, as has
been reported previously also for instances of normal
FMT.39,40 In many cases, the abundance shifts of bacterial
phylotypes already were present at week 1 and remained
stable until week 6, particularly in patient 3 (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure 1B) and in patient 4 (Figure 3 and
Supplementary Figure 2A). Formal Jaccard-based (shared
phylotypes) and Bray–Curtis–based (phylotype abundance)
b-diversity analyses confirmed major distance shifts be-
tween time points (Supplementary Figure 3). Detailed
investigation of the most strongly decreasing or increasing
bacterial phylotypes showed complex dynamic shifts, with
the extent and direction of some phylotype changes also

 being substantially different between week 1 and week 6,
for example, cyanobacteria and Bifidobacterium in patient 2
(Supplementary Figure 1A), or several changes in Bacter-
oidetes, particularly Bacteroides eggerthii, in patient 5
(Supplementary Figure 2B).
It is important to keep in mind that, in contrast to
conventional FMT, transferring sterile FFT filtrates cannot
be expected to establish a microbiota similar to that of the
donor in the receiving patient. Accordingly, conventional
comparisons of the stool microbiomes of the donor and
patient before and after treatment as shown in Figures 1–4
may not appropriately reflect the relevant changes, but
merely show a shift of a-diversity in the recipient after FFT
treatment (Figure 5). Increases in the Chao 1 richness es-
timate (patient 5) and Shannon diversity index (patients 3
and 4) 6 weeks after FFT, and an interim dip after week 1
during microbiota re-establishment in patient 4 (Chao 1)
and patient 5 (Shannon) suggested shifts of diversity, but

 not universally in the same direction in all patients. With
regard to microbial DNA as a potential stimulus for
re-establishing the recipient’s microbiome, the FFT filtrate
contained significant amounts of bacterial DNA, which
reflected at least in part the bacterial diversity from fecal
DNA, as shown in Supplementary Figure 4 for the filtrate
used in patient 4.
After the successful treatment of patients 1–3, we
decided also to analyze viruses and the proteome (see later)
contained in the FFT filtrates used to treat patients 4 and 5
to obtain an impression of the types and diversity of the
transferred bacteriophages. We hypothesized that bacte-
riophages in the filtrate also could represent the mechanism
of action of FFT, because the intersection of therapeutically
effective FMT and FMT-like therapies reduces the candi-
dates for viral efficacy factors to temperate phages (see
Discussion section). A complete set of samples with suffi-
cient quality for virus analyses could be obtained only for

variety of Lactococcus bacteriophages. Figure 6 shows that
the phageome of the patient was altered substantially in
response to FFT and tended to resemble the donor
phageome after 6 weeks.
Proteome Analysis of FFT Filtrates
The proteome contained in the FFT filtrates used to treat
patients 4 and 5 was analyzed to identify protein candidates
that may be responsible, in part, for the therapeutic efficacy
of FFT. From the donor feces for patient 5, there were 2
separate FFT filtrates prepared on different days to obtain a
better impression of the reproducibility of the FFT filtrate’s
protein content.

identified in all 3 samples were of human origin (304, 259,
and 245, respectively). Furthermore, a number of bacterial
and fungal proteins were identified (62, 41, and 22,
respectively). The solid-phase extraction approach yielded
10 additional proteins (3 of human origin and 7 of bacterial
or fungal origin). Gel-based analysis (SDS–Coomassie, data
not shown) and assessment of the peptide spectral matches
as well as of the precursor ion signals showed significantly
higher signals of all human matches compared with their
bacterial and fungal counterparts. From the observed dif-
ferences, we estimated the amount of human protein in the
filtrates to be greater than 90%. The total number of pro-
teins identified in the 3 samples was 496, with an overlap
of approximately 50% between the FFT filtrates of the 2

Discussion
This open-label series strongly suggests that FFT
should be evaluated in a controlled setting in comparison
with standard FMT. Source materials for such trials could
be well-characterized standard donors, donor banks, arti-
ficial stool from bioreactors,41,42 or defined bacteria.28–30,43
A key advantage of FFT is the avoidance of all risks
inherent to the transfer of living microorganisms. Further
advantages include the potential for standardization and
for the development of a robust, inexpensive, and patient-
friendly formulation (ie, capsules filled with freeze-dried
FFT preparations without the need to conserve living
bacteria or spores). When contemplating the intersection
of successful therapies related to FMT (classic FMT, spores,
and FFT), it appears plausible that the active agent(s) of
any FMT therapy are not living bacteria, but rather bacte-
rial components, antimicrobial compounds of bacterial
origin (eg, bacteriocins), or bacteriophages contributing to
the normal intestinal microenvironment. These could be
common to all successful FMT therapies and even rather
unspecific
regarding
the
bacterial
strain(s)
used
for
therapies.
Another important observation is the fast resolution of
postinfectious clinical symptoms. Remaining diarrhea is a
common clinical problem after CDI and also after FMT in
CDI patients. In a significant percentage of patients, micro-
bial tests to detect recurrent infection or re-infection are
negative or inconclusive, pointing to postinfectious irritable
bowel syndrome.44 Both FMT and FFT appear to clear CDI,
but also resolve the diarrhea, as particularly shown by pa-
tient 2. This may suggest that such diarrhea is related to
remaining distortions of microbiome composition acting on
the human host’s mucosa and may point to a mechanistic
interaction of FMT/FFT with epithelial function and/or
motility that goes beyond the microbicidal effects of the
procedure.
An interesting shift of the microbial community struc-
tures of patients 3 and 4 was observed. In both of these
patients, expansion of the relative abundances of Proteo-
bacteria, mostly attributable to Escherichia species, was a
prominent component of the microbiome, which dis-
appeared within 1 week after FFT. In all 4 patients inves-
tigated
(Supplementary
Figures
1
and
2),
FFT
was
associated with a reduction of E coli and, in all but patient 2,
also with a reduction of unclassified Enterobacteriaceae.
This could suggest a potential for FFT to be applicable to
other diseases with Enterobacteriaceae-driven dysbiosis
such as inflammatory bowel diseases.
From our pilot study we cannot clearly define the exact
mechanism of action. In particular, it cannot be decided
whether the observed taxonomic shifts in the microbiota
promoted the clearance of C difficile or rather reflect the
resolution of disease with re-establishment of a health-
associated microbiome after transfer of the active agent(s)
from the donor. Two likely explanations include bacterial
cell wall components or DNA fragments, which could stim-
ulate host responses via pattern recognition receptors.45,46
This in turn may lead to an alteration of the ecologic
niches needed for outgrowth of existing beneficial bacteria
or even successful novel colonization. Our findings lend a
new interpretation to the results of a recent randomized,
controlled, double-blind clinical trial for FMT in CDI that
reported the frequently observed approximately 90% effi-
cacy of FMT, but also showed that autologous stool trans-
plantation was effective in more than 60% of patients.47 The
mechanism of efficacy of this procedure could be similar to
that of FFT.
Another plausible explanation is the transfer of bacte-
riophages, which may act on the community dynamics of
gut microbiota, thereby leading to a resolution of the
initial dysbiosis.31,48 In principle, this may be achieved by
transfer
of
virus
particles
(ie,
bacteriophages

 stricto) or by transfer of specific bacteria harboring
temperate phages in their genome, which may become
active in a distinct microenvironment or condition. Two
strong arguments for this hypothesis are provided by the
therapeutic efficacy of bacterial cultures and spores (see
earlier) and by our exemplary data showing that bacte-
riophages were detected in an FFT filtrate, which largely
reflected the composition of the stool phageome of the
donor. Moreover, some of these phages, which previously
were absent, still were detectable in the recipient 6 weeks
after therapy.
Future clinical studies and systematic microbiome and
virome analyses should investigate whether FFT also is effi-
cacious using filtrates of defined bacteria,28–30,43 in particular
in lyophilized formulations for oral administration.

 Supplementary Materials and Methods
Methods for Virome Analyses
Sample processing. Virus-like particle purification
and DNA extraction were performed as described previ-
ously,1 with some modifications. Fecal samples were
resuspended in 0.5 mL saline magnesium buffer and
centrifuged 4 times at 2500 � g for 10 minutes, with the
resulting supernatant passed sequentially through a 0.45-
mm and a 0.22-mm pore diameter filter (Whatman/GE
Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Each sample was treated
twice with 0.2 volumes of chloroform and centrifuged at
5000 � g for 10 minutes at 4�C. The aqueous phase was
treated with 1 U of DNase I and 70 mL of 10 � DNase buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 2 hours at room
temperature the first time, and overnight at room temper-
ature the second time. Enzyme activity was inactivated by
incubation at 65�C for 10 minutes.
To extract viral DNA, 0.1 volumes of 2 mol/L Tris-Cl/0.2
mol/L EDTA, 1 volume of formamide, 1 mL of glycogen, and
10 mL of a 0.5 mol/L EDTA solution were added per 1 mL
of sample. The sample subsequently was washed with 2
volumes of ethanol and centrifuged for 20 minutes at
13,800 � g at room temperature. The resulting pellet then
was washed twice with 70% ethanol and resuspended in
Tris-EDTA buffer followed by 10% SDS and 20 mg/mL
solution of Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at 37�C,
after
which
5
mol/L
NaCl
and
10%
cetyl-
trimethylammonium bromide/0.7 mol/L NaCl were added.
Samples then were mixed with an equal volume of chlo-
roform and centrifuged at 13,800 � g for 10 minutes at
room temperature. To the resulting supernatant, an equal
volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was
added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 13,800 � g for
10 minutes. The aqueous phase was recovered, an equal
volume of chloroform was added, and the resulting mixture
was centrifuged again at 13,800 � g for 10 minutes, before
adding 1 mL of glycogen with 0.7 volumes of isopropanol
and precipitating overnight at 4�C. The next morning,
samples were centrifuged at 13,800 � g for 30 minutes at
4�C, washed with 1 mL of 70% ethanol, air-dried, and
resuspended in 50 mL of nuclease-free water.
Library construction. Libraries were generated using
the TrueSeq Nano DNA kit (Illumina) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After quantification, normal-
ized pools of all samples were sequenced on an Illumina
MiSeq using the 2 � 150-bp sequencing kit (Illumina).
Quality
control
and
metagenomic
assembly.
Truseq adaptors and low-quality reads (length, <55) were
filtered from the Illumina paired-end reads (2 � 150 base)
using Trimmomatic version 0.33.2 These preprocessed
paired-end reads were assembled using the SPAdes version
3.7.0 assembler, by implementing the “meta” function with
a wide k-mer range of 21–77.3
Taxonomic assignment. The assembled contigs were
classified at various taxonomic levels using the k-mer-based
approach as described previously.4 In brief, reads were
subdivided into complete sets of 31-bp length-overlapping
sequences (k-mers). Subsequently, these k-mers were
compared against a large database (40,000 whole microbial
genomes in the One Codex reference database) that con-
tains information on known k-mers unique to specific
taxonomic groups such as different bacterial clades or vi-
ruses. After comparison, each contig was assigned to a
closely matched specific clade. Each sample then was
summarized as a group of signature sequences depicting
the presence of specific groups of organisms.4

Bradford protein assay. A protein assay (Bradford assay)
was performed using 10 mL of each of the 3 FFT filtrate
samples; the results from this test were below the limit of
detection for the assay.
SDS–polyacrylamide

electrophoresis
stack
gel. Aliquots of each sample (125 mL) were partially
lyophilized and resuspended up to a volume of approxi-
mately 55 mL in ultrapure water (Arium 611VF; Sartorius,
Göttingen, Germany). From each sample, 45 mL was trans-
ferred to a 500-mL centrifuge tube and 15 mL of Laemmli
loading buffer was added; the remainder, approximately
10–15 mL, was used for solid phase extraction. The samples
were heated at 95�C for 5 minutes and then loaded (20 mL
in triplicate) onto a 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel with a 4%
stacking gel. Constant voltage (40 V) was applied to migrate
the dye front into the stacking gel (15 min). Subsequently,
the voltage was increased to 100 V for a further 15 minutes.
The gel then was processed (fixed, washed, stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue, and destained) and visualized. The
triplicate protein-containing fractions of the gel were
excised for each sample. This resulted in the collection of 9
gel pieces of approximately 10 � 8 mm in size.

electro-
phoresis. The remaining 15 mL from each of the original
samples was mixed with 5 mL of Laemmli loading buffer and
heated at 95�C for 5 minutes before being loaded onto a
12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel. Con-
stant voltage (40 V) was applied to migrate the dye front
into the stacking gel (15 min). Subsequently, the voltage
was increased to 100 V for a further 80 minutes. The gel
then was processed (fixed, washed, stained with Coomassie
brilliant blue, and destained) and visualized to assess the
protein content of the samples. Four clearly visible protein
bands from the FFT filtrate used for patient 4 and 2 faint
bands from the duplicate FFT filtrates for patient 5 were
excised.
Solid phase extraction. Peptides and small proteins
from the remainder of resuspended samples (approxi-
mately 10–15 mL) were cleaned with a solution of 5%

 SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stack gel approach
were processed via a standard in-gel digestion protocol.
Briefly, the gel pieces were diced into small fragments
(approximately 1–2 mm3), destained, and dehydrated. The
samples were reduced (10 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 56�C, 60
min in 50 mmol/L triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer,
pH 8), alkylated (55 mmol/L iodoacetamide, room tem-
perature, 30 min in 50 mmol/L triethylammonium bicar-
bonate), and subjected to overnight trypsin digestion at
37�C in 50 mmol/L triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer,
pH 8, with 100 ng of sequencing-grade trypsin. The
resulting peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with
increasing concentrations of acetonitrile (60%, 100%) and
pooled with the supernatant from the overnight digestion,
dried down in an Eppendorf Concentrator plus (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany), and resuspended in high performance
liquid chromatography loading buffer (3% acetonitrile,
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for mass spectrometry analysis.
Liquid
chromatography–mass
spectrome-
try. Procedures for liquid chromatography. Chromato-
graphic separation was performed on a Dionex U3000
ultra-high
performance
liquid
chromatography
system
(Thermo Scientific Dionex, Idstein, Germany) equipped with
an Acclaim PepMap 100 analytic column (2 mm, 75 mm �
500 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online to a mass
spectrometer. The solvents used were as follows: buffer A
(0.05% formic acid), buffer B (80% acetonitrile þ 0.04%
formic acid). The separation was performed over a pro-
grammed 86-minute run. Initial chromatographic condi-
tions were 4% B for 2 minutes followed by a linear gradient
from 4% to 40% B over 60 minutes before a 6-minute in-
crease to 90% B and 3 minutes at 90% B. Subsequently, an
inter-run equilibration of the column was achieved by 12
minutes at 4% B. A flow rate of 300 nL/min was used, and 3
mL of sample was injected per run. Injection repeats were
performed for the stack gel-based samples.
Procedures for mass spectrometry. Acquisition runs
were performed on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spec-
trometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany) coupled
online to an ultra-high performance liquid chromatog-
raphy. Ionization was performed with 1.5-kV spray
voltage applied on a noncoated PicoTip emitter (10-mm
tip size; New Objective, Woburn, MA) and the source
temperature was set to 250�C. Mass spectrometry data
were acquired from 1 to 80 minutes with mass spec-
trometer full scans between 300 and 2000 m/z at a res-
olution of 70,000 at m/z 400 (automatic gain control
target of 3e6; maximum injection time of 100 ms). For
each sample, independent liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry experiments were performed with the
following settings: the 10 most intense precursors with
charge states �2þ were subjected to fragmentation with
higher-energy collisional dissociation (Fourier transform
mass spectrometer; normalized collision energy of 27.5%;
isolation width of 3 m/z; resolution, 17,500 at m/z 400;
automatic gain control target of 1e5 and maximum
injection time of 100 ms), dynamic exclusion for 20
seconds
was
applied
with
lockmass
correction
(445.120025 m/z).
Database searching and statistical validation. Mass
spectrometry data were searched against a protein fasta
database that contained all canonical human proteins, all
bacterial taxonomy canonical reviewed proteins, all fungal
canonical reviewed proteins, as well as common contami-
nant proteins listed in the common repository of adventi-
tious proteins (cRAP). All protein fasta databases were
downloaded from UniProtKB (access date: February 15,
2016). Database searches were performed with Proteome
Discoverer 1.4.0.288 using the search algorithm SequestHT
(both from Thermo Fisher). For in-gel digested samples,
enzyme settings were trypsin (full) with a maximum of 2
missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine thiol
groups was set as a static modification, and oxidation of
methionine was set as a variable modification. For the 3
solid-phase extraction searches, no enzyme was specified,
and oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modifi-
cation. For all searches, precursor mass tolerance was 7
ppm and fragment mass tolerances were 0.02 Daltons.
Peptide spectrum match validation was performed by
Percolator (default values). Protein and peptide lists were
exported as text files using only high confident matches
with a false discovery rate of 0.01 or less, minimum of 1
unique peptide per protein.
In
classic
fecal
metaproteomics
studies,
databases
derived from metagenomic studies including predicted
proteins often are used for protein identification.5 In addi-
tion, steps to enrich bacterial fractions commonly are used
to reduce the dominance of host/food proteins, which then
allows for the identification of bacterial proteins.6 Because
of the total protein amounts and high complexity (in terms
of numbers of detectable bacterial proteins), the use of
databases derived from metagenomic studies, including
predicted proteins, clearly is justified to allow deeper
coverage of the bacterial (meta)proteome. In our study, we
analyzed the free (extracellular) proteins from within the
filtered aqueous extract; this, a priori, prevents the enrich-
ment of bacterial proteins. Because the protein concentra-
tion in the extract was very low, with the exception of the
few higher abundant proteins (see earlier), the obtained
mass spectra were generally of low quality. By using a strict
identification pipeline, the majority of the signals acquired
with
sufficient
intensities
that
provided
interpretable
spectra could be assigned to protein identities using the
annotated nonredundant database encompassing more than
282,000 bacterial, 20,000 human, and 28,000 fungal protein
sequences. The identified proteins were mapped against
previously validated proteins, thus providing the highest
possible confidence in their identification when applying
strict criteria (at least 2 independent peptides with 1
unique peptide) as performed herein.
