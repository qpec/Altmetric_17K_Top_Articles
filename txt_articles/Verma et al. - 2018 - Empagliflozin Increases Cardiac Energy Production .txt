HIGHLIGHTS
�
This study evaluated cardiac energy
production and bioenergetics in an
experimental model of diabetes treated
with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin.
�
Rates of glucose oxidation, fatty acid
oxidation, ketone oxidation, glycolysis,
and cardiac function were measured in
diabetic (db/db) mice treated with or
without empagliflozin.
�
Rates of glucose and ketone oxidation in
the hearts of untreated db/db mice were
markedly decreased, whereas fatty acid
oxidation was increased with a significant
overall reduction in cardiac ATP
production compared to nondiabetic mice.
�
Empagliflozin treatment increased overall
cardiac ATP production by w30% and
prevented cardiac failure; this effect was
due to an increase in the rate of glucose
and fatty acid oxidation, but with no a
change in the rate of ketone oxidation.
�
The authors conclude that the SGLT2
inhibitor empagliflozin enhances the
cardiac energy pool by increasing cardiac
energy production from glucose and fatty
acid oxidation, but not ketone oxidation.

 SUMMARY
SGLT2 inhibitors have profound benefits on reducing heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, although the mechanism(s) of this benefit remain poorly understood. Because changes in
cardiac bioenergetics play a critical role in the pathophysiology of heart failure, the authors evaluated cardiac
energy production and substrate use in diabetic mice treated with the SGTL2 inhibitor, empagliflozin. Empa-
gliflozin treatment of diabetic db/db mice prevented the development of cardiac failure. Glycolysis, and the
oxidation of glucose, fatty acids and ketones were measured in the isolated working heart perfused with 5
mmol/l glucose, 0.8 mmol/l palmitate, 0.5 mmol/l ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßOHB), and 500 mU/ml insulin. In
vehicle-treated db/db mice, cardiac glucose oxidation rates were decreased by 61%, compared with control
mice, but only by 43% in empagliflozin-treated diabetic mice. Interestingly, cardiac ketone oxidation rates in
db/db mice decreased to 45% of the rates seen in control mice, whereas a similar decrease (43%) was seen in
empagliflozin-treated db/db mice. Overall cardiac adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production rates decreased by
36% in db/db vehicle-treated hearts compared with control mice, with fatty acid oxidation providing 42%,
glucose oxidation 26%, ketone oxidation 10%, and glycolysis 22% of ATP production in db/db mouse hearts. In
empagliflozin-treated db/db mice, cardiac ATP production rates increased by 31% compared with db/db vehicle-
treated mice, primarily due to a 61% increase in the contribution of glucose oxidation to energy production.
Cardiac efficiency (cardiac work/O2 consumed) decreased by 28% in db/db vehicle-treated hearts, compared
with control hearts, and empagliflozin did not increase cardiac efficiency per se. Because ketone oxidation was
impaired in db/db mouse hearts, the authors determined whether this contributed to the decrease in cardiac
efficiency seen in the db/db mouse hearts. Addition of 600 mmol/l ßOHB to db/db mouse hearts perfused
with 5 mmol/l glucose, 0.8 mmol/l palmitate, and 100 mU/ml insulin increased ketone oxidation rates,
but did not decrease either glucose oxidation or fatty acid oxidation rates. The presence of ketones did not
increase cardiac efficiency, but did increase ATP production rates, due to the additional contribution
of ketone oxidation to energy production. The authors conclude that empagliflozin treatment is
associated with an increase in ATP production, resulting in an enhanced energy status of the heart.

S
GLT2 inhibitors are antihyperglycemic agents
that have profound and precocious effects on
the prevention of heart failure and cardiovas-
cular mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes
who are at high cardiovascular risk (1–6). In 2 recently
completed
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration–
mandated
cardiovascular
outcome
studies,
the
SGLT2
inhibitors
empagliflozin
and
canagliflozin
were associated with an w35% reduction in the rates
of hospitalization for heart failure in participants with
either established cardiovascular disease or with car-
diovascular risk factors. Importantly, the benefits of
empagliflozin
and
canagliflozin
therapy
emerged
almost immediately, with very rapid separation of
the Kaplan-Meier curves for both hospitalization for
heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Although
various
mechanisms
have
been
suggested
(7–11),
including
osmotic
diuresis
and
natriuresis,
the
potential impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiac bioen-
ergetics has not been reported.
Alterations in myocardial substrate use and cardiac
energy production play a critical role in the patho-
physiology of heart failure (12–19). To fulfill the
exceptional metabolic demands, the myocardium is
capable of incredible metabolic flexibility and can use
a variety of energy substrates such as fatty acids,
glucose, ketone bodies, and amino acids for the gen-
eration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Marked and

SGLT2 Inhibition and Cardiac Bioenergetics in Diabetes

 aberrant changes in metabolic flexibility and sub-
strate use play an early and permissive role in the
development of heart failure and are believed to
promote adverse remodeling and progression to se-
vere heart failure in both experimental and clinical
settings (12,13,20).
It has been hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibitors
may prevent heart failure through improving ATP
generation
from
ketone
body
oxidation,
thereby
enhancing
cardiac
efficiency
(cardiac
work/O2
consumed) (21,22). However, this hypothesis remains
controversial (23), and to date, no cogent evidence to
support this proposed beneficial mechanism has been
provided. Because SGLT2 inhibitors are known to in-
crease the production of ketone bodies (such as
b-hydroxybutyrate [ßOHB]), it has been suggested
that an increase in myocardial ketone body oxidation
may serve to improve cardiac ATP production as a
preferred substrate to fatty acids or glucose in the
diabetic heart. Whereas ketone bodies have been
shown to be a source of energy supply in the hyper-
trophied failing heart (24), the relationship that exists
between
ketone
bodies,
glucose,
and
fatty
acid
oxidation in the
diabetic heart remains unclear,
particularly as it relates to SGLT2 inhibition.
We sought to shed light on the potential effects of
SGLT2 inhibitors on myocardial energetics and energy
substrate use. Mouse surrogates for diabetes (db/db
mice) were treated with 10 mg/kg/day empagliflozin
or the vehicle for 4 weeks before the rates of glycol-
ysis, fatty acid, glucose, and ketone oxidation were
evaluated in isolated perfused working hearts har-
vested from these mice.
METHODS
EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS. The experimental proced-
ures described herein were approved by the Univer-
sity of Alberta Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and conform to the guidelines of the
Canadian Council of Animal Care. At 18 weeks of
age, male db/db (Leprdb/J, The Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, Maine) mice were treated with either
empagliflozin (10 mg/kg/day via their food) or the
vehicle for 4 weeks. Concomitantly, 20-week-old
male C57BL/6J mice were treated for 4 weeks with the
vehicle via their food.
A separate group of C57BL/6J and db/db mice was
treated with a single 10 mg/kg dose of empagliflozin
via oral gavage before being subjected to a 24-h fast.
Lastly, 23-week-old naive male db/db mice were
used to study the short-term effects of ketones on the
db/db mouse heart.
TRANSTHORACIC
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. The
cardiac
function of anesthetized (3% isoflurane) mice was
assessed with a Vevo 3100 high-resolution imaging
system that was coupled to a 30-MHz transducer
(RMV-707B; VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada). Systolic
and diastolic parameters were assessed as previously
described (25).
BLOOD
METABOLITE
LEVELS. For
both
fed
and
fasted protocols, total plasma ketones levels were
measured using a 2-part kit from Wako Diagnostics
(Cat: 415-73301 and 411-73491, Wako Diagnostics,
Mountain
View,
California),
blood
glucose
levels
were measured using a glucometer, and plasma fatty
acid levels were measured using a kit from Roche
(Cat: 11383175001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
ISOLATED WORKING HEART PERFUSION. Male 22-week
to 23-week-old db/db mice and age-matched control
C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed with sodium pento-
barbital after their hearts were excised and blood
collected
for
plasma
isolation.
The
hearts
were
perfused for 60 min in the isolated working mode as
previously described (26) with Krebs-Henseleit solu-
tion containing 2.5 mmol/l Ca2þ, 5 mmol/l [5-3H/
U-14C]glucose, 0.8 mmol/l palmitate (pre-bound to 3%
albumin), and 500 mmol/l bOHB in the presence or
absence of 500 mU/ml insulin. A second set of hearts
were perfused under identical conditions, but with 5
mmol/l glucose, 0.8 mmol/l [9,10-3H]palmitate (pre-
bound to 3% albumin), and 500 mmol/l [3-14C]bOHB.
To study the short-term effect of ketones on the
hearts from db/db mice, these hearts were acutely
perfused in the absence or presence of 600 mmol/l b-
OHB. At the end of the perfusion protocol, the left
ventricles were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and
stored at �80�C.
IMMUNOBLOTTING. Frozen
left
ventricular
(LV)
tissue samples (30 mg) were homogenized, resolved
by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose.
The membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk
for 1 h before being probed with primary antibodies
that included: anti–acetyl-lysine (Millipore, AB3879,
MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, Missouri), anti–b-hydrox-
yacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (bHAD) (ab37673, Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom), anti–long-chain-acyl-
CoA-dehydrogenase (LCAD) (ab129711, Abcam), anti–
pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) (2784, Cell Signaling
Technology,
Danvers,
Massachusetts),
and
anti–

were
pre-cleared with 20 ml of protein A/G agarose beads,
incubated overnight at 4�C with anti–acetyl lysine
(2 ml/300 mg lysate, EMD Millipore, catalog AB3879;
MilliporeSigma) before the acetylated proteins were
pulled down with A/G agarose beads (15). The heavy
chain of IgG was used as the loading control.

 were
significantly
lighter
than
the
db/db
mice
(Figure 1A). Empagliflozin treatment did not appre-
ciably affect the weights of db/db mice. Ventricular
mass, a surrogate measurement of hypertrophy, was
higher for vehicle-treated db/db mice relative to that
for C57BL/6J mice. As shown in Figure 1B, mean
ventricular mass for empagliflozin-treated db/db mice
was lower than that for vehicle-treated db/db mice
and comparable to that for C57BL/6J mice. Empagli-
flozin significantly lowered fasting blood glucose
levels (Table 1). Although plasma ketone levels in the
vehicle-treated fed and fasted db/db mice were not
different from those of the C57BL/6J mice, signifi-
cantly higher levels of fed and fasted ketone levels
were detected in the empagliflozin-treated db/db
mice (Table 1). Free fatty acid levels, generally higher
in db/db mice relative to C57BL/6J mice, were unaf-
fected by empagliflozin treatment (Table 1).
Cardiac function, as measured in the isolated
working heart model, was significantly compromised
in the hearts of db/db mice when compared with that
of hearts from C57BL/6J mice (Figures 1C and 1D). This
agrees with previous reports (28,29). Of note, the
cardiac function of hearts from empagliflozin-treated
db/db mice was significantly improved compared
with db/db vehicle-treated mice. The differences in
cardiac
function
between
the
empagliflozin-
and
vehicle-treated db/db mice were not as dramatic
when assessed by in vivo echocardiography and
did not have a significant impact on individual LV
dimensions (Table 1).

rates
in

rate, in the presence of insulin, in the hearts of
empagliflozin-treated
db/db
mice
was
133%
that
of hearts from C57BL/6J mice (Figure 2A). Conversely,
glucose oxidation rates in the hearts of vehicle-
treated db/db mice, in the presence and absence of
insulin, were significantly lower compared with those
of hearts from C57BL/6J mice (Figure 2B). Although
the presence of insulin increased glucose oxidation in
the hearts of C57BL/6J mice, the insulin-associated
effect was absent in hearts from db/db mice, which
is consistent with the presence of cardiac insulin
resistance (28,29). Glycolysis rates measured in the
presence of insulin were lower in the empagliflozin-
treated db/db mouse hearts compared with C57BL/6J
hearts (Figure 2C). As shown in Figure 2D, the mean
cardiac ketone oxidation rate in the hearts of db/db
mice was approximately 43% lower than that for
hearts from C57BL/6J mice (Figure 2D). Notably,
this outcome was apparent regardless of whether in-
sulin was present or not. Of further interest is the
observation that empagliflozin had no influence on
the ketone oxidation rates of hearts from db/db mice
(Figure 2D).
Overall cardiac ATP production rates in the hearts
of vehicle-treated db/db mice were 36% lower than
those measured in the C57BL/6J mice, with fatty
acid oxidation providing 42%, glucose oxidation 26%,
ketone oxidation 10%, and glycolysis 22% of energy
production in the presence of insulin (Figure 2E). In
empagliflozin-treated db/db mice, cardiac ATP pro-
duction rates increased by 31%, such that they were
restored to levels similar to those measured for the
hearts from C57BL/6J mice (Figure 2E).

ADDITION

KETONES
ADDS
AN
ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF ATP PRODUCTION, BUT
DOES NOT IMPROVE CARDIAC EFFICIENCY IN THE
DIABETIC MOUSE HEART. Given that empagliflozin
has been shown to increase circulating blood ketone
levels and that the “thrifty” fuel hypothesis suggests
that ketones may be responsible for the cardiovas-
cular benefits observed with empagliflozin (21,22),
we conducted studies to determine whether the ex
vivo addition of ketones to db/db mice hearts would
improve
cardiac
energetic
status
and
efficiency.
In db/db mice treated with 600 mmol/l bOHB, there
was an insulin-dependent increase in glucose oxida-
tion, accompanied with a drop in palmitate oxidation
(Figures 3A and 3B). The addition of 600 mmol/l bOHB
to isolated perfused hearts from db/db mice did
not affect palmitate oxidation, glucose oxidation,
or glycolysis (Figures 3A and 3C). However, addition
of bOHB
resulted
in
increased
ketone
oxidation
(Figure
3D),
which
was
independent
of
insulin.
Interestingly, the addition of bOHB increased total
energy (ATP) production (Figure 3E) without impair-
ing
glucose
oxidation
or
exhibiting
any
sort
of significant substrate competition. However, the
additional presence of ketones, representing only a
few percent of total calories from available fuels, did
not result in an increase in cardiac efficiency and
cardiac work in the hearts of db/db mice (Figure 3F,
Supplemental Figure 1).

is
the

levels of PDH were significantly higher in the hearts
of vehicle-treated db/db mice relative to those in the
hearts of vehicle-treated C57BL/6 mice. Notably, PDH
levels in the hearts of db/db mice were unaffected by
empagliflozin treatment (Figure 4A). The phosphory-
lation and deactivation of PDH on serine residue 293
and the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
4 (PDK4) were similar across the 3 groups of mice
studied (Figures 4B and 4C). Cardiac protein expres-
sion of LCAD and b-HAD were significantly increased
in db/db mice treated with vehicle, whereas empa-
gliflozin treatment in db/db mice did not result in
altered expression (Figures 4D and 4E). We also
looked at cardiac acetylation because an increase in
acetylation is positively associated with increased
fatty acid oxidation (15,30). Total acetylation signifi-
cantly increased in db/db mice, although this was not
significantly different in empagliflozin-treated db/db
mice (Figures 4F and 4G). Lysine acetylation of PDH,
LCAD, and b-HAD were also not significantly different
between the groups (Figures 4H and 4J). Malonyl CoA,
a
known
inhibitor
of
fatty
acid
oxidation
(31),
was significantly higher in db/db mice treated with
vehicle compared with C57BL/6J, although this was
not altered with empagliflozin treatment (12.3 �
0.8 nmol/g dry weight in C57BL/6J, 17.9 � 1.6 nmol/g
dry weight in the hearts of vehicle-treated db/db
mice, and 16.8 � 1.6 nmol/g dry weight in the hearts
from empagliflozin-treated db/db mice).
DISCUSSION
The current study was undertaken to characterize the
effects of empagliflozin on myocardial energetics and
substrate use in diabetes with the specific aim of
determining if the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the
prevention
of
heart
failure
are
related
to
improvements in cardiac energy production. Several
important
and
translational
insights
have
been
gained in this regard. First and foremost, as has been
shown previously, we observed that the decline in
cardiac function in db/db mice was associated with a
reduction in cardiac ATP production. This was due to
a combined decrease in glucose oxidation and fatty
acid oxidation rates (17). We also provide the novel
observation that ketone oxidation is dramatically
inhibited in the db/db mouse heart, contributing to
the decrease in ATP production in these hearts. It
is well known that in diabetes, decreased insulin
stimulation of glucose oxidation in the failing heart
contributes to both an impairment of heart efficiency
and the development of cardiac failure (12,17–19). In
support of this concept, we have demonstrated that
the low glucose oxidation rates in the db/db mouse
hearts was accompanied by a decrease in cardiac
efficiency. We also observed that compared with the
hearts of C57BL/6J mice, db/db mouse hearts had an
w36% reduction in cardiac ATP production, with fatty
acid oxidation providing 42%, glucose oxidation 26%,
ketone oxidation 10%, and glycolysis 22% of total
ATP production. By contrast, in empagliflozin-treated
db/db mice, cardiac ATP production rates increased
by 31% compared with vehicle-treated db/db mice.
This was not accompanied by a significant change in
overall cardiac efficiency, suggesting that the cardiac
benefits associated with empagliflozin were associ-
ated with an increase in cardiac ATP production.
Furthermore,
when
db/db
mouse
hearts
were
perfused with higher ketone levels (which was seen
in vivo with empagliflozin treatment), overall cardiac
ATP
production
was
increased,
supporting
the

 concept that the beneficial effects of empagliflozin
are associated with an increased ATP production in
the heart.
Of note, rates of ketone oxidation were markedly
depressed in db/db mouse hearts. Intriguingly, this
phenomenon did not seem to be responsible for the
observed
decrease
in
cardiac
efficiency
because
infusion of db/db hearts with bOHB did not change
the rates of either glucose or fatty acid oxidation.
Importantly, exogenous bOHB infusion was associ-
ated with an overall increase in ATP production in
db/db mouse hearts, not through changes in glucose
or fatty acid oxidation, but rather via an independent
increase in ATP production through ketone oxidation.
Finally, empagliflozin treatment did not affect the
rates of ketone oxidation in db/db hearts. Taken
together,
these
data
suggest
that
empagliflozin
treatment is associated with an increase in overall

 cardiac ATP production, largely through a mechanism
of
increased
glucose
oxidation
and
fatty
acid
oxidation versus changes in glycolysis, or rates of
ketone oxidation. Whereas empagliflozin does not
alter rates of myocardial ketone oxidation per se,
it is plausible that an increase in serum ketone bodies
that occurs with empagliflozin may serve as an
additional source of cardiac ATP production without
changing/inhibiting rates of glucose or fatty acid
oxidation.
A decrease in the glucose oxidation contribution to
ATP production was evident in the db/db mouse
hearts. The decrease in glucose oxidation did not
appear to be due to an increase phosphorylation and
inhibition
of
PDH,
the
rate-limiting
enzyme
for
glucose oxidation (Figure 4B). The decreased glucose
oxidation was also not the result of an increased
acetylation of PDH (Figure 4H) (which inhibits PDH
[32] and glucose oxidation). Rather, it appears the
decrease in glucose oxidation observed in db/db
mouse hearts was due to an increased expression of
fatty acid oxidative enzymes (Figures 4D and 4E),
which would decrease glucose oxidation secondary to
an increase in fatty acid oxidation (i.e., the Randle
Cycle
[33]).
Interestingly,
the
permissive
effect
empagliflozin exerts on ATP production from glucose
oxidation did not appear to result from altered fatty
acid oxidation enzyme expression in db/db mouse
hearts.
In addition to the changes in myocardial ener-
getics noted in this study, various other mechanisms
by which SGLT2 inhibition confers cardiovascular
benefits have been suggested (7,8,34). These include
indirect effects to improve filling conditions, through
a reduction in preload and afterload, effects on
attenuating
the
expression
of
cardiac
sodium-
hydrogen exchanger (NHE) (7,8,34,35), changes in
adipokines,
inflammatory
biomarkers,
natriuretic
peptides, and epicardial adipose tissue volume (7).
Importantly,
the
benefits
empagliflozin
exert
on
cardiac function appear to be independent of hyper-
glycemia. In animal models of heart failure that do
not factor in diabetes (induced by transverse aortic
constriction), empagliflozin has been reported to
prevent the decline in ejection fraction (11). In this
study, the benefits of empagliflozin were observed in
addition to extrinsic factors that regulate cardiac
function, such as hemodynamics and ketone oxida-
tion, because these benefits were observed in the
setting of matching preload and afterload, and in the
presence of similar concentrations of insulin, fatty
acids, glucose, or ketones. These data suggest that
outcomes mediated by empagliflozin may be over
and
above
indirect
hemodynamic
effects,

 hypothesis that is supported by our current study
demonstrating an effect to improve overall cardiac
ATP generation through increases in rates of glucose
oxidation. Recent data suggest that empagliflozin
may inhibit myocardial NHE activity (36), in part
through binding with the extracellular domain of
NHE. In addition to reducing intracellular sodium
and calcium, inhibition of NHE has been suggested to
exhibit a protective effect on mitochondrial function,
attenuating
mitochondrial

and
improving

function (37).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, we did not include an
empagliflozin-treated C57BL/6J group because our
primary focus was on the effects of empagliflozin in a
diabetic setting. In future studies, the addition of an
empagliflozin-treated C57BL/6J group would help
assess
whether
empagliflozin
increases
cardiac
glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation in a model
in which glucose oxidation is not suppressed as in the
db/db mouse heart. Second, we also did not include a
C57BL/6J
group
in
the
ex
vivo
ketone
study.
Accordingly, it would be important in future in-
vestigations to investigate the short-term effect of
ketones in a healthy heart. Third, we used 5 mmol/l
of glucose in the diabetic mouse heart perfusions.
This is subphysiological in a diabetic setting. How-
ever, 5 mmol/l glucose is within the normal glucose
levels
for
both
the
healthy
model
and
an
empagliflozin-treated model, and was maintained
throughout all groups for consistency. Finally, the
concentration of insulin added to the ex vivo heart
buffer 30 min after the initiation of perfusion was
lower in the ex vivo ketone study versus the chronic
empagliflozin
feeding
study,
which
should
be
considered when making comparisons between these
2 studies.
CONCLUSIONS
The present study provides important translational
clues on the effects of empagliflozin on cardiac
energetics in experimental diabetes. We conclude
that the salutatory effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on
cardiac failure may be, in part, due to an increase in
cardiac ATP production via an increase in rates of
cardiac oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, and
increased supply and oxidation of ketones by the
heart. We observed that overall rates of ketone
oxidation were dramatically depressed in experi-
mental
diabetes,
and
remained
unchanged
with
empagliflozin treatment, but could be increased by
increasing ketone supply to the heart. This suggests
that
the
ability
of
empagliflozin
to
increase
circulating ketone levels may provide the heart with
an additional source of energy to sustain contractile
function.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
Although SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce
the rates of heart failure hospitalizations in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, the underlying mechanisms by
which these benefits occur remain unclear. Cardiac
failure is characterized by changes in myocardial fuel
metabolism and bioenergetics, and changes in sub-
strate use have been demonstrated to play a causal
and permissive role in the development and natural
history of heart failure. There has been a growing in-
terest in the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitors improve
cardiac function through an effect on cardiac energy
production, in part through increasing ketone body
production/oxidation. To this aim, the present study
provides a characterization of the cardiac energetics
and fuel metabolic flux in an experimental model of
diabetes treated with and without the SGLT2 inhibitor,
empagliflozin.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: We observed that
experimental diabetes led to a decrease in cardiac
function, coincident with a reduction in overall cardiac
ATP production. This was due to a reduction in rates of
glucose and ketone oxidation, with a concomitant in-
crease in fatty acid oxidation. Empagliflozin treatment
prevented the decrease in cardiac function and
increased cardiac ATP production without changing
overall cardiac efficiency. This increase in cardiac en-
ergy production was ascribed to a combined increase
in glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation rates,
without changes in the rates of glycolysis or ketone
oxidation. However, increasing ketone supply to the
heart may also contribute to the beneficial effects of
empagliflozin on increasing cardiac ATP production.
These data provide translational clues as to how
SGLT2 inhibitors may prevent cardiac failure, through
augmenting glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Contrary
to prior hypotheses, increased rates of cardiac ATP
production, as opposed to increased cardiac effi-
ciency, may explain the beneficial effects of SGLT2
inhibitors on improving cardiac function in diabetes.
