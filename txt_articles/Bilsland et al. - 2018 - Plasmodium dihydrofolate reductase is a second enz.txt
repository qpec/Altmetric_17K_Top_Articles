Malaria, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, leads to over half a million deaths per year, 
90% of which are caused by Plasmodium falciparum. P. vivax usually causes milder forms of malaria; 
however, P. vivax can remain dormant in the livers of infected patients for weeks or years before re-
emerging in a new bout of the disease. The only drugs available that target all stages of the parasite 
can lead to severe side effects in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; 
hence, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs active against blood and liver stages of the 
parasite. Different groups have demonstrated that triclosan, a common antibacterial agent, targets 
the Plasmodium liver enzyme enoyl reductase. Here, we provide 4 independent lines of evidence 
demonstrating that triclosan specifically targets both wild-type and pyrimethamine-resistant P. 
falciparum and P. vivax dihydrofolate reductases, classic targets for the blood stage of the parasite. This 
makes triclosan an exciting candidate for further development as a dual specificity antimalarial, which 
could target both liver and blood stages of the parasite.
Over half a million deaths per year result from malaria, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium. 
Approximately 90% of these deaths (generally of children in Africa) are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the 
parasite responsible for the most severe forms of the disease. However, Plasmodium vivax is the malaria parasite 
with the largest global distribution, threatening 2.5 billion people - mainly in South America and Asia1. Although 
P. vivax usually causes milder forms of malaria, it is still a killer2. Moreover, P. vivax can remain dormant in the 
livers of infected patients for weeks or years before re-emerging in a new bout of the disease3.
There is an urgent need to develop new anti-malarial drugs as resistance has arisen against all existing drugs4–
6, and there is no immediate prospect of an effective vaccine7. Primaquine is the only drug in use that targets all 
stages of the parasite. However, it greatly increases the risk of hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as does the promising new drug, tafenoquine1. G6PD deficiency is prevalent 
in areas where malaria is endemic since it offers some protection against infection8.
Triclosan is a simple antimicrobial agent that has been used for more than 40 years, and which is safe enough 
to be incorporated into consumer products from toothpastes to toys9,10. In 2001, it was reported that triclosan 
inhibits the in vitro propagation of P. falciparum11. Since then, triclosan and its analogs have been repeatedly 
shown to inhibit the growth of blood-stage P. falciparum in culture12–19. It was assumed that the mechanism of 
action of triclosan against Plasmodium was the same as that against bacteria - inhibition of enoyl reductase in 
the FAS-II11 fatty-acid synthesis pathway. Indeed, phenotypical, biochemical, structural evidence, and in silico 
simulations demonstrated that triclosan is a strong inhibitor of the P. falciparum enoyl reductase (PfENR)13,20,21. 
However Yu et al.20 showed convincingly that the FAS-II pathway is not important for the propagation of P.

falciparum in erythrocytes and so inhibition of PfENR cannot explain the effect of triclosan on blood-stage 
parasites.
Efforts to optimize the compound for use as an antimalarial showed no correlation between PfENR inhibition 
in vitro and triclosan’s activity against the living parasite21,22. Since it has been demonstrated that PfENR is impor-
tant for the liver stage of the parasite, but not for the erythrocyte stage22,23, action against a different target must 
be responsible for triclosan’s inhibition of the growth of blood-stage P. falciparum.
We have developed an automated yeast-based assay for use in high-throughput screens for compounds that 
are selectively active against target enzymes from parasites24,25. Our assay is based on replacing yeast genes essen-
tial for growth, with coding sequences specifying orthologous proteins from either parasites or humans, making 
the strains dependent on the activity of the parasite or the human enzyme in order to grow25. These strains are 
then labeled with different fluorescent proteins and pooled to allow monitoring of the growth, in real time, of each 
strain in competition with the others.
We carried out growth competition experiments between 3 yeast strains dependent on a DHFR enzyme from 
P. falciparum, P. vivax, or the human DHFR (these three strains were differentiated from one another by each 
expressing either the fluorescent proteins mCherry, Venus, or Sapphire26,27). These competitions took place in 
single wells of microtiter trays, enabling a Robot Scientist to screen thousands of different compounds and iden-
tify candidates with no general cytotoxicity, but which inhibited the parasite target without affecting its human 
counterpart24,28.
Results and Discussion
Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate 
to tetrahydrofolate. This reaction is essential for the de novo synthesis of purines and certain amino acids, making 
DHFR essential for rapid growth, and is the target for the action of the important antimalarial drugs pyrimeth-
amine and proguanil. Employing our yeast-based high-throughput screening approach24, we screened the Johns 
Hopkins Library of FDA-approved compounds against yeast strains expressing human DHFR (HsDHFR), P. fal-
ciparum DHFR (PfDHFR), P. vivax DHFR (PvDHFR) as well as the pyrimethamine-resistant P. vivax and P. fal-
ciparum DHFRs (PvRdhfr and PfRdhfr)28. The automated screen identified triclosan (Eve ID 21658, JHU-10450) 
as a specific inhibitor of P. vivax and P. falciparum DHFRs, including the pyrimethamine-resistant variants of the 
two enzymes. The Robot Scientist Eve prepared titration experiments with 1 to 20 μ
M of triclosan and successfully 
confirmed the hits. We prepared serial dilutions of yeast cultures expressing the human or Plasmodium DHFRs 
and spotted those onto agar plates containing 10 μ
M of triclosan, further confirming the specificity of the drug 
for the parasite target (Fig. 1).
We expressed the human and P. vivax DHFRs in E. coli, and purified the proteins using methotrexate affinity 
columns. We then performed in vitro enzyme assays and observed that the P. vivax DHFR is >20×
 more sensitive 
to triclosan (IC50 of 775 ± 384 nM) than the human enzyme (IC50 of 17.2 ± 4.9 μ
M) (Fig. 2).
To further validate DHFR as a target of triclosan in Plasmodium, we transfected blood-stage P. falciparum 
NF54 with a plasmid expressing the human DHFR enzyme (HsDHFR). If the blood-stage target of triclosan is 
indeed the Plasmodium DHFR, expression of HsDHFR (which our yeast and in vitro assays showed to be resistant 
to triclosan) should protect the parasite against the compound.
We found that our transfected Plasmodium strain was more tolerant to exposure to triclosan than the wild 
type (Fig. 3), consistent with DHFR being the compound’s target when the parasite is within the erythrocyte. 
The difference in the rate of progression of the parasitemia in wild-type and transfected strains was compared 
at a range of triclosan concentrations and found to be statistically significant (SEM). It should be noted that, in 
contrast to the in vitro enzyme inhibition kinetics, those for growth inhibition are complex. This is likely to be due 
to the fact that our parasite lines have been transfected with episomal constructs bearing the coding sequence for 
human DHFR. The resulting range of plasmid copy numbers would result in differences in the levels of human 
DHFR between individual Plasmodium cells in the population29. The consequence is that a considerable propor-
tion of cells do not express human DHFR at levels that are sufficiently high to confer drug resistance.

sapiens DHFR (yHsDHFR), Plasmodium falciparum wild-type DHFR (yPfDHFR), pyrimethamine-resistant 
P. falciparum DHFR (yPfRdhfr), or P. vivax DHFR were cultivated overnight and dilutions 5, 25, 125, 625 and 
spotted onto YNB-glucose-agar plates containing 0 or 10 μ
M irgasan (triclosan).

Finally, triclosan was docked into the X-ray structures of human and Plasmodium DHFRs (Fig. 4). Although 
triclosan displayed slightly altered binding poses in the different parasitic DHFRs, the inhibitor showed the 
same interactions with all four DHFRs, indicating comparable affinity (binding free energies in the range −
7.24 
and −
7.56 kcal/mol). In contrast, triclosan was not interacting with the HsDHFR through hydrogen bonding, 
resulting in reduced affinity (∆G = −
6.57 kcal/mol) and supporting the contention that triclosan discriminates 
between the Plasmodium and human enzymes.
DHFR inhibitors are routinely used as prophylactic drugs and are given to over a million children during 
the malaria season. However, DHFR inhibitors are no longer a standard treatment for the disease because of the 
evolution of drug-resistant variants of Plasmodium. Extensive efforts to discover a DHFR-targeted antimalarial 
that is effective against pyrimethamine-resistant strains have yet to produce a clinically approved entity, thus a 
novel Triclosan-derived compound with activity against drug-resistant forms of DHFR is of high potential value.
The presence of triclosan in consumer products in concentrations 2500-fold above the present IC50
30, suggests 
that it can be administered in quantity and short-term toxicity effects can be disregarded, notwithstanding pos-
sible long-term hazards31. This tolerance is important, as delivering effective concentrations in vivo may be chal-
lenging since data on the effect of administering triclosan to mice infected with P.berghei are contradictory11,18, 
with sub-cutaneous delivery being more effective than oral administration18. It may be that further engineering of 
triclosan by synthetic chemistry is necessary to improve delivery and half-life, but with regard to affinity triclosan 
is a viable non-toxic lead with a mechanism based on hitherto undiscovered selectivity. A number of triclosan 
analogs have already been synthesized16,21, demonstrating the ample opportunity for its improvement for use as 
an antimalarial.
In this work, we have provided four different lines of evidence (screens using recombinant yeast strains, 
enzyme assays, growth assays with blood-stage Plasmodium, and in silico simulations of drug-enzyme interac-
tions) demonstrating that triclosan specifically targets the DHFR enzyme of both P. vivax and P. falciparum, 
and that it is capable of selectively inhibiting both the wild-type and pyrimethamine-resistant enzymes com-
pared to human DHFR. Our conclusion that triclosan targets Plasmodium DHFR also explains much of the 
inconsistency in the literature regarding the efficacy of triclosan22: HsDHFR is commonly used as a Plasmodium 
selective marker as it provides pyrimethamine resistance, and controls for this confounding factor are not always 
performed.
Figure 2. Triclosan inhibits Plasmodium DHFR in vitro. (A) DHFR catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate 
(DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), coupled with the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
(NADPH). This reaction was followed for HsDHFR and PvDHFR in the absence (blue) or presence (red) 
of 100 µM Triclosan at 340 nm. (B) Initial rates of reaction were determined and used to derive IC50 values, 
with the standard deviation calculated from multiple kinetic runs (n = 3). To deal with variations in enzyme 
activity in different preparations, kinetic data were normalized as relative activities and fitted to % activity = %

Given the earlier evidence that triclosan inhibits ENR, it may be that triclosan is an example of “polyphar-
macology”32, poised for multitarget therapies. The totality of data on this compound suggests that it is capable of 
inhibiting blood-stage Plasmodium, via its action against DHFR, and the liver stage of the parasite, via the inhi-
bition of a key enzyme in fatty-acid synthesis20. Interestingly, polyphenol compounds such as epigallocathechin 
gallate (EGCG), also inhibit fatty acid synthesis and have antiplasmodial activity33, and have demonstrated anti-
folate activity34. Given the recent success in developing drug candidates with multi-stage activity35, it is realistic 
to envision the development of a new dual-action drug, based on triclosan, that is effective against both the blood 
and liver stages of wild-type and pyrimethamine-resistant Plasmodium species. The fact that triclosan has two 
distinct enzyme targets in different domains of metabolism may militate against the development of resistance. 
All of this engenders the hope that our discovery of a second enzyme target for triclosan may prove to be the first 
step in the development of a novel class of antimalarials.
Methods
Yeast strains and fluorescent plasmids. 
All yeast strains and marker plasmids used in this work are 
described in Bilsland et al.24,25. Briefly: plasmids, bearing genes for the expression of fluorescent proteins, were 
constructed by replacing the coding region of yEmRFP from yEpGAP-Cherry with Venus or Sapphire, and 
replacing the URA3 marker with LEU2. These three fluorescent proteins have very distinct excitation and emis-
sion wavelengths: mCherry (λ
ex 580 nm; λ
em 612 nm), Sapphire (λ
ex 405 nm; λ
em 510 nm) and Venus (λ
ex 500 nm; 
λ
em 540 nm).
A strain expressing the drug-resistant P. vivax DHFR (yPvRdhfr) was constructed by making the following 
site-directed mutations in the coding sequence for the P. vivax enzyme: S58R, S117N and I173L. This plasmid 
was transformed into dfr1Δ
/DFR1 a yeast strain with the BY4743 genetic background. The strain was sporulated 
and MATα
 haploids were selected and used in drug screens. The drug-resistant yPfRdhfr strain, which is a triple 
mutant for residues N51I, C59R, and S108N, was generated in a similar manner.
Library-screening assays and hit confirmation using the Robot Scientist Eve. 
Automated screens 
were performed as described in Williams et al.28. Starter cultures of individual strains, labeled with different 
fluorescent proteins, were grown to stationary phase in YNB-glucose (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino 
acids, 2% ammonium sulphate and 2% glucose) with the appropriate auxotrophic supplements. An aliquot (1 mL) 
of each pre-culture was inoculated into 100 mL of fresh medium. Pools of three strains were incubated for 4 h at 
30 °C, with shaking, to ensure exponential growth. Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) (5 μ
g/mL) was then added to 
Figure 3. Human DHFR protects Plasmodium from triclosan. P. falciparum NF54 strain was transfected with a 
plasmid expressing human dihydrofolate reductase, and treated with either triclosan or pyrimethamine for 48 h. 
Relative parasitemias were calculated following JC1 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Error bars indicate 
SEM.

the culture to reduce expression of the gene for the heterologous enzymes24. The culture was attached to a Thermo 
Combi multidrop within the Robot Scientist Eve work cell24. The culture was stirred continuously and maintained 
at 23 °C during assay plate set-up.
High-throughput drug screens were performed by the Robot Scientist Eve using the mixed cultures described 
above and the ~1,600 FDA- and foreign- approved drugs from the Johns Hopkins University Clinical Compound 
Library. Strains were grown in competition in the presence of a library compound, and the relative growth rates 
used to estimate the activity of the drug against the parasite target. For hit confirmation assays, the Robot Scientist 
Eve prepared plates with eight replicates of eight different compounds, at six different concentrations (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 
10, 20 μ
M), and 64 negative control wells.
Recombinant protein expression and purification. 
Synthetic genes encoding versions of the Homo 
sapiens and P. vivax dihydrofolate reductases25, tagged with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and polyhistidine 
(HIS) sequences, were cloned into the BamHI/NsiI sites of pMAT10 (Keily Littlefield and Darerca Owen, personal 
communication). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) transformants, harboring each of the plasmids, were grown in LB 
medium and recombinant protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-β
-D-thio-galactopyranoside 
(IPTG) for 16 hours at 15 °C. Cultures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant discarded, and 
cell pellets resuspended in 1/50th of the culture volume in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl and Roche 
Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor tablets, DNase I (RNase-free; Thermo-Scientific 2 U.mL−
1), 1 mM 
Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Sigma). Cell suspensions were passed three times through an 
EmulsiFlex-C5 to facilitate cell lysis.
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 rcf for 50 min at 8 °C. MBP_HIS-tagged proteins were purified in 
HIS-Select® Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) gravity-flow columns. MBP_HIS-tagged DHFRs were dialyzed 
into Thrombin Cleavage Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM NaCl) and incubated for 
5 hours at 20 °C with 24 mM lactose and 5 U/mL bovine thrombin (GE Healthcare). Cleavages were terminated 
by raising the NaCl concentration of the solution to 0.5 M and binding to 1 mL HiTrap Benzamidine FF columns 
(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with High Salt Thrombin Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 
500 mM NaCl). Cleaved samples were dialyzed into Methotrexate Equilibration Buffer (50 mM Tris- HCl, pH 
8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT and 10% v/v glycerol) and applied to columns containing 1.25 mL 
methotrexate-agarose beads (Sigma). The columns were washed with 20 mL of Methotrexate Equilibration Buffer 
then eluted in 1.5 mL fractions using Methotrexate Elution Buffer (Methotrexate Equilibration Buffer + 4 mM 
DHF).
We attempted to express and purify P. falciparum DHFR and pyrimethamine-resistant P.vivax DHFR under 
multiple conditions, but were unable to recover stable proteins for enzyme assays.

Enzyme Assays. 
DHFR catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), coupled 
to the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This reaction was followed in vitro 
by absorbance at λ
abs = 340 nm by spectrophotometry (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices) in UV-transparent 
96-well plates (Costar, Corning) at 21 °C. NADPH and DHF absorb at 340 nm with a combined extinction coef-
ficient of ε
340nM = 12,300 M−
1 cm−
1, which takes into consideration the oxidation of NADPH and the reduction 
of DHF.
H. sapiens DHFR (HsDHFR) and P. vivax DHFR (PvDHFR) were thawed and stored at 4 °C for use in the 
enzyme assay. DHF and NADPH stocks were made to 1 mM in assay buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4) and stored at 
−
20 °C until use. Triclosan (Irgasan; Sigma-Aldrich) (stored as a 1 mM stock in 10% (v/v) DMSO in 0.1 M Tris, 
pH 7.4) was incubated with HsDHFR or PvDHFR for 10 minutes in assay buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4) before addi-
tion of 100 μ
M DHF and 100 μ
M NADPH. Reaction conditions: [triclosan] = 0 or 100 µM, [HsDHFR] = 30.5 nM, 
[PvDHFR] = 18.5 nM, [DHF] = [NADPH] = 100 µM.
Initial rates of reaction at various concentrations of triclosan were monitored by spectrophotometry 
(SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices) and data were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft). Initial rates were deter-
mined by following the linear absorbance decrease and used to derive IC50 values. Reaction turnover was assayed 
in UV-transparent 96-well plates (Costar, Corning) with a total volume of 100 μ
L. DHF and NADPH stocks were 
made up to 1 mM in assay buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4) and stored at −
20 °C until use.
To deal with variations in enzyme activity in different preparations, kinetic data were normalized as relative 
activities and fitted to the following equation:
=
+
% activity
% activity
/(1
[triclosan]/IC ),
max
50
assuming competitive inhibition and using the Cheng-Prusoff equation36. Errors were calculated from multiple 
kinetic runs. The kinetics of PvDHFR carried a larger error than HsDHFR because PvDHFR was prone to loss of 
activity during purification and storage. Duplicates were performed and IC50 values were obtained by fitting the 
data shown in Fig. 1C to the above equation (MatLab software, Mathworks – curves were fitted by Fabrice Gielen, 
Cambridge).

Culture of wild-type and transgenic P. falciparum. 
P. falciparum strain NF54 was transfected with a 
pDC10 derivate37 and cultivated as described previously38. Wild-type and transgenic parasites were cultivated in 
the presence of increasing concentrations of triclosan (0–2.6 µM) or pyrimethamine (0–35 nM). Drug treatment 
of cultures was started at 0.5–1% parasitemia (trophozoite stage) and run for 48 h. Parasitemias were quantified 
using the SYBR method39 and resulting fluorescence data were analysed and plotted using Excel. The experiments 
were done twice in biological triplicates.
Docking. 
The starting coordinates of the human DHFR (PDB ID: 3NTZ), P. vivax DHFR (PDB ID: 2BL9), P. 
falciparum DHFR (PDB ID: 4DPD), P. vivax double mutant DHFR (PDB ID: 2BLA), and P. falciparum quadruple 
mutant DHFR (PDB ID: 4DP3) were collected from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org)40–42 and employed in 
Glide (Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite 2014-2: Glide, version 6.3, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2014) 
docking calculations.
For Glide calculations, all the crystallographic structures were first imported to Maestro (Schrödinger 
Release 2014-2: Maestro, version 9.8, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2014). With the exception of NADPH, all 
co-crystallized ligands and water molecules were identified and removed from the structures and the enzymes 
were treated using the Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrödinger Release 2014-2: Schrödinger Suite 2014-2 
Protein Preparation Wizard; Epik version 2.8, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2014) provided by Maestro. All 
the enzymatic structures were also checked for missing atoms, bonds, and contacts. The structure of triclosan was 
first constructed using Maestro’s building tool and energetically minimized for processing using LigPrep, which 
allowed the acquisition of a valid low-energy 3D structure for this inhibitor with correct protonation state in the 
pH range of 7 ± 2. Molecular Docking was initiated by generating a Grid file using Receptor Grid Generation 
tool of Glide. Grid files containing receptor and binding site information required for molecular docking were 
prepared using the default options of the Receptor Grid Generation tool with the grid box being centered at the 
coordinates average of the co-crystallized ligand for each crystallographic structure. To test the reliability of the 
docking procedure, all the co-crystallized ligands were first docked into the corresponding crystallographic struc-
ture using the Extra Precision (XP) Glide algorithm. Subsequently, triclosan was also successfully docked in each 
active site and the lowest energy conformation provided by Glide Score was chosen.
Ethics statement. 
Human blood and plasma were obtained from the local blood bank and ethical clearance 
for using this blood for this research was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences 
at the University of São Paulo (No. 842/2016).
