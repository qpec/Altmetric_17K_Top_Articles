BACKGROUND: Infertility is a global public health issue, affecting 15% of all couples of reproductive age. Male factors, including
decreased semen quality, are responsible for ~25% of these cases. The dietary pattern, the components of the diet and nutrients have
been studied as possible determinants of sperm function and/or fertility.

 OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Previous systematic reviews have been made of the few heterogeneous low-quality randomized clin-
ical trials (RCTs) conducted in small samples of participants and investigating the effect of specific nutrients and nutritional supplements on
male infertility. However, as yet there has been no systematic review of observational studies.
SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review was made of the published literature, from the earliest available online index-
ing year to November 2016, in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses. We have included cross-sectional, case-control and prospective and retrospective studies in which fertile/infertile men were
well defined (men with sperm disorders, sperm DNA damage, varicocele or idiopathic infertility). The primary outcomes were semen qual-
ity or fecundability. With the data extracted, we evaluated and scored the quality of the studies selected. We excluded RCTs, animal stud-
ies, review articles and low-quality studies.
OUTCOMES: A total of 1944 articles were identified, of which 35 were selected for qualitative analysis. Generally, the results indicated
that healthy diets rich in some nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene, selenium, zinc,
cryptoxanthin and lycopene), other vitamins (vitamin D and folate) and low in saturated fatty acids and trans-fatty acids were inversely
associated with low semen quality parameters. Fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, low-fat dairy and skimmed
milk were positively associated with several sperm quality parameters. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat
dairy and total dairy products, cheese, coffee, alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been detrimentally associated with the
quality of semen in some studies. As far as fecundability is concerned, a high intake of alcohol, caffeine and red meat and processed meat
by males has a negative influence on the chance of pregnancy or fertilization rates in their partners.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Male adherence to a healthy diet could improve semen quality and fecundability rates. Since observational
studies may prove associations but not causation, the associations summarized in the present review need to be confirmed with large pro-
spective cohort studies and especially with well-designed RCTs.
Key words: diet / nutrition / nutrients / food / male infertility / sperm parameters / fecundability
Introduction
Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy
after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse. In
recent decades infertility has become a global public health issue and
a major clinical concern, affecting 15% of all reproductive age couples.
It has been estimated that 70 million couples worldwide experience
subfertility or infertility (Boivin et al., 2007). Male factors, including
decreased semen quality, are responsible for ~25% of cases of infer-
tility (Evers, 2002; Sharlip et al., 2002) and, in the USA, the preva-
lence of men seeking help for fertility is estimated at 3.3–4.7 million
(Anderson et al., 2009).
Some studies suggest that human semen quality has declined in
certain geographic regions of the world (e.g. Europe and USA)
(Merzenich et al., 2010; Mendiola et al., 2013). Currently, the etiology
of suboptimal semen quality is poorly understood, and many physio-
logical, environmental and genetic factors, including oxidative stress,
have been implicated (WHO, 2010; Jungwirth et al., 2012).
Environmental factors such as air pollution, smoking, stress, che-
micals and other toxic agents in the diet have all been considered as
possibly responsible for the decrease in semen quality observed in
developed countries (Carlsen et al., 1992; Merzenich et al., 2010).
In terms of the diet, since the 1980s several components and nutri-
ents have been considered as possible determinants of sperm func-
tion, fertility or normal function of the reproductive system (Abbasi
et al., 1979).
Accumulating evidence from human in vitro and animal studies indi-
cates that male obesity and some components of the diet may play a
pivotal role in modulating spermatogenesis, sperm maturation and
fertilizing ability. For example, male obesity has been related to
impaired reproductivity because of its effect on the molecular and
physical structure of sperm (Mitchell et al., 2011; Palmer et al.,
2012a,b). In addition, several foods and some components of the
diet that have been associated with an increased risk of obesity, insu-
lin resistance and diabetes have also been related to low sperm qual-
ity or function in animal models. For example, diets rich in calories
(Rato et al., 2014), trans-fatty acids (TFAs), saturated fats (Ng et al.,
2010) or cholesterol (Morgan et al., 2014) have been associated to
testicular disruption, involving impairments in spermatogenesis poten-
tially affecting male fertility and the offspring.
Likewise, several cross-sectional, case-control, retrospective and pro-
spective observational studies, some of which were conducted in large
samples of individuals, have assessed the associations between diet and
semen quality and/or fecundability, with controversial results.
In spite of this, there are many assisted reproductive clinics that
recommend simple lifestyle changes such as increases in physical
activity, cognitive behavioral therapy and yoga to reduce stress, give
advice on how to reduce alcohol and caffeine intake or provide lists
of dietary recommendations (Collins and Rossi, 2015) in order to
improve semen quality and fertility chances. Nonetheless, reality
shows how important it is to have a better understanding of the
effect of lifestyle and diet on male fertility before useful recommenda-
tions can be made.
Recently, a review was published of randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) investigating the effect of specific nutrients and nutritional
supplements on male infertility (Giahi et al., 2016). In total, 12 het-
erogeneous and low-quality RCTs, conducted in small samples of
participants, investigating the effect of specific nutrients and nutri-
tional supplements on male infertility were systematically reviewed.

 plus vitamin E; eicoseptanoic plus docohexanoid acid; and ubiquinol
were used in an attempt to improve such classical sperm quality para-
meters as sperm concentration, motility and morphology or sperm
DNA fragmentation (SDF). Only a few studies using supplements of
carnitine, coenzyme Q10 and selenium have demonstrated some
beneficial effects on sperm parameters although they have been
unable to give clear explanations about the potential underlying
mechanisms. Therefore, Giahi et al. (2016) concluded that studies
have reported contradictory evidence on the role that dietary com-
pounds play in male infertility and that large, well-designed RCTs are
warranted in the future to better establish recommendations.
In spite of the lack of evidence about the role diet plays in sperm
parameters and the effectiveness of supplements to combat male
infertility, there has been an invasion of integrative dietary products in
the last two decades in some ART clinics. Unfortunately, the safety
of these dietary supplements has not been tested, and the dangers
for the user population are unknown.
In an attempt to provide a wide-ranging vision of the field and
extend the conclusions of Giahi et al. (2016) review, the aim of the
present analysis was to systematically review all those observational
studies investigating the relationships of diet, food and nutrient con-
sumption to sperm quality and male fecundability.
Methods
Protocol and registration
The protocol of the present study has been registered (PROSPERO
2016: CRD42016039410) in the PROSPERO registry (http://www.crd.
york.ac.uk/PROSPERO), an international database for the prospective
registration of systematic reviews in health and social care.
Information sources
We conducted a systematic search of the literature published in the
MEDLINE-Pubmed
database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)
and a hand searched reference list, from the earliest available online
indexing year until November 2016, in accordance with the guidelines of
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(Liberati et al., 2009).
The search used a combination of terms as both Medical Subject
Headings and keywords. The search strategy used male infertility-related
keywords and words related to nutrition and diet: fertility OR infertility
OR male fertility OR male infertility OR sperm dysfunction OR sperm
dysfunctions OR sperm DNA damage OR varicocele OR asthenozoos-
permia OR oligozoospermia OR oligoasthenozoospermia OR oligoasthe-
noteratozoospermia OR teratozoospermia AND mediterranean diet OR
diet OR nutrients OR food OR nuts OR vitamin C OR vitamin E OR zinc
OR antioxidants OR vitamins OR cereals OR meat OR vegetables OR
fruit OR fish OR legumes OR milk OR yogurt OR cheese OR seeds OR
eggs OR dairy product OR micronutrient OR macronutrient OR alcohol
OR alcohol consumption OR selenium OR fatty acids OR sugar. We
applied the following inclusion filters: Classical Article, Clinical Study,
Comparative Study, Congresses Dataset, English Abstract, Evaluation
Studies, Introductory Journal Article, Journal Article, Letter, Meta-
Analysis, Multicenter Study, Observational Study, Abstract, Humans,
Male and English.
Eligibility criteria, search and study selection
The titles and abstracts of all the articles were screened for eligibility by
the three authors, who were specialists in male (in)fertility and nutrition.
We included case-control, cross-sectional and observational prospective
and retrospective studies in which fertile/infertile men were well defined
(men with sperm disorders, sperm DNA damage, varicocele or idiopathic
infertility). In addition, the primary outcomes of the studies were semen
quality (volume, motility, morphology, sperm count or concentration,
sperm DNA damage or chromatin integrity, sperm aneuploidies and hor-
monal level) or fecundability (fertilization rate, pregnancy rate or miscar-
riage rate). We excluded RCTs, animal studies, review articles and low-
quality studies (see quality assessment section). After the primary screen-
ing (evaluation of the scope of the study), and once quality and compli-
ance with all the inclusion/exclusion criteria had been evaluated, the full
text of the selected articles was obtained.
Data extraction
We extracted the following information from each study: author/s, year
of publication, journal, title of the article, location of the study, cohort
name (if appropriate), age, infertility problem, number of patients or par-
ticipants (sample size), study design, exposure (nutrient, food, food group
or dietary pattern), primary outcomes and major findings or principal
conclusion. After the data had been extracted, they were checked by the
authors for discrepancies in order to minimize the possibility of errors.
Quality assessment
Using all the data extracted, we evaluated and scored the quality of the
studies selected on a six-point scale (Hayden et al., 2006). The quality
scores were assessed in parallel by the three authors, and discrepancies
were re-evaluated together. With this system, we assessed the quality of
individual studies using the following criteria (one point per criterion): (i)
study participation (the study sample represents the key characteristics of
the population of interest sufficiently well to limit potential bias to the
results); (ii) study attrition (loss to follow-up is not associated with key
characteristics); (iii) prognostic factor measurement (the prognostic factor
of interest is measured in study participants in such a way that potential
bias is limited); (iv) confounding measurement and account (the outcome
of interest is measured in study participants in such a way that potential
bias is limited); (v) outcome measurement (important potential confoun-
ders are appropriately accounted for, limiting potential bias with respect to
the prognostic factor of interest); and (vi) analysis (the statistical analysis is
appropriate for the design of the study, and limits the potential for invalid
results). Studies with a score between 0 and 3 points were considered to
be of low quality, while >3 to 6 were considered to be of high quality.
Results
We identified 1940 articles after a primary search by MEDLINE-
Pubmed and four from other sources (Google Scholar and reviews
references) (Fig. 1). By analyzing the abstracts (n = 1944), we
screened and excluded 1811 for reasons of the scope of the study. A
total of 133 articles were collected as full texts so that the inclusion/
exclusion criteria and quality could be assessed: 92 articles were
excluded because they did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria
and six articles because they were not given the minimum quality
assessment score. After applying all the eligibility parameters, 35 arti-
cles were included for qualitative analysis.

Diet and male fertility: a systematic review
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-abstract/23/4/371/3065333 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Summary of selected studies and design
The articles included subjects from 18 countries: Argentine, Brazil,
Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iran,
Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and
USA. The age of the participants ranged between 18 and 80 years
old. There were 11 cross-sectional studies (n = 21 articles), six case-
control studies (n = 8 articles), three prospective studies and three
retrospective studies.
Primary outcomes of interest
Of the 35 articles included, 31 (n = 12 672 participants) evaluated
the effect of dietary patterns and food intake on sperm parameters
and quality (Table I) (Goverde et al., 1995; Serra-Majem et al., 2003;
Stutz et al., 2004; Eskenazi et al., 2005; Silver et al., 2005; Chavarro

2015; Karayiannis et al., 2016), and five (n = 13 125 participants) on
fecundability (Table II) (Florack et al., 1994; Curtis et al., 1997; Olsen
et al., 1997; Braga et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2015). It should be pointed
out that the Braga et al. (2012) study is included in the two primary
outcome groups: sperm parameters and fecundability of partners.
Sperm parameters
Only one retrospective study was included in this systematic
review (Table I) (Stutz et al., 2004). It found no significant associa-
tions between alcohol consumption and plasma testosterone con-
centrations or seminal parameters in 34 healthy participants from
Argentina.

 Case-control studies are shown in Table I (Goverde et al., 1995;
Serra-Majem et al., 2003; Mendiola et al., 2009, 2010; Eslamian et al.,
2012, 2015, 2016; de Jong et al., 2014).
Two of them focused on analyzing the relationship between alco-
hol consumption and semen quality and their conclusions are contro-
versial. Goverde et al. (1995) studied 47 cases and 68 controls with
poor semen quality attending an infertility clinic, and showed that
men who drank alcohol every day had a lower percentage of normal
sperm morphology than men who did not drink alcohol. In con-
trast, de Jong et al. (2014) did not find an association between alco-
hol consumption and such sperm parameters as volume, sperm
count, motility and morphology in 42 infertile cases with astheno-
zoospermia and 121 fertile male controls.
A large case-control study based on 405 males with poor semen
quality and 379 fertile controls investigated the possible association
of cyclamate, cyclohexylamine and other artificial sweeteners with
male infertility. The conclusion was that the ingestion of these sweet-
eners was not related to sperm quality (Serra-Majem et al., 2003).
Several studies have evaluated the relationship between food
groups and fertility. One of these is Mendiola et al. (2009) who ana-
lyzed infertile cases with poor semen quality and fertile controls (30
cases and 31 controls). They showed that, compared to the controls,
infertile cases presented a lower consumption of skimmed milk, shell-
fish, tomatoes and lettuce; and they consumed more yogurt, meat
products and potatoes (Mendiola et al., 2009). In another article
using the same population, the authors also show that infertile cases
presented significantly lower intakes of carbohydrates, fiber, folate,
vitamin C and lycopene; and higher intakes of proteins and total fat
(Mendiola et al., 2010).
The associations between the consumption of different food
groups and the risk of having different idiopathic asthenozoospermia
infertility were also evaluated in 72 asthenozoospermic cases and 169
normozoospermic controls from Iran. Individuals with asthenozoos-
permia were observed to consume less fruit and vegetables (i.e.
oranges, tomatoes and dark green vegetables), poultry, skimmed milk
and seafood than controls. Nonetheless, an increased intake of pro-
cessed meats, dairy products and sweets was associated with a sig-
nificantly higher risk of asthenozoospermia (Eslamian et al., 2012).
More recent studies by the same group, but with 235 normozoos-
permic controls and 107 asthenozoospermic cases, concluded that a
high intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), TFAs, and palmitic and ste-
aric fatty acids was positively related to the probability of having asth-
enozoospermia.
They
also
found
inverse
and
dose-dependent
associations between the intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the risk of hav-
ing asthenozoospermia (Eslamian et al., 2015). In another published
report, a high intake of some vitamins (vitamin E, vitamin D and vita-
min C), zinc, folate, total fiber, selenium and PUFAs was significantly
associated with a lower risk of asthenozoospermia (Eslamian et al.,
2016).
Table I summarizes the cross-sectional studies (Eskenazi et al.,
2005; Silver et al., 2005; Chavarro et al., 2008, 2014; Young et al.,
2008; Vujkovic et al., 2009; Attaman et al., 2012; Gaskins et al., 2012;
Mínguez-Alarcón et al., 2012; Schmid et al., 2012; Afeiche et al.,
2013, 2014a,b,c; Jensen et al., 2013, 2014; Zareba et al., 2013;
Anifandis et al., 2014; Chiu et al., 2014; Cutillas-Tolin et al., 2015;
Karayiannis et al., 2016).
Two studies focused on alcohol consumption and semen quality,
the SDF index and serum reproductive hormones (Anifandis et al.,
2014; Jensen et al., 2014). While one of these studies, conducted in
8344 healthy participants, found that a moderate alcohol intake was
associated with higher levels of serum testosterone, but was not
harmfully associated with semen quality (Jensen et al., 2014), the
other (n = 207 potentially infertile participants) associated total alco-
hol consumption with lower sperm volume and higher SDF. This
same study found that the combination of cigarette and alcohol con-
sumption was associated with higher SDF (Anifandis et al., 2014).
The Age and Genetic Effects in Sperm study, conducted in healthy
participants, focused on three different factors, which were reported
in three different articles (Eskenazi et al., 2005; Silver et al., 2005;
Young et al., 2008): (i) sperm quality (volume, motility, number of
spermatozoa and concentration), (ii) sperm chromatin integrity, and
(iii) sperm aneuploidy. A positive relationship was demonstrated
between vitamin C intake and total sperm count, concentration and
total progressive motility; vitamin E intake, and progressive motility
or total progressively motile sperm count; and β-carotene intake, and
sperm concentration and progressive motility. However, folate and
zinc intake were not associated with several parameters of semen
quality (Eskenazi et al., 2005). Furthermore, a high antioxidant intake
was not related to improved sperm chromatin structure and, there-
fore, to fertility problems in 87 healthy men (Silver et al., 2005).
Finally, compared to those with low intake, men with high folate
intake had lower overall frequencies of several types of sperm aneu-
ploidy (for chromosomes X, Y and 21) (Young et al., 2008).
Only one article, conducted in 80 healthy participants, primarily
focused on sperm DNA damage. Compared to those in the refer-
ence quartile, men in the top quartile of vitamin C intake had less
SDF, with similar findings for vitamin E, folate and zinc (but not β-
carotene). Also, older men (>44 years) in the top quartile of vitamin
C intake had less SDF than older men in the reference quartile of
intake, with similar findings for vitamin E and zinc. However, younger
men (<44 years) did not benefit from higher intakes of the micronu-
trients surveyed (Schmid et al., 2012).
Two articles conducted in the same population (99 male partners
of subfertile couples from the Massachusetts General Hospital
Fertility Center (USA) who presented for semen analyses) focused
on the association between soy rich isoflavone food, fat intake and
semen quality parameters. A higher intake of soy foods was asso-
ciated with lower sperm concentration (Chavarro et al., 2008), and
total fat intake was negatively related to total sperm count and sperm
concentration (Chavarro et al., 2008). These associations appeared
to be driven primarily by intake of saturated fat. Conversely, intake of
omega-3 PUFAs was positively related to normal sperm morphology
(Attaman et al., 2012).
The association between food consumption and sperm parameters
was also studied by the same group of researchers in another sample
of partners of couples presenting for semen analyses (n = 155). Low-
fat dairy intake, particularly low-fat milk, was related to higher sperm
concentration and progressive motility, whereas cheese consumption
was related to lower sperm concentrations, but only among past or
current smokers (Afeiche et al., 2014a). In addition, fish consumption
was positively related to total sperm count and morphology, whereas
processed meat consumption was negatively associated with sperm
morphology (Afeiche et al., 2014b).

Diet and male fertility: a systematic review
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-abstract/23/4/371/3065333 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Using data from the Rochester Young Men’s Study (RYMS), a
cross-sectional study conducted in 189 healthy young men in
2009–2010, five articles were published (Gaskins et al., 2012; Afeiche
et al., 2013, 2014c; Zareba et al., 2013; Chiu et al., 2014). When par-
ticipants were categorized by factor analysis, the ‘Prudent’ diet (char-
acterized by a high intake of fish, chicken, fruit, vegetables, legumes
and whole grains) was significantly associated with higher progressive
sperm motility (but not with sperm concentration and morphology)
while the ‘Western’ diet (characterized by high intake of red and pro-
cessed meat, refined grains, pizza, snacks, high-energy drinks and
sweets) was not (Gaskins et al., 2012). As far as dietary antioxidants
are concerned, lycopene intake was related to better sperm morph-
ology, whereas a high intake of vitamin C from food sources alone
was associated with a lower sperm concentration and sperm count
(Zareba et al., 2013). Three articles from the RYMS analyzed which
foods were related to sperm parameters and reproductive hormone
levels. The intake of full-fat dairy products was inversely related to
sperm motility and morphology, and these associations were driven
primarily by the intake of cheese and were independent of overall
dietary patterns. However, non-significant associations were reported
between dairy food consumption and hormone levels (Afeiche et al.,
2013). As far as the consumption of beverages is concerned, men in
the highest quartile of sugar-sweetened beverages showed lower
sperm motility than those in the reference quartile. However, no
association between sugar-sweetened beverages and other semen
quality parameters or reproductive hormone levels were described
(Chiu et al., 2014). Finally, intake of processed red meat was inversely
related to total sperm count and total progressive motile sperm
count (Afeiche et al., 2014c).
In the Murcia Young Men’s cross-sectional Study carried out on
~200 healthy Spanish university students (18–23 years old), a positive
association was observed between the dietary intake of several anti-
oxidant nutrients (cryptoxanthin, vitamin C, lycopene and β-caro-
tene) and total motile sperm count. Moreover, semen volume
increased in those individuals with a high intake of vitamin C, lyco-
pene and β-carotene (Mínguez-Alarcón et al., 2012). Cutillas-Tolin
et al. (2015) and collaborators show that traditional Mediterranean
diets (characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruits and seafood)
may have a positive impact on male reproductive potential because
this pattern was positively associated with total sperm count,
although a ‘Western’ pattern was positively related to the percentage
of morphologically normal sperm. The same authors reported that
dietary cholesterol was inversely related to ejaculate volume after
adjusting for potential confounders, whereas the intake of TFAs was
inversely related to total sperm count (Chavarro et al., 2014).
One of the largest cross-sectional studies examining the associ-
ation between dietary fat intake and semen quality was conducted in
701 healthy young Danish men. Compared to those in the bottom
quartile, men in the top quartile of energy intake as SFAs showed
lower sperm concentrations and lower total sperm counts. In the
same study, the percentage of normal morphology spermatozoa was
lower among men consuming a high percentage of energy from
monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas semen volume was higher
among men with a high intake of n-3 fatty acids (Jensen et al., 2013).
In the FOod, Lifestyle and Fertility Outcome study (FOLFO-study)
conducted in 161 healthy Dutch men, Vujkovic et al. (2009) com-
pared two dietary patterns. When participants were categorized by
factor analysis, the ‘Health Conscious’ diet (high intakes of fruits,
vegetables, fish and whole grains) was significantly associated with
less SDF but the ‘Traditional Dutch’ diet (high intakes of meat, pota-
toes and whole grains and low intakes of beverages and sweets), was
positively correlated with sperm concentration.
Recently, adherence to the Mediterranean diet assessed by a valid-
ated score, was positively associated with higher sperm concentra-
tion, total sperm count and sperm motility in a cross-sectional study
in 225 men (26–55 years old) from couples attending a fertility clinic
(Karayiannis et al., 2016).
In the only prospective study conducted to date (Table I), 250
male participants whose partners had undergone ICSI cycles were
analyzed. In this study, the sperm concentration was negatively asso-
ciated with the frequency of cereal consumption and the number of
meals per day. In addition, sperm motility was negatively associated
with alcohol and coffee consumption, and positively associated with
the consumption of cereals and fruits (Braga et al., 2012).
The quality scores of the articles related to the sperm parameters
included in this review are modest (case-control studies, mean =
5.06/6, cross-sectional studies, mean = 5.27/6 and prospective and
retrospective studies = 4.5/6).
Fecundability
Table II shows retrospective and prospective studies analyzing the
association between male food consumption and fecundability. The
two retrospective studies included in this review (Curtis et al., 1997;
Olsen et al., 1997) are both large and focus on the frequency of
alcohol consumption. In the study by Curtis et al. (1997) of 2607
healthy partners of farmers (2593 men), individuals who were heavy
tea drinkers (regardless of caffeine content) had decreased fecund-
ability. However, no association was reported between alcohol con-
sumption and fecundability (Curtis et al., 1997). The largest
multicentric study conducted by Olsen et al. (1997) in 6630 theoret-
ically healthy couples (6279 men) from the general population and
4035 couples (3603 men) from a pregnancy register population,
non-significant associations were detected between alcohol con-
sumption and fecundability.
The three prospective studies (Florack et al., 1994; Braga et al.,
2012; Xia et al., 2015) (Table II) are small studies that analyze
between 141 and 259 male partners of women attending an infertil-
ity clinic. Florack et al. show that male partners with a consumption
of ≥10 alcoholic drinks per week had a higher probability of fecund-
ity, whereas heavy consumers of caffeine (≥7 cups/day) had a low-
er probability (Florack et al., 1994). The other two prospective
studies aimed to assess the influence on fecundability of food con-
sumption by men (250 and 141 male partners whose couples had
undergone ART cycles, respectively). In the Braga et al. study, alco-
hol consumption had a negative influence on the fertilization rate,
whereas the consumption of red meat had a negative impact on the
implantation rate and on the chance of pregnancy (Braga et al.,
2012). In Xia’s study, poultry intake was positively associated with
fertilization rates, whereas processed meat intake was negatively
associated with fertilization rates among couples undergoing con-
ventional IVF (Xia et al., 2015).
The quality scores of the articles related to the fecundability stud-
ies included in this review are also modest (mean = 4.7/6).

 Discussion
The present review of epidemiological/observational studies pro-
vides the most comprehensive analysis to date of the associations
between diet or nutrient intake and the risk of infertility. It suggests
that diet modifications may be useful in modulating male fertility and
fecundability.
As far as sperm quality is concerned, the results of this systematic
review indicated that healthy diets (i.e. the Mediterranean diet) rich
in such nutrients as omega-3 fatty acids, some antioxidants and vita-
mins, and low in SFAs and TFAs are inversely associated with low
semen quality parameters. In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and
seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy
products have been positively related to sperm quality. However,
diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy pro-
ducts, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets
have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some
studies (Fig. 2).
The few studies relating male nutrient or food intake and fecund-
ability also suggest that diets rich in red meat, processed meat, tea
and caffeine are associated with a lower rate of fecundability. This
association is only controversial in the case of alcohol (Fig. 3).
The potential biological mechanisms linking diet with sperm func-
tion and fertility are largely unknown and require further study.
Below we show some of the mechanisms deserving attention in rela-
tion to the consumption of some foods.
Fruits, vegetables and cereals
Fruits and vegetables are rich in water, antioxidant vitamins (espe-
cially vitamin C, vitamin A, β-carotene and polyphenols, but also
other phytochemicals), some minerals with antioxidant properties
(potassium and magnesium), folate and fiber.
There is a direct association between antioxidant status and the pro-
duction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in spermatozoa (Ross et al.,
2010). In addition, high concentrations of ROS negatively affect sperm

 DNA and, consequently, sperm motility, vitality and concentration, but
also miscarriage and developmental abnormalities in the offspring (Saleh
et al., 2003; Tremellen, 2008; Aitken et al., 2016; Aitken, 2016).
Antioxidants are considered to be ‘scavengers’ of ROS and their use
has been studied as a treatment to reverse the adverse impact of high
ROS concentrations on semen parameters (Ross et al., 2010). In fact
most of the clinical trials conducted in humans, based on relatively little
scientific evidence, have demonstrated some possible benefits of several
types of antioxidants on sperm quality (Scott et al., 1998; Ghanem
et al., 2010). Antioxidants have also shown some promise in treating
idiopathic oxidative stress in spermatozoa (Gharagozloo and Aitken,
2011; Showell et al., 2014). However, these results should be replicated
in the future before solid recommendations can be made.
As has been reported, men with a high folate intake had lower fre-
quencies of several types of sperm aneuploidy (Young et al., 2008),
which suggests that this vitamin could be important in spermatogen-
esis. Folate, which is mainly present in green leafy vegetables, is
essential for DNA maintenance, and transfer RNA and protein syn-
thesis (Molloy, 2012). Because DNA synthesis is an essential part of
spermatogenesis, folate is probably important to the process. In fact,
in an RCT, the total normal sperm count increased after combined
sulfate and folic acid treatment in both subfertile and fertile men
(Wong et al., 2002).
In addition, fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole cereals are the
principal sources of fiber. Some studies have demonstrated that fiber
consumption reduced plasma estrogen levels by binding directly to
unconjugated estrogens (Goldin et al., 1982), and low plasma estrogen
levels in males are essential for normal fertility (Amarnath et al., 2016).
Soy foods
The principal hypothesis for the negative effect of soy foods on male
fertility was the phytoestrogen concentration. Phytoestrogens have
known deleterious effects on the male endocrine system (Santti et al.,
1998) with potential effects on fertility. Nevertheless, the question of
whether phytoestrogens are beneficial or harmful to human health
remains unresolved. Animal studies have suggested that exposure to
phytoestrogens in the developmental period is not advisable because
they may disrupt the endocrine system (McMichael-Phillips et al.,
1998). However, the only RCT study testing the effect of consuming
soy foods in humans has demonstrated no effect on serum gonado-
trophin and sex hormone levels, or on semen quality (Mitchell et al.,
2001).
Potatoes
Potatoes primarily contain starches with a high glycemic index and
glycemic load properties (Atkinson et al., 2008). A high glycemic and
insulinemic response to food has been associated with oxidative
stress (Hu et al., 2006) which, as mentioned above, has an important
effect on semen quality (Ross et al., 2010). In addition, a diet with a
high glycemic index and high glycemic load has been associated with
an increased risk of inflammation (Kristo et al., 2013) and Type 2 dia-
betes (Muraki et al., 2016). In fact, the frequency of potato consump-
tion has recently been positively related to an increased risk of
diabetes development (Dong et al., 2011), and this has a detrimental
effect on semen parameters (Ding et al., 2015). Because glucose
metabolism is important to spermatogenesis, an excess of potatoes
and other high starch glycemic food can have detrimental effects on
sperm parameters through their effect on the glucose metabolism.
Indeed, hyperglycemia has been shown to affect sperm motility and
fertilization in mature sperm (Miki, 2007).
Fish, shellfish and seafood
The possible benefits of fish, seafood and shellfish on sperm para-
meters may be the result of their high omega-3 PUFA content.
Ecosapentanoic acid (EPA) and DHA are essential fatty acids that
play an important role in the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant prop-
erties of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase. A significant positive
correlation has been reported between DHA sperm concentrations
and sperm motility (Gulaya et al., 2001). Because seminal plasma is
recognized as one of the most powerful antioxidant fluids, it is not
surprising that any defects it may have are often associated with oxi-
dative stress through an increment in ROS, followed by a SDF, which
leads to male infertility (Wathes et al., 2007). In fact, the only RCT
conducted in infertile men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoosper-
mia and lower levels of EPA and DHA in spermatozoa has demon-
strated that omega-3 PUFA supplementation has beneficial effects on
some semen quality parameters (Safarinejad, 2011).
Therefore, it is plausible that increased fish intake or fish oil sup-
plementation may result in improved parameters of semen quality.
Dairy products
The possible effect of dairy foods on male fertility is highly controver-
sial. In short, full-fat dairy and total dairy products and cheese have
been negatively associated with sperm quality parameters. Total low-
fat dairy and skimmed milk, however, have been related to better
classical semen indices (Afeiche et al., 2013, 2014a). Commercial
milk is a mixture of milk from cows in different stages of pregnancy

 and non-pregnant cows, with ~75% coming from pregnant cows
(Ganmaa et al., 2001, 2004). Naturally occurring estrogens of placen-
tal origin are present in the milk of pregnant cows. As mentioned
above, estrogens, derived from dairy (or other food sources), could
contribute to a decrease in sperm production (Afeiche et al., 2013;
Amarnath et al., 2016). In theory all dairy products should have the
same effect, although in this case low-fat dairy products do not. On
the other hand, low-fat and skimmed milk consumption is associated
with higher circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
and insulin (Afeiche et al., 2014a). Results from animal studies also
indicate that insulin has the potential to increase sperm motility and
concentration in rats (Huang et al., 2016), and also to rescue sperm-
atogenesis in Type 1 diabetic mice (Schoeller et al., 2012a). The con-
sumption of low-fat and skimmed milk has also been associated with
higher peripheral concentrations of IGF-1 in community-dwelling par-
ticipants and increases in IGF-1 levels in feeding trials (Hoppe et al.,
2005; Bonjour et al., 2012). Given that spermatogenesis is a process
of active cell division requiring insulin, and that IGF-1 can bind and
activate Leydig cell insulin receptors regulating Sertoli cell prolifer-
ation, the relations observed between low-fat dairy products and
higher sperm concentration and motility may represent a biological
effect in humans (Afeiche et al., 2014a). In this case, the IGF-1 levels
may have a more important role than hormone homeostasis in
humans.
Meat and processed meat
Meat and processed meat are rich in protein, but also in xenobiotics,
mainly xenoestrogens (XEs) and in some cases anabolic steroids
(Swan et al., 2007). The use of these compounds in the food industry
increases the total level of XEs and sex steroids in processed foods,
such as meat, the intake of which contributes significantly to daily
exposures. XEs are highly lipophilic substances that can accumulate in
fat-rich foods like meat, which have estrogenic effects and are sus-
pected to be partially responsible for the decline in semen quality. In
an RCT, synthetic estrogens, such as polychlorinated biphenyls and
phthalate esters (widely used industrial compounds), showed dele-
terious effects on some semen parameters in infertile men with
unknown etiology (Rozati et al., 2002).
Meat, full-fat dairy products and butter are the principal sources of
SFAs. Although improvements in sperm parameters are a response
to PUFA omega-3 sources, in human spermatozoa, elevated SFA
concentrations and low omega-3 PUFA levels are related to
decreased fertility parameters (Esmaeili et al., 2015). In animal stud-
ies, some dietary SFAs do not affect sperm quality parameters
(Blesbois et al., 1997; Samadian et al., 2010; Esmaeili et al., 2014; Fair
et al., 2014). However, several studies in humans have shown higher
levels of palmitic acid or stearic acid in spermatozoa in infertile men
(Zalata et al., 1998; Aksoy et al., 2006).
Meat and dairy products are also the principal source of natural
TFAs. However, in our diet, TFAs mainly come from processed
foods such as bakery products, fast foods and snacks, which are
made with shortening, margarine or oils that contain partially hydro-
genated oils and fats. In rodents, a high intake of TFAs leads to a
number of adverse male reproductive outcomes including decreased
serum testosterone levels and, in extreme cases, arrest of spermato-
genesis and testicular degeneration with consequences such as low
sperm count or motility (Hanis et al., 1989; Veaute et al., 2007).
However, studies need to be carried out on the effect of TFA intake
on humans.
Coffee, tea and alcohol
In the present review, adult caffeine intake did not show a clear asso-
ciation with semen quality, but high caffeine intake was associated
with higher plasma levels of testosterone (Ramlau-Hansen et al.,
2008). Several studies have found a positive association between the
consumption of caffeine (from coffee, tea or caffeinated beverages)
and subfecundity in women (Jensen et al., 1998; Hassan and Killick,
2004). In males, the principal hypothesis is that elevated testosterone
levels could disrupt the endocrine system and have a detrimental
effect on sperm production (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2009).
Some epidemiological studies have examined the relationship
between alcohol consumption and reproductive function. Most of
them were conducted in small selected populations of infertile men
with contradictory results (La Vignera et al., 2013). A recent review
of 15 cross-sectional studies has shown a detrimental effect of alco-
hol consumption on semen volume and morphology, mainly in daily,
not occasional, consumers. This suggests that a moderate consump-
tion of alcohol should not adversely affect semen quality parameters
(Ricci et al., 2016). A positive association between excess alcohol
intake and some semen quality parameters has also been observed in
some, but not all, cross-sectional and case-control studies. However,
in relation to sperm parameters, the only prospective study included
in our review that assesses alcohol has reported an inverse associ-
ation between alcohol consumption and sperm concentration and
motility. In relation to fecundability, prospective studies show contra-
dictory results.
Alcohol has been experimentally shown to have a deleterious
effect at all levels of the male reproductive system. It interferes with
the regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis, impairing
LH and FSH secretion, decreasing testosterone levels, and disrupting
endocrine
homeostasis
(Muthusami
and
Chinnaswamy,
2005;
Maneesh et al., 2006). Likewise, the ratio between free estradiol and
free testosterone has been modified by alcohol intake (Hansen et al.,
2012), and spermatogenetic arrest and the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome
has been found to be more frequently associated with high alcohol
consumption (Pajarinen and Karhunen, 1994).
Sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages
Numerous studies have shown that sugar-sweetened beverages are
associated with weight gain and incidence of obesity (Forshee et al.,
2008; de Ruyter et al., 2012; Ebbeling et al., 2012; Malik et al., 2013;
Te Morenga et al., 2013; Khan and Sievenpiper, 2016), metabolic syn-
drome (Malik et al., 2010; Ferreira-Pêgo et al., 2016) and Type 2 dia-
betes (Greenwood et al., 2014; Imamura et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2015).
All
of
these
disorders
can
increase
insulin
resistance
(Stanhope et al., 2009) which could negatively influence semen quality
via increased oxidative stress (Park et al., 2009). In addition, sperm
cells contain receptors for glucose which are required for sperm
motility and post ejaculation maturation, both necessary for success-
ful conception (Williams and Ford, 2001). Moreover, glucose and
insulin can also disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis and,
therefore, sperm production (Schoeller et al., 2012a,b). Alternatively,

 sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages contain many contaminants
(for example, bisphenol A and phthalates) that have leached from
plastic containers and which may have a negative influence on sperm
quality (Jurewicz et al., 2013). The literature on this topic in humans
is scarce. However, a recent study in rodents found that sugary
drinks negatively impact male fertility (Ruff et al., 2013).
Limitations and strengths
Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Although
broad search terms were used, and reference lists were hand
searched, we may not have identified all publications. In addition, our
search strategy was limited to MEDLINE-Pubmed database, and not
EMBASE or other databases. However, the main scientific journals
are indexed in MEDLINE-Pubmed database. Misclassification of the
studies, publication bias and quality score attrition should also be
acknowledged as potential limitations and, to avoid this, the three
authors independently reviewed all the qualitative studies included.
However, the major limitation of the study is that the review was
based on epidemiological observational design studies, which limits
the ability to determine causality between food and nutrient intake,
and parameters of semen quality and fecundability.
Moreover, some intrinsic limitations of the studies included in this
review should be mentioned. First, populations were heterogeneous
between the studies. For instance, the subfertile populations have dif-
ferent phenotypes (asthenozoospermic participants or individuals
with poor semen quality). In addition, the control populations were
diverse and were taken from different environments (general popula-
tion, university students, farmers, etc.), which can potentially influ-
ence the findings. Second, other potential confounders, such as
health status, weight, age, medication use, energy intake, physical
activity and abstinence time, may influence the reported associations.
Some of these factors were considered as confounders in some stud-
ies, but not all.
Notwithstanding these limitations, this review is the most up to
date and exhaustive review of observational studies carried out with
a quality validated protocol, a tailored checklist and methodologically
rigorous quality control points. Future studies are needed to confirm
our conclusions.
Conclusion
The present systematic review of observational studies provides the
most comprehensive analysis to date of the associations between
diet or nutrient intake and the risk of infertility. It suggests that male
adherence to a healthy diet can improve semen quality and fecund-
ability rates. Since observational studies can prove associations but
not demonstrate causation, the associations summarized in the pre-
sent review need to be confirmed with large prospective cohort stud-
ies of high quality, and especially with well-designed RCTs.
