Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known cause of cervical 
cancers, as well as some vulvar, vaginal, penile, oropharyngeal, 
anal, and rectal cancers (1,2). Although most HPV infections 
are asymptomatic and clear spontaneously, persistent infec-
tions with one of 13 oncogenic HPV types can progress to 
precancer or cancer. To assess the incidence of HPV-associated 
cancers, CDC analyzed 2008–2012 high-quality data from the 
CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries and the National 
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
program. During 2008–2012, an average of 38,793 HPV-
associated cancers were diagnosed annually, including 23,000 
(59%) among females and 15,793 (41%) among males. By 
multiplying these counts by the percentages attributable to 
HPV (3), CDC estimated that approximately 30,700 new can-
cers were attributable to HPV, including 19,200 among females 
and 11,600 among males. Cervical precancers can be detected 
through screening, and treatment can prevent progression to 
cancer; HPV vaccination can prevent infection with HPV 
types that cause cancer at cervical and other sites (3). Vaccines 
are available for HPV types 16 and 18, which cause 63% of 
all HPV-associated cancers in the United States, and for HPV 
types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which cause an additional 10% 
(3). Among the oncogenic HPV types, HPV 16 is the most 
likely to both persist and to progress to cancer (3). The impact 
of these primary and secondary prevention interventions can 
be monitored using surveillance data from population-based 
cancer registries.
CDC analyzed data from population-based cancer registries that 
participate in the CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries 
and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results program and met the criteria for high data qual-
ity for all years 2008–2012, covering approximately 99% of the 
U.S. population.* Cases were classified by anatomic site using the 
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition† 
and were confirmed histologically. HPV-associated cancers were 
defined as invasive cancers at anatomic sites (i.e., cervix, vulva, 
vagina, penis, oropharynx, anus, and rectum) with cell types in 
which HPV DNA frequently is found (all carcinomas of the 
cervix, including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancers 
[SCC]; SCCs only for the other anatomic sites). Oropharyngeal 
cancers included cancers of the base of tongue; pharyngeal tonsils, 
anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars, and glossotonsillar sulci; 
anterior surface of soft palate and uvula; and lateral and posterior 
pharyngeal walls.§ Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated 
per 100,000 persons and standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard 
population. Rates were considered significantly different from the 
referent category at a p-value of <0.05.

Cancer registries do not routinely collect information on 
HPV DNA presence in cancer tissues, and HPV-associated 
cancers defined by anatomic site and cell type include cancers 
not caused by HPV. Therefore, to calculate HPV-attributable 
cases, the number of HPV-associated cancers was multiplied 
by the percentage of each cancer type attributable to HPV 
based on polymerase chain reaction genotyping studies (3). 
Because rectal squamous cell carcinoma was not included in 
the genotyping study, the HPV-attributable percentage for 
anal squamous cell carcinoma, a biologically similar tumor, 
was used (2).
Overall, an average of 38,793 HPV-associated cancers 
(11.7 per 100,000 persons) were diagnosed annually, includ-
ing 23,000 (13.5) among females and 15,793 (9.7) among 
males. The most common of these cancers were 11,771 (7.4 
per 100,000 females) cervical carcinomas, and 15,738 (4.5 
per 100,000 persons) oropharyngeal SCCs (12,638 among 
males and 3,100 among females) (Table 1). Rates of oropha-
ryngeal SCC were higher among males (7.6) than females 
(1.7), whereas rates of anal and rectal SCC were higher among 
females (1.8 and 0.3) than males (1.1 and 0.2).
Rates of cervical carcinoma were higher among blacks (9.2) 
than among whites (7.1), and among Hispanics (9.7) than 
non-Hispanics (7.1); a similar pattern was observed for penile 
SCCs (Table 1). Rates of vulvar SCC were lower among blacks 
(1.5) compared with whites (2.1) and among Hispanics (1.3) 
compared with non-Hispanics (2.1). Among females, rates of 
anal SCC were lower among blacks (1.4) than whites (1.9), 
but among males, were higher among blacks (1.5) compared 
with whites (1.1). The rate of anal SCC among Hispanic males 
and females (1.1) was lower than among non-Hispanics (1.5). 
Rates of oropharyngeal SCC in both males and females were 
higher among whites (8.0 and 1.8) compared with blacks (6.9 
and 1.5), and among non-Hispanics (8.0 and 1.8) compared 
with Hispanics (4.2 and 0.9).
By state, overall rates of all HPV-associated cancers com-
bined ranged from 7.5 per 100,000 persons (Utah) to 14.7 
(Kentucky); among females, rates ranged from 9.1 (Utah) 
to 17.0 (Kentucky and West Virginia), and among males, 
rates ranged from 6.0 (Utah) to 12.8 (District of Columbia) 
(Table 2). Most states with overall HPV-associated cancer rates 
that exceeded the U.S. rate (11.7 per 100,000) were located 
in the U.S. Census Southern region,¶ driven by a similar 
pattern in the distribution of the rates of cervical, anal, and 
oropharyngeal cancers. The highest rate of cervical cancer was 
found in Puerto Rico (11.7 per 100,000 females); among the 
states, the lowest was found in Vermont (4.1) and the highest 
in West Virginia (9.9).
By multiplying HPV-associated cancer counts by the percent 
attributable to HPV, 30,700 HPV-associated cancers (79%) 
were estimated to be attributable to HPV (Table 3). Among 
these, 24,600 (80%) were attributable to HPV types 16 and 
18, which can be prevented by the bivalent, quadrivalent and 
9-valent HPV vaccines, and 3,800 (12%) were attributable to

 * Per 100,000 persons; age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.
 † HPV-associated cancers were defined as cancers at specific anatomic sites with specific cell types in which HPV DNA frequently is found. All cancers were confirmed 
histologically. Cervical cancers (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition [ICD-0-3] site codes C53.0–C53.9) are limited to carcinomas (ICD-O-3 
histology codes 8010–8671, 8940–8941). Vaginal (ICD-O-3 site code C52.9), vulvar (ICD-O-3 site codes C51.0–C51.9), penile (ICD-O-3 site codes C60.0–60.9), anal 
(ICD-O-3 site code C21.0–C21.9), rectal (ICD-O-3 site code C20.9), and oropharyngeal (ICD-O-3 site codes C01.9, C02.4, C02.8, C05.1, C05.2, C09.0, C09.1, C09.8, 
C09.9, C10.0, C10.1, C10.2, C10.3, C10.4, C10.8, C10.9, C14.0, C14.2 and C14.8) cancer sites are limited to squamous cell carcinomas (ICD-O-3 histology codes 
8050–8084, 8120–8131).
 § Rates are not presented separately for persons with unknown or other race or unknown ethnicity.
 ¶ Compiled from population-based cancer registries in 49 states and the District of Columbia that participate in the National Program of Cancer Registries, and/or 
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and meet criteria for high-quality data for all five years (2008–2012), covering approximately 99% of the 
U.S. population.
 ** Data suppressed because the total number of cancers for 2008–2012 was <16.

the five additional HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52, 58), which can 
be prevented by the 9-valent HPV vaccine. Among cervical 
carcinoma cases, 7,800 cases were attributable to HPV types 16 
and 18 and 1,700 were attributable to the additional HPV 
types. Among oropharyngeal SCC cases, 9,500 cases were 
attributable to HPV types 16 and 18, and another 900 cases 
were attributable to the additional types.
Discussion
Each year during 2008–2012, an average of 38,793 HPV-
associated cancers were diagnosed, including 23,000 among 
females and 15,793 among males; 79% of these were attrib-
utable to HPV. Compared with a previous analysis, which 
reported 33,369 HPV-associated cancer cases diagnosed each 
year during 2004–2008, the results of this analysis demonstrate 
an overall increase in HPV-associated cancer incidence, from 
10.8 per 100,000 persons during 2004–2008 to 11.7 per 
100,000 persons during 2008–2012, despite a slight decrease 
in the rate of cervical carcinoma (4). Part of this increase is 
because of the inclusion of additional subsites for oropharyn-
geal cancer; however, the increase persisted when these subsites 
were excluded from analysis.  
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices rec-
ommends routine vaccination with any of the available HPV 
vaccines (bivalent, quadrivalent, or 9-valent) for females and 
quadrivalent or 9-valent for males (5). Vaccination is recom-
mended at ages 11–12 years and through age 26 years for 
females and age 21 years for males, if they were not previously 
vaccinated (5). High-income countries have observed a popu-
lation-level impact of HPV vaccination programs, including 
reductions in vaccine type prevalence and rates of anogenital 
warts, most of which are caused by HPV types 6 and 11, two 
types targeted by the quadrivalent and 9-valent HPV vaccines 
(6). Among U.S. adolescent females aged 13–17 years in 2014, 
60.0% received ≥1 dose, 50.3% received ≥2 doses, and 39.7% 
received ≥3 doses; male coverage with ≥1, ≥2, and ≥3 doses 
was 41.7%, 31.4%, and 21.6%, respectively (7). Series initia-
tion was higher among blacks and Hispanics compared with 
whites, and among persons below the poverty level, in both 
male and female U.S. populations. Increasing vaccination 
coverage could decrease the cancer incidence and disparities 
in the United States.
Most cervical cancers are preventable with regular screen-
ing for precancerous lesions among women aged 21–65 years 
linked with follow-up for abnormal test results (8); there are 
currently no effective population-based screening strategies 
for the other HPV-associated cancers. The Healthy People 
2020 target for cervical cancer screening is 93%**; however 
in 2013, only 80.7% of women reported up-to-date cervical 
cancer screening, with even lower rates noted among Asians, 
Hispanics, women aged 51–65 years, foreign-born, uninsured, 
and publicly insured women (9). 
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, although population-based cancer registries provide 
a reliable system for counting invasive cancers, no registry 
routinely collects or reports information on HPV DNA sta-
tus in cancer tissue, so the HPV-attributable cancers are only 
estimates. Second, reporting of race and ethnicity uses data 
from medical records, which might be inaccurate in a small 
proportion of cases.
Of the 38,793 cancers that occurred each year in the United 
States at anatomic sites associated with HPV, approximately 
30,700 can be attributed to HPV. Of these, 24,600 cancers are 
attributable to HPV types 16 and 18, which are included in all 
current HPV vaccines, and 28,500 are attributable to high-risk 
HPV types included in the 9-valent HPV vaccine. Ongoing 
surveillance for HPV-associated cancers using high-quality 
population-based registries is needed to monitor trends in 
cancer incidence that might result from increasing use of HPV 
vaccines and changes in cervical cancer screening practices.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Persistent infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) can 
cause carcinomas of the cervix, and squamous cell cancers of 
the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, rectum, and oropharynx. Many of 
these cancers are preventable with currently available vaccines; 
effective screening programs can identify cervical precancers 
for treatment before they can progress to cancer.
What is added by this report?
An average of 38,793 HPV-associated cancers (11.7 per 
100,000 persons) were diagnosed annually in the United States 
during 2008–2012, including 23,000 (13.5) among females and 
15,793 (9.7) among males. Among these cancers, CDC estimates 
that 30,700 (79%) can be attributed to HPV, and 28,500 of these 
are attributable to HPV types that are preventable with the 
9-valent HPV vaccine.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Full vaccination coverage of the U.S. population could prevent 
future HPV-attributable cancers and potentially reduce racial and 
ethnic disparities in HPV-associated cancer incidence. Ongoing 
surveillance for HPV-associated cancers using high-quality 
population-based registries is needed to monitor trends in cancer 
incidence that might result from increasing use of HPV vaccines 
and changes in cervical cancer screening practices.

Epidemiology, and End Results Program and meet criteria for high-quality data for all five years (2008–2012), covering approximately 99% of the U.S. population.
§ Estimates for attributable fraction were based on studies that used population-based data from cancer tissue to estimate the percentage of those cancers probably 
caused by HPV. The attributable fraction for rectal squamous cell carcinoma was based on the attributable fraction for anal squamous cell carcinoma. The estimated 
number of HPV-attributable cancers was calculated by multiplying the HPV-associated cancer counts by the percentage of each cancer attributable to HPV. Estimates 
were rounded to the nearest 100.  Estimates less than 100 are not presented. Individual counts may not sum to the total count because of rounding.
