On the basis of the abundance of specific bacterial genera, the human gut microbiota can be divided into two relatively stable
groups that might have a role in personalized nutrition. We studied these simplified enterotypes as prognostic markers for
successful body fat loss on two different diets. A total of 62 participants with increased waist circumference were randomly
assigned to receive an ad libitum New Nordic Diet (NND) high in fiber/whole grain or an Average Danish Diet for 26 weeks.
Participants were grouped into two discrete enterotypes by their relative abundance of Prevotella spp. divided by Bacteroides spp.
(P/B ratio) obtained by quantitative PCR analysis. Modifications of dietary effects of pre-treatment P/B group were examined by
linear mixed models. Among individuals with high P/B the NND resulted in a 3.15 kg (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.55; 4.76,
Po0.001) larger body fat loss compared with ADD, whereas no differences was observed among individuals with low P/B (0.88 kg
(95% CI: − 0.61; 2.37, P = 0.25)). Consequently, a 2.27 kg (95% CI: 0.09; 4.45, P = 0.041) difference in responsiveness to the diets were
found between the two groups. In summary, subjects with high P/B ratio appeared more susceptible to lose body fat on diets high
in fiber and whole grain than subjects with a low P/B ratio.

INTRODUCTION
The composition of the gut microbiota in rodents has been shown
to affect the efficacy of energy harvest from feed1 and to influence
the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones affecting appetite.2
Therefore, it seems as if the human gut microbiota has the
potential to have a pivotal role in personalized nutrition.3,4
Clustering of the human gut microbiota, designated entero-
types, was first described in 2011.5 The Bacteroides-driven
enterotype is reported to be predominant in individuals consum-
ing more protein and animal fat (western diet), whereas the
Prevotella-driven enterotype appears predominant in subjects
consuming more carbohydrate and fiber.6–8 That said, the
enterotype of an individual has been shown to remain rather
stable.6,7,9 A limited number of studies have related microbial
enterotypes to health markers;8–10 however, body fat change
during a randomized clinical trial is not one of them.
Therefore, as a proxy for enterotypes, we studied pre-treatment
Prevotella-to-Bacteroides (P/B) ratio as a prognostic marker for
successful body fat loss on two diets differing greatly in dietary
fiber and whole-grain content.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In total 181 participants with increased waist circumference were
randomly assigned to receive an ad libitum New Nordic Diet (NND)
or a control diet for 26 weeks of which a subgroup of 62 subjects
were randomized to collect fecal samples. The macronutrient
composition
of
the
NND
was
based
on
Nordic
Nutrition
Recommendations, whereas the control diet was designed to
match the macronutrient composition of an Average Danish Diet
(ADD).11 The NND is a whole-food approach characterized by
being
very
high
in
dietary
fiber,
whole
grain,
fruit
and
vegetables.12 For both groups, food and beverages were provided
from a study shop free of charge throughout the intervention
period.12 Pre-intervention fasting blood samples were drawn from
where fasting glucose and insulin were analyzed. Height was
measured at baseline and body weight was measured at
randomization and week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 26.
Furthermore, waist circumference and fat mass (using DEXA)
were measured at randomization, week 12 and 26. Fecal samples
were collected at baseline and the relative abundance of
Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp. was determined using
genera-specific quantitative PCR targeting the bacterial 16S
ribosomal gene regions as previously described.9 As previously
reported by Roager et al.,9 this resulted in a clear bimodal
separation of subjects based on the log Prevotella spp. to
Bacteroides spp. ratio, in the following designated low P/B
(o0.01) or high P/B (40.01). In eight samples, Prevotella spp.
was below the detection limit and were classified as low P/B in the
main analysis and excluded in a sensitivity analysis. Regardless of
randomization status, after the completion of the first 26 weeks, all
participants were instructed to follow the NND for an additional
year (weight measured after 52 and 78 weeks) without any
provision of food13 to investigate the diets in a real life setting. The
study was approved by the ethical committee of the Capital
Region of Denmark (reference H-3-2010-058) and registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01195610.

 Statistics
Baseline characteristics were summarized as mean ± s.d., median
(interquartile range) or proportions (%) and differences between
P/B groups as well as dietary groups were tested using a
parametric (some variables transformed before analysis) or non-
parametric two-sample test or Pearson’s χ2 test.
The differences in body fat (as well as weight and waist
circumference) change from baseline between P/B groups on the
two diets were analyzed by means of linear mixed models using
all available measurements. The linear mixed models included the
three-way interaction between diet × time × P/B group strata as
well as all nested two-way interactions and main effects and
comprised additional fixed effects including age, gender, baseline
BMI, baseline fasting glucose and insulin as well as random effects
for subjects. Results are shown as mean change from baseline
with 95% confidence interval (CI). The level of significance was set
at Po0.05 and statistical analyses were conducted using STATA/
SE 14.1 (Houston, TX, USA).
RESULTS
The NND compared to ADD was higher in dietary fiber (43.3 vs
28.6 g/10MJ), higher in protein (18.1 vs 16.4%), lower in fat (30.4 vs
33.8%) (all Po0.001) without differing in available carbohydrates
(46.4 vs 45.3%; P = 0.081).
No differences in baseline characteristics were found between
individuals characterized as high and low P/B (all P ⩾ 0.09)
(Table 1). Among individuals with a high P/B ratio, the NND diet
resulted in a 3.15 kg (95% CI: 1.55; 4.76, Po0.001) larger body fat
loss compared to ADD after 26 weeks, whereas no difference in
body fat loss was observed between NND and ADD among
individuals with low P/B (0.88 kg (95% CI: − 0.61; 2.37, P = 0.25)).
Consequently, a 2.27 kg (95% CI: 0.09; 4.45, P = 0.041) difference in
responsiveness to the diets was found between the P/B groups,
which came from difference in response to NND (P = 0.04) and not
ADD (P = 0.41) between the
P/B groups (Table
2). Similar
differences in responsiveness to the diets were found for waist
circumference (3.95 cm (95% CI: 0.34; 7.55, P = 0.032)) and were
borderline significant for body weight (2.33 kg (95% CI: − 0.15;
4.80, P = 0.065)) (Table 2). The sensitivity analysis revealed larger
differences (Table 2).
During the 1 year follow-up period, subjects with the high P/B
ratio changing from ADD to being recommended NND main-
tained their weight (−1.23 (95% CI: − 2.81; 0.36, n = 9, P = 0.13)),
whereas subjects with the low P/B ratio changing from ADD to
being recommended NND regained 2.76 kg (95% CI: 1.27; 4.24,
n = 11, Po0.001). Consequently, a 3.99 kg (95% CI: 1.82; 6.15,
Po0.001) difference in responsiveness to the NND were found
between P/B groups during the 1 year follow-up. This difference
was 5.41 kg (95% CI: 3.12; 7.69, Po0.001) in the sensitivity
analysis.
DISCUSSION
We identified pre-treatment P/B ratio as an important biomarker
associated with body fat loss in subjects consuming an ad libitum
diet rich in fiber and whole grain. Thus, overweight and obese
participants with high P/B ratio appeared more responsive to fiber
and whole grain than individuals with low P/B ratio. This was
further supported by similar findings for waist circumference and
body weight.
Using the entire sample of 181 subjects, we have previously
reported the overall weight-loss difference between the NND and
ADD to be 3.2 kg.12 Interestingly, this difference between diets
could mainly be attributed to subjects with the high P/B ratio, and
the health-promoting aspects of the NND in terms of body-weight
regulation, therefore, mainly seems to apply in a subset of the
population.
Previously, baseline total cholesterol has been found to be
borderline higher (P = 0.08)9 and LDL cholesterol to be lower8
among the Prevotella-driven enterotype. Furthermore, the enter-
otypes have been found to impact in vitro fermentation profiles of
short chain fatty acids from the same carbohydrate substrates
differentially, with the Prevotella-driven enterotype having higher
total short chain fatty acid production.3 In vitro, some of these
short chain fatty acids have been shown to stimulate the
secretions
of
gastrointestinal
hormones
affecting
appetite.2
Finally, in an observational study of 1632 women, the abundance
of Bacteroides spp. was associated with weight gain, whereas
dietary fiber intake was found partly to modify the association
between microbiome diversity and weight gain.14
The distinction of enterotypes as discrete clusters has recently
been challenged by studies suggesting that enterotype distribu-
tion is continuous and that further information may be masked
within these enterotype clusters.15,16 From our analysis, we cannot
determine specific bacterial species responsible for the dietary
effects that we observe but only highlight the relative abundance
of Prevotella spp. (genus) as important in the classification of
microbiota profiles. Nevertheless, our sensitivity analysis indicates
that subjects with Prevotella spp. below the detection limit behave
different than subjects in the low P/B ratio group.
The increased responsiveness of the high P/B group to the NND,
rich in fruits, vegetables, dietary fibers and whole grains, is
supported by previous studies showing an association between
the Prevotella-driven enterotype and a carbohydrate-based diet
more typical of agrarian societies.6 However, only two individuals
switched P/B ratio group during this 6-month dietary intervention
with NND or ADD,9 which is consistent with the literature

Intestinal microbial genera determine responsiveness to diets

 indicating that intestinal microbial communities are resilient and
difficult to change through dietary interventions6,7,9 unless
extreme changes, such as complete removal of carbohydrates
from the diet, are introduced.17
Mechanisms involved could be efficacy of energy harvest from
different foods,1 differences in fiber-utilization capacity,3 gut-brain
signaling of behavior18 and the secretion of gastrointestinal
hormones affecting appetite.2,10 Recently, dietary fiber-induced
improvements in post-prandial blood glucose and insulin were
found to be positively associated with the abundance of
Prevotella.19 Therefore, the recent breakthrough in personalized
nutrition, showing the importance of pre-treatment fasting
glucose and insulin to determine the optimal diet for weight
management,20 might also be linked to gut microbiota profiles.
We therefore adjusted for a number of potential confounders
including fasting glucose and insulin. However, independent of
the mechanisms, the P/B ratio may serve as a biomarker to predict
future weight-loss success on specific diets.
In summary, we identified pre-treatment P/B ratio as an
important biomarker associated with dietary body fat change on
ad libitum high fiber diets. Thus, individuals with a high P/B ratio
were more susceptible to body fat loss on a diet rich in fiber and
whole grain compared to an average Danish diet, whereas no
difference in body fat loss was observed in individuals with a low
P/B ratio.
