Patients and Physicians Beliefs and Practices Regarding
Adherence to Cardiovascular Medication
Rosemary Hines, BA; Neil J. Stone, MD
IMPORTANCE Nonadherence to medication is a salient cause of poor outcomes of health care
and a primary driver of growing health care costs. Little is known about physician
communication with patients regarding their adherence to cardioprotective medication.
OBJECTIVE To identify patients’and physicians’beliefs and practices regarding discussions of
adherence to cardioprotective medication.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Paired patient and physician questionnaires were
developed based on the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and administered to 2
academic and 2 community-based cardiology practices in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan
and suburban areas from June 2 to July 22, 2015. Twenty-one cardiologists and 66 of their
outpatients 18 years and older participated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patient and physician beliefs about discussions of
adherence to medication, the frequency of such discussions, and physician recognition of
patients who are nonadherent to medication.
RESULTS A total of 21 physicians (5 [24%] women) and 66 patients (23 [35%] women; mean
age, 71.6 years) participated in the study. Forty (61%) patients reported rarely or never
discussing their adherence to medication with their physicians. Of these patients, 8 (13%) had
poor adherence and 36 (55%) had moderate adherence. Only 1 of the physicians of the
patients with the poorest adherence correctly identified a patient as being poorly adherent.
Fourteen physicians (67%) disagreed with the statement, “I am aware of how often my
patient misses a dose of medication.” By contrast, all of the physicians agreed that it is
important for them to discuss adherence to medication with their patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Physicians acknowledge the importance of discussing
adherence to medication with their patients, yet for many reasons these discussions are
uncommon. More important, our study found a notable failure by cardiologists to correctly
recognize which of their patients were nonadherent. The novel design of our research
identified an important yet neglected aspect of clinical practice. We recommend that
physicians include a highly specific question about adherence to medication at every patient
visit.

Several studies have identified varied reasons for nonad-
herence to medication, ranging from prohibitive medication
costs and a fear of adverse effects to misunderstandings of the
benefits of medication.4,5 In 2015, Rosenbaum6 cited the lack
ofimmediate,conspicuousbenefitsofamedicationforchronic
disease, such as a statin for reducing blood cholesterol concen-
trations and the formation of a “sick identity” among patients
taking a medication, as 2 principal causes of nonadherence to
its prescribed use.
A burgeoning field of multifaceted interventions de-
signed to reduce nonadherence to medication has emerged in
recent years. Although researchers have developed several in-
terventions and programs, to our knowledge, no single inter-
vention strategy has proven effective across all patients and
healthsystems.Toimproveadherence,patient-physiciancom-
munication regarding adherence to cardioprotective medica-
tions must be explored. We sought to identify patients’and
physicians’beliefs and practices regarding discussions of ad-
herence to cardioprotective medication.
Methods
Toidentifypatients’andphysicians’beliefsandpracticesabout
discussions on adherence to cardioprotective medication, we
conducted a survey-based study of 2 academic and 2 commu-
nity-based cardiology practices in the Chicago, Illinois, met-
ropolitan and suburban areas from June 2 to July 22, 2015. Phy-
sicians were contacted via telephone and told that the general
goal of the study was “to understand an important aspect of
patient-physician communication,
” but were not told the spe-
cific aims of the study. The same interviewer for the study at-
tended a morning or afternoon session of each participating
physician’
s practice and invited consecutive patients to com-
plete a short, orally administered survey following the pa-
tient’
s visit. The study included all patients 18 years or older
who were taking a cardioprotective medication and excluded
patients who did not speak English. A script was used to ob-
tain oral informed consent from patients and physicians par-
ticipatinginthestudy.TheInstitutionalReviewBoardatNorth-
western University, Feinberg School of Medicine, approved the
study protocol, and strict measures were taken to protect par-
ticipant confidentiality.
We developed patient and physician questionnaires based
on the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8).
In addition to recording basic demographic and medical infor-
mation,thepatientquestionnaireincludedquestionsabouthow
often the patient fails to take a dose of medication, how often
the patient discusses adherence with the patient’
s physician,
andtheprimaryreasonsfornonadherence.Thephysicianques-
tionnaire included questions about the physician’
s impression
ofeachpatient’
sadherence,thefrequencywithwhichthephy-
siciandiscussesadherencewiththatpatient,andthephysician’
s
understanding of why adherence may be a challenge.
We defined our primary outcome variable as patients’re-
porting having discussed adherence with their physician. We
defined our secondary outcome variable as physicians’rec-
ognition of patients with poor adherence to medication.
Results
The characteristics of the 21 physicians and 66 patients who
participated in the study are found in Table 1 and Table 2. Forty
patients (61%) reported rarely or never discussing their medi-
cation adherence with their physician. Of those 40 patients,
18(45%)saidthattheysometimesorusuallyforgottotaketheir
medicationand4(10%)reportedhavingmissed1ormoredoses
of medication in the past 2 weeks. On the basis of MMAS-8
scores, 8 of the 66 patients in the study (12%) had poor adher-
ence and 36 (55%) had moderate adherence. Of the 8 patients
with the poorest adherence, only 1 (13%) was correctly iden-
tified by the patient’
s physician as poorly adherent.
Fourteen of the 21 physicians (67%) disagreed or strongly
disagreed with the statement, “I am aware of how often my
patient misses a dose of medication.
” All 21 physicians (100%)
agreed with the statement, “It is important for me to discuss
medication adherence with my patient.” Eight of the 21 phy-
sicians (38%) reported that there were times that they wanted
to discuss adherence with a patient without having done so.
Of these 8 physicians, 5 (63%) cited time as the greatest bar-
rier to such discussions and 3 (38%) reported believing that
their patient had more important problems to be addressed.
Discussion
We used a novel design that allowed us to determine whether
physicians discuss adherence to regimens of cardioprotec-
tive medication with their patients routinely, and more im-
portant,whethertheywereabletorecognize,duringtheirvisit,
Key Points
Question What is the frequency of cardiologists’discussions with
patients regarding their adherence to cardiovascular medications?
Findings In this survey study, 67% of patients reported rarely or
never discussing their adherence to medication with their
cardiologists. Only 1 cardiologist of the 13% of patients with the
least adherence correctly identified a patient as having poor
adherence.
Meaning To address the failure of cardiologists in our study to
identify poor adherence, we recommend that they ask highly
specific questions about adherence, such as “How many heart
drugs have you missed in the last 30 days?” at every patient visit.

which of their patients were nonadherent.7 We found that phy-
sicians acknowledge the importance of discussing adherence
tomedicationwiththeirpatients,butthatinpracticethesedis-
cussions are infrequent (eTable in the Supplement). Further-
more, we found that the physicians in our study were fre-
quently unable to recognize which of their patients were
nonadherent.
Implications
Our findings are in accord with several reports regarding poor
adherence to cardiovascular medication, and our study, al-
beit brief, has important implications for patients and physi-
cians. The lack of recognition of poor adherence could result
both in suboptimal treatment and the potential for the use of
additional medications to improve a patient’
s risk-factor pro-
file. We were impressed to learn that the situation we uncov-
ered could be addressed with a single, direct question such as,
“How many of your heart drugs have you missed in the past
30 days?” Although the degree of acuity of a patient’
s prob-
lem and the limitations of time are always present in patient-
physician encounters, the physician’
s inclusion of a detailed
question about adherence to medication would add only a few
seconds to a patient’
s visit, and it has the potential to provide
clinically useful information.
Weacknowledgethatasingledetailedquestionaboutapa-
tient’
s adherence to a medication regimen cannot address all
of the issues related to such adherence. However, it provides
a useful way to begin recognizing unsuspected poor adher-
ence. It may be especially valuable in cases in which a patient
with previously good adherence misses taking medications for
reasons such as changed insurance coverage or travel. A pa-
tient’
s missing of medication for heart failure, elevated blood
pressure, or an elevated blood cholesterol concentration in the
past 30 days before a visit may in great part explain abnor-
malities observed during the visit, and which may be by-
passed if other issues require immediate attention. More-
over, a detailed question about adherence to medication may
prevent the addition of medications to a patient’
s treatment
regimen when all that is needed is better adherence to the pa-
tient’
s existing regimen.
Limitations
Our brief study had several limitations. First, we examined a
group of cardiologists and their patients in only a single met-
ropolitan and suburban area of the United States. Second, the
size of our sample was small. Further work is needed to as-
sess the generalizability of our results. Third, our findings are
based on self-reports. Recall bias and socially desirable re-
sponse bias are 2 concerns in respondents’replies to ques-
tions about their behavior. Fourth, a more detailed evalua-
tion of comorbidity, especially depression, a wider range of
patient ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and interviews
with physicians other than cardiologists would make our re-
sults more generally applicable to the medical community. A
larger study for determining the utility of a more specific ques-
tion about adherence to medication, and which takes into ac-
count issues other than those included in our study, would be
both useful and informative. Last, our study design did not ex-
amine the content of patient-physician discussions about ad-
herence to medication or examine how often physicians con-
sider patients’adherence without directly discussing these
concerns.
Conclusions
Through a novel approach that involves interviewing both
patients and physicians in an outpatient setting, our study
corroborates prior data indicating poor patient adherence to
