RESEARCH
Effects on abstinence of nicotine patch treatment before quitting 
smoking: parallel, two arm, pragmatic randomised trial
The Preloading Investigators
Abstract
Objective
To examine the effectiveness of a nicotine patch worn 
for four weeks before a quit attempt.
Design
Randomised controlled open label trial.
Setting
Primary care and smoking cessation clinics in 
England, 2012-15.
Participants
1792 adults who were daily smokers with tobacco 
dependence. 899 were allocated to the preloading 
arm and 893 to the control arm.
Interventions
Participants were randomised 1:1, using concealed 
randomly permuted blocks stratified by centre, to 
either standard smoking cessation pharmacotherapy 
and behavioural support or the same treatment 
supplemented by four weeks of 21 mg nicotine patch 
use before quitting: “preloading.”
Main outcome measures
The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed 
prolonged abstinence at six months. Secondary 
outcomes were prolonged abstinence at four weeks 
and 12 months.
Results
Biochemically validated abstinence at six months 
was achieved by 157/899 (17.5%) participants in the 
preloading arm and 129/893 (14.4%) in the control 
arm: difference 3.0% (95% confidence interval −0.4% 
to 6.4%), odds ratio 1.25 (95% confidence interval 
0.97 to 1.62), P=0.08 in the primary analysis. There 
was an imbalance between arms in the frequency 
of varenicline use as post-cessation treatment, and 
planned adjustment for this gave an odds ratio for 
the effect of preloading of 1.34 (95% confidence 
interval 1.03 to 1.73), P=0.03: difference 3.8% (0.4% 
to 7.2%). At four weeks, the difference in prolonged 
abstinence unadjusted for varenicline use was odds 
ratio 1.21 (1.00 to 1.48), difference 4.3% (0.0% to 
8.7%), P=0.05, and adjusted for varenicline use was 
1.32 (1.08 to 1.62) P=0.007. At 12 months the odds 
ratio was 1.28 (0.97 to 1.69), difference 2.7% (−0.4% 
to 5.8%), P=0.09 unadjusted for varenicline use and 
after adjustment was 1.36 (1.02 to 1.80) P=0.04. 
5.9% of participants discontinued preloading owing 
to intolerance. Gastrointestinal symptoms—chiefly 
nausea—occurred in 4.0% (2.2% to 5.9%) more 
people in the preloading arm than control arm. Eight 
serious adverse events occurred in the preloading arm 
and eight in the control arm (odds ratio 0.99, 0.36 to 
2.75).
Conclusions
Evidence was insufficient to confidently show that 
nicotine preloading increases subsequent smoking 
abstinence. The beneficial effect seems to have 
been masked by a concurrent reduction in the use of 
varenicline in people using nicotine preloading, and 
future studies should explore ways to mitigate this 
unintended effect.
Introduction
Although there have been several new drugs for tobacco 
cessation since the 1970s, the paradigm of treatment 
has remained largely the same, with no major advances 
in success rates. Treatment comprises behavioural 
support to motivate and strengthen a person’s resolve 
to remain abstinent and drugs to reduce the strength of 
urges to smoke after quit day.
Most adult smokers want to stop smoking but 
continue because they have developed a drive to 
smoke. Repeated pairing of smoking behaviour with 
stimulation of cholinergic receptors in the midbrain 
that project to the nucleus accumbens is an important 
factor contributing to this drive.1 The urge to smoke 
can remain largely unconscious, but when a smoker 
decides to quit a craving is experienced, typically in 
response to moods or situations when smoking would 
normally have occurred. These cravings undermine 
the success of most quit attempts.2 Effective smoking 
cessation drugs exert their effect by reducing the 
intensity of cravings, and the most effective drug 
currently available, varenicline, does so to the greatest 
extent.3 In people who resist the craving, repeated 
exposure to cues to smoke without actually smoking 
and the concomitant delivery of nicotine from a 
cigarette will mean the drive to smoke is unlearnt and 
craving intensity decreases.
If smoking occurs without the reinforcement 
provided by nicotinic stimulation, the drive to smoke 
should diminish and, when a smoker attempts to

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy is recommended in the period after a quit 
day
A 2011 meta-analysis reported that using pharmacotherapy before quit day may 
increase abstinence, but the data were heterogeneous and evidence of long term 
benefit was not clear
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
In this trial conducted in a routine health service context, there was no clear 
evidence that using nicotine patches for four weeks before quit improved long 
term abstinence
The benefit of preloading, however, may have been masked by reduced use 
of varenicline in people allocated to preloading, which, being more effective, 
reduced the overall benefit
After adjusting for this effect, evidence of possible effectiveness was clearer

quit, they should experience less intense craving and 
be more likely to succeed. One way to block the effect 
of nicotine from cigarettes is to use a nicotine patch. 
Doing so desensitises the cholinergic brain receptors, 
meaning they are refractory to further stimulation 
from cigarette supplied nicotine.4 This should reduce 
the intensity of the urge to smoke while smoking and, 
crucially, lowered dependence will reduce craving 
intensity if someone makes a quit attempt, facilitating 
abstinence.
Using a nicotine replacement treatment (or other 
smoking cessation drugs) before a quit attempt while 
smoking normally is called preloading. A systematic 
review showed some, but not convincing, evidence 
that nicotine preloading may be effective, with much 
unexplained heterogeneity between studies.5 Some 
studies suggested that nicotine preloading doubled 
the likelihood of achieving abstinence, which, if true, 
suggests that using nicotine replacement therapy 
before a quit attempt is more effective than when used in 
the conventional way to support smoking abstinence.6 
Other studies suggested preloading had no effect. A 
partial explanation for the heterogeneity may relate 
to the form of nicotine replacement used. Smoking 
while using patches produces higher blood nicotine 
concentrations than just smoking, but smoking while 
using short acting nicotine replacement therapy, such 
as gum, does not.7 There was some but not strong 
evidence in the review that preloading using a nicotine 
patch was more effective than preloading with oral 
nicotine replacement therapy. Since then, three more 
studies using varenicline and bupropion preloading 
have been conducted, with some evidence of a benefit 
on short term cessation.8-10 These studies are relevant 
because they examine the same hypothetical active 
ingredient of the preloading interventions as studies 
of nicotine replacement therapy—that is, the effects 
of reduced satisfaction from smoking. Together, these 
studies have provided modest support that preloading 
works through reducing the intensity of urges to 
smoke.78-12
Given the promise and uncertainty around this 
novel approach to treating tobacco dependence, we 
conducted a large trial in a routine health service 
context to examine the impact of nicotine replacement 
therapy preloading on long term abstinence and 
mechanisms of its action.
Methods
This was an open label multicentre pragmatic 
superiority trial, with participants randomised 1:1 to 
receive or not receive a nicotine patch to use for four 
weeks before quit day. Thereafter the participants 
used standard pharmacotherapy and behavioural 
support to support cessation. The primary outcome 
was prolonged biochemically validated abstinence 
measured six months after quitting. The protocol is 
published and was implemented with one change11; 
we asked participants who had moved house and were 
unable to attend in person to return a supplied saliva 
swab to measure cotinine or anabasine concentrations 
to confirm abstinence. The planned cost effectiveness 
analysis will be presented separately.
Participants and settings
In three recruitment centres, based in Nottingham, 
Birmingham, and Bristol, general practitioners spoke 
or wrote to, emailed, or texted patients listed as 
smokers on the electronic health record and invited 
them to join the trial as a means to stop smoking. The 
fourth recruitment centre, in London, was an existing 
National Health Service smoking cessation clinic and 
invited patients seeking treatment to participate in the 
trial.
Potential participants telephoned the research team 
to learn more about the trial and were screened for 
eligibility. If they seemed to be eligible and wanted to 
participate, we booked them in for an appointment at 
their general practice or smoking cessation clinic to 
meet the researcher, and we sent them an information 
sheet. At this initial appointment, we again described 
the trial and obtained consent.
Potential participants were eligible for the study if 
they regularly smoked cigarettes, cigars, or roll-up 
tobacco cigarettes, with or without marijuana; were 
aged 18 years or more; would be suitable for preloading 
according to researcher’s judgment; were seeking 
support to stop smoking from the NHS stop smoking 
service; were willing to set a quit day in four weeks; and 
were able to understand and willing to adhere to study 
procedures. We excluded those who were pregnant 
or breast feeding; had skin disorders that precluded 
use of the patch; had acute coronary syndrome or 
stroke in the past three weeks; and had an active 
phaeocromocytoma or uncontrolled hyperthyroidism 
that would increase the risk of arrhythmias from the 
nicotine patch.
To determine suitability for preloading we used 
several criteria with no cut-offs to assess whether 
potential participants were addicted to smoking: 
failure of previous quit attempts despite use of 
appropriate pharmacotherapy; time to first cigarette 
in the morning, with earlier use reflecting higher 
addiction; number of cigarettes smoked daily, with 
a greater number reflecting higher addiction; and 
exhaled carbon monoxide concentration, with higher 
values reflecting higher addiction.
Interventions
Preloading arm
We asked participants in the preloading arm to use 
a 21 mg/24 h nicotine patch daily for approximately 
four weeks before quit day. If participants had had 
problems with overnight use in previous quit attempts, 
we advised wearing the patch in waking hours only.
We asked participants to smoke as normal and not 
reduce consumption. Reduced consumption would 
probably lower blood nicotine concentration, which 
could make cigarettes more rewarding and thus 
undermine the supposed benefits of preloading.13
Participants in both arms were referred to the NHS 
stop smoking service for continuing support with

cessation. We asked participants and the NHS advisors 
by letter and in person to set a quit date between 
three and five weeks after commencing preloading. 
We allowed that preloading could continue for up to 
eight weeks in exceptional circumstances, and also 
that preloading could restart once—for example, if 
preloading was interrupted because the participant 
was admitted to hospital. In such cases, participants 
aimed to complete three to five weeks of preloading 
from the date of recommencement.
At the first visit the researcher explained the 
rationale of preloading and prompted action planning 
to maximise adherence to the patches. The researcher 
addressed participants’ concerns about smoking 
while using patches and advised on how to manage 
side effects. The researcher talked through the 
participant’s daily routine and noted opportunities 
to use environmental cues to minimise the chance of 
forgetting to apply the patch daily. To reinforce this, 
we provided a booklet with the same information. 
Participants commenced preloading at this visit and 
we reviewed them one week later to deal with concerns 
and reinforce adherence.
We offered participants lower strength patches at 
commencement if they reported previous adverse 
reactions to the 21 mg patch, or during the treatment 
course if they experienced symptoms of nicotine 
overdose such as nausea, salivation, and pounding 
heart. Preloading was stopped if requested by 
participants, it was not possible to alleviate adverse 
events by reducing the dose, or an intervening health 
state or contraindication to preloading emerged.
Control arm
We aimed to balance participants’ expectations of 
success and to assess adverse events in an unbiased 
way. A placebo would have achieved this but owing 
to funding restrictions we developed a behavioural 
intervention. We asked participants to consider their 
smoking pattern, to consider the triggers for use of 
particular cigarettes, and to plan ways to reduce these 
cues. This is standard in smoking cessation support 
anyway, so participants in the preloading arm may 
well have done this later when they enrolled in their 
NHS stop smoking service. Participants in the control 
arm received a booklet outlining this process, which 
was similar in length and appearance to the booklet 
supplied to participants in the preloading arm. As in 
the preloading arm, participants in the control arm 
attended and received this support at baseline and 
one week later and were also referred to the NHS stop 
smoking service to commence a quit attempt between 
three and five weeks after enrolment.
Standard smoking cessation treatment
At the first and second visits in both arms, we referred 
participants to their local stop smoking service, and we 
wrote a letter to the advisors to ask them to encourage 
participants to continue preloading. We asked advisors 
to ignore the presence or absence of nicotine patch 
treatment when choosing pharmacotherapy to support 
the quit attempt. We were concerned that NICE guidance 
recommends against the concurrent use of nicotine 
replacement therapy and varenicline (which is started a 
week before quit day),14 which advisors often assumed 
was because of issues around safety. We tried to correct 
misconceptions in the referral letter, by telephone, and 
face-to-face discussions with clinicians.
The advisors from NHS stop smoking service 
provided weekly behavioural support starting one 
or two weeks before quit day and continuing until at 
least four weeks after quit day, and they encouraged 
participants to maintain total abstinence from quit 
day onwards. This support involves planning for the 
quit day; explanation of how occasional lapses can 
undermine quitting; encouragement to adopt a “not 
a puff” rule; supervision and facilitation of drug 
use; advice on and how to deal with temptations to 
smoke; and monitoring of abstinence through carbon 
monoxide testing. The support is termed withdrawal 
oriented therapy.15
Measures and outcomes
At baseline we recorded participants’ smoking history 
and basic demographic information. This included 
two markers of cigarette dependence: the Fagerstrom 
test for cigarette dependence, which measures 
consumption of cigarettes and difficulty in refraining 
from smoking, and the concentration of exhaled 
carbon monoxide.16
We followed-up participants on five occasions. 
Participants returned one week after the baseline 
appointment for the −3 week appointment (about 
three weeks before quit day). Occurrence of adverse 
events and adherence to preloading was assessed. 
We telephoned participants one week after quit day 
(+1 week), about six weeks after baseline, to collect 
data on adverse events, adherence to preloading, 
and use of and adherence to other smoking cessation 
pharmacotherapy. We obtained data on smoking 
cessation from the NHS stop smoking service or the 
participant at +4 weeks. At six and 12 months we 
telephoned participants to obtain data on smoking 
status and health service use. To confirm abstinence 
biochemically we invited participants who were 
abstinent to attend to measure the concentration 
of carbon monoxide in end expiratory air using a 
handheld device.
Primary outcome and secondary outcomes
The primary outcome was prolonged abstinence at six 
months, defined by the Russell standard criteria.17 This 
allows a grace period of two weeks after quit day, when 
lapses do not count against abstinence. Thereafter we 
counted a person as abstinent if they smoked fewer 
than five cigarettes to the assessment at six months 
and were confirmed as abstinent if an exhaled carbon 
monoxide concentration was <10 ppm.

The secondary outcomes were Russell standard 
abstinence at four weeks and 12 months, and 
biochemically confirmed seven day point prevalence 
abstinence at four weeks and six and 12 months.
Intensity of urges to smoke
As the principal hypothesised mechanism of action is 
that preloading undermines the intensity of urges to 
smoke, we examined the effect of preloading on this, 
measured at −3 weeks (while using preloading or as 
control) and at +1 week after quit day using the mood 
and physical symptom scale-craving subscale (scored 
0-5, with higher scores representing more severe 
symptoms). In the latter assessment, in accord with 
consensus,18 the analysis was confined to those who 
were abstinent or still trying to achieve abstinence.
Adverse events
Adverse events were defined as newly occurring health 
conditions or exacerbations of existing conditions. We 
recorded adverse events that were either serious or of 
moderate or severe intensity between baseline and one 
week after quit day, covering the period of preloading 
and allowing one additional week for adverse events 
to emerge. Moderate or severe adverse events were 
defined as those that interfered somewhat or totally 
with normal functioning. Serious adverse events were 
defined as resulting in admission to hospital, death 
or life threatening events, permanent disability, or 
congenital abnormality. This excluded planned events, 
such as scheduled surgery. An independent committee 
assessed serious adverse events and adjudicated 
whether the event was unrelated, unlikely, possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the use of nicotine 
patches. The committee members were blind to 
treatment allocation and hence also the temporal 
relation of drug use to the event.
We elicited adverse events from participants in both 
arms at contacts −3 weeks and at +1 week by asking 
about new or worsening health problems, followed 
by further inquiry as appropriate. These were coded 
using MedDRA v19.1. As it can be hard for trial staff
 
and participants to understand the necessity to report 
adverse events for people in the control arm receiving 
no treatment, we also gave participants in both arms 
a questionnaire to complete about symptoms. This 
assessed symptoms of nicotine overdose in the previous 
24 hours (such as nausea, excessive salivation) one 
week after baseline. Participants rated how troubled 
they had been by the symptoms in the past 24 hours 
on a scale from “not at all” to “very” or “extremely.”
Sample size, randomisation, and blinding
Based on data from similar trials we estimated that 
15% of participants in the control arm would achieve 
abstinence at six months.19-21 We thought that a 
relative risk of 1.4 was both plausible and valuable for 
patients, implying a 6% absolute difference.5 This gave 
us a sample size of 893 in each study arm or 1786 in 
total, to achieve 90% power using χ2 test with Yates’ 
correction.
An independent statistician used Stata to generate 
a randomisation list stratified by treatment centre 
and using randomly permuted blocks of varying size 
in a 1:1 ratio. This was incorporated into an online 
database, and the sequence remained concealed from 
research staff until they had entered data to allow 
randomisation.
This was an open label trial so participants, research 
staff, and NHS stop smoking service staff knew the arm 
to which participants were assigned. Blinded follow-
up was impractical because staff had been involved 
in recruitment, but abstinence was biochemically 
confirmed.
Statistical analysis
We followed the Russell standard approach to perform 
an intention to treat analysis for the abstinence 
outcome.17 Everyone randomised was included in 
the denominator, whenever and however smoking 
abstinence was assessed, and they were presumed to 
be smoking if this information was unknown. In the 
primary analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios 
using multivariable logistic regression in Stata 14.2 
adjusted for the stratification variable (centre). We also 
calculated the percentage of participants achieving 
abstinence, the risk difference and risk ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals using the post-estimation adjrr 
procedure in Stata v14.2.
In planned sensitivity analysis, we adjusted for two 
predictors of abstinence to improve precision: longest 
previous abstinence and degree of addiction measured 
by strength of urges to smoke at baseline.22-24 
Secondly, varenicline is more effective than other 
pharmacotherapy and is commonly used to assist 
with cessation.25 As we anticipated that using nicotine 
preloading in an open label trial could deter use of 
varenicline, we adjusted for use of varenicline after 
quit day to overcome confounding.
We planned subgroup analyses by including 
multiplicative interaction terms in the equations. 
The presumed mechanism of action of preloading 
suggests greater benefit from preloading in people 
more dependent on cigarettes. We used two markers 
of dependence: baseline Fagerstrom test for cigarette 
dependence score and exhaled carbon monoxide 
concentration added as continuous terms. We also 
examined whether the effect of preloading was less 
pronounced in participants using varenicline. Normal 
use of varenicline involves a week of use before quit 
day and there is evidence that this may have similar 
effects to preloading, which could undermine the 
effect of nicotine preloading.8
Using a linear regression model with adjustment for 
baseline mood and physical symptom scale-craving 
subscale score and stratification variables, we analysed 
the effect of preloading on urge to smoke (mood and 
physical symptom scale-craving subscale).
The denominator for analysis of adverse events 
was all those who provided data on such events. The 
analysis used analogous statistical models to those 
applied for the primary and secondary outcomes.

Patient involvement
The idea for the study and the proposed methods were 
discussed by us in a meeting with the UK Centre for 
Tobacco and Alcohol Studies smokers panel. This 
panel is a standing group of people who smoke or have 
recently stopped smoking, and they agreed the study 
was valuable and gave views on the design that shaped 
the protocol. After early initial slow recruitment, we 
returned to eight members of the panel to discuss 
the letter from general practitioners to potential 
participants and participant information leaflet and 
made some minor amendments as a result. One 
member of the panel also served on the independent 
trial steering committee.
Results
Between 13 August 2012 and 10 March 2015, 3837 
people were telephoned about enrolment. In total, 
490 (12.8%) were ineligible, most commonly owing 
to skin problems or unwillingness to use preloading 
patches. Of 1805 (47.0%) patients seen at the initial 
appointment, 1792 (99.3%) were eligible and enrolled 
(fig 1).
One week after baseline we followed-up 1702 
(95.0%) participants, and five weeks after baseline, 
one week after quit day, we obtained data from 1456 
(81.3%) participants. These assessments provided 
data on adverse events.
We obtained abstinence data on 1585 (88.5%) 
participants at four weeks, 1461 (81.5%) at six months, 
and 1389 (77.5%) at 12 months. A similar proportion 
was successfully followed in each arm. Although 331 
(18.5%) participants were not available for the primary 
outcome assessment at six months, we knew that 97 
were smoking at four weeks and that 54 never made 
a quit attempt; thus neither group could be classified 
as abstinent at six months. We were therefore certain 
of the primary outcome in 1612 (90.0%) participants.
Baseline characteristics
Most participants were middle aged, half were men, 
and a quarter were from minority ethnic groups. 
The participants had lower levels of educational 
attainment than the UK average,26 and half were 
employed. Participants smoked a mean of 18.9 (SD 
9.3) cigarettes/day at baseline, and had a mean 
dependence score indicating moderate addiction and a 
mean exhaled carbon monoxide concentration of 23.7 
(SD 12.5) ppm. A third had used behavioural support 
or pharmacotherapy to try to quit in the past six 
months. Baseline characteristics were well balanced 
between trial arms (table 1). The main predictors 
of abstinence are markers of cigarette dependence, 
such as the Fagerstrom test for cigarette dependence 
and exhaled carbon monoxide concentration, and 
these were almost the same between arms. Likewise, 
demographic variables were balanced, with mean 
age differing between arms by around a third of a 
year, the same proportion of males, and the same 
proportion of people from ethnic groups who were 
not white British. Education and employment were 
also balanced between trial arm, with less than 2% 
difference between the proportions in any category of 
these variables. The biggest difference appeared in the 
proportion of people who had used cessation aids in 
the past six months: 31.0% in the preloading arm and 
34.0% in the control arm.
Drug adherence in preloading arm
Three quarters of participants used the patch daily 
during the first week and four fifths did so in the 
subsequent weeks. Overall, 49 (5.5%) people 
prematurely discontinued preloading; most during the 
first week of treatment.
We assessed drug used after quit day to support 
abstinence in those making a quit attempt (table 2). 
Nicotine patch use was more common in the preloading 
arm and varenicline use more common in the control 
arm.
Primary outcome and secondary outcomes
The 
primary 
outcome, 
biochemically 
validated 
abstinence at six months, was achieved by 157/899 
(17.5%) of participants in the preloading arm and 
129/893 (14.4%) in the control arm, a difference of 
3.0% (95% confidence interval −0.4% to 6.4%).
The secondary outcomes showed similar modest 
differences. 
At 
four 
weeks, 
319/899 
(35.5%) 
participants in the preloading arm and 288/893 
(32.3%) in the control arm achieved seven day 
point prevalence. At 12 months, 126/899 (14.0%) 
participants in the preloading arm and 101/893 
(11.3%) in the control arm achieved validated 
prolonged abstinence. Table 3 presents the primary 
and secondary outcomes adjusted for centre—that is, 
the primary analysis.
Adjustment for other predictors of abstinence left 
the results essentially unchanged, but adjustment for 
the use of post-quit day varenicline changed the results 
noticeably; the unadjusted results were statistically 
significant at four weeks and at six and 12 months. The 
odds ratio increased from 1.25 (0.97 to 1.62) to 1.34 
(1.03 to 1.73), P=0.03 for the primary outcome (table 
4 and supplementary table 1).
Subgroup analysis
There was no evidence that people who were classified 
as more dependent on smoking received a greater 
benefit from preloading. The P values for multiplicative 
interaction terms for the effect of preloading in those 
with higher dependence scores and higher exhaled 
carbon monoxide concentrations were 0.83 and 0.17, 
respectively. Per unit increase in each variable, the 
odds ratios were 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 
1.14) and 1.01 (0.99 to 1.04), respectively.
There was no evidence that people who used 
varenicline as their post-cessation drug received less 
benefit from nicotine preloading than people using 
other cessation drugs. The odds ratios for the effect 
of preloading compared with control for users of 
varenicline was 1.42 (0.90 to 2.26) and for non-users 
was 1.30 (0.95 to 1.77), P=0.74 for the interaction.

Effect of preloading on urge to smoke
One week into preloading or as control, the urge to 
smoke had decreased in people using preloading. The 
mean score on the mood and physical symptom scale-
craving subscale at −3 weeks was 2.1 (SD 0.8) for 
the preloading arm and 2.6 (0.9) for the control arm: 
baseline adjusted difference −0.5 (95% confidence 
interval −0.6 to −0.4). One week after quit day, in those 
who were abstinent, scores on the mood and physical 
symptom scale-craving subscale were 1.0 (1.0) for 
the preloading arm and 1.3 (1.0) for the control arm, 
difference −0.3 (−0.4 to −0.1) and for those who were 
still trying to achieve abstinence, the corresponding 
values were 1.3 (1.1), 1.5 (1.1), difference −0.2 (−0.4 
to −0.1).
Adverse events
Spontaneously reported adverse events of moderate 
or severe intensity were uncommon in both arms. 
There were eight system or organ class groups where 
at least 10 participants reported one symptom within 
that group. Of these, gastrointestinal disorders, 
general disorders, and nervous system disorders 
were statistically significantly more common in those 
using preloading, with absolute differences of 4.0% 
(2.2% to 5.9%), 2.1% (0.7% to 3.5%), and 4.5% 
(2.7% to 6.4%), respectively. There were 15 individual 
symptoms where at least five participants reported 
that symptom. Of these, nausea occurred in 2.5% 
(1.1% to 3.8%) more people who were preloading, and 
vomiting in 1.2% (0.3% to 2.2%). Fatigue was also 
more common in people preloading, by 0.7% (0.1% 
to 1.2%), as were well recognised adverse effects of 
nicotine patches—namely, abnormal dreams 0.9% 
(0.2% to 1.6%), poor sleep 1.9% (0.9% to 3.0%), and 
headaches 1.2% (0.3% to 2.2%). Supplementary table 
2 presents the full results.
Sixteen serious adverse events occurred during the 
five week period: eight in the preloading arm and eight 
in the control arm (odds ratio 0.99, 95% confidence 
interval 0.36 to 2.75). Of these, one was judged 
possibly due to preloading: a 64 year old woman in the 
preloading arm who had an acute coronary syndrome 
(see supplementary table 3).
One week after baseline, 394 (45.5%) participants in 
the preloading arm and 271 (32.4%) in the control arm 
reported at least one symptom of nicotine excess on the 
symptom questionnaire (P<0.001 for the difference). Of 
the 12 symptoms, three were statistically significantly 
more common in the preloading arm: nausea, dizziness, 
and palpitations. Of these symptoms, the percentages 
in intervention and control arms with somewhat or 
very noticeable symptoms were 5.6% and 3.0% for 
dizziness, 3.9% and 1.9% for palpitations, and 8.1% 
and 3.1% for nausea (see supplementary figure 1).
Discussion
In this pragmatic open label trial, there was no strong 
evidence that four weeks of nicotine patch treatment 
increased the rate of prolonged abstinence at six 
months in the primary analysis. Preloading was tested 
in a clinical setting where smokers could opt to use 
either nicotine replacement therapy or non-nicotine 
pharmacotherapies for continued cessation treatment 
after preloading had ended. In a planned analysis 
adjusted for varenicline use, there was clearer evidence 
that preloading increased the likelihood of achieving 
abstinence. Preloading reduced the intensity of urge 
to smoke both before and after attempting abstinence, 
which suggests it is an effective treatment. As 95% of 
participants continued preloading treatment, 80% 
using it daily, preloading seems to be well tolerated. 
Around 1 in 20 people experienced adverse events 
caused by preloading that were moderate or severe. 
No evidence was found of an excess of serious adverse 
events.

Strengths and limitations of this study
This trial has strengths and limitations. It was 
considerably larger than previous studies on this topic, 
thus achieving good precision. The pragmatic design 
makes the results easier to apply to clinical practice—
for example, that staff used their judgment to define 
tobacco dependence, avoiding the use of arbitrary cut-
offs for cigarettes per day, which are not used in clinical 
practice. Likewise, we included people who had serious 
coexisting medical conditions, psychiatric disorders, 
and other substance misuse problems and people from 
lower socioeconomic groups, reflecting the population 
of people who seek help to stop smoking. Around 75% 
of the study population were white British, lower than 
in England as a whole, reflecting the cities in which we 
recruited. However, the likely mechanism of action of 
preloading is that it undermines cigarette dependence 
and this biological action is likely to apply to any 
dependent smoker, regardless of her or his ethnic 
group. Around half of all potential participants who 
inquired about the trial were not enrolled and this 
might be thought to indicate poor acceptability of this 
particular intervention. However, this ratio between 
inquiries and participation seems to hold in other 
smoking cessation trials that recruited in the same way 
but that offered more “benign” interventions, such as 
St John’s wort, or a behavioural intervention in addition 
to routine care,27 28 so we believe that this is more 
likely to indicate people’s willingness to quit smoking, 
quit with support, or attend a schedule of treatment 
and follow-up visits. While this is unlikely to bias the 
difference between arms, it may also indicate that not 
everyone considering supported cessation is prepared 
to engage with this particular intervention. We used 
a robust method to assess the occurrence of adverse 
events. As it is unintuitive for participants who are not 
receiving treatment to report apparent side effects, we 
trained staff to inquire regardless. We supplemented 
this approach with a self completion questionnaire for 
participants in both arms that concerned symptoms 
experienced. In the event, both methods revealed 
similar findings, with nausea emerging as the most 
common adverse effect caused by preloading, albeit 
most did not experience it. Our trial was the first trial of 
preloading to assess adverse events to standards defined 
by good clinical practice and to record serious adverse 
events. Only one serious adverse event—acute coronary 
syndrome—was ascribed by an independent committee 
blinded to allocation as possibly due to preloading. 
This was ascribed on the basis that nicotine increases 
pulse rate, which may predispose to acute coronary 
syndrome. This participant, however, had stopped 
using the nicotine patch two days before the event. 
Nicotine has a half-life of around two hours,29 so even 
with a skin reservoir, nicotine from the patch though 
not from smoking would have cleared from the blood 
and thus not be exerting acute pharmacological effects. 
The UK Committee on the Safety of Medicines reviewed 
the cardiac safety of nicotine replacement therapy 
and recommended removal of licence restrictions on 
its use in people with stable cardiovascular disease 
and concurrent use while smoking.30 This is based on 
trials in people with cardiovascular disease and large 
scale observational evidence that shows no evidence 
of an increased risk.31 32 Short term studies show that 
high dose nicotine patches of up to 63 mg/day while 
smoking exert no greater effect on the cardiovascular 
system than does smoking alone.33 It therefore seems 
unlikely that this event was caused by preloading. The 
open label design is both a strength and a limitation. 
As a strength, it suggested an effect of preloading that 
either promoted the use of nicotine patches for use post-
cessation or deterred the use of varenicline, or both. In 
all other trials of preloading, the investigators controlled 
the choice of post-cessation drug and therefore this 
effect was not apparent. Arguably, this effect may occur 
in routine clinical practice and this has important 
implications for practice. As a limitation, a placebo 
would have provided more certainty that participants’ 
expectations were matched evenly by arm. Inequality 
of expectations might have influenced participants, 
but is an unlikely cause of the effect on cessation. 
The Cochrane review of nicotine replacement therapy 
contrasts trials where participants were randomised to 
nicotine replacement therapy for post-quit day use or 
matching placebo; in these studies, the risk ratio was 
1.51 (95% confidence interval 1.39 to 1.63) for long 
term abstinence. In studies without blinding, the risk 
ratio was similar at 1.58 (1.43 to 1.74).6 Perhaps lack 
of blinding affected participants’ reports of adverse 
events and urge intensity, although the effects on urge 
intensity persisted at least a week after the end of

treatment. In fact there is evidence that expectations of 
success were matched in this trial; ratings of confidence 
in ability to quit one week into preloading/control did 
not differ significantly by arm. It was also not possible 
to blind outcome assessors, because the one staff
 
member employed in each centre to perform clinical 
duties did both recruitment and follow-up. However, 
smoking abstinence was biochemically validated and 
this is unlikely to have affected the results.
Comparison with other studies
Although this trial does not provide strong evidence 
in itself, other evidence suggests that the optimum 
management of tobacco dependence includes a period 
of treatment before a quit attempt. Since inception of 
this trial, three further trials have published data on 
short term abstinence, two comparing varenicline 
preloading and one bupropion with standard use.8-
10 The risk ratios for abstinence in these trials were 
2.14 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 4.00) and 1.35 
(0.77 to 2.38) for varenicline (combined 1.78, 1.17 to 
2.71) and 1.70 (1.04 to 2.80) for bupropion. Adding 
our trial to the previous inconclusive meta-analysis 
of nicotine patch preloading versus standard use 
gives risk ratio of 1.24 (1.07 to 1.43) for long term 
abstinence from nicotine patch preloading. Previous 
trials have reported that preloading reduces the 
intensity of urges to smoke and smoking consumption 
in the pre-quit period and that this seems to be part 
of its mechanism of action.12 What we have shown is 
that, in line with theory, this reduction of intensity of 
urges before quitting translates into reduced intensity 
of urge after quit day. Aside from its theoretical 
importance, this finding could have implications 
for smoking cessation practice. Some trials have 
suggested that response to preloading predicts success 
in quitting,34 and, if preloading were to be adopted, it 
may be sensible to continue preloading only in people 
who experience reduced urges to quit, although this 
needs to be confirmed by randomised trials. Our trial 
is the only one to be carried out in the context where 
the therapists who prescribed the preloading (our 
trial team) were different from those who prescribed 
the post-cessation support (the NHS stop smoking

service). Doing so showed that preloading can be 
effective in this context, but its benefit may have 
been undermined by reduced varenicline use in those 
allocated to nicotine preloading. This effect may 
have occurred because English (National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, which 
state “Do not offer nicotine replacement therapy, 
varenicline or bupropion in any combination.”35 If so, 
changing this guidance may overcome this problem 
and nicotine preloading might be effective in such a 
context.
Implications for policy and practice
The best estimate of effect is that nicotine preloading 
could lead to around 3% of people seeking help to 
quit smoking, achieving prolonged abstinence at 12 
months that might not otherwise have done so. This 
effect may seem small but current 12 months quit rate 
in the UK specialist cessation services is 8%,36 and 
so an additional 3% would represents a worthwhile 
improvement. A failed quit attempt is likely to cost 
someone about 3-5 years of life expectancy.22 Thus, 
around 12 people need to use preloading to gain 
around a year of life. However, this trial does not 
provide sufficiently strong evidence to be confident 
that nicotine preloading is effective, probably because 
of the reduced use of varenicline that followed 
preloading. Both observational and randomised trial 
evidence suggest that varenicline use during the first 
weeks of abstinence is more effective than nicotine 
patches alone.25 36 37 It therefore seems important to 
examine how to mitigate this unintended effect.
Conclusion
Nicotine preloading with a 21 mg/24hr nicotine patch 
for four weeks seems to be efficacious, safe, and well 
tolerated, but probably deters the use of varenicline, 
the most effective smoking cessation drug. If it were 
possible to overcome this unintended consequence, 
preloading could lead to a worthwhile increase in long 
term smoking abstinence.
