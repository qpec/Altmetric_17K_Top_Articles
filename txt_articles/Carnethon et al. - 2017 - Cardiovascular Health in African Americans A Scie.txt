BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Population-wide reductions in 
cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality have not been shared 
equally by African Americans. The burden of cardiovascular disease 
in the African American community remains high and is a primary 
cause of disparities in life expectancy between African Americans and 
whites. The objectives of the present scientific statement are to describe 
cardiovascular health in African Americans and to highlight unique 
considerations for disease prevention and management.
METHOD: The primary sources of information were identified with 
PubMed/Medline and online sources from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.
RESULTS: The higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk 
factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular risk) underlies the relatively earlier age of onset of 
cardiovascular diseases among African Americans. Hypertension in 
particular is highly prevalent among African Americans and contributes 
directly to the notable disparities in stroke, heart failure, and peripheral 
artery disease among African Americans. Despite the availability 
of effective pharmacotherapies and indications for some tailored 
pharmacotherapies for African Americans (eg, heart failure medications), 
disease management is less effective among African Americans, 
yielding higher mortality. Explanations for these persistent disparities in 
cardiovascular disease are multifactorial and span from the individual level 
to the social environment.
CONCLUSIONS: The strategies needed to promote equity in the 
cardiovascular health of African Americans require input from a broad set 
of stakeholders, including clinicians and researchers from across multiple 
disciplines.

espite advances in the identification of risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the 
widespread use of evidence-based strategies to 
manage CVD, racial/ethnic disparities in CVD morbid-
ity and mortality persist in the United States. Across 
nearly every metric, African Americans have poorer 
overall cardiovascular health than non-Hispanic whites, 
and CVD mortality is higher in African Americans than 
whites.1,2 In fact, little has changed since 2005 when 
notable disparities in prevalence, disease manage-
ment, and outcomes were reported in a special issue of 
 
Circulation.3 The American Heart Association (AHA) is 
a leader in highlighting disparities in CVD by race and 
ethnicity. The present scientific statement on cardiovas-
cular health in African Americans follows statements 
published on Asian Americans4 and US Hispanic/Latinos.5 
Our intention is for the statement to be used by clini-
cians, public health practitioners, and policy makers to 
interrupt these adverse trends and to move toward 
 
cardiovascular health equity for African Americans.
SIGNIFICANCE AND RATIONALE
African Americans are the oldest nonnative racial groups 
 
in the United States, with the large initial influx coming 
to America involuntarily during the transatlantic slave 
trade. Since that time, individuals of African descent 
from around the world (eg, Africa, the Caribbean, Latin 
America) have immigrated to the United States and 
contribute to the diversity of language, customs, and 
cultures of the US African American population. In the 
present report, we have chosen the term African Amer-
ican to refer to black Americans of African descent liv-
ing in the United States. However, when referencing 
work from studies that specifically denote the inclusion 
of non-Hispanic blacks, we have retained their original 
label. At present, African Americans make up 13.3% 
of the US population and are the second largest racial/
ethnic minority behind Hispanic/Latinos.6
In 2012, the life expectancy of African Americans 
was 3.4 years shorter than that of whites (75.5 versus 
78.9 years, respectively). The contrasts are most striking 
when studied by race and sex: White women have the 
longest life expectancy at 81.4 years, followed by black 
women at 78.4 years, white men at 76.7 years, and 
black men at 72.3 years.7 Among the 25 leading causes 
of death, 6 of the 10 diseases that are substantial con-
tributors to years of life lost are CVD risk factors (ie, hy-
pertension, diabetes mellitus, renal disease) or CVDs (ie, 
ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke). In the 
most recent report by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, CVDs were estimated to explain 32% 
of the mortality difference between African American 
and white men and 43% of the difference between Af-
rican American and white women in 2009.8 Together, 
these conditions contributed to >2.0 million years of 
life lost in the African American population between 
1999 and 2010.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the current statement are to de-
scribe cardiovascular health and the burden of CVD 
in the population; to discuss the contribution of tra-
ditional CVD risk factors and adverse health behaviors 
to disparities in cardiovascular health between African 
Americans and whites; to describe the contribution of 
comorbidities that are overrepresented among African 
Americans to CVD; to identify and discuss genetic and 
biological mechanisms that might contribute to the dis-
ease pathways leading to CVD in African Americans; 
to highlight unique considerations (ie, differential ef-
fects of pharmacological strategies) in disease preven-
tion and management in African Americans; and to 
discuss the social, cultural, and environmental factors 
that influence prevention and disease management in 
African Americans. Aside from a brief discussion about 
the origin of disparities in youth, the current statement 
focuses on health in adults. A detailed discussion of 
strategies to reduce disparities in CVDs between Afri-
can Americans and other racial/ethnic groups is beyond 
the scope of the present statement. We conclude the 
statement by recommending a broad set of strategies 
for change, from additional research to workforce de-
velopment.
BURDEN OF CVDs AND STROKE
The term cardiovascular diseases will collectively in-
clude coronary heart disease (CHD), sudden cardiac 
death/sudden cardiac arrest, stroke/transient ischemic 
attack, and peripheral arterial disease. The AHA has 
played a key role in summarizing trends in cardiovas-
cular health and disease in the annual AHA statistical 
report.2 Because these data are published and updat-
ed annually, we only briefly summarize the burden of 
these diseases in African Americans compared with 
non-Hispanic whites.
Coronary Heart Disease
Although the rates of CHD have declined in recent de-
cades, those declines are smaller among African Ameri-
cans than whites. In the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk 
in Communities), the decline in CHD incidence among 
African American men was half (−3.2%/y) that of the 
decline among white men (−6.5%/y). African Ameri-
can women experienced a decline of −4.0%/y, whereas 
white women experienced a decline of −5.2%/y.1 In 
2010 (the most recent year that national prevalence 
rates were available), the self-reported prevalence of

AND GUIDELINES
diagnosed CHD was 6.5% in African Americans com-
pared with 5.8% in whites, a difference that was not 
statistically significant. However, the modestly higher 
rate in African Americans is driven by the excess among 
African American women (5.9%) compared with white 
women (4.0%); among men, rates were higher among 
whites (7.7%) versus African Americans (7.3%).9 Lon-
gitudinal data from the REGARDS study (Reasons for 
Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) describe 
no difference in incident CHD between African Ameri-
can and white men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.84–1.29) and only a marginally 
and nonsignificantly higher incidence in African Ameri-
can women versus white women (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 
0.96–1.62). However, African American men and wom-
en have substantially higher rates of fatal CHD than 
whites (men: HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.24–2.56; women: 
HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02–2.62).10
Heart Failure
The incidence, prevalence, and prognosis of heart fail-
ure are less favorable among African Americans and are 
largely attributable to the higher burden of traditional 
risk factors among African Americans. Disparities in the 
incidence of heart failure are most prominent at young 
ages, as reported by the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery 
Risk Development in Young Adults), in which 26 of the 
27 incident heart failure cases that occurred in individu-
als <50 years of age were among black participants.11 
Although disparities in heart failure persist in middle-
aged and older adults (mean age, 62 years) in MESA 
(Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; HR, 1.81; 95% 
CI, 1.07–3.07 in African Americans versus whites), sta-
tistical adjustment for established risk factors (ie, age, 
sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholesterol, smok-
ing status, and left ventricular hypertrophy) explained 
all of the excess risk among African Americans versus 
whites (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.81–2.48).12 Findings were 
similar in the ARIC study, but the extended follow-up 
(15 versus 4 years in MESA) and large number of total 
events (n=1282) provided additional evidence that the 
disparities were present with younger age at disease 
onset. Among men, adjustment for established risk fac-
tors eliminated any differences in heart failure incidence 
between African Americans and whites (HR, 0.86; 95% 
CI, 0.70–1.06, African Americans versus whites). How-
ever, among women, African Americans were signifi-
cantly more likely to experience events within the first 
7.5 years even after statistical adjustment for risk fac-
tors (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.25–2.55 versus white wom-
en). The disparity between African American and white 
women was attenuated only after adjustment during 
the second half of follow-up when women were older 
(HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.46–1.90, African American versus 
white). In that same study, the age-adjusted 30-day case 
fatality rate (per 1000 person-years) was significantly 
higher (P<0.05) in African American men (51.8; 95% 
CI, 44.1–59.4) and women (46.1; 95% CI, 39.8–52.5) 
compared with white men (41.2; 95% CI, 36.9–45.6) 
and white women (35.8; 95% CI, 30.6–41.4).13
Sudden Cardiac Arrest/ Sudden Cardiac 
Death
Sudden cardiac arrest, a sudden pulseless condition fre-
quently attributable to underlying cardiac causes, has 
high fatality rates outside of hospital settings (ie, sud-
den cardiac death). Both sudden cardiac arrest and sud-
den cardiac death are higher in African Americans com-
pared with whites, primarily because of a higher burden 
of traditional and nontraditional (eg, sickle cell trait) 
CVD risk factors in African Americans.14 In the Oregon 
Sudden Unexpected Death Study, a community-based 
epidemiological study initiated in 2002 to collect in-
formation about out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, African 
Americans were twice as likely to experience sudden 
cardiac death. From 2002 to 2012, the rate of sudden 
cardiac arrest was 175 per 100 
000 in African Ameri-
can men compared with 84 per 100 
000 in white men. 
African American women experienced sudden cardiac 
death at a rate of 90 per 100 
000, whereas white wom-
en experienced sudden cardiac arrest at a rate of 40 
per 100 
000. African American men and women who 
experienced sudden cardiac arrest were on average >6 
years younger than their white counterparts. According 
to the National Registry on Cardiopulmonary Resuscita-
tion, when patients are hospitalized for sudden cardiac 
arrest, African Americans are less likely to survive to dis-
charge (25.2%) than whites (37.4%).15
Cerebrovascular Disease/Stroke
Cerebrovascular disease incidence and mortality, inclu-
sive of transient ischemic attacks, ischemic stroke, and 
intracerebral hemorrhage, are notably higher in African 
Americans compared with whites in the United States. 
Notably, although stroke mortality has fallen by 80% 
across all ages over the past 60 years, there has been no 
meaningful decrease in the magnitude of the African 
American to white racial disparity in stroke mortality.16 
Since the earliest studies in the 1950s, stroke mortality 
rates in nonwhites (predominately African Americans) 
remain 4.5-fold higher than among whites. Whether 
the higher stroke mortality in African Americans is at-
tributable to a higher incidence of stroke, higher case 
fatality after stroke events, or a combination is not en-
tirely known. In the ARIC study, the incidence rate ra-
tio for stroke comparing African Americans to whites 
<55 years of age was modestly larger (relative risk [RR], 
2.77; 95% CI, 1.37–5.62) than the same comparison in 
those >55 years of age (RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.66–3.00).17

However, most African Americans in ARIC were re-
cruited from a single clinical site in the southern Stroke 
Belt region (Jackson, MS), confounding the racial and 
geographic disparities in stroke risk and complicating 
the interpretation of these results. The implication of 
the regional differences in the racial disparity in magni-
tude is that the Stroke Belt is more “potent” for African 
Americans than whites, and as a corollary, it is possible 
that between 2% and 13% of the black-white differ-
ence in stroke risk (and likely coronary risk) is a result of 
confounding with geographic differences in risk.18
Data from both REGARDS and GCNKSS (Greater 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study) have 
shown that age-related differences in the magnitude of 
racial disparity in stroke mortality are mirrored by age-
related changes in the magnitude of the racial dispar-
ity in stroke incidence. GCNKSS reported patterns of 
stroke incidence in 1999 in the Cincinnati region that 
were similar to the national pattern for stroke mortal-
ity, with stroke mortality 2.6 times greater in African 
Americans than whites at 45 to 54 years of age but 
decreasing to 1.8 times for 55 to 64 years of age, 1.2 
times for 65 to 74 years of age, 0.9 times for 75 to 84 
years of age, and 0.8 times for ≥85 years of age.19 In 
the same report, stroke case fatality was 24% lower 
in African Americans than whites, an observation that 
was relatively consistent across stroke subtypes of in-
farction and hemorrhage.19
There is a strong age-related difference in the risk 
of intracerebral hemorrhage in African Americans com-
pared with whites. At 55 to 74 years of age, African 
Americans were 1.8 times more likely to experience in-
tracerebral hemorrhage, but that difference was only 
modestly greater (RR, 1.23 times) for ages ≥75 years.20 
A pooled analysis of ARIC and the CHS (Cardiovascu-
lar Health Study) showed a similar pattern whereby the 
RR of intracerebral hemorrhage for African Americans 
versus whites was 5.8 at 45 years, 1.7 at 65 years, and 
0.94 at 75 years of age.21 Among 45- to 64-year-olds 
in REGARDS, the incidence rate of intracerebral hem-
orrhage (per 100 
000) was doubled for African Ameri-
cans (46.0; 95% CI, 26.5–79.7) compared with whites 
(21.5; 95% CI, 11.2–41.2). However, these associations 
were reversed in older adults. The risk of incident intra-
cerebral hemorrhage was 40.1 (95% CI, 17.8–90.4) in 
African Americans and 65.1 (95% CI, 39.1–108.4) in 
whites 65 to 74 years old. At ages ≥75 years, the inci-
dence rates were 65.8 (95% CI, 24.4–177.8) in African 
Americans and 105.0 (95% CI, 64.3–171.3) in whites.22
Peripheral Arterial Disease
Atherosclerotic disease affecting the arteries and vessels 
outside of the heart, peripheral arterial disease/periph-
eral vascular disease, is a common geriatric disease with 
a prevalence of 12% to 20% among adults >80 years 
of age.23 Across the age range, the rate of peripheral 
arterial disease is twice as high in African Americans 
compared with whites.24 Traditional risk factors, namely 
cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hyperten-
sion, are the strongest risk factors for peripheral arterial 
disease, but statistical adjustment for these and other 
traditional risk factors does not completely eliminate 
the excess prevalence in African Americans compared 
with whites.25,26 In the MESA study, the adjusted odds 
for incident peripheral arterial disease were 1.67 times 
higher in African Americans compared with whites.27 
The San Diego Population Study included markers of 
inflammation in multivariable models to test whether 
they explained the residual excess risk in African Ameri-
cans compared with whites but found that, although 
the RRs for peripheral artery disease between African 
Americans and whites were further attenuated, they 
remained statistically significantly higher, ranging from 
1.5 to 2.0.28
Although peripheral arterial disease is not consid-
ered a direct cause of mortality but rather a reflection 
of the overall burden of CVD, peripheral arterial dis-
ease was listed as the underlying cause of death for 
59 
681 deaths in 2014. The any-mention age-adjusted 
death rate resulting from peripheral arterial disease 
was higher among African American men (24.8 per 
100 
000) than white (19.9), American Indian or Alaska 
Native (20.8), Hispanic (15.4), or Asian Pacific Islander 
(8.5) men. Similar patterns of peripheral arterial disease 
mortality were observed for African American women 
(16.5) compared with white (13.8), American Indian 
or Alaska Native (16.1), Hispanic (10.7), and Asian or 
Pacific Islander (6.8) women.2
Summary
There are marked disparities in the onset of heart fail-
ure, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease between 
African Americans and whites, whereas rates of CHD 
are not significantly different, particularly among men. 
However, mortality from all CVDs is significantly high-
er in African Americans compared with whites, which 
suggests a role for health care to mitigate disparities 
with comprehensive screening, an enhanced specific-
ity of diagnoses, and tailored disease management. 
The prominence of disparities in the onset of CVD at 
younger ages highlights the contribution of cardiovas-
cular risk factors and adverse health behaviors among 
African Americans.

identified African American children, adolescents, and 
adults30,31 as less likely than other racial/ethnic groups 
to achieve ideal cardiovascular health. The following 
sections describe the burden of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, proposed risk factor management, and adverse 
health behaviors.
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Hypertension
Hypertension is arguably the most potent risk to the 
cardiovascular health of African Americans, as well as 
the greatest area of opportunity for the prevention of 
disease if effectively managed and prevented. The prev-
alence of diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension 
among African American men (42.4%) and women 
(44%) ≥20 years of age in the United States32 is among 
the highest in the world where the population preva-
lence of hypertension is the highest in low- to middle-
income countries (29%–31%).33 An analysis of trends 
indicates that rates of hypertension among African 
Americans remained ≈10% to 12% higher than rates 
among non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans 
since 1999 to 2000 (the year that the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] became 
semiannual).32 Percent of African admixture in African 
Americans and other racial/ethnic groups is positively 
associated with blood pressure (BP) levels and the prev-
alence of hypertension.34,35
The origins of adult differences in hypertension 
begin in youth. African American boys and girls have 
higher BP levels and a higher prevalence of hyper-
tension (13.8% in African Americans versus 8.4% in 
whites and 10.4% in Hispanics).36 Findings from the 
Bogalusa Heart Study indicate that higher BP levels dur-
ing childhood track into elevated BP in adults.37 These 
differences persist into older ages, as evidenced by the 
MESA study, in which the odds of hypertension were 
1.5 times higher in African Americans than in whites 
through age 75 years.38 In REGARDS, the RR of incident 
hypertension was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.12–1.37) times high-
er in African American men compared with white men 
across the life span. In contrast, an interaction with age 
was observed for women (P=0.08). The RR for incident 
hypertension was significantly higher for African Ameri-
can women 65 to 74 years of age (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 
1.24–1.66) but was not significant for age >75 years 
(RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.84–1.65, African American versus 
white women).39
On a positive note, African Americans were more 
likely than whites or Hispanics to be aware of their hy-
pertension and to have it treated.40,41 In NHANES, 87% 
of African Americans, 81% of whites, and 77% of 
Hispanics were aware of their hypertension, and 80% 
of African Americans were treated with medications 
compared with 77% of whites and 70% of Hispanics.40 
 
African Americans in REGARDS were also more likely 
to be aware of their hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 
1.45; 95% CI, 1.24–1.71 versus whites) and treated 
(OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.34–1.83, African Americans ver-
sus whites).42 Despite these favorable trends in aware-
ness and treatment as noted in NHANES, fewer African 
Americans achieve BP control (47.9%) than non-His-
panic whites (56%).40 Similarly, the adjusted odds of 
hypertension control in REGARDS are lower in African 
Americans compared with whites (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.60–0.74).42
The prevalence of hypertension in African Americans 
has significant implications for mortality. The magnitude 
of the association between systolic BP (SBP) levels and 
stroke risk is 3 times greater in African Americans than 
in whites; a 10–mm 
Hg difference in SBP is associated 
with an 8% (95% CI, 0–16) increase in the stroke risk 
in whites but a 24% (95% CI, 14–35) increase in Afri-
can Americans. Within strata of SBP
, stroke risk goes up 
with an increasing number of classes of antihyperten-
sive medications used to treat high BP (RR, 1.42 for 1 
class up to 2.48 for ≥3 classes).43 Even when treatment 
recommendations are followed for African Americans, 
stroke risks remain elevated, suggesting primordial pre-
vention as the best strategy to eliminate the risks of 
hypertension-related vascular outcomes.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 
 
Working Group on Research Needs to Improve Hyper-
tension Treatment and Control in Africans produced a 
brief report summarizing some of the above findings 
and, above all, advocating for additional research into 
the sources of disparities in hypertension control in 
 
African Americans, given its contribution to significant 
disparities in CVDs.44 Consequently, addressing dispari-
ties in hypertension incidence and management is a 
high priority.
Diabetes Mellitus
More than 95% of the cases of diabetes mellitus are 
classified as type 2,45 and the combined prevalence of 
diagnosed and undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus 
is 14.3% overall but 21.8% in African Americans and 
11.3% in non-Hispanic whites according to NHANES 
2011 to 2012.46 More than 1 in 3 (37%) African Ameri-
cans with diabetes mellitus were not diagnosed.46 The 
prevalence of diabetes mellitus among African Ameri-
cans has increased dramatically in the past decades, 
from 8% in 1988 to 1994 to the current rates.46 Simi-
larly, prediabetes increased among African Americans 
from 14% in 1988 to 1994 to 20% in 2005 to 2010.47 
The elevated incidence of diabetes mellitus among Af-
rican Americans extends over the life course, with no 
age-related decline in the disparity. Over a lifetime, Afri-
can American men develop diabetes mellitus 1.52 times 
(95% CI, 1.31–1.78) more often than white men, and 
African American women are 2.14 (95% CI, 1.86–2.46)

times more likely to develop diabetes mellitus than 
white women.39
Although type 1 diabetes mellitus remains the most 
common type of diabetes mellitus among children and 
adolescents (age <21 years), rates of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus among youth have increased secondary to the 
obesity epidemic. African American adolescents (age, 
12–19 years) are significantly more likely to develop 
diabetes mellitus than whites, and their rate falls short 
of only the rate among American Indian adolescents.48 
These patterns are particularly troublesome given 
the long lifetime of exposure to higher glucose levels 
among African Americans that contribute to mortality 
and vascular complications of diabetes mellitus.
The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made by a com-
bination of fasting glucose, postchallenge glucose, and 
hemoglobin A1c.45 However, relying solely on hemoglo-
bin A1c could underestimate the prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus in African Americans because of disorders such 
as sickle cell trait that occur among individuals of Afri-
can ancestry. Recent research indicates that at a given 
level of fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c is statistically 
significantly lower (5.72%) among those with sickle cell 
trait versus those without (6.01%).49 Delays in diagnos-
ing diabetes mellitus have adverse implications for the 
development of vascular complications.
African Americans are less likely to be aware of their 
diabetes mellitus and, when treated, are less likely to 
achieve adequate control according to common qual-
ity metrics defined by the Accountable Care Organi-
zation (hemoglobin A1c <9%).50 Only 54% of African 
Americans achieved targets compared with 61% of 
whites,47 which may contribute directly to the elevated 
excess in microvascular complications of diabetes mel-
litus in African Americans compared with whites.51 The 
age-adjusted death rate among people with diabetes 
mellitus in 2011 was 40 per 100 
000 in African Ameri-
cans compared with 19 per 100 
000 in whites and 26 
per 100 
000 in Hispanics.52 Compared with their white 
peers, African Americans with diabetes mellitus are 4 
times more likely to have visual impairment (caused 
by diabetic retinopathy)53 and 3.8 times more likely to 
have end-stage renal disease (resulting from diabetic 
nephropathy)54,55 but possibly less likely to experience 
lower extremity amputation.56
Lipid Disorders
Despite higher atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) rates and 
higher mortality from CHD among African Americans, 
lipid profiles among African Americans according to na-
tional prevalence estimates are comparable to or lower 
than those of non-Hispanic whites. For example, the 
prevalence of elevated total cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) 
was 37.0% in non-Hispanic white males versus 32.6% 
in non-Hispanic blacks in NHANES 2011 to 2014. Com-
parable percentages of elevated total cholesterol among 
women were 43.4% among non-Hispanic whites and 
36.1% in non-Hispanic blacks.2 High-density lipopro-
tein (HDL) cholesterol is known to be higher in Afri-
can Americans, and in recent estimates from NHANES, 
those patterns hold, with the prevalence of low HDL 
(<40 mg/dL) at 28.4% in non-Hispanic white men com-
pared with only 20.7% in non-Hispanic black men. 
There were small differences in the prevalence among 
women (10.3% in non-Hispanic white women and 
8% in non-Hispanic black women).2 The prevalence 
of dyslipidemia was higher among African Americans 
in the JHS (Jackson Heart Study), a cohort in Jackson, 
MS, compared with national estimates. One third of 
participants 35 to 84 years of age had hypercholester-
olemia, defined as total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥160 mg/
dL, or triglycerides ≥200 mg/dL.57 In this population, 
the most common dysfunction was in elevated LDL-
C (18.3%), followed by total cholesterol (15.2%) and 
then triglycerides (5.4%).57 Relying on the lipid panel 
and a focus on dyslipidemia may underestimate CVD 
risk in African Americans given the relatively lower 
likelihood of high LDL-C and triglycerides in African 
Americans. However, incidence data on dyslipidemia 
present a different picture.
Over the age of 45, there is a higher incidence of 
dyslipidemia (total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, LDL ≥160 
mg/dL, HDL ≤40 mg/dL, or use of lipid-lowering medi-
cations) in African American men (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 
1.04–1.28) and women (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08–1.28) 
than in their white counterparts. However, among 
both men (P=0.10) and women (P=0.02), the dispari-
ties become even more pronounced in older ages, with 
the RR of dyslipidemia in African American men com-
pared with white men increasing from 1.15 (95% CI, 
0.82–1.61) at 45 to 54 years of age to 1.26 (95% CI, 
1.06–1.51) at 65 to 74 years of age. The RR of dyslipid-
emia for African American women versus white wom-
en is 0.97 (95% CI, 0.77–1.22) at 45 to 54 years of 
age but 1.39 (95% CI, 1.00–1.95) among women ≥75 
years of age.39 The apparent contradiction in findings 
between prevalence and incidence may be explained 
by the higher rates of CVD mortality among African 
Americans compared with whites. Disease prevalence 
is determined on the basis of a combination of dis-
ease incidence and the average duration of disease. If 
African Americans are more likely to die of CVD that 
could be attributed to dyslipidemia, then the burden 
of dyslipidemia would not be captured in prevalence 
estimates because they are exiting the denominator 
before their disease is captured. Consequently, dyslip-
idemia management is critically important.
Although the introduction of statin therapy has 
revolutionized the treatment of lipid disorders, the in-
troduction of therapy requires CVD risk assessment. At 
the baseline examination of the JHS in 2000 to 2003,

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
69.7% of participants were aware that they had hyper-
cholesterolemia, 43% of those were being treated, and 
among those, 88% were controlled.57 In the REGARDS 
study, African Americans were less likely to be aware of 
their dyslipidemia (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61–0.78), less 
likely to have their dyslipidemia treated (OR, 0.77; 95% 
CI, 0.67–0.89), and if treated, less likely to have their 
lipids under control (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58–0.77).58
Findings from MESA suggested that guideline-
recommended treatment was underused in all ethnic 
groups examined.59 The lowest control rates of dyslipid-
emia among those on lipid-lowering therapy were seen 
among African American women (65.7% controlled 
versus 86.2% for non-Hispanic white women), followed 
by African American and Hispanic men (both 68.5% 
versus 76.4% in non-Hispanic white men).59 Although 
the guidelines have been updated to eliminate numeri-
cal targets as therapeutic goals,60 the historical pattern 
of undertreatment among African Americans57,59 raises 
the concern that without specific attention by providers 
and adherence by patients, CVD risk tied to dyslipid-
emia will remain higher among African Americans than 
other Americans.
Obesity
Across the age spectrum, obesity rates are higher 
among African Americans than whites. One in 5 (20%) 
African American children 2 to 19 years old were obese 
(defined by a body mass index [BMI] for age value 
≥95th percentile of the 2000 Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention growth charts) compared with 15% 
of whites. The rates of extreme obesity (BMI for age val-
ue ≥120th percentile of the 2000 Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention growth charts) in children were 
more than double in African American children (9%) 
compared with whites (4%).61,62 Among adults ≥20 
years of age, African American women had the highest 
rates of obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) at 58%, followed by 
African American men (38%), white men (34%), and 
white women (33%).2 The prevalence of severe obe-
sity (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) among African Americans (12.1%) 
was double that of the next highest groups (Hispanics, 
5.8%, and whites, 5.6%).62
The obesity paradox, the observation of a higher risk 
of mortality in leaner and normal-weight individuals 
than among adults who are overweight or have class 
I obesity,61 may warrant investigation among African 
Americans. Previous findings from a large cohort study, 
the Cancer Prevention Study II, showed only a moder-
ately elevated risk of all-cause mortality with increased 
weight among African Americans but a much stronger 
finding among whites.63 There are several potential ex-
planations for the observation of an obesity paradox 
that fall outside of the scope of the present review (eg, 
selection bias, reverse causation, residual confounding, 
and measurement error64). One that is potentially most 
relevant to African Americans is error arising from the 
use of BMI to represent adiposity.
Although the most common metric to define obe-
sity clinically and at the population level is BMI, body 
composition and body fat distribution are more pre-
cise indicators of metabolic and cardiovascular risk. 
NHANES captured waist circumference and found that 
African American women have a larger waist circum-
ference compared with white women but that there 
were no differences between African American and 
white men.65 Smaller studies that have direct measures 
of adiposity via imaging (ie, dual x-ray absorptiometry 
or computed tomography) describe contradictory find-
ings for body composition and adiposity distribution. In 
studies that have images of adiposity distribution within 
regions of the body, African American men and women 
have less metabolically active abdominal visceral adi-
pose tissue compared with whites after adjustment for 
total body fat.66–68 Recent findings from the Pennington 
Center Longitudinal Study confirm prior observations 
and report that African American women and men had 
significantly higher subcutaneous adipose tissue, which 
is considered protective, compared with white women 
and men.69,70 However, another study found that these 
racial differences were reversed after adjustment for to-
tal body fat, indicating that African American men had 
more subcutaneous adipose tissue at a given level of 
total body fat.70
Qualitative and quantitative research on the ideal 
body size and shape in African Americans describes 
cultural attitudes that favor a larger body size, par-
ticularly for women.71 These attitudes among African 
Americans complicate the acknowledgement of aware-
ness about obesity and willingness to engage in weight 
management programs.72,73 In the CARDIA study, obese 
women who perceived themselves as obese lost 0.09 
BMI units annually over 13 years compared with obese 
women who perceived themselves as normal weight, 
who gained 0.31 BMI units annually (P<0.001).74 In 
a weight-loss study, African American women made 
a similar number of attempts to lose weight but set a 
weight-loss goal that was 10 lb higher than the goal set 
by equally obese white women.75
Atrial Fibrillation
Although atrial fibrillation has long been recognized 
as a potent risk factor for stroke,76,77 data from RE-
GARDS recently documented that atrial fibrillation 
is also a potent risk factor for myocardial events,78 
a finding confirmed in ARIC79 and in a meta-analysis 
of observational studies and clinical trials.80 Despite 
African Americans having more risk factors for the de-
velopment of atrial fibrillation, studies have consistently 
documented a lower prevalence of either self-reported 
or electrocardiographically defined atrial fibrillation, the 
so-called atrial fibrillation paradox.81 The incidence of

atrial fibrillation increases dramatically with age, but 
the risk of incident atrial fibrillation is ≈0.20 to 0.50 
times lower in African Americans than in their white 
counterparts across the adult age spectrum.39,82,83 Data 
from REGARDS suggest that these benefits of a lower 
prevalence (and incidence) of atrial fibrillation among 
African Americans are offset by a much lower odds 
of awareness of atrial fibrillation (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 
0.20–0.52) and the fact that, if aware, African Ameri-
cans are much less likely to be on treatment with war-
farin (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.13–0.60).84
Adverse Health Behaviors
Poor Diet Quality
The current guidelines for lifestyle management from 
the AHA and American College of Cardiology to reduce 
cardiovascular risk include consuming a dietary pattern 
that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; 
includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, 
nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of 
sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats.60 It 
is difficult for all Americans to meet these dietary rec-
ommendations, and adherence has been documented 
as low.85 African Americans face unique challenges to 
adherence to recommendations. One such challenge is 
food intake preferences that align with a cultural tradi-
tion of “soul food.” The traditional soul food diet has 
components that are healthful and many components 
that are suboptimal.86 An example of a healthful com-
ponent is the inclusion of many fruits and vegetables 
such as collard greens, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, dried 
beans and peas, watermelon, blackberries, corn, and 
okra. Conversely, the diet can also be described as be-
ing high in added fats, sugars, and sodium, with promi-
nent use of high-fat meats for main dishes and the use 
of deep frying and other cooking techniques that add 
excess calories and sodium.
Regardless of their geographic residence in the Unit-
ed States, REGARDS has shown that African Americans 
are much more likely to consume a “southern diet.”87 
When adherence to a southern diet was categorized 
into quartiles, only 9% of African Americans fell within 
the lowest quartile of adherence, and 60% fell within 
the uppermost quartile. The HR for incident CHD and 
stroke was elevated in the highest versus the lowest 
quartile of adherence (CHD: HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.53–
2.6188; stroke risk: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05–1.84).87 Ad-
justment for this diet score was associated with a 63% 
mediation of the magnitude of estimated increased risk 
of stroke in African Americans <65 years of age.87,88
Physical Inactivity
Current physical activity recommendations state that 
adults should engage in 150 min/wk of moderate-in-
tensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vig-
orous-intensity aerobic physical activity and ≥2 d/wk 
of muscle-strengthening activities.89 Data suggest that 
adherence to the recommended activity levels is par-
ticularly low among African Americans.90 Fewer than 
5% of all adults engaged in 30 minutes of moderate-in-
tensity physical activity on most days of the week. Data 
from the CARDIA cohort show that more than one third 
of African American men and women report watching 
≥4 hours of television per week, and this behavior is 
inversely associated with physical activity.91
When accelerometry is used to assess physical ac-
tivity levels and sedentary behavior, patterns by race/
ethnicity are less clear. In the NHANES study, there were 
no differences in minutes per day of moderate to vigor-
ous activity between African Americans and whites.90 
Similarly, there was no difference in objectively deter-
mined sedentary behavior between African American 
and white men and women.92 In the REGARDS study, 
only 20% of African American men and 12% of wom-
en achieved >150 min/wk of accelerometer-determined 
moderate to vigorous physical activity per week com-
pared with 30% and 20% of their white counterparts 
(P<0.05).93 African Americans also spent statistically 
significantly more time engaged in sedentary behaviors 
as assessed by accelerometry in REGARDS (735±3 min-
utes for African American men versus 719±2 minutes 
for white men; 741±2 minutes for African American 
women versus 730±2 minutes for white women).93
Cultural norms that influence behaviors, beliefs, and 
attitudes about physical activity are notable barriers to 
the adherence to physical activity recommendations. 
Some of these barriers include the perception that phys-
ical activity is “work” and not desired given the manual 
nature of daily jobs,94 the lack of consistency between 
certain types of physical activity and African American 
self-identity (eg, double-dutch jump rope versus ski-
ing),95 and a low desirability for certain activities (eg, 
water sports) because of the physical nature,96 the level 
of exertion or preparation required,97,98 and concerns 
about hairstyles, particularly among women.99 Income 
is another proposed barrier to meeting physical activity 
guidelines,100 but the role of income varies by geogra-
phy in that it is a greater concern among rural adults100 
and less so among urban African Americans.101 Interper-
sonal barriers (eg, childcare, other family care), concerns 
about neighborhood safety, lack of access to facilities, 
and weather are also notable.99 A significant limitation 
of the research on barriers to activity is that the vast ma-
jority has been conducted in African American women, 
and it is not known whether the same concerns are a 
priority among African American men.
Cigarette Smoking
Cigarette smoking is a strong and consistent risk factor 
for all CVDs, with little evidence of a differential magni-
tude of effect in African Americans and whites.102 Since

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
the height of smoking behavior during the 1960s, rates 
have declined across all racial/ethnic groups to cur-
rent levels of 25.4% in African Americans and 25.8% 
in whites.103 However, there are important age-related 
differences in the prevalence of cigarette smoking by 
race. Although cigarette smoking is markedly higher in 
white than African American adolescents (18.6% ver-
sus 8.2%, respectively),104 these differences shrink con-
siderably among adults >25 years of age.
Two primary areas of smoking-related disparities 
are exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ie, sec-
ondhand smoke) and lower quit rates among African 
Americans. Environmental tobacco smoke is an estab-
lished cardiovascular risk factor.105 African American 
members of a health practice plan reported more en-
vironmental tobacco smoke exposure than whites,106 
and African American respondents to the NHIS (Na-
tional Health Interview Survey)107 and NHANES III108 
reported more environmental tobacco exposure. One 
hypothesis for the lower quit rates among African 
Americans than whites is that they are more likely to 
use menthol smoking products, which enhance the 
addictive potential of nicotine.109 Tobacco companies 
target the marketing of mentholated products to Afri-
can Americans (and youth),110 and among those smok-
ers switching from mentholated to nonmentholated 
products, African Americans are more likely to revert 
back to the use of mentholated products.111 Data from 
the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Popula-
tion Survey report greater use of mentholated prod-
ucts among African American smokers (71%; 95% CI, 
70.4–73.2) than white (21.0%; 95% CI, 20.5–21.4) or 
Hispanic (28.1%; 95% CI, 26.6–29.7) smokers. Smok-
ers of mentholated products (of all races/ethnicities) 
were less likely to have quit.112
Clinical Sleep Disorders, Insufficient Sleep, and 
Poor-Quality Sleep
The relevance of sleep quality and duration on cardio-
vascular health was summarized in a 2016 AHA scien-
tific statement.113 A growing body of research describes 
racial/ethnic disparities in sleep-disordered breathing, 
sleep duration, and sleep quality. Sleep has been hy-
pothesized as a contributing factor to disparities in 
CVDs.114 African Americans are more likely to have 
obstructive sleep apnea (secondary to obesity),115 and 
untreated sleep apnea is associated with higher rates 
of cardiovascular mortality from CHD or stroke directly 
(eg, oxygen deprivation, sympathetic overreactivity, or 
inflammation116) or through the onset of other CVD risk 
factors such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus.117
Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular risk 
factors and all-cause mortality; both short and long 
sleepers experience higher rates of events than those 
who sleep on average for 7 to 9 hours per night.118,119 
African American respondents to the NHIS were 41% 
more likely to self-report being short sleepers and 62% 
more likely to report being long sleepers than white 
participants.120 African American participants reported 
longer sleep latency (time to fall asleep) and other ad-
verse sleep symptoms than white and Hispanic partici-
pants.121 In the Chicago Area Sleep Study, a population-
based epidemiological study of adults who underwent 
objective assessment of sleep via wrist actigraphy, the 
average sleep duration among African Americans was 
statistically significantly shorter per night (by ≈48 min-
utes) than among whites.122 A later report in the same 
cohort estimated that 11% of the disparity in hyperten-
sion prevalence between African Americans and whites 
was attributable to poor sleep quality (as determined 
by the percent of time during the sleep interval spent 
sleeping).123
Multiple factors have been studied in relation to 
both short and long sleep duration in the all–African 
American JHS. Lower levels of education are associ-
ated with a greater likelihood of long sleep duration 
(OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.42–3.38). Similar findings were 
reported for the association of income with long sleep 
duration. Notably, individuals living in neighborhoods 
where they reported more neighborhood violence had 
shorter sleep duration (−9.82 minutes; 95% CI, −16.98 
to −2.66) and poorer sleep quality.124 In a later report, 
African American participants who reported higher 
levels of long-term stress were more likely to have short 
sleep duration (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 2.02–4.08 versus the 
lower 3 quartiles of stress).125
Less is known about racial differences in the impact 
of sleep duration and cardiovascular risk. Although long 
sleep duration appears to be a consistent risk factor for 
stroke, early indications suggest that among diabetic 
adults, short sleep duration (≤6 hours) is associated 
with increased stroke risk in whites (OR, 1.38; 95% 
CI, 1.06–1.80) but not in African Americans (OR, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.58–1.26).126 Additional research is needed 
to test the association of objectively determined sleep 
duration with incident CHD risk in African Americans 
compared with whites.
Summary
There are significant disparities in the age of onset and 
prevalence of established CVD risk factors in African 
Americans. An earlier age of onset of obesity, hyper-
tension, and diabetes mellitus is likely to contribute to 
the higher prevalence of these conditions and of CVD 
morbidity and mortality and to the lower life expectan-
cy for African Americans versus whites. Adverse health 
behaviors in the African American population iden-
tified in the literature may explain in part the higher 
burden of CVD risk factors. Effective implementation 
of evidence-based guidelines could improve cardiovas-
cular health and lower vascular risk in African Ameri-

cans. Ingrained cultural preferences and attitudes, as 
well as the social and physical context surrounding Afri-
can Americans, influence the maintenance of behavior 
changes. Furthermore, experience shows that interven-
tions targeting individuals are modestly successful dur-
ing the period of intervention, but changes are not sus-
tained beyond the intervention period. Consequently, 
population-wide strategies to influence health behavior 
change, as described in the AHA Community Guide for 
Prevention,127 may have greater potential to reach both 
African American women and men and to shift the 
health behaviors and consequent cardiovascular risk of 
the entire population.
COMORBIDITIES
Certain health conditions that predispose to CVDs are 
more common among African Americans than whites. 
Below, we highlight chronic kidney disease, sickle cell 
disease/sickle cell trait, and HIV, given their relatively 
higher prevalence among African Americans.
Renal Disease (Chronic Kidney Disease 
and End-Stage Renal Disease)
The prevalence of chronic kidney disease, determined as 
estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL·min−1·1.73 
m−2 or albuminuria,128 has increased in the United States 
according to NHANES data.129,130 African Americans 
have an excess burden of chronic kidney disease, result-
ing in part from the high prevalence of hypertension 
and diabetes mellitus,131,132 but that may also be the 
result of the percent of African admixture and other ge-
netic factors.131,133,134 One such factor that has a higher 
prevalence in African Americans is sickle cell trait (dis-
cussed below), which has been associated with a higher 
rate of albuminuria and chronic kidney disease. Sickle 
cell trait carrier status was associated with 1.79 times 
higher (95% CI, 1.45–2.20) likelihood of developing 
chronic kidney disease over follow-up.135
In a pooled analysis of the ARIC and CHS studies, 
the risk factor–adjusted HR for all-cause mortality in 
African Americans with versus without chronic kidney 
disease was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.35–2.31), whereas the HR 
for the same comparison among whites was signifi-
cantly smaller (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02–1.26).136 In the 
REGARDS study, African Americans with mild chronic 
kidney disease (10 ≤albumin/creatinine ratio <30) ver-
sus no chronic kidney disease (albumin/creatinine ra-
tio <10) were more likely to experience CHD mortality 
(HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.34–2.53) than whites (HR, 1.23; 
95% CI, 0.96–1.59). The disparities grew with sever-
ity of chronic kidney disease, and among participants 
with severe chronic kidney disease (albumin/creatinine 
ratio ≥300), the HRs were 3.21 (95% CI, 2.02–5.09) 
in African Americans and 1.49 (95% CI, 0.80–2.76) in 
whites.137 There was also evidence of effect modifica-
tion in the relationship of albumin/creatinine ratio with 
stroke risk by race in REGARDS. The albumin/creatinine 
ratio was not associated with stroke risk among whites 
(P>0.05), but among African Americans, the HR for a 
stroke event was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.01–1.96) for those 
with mild chronic kidney disease, 2.10 (95% CI, 1.48–
2.99) for those with moderate chronic kidney disease, 
and 2.70 (95% CI, 1.58–4.61) for those with severe 
chronic kidney disease.138
There are a number of paradoxical associations re-
lated to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal dis-
ease among African Americans. The likelihood of pro-
gressing from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal 
disease is greater in African Americans than whites.139 
Almost one third (32%) of the patients with end-stage 
renal disease are African American.140 However, once 
on dialysis, survival is better among African Americans 
compared with whites. In 2008, the mortality rate for 
patients on dialysis was 16% in African Americans 
compared with 24% in whites.140 Better survival on 
dialysis stands in contrast to the shorter life span for 
predialysis African Americans.141 A recent study also ex-
plored inflammation as a possible explanation for this 
observed paradox and found that this racial difference 
in end-stage renal disease survival did not exist at low 
levels of inflammation but is present at higher levels 
of inflammation as reflected by the upper tertile of C-
reactive protein (CRP; >9.6 mg/L).142
Sickle Cell Disease and Sickle Cell Trait
Sickle cell disease is a recessively inherited genetic con-
dition caused by a glutamic acid to valine mutation in 
position 6 of the β-globin chain resulting in hemoglo-
bin S formation. Subsequent sickling of red blood cells 
results from hemoglobin S–induced β-chain polym-
erization of hemoglobin tetramers.143 Approximately 
100 
000 Americans have sickle cell disease, account-
ing for 1 in every 365 black births. However, 8% to 
12% of African Americans carry a single mutation and 
have sickle cell trait. Although pulmonary complications 
and associated acute chest syndromes are the primary 
cardiopulmonary manifestations of sickle cell disease, 
there are vascular, thrombotic, metabolic, and myocar-
dial complications of sickle cell disease and sickle cell 
trait.144
Sudden death among patients with sickle cell disease 
is relatively high, with an incidence as high as 41% in 
some studies.145 Patients with sickle cell disease have a 
variety of electrocardiographic abnormalities associated 
with malignant electric problems, including prolonged 
QTc, which may predispose to arrhythmias.146 However, 
published reports of continuous electrocardiographic 
recordings in patients with sickle cell disease remain 
rare, and as a result, the effect of cardiac rhythm on

search also suggests that adults with sickle cell disease 
may have an imbalance of autonomic function, with a 
relative excess of sympathetic tone that might affect 
the initiation and progression of vaso-occlusive crisis, 
reflected by a propensity for arrhythmias, impaired car-
diac perfusion, and an adverse hemodynamic profile.147
Less is known about the cardiovascular risks for Afri-
can Americans with sickle cell trait. There were no dif-
ferences in the onset of CVD risk factors in a compari-
son of African American participants with and without 
sickle cell trait in the CARDIA study.148 However, sickle 
cell trait was associated with an increased incidence of 
ischemic stroke in the ARIC study (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 
1.0–2.0).149 In addition, emerging data suggest that Af-
rican American athletes with sickle cell trait are at high 
risk for sudden death.150 In a meta-analysis of the RE-
GARDS, ARIC, MESA, JHS, and WHI (Women’s Health 
Initiative) studies, sickle cell trait status was not signifi-
cantly associated with incident myocardial infarction 
(HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.73–1.64) but was associated with 
CHD (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02–1.98) in a comparison 
of those with and without sickle cell trait.151 Further re-
search on mechanisms and pathways is needed to ex-
plain the discrepancy between the 2 related outcomes.
HIV/AIDS
One of the emerging triumphs of 20th century medi-
cine is the transformation of HIV/AIDS infection from a 
fatal condition to a chronic illness largely attributable to 
the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. 
As a result, an increasing number of individuals with 
HIV infection are living longer and developing various 
cardiovascular conditions attributable to medications 
and the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology of 
HIV. A 2008 scientific statement152 presented evidence 
for the association of HIV with CVDs. Unfortunately, 
African Americans remain disproportionately affected 
by HIV infection, accounting for ≈40% of the 1.2 mil-
lion individuals living with HIV in the United States, and 
have the highest prevalence compared with other ra-
cial/ethnic groups.153
A few studies include enough African American and 
white patients with HIV to evaluate the possibility of a 
differential effect of HIV on cardiovascular outcomes. In 
a systemic review of African Americans with HIV/AIDS 
in the United States, 2 of 5 studies indicated that Afri-
can Americans with HIV were at increased CVD risk.154 
One of the few large assessments of CVD in African 
Americans with HIV is derived from a retrospective anal-
ysis of US National Hospital Discharge Surveys (1996–
2008) showing that of 1.5 million discharges, the likeli-
hood of hospitalization for CVD conditions was almost 
50% higher (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.39–1.51) in African 
Americans than in whites.155 However, an unexpected 
observation that warrants further investigation is that, 
when the subclinical coronary artery disease burden 
was compared between African American men with 
and without HIV in MACS (Multicenter AIDS Cohort 
Study), HIV positivity was associated with lower volume 
of total plaque.156
Pharmacotherapy to manage HIV may increase the 
risks of CVDs. Although race-specific data were not 
presented, HIV-positive adults tend to have more dyslip-
idemia, characterized as high triglycerides and low HDL 
cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, likely as a result of decreased 
cholesterol ester transfer protein activity157 compared 
with HIV-negative individuals. In the PURE study (Pro-
spective Urban and Rural Epidemiology), patients with 
CD4 counts ≤200 cells/mm3 who were treated with nu-
cleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine and 
lamivudine) and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (efavirenz or nevirapine) had significantly high-
er SBP
, pulse pressure, and hemoglobin A1c and more 
dyslipidemia over 5 years than untreated patients.158
Summary
Although the excess burden of chronic kidney disease 
and end-stage renal disease in African Americans has 
origins in the disparate burden of cardiovascular risk 
factors, some unexpected observations are presented 
as related to faster rates of progression to end-stage 
renal disease but better survival on dialysis. It is possible 
that exploration of the healthcare experience of African 
Americans treated with dialysis could yield insights to 
provide better management for whites. Investigation 
of the health implications of sickle cell trait is ongoing, 
and with the availability of inexpensive genotyping for 
clinical and research purposes, we can investigate pat-
terns in longitudinal studies in the population. As more 
research is carried out in diverse population cohorts of 
adults with HIV, we can gain additional insights into 
any disparities in the relationship of HIV status with 
CVDs in African Americans compared with other racial/
ethnic groups.
CONTRIBUTION OF GENETICS TO 
DISPARITIES
As a multifactorial disease, CHD has both environmental 
 
and genetic underpinnings, with almost 300 variables 
identified to interact in unpredictable ways.159 Con-
ceptually, embracing the idea that genes segregate to 
populations is the most accurate way to think about 
genetics in general with respect to multifactorial diseases, 
including CVD. In studies genotyping populations, cor-
relations have been made between populations and 
cardiovascular biomarkers, including inflammation, 
thrombosis, hypertension, lipid profiles, arrhythmia, 
and cardiac phenotype/left ventricular mass.

Genetic Loci for Inflammation
CRP is a heritable biomarker of systemic inflammation 
and predictor of CVD at the population level. Recent 
studies have performed genome-wide association stud-
ies (GWASs) of African American populations for ge-
netic relationships to elevated CRP
.160,161 In a GWAS of 
8280 African American and 3548 Hispanic American 
postmenopausal women from the NHLBI SHARe (Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphism Health Association Resource), 
a unique triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 
2 variant was associated with CRP in US minority popu-
lations, but genomic loci previously associated with CRP 
through GWASs of European populations demonstrat-
ed consistent patterns of association with CRP in Afri-
can American and Hispanic American women.162
In additional studies from the CARe study (Candidate 
Gene Association Resource) and race-combined meta-
analyses of 29 
939 individuals of European descent, 4 
loci were identified, 3 of which had been reported pre-
viously in populations of European descent.160 Among 
African Americans, the fourth locus was the CD36 
functional variant rs3211938, which is an extremely 
rare variant found in those of European descent. These 
findings were replicated in an independent sample of 
8041 African Americans from WHI. In the race-com-
bined meta-analyses, 13 loci reached significance, in-
cluding 10 previously associated with CRP and 1 previ-
ously nominally associated with CRP
.160
Other studies that have investigated genes associat-
ed with elevated CRP levels in diverse populations have 
found similar gene associations.160 In an investigation 
of 3109 African American and 6050 European Ameri-
cans from the NHLBI ESP (Exome Sequencing Project) 
and CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in 
Genomic Epidemiology) consortia, single-variant tests 
across candidate loci found an association of APOE ε2 
rs7214 and higher CRP levels in African Americans.163 
Exome-wide, associations of HNF1A, CRP, IL6R, and 
TOMM40-APOE were confirmed.163 Although these 
studies elucidated primarily genes overlapping with 
other populations, they also elucidated a few novel 
genes, demonstrating both common and unique po-
tential contributors to elevated CRP levels in African 
Americans.
Genetic Loci for Thrombosis
Fibrinogen is a major component in the formation of a 
thrombus, cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin, the most 
abundant protein present in a blood clot.164 Higher 
plasma fibrinogen levels are established markers of cor-
onary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, 
and atrial fibrillation.165–167 The heritability of plasma fi-
brinogen concentration as a predictor of CVD has been 
estimated to be 34% to 50%, with genetic variants so 
far explaining a small part (<2%) of this variation.168 
Fibrinogen levels have been reported to differ among 
European Americans, African Americans, and Africans, 
with the increased levels observed in those of African 
ancestry.169–173
Evidence that genetic variants in the fibrinogen gene 
itself are related to cardiovascular risk was first identi-
fied in a GWAS of 6 population-based studies.174 Since 
that time, a meta-analysis of 28 GWASs (which included 
8289 African American participants) evaluating clinical 
outcomes has been published.168 Twenty-four genome-
wide independent signals from 23 loci were significant 
(P<5×10−8), which included 15 novel associations that 
accounted for 3.7% of the plasma fibrinogen variation 
seen.174 Enrichment analysis of these novel associa-
tions identified roles in fibrinogen regulation for the 3 
structural genes and pathways related to inflammation, 
adipocytokines, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone sig-
naling.168 Although single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in a few loci were significantly associated with 
coronary artery disease, the combined effect of the 24 
fibrinogen-associated lead SNPs was not significant for 
coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboem-
bolism.168
The fibrinogen γ chain has 2 splice variants, γA and 
γ′, resulting in a poly-A signal in intron 9.175 Because 
8% to 15% of total fibrinogen is made of γ′ fibrino-
gen, the variability of total fibrinogen and fibrinogen 
γ′ in Africans is only partly explained by known CVD 
risk factors, with CRP being a major contributor.173,176 
Fibrinogen SNPs account for 1.4% to 3.8% of the vari-
ance in total fibrinogen in African Americans177,178 and 
2% of the variance in total fibrinogen in non-Hispanic 
blacks.179 Recent studies have investigated the effect 
of fibrinogen and factor XIII genes on total and γ′ fi-
brinogen and clot properties in black Africans.180 As-
sociations among total fibrinogen γ′ levels, rs1049636 
(fibrinogen γ chain), and rs2070011 (fibrinogen γA pro-
moter region) were identified.180 SNPs interacted with 
total and/or γ′ fibrinogen levels and clot properties in 
opposite ways, indicating that functionality should be a 
consideration in determining the effects of SNPs in CVD 
mechanisms and considerations of risk.180
Genetic Loci for Hypertension
The heritability of hypertension documented in adop-
tion, twin, and family studies suggests that 15% to 
35% of the correlation may be genetic181–185; hyperten-
sion onset before the age of 55 occurs nearly 4 times 
more frequently in individuals with a family history.186 
Together, the heritability of hypertension and increased 
predominance in African American populations sug-
gest that unique genetic associations may be present 
in the development of CVD. Although studies of BP as-
sociations with cardiovascular phenotypes in European 
descendants are extensive,187,188 relatively few studies

AND GUIDELINES
have attempted to replicate these observations in Af-
rican Americans.
In the first GWAS among African Americans, 80 
000 
SNPs in a discovery sample of 1017 African Americans 
from the Washington, DC, area were studied.189 Mul-
tiple SNPs in genes encoding a Na+/K+/Ca2+ exchanger 
and voltage-dependent calcium channel, respectively, 
are significant genome-wide for SBP
. No gene variants 
reached significance for association with diastolic BP or 
with hypertension as a binary trait.189
Subsequent genome-wide and candidate gene asso-
ciation studies with SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) using the 
CARe consortium (consisting of 8591 African Ameri-
cans) have identified additional genes related to DBP 
and SBP using 2 different genotyping platforms. None 
of these variants, however, were replicated in additional 
African American or European American cohorts, but 
3 previously identified European American SNPs did 
replicate.190 These findings support the notion that BP 
among African Americans has genetic influences on 
SBP and DBP at genetic loci found in European Ameri-
cans, with potentially unique genes needing validation 
in other African American populations.190
Admixture mapping is a method that can be used to 
detect disease variants with increased allele frequency 
differences in ancestral populations. Admixing mapping 
for SBP and DBP followed by trait marker associated in 
6303 unrelated African American participants of the 
CARe consortium identified 5 significant genomic re-
gions harboring genetic variants contributing to interin-
dividual BP variation.191 Overall, 3 loci were significantly 
associated with SBP and 1 with DBP and replicated in 
multiple large, independent studies of African Ameri-
cans, including the WHI, Maywood, GENOA (Genetic 
Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy), and HUFS 
(Howard University Family Study), and 1 native African 
sample (total replication size, 11 
882).191 A novel variant 
on chromosome 5 (rs7726475) between the SUB1 and 
NPR3 genes was associated with SBP and DBP in the 
meta-analysis of the replication set.191 Meta-analyses of 
the CARe samples with the replication data identified 
a significant association of rs7726475 and DBP
, high-
lighting the identification of genetic variants missed by 
GWASs.191
In an attempt to replicate the initial GWAS in African 
Americans described above, an independent sample 
of 2474 unrelated African Americans in the Milwau-
kee area (53% women, 47% men) was evaluated.192 
When the top 16 associated SNPs plus the 8 SNPs asso-
ciated with SBP and DBP in 2 genes (STK-39 and CDH-
13) found in European and Amish populations were 
investigated for their relationship with elevated BP in 
this African American cohort, no statistically significant 
differences were identified in African Americans, high-
lighting the importance of replication studies to vali-
date the findings of GWASs.192
Animal and human studies have demonstrated that 
genetic variations exist, and recent investigations have 
identified that rare polymorphisms in PCSK9 (propro-
tein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) are associated 
with BP in African American populations at high risk 
for CVD.193 In an analysis of genomic data from the Hy-
perGEN (Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network), 
2 GWAS SNPs were identified with DBP (rs12048828: 
β=1.8, P=0.05; rs9730100: β=1.0, P=0.05) but were 
not significant after correction for multiple testing.193 
Although the DBP did not replicate, an association with 
SBP (P=0.04) did replicate in REGARDS, suggesting that 
rare variants in PCSK9 may influence BP among African 
Americans,193 laying the groundwork for further vali-
dation studies and potential therapeutic considerations 
given the US Food and Drug Administration progress in 
approving PCSK9 inhibitors. Finally, in a discovery and 
meta-analysis that included 21 
503 African Americans 
from across 16 studies, exome-centric single-variant 
and gene-based tests identified 31 new loci and 3 new 
genes associated with BP
. Notably, these loci are en-
riched for known variants for other cardiometabolic 
traits, including dyslipidemia, inflammation, and insulin 
resistance.194
Genetic Loci for Lipid Disorders
The initial GWASs investigating associations of genetic 
loci with LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides in Europe-
an ancestry populations identified 19 loci. To expand 
these associations with circulating lipid levels and CVD, 
index SNPs were genotyped at 19 loci in NHANES III 
(n=7159).195 Analysis of non-Hispanic African Ameri-
cans, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic whites 
identified the index SNP at 5 loci associated with LDL-
C, HDL-C, or triglycerides in all 3 ethnic groups, which 
allowed the loci to be more finely mapped.195
These subsequent studies determined that 22 SNPs 
in 13 candidate genes were associated with HDL-C, 
LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.196 Variants 
in APOE (rs7412, rs429358), PON1 (rs854560), ITGB3 
(rs5918), and NOS3 (rs2070744) associated with ≥1 of 
these lipids levels in at least 1 racial/ethnic population 
were found.196 Multivariate linear regression analysis 
of 57 GWAS-identified or well-established lipid-related 
genetic loci with plasma concentrations of HDL-C, LDL-
C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol/HDL-
C ratio, and non–HDL-C was performed. With 1 excep-
tion (rs3764261 in CEPT), single SNP associations and 
the cumulative effect of multiple SNPs on blood lipid 
levels varied significantly by race/ethnicity. The findings 
were consistent for allele frequencies for all of the 57 
GWAS-identified or lipid-related genetic loci.197

the 4 mutations in the APOC3 gene had plasma tri-
glyceride levels that were 39% lower than those who 
did not. Those same mutations were associated with 
a lower likelihood of CHD in whites, but the analysis 
has not yet included African Americans.198 Another risk 
allele associated with CVD incidence is APOL1. Partici-
pants from the JHS who had 2 APOL1 risk alleles had 
a doubled (OR, 2.17; P=9.3×10−4) risk for incident CVD 
compared with those without a risk allele. These find-
ings were replicated in the WHI for a combined OR of 
2.12.199
Expanding on these initial studies, the Population 
Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology Study 
was established to determine GWAS-identified vari-
ants in diverse population studies. Across racial/ethnic 
groups, a majority of the 55 of 60 replicated genotype-
phenotype associations for HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglyc-
erides in European Americans generalized to African 
American (48%, 61%, and 57%).200 For associations 
that did not generalize, differences in allele frequencies, 
linkage disequilibrium, and differences in effect sizes 
may contribute to the differences observed and offer 
insight into how next associations studies are designed 
in the future.200
To determine the validity of recent GWAS identifica-
tion of loci/SNPs associated with plasma total choles-
terol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides, replication stud-
ies have been performed in 3 epidemiological samples 
comprising US non-Hispanic whites, US Hispanics, and 
African blacks.201 In African blacks, 7 SNPs were signifi-
cantly associated with at least 1 lipid trait, and 2 SNPs 
were associated with >1 lipid trait. These studies dem-
onstrate the mixed results found with these loci with 
respect to various populations, each with its own allele 
frequency and contributions to disease.201
PCSK9 (encoded by the PCSK9 gene) is a regulator 
of LDL receptors, and therapies inhibiting this enzyme 
have shown promise as a novel, effective therapy for hy-
perlipidemia. However, in an exome array conducted to 
genotype >200 
000 low-frequency sequences in 14 
330 
individuals of African ancestry, 4 low-frequency variants 
in the PCSK9 gene were identified that had large ef-
fects on HDL-C or triglycerides, but none of these were 
associated with risk for CHD.202
Genetic Loci for Vascular Structure and 
Arrhythmia Risk
GWASs have investigated cardiac structure and systol-
ic function in African Americans recently in the CARe 
study.203 Across the 9 cardiac phenotypes, 4 genetic loci 
reached significance for left ventricular mass, left ven-
tricular internal diastolic diameter, interventricular sep-
tal wall thickness, and ejection fraction.203 None of these 
were identified in the European ancestry consortium, 
revealing unique African American variants enriched for 
3 signaling pathways involving sonic hedgehog signal-
ing, β-adrenergic signaling, and the oncostatin M sig-
naling pathway.203 These 3 well-characterized pathways 
in cardiac remodeling suggest potential mechanisms 
underlying cardiac mechanisms associated with cardiac 
disease and potential targets for individualized thera-
pies in individuals with these gene variants.203
The SCN5A gene, which plays a role in cardiac con-
duction and repolarization, was studied in relation to 
QT prolongation in the JHS. A common variant in in-
dividuals of African ancestry is the SCN5A-1103Y al-
lele, which was found in 15.4% of JHS participants. In 
the 2% of participants with hypokalemia, there was a 
statistically significant (P<0.005) interaction whereby 
the allele was associated with prolongation of the QT 
interval by 15.6 milliseconds (P=0.02). In contrast, the 
association was modest for those without hypokalemia 
(4.1 milliseconds for each additional copy). The pattern 
of association between SCN5A-1103Y carrier status 
and hypokalemia was also observed for shorter QRS 
duration and longer QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals, and 
the findings were more pronounced among those with 
hypokalemia. The potential for diuretic-induced hypo-
kalemia warrants consideration given the relatively high 
carrier rate of the SCN5A-1103Y allele and its atten-
dant risks for sudden cardiac death.204
Summary
Concerns about the potential for the scientific commu-
nity to misuse genetic information has been a barrier 
for many African Americans to participate in genetic 
research.205,206 However, education efforts that empha-
size the value of such information for improving the 
health of African Americans could overcome many of 
these barriers. To date, genetic consortia have been 
the primary source of information on the contribution 
of genetics to CVD risk. As more cohorts that include 
racial/ethnic minorities join these collaborative efforts, 
the prevalence of risk alleles in minority cohorts can be 
determined, as well as their relationship with incident 
CVD risks. Finally, if the goals of personalized medicine 
are realized, these genomic findings may be combined 
with phenotypic information to provide precise charac-
terizations of individual risk for CVDs.
DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND 
PREVENTION
Declines in CVD mortality are estimated to be attribut-
able to the combination of the prevention of cardiovas-
cular risk factors and the application of evidence-based 
therapies.207 Below, we discuss the challenge of screen-
ing for disease in African Americans with subclinical dis-
ease imaging, the role of risk calculators for risk strati-

fication, and the evidence for tailored pharmacological 
management of disease.
Subclinical CVD
Despite a higher burden of traditional risk factors and 
adverse health behaviors among African Americans, 
the prevalence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is typi-
cally lower than among whites. Consequently, the in-
clusion of CAC in risk prediction equations could yield 
underestimates in African Americans.208 In the CARDIA 
study, the prevalence of CAC was 5% in African Ameri-
can women and 11% in African American men com-
pared with 5% in white women and 18% in white men 
in adults 33 to 45 years old.209 In MESA participants 
(mean age, 62 years at baseline), CAC prevalence was 
highest among white men (70%), followed by African 
American men (52%), white women (45%), and Afri-
can American women (37%).210
In contrast, African Americans have been reported 
to have higher common carotid intima-media thickness 
but comparable internal carotid intima-media thickness 
compared with whites. According to MESA, the mean 
common carotid intima-media thickness was 0.91 
mm in African Americans compared with 0.87 mm in 
whites, whereas the mean internal carotid intima-media 
thickness was similar in African Americans (1.11 mm) 
and whites (1.13 mm).211 The strength of association 
between carotid intima-media thickness and CAC also 
varies by racial/ethnic group, with the weakest associa-
tion in African Americans.211 Genetic predisposition is 
a possible explanation for weaker associations among 
African Americans. In MESA, there was a positive as-
sociation of European ancestry with CAC and common 
carotid intima-media thickness in African Americans.212 
However, these associations were not replicated among 
African Americans in the CARDIA and CHS studies.213,214
Differences in endothelial dysfunction between Afri-
can Americans and whites have been observed in some 
settings but not others. In older adult women, brachi-
al artery flow-mediated dilation was lower in African 
American compared with white women.215 Among 
young men, microvascular function (peak and baseline 
forearm blood flow) is lower in African American men 
compared with white women.216 In addition, nitric ox-
ide bioavailability was lower in African American com-
pared with white patients who were free from CVD risk 
factors, indicating poorer endothelial function.217
Risk Calculators and Stratification
Until the turn of the century, there were no risk predic-
tion tools based on data drawn on or validated in sam-
ples containing large numbers of African Americans.12 
A working group convened by the NHLBI on CHD risk 
prediction3 demonstrated that the FHS (Framingham 
Heart Study) risk equation performed reasonably well 
in predicting CHD outcomes among African American 
participants in the ARIC study using data from the base-
line examination in the 1980s.218 In response to con-
cerns about the validity of risk equations developed in 
an era when the CVD risk burden was markedly differ-
ent, FHS investigators published an updated global risk 
equation in 2008 that broadened the outcomes beyond 
CHD.4 However, the transportability of the equation 
from the nearly all-white, New England–based cohort 
to the African American at-risk population remained 
uncertain.218 The Reynolds Score improved prediction 
of ASCVD events by including family history and high-
sensitivity CRP measurements in the prediction model. 
However, similar concerns arose about the generaliz-
ability of the score beyond the predominately white 
and upper-socioeconomic-status populations from 
which they were developed.219
Risk functions for stroke were developed in the 1990s 
from the FHS76 and the largely white CHS study.77 Com-
mon predictors of stroke risk across cohorts were BP 
levels and treatment, prevalent diabetes mellitus, cur-
rent smoking, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hyper-
trophy, and heart diseases. Notably, dyslipidemia is not 
included in either equation, and there is a substantially 
heavier weight placed on hypertension as a risk factor. 
The CHS risk function additionally included measures of 
physical function and frailty (eg, timed walk). The Fram-
ingham Stroke Risk Function demonstrated good dis-
crimination of stroke risk for whites and African Ameri-
cans in the REGARDS study. However, the risk function 
likely overestimates stroke risk in the white population 
because of temporal declines in stroke risk, moving 
whites out of calibration and moving the higher-risk 
African Americans into calibration over time.220 That 
the risk factors for coronary disease and stroke differ 
underlies the somewhat modest correlation between 
the Framingham stroke and Framingham coronary risk 
functions (Spearman ρ=0.68).221 These differences may 
explain the absence of an association between age-
adjusted stroke and CHD mortality rates at the state 
level (Spearman ρ=0.04).221
The Pooled Equations published recently by the 
AHA/American College of Cardiology Working Group 
directly address several of these possible shortcomings. 
They are a central pillar for the 4 guidelines simultaneous-
ly published to address modern assessment and man-
agement of CVD risk222 and represent the first update 
on these topics since the publication of the Institute of 
Medicine’s landmark “Guidelines We Can Trust.”222a The 
guideline for the assessment of cardiovascular risk fea-
tures a new risk algorithm developed with data pooled 
from cohorts that included unprecedentedly large num-
bers of African Americans. One primary enhancement 
is that the risk model broadened the set of outcomes 
of concern beyond CHD to include stroke, a significant

initial ASCVD events among African Americans (and 
others) and has gained wide acceptance as a useful, 
broadly generalizable tool.224 Its easy accessibility online 
and its inclusion as a decision-support device through 
electronic medical record systems enhance its clinical 
utility. A limitation is that heart failure, another signifi-
cant source of disparity, is not included. Finally, no risk 
prediction models are useful for the prediction of silent 
myocardial infarction, which may occur substantially 
more frequently among African Americans.
Hence, despite possible shortcomings, the Pooled 
Equations represent the best effort to date to produce 
an ASCVD event prediction tool for African American 
and white adults and has been validated in indepen-
dent populations such as REGARDS.226 When this tool 
is applied to the NHANES data from 2007 to 2010, 
impressive disparities emerge: In the low-risk category, 
only 1.4% of African American men have a 10-year 
CVD risk of <2.5% compared with 18% of white men, 
36.5% of African American women, and 47.1% of 
white women.226 Frequencies in other risk categories 
are less disparate; however, more than half (≈54%) of 
African American men and more than a third (≈34%) of 
African American women who are without known dis-
ease have a 10-year risk of >7.5% for an initial ASCVD 
event (compared with 44% for white men and 22% 
for white women), a key cut point for determining the 
intensity of therapy and the consideration of pharma-
cological management of CVD risk factors (eg, the use 
of statins for dyslipidemias).226
Recently, a race-specific tool has been developed 
by JHS investigators227 using data from the JHS.228 The 
investigators developed a tiered approach to select an 
algorithm that combined optimal prediction perfor-
mance with ease of application in the primary care set-
ting. They also expanded the relevance of the model to 
African American populations by including heart failure 
and stroke among the outcomes. Marginal improve-
ments over the calibrated FHS and the new Pooled 
Equations were achieved by combining classic risk fac-
tors, brain natriuretic peptide, and ankle-brachial index 
measures. Clinical judgement is most often tested in 
cases in which the 10-year risk as determined by mod-
ern risk equations is neither high (currently meaning 
>7.5%) nor low (eg, a young person with substan-
tial lifetime risk but with near-term low risk using the 
Pooled Equations). In such cases, the JHS findings sug-
gest that imaging (echocardiography for left ventricu-
lar systolic performance), brain natriuretic peptide, and 
ankle-brachial index may offer additional useful data.
The authors concluded that, although the JHS- 
derived equations performed well in predicting disease 
and marginally improving risk classification over pre-
existing equations, they did not offer a substantial im-
provement in risk prediction among African Americans. 
This finding underscores (1) the enduring predictive 
power of the classic risk factors; (2) the fact that we can 
have reasonable confidence in the Pooled Equations in 
current wide use for African American and white Amer-
ican populations; (3) that any risk prediction tool is not 
intended as a substitute for a careful clinical assessment 
and may not be applicable for every patient; and (4) 
that a quantum leap forward in CVD prediction for our 
diverse population awaits further advances in the tools 
of precision medicine to assess environmental, genetic, 
and other determinants of risk.
Risk Stratification After ASCVD Events
Few algorithms addressing secondary prevention have 
come into widespread use because of confounding 
from treatment. In the REGARDS study, most of the tra-
ditional risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy) 
play a similar role in predicting incident and recurrent 
stroke; however, a history of heart disease was associat-
ed with an RR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.20–1.67) for incident 
stroke but only a nonsignificant (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 
0.85–1.40) risk for recurrent stroke.229 The substantial 
(P=0.0002) age-by-race interaction for incident stroke 
(with HRs of ≈3.0 at age 45 but 1.0 for age 85) was 
absent (P=0.99) for recurrent stroke, and no difference 
could be detected between the risk of recurrent strokes 
in African Americans and whites.229
Tailored Pharmacological Therapy in 
African Americans
Guidelines for pharmacological management of CVD in 
African Americans do not differ from management in 
other racial/ethnic groups. However, there are 2 nota-
ble exceptions, heart failure and hypertension, in which 
African American patients may benefit from tailored 
treatment approaches.
Heart Failure
The American College of Cardiology Foundation and 
AHA recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists as 
the standard care in heart failure. Digoxin (Lanoxin) and 
diuretics are also recommended as adjuncts to control 
symptoms. Studies conducted in African Americans 
have documented that this population may have dif-
ferent responses to these medications compared with 
whites.230
ACE inhibitors are recommended for patients with 
New York Heart Association class I, II, III, or IV heart 
failure and for patients with left ventricular systolic dys-
function.231 Despite robust evidence of benefit for ACE 
inhibitors for reducing mortality, the SOLVD (Studies 
of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) prevention and treat-

AND GUIDELINES
ment trial reported a smaller response to ACE inhibitor 
therapy (enalapril) in African American compared with 
white patients who had left ventricular dysfunction. Al-
though SBP and DBP were lower among white patients 
treated with enalapril and the risk of hospitalization for 
heart failure was reduced by 44%, there were no sig-
nificant reductions in any of these metrics among Af-
rican American patients. Neither racial group received 
significant survival benefits from Enalapril treatment.232
β-blockers are recommended for patients with New 
York Heart Association class I, II, III, or IV heart failure 
and for patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction.231 Results from BEST 
(Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial) reported a 
lack of significant survival benefit in African Americans 
with advanced heart failure when treated with bucin-
dolol (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89–1.53), whereas there 
was an evident survival benefit in non–African Ameri-
can patients (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.96).233 How-
ever, a recent meta-analysis using race-stratified data 
from COPERNICUS (Carvedilol Prospective Random-
ized Cumulative Survival), MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL 
Randomised Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Fail-
ure), and the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Study found 
potential survival benefit from bisoprolol, metoprolol, 
or carvedilol for African American patients with heart 
failure (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.38–1.16), although this 
finding is not statistically significant.234 The absence of 
significant results may be attributable to the smaller 
sample size of African Americans in these studies.
Hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrates is recom-
mended to treat African American patients with left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction and advanced heart 
failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), in 
addition to β-blockers and ACE inhibitors.230,231 Data 
from V-HeFT (Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial) I showed 
that, compared with placebo, hydralazine plus isosor-
bide dinitrates significantly reduced morality in Afri-
can Americans, whereas such survival benefit was not 
observed among white patients. In addition, results 
from the V-HeFT II suggested that white patients re-
ceived significantly more survival benefit from enalapril 
compared with hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrates, 
whereas this treatment difference was not observed in 
African American patients. From these results, A-HeFT 
(African-African Heart Failure Trial) was designed for Af-
rican American patients with New York Heart Associa-
tion class III or IV heart failure only. This trial was termi-
nated early because of a significant 43% improvement 
in survival in the hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrates 
treatment group. In addition, the treatment group had 
a 33% reduction in the rate of first hospitalizations for 
heart failure and 52% improvement in quality of life.235 
Another potential adjuvant therapy for heart failure in 
African American patients is supplemental aldosterone 
antagonist, particularly among those with left ventricu-
lar dysfunction. In the Genetic Risk of Heart Failure in 
African Americans trial, African Americans who had 
a common (62%) genetic polymorphism in the aldo-
sterone synthase gene (TT genotype in CYP11B2) had 
higher levels of aldosterone and worse survival in heart 
failure.236
It is tempting to conclude that different heart failure 
therapies should be recommended to African Ameri-
can patients. However, most of the current studies on 
heart failure therapies included only a limited number 
of African American patients. Thus, the lack of signifi-
cant findings is potentially attributable to small sample 
size. Although further study is needed, standard heart 
failure therapies should be used in African American 
patients with heart failure.
Hypertension
Disparities in hypertension control among African 
Americans are a primary source of disparities in CVDs. 
Reasons posited for the poorer control of elevated BP 
among African Americans usually focus on patient-
related factors (eg, adherence issues, dietary indiscre-
tion237), provider behavior (eg, inertia or poor regimen 
choices238,239), or blunted efficacy of some widely used 
drug classes (eg, ACE inhibitors) in African Ameri-
cans.240 However, the social and cultural environment is 
equally likely to influence the uptake and sustainability 
of preventive interventions. By carrying out research to 
elucidate the complexity of each of these dimensions of 
hypertension management (ie, social and cultural envi-
ronment, behavior, pharmacology, pharmacogenetics), 
we can determine how the overall environmental/bio-
psychosocial milieu impedes or improves hypertension 
care and control in African Americans.241 The ultimate 
goal is to generate greater precision in our care of Afri-
can Americans with elevated BP
.
There is evidence that race-specific treatment guide-
lines may be warranted. The British Hypertension Soci-
ety suggests race-specific guideline recommendations 
to treat individuals of African descent with diuretics and 
calcium channel blockers and avoiding treatment with 
ACE inhibitors and β-blockers because of suppression 
of the renin-angiotensin system.242 In the United States, 
the Eighth Report of the Joint National Committee on 
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of 
High Blood Pressure provides specific recommendations 
for hypertension treatment in African Americans.243 
One such recommendation is that a calcium chan-
nel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic be used as initial 
therapy for African American hypertensive patients.243 
Another that has been met with some controversy is 
the recommendation that the SBP threshold for diag-
nosis and treatment should be raised from 140 to 150 
mm 
Hg in adults ≥60 years of age. The Association of 
Black Cardiologists and the Working Group on Wom-
en’s Cardiovascular Health cite concerns about these

criteria given the large proportion of African Americans 
and women affected by hypertension and the risks of 
end-organ damage resulting from higher levels of BP
.244
ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treat-
ment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) provided the most 
evidence to support different responses to antihyper-
tensive regimens in African American hypertensive pa-
tients.245 In the ALLHAT trial, patients on chlorthalidone 
achieved better BP control than patients on other thera-
pies. Namely, SBP was 1 mm 
Hg lower than in the am-
lodipine group and 2 mm 
Hg lower than in the lisinopril 
group. The lowest risks for outcomes were also ob-
served among those on chlorthalidone. Patients using 
ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) had a greater risk for stroke 
(RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17–1.68), combined CVD (RR, 
1.19; 95% CI, 1.09–1.30), and heart failure (RR, 1.30; 
95% CI, 1.10–1.54) compared with those on chlortha-
lidone. These treatment differences were far more pro-
nounced in African Americans compared with whites in 
the trial and make a strong argument in favor of diuret-
ics as an initial drug of choice for treating hypertension 
in African Americans.245
The ALLHAT study also found a higher risk of stroke 
in African American hypertensive patients treated 
with ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) compared with a cal-
cium channel blocker (amlodipine; RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 
1.22–1.86); this association was not observed in non–
African Americans (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.89–1.28).245 
These findings are consistent with results from several 
other studies. Using pooled results from 30 randomized 
controlled BP trials from 1968 to 2003, a meta-anal-
ysis study showed that there was no evident benefit 
from ACE inhibitors in achieving DBP goals for African 
American hypertensive patients. This study also found 
that African American hypertensive patients did not 
benefit from 1 particular β-blocker, atenolol, in reduc-
ing SBP
.240,246 Similarly, several studies from the Veterans 
Affairs cooperative provide additional evidence that Af-
rican American patients respond better to diuretics and 
calcium channel blockers.240,247–249
Although African Americans are shown to be less 
responsive to ACE inhibitors, ACE inhibitors may offer 
benefits for African Americans with hypertensive renal 
disease. In AASK (African American Study of Kidney 
Disease and Hypertension), which is a comparison study 
of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), a calcium channel blocker 
(amlodipine), and a β-blocker (metoprolol), ACE inhi-
bition showed superior outcomes in relation to renal 
disease progression. Compared with calcium channel 
blockers and β-blockers, ACE inhibitors further slowed 
renal disease progression in African Americans with hy-
pertensive renal disease and proteinuria. ACE inhibitors 
also offered clinical benefit in the combined end points 
of glomerular filtration rate events, end-stage renal dis-
ease, and death for African American hypertensive pa-
tients with renal disease with or without proteinuria.250
Adjustments to systems of care characterized by 
evidence-driven protocols embedded in a team-based, 
registry-documented, simplified, and tightly orchestrat-
ed approach have resulted in control rates of 87.1% 
in a population that 10 years earlier had a control rate 
of 43.6%.251,252 Until truly precise and personalized ap-
proaches are developed, a reliance on systems-level ap-
proaches may offer huge benefits. These approaches 
are being rapidly adopted by major caregiving organi-
zations and have gained the endorsement of the AHA 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/
Department of Health and Human Services–Sponsored 
Million Hearts Program.253
Summary
There is ample evidence that the traditional risk factors 
for CVD predict clinical outcomes equally well in Afri-
can Americans and whites. More recent risk prediction 
equations that include stroke risk are particularly use-
ful for African Americans. The utility of these equations 
for counseling about disease risks, and ultimately for 
prevention, can be enhanced when they are coupled 
with the selection of pharmacotherapies specifically 
recommended for disease prevention among African 
Americans.
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL 
ENVIRONMENT
The social and cultural environment in which African 
Americans live provides the context that influences 
the implementation of screening strategies, the appli-
cation of risk prediction tools in clinical settings, and 
the uptake of evidence-based therapies.254–257 Existing 
research almost universally concludes that the combi-
nation of these factors complicates the prevention and 
management of CVD in African Americans. However, 
increased awareness and acknowledgement of these 
barriers have led to investment in strategies that work 
within the constraints of the environment to promote 
the cardiovascular health of African Americans.
In 2015, the AHA published a scientific statement 
addressing the social determinants of risk and out-
comes of CVDs.258 The objective of that statement was 
to provide a comprehensive review of factors outside 
of biology that contribute to cardiovascular health and 
stand in the way of progress toward reaching the 2020 
strategic Impact Goals.258 Unfortunately, African Ameri-
cans face an overabundance of adverse social and en-
vironmental characteristics today in the United States.
African American race in the United States is closely 
correlated with socioeconomic class. Approximately 
26% of African Americans are living in poverty com-
pared with 13% of non-Hispanic whites and 15% of 
the overall population. The median family income is

$43 
151 in African American households compared 
with $66 
632 in the US population.259 On average, edu-
cation levels are lower and health literacy is compro-
mised. As a result, preventive health resources (healthy 
foods, safe spaces for physical activity, psychological 
stability resulting from occupational stability) are not 
as widely available to the majority of African Ameri-
cans. Consequently, the challenge of improving health 
among African Americans requires a broader structural 
approach.
The AHA’s community guide for improving health at 
the community level127 discusses evidence-based strate-
gies that can create environments that promote healthy 
behavior changes and support the health of community 
members. Given substantial evidence about the contri-
bution of “built environment” factors such as limited 
access to supermarkets and healthier food choices,260 
an overabundance of advertisements for high-calorie, 
low-nutrition foods and beverages,261 and limited ac-
cess to safe places for physical activity,262 significant 
change may require investments in local community 
infrastructure, large-scale prevention programs, and 
social policies to support changes. These strategies in-
clude the use of policies to influence the built and social 
environments such as restricting the sale of nonnutri-
tious foods in and around schools, labeling menus, pro-
viding incentives for food stores to build outlets in local 
food deserts, creating safe spaces for physical activity 
that are monitored to reduce the likelihood of crime, 
maintaining smoke-free restaurants and public spaces, 
and setting regulations about noise and air pollution 
from local businesses. These strategies may be particu-
larly useful for closing the gaps in access and availability 
for African Americans and other minority communities 
who face more individual barriers to healthy behavior 
change and prevention.
There is considerable diversity within the African 
American community, with a large and growing mid-
dle- and upper-class community. However, despite 
higher education and more socioeconomic resources, 
health outcomes are still poorer in African Americans 
whose socioeconomic status is comparable to that of 
non-Hispanic whites.263,264 Historical factors, including 
housing laws and the migration patterns of racial/eth-
nic groups in the United States, inform the racial com-
position and structure of neighborhoods and commu-
nities. Research indicates that when African Americans 
live in predominately African American neighborhoods, 
health outcomes are worse.265 In the MESA study, the 
incidence of CVD went up 12% with every 1-SD in-
crease in the degree of neighborhood segregation.266 
Hypothesized reasons include variability in the avail-
ability of safe spaces for physical activity or access to 
healthy foods, which interfere with prevention. On a 
larger geographic scale, CVD event rates vary widely 
by geographic location.224,267 Nationally, 65% of Afri-
can Americans live in urban regions (counties classified 
by the National Center for Health Statistics as “large 
central metro” or “large fringe metro”) compared with 
only 49% of non-Hispanic whites.268 Stroke mortality 
rates are 30% higher in rural regions of the country 
than in urban regions.269
Another explanation for persistent disparities across 
the socioeconomic range in African Americans is the 
multiple sources of stress and unique sources of stress 
faced by African Americans. Common sources of stress, 
job stress and strain, neighborhood-related safety con-
cerns, socioeconomic concerns, and major life events 
combine with salient sources of stress for African Amer-
icans such as perceived discrimination.270–273 Perceived 
racial discrimination is known to be associated with all 
aspects of health, including hypertension,274 weight 
gain and obesity,275 persistent inflammation and other 
subclinical processes,276,277 and incident CVD events.278 
The potential for interventions that promote positive 
psychological health (eg, mindfulness, resiliency) to 
reduce stress levels may be relevant in improving the 
health behaviors and ultimately health outcomes of 
 
African Americans.279,280
The effectiveness of behavior change interventions 
in the African American community is compromised by 
a number of factors. As a result of ingrained cultural 
practices or fears surrounding the healthcare system 
because of historical abuses, African Americans may 
be less likely to follow physician recommendations for 
behavior change.281 One of the most striking examples 
of the confluence of cultural practices, socioeconomic 
conditions, and attitudes among African Americans 
compromising the effectiveness of therapy is in man-
agement of the obesity epidemic. Although it is pos-
sible that lower levels of overall education or health 
literacy may contribute to the lack of understanding 
of the relationship among dietary intake, body weight, 
and chronic disease risk282 or that food purchasing hab-
its are influenced by socioeconomic circumstances,259 
it is equally likely that traditional preferences may be 
more influential than socioeconomic status in predict-
ing food purchasing behaviors.283 According to some 
reports, African American families and social networks 
do not promote positive lifestyle changes.213,284,285 The 
attitudes and behaviors that some African Americans 
have about weight may also influence the adoption of 
dietary guidelines.75,286–288
As a result, although individual weight-loss inter-
ventions show variable effectiveness, all weight-loss 
interventions are systematically less effective in African 
Americans according to a meta-analysis.289 In a review of 
weight-loss interventions, studies that were successful 
included cultural adaptation and, even more important, 
constituent involvement; that is, adaptation informed 
by the experience of the target group.290 Conducting

American community can enhance their uptake; 1 re-
view reports that 70% of interventions conducted in 
African American faith-based organizations achieved 
success in weight reduction.291
Summary
Although African Americans face a number of social 
and structural barriers to positive cardiovascular health, 
a number of strengths of the cultural environment can 
be leveraged to disseminate behavioral health interven-
tions (eg, the central role of the church for reaching 
women and older adults). Some of these barriers can be 
addressed by targeting the macroenvironment via policy 
changes at the federal (eg, Affordable Care Act), state 
(eg, cigarette smoking bans), and local (eg, food availabil-
ity in schools) levels. Doing so could create environments 
to support and sustain positive health behavior changes. 
However, finding strategies that reach younger African 
Americans and men with disease prevention messages is 
a challenge that must be met to change the trajectory of 
health in the African American community.
THE NEXT STEPS
To make progress toward our goal of promoting health 
equity and achieving the AHA 2020 Impact Goals, the 
significant burden of morbidity and mortality from CVD 
among African Americans must be reduced. Doing so 
will require collaborations across multiple disciplines, 
both within and outside of the traditional umbrella of 
healthcare providers given the complex historical, social, 
and economic reasons why African Americans experi-
ence poorer cardiovascular health. Efforts to carry out 
high-quality research studies should be supplemented 
by additional research on the dissemination and imple-
mentation of effective interventions to modify health 
behaviors and to mitigate CVD risks. New initiatives 
such as the precision medicine initiative (ie, All of Us) 
provide a unique opportunity to learn more about indi-
vidual genotypes and how therapies can be tailored to 
be maximally effective for African Americans.
However, such research will be effective only if the 
diverse spectrum of the African American population 
is represented. Despite the wealth of information that 
we have about the CVD burden in African Americans 
from surveillance studies and longitudinal cohort stud-
ies, African American men and socioeconomically dis-
enfranchised (including homeless) populations remain 
less likely to participate in research. Although these 
population subgroups are difficult to reach in any ra-
cial/ethnic group, historical abuses by the healthcare 
system (eg, Tuskegee Syphilis Study), which spurred a 
lasting culture of mistrust, may further alienate African 
Americans. At present, life expectancy among African 
American men is shorter than all for other racial/eth-
nic groups, and health outcomes among the socioeco-
nomically disenfranchised in the United States mirror 
those of populations in the developing world. Identi-
fying strategies to reach these groups with preventive 
and clinical care needs to be a high priority.
One strategy to begin to repair trust and to increase 
the engagement of all African Americans in the health-
care system is to diversify the workforce of healthcare 
professionals. In a recent report from an NHLBI Think Tank 
on Strategies to Promote Health Equity, a priority was 
placed on ensuring a diverse workforce of clinicians and 
researchers by creating unique transdisciplinary training 
programs.271 From the research perspective, identifying 
and addressing the numerous barriers to cardiovascular 
health requires input from disciplines as broad as anthro-
pology, public policy, and education, as well as traditional 
disciplines such as medicine, epidemiology, and psychol-
ogy. On the clinical side, healthcare providers who dem-
onstrate cultural competency in their interactions and a 
willingness to try to understand the perspectives of the 
patients they treat will yield higher-quality interactions. 
Although such skills are relevant for all healthcare provid-
ers, the infusion of the patient-facing medical fields with 
more African American clinicians (eg, physicians, physi-
cian assistants, and nursing professionals) may speed the 
uptake of these important principles. However, efforts to 
increase the number of clinical providers must begin with 
programming that builds the pipeline of African Ameri-
can students who are interested in selecting medicine as 
a career and who are prepared to succeed.
With the considerable amount of information that 
we have about the prevalence and sources of disparities 
in cardiovascular health between African Americans 
and other racial/ethnic groups, we stand poised to ad-
dress and eliminate those disparities with contributions 
from professionals with expertise in basic science and 
pharmacology, clinical medicine, and public health. By 
successfully translating findings from across disciplines, 
scientists and practitioners from other disciplines can 
apply innovative strategies to improve the cardiovascu-
lar health of African Americans.

This table represents the relationships of writing group members that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on 
the Disclosure Questionnaire, which all members of the writing group are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be “significant” if 
(a) the person receives $10 
000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person’s gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the 
voting stock or share of the entity, or owns $10 
000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be “modest” if it is less than 
“significant” under the preceding definition.
