Optogenetic strategies to restore vision in patients who are blind
from end-stage retinal degenerations aim to render remaining
retinal cells light sensitive once photoreceptors are lost. Here, we
assessed long-term functional outcomes following subretinal de-
livery of the human melanopsin gene (OPN4) in the rd1 mouse
model of retinal degeneration using an adeno-associated viral vec-
tor. Ectopic expression of OPN4 using a ubiquitous promoter re-
sulted in cellular depolarization and ganglion cell action potential
firing. Restoration of the pupil light reflex, behavioral light avoid-
ance, and the ability to perform a task requiring basic image recog-
nition were restored up to 13 mo following injection. These data
suggest that melanopsin gene therapy via a subretinal route may be
a viable and stable therapeutic option for the treatment of end-
stage retinal degeneration in humans.

nherited retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa
(RP) affect 1 in 4,000 people (1), causing significant visual
morbidity and blindness due to a progressive loss of photoreceptor
cells. Even in end-stage disease, the remaining retinal layers and
central visual projections remain structurally intact. Stimulation of
these remaining cells is potentially sufficient to mimic visual re-
sponses and restore vision, and by this means the subretinal
electronic implant has shown proof of principle for restoration of
vision in patients after severe photoreceptor loss (2).
An alternative gene therapy strategy involves the expression of
transgenes encoding photosensitive proteins in remaining retinal
cells, making them directly light sensitive in the absence of rods
and cones (3–7). A candidate protein for this purpose is mela-
nopsin, the photopigment naturally present in a subset of ganglion
cells that are intrinsically photosensitive [intrinsically photosensi-
tive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)] (8). Melanopsin is particu-
larly suited to this purpose since it is native to the human eye (9)
and therefore is less likely to be immunogenic. Melanopsin shows
greater sensitivity to light than alternative microbial optogenetic
tools such as channelrhodopsin-2 (3, 10, 11) or halorhodopsin (4),
but has slower kinetics. Furthermore, the melanopsin transduction
cascade involves the activation of ubiquitously expressed Gnaq/11-
type G proteins (12), permitting signal amplification in multiple
host cell types (13, 14).
Previous work used intravitreal delivery of an adeno-associated
viral (AAV) vector to express mouse melanopsin in ganglion cells
with restoration of visual responses (5). We investigated whether
human melanopsin (OPN4) could be effectively delivered via an
alternative subretinal approach, using a ubiquitous (CBA) pro-
moter to drive expression in all remaining outer retinal cells for
several reasons. Subretinal vector delivery is well established in
human clinical trials (15, 16) but has not been assessed in combi-
nation with a CBA promoter as an optogenetic approach for vision
restoration. Transduction of cells in the upstream retina maximizes
the potential of retaining complex processing of the visual signal.
Furthermore, increased availability of chromophore (retinal) in the
outer retina may be required for effective photon capture in the
absence of specialized outer segment discs. Other studies have used
AAV vectors containing a mouse bipolar-cell–specific enhancer to
target a melanopsin.mGluR6 chimera (17) or rhodopsin (6) to
bipolar cells via intravitreal injection. However, there is variation in
anatomy between primates and mouse models (18), and this may
render the intravitreal approach less effective in humans. Virions
delivered via intravitreal injection are diluted more in primates
compared with mice due to the larger volume of the vitreous, re-
ducing the concentration of vector reaching retinal cells. The inner
limiting membrane on the retinal surface is also thicker in primates
than in rodents (19), through which virions must pass to reach
target cells. The increased risks of an inflammatory response fol-
lowing intravitreal AAV injection (20) may also limit the trans-
lational potential of this route of delivery. We therefore assessed
Significance
Inherited retinal degenerations may result in blindness due to a
progressive loss of photoreceptor cells. We assess subretinal
delivery of human melanopsin using an adeno-associated viral
vector to remaining retinal cells in a model of end-stage retinal
degeneration. Human melanopsin, being already present in the
eye, is unlikely to generate an immune response when in-
troduced via gene therapy. Furthermore, this method of de-
livery has been proven to be safe in clinical trials and may be
more effective at delivering vector in primates than the alter-
native method of intravitreal injection. We demonstrate long-
term vector expression and restoration of visual function, in-
dicating that this therapy could be stable and efficacious in the
treatment of patients with end-stage retinal degenerations.

 transduction following subretinal delivery of OPN4 and whether
this could support long-term restoration of light sensitivity and
visual function in a mouse model of end-stage RP.
Results
Long-Term Expression of Human Melanopsin in Degenerate Retina Is
Achieved Following Subretinal Delivery of an AAV Vector. To model
the extensive photoreceptor loss seen in end-stage RP, the rd1
mouse was used. These mice have a nonsense mutation in the
Pde6b gene, which leads to rapid degeneration of rod photore-
ceptors followed by loss of cones (21). Retinal tropism was
assessed 4 and 15 mo after subretinal delivery of a single cap-
sid mutant AAV vector [rAAV2/8(Y733F) CBA-OPN4-IRES-
DsRed] in 6- to 8-wk-old rd1 mice. This bicistronic vector in-
cluded a DsRed fluorescent marker to permit visualization of
transduced cells within the retina and ensure vector-driven ex-
pression. Retinal flatmounts stained with human OPN4-specific
antibody showed widespread retinal transduction in treated eyes,
which was sustained up to 15 mo postinjection (Fig. 1 A and B),
but none in age-matched untreated controls (Fig. 1 C and D).
Human melanopsin showed appropriate membrane localization
(Figs. S1 and S2E), with the DsRed marker confirming vector-
driven expression (Fig. 1E). Histological sections demonstrated
robust and widespread OPN4 expression throughout the inner
nuclear and inner plexiform layers of the degenerate retina in
treated eyes, with immunohistochemistry using horizontal, bi-
polar (Fig. 1 F and G, and Fig. S1), and Müller cell (Fig. S2)-
specific antibodies and cell morphology indicating widespread
transduction of these cell types. There was no significant trans-
duction of cell bodies in the ganglion cell layer following sub-
retinal vector delivery, as assessed by cell morphology and
ganglion cell-specific staining (Fig. S2).
Human Melanopsin Expressed in the Degenerate Retina Is Able to
Mediate a Functional Response to a Light Stimulus. Expression
of the “immediate early” gene c-Fos is a marker of cellular de-
polarization and has been widely used to monitor melanopsin-
driven light responses in ipRGCs in the degenerate retina (22,
23). Comparison of light-induced c-Fos expression in the inner
nuclear layer (INL) of vector-treated versus untreated retina
showed a 2.5-fold increase in the number of c-Fos–positive cells in
treated eyes (effect of treatment, P = 0.0197, two-way ANOVA;
Fig. S3 A–G). High levels of colocalization were observed for both
DsRed and c-Fos (Fig. S3 A–C), and human OPN4 and c-Fos
(Fig. S3 O–Q), confirming light-induced depolarization of trans-
duced cells in treated retina. In addition, some adjacent c-Fos–
positive cells were observed that did not appear to express OPN4
(or DsRed), which might indicate depolarization of neighboring
cells and cell-to-cell signaling resulting from ectopic expression of
OPN4 in the degenerate retina.
Multielectrode array (MEA) recordings from ex vivo retinal
explants were performed 4 mo after subretinal vector delivery to
assess whether expression of OPN4 in the INL was able to drive
action potential firing in retinal ganglion cells, and therefore
generate a signal that could be centrally transmitted. The per-
centage of electrodes showing a light-dependent increase in action
potential firing in treated retinas (43.1 ± 5.6% electrodes, n = 6
retinas, n = 144 electrodes) was more than doubled compared
with untreated age-matched controls (18.1 ± 7.3% electrodes, n = 9
retinas, n = 88 electrodes; P = 0.028, two-tailed unpaired t test; Fig.
2A). Responses observed in untreated retina were consistent with
the activation of endogenous ipRGCs, whereas treated retinas in-
clude both these responses and those originating from ectopic ex-
pression of human OPN4 (Fig. 2C). In treated but not untreated
retina, some electrodes showed a reduction in spike firing rate
following light stimulation (Fig. 2B), which may add to the com-
plexity of the visual signal generated following OPN4 expression in
inner nuclear cells. Visualization of DsRed fluorescence using 540-
nm light (Fig. 2D) confirmed that the location of responsive
electrodes in treated retinas was highly correlated to areas trans-
duced by the OPN4 vector (Fig. 2 C–E and Fig. S4A), indicative of
these being responses from ectopically expressed OPN4.

 n = 3 retinas) versus controls (n = 22 electrodes, n = 4 retinas)
revealed similar overall light sensitivity between groups (Fig. 2F):
with half-maximal responses (EC50) observed at 13.4 ± 0.11 log
photons·cm−2·s−1 in electrodes from treated retina versus 13.2 ±
0.16 in controls (P = 0.26, two-tailed unpaired t test). However, at
subsaturating levels of light (3.99 × 1014 photons·cm−2·s−1), the
maximal spike firing rate was significantly higher on responsive
electrodes from treated retinas (80.0 ± 6.2 Hz, n = 54) versus
untreated controls (44.6 ± 5.4 Hz; n = 25; P = 0.0006, two-tailed
unpaired t test; Fig. 2 G and H). A range of response kinetics was
observed for both treated and untreated groups, including tran-
sient and sustained changes in action potential firing (Fig. 2B and
Fig. S4 B and C). At subsaturating levels of light (3.99 × 1014
photons·cm−2·s−1), the time taken to reach maximal firing rate was
significantly lower on electrodes from OPN4-treated retinas
(6.63 ± 0.5 s; n = 54) compared with untreated controls (16.9 ±
2.9 s; n = 25; P < 0.0001, unpaired t test; Fig. 2I), indicating dif-
ferent response kinetics between ganglion cells firing in OPN4-
treated retinas versus responses recorded from native ipRGCs in
untreated controls.
Visual Function Restored by Human Melanopsin Expression in the
Degenerate Retina Was Sustained at 13 mo. The pupil light reflex
(PLR) was evaluated to determine whether light-dependent sig-
nals generated by ectopic OPN4 expression could affect central
targets. Mice that received a unilateral subretinal injection of
OPN4 vector were compared with age-matched mice that received
a sham injection of PBS and also with untreated controls. The
consensual PLR was assessed to avoid any surgical effect on pupil
constriction in the treated eye. Two cohorts of mice were evalu-
ated, one at 2 mo after injection (Fig. S5) and another at 13 mo to
determine long-term functional improvement. Thirteen months
after OPN4 vector delivery, pupil constriction was significantly
greater in treated eyes compared with controls at multiple light
intensities (overall treatment effect, P = 0.013, repeated-measures
two-way ANOVA; Fig. 3 A and B). Pupil constriction was faster in
the OPN4 vector group compared with sham-injected and un-
treated groups (interaction between treatment and time on pupil
area: P < 0.0001, repeated-measures two-way ANOVA; Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, pupil constriction was significantly reduced in older
sham-injected (effect of age, P = 0.0018, repeated-measures two-
way ANOVA) and untreated (P = 0.0067) control groups

Human melanopsin expressed in the degenerate retina is able to mediate a functional response to a light stimulus. Multielectrode array (MEA) recordings
from ex vivo rd1 mouse retinas showed a higher percentage of electrodes demonstrating light-induced increases in action potential firing in treated retinas
compared with untreated controls (A) (P = 0.028, two-tailed unpaired t test; treated, n = 6; untreated, n = 9). Examples of raw data obtained from individual
electrodes following 60-s 480-nm light pulses are shown (B). Light responses recorded from electrodes from one treated retina are shown (C) [represented as mean
spike firing rate (in hertz) measured in 1-s bins; data shown are 30 s of baseline recording followed by a 60-s 480-nm light stimulus at 3.99 × 1014 photons·cm−2·s−1;
for original image of the retina showing location of DsRed-positive cells, see Fig. S4]. Visualization of DsRed fluorescence (dots) illustrates the area of the retina
transduced by the human OPN4 vector relative to the position of MEA recording electrodes (D). (Scale bar, 15 μm.) A representation of DsRed expression
(highlighted in red) is shown to indicate the transduced areas of the treated retina in C relative to the positioning of electrodes (E). In combination, this illustrates
an increase in light-dependent action potential firing within regions of transduced retina. IRCs generated from responsive electrodes in treated (n = 51 electrodes,
n = 3 retinas) and untreated (n = 22 electrodes, n = 4 retinas) retinas show a similar sensitivity of responses between groups (F), with action potential firing
detected at the lowest light intensity assessed (1.20 × 1012 photons·cm−2·s−1). The mean response of all electrodes to a 3.99 × 1014 photons·cm−2·s−1 light stimulus is
shown (G). Blue bars indicate duration of light stimuli (B, C, and G). There was a greater increase in spike firing rate in response to a light stimulus in treated versus
untreated retinas (H); and time to maximal response was shorter in treated retinas compared with untreated controls (I) (***P < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired t test).

 compared with their younger counterparts (Fig. 3 E and F). This
effect was not seen in the OPN4 vector-treated group (P = 0.217;
Fig. 3D), indicating a sustained treatment effect in the older co-
hort following OPN4 vector delivery.
To assess whether information generated by ectopic expres-
sion of OPN4 in the retina could drive visually guided behavior,
animals were assessed using a behavioral light avoidance assay
(24, 25) based on the natural preference of mice to avoid brightly
lit environments (Fig. 3G). Thirteen months after OPN4 vector
delivery, there was a significant difference in the percentage of
time spent in the brightly lit chamber between groups (treated,
37.65% ± 6.7; sham-injected, 64.66% ± 6.8; untreated, 57.65% ±
7.7; P = 0.03, one-way ANOVA; Fig. 3H), with the vector-treated
group showing behavior closest to wild-type mice. This was not
due to a difference in general or anxiety-related locomotor ac-
tivity, since the number of transitions between light and dark
chambers was similar between groups (P = 0.88, one-way
ANOVA; Fig. 3I). Functional effects seen were unlikely to be
mediated by residual cones in the rd1 mouse, since these cells
were morphologically abnormal and there was no difference in
numbers of remaining cells between treated, sham-injected, and
untreated groups (Fig. S6 A–D; P = 0.123, one-way ANOVA).
Furthermore, all rd1 mice selected were homozygous for the
gpr179 mutation (Fig. S6 E and F), excluding any input from
residual photoreceptors in mediating ON bipolar cell de-
polarization via the mGlur6 cascade in this mouse model (26).
Visual Responses Requiring Image-Forming Vision Are Generated
Following Melanopsin Gene Therapy in the Degenerate Retina. Pupill-
ometry and behavioral light avoidance indicated that subretinal
OPN4 delivery restored or improved light responses; however,
signaling to the visual cortex is not necessary to mediate such ef-
fects. To study cortical responses, we examined light-induced
changes in visual cortex blood flow using laser speckle contrast
imaging (Fig. 4A). Six months after subretinal delivery of OPN4,
both eyes were stimulated by 480-nm light of 2-s duration and ce-
rebral blood flow (CBF) recorded over the visual cortices. Treated
mice showed an increase in CBF with an initial peak at 5.4 s after
light onset, consistent with the peak expected in wild-type animals
(25) (Fig. 4 B and C and Fig. S7A). There was no clear corre-
sponding initial peak in the sham-injected group (Fig. S7B).
Finally, we assessed whether ectopic expression of OPN4
would aid image-forming vision. For this purpose, we used the
one-trial spontaneous object recognition test (27, 28). In wild-
type rodents with no retinal degeneration, a change in visual
environment disrupts object recognition, indicating that these
animals encode and remember the background visual environ-
ment in which an object is encountered (27, 28). By contrast,
mice with visual deficits are not able to detect the visuospatial
context of an object (29), indicating that they cannot encode
visual information regarding their environment. Object recog-
nition performance was analyzed to determine visual context
recognition: this was determined by the ratio of time spent ex-
ploring a novel object relative to a previously encountered ob-
ject. Two cohorts of mice were evaluated, one at 2 mo (Fig. S7C)
and another at 13 mo after injection (Fig. 4D). Following
OPN4 vector delivery 13 mo previously, treated mice showed a
significant change in recognition ratio dependent on their visual
environment (P = 0.04 for effect of visual context on object
recognition performance; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni

Visual function restored by human melanopsin expression in the degenerate retina was sustained at 13 mo. Representative images show levels of pupil
constriction observed 13 mo after human OPN4 vector delivery, compared with age-matched sham-injected and untreated controls (A). Significantly more pupil con-
striction was observed in mice treated with OPN4 vector compared with sham-injected (red*) and untreated controls (black*), at multiple light intensities (B) measured at
2 s after light onset (treated, n = 5; sham-injected, n = 8; untreated, n = 13). Time course of pupil constriction at 2 × 1015 photons·cm−2·s−1 demonstrated a faster response
in the treated group (C). Pupil constriction was not significantly different in treated mice (D) at 2 and 13 mo, whereas the level of pupil constriction declined with age in
sham-injected (E) and untreated mice (F) (2-mo cohort: treated, n = 10; sham-injected, n = 9; untreated, n = 12; ns, nonsignificant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, repeated-
measures two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test). In the behavioral light–dark assay, mice could move freely between the bright half (BH) of the test chamber
illuminated by a white light stimulus of 200 lx at ground level and the dark half (DH) (G). Mice treated with OPN4 vector 13 mo previously spent less time in the bright
half of the chamber compared with sham-injected controls (H) (treated, n = 8; sham-injected, n = 9; untreated, n = 8; P = 0.03, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc
test). The number of transitions between compartments was similar across groups (I).

 post hoc test; Fig. 4E). Combining younger and older cohorts,
the effect of visual context on behavior was highly significant in
the treated group overall (P = 0.003, split-plot ANOVA; Tables
S1 and S2). No significant changes were seen in sham-injected or
untreated control groups, suggesting an inability to form and
retrieve an association between the object and visual context in
these mice. Melanopsin vector-treated mice showed a behavioral
pattern similar to that observed in wild-type mice with functional
rods and cones in a test requiring image-forming vision.
Discussion
Data presented here demonstrate that a functional human mela-
nopsin gene (OPN4) can be delivered to remaining retinal cells in a
mouse model of end-stage retinal degeneration. This was achieved
via subretinal injection of an AAV vector using a ubiquitous pro-
moter, an approach currently validated in AAV gene therapy clinical
trials (15, 16). Ectopically expressed OPN4 mediated depolarization
of outer retinal cells and ultimately ganglion cell action potential
firing, resulting in long-term restoration of the PLR and behavioral
light avoidance up to at least 13 mo following injection. Finally,
subretinal OPN4 expression led to light-induced changes in visual
cortex blood flow and provided long-term improvements in a vi-
sually guided behavioral task that requires image-forming vision.
In combination, these results suggest that this approach may be
clinically useful in vision restoration in patients with end-stage RP.
In the interpretation of these data, a consideration is the
mechanism by which visual responses were restored. We believe
that responses detected arose from activation of retinal circuitry
involved in image-forming vision rather than augmenting existing
ipRGCs for several reasons. Human melanopsin was not detected
by immunohistochemistry in ganglion cell membranes in trans-
duced retinas. Similarly, light-induced c-Fos expression in vector-
treated areas of retina was seen in multiple cells within the INL,
whereas this pattern was not seen in the INL of controls. MEA
recordings revealed a greater percentage of responsive elec-
trodes in treated retinas compared with untreated controls, along
with differences in firing rates and response kinetics, suggesting
that a larger number of ganglion cells were generating light-
induced action potentials in treated retinas.
To assess functional responses in vivo, a number of assessments
were used including behavioral light avoidance since wild-type an-
imals with functional rods and cones show aversion to bright light.
Treated mice spent less time in the bright chamber compared with
control mice, which showed an apparent preference for the bright
chamber. This may be due to an inability of control mice to detect
the difference in brightness between the two chambers resulting in
exploration being guided primarily by nonvisual cues, for example,
subtle differences in temperature, auditory, or olfactory cues. In-
terestingly, previous work including rodless/coneless mice has also
demonstrated that mice have a preference for the front half of the
chamber irrespective of whether the animal was placed there first
or the test was performed in complete darkness (24).
Treated mice showed the ability to form and retrieve an as-
sociation between an object and its visual environment in the
visual context recognition task. In contrast, control groups were
able to perform the object recognition task using nonvisual cues
(since recognition ratios in these mice were above chance or 0.5),
but performance did not vary according to visual environment.
This test has been validated for the assessment of rod/cone-
dependent image-forming visual responses (29). Previous work
has also investigated the effect of changes in background irra-
diance on performance with wild-type mice requiring a sub-
stantial change in irradiance (e.g., an increase from 10 to 350 lx)
to disrupt object recognition performance (29). Therefore, con-
text-dependent behavior in treated mice is likely to be caused by
the change in visual environment, rather than any changes in
background irradiance caused by the different test arenas.
A potential concern is the effect of retinal remodeling seen in
end-stage degeneration on restoration of visual function. Mul-
tiple changes within the remaining retina have been described in
mouse models and human tissue (30–33), including neuronal mor-
phological changes, cell death, network rewiring, and formation of
gliosis between the retinal pigment epithelium and neural retina.
Certain elements of remodeling such as the glial seal may po-
tentially be overcome by subretinal injection, since the hydrostatic
force generated could allow AAV to penetrate areas of gliosis.
The process of remodeling does, however, demonstrate plasticity
(30), and since we use a ubiquitous promoter to deliver melanopsin
to the degenerate retina, it is possible that some of these abnormal
connections from a variety of cells are used to restore visual re-
sponses. The clinical phenotype in human RP is of a rod–cone
dystrophy in the majority of patients, which may also be variable
with previous studies demonstrating differing degrees of de-
generation even in the presence of the same genetic mutation and
level of vision (34). Careful selection of potential patients for
OPN4 optogenetic therapy would therefore be required since the
ideal candidate would have severely affected vision yet grossly
intact inner retinal structure (as visualized by ocular coherence
tomography) and some remaining inner retinal function, detected
for example using electrical phosphene testing (34, 35).
Human melanopsin as an optogenetic tool has significant ad-
vantages in its suitability for translation to patients. Being a
native protein, OPN4 is unlikely to induce an immune response,
and second, OPN4 shows greater light sensitivity than other
optogenetic tools. We detected ganglion cell firing during
MEA recordings at the lowest stimulus intensity tested (1.20 ×
1012 photons·cm−2·s−1), whereas previous reports document a mini-
mum stimulus of 1 × 1014 (36) or 1 × 1015photons·cm−2·s−1 (3) for

Fig. 4.
Visual responses requiring image-forming vision are generated fol-
lowing melanopsin gene therapy in the degenerate retina. Laser speckle cor-
tical imaging was used to measure changes in visual cortex blood flow
following a 2-s, 480-nm light stimulus of 2,000-lx intensity (A). (Scale bar, 1 mm.)
OPN4 vector-treated mice showed an appropriate light-dependent peak in cor-
tical blood flow (CBF) compared with sham-injected controls (B; treated, n = 5;
sham-injected, n = 4). The mean percentage change in CBF for each animal in the
first 10 s after light onset is shown (C). The dashed line indicates mean change in
sham-injected animals with SEM (gray). Visual context recognition testing (D): in
the “same context” condition, the visual environment is identical in both phases.
In the “Context Change” condition, there is a change in visual environment be-
tween phases, but all other factors are constant. The recognition ratio is calculated
as N/(N + f), that is, time spent exploring the novel object (N) as a fraction of the
total time spent exploring both the novel and a familiar (f) object. Thirteen
months after OPN4 vector delivery, recognition ratios for the novel object were
significantly different in treated mice when the visual environment was the same
versus when it was changed, indicating a visual environment-dependent change
in behavior (E) (P = 0.04, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni
post hoc test; dashed line, wild-type mean, *P < 0.05; treated, n = 9; sham-
injected, n = 8; untreated, n = 11; ns, nonsignificant).

 detection of ganglion cell responses following channelrhodopsin
gene therapy and 1 × 1016 for halorhodopsin (4). We also report
restoration of visually guided behavior in the visual context recog-
nition task at a light intensity of 50 lx, corresponding to low-level
indoor lighting. The brightest light stimulus we used was 2 ×
1016 photons·cm−2·s−1 during pupillometry (however, significant
differences between groups were seen at lower intensities) or
≈13,000 lx (Table S3) equivalent to daylight conditions. The
brighter stimulus intensity used for pupillometry in our experi-
ments compared with previous studies using melanopsin likely
reflects the use of different animal models (37) and our use of a 2-s
white light stimulus (chosen to be a more useful stimulus for image-
forming vision), whereas other studies used monochromatic light (37)
and longer stimulus durations more suited for activating ipRGCs (5).
The quality of vision that might be restored by OPN4 gene
therapy is likely to be affected by its response kinetics. Although
slower than classical (rod/cone) photopigments, the detection
of transient light responses following melanopsin stimulation
(Fig. S4B) as previously described (38) may be a useful input for
image-forming vision. Furthermore, not all ganglion cell spikes
are transmitted at the retinogeniculate synapse allowing for modi-
fication of the visual signal (39). Melanopsin gene therapy may
provide functionally useful vision in a static visual environment
such as in the visual context recognition test, which may be useful
to patients in terms of aiding navigation. For more dynamic
environments, modification of the visual input through devices
such as image-processing glasses (40) may be required.
The use of human melanopsin delivered via subretinal injection
using a CBA promoter for optogenetic restoration of vision has not
previously been described. We demonstrate effective transduction
of end-stage degenerate retina resulting in sustained restoration of
visual function. The effects may be mediated by transduction of bi-
polar and horizontal cells. This approach has significant potential for
translation to patients since, although technically more challenging,
subretinal delivery has been established as safe in current clinical
trials and provides the advantage of delivering a high concentration
of vector to residual retinal cells, whereas the alternative method of
intravitreal delivery may not be as effective in humans. Targeting the
outermost surviving retinal layers will likely allow greater levels of
signal processing to be performed by existing retinal circuitry, po-
tentially resulting in restoration of more complex visual responses.
Materials and Methods
All animal experiments were conducted as part of a programme of work
assessed by the Clinical Medicine Animal Welfare and Ethics Review board of
the University of Oxford and legally approved by the U.K. Home Office. They
were also conducted in accordance with Association for Research in Vision
and Ophthalmology statements on care and use of animals in ophthalmic
research. C3H/HeNHsd-Pde6brd1 (rd1) mice were 6–8 wk old at time of in-
traocular injection. Treated eyes were injected with a dose of 1.5 × 109 viral
genomes (vg) per eye of AAV2/8(Y733F) CBA-OPN4-IRES-DsRed vector, with
an equivalent volume of PBS injected in sham-treated eyes and age-matched
untreated eyes also used as controls. Further experimental details are de-
scribed in SI Materials and Methods, Tables S4 and S5.
