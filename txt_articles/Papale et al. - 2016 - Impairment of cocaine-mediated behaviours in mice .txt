Abstract Ras-ERK signalling in the brain plays a central role in drug addiction. However, to date,
no clinically relevant inhibitor of this cascade has been tested in experimental models of addiction,
a necessary step toward clinical trials. We designed two new cell-penetrating peptides - RB1 and
RB3 - that penetrate the brain and, in the micromolar range, inhibit phosphorylation of ERK,
histone H3 and S6 ribosomal protein in striatal slices. Furthermore, a screening of small
therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy revealed PD325901 as a brain-penetrating
drug that blocks ERK signalling in the nanomolar range. All three compounds have an inhibitory
effect on cocaine-induced ERK activation and reward in mice. In particular, PD325901 persistently
blocks cocaine-induced place preference and accelerates extinction following cocaine self-
administration. Thus, clinically relevant, systemically administered drugs that attenuate Ras-ERK
signalling in the brain may be valuable tools for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

Introduction
Exposure to drugs of abuse such as cocaine produces intense and long-lasting memories that are
critical in the transition from recreational drug-taking to compulsive and uncontrolled drug use
(Everitt, 2014). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the experience of drugs of abuse
depends on learned associations between drug-paired cues and the rewarding effects of these
drugs (Sanchis-Segura and Spanagel, 2006). Thus, preventing relapse following drug abstinence is
impeded by the ability of drug-associated cues to persistently elicit drug-seeking behaviours
(Belin et al., 2013). As a consequence, conditioned drug cues may induce drug seeking and relapse
behaviour. In the brain, cellular mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in normal learning and
memory processes are usurped by addictive drugs; hence, memories encoding drug-paired cues
resist extinction and contribute to high rates of relapse (Nestler, 2004; Miller and Marshall, 2005;
Torregrossa et al., 2011; Itzhak et al., 2014).

 In particular, Ras-ERK signalling has been implicated in both the acute and long-term effects of
cocaine using different experimental paradigms that mimic drug addiction in humans (Valjent et al.,
2000; Lu et al., 2005; Valjent et al., 2006a, 2006b; Lu et al., 2006; Ferguson et al., 2006;
Girault et al., 2007; Fasano et al., 2009; Fasano and Brambilla, 2011; Pascoli et al., 2011,
2012, 2014; Cahill et al., 2014; Garcia-Pardo et al., 2016). The use of pharmacological inhibitors
of MEK1/2, the kinases upstream of ERK1/2, has been essential in defining the role of ERK cascade
in lasting experience- and drug-dependent alterations in behavioural plasticity. Until recently, the
only available blood-brain barrier penetrating MEK inhibitor was SL327, but this drug has never
been used in humans, most likely due to toxicity issues and to the relatively low IC50 (0.18/0.22 �M
toward MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) (Atkins et al., 1998; Scherle et al., 2000). Another MEK
inhibitor unable to pass the blood-brain barrier but still widely used via direct injection in the brain is
U0126 (Favata et al., 1998). Regardless, it has been shown that MEK inhibition prevents condi-
tioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine and amphetamine (Valjent et al., 2000; Gerdjikov et al.,
2004; Miller and Marshall, 2005; Valjent et al., 2006a). Other studies have identified a key role for
ERK in drug reinforcement using the self-administration paradigm. Cocaine self-administration has
been demonstrated to increase ERK phosphorylation relative to saline controls in striatal regions
that mediate reinforcement, including the nucleus accumbens shell (Edwards et al., 2007;
Miszkiel et al., 2014). In addition, drug-seeking during exposure to cocaine-associated cues/con-
texts following the acquisition of self-administration has also been demonstrated to be ERK-depen-
dent, although its role during cue and/or context exposure depends on a number of different
factors, including the extent of cocaine training, brain region, and withdrawal duration (Lu et al.,
2005; Koya et al., 2009; Edwards et al., 2011; Whitfield et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013;
Doyle et al., 2014). One finding of particular interest showed that following cocaine self-administra-
tion, bilateral infusion of U0126 into the basolateral amygdala immediately after a short memory
retrieval session, attenuated subsequent cocaine seeking. This treatment was associated with a tran-
sient decrease in phospho-ERK, suggesting an important role for ERK during memory retrieval in
maintaining drug-associated memories (Wells et al., 2013).
To date, the knowledge implicating ERK signalling in drug addiction has not been translated into
clinically relevant applications due to the lack of drugs with low toxicity and an ability to efficiently
cross the blood-brain barrier. Here, we report on two new cell-penetrating peptides able to attenu-
ate the activation of this signalling cascade in response to cocaine. We further demonstrate that
these two peptides prevent the formation of drug-associated memories in the CPP. We also demon-
strate that PD325901, a potent MEK inhibitor already in clinical trials for cancer, was able to pene-
trate the brain and efficiently block Ras-ERK activation. Furthermore, a single in vivo administration
of PD325901 persistently blocked a CPP response and significantly accelerated the extinction of
cue-induced responding following cocaine self-administration.
Results
Two novel cell-penetrating peptides inhibit the ERK signalling pathway
Cell-penetrating peptides have been shown to hold good promise for the treatment of neuropsychi-
atric disorders, in particular for their generally low toxicity and tolerability (Ramsey and Flynn,
2015; Raucher and Ryu, 2015). Despite their potency is typically in the micromolar range, their abil-
ity to partially disrupt protein–protein interactions instead of blocking the enzymatic activity is also a
potential advantage. In addition, cell-penetrating peptides dissolve easily in water solutions and do
not require organic solvents, a major complication in the formulation of many small therapeutic mol-
ecules, including the more potent PD325901.
Bearing in mind these observations, we have designed and generated two active cell-penetrating
peptides, based on protein-protein interaction sequences found in Ras-ERK components, able to
attenuate the activation of this signalling cascade in vivo. The first peptide, hereafter referred to as
RB1 (Figure 1A), was designed around the 59–73 portion, the KIM sequence, of the ERK1/2 specific
phosphatase MKP3 (Liu et al., 2006). The KIM sequence is responsible for the interaction with the
common docking (CD) domain of ERK1/2. The second peptide, hereafter referred to as RB3
(Figure 1B), was designed with the support of molecular graphics tools, taking advantage of the
published crystal structure of a ternary Ras:SOS:Ras*GDP complex (Sondermann et al., 2004),

 compared to the crystal structure of the CDC25 domain of Ras-GRF1, a neuronal specific Ras gua-
nine nucleotide exchange factor (Ras-GEF). The peptide sequence (1173–1203 portion of the CDC25
domain) includes an a-helix crucial for the GTP exchange activity on RAS proteins. To allow these
peptides to cross cellular membranes and the blood-brain barrier, we added to their sequences a
portion of the HIV TAT protein (Gump and Dowdy, 2007), thus generating two distinct cell-pene-
trating peptides (Papale et al., 2012).
We first tested these peptides for their inhibitory potentials on ERK phosphorylation after stimula-
tion with 100 mM glutamate in an ex-vivo model of acute striatal brain slices. As a control, we used a
scrambled, inactive, peptide sequence (Scrambled, Scr). RB1 significantly reduced ERK phosphoryla-
tion starting from 20 mM with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 17.25 mM (Figure 2A,
representative pictures in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), while RB3 significantly reduced ERK
activity starting from 10 mM with an IC50 of 6 mM (Figure 2B, representative pictures in Figure 2—
figure supplement 1B).
We then investigated whether RB1 and RB3 may also affect the phosphorylation of (Ser10)-acety-
lated (Lys14) histone H3 (pAc-H3) and S6 ribosomal protein, (pS6, Ser235/236 specific site), two
well-characterised
ERK
substrates
(Santini
et
al.,
2007,
2009;
Darmopil
et
al.,
2009;
Orellana et al., 2012). RB1 was effective in reducing pAc-H3 with an IC50 of 1.12 mM (Figure 2C,
representative pictures in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Similarly, RB3 decreased the phosphor-
ylation of Ac-H3 with an IC50 of 5.2 mM (Figure 2D, representative pictures in Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1D). Both peptides were also able to reduce pS6 levels with an IC50 of 4.02 mM for RB1
(Figure 2E, representative pictures in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) and 3.69 mM for RB3
(Figure 2F, representative pictures in Figure 2—figure supplement 1F), respectively.
We then tested these two peptides in vivo by measuring their ability to block the phosphorylation
of ERK and downstream substrates upon an acute cocaine administration. Mice were pre-treated
with a single dose (20 mg/kg i.p.) of either peptide or scrambled control 1 hr prior to a cocaine injec-
tion (25 mg/kg). This peptide dose was selected based on previous work (Borsello et al., 2003;
Besnard et al., 2011; Papale et al., 2012). Five minutes after cocaine administration, mice were

 transcardially perfused and brains were harvested. A significant decrease of ERK phosphorylation
was observed in the ventral striatum of both RB1- and RB3- treated mice (Figure 3). In further
experiments we examined the phosphorylation of S6 and Ac-H3 in RB1- and RB3-treated groups 20
min following cocaine administration. Phosphorylation of S6 was reduced in RB3- but not RB1-
treated mice (Figure 4), whereas a complete prevention of phospho-Ac-H3 was observed in both
RB1- and RB3-treated mice (Figure 5).

perfusion chamber for 1 hr at 32˚C. Slices were pre-treated with either different doses of peptides (RB1 and RB3)
or scrambled controls (scramble RB1 or scramble RB3). After 1 hr, one group of slices for each condition was fixed
in PFA 4% for 15 min, while another group was stimulated with glutamate 100 �M for 10 min prior to fixation.
18 �m cryo-sections were processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-phospho p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr202/
Tyr204) or for immunofluorescence co-labelling the slices with anti-phospho (Ser10) - acetyl (Lys14) H3 or anti-
phospho S6 (Ser235/236) and the neuronal marker NeuN. Neuronal quantification was performed with ImageJ
software by counting the number of phospho-ERK positive cells and the number of phospho-Ac-H3 or phospho-S6
among NeuN positive neurons in each slice. The level of activation is expressed on the Y-axis as arbitrary units
(AU). Doses are reported in a logarithmic scale (Log10) on the X-axis. The IC50 was calculated for each specific
response using GraphPad Prism software.

 The MEK inhibitor PD325901 is able to effectively block the Ras-ERK
pathway in the brain via systemic injection
In recent years, some MEK inhibitors and Raf/B-Raf inhibitors, able to block Ras-ERK signalling in
vivo, have already been tested clinically for cancer therapy (Uehling and Harris, 2015; Wu and
Park, 2015). Therefore, those drugs represent ideal candidates for repositioning studies to address
efficacy also for neuropsychiatric disorders such as drug addiction. In order to verify whether these
clinically relevant inhibitors pass the blood-brain barrier, we tested the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD325901,
Trametinib
(GSK1102212)
and
Selumetinib
(AZD6244),
and
the
Raf
inhibitor
Dabrafenib
(GSK2118436). The doses of the inhibitors, as indicated below, were selected on the basis of their
previously reported effects on tumour formation (Hennig et al., 2010; Gilmartin et al., 2011;
Hofmann et al., 2012; King et al., 2013). For all compounds we followed the same procedure: the
inhibitor was given (i.p.) 1 hr prior a cocaine injection (25 mg/kg), and 5 min after cocaine administra-
tion mice were transcardially perfused, brains were harvested, and ERK phosphorylation was subse-
quently determined. An acute administration of PD325901 (25 mg/kg) completely abolished ERK
phosphorylation in the ventral striatum (Figure 6A). In contrast, Trametinib (5 mg/kg) and Selumeti-
nib (50 mg/kg) were not effective (Figure 6B–C), while Dabrafenib (50 mg/kg) had a partial but not
significant effect on ERK phosphorylation in the ventral striatum (Figure 6D).
As PD325901 was the only compound to fully prevent ERK phosphorylation in the brain in vivo,
we further investigated its properties by measuring the IC50 toward ERK phosphorylation. In the ex-
Figure 3. RB1 and RB3 have an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced ERK phosphorylation. RB1 (20 mg/kg), RB3
(20 mg/kg), or the scrambled peptides (Scr) were administered to wild-type mice 1 hr before an acute cocaine (25
mg/kg) or saline injection. After 5 min mice were perfused. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-
phospho p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204, scale bar 30 �m). Quantification of phospho-ERK positive cells shows
a significant inhibitory effect of RB1 and RB3 on cocaine-induced ERK activation in the ventral striatum. Two-way

 vivo model of acute brain slices, already used for RB1 and RB3, we found that PD325901 showed an
IC50 of 1.15 nM, similar to what previously reported by Pfizer (0.33 nM and 0.59 nM, for inhibiting
MEK1 in a cell free system and blocking pERK in tumour cells, respectively) (Brown et al., 2007;
Barrett et al., 2008) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).
Next, we investigated the role of PD325901 in cocaine-mediated responses, without pursuing
additional studies with the other compounds. We first determined in vivo the minimal effective dose
necessary to abolish cocaine-induced ERK phosphorylation. We tested increasing concentrations of
PD325901 (0.25 to 25 mg/kg), with complete blockade of ERK phosphorylation in vivo achieved at
2.5 mg/kg (Figure 7).
Long-lasting impairment of conditioned place preference after a single
administration of PD325901
The potent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation resulting from PD325901 prompted us to test its
potential benefits in the treatment of cocaine-mediated processes in the CPP paradigm. In this clas-
sical Pavlovian conditioning procedure, the drug serves as an unconditioned stimulus (US) that is
repeatedly paired with a distinct environment (conditioned stimulus, CS) within the testing chamber
and the animal learns to associate this specific context with the rewarding effects of the drug
(Tzschentke, 2007).
Figure 4. RB3, but not RB1 has an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced S6 phosphorylation. RB1 (20 mg/kg, i.p.),
RB3 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or the scrambled peptides (Scr RB1 and Scr RB3, 20 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered to wild
type mice 1 hr before an acute cocaine (25 mg/kg) or saline injection. After 20 min mice were perfused. Co-
labelling was performed with anti-phospho S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236, in green) and NeuN (in red, scale
bars 30 �m). Neuronal quantification shows that RB3 completely prevented cocaine-induced S6 phosphorylation in
the ventral striatum. Two-way ANOVA: effect of RB3 F1,14 = 25.29, p<0.001, effect of cocaine F1,14 = 26.30,

 We examined the effects of PD325901 on the retrieval of cocaine CPP memory (Figure 8A). Ani-
mals were trained for 6 days using an unbiased CPP protocol to associate one compartment with
cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on day 2, 4, 6, while a different compartment was paired with saline on day
1, 3, 5. Control animals received saline in both compartments. Twenty-four hours following the last
conditioning session, mice were given either a systemic injection of PD325901 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or
vehicle 1 hr before CPP testing (test 1, day 8). A significant preference for the cocaine-paired cham-
ber was observed in mice pre-treated with vehicle, whereas PD325901-treated mice failed to dem-
onstrate a conditioned response (Figure 8B).
To test the enduring effect of PD325901 on the cocaine memory, animals were retested in a
drug-free state in the CPP apparatus 2 weeks later (day 22). While vehicle-treated animals continued
to show a side preference, indicative of the persistence of the cocaine memory, PD325901-treated
mice still lacked a conditioned cocaine preference (Figure 8C). On the following day (day 23), both
groups of mice were re-exposed to a cocaine conditioning session in the same drug-paired environ-
ment to reactivate the drug-related memory acquired during previous training. 24 hr later, another
test of preference was given (test 3, day 24). Cocaine re-exposure failed to affect PD325901-treated
animals, while in vehicle-treated animals, a robust behavioural response was still observed
(Figure 8D). We ruled out any possible confounding effect on locomotor functions as a consequence
of PD pre-treatment by measuring the distance travelled in the CPP apparatus on day 1 and day 8.

 No difference among groups was observed (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). As additional confir-
mation, we monitored the horizontal activity of a different cohort of mice using locomotor activity
cages equipped with an automatic infrared movement detector system. The activity was observed
starting 30 min after an injection of PD325901 (10 mg/kg) and recorded every 5 min for a total of 6
trials. At the end of this session mice received a cocaine challenge (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and the effect of
PD325901 pre-treatment on the hyper-locomotion induced by cocaine was evaluated for 30 min. No
effects of PD325901 pretreatment were detected on spontaneous locomotion and cocaine-induced
locomotion (Figure 8—figure supplement 2).

 Furthermore, we investigated whether the inhibition of retrieval of cocaine-related memories in
CPP was specifically due to MEK inhibition in the brain. Thus, we selected one compound from our
previous experiment (see Figure 6), Trametinib, as a negative control for use in cocaine CPP.
In contrast to PD325901, a single administration of 10 mg/kg of Trametinib did not interfere with
the expression of CPP (Figure 8—figure supplement 3).
Partial inhibition of RB1 and RB3 peptides on the retrieval of cocaine
CPP
Despite the relevant effect of PD325901 on conditioned place preference, we decided also to test
our RB1 and RB3 peptides in the same drug-related memory retrieval paradigm (Figure 8—figure
supplement 4A). In this test we decided to use a mix of the two peptides, to obtain the highest inhi-
bition possible of the Ras-ERK pathway. Mice received either a systemic injection of an RB1/RB3 mix
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) or scrambled control 1 hr prior to CPP testing (test 1). As expected, control mice
showed a robust preference for the cocaine-paired compartment, while mice pre-treated with the
RB1/RB3 mix failed to demonstrate a cocaine preference (Figure 8—figure supplement 4B). Ani-
mals were retested 2 weeks later (test 2) in a drug-free state, during which preference for the
cocaine-paired environment was significantly lower than that of control mice (Figure 8—figure sup-
plement 4C). The day following test 2 (day 23), mice underwent a conditioning session in the CPP
apparatus immediately after cocaine or saline injection. Cocaine CPP was tested the following day
(day 24, test 3). RB1/RB3 pre-treated group showed only a partial preference for the cocaine side
compared to vehicle group (Figure 8—figure supplement 4D).

rewarding properties of cocaine (20 mg/kg i.p.) were first measured on day 8 (test 1). Mice treated with cocaine or
saline during conditioning were further divided in 2 groups and received an acute injection of the MEK inhibitor,
PD325901 (10 mg/kg i.p.), or DMSO vehicle 1 hr before test 1. A single administration of PD325901 fully inhibited
CPP. A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of drug F1,35 = 4.305, p<0.05, effect of PD325901 F1,35 =

 PD325901 attenuated cue responding following cocaine self-
administration
To examine the potential therapeutic effect of PD325901 in a more clinically relevant paradigm, we
also attempted to determine whether PD325901 would produce a reduction in cocaine seeking
when administered prior to a short cue-only retrieval session following cocaine self-administration in
mice. Mice underwent daily 1-hr cocaine self-administration for 7 consecutive days (days 1–7) with
no prior lever training. Cocaine (0.50 mg/kg in a 14 ml infusion) delivery was contingent upon press-
ing on the active lever under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement and paired with the 20 s presentation
of a blinking light stimulus (CS), which also served as a timeout period, during which lever presses
were not reinforced. Presses on the inactive lever were recorded but had no scheduled conse-
quence. Twenty-four hours following the last cocaine self-administration session, mice were given a
single 10-minutes CS-only retrieval session (day 8), preceded 30 min by a vehicle (10 ml/kg) or
PD325901 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) injection, during which presses on the active lever were not reinforced,
but the CS was presented. Beginning the following day, mice were presented with 10 daily 1-hr
extinction sessions (days 9–18), during which presses on the active lever were not reinforced, but the
CS was presented, to determine the effect of PD325901 administered during the short retrieval trial
on subsequent cue responding. Figure 9A shows the timeline of the self-administration protocol.
Prior to vehicle or MEK inhibitor treatment on day 8, both groups demonstrated similar acquisition
of cocaine self-administration (days 1–7), as demonstrated by a similar number of lever presses
(Figure 9B) and number of cocaine reinforcers achieved (Figure 9C) during 7 daily 1-hr sessions of
cocaine SA (0.50 mg/kg/infusion). Furthermore, responding for the CS in the absence of cocaine dur-
ing the 10-min retrieval trial preceded by vehicle or MEK inhibitor administration on day 8 also did
not differ. However, mice pre-treated with PD325901 demonstrated a significant decrease in active
lever responding relative to vehicle controls across 10 daily 1-hr CS-only extinction sessions (days 9–
18; Figure 9D). These data indicate that PD325901 administered prior to a brief CS-only retrieval
trial had long-lasting consequences and attenuated subsequent responding in the presence of the
CS.
10 mg/kg of PD325901 does not cause memory impairments in novel
object recognition and inhibitory avoidance tests
Maladaptive cognitive mechanisms are at the basis of addiction. In particular, it is well established
that CPP relies on Pavlovian conditioning while self-administration is a form of instrumental learning.
Indeed, inhibition of the Ras-ERK signalling pathway results in long-term memory deficits in a num-
ber of behavioural tests in rodents (Adams and Sweatt, 2002; Davis and Laroche, 2006;
Fasano and Brambilla, 2011).
In order to verify whether 10 mg/kg of PD325901 may interfere with memory processes in gen-
eral, we performed two well-established memory tasks, the novel object recognition (NOR) and the
inhibitory avoidance (IA), which previous work has shown to be sensitive to MEK inhibition
(Kelly et al., 2003; Goeldner et al., 2008; Cestari et al., 2014). In these tasks, we assessed the
effect of PD325901 on both memory consolidation and retrieval.
Firstly, we tested memory acquisition in the NOR paradigm: after a short habituation session in
the empty arena on day 1, mice were pre-treated with 10 mg/kg of PD325901 one hour before the
training session on day 2, and then tested for their 24 hr long-term memory (Figure 10A).
PD325901 had no effect on the basal preference or the motivational state of the animals
(Figure 10B–C), and the percentage of time exploring the novel object was significantly higher than
the percentage of time exploring the familiar object in both groups (Figure 10D). The discrimination
index (DI) of the PD325901 treated group was equivalent to that of the vehicle treated group
(Figure 10E). Furthermore, we calculated also the recognition index (RI), a recently described index
that takes into account possible biases due to spatial preferences (d’Isa et al., 2014). While the DI
measures the ability to discriminate between two objects presented at a same time point, the RI

 quantifies the ability to recognize an object across different time points. The RI of the PD325901
treated group was equivalent to that of the vehicle treated group (Figure 10F). We next repeated
the same experiment using a higher dose of PD325901 (25 mg/kg). Neither basal preference nor
motivational state of the animals was affected (Figure 10G–H). In contrast, for the PD325901
treated-group percentages of time spent exploring the familiar object were closer to chance level
(50%) than in controls (Figure 10I). As a consequence, both DI and RI were found significantly lower
in PD325901 treated animals than vehicle treated animals (Figure 10J–K). These data indicate that

Mice first underwent 7d of daily 1 hr cocaine self-administration sessions (days 1–7). There were no differences in
cocaine self-administration based on treatment group prior to drug manipulations, as indicated by a similar

day 8, during which lever pressing resulted in the CS but no cocaine. No difference in the groups was observed. A

Figure 10. A single dose of PD325901 at 10 mg/kg does not affect acquisition of the Novel Object Recognition.
(A) After a 5 min habituation session in the empty arena on day 1, mice were injected with PD325901 (10 or 25 mg/
kg) or vehicle one hour before the 10 min training session with two identical objects on day 2 and were then
evaluated for their 24 hr long-term memory in a 10 min testing session on day 3. (B) PD325901 10 mg/kg had no
effect on basal preferences, as for both groups percentages of exploration of the two objects resulted to be
comparable (Paired-samples t-test, PD325901: t9 = 0.220, p=0.831; VEH: t9 = �0226, p=0.827). (C) Total time of
object exploration was equivalent between groups, meaning that PD325901 injection had no influence on the
motivational state of the animals (Independent-samples t-test: t18 = �0.083, p=0.935). (D) On day 3, animals
underwent the test for their 24 hr long-term memory. For both groups, the percentage of time spent exploring the
novel object was significantly higher than the percentage of time spent exploring the familiar object (Paired-
samples t-test, PD325901: t9 = 14.788, p<0.0001; VEH: t9 = 13.623, p<0.0001), indicating a significant learning. (E)
The discrimination index (D.I.) of the PD325901-injected group was similar to the vehicle injected group
(PD325901: 0.337 ± 0.023, VEH: 0.346 ± 0.025; Independent-samples t-test: t18 = �0.258, p=0.799) and above
chance level (One-sample t-test, PD325901: t9 = 14.819, p<0.0001; VEH: t9 = 13.615, p<0.0001), indicating that 10
mg/kg of PD325901 did not affect the acquisition process in this memory test. (F) The recognition index (R.I.),
based on the ability of an animal to recognize a same object at different time points, showed that the memory of
the PD325901-treated group was equivalent to the vehicle treated group (PD325901: 0.339 ± 0.023, VEH: 0.347 ±
0.030; Independent-samples t-test: t18 = �2.17, p=0.830) and significantly above chance level (One-sample t-test,
PD325901: t9 = 14.697, p<0.0001; VEH: t9 = 11.628, p<0.0001). PD325901 (n = 10), VEH (n =10). (G) PD325901 25
mg/kg had no effect on basal preferences, as for both groups percentages of exploration of the two objects were
similar (Paired-samples t-test, PD325901: t9 = �0.250, p=0.808; VEH: t8 = 0.137, p=0.895). (H) Total time of object
exploration was equivalent between groups, meaning that a higher dose of PD325901 had no impact on the
motivational state of animals (Independent-samples t-test: t17 = 0.326, p=0.749). (I) On day 3, animals underwent
the test for their 24 hr long-term memory. For both groups, the percentage of time spent exploring the novel
object was higher than the percentage of time spent exploring the familiar object (Paired-samples t-test,
PD325901: t9 = 3.551, p<0.01; VEH: t8 = 7.819, p<0.0001). Importantly, the time spent exploring the familiar object
was significantly lower in the vehicle treated group than in the PD325901 treated group (Independent-samples
t-test: t17 = 3.561, p<0.01) indicating that PD325901 injection partially perturbed the recognition of the familiar
object. (J) The D.I. of the PD325901-injected group was lower, by 39.75%, indicating that 25 mg/kg of PD325901
significantly interfered with memory acquisition (PD325901: 0.137 ± 0.039, VEH: 0.345 ± 0.044; Independent-
samples t-test: t17 = �3.560, p<0.01) but still above chance level (One-sample t-test, PD325901: t9 = 3.548,
p=0.006; VEH: t8 = 7.818, p<0.0001). (K) Analysis of the R.I. showed that for both groups the percentage of time

 while 10 mg/kg of PD325901 had no effect on memory consolidation at 24 hr, 25 mg/kg did result
in memory consolidation impairment.
Next, we investigated whether 10 mg/kg of PD325901 influenced the retrieval of recognition
memory. In this experimental design, mice explored two identical objects on day 2 and received an
injection of PD325901 (10 mg/kg) one hour before the test session with two different objects on day
3 (Figure 11A). On day 2, no statistically significant difference was present between the basal pref-
erences (Figure 11B). On day 3, PD325901 did not alter the exploratory behaviour and both groups
spent more time exploring the novel object, indicating a significant learning (Figure 11C–D).
The DI and RI of the PD325901-injected group were equivalent to the control group, suggesting
that the retrieval of recognition memory was intact (Figure 11E–F). Using a higher dose of
PD325901 (25 mg/kg) no basal preferences were evident in both groups (Figure 11G). On day 3,
one hour after PD325901 injection, both groups explored the novel object to a greater extent,
although in the PD325901 group recognition of the familiar object was partially perturbed
(Figure 11H), despite the motivational state of the animals being normal (Figure 11I). The DI and RI
of the PD325901-injected group was lower, by more than 20% indicating that this dose of PD325901
significantly interfered with the retrieval of recognition memory (Figure 11J–K).
We next explored the effects of the two different doses of PD325901 (10 or 25 mg/kg) on the
consolidation and retrieval of fear memory using the Inhibitory avoidance test. Animals were placed
in a lighted arena and when they entered the dark compartment, they received an aversive foot
shock. Immediately after training, animals received an injection of PD325901 (10 or 25 mg/kg, i.p.)
and were then evaluated for their 24 hr memory on the subsequent day (Figure 12A). 10 mg/kg of
PD325901 did not perturb the consolidation of the inhibitory-avoidance learning, since at this dose
both groups showed a significant increase in latency, whereas 25 mg of PD325901 significantly dis-
rupted memory consolidation (Figure 12B). This dose-dependent effect was also observed when the
compound was injected one hour before the test session, to evaluate its effect on memory retrieval
(Figure 12C). Animal injected with a dose of 10 mg/kg of PD325901 showed a significant increase in
latencies, while the group treated with a dose of 25 mg/kg did not (Figure 12D).
Discussion
Cocaine use remains a global public health concern and is associated with significant medical and
psychiatric comorbidities. Although knowledge of reward mechanisms has significantly increased in
recent decades, there are currently no approved medications for the treatment of cocaine depen-
dence and behavioural treatment has shown limited efficacy (Shorter et al., 2015).
Among the potential target candidates, the Ras-ERK signalling pathway holds a unique position.
First, it is a well-characterised cascade, highly studied in the context of cancer therapy and in neuro-
science. Second, it is selectively activated by cocaine in D1 expressing medium spiny neurons of the
striatum, the same cells implicated in the behavioural responses to this drug. Third, its inhibition in
the brain leads to blockade of cocaine-mediated responses. Fourth, its implication in both memory
consolidation and reconsolidation processes predicts a relevant adjuvant role in the definition of
behavioural therapies to treat addiction (Fasano and Brambilla, 2011; Cerovic et al., 2013;
Pascoli et al., 2014; Garcia-Pardo et al., 2016).
To date, the major limitation to a therapeutic approach to treat cocaine dependence based on

blood-brain barrier. Here, we show an initial characterization of three compounds, two newly

Figure 11. A single dose of PD325901 at 10 mg/kg does not affect retrieval of the Novel Object Recognition. (A)
After a 5 min habituation session in the empty arena on day 1, mice were allowed to explore two identical objects
in a 10 min training session on day 2. On the subsequent day, one hour before the test session mice received an
injection of PD325901 (10 or 25 mg/kg) or vehicle and were then evaluated for their 24 hr long-term memory. (B)
On day 2, no statistically significant difference was present between the basal preferences, as for both groups
percentages of exploration of the two objects resulted to be comparable (Paired-samples t-test, PD325901: t9 =
0.587, p=0.572; VEH: t8 = 0.059, p=0.955). (C) On day 3, PD325901 did not alter the exploratory behaviour as the
percentage of time spent exploring the novel object was significantly higher than the percentage of time spent on
the familiar object for both groups, (Paired-samples t-test, PD325901: t9 = 10.886, p<0.0001; VEH: t8 = 7.424,
p<0.0001), indicating a significant learning. (D) Total time of object exploration was equivalent between groups,
meaning that PD325901 injection had no influence on the motivational state of the animals (Independent-samples
t-test: t17 = �0.264, p=0.795). (E) The discrimination index (D.I.) of the PD325901-injected group was similar to the
Vehicle injected group (PD325901: 0.375 ± 0.034, VEH: 0.347 ± 0.047; Independent-samples t-test: t17 = 0.493,
p=0.628) and above chance level for both groups (One-sample t-test, PD325901: t9 = 10.871, p<0.0001; VEH: t8 =
7.426, p<0.0001), indicating that the retrieval of recognition memory was intact. (F) The recognition index (R.I.)
showed that the recognition memory of the PD325901-treated group was equivalent to Vehicle treated group
(PD325901: 0.380 ± 0.030, VEH: 0.349 ± 0.041; Independent-samples t-test: t17 = 0.617, p=0.545) and significantly

= 10), VEH (n = 9). (G) On day 2, no statistically significant difference was present between the basal preferences,
as for both groups percentages of exploration of the two objects resulted to be comparable (Paired-samples
t-test, PD325901: t9 = 0.813, p=0.437; VEH: t8 = 2.176, p=0.061). (H) On day 3, animals received an injection of 25
mg/kg of PD325901 and one hour later were evaluated in a 10 min session. For both groups, the percentage of
time spent exploring the novel object was significantly higher than the percentage of time spent on the familiar
object (Paired-samples t-test, PD325901: t9 = 3.286, p<0.01; VEH: t8 = 15.233, p<0.0001). Nevertheless, the time
spent exploring the familiar object was significantly lower in the vehicle treated group than in the PD325901
treated group (Independent-samples t-test: t17 = 7.896, p<0.0001), indicating that PD325901 injection partially
perturbed the recognition of the familiar object. (I) Total time of object exploration was equivalent between
groups, meaning that PD325901 injection had no influence on the motivational state of the animals (Independent-
samples t-test: t17 = 0.857, p=0.403). (J) The D.I. of the PD325901-injected group was lower, by 23.24%, indicating
that 25 mg/kg of PD325901 significantly interfered with the retrieval of recognition memory (PD325901: 0.087 ±
0.027, VEH: 0.376 ± 0.025; Independent-samples t-test: t17 = �7.898, p<0.0001), although still above chance level
(One-sample t-test, PD325901: t9 = 3.283, p=0.009; VEH: t8 = 15.264, p<0.0001). (K) Analysis of the R.I. showed

 ERK activation in response to cocaine and, most importantly, capable of attenuating both Pavlovian
and operant responding in response to cocaine in mice.
PD325901 is a highly selective allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor that does not compete with ATP or
ERK1/2. It is a particularly appealing drug since it shows a high potency with a low IC50 in vivo.
Moreover, compared to its predecessor CI-1040, PD325901 exhibits a greater solubility, leading to
improved bioavailability and metabolic stability (Uehling and Harris, 2015; Wu and Park, 2015).
Consistent with this, PD325901 has demonstrated potent anticancer activity both in vitro, by inhibit-
ing tumour cell proliferation, and in vivo, by suppressing tumour growth in a broad spectrum of
xenograft models (Solit et al., 2006). Based on these promising preclinical studies, PD325901 has
been subsequently advanced into clinical trials. The effectiveness of PD325901 in patients has been
evaluated in a Phase I/II trial for the treatment of colon cancer, breast cancer and melanoma
(NCT00147550, Pfizer), in a Phase II study for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
(NCT00174369, Pfizer), and in another Phase II study in one previously-treated patient with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02297802, Sharp Healthcare). In addition, several combina-
tion therapies using PD325901 have been evaluated in order to expand its clinical application
(NCT01347866,

NCT02022982,

Institute;
Phase
I/II,
NCT02039336, The Netherlands Cancer Institute; Phase I, NCT02510001, University of Oxford;
NCT020096471, University of Alabama at Birmingham).
Notably, the first completed analysis of a phase II study of PD325901 for cancer therapy showed
some neurological adverse effects, including most commonly visual disturbances, but also dizziness,
hallucinations, and balance and gait disorders (Haura et al., 2010; LoRusso et al., 2010). Here, we
speculate that these early clinical observations indirectly confirm the ability of PD325901 to pene-
trate the human brain and exert its anti Ras-ERK activity. Although the toxicity issue is of unquestion-
able relevance, the protocol used in clinical trials for cancer therapy consisted of repeated and
intermittent oral administrations of the compound. In contrast, with our protocol we demonstrated a
remarkable inhibitory effect on both CPP and SA with a single administration, suggesting that such a
treatment in humans should not cause major complications. Importantly, the ability of a single dose
of PD325901 to accelerate the extinction of cocaine self-administration is obviously a key finding,
which for the first time supports the idea that a systemic Ras-ERK inhibition may lead to a significant
reduction in behaviours mediated by cocaine-cue associations. Obviously, it remains to be seen
whether such an effect could be replicated in patients and whether a single dose/behavioural treat-
ment would be sufficient to block relapse. One important concern related to future clinical develop-
ments is the potential side effects of PD325901 on memory mechanisms. Indeed, our own data
indicate that this drug may cause memory dysfunctions both during the acquisition and the retrieval
phases, but at doses that are significantly higher (25 mg/kg) than those used in cancer therapy and
in our cocaine experiments. Importantly, the fact that we propose here to administer only one or
a few doses of PD325901 at 10 mg/kg to treat cocaine addiction should be reassuring since such
protocols are unlikely to cause permanent memory impairments. In addition, we would like to note
that in our cocaine behavioural paradigms we used a dose which is far above the minimal (2.5 mg/
kg) effective one in blocking ERK phosphorylation and thus it is likely that doses lower than 10 mg/
kg could still be of therapeutic value.
A comparison with the only blood-brain barrier penetrating Ras-ERK inhibitor previously available,
SL327, indicates that PD325901 may offer some significant advantages. It is a classical MEK inhibitor,
and in that sense its action may be qualitatively similar to SL327, nevertheless it is much more potent
(almost three orders of magnitude). Furthermore, in contrast to PD325901, SL327 at the dose neces-
sary to completely block ERK phosphorylation (50 mg/kg) and commonly used in several behavioural
paradigms, showed significant detrimental consequences on locomotion, suggesting potential off

 target effects that should be further evaluated (Valjent et al., 2006b). Most importantly, PD325901
has already been demonstrated to manifest an acceptable toxicity in humans and thus could be rap-
idly repositioned for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
Similarly, the two RB1 and RB3 peptides interfered with the expression of cocaine-induced place
preference, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that these peptides are also capable of
inhibiting cocaine-mediated responses. Considering that several other cell-penetrating peptides are

(A) Animals were placed in a lighted arena and when they entered the dark compartment, they received an
aversive footshock (0.2 mA � 2”). Immediately after training, animals received an injection of PD325901 (10 or 25
mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle and were then evaluated for their memory on the subsequent day. (B) 10 mg/kg of
PD325901 spared the consolidation of the inhibitory-avoidance learning. Before PD325901 treatment all groups
showed equivalent latency to enter the dark compartment (One-way ANOVA, F2,43 = 0.557, p=0.577). PD325901
treatment given immediately after training had a significant effect on memory consolidation on day 2 (Two-way
ANOVA, treatment effect F2,43 = 37.848, p<0.0001). In particular, only the higher dose of PD325901 disrupted
consolidation when compared with VEH (Bonferroni’s post-hoc, PD325901 10 mg vs VEH: p=0.667; PD325901 25
mg vs VEH: p<0.0001) and a dose-dependent effect was found for PD325901 (Bonferroni’s post-hoc, PD325901 25
mg vs PD325901 10 mg: p<0.0001). Mice treated with 10 mg/kg of PD325901 and vehicle treated mice both
showed significantly increased latency 24 hr after training (Paired-samples t-test, PD325901 10 mg: t15 = �9.695,
p<0.0001; VEH: t15 = �11.129, p<0.0001), whereas mice injected with 25 mg/kg of PD325901 did not (Paired-

a dark compartment. When they entered the dark compartment, they received an aversive footshock (0.2 mA �
2”). On the subsequent day, one hour before the test session mice received an injection of PD325901 (10 or 25
mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle and were then evaluated for their inhibitory-avoidance learning. (D) 10 mg/kg of PD325901
spared the retrieval of the inhibitory-avoidance learning. Before PD325901 treatment all groups showed equivalent
latency to enter the dark compartment (One-way ANOVA, F2,32 = 0.092, p=0.913). On day 2, PD325901 treatment
altered the memory performance (Two-way ANOVA, treatment effect: F2,32 = 9.536, p<0.001). Specifically, only 25
mg/kg of PD325901 significantly compromised memory retrieval when compared with VEH (Bonferroni’s post-hoc,
PD325901 10 mg vs VEH: p=1.000; PD325901 25 mg vs VEH: p<0.001) and a dose-dependent effect was found for
PD325901 (Bonferroni’s post-hoc, PD325901 25 mg vs PD325901 10 mg: p<0.01). Mice treated with 10 mg/kg of

 already in clinical trials for various conditions, including neurological disorders, our peptides may be
in the near future further validated for clinical purposes (Mehta et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2012;
Warso et al., 2013). Also, in comparison to SL327, these peptides may offer some advantages.
While RB1 and RB3 show an IC50 toward ERK comparable to SL327, they posses an excellent water
solubility (SL327 is dissolved in organic solvents) and potentially lower toxicity. In addition, RB1 and
RB3 act on different Ras-ERK components (ERK1/2- and Ras- interacting partners, respectively) than
SL327, thus expanding the portfolio of potential targets.
Finally, beyond the field of drug addiction, these drugs may also be relevant for the experimental
treatment of other brain disorders, most notably a class of neurodevelopmental disorders collec-
tively named RASopathies, which are characterised by activating mutations in the Ras pathway.
Indeed, it has been shown that the use of Ras-ERK inhibitors can reverse some of the associated
symptoms in animal models (Lee et al., 2014; Papale et al., 2016). Thus, further development of
the tools outlined here may not only facilitate the investigation of the neurobiological bases of drug
addiction, but may possibly lead to the development of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of
other neuropsychiatric conditions.
Materials and methods
Animals and drugs
Male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River) were single-housed in a temperature-controlled (21˚C) environ-
ment maintained on a 12-hr light-dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.). Food and water were available ad
libitum. All behavioural testing was conducted during the light phase between 08.00 hr and 17.00
hr. All procedures involving animals were conducted according to the European Community guide-
lines (Directive 2010/63/EU) and previously approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee
(IACUC)

Every attempt was made to ensure minimum discomfort to the animals at all times.
RB1 was designed around the 59–73 portion, the KIM sequence (Liu et al., 2006), of the ERK1/2
specific phosphatase MKP3. RB3 was designed, using the MOE software package, (Molecular Oper-
ating Environment, version 10.10, Chemical Computing group, Montreal Canada, http://www.chem-
comp.com) by aligning and superposing the CDC25 domain of Ras-GRF1 (Freedman et al., 2006)
the published crystal structure of a ternary Ras:SOS:Ras*GDP complex (Sondermann et al., 2004)
using the default settings. The interacting surface between the two proteins was then visually ana-
lysed and the portion of the CDC25 domain between residues 1173 to 1203 was selected for the
preparation of the final peptide.
RB1 (MGRKKRRQRRRPPQAPGIMLRRLQKGNLPVSRYPYDVPD), SCR RB1 (MGRKKRRQRRRPPQA
LSLKRLRSRGMNRTSATQSRYPYD), RB3 (GRKKRRQRRRPPCVPYLGMYLTDLVFIEEGTPNYTEDGLVN)
and SCR RB3 (GRKKRRQRRRPPCFEVYPDSGDYTYEGELNGTLMVVPTN) were custom synthesised by
GENECUST EUROPE (Luxembourg).
For all in vitro and in vivo experiments, batches of 200 mg, highly purified by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (� 95% ) with C-terminal aminoacid (last) in D form and acetylated
N-Terminal (first) aminoacid were used. For in vivo experiments the peptides were dissolved in PBS
1X and injected 20 mg/kg 1 hr before the cocaine injection.
Dabrafenib, Trametinib, Selumetinib (Selleck Chemicals) and PD325901 (Sigma Aldrich, UK) were
dissolved in DMSO (20% final solution) and injected at the doses indicated. Cocaine hydrochloride
(Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was dissolved in physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) for intravenous (i.v.) infu-
sion of 0.50 mg/kg in a 14 ml infusion or injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 20 or 25 mg/kg.
L-Glutamic acid (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile water.
Ex vivo system in acute brain slices
Adult mice were decapitated after cervical dislocation and brain slices were freshly prepared accord-
ing to the protocol described in (Marti et al., 2012; Orellana et al., 2012). The brains were rapidly
removed from the skull and put on a cool glass plate filled with ice-cold sucrose-based dissecting
solution (87 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 75 mM sucrose, 25 mM NaHCO3,
10 mM D -glucose, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 2 mM kynurenic acid), oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, and

 subsequently mounted on the vibratome stage (Vibratome, VT1000S-Leica Microsystems). 200 �m-
thick slices were cut and transferred into the brain slice chamber (Brain slice chamber-BSC1 - Scien-
tific System design Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and allowed to recover for 1 hr at 32˚C, with a
constant perfusion of carboxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) in the presence of different
doses of the cell penetrating peptides, PD325901 or their controls. 100 �M glutamate was applied
to stimulate brain slices into the chamber for 10 min. After a rapid fixation in 4% PFA for 15 min at
room temperature, slices were rinsed and cryoprotected overnight at 4˚C in sucrose solution (30%).
On the following day, slices were further cut into thinner slices of 18 �m using a cryostat (Leica
CM1850) and mounted onto SuperFrost Plus slides (Thermo Scientific), and stored at �20ºC until
processing for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.
In vivo administration of drugs
At the indicated times after drug treatments, animals were anaesthetised and transcardially perfused
with ice-cold buffered 4% PFA.
Brains were extracted, post-fixed overnight and transferred to 30% buffered sucrose for 24 hr.
Coronal sections were cut to a 35 mm thickness on a freezing microtome and stored in a cryoprotec-
tive solution at �20˚C until processing for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed following the protocol described in (Fasano et al., 2009;
Bido et al., 2015). 1 hr after blocking in 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 solution, sli-
ces were incubated overnight at 4˚C with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) (1:200,
Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 4370L, RRID: AB_2297462). Sections were then incubated with bioti-
nylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories Cat# BA-1000, RRID: AB_2313606) for 2 hr.
Detection of the bound antibodies was carried out using a standard peroxidase-based method
(ABC-kit, Vectastain, Vector Labs), followed by a DAB and H2O2 solution. Images were acquired
from the dorsal striatum (for ex-vivo experiments) and ventral striatum (for in vivo experiments) using
a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope under a 20X objective.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed as described in (Marti et al., 2012; Orellana et al., 2012;
Bido et al., 2015). 1 hr after blocking in 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 solution, sli-
ces were incubated overnight at 4˚C with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-phospho-S6

546 conjugated anti-mouse (1:200, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-11003, RRID: AB_2534071) and
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A-11008, RRID: AB_
143165). Single and double-labelled images (1024 � 1024 �m) were obtained at 40X magnification
from striatum using a laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica SP2) equipped with the correspond-
ing lasers and appropriate filters sets to avoid the cross-talk between the fluorochromes.
Image quantification and statistics
Neuronal quantification was performed using ImageJ software.
For ex-vivo immunohistochemistry experiments, the number of phospho-ERK positive cells was
counted in 3 consecutive sections for each treatment in 2 fields per section. The level of activation
was expressed as arbitrary units (AU). AU=% p-cells in glu+ scramble treated samples -% p-cells in
glu- scramble treated samples.
The IC50 was calculated for the specific response using GraphPad Prism software.
For in vivo immunohistochemistry experiments, the number of phospho-ERK positive cells was
counted in 2 consecutive rostral sections per mouse in 2 fields per section.
In ex-vivo immunofluorescence experiments, the number of phospho-S6 or phospho-Ac-H3 posi-
tive cells among NeuN positive cells was counted in 3 consecutive sections for each treatment in 3
fields per section. The level of activation and the IC50 were calculated as described above.

 In in-vivo immunofluorescence experiments, the number of phospho-S6 or -Ac-H3 immunoreac-
tive neurons among NeuN positive neurons was counted in 2 consecutive rostral sections per mouse
in 4 fields per section.
Comparisons between groups of different treatments were performed using two-way ANOVA
and post-hoc analysis with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test, in GraphPad Prism 5 software.
Cocaine conditioning place preference (CPP)
Conditioned place preference testing was performed as previously described (Fasano et al., 2009).
Briefly, CPP was performed in a three-chamber apparatus containing two large compartments with
distinct patterns on the floors and walls, separated by a central neutral area. During the pre-condi-
tioning phase, mice were allowed 18 min free access to the apparatus. Only mice that spent less
than 75% of their time in any one compartment were included in the study. During the conditioning
phase (days 2–7), mice were confined to one compartment for 20 min after an injection of cocaine
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 2, 4, and 6, or to the other compartment after a saline injection on days 3,
5, and 7. Saline-treated mice received six pairings of saline. One hour prior to the conditioning test
(day 8, test 1), mice were treated with vehicle or inhibitors (PD325901, 10 mg/kg, RB1/RB3 mix, 20
mg/kg or Trametinib, 10 mg/kg) and then allowed 18 min free access to the apparatus. A place pref-
erence score was calculated for each mouse as the difference between pre-conditioning and post-
conditioning time spent in the drug-paired compartment. After 2 weeks (day 22, test 2), mice were
retested in the CPP apparatus in a drug-free state. The day following test 2 (day 23), mice under-
went one conditioning session (20 min) in the CPP apparatus immediately after cocaine or saline
injection (20 mg/kg, i.p.). CPP was tested the following day (day 24, test 3).
Novel object recognition (NOR)
The novel object recognition (NOR) test was performed in a square arena of 40 � 40 cm. On day 1,
mice were first allowed to habituate to the testing arena in a 5 min session. Thigmotaxis (i.e. the per-
centage of time spent near the walls) was measured as an index of anxiety by analysing the visual
recording made with a video camera. On day 2, animals underwent the training phase (10 min), in
which two identical objects were introduced into the arena before allowing the mouse to explore.
The amount of time that the rodents spent exploring each object was scored. Finally, on day 3, mice
were tested for their 24 hr memory (10 min). The discrimination index (DI), defined as the difference
between the exploration time for the novel object and the one for the familiar object, divided by
total exploration time, was calculated. The recognition index (RI) measures the ability of an animal to
recognise a same object at different time points and it is based on the fact that if an animal main-
tains the memory of the previously encountered familiar object, its percentage of exploration for
that object will decrease when the animal is exposed to the same object for a second time. RI was
computed as follows: [(percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the train-
ing) – (percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the test)] / percentage of
exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the training (d’Isa et al., 2014).
Two doses of PD325901, 10 and 25 mg/kg were given either at day 2 to interfere with the acqui-
sition process of recognition memory or at day 3 to perturb the retrieval of that memory.
The sessions were recorded with the video tracking software SMART (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain).
Inhibitory avoidance
The apparatus was divided into two compartments: a larger one made of white Plexiglas, kept
strongly illuminated and fitted at one end with a guillotine door, and a smaller one made of black
Plexiglas (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). A floor grid placed in the dark chamber received electrical cur-
rent. On the training day each mouse was placed in the lit compartment, facing away from the dark
compartment. Mice show a natural tendency to leave a well-lit chamber for a darkened one, and
they do so after a short latency. When a mouse entered the dark compartment with all four paws 1
footshock (0.2 mA x 2”) was delivered. The time spent in the lit side (step-through latency) 24 hr
later is the measure of ‘inhibitory avoidance’. A maximum step-through latency of 360 s was allowed
in the test session (Brambilla et al., 1997).
Two doses of PD325901, 10 and 25 mg/kg, were given either at day 1 after training to interfere
with the consolidation of fear memory or at day 2 to perturb the retrieval of that memory.

 Locomotor activity
Horizontal activity was recorded in locomotor activity boxes equipped with photocell beams (Ugo
Basile, Comerio, Italy) during a single session starting 30 min after PD325901 injection (10 mg/kg, i.
p.) and recorded every 5 min for a total of 6 trials. At the end of this session mice received a cocaine
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) challenge and the effect of PD325901 pre-treatment on the hyper-locomotion
induced by cocaine was evaluated for the subsequent 30 min (Fasano et al., 2009).
Cocaine self-administration (SA)
SA was assessed in 12 operant chambers (Med Associates, USA) housed in light- and sound-attenu-
ating cubicles. Each chamber (24.1 � 20.3 � 18.4 cm) is equipped with two levers and a drug deliv-
ery system connected via infusion pump (PHM-100, Med-Associates, USA) located outside the
cubicle. Operant chambers were controlled using Med-PC IV (Med Associates, USA) software. Mice
were implanted with an indwelling intravenous catheter (made in-house) into the jugular vein. Cathe-
ter patency was maintained with 0.15 ml heparanised saline (100 i.u./ml) containing Baytril (0.7 mg/
ml) administered daily throughout the experiment. After 3-day recovery, self-administration in mice
began.
For all behavioural experiments, statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (Stat-
Soft, USA). Significance was set at p<0.05.
