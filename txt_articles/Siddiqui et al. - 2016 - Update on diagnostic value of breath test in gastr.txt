 Abstract
In the field of gastroenterology, breath tests (BTs) are 
used intermittently as diagnostic tools that allow indirect, 
non-invasive and relatively less cumbersome evaluation 
of several disorders by simply quantifying the appearance 
in exhaled breath of a metabolite of a specific substrate 
administered. The aim of this review is to have an insight 
into the principles, methods of analysis and performance 
parameters of various hydrogen, methane and carbon 
BTs which are available for diagnosing gastrointestinal 
disorders such as Helicobacter pylori infection, small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and carbohydrate mala-
bsorption. Evaluation of gastric emptying is routinely 
performed by scintigraphy which is however, difficult 
to perform and not suitable for children and pregnant 
women, this review has abridged the 13C-octanoic acid 
test in comparison to scintigraphy and has emphasized on 
its working protocol and challenges. A new development 
such as electronic nose test is also highlighted. Moreover 
we have also explored the limitations and constraints 
restraining the wide use of these BT. We conclude that 
breath testing has an enormous potential to be used 
as a diagnostic modality. In addition it offers distinct 
advantages over the traditional invasive methods com-
monly employed.

INTRODUCTION
Composition of human breath is a blend of various inert 
gases as well as nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide 
(CO2). In addition, researchers have also revealed several 
other trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath 
with concentrations varying from parts per million (ppm) 
to trillion (ppt)
[1,2]. Commonly present VOCs in breath 
include, ethane, hydrogen, and methanol which are 
harvests of primary metabolic processes in the body and 
can play a pivotal role for various medical diagnostics
[3].
In the current era of advanced human diagnostics, 
breath analysis is widely gaining attentiveness of cli­
nicians and laboratories as a noninvasive diagnostic 
option. Gas analysis sensors and sensor systems are now 
available, as a product of rapid development in micro 
and nanotechnology
. These tools are being progressively 
amended for laboratory testing and the more recent 
discovery of new gas volatile compound biomarkers have 
opened new horizons for researchers
[4].
Speaking from an analytical point of view composition 
of breath is less complex than serum and urine thus 
making it a preferable matrix for a comprehensive an­
alysis. Furthermore, these procedures can be easily 
repeated if the need arises for a recheck.
To identify the disease processes occurring in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract the use of endoscopy and 
colonoscopy are commonly on the rise, however these 
modalities are not only invasive and costly but the 
patients are also more at risk of suffering from com­
plications with significant morbidities. Breath testing 
provides a solution to some of the practical issues faced 
in GI testing, although suffers from its own limitations. 
METHODOLOGY
We selected articles from the PubMed database and 
Google scholar by using the search terms “breath test” 
(BT), “Helicobacter pylori” (H. pylori), “carbon breath 
test” and “urea breath test” (UBT). Inclusion criteria were 
articles published in English, in peer­reviewed journals, 
between 1966 and 2011. The articles were further 
filtered in a team meeting, keeping in view the ideology 
behind this mini review, i.e., the current practices, the 
new advancements and factors limiting the wide use of 
BTs. 
BASIC MECHANISM OF BT
BTs are based on the consumption of numerous sub­
strates that undergo processing at different points in the 
GI tract. The concept revolves around the fact that the 
metabolized substrate leads to the production of gases 
(e.g., CO2, H2) that become part of the blood stream, 
are expelled and measured in exhaled breath via the 
different analyzers available. 
Moreover hydrogen and carbon BTs are the most 
widely known and practice, methane BT are also gaining 
popularity based on the fact that its production is 
prevalent in 36%­50% of healthy subjects in comparison 
with hydrogen which is more pervasive. Literature review 
has shown that a noticeable amount of subjects do not 
produce hydrogen in spite of having small intestinal 
bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) because of the presence of 
the bacterium Methanobrevibacter smithii (M. smithii) 
which converts hydrogen into methane. 
There is a significant rise in the utility of breath testing 
since their development considering the fact that they 
are non­invasive and relatively simpler and safer tools 
for the diagnosis of various disorders of GI tract such 
as H. pylori infection, gastric motility, SIBO, and sugar 
malabsorption. Different available BT are summarized in 
(T
able 1).
HYDROGEN BT
Principle
Hydrogen is a product of the intestinal bacterial over­
growth when dietary carbohydrates encounter malab­
sorption in the small intestine. Hydrogen producing 
bacteria chiefly reside in the colon. A quantifiable amount 
of this colonic hydrogen is absorbed into the bloodstream 
and is exhaled and eventually detected by breath

 testing
[5] (Figure 1).
Analysis
Hydrogen concentrations are commonly measured using 
gas chromatography or electrochemical cells. With the 
rising entity of point of care testing (POCT), portable even 
pocket sized breath analyzers are now being developed 
which enable a reliable direct measurement in practice or 
at bedside
[6].
Points to consider
Hydrogen BTs lack standardization in laboratories world­
wide which renders the comparison of test results 
difficult. The dosage of the carbohydrate, the volume 
of the dissolving fluid, the duration of the test period, 
the interval of breath samples collection as well as the 
optimal cut­offs used for reporting differs among test 
providers.
Practical application of hydrogen breath testing
Hydrogen breath testing for SIBO: Glucose is 
a preferred substrate to detect SIBO as it follows a 
prompt reabsorption in the proximal small bowel. The 
recommended cut­off point diverges between 10 and 20 
ppm. In the presence of bacteria in the small intestine, 
glucose get fermented and liberated in the high quantity 
and can be detected easily in breath. 
Protocol: Subjects are made to undergo an overnight 
fast. Prerequisites of the test include teeth brushing and 
use of disinfecting mouth wash and gargles, keeping 
in mind the fact that oral bacteria can lead to false 
increment on hydrogen peaks. With the commencement 
of breath hydrogen sampling basal breath hydrogen is 
recorded. In circumstance when basal values of breath 
hydrogen are recorded in excess of 16 ppm, substrates 
are not given and test is abandoned as according to few 
researchers high basal hydrogen values are diagnostic of 
SIBO but this finding remains contentious. A diagnosis 
of SIBO is made on glucose hydrogen BT if there is an 
upsurge in breath hydrogen by 12 ppm above the base 
line levels. Reportedly sensitivity and specificity of this 
test are 62% and 83% respectively, when compared 
with culture from jejunal aspirate
[7]. 
Some studies have also suggested lactulose BT for 
making a diagnosis of SIBO but it was found to be less 
specific compared to the glucose BT
[8].
Hydrogen breath testing for carbohydrate malabsorption
Lactose hydrogen BT: Four variants of lactase defi­
ciency have been identified, i.e., primary, secondary, 
developmental and congenital lactase deficiency
. Statistics 
suggest that primary lactase deficiency predominates 
affecting more than 50% of the world’s population
[9,10]. 
Ethnicity and amount of dairy consumption are the 
contributing factors, whereas risk is reportedly higher 
in Asian and American Indian people compared to 
Europeans
[11,12]. 
Protocol: Baseline hydrogen measurements are taken 
in expired breath. Fasting subjects are given 50 g lactose 
orally mixed with water
. Further samples to detect 
the hydrogen quantity are taken at 15-30 min time 
intervals continued over a period of 4 h. Detection of 
more than 10­20 ppm over the baseline hydrogen value 
(detected in at least 2 breath samples) indicates lactose 
malabsorption.
Improvement is sensitivity have been reported by 
studies if the test is extended for a period of 6 h with 
hourly sample collection from 3 to 6 h. However
, this is 
not yet extensively applied as standard clinical practice 
protocol
[13].
False­positive results are seen with recent smoking 
or inadequate pre-test fasting (high carbohydrate load). 
False­negative results may arise following recent use 
of antibiotics, in patients with lung disorders, or in 
approximately 10% to 20% of patients who are hydr­
ogen non­producers.

Siddiqui I et al. Update on diagnostic value of BT in GI and liver diseases
 Other tests for carbohydrate metabolism use fructose 
or saccharose as substrate but are not popular for clinical 
use
[14­16]. 
METHANE (CH4) BT
The addition of methane to hydrogen measurement 
has improved the diagnostic accuracy of these BTs by 
capturing the 20% to 30% of the general population 
which produces methane as a main byproduct of carbo­
hydrate fermentation
[17]. Furthermore, Methane testing 
has also potentially contributed towards an increment in 
sensitivity of lactose BT
[18]. 
Methane production is prevalent in 36%­50% of 
healthy subjects in comparison with hydrogen which is 
more pervasive
[19­21]. M. smithii are the chief producers of 
methane in humans. This process takes place chiefly in 
the left colon. 
Methane production is more disease specific as 
suggested by different studies, for example: Methane 
excretion is not found in diarrheal states such as 
ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease and on the other 
hand it is more frequently observed in diverticulosis
[22] 
and encoparesis
[23] related with constipation.
Furthermore literature review revealed significant 
association between delayed gut motility and CH4. 
Reportedly mean of transit time in CH4 producers was 
84.6 h and in non­producers was 48.6 h
[24].
Analysis
More or less follows the same protocol as hydrogen 
breath testing. The only difference is established while 
sample analysis is done for methane. Gas chrom­
atography equipped with range of detectors based on 
flame ionization
[25­28], thermal conductivity
[29], pulsed 
helium discharge ionization
[30] and mass spectrometry
[31] 
are available for methane analysis. Furthermore, sele­
ctive ion flow transfer mass spectrometry (SIFT­MS) 
methane analysis is also practiced which is relatively a 
more convenient technique
[32].
CARBON BTS
Carbon exists in various isotopic forms; the most well­
known forms being the 12C, 13C and 14C isotopes. 14C 
is a radioactive isotope and is instable. It has a half time 
decay of 5730 years, whereas only 12C and 13C are 
stable forms.
Principle
This technique is based on the use of either the radio-
active isotope of carbon, 14C or the safer and preferable 
nonradioactive 13C isotope
[33,34]. 13C differs by only one 
neutron from the naturally more common 12C­atom. 
The detection of 13C­carbondioxide (13CO2) in breath 
is the time limiting step from ingestion of the substrate 
to its complete metabolism, till the final outbreath of the 
end product 13CO2. 
Analysis
Breath samples are collected at intervals ranging from 
4 to 24 h after ingestion of the substrate
[31,35]. Most 
centers utilize the high resolution isotope ratio mass 
spectrometers (IRMS) for the differentiation of 13CO2 
and 12CO2. The introduction of non­dispersive isotope 
selective infrared spectrometers (NDIRS) has simplified 
the use of 13C­BTs and have paved the way for analysis 
in small centers as well
[36­38].
Points to consider
This technique has got an edge in favor of non-hydrogen-
producers. Furthermore lesser quantity of substrate 
is required compared with other tests. However
, the 
costs of some substrates still limits the wide spread use. 
Endogenous CO2 production, which fluctuated extensively 
in the numerous diseases, has resulted in declining 
diagnostic accuracy
. 
Practical application of carbon breath testing 
UBT for H. pylori infection: A meta-analysis by Ferwana 
et al
[39] has reported pooled sensitivity and specificity of 
UBT to be 96% and 93% respectively. Similar results 
were also the outcome of a multicenter Japanese stu­
dy conducted in 2002, making UBT a reliable test for 
H. pylori infections
[40]. Study from developing world 
also suggest that UBT is a highly accurate and reliable 
diagnostic modality as reflected by another study form 
Egypt that revealed a sensitivity and specificity of UBT to 
be 98% and 89% respectively
[41].
Principle: Begins with the oral administration of 13C 
or 14C labeled urea. H. pylori produce the urea splitting 
enzyme Urease, which ultimately cleaves the labeled 
urea to ammonia and bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is the 
precursor of CO2 that is incorporated into breath (Figure 
2).
Owing to the radioactive hazard of 14C, here also 
13C UBT is the preferred method of detection. A large 
multicenter study evaluated the accuracy of 13C­UBT 
in children taking biopsy as gold standard and stated 
a sensitivity ranging from 96%­98% and specificity 
96%­99%
[42].
Analysis: The test underwent various reforms regarding 
substrate dose, fasting state, test meal and breath 
sample intervals
[43]. Commonly used protocol uses 75 
mg 13C­urea administered to fasting subjects mixed with 
200 mL citric acid solution. Breath samples are taken at 
baseline, followed by re­sampling at 20 or 30 min after 
ingestion of the substrate. A delta over baseline in breath 
13C­enrichment above 3.5%­5% is considered positive.
Beginning of the 21
th century has marked the adv­
ancement of UBT with the introduction of bench top 
analyzers based on the principle of molecular correlation 
spectrometry pooled with infrared spectrometer
[44,45]. 
Campuzano­Maya et al
[46] developed a simplified 13C-UBT 
protocol which when evaluated yielded an accuracy of 
259

Siddiqui I et al. Update on diagnostic value of BT in GI and liver diseases
 100% for the diagnosis of H. pylori. This version required 
only 50 mg 13C­urea, no prior test meal, and more 
importantly a single breath sample collected at 10 min
[46]. 
Points to consider: High cost of substrate is a drawback 
of this test. The use of bismuth­based preparations, 
drugs including proton pump inhibitors several antibiotics 
can effects the results of this test
[47]. Gargles or mouth 
wash are routinely advised before the commencement of 
the test as oral contamination could lead to false positive 
results. 
The 14C­UBT owing to its radioactivity potential 
has not been promoted for use in children and women 
of reproductive age group. However
, the amount of 
radioactivity delivered to the patient is low, arising the 
question of its prescription to the pediatric and pregnant 
population by some researchers
[48]. On the brighter side 
of the picture, the 13C­UBT can be safely used in these 
patient groups
[49]. A comparison of 13C and 14C UBT is 
summarized in (T
able 2).
13C-Octanoic acid BT for the evaluation of gastric 
emptying
The gold standard test to assess gastric emptying is 
Scintigraphy using radioactive tracers. The other alter­
native available is 13C­BT that uses the 13C­octanoate 
to label the solid components of test meals and the 
13C-acetate which is utilized to label fluids.
Principle: This test is established on the fact that time 
taken up by the transport of the tracer substance is 
considered the rate limiting state together with the 
ingested food from the stomach into the duodenum, 
while the remaining processes till the elimination of CO2 
follows at a constant rate
[50].
Protocol: Egg yolk is used as a test meal labeled with 
13C­octanoic acid. 13C­octanoic acid is absorbed upon its 
passage through the duodenum, and eventually oxidized 
by the liver to 13CO2. Gastric emptying of the egg yolk 
into the duodenum serves as a rate limiting step which 
in turn influences the detection of 13C in exhaled breath 
samples.
Most studies have validated 13C­octanoic acid test 
against scintigraphy and have found acceptable corr­
elation. However scintigraphy itself suffers from lack of 
standardization. Differences in test meals, position of the 
patient, rate, and extent of imaging are the factors that 
affect test results.
Choi et al
[51] in 1997 evaluated the performance 
of simultaneous OBT and scintigraphy in 15 healthy 
participants and revealed that these tests do not signi­
ficantly correlate with each other
. However acceptable 
reproducibility was obtained with a mean coefficient of 
variation of t1/2 of 20% between individuals and 12% 
within the same individual
[51]. They put forward that OBT 
is only a reliable tool for intra­individual comparisons. 
However in the coming years this study faced immense 
criticism and findings were not adopted
[52].
There is abundance of data that has compared 
breath testing with scintigraphy, however as magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is potentially the most 
valid method; stable isotope BT should preferably be 
compared with MRI. In respect to this a study by Haans 
et al
[53] evaluated MRI against breath testing for gastric 
emptying and revealed a strong correlation between the 
two techniques for liquid emptying compared for solid 
gastric emptying.
Advantages: Provides a better alternative test to 
scintigraphy as it is free from radioactive hazards, 
particularly in children, women in reproductive age group 
and subjects requiring repetitive testing. It overcomes 
certain limitations such as operator dependence and time 
constraint of ultrasonography
. Furthermore it’s less costly 
compared to magnetic resonance imaging.
Limitations of 13C-octanoic acid BT: There are 
certain limitations of 13C­octanoic acid breath test (OBT). 
Firstly it suffers from lack of standardization. Furthermore

 protocol followed at different centers has certain vari­
ations. Literature review further highlighted that there 
also exists a difference in gastric emptying time taken as 
part of the methodology
. Moreover collections of breath 
samples every fifteen minutes for four hours while the 
patients with minimal physical activities is difficult.
Methods of analysis: In most instances mass spectro­
photometry (MS) is the technique of choice for measuring 
sampled 13CO2. Potential hindrances associated with MS 
are high cost and large operating units. Based on the 
convenience of its application Non­dispersive infrared 
isotope spectrometry (NDIRS) is potential substitute of 
MS
[54].
13C­spirulina platensis (S. platensis) is also reported 
to be used as a marker of gastric emptying by some 
researchers
[54,55]. S. platensis belongs to the family of algae 
used as a food product in distinct locations worldwide 
including the United States. It’s a blend of protein, starch 
and lipids. Egg yolk is used as a test meal mixed with 
13C­labeled S. platensis. After undergoing the process 
of emptying in the stomach and finally absorption, 13C 
enriched CO2 is exhaled from the 13C­labeled S. platensis. 
This phenomenon is aimed at assessing the solid phase of 
gastric emptying.
Carbon BT to evaluate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
Amylase, Lipase and secretin pancreozymin tests are 
the more reliable used in evaluation of patients with 
pancreatic disorders. The other testing modalities that 
can be included in practice are.
13C-triglyceride BT: This test utilizes the substrate using 
Lipase activity. The thoroughly investigated triglyceride 
BT is the “mixed” triglyceride test using 1,3­distearyl, 
2­[13C­carboxyl] octanoyl glycerol; demonstrating a 
sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 81% respectively
[56].
Literature review recommends 200­300 mg of the 
mixed triglycerides is the predominantly used doses 
for adults (15 mg/kg body weight for children). Before 
administration of test meal breath samples are collected, 
followed by successive sampling at 30 min intervals for 5 
h
[57].
Other carbon BTs for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency 
are
13C­starch BT and 13C egg protein BT which are based 
on Amylase and proteases activity respectively
.
13C-BTs to evaluate hepatocellular function: 13C 
Aminopyrine BT for hepatocellular microsomal enzyme 
function: This test explores hepatic microsomal enzyme 
function. Literature review suggests a protocol that is 
based on the ingestion of 2 mg/kg aminopyrine with 
water
. The recovery of the tracer after 60 or 120 min can 
be used as a diagnostic marker
[58]. 
13C­methacetin BT for assessment of microsomal liver 
function: 13C­methacetin is a combination of a methyl 
group labeled with the non­radioactive isotope 13CN­
demethylase, which is cytochrome P450 dependent 
enzyme responsible for de­methylation of 13C­Methacetin 
after oral absorption. The magnitude of appearance of 
13C in breath analysis is correlated with the process of de­
methylation. This test has been reported to be a reliable 
marker for the differentiation between early cirrhotic (Child 
A) and noncirrhotic patients but its performance for the 
detection of liver fibrosis remains questionable
[59].
Carbon-breath tests to determine small intestine 
bacterial overgrowth 
13C D­xylose was suggested as a marker of SIBO in the 
1980s. Orally ingested D­xylose labeled with 13C, after 
modification by gut flora yields labeled CO2 measured in 
the breath
[35]. Reportedly D­xylose is a poor metabolic 
substrate for common coliform bacteria including Esch­
richia coli, enterococci, and clostridia, increasing the 
risk of false­negative results. Due to variation found in 
literature in sensitivities and specificities in comparison to 
hydrogen BT its use still remains controversial
[34]. 
Glycocholate BT which is considered the forerunner 
of BT
s for the evaluation of suspected SIBO used glyco­
cholic acid labeled with 14C
[60]. Owing to its inability to 
distinguish small bowel from colonic bacterial decon­
jugation and high risk of radiation hazard this test has 
been mostly out of practice
[61].
13C-BT assessing carbohydrate malabsorption
Though the substrates required for 13C-BTs are costly 
compared to the hydrogen BT
, but doses required are 
much less and the problem of non­hydrogen producers 
does not exist.
Specific intestinal enzyme activities can be tested 
using the appropriate 13C­substrate.

LIMITATIONS OF BREATH TESTING
Though breath testing provides a near perfect alter­
native, it writhes from its own limitations. The lack of 
standardization of various analytical methodologies 
adopted by laboratories worldwide is a major issue 
reflected in literature search when it comes to breath 
testing. Similarly there is extensive variation in results 
and cut offs reported.
When it comes to the question of availability of 
resources, instruments for breath analysis are expensive 
and comprehensive operator training is an important 
requirement.
Even the most thoroughly proven 13C UBT has 
certain limitations. Especially in a resource limited areas, 
the availability of mass spectrometry based analyzers 
to evaluate the breath samples and computing a ratio 
of 12C to 13C are major hindrances as these instruments 
are quite expensive
[64]. In most cases when 13C UBT is 
undertaken, samples are sent to a central processing 
laboratory for analysis which further adds to the test cost 
and increases the timeline for rapid delivery of results. 
Mukhopadhyay
[3] reported that lack of proven asso­
ciations between the various elements detected in 
breath and disease the testing is aimed at. As in certain 
instances the analyte detected in breath is exhaled in 
response to various other metabolic processes rather 
than the disease for which the test is being conducted
[3].
Various available BTs which are in use in clinical 
practice with their reported sensitivities and specificities 
are listed in (T
able 3).
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
Contemporary bench top analyzers are being quickly 
replaced by POCT systems. One such development in the 
breath testing technology is the introduction of electronic 
nose (E­nose) test
[4]. These instruments are designed 
on a highly specific sensor technology based on diverse 
micro sensor arrays. Each sensor is aimed at detecting a 
specific chemical exhaled in breath. 
Principle
A specific pattern of response in recorded on to the 
sensor array when odor molecules from a breath sample 
are passed through. This signal yield is then sorted 
out utilizing the power of artificial neural networks to 
generate a specific output pattern, aimed at a particular 
diagnosis.
Though various researchers have studies the use 
of E­nose test and have suggested its role as a highly 
efficient diagnostic technique, further studies and vali-
dation studies concerning this entity are still required.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that BTs are useful modalities which are 
currently underutilized. With the advancement of new 
diagnostic tools especially desktop equipment for gas 
analysis, use of BTs is going to rise in near future. 
What is the current knowledge?
The most frequently utilized BTs in GI disorders 
worldwide are UBT and Hydrogen BT
. Breath testing 
remains underutilized due to the widespread belief that 
these test requires expensive instrumentation involving 
a complex analytic process and highly skilled operators. 
There is a perception that though these tests are less 
invasive, they possess radioactive hazards. In cases 
when samples are sent to reference labs for analysis it 
leads to elongation of the turnaround time of results.
What is new in this review?
13C carbon test are highlighted in this review, mostly 
based on mass spectrometry. Such compounds are 
safe because they are non-radioactive. Advent of Bench 
top analyzers and point of care testing will further 
pave the way for utilization of breath testing, leading 
to rapid production of results. Future development is 
aimed at development of specific sensor based hand

Siddiqui I et al. Update on diagnostic value of BT in GI and liver diseases
 held analyzers like the E­nose tests. Thus to conclude 
these diagnostic modality can be effectively used as 
it is relatively safer and noninvasive compared to the 
contemporary tests in use and tests can be easily re­
peated if need arises.
