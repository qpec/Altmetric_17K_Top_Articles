IMPORTANCE The long-term prophylactic effects of acupuncture for migraine are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the long-term effects of true acupuncture compared with sham
acupuncture and being placed in a waiting-list control group for migraine prophylaxis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a 24-week randomized clinical trial (4 weeks of
treatment followed by 20 weeks of follow-up). Participants were randomly assigned to true
acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or a waiting-list control group. The trial was conducted from
October 2012 to September 2014 in outpatient settings at 3 clinical sites in China. A total of
249 participants 18 to 65 years old with migraine without aura based on the criteria of the
International Headache Society, with migraine occurring 2 to 8 times per month.
INTERVENTIONS Participants in the true acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups received
treatment 5 days per week for 4 weeks for a total of 20 sessions. Participants in the
waiting-list group did not receive acupuncture but were informed that 20 sessions of
acupuncture would be provided free of charge at the end of the trial.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants used diaries to record migraine attacks. The
primary outcome was the change in the frequency of migraine attacks from baseline to week
16. Secondary outcome measures included the migraine days, average headache severity, and
medication intake every 4 weeks within 24 weeks.
RESULTS A total of 249 participants 18 to 65 years old were enrolled, and 245 were included
in the intention-to-treat analyses. One hundred eighty-nine (77.1%) were women. Baseline
characteristics were comparable across the 3 groups. The mean (SD) change in frequency of
migraine attacks differed significantly among the 3 groups at 16 weeks after randomization
(P < .001); the mean (SD) frequency of attacks decreased in the true acupuncture group by
3.2 (2.1), in the sham acupuncture group by 2.1 (2.5), and the waiting-list group by 1.4 (2.5);
a greater reduction was observed in the true acupuncture than in the sham acupuncture
group (difference of 1.1 attacks; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9; P = .002) and in the true acupuncture vs
waiting-list group (difference of 1.8 attacks; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5; P < .001). Sham acupuncture was
not statistically different from the waiting-list group (difference of 0.7 attacks; 95% CI,
−0.1 to 1.4; P = .07).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with migraine without aura, true
acupuncture may be associated with long-term reduction in migraine recurrence compared
with sham acupuncture or assigned to a waiting list.

A
mong neurological disorders, migraine is a leading
cause of disability and significantly contributes to in-
dividual and societal burdens owing to pain and envi-
ronmental sensitivities. The prevalence of migraine is 14.9%
in the United States,1 and 8.4% to 12.7% in Asia.2 Approxi-
mately 25% to 38% of migraineurs need preventive therapy,3,4
and pharmacotherapies, such as divalproex sodium, topira-
mate, metoprolol, and propranolol, are recommended for mi-
graine prevention. However, such treatments are often asso-
ciated with an increased risk of adverse events (AEs), including
weight gain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and gastrointestinal
intolerance.4,5 Excessive use of analgesics or specific antimi-
graine treatments could cause medication overuse–induced
headache and an increase in headache frequency.3,6 Because
of the limitations associated with these conventional treat-
ments, efforts have been made to identify effective, low-risk
interventions.
Acupuncture is widely used for managing migraine in
China and western countries, especially for drug-refractory
patients.7,8 The goals of acupuncture are usually 2-fold: relief
of pain during migraine (acute effect)9,10 and prevention of
future migraine attacks (long-term effect). Several trials with
a small sample size11-14 have shown that true acupuncture (TA)
may be more effective than sham acupuncture (SA) (simu-
lated, or needling at nonacupoint locations) in the reduction
of migraine intensity, frequency of migraine attacks, and num-
ber of migraine days; others,15-18 however, have reported no
differences. The inconsistency of these findings may result
from variations in the design characteristics (eg, length of
follow-up, interventions used) and study population.
The long-term effect of acupuncture is critical to success-
ful prophylaxis and reduction of migraine recurrence. One im-
portant unanswered question is whether TA is superior to SA
in preventing future migraine attacks. Therefore, we further
conducted a 24-week, multicenter, 3-arm, parallel random-
ized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the long-term effect of TA
vs SA or waiting list (WL) in migraineurs.
Methods
Study Population and Protocol
We recruited patients who had migraine without aura from
the outpatient unit of the Departments of Acupuncture and
Neurology in 3 clinical centers: the teaching hospital of
Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM),
the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of TCM, and
the Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.
Migraine without aura was diagnosed according to the clas-
sification criteria of the International Headache Society.19
Patients who complained of recurrent headaches lasting 4 to
72 hours, unilateral headaches with pulsating quality, and
also headaches aggravated by routine physical activity were
recruited for further evaluation. Patients were enrolled in
the study from October 2012 to September 2014. Patients
were not reimbursed, but did receive free treatment. The
protocol was approved by the local institutional ethics
review boards and was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the Chinese version of the Inter-
national Conference on Harmonization–Good Clinical Prac-
tice. The protocol was published previously and is available
in the Supplement.20
The inclusion criteria were as follows: men or women 18
to 65 years old with initial onset of migraines prior to the age
of 50 years; experience of acute migraine attacks at a fre-
quency of 2 to 8 times per month 3 months before inclusion;
experience of migraine attacks for at least 1 year; completion
of a baseline headache diary; and provision of written,
informed consent by the patients.
Patients with any of the following conditions were ex-
cluded: headache caused by organic disorders (eg, subarach-
noid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral embolism,
cerebral thrombosis, vascular malformation, arteritis, hyper-
tension, or arteriosclerosis); the presence of neurological
diseases, immunodeficiency, bleeding disorders, or allergies;
prophylactic headache treatment with drugs during the pre-
vious 3 months; pregnancy, lactation, or plans to become preg-
nant within 6 months; or involvement in other clinical trials.
Randomization and Blinding
A total of 249 eligible patients were recruited and were ran-
domly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive TA treatment or SA
treatment,ortobeplaceonaWL.Centralrandomization,using
an online or messaging system, was performed by the Bright-
echMagnsoftDataServices.Randomizationsequencewasgen-
erated in blocks of varying sizes and stratified by centers.
The participants in the TA group and SA group were
blinded, while those in the WL group were not. Acupunctur-
ists could not be blinded to the treatment assignments given
the nature of the interventions. Outcome assessors, data col-
lectors, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment allo-
cation.

patients were instructed to take ibuprofen (300-mg capsules
with sustained release) as a rescue medication, and the usage
of ibuprofen was documented in the headache diary.
Four acupoints were used per treatment. All patients
received acupuncture on 2 obligatory points, including GB20
and GB8. The 2 other points were chosen according to the
syndrome differentiation of meridians in the headache
region. The potential acupoints included SJ5, GB34, BL60,
SI3, LI4, ST44, LR3, and GB40.20 The use of additional acu-
points other than the prescribed ones was not allowed. We
chose the prescriptions as a result of a systematic review of
ancient and modern literature,22,23 consensus meetings with
clinical experts, and experience from our previous study.18
Sterile, single-use filiform acupuncture needles, each with a
length of 25 to 40 mm and a diameter of 0.25 mm, were
used in the treatment. Acupuncturists applied therapy uni-
laterally by alternatively using the left and right acupoints.
Each point was acupunctured to achieve the Deqi sensation
(a sensation of soreness, numbness, distention, or radiating
that indicates effective needling). The HANS acupoint nerve
stimulator (model LH 200A; Han Institute, TENS, Nanjing,
China) was used after needle insertion. The stimulation
frequency was 2/100 Hz (alternating every 3 seconds), and
the intensity varied from 0.1 to 1.0 mA until the patients felt
comfortable. This stimulation method was optimal for
obtaining an analgesic effect21 and was used successfully in
our previous study.18 In addition, more details of the proce-
dure have been published.20
The number of needles, electric stimulation, and dura-
tionoftreatmentintheSAgroupwereidenticalintheTAgroup
except that an attempt was not made to induce the Deqi sen-
sation. Four nonpoints were chosen according to our previ-
ous studies.20,24
Patients in the WL group did not receive acupuncture from
the beginning of the clinical trial but were informed that they
would be provided with 20 sessions of acupuncture treat-
ment for free after 24 weeks.
Measures
Data Collection
All patients were instructed to complete headache diary rec-
ords every 4 weeks after inclusion. The headache diary docu-
mented the time of migraine onset, duration, severity (evalu-
ated by the visual analog scale [VAS] score), and rescue
medication use. The frequency of migraine attacks over 24
weeks, migraine days, and the intensity of each attack were
calculated every 4 weeks. At each follow-up, 2 blinded evalu-
ators at each clinical center reminded patients by phone calls
or text messages to return the headache diary to the trial
offices via emails or to outpatient offices at follow-up visits.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the change in the frequency of mi-
graine attacks between baseline and 16 weeks after random-
ization. Secondary outcome measures included the number
of days with migraine (migraine days), average headache se-
verity, and medication intake every 4 weeks within 24 weeks.
In addition, migraine-specific quality-of-life questionnaire
(MSQ), and pain-related impairment of emotion (the Zung self-
rating anxiety scale [SAS] and Zung self-rating depression scale
[SDS]) were assessed at baseline and at the 4-week visit. Re-
searchers documented acupuncture treatment and reasons for
dropouts during the study period. Acupuncture-associated
AEs, including bleeding, subcutaneous hemorrhage, hema-
toma, fainting, serious pain, and local infection, were re-
corded at each treatment session.

Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis
We designed our trial to determine whether there was a differ-
ence among the TA group, the SA group, and the WL group in
termsofthefrequencyofmigraineattacks.Accordingtoourpre-
viousstudy,18 weanticipatedthatthefrequencyofmigraineat-
tacks over 16 weeks would be 2.7 in the TA group and 3.7 in the
SA group, considering a mean clinically relevant difference of
1.0 and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.81. With a 2-sided signifi-
cance level of 5% and power of 90%, 70 participants per group
would be required, as calculated by NQuery Advisor software
(version 4.0; Statistical Solutions). With an estimated loss-to-
follow-up rate of 15%, we planned to enroll 249 participants in
the 3 groups, with 83 participants in each group.
The baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes de-
scribed are based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population,
which included participants who had at least 1 treatment and
1 primary outcome measure (n = 245). Continuous variables
are presented as the mean (SD) with 95% CIs. Categorical vari-
ables are described as numbers and percentages. The missing
data of participants who dropped out were replaced by the last
observation carried forward method. The significance level
used for the statistical analysis with 2-tailed testing was 5%.
The analysis plan was determined before the study was
conducted. If the data were normally distributed, we planned
to use the analysis of covariance to detect differences among
the 3 groups; if not, we planned to use the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Secondary outcome measures were evaluated using the χ2 test
for categorical data, and analysis of variance or Kruskal-
Wallis tests were used for quantitative variables according to
the data distribution. If the global test among 3 arms was sig-
nificant, the least significant difference (LSD) test was used for
pairwise comparisons when the data were normally distrib-
uted; otherwise, the LSD was applied after rank-transforma-
tion when the variables showed nonnormality.
All data in this trial were commissioned to Brightech-
Magnsoft Data Services for analysis using SAS statistical soft-
ware (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Participants and Baseline Characteristics
After the screening of 662 patients, 249 participants 18 to 65
years old were randomized. One hundred eighty-nine (77.1%)
were women. A total of 245 patients (83 in the TA group, 80
in the SA group, and 82 in the WL group) were included in the
ITT population (Figure 1). Table 1 shows the patient charac-
teristics at baseline and acupuncture expectation before treat-
ment. They were comparable across the 3 groups. Six pa-
tients (2.4%) were unable to undergo follow-up (2 in the TA
group, 3 in the SA group, and 1 in the WL group). During the
treatment period, the mean number of treatments was 19.31
in the TA group and 19.23 in the SA group.
Primary Outcome
The change in frequency of migraine attacks differed signifi-
cantly among the 3 groups at 16 weeks after randomization
(Table 2). The frequency of attacks decreased in the TA group
by3.2,intheSAgroupby2.1,andtheWLgroupby1.4;agreater
reduction was observed in the TA than in the SA group (dif-
ference of 1.1 attacks; 95% CI, 0.4-1.9; P = .002) and in the TA
vs WL group (difference of 1.8 attacks; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5;
P < .001). The SA group was not statistically different from the
WL group (difference of 0.7 attacks; 95% CI, −0.1 to 1.4; P = .07)
(Table 2). The per-protocol analysis showed similar results.
Secondary Outcomes
Theeffectsofacupunctureonthesecondaryoutcomesseemed
to be persistent during follow-up. The frequency of migraine
attacks (Figure 2), migraine days, and VAS scores were signifi-
cantly lower in the TA group than in the other 2 control groups
in each interview during weeks 4 to 24 (Table 2). Significant
differences in frequency of migraine and migraine days be-
tween the 2 control groups were only found at weeks 8, 12, and
20 after inclusion within the follow-up period (Table 2).

At the end of week 4, no differences were observed be-
tween the TA group and the SA group in the MSQ, SAS, or SDS
scores (P > .05 for all comparisons) except for the emotional
functional subscale in MSQ. Compared with the WL group,
however, the TA group showed a significant improvement in
all subscales of the MSQ and SAS scores (P < .05 for all com-
parisons). Furthermore, patients in the SA group only had a
better score in the restrictive subscale of MSQ than those in
the WL group (Table 3).
The number of patients using acute pain medication, such
as ibuprofen, significantly differed among the 3 groups both
at the treatment and at follow-up. Compared with the WL con-
trol group, TA and SA group have reduced acute medication
(Table 2).
Safety
Seven patients (5 in the TA group and 2 in the SA group) re-
ported AEs during the 24 weeks. Three patients from the TA
group complained of a tingling sensation after insertion in the
acupoints located on the head. One described swelling of the
left ankle after a needle was removed from GB40. The other 3
patients (1 in the TA group and 2 in the SA group) had subcu-
taneous hemorrhage in the needle insertion area. All AEs were
reported as mild or moderate, and none required special medi-
cal interventions. The 7 patients fully recovered from the AEs
and did not withdraw from the trial.
Discussion
True acupuncture exhibited persistent, superior, and clini-
cally relevant benefits for migraine prophylaxis, reducing the
migraine frequency, number of days with migraine, and pain
intensity to a greater degree than SA or WL. Improvements in
the emotional domain of quality of life were also found. More-
over, compared with no treatment, SA may obtain a relatively
better effect in controlling the migraine frequency and num-
berofdayswithmigrainewithin8weeksaftertreatmentrather
than at the end of the treatment session. Acupuncture should
be considered as one option for migraine prophylaxis in light
of our findings. To the best of our knowledge, our study is one
of the largest trials that have used rigorous methods to test the
efficacy of true acupuncture over 24 weeks of follow-up. We
provided daily treatment during workdays for 4 weeks to
achieve a long-lasting effect for 20 weeks. We had a lower loss
to follow-up rate (1.61%) than other migraine prophylaxis
studies.12,15,16,18
We found that TA was more effective than the WL control
group for migraine prophylaxis. Our findings were congruent

with those of a previous clinical trial15 and individual patient
data meta-analysis for chronic pain.25 Furthermore, the find-
ings of the current study demonstrated that TA was signifi-
cantly better than SA for migraine prophylaxis, which has been
supported by several other RCTs.11,12,14,26 These findings were
not completely in accordance with those of our previous
study,18 which showed no significant differences between the
TA group and the SA group in weeks 5 to 8; instead, the dif-
ference appeared later, in weeks 13 to 16. We speculate that the
inconsistency was attributed to the different acupoints pre-
scribed. A standardized prescription was used in our previ-
ous study; however, semistandard therapy according to
syndrome differentiation of meridians—a more practical
approach—was used in the TA group in the present study.
Of note, a large trial from Germany demonstrated no sta-
tistical difference between TA and SA.15 We speculate that the
clinical benefits and superiority found in our trial were due to
several factors. The first was the type of treatment. We added
electrostimulation to manual acupuncture because manual
acupuncture requires more time until it reaches a similar an-
algesic effect as electrical stimulation.27 Previous studies have
reported that electrostimulation is better than manual acu-
puncture in relieving pain27-30 and could induce a longer-
lasting effect.28
Second, only patients with migraines without aura were
chosen in the present study; however, all other similar stud-
ies have included migraineurs with other types. As an acute
therapy, sumatriptan was less effective for migraine attacks
with aura than that for attacks without aura.31 We hypoth-
esized that the type of migraine attack may have an impact on
thetherapeuticoutcome,andthatpatientswithmigrainewith-
out aura are more responsive to acupuncture than migraine
with aura owing to their distinct pathogeneses.
Finally, the severity of pain that patients reported during
the baseline period might have influenced the therapeutic ef-
fects. The mean days with migraine in our trial ranged from
5.9 to 6.0 days per 4 weeks, and the mean attack frequency
was approximately 4.9 during the baseline. However, Linde
et al15 reported fewer days with migraine and fewer migraine
attacks during the baseline, and no significant difference be-
tween TA and SA was observed either at the end of treatment
or at the 12-week follow-up. Reductions in migraine severity
and frequency increased benefits in patients with more se-
vere headaches.12,32 This finding might explain the signifi-
cant difference between the TA and SA groups in our study,
and the absence of such a finding in the aforementioned RCT15
with a similar study design.
WesuspectedthattheslightimprovementintheWLgroup
was probably due to the Hawthorne effect or the effect of re-
gression to the mean, a finding that is consistent with those
of a previous report.15 Although inferior to TA, SA was still as-
sociated with clinical improvement and was possibly a result
of the nonspecific physiological effect experienced during
needling or a placebo effect originating from frequent patient–
acupuncture practitioner interactions. This could explain why
asignificantdifferencebetweenSAcontrolandWLcontrolwas
observedonlyduringthefollow-upperiodinsteadofattheend
of treatment.
These results are beneficial to patients with aura-free mi-
graine who had at least 2 monthly attacks during the 4-week
of pretreatment. Among such patients, TA was more effica-
cious for migraine prophylaxis than SA or no acupuncture, and
the improvement induced by acupuncture persists for at least
24 weeks.
Limitations
Our study also has 3 limitations. First, our study used a
semistandard prescription with fewer acupoints stimulated;
because we focused on efficacy in the present study, we did
not use personalized treatment planning that is based on the
acupuncturists’ experiences, which might cause perfor-
mance bias. Second, blinding was not possible for patients in
the WL group. This means that we may have overestimated
both the differences between TA and WL groups and that be-
tween SA and WL groups owing to nonspecific effects of
needling. Finally, our study did not test the comparative ef-
fect of acupuncture and standard therapy on migraine pro-
phylaxis. Further studies are warranted to investigate this im-
portant issue, particularly in a pragmatic environment.
Conclusions
Compared with SA and WL control groups, TA manifested per-
sisting superiority and clinically relevant benefits for at least
24weeksinmigraineprophylaxis,includingreducingthenum-
ber of migraine frequency and days with migraine, as well as
decreasing pain intensity.
