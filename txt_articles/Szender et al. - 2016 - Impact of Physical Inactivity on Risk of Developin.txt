Abstract
 Objective—In this study, we investigated whether physical inactivity was associated with risk 
of cervical cancer in women treated at an American cancer hospital.
 Methods—This case-control study included 128 patients with cervical cancer and 512 controls 
matched on age. Controls were women suspected of having but not ultimately diagnosed with a 
neoplasm. Physical inactivity was defined in accordance with the 2008 Physical Activity 
Guidelines for Americans. Thus, participants reporting on average no moderate or vigorous 
recreational physical activity were classified as inactive. Unconditional logistic regression was 
used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
 Results—Compared to non-cancer controls, those with cervical cancer had significantly 
increased odds of reporting abstinence from recreational physical activity (OR = 2.43, 95% CI:

 1.56-3.80). No association was noted between occupational -related physical inactivity and 
cervical cancer (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.58-1.36).
 Conclusions—Our findings suggest that abstinence from regular recreational physical activity 
is associated with increased odds of cervical cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first US-based 
study examining these associations. Given the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 
this study has identified yet another potential public health benefit to regular physical activity. 
Further investigation is needed using a larger sample and prospectively collected data to 
characterize dose of activity to mitigate risk and the optimal window of susceptibility.

 Introduction
Cervical cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with 
12,900 new cases and 4,100 deaths expected in 2015 [1]; the worldwide burden is even 
greater, where cancer of the cervix is the fourth most common cancer and the second most 
common cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide [2]. Established risk 
factors are numerous and include chronic HPV infection, immunosuppression, poverty and 
low socioeconomic status, early age of sexual debut, and smoking [3, 4]. The most well 
established protective factors include cervical cancer screening and vaccination against the 
most common HPV viral types. Identification of other modifiable risk factors is important to 
help direct public health efforts and reduce the burden of cervical cancer, not only in the 
United States, but around the world.
Some attention has been paid to physical activity and cervical cancer screening [5, 6], where 
lower levels of physical activity predicted less frequent cervical cancer screening. While 
screening is a protective factor against development of cervical cancer, minimal attention has 
been paid to the effects of physical activity on cervical cancer [7, 8]. The association 
between physical activity and screening has been attributed to attention to healthy lifestyle 
decisions; although the difficulty of undergoing screening examinations for patients who 
have physical disability could also play a role. However, physical activity is also associated 
with improved function of the immune system, which is vital for protection against 
development of cervical cancer [3, 9, 10].
Physical activity has been identified as a protective factor for multiple solid tumors 
including colon, breast, ovary, and endometrium [10-13]. This protection is independent 
from obesity and smoking status, which are generally associated with decreased physical 
activity [14, 15]. Despite a large number of studies conducted to explore the association 
between exposure to physical activity and risk of various types of cancer, the impact of 
physical activity (or inactivity) on a woman’s risk of developing cervical cancer is not well 
investigated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between physical 
inactivity on risk of cervical cancer. We hypothesized that abstinence from physical activity 
is associated with an increased risk of cervical carcinoma.

  Methods
 Patient Selection
This hospital-based case-control study was drawn from 15,430 women who received 
treatment at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI; Buffalo, NY) and completed the 
Patient Epidemiology Data System (PEDS) questionnaire, an epidemiologic survey 
administered to patients receiving medical services at RPCI between 1982 and 1998. 
Questions relating to physical activity (PA) were added to the survey in 1990 so the sample 
population was limited to those 5257 women enrolled in 1990 or later.
The methods of the PEDS questionnaire have been described in detail elsewhere [16-19]. 
Briefly, the questionnaire was offered to all new patients at RPCI independent of diagnosis 
or reason for seeking care, with an approximate 50% response rate [16]. Median time from 
diagnosis to participation was 21 days. For the present analysis, patients who completed the 
PEDS questionnaire and were diagnosed with cervical carcinoma were identified through 
the RPCI cancer registry. Because all cancer cases reported race as “white” we limited the 
race of controls to white race as well. The pool of 1724 women who completed the PEDS 
questionnaire, were admitted for suspected neoplastic conditions not related to cervical 
cancer, but ultimately were not diagnosed with malignancy comprised the controls for this 
study. Controls were frequency matched to cases on five-year age strata with a control-to-
case ratio of 4:1. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants upon 
recruitment and the PEDS study was approved by the RPCI institutional review board.
 Exposure and Outcome Classification
Outcome of cancer vs. non-cancer was ascertained through query of the RPCI cancer 
registry. At the time of enrollment, all participants completed the self-administered PEDS 
questionnaire. Anthropomorphic features including height and weight used to calculate body 
mass index (BMI) were recorded at the time of enrollment. This 16-page instrument covered 
information on numerous exposure categories including frequency and intensity of physical 
activity. Because of the heterogeneity in published literature with respect to classification 
and quantification of physical activity [10], we selected physical inactivity as the exposure 
of interest. If participants answered no to the questions, “have you ever had a job that 
involved regular physical activity such as walking or lifting?” and “have you ever regularly 
exercised for health or pleasure (for example, jogging, walking, aerobics, weight lifting)?”, 
or if they answered yes and indicated they performed activity less than one time per week or 
four times per month, they were classified as inactive. Physical inactivity was assessed both 
over the patient’s whole lifetime, as well as limited to the 20 years prior to study enrollment. 
Activity 20 years prior to enrollment was ascertained by using the patient’s age at 
enrollment, age at starting the reported physical activity (if any), and duration (in years) of 
participation in the activity.
 Statistical Analysis
Study size was determined according to the number of cervical cancer cases identified in the 
cancer registry during the study period and the selection of matching 4:1 was based on the 
number of available non-cancer controls who completed the PEDS questionnaire. All

 analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Bivariate 
statistics were calculated to describe the sample and test for differences between cases and 
controls. The Pearson χ2 test was applied to categorical data and the Student’s t test to 
continuous data. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Standard model 
diagnostics were performed. Potential confounders were considered based on a priori 
consideration of association to exposure variables, known risk factors for cervical cancer, 
and proxies for sexual activity. The multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted 
using forward, backward, and stepwise selection of potential confounders as covariates. 
Only those covariates that resulted in a change in the age-adjusted OR by more than 10% 
were included in the adjusted model [20]. Known confounders were not forced into the final 
model. The final adjusted model included age at diagnosis/participation, family history of 
cervical cancer, and body mass index. Patients with missing exposure data were excluded 
from analysis.
 Results
We identified 385 patients with primary incident cervical cancer diagnosed between 1982 
and 1998 that were treated at our institution, 128 of whom were diagnosed after 1990 when 
the physical activity questions were added to the PEDS questionnaire. Of those 128 patients, 
124 (96.9%) completed the physical activity portion of the PEDS questionnaire and had 
otherwise complete data available for analysis. The physical activity question response rate 
did not differ between cases and controls (96.9% vs. 94.6%, p = 0.29). There was also no 
difference between responders and non-responders to the physical activity questions with 
respect to smoking status, alcohol intake, family history of cervical cancer, or BMI. 
Descriptive characteristics of the cases and non-cancer controls are summarized in Table 1. 
The reported frequency of overall physical inactivity (no occupational or recreational 
physical activity) were 31.1% and 26.1% among cases and controls, respectively (p = 0.27). 
Cases were more likely than controls to have not completed high school, have a family 
history of cervical cancer, and be obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2).
The odds of cervical cancer was associated with abstinence from physical activity but not 
occupational physical activity as shown in Table 2. The odds of reporting no participation in 
recreational physical activity were more than twice as high for those with cervical cancer, 
compared with the controls (OR = 2.16 95% CI: 1.42 – 3.29). There was no difference in 
reporting occupational physical inactivity (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.68-1.54).
The odds of reporting no recreational physical activity over the 20 years prior to diagnosis 
were also higher among those with cervical cancer compared with non-cancer controls (OR 
= 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28-3.04). However, abstinence from occupational physical activity 20 
years prior to study enrollment was not associated with increased odds (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 
0.64-1.54) of cervical cancer (Table 3). For both current and historical domains of physical 
inactivity, abstinence from both recreational and occupational physical activity was not 
associated with risk of cervical cancer. All significant associations were robust to adjustment 
for age, family history, and BMI.

  Discussion
In this epidemiologic case-control study, we observed a consistent association between 
physical inactivity and cervical cancer risk. The greatest risk is associated with abstinence 
from recreational physical activity; abstinence from occupational physical activity does not 
appear to alter the risk of cervical cancer. This study adds to the body of evidence linking 
physical inactivity and solid tumor risks in women. Unlike other published studies [4, 12, 
21-23] the current report utilized a robust patient questionnaire administered within 6 
months (median 21 days) of diagnosis. Further, the use of physical inactivity as the exposure 
variable may limit the impact of patient reported biases [10, 24].
Studies in other solid tumors have implicated changes in sex hormone levels, decreased 
BMI, decreased insulin, altered inflammatory pathways, and improved immune function as 
some of the protective mechanisms for physical activity [3, 10]. While several of these 
mechanisms may be in play with cervical cancer, altered immunity has the greatest face 
validity, based on the almost necessary cause of HPV infection for development of cervical 
cancer [25]. Multiple of these mechanisms are associated with immune function and the 
tumor microenvironment, suggesting that immune function or dysfunction may be a 
common final pathway in the development of cervical cancer.
The primary source for bias in this study is the selection of all patients from a single regional 
referral center for cancer care. It is possible that Berkson’s bias is additionally present 
because non-cancer controls may have been referred to this center due to a greater number 
of comorbidities, which could lead to differential bias in exposure frequency. Other 
limitations of the study are related to the patient-reported nature of exposure ascertainment. 
Although the questions were standardized and administered to all patients, inherent 
methodological challenges associated with hospital-based study designs, in general, remain. 
Selection bias is of greatest concern for the present study because of the 50% response rate 
to the survey and our inability to ascertain how patients who declined participation may have 
differed from those included in the study. Recall bias is possible in any questionnaire; 
however, patients were enrolled on average within 3 weeks of diagnosis. Patients were 
matched based on age, to protect against confounding from that variable, and the significant 
association between recreational physical inactivity and cervical cancer persisted after 
adjusting for BMI. Unmeasured potential confounders for which we were not able to 
account include HPV status, history of Papanicolau testing, human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) status, history of hormone use, parity, age of sexual debut, and history of sexually 
transmitted diseases. Therefore, residual confounding could have impacted the results.
Strengths of study included that we were able to assess the potential confounding role of 
well-established risk factors for cervical cancer, as well as other factors that tend to parallel 
physical activity (or inactivity) in lifestyle patterns, including BMI, alcohol use, tobacco 
smoking, and education. An additional strength of our study is that our analyses included 
both recreational and occupational domains of physical inactivity. Further, our use of 
chronic, lifetime physical inactivity as the exposure of interest enabled us to identify the 
most sedentary individuals in population. Finally, the use of life-time activity reports 
decreased the likelihood of observed associations resulting from reverse causation.

 Ultimately, we observed a significant association between self-reported recreational physical 
inactivity with odds of developing cervical cancer. If confirmed, these findings could have 
an important public health implication, particularly in the context of the obesity epidemic, 
where recommendations by national organizations are frequent and targets are escalating in 
both duration and intensity. However, the present study illustrates that any physical activity 
may reduce the risk of cervical cancer; this remained consistent when physical inactivity 
was considered as a pre-diagnostic chronic or even life-long risk factor. Further studies are 
needed to confirm the present findings and to define the optimal window of physical activity 
for cervical cancer prophylaxis.
