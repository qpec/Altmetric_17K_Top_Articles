Digit reduction is a major trend that characterizes horse evolution, but its
causes and consequences have rarely been quantitatively tested. Using
beam analysis on fossilized centre metapodials, we tested how locomotor
bone stresses changed with digit reduction and increasing body size
across the horse lineage. Internal bone geometry was captured from 13
fossil horse genera that covered the breadth of the equid phylogeny and
the spectrum of digit reduction and body sizes, from Hyracotherium to
Equus. To account for the load-bearing role of side digits, a novel, continuous
measure of digit reduction was also established—toe reduction index (TRI).
Our results show that without accounting for side digits, three-toed horses
as late as Parahippus would have experienced physiologically untenable
bone stresses. Conversely, when side digits are modelled as load-bearing,
species at the base of the horse radiation through Equus probably maintained
a similar safety factor to fracture stress. We conclude that the centre meta-
podial compensated for evolutionary digit reduction and body mass
increases by becoming more resistant to bending through substantial
positive allometry in internal geometry. These results lend support to
two historical hypotheses: that increasing body mass selected for a single,
robust metapodial rather than several smaller ones; and that, as horse
limbs became elongated, the cost of inertia from the side toes outweighed
their utility for stabilization or load-bearing.
1. Introduction
Digit reduction and loss is a repeated theme in tetrapod evolution, in groups as
disparate as theropod dinosaurs, lizards, marsupials, rodents and ungulates
[1–6]. Reduction from the ancestral state of five digits, or more in Devonian tet-
rapods [7], contributes to the remarkable diversity of limb form and function in
living tetrapods. Evolutionary digit reduction requires interaction between
development and selective pressures that drive adaptation. The developmental
mode of digit reduction varies, even within mammalian orders [8,9], and the
selective pressures that interact with these developmental changes are often
associated with new ecological behaviours and locomotor modes [4,10,11]. In
dipodid rodents, for example, repeated convergent evolution of reduced
digits suggests selection for increased bipedality, with a concomitant shift to
rapid, unpredictable locomotion for predator evasion [4,12].
One of the most extreme examples of digit reduction is the modern horse
(genus Equus), which evolved monodactyly (a single toe) from an ancestral
state of four digits in front and three behind [13]. All phalanges other than
digit III are eliminated, and metapodials II and IV are vestigial ‘splint’ bones
that taper off halfway down the length of metapodial III. In horses, the classic
explanation for digit reduction is that of an adaptive response to the replace-
ment of forests by grasslands, although the specific underlying driver for
monodactyly has been debated. Shifting to hard turf and open spaces is
suggested to select for long, slender legs to increase speed for predator

 escape [14], decrease the energetic cost of locomotion
by reducing distal limb mass [15] or enhance stability for
high-speed, straight-lined movements [16]. An additional
hypothesis proposed for digit reduction in the horse lineage
is that evolutionary increases in body mass produced greater
bending forces on the limbs, and a single digit resists bending
forces better than several smaller digits of the same total
size [17,18]. We aim to test the body mass hypothesis by
exploring how locomotion-related stresses in the metapodials
change with the evolution of larger body sizes and reduced
side digits.
Prior work on equid limb evolution has focused on the
transition from digitigrade to unguligrade posture, generally
using Mesohippus (tridactyl with large side digits), Merychip-
pus
(tridactyl
with
reduced
side
digits)
and
Equus
(monodactyl) as exemplars for key stages of digit reduction.
Using inferences from tendon scars and articular surfaces,
Mesohippus has been reconstructed as subunguligrade with
a digital pad that helps absorb forces, while Merychippus
has been reconstructed as unguligrade with non-functional
side digits (similar to Equus) [17,19,20]. These studies
assume that as the foot becomes more upright and the central
phalanges elongate, the side digits lose function. A mechan-
ical investigation of digit reduction estimated bending
forces on the third metacarpal in all three taxa [21]. Using
external measurements and cross-sections (estimated from
fractured specimens), mid-shaft bending stresses were calcu-
lated to be within the range found by in vivo experiments on
mammals. Forces for Mesohippus were reduced by 50%,
assuming that each side digit carried 25% of the load, but
the side digits of Merychippus were assumed to play no func-
tional role [21]. The only other test of load-bearing in side
digits comes from a Hipparion trackway that shows contact
from the side digits, supporting possible load-bearing or
stabilizing functions [22].
Here we significantly expand the beam bending approach
by using modern three-dimensional imaging to capture the
internal bone geometry of metapodial III from 13 fossil
horse genera. The taxa in this study cover the breadth of
the equid phylogeny and the full spectrum of body sizes
and digit reduction, from the dog-sized, tetra/tridactyl Hyra-
cotherium to the large, monodactyl Equus. Unlike prior
studies, we also quantitatively account for the changing size
of side digits through evolutionary time by scaling ground
reaction forces relative to a continuous measure of digit
state. Our study addresses the following three questions
and associated hypotheses:
(1) How does stress on the centre metapodial change with
evolutionary increases in body size? As quadrupeds tend
to maintain similar long bone safety factors regardless of
size [23,24], we hypothesized maximal metapodial III
stresses to remain constant through evolution by adjusting
its cross-sectional geometry to increase resistance to
bending.
(2) Did side digits play a load-bearing role during horse evol-
ution? If load is placed entirely on the centre metapodial,
we hypothesized stress on metacarpal III to be high in
species with load-bearing side digits and within normal
ranges for species with non-load-bearing side digits. Like-
wise, if side digits share the load proportional to their size,
we hypothesized stress on the centre metapodial to
remain constant through evolution.
(3) Is the geometry of metacarpal III better or worse at with-
standing bending forces than metatarsal III? In extant
horses, the metatarsal experiences slightly higher bending
forces than the metacarpal because it is less closely
aligned to the ground reaction force [25,26]. Because the
equid hindlimb shows reduced digits earlier than the fore-
limb, we hypothesized a more rapid increase in bending
strength of metatarsal III relative to metacarpal III.
2. Material and methods
(a) Specimens and internal geometry
This study uses adult metapodials (n ¼ 26) from 12 fossil horse
genera and Tapirus bairdii (figure 1; electronic supplementary
material, methods and table S1). Tapirs are the most relevant
comparative outgroup, as they are the only extant perissodactyls
with similar distal limb morphology to early horses (but see [27]
for discussion of varying morphology and locomotor styles
within the genus). All specimens were micro-CT scanned using a
Nikon Metrology (X-Tek) HMXST225 MicroCT system, recon-
structed as a downsampled TIFF stack, and processed using the
Bone Geometry function of the BoneJ (v. 1.0.0) plugin for IMAGEJ
(v. 1.48v) [28,29]. In addition to bone length (l ), we extracted
from every slice the cross-sectional area (A), second moment of
area about the mediolateral (IML, bending in the anteroposterior
direction) and anteroposterior (IAP, bending in the mediolateral
plane) axes, and radius from the neutral axis in both directions
(yAP, yML; electronic supplementary material, figure S1). The
mid-shaft slice of each specimen was then used for bending analy-
sis (see below); if the exact midshaft slice was damaged or
otherwise unsuitable, we chose the nearest suitable slice.
We tested the scaling of evolutionary changes in midshaft
cross-sectional area (a measure of bone compressive strength)
and second moment of area (a measure of resistance to bending).

 variables [30]. Using major axis regression in the R package
smatr [31], we then tested whether the slopes of the mass versus
internal geometry contrasts were significantly different from iso-
metry (defined as a slope of 2/3 for cross-sectional area and 4/3
for second moment of area). Cross-sectional area and second
moment of area were also plotted along the length of the bone,
with genera coloured according to digit state, to assess how
internal geometry changes with reduction in digits. For this com-
parison, second moment of area (IAP and IML, mm4) was size-
corrected by taking the 4th root to provide a size-independent
measure of shape, while retaining the evolutionary signal
of increasing bone length [32]. Similarly, cross-sectional area
(A, mm2) was corrected by taking the square root.
(b) Loading scenarios and conditions
To estimate bone stress, we simulated two loading scenarios:
normal, steady-state forward locomotion (approximately trotting
speed) and high-performance forward locomotion (rapid accel-
eration or jumping). Based on in vivo locomotion data on
modern horses [25,26], the angle of each metapodial relative to
the ground reaction force was set to 58 and 208, respectively,
for these two loading scenarios. For each loading scenario,
either (i) a full body-weight load was applied to the centre meta-
podial (digit III) using reconstructed body mass values [33–36],
matching the ground reaction force that medium-sized animals
experience at a trotting gait, including extant horses [25,26,37];
or (ii) the body-weight load applied to metapodial III was
reduced relative to the side digits bearing some of the load.
The relative body-weight load applied to metapodial III was
determined by a toe reduction index (TRI; see electronic sup-
plementary material, methods and table S2). TRI is a ratio of
side digit length to centre digit length in the proximal phalanx.
The ratio ranges from 0, where no side toes are present (e.g.
Equus), to 1, where all digits are of equal size (figure 1), using
the simplifying assumption that load capacity correlates directly
with digit size. For example, a TRI of 0 (e.g. Equus) produces a
scaled load equal to the full body weight, whereas a TRI of 1
(all three digits equal in size) produces a scaled load of 1/3
body weight.
(c) Beam bending
Using beam mechanics, we estimated the stress at the metapodial
midshaft (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). We cal-
culated bending in the anteroposterior direction, simulating
forward locomotion, by combining stress from axial com-
pression,
sc ¼ � Fm cosðbÞ þ Fgrf cosðuÞ
A
,
ð2:1Þ
and bending,
sb ¼ + Fm sinðbÞ � Fgrf sinðuÞ � h � y
I
:
ð2:2Þ
The muscle force Fm required to counteract the ground reac-
tion force Fgrf is defined as
Fm ¼ Fgrf � R
r
,
ð2:3Þ
where r is the moment arm of Fm and R is the moment arm of
Fgrf; b is the angle of Fm to the long axis of the bone; u is the
angle of Fgrf to the long axis of the bone; and h (¼ l/2) is the
height to the bone’s midshaft, where the bone’s total length is l
(electronic supplementary material, figure S1).
Moment arms were taken from empirical values for the meta-
podial-phalanx joint in extant Equus (r ¼ 30 mm and R ¼
100 mm for a 450 kg animal) [38,39] and scaled such that
r / M0:43
body [23,40], where Mbody was the reconstructed body
mass of each genus [33–36]. Effective mechanical advantage
(EMA), defined as r/R, scales proportional to Mbody
0.258. With a
starting point of Equus EMA ¼ 30/100 mm ¼ 0.3, we scaled
EMA and back-calculated R for all taxa. The ground reaction
force (Fgrf) was set equal to a body-weight load for each species.
In the first condition, the whole load was placed on the centre
metapodial. In the TRI condition, that load was reduced pro-
portional to TRI, as discussed previously. We chose a b of 08
to reflect that the muscle-tendon units act almost directly in
line with the metapodials in extant horses [25,26].
Under a bending load, stress at the bone’s midshaft cross-sec-
tion will range from positive (tensile side of the bend; anterior, if
u is positive) to negative (compressive side of the bend; posterior,
if u is positive). We can therefore calculate the maximal stress on
the anterior and posterior surfaces as sAP ¼ sc + sb, with axial
compression reducing stress on the tensile surface (sc þ sbÞ
and compounding stress on the compressive surface (sc � sb).
Safety factor was calculated as the ratio of the bone’s fracture
stress (approximately 200 MPa in compression and 170 MPa in
tension [41]) to the maximal stress calculated in this study.
When a metacarpal and metatarsal from the same specimen
were available (n ¼ 4), we assessed the ratio of maximal stress
in the metacarpal versus metatarsal using the body-weight and
TRI-scaled loading conditions.
3. Results
(a) Metapodial internal geometry
After phylogenetic correction, metapodial A (resistance to
axial
compression)
shows
strong
positive
allometry
(figure 2a; electronic supplementary material, table S3). Meta-
podial IML (resistance to bending in the anteroposterior
direction) also shows strong phylogenetically corrected posi-
tive allometry (figure 2b; electronic supplementary material,
table S4). For each metapodial specimen, cross-sectional geo-
metry variables remain consistent along the length of the
bone with a typical peak near the articular ends (figure 2c;
electronic supplementary material, figures S2 and S3). As
TRI decreases in fossil equids, size-independent resistance
to anteroposterior bending increases, as shown by the
higher values of size-corrected IML for lines of warmer
colour (figure 2c). Tapirus, the outgroup, has significantly
greater resistance to bending relative to equids with similar
TRI values, perhaps reflecting adaptation to a larger body
mass (closer to Equus than to more basal taxa). Equus meta-
carpals show the greatest size-independent resistance to
bending,
followed
by
Pliohippus
and
the
hipparionine
horses. The lowest size-independent resistance to bending is
Hyracotherium. Results are similar for resistance to mediolat-
eral
bending
(electronic
supplementary
material,
figure
S2b), with higher overall values of IAP, reflecting the slight
anteroposterior cross-sectional flattening of most metapodials
in this study (figure 1).
(b) Metacarpal stress during normal (trotting)
locomotion
During normal locomotion, the posterior metapodial surface
experiences the greatest load due to the combination of bend-
ing
and
axial
compression
(electronic
supplementary
material, figure S4). The metacarpals in all taxa studied main-
tained a safety factor of at least 1.7, even without accounting
for the side digits bearing some of the load (mean safety

 factor 3.1 + 1.1; table 1). The average posterior surface stress
during normal locomotion supporting a body weight load is
270.1 + 21.1 MPa, higher than would be expected for trot-
ting locomotion [25]. After scaling the load by TRI to
account for side digits distributing the load, the average
posterior surface stress is reduced to 231.6 + 7.4 MPa,
yielding a higher and more consistent safety factor (6.7 +
1.6) across taxa.
(c) Metacarpal stress during performance (acceleration/
jumping) locomotion
During performance locomotion (figure 3), the anterior meta-
carpal surface is loaded in tension and the posterior surface
loaded in compression. Without scaling for TRI, many
fossil taxa approach or surpass the tensile fracture stress of
bone on the anterior surface and/or the compressive fracture
stress on the posterior surface (black bars). Most tridactyl taxa
exhibit
posterior
surface
stresses
within
approximately
50 MPa of fracture stress. The exceptions are the later, hippar-
ionine horses (especially Pseudhipparion and Cormohipparion),
as well as Pliohippus and Equus, which all exhibit stresses
closer to 2100 MPa (a safety factor of 2). When accounting
for the side digits by scaling the load relative to TRI, maximal
stress is below 2100 MPa for almost all taxa (maximum
2109 MPa for one specimen of Mesohippus, a safety factor
of
1.8).
Average
posterior
surface
stress
is
267.7+
19.5 MPa, providing a safety factor of 3.2+0.9. On the
anterior surface, tensile stress averages 29.6+14.2 MPa for
all taxa. In all cases, adjusting for TRI leaves maximal stresses

 within or below the safety factor range of 2–4 found during
terrestrial locomotion in birds and mammals [42].
(d) Metacarpal versus metatarsal maximal stress
In Mesohippus, Equus and extant Tapirus, metatarsal stresses
range from 7 to 33% higher than metacarpal stresses under
performance conditions with weight scaled by TRI (up to
25.5 MPa difference; table 2). In Archaeohippus, metacarpal
stress is 8% higher than metatarsal stress (a 3.2 MPa differ-
ence). Results are similar for a non-scaled load, but with
higher
magnitudes.
Overall,
results
for all
metatarsals
follow the same pattern as metacarpals, with similar safety
factors (electronic supplementary material, figure S5).
4. Discussion
(a) Simulated stress matches in vivo stress in Equus
Results for a Pleistocene fossil Equus, with maximal metacar-
pal stresses of 234 MPa for normal trotting locomotion and
270 MPa for performance locomotion, are similar to maximal
in vivo stress from living Equus (231 MPa during forward
locomotion and 253 MPa for jumping [25]). After reducing
the forces on the metacarpal relative to side digit proportions,
mean safety factor during performance locomotion for all
taxa
(3.2+ 0.9)
aligns
closely
with
experimentally
determined safety factor values from 2 to 4 across a
wide range of mammalian species [40,42]. Furthermore,
Mesohippus and Equus metacarpal stresses agree with those
calculated in 1985 by Thomason, who used more simplifying
assumptions and less detailed three-dimensional geometry
but incorporated estimates of foot posture (which we did
not) [21]. During trotting locomotion with the side digits
bearing proportional load, we calculate a posterior midshaft
stress of 234 MPa for Equus, and 234 MPa and 245 MPa
for two Mesohippus specimens in this study, which agrees
with
Thomason’s
results
of
248.3 MPa
in
Equus
and
233.4 MPa in Mesohippus [21].
(b) Stress on the centre metapodial decreases with
increasing body mass
When a body-weight load is placed on MCIII, its midshaft
stress decreases as body mass increases through evolutionary
time (figure 3, black bars). This result is in contrast with
living vertebrates from mice to elephants, which show similar
limb safety factor regardless of body mass [40]. Changes in
internal geometry explain this pattern: resistance to bending
and axial compression in the third metapodial shows strong
positive allometry in the equid lineage (figure 2a,b). Because
cross-sectional area and second moment of area increased,
total stress during locomotion is reduced as body mass

 increases. Not only is this pattern of safety factor unexpected,
it suggests that many tridactyl taxa could not have safely
loaded only metapodial III during high-performance loco-
motion (figure 3, black bars that approach or surpass the
red line of fracture). These results point to evolutionary com-
pensation by the centre digit for increasing body mass and
shrinking side digits, but also suggest that the side digits
played a necessary role in earlier taxa. Alternatively, bending
resistance in the centre digit could have increased in response
to increasing body mass, which then relaxed selection for
load-bearing side digits. Postural changes in the angle of
the metapodial to the ground reaction force could also influ-
ence safety factor as side digits were reduced and body mass
increased. Although we do not account for postural changes
in this study, less upright posture in earlier equids would
probably
increase
the
reconstructed
stresses,
as
larger
ground reaction force angles would lead to greater bending
moments and larger muscle forces.
(c) Load-bearing side digits are critical in most tridactyl
taxa
When side digits are load-bearing, metapodial midshaft stress
remains approximately constant through equid evolution
(white bars, figure 3). Estimated metacarpal safety factor is bio-
logically feasible and consistent (average safety factor of 3.2+
0.9). Even during more demanding locomotion such as accel-
eration or jumping, midshaft stress does not change with
digit reduction or increasing body mass—consistent with
bone stresses determined for extant quadrupeds [40].
We expected Pliohippus to have sufficient safety factor at
high performance even without accounting for the side
digits because the population of Pliohippus pernix from Ash-
fall, the source of our specimen, contains both tridactyl and
monodactyl individuals [43]. Such variation would seem to
suggest that the biomechanical role of the side digits for
weight support, if any, was not critical during locomotion.
Under the high-performance scenario, the Pliohippus metacar-
pal had a safety factor of 2 without side digits and 4 when
scaling by TRI. These results bracket the Equus safety factor
of 2.9 but are similar to the hipparionine horses, whose
side digits probably did provide utility, as discussed in the
next section. However, Pliohippus shows the highest size-
independent resistance to anteroposterior bending after
Equus and Tapirus (figure 2). Our results do not definitively
show that the side digits of Pliohippus at Ashfall were without
weight support function, but support the possibility.
(d) Metacarpals resist bending slightly better than
metatarsals
We hypothesized that the bending performance of metacar-
pals and metatarsals might be decoupled because of the
asymmetrical nature of digit reduction between the forelimb
and hindlimb. With ground reaction force equivalent to one
body-weight—which both the metacarpal and metatarsal
experience
during
faster
locomotion
in
extant
Equus
[25,26]—and similar angle deviations between bone and
GRF alignment of 58 or 208, the metatarsals of fossil horses
generally showed slightly higher stresses than the corre-
sponding metacarpals from the same specimens. These
differences
were
small
in
magnitude,
ranging
from
þ25.5 MPa to 23.2 MPa in the metatarsal relative to metacar-
pal (a maximum of 33% difference). Our results do not
account for a greater body weight load in the forelimb or a
greater angle in the hindlimb [26], which could produce
greater loads in the metacarpal or metatarsal respectively,
but the values for both are within experimental results for
extant Equus [25,26]. We therefore do not find strong support
for evolutionary decoupling of the stresses experienced by
the metacarpal and metatarsal.
(e) Evolutionary timing and the loss of functional side
digits
Based on our results, side toes were critical for load-bearing
to some extent through at least Parahippus, the genus at the
base of the grazing adaptive radiation. At that point in
equid evolution, the distal limb had been significantly
elongated and the digits were reduced; Parahippus had a
TRI of 0.61, reduced from 0.89 in Hyracotherium. At that
time, true grasslands were part of the North American flora
[44] and may have been spreading significantly [45], which
could have provided selective pressure for reduced distal
limb mass to save on costs of locomotion over large home
ranges [15] or reduced the need for lateral stability [16].
Later, some hipparionine horses (Pseudhipparion and Cormo-
hipparion) evolved a centre metacarpal that may have been
robust enough to maintain an acceptable safety factor
without load-bearing use of the side digits (figure 3, black

 bars). Although these genera show reasonable safety factors
under the conditions of our analysis, a trackway attributed
to the closely related genus Hipparion shows ground contact
by the side digits [22], which would provide a greater
safety factor for the centre metacarpal (approximately 4
instead of 2). As Thomason [17] points out, the contact of
side digits in the trackway also supports a possible stabilizing
function for the side toes, as argued by Shotwell [16]. Selec-
tion for stabilization could be separate from any need
for stress reduction via load-bearing, and as such would be
unrelated to safety factor in the traditional sense.
5. Conclusion
Our beam analysis indicates that fossil horse metapodials
maintained a similar safety factor throughout evolution
when accounting for TRI. Furthermore, as digits were
reduced and body mass increased, the centre metapodial
changed
in
its
internal
geometry,
showing
allometric
increases in cross-sectional area and second moment of area
relative to body size. According to our results, side digits
were necessary for load-bearing in earlier taxa, including
Parahippus, to avoid unsafe levels of stress in the centre meta-
podial. The mechanism of support could be directly through
ground contact or, as has been suggested previously,
indirectly via interdigital ligaments [17]. Our results support
the hypothesis that increasing body mass was a potential
driver of digit reduction because a single, robust digit could
resist the increased bending forces better than three smaller
digits of the same total bone mass [46] (see electronic sup-
plementary material, methods and table S5). However,
other factors were probably involved. In combination with
increasingly parasagittal limb motion and lengthened distal
limbs, the reduced side digits—with their reduced mechan-
ical function—could have incurred sufficient inertial penalty
to distal limb motions to either decrease speed or increase
energetic cost [17,21]. Thus, selection may have been for a
combination of increased strength and decreased inertia, or
one followed by the other.
