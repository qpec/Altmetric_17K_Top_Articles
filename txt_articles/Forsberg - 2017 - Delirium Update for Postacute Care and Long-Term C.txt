elirium continues to be a problem and a cause of morbidity and mortality in all 
health care settings, especially in postacute care (PAC) and long-term care (LTC) 
settings.1 Postacute care after acute hospitalization is common.2 Many commu-
nity physicians are likely to encounter elderly patients who may enter or have recently been 
in PAC settings.2 Also, PAC outcomes have been increasingly scrutinized because PAC is 
a major recipient of Medicare spending.3 
 
Delirium is a syndrome of altered mental status with prominent deficits in attention and 
a characteristic fluctuating course. Delirium often has a medical cause, but the symptoms 
can persist even after the medical condition has been resolved. Symptoms can persist for 
weeks to months after initial recognition.4
 
Many causes of delirium exist that can have different characteristics and prognoses.2 In-
fection is the most common cause of delirium in elderly patients.5 Medication, often as 
polypharmacy, can cause anticholinergic delirium. Terminal delirium during the dying pro-
cess is characterized by restlessness, confusion or agitation, and day-night reversal. Other 
types of delirium may result from hepatic or renal failure, hypoxia, benzodiazepine or alcohol 
withdrawal, intoxication, metabolic or endocrine disorders, or sleep deprivation. 
 
Although advances have been made in recognizing, managing, preventing, and under-
standing the long-term consequences of delirium in the acute care environment,6-8 fewer 
articles about delirium in PAC and LTC settings have been published. Shorter hospital 
length of stay has led to more patients discharged with acute medical conditions to PAC and 
LTC settings as well as a larger proportion of patients with delirium in these settings.9,10 The 
Delirium Update for Postacute Care and  
Long-Term Care Settings: A Narrative Review
Martin M. Forsberg, MD
Advances have been made in our understanding of the neuropathogenesis, 
recognition, and strategies for reducing the incidence of delirium in acute-
care settings. However, relatively little attention has been given to delirium in 
elderly patients in the postacute care (PAC) and long-term care (LTC) settings. 
The present article reviews the most relevant current research pertaining to 
this population. Hospital patients with delirium are often discharged to PAC 
settings. Delirium that develops in the LTC setting is often more insidious and 
subtle in presentation. Despite incorporating systematic screening tools for 
delirium in PAC and LTC settings, delirium prevention strategies have not yet 
been shown to be beneficial beyond the acute-care setting. The management 
of delirium combined with dementia and guidance on when it is appropriate to 
use antipsychotic medications is also discussed.

Predisposing Risk Factors
Risk factors for delirium in LTC settings include de-
mentia, polypharmacy, restraint use, multiple medical 
illnesses, frailty, advanced age, and alcohol use. Pa-
tients who have had to be physically restrained are 5 
times more likely to have delirium.15 Substantial 
overlap in symptoms of delirium and dementia exist. 
Overall, 68% of new LTC patients have dementia and 
many have several of the other risk factors as well.16 
patients in PAC and LTC settings are arguably the most 
vulnerable and need to be included in the evidence base.
 
The current article reviews the literature on delirium 
in PAC and LTC settings and provides an update for cli-
nicians working in these facilities, in the community, or 
in hospitals with patients who may need PAC or LTC 
placement. This review also addresses the scope of de-
lirium in these settings, predisposing factors, clinical 
outcomes, difficulties in identification, and methods of 
preventing and managing delirium. 
 
The articles in this review were obtained from a 
search of the Cochrane and PubMed databases for full-
text articles in English published within the past 10 years 
using delirium with PAC or LTC and appropriate syn-
onyms. Reviews and clinical trials were included. The 
articles selected in this review were chosen based on the 
relevance to the objective.
Scope of the Problem
About 22% of hospitalized elderly patients are trans-
ferred to inpatient PAC services, such as skilled nursing 
facilities and LTC placement.3 In 2014, there were 
 
2.4 million PAC stays for 1.7 million Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries, which cost Medicare $28.6 billion.11 
Postacute care facilities admit patients who are often 
quite ill, and as many as 1 in 7 of these patients has 
 
delirium.12 Additionally, PAC facilities with more state 
survey deficiencies tend to admit a higher proportion 
 
of patients with delirium.12 Hospitalized patients with 
delirium are nearly 3 times more likely to need LTC 
placement or to die within a year.1 
 
The 1-year mortality rate for delirium approaches 
 
40%.4 The mortality risk is a factor of how long delirium 
persists.1 Delirium is a common symptom of medical illness 
in LTC settings.13 It occurs in nearly 18% of LTC patients 
with an acute illness and occurs more frequently in women 
(OR, 2.59).13 Also, LTC patients are 10 times more likely 
than those who are not in LTC settings to have delirium 
when evaluated in the emergency department (ED).14 
KEY POINTS
Delirium is a syndrome of altered mental status with 
prominent deficits in attention and a characteristic 
fluctuating course. 
In all health care settings, especially in postacute  
care and long-term care, delirium is a cause  
of morbidity and mortality.
Although delirium often has a medical cause,  
symptoms can persist even after the medical  
condition has been resolved.
Delirium occurs in nearly 18% of long-term care  
patients who develop an acute illness and occurs  
more frequently in women. 
Risk factors for delirium in long-term care include 
dementia, polypharmacy, restraint use, multiple 
illnesses, frailty, advanced age, and alcohol use.
New-onset perceptual disturbance, disorganized 
thinking, and worsening 3-object registration test  
results each predict delirium independently; patients  
with changes in all 3 symptoms were 3 times more  
likely to have delirium.
Unless delirium detection occurs early, the chance  
of a complete recovery is low. Delirium detection  
should ideally occur early and be communicated  
at the transition of care.
Instruments used to identify delirium include 
Confusion Assessment Method and Delirium Rating 
Scale Revised-98.
Infection is the most common cause of delirium  
in elderly patients.
Low-dose antipsychotic medication is commonly  
used in patients with delirium. 
Although acute delirium should be seen as a medical 
emergency, the potential risks of transporting patients 
with delirium to the emergency department where  
their baseline is not known should be considered.

ties of daily living or falls, but it is a risk factor for cogni-
tive function decline (OR, 4.59).13 Delirium has tripled 
the risk of PAC placement leading to LTC placement.20 
The presence of residual subsyndromal delirium at the 
time of hospital discharge also predicts adverse out-
comes.27 von Gunten et al28 found that delirium and de-
pression during the first year of LTC placement were 
associated with more complicated trajectories of recur-
rent delirium until death. 
Identification
Without structured evaluation, recognition of delirium 
can be unreliable. Voyer et al29 found that detection rates 
ranged from 25% to 67%. Morandi et al30 found that in 
patients with delirium, the word delirium was used in 9% 
of medical records. Instead, confusion was more com-
monly used and led to less management actions than 
when delirium was used in communication with physi-
cians.30 Unless delirium detection occurs early, the 
chance of a complete recovery is low.31 Delirium detec-
tion should ideally occur at admission and be communi-
cated at the transition of care.
 
Several instruments for identifying delirium have 
been used with good results. With appropriate training, 
nonclinicians can detect delirium with high interrater 
reliability using a structured delirium assessment pro-
cess.32 Two popular instruments are the Confusion As-
sessment Method (CAM) and the Delirium Rating Scale 
Revised-98 (DRS-98). The CAM was developed in 1990 
and has several modified forms. In 2014, Inouye et al33 
validated a new delirium severity measure based on the 
CAM that correlated with outcomes such as length of 
stay, mortality, and care dependence. The DRS-98 can be 
used to track severity. 
 
The Minimum Data Set (MDS) screens elderly pa-
tients’ functional capabilities and can identify health 
problems. This tool is completed within 2 weeks of 
 
admission to a nursing home, then quarterly or after 
 
notable changes. The MDS aims to increase delirium 
awareness and recognition in PAC and LTC settings16 and 
was updated in 2010 to include the CAM questionnaire. 
The combination of delirium and dementia in PAC set-
tings increases the odds of walking dependence 
 
(OR, 15.5), institutionalization (OR, 5.0), and 1-year 
mortality (OR, 1.8).17 Voyer et al18 have studied ante-
cedent symptoms of delirium and found a pattern of 3 
symptoms: new-onset perceptual disturbance, disorga-
nized thinking, and worsening results of the 3-object 
registration test (part of the Mini-Mental State Exami-
nation). Each of these symptoms predicted delirium 
independently, and delirium was 3 times more likely to 
develop in patients with changes in all of these symp-
toms.18 Kolanowski et al19 reported that PAC patients’ 
daily pain ratings correlated with more delirium symp-
toms. However, Yoo et al20 found that delirium was as-
sociated with LTC placement, but pain was not. 
Delirium was reported to occur in 27% of patients after 
stroke and was associated with an increased risk of LTC 
placement of these patients within 12 months (hazard 
ratio, 3.54).21 In patients who have had cardiac proce-
dures, delirium has been associated with increased 
mortality (13.5% vs 2.0% in patients without delirium) 
and hospital readmissions (45.7% vs 26.5%), as well as 
reduced quality of life.22 
Outcomes
Marcantonio et al23 found that patients admitted to PAC 
settings with delirium had a 6-month mortality rate of 
25.0% compared with 5.7% in patients admitted without 
delirium. Kiely et al24 added that the 1-year mortality rate 
was mostly elevated in the hypoactive subtype of 
 
delirium. In one study, PAC patients whose delirium 
 
resolved by 2 weeks without recurrence regained all of 
their prehospital functional level, whereas patients 
whose delirium had not resolved regained less than 
 
50% of their prehospital functional level.25 Patients in 
PAC settings with delirium exhibit a pattern of fluctu-
ating motor performance that is chronologically related 
to the onset and the end of delirium.26 
 
Incident delirium (ie, delirium that occurs during the 
course of admission) in LTC settings may be somewhat 
different in that it is not associated with decline in activi-

Another variation of the CAM was developed for nursing 
home patients and uses MDS data to predict delirium. 
However, this instrument needs clinical validation.34 
 
Incident delirium in LTC settings often presents dif-
ferently from delirium in the acute-care setting.35 The 
onset can be insidious and patients may have many pro-
dromal symptoms of subclinical delirium.18 In patients 
with delirium and behavioral and psychological symp-
toms of dementia, sleep changes were found to be the 
only reliable distinction between those with and those 
without delirium.36 More than half of patients with de-
lirium and dementia in PAC settings remembered being 
confused, and many reported a moderate level of distress 
related to the delirium episode.37
Prevention
A 2014 Cochrane review38 found limited evidence for 
the efficacy of delirium prevention methods. The re-
view did support medication review by consultation 
pharmacists and a computerized system to identify 
medications that may contribute to delirium risk. Using 
automated medication reviews can reduce the rate of 
delirium, though a clear reduction in hospitalization, 
falls, or mortality has yet to be reported.39 When LTC 
staff are educated about delirium, the total number of 
documented episodes increases because of greater 
awareness and recognition of delirium. In one study, 
educating home care staff led to more delirium cases 
being recognized but fewer total prescriptions being 
written over 6 months.40 Delirium abatement programs 
do show changes in staff attitude.41-43 Although these 
programs have had modest to no benefit in PAC set-
tings, they may have some benefit in hospital geriatric 
units.44 The cost savings of preventing delirium in hos-
pitalized LTC patients have been estimated to be 15%, 
mostly owing to shorter length of stay. Long-term care 
room characteristics can have an impact on patients’ 
behavior. When a clock or calendar (OR, 1.93) or tele-
phone (OR, 2.79) were absent from a patient’s room, he 
or she was more likely to have disruptive behavior and 
receive antipsychotic medication.45 Foltyn46 reported a 
case series in which oral pain and oral hygiene underlie 
some presentations of delirium and urged the inclusion 
of oral health and dentistry in LTC settings.
 
Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) opti-
mizes structure and function and enhances the body’s 
homeostatic mechanisms. Snider et al47 studied var-
ious outcomes, including delirium, in nursing home 
patients after preventive OMT vs a light-touch sham 
treatment was applied. No patients in either group 
developed delirium during the study, so the results 
were inconclusive.47 
Treatment
The causes of delirium are diverse, and no standard treat-
ment exists. Therefore, the osteopathic philosophy of 
understanding and addressing the cause of individual 
cases is especially important. Infection is the most 
common cause of delirium in elderly patients.5 Physi-
cians may want to rule out and manage urinary tract 
 
infections (UTIs) in patients with delirium. Because as-
ymptomatic bacteriuria is common in LTC patients, 
Nace et al48 recommended against performing urinalysis 
in LTC patients with isolated nonspecific signs or nonin-
fectious symptoms such as fatigue, foul-smelling or 
cloudy urine, or delirium. Evidence supports dysuria, 
high frequency, and lower abdominal pain as symptoms 
of a UTI.48 Observation and monitoring is recommended 
instead of antibiotics for patients who may have 
 
bacteriuria but do not clearly meet strict UTI criteria.48 
 
Antipsychotic medication is a commonly used treat-
ment for patients with delirium. A Cochrane review 
found evidence for using low-dose antipsychotic medica-
tion to decrease severity and duration of delirium in acute 
care.49 A review of antipsychotic treatment for hospital-
ized elderly patients with delirium concluded that atyp-
ical antipsychotic medications demonstrate similar rates 
of efficacy as haloperidol, with lower rates of extrapyra-
midal adverse effects.50 In 2008, the US Food and Drug 
Administration issued a black box warning of increased 
mortality from using antipsychotics in elderly patients 
with dementia.51 Hatta et al52 found that treating elderly

baseline is not known should be considered. In 2006, 
Inouye56 published a useful algorithm for managing de-
lirium in older persons. The 2008 American Medical 
Directors Association guidelines57 includes a decisional 
algorithm on delirium and acute problematic behavior 
specific to the LTC setting. Postacute care and LTC fa-
cilities must be prepared to conduct complete patient 
evaluations and treat patients with delirium in the fa-
cility. Nursing and administration staff must support and 
cooperate with these efforts because the interventions 
can be labor intensive.
Conclusion
Although delirium in PAC and LTC settings may share 
many properties with delirium in other settings, unique 
features such as insidious onset and incomplete resolu-
tion or long duration should be considered. The literature 
reviewed in this article contributes to the evidence base 
for the appropriate use of antipsychotics in PAC and LTC 
settings and clarifies some of the difficult, yet essential, 
clinical questions facing physicians. The recently imple-
mented penalties58 on hospitals for rehospitalizations 
from PAC and LTC settings may generate interest in 
studying delirium in PAC and LTC settings and whether 
a decrease in delirium may lead to decreased rehospital-
izations. No studies have been published that demon-
strate the effect of OMT on delirium incidence or course, 
to the authors’ knowledge. More research is needed to 
better understand delirium in the PAC and LTC setting.

hospitalized patients for delirium with antipsychotic 
medications did not result in increased mortality. Raivio 
et al53 also found that antipsychotic medications pre-
scribed for delirium- and dementia-related behaviors did 
not increase mortality in a Finnish nursing home popula-
tion. They concluded that these results may have been 
caused by the advanced age and frailty of their popula-
tion, in which the short-term mortality rate was already 
rather high.53 A large number of medications and a need 
for physical restraints predicted a 2-fold higher mortality 
rate over 2 years.53 Jung et al54 found that patients in PAC 
settings without objective evidence of delirium who re-
ceived antipsychotics had worse outcomes and an in-
creased rate of death. No clear benefit exists for managing 
presumed delirium with antipsychotic medications unless 
severe behavioral or psychiatric symptoms are present. 
Terminal delirium is considered irreversible, but manage-
ment should involve palliative care. Benzodiazepines are 
often used to provide relief for patients with terminal de-
lirium as well as for patients with delirium due to alcohol 
or benzodiazepine withdrawal; benzodiazepines should 
be avoided in other types of delirium. Postacute care and 
LTC regulations require antipsychotic medication use to 
be closely monitored and require active efforts to reduce 
and eliminate these medications. Antipsychotic use for 
patients with delirium should be temporary, and reduc-
tion after severe symptoms have resolved is recom-
mended. Antipsychotic use must be evidence based and 
well documented. 
 
Facilities are often understaffed and ill prepared for 
when a patient becomes acutely agitated. Timely psychi-
atric consultation is not always available, and the man-
agement usually falls on the attending physician or nurse 
practitioner. Patients who present with an acute change 
in mental status are often transferred to the ED for evalu-
ation. Arendts et al55 found that decisions to transfer pa-
tients from an LTC setting to an ED are often influenced 
by considerations beyond the expected benefit to the in-
dividual patient, such as inadequate facility resourcing 
and care planning. Although acute delirium should be 
seen as a medical emergency, the potential risks of trans-
porting a patient with delirium to the ED where their
