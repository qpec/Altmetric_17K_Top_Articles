interventions for marginalised and excluded populations

Inclusion health is a service, research, and policy agenda that aims to prevent and redress health and social inequities 
among the most vulnerable and excluded populations. We did an evidence synthesis of health and social interventions 
for inclusion health target populations, including people with experiences of homelessness, drug use, imprisonment, 
and sex work. These populations often have multiple overlapping risk factors and extreme levels of morbidity and 
mortality. We identified numerous interventions to improve physical and mental health, and substance use; however, 
evidence is scarce for structural interventions, including housing, employment, and legal support that can prevent 
exclusion and promote recovery. Dedicated resources and better collaboration with the affected populations are 
needed to realise the benefits of existing interventions. Research must inform the benefits of early intervention and 
implementation of policies to address the upstream causes of exclusion, such as adverse childhood experiences 
and poverty.
Introduction
Inclusion health is an emergent approach that aims to 
address extreme health and social inequities. Target 
populations have common adverse life experiences and 
risk factors such as poverty and childhood trauma that 
lead to social exclusion.1 Consequently, these populations 
have extremely poor health, multiple morbidity, and 
early mortality.2 Compounding these problems are 
numerous barriers to accessing health services.3 The key 
aims of the inclusion health agenda are to highlight the 
magnitude and consequences of extreme inequity, the 
need for preventive and early intervention approaches, 
and improved access to essential services for individuals 
harmed by exclusion.
An agreed conceptual framework for inclusion health 
has not yet been developed.2 In this Review, we employ 
existing 
social 
exclusion,4 
intersectionality,5,6 
and 
life-course epidemiology7 perspectives, which examine 
how factors accumulate and intersect over time and 
affect health. Risk factors such as substance use, rough 
sleeping, imprisonment, and exchanging sex for money 
or drugs are known to overlap among populations that 
are socially excluded1 and lead to extremely poor health 
outcomes.2 This underscores the need to better 
understand what interventions can effectively address 
and prevent the multiple and complex needs of socially 
excluded populations as a whole, rather than focusing on 
subpopulations defined by singular risk factors. Our 
Review aims to provide an overview of which individual 
and structural interventions are effective to tackle the 
extreme health needs of inclusion health target 
populations.
We defined the Review operationally using the 
populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes8 
method. Populations with histories of substance use 
disorders (excluding alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco), 
imprisonment, sex work, and homelessness in high-
income countries were identified as target populations 
on the basis of previous research in the UK, which 
showed a high degree of overlap between these groups1,6 
and the need to coordinate services for them.9 Other 
important excluded groups, such as migrants and 
transgender populations, were beyond the scope of this

Search strategy and selection criteria
We reviewed the systematic review literature to provide an overview of effective 
interventions that directly affect health (eg, pharmacology, counselling, screening, 
prevention) or the wider determinants of health (eg, housing, social support, training 
and education, employment, crime, and recidivism). This enabled summation of a 
broad literature base that would not have been feasible if we had reviewed primary 
studies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane 
Collaboration Library, and Web of Science for systematic reviews, with and without 
meta-analysis, of any intervention for inclusion health target populations in 
high-income countries published in English between Jan 1, 2005, and June 16, 2015. 
The search terms used for MEDLINE were as follows: (exp treatment outcome/ OR exp 
program evaluation/ OR exp outcome assessment (health care)/ OR exp randomized 
controlled trials) AND (exp substance abuse, intravenous/ OR exp substance related 
disorders/ OR exp vulnerable populations/ OR exp prisoners/ OR exp homeless persons/ 
OR exp sex workers/ OR exp drug users/ OR exp prostitution/) AND (systematic review.ti 
OR meta analysis.ti OR systematic review.ab OR meta analysis.ab); Limit Humans, 
2005—current (June 16, 2015). Full search terms are listed in the appendix. We also 
considered systematic reviews recommended by expert authors. SL screened the titles 
and abstracts using the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes (PICO) 
selection criteria: populations with histories of substance use disorders (excluding 
alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco), imprisonment, sex work, and homelessness in 
high-income countries; interventions that affect health or the social determinants of 
health; no comparators were specified; any health or social outcome was considered. 
We retained 272 relevant full-text articles which were divided equally among authors 
SL, NM, RWA, AH, AS, and NH to assess for inclusion. All articles that met the PICO 
criteria and reported on a unique intervention were included. For cases in which more 
than one review was available for a specific topic, we used the following hierarchy of 
evidence to select the review for inclusion: Cochrane review, systematic review with 
meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, systematic review without meta-analysis 
of randomised controlled trials, systematic review of observational studies only. In view 
of the breadth and diversity of interventions included in this Review, a narrative 
approach was selected as the most appropriate synthesis method.

Review. Full search terms are shown in the appendix. 
Additionally, we report a public engagement workshop 
that included people with experience of social exclusion, 
which aided the interpretation of the review findings 
(panel 1).
Effective inclusion health interventions
We identified 272 potentially relevant systematic 
reviews of interventions with an effect on health or 
the social determinants of health for people with 
experience of homelessness, substance use disorders, 
imprisonment, or sex work in high-income countries 
(figure 1). We included 77 systematic reviews in the 
final review, including 17 Cochrane reviews, 49 reviews 
that included one or more randomised controlled trials, 
and 11 reviews of exclusively observational research 
(table 1).
Men aged 30–49 years accounted for a high proportion 
of participants in many of the studies we reviewed and 
in the literature about homelessness, substance use 
disorders, and imprisonment more broadly.1 However, 
age-specific and sex-specific interventions might some-
times be more appropriate because the epidemiology of 
excluded men is likely to differ from that of women and 
young people78—eg, Aldridge and colleagues2 showed 
that women have higher standardised all-cause mortality 
ratios than men. We have therefore presented inter-
ventions specifically tailored to women and young 
people (<25 years) separately.
Pharmacological interventions
We identified pharmacological interventions for substance 
use disorders, dual diagnosis (mental illness and 
substance use disorders), and infectious diseases. 
Inclusion health target populations have an increased risk 
of tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV infection,2 for which 
effective pharmacotherapies are available. However, these 
individuals experience numerous barriers to treatment 
engagement and adherence. A systematic review18 of HIV 
treatment adherence measures for people with substance 
use disorders found that directly observed therapy, opioid 
replacement therapy (for opioid dependence), contingency 
management (vouchers or material incentives for 
adherence), and multicomponent interventions delivered 
by a nurse all improved therapy adherence and virological 
outcomes, but only for as long as the extra support 
continued. Similarly for tuberculosis, material incentives 
might improve short-term treatment adherence for people 
who are homeless, recently released from prison, or who 
use drugs, but more evidence is needed for long-term 
treatment 
compliance.17 
Evidence19 
suggests 
that 
stand-alone directly observed therapy is ineffective for 
improving tuberculosis treatment adherence among 
people with substance use disorders, but it can be an 
important component of broader case management 
interventions. Rates of treatment completion for hepatitis 
C infection are higher when opioid replacement therapy is 
provided concomitantly for people who inject drugs; 
outcomes are similar to trials done in the general 
population.20 Further studies on the risk of re-infection are 
needed to assess the long-term effectiveness of hepatitis C 
treatment in people who inject drugs.29 New short-course, 
direct-acting antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, with better 
efficacy, fewer contraindications, and more favourable 
side-effect profiles than traditional treatment regimens,32 
seem promising and might promote better treatment 
engagement and adherence. However, to date no 
systematic reviews assessing these new treatments in 
inclusion health target populations have been done.
Opioid replacement therapy is highly effective for 
individuals with substance use disorders who are 
dependent on heroin and other opioids. Treatments 
include 
methadone 
maintenance 
therapy10,21 
and 
buprenorphine maintenance therapy.11 However, meth-
adone maintenance programmes are better at retaining 
patients in treatment than buprenorphine maintenance 
programmes.11 Insufficient evidence exists to support 
widespread use of naltrexone for opioid dependency 
either orally,22 or by slow release injection.12 Detoxification 
is also unsupported as most patients relapse to opioid 
use after slow tapering of methadone13 or bupren-
orphine.23 Opioid replacement therapy is also beneficial 
for reducing illicit opioid use and risk behaviours 
in prison, and for reducing criminal activity.14,24 For 
deeply entrenched heroin-dependent patients who 
continue to use illicit heroin during standard opioid 
replacement therapy, meta-analyses25 of randomised 
Key messages
• 
People who are excluded from mainstream society, such as those experiencing 
homelessness, imprisonment, drug addiction, and sex work, have considerably higher 
rates of disease, injury, and premature mortality than the general population. Services 
need to tackle the so-called tri-morbidity of physical and mental illness, and addiction. 
Multiple evidence-based individual and structural interventions are available to 
prevent and address the excess burden of disease in these populations, but the need to 
translate and scale effective practice into action is crucial. Removal of barriers to access 
and uptake of services can be accelerated by involving people who have experience of 
social exclusion.
• 
Extreme exclusion is associated with frequent use of acute services, providing a strong 
economic case for preventive action, which complements the compelling social justice 
case. Research on routes into homelessness has revealed a high prevalence of childhood 
trauma, including exposure to abuse, neglect, domestic violence, and parental 
mental ill-health and substance use disorders. These adverse life experiences have a 
strong social gradient, such that the highest risks are found in low-income populations. 
The most effective upstream prevention policy is likely to be reduction of material 
poverty and deprivation, especially among families with children who are at high risk of 
maltreatment.
• 
Gaps in knowledge remain, particularly around interventions to improve upstream 
determinants of social inclusion, such as employment and education, which are also 
instrumental to long-term recovery from social exclusion. People who have 
experienced exclusion have identified appropriate housing as the most important 
intervention, and systematic reviews have established the effectiveness of this 
intervention for improving health and social outcomes.

controlled trials support the use of supervised injectable 
heroin, although this requires more intensive clinical 
super 
vision because of safety concerns. Opioid replace-
ment therapy has also been shown to reduce HIV 
transmission.30 For individuals in whom opioid replace-
ment therapy is disrupted because of brief incarceration, 
the risk of contracting hepatitis C is significantly 
in 
creased.24 Pharmacological treatment to reduce psycho-
stimulant dependency, such as cocaine or metham-
phetamine use, is ineffective.15,16,26,27
Mental illness and substance use disorders commonly 
co-occur. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are effective 
for people with schizophrenia and substance use disorders 
with improvements in psychopathology, relapse prevention, 
and rates of re-admission to hospital.28 A 2012 review31 has 
shown that individuals in prison with substance use 
disorders and mental health problems have a high risk of 
iatrogenic morbidity and mortality as a result of high 
dosing, polypharmacy, and other poor practices.
Psychosocial interventions
Literature on psychosocial interventions has primarily 
considered substance use disorders and mental health in 
the community and within the criminal justice system. 
The literature tends to support a multimodal approach,36 
but insufficient evidence exists to identify the most 
effective intervention. A 2013 Cochrane review33 of 
32 randomised controlled trials assessed psychosocial 
interventions to treat substance use disorders in people 
with severe mental illness. The authors reviewed long-
term integrated care, case management, cognitive 
behavioural therapy plus motivational interviewing, 
cognitive behavioural therapy alone, motivational 
interviewing alone, skills training, and contingency 
management (vouchers and material incentives). No 
intervention was found to be superior for treatment 
retention, substance use disorders, or mental health 
among people with severe mental illness. Overall, 
contingency management seems to be the most 
promising for promoting behavioural change for people 
who use cocaine and other psychostimulants.34,37–39 
Motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural 
therapy might also improve drug use and mental health 
outcomes when used in combination.34,40,41
Combined 
motivational 
interviewing, 
cognitive 
behavioural therapy, and contingency management have 
been shown to be effective for prevention of 
reincarceration when used in the context of therapeutic 
communities 
(an 
intense 
supportive 
residential 
intervention designed to isolate individuals from outside 
influences).35 Mindfulness meditation has been assessed 
in the context of substance use disorders in the 
community and in prison settings to improve mental 
wellbeing, but the evidence is inconclusive.42,43 Peer 
support interventions in criminal justice settings reduced 
risk behaviours44 and improved mental health, substance 
use disorders, and health service engagement.45
Case management
Case management aims to improve the coordination and 
delivery of health and social care services and can be most 
simply understood by its functions: assessment, planning, 
linking health and social services, monitoring, and 
advocacy.46 Evidence for the effectiveness of case 
management is broad, and interventions are hetero-
geneous. For substance use disorders, case management 
has been shown to improve links with services46 and 
treatment processes,49 but little evidence exists overall for a 
reduction in drug use and health-related outcomes.46,49 In 
homeless populations, case management was associated 
with improvements in mental health symptoms and 
substance use disorders compared with usual care.47 Case 
management 
with 
assertive 
community 
treatment 
(multidisciplinary team with low caseloads, community-
based services, and 24 h coverage) reduced homelessness, 
with a greater improvement in psychiatric symptoms 
compared with standard case management for the 
treatment of homeless people with severe mental illness.47,48
Disease prevention
Research on prevention of poor health outcomes largely 
consists of harm reduction interventions for people with 
substance use disorders, such as needle and syringe 
programmes, and screening and vaccination for blood-
borne viruses, which are more prevalent in inclusion 
health target populations than the general population.2 
The risk of HIV infection might be reduced by as much 
Panel 1: Engagement with people who have experienced social exclusion
We held a public engagement workshop on Sept 17, 2015, at University College London 
(London, UK), to involve people with experience of social exclusion and marginalisation 
as co-researchers in the interpretation and writing up of this Review. To identify and 
access people to participate, we worked with Groundswell, which is a charity that enables 
people who are homeless and vulnerable to take more control of their lives, have a greater 
influence on health and social care services, and to be more involved in our community. 
The workshop included 16 individuals with experiences of social exclusion, such as 
homelessness, addiction, or incarceration, who volunteer as homeless health peer 
advocates with Groundswell, four academic researchers, two service providers, and 
two non-participant observers who documented the workshop. Lunch and refreshments 
were provided and a £20 voucher was offered to the volunteer peer advocates at the end 
of the day (ie, it was not an incentive to attend). We developed a range of activities that 
involved all participants as equals to explore the following five objectives:
• 
To increase understanding about the meaning of the term inclusion health
• 
To increase awareness of health statistics for inclusion health target populations and 
to examine views about data collection and surveillance to improve the health of 
these groups
• 
To share positive stories about using health and other services to identify common 
themes that are beneficial for improving health
• 
To understand which interventions are most important to people with experience of 
social exclusion and to compare these against the set of interventions identified in our 
literature review
• 
To identify key stakeholders that can make a difference to the health of inclusion 
health target populations

Opioid overdose prevention programmes involve 
training people with substance use disorders and their 
contacts to recognise overdose and administer naloxone 
to reverse the effects of opioids. Studies have reported 
85–100% survival after naloxone administration for 
overdose, and areas with high uptake of opioid overdose 
prevention programmes have fewer heroin overdose-
related deaths.55 Supervised injecting sites—where 
trained medical personnel provide harm reduction 
equipment and supervise drug consumption—have also 
been shown to reduce overdose deaths and ambulance 
call-outs and decrease unsafely discarded needles, public 
injecting, and needle sharing. Supervised injecting sites 
are not associated with increases in crime, or the number 
of people injecting drugs.56
Targeted screening in primary care, training of primary 
care practitioners, use of dried blood spot testing, and 
outreach all improve uptake of hepatitis C virus testing.57 
HIV risk reduction interventions, including screening 
programmes, psychosocial interventions, and opioid 
replacement therapy, increase testing uptake for HIV and 
decrease high-risk sexual and injecting behaviours among 
people in contact with the criminal justice system.52 
Hepatitis B vaccination effectively prevents infections 
when delivered in prisons.45 Chest x-ray screening is a 
good tool for the identification of individuals with active 
tuberculosis among homeless populations.53
Housing and social determinants
Housing First is a well established intervention developed 
for people who are homeless with mental health and 
substance use problems.58 By contrast to treatment first 
models (ie, usual care), Housing First provides indi 
viduals 
with housing and subsequently attempts to engage 
them in mental health services, substance dependency 
treatment, and other services. A systematic review58 of 
randomised controlled trials of this intervention in the 
USA, Canada, and Europe signifi 
cantly improved stable 
housing status and quality of life, and reduced contacts 
with the criminal justice system. However, evidence was 
mixed for improving mental health, substance use, and 
community functioning outcomes compared with usual 
treatment. Another review59 of housing interventions 
(including Housing First and other models) found that 
provision of housing improved sustained housing after 
hospital discharge, decreased substance use and relapses 
from periods of substance abstinence, decreased health 
services use, increased housing tenure, and improved 
health outcomes of homeless populations with HIV.
Occupational therapy might help to increase education, 
employment, and life skills among people experiencing 
homelessness.60 The Individual Placement Scheme 
model of supported employment in ordinary workplaces 
was positively evaluated in a 2013 Cochrane review61 for 
people with severe and enduring mental health problems,

and might also be beneficial for inclusion health target 
populations more broadly.
Other interventions
Respite care (ie, short-term recuperative care for homeless 
individuals after hospital discharge) can reduce the number 
of future hospital admissions and use of emer 
gency 
departments in homeless populations.62 Interventions 
del 
ivered via computers, mobile phone apps, and the 
internet provide promising alternative health-care delivery 
models, and a systematic review63 of computer-based 
interventions for substance use disorders found that some 
measures of substance use were improved along with 
increased moti 
vation for behavioural change. Physical 
exercise inter 
ventions can improve outcomes among 
people with substance use disorders, including significant 
increases in abstinence rates and improvements in 
withdrawal symp 
toms, anxiety, and depression.64 Comple-
mentary and alter 
native therapies, such as acupuncture,65 
Chinese herbal medicine,66 and yoga,67 also show potential

improve 
ments in outcomes for substance use disorders, 
but studies were heterogeneous and of varying quality; 
thus, estab 
lishing overall conclusions about effectiveness is 
difficult. Obser 
vational studies have found potentially 
positive eff
 ects of religion and spirituality on substance use 
disorders re 
covery, but little evidence is available from 
randomised trials, and most of the data published 
previously is of low methodological quality.68
Interventions tailored to women
Systematic reviews on tailored interventions for women 
focused on psychosocial therapies, case management or 
integrated programmes, and advocacy and empowerment. 
Interventions were rarely delivered in isolation, and 
pharmacological treatments, particularly for substance 
use disorders, were also described.
Educational interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy, 
and motivational interviewing improved psychological, 
behavioural, and cognitive outcomes among women who 
are homeless.71 For women in criminal justice settings, a 
range of psychological therapies reduced depression and 
trauma, but not global assessments of mental health.78 
Psychosocial interventions improved mental health and 
social outcomes and decreased recurrent physical abuse 
among women seeking shelter from a violent intimate 
partner.72 However, two Cochrane reviews69,70 found 
psychosocial therapies to be as effective as standard 
comprehensive care for reducing re-arrest rates and drug 
use among female offenders and for improving treatment 
outcomes and birth outcomes for pregnant women in 
outpatient drug treatment programmes.
Therapeutic communities—an intense supportive 
residential intervention designed to isolate individuals 
from outside influences—seem to be effective for 
reducing re-incarceration and re-arrest rates,69 preventing 
women from returning to drugs or a violent sexual 
partner, motivating women to make positive changes, and 
improving psychological wellbeing.71 This intervention 
recognises trauma as an important aspect of recovery and 
uses a gender-specific and whole-person approach.69 
Therapeutic communities have been most commonly 
used in drug rehabilitation, low-risk prison populations, 
and for women seeking shelter from intimate partner 
violence and are important for retaining women in 
treatment, for isolating and sheltering them from outside 
influences, and as a means to retain custody of children.71
Case management also seems beneficial for women, 
particularly when motherhood services are incorporated.73

Additional studies that did not meet inclusion criteria for our systematic review have been included to express certain points from the literature that could not be represented 
by the review papers. *These studies on young (≤25 years) inclusion health populations do not readily fit into subpopulation categories for adult inclusion health populations 
and have been classified here on the basis of the outcomes reported—eg, street-connected children,80,85 children in foster care,83 and looked-after children88 might transiently 
use substances, be unstably housed, and engage in criminal activity and risky sexual behaviours and would be at very high risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, 
imprisonment, and sex work (thus justifying their inclusion in this Review), although it would be inappropriate to classify them as homeless individuals, prisoners, sex 
workers, or individuals with substance use disorder.

Five 
systematic 
reviews73–77 
have 
been 
published 
examining the effectiveness of integrated programmes 
that include on-site pregnancy, parenting, or child-related 
services alongside substance use disorders services. 
Results from meta-analyses suggest that integrated 
programmes have an advantage when compared with 
non-integrated programmes for the improvement of 
maternal mental health,73 and are effective in reducing 
maternal substance use disorders, but less so than 
non-integrated programmes.74 Furthermore, integrated 
programmes might have a small advantage compared 
with non-integrated programmes on length of stay, but 
not in substance use disorders treatment completion;75 
they might also improve parenting skills76 and sig-
nificantly improve child outcomes with a small advantage 
when compared with non-integrated pro 
grammes 
overall.77 By contrast, Perry and colleagues69 found that 
among female offenders, case management (characterised 
by reduced caseloads, specialised probation officer 
training, and efforts to increase contact between probation 
officer and probationer) did not reduce self-reported drug 
use or re-arrest rates compared with standard parole, 
although re-incarceration rates were reduced.
Research on intense advocacy interventions for women 
who are homeless in the USA and UK has shown 
reductions in psychological distress, health-care use, and 
drug and alcohol use, and improvements in self-esteem.71 
In our Review, we did not find any systematic reviews 
that assessed individual or structural interventions for 
sex workers in high-income countries. One systematic 
review and meta-analysis79 of HIV prevention among 
establishment-based 
and 
non-establishment-based 
female sex workers in low-income and middle-income 
countries 
found 
that 
community 
empowerment 
interventions resulted in a significant decrease in the 
prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted 
infections and a significant increase in prevalence of 
condom use with both regular and new clients. These 
approaches warrant further investigation in high-income 
settings.
Interventions tailored to young people
Little evidence exists for the effectiveness of tailored 
interventions that address the broad needs of socially 
excluded young people (eg, trust, subsistence, living skills, 
family or peer support, and safety).84 A 2016 Cochrane 
review80 examined a range of interventions compared with 
standard care for street-connected children and young 
people (children who work or sleep, or both, on the streets 
and might not necessarily be adequately supervised or 
directed by responsible adults). The interventions 
included 
brief 
motivational 
interviewing, 
case 
management, group-based interventions (sex-specific), 
family interventions, community reinforcement, HIV 
treatment, and a psychosocial mental health intervention. 
The primary outcomes of the review—inclusion and re-
integration—were not measured in any of the reviewed 
studies, and no consistent results were found within the 
domains of psychosocial health, substance use disorders, 
and high-risk sexual behaviour. The authors did a 
subsequent systematic review and found that length or 
quality of service engagement did not account for the 
absence of a significant difference between interventions 
developed specifically for street-connected young people 
(<24 years) and standard services. The authors noted that 
by contrast, qualitative research findings consistently 
emphasise that young people appreciate engagement-
related aspects of interventions, such as safe environments 
and caring relationships, indicating their value irrespective 
of other outcomes.85
Although conclusive evidence is scarce, potentially 
promising results have been reported for family-based 
therapy,86 cognitive behavioural therapy,84 and brief 
interventions87 for a range of outcomes for young people. 
Foster care might help to reduce criminal activity and 
improve mental health outcomes for children in care;83 
however, no evidence-based transition support services 
are available for looked-after young people coming 
towards the end of care.88 Detoxification81 and opioid 
replacement therapy82 for opioid dependency have been 
investigated in adolescents, but results were inconclusive. 
The authors note that the paucity of evidence might be a 
result of the practical and ethical difficulties of trials that 
involve young people.
Putting the findings in context: views of experts 
by experience
People with experience of social exclusion, such as 
homelessness, addiction, or incarceration—known as 
experts by experience—collaborated on this paper through 
an engagement workshop with the research team to 
contextualise the review findings (panel 1). We explored 
inclusion health as a concept and discussed characteristics 
of target populations, barriers that lead to exclusion, and 
values and actions that promote inclusion (figure 2). 
Health statistics on target populations (as described by 
Aldridge and colleagues2) were discussed and informed 
conversations about why research was needed, data 
collection methods (new data vs collation of administrative 
data), consent, anonymisation, data security, and the so-
called surveillence society. Overall, participants expressed 
positive attitudes towards enhancing research to improve 
services, including the use of linked electronic service 
records. Stakeholder analysis identified local governments, 
policy makers, health-care organisations, and the media 
as the most important groups for influencing the inclusion 
health agenda. The most important interventions, 
research gaps in the review findings, and the characteristics 
of inclusive services were also discussed. We formulated 
recommendations for practice and research according to 
the views expressed in the workshop and review findings 
(panel 2).
Workshop participants listed and categorised the 
interventions they felt were most important and then

ranked these interventions alongside those identified in 
the literature review (table 2). Housing was ranked as 
the single most important intervention. Several gaps in 
the systematic review evidence were highlighted. 
Relatively few reviews of interventions to modify social 
determinants of health (housing, law, training and 
education, and employment) and advocacy interventions 
(especially peer-led interventions across health settings) 
were identified, despite these being the most valued 
interventions. Furthermore, no reviews of specialist

models of care (primary care, secondary care, and dental 
care) were found.
The engagement workshop also highlighted barriers 
and facilitators to receiving acceptable and inclusive 
services. Participants said that it was often good fortune 
or luck that enabled them to access a needed service 
and they highlighted the need to abolish restrictive 
requirements, such as proof of address or proof 
of receipt of state benefits, to access services. They 
also emphasised the need to reduce language, 
communication, and cultural barriers as well as fear, 
poor awareness, and judgmental attitudes of service 
providers. Participants felt that the media should be 
encouraged to promote positive messages about people 
experiencing exclusion to reduce stigma and stereo-
typing, which were perceived as barriers to accessing 
effective interventions.
Service user involvement and active engagement were 
highlighted as key factors to promote positive service 
experiences. Participants in the workshop said that 
“health care is a right and everyone should have a voice”. 
Coordination of care to help meet needs outside 
traditional health services, such as housing, welfare 
support, and legal aid, were also seen as ways to enable 
people to take control and responsibility for themselves 
and their health. As volunteer peer health advocates, 
participants also talked about the benefits of peer worker 
programmes for themselves and the clients they support 
to access health care. To make services effective and 
inclusive, participants expressed that this often involves 
“going above the call of duty” and “meeting people 
where they’re at”. These opinions indicate that working 
with inclusion health target populations requires active 
engagement and might necessitate service providers 
going beyond what might be expected from their role. 
The following were key principles of services that were 
valued by participants: provide ample time and patience 
to really listen; strive to develop trust and acceptance; 
provide supportive, unbiased, open, honest, and 
transparent services in inclusive spaces and places; 
encourage clients to accept personal responsibility for 
health; allow clients to take ownership, have choices, 
and participate in decisions; and above all, promote 
accessibility, fairness, and equality.
Service planning implications
This Review identified several interventions that have 
been reported to be effective for socially excluded 
populations (panel 3). Most of the research has been 
done in the USA. Interventions with the strongest 
evidence base aimed to address substance use disorders 
and harm reduction and, to a lesser extent, mental 
health and infectious diseases. Several overlapping 
themes of effective interventions emerged, including 
individual care coordination of multicomponent inter-
ventions, active engagement, service user involvement, 
low-barrier access, and service provider values and

training. Practical recommendations for service pro-
viders based on these themes and views expressed in 
the workshop are provided in panel 2.
Generally, we found multicomponent interventions 
for inclusion health target populations had higher 
effectiveness than stand-alone interventions.18,47,48,50 Most of 
Panel 2: Recommendations for practice, policy, and research
Practice
• 
Multicomponent interventions with coordinated care are 
most effective and should include both health and non-
health services. Partnership working and service design 
around the whole person is necessary to achieve the 
best results.
• 
Service user involvement is essential to ensure equity, 
acceptability, and relevance of services and should be 
standard practice. Peer worker programmes are an 
acceptable and effective method to involve service users.
• 
Working with inclusion health target populations requires 
active engagement and might necessitate service providers 
going beyond what might be expected from their role. 
Trained community nurses and peer workers might be best 
suited for outreach and engagement. In view of the 
effectiveness of motivational interviewing, engagement 
should be psychologically informed.
• Barriers to accessing services, such as communication 
problems, bureaucracy, or stigma, should be addressed 
through ongoing staff training, technical assistance, and 
monitoring of adherence to protocols. Additionally, the 
media should be encouraged to promote more positive 
messages to the public about people experiencing 
exclusion.
• 
Providers and decision makers should be sensitised to the 
realities, needs, and rights of excluded people and efforts 
should be made to deliver high-quality comprehensive 
services in the community and on the streets, as well as in 
institutional settings such as prisons.
• 
When assessing health and wellbeing, use measurements 
that provide objective outcome evaluation but are also 
meaningful to the client group. Involvement of service users 
can help to develop appropriate measures.
• 
The values that should underpin services—expressed by people 
with experience of exclusion—include providing ample time 
and patience to really listen, striving to develop trust and 
acceptance, providing supportive, unbiased, open, honest, and 
transparent services in inclusive spaces and places, encouraging 
clients to accept personal responsibility for health, allowing 
clients to take ownership and participate in decisions, and 
above all, promote accessibility, fairness, and equality for all.
• 
Improved recording and sharing of data is required to 
support service planning, policy, and research.
Policy
• 
The most effective methods of preventing the adverse life 
experiences and disadvantages experienced by socially 
excluded populations is to reduce material poverty and 
deprivation, especially among families with children that are 
at high risk of maltreatment.
• 
Within proportionate universalist priority-setting 
frameworks (whereby actions to reduce inequalities are 
population-wide, but the amount of investment is 
proportionate to the level of disadvantage), excluded 
groups should be highly prioritised, reflecting the intensity 
of their needs and exceptionally poor outcomes.
• 
National and local social and health policies for assisting 
inclusion health target populations should be based on 
personalisation and deinstitutionalisation.
• 
The provision of suitable and stable housing in ordinary 
community settings should be an overriding policy 
objective in strategies that address social exclusion.
Research
• 
Development of interventions, with consideration of the 
proposed recommendations for practice, is needed across 
the spectrum of health needs described by Aldridge and 
colleagues.2
• 
Intervention development is also needed to modify the 
social determinants of health, such as housing, law, training 
and education, and employment.
• 
Peer support is a promising intervention to increase 
advocacy and improve outcomes across multiple domains of 
health. More research is needed to understand the effect of 
peer-led interventions for peer workers and their clients, 
their cost-effectiveness, and how peer interventions can be 
used in other settings.
• 
Research on specialist and mainstream models of care 
(primary care, secondary care, and preventive care, 
including dental care) is needed to understand how best to 
provide services for excluded groups at a population level.
• 
Research and services mainly focus on immediate health 
needs and little evidence exists on how to prevent health 
and social problems and promote reintegration and 
recovery after social exclusion.
• 
Research is needed on the mechanisms of behavioural 
change as well as outcomes because little is known about 
methods of change that promote (or inhibit) engagement 
with and adherence to interventions.
• 
Research is needed on socially excluded women, and 
female, male, and transgender sex workers for whom there 
were no systematic reviews of effective interventions in 
high-income countries.
• 
Research on how to support excluded young people 
(<25 years) is also urgently needed, and particularly, how to 
support individuals who are transitioning from the 
children’s care system to adult services.
• 
Research using routine electronic service data, ideally with 
linked datasets, can be used to answer some of these questions.

these multimodal approaches involved individual care 
coordination or case management with multidisciplinary 
teams. Examples of this approach include integrated 
mental health and drug treatment33 and integrated 
programmes for women that include on-site pregnancy, 
parenting, or child-related services alongside substance 
use disorder services.73 Delivering effective coordinated 
care requires high-level partnership working across 
settings to permit cross-location interventions and to 
ensure longer-term continuity of care.78
Active engagement involves using a non-judgmental 
approach, ensuring confidentiality, providing a supportive 
interpersonal environment,85 creating safe communal 
spaces, and identifying common priorities, needs, and 
goals79 and should be considered best practice in inclusion 
health. Peer workers44,89 and community nurses71 with 
specialised training might be particularly well placed to act 
as outreach and inreach personnel to actively engage 
people and to advocate on their behalf. Active engagement 
might be particularly important for young people 
(<25 years)—eg, mobile vans providing needle and syringe 
programmes often attract younger intravenous drug 
users.51 Involvement of service users is also important to 
reduce inequities in access to services. Community 
empowerment, supporting service-user led organisations, 
and peer advocacy are effective ways to involve inclusion 
health target populations.79 A growing evidence base44,89 
shows that peer support programmes have positive effects 
on both peer workers and individuals supported by them.
Health-care providers, police, and social services need to 
be aware of the realities, needs, and rights of people 
experiencing exclusion.79 The provision of context-specific 
services requires ongoing staff training, technical 
assistance, and monitoring of adherence to protocols.69 
Other studies78 highlight the importance of delivering 
interventions in the community that cater holistically to 
the needs of target populations rather than only providing 
services in institutions such as hospitals or prisons.78 
Assessment measures are required that meaningfully 
reflect individuals’ own sense of health and wellbeing, as 
well as providing objective outcome evaluation.78
Specialised models of care, which aim to exemplify all of 
these overlapping themes, are highly promising but have 
yet to be systematically reviewed. Specialist care 
coordination for homeless people admitted to hospital—
the Pathway model90,91—is being adopted by hospitals 
across the UK and internationally. Another approach is 
Street Medicine, a fully integrated homeless health-care 
and advocacy model involving mobile outreach teams that 
originated in the USA, which is also expanding 
internationally.92
More evidence is needed for targeted interventions 
across the full spectrum of health problems experienced 
by inclusion health target populations,2 particularly for 
problems that could be improved through more 
equitable access to prevention and early intervention, 
such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Evidence for 
effective tobacco cessation interventions might be 
particularly beneficial in this regard. Little evidence is 
available for interventions that affect upstream 
determinants of poor health, such as employment and 
education. No specific interventions for female sex 
workers in high-income countries were identified in 
our Review or workshop, although sex-specific 
interventions were identified for excluded women. 
These interventions are also likely to benefit sex 
workers because research has highlighted a high degree 
of overlap between sex work and other exclusion risk 
factors, such as drug use and homelessness.1 Definitive 
evidence is scarce for young people who are socially 
excluded. Recommendations for future research are 
summarised in panel 2.
Policy implications
Coordinated policies at the national and local level are 
required to address the material and the health needs of 
inclusion health target populations,1 consistent with a 
so-called whole-of-society approach to addressing 
health inequities and the reversal of exclusionary 
processes.93 Research on routes into homelessness has 
revealed that childhood trauma is common, including 
exposure to abuse, neglect, domestic violence, and 
parental mental ill-health and substance use disorders.1

A life-course approach that recognises the effect of this 
accumulation of disadvantages from an early age is 
therefore warranted.93
Although inclusion health target populations account 
for a small proportion of the population in high-income 
countries, they have a considerably worse quality of life 
Panel 3: Effective interventions for inclusion health populations
Pharmacological interventions
• 
Methadone and buprenorphine are effective for treating 
opioid dependency; however, methadone is more effective 
at retaining people in treatment. Supervised injectable 
heroin might also be indicated for people refractory to 
standard treatment. No other effective treatments for 
substance use disorders were identified.
• 
Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are effective for people 
with schizophrenia and substance use disorders.
• 
Hepatitis C treatment is as effective among people who inject 
drugs as the general population. Retention in treatment is 
improved when treatment of substance use disorders is 
provided simultaneously. New short-term antiviral drugs are 
highly promising for inclusion health target populations.
• 
HIV treatment outcomes are improved by directly observed 
therapy, medication assisted therapy, contingency 
management, and multicomponent nurse-delivered 
interventions.
• 
Adherence to tuberculosis treatment is improved in the short 
term by incentives, but stand-alone directly observed therapy 
is ineffective without case management.
Psychosocial interventions
• 
Psychosocial interventions are most effective when provided 
in combination, although no clear evidence indicates the 
optimum intervention.
• 
Contingency management (ie, vouchers or incentives), 
motivational interviewing, and cognitive behavioural therapy 
have shown some benefits for substance use disorders and in 
therapeutic communities for reincarceration.
• 
Mental health and drug treatment services might be more 
effective when provided in an integrated setting.
Case management
• 
Case management can improve and enhance links with 
services and improve mental health symptoms. Evidence is 
mixed about whether this approach improves outcomes in 
substance use disorders and other health-related outcomes.
• 
When used with assertive community treatment, case 
management might also help to reduce homelessness.
Disease prevention
• 
Harm reduction schemes, including needle and syringe 
programmes, substitution programmes, and safe injecting site 
programmes can reduce risk behaviour, risk of blood-borne 
viruses, and overdose risk. Generally, multicomponent 
interventions are more effective than stand-alone 
interventions. Interventions in community and criminal justice 
settings are effective and outreaching interventions can reach 
younger users and individuals with greater risk-taking 
behaviours. Training drug users to recognise opiate overdose 
and administer naloxone can reduce risk of fatal overdose.
• 
Uptake of screening for hepatitis C can be increased through 
targeted screening in primary care, use of dried blood spots 
instead of venous blood samples, and outreach.
• 
In criminal justice settings, HIV risk reduction interventions 
and hepatitis B vaccination are beneficial.
Housing and social determinants
• 
Provision of housing improves a range of health and social 
outcomes for homeless populations, particularly among 
those experiencing mental illness and substance use 
disorders.
• 
Occupational therapy might increase education, 
employment, and life skills among homeless populations.
• 
Supported work placements, which are effective for 
individuals with severe, long-term mental illness, might also 
help other socially excluded populations to secure 
employment.
Other interventions
• 
Medical respite can reduce the number of future hospital 
admissions and use of emergency departments in homeless 
populations.
• 
Computer-based interventions and physical exercise 
interventions might improve outcomes for substance use 
disorders. Complementary and alternative therapies and 
spirituality or religion might also have potentially positive 
effects, but more rigorous evidence is needed.
Women
• 
A variety of sex-sensitive interventions can improve the 
health and social outcomes of women, including 
structured counselling and social support, therapeutic 
communities, case management and integrated 
programmes, and advocacy and empowerment.
• 
Effective interventions for excluded women address the role 
of motherhood, trauma and violence, substance use 
disorders, and education and empowerment as key aspects 
for recovery.
• Interventions can be delivered in community and 
institutional settings to support women.
Young people (<25 years)
• 
Generally, evidence about young people who are excluded is 
scarce, but potentially promising results have been reported 
for family-based therapy, cognitive behavioural 
interventions, and brief interventions for a range of 
outcomes.
• Foster care might help to reduce criminal activity and 
improve mental health; however, no evidence-based 
transition support services are available for looked-after 
young people approaching the end of care.

than other disadvantaged groups.5 These populations also 
have much poorer health behaviours and outcomes, 
which can cause substantial harm to children—eg, 
substance use disorders.94 In the context of inadequate 
investment in preventive services and interventions, 
inclusion health target populations frequently require 
costly acute services,5 providing a strong economic case 
for action to complement the compelling social justice 
case.95 Within proportionate universalist priority-setting 
frameworks (in which actions to reduce inequalities are 
population-wide, but the amount of investment is pro-
portionate to the level of disadvantage),95 inclusion health 
target populations should be prioritised, reflecting the 
intensity of their needs and exceptionally poor health and 
social outcomes.
National and local policies should encapsulate the 
principles of good practice, including personalisation 
(defined as open-ended, persistent, flexible, and 
coordinated support),9 and also deinstitutionalisation 
(such that people have the option of staying in ordinary 
housing with the support that they need rather than 
being obliged to spend a period in hostels, refuges, or 
other congregate settings if that is not their wish).96,97 
Housing First is a an evidence-based model consistent 
with these principles.58 Whole person98 and, in appro-
priate cases, whole family99 strengths-based health and 
social policies (in which individuals’ strengths and 
abilities are emphasised) might also be beneficial to help 
inclusion health target populations recover from the 
multiple issues they experience.
Policy should recognise the root causes of exclusion in 
the structural disadvantages experienced by people, 
households, and communities living in persistent or 
recurrent poverty.5 Health inequalities result from social 
inequalities,95 with the worst effects on people who 
experience the most extreme forms of material 
deprivation. Evidence from high-income countries 
indicates that the highest risks of homelessness,100 
persistent offending,101 and the most damaging drug 
problems,102 as well as their common childhood 
antecedents in abuse and neglect,103 parental mental ill-
health,104,105 and domestic violence,106 are concentrated 
within low-income populations. The direction of 
causation between poverty and these adverse life 
experiences is sometimes obscured, and is very often 
bidirectional. However, in the UK, the underlying power 
of the structural drivers is revealed by spatial patterns 
that show high proportions of offenders, individuals with 
substance use disorders, and homeless people in areas of 
long-term economic decline and entrenched poverty.5 
Economic modelling in the UK has estimated that 
two-thirds of all child protection service costs might be 
attributed to poverty effects,107,108 and evidence from 
experimental and quasi-experimental studies109,110 in the 
USA indicate that raising the income of families in 
poverty had a beneficial effect in reducing child 
maltreatment. Therefore, the most effective upstream 
prevention policy is likely to be reduction of material 
poverty and deprivation among families with children 
who are at high risk of maltreatment.108
Conclusion
This Review identified a wide range of interventions 
for inclusion health target populations. The focus on 
systematic reviews enabled identification of interventions 
for which a body of evidence existed, but this approach 
will have excluded effective interventions that have not yet 
been the subject of such reviews. Strong evidence exists 
for the effectiveness of some interventions, particularly in 
the area of drug treatment and harm reduction, whereas 
the evidence in other areas is generally of lower 
methodological quality. This disparity might reflect the 
pragmatic nature of many intervention studies, difficulties 
in randomising complex interventions, and restrictions in 
available funding. Nevertheless, the Review found a broad 
array of important opportunities to improve health 
through adequately funded services delivering individual 
and structural interventions on the basis of the best 
available current evidence. Upstream policy measures to 
reduce material poverty and deprivation are also needed 
to prevent extreme social and health inequalities 
from occurring in the first place. The views of people 
with experience of social exclusion and the delivery 
characteristics of the interventions identified across the 
literature can be used to guide practitioners to en-
sure services are not only effective, but also inclusive 
and equitable.
