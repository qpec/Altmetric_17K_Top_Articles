Abstract
Background: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden and is projected to be the second
leading cause of disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US $210.5 billion, with
employers bearing over 50% of these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression
never receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated through new
channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care.
Objective: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker
users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge
of depression, and functioning in the workplace.
Methods: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate
depression. Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and with outreach
through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned
within each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting
of links to vetted websites on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment surveys at baseline,
6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3)
negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization,
all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current
suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms.
Results: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge,
work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on depression symptoms, work
productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these
outcome measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0
times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on
work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up.
Conclusions: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression
symptoms (partial eta2 = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access to relevant
depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta2 = .093). For all users,
the MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating factors of behavioral
activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week follow-up
for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts
to maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be

 appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker
users with guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person support.

Introduction
Background
Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental
conditions to afflict adults in the United States, with estimates
in the United States for major depression of 16.6% for lifetime
occurrence and 6.7% for a 1-year period [1,2]. Worldwide,
depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden,
and the World Health Organization projects that by 2020
depression will rank as the second leading cause of disability
[3,4]. The prevalence of mild-to-moderate or subclinical
depression is equal to, or greater than, major depressive disorder,
with lifetime rates up to 26% and annual prevalence of 5-10%
[5,6]. Subclinical depression is associated with substantial
functional impairment, including poor work performance [3,7-9].
Further, subclinical depression is associated with a two- to
five-fold increased risk of full-syndrome depressive disorders
[10-13].
Based on data from 2010, depression-related costs in the United
States exceeded US $210.5 billion, with employers incurring
US $102 billion in losses due to presenteeism (US $78.7 billion),
absenteeism (US $23.3 billion), and disability, and another US
$98.9 billion incurred as direct medical costs [14]. Each year,
US employers lose approximately 32 workdays per depressed
employee to presenteeism [14]. Approximately 40% of direct
medical costs are due to major depressive disorder, 10-11% are
due to other depressive conditions, and roughly half of costs
(48-51%) are due to comorbid physical or psychiatric conditions,
such as pain and sleep disorders [14]. In addition, the economic
costs of subclinical depression are considerable, approximately
two-thirds the per capita costs of major depression [15-18].
Because most adults who suffer from depression never receive
treatment [19], there is a need to develop interventions that can
be more widely disseminated, such as through channels like
employee assistance programs (EAPs) and directly to individuals
who will not seek face-to-face care. Interventions that reduce
the performance-impairing symptoms of subclinical depression
and prevent the onset of major depression can improve employee
well-being, while reducing health care costs and improving
productivity [20]. EAPs offer services specifically designed to
improve and/or maintain workplace productivity, including
individual mental and behavioral health services offered to
employees and family members experiencing personal
difficulties, 
like 
depression. 
With 
wide 
reach 
into
medium-to-large US employers and rapidly growing reach
worldwide, EAPs offer a meaningful channel for delivering
effective interventions as part of a larger population health
management strategy.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression
The Coping with Depression (CWD) cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) skills-training program [21,22] is based on
behavioral [23,24] as well as cognitive formulations of
depression [25-27]. The CWD skills-training program combines
cognitive and behavioral strategies aimed at ameliorating
problems common to depressed individuals (eg, pessimism;
internal, global, and stable attributions for failure; low
self-esteem; low engagement in pleasant activities; poor social
skills; anxiety and tension; low social support; and increased
conflict) with a focus on awareness of specific and current
actions and cognitions as targets for change. CWD-based
interventions are based on the premise that activating a variety
of coping skills and strategies allows depressed individuals to
effectively address the diverse personal and environmental
triggers that underlie their depressive symptoms.
The CWD approach has been validated for use with a variety
of age, gender, and race/ethnic groups and using a variety of
delivery methods, including as a guided self-help intervention
[28]. Based on a meta-analysis of 18 CWD-based intervention
studies, the approach has been associated with clinically
significant effects ranging from d=0.28 to 0.62, depending on
the outcome measure used [28]. In trials that targeted adults
with subthreshold depression, CWD participants were 38% less
likely to escalate to full-syndrome depression [28].
Positive Psychology Interventions for Depression
Cognitive and behavioral approaches to mood have evolved
from a focus on treating disorders to including an emphasis on
promoting positive emotion and experiences. Positive
psychology interventions (PPIs), such as mindful self-awareness,
gratitude expression, and identifying and utilizing strengths,
have been shown to impact both well-being and depressive
symptoms [29-31]. Mindfulness and acceptance are increasingly
integrated in CBT approaches to depression self-management,
drawing attention to both increasing positive cognitions and
experiences, and accepting or releasing negative cognitions.
Mindfulness-based interventions are particularly effective for
managing stressors and enhancing positive emotions, resulting
in psychological and social benefits and reducing depression
symptoms [31-35]. PPIs that focus on building conscious
awareness and expression of gratitude increase positive emotion
and yield a wide variety of physical and affective benefits
[31,36-38]. Identifying and using one’s strengths has been shown
to have robust emotional effects, and setting strength-based

 goals and plans has been shown to increase optimism and reduce
depression, with long-lasting effects [31,39-41].
Web and Mobile Delivery of Depression Interventions:
Efficacy
Internet-delivered CBT-based programs for depression symptom
management have been shown to be effective both for adults
with major depressive disorder and those with elevated, but
subthreshold, depression symptoms, although one recent review
identified concerns with dropout and lack of long-term effects
[42-45]. Traditional computer- and Internet-based CBT
programs typically involve four to 12 lessons or modules
delivered in sequence, either weekly or self-paced [43,46]. Effect
sizes have been estimated at d=0.44-1.90 for clinician-supported,
and d=0.21-0.70 for self-guided, interventions [42-45,47,48].
One review reports somewhat larger effects in studies targeting
populations with clinically significant depression symptoms
(d=0.42-0.65) than for populations with mild-to-moderate
symptoms (d=0.30-0.53) [43].
To date, very few randomized clinical trials of mobile apps
targeting depression have been published in the peer-reviewed
literature [49]. We found only one such study specifically
targeting adults with mild-to-moderate depression [50,51]. In
this study, participants who used the CBT-based myCompass
app, delivered via mobile phone and Internet, reported
improvements in depression and anxiety at 7-week post-test
compared to an attention control intervention and a waiting list
condition. Treatment gains were maintained at 3-month
follow-up, and improvements in the attention control condition
matched those of the myCompass group [50].
The SuperBetter mobile Web app was evaluated in a three-arm
randomized controlled trial, with results showing the original,
“general” version of SuperBetter—with activities focused on
self-esteem and social support—more effective at reducing
depressive 
symptoms 
over 
both 
a 
combined
SuperBetter-plus-CBT and positive psychology strategies
condition and the waiting list condition. Ly et al [52] found no
between-group effects between mobile-based behavioral
activation and mindfulness apps for depression. Kauer et al [53]
and Reid et al [54] found no differences in the Depression,
Anxiety, and Stress Scale scores between a mobile app with
ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based emotional
self-awareness training and feedback and an attention control
condition. Watts et al [55] reported statistically significant large
within-group effect sizes for depression symptoms in a
nonrandomized study of their CBT-based Get Happy mobile
app, which was derived from, and evaluated against, its
Web-based predecessor, The Sadness Program. Burns et al [56]
conducted a single-group pre/post pilot of Mobilyze!, a website
with a mobile EMA component, finding large within-group
effect sizes on depressive symptomatology.
The CWD-based Overcoming Depression on the Internet
program provided early evidence that a Web-based program
with reminders was effective in reducing depression symptoms,
particularly among individuals with mild-to-moderate depression
[57,58]. Spek et al [59] found similar improvements among
individuals over 50 years old with subthreshold depressive
symptoms from a CWD-based, self-administered Internet
treatment program and those receiving CWD-based group
therapy, both significantly greater than the improvement seen
in waiting list controls. Treatment effects for the Internet-based
group were maintained 1 year following treatment [60].
Web and Mobile Delivery of Depression Interventions:
Access
Internet delivery of mental health interventions offers individuals
with online technology broad access to evidence-based
treatment. Mobile apps offer an additional channel to increase
access further, both as self-guided tools and as those supported
by counseling professionals, such as EAPs. Globally, use of
mobile and broadband mobile services is rising, while fixed
broadband service is slowing, especially in developing countries
[61]. Worldwide penetration of broadband mobile services
doubled between 2011 and 2014 to an estimated 32% (84% in
developed countries and 21% in developing countries) [61]. In
2014, there were nearly 7 billion active mobile subscriptions
worldwide, with 2.3 billion using broadband services [61]. In
2015, 64% of Americans owned a mobile phone and 19% used
it for their only or primary access to the Internet [62]. Mobile
phone-dependent Americans tend to be younger, nonwhite, and
have low income and education [62]. Capitalizing on mobile
Internet access as a delivery channel for evidence-based mental
health interventions is critical.
Mobile interventions offer the potential for anytime, anywhere
convenience and the ability to promote regular use of behavioral
and cognitive self-management strategies known to impact
mood. Consumers express high interest in, and willingness to
use, mobile phones and short message service (SMS) text
messaging to monitor and manage symptoms and cite essential
considerations such as ease of use, privacy, and security [63-66].
Proven mobile apps can provide a tool for clinical professionals
to use with help-seeking clients, while also increasing access
and retention over in-person mental health services [67,68].
Unfortunately, although the consumer app stores offer over 200
depression-specific apps, judging the credibility and efficacy
of those apps is difficult without clinical validation [69].
MoodHacker Mobile Intervention
The MoodHacker mobile intervention is one of few clinically
validated CBT-based depression self-management mobile apps
currently available. MoodHacker is designed to directly activate
key cognitive and behavioral skills from the validated CWD
program [21] and positive psychology strategies [70] (eg, mood
and positive activity planning and tracking, cognitive
restructuring, mindful self-awareness, gratitude expression, and
identifying and utilizing strengths). In contrast to the more
common lessons-based structure of many online and mobile
CBT programs, MoodHacker is optimized for a brief daily
interaction with the high-quality production value and mobile
user experience common in consumer mobile apps.
Objectives
To demonstrate the efficacy of this light-touch, mobile, Web
CBT-based experience, we compared MoodHacker as a fully
self-guided intervention to an alternative-treatment control group
that received an email with links to vetted online information
about depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users

 would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative
cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge of
depression, and functioning in the workplace. This study of the
MoodHacker intervention extends the evidence base for
CBT-based 
mobile 
interventions 
for 
adults 
with
mild-to-moderate 
depressive 
symptoms. 
Because 
the
MoodHacker mobile Web app was designed primarily to target
employees who present with depression through their EAP, the
extent to which the program effects generalize to users with and
without access to EAP support was an important research
question.
Methods
Research Design
The efficacy of the MoodHacker mobile Web app intervention
was 
assessed 
with 
a 
randomized 
controlled 
trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02335554) with two factors: condition
and EAP access (ie, subjects who had access to an EAP versus
those who did not). See Multimedia Appendix 1 for the
CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist for the trial [71]. There were
three assessments: baseline, follow-up at 6 weeks after baseline,
and follow-up at 10 weeks after baseline. After screening into
the study, agreeing to the online informed consent, and
submitting the baseline assessment, participants were blocked
on race/ethnicity and randomized within block into either (1)
treatment intervention group (n=150), which used the
MoodHacker intervention for 6 weeks, or (2) alternative care
group (n=150), which received links to six websites with
information about depression. All study protocols, the consent
process, and subject communications were reviewed and
approved by the ORCAS Institutional Review Board (IRB) for
protection of human subjects. There were no changes to the trial
design after the trial commenced.
Participants
Inclusion criteria for participation were defined as follows: (1)
18 years or older, (2) mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms
as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
(score of 10-19), (3) not currently suicidal or meeting criteria
for bipolar or schizoaffective disorder, (4) employed at least
part time, (5) English speaking, and (6) have access to a
high-speed Internet connection. Eligibility was assessed using
a two-stage screening protocol. In total, 3064 individuals
completed an online screening survey, which included questions
on demographics, technology access, and depression symptoms
(using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 [PHQ-2]), as well as
brief screening for bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. Of
those, 856 (27.94%) qualified for secondary telephonic screening
to more fully assess their depression symptoms with the PHQ-9
and to confirm their assessments for bipolar and schizoaffective
disorders. Of those 856 who qualified, 294 (34.3%) individuals
failed to complete the secondary screening, 205 (23.9%) did
not meet the PHQ-9 criteria, 44 (5.1%) endorsed suicidal
ideation or showed symptoms of bipolar or schizoaffective
disorder, and 13 (1.5%) were dropped due to suspicion of fraud
(see below). A total of 300 individuals out of 856 (35.0%) from
37 US states completed the online baseline assessment and were
randomly assigned to one of two conditions: treatment or
alternative care. See Figure 1 for a CONSORT diagram
describing study enrollment and allocation.
Study Setting and Data Collection
Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April
2013 in partnership with several organizations, including
Chestnut Global Partners EAP as our primary recruitment
partner. Non-EAP recruitment partners included Hope to Cope,
Esperanza, Mental Health America, National Alliance on Mental
Illness, LIVESTRONG, eHow, other eHealth websites, Chamber
of Commerce offices, employee support organizations, and
Craigslist. Outreach was conducted via the Chestnut EAP call
center, print ads, online postings and ads, email listservs, and
flyers. All interested potential participants were directed to an
informational website that described the broad characteristics
of the study’s purpose, activities, and compensation, concluding
with an online screening survey.
All subjects participated fully online from the location(s) of
their choice, using their own Internet-capable computers and
mobile devices. All self-report, online screening and assessment
data 
were 
collected 
via 
encrypted 
websites. 
Upon
prequalification based on the initial screening survey, research
staff conducted telephone interviews with potential participants
to determine eligibility per the inclusion criteria referenced
above. Potential participants who reported current suicidal
ideation and/or bipolar or schizoaffective disorder during
screening were offered appropriate resources according to an
IRB-approved crisis protocol and were excluded from the study.
The number of participants who self-identified with bipolar
disorder symptoms in the initial screening survey was elevated
due to suspected fraudulent individuals attempting to qualify
with severe symptoms.
Throughout the study, individuals who reported current suicidal
ideation and/or severe depression symptoms (PHQ-9 > 19) were
contacted by telephone and offered appropriate resources
according to an IRB-approved crisis protocol. Calls were made
to 114 individuals (50 treatment, 64 control) and all remained
in the study. No subjects reported suicide risk severe enough to
transfer to a suicide hotline. Nor did any subjects report any
adverse events related to the use of the MoodHacker app via
email or during follow-up calls. Although research assistants
were aware of group assignment, all other interactions with
subjects were delivered by emails that were standardized across
groups and fully automated to avoid differential interactions by
group assignment. All other research team members were
blinded and, aside from crisis calls, no research team members
had direct interaction with subjects after randomization.

 Figure 1. CONSORT diagram for the MoodHacker randomized trial.
Lack of direct contact with study participants in a fully online
study lends itself to potential participants self-reporting false
information to qualify (eg, same name or IP address shows
inconsistent age, gender, race, and/or ethnicity across multiple
attempted 
screenings). 
To 
identify 
these 
individuals,
demographic and contact data were cross-checked for fraudulent
information against other individuals in the study database, as
well as in our database of over 20,000 records of previous
Internet study applicants. Those suspected of submitting
fraudulent data were dropped from the study prior to
randomization.
To enhance sample representativeness in each experimental
condition, qualified participants were blocked on race/ethnicity
and then randomly assigned within each race/ethnicity block to
condition—treatment or alternative care—using the random
number function in our subject database. Emails indicating
group assignment and linking participants to the online informed
consent form were auto-generated in the database and sent to
participants by a research assistant. Upon completion of the
consent form, they were immediately linked to the online
baseline self-assessment. Participants also completed online
follow-up self-assessments at 6 weeks and 10 weeks after
baseline. Participants were compensated US $50 per completed
assessment.

 Study Conditions
Overview
After completing the baseline assessment, participants in the
treatment condition were emailed a link to the MoodHacker
mobile Web app and instructed to use the app for the next 6
weeks. Participants in the alternative care condition were sent
an email with links to credible online resources about depression
and instructed to review it on their own schedule for the next 6
weeks. Alternative care participants were offered use of the
MoodHacker app upon completion of the 10-week assessment.
Treatment: MoodHacker App Intervention
The MoodHacker responsive mobile Web app was designed to
educate users about depression and the benefits of CBT-based
strategies to improve mood self-management and to activate
(1) daily mood and activity monitoring, (2) increased
engagement in positive behavioral activities, (3) decreased
negative thinking and increased positive thinking, (4) increased
practice of gratitude, mindfulness, and strength-based cognitions
and behaviors, and (5) daily practice of these skills to improve
depression symptoms and increase resilience to future mood
disturbances.
The 6-week MoodHacker intervention is structured around the
key learning and behavioral objectives above. Content was
adapted from the CWD group therapy course [21], and enhanced
with mindfulness-based [33] and other evidence-based positive
psychology strategies [29,31,36]. Content is sequenced to follow
the enhanced CWD approach and delivered through daily emails,
in-app messaging, and in the Articles & Videos library. Daily
emails (see Figure 2) are sent to engage users in program
content, provide sequenced guidance through the learning
objectives in the articles and whiteboard-style videos, give tips
for getting the most out of MoodHacker, and prompt the user
to track their mood and activities daily. Users are encouraged
to view the articles and videos as ordered, but viewing is not
restricted, and users can view content according to their interests.
The emails, articles, and videos promote daily use of the featured
cognitive and behavioral skills outside the app experience.
Users are encouraged to monitor their mood and positive
cognitive and behavioral activities daily via mobile and/or
desktop access to MoodHacker. The tracker shows daily (Figure
3), weekly (Figure 4), and monthly views to highlight progress
over time and patterns between positive activities and mood
ratings. A customizable list of positive activities is presented
by domain and promotes the types of activities known to have
the highest impact (ie, social, physical, and success). The tracker
includes a journaling feature for users to note mood triggers,
experiences with the suggested activities, or personal
information about their day. A goal-setting feature allows the
user to set a goal for the number of positive activities they want
to accomplish each day.
Participants 
in 
the 
treatment 
arm 
accessed 
the
password-protected MoodHacker app with unique usernames
and passwords provided for the study. Although daily app use
was recommended in the app content, participants were not
required to achieve any app use milestones to advance through
the app experience. Participants received no clinical support as
part of the study.
Development of the MoodHacker app was undertaken by a
multidisciplinary team of researchers and developers at ORCAS;
input was incorporated from experts with extensive experience
in CBT-based self-management interventions for adults with
depression and the benefits of positive psychology. Additional
program modifications were made based on data from individual
interviews and iterative user testing with the population of
interest during the formative and production phases of the
project. The randomized trial was conducted with the first
version of the MoodHacker app. No changes were made to the
app during the study period.

Alternative Care: Vetted Websites
Alternative care participants received an email with links to
vetted online information about depression from Help Guide
[72], the Mayo Clinic, Mental Health America [73], and the
National Institute of Mental Health [74]; they were encouraged
to browse these sites on their own schedule for 6 weeks. The
educational links were emailed after the baseline assessment.
Participants in the alternative care group were then given access
to the MoodHacker program after the 10-week assessment.
Outcome Measures
Overview
Online surveys were used to assess the following: (1) depression
symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3) negative cognitions,
(4) worksite outcomes, (5) knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction
and program usability. The primary outcome measure was
depression symptoms, which was the target of the intervention.
Secondary or exploratory measures included the following: (1)
potential mediators (ie, behavioral activation, negative
cognitions, and knowledge) and (2) potential worksite outcomes
that may be influenced by improvement in worker depression.
Participants completed self-report assessments at each of the
assessment points: baseline, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks.
Demographics
Demographic data were collected during the screening process,
including the following: (1) gender, (2) age, (3) race/ethnicity,
(4) marital status, (5) highest completed education, (6) household
income, and (7) employment status.
Depression Symptoms
Depressive symptomatology was assessed at each assessment
point using the self-reported PHQ-9 (alpha = .71) [75] to assess
the nine symptoms of major depression, based on the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition
(DSM-IV). The PHQ-9 has been shown to be a reliable and
valid brief depression assessment tool [76]. Scores are summed,
with higher scores indicating higher dysfunction.
Behavioral Activation
How actively individuals are taking care of themselves,
including making positive life choices, was expected to increase
as a result of the intervention. Behavioral activation was
measured using the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale

 (BADS) Short Form [77,78]. This scale consists of nine items
(alpha = .67). Items are summed, with lower scores indicating
higher dysfunction.
Negative Thinking
Change in negative thinking was assessed using the Automatic
Thoughts Questionnaire-Revised (ATQ-R) scale Short Form
[79]. A 12-item adaptation of the ATQ-R instrument asked
respondents to rate how many times over the past week they
have had thoughts that are consistent with 12 negative
self-statements (alpha = .92). Items are summed, with higher
scores indicating higher dysfunction.
Knowledge
Participants were assessed for increase in knowledge about
depression. The scale consisted of 14 multiple-choice items
developed for this study based on the 12 learning objectives
addressed in the MoodHacker articles and videos. Higher scores
indicate higher knowledge. Test/retest reliability over a 6-week
interval for this scale was .65.
Worksite Outcomes
Worker productivity was assessed using the Work Limitations
Questionnaire (WLQ) (alpha = .87) [80-82]. The WLQ Short
Form consists of eight items divided into four subscales
measuring the degree to which a person was limited in their
job’s (1) time demands, (2) physical demands, (3) mental
demands, and (4) output demands. Work productivity loss was
calculated using methods outlined by Lerner and colleagues
[83], with higher scores indicating greater loss in worker
productivity.
Productivity loss due to work absence was assessed using the
two-item WLQ Work Absence Module, which asks about the
number of full days and part days missed in the last 2 weeks
due to health problems or medical care [84]. The percentage of
productivity lost due to absences is the ratio of total missed
hours to total usual work hours in a 2-week time frame [85].
Higher scores indicate greater work loss due to absence from
work.
Worksite outcomes were also assessed using the Workplace
Outcome Suite (WOS) (alpha = .74-.88) [86]. This instrument
is designed as an open-access instrument to facilitate empirical
research on EAP interventions. The suite contains five scales,
with five items each, that assess workplace distress, absenteeism,
presenteeism, work engagement, and life satisfaction. Each scale
is summed separately, with three scales—workplace distress,
absenteeism, and presenteeism—indicating dysfunction, and
two scales—work engagement and life satisfaction—indicating
positive workplace outcomes.
User Satisfaction and Program Usability
At 6 weeks, treatment participants completed the System
Usability Scale, which is a quantitative measure of program
ease of use [87]. The scale includes 10 items, and users were
asked to what degree they agreed or disagreed with program
use and satisfaction statements on a 6-point scale from 1
(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Items were scored
using methods outlined by Bangor and colleagues [88], with a
higher score indicating higher usability.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical power calculations for the analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) indicated that a sample size of 300 yielded
sufficient power (>.80) to detect a condition effect of Cohen’s
d=0.34 or larger (moderately small effect size). A recent
meta-analysis of Internet-based CBT interventions for depression
[59] had found a mean effect size of d=0.32 for change in
depressive symptoms and the mean effect size obtained in a
randomized pilot study evaluating an abbreviated prototype of
this app was d=1.05. Thus, this sample size provided adequate
statistical power to detect the anticipated effects for the primary
outcomes of interest.
Univariate effects of intervention condition, EAP access, and
their interaction on outcome measures were examined using
between-subjects ANCOVA, adjusting for pretest outcomes.
These analyses were conducted to evaluate effects on outcome
measures assessed at both 6-week and 10-week follow-up. If
the condition by EAP access interaction was significant for an
outcome measure, separate subpopulation ANCOVA analyses
were conducted on that outcome measure for subjects with and
without EAP access. We explored dose-response relationships
and self-monitoring participation within the treatment group by
correlating process indicants with change in outcome measures.
All subjects were included in intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses at
each follow-up. Prior to conducting these analyses, we employed
the single imputation procedure available in SPSS, version 21.0
(IBM Corp) to account for missing data. Alpha was set to P<.05,
two-tailed, for all tests.
Results
Baseline Equivalency and Attrition
The expectation of baseline equivalency due to random
assignment of groups was examined. The treatment and
alternative care groups were compared on demographic
characteristics and outcome measures collected at pretest.
Contingency table analyses and t tests were conducted on
categorical and continuous measures, respectively. The groups
did not significantly differ on any demographic characteristics
or pretest outcome measures. See Table 1 for demographic
descriptive data.

The extent to which attrition threatened the internal and external
validity of the study was evaluated using contingency table
analyses and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Participants who
completed each of the follow-up assessments were compared
to those who did not complete that follow-up with respect to
demographic characteristics and pretest outcome measures. We
also conducted analyses to test whether outcome variables were
differentially affected across conditions by attrition. These latter
analyses examined the effects of condition, attrition status, and
their interaction on pretest outcomes. Examination of attrition
between pretest and 6-week follow-up revealed only 10 out of
150 (6.7%) treatment participants did not complete the
assessment compared to 4 out of 150 (2.7%) alternative care
participants. Only 10 out of 150 (6.7%) treatment participants
did not complete the 10-week follow-up assessment compared
to 5 out of 150 (3.3%) alternative care participants. Attrition
rates did not significantly differ by condition. Moreover, we
found no statistically significant differences in demographic
characteristics or baseline outcomes by attrition status, nor did
we find any statistically significant interactions between attrition
and condition predicting baseline outcomes, suggesting that
attrition was not systematic.
Analyses compared baseline demographic data of subjects with
EAP access versus those without EAP access. Subjects with
EAP access had significantly more children (P=.003), consisted
of fewer Hispanics (P=.01), were more likely to have full-time
employment (P=.001), had a higher level of education (P=.047),
and had a greater income (P=.001).
Intervention Effects
Table 2 provides ANCOVA results for all outcome measures
at 6-week and 10-week follow-up. Multimedia Appendix 2
provides means and standard deviations for each outcome by
assessment time and condition, along with pretest to 6-week
follow-up and pretest to 10-week follow-up outcome analyses.
Primary Outcome: Depression Symptoms
From pretest to 6-week follow-up, the ANCOVA with the full
sample found statistically significant program effects on
depression symptoms (PHQ-9) (P=.01, partial eta2 = .021).
However, 
a 
statistically 
significant
condition-by-user-EAP-access interaction effect was also
obtained (P=.05, partial eta2 = .013), indicating differential
program effects depending upon subjects’ access to an EAP.
Separate subpopulation analyses indicated significant positive
program effects for subjects with EAP access (P=.004, partial
eta2 = .093) and no program effects for subjects without EAP
access (P=.66, partial eta2 = .001). From pretest to 10-week
follow-up, the condition-by-EAP-access interaction effect was
not statistically significant (P=.21, partial eta2 = .005), so
subpopulation analyses were not indicated. The ANCOVA with
the full sample found that there were no program effects (P=.17,
partial eta2 = .006) at 10-week follow-up.
Mediator Outcomes: Behavioral Activation, Negative
Thoughts, and Knowledge
From pretest to 6-week follow-up, the ANCOVA with the full
sample found statistically significant positive effects for the
program on each mediator measure: BADS (P=.004, partial eta2
= .027), ATQ-R (P=.01, partial eta2 = .020), and knowledge
(P=.02, partial eta2 = .017). The condition-by-EAP-access
interaction effects were not statistically significant on any of
the mediator measures, indicating that there was no need for
subpopulation analyses. From pretest to 10-week follow-up, the
condition-by-EAP-access interaction effects were not statistically
significant on any of the mediator measures. The ANCOVA
with the full sample found statistically significant program
effects on BADS (P=.01, partial eta2 = .021), but not on ATQ-R
(P=.34, partial eta2 = .003) or knowledge (P=.55, partial eta2 =
.001).
Worksite Outcomes
From pretest to 6-week follow-up, the condition-by-EAP-access
interaction effects were statistically significant on the WLQ
productivity loss measure (P=.048, partial eta2 = .016), the WLQ
work absence measure (P=.048, partial eta2 = .016), and the
workplace distress measure (P=.03, partial eta2 = .017).
Consequently, subpopulation analyses were carried out for these
measures only. The ANCOVA with the full sample at 6-week
follow-up found statistically significant program effects on
WLQ work absence (P=.003, partial eta2 = .032). No statistically
significant program effects were found on the following: WLQ
productivity loss (P=.20, partial eta2 = .007), WOS absenteeism
(P=.16, partial eta2 = .007), WOS presenteeism (P=.09, partial
eta2 = .010), WOS engagement (P=.75, partial eta2 = .001), or
WOS life satisfaction (P=.12, partial eta2 = .008). However,
separate subpopulation analyses at 6-week follow-up on the
WLQ productivity loss measure indicated significant positive
effects of the program for subjects with EAP access (P=.047,
partial eta2 = .052) and no program effects for subjects without
EAP access (P=.60, partial eta2 = .002). Similarly, subpopulation
analyses at 6-week follow-up on the WLQ work absence
measure indicated significant positive effects of the program
for subjects with EAP access (P=.02, partial eta2 = .070) and
no program effects for subjects without (P=.51, partial eta2 =
.002). Lastly, the WOS workplace distress measure indicated
significant positive effects of the program for subjects with EAP
access (P=.007, partial eta2 = .080) and no program effects for
subjects without (P=.64, partial eta2 = .001).
From 
pretest 
to 
10-week 
follow-up, 
the
condition-by-EAP-access interaction effects were statistically
significant on the WLQ work absence measure (P=.04, partial
eta2 = .016). Consequently, subpopulation analyses were carried
out for this measure only. The ANCOVA with the full sample
at 10-week follow-up found statistically significant program

 effects only on the WLQ work absence measure (P=.02, partial
eta2 = .022). Separate subpopulation analyses at 10-week
follow-up on the WLQ work absence measure indicated
significant positive effects of the program for subjects with EAP
access (P=.03, partial eta2 = .060) and no program effects for
subjects without EAP access (P=.78, partial eta2 = 0).
Program Utilization, Satisfaction, and Usability
On average, participants in the treatment arm logged into the
MoodHacker app 16.0 times (SD 13.3, range 1-49) for a total
duration of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3, range 0-6.5) between pretest and
6-week follow-up. The average rating of program satisfaction
was 4.6 (SD 1.0) on a 6-point scale, indicating that the
participants were mostly satisfied with the intervention.
Participants also completed the System Usability Scale [87] at
the 6-week follow-up, which provides a quantitative measure
of program ease of use. The average System Usability Scale
score was 79.7 (SD 17.1), corresponding to a usability grade of
B+ for the intervention program.

 Discussion
Principal Findings
This randomized effectiveness trial examined the effect of the
MoodHacker mobile Web app on depression symptoms,
important cognitive and behavioral mediators, and workplace
outcomes among employed adults with and without access to
EAP services. The MoodHacker app produced significant effects
from pretest to 6-week follow-up for all subjects compared to
alternative care subjects on (1) the clinical outcome measure
(ie, depression symptoms), with much stronger results among
those with EAP access, (2) all three mediating outcome measures
(ie, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and depression
knowledge), and (3) one of the worksite outcome measures (ie,
work absence). Among subjects with EAP access, larger effects
were found on depression symptoms, productivity loss, work
absence, and workplace distress. Significant effects were
maintained at 10-week follow-up for work absence for all
subjects, with much stronger results among those with EAP
access. The effect sizes on depression symptoms in this study
(partial eta2 = .021 for the full population and partial eta2 = .093
for those with EAP access, which convert to approximately
Cohen’s d=0.30 and 0.64, respectively) are comparable to those
reported 
for 
previous 
meta-analyses 
of 
self-guided,
Internet-based CBT programs (Cohen’s d=0.21-0.31) [42,44].
These findings suggest that the approach used to activate
CBT-based skills in MoodHacker was effective and begin to
build an evidence base for light-touch, CBT-based mobile apps
for depression self-management. Because program effects were
small-to-medium size, modifications to increase the potency of
the intervention are warranted. Evidence from prior online
CBT-based programs suggests that supporting the mobile
intervention with counselors, such as those working in EAPs,
is likely to increase both adherence to the app and efficacy in
reducing depression symptoms [42,43,47,89].
At the 10-week assessment, only effects on work absence
remained significant. Effects on depression symptoms were no
longer significant, possibly because the daily emails ended after
6 weeks; the emails included prompts to view content,
introduction of key concepts and skills, tips to optimize use of
the program, and encouragement to track mood and activities.
Although our results are consistent with a recent meta-analysis
of computerized CBT programs showing that results of
computer-based CBT programs typically attenuate over time
[45], evidence from other studies suggests that app adherence
and, thus, efficacy might be improved by extending program
prompts and psychoeducational messaging beyond the original
6-week intervention period and/or providing mobile-friendly
prompts (eg, text messages and app notifications) in addition
to the emails utilized here [65,90]. More research is needed to
determine the optimal level and type of program contact that is
needed to retain program efficacy.
Employee Assistance Program Participants Versus
Non-Employee Assistance Program Participants
The inclusion of subjects without access to EAP services
provided an important opportunity to evaluate program efficacy
with this population and to compare program efficacy for
subjects with and without EAP access. It was expected that the
subjects with access to EAP services who chose to participate
in this study were likely to be quite similar to real-world
individuals who might elect to use a mobile or online program
in conjunction with those services. Thus, these subjects provided
a “real-world” effectiveness trial. The effect sizes found on
depression symptoms, work absence, and productivity loss
among the targeted EAP population are quite encouraging and
suggest that EAPs offering use of the MoodHacker app may
reasonably expect to find significant depression-related
improvements in their employee populations. Conclusions
regarding program effects for non-EAP individuals are less
clear.
In many cases, the subjects without EAP access were recruited
without the endorsement of a trusted partner, most notably when
recruitment was through entities such as eHow, Chambers of
Commerce, eHealth websites, and especially Craigslist. This
raises questions regarding the motivation of these subjects for
participation. For example, participants who presented to their
EAP with depression symptoms and were willing to use a
behavior-change program might reasonably be expected to be
motivated to change their depression. In contrast, participants
recruited from the other entities listed above might have been
more motivated by the financial compensation offered, rather
than a desire to improve their depression symptoms. Further
evidence of skewed motivations in this recruitment group is
indicated in the very high numbers of individuals who were
screened out by reporting much higher than expected rates of
mania, and to a lesser extent, depressive symptoms during the
online screening.
Analyses of baseline data indicated that the non-EAP subjects
had lower incomes, were less likely to be fully employed, and
had less education. Since these three factors are also related to
poorer outcomes in depression, these factors may at least
partially explain why the program was not as effective for
individuals with no EAP access [91,92]. While the veracity of
such attributions regarding motivation for participation is
difficult to ascertain, the lack of program effects on depression
symptoms in the non-EAP participants is consistent with this
notion.
Study Limitations
We acknowledge several limitations in this initial efficacy trial
and offer some caution in interpreting the findings. First,
although random assignment was used, all the participants
volunteered for the study and thus represent a convenience
sample of interested individuals and cannot be considered
representative of the general population. Second, participants
completed self-report surveys, the validity and reliability of
which may be somewhat suspect. Third, the reliability of some
measures is only moderate and this may have attenuated the
effect size of the intervention effects found in the study. Fourth,
while the attrition rates in the study were relatively low, subjects
were compensated for completing assessments. Thus, it cannot
be concluded that the subject completion rate found here would
occur at the same rate without compensation for participation.
Lastly, attenuation of outcomes at 10-week follow-up suggests

 a need for more potent activation of CBT-based skills or a need
for extended app contacts to drive continued engagement. Future
research will explore the frequency and type of app contacts to
optimize extended engagement and improve both short- and
long-term efficacy of this light-touch, mobile approach to
activating use of CBT skills to self-manage depressive
symptomatology.
Summary
Given the high prevalence of depression and the fact that most
adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a critical
need for effective interventions that can be widely and
cost-effectively disseminated through multiple delivery channels.
The MoodHacker mobile Web app has demonstrated potential
for dissemination (1) as a self-guided intervention for individuals
unwilling or unable to seek in-person depression services and
(2) through EAP and similar health and wellness organizations
supporting employed adults and their families. Ideally, exposure
to MoodHacker needs to be extended beyond the 6-week time
frame to maintain user engagement and improve longer-term
efficacy. Further, the implementation and integration of
MoodHacker within EAPs and similar organizations that can
provide guidance from counselors seems likely to augment the
effectiveness of the MoodHacker app.
