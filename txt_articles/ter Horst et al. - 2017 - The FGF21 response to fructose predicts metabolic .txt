ABSTRACT
Objective: Fructose consumption has been implicated in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence shows that
fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has beneficial effects on glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism and may also mediate an adaptive response to
fructose ingestion. Fructose acutely stimulates circulating FGF21 consistent with a hormonal response. We aimed to evaluate whether fructose-
induced FGF21 secretion is linked to metabolic outcomes in obese humans before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss.
Methods: We recruited 40 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients and assessed the serum FGF21 response to fructose (75-g fructose tolerance test)
and basal and insulin-mediated glucose and lipid fluxes during a 2-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with infusion of [6,6-2H2] glucose
and [1,1,2,3,3-2H5] glycerol. Liver biopsies were obtained during bariatric surgery. Nineteen subjects underwent the same assessments at 1-year
follow-up.
Results: Serum FGF21 increased 3-fold at 120 min after fructose ingestion and returned to basal levels at 300 min. Neither basal FGF21 nor the
fructose-FGF21 response correlated with liver fat content or liver histopathology, but increased levels were associated with elevated endogenous
glucose production, increased lipolysis, and peripheral/muscle insulin resistance. At 1-year follow-up, subjects had lost 28 � 6% of body weight
and improved in all metabolic outcomes, but fructose-stimulated FGF21 dynamics did not markedly differ from the pre-surgical state. The
association between increased basal and stimulated FGF21 levels with poor metabolic health was no longer present after weight loss.
Conclusions: Fructose ingestion in obese humans stimulates FGF21 secretion, and this response is related to systemic metabolism. Further
studies are needed to establish if FGF21 signaling is (patho)physiologically involved in fructose metabolism and metabolic health.

1. INTRODUCTION
Fructose is the sweetest of all naturally-occurring carbohydrates. It is
one of the main monosaccharides in our diet [1], and many humans
worldwide consume fructose on a daily basis [2]. Nearly 10% of the
energy in an average Western diet comes from fructose [3]. Recently,
however, concerns about the consumption of fructose have been
raised as high fructose intake may contribute to the current epidemics
of obesity and its metabolic complications [4,5]. Humans commonly
consume fructose together with glucose in the form of sucrose or high-

 fructose corn syrup, and sugar (in general) has evident health impli-
cations: its overconsumption is associated with chronic increased
energy intake and weight gain [6,7]. However, several lines of evidence
also implicate fructose (specifically) to be a particularly harmful sugar
[8]. Firstly, animal models consistently develop obesity and insulin
resistance when exposed to high-fructose diets [9e11]. Secondly,
human fructose consumption is epidemiologically linked with weight
gain, insulin resistance, and other components of the metabolic syn-
drome [5,6,12e14]. Thirdly, isocaloric intervention trials (comparing
high-fructose diets vs energy-matched control diets) demonstrate that
fructose promotes visceral adiposity, de novo lipogenesis, dyslipide-
mia, and hepatic insulin resistance, and more so than glucose [15e
17].
Some of the worrying observations regarding the adverse health ef-
fects of high-fructose exposure may be the result of its unique hepatic
metabolism. Glucose ingestion raises systemic blood glucose levels,
which results in an appropriate insulin response in order to coordinate
systemic glucose handling. Fructose, on the other hand, is almost
completely extracted from portal blood upon first-pass through the
liver, and its metabolism is therefore mostly hepatic [18]. Hepatic
fructolysis rapidly metabolizes fructose into triose phosphates,
thereby providing substrate to the glycolysis, glycogenesis, gluco-
neogenesis, and/or lipogenesis pathways. In addition, carbohydrate
metabolites in the liver activate carbohydrate response element-
binding protein (ChREBP), a key transcription factor for enzymes in
the glycolysis and lipogenesis pathways [19]. Thus, since fructose is
preferentially metabolized by the liver, fructose more than glucose
acutely raises intrahepatic carbohydrate intermediaries, activating
ChREBP and promoting hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis gene pro-
grams [20].
Recent rodent studies also demonstrate that sugar-activated ChREBP
can transactivate hepatic expression of fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21) [21]. This novel metabolic hormone is synthesized by multiple
tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and pancreas [22]. How-
ever, the liver is the major contributor to serum levels, and FGF21 in
the liver also responds to dietary manipulations [23,24]. It has
important beneficial effects on whole-body carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism as well as energy balance and body weight [25e27]. In
rodents, FGF21 helps to coordinate the physiological adaptations to
fasting and ketogenic diets [23,28]. In humans, it is not meaningfully
regulated by short-term fasting or ketogenic diets [21]. Instead,
circulating FGF21 levels rise after short-term high-carbohydrate
overfeeding [29]. In fact, the acute ingestion of an oral fructose load
leads to an increase in FGF21 secretion and a return to baseline within
4e5 h [30]. This is the only known e to our knowledge e acute
hormonal response to fructose ingestion in humans, and this raises the
intriguing hypothesis that FGF21 is involved in hepatic fructose
metabolism or the whole-body metabolic response to fructose inges-
tion. Although translational evidence in humans is limited, we have
recently demonstrated that, in rodents, the ChREBP-FGF21 axis is
essential for physiological hepatic fructose metabolism, including the
shuttling of fructose carbon into the lipogenesis pathway [21].
Although pharmacological FGF21 administration to animals has
evident beneficial effects [25e27], elevated circulating FGF21 levels
are, surprisingly, associated with poor metabolic health in humans and
animals. In fact, FGF21 levels are increased with obesity, insulin
resistance, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) [31,32]. Moreover, obese mice display an attenuated
signaling response and diminished metabolic improvements upon
exogenous FGF21 treatment, indicating that obesity is associated with
resistance to FGF21 [33]. It is currently unknown what mechanism is
responsible for this phenomenon and also whether it is reversible with
weight loss.
Therefore, to investigate the relevance of the fructose-FGF21 paradigm
in relation to human metabolic disease, we performed a clinical study
designed to evaluate whether fructose-induced FGF21 secretion is
related to basal or insulin-mediated metabolic fluxes in obese humans
before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Design
This multicenter observational intervention study was part of RESOLVE,
a European research program on the metabolic syndrome (www.
resolve-diabetes.org). The study was designed to evaluate the
fructose-FGF21 axis in obese humans before and after bariatric
surgery-induced weight loss and its relation to metabolic outcomes.
The protocol was approved by the Academic Medical Center medical
ethics committee, and all subjects provided written informed consent
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was pro-
spectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry (www.
trialregister.nl: NTR4666).
2.2. Subjects
Forty morbidly obese subjects were recruited from the outpatient
clinics of two obesity centers in the Amsterdam metropolitan area.
Subjects were eligible to participate if they i) were aged >18 years, ii)
met the criteria for bariatric surgery in accordance with current na-
tional guidelines [34], iii) were scheduled to undergo laparoscopic
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, and iv) had stable weight (<5%
weight change) for at least 3 months prior to the study assessments.
Exclusion criteria were i) substance abuse (alcohol >2 units/day,
recreational drugs), ii) use of lipid-lowering drugs, exogenous insulin,
incretin mimetics, antipsychotics, or antidepressants, iii) childhood-
onset obesity, or iv) any somatic disorder except for common
obesity-related conditions (for instance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or
obstructive sleep apnea). All subjects completed a medical evaluation
including history, physical examination, and blood tests. Body
composition was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis
(Maltron BF-906; Rayleigh, UK).
2.3. Fructose challenge
Fructose tolerance tests were performed as described [30]. Briefly,
after an overnight fast, subjects ingested an oral dose of 75 g fructose
dissolved in 225 ml water. Blood samples were collected regularly for
5 h following the ingestion of fructose.
2.4. Liver fat content
We assessed the percentage of liver volume comprised of fat using
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy as described [35]. This
method has high diagnostic accuracy and high precision with low
variability for assessment of hepatic steatosis in the context of NAFLD
[36].
2.5. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp protocol
Basal glucose and lipolysis fluxes and tissue-specific parameters of
insulin sensitivity were assessed during a two-step hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp study, which has been described in detail [37,38].
This experimental protocol allowed us to accurately measure i) the
basal rate of endogenous glucose production (EGP), ii) the basal rate of
appearance (Ra) of glycerol (reflecting whole-body lipolysis), iii) the
insulin-mediated suppression of EGP (reflecting hepatic insulin

 sensitivity), iv) the insulin-mediated suppression of glycerol Ra
(reflecting adipose tissue insulin sensitivity), and v) the insulin-
stimulated rate of disappearance (Rd) of glucose (reflecting periph-
eral/muscle insulin sensitivity).
Briefly, after an overnight fast, subjects received primed continuous
infusions of the stable isotope-labeled metabolic tracers [6,6-2H2]
glucose and [1,1,2,3,3-2H5] glycerol (>99% enriched; Cambridge
Isotopes, Andover, MA, USA). Basal fluxes were determined after 2 h of
tracer equilibration. Insulin-mediated suppressions of EGP and glycerol
Ra were assessed after 2 h of low-dose (step 1) insulin infusion
[Actrapid 20 mU$(m2 body surface area)�1 min�1; Novo Nordisk
Farma, Alphen aan de Rijn, The Netherlands]. Insulin-stimulated
glucose Rd was assessed after 2 h of high-dose (step 2) insulin
infusion (60 mU m�2 min�1). During hyperinsulinemia, plasma
glucose was maintained constant at 5.0 mmol/l by frequent bedside
monitoring of glucose levels and variable infusion of exogenous
glucose (enriched with [6,6-2H2] glucose to approximate plasma
enrichment).
2.6. Surgery and liver histology
Subjects underwent scheduled laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
surgery 1e6 weeks after baseline study assessments. Laparoscopic
subcapsular liver biopsies were taken from the lower left lobe
(segment III) by an experienced surgeon at the start of the procedure.
Liver histopathology was evaluated by an experienced liver pathologist
who was blinded to all subject data and scored in accordance with
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network rec-
ommendations [39,40]. Subjects were instructed to maintain stable
weight through consumption of a weight-maintenance diet in the
preoperative period.
2.7. Follow-up
Weight loss after gastric bypass surgery is maximal at 1-year follow-up
and body weight usually stabilizes at this time [41]. Therefore, we
invited subjects to participate in follow-up study assessments 1 year
after the bariatric surgery. All baseline study assessments except for
the liver biopsy were repeated. Subjects were only eligible for the
follow-up study if they had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
procedure. All subjects in the follow-up study provided additional
written informed consent.
2.8. Laboratory analyses
Plasma glucose was determined with the glucose oxidase method
using a Biosen C-line plus glucose analyzer (EKF Diagnostics, Barle-
ben/Magdeburg, Germany). Plasma insulin and cortisol were deter-
mined by immunoassay on an Immulite 2000 system (Diagnostic
Products, Los Angeles, CA, USA), with intra-assay variation of 4e5%
and 3e6%, respectively, and inter-assay variation of 5% and 5e7%,
respectively. Plasma glucagon was determined by radioimmunoassay
(Linco Research, St Charles, MO, United States), with intra-assay
variation of 4e8% and inter-assay variation of 6e11%. Plasma free
fatty acids (FFAs) were determined by enzymatic colorimetric method
(NEFA C test kit; Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany), with intra-assay
variation of 1% and inter-assay variation of 4e15%. Serum FGF21
was determined by commercially-available enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK), with intra-assay
variation of 3e4% and inter-assay variation of 5e11%. Plasma en-
richments of [6,6-2H2] glucose and [1,1,2,3,3-2H5] glycerol (tracer-to-
tracee ratios) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spec-
trometry [42].
2.9. Calculations
Metabolic fluxes (EGP, glycerol Ra, and glucose Rd) were calculated
using modified versions of the Steele equations for the steady state
(basal fluxes) or non-steady state (during insulin infusion) [43,44].
Basal EGP and glycerol Ra were expressed as mmol$(fat-free body
mass [FFM])�1 min�1 and mmol$(kg total body mass)�1 min�1,
respectively. Insulin-mediated effects on EGP, glycerol Ra, and glucose
Rd were expressed as percentage relative to basal. Area under the
curve (AUC) was calculated by trapezoidal method. The FGF21
response to fructose ingestion was expressed as the serum FGF21
AUC from 0 to 300 min.
2.10. Statistical analyses
Data are presented as count (%), mean � standard deviation (SD) or
median [interquartile range (IQR)], depending on type and distribution.
Post-ingestion hormone and metabolite levels were compared to basal
levels using two-tailed paired t tests at each time point with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons. Correlations were evaluated by
linear regression analysis. Within-subject comparisons before vs after
bariatric surgery were evaluated by two-tailed paired t or Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests, depending on distribution. For before vs after
comparisons of post-ingestion hormone and metabolite levels, we
used two-tailed paired t tests at each time point with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons. Findings were considered sig-
nificant if p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics v23 (Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism v6 (La
Jolla, CA, USA).

 3. RESULTS
3.1. Fructose ingestion acutely stimulated circulating FGF21,
glucose, and insulin levels
Baseline characteristics of the included subjects prior to bariatric
surgery are presented in Table 1. In these obese subjects, we first
evaluated the humoral responses to a 75-g oral fructose load.
Consistent with previous reports [30], serum FGF21 levels initially
decreased by 9 � 11% at 30 min, then rapidly increased to
311 � 200% of basal levels at 120 min, and returned to basal levels at
300 min (Figure 1A). Although there was substantial between-subject
variation in basal FGF21 levels as well as in the magnitude of the
FGF21 response, each subject displayed strongly stimulated FGF21
levels at 90e120 min. Fructose ingestion also stimulated a small and
transient increase in plasma glucose levels at 30e60 min (Figure 1B).
This was accompanied by a modest increase in plasma insulin levels at
30e120 min (Figure 1C).
3.2. Basal and fructose-stimulated FGF21 levels are not related to
hepatic steatosis or NASH activity
Fructose is preferentially metabolized by the liver [18], and circulating
FGF21 is mostly derived from the liver [45]. Therefore, to evaluate
whether variation in circulating FGF21 levels may reflect changes in
synthesis/secretion in the context of NAFLD/NASH, we assessed liver
fat content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and histopathological
features of NAFLD/NASH in liver biopsies. Liver histology confirmed the
radiologic assessment of hepatic steatosis (liver fat content on spec-
troscopy vs percentage of steatotic hepatocytes on histology: r ¼ 0.64,
p < 0.001). Neither basal FGF21 nor the FGF21 AUC after fructose
ingestion correlated with liver fat content (r ¼ 0.26, p ¼ 0.131 and
r ¼ 0.17, p ¼ 0.337, respectively). In addition, although only seven
subjects had global NASH scores �5 (histology indicative of NASH
[39]), these subjects did not present with differences in basal FGF21
(310 � 108 vs 311 � 205 pg/ml, p ¼ 0.991) nor FGF21 AUC
(1.4 � 0.5 vs 1.3 � 0.6 pg/ml min 105, p ¼ 0.746) compared to
subjects with lower NASH scores.
3.3. Elevated basal and fructose-stimulated FGF21 levels are
associated with parameters of metabolic disease
To determine whether FGF21 dynamics relate to basal metabolic fluxes
or parameters of insulin action, we measured these fluxes using the
glucose clamp technique and infusions of stable isotope-labeled
metabolic tracers. Both basal FGF21 and FGF21 AUC correlated
positively with basal EGP (Figure 2AeB) and basal glycerol Ra
(Figure 2CeD). Basal FGF21, but not the FGF21 AUC, correlated
negatively with insulin-stimulated glucose Rd (Figure 2EeF). In these
subjects, circulating FGF21 levels did not correlate with insulin sup-
pression of EGP or insulin suppression of glycerol Ra (not shown).
These results indicate that higher basal and stimulated FGF21 levels
are associated with distinct features of metabolic disease in obese
humans, specifically with elevated basal EGP, increased basal lipol-
ysis, and peripheral insulin resistance.
3.4. Bariatric surgery-induced weight loss does not affect basal
FGF21 and the FGF21 response to fructose
Thirty-six (out of 40 included) subjects were eligible to participate in
the follow-up study: one subject did not have surgery and three
subjects had sleeve gastrectomy (instead of the planned gastric bypass
surgery). Seventeen (out of 36 eligible) subjects declined follow-up
participation. Therefore, a total of 19 subjects completed follow-up
at 1 year. In these subjects, bariatric surgery was associated with
improvements in body weight, adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and clinical
biochemistry (Table 2). In addition, and consistent with previous re-
ports [46], all clamp-derived parameters of glucose metabolism and
insulin action, aside from basal EGP, were markedly improved at 1 year
(Table 2), indicating increased insulin sensitivity in all tissues.
Large intra-individual differences in serum FGF21 were observed
before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss, but weight loss
did not produce a consistent directional effect on their basal FGF21

 levels or the FGF21 AUC after fructose (Figure 3AeB). However, peak
fructose-stimulated FGF21 levels were slightly higher in subjects after
bariatric surgery (Figure 3C). Post-ingestion FGF21 tended to peak
earlier [that is, at 90 min instead of 120 min (Figure 3D)]. In addition,
bariatric surgery-induced weight loss was associated with reduced
glucose and insulin levels after fasting and following fructose ingestion
(Figure 3EeF). There were no hypoglycemic events after fructose
ingestion.
In obese subjects prior to bariatric surgery, the strongest correlation
we observed was between basal FGF21 and EGP (Figure 2A). We also
observed a strong correlation between basal FGF21 and EGP when we
restricted the pre-bariatric analysis to the 19 subjects who were
followed up (r ¼ 0.51, p ¼ 0.026), whereas basal FGF21 and EGP did
not correlate in these 19 subjects at 1-year follow-up (Figure 3G). At
this time, surprisingly, both basal and fructose-stimulated FGF21
levels were negatively correlated with basal glycerol Ra (Figure 3HeI).
In contrast to our results in obese subjects prior to bariatric surgery,
these observations indicate that higher basal and post-ingestion FGF21
levels are associated with lower rates of lipolysis in post-bariatric
subjects. This was also confirmed by multiple linear regression ana-
lyses, including insulin and/or parameters of adiposity (BMI, waist
circumference, or body fat content) as covariates, where FGF21 was an
independent (and inverse) predictor of basal glycerol Ra. Post-bariatric
FGF21 dynamics did not correlate with other metabolic parameters (not

4. DISCUSSION
We here demonstrate a relationship between fructose-FGF21 dy-
namics and human metabolism. Firstly, we confirm that fructose
ingestion acutely stimulates FGF21 secretion in morbidly obese
humans, thereby extending the potential of FGF21 as a marker of
fructose metabolism to this high-risk population. We previously re-
ported that the FGF21 response to a 75-g oral fructose dose varied
widely among healthy humans and that excursions were greater in
overweight subjects [30]. In the present study, we also observed
substantial variation in FGF21 dynamics between obese subjects.
Moreover, this variation could not be explained by differences in liver
fat content or histopathological features of NAFLD/NASH in liver bi-
opsies. Therefore, instead, the variation may reflect individual differ-
ences in intestinal fructose absorption [47], differences in sensitivity of
the ChREBP-FGF21 axis to intrahepatic fructose metabolites [21], or
differences in sensitivity to paracrine or endocrine FGF21 actions [33].
Further studies may elucidate whether FGF21 signaling is physiolog-
ically involved in human fructose metabolism and metabolic health, as
is the case for rodents [21].
Secondly, basal and fructose-induced FGF21 levels correlated with
several features of metabolic disease in treatment-naive morbidly
obese subjects: increased levels were associated with elevated hepatic
glucose production, increased whole-body lipolysis, and peripheral
insulin resistance. Although these results are consistent with the
possibility that FGF21 causally contributes to fructose-mediated
metabolic pathology, that interpretation is not in agreement with
emerging preclinical evidence. This includes consistently beneficial
effects of treatment with recombinant human FGF21 in animal models
of obesity, diabetes, and NAFLD [25e27]. Therefore, in line with the
phenomenon of FGF21 resistance in murine obesity [33], these results
possibly reflect epiphenomenal associations between obesity-related
FGF21 resistance and obesity-related insulin resistance/metabolic
syndrome. In addition, we have recently identified the ChREBP-FGF21
as an essential signaling axis in hepatic fructose physiology [21].
Following this paradigm, humans with FGF21 resistance would have to
compensate by increasing FGF21 secretion in order to metabolize
ingested fructose.
Thirdly, we demonstrate that fructose-FGF21 responsiveness is
conserved in obese subjects after bariatric surgery. At 1-year follow-
up, subjects had lost 28 � 6% of their starting body weight and
presented with substantial improvements in most measured metabolic
parameters. In fact, post-bariatric subjects were metabolically healthy
with regards to both hepatic steatosis [48] and insulin sensitivity [37].
Nevertheless, neither basal FGF21 levels nor the serum FGF21
response to fructose was markedly different from the pre-bariatric
state, and the associations between FGF21 levels and indices of
poor metabolic health were no longer present at this time. Thus, post-
bariatric patients are characterized by persistently high fructose-FGF21
excursions in light of markedly reduced body weight and the resolution
of hepatic steatosis and other metabolic demise. One possible
explanation for this observation is persistent FGF21 resistance,
because the subjects’ post-bariatric body mass index (BMI) was still in
the overweight/obese range. To summarize, although the clinical
relevance of these findings remains to be determined, they indicate
that i) high serum FGF21 levels are not the result of fatty liver, as has
been suggested [24], and ii) the fructose-FGF21 axis, which is likely
mediated by hepatic ChREBP activation [21], is conserved in obese
patients after bariatric weight loss. It will now be of interest to
determine whether persistently elevated FGF21 levels in post-bariatric
patients reflect sustained (or irreversible) obesity-related FGF21
resistance.
Several factors may have contributed to the altered fructose-stimulated
plasma glucose and insulin dynamics after bariatric surgery-induced
weight loss. Ingestion of fructose raises blood glucose, in part
because it provides gluconeogenic substrate and induces the
expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes [8,20]. In healthy subjects,
29e54% of an oral fructose dose is converted to glucose within 3e6 h
after ingestion [49], but gluconeogenesis from fructose is decreased in
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients [50]. This suggests that fructose
carbon may instead be diverted into other metabolic pathways, such as
lipogenesis or lactate production [51]. Moreover, although the initial
increment in plasma glucose at 30e60 min was comparable, sub-
sequent dynamics suggest that glucose clearance is particularly
increased after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss. Glucose clear-
ance is primarily dependent on insulin stimulation of peripheral glucose
Rd [52], and our clamp results also demonstrate greatly improved

after bariatric surgery (n ¼ 19).

 peripheral insulin sensitivity at 1-year follow-up. In accordance, the
magnitude of the insulin response to fructose ingestion was greatly
reduced after surgery. Note that FGF21, glucose, and insulin levels
peaked earlier in post-bariatric patients. This is consistent with the
known increased rate of nutrient absorption and rapidity of insulin
secretion after gastric bypass surgery [50,53,54]. The time frame in
which insulin is released also suggests that another (non-glycemic)
signal, such as fructose-induced incretin secretion [55], mediates part
of the insulin response. In fact, fructose ingestion stimulated prolonged
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) release in humans [56], and liraglutide

 administration to mice increased hepatic and circulating FGF21 levels
[57,58], suggesting that GLP1 may be involved in the FGF21 response
to fructose. If that is the case, then further studies may also evaluate
how these hormones are related in individuals after bariatric surgery,
who are characterized by increased postprandial GLP1 release [59],
but no marked changes in FGF21 dynamics.
One particularly interesting observation is that basal FGF21 levels
strongly correlated with basal glucose production in treatment-naive
obese subjects, but not in post-bariatric surgery subjects. We have
recently demonstrated that, in the setting of high-fructose feeding to
rodents, activation of ChREBP is a major determinant of basal glucose
production independently of hepatic insulin signaling [20]. As hepatic
ChREBP activity is increased in obese subjects [60] and ChREBP ap-
pears to be a major regulator of circulating FGF21 [21], the strong
correlation between basal glucose production and FGF21 in pre-
treatment obese subjects may be driven by ChREBP. In contrast, af-
ter bariatric surgery-induced weight loss, we would expect hepatic
ChREBP activity to decline. Thus, it may no longer be a major driver of
either basal glucose production or FGF21, leading to the loss of cor-
relation between these two parameters.
Another finding that raises an interesting hypothesis is the observation
that basal and stimulated FGF21 levels correlated positively with basal
lipolysis in treatment-naive obese subjects and negatively in post-
bariatric subjects. However, FGF21 is known to have pleiotropic ef-
fects on adipose tissue function [61], and our results suggest that the
actions of FGF21 on adipose tissue may be dependent on the metabolic
state. This may seem surprising, but the possibility that FGF21 has
distinct effects in different metabolic states has previously been sug-
gested [24,62]. Potentially consistent with this, it has been reported
that exogenous FGF21 suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis (which re-
duces FFA release) in some [63,64], but not in all studies [65].
The acute increase in circulating FGF21 following fructose ingestion
suggests that FGF21 may mediate whole-body homeostatic actions in
response to a nutritional challenge. Notably, fructose ingestion also
suppresses plasma FFA levels in healthy humans, suggesting inhibition
of adipose tissue lipolysis, but the signaling mechanism is unknown
[66]. Since very little absorbed fructose enters the systemic circulation
after first-pass through the liver [18,67] and the circulating insulin
response to ingested fructose is relatively small [30], it is likely that
another unknown signal mediates this antilipolytic effect of fructose.
Further studies are needed to establish if fructose-induced FGF21
secretion might participate in this. Nevertheless, our results are
consistent with the hypothesis that treatment-naive obese subjects are
resistant to FGF21’s antilipolytic action, whereas the link between
FGF21 and lipolysis may be restored in post-bariatric subjects.
We acknowledge that the observational design of our study does not
allow us to make causal conclusions regarding the effects of FGF21. In
this
regard,
we
highlight
that
fructose
tolerance
tests
and
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies reflect vastly different
metabolic states. The observed associations between results from
these discrete states do not imply a direct relationship. In addition,
gastric bypass surgery is designed so nutrients bypass the duodenum
and proximal jejunum [68]. Although the intestinal fructose transporter
GLUT5 is strongly expressed in the distal small intestine [69], we
cannot rule out that fructose absorption was enhanced or reduced after
surgery. We also note that plasma insulin concentrations during step 1
and 2 of the clamp were lower after bariatric surgery, likely due to
increased insulin clearance after surgery [70]. Our results, however,
did not differ when all analyses were repeated using insulin-corrected
fluxes.
5. CONCLUSIONS
We show that fructose ingestion stimulates FGF21 secretion in an
endocrine pattern in morbidly obese humans. This fructose-FGF21
responsiveness is exaggerated in subjects with poor metabolic
health as reflected by the associations with elevated EGP, increased
lipolysis, and insulin resistance. Finally, we demonstrate that the
FGF21 response to fructose persists in post-bariatric subjects. This
work adds to the growing body of evidence that links fructose ingestion
to FGF21 signaling and systemic metabolism. Further studies are
needed to establish if FGF21 signaling is physiologically involved in
fructose metabolism and metabolic health.
