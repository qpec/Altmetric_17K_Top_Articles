Context: It is imperative that novel approaches to treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are devised.
Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate whether addition of dapagliflozin to
insulin and liraglutide results in a significant reduction in glycemia and body weight.
Design: This was a randomized clinical trial.
Setting: The study was conducted at a single academic medical center.
Participants: Participants included T1D patients on liraglutide therapy for at least last 6 months.
Intervention: Thirty T1D patients were randomized (in 2:1 ratio) to receive either dapagliflozin 10
mg or placebo daily for 12 weeks.
Main Outcome Measure: Change in mean glycated hemoglobin after 12 weeks of dapagliflozin
when compared with placebo was measured.
Results: In the dapagliflozin group, glycated hemoglobin fell by 0.66% � 0.08% from 7.8% �
0.21% (P � .01 vs placebo), whereas it did not change significantly in the placebo group from
7.40% � 0.20% to 7.30% � 0.20%. The body weight fell by1.9 � 0.54kg (P � .05 vs placebo). There
was no additional hypoglycemia (blood glucose � 3.88 mmol/L; P � .52 vs placebo). In the dapa-
gliflozin group, there were significant increases in the plasma concentrations of glucagon by
35% � 13% (P � .05), hormone-sensitive lipase by 29% � 11% (P � .05), free fatty acids by 74%�32%
(P � .05), acetoacetate by 67% � 34% (P � .05), and �-hydroxybutyrate by 254% � 81% (P � .05). Urinary
ketone levels also increased significantly (P � .05). None of these changes was observed in the placebo
group. Two patients in the dapagliflozin group developed diabetic ketoacidosis.
Conclusions: Addition of dapagliflozin to insulin and liraglutide in patients with T1D results in a
significant improvement in glycemia and weight loss while increasing ketosis. If it is decided to use
this approach, then it must be used only by a knowledgeable patient along with an endocrinologist
who is well versed with it. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 3506–3515, 2016)
I
n view of the fact that an overwhelming majority of
patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are not at the gly-
cemic goal of a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than
7% (53 mmol/mmol), it is imperative that novel ap-
proaches to its treatment are devised (1, 2). We and others
have recently used liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) receptor agonist, to improve glycemic control in
these patients (1–7). These agents have potent effects on
glucose homeostasis, independently of �-cell stimulation.
These �-cell-independent effects include the suppression

 of appetite, the slowing of gastric emptying, and the sup-
pression of glucagon (5–7). Sodium-glucose co-transporter-
2 (SGLT2) inhibitors block renal tubular reabsorption of
glucose, induce glycosuria, and thus lower blood glucose
concentrations. Indeed, short-term preliminary studies
have already shown significant improvements in the gly-
cemic levels in T1D patients after the use of these agents
(8–11). A recent case series reported seven cases of eugly-
cemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with T1D
on SGLT-2 inhibitor canagliflozin (12). A phase 2 trial
also showed increased incidence of DKA (4.3%, 6.0%,
0%) with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg vs placebo (13).
DKA in this setting is believed to be due to a potential
SGLT2inhibitor-associatedincreaseinglucagon,elevated
free fatty acids (FFAs) inducing insulin resistance, and in-
adequate insulin to suppress hepatic ketogenesis in the
setting of an acute illness and inadequate carbohydrate
intake. However, this complication is absent in patients
with T1D treated with liraglutide despite reductions in
insulin doses. Preliminary data from another study also
showed that liraglutide suppresses ketogenesis acutely
(14).
In view of the above, we hypothesized that the addition
of dapagliflozin, another SGLT-2 inhibitor to insulin and
liraglutide (ie, triple therapy in T1D), would result in fur-
ther improvement in glycemia without an increase in glu-
cagon concentrations and mediators of ketosis.
Materials and Methods
This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, phase IV study conducted from August 2015 to
December 2015 at the Diabetes and Endocrinology Center of
Western New York at the University at Buffalo. The local insti-
tutional review board approved the study protocol. The trial is
registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (number NCT02518945).
All patients provided written informed consent.
Patients were eligible for enrollment in the trial if they were
adults 18–75 years of age with T1D; fasting c-peptide less than
0.1 nmol/L; on insulin therapy either via continuous subcutane-
ous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple (four or more) injections
of insulin per day for more than 12 months with or without a
history of diabetic ketoacidosis. All were on liraglutide therapy
at maximal tolerated doses for at least 6 months prior to start of
the study and were willing to use continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM). All had an HbA1c of 9.2% or less (97 mmol/mmol) and
were well versed with carbohydrate counting. Exclusion criteria
were T1D for less than 12 months; a coronary event or procedure
(myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass,
surgery or coronary angioplasty) in the previous 3 months; he-
patic disease (transaminase � 3 times normal) or cirrhosis; renal
impairment (serum creatinine � 1.5 mg/dL); HIV- or hepatitis
C-positive status; any other life-threatening, noncardiac disease;
a history of pancreatitis; a history of bladder cancer; a history of
gastroparesis; a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or mul-
tiple endocrine neoplasia 2 syndrome; a family history of mul-
tiple endocrine neoplasia 2, a family history of medullary thyroid
cancer, or a previous history of medullary thyroid cancer;
women who were pregnant or of child-bearing potential not
using adequate contraception; participation in any other con-
current clinical trial; use of an investigational agent or therapeu-
tic regimen within 30 days of study; and an inability to give
informed consent.
Patients who met the criteria were assigned a number by a
computerized random number generation program (Microsoft
office [Excel]) and randomized (in 2:1 ratio, drug: placebo) to
receive either dapagliflozin 10 mg (20 patients) or placebo (10
patients) daily for 12 weeks. Ninety percent of the randomized
patients initiated liraglutide treatment as a part of a research
study at our center investigating its effects over a period of 6
months, and it was subsequently continued in our clinic setting.
The remaining 10% initiated liraglutide treatment at our
clinic. The subjects, study coordinators, and investigators who
were involved in adjusting insulin and dapagliflozin doses were
blinded to the treatment.
Allpatientswereseenbyaregistereddietitiantoensureaccurate
recording of carbohydrate and dietary intake. All patients were
advised to monitor their capillary blood glucose by finger stick be-
fore each meal and at bedtime and to wear their CGM for the entire
duration of the study. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were
made before and at the end of the study to assess glycosuria and
ketonuria. Patients in the drug arm started on 5 mg of daily for 1
week followed by 10 mg daily of dapagliflozin for 11 weeks. Pa-
tients were seen weekly for the first 3 weeks, every 2 weeks until
week 10, and then every week until the completion of the study at
12 weeks. Insulin doses were titrated to maintain target glucose
concentrations between 3.8 and 8.8 mmol/L. All patients were ed-
ucated to maintain adequate hydration, avoid alcohol use, and not
miss their insulin dose.
All patients were blinded to their CGM (DEXCOM G4 sys-
tem) including the patients who were already using unblinded
CGM because CGM use alone has been shown to improve gly-
cemiccontrol,andthismayunderminetheeffectsofdapagiflozin
(15). Furthermore, we undertook this step to ensure that all pa-
tients had similar data availability from finger stick glucose tests.
We have previously found that the provision of CGM, especially
to novices, leads to frequent interference/variations in insulin
rates. All patients were allowed to see the downloaded CGM
reports at the end of their weekly or two-weekly visits, and this
was discussed with them along with their finger stick blood glu-
cose concentrations and food diaries for patients on multiple
daily injections (MDIs). In addition, the downloaded insulin
pump reports were also discussed with patients on CSII. None of
the randomized patients were on Enlite 530 G System with
threshold suspend.
Average weekly glucose, fasting glucose, SD, and percentage
time spent in different glycemic thresholds were obtained from
CGM. Insulin doses, carbohydrate intake (grams), and carbohy-
drate helpings (frequency of eating) were obtained from insulin
pump and patient food/insulin dose/blood glucose diaries for pa-
tients on CSII and MDIs, respectively. These parameters were mea-
sured every week, whereas blood pressure (BP) was measured at
weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12. BP was measured manually
after 10 minutes in sitting position and average of three BP readings
were obtained at each visit. The SD in CGM represents the vari-
ability of blood glucose concentrations.

 The primary end point of the study was the change in mean
HbA1c after 12 weeks of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo.
The change in insulin dose, percentage time spent in different
glycemic ranges (3.8–8.8 mmol/L, ie, 70–160 mg/dL; 8.8–13.3
mmol/L, ie, 160–240 mg/dL; 13.3–22.25 mmol/L, ie, 240–400
mg/dL; 3.05–3.88 mmol/L, ie, 55–70 mg/dL; �3.05 mmol/L, ie,
55 mg/dL), SD (measure of variability in blood glucose concen-
trations), body weight, systolic BP, carbohydrate intake, and the
mediators of ketosis were secondary end points.
Plasma and urine measurements
Serum and plasma samples were prepared from whole blood
within 30 minutes and stored at �80°C until analysis. Urine (24 h)
samples were centrifuged and clear supernatant stored at �80°C
until analysis. Ketone bodies were measured using commercially
available kits for �-hydroxybutyrate (Cayman Chemicals) and for
acetoacetate (Biovision,). Glucose levels were measured in plasma
by YSI 2300 STAT Plus glucose analyzer (Yellow Springs Instru-
ments). FFA levels were measured by a colorimetric assay (Roche).
Glucagon was measured using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems Inc)
fromsamplescollectedinandproteaseinhibitorcocktail(Sigma)to
prevent GLP-1 and other peptide degradations. A hormone-sensi-
tive lipase (HSL) assay in plasma was measured using an ELISA
(LifeSpan Biosciences, Inc).
Statistical methods
There are no previous randomized studies that have examined
the effects of dapagliflozin as additional treatments to insulin and
liraglutide in patients with T1D. Conservatively estimating a dif-
ferenceinmeanHbA1c(theprimaryendpoint)of0.5%beforeand
after the treatment, and a sample size of 30 (2:1 drug to placebo
ratio)shouldprovideadequatepower(��.8)todetectasignificant
difference(��.05)providedthestandarddeviationoftheresiduals
in not greater than 0.4%. The sample size includes an additional
20% to account for the potential dropout.
Data are presented as mean � SEM. The combination of dapa-
gliflozin, liraglutide, and insulin is referred to as the triple therapy.
Final analysis was done based on an intention-to-treat principle. A
Student’s t test was used to compare baseline characteristics (Table
1) of the two groups (dapagliflozin and placebo groups) and to
compare the change in mean weekly blood glucose concentrations,
percentage of time spent in different glycemic thresholds, insulin
doses, body weight, body mass index (BMI), carbohydrate intake,
and BP in the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo. A �2 test
was used to test difference in proportions and frequency of hypo-
glycemic episodes. Changes in these end points were calculated by
averaging the differences in weekly average values from baseline.
Pearson correlation was used to test the relationships among vari-
ables. All end points were normally distributed. A value of P � .05
was considered significant. SPSS Software (SPSS, Inc) was used for
analysis.
Results
Twenty-six patients completed the study (placebo � 9,
10% dropout rate; dapagliflozin � 17, 15% dropout
rate). Baseline characteristics of study subjects are pre-
sented in Table 1. Both groups had similar age, duration
of T1D, BMI, glycemic control, total insulin dose, and BP.
All patients had a history of at least one previous episode
of DKA. All randomized patients had nondetectable
C-peptide concentrations and were on CSII with insulin
pumps except one in the placebo group on MDIs. All ran-
domized patients, except two were on 1.8 mg of liraglutide
for 7 � 1 months. Two patients were on 1.2 mg of lira-
glutide. There were 24 Caucasian, one African American,
and one Asian patient.
Effect of triple therapy on glycemic control
HbA1c in triple therapy group fell by 0.66% � 0.08%
(7.2 � 0.9 mmol/mmol) and the dapagliflozin group from
7.8%�0.21%(62�2.3mmol/mmol)(P�.01vsplacebo),
whereas there was no significant change in the placebo
group (from 7.40% � 0.20%, ie, 57 � 2.2 mmol/mmol, to
7.30% � 0.20%, ie, 56 � 2.2 mmol/mmol).
The mean weekly glucose concentration fell in the triple
therapy group by 0.83 � 0.33 mmol/L, ie, 15 � 6 mg/dL
(P � .05 vs baseline, P � .07 vs placebo), with no significant
change in placebo group. The incidence of hypoglycemia,
defined as glucose less than 55 mg/dL, remained unchanged
in the placebo and triple therapy groups at 0% and 3%,
respectively, whereas that in the range of 55–70 mg/dL re-
mained unchanged at 4% and 7%, respectively (Tables 1
and 2). There was no severe hypoglycemic episode requiring
hospitalization or urgent medical attention in both groups
(Table 2). The change in HbA1c was related to the baseline
HbA1c (r � 0.87, P � .0001) in the triple therapy group.
Change in plasma glucose was related to a change in gluca-
gon (r � 0.50; P � .05) in the triple therapy group.
The mean absolute total insulin dose (Tables 1 and 2)
remained unchanged in both groups. When adjusted for
body weight, the total insulin dose remained unchanged also
in the placebo and triple therapy groups at 0.6 � 0.1 U/kg
and 0.7 � 0.1 U/kg, respectively, both at baseline and at 12
weeks.Thecorrectionalbolusdoseofinsulinintripletherapy
group was diminished but not significantly (from 5.2 � 1.9
to 3.0 � 0 U, P � .14, vs baseline; P � NS vs placebo).
Effect on mediators of ketosis, ketones, and
glycosuria
There was a significant increase in fasting glucagon
concentrations by 35% � 13% (from 91 � 12 to 114 �
19 pg/mL, P � .05), HSL by 29% � 11% (from 4.95 �
0.66to6.32�0.75ng/mL,P�.05),FFAsby74%�32%
(from 0.34 � 0.04 to 0.59 � 0.11 mM; P � .05), aceto-
acetate by 67% � 34% (from 0.32 � 0.09 to 0.53 � 0.11
mM, P � .05), and �-hydroxybutyrate by 254% � 81%
(from 0.11 � 0.02 to 0.39 � 0.09 mM, P � .05), whereas
there was no change in the placebo group (Figure 1, A–E).
Glycerol trended higher (from 11.2 � 2.4 to 13.6 � 3.5
mg/L, P � NS) in the triple therapy group, whereas there

 was no change in the plasma bicarbonate concentrations.
Urinary total ketone (acetoacetate and �-hydroxybu-
tyrate) levels also increased significantly from 0.68 � 0.19
to 1.28 � 0.34 �M/mg creatinine (P � .05, Figure 1F).
Fasting serum �-hydroxybutyrate levels were related to
FFA concentrations (r � 0.374, P � .05) and inversely to
total insulin dose at 12 weeks (r � �0.297, P � .05) but
not to HSL or glucagon levels. Changes in mean the FFA
concentrations were related to a change in the mean glu-
cagon (r � 0.51, P � .05) and a change in mean �-hy-
droxybutyrate (r � 0.76, P � .001).
Twenty-four-hour urinary glucose increased by 66.9 �
4.7 g/d from a baseline of 2.4 g/d (P � .001) after dapa-
gliflozin when compared with 2.1 � 1.1 g/d in the placebo
group in whom it remained unchanged. Urinary volume
increased by 500 � 140 mL/d (P � .01).

liraglutide previously, she had experienced a marked reduc-
tion in total insulin dose (from 48 U, ie, 0.56 U/kg to 33 U,
ie, 0.45 U/kg). With the addition of dapagliflozin 5 mg, in-

liraglutide.
Patient B (Figure 2B)
For this patient with hyperglycemic DKA, she reported
not feeling well with nausea 3–4 hours after taking 10 mg
of dapagliflozin and subsequently began vomiting, which
continued until the next day. Blood glucose levels fluctu-
ated between 50 and 300 mg/dL throughout this day (Fig-

it consistently read high (Figure 2B, single pointed arrow),
and she also felt weak and dizzy upon walking. She was
severely hyperglycemic for approximately 30 hours before
she decided to go to the hospital emergency department
where DKA was diagnosed and she was treated with iv

 fluids and insulin. Her total insulin dose had fallen from
32.5 U to 26 U while on liraglutide treatment (but un-
changed in terms of units per kilogram at 0.5 U/kg daily).
After the addition of dapagliflozin, the total dose re-
mained unchanged at 26 U (0.5 U/kg). Her carbohydrate
intake had remained essentially unchanged at around
162 � 40 g while on liraglutide and with subsequent ad-
dition of dapagliflozin. She had 12 kg weight loss with
liraglutide.
Two female patients in the dapagliflozin group had one
episode of genital mycotic infection each, which was
treated with fluconazole.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate clearly that the addition of dapa-
gliflozin to the combination of liraglutide and insulin
(triple therapy) over a period of 12 weeks resulted in ad-
ditionalimprovementinglycemiccontrolwithareduction
in HbA1c of 0.66% (7.2 mmol/mmol), a fall in mean
blood glucose concentration with no significant increase
in hypoglycemia (�3.88 mmol/L, ie, 70 mg/dL). This
could, in part, be due to marked improvements in hyper-
glycemic spikes after the induction of glycosuria with da-
pagliflozin. In addition to the improvement in glycemia,
there was weight loss of 1.9 kg. The dose of insulin did not
diminish significantly in the entire group, except in one
patient, who later developed DKA. Blood pressure did not
change either.
Our data also show that the addition of dapagliflozin to
insulin and liraglutide was associated with DKA in two
patients. This is consistent with the recent reports of DKA
after the use of other SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with
T1D. To analyze further the pathogenesis of this phenom-
enon, we investigated whether they had an increase in
lipolysis and ketogenesis, especially in view of the fact that
the administration of this drug has been shown to induce
hyperglucagonemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mel-
litus(16).Indeed,wefoundthatthefastingconcentrations
of glucagon, HSL, FFAs, glycerol, acetoacetate, and �-hy-
droxybutyrate were increased significantly after the ad-
ministration of dapagliflozin. It would thus appear that da-
pagliflozin-triggered glucagon release induced an increase in
HSL, which, in turn, induced lipolysis and an increase in
FFAs, which provided the substrate for ketogenesis at the
hepatic level. The magnitude of the increase in acetoacetate
concentrations was approximately 67%, whereas that of
�-hydroxybutyratewasbygreaterthan250%overthebase-
line,paralleledbyincreasesinurinaryacetoacetateand�-hy-
droxybutyrate concentrations. The concentrations of aceto-
acetate and �-hydroxybutyrate were still far below those
observed in DKA. The fact that both plasma and urinary
ketone concentrations increased simultaneously implies that
ketogenesis increased markedly, contrary to the suggestion
that ketosis may be due to a diminution in urinary ketone
excretion (17). Despite the increase in glucagon induced by
dapagliflozin in triple therapy, liraglutide is still working
through the suppression of appetite and possibly an insulin-
sensitizing action (3, 7, 18).
The limitation of our study is that patients who were on
unblinded CGM prior to start of study were blinded dur-
ing the study period, which may potentially increase the
incidence of hypoglycemia; however, it was not seen in our
study. Furthermore, the outcomes in those who were
blinded after having been on CGM before were not dif-
ferent from those given blinded CGM for the first time.
The mechanism explaining less hypoglycemia despite
good glycemic control in triple therapy group is unclear
and needs further investigation.
The two patients who developed ketoacidosis had sig-
nificant reductions in insulin doses while on liraglutide
therapy,evenpriortoaddingdapagliflozin,andthisfactor
probably contributed to enhanced ketogenesis and even-
tual ketoacidosis. We therefore posit that the pathogenesis
of DKA in these patients was due to the ketogenic effect of
dapagliflozin, which was accelerated further by the lack of
insulin, inadequate carbohydrate intake, and a precipitat-
ing infectious illness in one of our two patients. These
factorsmayalsoberelevanttotheoccurrenceofDKAwith
other drugs of this class, canagliflozin and empagliflozin.
We had used a dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin to maximize its
therapeutic benefit, but because of the potential ketogen-
esis, which could be dose dependent, we suggest using
lower doses of SGLT2 inhibitors in T1D. It is relevant that
in our large series of patients with T1D treated with the
combination of insulin and liraglutide, we have observed
no increase in DKA despite a reductions in insulin doses.
In fact, our recent data show that even a single dose of
liraglutide has an inhibitory effect on ketogenesis (14). It
would thus appear that the ketogenic effect of dapagli-
flozin overwhelms the suppressive action of liraglutide on
this process.
The combination of a reduction in glycemia and body
weight implies a reversal in two cardinal features of the
metabolic syndrome and hence should result in the overall
cardiovascular risk in these patients in addition to the risk
for microvascular complications. However, there was a
small increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations. In this
context, it is relevant to mention that empagliflozin, an-
other SGLT2 inhibitor, has recently been shown to be
effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality (19) and the
deterioration of diabetic nephropathy (20). Whether da-

 pagliflozin also has such an effect is currently the subject
of investigation.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the addition
of dapagliflozin to insulin and liraglutide results in a sig-
nificant improvement in glycemia as reflected in both
HbA1c and glucose concentrations as assessed by CGM.
In addition, there is significant weight loss. These actions
provide the basis for further larger prospectively con-
trolled trials to establish the use of this combination in the
treatment of this condition. However, there is also a con-
comitant increase in plasma glucagon concentrations,
HSL, lipolysis, FFA concentrations, and ketogenesis, with
an increase in acetoacetate and �-hydroxybutyrate con-
centrations. This metabolic milieu in association with
marked reductions in insulin doses may set the stage for
DKA. A better understanding of these mechanisms will
allow us to further understand the strategy for the effective
and safe use of these agents in T1D without the occurrence
of untoward side effects like DKA.
