SUMMARY
Recent advances in 3D culture systems have led to
the generation of brain organoids that resemble
different human brain regions; however, a 3D orga-
noid model of the midbrain containing functional
midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons has not
been reported. We developed a method to differen-
tiate human pluripotent stem cells into a large multi-
cellular organoid-like structure that contains distinct
layers of neuronal cells expressing characteristic
markers of human midbrain. Importantly, we de-
tected electrically active and functionally mature
mDA neurons and dopamine production in our 3D
midbrain-like organoids (MLOs). In contrast to hu-
man mDA neurons generated using 2D methods or
MLOs generated from mouse embryonic stem cells,
our human MLOs produced neuromelanin-like gran-
ules that were structurally similar to those isolated
from human substantia nigra tissues. Thus our
MLOs bearing features of the human midbrain may
provide a tractable in vitro system to study the hu-
man midbrain and its related diseases.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to make functional neural cells from human pluripo-
tent stem cells (hPSCs) provides a unique opportunity to study
human brain development and neurological disorders. Despite
much progress, most protocols used to differentiate hPSCs
into neurons are based on 2D methods that are unlikely to reca-
pitulate the complexity and function of 3D in vivo neural circuits
(Sasai, 2013). These limitations have prompted the development
of 3D organoid models that mimic the organization and function
of brain parts using hPSCs (Lancaster et al., 2013; Mariani et al.,
2015; Muguruma et al., 2015; Pas
¸ca et al., 2015; Qian et al.,
2016). In contrast to single-cell-type cultures, organoids consist
of multiple cell types that self-organize spatially and can display
enhanced cellular maturation and functionality, possibly due to
the more appropriate 3D niche environment (Kelava and Lancas-
ter, 2016).
Extensive research has focused on generating midbrain dopa-
minergic (mDA) neurons from hPSCs in recent years particularly
because the selective loss of mDA neurons is a key pathological
feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Grealish et al., 2014). Here,
we report a method for differentiating hPSCs into human
midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs) that recapitulate features of
the midbrain and may be useful as a model for studying midbrain
function and dysfunction.
RESULTS
Generation and Characterization of hMLOs from hPSCs
To generate midbrain organoids, we applied a guided self-orga-
nizing principle to hPSC culture. First, human embryonic stem
cells (hESCs) were dissociated to single cells to form uniformly
sized (approximately 400 mm in diameter) embryoid bodies
(EBs) in low-attachment, V-shaped 96-well dishes (Figure 1A).

 To promote neuroectodermal differentiation toward a floor plate,
these EBs were simultaneously treated with dual-SMAD inhibi-
tion factors (Noggin and SB431542) and a Wnt pathway activator
(CHIR99021). The resulting EBs were patterned toward a mesen-
cephalic fate upon addition of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and FGF8
(Arenas, 2014; Chambers et al., 2009; Kirkeby et al., 2012) (Fig-
ure 1A). At day 7, nascent neural organoids expressed markers
of mDA progenitors such as FOXA2, OTX2, CORIN, and
LMX1A (Figure S1A). Subsequently, each neuroectodermal
spheroid was embedded in Matrigel to promote growth and
organization in 3D (Figure 1A) and then transferred to a tissue
culture plate containing neuronal media supplemented with neu-
rotrophic factors (Figure 1A). The organoids were cultured in this
manner on an orbital shaker until the day of analysis. These neu-
ral organoids grew to more than 2 mm in diameter in 30 days and
contained multiple neuroepithelia (Figures 1A, S1B, and S1C).
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that these neuroepithe-
lia exhibited apical-basal polarity based on the localization of
atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) (Figures S1D and S1E). Ki67+
proliferating cells and MAP2+ neurons were detected at the api-
cal and the basal surface, respectively (Figure 1B). FACS anal-
ysis revealed that the percentage of Ki67+ cells decreased
from 51% at day 25 to 19% at day 35; conversely, the proportion
of MAP2+ cells increased 3.6-fold (Figure 1C). These data indi-
cate that cells in the hMLOs gradually transitioned from prolifer-
ating neuroprogenitors to post-mitotic mature neurons. To
further characterize the developing midbrain neuroepithelia, we
labeled proliferating progenitor cells with EdU and stained for
OTX2, a transcription factor that separates the midbrain from
the hindbrain. OTX2 expression was observed in cells within
the apical surface and extended to the intermediate region
of the neuroepithelia (Figure 1D). Approximately 80% of all cells
were OTX2+ and 35% of the cells within neuroepithelia were dou-
ble positive for EdU and OTX2 (Figure 1E), demonstrating that
proliferating cells near the apical region of hMLOs were midbrain
progenitors.
Next, we examined the cytoarchitecture of the neural organo-
ids at day 35. Similar to the layering of the murine embryonic
midbrain floor plate that eventually gives rise to mDA neurons
(Baizabal and Covarrubias, 2009), the hMLOs at day 35 showed
three layers: the proliferative ventral zone (VZ), where neural pro-
genitors reside; the intermediate zone (IZ), which immature mDA
neurons pass through as they migrate ventrally; and the mantle
zone (MZ), where maturing mDA neurons begin to express genes
associated with the synthesis of dopamine (DA) (Figure 1F). In
the VZ and IZ, the midbrain progenitors expressed MASH1 and
OTX2 (Figures 1G and 1H). We also detected the orphan nuclear
receptor NURR1, which is expressed in post-mitotic mDA pro-
genitors, in the IZ (Figure 1I) (Arenas et al., 2015). These data
suggest that the features of our in vitro hMLOs are similar to
those of early in vivo midbrains in the aspect of developing neu-
roectoderm toward floor plate.
Identification and Verification of mDA Neurons in hMLOs
Several studies have demonstrated that FOXA2, a floor plate
marker, identifies neuronal progenitors that eventually become
mDA neurons (Sasaki et al., 1997). We observed FOXA2 expres-
sion in developing hMLOs as early as day 4 (Figure 1J). Intrigu-
ingly, at day 14, FOXA2 expression became restricted to specific
domains within the neuroepithelia, and by day 24, FOXA2-ex-
pressing cells presumably had migrated radially to the MZ (Fig-
ure 1J), where they began to express tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH), a defining marker of DA neurons. Indeed at day 45 the ma-
jority of FOXA2+ cells (54%) also expressed TH (Figures 1K and
1L). Given that some ventral forebrain progenitors could also ex-
press FOXA2 (Liu and Zhang, 2011), we sought to examine the
expression of other mDA neuroprogenitor markers such as
LMX1A and OTX2 together with FOXA2 in the hMLOs at day
14 and 45. We observed that 22% of cells at day 14 were double
positive for LMX1A and OTX2 (Figures S1F and S1G). At day 45,
38% of all cells were LMX1A+, and most of them (81%) were also
FOXA2+ (Figures S1H and S1I). We further observed that a major
fraction of LMX1A+ cells (58%) expressed TH at this time (Fig-
ures 1M and 1N). These data strongly suggest that the majority
of TH+ neurons in the hMLOs likely originated from FOXA2+
and LMX1A+ progenitors, which were a subset of OTX2+ cells.
In addition, we observed robust expression of the mDA markers
in hMLOs by qPCR (Figure S1J). Taken together, these data
demonstrated a time-dependent induction of floor plate precur-
sors and their subsequent differentiation into TH+ mDA neurons
within the developing hMLOs.
To further quantify the neuronal populations within the hMLOs,
we conducted FACS analysis. At day 35, 6% of the MAP2+ neu-
rons in hMLOs co-expressed TH, and the number increased
significantly to 22% by day 60 (Figures S1K–S1M). Approxi-
mately 29% were also positive for DA transporter (DAT) (Figures
1O and 1P). Intriguingly, at day 60, we observed that some of the
TH+ neurons were also positive for GIRK2 (G protein-gated
inwardly rectifying K+ channel 2), which is an important protein
with enriched expression in A9 subtype mDA neurons (Fig-
ure S1N). In addition, we observed occasional cells double-pos-
itive for TH and Calbindin, suggesting that they are likely to be

 A10-like subtype mDA neurons (Figure S1O). In sum, these data
suggest that our neural organoids, after long-term culturing, pro-
duced A9-like mDA neurons which expressed TH, DAT, and
GIRK2.
Transcriptional Characterization of hMLOs
While the hMLOs consist of DA neurons that are typical of
midbrain tissue, the cellular heterogeneity and structure of the
organoid culture might allow us to model aspects that cannot
be studied using 2D culture. To investigate this hypothesis, we
generated gene expression profiles for our organoid model sys-
tem and 2D-grown mDA neurons (Figures S2A–S2D). Indeed, a
large number of genes show differential expression between
hMLOs and 2D-DA neurons (Figure 2A, Table S1). To test if the
differences of hMLOs and 2D-DA neurons in transcriptomes
reflect an upregulation of genes characteristic of brain develop-
ment, we performed RNA-seq analyses from 10 human prenatal
midbrain samples. A cluster analysis using the differentially ex-
pressed genes between hMLOs and 2D-DA neurons suggest
that the hMLOs indeed show upregulation of genes that are
expressed in human prenatal midbrain samples (Figure 2B).
The genes that are differentially expressed in hMLOs compared
to 2D-DA neurons significantly overlapped with differentially
expressed genes in prenatal midbrain compared to 2D-DA neu-
rons (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2E and Table S2, decreased expres-
sion: p = 2.2e�248; increased expression: p = 4.13e�313).
Among the genes, which are expressed in hMLOs and prenatal
midbrain, but not in 2D-DA neurons, were those genes ex-
pressed in additional cell types, such as OLIG3 (oligodendrocyte
gene) and SLC1A3 (glial cell gene) (Figure 2E). mDA neuron-spe-
cific genes were commonly expressed in all samples (Figure 2F).
A comparison with publicly available 2D-DA neuron expression
data (Lin et al., 2016) and data from adult midbrain, forebrain,
and hindbrain (Consortium, 2015) further suggests that hMLOs
are closer to prenatal midbrain (Figure S2F). Together, this anal-
ysis of transcriptome profiles indicates that hMLOs indeed
resemble aspects of gene expression profiles of prenatal
midbrain that appear to be absent from mDA neurons generated
by the conventional 2D method.
Identification of Neuromelanin and A9-like mDA
Neurons in Human MLOs
During the long-term culture of the hMLOs, we observed sparse,
black/brown-colored deposits in hMLOs by light microscopy
after approximately 2 months. Furthermore, the number of these
deposits gradually increased over time (Figure 3A). We hypothe-
sized that these dark deposits were neuromelanin (NM), which
are insoluble, black/brown granular pigments that accumulate
in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in humans and pri-
mates (Sulzer et al., 2000). To test this hypothesis, we performed
Fontana-Masson staining and found that these deposits stained
positive (Figures 3B and S3A). As shown in Figure 3B, large,
rough, and darkly stained granules were observed within the
neuronal cytosol, which were similar to the stained granules in
human postmortem SNpc sections (Figure 3C). Some of these
granules in the hMLOs could be observed outside of neuronal
cells, indicating that these NM granules could be secreted
from mDA neurons within the hMLOs (Figure 3B). In contrast,
we failed to detect Fontana-Masson-positive granules from
2D-DA neurons (Kriks et al., 2011) (data not shown) or human
cerebral organoids (hCOs) (Figures S3B and S3C) grown at a
comparable number of days in vitro. Over time the amount of
NM granules increased drastically (Figure 3D). Importantly,
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) revealed that NM granules isolated from the hMLOs ex-
hibited similar morphological characteristics as those isolated
from human postmortem SNpc tissue (Figures 3E and 3F, Fig-
ures S3D–S3F, and Table S3).
Given that NM is a byproduct of DA synthesis in mDA neurons,
the addition of an exogenous dopamine precursor (L-DOPA) or
DA is expected to accelerate the accumulation of NM in younger
hMLO (Fedorow et al., 2005). Indeed, we observed a robust dis-
tribution of NM-like granules in the hMLOs at day 45 following
a 10-day treatment of L-DOPA (50 mM) or DA (50 mM), whereas
no NM-like granules were observed in untreated hMLOs or
L-DOPA-treated hCOs (Figures 3G and S3G). To determine
whether the NM-containing cells were TH+, we immunostained
adjacent sections from the same hMLO and observed TH+ cells
within the same area that displayed NM-like granules (Figure 3H).
NM-like granules have been observed primarily in primates, but
not in mice (Fedorow et al., 2005). Intriguingly, no NM-like gran-
ules were observed in mouse ESC-derived MLOs (mMLOs) that
contained TH+ neurons (Figure 3H). These data indicated that
only human mDA neurons grown in 3D could produce NM-like
granules in situ.
To further characterize the NM-containing mDA neurons, we
reasoned that NM-containing cells should be an enriched popu-
lation of A9 mDA neurons that are present in SNpc, and we thus
used FACS to sort out NM-containing cells from hMLOs (Figures
S3H and S3I). With this method, we could prospectively isolate
NM+ cells in the hMLOs (approximately 7% of total cells) (Figures
S3J and S3K). We confirmed that isolated NM-containing cells
were enriched with mDA neurons by immnostaining replated
NM+ cells with antibodies against MAP2 and TH (Figure S3L).
We performed reverse-transcription-specific target amplifica-
tion on individual NM+ sorted cells and noted that the vast major-
ity of NM-sorted cells (87%) expressed MAP2, but among these
cells some were negative for TH (Figure S3M), possibly due to
the uptake of extracellularly released NM granules by non-dopa-
minergic neurons. We then focused our analysis on TH+/MAP2+
cells and characterized their subtype identity by the Fluidigm
Biomark Array. Not surprisingly, most cells expressed pan-DA
neuronal markers including EN1/2 (Figure S3N). We also noted
that SNpc-related genes were more highly expressed in NM-
containing cells, compared to ventral tegmental area (VTA)-
related genes (Figure S3N) (Poulin et al., 2014), consistent with
the known association of NM with A9, but not A10, neurons.
Expression of markers indicative of other neuronal lineages
was largely absent (Figure S3O). Collectively, these data indicate
that the NM-containing neurons in the hMLOs preferentially ex-
pressed markers of SNpc, but not VTA, which corroborates
well with our immunostaining data (Figure 1).
Functional Maturation of Dopaminergic Neurons in
hMLOs
To test whether the neurons in the hMLOs were electrically active
and functionally mature, we sliced hMLOs into 350 mm sections
and performed acute, targeted, whole-cell patch recordings

 (Figure 4A) (Pas
¸ca et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2015). In voltage-
clamp mode, neurons within the hMLOs showed fast, inactivat-
ing inward and outward currents, which likely corresponded to
the opening of voltage-dependent sodium (Na+) and potassium
(K+) channels, respectively (Figure 4B). The peak voltage-gated
Na+- and K+-channel currents increased significantly from day
33 to day 65 (Figure 4C). Consistently, we observed a consider-
able decrease in membrane resistance (Rm) and increase in

 membrane capacitance (Cm), and these changes correlated with
the functional maturation of the neurons (Table S4). Action po-
tentials (APs) were elicited when we depolarized the membrane
in current-clamp mode (Figure 4D) and APs could be elicited
from the majority of hMLO neurons (69.23%, n = 26) (Figure 4E
and Table S4). Next, we investigated whether neurons within
the
hMLOs
exhibited
spontaneous
synaptic
transmission
in situ, and we found that most of the recorded neurons showed
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) as well
as spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Figure 4F). In
addition, we observed large-amplitude excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (EPSPs > 20 pA) in response to extracellular electrical
stimulation, demonstrating that the neurons inside the hMLOs
participated in network activity (Figure 4G). More than 20% of
neurons within the hMLOs showed rhythmic discharges, with
an average frequency of 2.78 Hz (Figures 4H and 4I), and
rebound depolarizations resulted in AP generation after short hy-
perpolarization of neurons (Figure 4J), which are characteristics
of mDA neurons (Pfisterer et al., 2011). The application of the
specific D2/D3 receptor agonist quinpirole (1 mM) markedly sup-
pressed the firing of recorded neurons (Figures 4K and 4L), indi-
cating the presence of functional dopamine receptors in mDA
neurons within the hMLOs. Intriguingly, post hoc immunohisto-
chemistry of the recorded neurons (labeled with biocytin) in the
hMLOs revealed that most (n = 8/10) were TH+, indicating that
the recorded neurons were indeed mDA neurons (Figure 4M).
Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
measurements showed that the DA content within hMLOs grad-
ually increased as they matured (Figure 4N). Taken together,
these data indicate that mDA neurons within the hMLOs pro-
duced DA, exhibited mature neuronal properties, and were
able to form synapses with other neurons within the hMLOs.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have demonstrated that hESCs can be steered to
differentiate into midbrain progenitors, which subsequently
self-organize into 3D hMLOs comprising distinct cell layers
with functional mDA neurons, but not the forebrain or the hind-
brain (Figures S2G and S2H). Most approaches that have been
developed so far have utilized 2D monolayer cultures on flat
and rigid substrates to differentiate hPSCs into mDA neurons
(Arenas et al., 2015). Although 2D cell culture has proven to be
a valuable method for cell-based studies, lack of the 3D environ-
ment and multiple cell types has often led to inaccurate cellular
responses and failure to recapitulate important physiological
features of tissue in vivo (Fatehullah et al., 2016).
TH+ neurons in the hMLOs exhibited biochemical and electro-
physiological properties of mature mDA neurons and expressed
functional DA receptors (Figures 4K and 4L). Intriguingly, these
neurons receive inputs from other neuronal cells in the hMLOs,
indicating that they make functional neuronal networks, demon-
strating the potential utility of the hMLO in evaluating the degree
of synaptic competence and connections. In our hMLOs, we
observed other neuronal cells such as GABA+ neurons (Fig-
ure S2I), consistent with in vivo midbrain (Korotkova et al.,
2004). Although our transcriptome analysis showed that the
hMLOs resemble prenatal midbrain and mDA neurons, future
studies using single-cell transcriptome analysis may be required
to further validate the similarity of the genetic expression pro-
gram among them (Camp et al., 2015).
Strikingly, we found that human mDA neurons within 3D MLOs
could produce NM-like granules while human mDA neurons in
2D culture and mouse mDA neurons within 3D MLOs did not.
NM is a dark, complex, and insoluble pigment particularly
concentrated in the mDA neurons of SN and in the noradrenergic
neurons of locus coeruleus, the two brain areas mostly affected
by PD (Fedorow et al., 2005). The origin and physiological func-
tion of NM remain controversial: several lines of evidence have
demonstrated possible protective features of NM; however,
many other studies concluded that NM is a toxic byproduct of
DA synthesis in mDA neurons (Zecca et al., 2003) and that NM
may trigger immune activation in the PD patient’s brain (Zhang
et al., 2011). The paucity of knowledge of NM has been due to
the limited availability/accessibility of human NM, which could
only be extracted from human postmortem midbrain tissues.
Given the robustness of our protocol to generate human mDA
neurons that readily produce NM granules, our 3D hMLOs pro-
vide a source of human DA neuron-derived NM in situ. Thus
our method offers a potentially useful approach to study NM
granules and associated proteins from PD patient-derived
iPSC lines, which may shed light onto the underlying pathophys-
iological mechanisms of PD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture and Generation of hMLOs
The hESC lines H1 (WA01) and H9 (WA09) were cultured feeder-free on Matri-
gel (BD Biosciences) with mTeSR1 (StemCell Technologies, Inc.). hPSC lines
before passage 40 were used to generate hMLOs. The hPSCs were dissoci-
ated to single cells to form uniform EBs in neuronal induction medium supple-
mented with 10 mM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Calbiochem). On day 4, hMLOs
were cultured with the addition of midbrain patterning factors, 100 ng/mL
SHH-C25II (R&D Systems) and 100 ng/mL FGF8 (R&D Systems) for 3 days.
When neuroectodermal buds were starting to extrude, the hMLOs were
embedded in 30 mL of reduced growth factor Matrigel and grown in tissue
growth induction medium containing 100 ng/mL SHH-C25II and 100 ng/mL
FGF8. After 24 hr, the hMLOs were embedded in Matrigel, transferred into
ultra-low-attachment 6-well-plates (Costar) containing the final organoid dif-
ferentiation media, which was supplemented with 10 ng/mL BDNF (Pepro-
tech), 10 ng/mL GDNF (Peprotech), 100 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 125 mM db-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), and cultured using an orbital shaker.
The medium was replenished every 3 days. A detailed protocol of generating
hMLOs is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Human Brain Dissection
The ventral half of the midbrain was dissected from second trimester prenatal
brainstem under visual inspection using a scalpel and hand-held dental drill
(Table S5). Cases were donated with informed consent of the mother and

 were selected on the basis of (1) the absence of any congenital anatomical ab-
normality upon macroscopic brain inspection and (2) the absence of any major
genetic defect noted on prenatal testing. The IRB approval is from the Western
IRB (study number, 1126332; WIRB protocol number, 20111080).
Immunohistochemistry and NM Staining
Immunohistochemistry of all organoids and tissue samples was performed as
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Fontana-Masson
staining to detect NM was performed according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col. A detailed description is available in the Supplemental Experiment
Procedures.
RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis
RNA-seq was performed using hMLOs, 2D-DA neurons, or postmortem
midbrain tissues (Table S5). For RNA-seq analysis, reads were mapped with
TopHat2-2.0.12 (Kim et al., 2013), reads were counted using the R package
GenomicAlignments (Lawrence et al., 2013), and differential expression was
calculated using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). A detailed description is available
in the Supplemental Experiment Procedures.
Electrophysiology
Excitability and synaptic transmission of neurons within hMLOs were studied
by whole-cell patch clamp in either voltage- or current-clamp mode. See also
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
