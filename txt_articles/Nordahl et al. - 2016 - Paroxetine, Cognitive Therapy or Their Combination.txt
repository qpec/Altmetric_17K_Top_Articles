whereas there were no significant differences among combi-
nation treatment, paroxetine alone, and placebo. Recovery 
rates at 12 months were much higher in the CT group (68%) 
compared to 40% in the combination group, 24% in the par-
oxetine group, and 4% in the pill placebo group.  
Conclusions: 
CT was the most effective treatment for SAD at both post-
treatment and follow-up compared to paroxetine and better 
than combined treatment at the 12-month follow-up on the 
Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Combined treatment provid-
ed no advantage over single treatments; rather there was less 
effect of the combined treatment compared to CT alone.

Introduction 
 
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and de-
bilitating condition, with a chronic course if left untreat-
ed  
[1] 
. SAD is best treated with psychotropic medication 
and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT)  
[2] 
. The most 
effective treatments are monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
 
[3] 
, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI/SNRI)  
[4] 
, 
benzodiazepines  
[5] 
, and individual cognitive therapy

Abstract 
 
Background: The most efficacious treatments for social anxi-
ety disorder (SAD) are the SSRIs and cognitive therapy (CT). 
Combined treatment is advocated for SAD but has not been 
evaluated in randomized trials using CT and SSRI. Our aim was 
to evaluate whether one treatment is more effective than the 
other and whether combined treatment is more effective 
than the single treatments.  
Methods: 
 A total of 102 patients 
were randomly assigned to paroxetine, CT, the combination 
of CT and paroxetine, or pill placebo. The medication treat-
ment lasted 26 weeks. Of the 102 patients, 54% fulfilled the 
criteria for an additional diagnosis of avoidant personality
disorder. Outcomes were measured at posttreatment and 
12-month follow-up assessments.  
Results: CT was superior to 
paroxetine alone and to pill placebo at the end of treatment, 
but it was not superior to the combination treatment. At the 
12-month follow-up, the CT group maintained benefits and 
was significantly better than placebo and paroxetine alone,

Paroxetine, Cognitive Therapy and Their 
Combination in SAD

(CT)  
[6] 
. However, a substantial number of patients do 
not respond to drug treatment  
[7] 
, and a meta-analysis 
suggested that severe forms of SAD with avoidant person-
ality features do not respond well to psychological thera-
py  
[8] 
. Davidson et al.  
[9] found that exposure-based 
group CBT was not better than fluoxetine. However, in-
dividual CT  
[10] has been found superior to fluoxetine 
 
[11] 
. CT tested against applied relaxation and exposure 
was found to be more effective than the comparisons  
[12] 
. 
The results of a preliminary study suggest that CT en-
hanced with metacognitive techniques may be particu-
larly efficacious and rapid  
[13] 
.
 
There are 6 randomized trials of combined drug treat-
ment in SAD  
[3, 14–18] but only 2 involve treatments 
with SSRI  
[9, 16] 
. In both of these studies medication was 
combined with exposure-based therapy but not CT  
[19] 
. 
The effects of combining the two most recent approaches 
in the treatment of SAD (CT and SSRI) have not been 
studied in a comprehensive randomized controlled trial. 
A recent meta-analysis showed there is a lack of studies 
combining psychological therapies and SSRI in most anx-
iety disorders  
[20] 
. This stands in contrast to typical clin-
ical practice in SAD where a combination of some form 
of psychosocial treatment and SSRI is common and often 
recommended  
[21] 
.
 
The present study aimed to investigate the compara-
tive efficacy of these main treatments: SSRI (paroxetine), 
CT, and their combination. We compared them over the 
short and the long term (12 months). We aimed to test 
whether one treatment was more effective and whether 
combined treatment was more effective than individual 
treatment. We included patients with an additional avoid-
ant personality disorder (APD) as these are highly com-
mon in samples of SAD. We also included a pill placebo 
with clinical management as the placebo effect is known 
to be high in most anxiety disorders  
[22] 
.
 
Methods 
 
Design and Procedure 
 
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled comparative 
study of patients with primary SAD. Patients with an additional 
APD were included. We used 4 arms consisting of CT, paroxetine 
with clinical management, the combination of CT and paroxetine, 
and a pill placebo with clinical management. In the groups receiv-
ing pills, we applied triple masking, and the patient, the psychia-
trists, and the principle investigator were blinded to which treat-
ment (drug or placebo) was administered. The Anxiety Disorders 
Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV)  
[23] 
 and SCID-II clin-
ical interview  
[24] were used alongside a battery of self-report mea-
sures at pretreatment, posttreatment and the 12-month follow-up.
 
We made two changes to the registered trial protocol. We were 
unable to use the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) due 
to delays in obtaining a necessary authorization, and the Liebowitz 
Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) was substituted instead. Also, the trial 
steering committee decided to drop the 6-month follow-up due to 
lack of capacity to deal with a 6-month assessment that coincided 
with end of treatment assessments.
 
 
The acute treatment phase consisted of 26 weeks of treatment 
with paroxetine or pill placebo, and the CT consisted of 12 ses-
sions, each with a maximum duration of 60 min, with an opportu-
nity for 2 booster sessions (approx. weeks 4 and 8 posttreatment). 
The combination condition consisted of CT for 12 sessions and 
paroxetine for 26 weeks, and during the first 12 weeks the patient 
had both treatments. All patients were assessed after 12 weeks of 
treatment (posttreatment assessment) and at a 12-month follow-
up from the time the treatment ended.
 
The study protocol was approved by the Regional Committee 
for Medical and Health Research Ethics of Central Norway (No. 
REK-018-03), the Norwegian Medicines Agency (SN 04-01998) 
and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate (ClinicalTrials.gov identi-
fier: NCT00184106). All participants had to provide written in-
formed consent before inclusion.
 
Sample and Eligibility Criteria 
 
Participants were referred for treatment at the University Out-
patient Unit, Norwegian University of Science and Technology 
(NTNU), Trondheim, Norway. A total of 236 patients were re-
ferred to the trial. Of these, 102 patients were randomized into the 
4 conditions. A total of 16 patients declined or did not show up at 
the trial after inclusion. The proportion of patients who declined 
or nonattendance at pretreatment was equally distributed among 
the treatment conditions ( 
fig. 1 
).
 
 
Inclusion criteria were as follows: age of 18–65 years, fulfill-
ment of DSM-IV criteria for SAD, and symptoms present for at 
least 6 months. Exclusion criteria were any form of physical dis-
ease, psychotic illness, acute suicidality, a primary diagnosis of ma-
jor depressive disorder, diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder, 
drug or alcohol dependence, and cluster A or cluster B personality 
disorders. Subjects not willing to accept random allocation were 
also excluded. We excluded patients who had been exposed to CT 
or to SSRIs previously in order to eliminate any bias of negative 
expectations to the treatment offered. Participants who were preg-
nant or were planning to become pregnant during the next 6 
months were excluded due to the drug condition.
 
Therapists 
 
The medication-based conditions were administered and man-
aged by two experienced psychiatrists who were specialists in both 
psychopharmacology and psychiatry. Their mean duration of 
practice in psychiatry was 14 years. They received supervision with 
the principal investigator and the psychopharmacologists from St. 
Olav’
s University Hospital on a regular basis once a month. There 
were three therapists in the CT conditions. Their mean length of 
experience with CBT was 15 years. Each underwent extensive 
training in the basic CT protocol for social phobia  
[19] 
, and they 
were trained and supervised by the author of the treatment man-
ual (Adrian Wells). All therapists were trained clinical psycholo-
gists who had peer supervision every 2 weeks during the trial or 
monthly supervision with the originator of the CT protocol. Pro-
tocol adherence (check list) and competency ratings were routine-

ly collected based on video recordings of all sessions. Competency 
was assessed by the protocol author and rated from 0 (no/low 
skills) to 6 (expert level). An overall evaluation indicated good (4) 
and very good (4.5 and 5.5) competency levels for the three 
  
thera-
pists.
 
Randomization and Masking 
 
The participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions. 
The randomization used gender and diagnosis of APD as stratifi-
cation variables in blocks of 10 to ensure equal distribution. The 
randomization lists were kept independently of the principle in-
vestigator, the psychiatrists, and the therapists. Blinding was con-
ducted for the treatment conditions using medication or placebo 
and achieved for the primary outcome measures by using indepen-
dent evaluators who were blinded to the treatment assignment. 
The Department of Clinical Psychopharmacology at St. Olav’
s 
University Hospital administered the allocation sequence and as-
signed the patients to 1 of 4 treatment conditions in a randomized 
allocation format. The participants, independent diagnosticians, 
psychiatrists, and the principal investigator remained blinded to 
the paroxetine alone and pill placebo conditions. In addition, spe-
cific instructions were given to all participants to avoid disclosing 
information about their treatment to the evaluators.
 
Interventions 
 
The medication used was paroxetine (paroxetine hydrochlo-
ride). It was administered as capsules manufactured by the phar-
maceutical laboratory at St. Olav’
s University Hospital to make 
them identical to the placebo. The placebo capsules contained lac-
tose. The paroxetine and the placebo were identical in size, color, 
smell, taste, and appearance. The pharmaceutical laboratory at St. 
Olav’
s University Hospital provided the medication to the psy-

chiatrists. In addition to the medication they received clinical 
management. All patients were educated by the psychiatrists, and 
they provided information about the drugs and the management 
of it. All patients were asked for self-exposure during the psycho-
pharmacological treatment and were able to discuss any problems 
related to drugs or side effects with their psychiatrist.
 
Following the clinical guideline by Stein et al.  
[25] 
, drug treat-
ment was administered over 26 weeks, and tapering of medica-
tions/placebo commenced at week 23, tapering 10 mg per week or 
alternatively 25% of dosage per week. Medication was adminis-
tered adhering to best prescribing practices for social phobia as 
suggested by the manufacturer. The recommended initial dos-
age was 20 mg per day, and minimum–maximum dosage was 20–
60 mg/day. The target range of paroxetine in the blood serum was 
set between 80 and 450 μmol/l. After 4 and 12 weeks of medication, 
blood serum was tested in all patients receiving paroxetine or pill 
placebo to monitor treatment compliance and ensure the target 
range of the drug was achieved. If needed, medication could be ti-
trated upwards by 20 mg/day in steps until reaching the defined 
target level. The laboratory communicated serum levels outside 
the targeted range to the psychiatrist, and medications were added. 
Changes of medications were always counterbalanced in a 1: 
  
1 for-
mat so that changes in dosage were done simultaneously in both 
the active and the placebo arms in order to maintain the blinding 
of the treatment. The mean dosage of paroxetine in the overall 
group was 28 ± 5.5 mg/day.
 
 
The CT protocol for SAD followed the manual based on the 
model of Clark and Wells  
[10] but included specific enhancements 
based on metacognitive therapy   
[13] 
. Thus, there was greater sys-
tematic work on changing attention in social situations, more 
work on eliminating worry and rumination, and metacognitive 
experiments were used in each session, i.e. testing social perfor-
mance while changing attention. Compared to the original version 
of the treatment, there was no work on reality testing underlying 
assumptions and beliefs about the self and social situations, lim-
ited work on imagery, and no work on memories of social situa-
tions. We replaced this with a greater focus on regulating attention 
and reducing threat monitoring. The main treatment elements in 
the manual were (a) developing and sharing a cognitive formula-
tion of the problem, (b) reducing safety behaviors, (c) modifying 
the inner image of self as a social object (video feedback), (d) prac-
ticing external focus of attention in social situations, (e) carrying 
out behavioral experiments to test alternative mental strategies in 
social encounters and (f) using strategies for reducing worry, ru-
mination, and threat monitoring associated with social situations.
 
Assessment and Outcome Measures 
 
Patients were assessed pretreatment, posttreatment at 12 weeks 
(post-acute), and at the 12-month follow-up. Independent evalu-
ators were trained and certified in the rating instruments and 
ADIS-IV and SCID-II assessments. The interrater reliability of the 
independent raters was based on 20 randomly selected video-taped 
assessments. For the diagnosis of SAD the kappa value was κ = 
0.84, and for APD it was κ = 0.80. At posttreatment the evaluators 
were blinded to the treatment condition before reassessment.
 
 
The primary outcome measure was level of symptoms as mea-
sured by the Fear of Negative Evaluation Questionnaire (FNE) 
 
[26] 
. The reliable clinical change index (RCI) was used to establish 
the clinical significance of outcomes after treatment on the FNE 
following the procedure of Jacobson and Truax  
[27] 
.
 
The secondary outcomes assessed anxiety by the LSAS  
[28] and 
the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
[29] 
, which have established va-
lidity for anxiety symptoms. For assessing interpersonal problems 
we used the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64)  
[30] 
. In 
addition, change in APD was measured by rediagnosis and sever-
ity ratings.
 
Power Calculations 
 
Power calculations were based on the FNE (www.statisticalso-
lutions.net), and as the trial aimed to conduct a condition-by-time 
comparison, we weighted the active treatment conditions against 
the control condition (pill placebo). The mean standard deviation 
across trials using FNE is 5.78, and in an inferiority analysis with 
an expected difference, with an effect size of  
d = 0.70 (moderate 
effect), α = 0.05, and β = at least 80%, the minimum number of 
participants in each condition was 18. Based on the calculation and 
an expected attrition rate of 25%, we estimated that the study 
should include at least 80 participants in 4 conditions. The sample 
comprised of 102 participants to increase the likelihood that the 
number exceeded thresholds at follow-up.
 
Data Analytic Strategy 
 
All data were analyzed based on an intention-to-treat ap-
proach, and missing data were treated using last observation car-
ried forward on the primary measure. We used a linear mixed 
model analysis  
[31] 
. Categorical data were analyzed using χ 
2 tests, 
and pretreatment group differences on dimensional self-report 
measures were tested with ANOVA. Primary (FNE) and second-
ary (LSAS, BAI, IIP-64) outcome measures were subject to linear 
mixed model (repeated measures) with treatment condition as the 
between groups factor and time (pretreatment, posttreatment, 
12-month follow-up) as the repeated measures factor. In each case 
the equality of variances of the repeated measures (sphericity) 
could not be assumed and so the Huyn-Feldt correction was ap-
plied. We also ran ANCOVA on the FNE and followed this with 
Sidak’
s pairwise post hoc comparisons on the adjusted means. Be-
tween-group effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (η 
p 
2 
). 
We also computed within-group effect sizes using Cohen’
s  
d and 
determined the clinical significance of findings by applying the 
criteria of Jacobson and Truax  
[27] for defining rates of reliable 
clinical change across groups. Significance in the overall study was 
defined to be α = 0.05. We used IBM SPSS, version 22, to analyze 
the data.
 
Results 
 
Pretreatment scores on the FNE, LSAS, BAI, and IIP-
64 were similar across treatment groups with no statisti-
cal significant difference. Similarly, age, gender, occupa-
tional status, and ethnicity did not differ ( 
table 1 
).
 
Results of the linear mixed-model ANOVAs demon-
strated a significant effect for time on each of the self-re-
port measures – unadjusted scores ( 
table 2 
). There were 
significant interactions between treatment group and 
time on the FNE (F 
4.4, 145.3 = 8.04, p < 0.0005, η 
p 
2 = 0.20),

change across groups by posttreatment. As displayed in 
 
figure 2 
, the within-group analyses showed that in all ac-
tive treatment conditions FNE scores improved signifi-
cantly from pre- to posttreatment and from pretreatment 
to the 12-month follow-up.
 
We conducted ANCOVAs, utilizing pretreatment 
scores on the FNE as covariate, which demonstrated sig-
nificant differences among groups posttreatment on FNE 
scores (F 
3, 97 
 = 8.53, p < 0.0005, η 
p 
2 
 = 0.20) and 12 month 
follow-up FNE score (F 
3, 97 = 7.52, p < 0.0005, η 
p 
2 = 0.19). 
In each case the covariate had an effect posttreatment
(F 
1, 97 = 14.80, p < 0.0005, η 
p 
2 = 0.13) and at follow-up
(F 
1, 97 = 10.89, p = 0.001, η 
p 
2 = 0.10). Sidak’
s corrected 
pairwise tests on the adjusted means showed that at post-
treatment the group receiving CT improved significantly 
more than the paroxetine group (mean difference = 
–6.180, SE = 1.819, p = 0.006, 95% CI: –11.065 to –1.294) 
and the placebo group (mean difference = –9.034, SE = 
1.848, p < 0.0005, 95% CI: –13.998 to –4.071) but was not 
better than the combined treatment (mean difference =

–4.064, p = 0.161). Similarly, the combined treatment 
group improved more than the placebo group (mean dif-
ference = –4.971, SE = 1.784, p = 0.038, 95% CI: –9.763 to 
–0.178), but there were no differences between the com-
bined group and the SSRI group (mean difference = 
–2.116, p = 0.806).
 
At the 12-month follow-up, pairwise tests demonstrat-
ed that CT was more effective than paroxetine (mean dif-
ference = –6.064, SE = 1.850, p = 0.009, 95% CI: –11.033 
to –1.096) and placebo (mean difference = –8.675, SE = 
1.879, p < 0.0005, 95% CI: –13.722 to –3.627). There were 
no differences between CT and the combination (mean 
difference = –4.452, p = 0.107). The combination treat-
ment was no longer more improved than the placebo 
group (mean difference = –4.223, p = 0.125), and there 
were no differences between the combination and the 
SSRI (mean difference = –1.613, p = 0.942). Paroxetine 
and placebo did not differ (mean difference = –2.610, p = 
0.641).
 
Effect Sizes, Reliable Improvement, and Recovery Rates 
 
An effect size  
(d) indicates the magnitude of an ob-
served effect in a standard unit of measurement 
  
[32] 
. In 
order to compare the magnitude of improvement in so-
cial anxiety symptoms, we calculated uncontrolled pre-
treatment to posttreatment and follow-up effect sizes us-
ing Cohen’
s formula on the primary measure: FNE. We 
found overall high effect sizes in the active treatments. A 
controlled effect size expresses the magnitude of a spe-
cific treatment effect compared to control conditions. It 
is calculated by subtracting the posttreatment mean of the 
control group (placebo) from the posttreatment mean of 
the treatment group divided by the pooled standard de-
viation. The controlled effect sizes ( 
d 
c 
) at posttreatment/
12-month follow-up were as follows: paroxetine 0.59/0.39, 
CT 1.96/1.20, and combination 1.09/0.60.
 
In order to obtain an estimate of the clinical signifi-
cance of the treatment effects on the FNE we calculated 
the RCI. Jacobson’
s criterion c, based on the revised 
methodology of Jacobson and Traux  
[27] 
, was applied. 
The cutoff point c and the RCI were calculated using the 
following formulae:

For FNE: c = 15, RCI = 5.89. This means that to achieve 
recovery status, an individual’
s pre- to posttreatment/fol-
low-up scores must change by 6 or more in the direction 
of the functional/normative group, and scores must be 
 
≤ 
15.
 
The number of patients meeting the criteria for recov-
ery at posttreatment (n = 86) was 23% in the SSRI group, 
68% in the CT group, 45% in the combination group, and 
4% in the pill placebo group. There were significantly 
more patients recovered in the CT group compared to the 
combined group (p = 0.041). The same pattern of results 
was found at the 12-month follow-up ( 
table 3 
).
 
Secondary Measures 
 
Analyses were repeated on the secondary LSAS, BAI, 
and IIP-64. There was a significant interaction between

and at follow-up (F

Pairwise tests on the LSAS scores at posttreatment 
showed that the CT group was more improved than the 
paroxetine group (mean difference = –20.574, p = 0.001, 
95% CI: –34.583 to –6.564) and the placebo group (mean 
difference = –25.080, p < 0.0005, 95% CI: –39.179 to 
–10.981) but not more than the combination group (mean 
difference = –10.479, p = 0.262). The combination group 
did not do better than the paroxetine group (mean differ-
ence = –10.094, p = 0.281), but it was better than the pla-
cebo group (mean difference = –14.601, p = 0.031, 95% 
CI: –28.333 to –0.869). The paroxetine group did not per-
form better than the placebo group at posttreatment on 
the LSAS (mean difference = –4.507, p = 0.945). The pat-
tern changed somewhat by the 12-month follow-up, 
where the CT group performed better than the combina-
tion group (mean difference = –18.607, p = 0.008, 95% CI: 
–33.654 to –3.560), better than paroxetine (mean differ-
ence = –22.322, p = 0.001, 95% CI: –37.223 to –7.422), and 
better than placebo (mean difference = –27.415, p < 
0.0005, 95% CI: –42.410 to –12.419). By the 12-month 
follow-up neither paroxetine (mean difference = –5.092, 
p = 0.928) or the combination (mean difference = –8.808, 
p = 0.498) were better than the placebo.
 
 
BAI at posttreatment showed that the CT group per-
formed better than the paroxetine group (mean differ-
ence = –8.020, p = 0.002, 95% CI: –13.784 to –2.256) and 
the placebo group (mean difference = –7.140, p = 0.007, 
95% CI: –12.905 to –1.376) but not better than the com-
bination group (mean difference = –2.963, p = 0.675). The 
combination group was not more effective than the SSRI 
group (mean difference = –5.057, p = 0.104) or the pla-
cebo group (mean difference = –4.178, p = 0.264). The 
paroxetine group did not differ from placebo at post-
treatment (mean difference = 0.879, p = 0.999). At the 
12-month follow-up CT was significantly better than par-
oxetine (mean difference = –9.330, p < 0.0005, 95% CI: 
–14.717 to –3.942) and placebo (mean difference = –9.524, 
p < 0.0005, 95% CI: –14.913 to –4.136). However, it was 
not superior to combination treatment (mean differ-
ence = –4.150, p = 0.223). The combination was equivalent 
to paroxetine (mean difference = –5.179, p = 0.058) but was 
better than placebo (mean difference = –5.374, p = 0.044, 
95% CI: –10.652 to –0.096). The paroxetine group did not 
perform better than the placebo group at the 12-month 
follow-up (mean difference = –0.194, p = 0.999).
 
For the IIP-64, at posttreatment, there were differenc-
es in favor of the CT group compared to the paroxetine 
group (mean difference = –18.167, p = 0.020, 95% CI: 
–34.377 to –1.957) and to the placebo group (mean dif-
ference = –23.696, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 39.941 to –7.450). 
The combination group did not differ from any other 
conditions. Paroxetine did not differ from placebo (mean

up CT performed better than SSRI (mean difference = 
–21.699, p = 0.022, 95% CI: –41.244 to –2.155) and pla-
cebo (mean difference = –25.850, p = 0.004, 95% CI: 
–45.437 to –6.263). There were no other differences.
 
Adverse Effects and Safety 
 
All patients underwent a thorough examination and 
medical test before inclusion in any of the drug condi-
tions. The psychiatrists used a checklist in the case report 
form to inquire about the presence of SSRI adverse effects 
on each visit and rated a severity scale. The list of adverse 
effects was based on the National Medicines Agency 
guidelines for postmarketing studies (2001/20/EC). The 
most common adverse effects reported were nausea, 
headaches, and somnolence. Overall, the medications 
seemed to be well tolerated, and no serious side effects 
were reported in the trial, during the tapering of the drugs, 
or after the trial ( 
table 4 
).
 
Discussion 
 
The results showed that CT was significantly more ef-
fective than paroxetine and placebo at posttreatment and 
at follow-up on the primary social phobia outcome (FNE). 
CT did not perform better than the combined treatment 
on the main measure of FNE, but CT was significantly 
better on recovery rates. The combination of CT and par-
oxetine did not confer clinical advantages compared to 
CT alone at posttreatment and indeed appeared to impair 
long-term outcome at the 12-month follow-up, where CT 
led to significantly lower scores on the LSAS than the 
combination treatment.
 
The combination treatment was superior to placebo 
and demonstrated better recovery rates but was not supe-
rior to paroxetine on measures of anxiety and interper-
sonal behavior. CT also led to higher rates of recovery 
than the other conditions, and the presence of APD did 
not appear to reduce the outcome. There was no addi-
tional gain in effect over CT alone of combining SSRI and 
CT, but there was a trend suggesting that paroxetine de-
tracted from efficacy compared to CT alone. We aimed to 
investigate any advantages of combining CT and parox-
etine, but we were unable to find evidence supporting a 
benefit. In fact the combination yielded a lower effect size 
and significantly lower recovery rates than CT alone. This 
raises the possibility that the combined treatment is det-
rimental to CT alone. This finding concurs well with oth-
er studies showing that exposure therapy in combination 
with SSRI in SAD produces reduced effects  
[9, 33] 
. The 
same appears in studies of panic disorder where exposure 
or CBT is combined with alprazolam  
[34] or imipramine 
 
[35] and also impairs long-term effects compared to ex-
posure therapy or CBT alone. These findings challenge 
the typical assumption that drugs and CBT should be in-
tegrated to improve outcome.
 
Our results are somewhat at variance with another re-
cent study on SAD, which has reported advantages of 
combined treatment over and above the single treatments 
 
[3] 
. In that study group CBT was combined with phenel-
zine. The different pattern of results may reflect both the 
use of a different pharmacological treatment and the use 
of a different form of psychological treatment and treat-
ment format.
 
Two recent meta-analyses of a large number of tri-
als have compared pharmacological, psychological, and 
combined treatment. In the first meta-analyses a large 
pool of heterogeneous forms of psychotherapies and var-
ious types of SSRI were included, and larger effect sizes 
were found for the psychopharmacological drugs (SSRI 
and SNRI) than for psychological therapies  
[20] 
. This is 
in contrast to the meta-analysis of Mayo-Wilson et al.  
[6] 
, 
showing large effect sizes for both pharmacological treat-
ments as well as for psychological treatments, but they did 
not find evidence that any combination was more effica-
cious than the leading pharmacological or psychological 
interventions alone.
 
 
The results in our study showed that combined treat-
ment is detrimental to CT alone. These findings concur

with results showing that exposure therapy in combina-
tion with SSRI  
[9, 33] in SAD produces reduced effects. 
This appears similar in panic disorder where exposure 
or CBT is combined with alprazolam  
[34] 
 or imipra-
mine  
[35] 
, which impairs long-term effects compared to 
exposure therapy or CBT alone. These findings chal-
lenge the typical assumption that SSRI and exposure/
CBT can be integrated to improve outcome for anxiety 
disorders.
 
There might be several explanations for the suppres-
sion effects of paroxetine on CT. Recently, Fava et al.  
[36] 
conducted a systematic review of SSRI withdrawal, show-
ing that paroxetine might reduce outcome not only after 
suspension but during tapering of the drug. Also, re-
bound effects  
[37] and persistent postwithdrawal disor-
ders  
[38] might occur with SSRIs, and these are often ig-
nored and unrecorded in drug trials. An alternative hy-
pothesis could be based on the cognitive model: that the 
patient’
s safety behaviors maintain anxiety by preventing 
reality testing of negative thoughts  
[10] 
. Specifically, 
drugs might act as a safety behavior and thus reduce the 
effect of CT. Consistent with this idea Basoglu et al.  
[39] 
showed that medications might well lead the person to 
attribute positive changes to the medications and not to 
the therapy, and this leaves the patient more vulnerable 
to relapse.
 
Our results are consistent with other studies comparing 
CT with SSRIs, although it is noteworthy that our effect 
sizes and recovery rates were larger than previously report-
ed. As the competency of the therapists in other studies has 
also been high  
[11, 12] 
, a plausible explanation of the 
strong effect sizes could be that in our study we used a 
modified form of CT with elements more consistent with 
metacognitive therapy  
[13] 
. Metacognitively enhanced
CT seems to work more quickly and may increase out-
comes of CT. In particular, it seems that basing treatment 
on reducing the emphasis on changing cognitive content 
and rather working on the worry, ruminations, and threat 
monitoring in social anxiety can enhance the outcome.
 
 
Both paroxetine and CT have both benefits and vul-
nerabilities as treatments for SAD. Paroxetine is a potent 
SSRI and is considered to be a safe treatment for SAD. It 
has demonstrated adverse side effects in a high propor-
tion of patients and has strong withdrawal symptoms af-
ter it is discontinued  
[36] 
. In addition, paroxetine should 
not be used in children or in patients with increased sui-
cidal risk. Also, there are problems with variability in ef-
fect across gender and with older age that make it difficult 
to provide optimal dosages as this must be monitored and 
adjusted in each case.
 
 
CT is considered to be a safe treatment for SAD. CT of 
SAD is dependent on the quality of and compliance with 
treatment  
[40] 
 and is relatively costly and resource de-
manding. Availability of well-trained therapists in CT is 
low, and poorly performed CT, which normally includes 
video feedback and self-exposure techniques, may back-
fire and make the patient worse. The metacognitively en-
hanced CT used here requires additional skills in meta-
CT and is new and not yet widely available. In addition, 
SSRIs or benzodiazepines can be considered a treatment 
option alone, but the first-line treatment should be CT. 
However, SSRIs or benzodiazepines may be considered 
for SAD when comorbid depressive disorder is present 
 
[41] 
.
 
 
The strength of the current study includes the use of a 
rigorous randomized controlled design and evaluation of 
the best current treatments and their combinations. Tri-
ple blinding was used in the paroxetine and pill placebo 
conditions so that the principal investigator, the psychia-
trist/therapist, and the patients had no knowledge about 
which patients were receiving the active drug treatment 
or the pill placebo. There was systematic control of the 
correct dosage of drugs (blood serum by 4 and 12 weeks), 
so we are reasonably sure that the dosage was within tar-
get level and the medication was taken as prescribed. Fur-
thermore, any correction of drugs was counterbalanced 
in both the active and the placebo arms, so the blinding 
of the study was upheld. Finally, a notable aspect of this 
study is that it was independent of any sponsors with a 
special interest in the results and that the medication 
treatment lasted at least 6 months (26–28 weeks), which 
is longer than most comparable studies on SSRIs.
 
The study also has some important limitations. First, 
attrition is always a challenge in samples of SAD and 
avoidant behavior; however, attrition was equally distrib-
uted in all groups in the current study. Fifteen percent of 
the patients did not attend the reassessment, so we had to 
interview these patients at post-treatment by telephone. 
We are not sure whether a different setting of the inter-
views could bias the data, but this must be considered. 
Second, many patients with social phobia suffer from co-
occurring depression; thus, we should be cautious about 
generalizing the findings to patients with both social pho-
bia and major depression as patients with current major 
depressive disorder were excluded. There is a possibility 
that drug treatment in our study may have been adverse-
ly affected by bias produced by the blinding process. Spe-
cifically, in completing self-report measures, those in the 
drug arm may have doubted that they received the active 
treatment rather than placebo. No such conflict operated

in the unmasked CT condition. Fourth, psychotherapies 
might also provide adverse effects, and the current trial 
did not monitor these for the CT condition. This might 
have imposed more negative expectations of treatment 
outcome in patients receiving drugs compared to the pa-
tients receiving CT. Future studies should definitely 
monitor the adverse effects in psychological treatments as 
these are well known but underrecorded and underre-
ported  
[42, 43] 
. Finally, the allegiance effect is always an 
important bias in any study. The cognitive therapists were 
all specialists and have a long track record of using CT in 
various forms of psychological disorders. The psychia-
trists were experienced experts within psychopharmaco-
logical drugs and treatments; thus, the allegiance effects 
should be part of the effects demonstrated both in the 
therapy and the drugs.
 
The overall implications of the results are that CT 
should be considered, where available, as a first-line treat-
ment of patients with SAD with and without an additional 
avoidant personality, with no apparent advantage of com-
bining CT with paroxetine. However, in cases of SAD with 
comorbid depressive disorder, combination treatments in-
volving SSRI or benzodiazepines should be considered. 
Contrary to what was expected, we did not find significant 
differences between paroxetine and placebo on average re-
duction on the FNE. However, there was clearly a greater 
percentage of patients meeting the criteria for reliable clin-
ical improvement with paroxetine compared to placebo. 
This might reflect the high proportion of patients with 
APD, who seemed to respond less to medication alone.
 
 
The treatment effects were maintained at the 12-month 
follow-up, and the pill placebo showed no further im-
provement. The stability of treatment effects for the en-
hanced CT that we used shows that stability of change 
does not suffer due to the relatively short nature of the 
intervention, a finding which also is confirmed in a paral-
lel randomized controlled study of adolescent social pho-
bia  
[44] 
. However, the long-term effects of both parox-
etine and CT in this trial are unknown. A long-term fol-
low-up study of SAD using exposure therapy suggested 
that personality disorder might worsen the long-term 
outcome and predict a relapse of SAD  
[8, 45] 
.
 
Conclusion 
 
CT was the most effective treatment for SAD with and 
without APD. Paroxetine was associated with greater re-
covery rates posttreatment than placebo but not on the 
self-report FNE scores. There was a reduced effect of 
combining the treatments compared to CT alone. The 
detrimental effects of combining SSRI with exposure or 
CBT is reported in previous studies but should be ex-
plored further. The inclusion of patients with avoidant 
personality did not reduce outcomes as the results for CT 
or paroxetine compare well against other studies that 
have typically excluded such patients.
