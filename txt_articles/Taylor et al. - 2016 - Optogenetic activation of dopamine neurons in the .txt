Dopamine (DA) promotes wakefulness, and DA transporter inhibi-
tors such as dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate are effective
for increasing arousal and inducing reanimation, or active emer-
gence from general anesthesia. DA neurons in the ventral tegmental
area (VTA) are involved in reward processing, motivation, emotion,
reinforcement, and cognition, but their role in regulating wakeful-
ness is less clear. The current study was performed to test the
hypothesis that selective optogenetic activation of VTA DA neurons
is sufficient to induce arousal from an unconscious, anesthetized
state. Floxed-inverse (FLEX)-Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) expression
was targeted to VTA DA neurons in DA transporter (DAT)-cre mice
(ChR2+ group; n = 6). Optical VTA stimulation in ChR2+ mice during
continuous, steady-state general anesthesia (CSSGA) with isoflurane
produced behavioral and EEG evidence of arousal and restored the
righting reflex in 6/6 mice. Pretreatment with the D1 receptor an-
tagonist SCH-23390 before optical VTA stimulation inhibited the
arousal responses and restoration of righting in 6/6 ChR2+ mice.
In control DAT-cre mice, the VTA was targeted with a viral vector
lacking the ChR2 gene (ChR2− group; n = 5). VTA optical stimulation
in ChR2− mice did not restore righting or produce EEG changes during
isoflurane CSSGA in 5/5 mice. These results provide compelling evi-
dence that selective stimulation of VTA DA neurons is sufficient to
induce the transition from an anesthetized, unconscious state to an
awake state, suggesting critical involvement in behavioral arousal.

O
ne of the biggest mysteries of modern medicine is how an-
esthetic drugs create the state of general anesthesia (1).
General anesthesia is a reversible, drug-induced state consisting of
unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, and immobility with main-
tenance of physiological stability (2, 3). Hence, general anesthesia
is a reversible coma rather than being akin to any stage of sleep
(3). Traditionally, studies of the mechanisms of general anesthesia
have focused on characterizing the actions of anesthetic drugs at
molecular targets (4). Recent studies have begun to characterize
how anesthetics act at specific neural circuits to create altered
states of arousal (2, 3, 5, 6). For example, the anesthetic propofol
impairs intracortical and thalamocortical communication by in-
ducing coherent alpha and incoherent slow oscillations (7, 8). The
slow oscillations modulate the alpha oscillations (7) and phase-
limited spiking activity (8). Propofol’s simultaneous actions in the
cortex, thalamus, and in several brainstem nuclei contribute to
these dynamics (2, 6, 8, 9). Less research has been done on the
neurophysiology of emergence from general anesthesia.
In current clinical practice, emergence from general anesthesia
is a passive process whereby the general anesthetic is merely dis-
continued at the end of surgery, and recovery of consciousness is
governed by the pharmacokinetics of anesthetic drug clearance.
There are currently no clinically approved pharmacologic or cir-
cuit-level interventions that can induce active emergence or
reanimation from general anesthesia (10). Dopamine (DA) is a
neurotransmitter that is well-known to elicit wakefulness (11).
Although stimulants that increase extracellular DA levels such as
methylphenidate and amphetamine are commonly used to treat
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (12), these drugs also
promote arousal (13–16), and are effective for treating sleep dis-
orders such as narcolepsy (17). Patients with Parkinson’s disease
have degenerative loss of DA neurons in both the ventral teg-
mental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) (18), and excessive
daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of this disease (19). In
mice, selective loss of DA in the brain causes hypoactivity (20).
The available evidence strongly suggests that DA plays a critical
role in regulating wakefulness, yet the DA circuits in the brain that
regulate arousal have not been clearly defined.
It was discovered more than three decades ago that the mean
firing rates of DA neurons in the VTA and SN do not change
appreciably during sleep or wakefulness (21, 22), suggesting that
they do not play a central role in regulating arousal. As a conse-
quence, most studies of DA networks have focused on other
functions such as movement (23), reward (24), and cognition (25).
However, DA neurons in the VTA and SN send projections to key
arousal-promoting brain regions, including the thalamus, dorsal
raphe, locus ceruleus, pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental
Significance
Although dopamine is known to promote wakefulness, the
specific dopamine circuits in the brain that regulate arousal are
not clear. Here we report that selective optogenetic stimulation
of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in mice pro-
duces a powerful arousal response sufficient to restore con-
scious behaviors, including the righting reflex, during continuous,
steady-state general anesthesia. Although previous studies
found that VTA dopamine neurons do not appear to play a
central role in regulating sleep–wake transitions, our findings
demonstrate that selective stimulation of these neurons is suffi-
cient to induce the transition from an unconscious, anesthetized
state to an awake state. These results suggest that VTA DA
neurons play a critical role in promoting wakefulness.

 areas, basal forebrain, and lateral hypothalamus (11). The existence
of these projections suggests that DA neurons in the VTA and SN
may be intimately involved in maintaining behavioral arousal. VTA
lesions in cats have been reported to produce a coma-like state al-
most entirely devoid of arousal (26), suggesting that DA neurons in
the VTA may play a critical role in maintaining wakefulness.
Using continuous, steady-state general anesthesia (CSSGA), we
previously demonstrated that DA transporter (DAT) inhibitors
(methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine) and a D1 receptor ago-
nist (chloro-APB) reliably restore conscious behaviors, including
the righting reflex in rats anesthetized with isoflurane, propofol,
and sevoflurane (27–30). The ability to reverse the actions of
chemically diverse anesthetics such as propofol (an alkyl phenol)
and sevoflurane (a halogenated ether) strongly suggests that DAT
inhibitors induce reanimation from general anesthesia not by
molecular-level antagonism of the anesthetic but rather by stim-
ulating arousal at the level of neural circuits. In an effort to define
the circuit and localize the source of arousal-promoting DA that
induces reanimation from general anesthesia, the present study
was performed using optogenetics to test the hypothesis that se-
lective stimulation of DA neurons in the VTA induces rean-
imation from general anesthesia.
Results
Mice expressing Cre recombinase under the transcriptional con-
trol of the DAT promoter (DAT-cre mice) were used to target
VTA DA neurons. Anesthetized male DAT-Cre mice received
bilateral injections of adeno-associated virus carrying floxed-
inverse (FLEX)-Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) into the VTA (ChR2+
mice), and fiber-optic cannulas were implanted in the injection
sites. In addition, extradural EEG and nuchal electromyography
(EMG) electrodes were placed. A separate group of control DAT-
cre mice underwent the same surgery but received injections of a
viral vector encoding YFP but lacking the ChR2 gene (ChR2−
mice). To ensure maximal viral expression, the animals had a re-
covery period of at least 3 wk before experimentation.
After all experiments were completed, the locations of the fiber-
optic cannulas were histologically confirmed, and immunohisto-
chemistry was performed to confirm virus expression and localization
(Fig. 1 A–F). In the ChR2+ group (n = 6), five mice had bilateral
expression of ChR2, whereas one mouse only had unilateral ex-
pression. In the ChR2− group (n = 5), three mice had bilateral ex-
pression of YFP, whereas two mice only had unilateral expression.
The locations of the fiber-optic probes in areas of viral expression are
shown in Fig. 1G. There was no evidence of thermal injury due to
optical stimulation. ChR2 was expressed selectively in dopaminergic
neurons in the VTA, although the transfection efficiency was low.
Quantification revealed that 40.7% (1,415/3,481) of tyrosine hy-
droxylase (TH)-positive neurons were positive for ChR2-YFP in the
VTA. The ability of ChR2 to excite VTA DA neurons in DAT-cre
mice has been previously validated (31, 32).
In all experiments, isoflurane CSSGA was induced and main-
tained according to the protocol illustrated in Fig. 2A, and optical
stimulation of DA neurons was initiated using 473-nm light pulses
to test for behavioral arousal and return of righting. As shown in
Fig. 2B, two distinct optical stimulation protocols were tested.
Impulse train stimulation (16 pulses, 10-ms duration, 30 Hz, re-
peated every 2 s) was used to simulate a burst firing pattern,
similar to that observed during normal wakefulness (33). In ad-
dition, periodic step stimulation (cycles of 5-ms pulses at 50 Hz for
60 s, followed by 30-s pauses with no stimulation) was used, which
is similar to the electrical stimulation protocol used in our pre-
vious study in rats (34). The two stimulation protocols were tested
on separate days, with at least 3 d of rest provided between ex-
periments, in random order.
In the ChR2+ group, both stimulation protocols produced
similar behavioral evidence of wakefulness, including leg, head,
and whisker movements, righting, and walking, in 6/6 mice during
isoflurane CSSGA (Table 1). After initiating impulse train stim-
ulation, the median time to first purposeful movement was 555 s
[95% confidence interval (CI) 166 to 865 s] and the median time
to righting was 1,097 s (95% CI 662 to 1,343 s), as shown in Fig.
2C. Periodic step stimulation produced similar behavioral results
(Fig. 2D): The median time to first purposeful movement was 437 s
(95% CI 50 to 1,091 s) and the median time to righting was 868 s
(95% CI 709 to 1,330 s). There was no statistically significant
difference between impulse train stimulation and periodic step
stimulation for time to first purposeful movement (P = 0.94,
Mann–Whitney U test) or time to righting (P = 0.97, Mann–
Whitney U test). No correlation was found between the trans-
fection efficiency and reanimation times. Additionally, because
the arousal response of the ChR2+ mouse that only had unilateral
ChR2 expression was indistinguishable from the mice that had
bilateral expression of ChR2, it was included in the pooled results.
These results demonstrate that the two stimulation protocols
produced comparable arousal responses during CSSGA, and the
reproducibility of the arousal response on separate days indicates
that optical stimulation did not cause neuronal damage.
In subsequent experiments, SCH-23390 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) was
administered during isoflurane CSSGA to the ChR2+ group
40 min before initiating optical stimulation. These additional ex-
periments were performed with both impulse train and periodic
step stimulation on separate days (at least 3 d apart in random
order) to determine whether D1 receptor blockade would inhibit
the arousal response induced by optical stimulation. After the
administration of SCH-23390, neither stimulation protocol re-
stored righting despite 30 min of stimulation. As shown in Table 1,
SCH-23390 not only inhibited restoration of righting but also
greatly attenuated the behavioral arousal response in all six mice.

 In 5/5 control (ChR2−) mice, neither impulse train stimulation
nor periodic step stimulation (on different days, at least 3 d apart,
in random order) restored righting during isoflurane CSSGA. As
shown in Table 1, impulse train stimulation induced some mild leg
and head movements in ChR2− mice but did not restore righting.
The beta distribution functions used to model the difference in
propensity for righting are shown in Fig. 2E. Fig. 2F shows the
probability distribution of the difference between the two curves
shown in Fig. 2E. The Bayesian 95% CIs for the difference in
propensity for righting between ChR2+ mice and ChR2− mice
were 0.34 to 0.96, and the posterior probability that the propensity
for righting was higher in the ChR2+ mice than in the ChR2−
mice was 0.9996, indicating that optical stimulation in ChR2+
mice caused a statistically significant increase in return of righting
compared with optical stimulation of ChR2− mice.
The spectral analysis of EEG data recorded during isoflurane
CSSGA was computed for each mouse and correlated with EMG
data. Data were then pooled to compute a group analysis. Time
windows used to compute grouped power spectral density data
comparing a 5-min period of CSSGA before optical stimulation
(blue) vs. a 5-min period during periodic step stimulation (red) are
shown in Fig. 3A. These windows were chosen because (i) the
EEG changes tended to develop gradually over several minutes,
and (ii) the data for these two time windows were available for all
ChR2+ and ChR2− mice (because the first ChR2+ mouse has
restoration of righting at 11 min, EEG data were only available for
all animals during the first 10 min of optical stimulation). Con-
structing 95% CIs around the grouped power spectra revealed that
optical activation of VTA DA neurons during isoflurane CSSGA
in ChR2+ mice induced statistically significant decreases in
low power at frequencies <5 Hz as well as at frequencies be-
tween 6 and 17 Hz (Fig. 3B). When the ChR2+ group received
SCH-23390, the grouped power spectra revealed only a statisti-
cally significant decrease in 6- to 17-Hz power with optical stim-
ulation (Fig. 3C). In the ChR2− group, there was no statistically
significant change in the grouped power spectra with optical
stimulation (Fig. 3D). Mean power differences with 95% CI are
also presented to more clearly highlight these spectral changes.
Discussion
In this study, we found that selective optogenetic activation of
VTA DA neurons in ChR2+ mice induced a profound behavioral
arousal response during CSSGA with isoflurane. Both impulse
train and periodic step stimulation achieved similar behavioral
responses that led to restoration of the righting reflex in 6/6
ChR2+ mice. Spectral analysis of extradural EEG recordings
revealed that optical stimulation induced statistically significant
decreases in δ- and α-power. Systemic administration of the D1
antagonist SCH-23390 in ChR2+ mice before optical stimulation
greatly attenuated the arousal response, and 0/6 mice had resto-
ration of righting. This suggests that the arousal response induced
by activating VTA DA neurons during CSSGA is mediated pri-
marily by a downstream mechanism involving D1 receptors. In
control DAT-cre mice lacking the FLEX-ChR2 gene (ChR2−
mice), optical VTA stimulation during CSSGA did not restore the
righting reflex, and did not induce statistically significant changes
in the EEG power spectrum.
A variety of experimental approaches have been used to
study the neural circuits that underlie anesthetic-induced un-
consciousness and recovery of consciousness in rodents, including
designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs
(DREADDs) (35), genetic manipulations (36), local and systemic
drug administration (10, 37–39), microdialysis (40, 41), targeted
brain lesions (42, 43), and electrical stimulation (34). Optogenetics
is a novel tool that provides distinct advantages over previous
techniques used to study anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and
recovery of consciousness in rodents. Unlike electrical stimulation,
which recruits multiple pathways, optogenetics provides precise
temporal control of specific neuronal populations in vivo (44).
Optical stimulation of VTA DA neurons in ChR2+ mice reliably
restored behavioral arousal and the righting reflex during CSSGA.
However, the arousal response was slower to develop compared
with VTA electrical stimulation in rats (34). It is interesting to note
that a similar attenuation of effect between optical and electrical
stimulation was observed by others in VTA DA-mediated reward
behaviors. Optical activation of VTA DA neurons was insufficient

Optogenetic activation of VTA DA neurons restores righting during
CSSGA with 0.8 to 0.9% isoflurane. (A) Mice inhaled 2.5% isoflurane for
20 min before receiving vehicle (normal saline, i.p.) or the D1 antagonist
SCH-23390 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). The mice were then exposed to a dose of iso-
flurane sufficient to maintain loss of righting (0.8 to 0.9%) for 40 consecutive
minutes, and this dose was maintained throughout the remainder of the
experiment. Optical stimulation was initiated and continued for 30 min, or
until return of righting occurred. (B) All mice underwent two different op-
tical stimulation protocols during CSSGA on separate days in random order
at least 3 d apart. Impulse train stimulation consisted of bursts of 16 pulses of
10-ms duration at 30 Hz, repeated every 2 s. Periodic step stimulation con-
sisted of cycles of 5-ms pulses at 50 Hz for 60 s, followed by 30 s of no
stimulation. (C) Time to first purposeful movement and time to righting for

propensity of righting between the ChR2+ group and the ChR2− group were

group and the ChR2− group being greater than 0 was statistically significant,
with a value of 0.9996.

 to produce self-stimulation reward seen with electrical stimulation
(45, 46) but instead required a pairing of a food-seeking behavior to
see a significant effect (47).
There are several possible explanations for these observations.
First, it is possible that nondopaminergic VTA neurons contributed
to the behavioral arousal response elicited by electrical stimulation
(48) but were not recruited during selective optogenetic activation
of DA neurons. Second, only 40% of DA neurons in the VTA
expressed ChR2 and were therefore able to respond to optical
stimulation, as opposed to 100% recruitment by electrical stimu-
lation. This low efficiency also likely explains why there was no
correlation between the number of neurons expressing ChR2 and
time to reanimation. Finally, not all transfected DA neurons are
likely to fall under the cone of light emitted by the laser, and there
is loss of light intensity as it passes through brain tissue, further
limiting recruitment. Although optogenetics allows for precise
temporal control of neuronal firing, it is likely that a large in-
crease in extracellular DA is necessary to overcome the powerful
hypnotic effects of general anesthesia, which takes several mi-
nutes to develop with optical stimulation.
Accelerated time to emergence from an inhaled anesthetic has
been reported for a number of pharmacological and circuit-level
manipulations, but this end point is greatly affected by physio-
logical variables such as minute ventilation and cardiac output
(49). In contrast, this study was performed using CSSGA wherein
the concentration of anesthetic in the brain is held constant, so
changes in cardiopulmonary physiology cannot alter anesthetic
depth (50). This experimental technique controls for interventions
that produce isolated increases in respiratory rate that will sig-
nificantly decrease time to emergence from an inhaled anesthetic
without affecting the arousal state of the brain. In this way, arousal
from CSSGA is a more robust end point than the more traditional
accelerated time to emergence.
Selective activation of VTA DA neurons in this study induced a
profound behavioral arousal response yet relatively modest EEG
changes (small but statistically significant decreases in low power
at frequencies <5 Hz as well as at frequencies between 6 and 17
Hz that correlated with movement and EMG activity). These
findings support previous observations that profound arousal-state
transitions do not necessarily correlate with large changes in sur-
face EEG activity. For example, atomoxetine, a selective norepi-
nephrine transport inhibitor, elicited large, statistically significant
EEG changes, including a shift in peak spectral power from δ (0 to

The arousal scoring system was adapted from Reed et al. (54). Leg, head, and whisker movements were scored as absent, mild, or
moderate in intensity (0, 1, or 2, respectively) during 30 min of optical VTA stimulation while mice continuously inhaled 0.8 to 0.9%
isoflurane. Righting was scored as 0 if the mouse remained prone, and 2 if all four paws touched the ground. Walking was scored as 0 if
the mouse made no further movements after righting, 1 if it crawled but did not raise its abdomen off the floor, and 2 if it walked on
four paws with its abdomen off the floor. The total score for each animal is the sum of all categories, with a maximum possible score of
10. Mice were treated with either SCH-23390 (SCH) or normal saline (NS). The total score of ChR2+ mice was significantly higher than
ChR2+ mice after SCH-23390 administration (P = 0.0022) and ChR2− mice (0.0043), as determined using a Mann–Whitney U test. The
total scores of ChR2+ mice after SCH-23390 administration and ChR2− mice were not significantly different (P = 0.1342).

 4 Hz) to θ (4 to 8 Hz) during CSSGA, but did not induce be-
havioral arousal (30). Conversely, chloro-APB, a specific D1 re-
ceptor agonist, induced a decrease in δ-power but failed to induce
an increase in θ-power, and yet produced profound behavioral
arousal during CSSGA (28). Taken together, these results suggest
that surface EEG changes may not adequately reflect arousal
states, and that efforts should be made to investigate changes in
local field potentials and their correlation with surface EEG.
Many areas of the brain that are known to promote wakefulness
are quiescent during natural sleep (2), but VTA DA neurons have
similar mean firing rates over sleep–wake cycles (21, 22), suggesting
they are not involved in sleep–wake transitions. However, general
anesthetics produce a state of profound unresponsiveness that is
distinct from natural sleep (for example, rodents do not lose the
righting reflex when they sleep). Therefore, the results of the present
study are consistent with the hypothesis that the neural mechanisms
underlying emergence from general anesthesia are distinct from
those that govern awakening from natural sleep. Although VTA DA
neurons may not play a key role in regulating sleep–wake transitions,
they may be critically involved in governing the transition from the
unconscious, anesthetized state to the awake state.
There are two main DA pathways that project from the VTA: the
mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. The mesolimbic pathway
projects to the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus and
plays a key role in processing reward, motivation, emotion, and
reinforcement (51). It may also play a role in behavioral arousal, as
local injection of DA into the nucleus accumbens of unanesthetized,
freely moving rats is known to stimulate locomotor activity (52). The
mesocortical pathway, which has a major projection to the pre-
frontal cortex, complements the function of the mesolimbic pathway
and also appears to influence arousal (53). The present study en-
courages further work to define the specific dopaminergic projec-
tions from the VTA that promote wakefulness.
In summary, selective optogenetic activation of VTA DA neu-
rons is sufficient to restore behavioral arousal and the righting
reflex during isoflurane CSSGA, through a D1 receptor-mediated
process. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that
VTA DA neurons play an important role in behavioral arousal
and recovery of consciousness from general anesthesia. The ability
to activate specific subpopulations of neurons in the brain with
optogenetics provides a promising approach to elucidate the
complex neural circuit mechanisms that underlie awakening
from general anesthesia and sleep.

Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on Animal Care.
Adult DAT-cre mice (Jackson Laboratory; stock no. 006660) were used for all
experiments. Mice were kept on a 12:12-h light–dark cycle (lights on at 7:00
AM, lights off at 7:00 PM) with ad libitum access to food and water. Mice had a
minimum of 3 wk to recover after surgery, and at least 3 d of rest was pro-
vided after each experiment.
Surgery. All mice were anesthetized with 1–3% isoflurane and placed in a
stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). An incision was made in the skin,
and craniotomies were made above the target region. In ChR2+ mice (n = 6),
280 nL adeno-associated virus carrying FLEX-ChR2 (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-EYFP;
UNC Vector Core, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) was injected
bilaterally, targeting the VTA (−3.1 mm anterior/posterior, ±0.8 mm lateral,
and −4.25 mm dorsal/ventral to bregma) using a motorized stereotaxic injector
(Stoelting). In ChR2− (control) mice (n = 5), virus lacking the FLEX-ChR2 gene
(AAV5-EF1a-DIO-EYFP) was targeted to the VTA using the same stereotaxic
coordinates. In all mice, optical fibers (200 μm inner diameter, N.A. 0.22; Doric
Lenses) were lowered into the brain 4.1 mm so that the tip of the fiber was
near the dorsal aspect of the VTA. Craniotomies were made for extradural EEG
electrodes over the prefrontal cortex, and EMG electrodes were placed in the
nuchal muscle. Anchor screws, electrodes, and fibers were adhered to the skull
with dental acrylic.
Continuous, Steady-State General Anesthesia with Isoflurane. Mice were placed
in an acrylic chamber and anesthetized with isoflurane (2 to 3%) in oxygen. A
heating pad was placed under the chamber to maintain normothermia. Gas was
continuously sampled from the distal portion of the chamber, and isoflurane,
oxygen, and carbon dioxide concentrations in the chamber were monitored
using a calibrated Ohmeda 5250 anesthetic agent analyzer (GE Healthcare). After
20 min at an inhaled isoflurane concentration of 2.5%, 1.0 mL vehicle (normal
saline, i.p.) or the D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma-
Aldrich) was administered. The isoflurane concentration was then held at a dose
that produced loss of righting with no spontaneous movement for 40 consecutive
minutes (0.8 to 0.9% isoflurane) as described previously (27). After the 40-min
equilibration period, optical stimulation was initiated while each animal con-
tinued to inhale the same dose of isoflurane. The experiment was concluded
when restoration of righting occurred or after 30 min had elapsed.
Arousal Scoring. Upon completion of the studies, video recordings were used to
score the arousal responses of each of the animals. The person who conducted the
scoring was blinded to the experimental intervention (e.g., ChR2+ vs. ChR2−;
saline vs. SCH-23390) to prevent biasing. After optical stimulation was ini-
tiated, the animals were observed for signs of arousal and scored using an
adaptation of the method of Reed et al. (54). Spontaneous movements of
the limbs, head, and whiskers were recorded on an itemized scoring sheet as
absent, mild, or moderate in intensity (0, 1, or 2, respectively). In addition,
orienting was scored as 0 if the mouse remained prone, and 2 if all four paws
touched the ground. Walking was scored as 0 if the mouse made no further
movements after righting, 1 if it crawled but was unable to raise its abdo-
men off the floor, and 2 if it walked on four paws with its abdomen off the
floor. Overall arousal was based on the sum of all categories.
Optical Stimulation and Electrophysiological Recordings. EEG and EMG were
recorded using a 64-channel digital recording system (Neuralynx). A patch cord
(Doric Lenses) was connected to the implant to deliver blue light from a 473-nm
laser (Opto Engine). Stimulation parameters were controlled using Multi Channel
Systems stimulus generator STG4000 (ALA Scientific Instruments). The laser intensity
was adjusted so that with continuous light the power measured at the tip of the
patch cord using a power meter (Thorlabs) was 30 mW. The optical fibers caused loss
of ∼50% of the light intensity, so the power at the tip of the fiber was ∼15 mW.
For all mice, two distinct optical stimulation protocols were tested. Impulse
train stimulation (16 pulses, 10-ms duration, 30 Hz, repeated every 2 s) was used
to simulate a burst firing pattern (33), and periodic step stimulation (cycles of
5-ms pulses at 50 Hz for 60 s, followed by 30-s pauses with no stimulation) was
used to simulate the electrical stimulation protocol used in our previous rat
study (34). The two stimulation protocols were tested on separate days, with at
least 3 d of rest provided between experiments, in random order. In the ChR2+
group, at least 3 d after the two different stimulation protocols had been
tested, SCH-23390 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered during isoflurane CSSGA
40 min before initiating optical stimulation. These additional experiments were
performed with both impulse train and periodic step stimulation on separate
days (at least 3 d apart in random order) to determine whether D1 receptor
blockade would inhibit the arousal response induced by optical stimulation.
Histology. After all experiments were completed, the optical fiber positions
were verified by postmortem histological analysis. Animals were perfused with
PBS followed by neutral-buffered formalin. The brains were postfixed in for-
malin overnight and sliced at 50 μm using a VT1000 S vibratome (Leica
Microsystems). Specific expression of ChR2 in DA neurons was confirmed with
immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker of DA neu-
rons (mouse anti-TH; 1:1,000 dilution) (Millipore; catalog no. MAB318) and
ChR2 as marked by YFP colocalization (chicken anti-GFP; 1:100 dilution) (Invi-
trogen; catalog no. A10262). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse
conjugated to Alexa 555 (1:200 dilution) (Invitrogen; catalog no. A-21424) and
goat anti-chicken conjugated to Alexa 488 (GFP) (1:200 dilution) (Invitrogen;
catalog no. A11039). Images were taken with an Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss).
Confirmation of optical fiber placement in the correct brain region was per-
formed by comparing images with a mouse brain atlas (55).
Spectral Analysis of EEG Data and Statistical Analysis. Spectral analysis was
carried out with MATLAB 8.4 (MathWorks) and the Chronux software package
(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Spectrograms were computed from EEG re-
cordings using a 2-s window stepped by 0.05 s and constructed from 0 to 40 Hz
using three tapers with a bandwidth of 1 Hz. For each of the three animal
conditions (ChR2+, ChR2+ after SCH-23390, and ChR2−), group power spectral
densities were calculated from pooled EEG data. “Before” and “after” group
power spectral densities reflect the 5-min period preceding stimulation onset
and the 5-min period beginning 5 min after periodic step stimulation onset,

 respectively. Ninety-five percent CIs around the resulting means were com-
puted using the percentile bootstrap. Ninety-five percent CIs were also
computed using the bootstrap analysis of the difference between the median
power spectra for the before and after time periods for each of the
treatment groups.
A Bayesian Monte Carlo procedure was used to determine the efficacy of
optical stimulation for restoring righting during CSSGA, as previously described
(27). The Bayesian Monte Carlo gives the posterior probability of the differ-
ence in the propensity to right between the two groups (ChR2+ and ChR2−).
Statistical significance was determined as a posterior probability greater than
0.95 and Bayesian CIs that did not include zero. Behavioral scoring was tested by
performing a two-sided Mann–Whitney U test on the total score of the three
groups (ChR2+, ChR2+ after SCH-23390, and ChR2−).
