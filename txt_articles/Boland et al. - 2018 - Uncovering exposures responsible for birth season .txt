ABSTRACT
Objective: Birth month and climate impact lifetime disease risk, while the underlying exposures remain largely
elusive. We seek to uncover distal risk factors underlying these relationships by probing the relationship be-
tween global exposure variance and disease risk variance by birth season.
Material and Methods: This study utilizes electronic health record data from 6 sites representing 10.5 million
individuals in 3 countries (United States, South Korea, and Taiwan). We obtained birth month–disease risk
curves from each site in a case-control manner. Next, we correlated each birth month–disease risk curve with
each exposure. A meta-analysis was then performed of correlations across sites. This allowed us to identify the
most significant birth month–exposure relationships supported by all 6 sites while adjusting for multiplicity. We
also successfully distinguish relative age effects (a cultural effect) from environmental exposures.
Results: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was the only identified relative age association. Our methods
identified several culprit exposures that correspond well with the literature in the field. These include a link
between first-trimester exposure to carbon monoxide and increased risk of depressive disorder (R ¼ 0.725,
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.529-0.847), first-trimester exposure to fine air particulates and increased risk of
atrial fibrillation (R ¼ 0.564, 95% CI, 0.363-0.715), and decreased exposure to sunlight during the third trimester
and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (R ¼ �0.816, 95% CI, �0.5767, �0.929).

INTRODUCTION
Seasonality and climate play an important role in human health and
disease.1 Geography2 and climate3 modulate disease risk and/or se-
verity while also altering our exposure to diverse environmental fac-
tors.2 Prenatal or perinatal exposure to many environmental variables
has been tied with increased disease risk later in life.4,5 This includes
climate factors such as reduced sunlight6 and high humidity.7 Flu or
influenza-like illness (ILI) exposure during pregnancy is also tied to
increased disease risk in offspring.8 Furthermore, exposure to pollu-
tants during pregnancy can increase risk of disease in offspring. Such
pollutants include carbon monoxide,9 nitrogen dioxide,10,11 ozone,12
and sulfur dioxide.13 These exposures are also known to vary season-
ally because of changes in the atmospheric boundary layer depth,
changes in emission rates, and changes in wind and advection.14 The
well-studied relationship between asthma and birth month has been
tied to perinatal exposure to dust mites.15 Dust mite prevalence
depends heavily on temperature and humidity,16 including indoor air
humidity.17 Both humidity and temperature vary seasonally, and sea-
sonal variance depends on climate and geography.18 Therefore, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that seasonal variation in either climate or
pollutant factors could modulate birth month–disease risk patterns
observed in epidemiology studies.
Electronic health records (EHRs) are currently used throughout
the world to record and store health information collected during
clinical encounters.19 Physicians, nurses, technicians, and other hos-
pital caretakers/staff members enter information about patients’
encounters with the health care system into EHRs. Therefore, EHRs
contain a large amount of information pertinent to either billing or
caring for patients (ie, collected during clinical encounters). This
includes prescriptions, diagnoses, laboratory tests and results, proce-
dures, demographics, radiological reports, social worker reports,
various types of clinical imaging, and a large amount of unstruc-
tured clinical notes. These EHRs represent a rich data source for
high-throughput explorations of birth season–outcome relation-
ships. Previously, we constructed an algorithm, called SeaWAS (for
Season-Wide Association Study), to systematically investigate birth
month–disease dependencies across all diseases with sufficient prev-
alence in EHRs,20 where birth month serves as a proxy for seasonal
variance at birth. We conducted our initial study using data from
New York City (NYC). Novel cardiovascular findings were vali-
dated in a separate EHR system, with increased disease risk ob-
served from January through April (winter).21 This EHR was also in
NYC, and therefore subjected to similar climate constraints.21 This
replication was important in increasing our confidence that the find-
ings
were
not
due
to
unexplained
and
unmeasurable
EHR
biases.20,21 Our previous studies did not identify environmental fac-
tors behind the associations, because they were conducted in a single
climate. Separately, researchers from northern Russia (northern
Kola Peninsula) found that male babies born in the summer and fall
had increased elasticity of blood vessels, which could be protective
against cardiovascular disease later in life. Additionally, their results
point to differences in cardiovascular physiology that have a birth
month–season dependency.22 They also found that female patients
who died from acute myocardial infarction were found to have a sig-
nificant birth season relationship in the Sakha Republic, Russia.23
Importantly, 2 different types of effects can manifest themselves
in variance in disease risk by birth month. The first is cultural/socio-
logical, related to the timing of school start dates, and the second is
related to variance in pollution, climate factors (eg, sunlight) that
vary seasonally. These 2 types of birth month effects are important,
as both can result in changes in disease risk. For cultural effects of
birth month, we investigated relative age effects.24 We define relative
age as an individual’s age relative to his or her peers in the same
school grade. Relative age in school provides a competitive advantage
for certain children with regard to sports performance.24 This can re-
sult in changes in disease risk, as children involved in sports are likely
to experience more physical trauma (eg, head trauma in football).
Also children younger than their peers are more likely to be victims of
bullying, which can alter neurological development via direct trauma
(eg, concussion) or indirect trauma (eg, depression). By definition,
bullying involves a difference in power between the bully and the vic-
tim with regard to psychological or physical prowess, both depending
on relative age.25 It is important to separate and distinguish these cul-
tural effects from other birth season effects that are due to variance in
seasonal environmental exposures (eg, sunlight, pollution).
In this study, we investigate the relationship between developmental
stages (first, second, third trimester; perinatal or pregnancy-wide) and
seasonal environmental exposures (climate, pollution, flu) for birth
month–disease relationships. We also delineate birth month–disease
relationships due to differences in school cutoff dates across sites, indi-
cating the effect of relative age on human health and disease. Because of
the diversity of diseases associated with birth month or season, different
mechanisms and exposures are likely to be involved, depending on the
particular disease implicated. We present results obtained using data
from 6 distinct institutions, in 3 countries, spanning 5 cities, and with 4
distinct climates. We identify risk factors involved in birth season asso-
ciations; however, we only refer to “causal risk factors” in instances
where our results reveal the distal causal risk factor in an already estab-
lished biological pathway, as we do not perform causal inference.
METHODS
Data
Clinical data
Birth month–disease risk data were obtained from 6 different hospi-
tals or study sites. Permission was obtained from each institution’s
local Institutional Review Board, which conforms to each country’s,
and in some cases state’s, laws and guidelines. Our algorithm con-
forms to the Common Data Model (CDM) adopted by the Observa-
tional Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium26
and was published on GitHub,27 allowing for broad distribution.28
We ran our SeaWAS at 3 OHDSI collaborator sites using OHDSI-
formatted R scripts that were run locally on each site’s EHR data-
bases. Three study sites were not OHDSI participants at the time of
the study. Therefore, code was formatted to meet those individual
institutions’ data schemas. For non-OHDSI participants, we mapped

 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to the
Systemized Nomenclature for Medicine–Clinical Terms (SNOMED-
CT) codes using the schema contained within the CDM.20,26 There-
fore, both non-OHDSI participants and OHDSI participants fol-
lowed the same data-mapping schema. Other changes made to
scripts for non-OHDSI participants were mechanical in nature, and
consisted of changing table locations based on the local data struc-
ture (eg, a Person table vs a Patient Demographics table). No con-
ceptual changes were made between OHDSI and non-OHDSI
participants. As in the original algorithm, only the first instance of a
diagnosis for each patient was included (for full algorithm details,
see Boland et al.).20 Hereafter, we refer to distinct medical
SNOMED-CT diagnoses as diseases, realizing that some may be in-
dicative of medical conditions.
First, site characteristics were obtained, including patient demo-
graphics, setting (climate, inpatient/outpatient), and CDM version
number (if an OHDSI data partner). For climate, we used the Ko
¨p-
pen-Geiger climate classification system29,30 to describe the high-
level climate of each region.
The SeaWAS algorithm returns birth month–disease risk curves
for all diseases with at least 1000 patients at a given site. Those curves
were then used as input into the developmental time point–exposure–
disease model described below in the Statistical Modeling section.
Exposure data
To study the relationship between exposure and birth season, we re-
quired a dataset containing seasonal variance in exposures across a
variety of exposure types and locations. We investigated 6 climate
variables (mean sunshine hours, minimum temperature, maximum
temperature, rainfall in inches, relative humidity, days of precipita-
tion), 5 pollutant variables (fine particulate matter [PM 2.5 lm in di-
ameter], ozone [O3], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide
[NO2], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]), and flu/ILI in this study. We chose
exposures meeting the following criteria: (1) linked to disease and
birth-related outcomes in the literature, and (2) data were available
at all 6 sites (including Asian sites). Supplementary Figure S3 illus-
trates the variation in seasonal exposure for each of the 12 factors
(climate, pollution, and influenza) across all sites. Exposure data
were assembled from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Con-
trol (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For Taiwanese and Ko-
rean data, we used data from the Korean Meteorological Adminis-
tration, the Taiwanese Central Weather Bureau, and the Korean
CDC Virological Surveillance. Supplementary Table S2 contains the
sources for the exposures used in our study. When data were
unavailable in a freely accessible public dataset, we used published
literature to obtain the required seasonality in pollutant or flu expo-
sure information and noted this in Supplementary Table S2.
Statistical modeling
Delineating culture effects from seasonal environmental effects
The first step in modeling the relationship between birth month–
disease risk and various exposures was to distinguish birth month
effects that were driven by purely cultural elements from those due
to exposure to the environment, pollution, or some other factor. For
instance, in sports, the age of a child athlete relative to his or her
peers determines his or her ability to succeed. This has been demon-
strated in multiple cases24,31 and has been characterized as the
“relative age effect.” Children who are “older” relative to their
peers are more likely to succeed in athletics, whereas children
“younger” than their peers are at increased risk of being victims of
bullying.32 To study the relative age effect, we collected the public
school cutoff dates for each study site; these are listed in Supplemen-
tary Table S3. We adjusted data from each institution using the cutoff
dates from that region. Therefore, curves ranged from 6 months older
than the average child (ie, just after the cutoff date) to 6 months youn-
ger than the average child (ie, just before the cutoff date).
A regression model for the relationship between relative age (þ6
months vs average. . .�6 months vs average) and disease risk was
used to compute the significance of relative age for each disease at
each site. Diseases that were nominally significant across all 6 sites
were considered to have significant cultural effects.
Modeling seasonal environmental exposures occurring during devel-
opment. Twelve seasonally varying environmental exposures were
identified as potential factors involved in birth month–disease rela-
tionships (Supplementary Figure S4). To model the relationship be-
tween exposures and birth month–disease risk, we first modeled the
exposure level for each critical developmental time point. The tri-
mester when an exposure occurs is vital in determining the effects
on the offspring,33,34 therefore we examined the cumulative expo-
sure for each factor across each of the 3 trimesters. In addition, we
investigated pregnancy-wide exposure (cumulative exposure across
the entire pregnancy) and perinatal exposure (exposure at birth), as
these also represent critical developmental periods.
We obtained the average gestation period in weeks for each
country. The mean gestation was 38.5 weeks in Taiwan,35 39.17
weeks in South Korea,36 and 38.6 weeks in the United States,
according to the CDC.37 These average gestation periods were used
to compute the typical conception month for each birth month.
Next, the cumulative exposure for each developmental stage (eg,
first trimester) for each factor (eg, sunlight, rainfall) was calculated for
a given birth month. We made these calculations using the midpoints
of each month. For example, an October birth month would have a
typical first-trimester period from mid-January to mid-April, a typical
second-trimester period of mid-April to mid-July, and a typical third-
trimester period of mid-July to mid-October. Therefore, first-trimester
sunlight exposure for an October birth month would include sunlight
exposure from mid-January through mid-April, and so on.
Meta-analysis across all 6 sites using random effects modeling
First, we correlated each exposure–developmental stage (eg, first,
second, third trimester) with the disease relative risk by birth month
per site. Each disease was compared against each developmental
time point for each factor (eg, sunlight, rainfall). Pearson’s correla-
tion was determined for the relationship between the exposure dur-
ing a certain period (eg, first trimester) and disease risk. For each
computation, the environmental exposure and the disease risk birth
month curve each consisted of a set of 12 numeric data points. Pear-
son’s correlation was used because both variables were numeric.
They were ordered to reflect the birth month. Because the seasonal-
ity of exposures varied across sites, these correlations were per-
formed for each study site.
Next, we employed a meta-analysis approach to harness all data
from our diverse sites. We used the DerSimonian-Laird (DSL)
random-effect meta-analytical approach38 to determine an overall
site-wide correlation coefficient representing the effect of a specific
exposure (eg, sunlight) on a given disease (eg, depression) during a
specific developmental stage (eg, first trimester). The DSL method
transforms each site-specific correlation coefficient to a Fisher Z

 value, with a standard error determined by the site-specific sample
size. This weighs correlations from sites with larger sample sizes for
a given disease higher than correlations from sites with lower sample
sizes. A summary correlation coefficient can then be computed from
these sample-size adjusted correlations. This summary statistic rep-
resents the overall correlation obtained from the meta-analysis
across the 6 sites. The DSL method was implemented based on
Schulze39 and incorporated in the R metacor library,40 with wide-
spread use among the research community.41
Hence, our method determines the correlation between each of
12 exposures across 133 diseases during 5 different developmental
stages (ie, 3 trimesters, pregnancy-wide, and perinatal). Therefore,
multiple comparisons must be accounted for in the analysis. To re-
main as stringent as possible and bias ourselves against finding
disease-exposure
relationships,
we
used
Bonferroni’s
method
of P-value correction that adjusts for all comparisons, including all
133
diseases,
12
exposures,
and
5
developmental
stages
(133 � 12 � 5 ¼ 7980 tests). This stringent threshold allows us to
state that exposure X during stage Y is associated with increased or
decreased risk of disease Z. Figure 1 illustrates the overall method to
find significant exposure-disease relationships for a given develop-
mental stage.
RESULTS
Data
We obtained data from 6 study sites: Columbia University and
Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York; Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tennessee; the University of Washington in
Seattle, Washington; Ajou University in Suwon, South Korea; and
the Taiwan National Health Insurance program, which contains
data from each of Taiwan’s 4 geographic regions. Table 1 contains a
breakdown of the patient demographics from each study site. Over-
all, patients were middle-aged, ranging from a median of 35 years
old in Taiwan to 53 years old at Mount Sinai Hospital. However,
most datasets had a median age in the 40s. Race and ethnicity varied
by site due to differences in local populations. Both datasets from
Asia did not collect race/ethnicity data, only nationality, with the as-
sumption that the majority of patients were Asian. The percentage
of Hispanic patients also varied across sites, with 2–4% at the Uni-
versity of Washington and Vanderbilt University vs 17–21% at both
NYC sites.
We collected the birth month–disease risk curves for each disease
with at least 1000 patients at each study site. Supplementary Figure
S1 depicts the overlap among all diseases with at least 1000 patients
per site across sites. In total, 133 diseases had at least 1000 patients
at all 6 sites, and we focused the remainder of our analyses on these
diseases. Disease-specific sample sizes varied across sites. Essential
hypertension was the most common disease at all 4 US sites. Both
Asian sites showed increased prevalence of gastrointestinal issues
and lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. Supplementary Table
S1 depicts the top 5 diseases from each site. Supplementary Dataset
S1 contains the sample size (N) for each condition at each of the
6 sites.
Statistical modeling
We first investigated the relationship between relative age, as deter-
mined by school cutoff dates, and birth month vs disease risk. Out
of 133 diseases, only 1 disease was significantly associated with rela-
tive age across all 6 sites, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). The results both before relative age adjustment (ie, unad-
justed birth month) and after are shown in Figure 2. The average dif-
ference in ADHD risk due to relative age was 17.97% (average peak
of 1.084 vs average trough of 0.904), with children younger than
their peers experiencing greater ADHD risk. No other diseases were
significantly correlated with relative age.
Next, we investigated the relationship between exposures at cer-
tain developmental stages (eg, a given trimester) and disease risk. Our
method, shown in Figure 1, determines the correlation between each
of 12 exposures across 133 diseases at 5 different developmental
stages. Therefore, multiple comparisons must be accounted for in the
analysis. Figure 3 shows the Manhattan plot for each developmental
stage. We report results as significant if they pass the Bonferroni cor-
rection threshold for multiple comparisons across all analyses (ie, 133
diseases � 12 exposures � 5 time points ¼ 7980 tests).
A total of 56 distinct diseases were significantly associated with
at least 1 exposure during at least 1 developmental stage. These 56
diseases
were
involved
in
150
distinct
disease–exposure–
developmental stage tuples. Twenty-seven diseases were signifi-
cantly associated across multiple exposure stages. This was expected
due to the inherent correlation among exposures. One disease,
dysuria,
was
involved
in
14
tuples
(disease-exposure-stage).
Supplementary Dataset 2 contains all significant disease–exposure–
developmental stage tuples.
Several first-trimester exposures were significantly correlated or
anti-correlated with increased risk of depressive disorder later in life
(Figure 4A), including low sunlight and temperature. However, the
most significant association was a positive correlation between first-
trimester carbon monoxide (CO) exposure (R¼ 0.725, confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.529-0.847) and increased risk of depressive disor-
der. The relationship is shown in Figure 4B for all 6 individual sites.
Atrial fibrillation was positively correlated with PM 2.5 expo-
sure during the first trimester (Figures 5A and B). Taiwan and South
Korea both had fewer patients with atrial fibrillation (10 476
patients in Taiwan and 2241 in South Korea) than US sites (which
ranged from 36 837 to 58 771 patients), and the relationship was
not as strong in those locations. Further, we found that lack of sun-
light during both the third trimester and the perinatal period in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life. The
correlation between low sunlight and increased risk of T2DM in the
offspring was stronger during the third trimester (R ¼ �0.816, 95%
CI,
�0.5767,
�0.929)
than
during
the
perinatal
period
(R ¼ �0.580, 95% CI, �0.420, �0.705) (Supplementary Figure S2).
The individual site breakdown of the relationship between exposure
and low amounts of sunlight during the third trimester and later risk
of T2DM is shown in Figures 5C and D.
DISCUSSION
Our study provides a global interpretation of birth month–disease
risk relationships and allows us to study a number of different possi-
ble mechanisms. We integrate results from more than 10 million
unique individuals across 3 countries, 2 continents, and 5 distinct
climates. We successfully distinguish birth month–disease relation-
ships driven by relative age (a cultural effect) vs seasonal environ-
mental
exposures,
including
climate
factors,
pollution,
and
influenza. We found that ADHD was significantly correlated with
relative age, having an average difference in disease risk of 17.97%,
with younger children experiencing greater risk than their peers. We
also found several exposures occurring during the prenatal period
(ie, maternal exposures) that influence risk of disease in the

 offspring, and also perinatal exposures (ie, direct exposure to the
offspring) that influence lifetime disease risk. Importantly, we only
refer to causal risk factors in instances where our results reveal the
distal causal risk factor in an already established pathway. In other
instances, further testing would be required to clearly state whether
our findings are causal factors or strongly correlated with another
untested causal factor. We discuss our findings below.
Culture effects can induce birth month–disease depen-
dencies: the tale of relative age
The relative age effect is the phenomenon whereby children are pref-
erentially selected based on their age relative to their peers.24,31 This
is commonly studied among athletes, for whom the slight advan-
tages due to age, including size, mental agility, and timing of the on-
set of puberty, provide slightly older children with a distinctive edge
over their classmates. Sociologists have also looked into the effect and
found that children who are younger relative to their peers are at in-
creased risk of being victims of bullying.32 Each of these relative age
effects could alter an individual’s risk of disease later in life. There-
fore, we explicitly investigated the relationship between relative age,
calculated using birth month distributions, and lifetime disease risk of
all diseases in our study. Of the 133 we tested, we found one disease,
ADHD, to be significantly correlated with relative age (Figure 2).
A study among Taiwanese children also found a significant rela-
tionship between relative age and ADHD.42 This effect was also found
in Iceland, where they also describe a relationship between academic
performance and relative age.43 Other researchers have also studied the
connection between academic performance, ADHD, and relative age,
finding increased risk for adverse outcomes among younger children.44
While individual countries and sites have described the relation-
ship between relative age and ADHD, this is the first comprehensive
study to investigate relative age and disease across 3 distinct coun-
tries, 6 sites, and 4 distinct school cutoff dates. While validating

gether because the school cutoff date is the same at both locations (August 31). (B) Shows the only significantly associated disease found across all 6 sites between relative
age and disease risk, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The average difference in relative risk (RR) by relative age was calculated, resulting in a difference of
17.97% in peak vs trough months. Peak risk was observed in the �5 month and trough (lowest risk) was observed in the þ4 month. Average peer age occurred at 0.

 other site-specific studies, our work also increases the need for pro-
vider awareness of this issue when diagnosing ADHD.
All prenatal exposures affecting the offspring’s lifetime disease
risk are mediated through the fetal-maternal barrier. Therefore, we
refer to prenatal exposures as maternal exposures that influence the
offspring’s disease risk, and we refer to perinatal exposures as direct
exposures to the newborn offspring.
Sunlight during third trimester and risk of type 2
diabetes mellitus in offspring
Sunlight was inversely correlated with T2DM during the third tri-
mester (R ¼ �0.816) and the perinatal period (R ¼ �0.580). Low
vitamin D exposure during pregnancy has been linked to in-
creased risk of gestational diabetes,45 which is diabetes of the
mother during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is shown to in-
crease the risk of T2DM among offspring, with a reported odds
ratio of 7.76.46 In our current study, we link sunlight during the
third trimester of pregnancy to changes in T2DM risk among off-
spring later in life.
We depict the link between prior work described in the literature
and our current findings in Figure 5D. Each of the links details one
small piece of the larger puzzle that we are attempting to recon-
struct. In causal terms, those prior studies found the proximal
causes, whereas we reveal the distal factor that can explain the
smaller steps in the proximal pathway.47,48
Mechanistically, our results also fit into the “thrifty phenotype”
hypothesis, which states that inadequate early nutrition impairs de-
velopment of the pancreas, which in turn greatly increases the sus-
ceptibility of the offspring to T2DM.49,50 Gestational diabetes is

 often an indicator of impaired prenatal nutritional status. Our work
links a distal factor, low sunlight exposure during the third trimes-
ter, to increased risk of T2DM in offspring. By uncovering a distal
factor in this mechanism, we have opened the door for evolutionary
biologists to delve further into this relationship to find a fitness ben-
efit, if one does in fact exist.

CO exposure and increased risk of depressive disorder (thick dashed green line). Moffitt et al.52 found that for a large group of patients, there is a combined disor-
der involving generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). We also found a lower correlation between GAD and first-trimester expo-
sure to CO, suggesting that patients afflicted with both diseases could have been exposed to CO.

report findings of proximal causes in the same causal pathway. (C) Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and third-trimester exposure to sunshine at each study site.

risk of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. Clausen et al.46 2008 found that gestational diabetes increased the risk of T2DM in offspring exposed in utero.
Our current study is denoted by the green dashed arrow, which connects third-trimester sunlight levels with T2DM risk later in life. Note that we are uncovering
the distal causal risk factors vs proximal causes.

 First-trimester exposures and risk of depressive
disorder in offspring
Risk of depressive disorder and birth month is an association that is
studied often in the literature.51 An Australian study investigated the
relationship between birth month in both the Southern and Northern
Hemispheres, finding that the timing of the peak of flu was important
in explaining the birth season–depression/suicide relationship.51
Figure 4A shows that first-trimester exposure to ILI was a signifi-
cant factor in depressive disorder, with a slightly lower correlation
value
(R ¼ 0.612,
95%
CI,
0.384-0.770) than CO
exposure
(R ¼ 0.725, 95% CI, 0.529-0.847). Depressive disorder was also sig-
nificantly anti-correlated with sunlight (R ¼ �0.625, 95% CI,
�0.452 to �0.753) and temperature (high temperature, R ¼ �0.645,
95% CI, �0.462 to �0.779; low temperature, R ¼ �0.651, 95% CI,
�0.446 to �0.790), indicating that lack of sunlight during the first
trimester also appeared to be related to depressive disorder. Because
the strongest factor was CO exposure, we focus on the mechanisms
underlying a relationship between first-trimester CO exposure and
depressive disorder. Additionally, prior studies investigated a con-
nection between ILI/flu and sunlight with depressive disorder with-
out investigating pollutant variables such as CO that are often
correlated with sunlight.
We found generalized anxiety disorder (R¼ 0.404, 95% CI, 0.264-
0.528) to also be significantly associated with first-trimester CO expo-
sure, although the relationship was weaker. Importantly, generalized
anxiety disorder was only significantly associated with variance in CO
exposure and no other variable (such as flu or sunlight). This further bol-
stered our hypothesis of a mechanistic link between both depressive dis-
order and generalized anxiety disorder and first-trimester exposure to
CO. Additionally, a study by Moffitt et al.52 found that generalized anxi-
ety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) often occur
together
with
no
apparent
sequential
pattern,
suggesting
that
GADþ MDD may be a disease of its own. Therefore, finding that GAD
and depressive disorder were significantly correlated with first-trimester
CO exposure suggests that we may be uncovering a link between them.
Chronic CO poisoning exhibits itself clinically as chronic fatigue,
depression, and often a diagnosis of influenza infection (due either to
the patient’s weakened immune system or to flu-like symptoms that
patients often present with),53 underscoring the importance of CO ex-
posure in depression. Prenatal exposure to CO was shown to cause
learning and memory deficits, indicating that maternal exposure to CO
crosses both the fetal-maternal and blood-brain barriers.54 First-
trimester exposure to CO was shown to cause intrauterine growth re-
tardation12 and disrupt hippocampus functioning.55 Shrinking of the
hippocampus is one of the critical hallmarks of depression.56 The link
between first-trimester CO exposure and both GAD and depressive dis-
order may be mediated through a shrinking of the hippocampal struc-
tures caused by prenatal CO exposure. We depict the link between
these prior studies on prenatal CO exposure and depression from the
literature and our current findings in Figure 4C. The major link in our
current study is the link between first-trimester CO exposure and in-
creased risk of depressive disorder (thick dashed green line). We also
found a lower correlation between GAD and first-trimester exposure
to CO, suggesting that it could be patients afflicted with both diseases
as described by Moffitt et al.52 who were exposed to CO.
Fine particulate matter during first trimester and risk of
atrial fibrillation in offspring
We found a positive correlation between atrial fibrillation and PM
2.5 exposure during the first trimester (R ¼ 0.564, 95% CI, 0.363-
0.715). Taiwan and South Korea both had very low incidence of
atrial fibrillation, and the relationship was not as strong in those
locations, suggesting the possibility that an additional factor may
mediate the relationship (Figure 5A). In adults, PM 2.5 exposure has
been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including in-
creased heart failure and mortality.57–59 Exposure to PM 2.5 in
adults was also associated with increases in systolic blood pres-
sure.60 Children of mothers with gestational hypertension were
found to have higher blood pressure and elevated cholesterol and
apolipoprotein B levels.61 High blood pressure is a risk factor for
later development of atrial fibrillation.62 Exposure to fine air partic-
ulates increased the risk of gestational hypertension in pregnant
women.63 We propose a mechanism that connects atrial fibrillation
and first-trimester exposure to fine particulate matter by elevating
maternal blood pressure and inducing gestational hypertension. We
depict the link between the prior literature on this topic and prenatal
fine air particulate exposure and increased risk of atrial fibrillation
in Figure 5B. We uncovered a link between first-trimester exposure
to fine air particulates and increased risk of atrial fibrillation later in
life, which is a distal cause, with the proximal causes all outlined to-
gether in Figure 5B.
Perinatal exposures and later risk of disease
We also found diseases that were tied to exposures during the peri-
natal period (ie, the environment the baby is born into). One such
relationship is perinatal flu exposure and lifetime risk of anemia
(R ¼ 0.660, 95% CI, 0.467-0.793). Some regions, such as NYC and
South Korea, illustrated near perfect correlation between flu expo-
sure and lifetime risk of anemia, while other sites had lower correla-
tion. Newborns are at increased risk of developing infections due to
influenza or other viruses due to their developing immune systems.64
Anemia often results as part of the body’s innate immune system to
fight infections.65 The uncovered link between perinatal flu expo-
sure and anemia may be mediated through an immune pathway.
Limitations
Our method investigates the presence or absence of correlations be-
tween exposures during different developmental stages and lifetime
disease risk. We used the DSL meta-analysis method to uncover only
correlations that were consistent across all study sites (ie, robust).
While we probe deeply into how specific exposures can affect life-
time disease risk, there are other exposures (eg, diet) that we were
unable to investigate in this study due to lack of available data. Im-
portantly, if a co-varying environmental factor exists that was not
included in our analysis and was correlated with an exposure or out-
come in our analysis, then we may be uncovering an association that
is due to this other unmeasured factor. For example, if seasonal
smoking (an example of an unmeasured confounding exposure)
were correlated with either CO seasonality (measured exposure) or
lung cancer (measured outcome), then this would be a confounder.
This is not as likely, given the number of sites and the diversity of
our sites (Asia vs US). By using the DSL method, we make use of a
random effects model, which should reduce the effects of unmeas-
ured confounding.66
Additionally, given our use of EHR data, there are many latent
(hidden) factors related to insurance practice and guidelines with re-
gard to coding of diagnoses.67 Using data from different countries
helps to minimize these biases, given that insurance coding practices
often are country-specific68; however, other latent effects due to use
of EHR data may remain, as these are often difficult to assess.

 Therefore, this remains a limitation of our work. We are confident
in our findings that support the literature with regard to specific
causal mechanisms. However, the quality of specific publicly avail-
able pollution and climate data could affect the meaningfulness of
some specific results. We used only freely available data sources for
seasonal exposure data. We provide all sources and seasonal infor-
mation in the Supplement. More robust sources of data may exist in
certain research laboratories in the world, but they are not freely
available. We strongly support open science and transparency to the
extent possible.69
Generalizability
Importantly, our methods can be used to find culprit exposures for
birth month effects observed in highly dissimilar countries, eg, in Af-
rica. But the number of potential culprit exposures would likely
need to be increased due to their unique exposures and circumstan-
ces. Our methods should be highly generalizable across all cultural
and climate bounds. However, our results, such as third-trimester
sunlight and diabetes, may not generalize to countries with low so-
cioeconomic status, because diabetes is often a disease of the afflu-
ent, and therefore some of the specific findings of this study are
likely most applicable to countries with similar socioeconomic cir-
cumstances, eg, European and Asian countries. We also want to cau-
tion readers not to make individual-level assertions from our
population-level analysis. Individual-level assertions require a pro-
spective randomized controlled trial to establish. Our work confirms
known findings and identifies areas that may be worthy of prospec-
tive human studies in the future.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this comprehensive study of factors involved in birth
month–disease risk used data from more than 10 million patients, 3
countries, 2 continents, and 5 climates. We were able to distinguish
the cultural effect of relative age from seasonal environmental expo-
sures that affect birth month–disease dependencies. We were also
able to identify both the seasonal environmental exposure and the
stage that resulted in increased disease risk. Others in the literature
have identified the proximal causes behind these relationships,
whereas we identify distal causal risk factors. Several important
findings include a link between both depressive disorder and gener-
alized anxiety disorder and first-trimester exposure to carbon mon-
oxide. Lack of sunlight exposure during the third trimester was
correlated with increased type 2 diabetes mellitus risk. Finally, in-
creased risk for atrial fibrillation occurred with first-trimester expo-
sure to fine air particulates. By identifying the distal causal risk
factors in these disease pathways, we are able to identify areas that
may require seasonal dosing of prenatal supplements.
