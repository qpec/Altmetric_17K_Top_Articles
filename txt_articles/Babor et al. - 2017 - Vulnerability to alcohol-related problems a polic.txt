ABSTRACT
Background and Aims
The concern that alcohol advertising can have detrimental effects on vulnerable viewers has
prompted the development of codes of responsible advertising practices. This paper evaluates critically the concept of vul-
nerability as it applies to (1) susceptibility to alcohol-related harm and (2) susceptibility to the effects of marketing, and
describes its implications for the regulation of alcohol marketing. Method
We describe the findings of key published stud-
ies, review papers and expert reports to determine whether these two types of vulnerability apply to population groups de-
fined by (1) age and developmental history; (2) personality characteristics; (3) family history of alcoholism; (4) female sex
and pregnancy risk; and (5) history of alcohol dependence and recovery status. Results
Developmental theory and re-
search suggest that groups defined by younger age, incomplete neurocognitive development and a history of alcohol de-
pendence may be particularly vulnerable because of the disproportionate harm they experience from alcohol and their
increased susceptibility to alcohol marketing. Children may be more susceptible to media imagery because they do not
have the ability to compensate for biases in advertising portrayals and glamorized media imagery
. Conclusion
Young
people and people with a history of alcohol dependence appear to be especially vulnerable to alcohol marketing,
warranting the development of new content and exposure guidelines focused on protecting those groups to improve cur-
rent self-regulation codes promoted by the alcohol industry. If adequate protections cannot be implemented through this
mechanism, statutory regulations should be considered.

INTRODUCTION
From a public health perspective, vulnerability denotes
susceptibility to poor health or illness, which can be
manifested through physical, mental and social health
outcomes. Although definitions of vulnerability vary
[1,2], for the purposes of this review, two forms of vulnera-
bility are considered: (1) susceptibility to alcohol-related
harm and (2) susceptibility to the effects of marketing.
Age and pregnancy status are recognized in the
responsible marketing codes adopted by the alcohol and
marketing industries as vulnerability characteristics. Some
self-regulated alcohol marketing codes, for example,
prohibit the use of actors who are or appear to be under
the legal purchase age, presumably to protect youth from
exposure to role models of the same age. Similarly, some
codes prohibit the depiction of pregnant women.
Increased vulnerability to the harmful effects of alcohol
and alcohol marketing may also be defined by a variety of
personal attributes and individual difference factors, such
as a family history of alcohol dependence, certain personal-
ity characteristics and disorders as well as psychiatric
syndromes such as alcohol dependence, which may make
former drinkers more likely to experience alcohol craving
in response to alcohol marketing.
In addition to being vulnerable to the effects of alcohol,
some populations (e.g. children) may be especially vulner-
able to the effects of alcohol marketing (e.g. [3]). For exam-
ple, young children may be more susceptible to media
imagery because they do not have the ability to compen-
sate for biases in advertising portrayals and glamorized
media imagery
. For this reason, child advocates [4] and
business ethicists [1] question the ethics of marketing prac-
tices targeted to children because it is considered unfair to
take advantage of groups who cannot defend themselves.
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate critically the
concept of vulnerability as it applies to the marketing of
alcohol products to populations defined by five types of

 personal and social characteristics: (1) age and develop-
mental history; (2) personality characteristics; (3) family
history of alcoholism; (4) female sex and pregnancy risk;
and (5) drinking history and alcohol dependence.
AGE AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY
Children and adolescents satisfy both criteria for a vulnera-
ble population. Evidence shows that the architecture of the
brain changes significantly and predictably during adoles-
cence. During childhood, the volume of gray matter in
the cortex increases and then declines, with the maximum
gray matter volume occurring during early adolescence
[5]. The decline in the volume of grey matter is accompa-
nied by a flourish of axonal growth and refinement of cor-
tical connections. Superfluous neurons are pruned and the
structure of the adult brain gradually takes shape. This
winnowing of neurons is influenced by, among other fac-
tors, the adolescent’s interactions with and experiences in
the outside world.
Behavioral controls, judgement and the capacity to
postpone gratification do not develop fully until the grey
matter of the prefrontal cortex and its connections are well
established, which is completed in the mid-20s [6]. This
process contrasts with the development of the limbic sys-
tem, which occurs at a much earlier age. It has been hy-
pothesized that risky impulsive behaviors result from the
dissociation in development between the limbic system
and the prefrontal cortex, rendering adolescents particu-
larly prone to risky behavior such as binge drinking [7].
This may explain why alcohol-related risky behavior
resulting in injury, accidents, crime and harm to others is
common at this age.
Brain structures subserving socio-emotional processing
are very prominent at this time, and may constitute targets
for advertising, especially on social media, that emphasize
bonding with friends and identification with a particular
product. In late adolescence the adolescent boy or girl
becomes acutely self-aware, and the judgement of peers
and ‘fitting in’ are paramount. Because of this, alcohol
may fit into the social awareness paradigm, which confers
adaptive benefits as well as hazards [8].
Cross-sectional studies have shown that there are
significant differences in the brain structure and function
of adolescents who drink heavily and those who do not
[9]. Although the dilemma of cause and effect has yet to
be clarified fully, overall, heavydrinking during adolescence
has been associated with lower cognitive ability and abnor-
mal brain development. Alcohol also appears to affect the
ability of young people to control their emotions and
behaviors, which could lead to long-term academic, occu-
pational and social functioning problems. Early onset of
very heavy drinking is thought to increase the likelihood
of developing alcohol disorders later in life, due potentially
to lasting effects on brain function [7]. Although more re-
search is needed in this area, the existing evidence is suffi-
cient to raise serious concern [10].
Developmental theory and research suggest strongly
that young children may be more susceptible to media im-
agery because they do not have the ability to compensate
for biases in advertising portrayals and glamorized media
imagery (e.g. [3]). This view is supported by research
showing that prior to the age of 8 years most children do
not possess the necessary cognitive skills to differentiate
commercial advertising from other sources of information
[11,12]. Even older children and adolescents who under-
stand the purpose of advertising may not act regularly on
that knowledge because they lack the ability to weigh
long-term health consequences of alcohol consumption
against short-term rewards [13].
Specific to alcohol, a study examining adolescents’ age
perceptions of characters in several beer commercials
[14] found that 40% of respondents perceived at least
one underage person in the advertisements; 19% of the
rated commercials contained characters perceived to be
underage users or intended users of alcohol, and younger
adolescents were more inclined to perceive underage char-
acters as users of the product. In a reciprocal relationship,
young people who have initiated alcohol use earlier than
their peers may be more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol
marketing. One study found that underage drinkers tend to
be more adept than same-age non-drinkers at recognizing
and identifying alcohol product brand imagery in television
advertisements [15], and a separate study determined that
young adults (aged 18–21 years) who drink heavily per-
ceive heavier drinking by characters portrayed in alcohol
advertisements and are less likely to label this drinking as
excessive [16].
PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS AND
OTHER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE
FACTORS
Personality disorders (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and conduct disorder) and personality traits such
as sensation-seeking and impulsiveness have been linked
to early onset of drinking and progression to alcohol depen-
dence [17]. There is also evidence of an association be-
tween high reward sensitivity and hazardous drinking
[18,19]. Several of these personality characteristics, partic-
ularly sensation-seeking, have been implicated in a variety
of other problem behaviors, such as illicit drug use, risky
driving, driving while intoxicated and high-risk sexual
activity.
Such individuals may be particularly susceptible to role
models who exhibit deviant behaviors, portrayed some-
times in alcohol advertisements as well as movies that con-
tain alcohol product placements. Despite the consistent

 association of these characteristics with early onset of
drinking and with later alcohol abuse (e.g. [20]), it is not
possible at this time to specify the nature of the vulnerabil-
ity with sufficient diagnostic accuracy to include it as a tar-
get of marketing controls.
FAMILY HISTORY OF ALCOHOL
DEPENDENCE
Adult children of alcoholics meet one of the proposed
criteria of a vulnerable population. They are uniquely sus-
ceptible to alcohol use. Parental problem drinking is a sig-
nificant health risk to children and adolescents [21].
Children of parents who drink excessively are more likely
to have substance use disorders, engage in criminal behav-
ior and have severe psychiatric disorders, including suicidal
ideation, depression and psychological disturbances. In ad-
dition to genetics, parental modeling has been identified as
a primary mechanism that increases the risk of early-onset
adolescent drinking in children whose parents display
heavy alcohol consumption patterns [22]. In a longitudi-
nal study that followed children from 1st to 8th grade, pa-
rental alcohol use was a significant risk factor for a female
child’s intention to drink [23].
A longitudinal study on the intergenerational transmis-
sion of alcoholism found that the effect of higher levels of
maternal drinking and current paternal alcohol use disor-
ders on childhood onset of drinking was mediated by disclo-
sure of negative alcohol experiences [24]. That is, greater
disclosures were associated with earlier alcohol initiation
among children. Moreover, positive and negative alcohol
expectancies in children are influenced by parental alcohol
expectancies, with adoption of expectancies apparent by
age 12 [25].
There is insufficient evidence to suggest that adult chil-
dren of alcoholics either are or are not vulnerable to alco-
hol marketing. One study found no differences in
perceptions between participants who did and who did
not have a family history of alcohol problems [16]. No
other studies were located on this topic.
WOMEN AT RISK FOR AN
ALCOHOL-EXPOSED PREGNANCY
A woman is at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy
(AEP) if, in the last month, she (1) drank alcohol; (2)
had vaginal intercourse with a male; and (3) did not use
contraception [26]. Current research is insufficient to
determine if these women should be considered a vulnera-
ble population. There are two primary health concerns
regarding alcohol use in this population. First, harm to
the woman must be taken into consideration. Women
typically have increased vulnerability to alcohol-related
harm because of lower body weight, smaller liver capacity
to metabolize alcohol and a higher proportion of body fat
[27]. A recent meta-analysis that included 23 prospective
studies of nearly 500 000 participants concluded that
moderate and heavy drinking women may have an
increased risk of mortality compared to moderate and
heavy drinking men [28], while the risk of liver cirrhosis
was higher among women compared to men with the
same
level
of
alcohol
consumption
in
a
separate
meta-analysis [29]. Alcohol use is also a risk factor for
breast cancer, with some studies showing risk beginning
at one to two drinks per day [30–32].
Secondly, alcohol consumption during pregnancy must
be considered. Women who drink while pregnant risk
giving birth to a child with physical, learning and behav-
ioral problems, including fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
(FASD) [33–39]. Alcohol can disrupt fetal development at
any stage of pregnancy, including the early stages before
a woman may know she is pregnant. Studies confining ex-
posure to early gestation have concluded that facial
malformations representative of FASD result from ethanol
exposure during the embryonic period, specifically the first
3–8 weeks of gestation [40]. Other studies have docu-
mented decreased height (length) and weight that persist
into young adulthood [41], increased rates of spontaneous
abortion
[42],
increased
craniofacial
abnormalities
[43,44], psychiatric disorders as young adults [34] and
neurobehavioral
deficits
[45–49].
Although
studies
focusing on low to moderate alcohol consumption during
pregnancy have shown inconsistent results [50], the public
health and medical community generally recommends
that
women
abstain
from
drinking alcohol
during
pregnancy.
High rates of alcohol use during pregnancy have been
reported in the United States (17.9%), the Russian Federa-
tion (51.9%) and Barcelona, Spain (45%), with binge
drinking rates of 2.7 and 20.2% reported in the United
States and Russian Federation, respectively [51–53]. In
the Western Cape of South Africa, 43% of women reported
alcohol consumption during pregnancy [54] and rates of
FAS documented in one such community are the highest
in the world: 65.2–74.2 per 1000 children in the first-
grade population [55]. An analysis of 865 meconium sam-
ples from pregnant women in Uruguay revealed that
47.3% were positive for alcohol, while only 35% disclosed
drinking while pregnant [56]. These findings suggest that
many pregnant women are not following medical advice
not to consume alcohol during pregnancy, if they receive
any advice at all.
The issue is compounded further by high rates of unin-
tended pregnancies, during which a woman may expose
her developing fetus to alcohol unintentionally before rec-
ognition of pregnancy. Using multiple data sources to esti-
mate the incidence of all live births, abortions and
miscarriages for all major geographic regions, a study by
96

 Sedgh, Singh & Hussain [57] found that 85 million of the
213 million pregnancies (40%) that occurred world-wide
in 2012 were unintended. In Latin America and the
Caribbean, the rate was 56%. While 42% of unintended
pregnancies in Latin America and the Caribbean end in in-
duced abortion, and 39% in North America, more than a
quarter of all live births are from unintended pregnancies.
Little research has been conducted to determine if
women, particularly those at risk for an AEP
, are suscepti-
ble to alcohol marketing. In a study of US college students,
women perceived greater alcohol consumption by the
main characters in three of five alcohol advertisements
viewed [16]. A study utilizing street interviews determined
that men and women describe beer, wine and spirits in dif-
ferent ways [58]. However, the first study did not link gen-
der with other behavior patterns and the second study did
not attempt to show that different perceptions of alcohol
marketing indicates susceptibility to the marketing mes-
sage. Therefore, while alcohol consumption poses signifi-
cant risks to a fetus and may pose increased risk to
women, it is premature to consider this subset of women
vulnerable in terms of alcohol marketing messages.
HISTORY OF HEAVY DRINKING AND
SUSCEPTIBILITY TO RELAPSE IN
RECOVERING ALCOHOLICS
Evidence supports defining alcoholics and other heavy
drinkers as a vulnerable population. Long-term excessive
use of alcohol has been linked to liver disease, heart disease,
cancer, learning and memory problems, mental health
problems and social problems [59]. The World Health
Organization estimates that more than 3 million deaths
per year globally are attributable to the harmful use of
alcohol [60].
Some studies have shown that heavy or problem
drinkers respond differently in response to alcohol cues
than light or social drinkers on measures of psychophysiol-
ogy [61,62], attentional bias [63,64], cognitive processing
[65], urges to drink [19,66] and positive affect [63,67]. In
one experiment, ‘moderate social drinkers’ exposed to alco-
hol advertisements in magazines showed increases in skin
conductance to a significantly greater extent than did ‘light
social drinkers’ [68].
Alcohol-related images in cue–reactivity studies have
been found to increase craving or urges to drink in heavy
alcohol users compared to ‘neutral’ or control cues
[69,70,66,67,71]. This may occur because heavy alcohol
users are subject to attentional biases [72]. Individuals
whose goal is to consume alcohol are easily distracted by
alcohol-related stimuli and will either dismiss or pay signif-
icantly less attention to non-alcohol-related cues. The
degree of attentional bias an individual exhibits is associ-
ated positively with drinking status, with heavy drinkers
having significantly greater biases than non-drinkers or so-
cial drinkers, and there is evidence to suggest that atten-
tional bias plays a causal role in triggering alcohol use in
relapse and in maintaining alcohol dependence [73–75].
Moreover, craving and alcohol-related attentional bias
may create a positive feedback loop whereby alcohol-
related stimuli become more salient as cravings increase
and cravings increase as greater attention is paid to
alcohol-related stimuli [73].
Using functional neuroimaging as a tool to understand
reactivity to alcohol-related cues, a meta-analysis identified
greater neural activation after exposure to alcohol-related
stimuli in heavy alcohol users in the ventral striatum and
ventral anterior cingulate cortex [76]. Activity in the ven-
tral striatum was correlated positively with severity of
dependence, amount of drinking, impaired control and
magnitude of craving. In another study [77], teenagers
with alcohol use disorders showed greater brain activation
to pictures of alcoholic beverages than control youths, pre-
dominantly in areas linked to reward, desire and positive
affect. The degree of brain response was highest in youths
who reported greater desire to drink and who consumed
alcohol more frequently.
Importantly, cue–reactivity is predictive of alcohol con-
sumption and relapse after treatment in alcoholics [78].
For example, participants in an alcohol treatment program
who exhibited increased cue-elicited alcohol craving had
higher odds of relapse [79], and among alcoholics undergo-
ing in-patient treatment 8–10% of the variance in alcohol
consumption after discharge was explained by the desire to
drink after cue–reactivity sessions [80].
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REGULATION
OF ALCOHOL MARKETING
What moral responsibilities do marketers of alcoholic bev-
erages have when they consider marketing to vulnerable
groups? Do both types of vulnerability need to be present
for protection to be afforded, or would the first type be a
sufficient criterion? These are some of the questions this
essay has attempted to answer. Table 1 provides a box score
summary to the evidence for two types of vulnerability in
five groups of drinkers. The table indicates that both types
of vulnerability are present in at least two groups.
The risks of alcohol consumption in young people are
well recognized and are reflected in various forms of
‘permitted age’ legislation around the world, including
regulations and industry self-regulations on exposure of
children and adolescents to alcohol marketing. It is now
clear that these prohibitions are based soundly on a
demonstrable biological vulnerability that shows that the
brain is not biologically mature until early adult life.
Many cultures have established laws about the age at
which young people are permitted to drink or be served

 alcohol. This shows that society has been aware of the dan-
gers attendant on adolescent drinking both to the drinker
and to public order. Vulnerability is well recognized, but
the biological underpinning of this conventional wisdom
adds another dimension to our appreciation of the risks
and shows that the brain itself matures later than has been
commonly thought. The brain evolves throughout adoles-
cence and into early adult life. The impulsiveness and
risk-taking evident in many adolescents, coupled with the
relatively late development of critical faculties, has a neuro-
chemical substrate. The architecture and activity of the
brain are very malleable over these years, and alcohol
can impair successful maturation. This makes the young
person uniquely vulnerable to the blandishments of mar-
keting in all its forms. An additional reason for restraint is
that the psychoactive effects of alcohol on the immature
brain are particularly potent, with damaging conse-
quences to self and others.
Social learning theory [81] provides insights into the
link between advertising, purchase behavior, onset of
drinkingand heavy drinking. In addition to social modeling
of drinking behavior and the frequent association of social
reinforcement with drinking, learned alcohol expectancies
are another factor thought to mediate the relationship
between vulnerability factors, alcohol marketing and
alcohol-related problems. These expectations have been
found to affect the early onset of drinking, behavior during
intoxication and the development of alcohol abuse [82].
Other evidence indicates that marketing can affect young
people’s alcohol expectancies in a way that facilitates
positive and negative affect regulation [83].
Beyond groups defined by age and developmental
history, one other group—alcoholics—may be particularly
vulnerable because of the disproportionate harm they
experience from alcohol and their increased susceptibility
to alcohol marketing. This group meets the two proposed
criteria that define vulnerability for marketing purposes,
thereby warranting an expanded definition of vulnerability
as it applies to alcohol marketing.
More research is needed to expand the definition to
women at risk of an AEP
, adult children of alcoholics or
other populations based on psychological characteristics.
For example, extensive research demonstrates the dangers
of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, which was
reiterated in a 1981 US Surgeon General’s advisory urging
women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant
to abstain from alcohol use, and by the US Secretary of
Health and Human Services [84], the Centers for Disease
Control and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA) [51]. However, there
is insufficient evidence to suggest that women who may
become pregnant are uniquely susceptible to alcohol
marketing, even though non-pregnant women of child-
bearing age may benefit from the same protections pro-
vided to pregnant women regarding alcohol advertising.
Additional research should include observational and
experimental studies. Similar to existing studies on the
effects of alcohol marketing exposure, longitudinal cohort
studies of youth and adults that are designed specifically
to identify vulnerable and potentially vulnerable popula-
tions can determine if changes in alcohol consumption
and alcohol-related consequences due to marketing expo-
sures are greater in these populations. New experimental
research can parallel the cue-exposure research performed
on populations of alcoholics and heavy alcohol users. For
example, trials can be implemented to determine if vulner-
able or potentially vulnerable populations have greater
alcohol cravings after exposure to alcohol marketing and
if these populations show attentional bias towards such
materials.
The populations discussed in this paper are not insignif-
icant. World-wide, 16.0% of the 15+ population were
heavy episodic drinkers in 2010 [60]. Historically, one in
eight Americans were children of alcoholics [85], and
recent evidence suggests that 20% of the Swedish popula-
tions have parents with alcohol problems [86]. Moreover,
approximately 2 million women in the United States are
at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy [26].
In conclusion, this review suggests that new content
and exposure guidelines should be drafted to improve cur-
rent self-regulation codes by expanding them to vulnerable
groups of adults. To the extent that both theory and empir-
ical research suggest that populations defined by age and
developmental history may be particularly susceptible to al-
cohol marketing, there are ample grounds for strengthening
the protections used in many countries that limit exposure
to potentially harmful marketing content, especially in light
of evidence showing that industry self-regulation measures

 are ineffective in protecting age vulnerable groups from ex-
posure to potentially harmful content [87]. If adequate
protections cannot be implemented through this mecha-
nism, then statutory regulation should be considered.
