Abstract
Clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by VHL inactivation1,2. Because no 
other gene is mutated as frequently, and VHL mutations are truncal3, VHL inactivation is regarded 
as the governing event4. VHL loss activates HIF-2, and constitutive HIF-2 restores tumorigenesis 
in VHL-reconstituted ccRCC cells5. HIF-2 is implicated in angiogenesis and multiple other 
processes6–9, but angiogenesis is the main target of drugs like sunitinib10. HIF-2, a transcription 
factor, has been regarded as undruggable11. A structure-based design approach identified a 
selective HIF-2 antagonist (PT2399) that we evaluate using a tumorgraft (TG)/PDX platform12,13. 
PT2399 dissociated HIF-2 (an obligatory heterodimer [HIF-2α/HIF-1β])14 in human ccRCC 
suppressing tumorigenesis in 56% (10/18) lines. PT2399 had greater activity than sunitinib, was 
active in sunitinib-progressing tumors, and was better tolerated. Unexpectedly, some VHL-mutant 
ccRCCs were resistant. Resistance occurred despite HIF-2 dissociation in tumors and evidence of 
Hif-2 inhibition in the mouse as determined by suppression of circulating erythropoietin, a HIF-2 
target15 and possible pharmacodynamic marker. We identified a HIF-2-dependent gene signature 
in sensitive tumors. Illustrating drug specificity, gene expression was largely unaffected by 
PT2399 in resistant tumors. Sensitive tumors exhibited a distinguishing gene expression signature, 
and generally higher HIF-2α levels. Prolonged PT2399 treatment led to resistance. We identified a 
binding site and second site suppressor mutation in HIF-2α and HIF-1β respectively. Both 
mutations preserved HIF-2 dimers despite treatment with PT2399. Finally, an extensively 
pretreated patient with a sensitive TG had disease control for >11 months with the close analogue 
PT2385. We validate HIF-2 as a target in ccRCC, show that some ccRCC are, unexpectedly, HIF-2 
independent, and set the stage for biomarker-driven clinical trials.

The discovery of a 280Å3 cavity within the PAS-B domain of HIF-2α16,17 and subsequent 
identification by UT Southwestern investigators of compounds that bound this cavity and 
dissociated HIF-2α from HIF-1β18 led to the founding of Peloton Therapeutics, who 
through an iterative structure-based program identified selective potent HIF-2α antagonists 
such as PT2399 (described in Cho et al.)19 and PT238520.
To evaluate PT2399 in renal cancer, we tested a panel of 22 independently-generated 
TGs12,13 (Extended Data Table 1). To assess tolerability, we evaluated its effects on mouse 
weight and blood counts in mice bearing those tumorgrafts. PT2399 did not induce weight 
loss, whereas sunitinib, at doses matching human exposures13, did (Fig. 1a). However, 
PT2399 caused modest anemia and leukopenia (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a).
We hypothesized that the reduction in hemoglobin (2.0 g/dL; p=0.0001) was due to 
decreased erythropoietin (EPO), which is regulated by HIF-215. Consistent with this notion,

 red blood cell precursors were decreased by 35% (p<0.0001; Fig. 1b) and EPO, which may 
serve as a pharmacodynamic marker, was suppressed by 75% (p<0.0001; Fig. 1b).
PT2399 decreased tumor growth by 60% across TGs (p<0.0001) (Fig. 1c). According to 
their responsiveness, TGs were classified into sensitive (tumor growth inhibition at last 
measurement >80%), intermediate (40–80%), and resistant (<40%) (Extended Data Table 1). 
Forty-five percent of TGs were sensitive (10/22), 23% intermediate, and 32% resistant (Fig. 
1d; Extended Data Fig. 1b and c). Sensitive tumors included tumors with aggressive 
sarcomatoid and rhabdoid features (Extended Data Table 1). Among ccRCCs, 56% (10/18) 
were sensitive. Unexpectedly, 4 ccRCCs were resistant, including 3 with VHL mutations 
(Extended Data Table 1).
PT2399 was more active than sunitinib (p=0.0126) (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b) and 
inhibited tumor growth in several sunitinib-resistant tumors (Fig. 1d). There was no bias in 
treatment allocation, as treatment groups were balanced (pre-trial: tumor size, p=0.11; tumor 
growth rate, p=0.22; and mouse weight, p=0.34). PT2399 reduced tumor cell density and 
increased fibrosis (Extended Data Fig. 1d and 1e). By Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
PT2399 inhibited tumor cell proliferation 3.5 fold (mean value change of −19.5 ±2.4; 
p<0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 1e and 1f). Inhibition of cell proliferation was also observed 
in live mice using 3'-[18F]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine PET/CT (Extended Data Fig. 1g and 
1h). In addition, PT2399 collapsed the tumor vasculature, decreasing vascular area 3-fold 
(p=0.0011) (Extended Data Fig. 1e and 1f). To determine whether changes in vascular area 
were due to inhibition of tumor VEGF, we exploited the species difference between graft 
(human) and host (mouse). PT2399 suppressed circulating human VEGF by 93%, but mouse 
VEGF was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Thus, tumor VEGF production, but not 
extratumoral VEGF, is HIF-2-dependent and inhibited by PT2399. This tumor selectivity 
represents a marked improvement over current angiogenesis inhibitors. VEGF production 
was also inhibited in sensitive tumors progressing on sunitinib in which PT2399 retained 
activity (Extended Data Fig. 2).
We evaluated the effects of PT2399 on HIF-2 in tumors. We immunoprecipitated (IP) the 
HIF-1β subunit, shared by both HIF-2α and HIF-1α. PT2399 specifically disassembled 
HIF-2 but not HIF-1 complexes (Fig. 2a). Similar results were observed using a proximity 
ligation assay (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, PT2399 reduced the expression of HIF-2 target 
genes (VEGF, SERPINE1 [encoding PAI-1], IGFBP3, CCND1 [encoding Cyclin D1], 
TGFA, and SLC2A1 [encoding GLUT1]) (all comparisons, p<0.05; Fig. 2c), but not HIF-1 
targets (CA9, PGK1, and LDHA).
Notably, PT2399 did not affect the majority of HIF-2 target genes in resistant tumors (Fig. 
2c). A modest decrease in VEGF mRNA did not translate into lower circulating VEGF (Fig. 
2d). However, as determined by reduced EPO (p=0.0002; Fig. 2d), Hif-2 was indeed 
inhibited by PT2399 in mice with resistant tumors. Furthermore, IP experiments showed that 
Hif-2 complexes were dissociated in resistant tumors (Fig. 2a). Thus, somewhat 
unexpectedly PT2399 disassembled HIF-2 in resistant tumors, but HIF-2 target genes were 
largely unaffected.

 To better characterize the effects of PT2399, we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on 
46 tumors (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). In sensitive tumors, we identified 492 RNAs 
deregulated by PT2399 (FDR≤0.05) (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Table 3). In contrast, the same 
analysis in resistant tumors found 0 genes deregulated by PT2399 (Fig. 2e and f). Similar 
results were obtained by an independent, blinded analysis (H.G and C.R.). The selective 
changes of PT2399 in sensitive tumors suggest that PT2399 sensitivity is linked to its ability 
to alter gene expression. Furthermore, the lack of gene expression changes in resistant 
tumours suggests that PT2399 is highly specific. Consistent with this notion, PT2399 had a 
lesser impact on overall gene expression than subtle differences across patients’ tumors 
(Extended Data Fig. 3a).
Extensive studies have evaluated HIF-2 target genes in ccRCC21–23. However, by leveraging 
(i) PT2399 specificity; (ii) RCC tumorgrafts, with minimal human stroma24; and (iii) an 
RNAseq algorithm excluding contaminating mouse (stromal) transcripts, we were uniquely 
enabled to define the HIF-2 program. Among the 492 deregulated RNAs in sensitive tumors, 
439 were protein coding, and 271 were downregulated including canonical HIF-2 targets 
previously examined (IGFBP3, SERPINE1, VEGF, CCND1) as well as LOX, CXCR4, IL6 
and REDD1 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Pathway and gene set enrichment analyses showed 
downregulation of cell cycle, DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoint, and DNA repair 
processes (Extended Data Table 4). Interestingly, regulation of DNA repair genes by HIF-2, 
previously observed in cell lines6, may explain ccRCC radioresistance. PT2399 increased 
the expression of 168 protein-coding genes, including fibrosis-related genes, such as 
PDGFD, HIF1A (previously shown to be induced by HIF-2α knockdown22), and FBP1, a 
gluconeogenic gene recently reported to suppress RCC progression25 (Fig. 2g; Extended 
Data Table 4).
We sought to identify a biomarker distinguishing sensitive from resistant tumors. We found 
that HIF-2α protein was expressed in 83% of cells in sensitive tumors compared to 23% in 
resistant (p<0.0001; Fig. 3a and b; Extended Data Fig. 4a). While there were differences 
even within tumors, higher HIF-2α expression in sensitive tumors was observed by western 
(Fig. 3c; Extended Data Fig. 4b) and RT-PCR (Fig. 3d). Lower, at times undetectable, 
HIF-2α levels in resistant tumors may explain the lack of PT2399 effects on gene expression 
in this group.
Next, we compared RNAseq datasets between vehicle-treated sensitive and resistant tumors. 
Using a rigorous Wilcox test, we identified 1,327 differentially expressed RNAs (Extended 
Data Table 3) including 94 (76 mRNAs) uniformly over- or under-expressed transcripts 
across every sensitive vs. resistant tumor sample (Extended Data Figure 2D; Extended Data 
Table 3). GLI1, a transcription factor of the sonic hedgehog family, and PTHLH 
(Parathyroid hormone-like hormone), a neuroendocrine peptide implicated in epithelial-
mesenchymal interactions and calcium ion transport, were uniformly overexpressed in 
sensitive tumors (Fig. 3e). Notably, HIF1A was increased in the resistant group (Fig. 3e). 
Increased expression of HIF-1α protein was also observed by IHC in some, but not all, 
resistant tumors (Extended Data Fig. 4a). EZH2 and MCAM were also overexpressed in 
resistant tumors (Fig. 3e).

 Overall, our data show that ccRCC can be classified into HIF-2 dependent and independent 
tumors and that these tumors differ in HIF-2α (and possibly, HIF-1α) levels and in their 
gene expression. These subtypes did not correlate with BAP1 and PBRM1 status26 in this 
small series (Extended Data Table 1). Our results point to different mechanisms of 
tumorigenesis downstream of VHL and may underlie differences in behavior or 
responsiveness to therapy.
Given differences in gene expression, we asked whether sensitive and resistant tumors 
diverged in imaging characteristics. We obtained CT scan images from patient tumors giving 
rise to tumorgrafts prior to surgery. The sensitive group was characterized by tumors with 
peripheral hypervascularity and a central non-enhancing area (typical of high-grade 
ccRCC27) and if present, tumor infiltration was focal (Extended Data Fig. 5). The resistant 
group was more heterogeneous, but several tumors were relatively hypovascular and 
diffusely infiltrating (Extended Data Fig. 5).
We asked whether sensitive tumors would acquire resistance. We exposed mice bearing 
tumours formed from a sensitive tumourgraft (XP164) to prolonged treatment with PT2399 
or sunitinib. Sunitinib resistance developed within 60 days (Fig. 4a; compare to Fig. 1D), but 
resistance to PT2399 took >100 days (Fig. 4a). PT2399 resistance was associated with 
increased tumor vascularity and higher tumor VEGF production (Fig. 4b). We sequenced the 
HIF-2α gene (EPAS1) and identified a c.968G>A heterozygous mutation resulting in a 
G323E substitution in one tumor (Fig. 4c). The mutation was absent in a vehicle-treated 
tumor and in the second resistant tumor (despite originating from the same parental tumor). 
Structural analyses of HIF-2 quaternary structure28 showed that G323 is at the entrance of 
the cavity, where PT2399 binds (Fig. 4d). Akin to engineered mutations19,29, a glutamate 
side chain would prevent PT2399 access. Consistent with this notion, PT2399 failed to 
dissociate HIF-2 complexes in mutant tumors (Fig. 4e).
We then sequenced HIF-1β from the second resistant tumor, and failed to identify a 
mutation. Nevertheless, HIF-2 complexes had reformed (Fig. 4e). The tumor was passaged 
in mice, which were maintained on PT2399, and remained resistant. IP experiments again 
showed dimeric HIF-2 complexes (Fig. 4f). Interestingly, sequencing of passaged tumors 
revealed a heterozygous c.1338C>A mutation resulting in a F446L substitution in the 
HIF-1β PAS-B domain (Fig. 4c). F446 is at the interface between HIF-1β and HIF-2α (Fig. 
4d). We postulate that F446L functions as a second-site suppressor mutation and that a more 
flexible side chain at the complex interface accommodates conformational changes induced 
by PT2399 allowing drug-bound HIF-2α to bind to HIF-1β. Both HIF-1β (F446L) and 
HIF-2α (G323E), when expressed in cells, were sufficient to preserve HIF-2 dimers despite 
PT2399 and the effects appeared additive (Fig. 4g). Overall, these results pave the way for 
second generation inhibitors and/or complementary approaches leveraging other potential 
drug-binding pockets recently revealed28.
Interestingly, a patient with metastatic ccRCC, whose tumour gave rise to a sensitive 
tumourgraft (XP165) enrolled in a phase 1 trial with PT238530 (NCT02293980). The 
patient, a 47 year old male, had originally presented with omental and abdominal wall 
metastases following a radical nephrectomy of a stage III ccRCC of high grade. After a

 failed attempt at surgical removal, he had received high-dose IL2, bevacizumab, sorafenib, 
everolimus, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib. Despite extensive pretreatment, he remained 
free of progression on PT2384 for more than 11 months (Extended Data Fig. 6). These data 
validate HIF-2 as a target for ccRCC, provide insight into HIF-2-mediated tumorigenesis, 
establish variable tumour dependency on HIF-2 identifying different ccRCC subtypes and 
associated biomarkers that may be incorporated in future clinical trials, showcase the 
specificity of PT2399, and anticipate mechanisms of resistance.
Materials and Methods
Nomenclature
Throughout the manuscript and figures, “XP” refers to the particular tumorgraft line. “V” 
refers to vehicle, “S” refers to sunitinib, and “P” refers to PT2399. Numbers following V, S, 
or P refer to the particular mouse identifier (ear tag) of that sample.
Drug trials
Drug trials in tumorgraft mice were done as previously described12,13. Briefly, ~64 mm3 
fragments of tissue from stably growing orthotopic tumorgrafts were implanted 
subcutaneously in 4–6 week old female and male NOD/SCID mice. When tumor volumes 
reached ~300–600 mm3, mice were segregated into treatment groups (3–5 mice/group) 
based on (i) tumor volume, (ii) growth rate, and (iii) mouse weight. A sample size of five 
mice per treatment arm gave us 80% power to detect a significant tumor volume differential 
at the 28th day after treatment between the reference arm and a treatment arm using a two-
sample t-test, assuming a true 600 mm3 tumor volume difference with a standard deviation 
of 250 and attrition margin of ~20%. Since the mixed model analysis uses ~8 repeated 
measures from each mouse, even with a few more covariates included in the model, the 
power will be similar or even higher. Vehicle (10% EtOH, 30% PEG400, 60% MCT [0.5% 
methyl cellulose, 0.5% Tween 80 (aq)]) was administered by gavage every 12 h. Sunitinib 
(LC Laboratories) was administered by oral gavage every 12 h at 10 mg/kg in 0.5% CMC in 
D5W. PT2399 (Peloton Therapeutics, Inc.) was administered at 100 mg/kg by oral gavage in 
10% EtOH, 30% PEG400, 60% MCT. Mouse weights were taken weekly and treatment 
doses were adjusted weekly. Tumors were generally measured twice a week using a digital 
caliper. While leading to an overestimation in tumor volumes, to minimize bias12, tumor 
volume was calculated by the formula: tumor volume = l × w × h, where l is the largest 
dimension of the tumor, w is the largest diameter perpendicular to l, and h is maximal height 
of the tumor. Trials typically lasted 4 weeks, but this varied depending upon tumor growth 
rates. Overall, >14,000 measurements were obtained. Assuming a digital caliper 
measurement error rate up to 10%, 99.8% of measurements where within protocol limits. 
Consideration was given to tumor growth rates, curve separation and the foreseeable need 
for additional mice for repeat experiments. Mice were monitored during treatment and 
provided appropriate veterinary care. In accordance with UT Southwestern’s Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) policies, animals were euthanized within 
timeframes specified by the veterinary staff once tumor diameters were greater than 2 cm. 
Mice were also euthanized if they exhibited signs of adverse clinical health. A total of n = 22 
tumorgraft trials were completed with n = 89 vehicle-treated tumors (Sensitive: n = 39;

 Intermediate: n = 22; Resistant: n = 28), n = 96 PT2399-treated tumors (Sensitive: n = 42; 
Intermediate: n = 24; Resistant: n = 30), and n = 82 sunitinib-treated tumors (Sensitive: n = 
32; Intermediate: n = 22; Resistant: n = 28).
Blood cell counts and hemoglobin measurements
Complete Blood Counts (CBC) (platelets, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and 
hemoglobin) were measured at the end of ~28 day trials and run on an IDEXX ProCyte Dx 
analyzer. CBCs were available for 17 tumorgraft trials, with 52 vehicle-treated mice, 58 
PT2399-treated mice (Sensitive: n = 13; Intermediate: n = 19; Resistant: n = 26), and 53 
sunitinib-treated mice (Sensitive: n = 8; Intermediate: n = 22; Resistant: n = 23).
PET/CT
3'-[18F]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine ([18]FLT) was synthesized at 160°C for 10 min using a GE 
FXN module through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between 2,3’-Anhydro-5’-O-
benzoyl-2’-deoxythymidine and [18F]KF in DMSO, followed by deprotecting the benzoyl 
group in 1N NaOH solution. The product was separated and purified by HPLC. The 
injection dose of [18]FLT was prepared in saline containing 10% ethanol. Small animal 
positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) imaging studies were 
performed on a Siemens Inveon PET/CT Multimodality System. PET/CT were conducted on 
mice with both orthotopic and subcutaneous tumors. Orthotopic tumorgrafts were implanted 
using 2–3 pieces of 2×2×2 mm tissue underneath the left renal capsule of NOD/SCID mice. 
Once tumors became palpable, a baseline PET/CT scan was performed, and within 72h, 
PT2399 treatment was started. PT2399 was continued for 8–10 days, when a second 
PET/CT was performed to assess tumor response. After injection with 0.12 mCi of [18]FLT 
via the tail-vein, and a 60 min wait period to allow for the radiotracer’s distribution and 
uptake, mice were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane, which was decreased to 2% during 
imaging. CT imaging was acquired at 80 kV and 500 μA with a focal spot of 58 μm. The 
PET imaging was acquired for 500 s directly following the acquisition of CT data. CT 
images were reconstructed with Cobra Reconstruction Software, and PET images were 
reconstructed using the OSEM3D algorithm. Reconstructed CT and PET images were fused 
and analyzed using the manufacturer’s software. For quantification, regions of interest were 
drawn aided by CT images and then quantitatively expressed as percent injected dose per 
gram of tissue (%ID/g).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using Dako Autostainer Link 48. The HIF-1α 
and HIF-2α immunohistochemical procedures and interpretations were standardized based 
on expression profiles in well-characterized cell lines (786-O, 786-O empty vector, and 786-
O VHL-reconstituted cell lines) and human ccRCC tissue with known expression for these 
two proteins by western blot. Multiple commercially available antibodies were evaluated and 
the antibodies with most consistent results were selected for further studies. Briefly, for 
HIF-1α and HIF-2α staining, after hydration, antigen retrieval was accomplished with 
EnVision™ FLEX Target Retrieval Solution, Low pH (K800521, Dako) in a 
Dakocytomation Pascal pressure cooker; Ki67 and CD31 antigen retrieval was done using a 
Dako PT Link. Slides were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Primary

 antibodies were added and incubated for 40 min at RT. Primary antibodies: HIF-1α (1:500, 
NB100-105, Novus), HIF-2α (1:200, sc-46691, Santa Cruz), Ki67 (ready-to-use, IR-626, 
Dako) and CD31 (1:200, LS-B1932, LifeSpan BioSciences). After rinsing with wash buffer, 
EnVision FLEX mouse/rabbit linker (K802121/K800921, Dako) was applied to the tissue 
and incubated for 10 min. Secondary antibody, EnVision™ FLEX/HRP (K800021, Dako), 
was incubated for 20 min. Sections were then processed using the Envision™ FLEX 
Substrate Working Solution for 10 min followed by dehydration in a standard ethanol/xylene 
series, and mounting media (8310-4, Thermo Scientific). IHC of HIF-1α and HIF-2α was 
performed on pre-treated tumorgraft tissue for n = 22 tumorgraft lines. Appropriate positive 
and negative controls were used with each run of immunostaining. The percentage of tumor 
cells in the entire section examined was recorded by a pathologist blinded to the western blot 
results. Only a 2 or 3+ nuclear positive reaction was considered as positive expression 
(staining scale: 0 = no staining, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong).
Proliferation index and microvessel quantitation
To assess tumor proliferation index, we performed immunostaining for Ki67, and to assess 
tumor microvessels we performed CD31 immunostaining on tumors following treatment 
with vehicle or PT2399. IHC was completed on n = 10 sensitive tumorgraft lines, with n = 
28 vehicle-treated tumors and n = 31 PT2399-treated tumors. Slides were digitally scanned 
using an Aperio Scanscope AT Turbo and reviewed using the Aperio eSlide Manager (ver. 
12.0.0.5040) and Imagescope (ver. 12.1.0.5029) systems (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, 
Australia). For Ki67, Aperio Genie (ver. 11.2) pattern recognition software was used to 
identify and select tumor areas for quantitative analysis with the Aperio Nuclear algorithm 
(version 11.2), yielding a percentage of tumor nuclei positive for Ki67. In a small subset of 
tumors where Genie inadequately identified tumor cells, representative tumor regions were 
manually selected (tumor necrosis areas were avoided) and reanalyzed. Quantitative 
measurements of microvessels including density, and average lumen area were obtained 
using the Aperio Microvessel algorithm (version 11.2) from manually-selected 
representative tumor regions.
Real-time PCR
RT-PCR data was generated for 16 tumorgraft trials, except for CA9 and LDHA, which were 
evaluated in 12 tumorgraft trials. Three samples were run concurrently for each tumor. Total 
RNA was isolated as described previously31. cDNA was synthesized using iScript™ Reverse 
Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (170-8841, Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed on a 
Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system using iTaq Universal SYBR Green SMX (1725124, 
Bio-Rad). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. Primers available upon request.
VHL Methylation
HIF2-I sensitive ccRCC tumorgrafts that had wild-type VHL status (XP164, XP373, XP453, 
and XP454) were tested for VHL methylation using the Affymetrix Promoter Methylation

 Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot
Tumor tissue was lysed in IP buffer containing 25 mM Tris•HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% 
NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, with 3–4 freeze/thaw cycles. 10–20% of 
the lysate was saved for input; 40 µg was mixed with 3× loading buffer (10% SDS, 33.3% 
glycerol, 300 mM DDT, 0.2% Bromophenol Blue) for input. After pre-clearing the lysate 
with 50 μl of a 1:1 solution of recombinant Protein G-Sepharose 4B (101242, Life 
Technologies) for 1 hour, 1 mg protein was mixed with 20 μl of ARNT/HIF-1β antibody 
(sc-55526, Santa Cruz) and rocked overnight at 4°C. 30 μl of Protein G-Sepharose 4B 
equilibrated with IP buffer were then added, rocked for 1 h at 4° C, and spun at 3,000 rpm 
for 10 seconds. The supernatant was removed and the beads washed 3 times with IP buffer 
containing DTT. 20 μl of 1× loading buffer was added to the beads and vortexed gently, then 
boiled for 5 minutes and spun at max speed for 5 minutes. The entire sample was loaded for 
western blot analysis. For western blot analysis, both HIF-1α antibody (A300-286A, Bethyl) 
and HIF-2α antibody (NB100-122, Novus) were diluted at 1:1,000 in 5% BSA and 
incubated overnight at 4° C. Tubulin antibody (T5168, Sigma) was diluted at 1:5,000. 
Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (31430, 31460, Pierce) followed by exposure to enhanced chemiluminescence 
substrate [mixing 1:1 solution 1 (2.5 mM luminol, 0.4 mM pCoumaric acid, 0.1 M Tris-HCl) 
and solution 2 (0.015% H2O2, 0.1 M Tris-HCl).
Sanger sequencing
Mutations in the PAS-B domain of HIF2A were identified with primers: Forward: 
GTGGTGCACACCCCTGCCCC; Reverse: CTGGGAAGCTTGGGCACCCCC; and in 
HIF1B with: Forward: GTCTCTGAAAGGAAGCATGAG; Reverse: 
CACATAGGGCATCAGAAGTG
Transfections
HEK293T cells (ATCC; no perceived need for authentication or mycoplasma testing) were 
cotransfected with the indicated expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 
following manufacturer’s instructions. After 36 h, cells were treated with PT2399 (10 µM) at 
37° C for 5 h, harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG beads (A2220-1ML, 
Sigma) and then subjected to western blot analysis. Plasmids laboratory database ID #206 
(HIF-1α) and #207 (HIF-2α) were used for in vitro translation. Plasmids #930 (pcDNA3.1 
Flag-HIF1β), #931 (pcDNA3.1 Flag-HIF1β [F446L]), #932 (pLVX HA-HIF-2α-IRES-
zsGreen), and #933 (pLVX-HA-HIF-2α [G323E]-IRES-zsGreen).
In Silico Structural Analysis
The G323E and F446L mutations were evaluated using PyMOL and Protein Data Bank 
4ZP428.
ELISA
Mouse VEGF (MMV00), Human VEGF (DVE00), and Mouse Erythropoietin (MEP00B) 
ELISA kits were from R&D Systems. Briefly, 50 μl of Assay Diluent was added to each

 mVEGF ELISA, a 2-fold and 5-fold dilution, respectively, of the serum was made with 
Calibrator Diluent. For hVEGF, no dilution was performed. Plates were incubated for 2 h at 
RT on a horizontal orbital microplate shaker, then aspirated and washed for a total of five 
washes. After the last wash, 100 μl of mEPO/mVEGF/hVEGF conjugate was added to each 
well and incubated for 2 h at RT on a shaker. Plates were washed five times with wash buffer 
and 100 μl of Substrate Solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at RT 
during which time the plates were covered to protect from the light. Stop Solution was then 
added to each well, with gentle tapping to ensure thorough mixing. The optical density of 
each well was determined using a microplate reader set to 450 nm. Wavelength correction 
was set to 540 nm. The final OD value was obtained by subtracting readings at 540 nm from 
the readings at 450 nm. ELISA data was generated for a total of 20 tumorgraft trials.
Proximity Ligation Assay
Mouse anti-HIF-1α (NB100-105, Novus), mouse anti-HIF-2α (sc-46691X, Santa Cruz) and 
Rabbit anti-ARNT/HIF-1β (A302-765A, Bethyl) were used. Primary antibodies were 
concentrated and buffers were exchanged using a Vivaspin 500 Centrifugal Concentrator 
(VS0131, Fisher Scientific). Antibodies were diluted to 1 mg/mL in PBS. Primary antibody 
conjugation was done with a Duolink® In Situ Probemaker MINUS/PLUS kit (DUO92010 
& DUO92009, Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, 2 µl of Conjugation Buffer was added to 20 µl of the 
antibody (1 mg/ml), mixed gently, transferred to one vial of lyophilized oligonucleotide 
(PLUS or MINUS), and incubated at RT overnight. 2 µl of Stop Reagent was then added to 
the reaction and incubated at RT for 30 min. 24 µl of Storage Solution was added and the 
conjugation stored at 4°C. Tumor tissue was blocked with PBS-T (0.1% Triton X-100) + 1% 
BSA for 30 min after antigen retrieval. Conjugated HIF1-α-MINUS, HIF2-α-MINUS and 
ARNT-PLUS were diluted in blocking buffer containing 1× Assay Reagent (20×) at a 
dilution of 1:50, 1:50, and 1:200, respectively. The mixture was allowed to sit for 20 min at 
RT before diluted primary antibody was added to each sample. Slides were incubated in a 
humidity chamber overnight 4°C. Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagents Red (DUO92008, 
Sigma-Aldrich) were used for signal detection. Briefly, slides were washed with Wash 
Buffer A, ligation solution containing ligase at a 1:40 dilution was added, and slides were 
incubated in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 30 min at 37°C. After washing in 1× Wash 
Buffer A with gentle agitation, amplification solution containing polymerase was added at a 
1:80 dilution, and slides were then incubated in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 100 min 
at 37°C. After washing slides in 1× Wash Buffer B and then 0.01× Wash Buffer B, slides 
were dried at RT in the dark, and mounted with a cover slip using a minimal volume of 
Duolink In Situ Mounting Medium with DAPI (DUO82040, Sigma-Aldrich). After 
approximately 15 min, slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus) using a 
40× objective. Image analysis was done with the Image J 1.48V program. Pictures of 3 fields 
for each sample were used. At least 100 cells of each sample were counted.
RNA sequencing
23 vehicle- and 23 PT2399-treated tumor RNA samples, including 5 sensitive XPs (XP144, 
XP164, XP373, XP374, and XP453) and 4 resistant XPs (XP169, XP296, XP490, and 
XP506) underwent RNA sequencing at the New York Genome Center. RNA sequencing 
libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit.

 Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA was purified by oligo-dT beads selecting for polyadenylated 
RNA species and fragmented by divalent cations under elevated temperature. The 
fragmented RNA underwent first strand synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random 
primers. Second strand synthesis created the cDNA fragments using DNA polymerase I. 
Following RNaseH treatment, the cDNA fragments went through end repair, adenylation of 
the 3’ ends, and ligation of adapters. The cDNA library was enriched using 8 cycles of PCR 
and purified. Quality control consisted of assaying the final library size using the Agilent 
Bioanalyzer and quantifying the final library by RT- PCR and PicoGreen (fluorescence) 
methods. A single peak between 250–350 bp indicated a properly constructed and amplified 
library ready for sequencing. Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 using v4 SBS 
chemistry according to the Illumina protocol, as described32. Sequencing libraries were 
loaded onto the HiSeq 2500 flowcell for clustering on the cBot using the instrument-specific 
clustering protocol. Given HiSeq 2500 capabilities (200–250M passed filter 2×50bp 
sequencing reads per flow cell lane), we sequenced 5 samples per lane in order to obtain a 
minimum of 50M PF reads per sample. With one exception, >100 million reads were 
obtained per sample (median 146,644,355; 95% distribution-free CI: 142,380,928 – 
151,324,826; Extended Data Table 1). Any gene with more than 50 reads in any sample was 
kept; only genes that had low reads in all of the samples were removed. This left 20,667 
genes after removal of pseudogenes. cDNA sequences were aligned to a combined index of 
mouse and human reference sequences with STAR v 2.4.0c. Mouse reads were filtered out 
and the remaining reads were re-mapped to the NCBI hg37 using STAR aligner (v2.3.1z)33. 
Quantification of genes annotated in Gencode v19 was performed using HTSeq34. Picard 
and RSeQC35 were used to collect QC metrics (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). 
Differential gene expression analysis was measured using edgeR36. A false discovery rate 
(FDR) cutoff of 0.05 was applied to identify the statistically significant genes between 
comparison groups. FDR was calculated using Benjamini and Hochberg method37 for 
adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing.
RNA Seq data was deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (SRP073253). For RNAseq 
data, the TG number is preceded by an “S” for sensitive or “R” for resistant followed by 
treatment and ear tag. Sample1 (S144-P4340), Sample2 (S144-P4342), Sample3 (S164-

 Statistical Analyses
Apart from the RNAseq analysis, all reported p-values were obtained from two-tailed tests at 
the 0.05 significance level. All bar charts depict the mean with the error bar representing 
s.e.m., while all boxplots have median center values with fences extending to the greatest 
value inside the upper and lower fences (1.5[IQR] away from the 75th and 25th percentiles, 
respectively). Transformations were used where indicated to meet normality assumptions for 
analysis. These tests were completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Except 
where indicated, the experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not 
blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

includes analyses from 11 vehicle-treated tumors and 11 PT2399-treated tumors (3 fields 
were analyzed for each sample) in 5 sensitive, 3 intermediate, and 3 resistant tumorgraft 
trials. Scale bars = 20 µM. c, qRT-PCR for the indicated HIF-2 target genes in PT2399 
sensitive, intermediate, and resistant tumors treated with vehicle (blue), PT2399 (red), or 
sunitinib (green). HIF-1 target genes CA9, PGK1, and LDHA included as negative controls. 
Excepting PGK1 and LDHA, samples were available for n = 58 vehicle-treated tumors 
(Sensitive: n = 11; Intermediate: n = 21; Resistant: n = 26), n = 62 PT2399-treated tumors 
(Sensitive: n = 15; Intermediate: n = 21; Resistant: n = 26), and n = 52 sunitinib-treated 
tumors (Sensitive: n = 10; Intermediate: n = 23; Resistant: n = 19). PGK1 and LDHA were 
available for 24 tumors for each treatment group (Sensitive: n = 6; Intermediate: n = 8; 
Resistant: n = 10). d, Circulating tumor-produced hVEGF as well as mouse EPO levels in 
mice with sensitive, intermediate, and resistant tumors treated with vehicle (blue), PT2399 
(red), and sunitinib (green). ELISA data was generated for 63 vehicle-treated tumors 
(Sensitive: n = 21; Intermediate: n = 19; Resistant: n = 23), 74 PT2399-treated tumors 
(Sensitive: n = 27; Intermediate: n = 21; Resistant: n = 26), and 61 sunitinib-treated tumors 
(Sensitive: n = 15; Intermediate: n = 23; Resistant: n = 23). e, Number of RNAs upregulated 
and downregulated genes by PT2399 in sensitive and resistant tumors. f, Heatmap 
representation from RNAseq analysis showing differentially-regulated genes by PT2399 in 
sensitive compared to resistant tumors. Removal of an unclassified tumor (XP169) from the 
resistant group, did not affect conclusions. g, RNAseq analyses showing increased 
expression of selected genes by PT2399 in sensitive tumors. b–d, g: Tests completed using a 
mixed model with compound symmetrical covariance structure for mice in the same 
tumorgraft line using vehicle as the reference group. qRT-PCR levels were log-transformed 
for analysis; EPO and hVEGF levels were Box-Cox transformed; RNAseq levels were log2-
transformed; Raw values depicted in all graphs. All bar charts depict the mean with the error

sensitive tumors were different from intermediate or resistant. Bar chart depicts the mean 
with the error bar representing s.e.m. d, e: Tests completed using a mixed model analysis 
with compound symmetrical covariance structure for mice in the same tumorgraft line. 
RNAseq values were log2-transformed for analysis; Raw values depicted in all graphs. Bar 
charts depict individual RNA-seq values, while all boxplots have median centre values. **, p 
< 0.01; and ****, p < 0.0001. See Supplementary Fig. 1 for gel source data.

 Fig. 4. Acquired resistance following prolonged PT2399 exposure
a, Tumor volumes from a cohort of mice of the XP164 tumorgraft line treated with vehicle 
(blue lines, n=2; V3286 and V3299); sunitinib until the development of resistance (green 
lines, n = 2; S3295 and S3296; compare to Fig. 1d); or PT2399 (red lines, n = 2; P3283 and 
P3288). b, Circulating human VEGF levels in mice treated for the indicated number of days 
(d) showing increased tumor-produced VEGF with development of resistance (all bars, n = 
2). c, Bidirectional chromatograms from tumorgrafts developing resistance compared to 
controls: P3283 (c.968G>A in EPAS1 [HIF2A] leading to a G323E) and P5123 (derived 
from P3288; c.1338C>A in ARNT [HIF1B] leading to a F446L). d, Crystal structure of 
PAS-B domains from HIF-2α bound to HIF-1β (PDB entry 4ZP428) highlighting side 
chains of G323 (lining opening of PT2399 binding pocket in HIF-2α) and F446 (in HIF-1β 
at the interface with HIF-2α). In another structure (PDB entry 4GHI18) quaternary 
arrangement between HIF-2α and HIF-1β PAS-B domains differs, but F446 remains at the 
interface. e, HIF-1β IP from XP164 tumorgrafts before and after (red) development of

 resistance showing reformation of HIF-2α/HIF-1β complexes following the acquisition of 
resistance (V, vehicle; P, PT2399). f, HIF-1β IP from tumors of mice with HIF-2α or HIF-1β 
mutations (or wild-type controls) treated with PT2399 (n=3 mice per group). g, FLAG IP 
from HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged HIF-1β (FLAG-
HIF-1β; FLAG-HIF-1β-F446L) or HA-tagged HIF-2α (HA-HIF-2α; HA-HIF-2α-G323E) 
and treated with either vehicle or PT2399. See Supplementary Fig. 1 for gel source data.
