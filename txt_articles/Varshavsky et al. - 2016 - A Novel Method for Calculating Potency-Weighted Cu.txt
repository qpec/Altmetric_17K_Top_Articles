Abstract
Phthalates are ubiquitous chemicals linked to hormonal disruptions that affect reproduction and 
development. Multiple antiandrogenic phthalates exposure during fetal development can have 
greater impacts than individual exposure; thus, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 
recommends them for cumulative assessment. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey data (NHANES, 2001–2012), we developed a potency-weighted sum of daily intake 
(Σandrogen-disruptor; µg/kg/day) of di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), 
butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) based on NAS 
recommendations, and included diethyl phthalate (DEP) and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) in 
additional metrics (2005–2012). We compared racial/ethnic differences in Σandrogen-disruptor 
among 2842 reproductive-aged women. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the influence of 
potency assumptions, alternate urine dilution adjustment methods, and weighting phthalate 
metabolites directly rather than daily intake estimates of parent compounds. We found that DEHP 
contributed most to Σandrogen-disruptor (48–64%), and that Σandrogen-disruptor decreased over 
time. Black women generally had higher cumulative exposures than white women, although the 
magnitude and precision of the difference varied by model specification. Our approach provides a 
blueprint for combining chemical exposures linked to common adverse outcomes, and should be 
considered in future exposure, risk, and epidemiological studies.

INTRODUCTION
Phthalate esters are hormonally active chemicals linked to a wide range of health outcomes. 
Fetal phthalate exposures cause a group of male reproductive problems known as the 
“phthalate syndrome” in animals, which includes birth defects of the testes and penis (e.g., 
cryptorchidism, hypospadias), low sperm count, and infertility.1 Human studies support an 
association between developmental phthalate exposures and male reproductive effects.2–6 
Certain phthalates, such as di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), butyl 
benzyl phthalate (BBzP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and diisononyl phthalate 
(DiNP), exert toxicity primarily through androgen disruption.1
Phthalate exposures are ubiquitous due to their widespread use in myriad consumer and 
personal care products.7,8 Biomonitoring studies show the U.S. population is exposed to 
multiple phthalates simultaneously.9–12 Animal studies demonstrate that phthalate mixtures 
result in higher male reproductive risk than individual phthalates, especially during fetal 
development.13–15 Human studies also find higher risks from multiple phthalates.2,5 In 2008, 
the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended phthalates and other antiandrogens 
for cumulative risk assessment based on their ability to cause common adverse outcomes 
(i.e., changes in testosterone concentration during development) rather than shared 
mechanisms of action (i.e., how testosterone concentration is disrupted).1 More recent 
mixture studies confirm NAS findings and further highlight the need to consider the joint 
effects of co-occurring phthalates.16–19 However, advancements in the epidemiology of 
phthalate mixtures are limited by current methods for characterizing cumulative 
exposures.20
Identifying high-risk subpopulations for cumulative exposure warrants examination since 
individual phthalate profiles may not accurately represent the distribution of overall 
phthalate burden. Individual phthalate exposures have been shown to vary by race/ethnicity 
and socioeconomic status (SES), often in opposing directions.9,21–24 For example, DnBP 
and BBzP are higher in low SES groups, while DEHP exposure is lower in the same 
subpopulation.22,23 Characterizing cumulative exposure inequalities may help elucidate 
health disparities and identify solutions that better protect those at increased risk of exposure 
and disease.25

 In this paper, we develop a potency-weighted metric of androgen-disrupting phthalates using 
2008 NAS recommendations and examine demographic differences in cumulative phthalates 
exposure among U.S. reproductive-aged women. We focus on women of reproductive age 
because in utero development has been identified as the most sensitive window for phthalate 
toxicity,1 and previous work suggests that phthalate exposures among reproductive-aged and 
pregnant women are similar12 but often distinct from other subpopulations.26
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We pooled data from six cycles (2001–2012) of the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey and physical 
examination of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population conducted by the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). 
The study population was limited to females aged 15–44 years (N = 3480). Of these, we 
further excluded 544 women who self-identified as a race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American, who together comprise 86% of the total 
population. We also excluded participants who did not have at least one phthalate metabolite 
measurement (N = 94), resulting in a final sample size of 2842 participants.
Phthalate Metabolite Measurements
In each NHANES survey cycle, phthalate metabolites are measured in one-third of survey 
participants. Analytical methods are described elsewhere.27 Briefly, spot urine samples are 
collected as part of the NHANES medical examination and analyzed at the CDC’s National 
Center for Environmental Health (Atlanta, GA). Phthalate metabolites are quantified using 
high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.27,28 
Laboratory files were downloaded from the NHANES web site in March 2015 and included 
necessary impurity corrections for some previously used analytical standards.29 Not all 
phthalate metabolites are measured in every NHANES cycle, and limits of detection (LOD) 
for each metabolite can vary by cycle. Thus, we used the maximum LOD for each phthalate 
metabolite and substituted concentrations below the LOD with a value equal to the LOD 
divided by the square root of 2.11,30
Cumulative Exposure Metric
To characterize cumulative exposure to androgen-disrupting phthalates, we calculated a 
potency-weighted aggregate sum (Σandrogen-disruptor) of four phthalates (DnBP, DiBP, 
BBzP, and DEHP) that are recognized as antiandrogenic by the NAS and whose metabolites 
were measured in every cycle between 2001 and 2012 (Figure 1, model 1). The primary 
hydrolytic metabolites for DnBP, DiBP, BBzP, and DEHP, respectively, are mono-n-butyl 
phthalate (MnBP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and 
mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). MEHP further metabolizes to oxidative 
metabolites: mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-
hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate 
(MECPP).

 To calculate unitless relative potency factors (RPFs) for the four phthalates, we used NAS 
phthalate-specific benchmark doses (BMDs) (mg/kg/day), which are statistically derived 
doses related to a predefined change from controls in benchmark response (BMR) (in this 
case a 5% reduction in testosterone concentration, or a BMR equal to 5%) (Table 1).1,31 
BMDs were used rather than the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) on 
the BMD (BMDL) because we are comparing across chemicals.31 In the NAS analysis, 
DnBP had the highest potency, or lowest BMD. Therefore, we derived RPFs by dividing the 
DnBP reference BMD by that of each phthalate.
(1)
Because BMDs are based on phthalate doses administered to laboratory animals and not 
metabolite concentrations, we estimated the daily intake of parent phthalate compounds 
(µg/kg/day) from measured urinary metabolites (ng/mL = µg/L) using a pharmacokinetic 
modeling equation adapted from previous studies.32,33
(2)
where MEi is the urinary concentration of metabolite per gram of creatinine (µg/g) for each 
phthalate, CE is the creatinine excretion rate normalized by body weight (mg/kg/day), FUE,i 
is the molar fraction of urinary excreted metabolite related to parent compound for each 
phthalate (unitless), 1000 is a conversion factor (i.e., mg/g), and MWp and MWm are the 
molecular weights of the parent phthalates and metabolites, respectively.
Although creatinine excretion rates vary across racial/ethnic groups, we initially assumed a 
uniform creatinine excretion rate of 18 mg/kg/day34 for all participants. We calculated 
creatinine-adjusted concentrations (ME) for each participant by dividing their measured 
urinary concentrations (µg/L) by their measured urinary creatinine concentration (g/L). The 
fractional urinary excretion values, or FUE, are 0.69, 0.69, and 0.73 for DnBP, DiBP, and 
BBzP, respectively.35,36 The values for MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP are 0.062, 0.149, and 
0.109, respectively. MECPP was not included as a DEHP metabolite for 2001–2012 analyses 
because it was not measured in all survey cycles, but it was included in 2005–2012 analyses 
with an FUE of 0.132.37 Potency-weighted daily intake estimates of Σandrogen-disruptor, 
expressed in µg/kg/day, were then calculated by summing the products of RPFs and daily 
intakes for each phthalate. (See Figure S1 for sample calculations.)

In addition to our original metric (Figure 1, model 1), we calculated a second version of 
Σandrogen-disruptor by adding diethyl phthalate (DEP) and DiNP to model 1 (Figure 1, 
model 2a). While DEP does not exhibit antiandrogenic properties in laboratory studies,35 
several epidemiologic studies report an association between MEP and male reproductive

 health end points, although findings are inconsistent.3,5,6 Therefore, we assumed DEP to 
have a low but nonzero potency equal to 1 order of magnitude less than the least potent 
phthalate in our model (RPF = 1/10 multiplied by 0.24, or 0.024). Monoethyl phthalate 
(MEP) is the primary metabolite of DEP, and DEP was assumed to have the same FUE as 
DnBP.32 We also added DiNP to the metric since it has been recognized as an 
antiandrogenic phthalate.1,35 Since DiNP’s primary metabolite, mono(carboxy-isooctyl) 
phthalate (MCOP), was not measured before 2005, model 2a was examined in 2005–2012 
participants only (N = 1723). DiNP was assumed to be 2.3 times less potent than DEHP.18 
We used an FUE value of 0.099 for MCOP.37
Data Analysis
We conducted analyses using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 
Since we combined multiple cycles of data, we calculated new sample population weights 
according to NHANES analytical guidelines.38 All analyses were adjusted for sample 
population weights and the NHANES clustered sample design. We defined statistical 
significance at p < 0.05 on two-sided tests and considered p < 0.10 to be marginally 
significant. We natural-log-transformed Σandrogen-disruptor to account for its non-normal 
distribution. We calculated the geometric mean (GM) and 95% CI for Σandrogen-disruptor 
and for each phthalate parent compound as well as the percent contribution of each phthalate 
to the cumulative metric.
We used analysis of variance and linear regression to examine bivariate associations between 
Σandrogen-disruptor and sociodemographic, temporal, and biological variables. Socio-
demographic characteristics included the following: age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, Mexican American), educational attainment (less than high school 
diploma; high school graduate; or post high school education, with women under 20 years 
old treated the same as women aged 20 and above), household income (below or above 
poverty level as defined by poverty to income ratio), and body mass index (BMI) 
[underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–25 kg/m2), overweight (25–30 kg/m2), 
and obese (≥30 kg/m2)]. The NHANES survey cycle was used as a proxy for time. We 
included sampling session (morning, afternoon, or evening) as a proxy variable for time of 
sample collection to help adjust for fasting time. Lastly, we considered the percent of total 
DEHP metabolites excreted as the primary metabolite (MEHP%). Hauser et al.39 suggest 
that higher MEHP% may reflect less complete DEHP metabolism or excretion. 
Consequently, higher MEHP% would indicate greater susceptibility to DEHP exposure.
The core regression model included our main effect (race/ethnicity), educational attainment, 
income, age, and BMI. We included other covariates if they were significant predictors of 
the outcome in bivariate analyses or if their inclusion changed the effect estimate for race/
ethnicity by more than 20%. We also tested for statistical interaction between race/ethnicity 
and survey cycle, with survey cycle dichotomized as <2005 and ≥2005.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted three sensitivity analyses. First, we assessed the influence of DEP on our 
metric (Figure 1; model 2b) by increasing its potency to the least potent phthalate in our

 model (RPF = 0.24). Second, we removed 342 pregnant women from our models to evaluate 
their influence on the original analysis.
Third, we examined the potential for exposure misclassification by comparing Σandrogen-
disruptor to several other cumulative metrics, which were constructed with alternate urine 
dilution adjustment methods. We estimated urine flow rate (UFR) in milliliters per day for 
2009–2012 NHANES participants (N = 728) by dividing the volume of urine collected by 
self-reported amount of time since last void. UFR is a more direct method to correct for 
urine dilution than creatinine, which is considered a surrogate for urine dilution. We 
calculated an RPF-weighted sum (eq 3) based on UFR (Σurine-flow) with the following 
daily intake equation:
(4)
where UMEi is the measured urinary concentration of metabolite (µg/L) for each phthalate, 
UE is the UFR normalized by body weight (mL/kg/day), and all other variables are the same 
as in eq 2. This approach is equivalent to calculating creatinine excretion rates for each study 
participant (urinary creatinine concentration multiplied by UE) in eq 2, rather than using a 
uniform value for all participants. We then used UFR to calculate metabolite excretion rate, 
or the amount of metabolite excreted per day (µg/day) by multiplying UME by UFR. We 
used eq 3 to apply RPF weights directly to metabolite excretion rates (Σexrate-rpf), 
assuming that daily metabolite excretion is proportional to daily parent phthalate compound 
intake. For comparability, we also applied potency weights directly to measured urinary 
metabolite concentrations (Σmetab-rpf) (µg/L). See Figure S2 for a diagram of urine dilution 
adjustment methods.
We then assessed the correlation between metrics using Spearman’s rank correlation (rs) and 
compared regression results for race/ethnicity between Σandrogen-disruptor, Σurine-flow, 
Σexrate-rpf, and Σmetab-rpf (with and without creatinine as an independent variable in the 
model as suggested by Barr et al. 2005) (Figure 1, models 3a–3e).40 We also correlated our 
metric to that of other cumulative phthalate metrics used in previous studies, including molar 
sums of low and high molecular weight phthalates (Σlow-mw and Σhigh-mw),24,41–45 and 
three approaches implemented by the Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel (CHAP) on Phthalates 
and Phthalate Alternatives.35 We constructed Σchap-1, Σchap-2, and Σchap-3 using eqs 2 
and 3, with relative potencies obtained from CHAP case studies. The CHAP calculates 
reference doses (RfDs) using uncertainty factors (UFs) and BMDLs, no observed adverse 
effect levels (NOAELs), and lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs). Table S1 
compares our approach to the three CHAP approaches.
RESULTS
Among all phthalates, DEHP and DEP had the highest daily intake (GM > 2.45 µg/kg/day) 
and DiBP and BBzP had the lowest (GM < 0.30 µg/kg/day) (Table 1). In both primary 
metrics (models 1 and 2a), DEHP contributed the largest percentage (48 and 64%) to the

 cumulative androgen-disruption measure. The cumulative GM ranged from 2.58 (95% CI: 
2.44, 2.72) to 4.22 (95% CI: 3.96, 4.51) µg/kg/day, depending on whether DEP and DiNP 
were included in the metric (Table S2).
Between 2001 and 2012, Σandrogen-disruptor decreased by 54% (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2). 
This downward trend over time in cumulative phthalates exposure was evident for all races. 
Daily intake of DBnP, BBzP, DEHP, and DEP decreased by 40–70%, while DiBP and DiNP 
increased by 150–380% over the study period (p < 0.0001) (Figure S3). The relative ranking 
of racial/ethnic groups changed over time for most individual phthalates, although black 
women consistently had higher DEP exposures than white women. For Σandrogen-disruptor, 
there was evidence of multiplicative interaction between race/ethnicity and time (pinteraction 
= 0.025). Compared to 2001–2004, phthalate levels decreased in later years for black and 
white women (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0004, respectively), but not in Mexican American 
women (p = 0.177).
In 2001–2012 adjusted models, we observed 12% higher levels of Σandrogen-disruptor in 
black women compared to white women (p = 0.03) (Table 2 and Figure 1, model 1). When 
we restricted the sample to 2005–2012 and included DEP and DiNP in the metric, the 
difference in Σandrogen-disruptor between black and white women changed substantially 
and was no longer significant (p = 0.77) (model 2a).
When we raised DEP’s potency to the least potent phthalate in our models, the difference 
between black and white women increased from 2% in model 2a to 13% in model 2b and 
became marginally significant (from p = 0.77 to p = 0.08, respectively) (Table 2 and Figure 
1). We did not observe a difference in any of our results when we removed pregnant women 
from the analysis (data not shown).
We found high correlation between Σandrogen-disruptor and Σurine-flow (2009–2012 data; 
Table 3, rs = 0.83). The two metrics produced different but overlapping estimates for racial/
ethnic disparities. There were no significant differences between racial/ethnic groups for 
Σandrogen-disruptor, whereas black women had 22% (95% CI: −45, 0) higher levels than 
white women in the Σurine-flow model (Table S3 and Figure 1, models 3a and 3b).
We observed high correlations between both daily intake metrics and the metric that weights 
metabolite excretion rates by RPFs (Σexrate-rpf) (Table 3, rs range = 0.7–0.9), and moderate 
correlations between daily intake metrics and weighted urinary phthalate metabolites 
(Σmetab-rpf) (rs range = 0.5–0.6). Racial/ethnic differences were significant in regression 
models when the outcomes were Σexrate-rpf and Σmetab-rpf without creatinine correction. 
We observed 32% (95% CI: −51, −13) higher exposures in black women than in white 
women in the Σexrate-rpf model (Table S3 and Figure 1, model 3c). In the Σmetab-rpf model 
without creatinine correction, black women had 59% (95% CI: −80, −38) higher levels than 
white women, but the difference decreased to 12% (95% CI: −27, 3) when creatinine was 
added as an independent covariate (models 3d and 3e).
Correlation of Σandrogen-disruptor and Σurine-flow with low molecular weight metabolites 
(Σlow-mw) was low (Table 3, rs < 0.20), but the daily intake metrics were more highly 
correlated with high molecular weight metabolites (Σhigh-mw) (rs = 0.62). We additionally

 found that our Σandrogen-disruptor metric was highly correlated with CHAP metrics (rs > 
0.80), with CHAP case 2 being the most highly correlated.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed an approach for calculating potency-weighted cumulative 
exposure of co-occurring phthalates that contribute to common adverse outcomes using 2008 
NAS recommendations and NHANES biomonitoring data. We created several alternate 
methods to assess the relative importance of potency estimates for individual phthalates (i.e., 
DEP) as well as approaches for urine dilution adjustment and daily intake estimation. In our 
assessment of racial/ethnic differences, we found that black women generally had higher 
exposure to multiple androgen-disrupting phthalates than white women, although the 
magnitude and precision of the difference varied by model specification.
To our knowledge, this is the first assessment using NAS recommendations to profile racial/
ethnic differences in cumulative androgen-disrupting phthalates. When we pooled 2001–
2012 NHANES data, black women had 12% higher cumulative body burden levels of 
androgen-disrupting phthalates than white women, thereby increasing their potential risk of 
adverse androgen-dependent outcomes. However, cumulative phthalate levels were similar 
across racial/ethnic groups when we restricted analysis to 2005–2012 data. In other models, 
raising DEP potency and using metabolite-based metrics generally increased exposure 
disparities between white and black women. For example, when we modeled measured 
metabolites without urine dilution adjustment, the difference was as high as 60%.
Reasons for racial/ethnic differences in cumulative exposure might include variations in 
health and behavior patterns that contribute to exposure, such as personal care product use, 
dietary habits, and medication intake.8,21,35,46–48 For example, vaginal douching and fast 
food consumption have both been shown to vary by race and are associated with higher 
phthalate body burden levels.21,46 Observed racial/ethnic differences in creatinine excretion, 
notably that black women have higher creatinine levels than other racial/ethnic groups,40 
may be one factor in this difference. Biological differences in phthalate metabolism/
excretion and urine dilution may also contribute to racial differences of cumulative 
phthalates exposure.
We observed an overall downward trend in cumulative phthalates exposure among all racial 
groups across survey years, consistent with temporal trends reported for the general U.S. 
population.30 Zota et al. hypothesize that declines in DnBP, BBzP, DEHP, and DEP may be 
attributable to legislative activity and public advocacy campaigns recently targeting 
consumers, chemical companies, and product manufacturers.30 They further suggest that the 
rise in DiBP and DiNP over time might reflect industry replacement strategies in response to 
public and regulatory pressure.
DEP impacts cumulative phthalates exposure disparities due to its high concentration, even 
though its relative contribution to the cumulative metric is minimal. When we raised DEP’s 
potency, the gap between white and black women increased because DEP exposure is 
consistently greater in black women compared to white women over time. The inclusion of

 DEP adds uncertainty to the analysis since animal studies indicate that DEP is not 
antiandrogenic and human studies are equivocal.3,5,6,35 However, NAS suggests that 
phthalates and other compounds be included in a cumulative assessment if there is reason to 
believe they may contribute to common adverse outcomes.1 Furthermore, the toxicity of 
DEP in combination with other phthalates has not been sufficiently evaluated. Given this 
compound’s widespread prevalence in humans, more research is needed to understand 
DEP’s risk profile in mixtures and determine whether it should be included in a cumulative 
exposure metric.
Our sensitivity analysis revealed that regression modeling results differ depending on how 
adjustments for urine dilution are made and whether or not daily intake estimates or 
measured urinary metabolites are used in the outcome variable. Metabolite excretion rates 
and urine concentrations both resulted in large and significant exposure disparities between 
white and black women, although including creatinine as a covariate in the latter model 
attenuated this difference. While daily intake estimates that assumed a uniform creatinine 
excretion rate for the study population did not demonstrate a significant difference between 
racial/ethnic groups, urine flow rate adjustment (equivalent to using creatinine excretion 
rates for each individual) revealed a marginally significant exposure disparity between black 
and white women.
There is current debate about the best approach for urine dilution correction in spot samples 
of nonpersistent chemicals like phthalates. Several researchers suggest that metabolite 
excretion rate calculation minimizes exposure misclassification error because it provides for 
direct urine dilution adjustment, unlike other methods, including creatinine and specific 
gravity correction, which are imperfect proxies for urine dilution.40,49–51 Christensen et al.49 
report on phthalates specifically, demonstrating through simulation that metabolite excretion 
rates and urine metabolite concentrations lead to the least biased associations between 
phthalate exposure and BMI, while creatinine correction and daily intake estimation lead to 
the most biased associations. This may be one reason why we observed high correlation yet 
differing regression results between daily intake estimates and metabolite excretion rates.
Inherent uncertainty exists when extrapolating from measured metabolites to daily intake of 
parent compounds. In particular, variability of FUE, the molar amount of excreted metabolite 
relative to parent phthalate intake, can greatly impact regression results. For example, the 
percent contribution of DiNP to the cumulative metric becomes larger with daily intake 
calculation, due to a relatively small FUE. On the other hand, the use of pharmacokinetic-
based daily intake calculations is warranted since our proposed benchmark doses were 
derived from studies administering parent compounds to animals.1,14
Ideally, we recommend constructing daily intake cumulative metrics from urine flow rate 
data and comparing regression results across weighted metabolite excretion rates and 
measured metabolite concentrations (with and without creatinine as an independent 
variable). However, many researchers may not have access to quality urine flow rate data, 
since at the very least full urine void and time since last void are necessary to estimate daily 
excretion rates. In this case, researchers can either calculate daily intake using a uniform 
value for creatinine excretion rate or apply potency estimates to the metabolites directly and

 sum them. Our sensitivity analysis positioned metabolite excretion rate modeling results in 
between the more extreme (i.e., measured metabolites without urine dilution adjustment) 
and null (i.e., daily intakes, creatinine adjustment) disparity findings. However, a more 
rigorous analysis of potential error introduced by each approach is warranted in future 
studies. Additionally, future research should evaluate how our method could be applied to 
metabolite levels adjusted for specific gravity.
While we found high correlation between our metric and those of the CHAP, there were 
some differences. DiNP potency varied between metrics. We did not base DiNP’s relative 
potency on NAS benchmark doses since these data were not available, but instead used 
findings from a separate study that assessed DiNP’s potency with the same end point (fetal 
testosterone concentration).18 CHAP case 2 used an equivalent potency for DiNP and 
demonstrated the highest correlation with our metric. DiNP is 1–2 orders of magnitude less 
potent in CHAP cases 1 and 3, based on older studies and other antiandrogenic end 
points,35,52 one possible reason for the lower correlation with our approach. All four 
approaches ranked DiNP as less potent than DEHP; however, other end points may be more 
or less sensitive to DiNP compared to DEHP. Thus, future cumulative assessments should 
include DiNP and use more recent potency assumptions such as ours.18
The CHAP approaches also differ in DEHP’s potency determination. CHAP cases 1 and 3 
ranked DEHP as the most potent phthalate by at least 1 order of magnitude, while ours and 
CHAP case 2 ranked DEHP relatively lower. One reason for this variation is that CHAP 
used a NOAEL for DEHP based on different antiandrogenic end points. Many problems 
have been identified with using NOAELs and LOAELs, including the values are influenced 
by experimental design.1,31 Larger studies can result in lower NOAELs and LOAELs, and 
many studies comprise relatively few animals, which can decrease the statistical probability 
of finding effects at lower response levels (such as 1, 5, or 10%). Further, NOEALs and 
LOAELs may correspond to widely different response levels.53 BMDs, on the other hand, 
provide more robust low dose extrapolations with consistent response levels.1,31 Thus, using 
a BMD approach ensures we are correctly weighting phthalates because we are considering 
exposures for the same response level (in this case 5%).53 Furthermore, uncertainty factors 
used to obtain reference values in combination with NOAELs and LOAELs add an 
additional level of uncertainty as they are largely subjective.1 Therefore, forthcoming work 
on cumulative phthalates exposure and risk should use BMDs in weighted potency metrics, 
which is consistent with recommendations by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
for considering risks for noncancer health effects.31
The most significant limitation to our estimation of cumulative exposures is data availability. 
For one, we had urine flow rate data for 2009–2012 NHANES cycles only, which limited 
our statistical power. Also, the NAS recommended including other antiandrogens, such as 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).1 
However, comparable relative potency data for additional chemicals would be necessary to 
compute RPFs, and these chemicals were not measured in the same NHANES population 
with phthalate measurements. Moreover, NHANES does not currently measure metabolites 
of dipentyl phthalate, which may be more potent than DEHP and DnBP for androgen-
mediated end points.1 Nevertheless, our method provides a blueprint for how to weight

 phthalates in a cumulative sum using relative potencies recommended by the NAS. We 
additionally demonstrated how to include antiandrogenic compounds with more recent 
comparable relative potency data (i.e., DiNP) and addressed issues of uncertainty regarding 
chemicals without clear relative potency data (i.e., DEP). We also showed how issues of 
potential exposure misclassification may arise depending on which exposure metric and 
urine dilution adjustment method is used in regression modeling. Future studies should 
validate our method in risk assessment and epidemiologic models.
In conclusion, because humans are continuously exposed to multiple phthalates and other 
antiandrogenic compounds, we present an approach that can be used in future cumulative 
exposure analyses, risk assessments, and epidemiologic studies. Efforts should be made to 
evaluate the combined effects of phthalates and other antiandrogens since their co-
occurrence and potential for biological interaction means that risk assessment approaches 
that only focus on one chemical at a time will underestimate risk. Cumulative assessment 
should also be more fully integrated into examinations of environmental chemical exposures 
in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes, since multiple chemical exposures 
are more reflective of our modern environment. These approaches will contribute to more 
effective strategies to reduce exposures to potentially harmful chemicals and ultimately 
improve public health.
