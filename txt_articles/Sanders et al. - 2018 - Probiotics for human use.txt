Abstract
Probiotics have become a popular approach for managing digestive and immune
health and are being recommended more frequently as effective therapeutic
interventions by medical professionals. Introduced early in the 20th century, the
science of probiotics has advanced considerably, especially in the past two
decades. Researchers have adopted a consensus definition, begun to understand
many of the mechanisms of action, defined characteristics important to probiotic
function and have obtained clinical evidence supporting probiotic health benefits
and product quality. Nonetheless, a need remains for clear, evidence-based
communications to consumers on the role of probiotics in a healthy diet and to
healthcare providers regarding clinical use. However, regulatory frameworks in
many countries have restricted progress on this front. There is a need for
additional research to further clarify the most effective probiotics for given health
outcomes and to identify people most likely to respond to specific probiotic
interventions. This review provides current perspective on the probiotic concept,
discusses evidence-based probiotic interventions, considers fermented foods with
regard to probiotics and addresses some regulatory challenges facing the
probiotic field.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when admin-
istered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit
on the host (Hill et al. 2014). This definition was
issued by a consensus panel convened by the Interna-
tional Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebi-
otics
(ISAPP),
which
met
to
discuss
the
modern
relevance of the 2001 Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion/World Health Organization definition of probi-
otics (FAO & WHO 2001). In short, the panel
reaffirmed all of the major principles of the 2001
definition.
‘Probiotics’
comprise
many
different
types
of
microbes. It is important, therefore, to remember that
they are described by their genus, species and strain
designations. Using the example of one well-studied
probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG – Lactobacillus
is the genus, rhamnosus is the species and GG is the
strain designation. All three components are necessary
to identify a probiotic. The full name enables the
reader to link the specific strain to studies describing
health benefits and safety assessments. Further, health
benefits shown for one strain may not be established
for another strain, even of the same species, although
at times common mechanisms among different strains
may result in similar clinical outcomes.

REVIEW
DOI: 10.1111/nbu.12334
 The ISAPP consensus panel addressed this evolving
concept regarding the strain specificity of probiotic
effects: that several probiotic mechanisms responsible for
certain benefits may be commonly shared amongst most
strains of a larger taxonomic group (Sanders et al.
2018). For example, the production of organic acids,
such as lactate and acetate, is shared by most species of
both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. These microbial-
produced organic acids in the colon provide a range of
potential benefits to the intestinal tract and beyond. They
play an important role in creating a healthier gut environ-
ment by inhibiting undesirable microbes and by cross-
feeding other beneficial gut microbes, resulting in produc-
tion of butyrate, which fuels intestinal epithelial cells
(Topping & Clifton 2001). Thus, organic acids produced
commonly by many different probiotic strains and species
contribute to general gut health benefits (Ritchie &
Romanuk 2012). Identifying and establishing precise
mechanisms responsible for any given health benefit
remain active areas of research.
Despite the existence of shared, core mechanisms for
probiotic functions, not all probiotic strains are the
same. That is, while shared mechanisms exist, other
mechanisms are likely narrowly distributed among pro-
biotic species (Fig. 1). Furthermore, strain specificity of
probiotic benefits is the presumption unless mechanistic
and clinical evidence suggests otherwise.
In the global marketplace, probiotics are found pri-
marily
in
three
main
categories
–
foods,
dietary
supplements and pharmaceuticals. The regulatory cate-
gory of some newer products containing probiotics is
unclear. For example, probiotic cosmetics are now
being offered. Many regulatory frameworks strictly
control the level of live microbes in cosmetic products
for safety reasons; yet to be considered a ‘probiotic’
such products must deliver effective doses of live
microbes. Another question is if cosmetic benefits,
such as teeth whitening, can be considered a ‘health
benefit’, as stipulated by the probiotic definition. Prod-
ucts such as probiotic lozenges, throat sprays and
chewing gum do not fit neatly into a food or supple-
ment category. Further, humans are not the exclusive
target for probiotics, as probiotics for pet and animal
husbandry applications are available.
The quality of probiotic products, including reliability
and accuracy of product labelling, can vary consider-
ably amongst the product category and geographical
regions. Currently, there is no global harmonisation of
regulatory frameworks dictating manufacturing and
claim substantiation requirements for probiotics. Con-
sumers and manufacturers would greatly benefit from
efforts to verify product quality through a third party.
This is the goal, for example, of the US Pharmacopeia
(Rockville Maryland, US), which has assembled a
panel of probiotic experts to provide advice and
recommendations on quality issues including identifica-
tion, enumeration and standards for contaminating
microbes as applicable to probiotic dietary supplements.
Figure 1 Possible distribution of mechanisms among probiotics. Some mechanisms might be widespread among commonly studied probiotic genera, frequently
observed among most strains of a probiotic species, or rare and present in only a few strains of a given species. Evidence is accumulating on a cross-section
of probiotic strains that suggest some generalisations can be made beyond strain-specific effects. Abbreviation: SCFA, short-chain fatty acid. Reproduced with

Probiotic for human use
213
 The microbes most commonly used as probiotics
include species from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifi-
dobacterium
and
Saccharomyces.
Probiotics
from
other
genera
include
Bacillus,
Propionibacterium,
Streptococcus and Escherichia. There is active research
on identifying novel candidate probiotic species iso-
lated from different sites of healthy human subjects.
These ‘next generation’ probiotics are likely to be
developed as pharmaceutical products (O’Toole et al.
2017).
Robust clinical investigations into the health benefits
of probiotics have been underway since the 1990s and
many of these human trials have documented a diverse
array of benefits (see ‘Health benefits of probiotics:
Evidence for specific effects’ section). The probiotic
field has benefited from advances in human micro-
biome research, which have shown that the microbiota
colonising
healthy
humans
often
differ
from
the
microbiota of humans with certain diseases or health
conditions. Colonising microbes have been shown to
respond
to
diet,
including
diets
containing
live
microbes as part of fermented foods, and nutritional
status is affected by the function of the gut microbial
community (David et al. 2014). Probiotics are poised
as a valuable means of influencing the function of the
gut ecosystem to improve nutritional status and health
(Versalovic 2013).
Characteristics of probiotics
Although there are many characteristics of probiotic
microbes, it is useful to remember what the ISAPP
consensus probiotic definition stipulates: a probiotic
must be alive when administered, have a health ben-
efit and be delivered at an effective dose (Hill et al.
2014). According to the ISAPP consensus panel (Hill
et al. 2014), the definition implies that a probiotic
must be safe for the intended use and must be a
defined entity (not an undefined mixture) to allow
for
appropriate
identification
to
the
strain
level.
There is no requirement for probiotics to exhibit
properties in pre-clinical assessments such as coloni-
sation, ability to survive intestinal transit, adherence,
anti-pathogenic properties and ability to balance the
host microbiota. Further, the source of the probiotic
strain – human or otherwise – is not stipulated in
the definition. These attributes may be useful for
probiotics intended for particular applications but
there may be no need, for example, for a probiotic
used for oral health to be able to survive intestinal
transit. Further, although many probiotic researchers
both
historically
and
in
recent
years
utilised
a
battery of such tests to describe putative probiotics,
these tests have never been validated (Flach et al.
2017) and the outcomes of these tests have never
been linked to probiotic efficacy. Thus, making such
tests a ‘requirement’ for probiotic status is not scien-
tifically justified.
Probiotics may have far-reaching benefits. This is
possible due to the variety of probiotic activities that
may evoke a physiological benefit. But as mentioned
earlier, probiotics are not one substance, and as bio-
logical entities, they have the potential to act in
diverse ways. Mechanisms of action that researchers
have discovered in different probiotic strains include
modulation of immune system, interactions with gut
microbiota, production of organic acids, competitive
exclusion, improved barrier function, manufacture of
small molecules with systemic effects and production
of enzymes (O’Toole & Cooney 2008). Many gaps
in the existing knowledge of the mechanisms under-
pinning health benefits remain, however. Not all
mechanisms have been demonstrated in humans and,
more importantly, in many cases, conclusive evidence
that a given mechanism is related to a specific health
outcome in humans is lacking. Further, as biological
entities, probiotics are likely to express more than
one mechanism that may contribute to a given clini-
cal outcome, complicating research efforts to identify
mechanisms of probiotic function in humans.
One purported probiotic effect that has been diffi-
cult to establish in healthy humans is modification of
the composition of the gut microbiota. Although a
common view is that probiotics ‘promote a healthy
microbiota composition’, there is little evidence that
probiotics have a substantive impact on the overall
structure of gut microbial communities of healthy
subjects beyond the transient increase in the specific
strain being consumed (Kristensen et al. 2016) and
probiotic microbes rarely persist for more than a cou-
ple of weeks after consumption (Sanders 2011). A
systematic review of studies of the impact of probi-
otics on faecal microbiota found no effect on a range
of microbiota composition measures (alpha-diversity,
richness or evenness) (Kristensen et al. 2016). Despite
the transient nature of probiotics and the absence of
dramatic changes in the microbiota during probiotic
consumption, health benefits are substantiated by
clinical evidence (See ‘Health benefits of probiotics:
Evidence for specific effects’ section). These observa-
tions suggest that beneficial effects of probiotics arise
without the need for colonisation of the gastrointesti-
nal tract or a subsequent alteration of faecal micro-
biota composition.

 Fermented foods: Another source of
probiotics?
Fermented foods and beverages have a long and
important cultural and culinary history (Marco et al.
2017). Fermented milk, meat and plant-based foods
have been dietary staples for thousands of years
(Hutkins 2006). Several properties likely contributed
to the popularity of these products. Fermented foods
are well-preserved and would have provided a stable
food source when fresh foods were scarce. Fermented
foods and beverages also have unique sensory proper-
ties that would have appealed to consumers. Enhanced
functionality – for example, converting simple cereal
grains into bread or beer – would have also led to
widespread appreciation of fermented foods.
In the past century, and especially the past decade,
the nutritional benefits of fermented foods have been
recognised. These foods are usually made from nutri-
ent-dense starting materials such as milk, meat, grains
and legumes that are already good sources of protein,
vitamins and minerals. However, fermented foods may
possess benefits beyond these major nutrients. In par-
ticular,
emerging
evidence
suggests
that
the
live
microorganisms present in fermented foods contribute
to both gastrointestinal and systemic health (reviewed
in Marco et al. 2017).
In general, most fermented foods contain microor-
ganisms that were either (i) added as a culture to initi-
ate the fermentation or (ii) already present in the
starting material and enriched during fermentation.
Virtually all the cheeses and yogurts consumed in the
US are made by the former method (i.e. using specially
selected strains of lactic acid bacteria). In contrast, the
manufacture of other fermented foods – for example,
sauerkraut and kimchi – relies on indigenous or wild
microorganisms.
In addition, it is now a common practice to add
specific probiotic microorganisms to fermented foods.
Thus, many of the commercial yogurt and cultured
milk products now contain probiotic strains of Lacto-
bacillus and Bifidobacterium. In these applications, the
fermented food becomes the delivery vehicle for the
probiotic.
The distinction between probiotic microorganisms
and fermentation-associated microbes is important but
often confused. As noted above, probiotics refer to
those live microorganisms that confer a health benefit
on the host. To document a health benefit, human tri-
als must be conducted. Such clinical evidence is
obtained using a well-defined intervention, in this case,
microbial strains. However, the live microorganisms
that are responsible for spontaneous food fermenta-
tions are rarely suitably defined. Moreover, the specific
microorganisms in kimchi, sauerkraut, miso and other
spontaneous food fermentations will be different from
batch-to-batch as well as between manufacturer and
location. Thus, unless the relevant strains were iso-
lated from each fermentation, it would be virtually
impossible to assess their potential probiotic proper-
ties. Therefore, not all fermented foods are probiotic
foods, as undefined and unstudied products do not
meet the minimum criteria of a probiotic.
However, to the extent a probiotic is added to a fer-
mented food, or included in the production of a fer-
mented food, then that fermented food would also be
a probiotic food. Indeed, the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products 2010) has
approved a health claim for yogurt, having determined
that the yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus
and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) at the
species level can help improve digestion of lactose
among individuals with lactose maldigestion.
The beneficial health effects of yogurt and other fer-
mented foods are supported by several epidemiological
studies. For example, reduced risk of metabolic syn-
drome was associated with yogurt-rich diets in one
large cohort study of older adults (Babio et al. 2015).
Similarly, in another large cohort study, yogurt con-
sumption was associated with less long-term weight
gain (Mozaffarian et al. 2011). The results of the
Malm€
o diet and cancer cohort study showed that con-
sumption of fermented dairy products (mainly yogurt
and sour milk) was inversely associated with risk of
cardiovascular disease (Sonestedt et al. 2011). Cheese
consumption showed a similar effect, but only in
women. Two large cross-sectional analyses of adults
in Korea showed that high consumption (2–4 servings
per day) of kimchi and other fermented foods and
beverages was associated with reduced prevalence of
atopic dermatitis (Park & Bae 2016; Kim et al. 2017).
Consumption of miso, natto and fermented soy prod-
ucts was also inversely associated with reduced risk of
high blood pressure (Nozue et al. 2017). In contrast,
in another large cohort study, consumption of fer-
mented foods (mainly dairy) was not associated with
reduced mortality to all causes, cancer or cardiovascu-
lar disease (Praagman et al. 2015). The exception was
for cheese consumption, which, in this study, as also
observed previously (Sonestedt et al. 2011), was inver-
sely associated with cardiovascular disease mortality.
Although these epidemiological studies generally dis-
tinguish between the type of fermented foods con-
sumed

 unsaturated and saturated fat, fibre and other dietary
components may ultimately influence outcomes. Other
potential
confounders
include
exercise,
stress
and
lifestyle.
Fewer studies have directly assessed the role of
fermented foods on clinical health outcomes. Although
microbes
originating
from
fermented
foods
are
detected in faecal samples (Dal Bello et al. 2003;
David et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016a), these microor-
ganisms are transients and do not colonise or persist.
Still, even if fermentation-associated microbes are just
passing through, there is emerging evidence that they
can nonetheless influence the normal microbiota, com-
municate with the host immune system and exert
other positive effects (reviewed in Marco et al. 2017).
Outcomes of recent clinical trials include improve-
ments in blood pressure in hypertensive adults by
fermented milk (Beltran-Barrientos et al. 2018), reduc-
tion of infectious disease among children by fermented
rice or milk (Nocerino et al. 2017) and short-term
improvements in bone health markers in osteoporosis
patients by kefir (Tu et al. 2015).
In
addition
to
the
health
effects
of
ingested
microbes, there are other ways fermented foods can
contribute to improved health. First, microorganisms
can transform or change the chemical content of a
food during the fermentation and thereby alter the
nutritional properties. Examples would include the
utilisation of lactose during cheese manufacture and
the partial degradation of gluten during sourdough
fermentation. Similarly, in rye and other wholegrain
sourdoughs, low pH enhances the hydrolysis of the
anti-nutrient, phytic acid, by endogenous amylases,
and
increases
the
nutritional
value
of
the
bread
(Ganzle 2014). During the manufacture of red wine,
ethanol produced during the maceration step enhances
extraction of phenolic compounds known for their
biological activity (De Beer et al. 2002; Setford et al.
2017). Finally, fermentation microbes may increase
the vitamin content of foods, as occurs in cultured
dairy products and other fermented foods (LeBlanc
et al. 2011; Chamlagain et al. 2018).
Health benefits of probiotics: Evidence for
specific effects
This section focuses on clinically relevant endpoints
from human studies that are associated with probiotic
use. Evidence must be viewed as being applicable to
the specific probiotics and doses tested; not all strains
of probiotics will be functional for all the endpoints
listed. Table 1 summarises the range of benefits that
have
been
tested
in
randomised
controlled
trials
(RCT) for some probiotics. As with all intervention
substances, including drugs, supplements and foods,
there are null trials in probiotics. Null trials provide
important lessons to better understand the limitations
of
certain
probiotic
interventions
and
indications.
However, it is important to consider these results in
the context of the totality of evidence.
Many researchers have considered the totality of
evidence for probiotics on a given endpoint by con-
ducting a systematic review that includes studies on
different strains. However, not all probiotic strains
can be expected to be equally effective clinically. To
the extent that common mechanisms among different
strains drive the observed clinical benefits, it is scien-
tifically sound to consider evidence on similar but not
identical interventions (Glanville et al. 2015), as is
often done for drugs as can be seen in this meta-analy-
sis of all antibiotics for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) exacerbations (Lyon et al. 2018).
Infantile colic
Colic in an otherwise healthy child is defined as incon-
solable crying for more than 3 hours per day, more
than
3 days
per
week,
for
longer
than
3 weeks
(Johnson et al. 2015). This is a common condition
and is very difficult to treat. No traditional medical
intervention is effective for colic (Johnson et al. 2015).
Although colic occurs in up to 20% of infants, the
aetiology remains unclear (Sung et al. 2014). Diet and
intestinal microbiome likely play a role, with lower
counts of lactobacilli being reported in the intestinal
microbiota of colicky infants (Savino et al. 2004,
2005). These early studies motivated researchers to
study the effect of probiotics on colic. One microor-
ganism, L. reuteri 17938, is the most widely studied
strain as an intervention given to infants suffering
from colic. In an individual participant data meta-
analysis (Riley et al. 2010) (considered the highest
level of evidence), four double-blind trials involving
345 infants with colic (174 probiotic, 171 placebo)
receiving L. reuteri 17 938 or placebo were analysed.
L. reuteri 17 938 treatment statistically significantly
decreased daily crying time [�25.4 minutes (95% CI:
�47.3, �3.5)], and a 28% success rate in the probi-
otic group versus 9% in placebo group was demon-
strated. This translates into a number needed to treat
(NNT) of 4. Importantly, no adverse events were
attributed to L. reuteri 17938 treatment (Sung et al.
2018). This effect was only demonstrated in breastfed
infants.

 Eczema
Atopic eczema is an inflammatory skin condition char-
acterised by pruritus, redness and thick and scaly skin
(Berke et al. 2012). It is often associated with other
atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma; an
estimated 30% of children with atopic dermatitis
develop asthma later in life (Spergel 2010). A meta-
analysis of 29 studies found probiotics reduced the
risk of developing eczema in infants when consumed
by women during the last trimester of pregnancy [rela-
tive risk (RR) = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.60–0.84], when used
by breastfeeding mothers (RR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.47–
0.69) or when given to infants (RR = 0.80; 95% CI:
0.68–0.94) (Cuello-Garcia et al. 2015). These findings
resulted in the World Allergy Organization (WAO)
convening a guideline panel to develop evidence-based
recommendations about the use of probiotics in the
prevention of allergy (Fiocchi et al. 2015). The WAO
panel recommended: (1) using probiotics in pregnant
women at high risk for having an allergic child; (2)
using probiotics in women who breastfeed infants at
high risk of developing allergy; and (3) using probi-
otics in infants at high risk of developing allergy. Both
the WAO and the meta-analysis review acknowledge
that more studies need to be conducted because exist-
ing data, although promising and positive, constitute a
low evidence level due to a high risk of bias, inconsis-
tency and imprecision of results. However, when con-
sidering the potential benefit and negligible risk, the
limited data were sufficiently convincing for a recom-
mendation to be made.

 Western countries, with diet, genetics and environment
appearing to affect prevalence (Friedman & Blumberg
2014). Additionally, antibiotic treatment in the first
year of life appears to confer an almost three times
greater risk of developing IBD (Friedman & Blumberg
2014). Because of the apparent association of diet and
microbiome with IBD, there is considerable interest in
dietary interventions and/or probiotic supplementation
as a treatment. Interestingly, many of the same tradi-
tional medicines are used for both UC and Crohn’s
disease, but trials testing probiotics as a treatment for
Crohn’s disease have consistently failed, suggesting that
at least the probiotics tested to date are an ineffective
treatment for Crohn’s disease, as was observed in the
trial by Bourreille et al. (2013). There have been a few
positive
studies
with
different
products/strains
in
patients with UC, primarily with VSL#3 and E. coli
Nissle 1917 (Floch et al. 2015). A meta-analysis of 319
UC patients taking VSL#3 or matching placebo found
the remission rate in the VSL#3 patients was 44.6% vs.
25.1% in placebo, NNT = 4 (Cordina et al. 2011;
Mardini & Grigorian 2014). VSL#3 has now been
added to the formulary of some UK hospitals and is
prescribed by some gastroenterologists as an adjunctive
treatment for UC, although this is not standard practice
in the UK.
Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and
Clostridium difficile infection
Antibiotics are amongst the most commonly pre-
scribed drugs in UK hospitals. However, as well as
treating infection they can cause disruption to the gas-
trointestinal microbiota. This can lead to the relatively
common side effect of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea
(AAD), which often delays hospital discharge. More
concerning is that a disruption to the normal gut
microbiota can lead to reduced resistance to oppor-
tunistic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, lead-
ing to C. difficile infection (Schaffler & Breitruck
2018), a potentially severe or fatal infection causing
over 30 deaths a year in the UK (PHE 2018; ONS
2017). Several studies have shown that probiotics
taken with antibiotics reduce the incidence of C. diffi-
cile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) and AAD. Adminis-
tration of Saccharomyces boulardii, a probiotic yeast,
compared with placebo or no treatment, reduced the
overall risk of AAD in patients treated with antibiotics
from 18.7% to 8.5% (NNT = 10) (Szajewska &
Kolodziej
2015).
A
recent
meta-analysis
of
7957
patients (Lau & Chamberlain 2016) and the latest
Cochrane meta-analysis of 9955 patients (Goldenberg
et al. 2017) showed ~60% reduction of risk of devel-
oping CDAD when patients were co-prescribed probi-
otics with antibiotics, along with a decrease in the risk
of
developing
side
effects
related
to
antibiotics
(Goldenberg et al. 2017). There is still much to be
learnt about the optimum timing, duration, formula-
tion and dosing of probiotic supplementation for
reducing risk of CDAD. This is illustrated by the null
result from a large multi-centre, placebo-controlled
trial testing a probiotic to prevent C. difficile diar-
rhoea in older inpatients [the PLACIDE study (Allen
et al. 2013)]. This study may have failed to show a
benefit from probiotics due to the low incidence of
AAD and CDAD (10% actual compared to 20% pre-
dicted), the mismatch between period of probiotic
administration
(21 days)
and
diarrhoea
incidence
tracking
(8 weeks)
and
the
long
period
allowed
between antibiotic administration and commencement
of probiotic intervention (7 days). It is, however, reas-
suring that this study administered probiotics to nearly
1500 patients over 65 years of age had no adverse
effects attributable to the intervention (Allen et al.
2013). Several hospitals across the UK have imple-
mented co-prescribing of a probiotic with antibiotic
therapy, especially in at-risk populations, but this has
not yet become standard practice.
Necrotising enterocolitis
Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious neonatal
disease causing inflammation and necrosis of areas of
the bowel, primarily in premature infants and those
with a birthweight of <1500 g. It carries a significant
mortality
of
up
to
30%
(Gephart
et al.
2012).
Although the aetiology is incompletely understood, it
is thought to relate to aberrant intestinal mucosal
colonisation by bacteria. Research efforts have focused
on therapeutics designed to restore this balance to pre-
vent
NEC
or
minimise
the
severity
once
it
has
occurred (Denning et al. 2017; Eaton et al. 2017;
Frost et al. 2017). In 2014, a Cochrane review found
that the use of probiotics reduced the occurrence of
NEC (typical RR 0.35; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.52, NNT
25) and death (typical RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.60,
NNT 25) in premature infants with a birthweight of
<1500 g (AlFaleh & Anabrees 2014). The routine use
of probiotics in neonates has been incorporated into
clinical guidelines in multiple UK hospital trusts and is
recommended by the South West Neonatal Network
(Bartle et al. 2016). However, although several RCTs
have shown that probiotics can reduce neonatal mor-
bidity
and
mortality,
these
studies
used

 different probiotic strains, and no comparative trials
have been conducted to determine the most effective
probiotics. Indeed, the largest UK multi-centre RCT
studying 1315 premature infants showed no effect of
the probiotic B. breve BBG-001 on either the occur-
rence of NEC or associated mortality, although impor-
tantly there were no probiotic-related adverse effects
(Costeloe et al. 2016).
A recent network meta-analysis including data from
11 231 preterm infants identified that only three of 25
probiotic formulations were efficacious in reducing
mortality from NEC, whereas seven strains were effec-
tive in reducing incidence of NEC and there was no
clear overlap between these formulations (van den
Akker et al. 2018). These data highlight the impor-
tance of the choice of probiotic formulation and that
further high-quality studies are required for optimal
strain and dose selection. It is evident that selecting a
probiotic without consideration as to the optimal
dose, strain, combination and formulation can lead to
clinical inefficacy, and this is an important considera-
tion moving forwards. However, when the optimal
probiotic intervention is applied to the right patient
population, the results can be promising. A recent
large-scale clinical trial conducted in 4556 healthy
infants in rural India showed a significant reduction in
neonatal
sepsis
with
a
synbiotic
formulation
of
L. plantarum ATCC-202195 and fructooligosaccha-
ride (RR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.48–0.74, NNT = 27)
(Panigrahi et al. 2017). Neonatal sepsis remains a sig-
nificant cause of death, particularly in the developing
world, and with the increasing global concerns about
antibiotic resistance probiotics may offer an attractive
option
for
prevention
or
adjunctive
treatment
of
infection.
Do probiotics have any benefit for generally healthy
people?
Probiotic intervention studies have been conducted
on healthy or ‘at-risk’ subjects targeting diverse clin-
ical endpoints. Taken together, these studies suggest
that there may be some benefit in free-living, gener-
ally
healthy
people.
For
example,
studies
have
shown
that
probiotics
can
modestly
decrease
the
incidence (Hao et al. 2015) and duration (King et al.
2014) of common upper respiratory tract infections
in children. Some evidence exists for certain probi-
otics to help manage blood lipids in people with
mild hypercholesterolemia (Wang et al. 2018). Probi-
otics can improve lactose digestion in lactose intoler-
ant people, with most evidence showing that lactose
consumed in yogurt with live cultures is better toler-
ated than the same amount of lactose consumed
without live cultures (Oak & Jha 2018). A recent
systematic review evaluated the role of probiotics in
the management of lower gastrointestinal symptoms
(Hungin
et al.
2018).
Included
studies
covered
a
range of symptoms experienced by healthy subjects
or subjects with minor gastrointestinal symptoms.
Consensus statements were considered by a panel of
14 experts on behalf of the European Society for
Primary Care Gastroenterology. In short, the panel
agreed that specific probiotics should be tried or
considered for management of several symptoms of
IBS,
although
not
all
probiotics
showed
benefit.
Observed benefits for IBS may be of modest magni-
tude, strain-specific and depend on the host physiol-
ogy, diet and colonising microbiota.
Suggestions to help understand the
marketplace
The probiotic marketplace can be confusing for con-
sumers. Box 1 answers some frequently asked ques-
tions consumers commonly pose. The overriding need
is for consumers to be able to recognise products of
high quality that address their specific needs. Probiotic
quality encompasses safety, potency and correctness of
product labelling, including the accuracy of any health
benefit claims, to the extent claims are allowed.
The safety of any probiotic must be definitively
established for the intended use. Although probiotics
that are commonly marketed have an excellent safety
record (Sanders et al. 2010; Hempel et al. 2011),
additional concerns may exist for probiotics intended
for
vulnerable
patient
populations
(Sanders
et al.
2016). Good manufacturing practices for any product
category must be met, but since probiotics are live
microorganisms, special approaches may be needed
for verification that no undesirable microbes contami-
nate the product.
A probiotic product label (Fig. 2) should disclose
the genus, species and strain designation for all strains
in the product (FAO & WHO 2002). How microbes
are classified and named (the field of nomenclature)
can change based on the latest science, and consumers
are best served when manufacturers use accurate and
the most current names. Without this information, it
is impossible for experts, healthcare providers or con-
sumers to verify that scientific substantiation exists for
the product as formulated.
Product labels should also contain information on
the potency of the product. This is typically expressed

 as ‘colony forming units’ (CFU), a unit based on cul-
turing and counting the number of live microbes able
to form a colony on an agar plate. An emerging tech-
nique,
flow
cytometry,
improves
precision
and
throughput
of
probiotic
enumeration,
and
in
the
future active fluorescent units may replace CFU on
product labels (Chiron et al. 2018). The CFU per serv-
ing or dose of a probiotic should be that which can be
guaranteed through the end of shelf life and matches
the dose used in human studies demonstrating a health
benefit.
Perhaps the most contentious aspect of probiotic
product labelling is for health benefit claims. Different
region’s regulatory frameworks impose different stan-
dards of evidence to support claims. Further, some
regions require pre-approval of claims whereas others
do not. In the European Union (EU), all claims must
be approved by regulatory authorities and probiotic
claims submitted to date have not been approved. The
dossiers submitted in support of the claims have been
deemed to not establish a cause-and-effect relationship
between a probiotic product and the claimed health
effect. The applied standard in the EU is the ‘highest
possible standard’ of evidence and all studies must be
conducted on healthy subjects to be considered. In the
US, the situation is different.
Structure/function claims (claims that relate the sub-
stance to the normal structure or function of the
healthy
human
body)
do
not
require
approval,
whereas claims that relate the food to the reduction of
risk of disease must be approved (Sanders et al. 2011).
There are suggestions in a guidance document (which
are not legally binding) that that the US Food and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)

Box 1: Frequently asked questions about probiotics
See ISAPP for additional information in the form of infographics (https://isappscience.org/infographics/) or short
videos (https://isappscience.org/resources/isapp-videos/).
Q. Is a higher dose and greater number of strains better?
A. Not necessarily. The recommendation is to use products that have been tested in human studies with positive
outcomes for the benefit you are interested in. Sometimes the probiotic product shown to be effective might
have a lower dose or fewer strains than another product.
Q. Does the sugar in probiotic yogurts negate the benefits of probiotic yogurt?
A. Most studies testing the health benefits of yogurt have been conducted on sweetened yogurts. Therefore, the
sugar present in these products does not negate the probiotic effects. However, sweetened yogurts should be
consumed only in the context of a healthy, balanced diet.
Q. Are refrigerated products better than non-refrigerated?
A. The stability of the live microbes in a probiotic product depends on conditions of storage. Some products
may require refrigeration, but others do not. Responsible product manufacturers make certain that their probi-
otic is able to meet its label claim through the end of shelf-life if stored as recommended.
Q. Is it better to take probiotics as supplements or foods?
A. Human trials have shown benefits for both food and supplement forms of probiotics, and no comparative
trials have been conducted suggesting one format is better than the other. If multiple products of different for-
mats have been shown to be effective, then take the product that best fits with your diet and lifestyle.
Q. What is the difference between probiotics and prebiotics?
A. Probiotics are live microorganisms beneficial to your health. Prebiotics are not live microbes, but are sub-
stances that are used by your beneficial, colonising microorganisms. Simply put, prebiotics are food for your
beneficial, native bacteria. Most prebiotics are a type of fibre.
Q. The body already has so many bacteria, how can we expect the comparatively small number of live
microbes in a probiotic product to have any benefits?
A. Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes. But remember that we are not uniformly colonised, even
throughout the digestive tract. Orally consumed probiotics travel through some sparsely colonised regions of
the upper digestive tract, and may be dominant during this passage. Further, even as minor components of the
lower digestive tract, a probiotic’s metabolic activities can impact the gut environment. Some probiotics have
been shown to influence some clinical outcomes, and that’s what is important.

 claims for food should be restricted to taste, aroma
and nutritive value, which would greatly limit the
scope of functional claims for foods (US Food and
Drug Administration 2016). In practice, functional
claims on foods have not complied with this guidance.
In the US, there are no approved probiotic drugs, and
any product making an unapproved drug claim (that
the product can cure, treat, prevent or mitigate dis-
ease) will receive a cease-and-desist warning letter
from the FDA. Any manufacturer interested in making
such claims needs to go through the drug approval
process, and to date, none have.
As delineated in the ‘Health benefits of probiotics:
Evidence for specific benefits effects’ section, there is
compelling
evidence
that
probiotics
may
benefit
human health in several ways. Whereas scientific pub-
lications
including
systematic
reviews
and
meta-
analyses that consider the totality of the evidence will
communicate
these
benefits,
currently,
due
to
limitations of different regulatory frameworks, often
product labels and advertising cannot. Healthcare
providers interested in evidence-based probiotic usage
often do so using an ‘off-label use’ strategy. Con-
sumers interested in using probiotic products to allevi-
ate a particular health concern can find it difficult to
identify products that have been tested for such bene-
fits.
Some
guidelines
that
provide
evidence-based
recommendations for probiotic use include the World
Gastroenterology Organisation Practice Guideline –
Probiotics and Prebiotics (Guarner et al. 2017), Clini-
cal Guide to Probiotic Products Available in the US

nies,

and

Nutrition
(Braegger

Conclusions
The probiotic concept, first introduced in the early
1900s, has been updated by ISAPP to include current
evidence levels. Research suggests that probiotics can
be used in an evidence-based manner to address a
range of different health concerns. For the healthy con-
sumer, probiotics and fermented foods may provide a
dietary approach to support health and better function
of the gut microbiota. Many other potential health ben-
efits for probiotics (not discussed in this review) are
currently under investigation, including their role in
reducing the perception of stress, anxiety, depression
and other expressions of brain function (Sarkar et al.
2016). The possible roles of probiotics in reducing
diseases associated with faulty immune programming
leading to autoimmune disorders or correcting dysbio-
sis that might influence metabolic disorders are also
being studied. Research is needed to determine if cur-
rent or future, so-called next generation, probiotics can
help address these disorders. Although current probiotic
products are most commonly available in food and
supplement formats, it is likely that in the near future
these next generation probiotics will be available as
drugs targeted towards specific diseases (O’Toole et al.
2017). Regulatory challenges for communication of
findings from efficacy research remain. As the impact
of probiotic interventions on the gut microbiota are
further investigated, it may soon be possible to identify
likely responders to a specific probiotic, enabling more
successful utilisation in the future.
