Introduction
Growing
interest
in immunohistochemical
staining
procedures
has
led
to the
development
ofa
wide
range
ofhighly
specific
immuno-
stains
which
are
of value
to
the
surgical
pathologist
in
diagnostic
and
investigative
studies
(1,2).
Although
formalin
remains
the
most
popular
fixative
used
in
pathology,
it is clear
that
this
fixative
is
not
always
the
best
choice
for
preserving
antigenicity
of
tissues
to
be used
in immunohistochemical
procedures.
Despite
many
studies
on
the
intermolecular
cross-links
formed
between
formalin
and
pro-
teins
(3,4),
the
molecular
mechanism
underlying
tissue
fixation
is
not
well
understood
(5).
The
demand
for
a broader
selection
of
antibodies
that
can
be
used
for
immunohistochemical
staining
on
routine
formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded
tissues
has
stimulated
efforts
to
develop
anti-
bodies
that
can
recognize
formalin-resistant
epitopes.
Although
this
strategy
has
been
effective
in developing
many
useful
antibod-
ies,
it has
not
been
entirely
satisfactory
in
resolving
all
problems.
A persistent
concern
in immunopathology
is choosing
the
correct
tions
after
pre.treatment
ofthe
slides with
this method.
These
results
showed
that
after
antigen
retrieval:
(a) enzyme
pre-
digestion
of tissues
could
be omitted;
(b) incubation
times
ofprimary
antibodies
could
be significantly
reduced,
or di-
lutions
of primary
antibodies
could
be
increased;
(c) ade-
quate
staining
could
be achieved
inlong-term
formalin-fixed
tissues
that failed
to stain
by conventional
methods;
and
(d)
certain
antibodies
which
were
typically
unreactive
with
formalin-fixed
tissues
gave excellent
staining.

fixative
and
duration
of fixation
that
will
provide
maximal
preser-
vation
of
tissue
morphology
with
minimal
loss
of
antigenicity.
One
approach
to resolve
this
dilemma
was
the
introduction
of
protease
digestion
of formalin-fixed
sections
to unmask
antigenic
sites
hidden
by
cross-linked
proteins
(6,7).
However,
Leong
et
al.
(8) showed
that,
aside
from
cytokeratins
and
desmin,
digestion
with
trypsin
did
not
substantially
improve
immunostaining
ofthe
other
antigens
studied.
At
present
it
is not
clear
whether
or
not
the
formalin-induced
cross-linking
ofproteins
is a reversible
chemical
reaction.
However,
a recent
study
concerning
formalin
sensitivity
of a GFAP
epitope
supported
the
hypothesis
that
the
sensitivity
of some
epitopes
was
not
due
to
the
direct
effect
of
the
aldehyde
but
rather
was
due
to
the
binding
of
other
molecular
structures
to
the
epitope
(9).
Clearly,
the
capability
ofretrieval
ofmasked
epitopes
could
sig-
nificantly
expand
the
range
of
antibodies
useful
in
immuno-
histochemistry
as well
as reduce
the
incidence
offalse-negative
stain-
ing
in over-fixed
tissues.
In addition,
antigen
retrieval
could
provide
greater
diagnostic
accuracy
by
improving
immunohistochemical
procedures.
With
these
goals
in
mind,
we
studied
the
effects
of
microwave
oven
heating
of tissue
sections
in the
presence
of metal
solutions.
We found
a dramatic
enhancing
effect
of this
treatment
on
the
recovery
of many
antigens,
which
is particularly
intriguing

Materials
and
Methods
Tissues
and Paraffin
Blocks.
Fresh tissues
were obtained
from
the
Cooper-
ative
Human
Tissue
Network
(CHTN;
Columbus,
OH),
and
were
fixed
immediately
in either
10%
neutral
buffered
formalin
or 90%
ethanol.
Fixed
tissues
were
dehydrated
in ethanol,
cleared
in xylene,
and
embedded
in
paraffin
blocks.
Some
tissues
which
had
been
fixed
in formalin
from
24
hr
to up
to
2 years
were
obtained
from
the
Department
of
Pathology,
Na-
tional
Medical
Center
ofthe
City ofHope
(Duarte,
CA)and
Hartford
Hos-
pital
(Hartford,
CT).
Five-�tm
sections
were
cut
and
mounted
on
poly-L-
lysine
(Sigma;
St
Louis,
MO)-coated
slides.
The
use
of
a tissue
adhesive
was
important,
as without
an

tissues
tended
to

from
the
slides
during
the
antigen

process.
Microwave
Oven.
A Toshiba
model
ER-855BT
operating
at a frequency
of
2.45
GHz
with
nine
power
level
settings
was used
at the
highest
power
setting
(720
w).
Three
Coplin
jars
were
filled
with
either
dc-ionized
water,
1%
zinc
sulfate,
or saturated
lead
thiocyanate,
and
placed
in
the
center
of the
microwave
oven.
Because
the
number
of Coplin
jars
placed
in the
microwave
oven
might
influence
the
temperature,
three
jars
were
always
used,
and
they
were
always
placed
in the
same
positions.
When
heated
at
the
indicated
settings,
the
boiling
point
(100
±
5’C)
for
these
aqueous
solutions
was
reached
in
140-145

Protocol
for
Antigen
Retrieval.
Although
different
antigens
may
be-
have
differently
under
similar
conditions
of treatment,
the
following
pro-
tocol
was
found
to
be
acceptable
for
most
antigens
tested
in
this
study.
The
steps
for
antigen
retrieval
were
as follows.
1.
Tissue
sections
were
deparaffinized
and
rehydrated
to
water.
2.
Endogenous
peroxidase
was
blocked
with
3%
H202
for
5 mm.
3.
Slides
were
washed
with
distilled
water
for
5 mm.
4.
Slides
were
then
placed
in
plastic
Coplin
jars
containing
either
dis-
tilled
water,
a metal
solution
of saturated
lead
thiocyanate,
or
1%
zinc
sulfate.
5 .
Jars
were covered
with
loose-fining
screw
caps and
heated
in the
micro-
wave
oven
for either
5 or
10 mm.
Sometimes
a 10-mm
heating
time
was divided
into
two
5-mm
cycles
with
an interval
of
1 mm
between
cycles
to check
on
the
fluid
level
in the
jars.
6.
After
heating,
the
Coplin
jars
were
removed
from
the
oven
and
al-
lowed
to
cool
for
15 mm.
7.
Slides
were
then
rinsed
in distilled
water
twice
and
in PBS
for
5 mm.
8.
Treated
slides
were
immunostained
as described
below.
For comparison,
a conventional
oven
was also
used
to heat
the
slides.
The
solutions
were
heated
to
the
specified
temperature.
The
slides
were
placed
in the
pre-heated
solutions
for
5-10
mm
and
then
treated
as previ-
ously
described
for
the
microwave
procedure.
lmmunohistochemixtry.
All polyclonal
and
monoclonal
antibodies
listed
in
‘l�ble
1 were
obtained
from
BioGenex
Laboratories
(San
Ramon,
CA).
Unless
otherwise
specified,
the detection
system
for the immunohistochem-
ical staining
was the
Super
Sensitive
system,
also from
BioGenex.
In some
studies
a MukiLink
detection
system
(BioGenex)
was also evaluated.
Both
horseradish
peroxidase
with
AEC
chromogen
and
alkaline
phosphatase
with
Fast
Red
chromogen
were
used.
Immunohistochemical
staining
was performed
according
to the manufac-
turer’s
instructions.
Briefly,
all
incubations
were
performed
at
room
tern-
perature
as
follows:
(a)
primary
antibodies
were
incubated
from
30
mm
to
24
hr
according
to the
manufacturer’s
instructions;
(b)
link
antibody
was incubated
for 20 mm; (c) streptavidin-conjugated
enzyme
was incubated
for
20 mm;
(d)
peroxidase
substrate
was incubated
for
5 mm,
or alkaline
phosphatase
substrate
was
incubated
for
20
mm.
After
irnmunostaining,
slides
were
counterstained
with
hernatoxylin
and
coverslipped
with
an aque-
ous
mounting
medium.
Non-immune
rabbit
serum
or
nonspecific
mouse
ascites
was
used
as
negative
control
for rabbit
and
mouse
primary
antibodies,
respectively.
Con-
tribution
of nonspecific
staining
of primary
antibody
was evaluated
by sub-
stitution
of
the
primary
antibody
with
the
negative
controls
or
with
PBS.
Enzyme
Digestion.
In some
cases,
deparaffinized
tissues
were
pre-treated
by
protease
digestion
before
application
of
the
primary
antibody.
Tissue
sections
were
incubated
with
0.1%
trypsin
(Sigma)
in
PBS
for
30 mm
at
37’C.
After
enzyme
digestion,
slides
were rinsed
in PBS and
irnmunostained
as previously
described.

results
using
52 different
primary
antibodies
on
tissues
treated
for
antigen
retrieval
are
summarized
in l#{224}ble
1. Most
of
the
antibodies
tested
showed
increased
intensity
of
immuno-
staining
after
microwave
oven
heating
in the
presence
of either
dis-
tilled
water
or metal
solutions.
In
general,
the
intensity
of immu-
nostaining
was
stronger
with
the metal
solutions,
particularly
using
the
lead
solution
(Figure
i).
In some
cases,
such
as with
monoclo-
nal
antibody
to IgD,
the
use
of zinc
sulfate
solution
caused
strong
background
staining
of
tonsil
epithelium
and
some
false-positive
staining
of lymphocyte
nuclei.
This
type
of false-positive
staining
was
not
observed
with
the
lead
solution
(Figure
2).
Best
results
were
obtained
when
slides
were
heated
in the
micro-
wave
oven
using
the
intermittent
heating
method
of
two
5-mm
cycles
with
an
interval
of
1 mm
between
the
heating
cycles.
An-
other
advantage
of this
method
was
that
additional
solution
could
be
added
to
the
jars
if necessary.
Immunohistochemical
Staining
Using
Conventional
Heat
Heating
slides
in distilled
water
or metal
solutions
by conventional
heat
in
an
oven
also
resulted
in some
increased
immunostaining;
however,
there
were
noticeable
differences
compared
with
micro-
wave
heating
(Table
2).
For
tissues
fixed
in
formalin
for
24
hr
or
longer,
heating
the
slides
by microwave
oven
was
clearly
superior
to
heating
the
slides
with
conventional
heat.
Similarly,
the
use
of
lead
solution
led
to
better
results
than
zinc
solution,
which
in turn
was
better
than
wa-
ter
(Figure
2).
Sensitivity
of
the
Antigen
Retrieval
Method
To demonstrate
the
increased
sensitivity
achievable
with
this
method,
selected
antibodies
were
tested
at titers
that
failed
to produce
posi-
tive

when
tested
by
a conventional
immunostaining

dure.
Furthermore,
immunoreactivity
could
not
be
demonstrated
with
these
antibodies,
even
with
the
use
of trypsin
pre-digestion
of
tissues.
When
these
antibodies
were
then
tested
on
the
same
tissues
after
antigen
retrieval,
strong
immunostaining
was
observed
(Figures
1, 2,
and
3;
Table
3).
Specificity
oftbe
Antigen
Retrieval
Method
The
specificity
of the
antigen
retrieval
method
was
tested
by im-
munostaining
tissues
known
either
to contain
or to lack certain
an-
tigens.
For
these
studies,
tissues
were
immunostained
with
mono-
clonal
antibodies
to cytokeratin
7 or estrogen
receptor-related
protein
p29.
Both
of
these
antibodies
detected
formalin-sensitive
but
ethanol-resistant
epitopes.
Tissues
were
first
categorized
as being
antigen
positive
or antigen
negative
by immunostaining
frozen
5cc-
tions
of each
tissue
fixed
in
ethanol.
The
remainder
of the
tissues
were
then
fixed
in
formalin
and
embedded
in
paraffin.
When
paraffin.embedded
tissues
known
to contain
antigen
were
tested
with
antibody
to cytokeratin
7,
no
staining
occurred
in any formalin-
fixed
tissue
regardless
of the
length
offixation
time.
Similarly,
with
antibody
to
p29
no
staining
occurred
in
antigen-positive
tissues
that
had
been
fixed
in formalin
for 48 hr orlonger.
Although
neither
antibody
detected
antigen
in formalin-fixed
tissues
before
antigen
retrieval,
after
retrieval
both
gave
strong
staining
of their
respective
antigens
(Figure
4).
Furthermore,
when
formalin-fixed,
paraffin-
embedded
tissues
that
were
negative
for
these
antigens
were
im-
munostained
for cytokeratin
7 or p29,
no
staining
occurred
either
with
or
without
antigen
retrieval.
Antigen
Retrieval
in
Long-term
Formalin-fixed
Tissues
Thirty-nine
different
tissues
which
had
been
fixed
in formalin
for
periods
of time
ranging
from
2-4
weeks
and
one
tissue
which
had
been
stored
in formalin
for
2 years
were
tested
for
immunoreac-
tivity
to vimentin
and
pan-cytokeratin
(Figure
3).
As shown
in Ta-
ble 4, without
treatment
only
a minority
of the
tissues
were
stained,
and
the
staining
that
did
occur
was usually
weak.
However,
after
antigen
retrieval
with
lead
solution,
immunoreactivity
for these
two
antibodies
was
significantly
enhanced,
suggesting
that
retrieval
of
antigen
in
long-term
formalin-fixed
tissues
was
possible.

pieces
and
each
piece
was
fixed
in formalin
for
22 hr at a tempera-
ture
of4C,
2YC,
or 37#{176}C.
Because
the
process
offormalin
fixa-
tion
is temperature
dependent,
higher
temperatures
produce
more
rapid
fixation
(5).
After
paraffin
embedding
these
tissues
were
sub-
jected
to immunostaining
for
vimentin.
Because
the
epitope
rec-
ognized
by this
vimentin
antibody
(clone
V9) is partially
formalin
sensitive
(10),
this
system
was
used
to
investigate
whether
antigen
retrieval
could
be used
to reverse
the
deleterious
effects
of fixation
in formalin.
As
shown
in Table
5 and
Figure
3,
the
observed
de-
crease
in vimentin
immunoreactivity
was directly
related
to an in-
crease
in temperature
of the
formalin
fixative.
However,
after
antigen
retrieval
in the
presence
of lead
solution,
vimentin
immunostain-
ing
was
completely
restored
to a level
even
surpassing
that
observed
in tumor
fixed
at 4C
without
subsequent
treatment
(Thble
5). These
results
suggest
that,
at least
for some
epitopes,
the
deleterious
ef-
fects
of formalin
fixation
are
reversible.
Controls
For
most
antibodies
diluted
to
their
optimal
titer,
the
signal-to-
noise
ratio
was
usually
much
better
with
tissues
treated
for
antigen
retrieval
compared
with
untreated
tissues,
as the
background
was
usually
lower
after
antigen
retrieval.
However,

and

tion

Alcohol
Fixation
When
antigen
retrieval
was performed
on sections
of tissues
fixed
by alcohol
there
was
no
enhancement
of immunoreactivity,
whereas
all sections
fixed
in
10%
formalin,
irrespective
ofthe
length
of fix-
ation
time,
showed
increased
immunoreactivity.
Discussion
The
microwave
oven
has been
used
for tissue
fixation
(8,11,12)
and
for
rapid
histochemical
and
immunohistochemical
staining
(13-20).
One
recent
report
has
also
observed
enhanced
immunohistochem-
ical
staining
after
microwave
drying
ofslides
(21).
However,
in these
cases
only
short
periods
of irradiation
and
low temperatures
were
used.
To the
best
of our
knowledge
there
have
been
no
published
reports
concerning
antigen
retrieval
by the
use
of the
microwave
oven
and
metal
solutions.
Similarly,
no studies
have
indicated
that
the
immunohistochemical
staining
intensity
could
be
increased
by
heating
slides
to
high
temperatures.
From
this
point
of view,
the
excellent
immunostaining
results
demonstrated
in this
study
could
not
have
been
predicted
on
the
basis
of
current
knowledge.
Although
the
mechanism
concerning
microwave
oven
recovery
of antigens
is not
clear,
since
this
treatment
did
not
affect
alcohol-
fixed
paraffin
sections
it
is possible
that
the
cross-linking
of pro-
teins
caused
by formaldehyde
may
be altered
by microwave
heating.
The
use
of heavy
metal
salts
in combination
with
formalin
for
tissue
fixation
has
recently
been
introduced
(22,23).
Some
studies
have
demonstrated
the
superiority
of
zinc-formalin
as a fixative
for antigen
preservation
(23).
Furthermore,
when
routine
formalin-
fixed
tissues
were
re-fixed
in zinc-formalin,
immunoreactivity
was
improved
(24).
The
metal
solutions
used
in the
present
study
were
formulated
based
on
the
hypothesis
that
heavy
metal
salts
act
as
protein
precipitants,
forming
insoluble
complexes
with
polypep-
tides
(22),
and
that
protein-precipitating
fixatives
frequently
dis-
play
better
preservation
ofantigens
than
do
cross-linking
aldehyde
fixatives
(23).
In the
present
study
we found
that
the
use
of metal
solutions
in
combination
with
microwave
oven
heating,
and
to
a lesser
ex-

tent
conventional
heating,
could
substantially
improve
the
im-
munoreactivity
above
that
achievable
with
no
treatment
or
with
treatment
consisting
of
distilled
water
and
heat.
This
was particu-
larly
evident
in
tissues
that
had
been
fixed
in formalin
for
greater
than
24
hr.
Our
preliminary
study
has
demonstrated
that
lead
so-
lution
is better
than
zinc
solution
during
microwave
oven
treat-
ment,
since
the
lead
solution
demonstrated
stronger
immunoreac-
tivity
with
less
background.
When
compared
with
protease
digestion,
the influence
of micro-
wave
pre-treatment
was
clearly
superior,
particularly
with
antigens,
such
as vimentin,
which
are
typically
not
enhanced
by proteolysis.
Battifora
and
Kopinski
(7)
have
reported
that
the
optimal
length
of
time
for
proteolytic
digestion
increased
in
direct
proportion
to
the
length
of time
that
tissues
were
fixed
in formalin.
In the
pres-
ent
study
we found
that
tissues
fixed
in formalin
for
periods
rang-
ing
from
2 weeks
up
to
2 years
could
still
be
immunostained
for
pan-cytokeratin
and
vimentin
after
antigen
retrieval,
even
though
enzyme
pre-digestion
failed
to
restore
immunoreactivity.
These
results
suggest
that
other
tissues
that
were
previously
considered
unsuitable
for
immunohistochemical
analysis
can
potentially
be
salvaged
and
successfully
evaluated
with
a broad
range
of antibodies.
Although
the
methods
described
in
this
report
are
relatively
simple
and
straightforward,
a few
precautions
should
be
noted.
First,
our
data
suggest
that
background
staining
may
be increased
by this
method
in certain
tissues
already
prone
to high
backgrounds.
Therefore,
it is important
when
evaluating
this
method
to care-
fully
compare
positive
staining
to an
appropriate
negative
control.
Second,
the
use
ofcertain
metal
salts,
such
as lead,
poses
a poten-
tial
health
risk
which
should
be
minimized
by appropriate
mea-
sures.
In our laboratory
we utilize
the microwave
oven
within
a them-
ical
fume
hood
to reduce
environmental
exposure
to lead
aerosols.
Immunohistochemical
staining
methods
represent
a relatively
new
diagnostic
tool
which
can
contribute
to our
understanding
of
human
pathology.
The
continued
refinement
ofthese
tools
has
sig-
nificantly
expanded
the
capabilities
of the
surgical
pathologist
in
diagnostic
procedures.
Despite
these
important
advances,
there
is
no standard
method
of fixation
that
can
be applied
to tissues
sub-
mitted
for
immunohistochemical
analysis.
Indeed,
in
most
cases
the
requirements
for
tissue
fixation
are
dictated
by other
consider-
ations,
not
the
least
ofwhich
is personal
preference.
Although
stan-
dardization
ofimmunohistochemical
methods
has been
frequently
advocated
(25),
it is unlikely
that
such
standardization
will
gain
widespread
acceptance,
at
least
in
the
near
future.
Furthermore,
even
if standardization
of fixation
were
achieved,
the
need
to ap-
ply
immunohistochemistry
to archival
material
would
still
persist.
Consequently,
new
techniques
that
can
compensate
for
certain
defi-
ciencies
relating
to tissue
processing
are needed.
Iftechniques
such
as antigen
retrieval
could
be used
to visualize
antigens
that
were
otherwise
undetectable,
the
range
of
useful
immunohistochemi-
cal
methods
would
be
greatly
expanded.
Furthermore,
a simpli-
lied
method
for
antigen
retrieval
could
reduce
the
incidence
of false-
negative
immunostaining
results.
In clinical
applications
this
may
translate
into
increased
diagnostic
accuracy
and
improved
patient
care.
