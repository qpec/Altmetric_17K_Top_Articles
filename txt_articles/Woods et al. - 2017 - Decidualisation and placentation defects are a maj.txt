Mammalian reproductive performance declines rapidly with advanced maternal age. This
effect is largely attributed to the exponential increase in chromosome segregation errors in
the oocyte with age. Yet many pregnancy complications and birth defects that become more
frequent in older mothers, in both humans and mice, occur in the absence of karyotypic
abnormalities. Here, we report that abnormal embryonic development in aged female mice
is associated with severe placentation defects, which result from major deficits in the
decidualisation response of the uterine stroma. This problem is rooted in a blunted hormonal
responsiveness of the ageing uterus. Importantly, a young uterine environment can restore
normal placental as well as embryonic development. Our data highlight the pivotal, albeit
under-appreciated, impact of maternal age on uterine adaptability to pregnancy as major
contributor to the decline in reproductive success in older females.

aternal age is the single most important risk factor for
reproductive success. The significance of this problem
across
the
developed
world
is
immense
and
continuously rising. Maternal age has increased steadily over the
past decades; the average age of mothers surpassed 30 years
for the first time in 2013 in the UK (source: ONS), with 20% of
babies born to women ≥35 years of age. Very similar trends are
observed in North America and elsewhere1, 2. The underlying
cause of the increased risk to pregnancy outcome with age
is commonly attributed to the exponential rise in chromosome
mis-segregations in the oocyte, leading to karyotypic imbalances
and aneuploidies in the offspring. Many of these karyotypic
abnormalities result in spontaneous abortion in the first trimester
and thus contribute to the high frequency of pregnancy loss
during this time window. However, advanced maternal age also
poses an increased risk of serious pregnancy complications that
manifest in later pregnancy. These include miscarriage, late fetal
and perinatal death, stillbirth, preterm and extreme preterm birth,
low birth weight, placenta praevia and pre-eclampsia3–10. For
example, the stillbirth rate doubles by the late 30 s and increases
3–4 fold by the mid-40s6. Rates of preterm birth are ~20% higher
in women aged 35 years and over (source: Tommy’s; CIHI). Even
beyond the gestational period, maternal age is a significant risk
factor for various birth defects, in particular for congenital heart
disease, and also for abnormalities including diaphragmic hernia,
hypospadias and skull deformations11–13.
Importantly, most of these later complications occur in the
absence of any chromosomal abnormality in the newborn, and as
such their causative relationship to maternal age has remained
largely unexplained. It is of note, however, that the majority of
pregnancy complications associated with advanced maternal age,
namely fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, pre-eclampsia
and stillbirth, often share an underlying pathogenesis that is
rooted in a failure of correct placentation14. Apart from the
essential role of the placenta in supporting fetal growth, placental
development is also tightly linked to the formation of particular
organ systems, most notably the heart. This connection has been
shown in a number of mouse models in which heart defects
could be rescued solely by supplying the mutant embryo with a
wild-type placenta15. Intriguingly, a recent study reported that the
maternal age-associated risk of congenital heart disease resides
with the mother and not the oocyte13. Thus, the incidence of
ventricular septal defects is significantly greater in old mothers
but reduced to normal levels when oocytes from old mothers are
allowed to develop in a ‘young’ environment.
Based on these multi-faceted correlations, we speculated
that
defects
in
placental
development
may
constitute
a
major contributor to the maternal age-associated increase in
pregnancy
complications,
in
particular
those
unrelated
to
karyotypic imbalances. To better understand the causes of
maternal age-linked pregnancy complications and embryonic
defects, we have used the mouse as a model to distinguish fetal
(i.e.
oocyte-derived)
from
maternal
(uterine
environment,
systemic) effects on embryo development. Our data show that
pregnancy in old female mice is associated with a dramatic
increase in developmental variability, manifesting in a high
frequency of developmental delays, growth retardations and
serious embryonic abnormalities including cardiac, vascular and
neural defects. Moreover, abnormal embryos are associated with
severely mis-developed placentas. However, development of both
embryo and placenta largely returns to normal when embryos
from old mothers are transferred to young recipients. We
pinpoint
the
causes
of
these
oocyte-unrelated
maternal
age-associated problems to defects in the progression of decid-
ualisation, which in turn interferes with the establishment of a
functional feto-maternal exchange unit.

Embryo and placenta defects in offspring to old females.
C57BL/6 (B6) females of about 12 months of age are nearing the
end of their reproductive lifespan but can still become pregnant16.
However, it has been noted before that embryos developing
in older (43–47 weeks old) C57BL/6 (B6) females are more
prone to developmental abnormalities than those developing in
young (6–12 week old) mothers, while the number of maturing
oocytes is unaffected17, 18. Here, we systematically followed up
on this finding by assessing a total of 40 pregnancies in B6
females ranging from 41 to 58 weeks of age. We focussed this
analysis on day 11.5 (E11.5) of pregnancy, a stage in development
just after mid-gestation when the consequences of failures
in correct placentation become most obvious19. In line with
previous reports, average litter size was globally similar between
young and old females, albeit more variable in the aged
group (Supplementary Fig. 1a). However, examination of gross
morphological appearance revealed a dramatic increase in
developmental variability in litters of old females compared to
those of young mothers. While some embryos in litters of
aged females appeared normal as far as size and developmental
stage-specific hallmarks such as pigmentation of the eye were
concerned, on average at least two-thirds of embryos in each litter
exhibited varying degrees of developmental abnormalities (Fig. 1a
and Supplementary Fig. 1b). By far the most common defect was
fetal growth retardation, ranging from mild to very severe even
within the same litter. Other frequent abnormalities encompassed
cardiac edema, brain and neural tube closure defects, vascular
defects such as a dilated dorsal aorta and/or major brain artery, as
well as a significant increase in the number of resorption sites
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Importantly,
none
of
the
litters
of
young
females
displayed
such
a
prevalence
of
developmental
defects.
Equally, this effect was never observed in litters from young
females mated with 52-week-old males (Supplementary Fig. 1b),
demonstrating that the cause of the dramatic increase in
developmental abnormalities resides solely within the aged
mother.
Intriguingly, all these various problems in embryonic develop-
ment are known to be associated with placentation defects.
Therefore, we systematically analysed the placentas of aged
females, alongside those of young controls, on the histological
level by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, by in situ
hybridisation against the trophoblast giant cell marker Proliferin
(Prl2c2) and by expression analysis of well-established markers of
the trophoblast lineage. For the latter, we grouped the placentas of
litters from aged females into those associated with grossly
normal embryos (“An”; n = 6) and those associated with overtly
abnormal embryos (“Aa”; n = 6), and compared them to
placentas from young female control litters (“Y”; n = 3). Overall,
this analysis revealed profound defects in the placentas associated
with abnormal embryos. Most frequently, the fetal trophoblast-
derived portion of the placenta was drastically reduced in size
(Fig. 1b). In milder cases, abnormalities in the extent and
positional development of the placental labyrinth were obvious,
i.e. the portion of the placenta where all nutrient and gas
exchange takes place (Fig. 1b). Integrated histological and
molecular data indicated a failure of appropriate differentiation
of stem-like trophoblast progenitor cells, an overabundance of
trophoblast giant cells at the expense of diploid (Tpbpa+)
precursor cells and a failure in development of the labyrinth
layer, thus corroborating the morphological observations (Fig. 1c,
d and Supplementary Fig. 1c). It is well established that
such placental defects can cause embryonic phenotypes much
like those observed in the litters of aged females15, 20. These
findings were further validated by global transcriptomic analysis

e-karyotyping analysis on the RNA-seq data using a piecewise
constant fit algorithm which confirmed the absence of any gross
chromosomal imbalances21. Interestingly, some of the differences
in gene expression profiles were also observed in the “An” group,
albeit to a much lesser degree, positioning the “An” samples at an
intermediate stage in between the “Y” and “Aa” groups. This
finding indicates that even placentas which appear grossly normal
histologically, exhibit molecular changes that are likely predis-
posing the corresponding conceptus to developmental failures
later on during pregnancy.

 Development in young females rescues most defects. Our
observation of a direct correlation between abnormal embryos
and placentas led us to hypothesise that the frequent develop-
mental problems in aged females may originate in a failure to
establish a functional placenta. Yet our global sequencing data,
the relatively late time window of developmental failure and the
recurring phenotypes indicated that these were highly unlikely to
originate from karyotypic abnormalities in the oocyte. We thus
considered the possibility that the cause for the perturbations
in placental development may reside in the maternal aspects
contributing to the placenta, notably the decidua.
To address this possibility, we collected preimplantation
embryos at E2.5 from aged females and transferred them into
pseudopregnant 8–10-week-old ‘young’ foster mothers (“A-> Y”).
Transfers of embryos recovered from young females into young
foster mothers (“Y- > Y”) were performed in parallel to account
for technical variability. Intriguingly, providing the embryos from
aged females with a young host environment in this way almost
completely mitigated the developmental problems (Fig. 2a, b).
The overall proportion of grossly normal embryos increased from
42% in aged females to 73% upon embryo transfer, which was
only slightly below the 83% of the control Y-> Y transfers
(Fig. 2b). Most strikingly, the vast majority of embryos in each
litter was of similar size and developmental stage (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Fig. 2a), much in contrast to the enormous
developmental variability within litters of aged females. Using
crown-rump length as a proxy for developmental progression and
variability, embryos from aged females allowed to develop in
young foster mothers were in fact indistinguishable from young
control transfer embryos (Fig. 2c).
Together with the return to a mostly normal development of
the embryos proper, placental development was also rescued.
Thus, histologically, placentas of A-> Y transfers were highly
similar to those of Y-> Y transfers and indeed to young controls
(Fig. 2d). The lack of obvious trophoblast differentiation defects
was further confirmed on the level of marker gene expression
(Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Taken together, our data demonstrated that the frequent
developmental defects inherent to litters of older mothers were
rescued by the environment of a young foster mother. Thus, the
majority of these pregnancy complications was not due to defects
in the “old” oocyte, but due to an unfavourable maternal
environment that hampered normal developmental progression.
Age-associated defects in decidualisation as major problem.
The mammalian placenta constitutes the interface where fetal and
maternal cell types meet and functionally interact to ensure
normal development. The maternal component of the placenta is
made up of cells of the uterine endometrium that undergo a
tightly
controlled
process
of
decidualisation
upon
contact
with the early embryo. Decidualisation involves proliferation and
differentiation of the endometrial stroma into large epithelioid
decidual cells, a process critical to the establishment of fetal-
maternal communication and the progression of implantation.
The decidualisation process has both a protective function to
limit trophoblast invasion and a supportive role in placentation
by producing growth factors and cytokines that help remodel the
implantation site and the maternal vascular bed to promote
embryo growth22. This process is aided by a unique leucocyte
composition that forms a major fraction of the decidual
compartment.
Given that we found the majority of developmental problems in
aged females to be of maternal origin, we focussed on assessing the
decidual portions of placentas of the E11.5 conceptuses developed
in young and aged females. To this end, we chose deciduas
associated with three male and three female young control
conceptuses, as well as a total of 10 deciduas of conceptuses
developed in females aged 43–47 weeks, for global transcriptome
analyses by RNA-seq. Interestingly, we found a cohort of 162
genes that were consistently and robustly deregulated between the
young and aged groups, out of which 78 were more highly
expressed and 84 down-regulated in aged females (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Data 1). These genes included key regulators of
decidual differentiation, such as Bmp223, 24, Gdf1025, prostaglan-
din D and E receptors (Ptgdr, Ptger3), as well as Igf1 as one of the
main growth factors involved in oestrogen-induced uterine
growth26, 27. Intriguingly, using the list of differentially regulated
genes for gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis revealed a
significant enrichment of genes regulated by Bmp2, as well as of
growth factor-regulated pathways (“signal”, “disulphide bond”)
and of extracellular matrix composition (Supplementary Fig. 3a
and Supplementary Data 2). Moreover, it was apparent that the
extent of deregulation of this set of genes increased with age; thus,
expression profiles in deciduas from 43-week-old females were
relatively more similar to controls than those from 47-week-old
mothers. We independently confirmed differential expression of
selected candidates by reverse transcription followed by semi-
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Fig. 3b). This included genes such as Il15 receptor
alpha (Il15ra) as well as Il15 (Supplementary Fig. 3b), a key
cytokine of uterine natural killer (uNK) cell maturation28, 29. For
Bmp2 as one of the most prominent decidualisation genes, we also
verified its deregulated levels of abundance on the protein level by
Western blot (Fig. 3c).
The observed differences in expression showed that ageing
females did not simply suffer from a complete failure in
decidualisation. Instead, the expression pattern of a cohort of
dynamically
regulated genes
resembled that
of an earlier
developmental stage. For example, Bmp2 and Igf1 are highly

 expressed at early stages but decline later on during the
decidualisation process as cells become terminally differen-
tiated30–32. Conversely, Gdf10 is up-regulated from mid-gestation
to E12.5. To address this point in detail, we generated additional
transcriptomes of deciduas from conceptuses developed in young
control B6 females over a developmental time course between
E9.5 and E12.5, and integrated them with the E11.5 datasets of
the young and aged groups. Using these data for unbiased
clustering and for principal component analysis confirmed that
the majority of gene expression changes was determined by
developmental stage (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus,
deciduas from aged mothers resembled an earlier developmental
stage and consistently clustered more closely with the E9.5–10.5
control samples (Fig. 3d). Specifically, deciduas from 45- to

 47-week-old mothers clustered closest to E9.5 control deciduas,
whereas the samples from 43-week-old females clustered with the
E10.5 controls. This association was evident also in those cases
where the embryo still appeared grossly normal, indicating that
even in these conceptuses decidualisation is altered and likely
predisposes the embryo to later-onset developmental defects,
resulting in the known decrease in live offspring18, 33. Overall,
these expression patterns showed that on the global level,
decidualisation is delayed in ageing females by ∼1–2 days at
E11.5.
Uterine immune cell composition is affected by maternal age.
To determine the possible causes of these decidualisation defects,
we first focussed on the leucocyte cell population of the pregnant
uterus. An ageing environment is known to impact on NK cell
maturation and function34. Moreover, we found a deregulated
expression of the cytokine Il15 and its receptor in aged mice,
which has prominent roles in promoting NK cell survival28. uNK
cells constitute a specialised subset of the NK cell lineage only
found in the uterus where they are the most abundant immune
cell type. Compared to peripheral NK cells, uNK cells exhibit
reduced lytic capacity, yet they are key regulators of reproductive
success. They facilitate the remodelling of maternal blood vessels
and secrete angiogenic factors and cytokines, thereby influencing
placentation as well as fetal growth rates35–37. uNK cells peak in
numbers around mid-gestation when they constitute about 20%
of all leucocytes in the decidua37. Other immune cell types at the
feto-maternal interface include macrophages and dendritic cells
(DCs), albeit their functions in regulating pregnancy progression
are less well explored38.
In order to determine whether maternal age has an impact on
composition and/or maturation of immune cell populations at the
feto-maternal interface, we devised a detailed flow cytometry
strategy to delineate macrophage, DC and uNK cell populations
(Fig. 4a). Overall, we observed a slight reduction in the total
number of leucocytes in the aged deciduas (Fig. 4b). This decrease
was mainly driven by a reduction in macrophage and DC
numbers (Fig. 4c) and correlated with lower expression levels of
Csf1 (Fig. 4d), a key regulatory cytokine of macrophages and DCs
in the uterus38. By contrast, we did not detect differences in the
abundance of uNK cells, neither for the tissue resident CD49a+
subset nor the conventional NK cell subset (Fig. 4e, f and
Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, both NK cell subsets
displayed a normal maturation phenotype in aged mice as
assessed by staining for CD11b (Fig. 4f). This is in contrast to
peripheral NK cells in the spleens of aged females where a marked
reduction in NK cell numbers is observed, particularly in the
more mature CD11b+ subset (Fig. 4g), as previously reported39.
Taken together, these results show that ageing leads to an overall
reduction in leucocyte numbers at the maternal-fetal interface.
However, uNK cell abundance or maturation is not affected,
suggesting that the pregnant uterus is protected from the systemic
NK cell decline during ageing.
Aged uterine stromal cells are refractory to decidualisation. To
corroborate the view of a more prominent defect in stromal vs.
uNK cells, we interrogated our transcriptomics data against a
recently identified gene expression signature of uNK and decidual
stromal cells40. Indeed we found that the stromal cell genes
separated the young from the aged samples more clearly than the
uNK cell genes (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Our next approaches
were aimed at refining this analysis so as to trace any differences
in uterine responses back to the very early steps of pregnancy and
independent of embryo-induced influences. For this purpose, we
mated young and aged females with vasectomised males and
dissected equivalent pieces of the uterine horns at E3.5 for
transcriptomic analysis. Although there was some variability
between the aged females, it was evident that critical initiators of
decidualisation were already de-regulated at this early stage
(Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 3). Notably, inspection of
candidate genes revealed that Bmp2, Hand2, Hoxa10, Hoxa11,
Ptch1, Areg and Foxa2 were down-regulated in E3.5 uteri of aged
females even in the absence of the stimulus by an implanting
blastocyst, while Wnt4, Hbegf and E-Cadherin (Cdh1) were up-
regulated (Fig. 5b)23, 41–46. Comparing our data to the molecular
signatures of knockouts for Bmp2, progesterone receptor (Pgr),
Egfr and Wnt4, all of which exhibit profound decidualisation
defects, showed significant overlaps between de-regulated gene
sets (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 6b and Supplementary Data 4).
Global functional annotation analyses indicated that dysregulated
genes were enriched for factors in glycoprotein and secreted
protein repertoire, extracellular matrix composition, membrane
components and Bmp2-regulated factors (Fig. 5d and Supple-
mentary Data 2). It is noteworthy, however, that the abundance of
growth factors with critical roles in the decidualisation response,
chiefly Lif and Egf, remained unchanged as did their receptors
Lifr and Egfr47, 48.
As Bmp2 has been previously shown to affect proliferation
during decidualisation23, we tested the proliferative capacity of
isolated E3.5 uterine stromal cells in vitro and found that those
from aged females exhibited dramatically decreased levels of cell
proliferation (Fig. 5e). These data were further confirmed on the
histological level by Ki67 staining of E3.5 uteri. Here, too, the
uterine stroma of aged mice exhibited a low proliferative activity
compared to young controls (Fig. 5f). However, high levels of
Ki67-positive staining was retained in the luminal epithelium,
indicating that the epithelial-to-stromal cell switch in proliferative
activity in response to progesterone had not taken place yet in the
majority of aged samples49.
Blunted hormone responsiveness hampers decidualisation.
Gene expression programmes associated with the earliest steps
of decidualisation are governed by the pregnancy hormones
oestrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4)50. The de-regulation of
critical drivers of decidualisation, such Bmp2 and Hoxa10, as well
as the observed delay in the switch from epithelial to stromal cell
proliferation were strong indicators that uteri of aged mice exhibit

Fig. 3 Decidual compartment is abnormal and exhibits hallmarks of developmental delay in conceptuses developed in aged females. a Heatmap of genes
commonly de-regulated in the decidual portion of placentas developed in aged females compared to young controls. Please note that the extent of gene
de-regulation increases with age of the female (43 vs. 45–47 weeks of age) and is also more pronounced in deciduas associated with abnormal embryos (Aa).
Genes selected for display were significantly different between young (Y) and Aa deciduas. b Independent validation of differential gene expression for key
decidualisation genes by RT-qPCR. Samples are as in Fig. 1c. Data are displayed as mean ± S.E.M. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 (n = 3; ANOVA with Holm-Bonferroni’s
post-hoc test). c Confirmation of higher Bmp2 expression levels in deciduas developed in aged females by Western blot. Quantification of band intensities of
three independent biological replicates is shown in the graph below. **p < 0.01 (ANOVA with Holm-Bonferroni’s post-hoc test). d Closest neighbour analysis of
global transcriptomes generated by RNA-seq from E11.5 deciduas from aged females compared to those developed in young females of a developmental time
course from E9.5-E12.5 (in red font). Each line represents transcriptomes of 2–9 independent biological replicates (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for all samples),
with samples recovered from separate litters in every case. e Principal component analysis of the samples shown in d, showing that the E11.5 deciduas recovered
from aged females exhibit an expression signature more closely resembling that of E9.5–10.5 young samples

 problems in their hormonal responsiveness. Assessing the cohort
of genes de-regulated in deciduas of conceptuses developed in
aged females indeed revealed that over 50% of them are
associated with an oestrogen receptor-α (Esr1) and/or Pgr bind-
ing site51–53, a far greater number than expected by chance
(Fig. 6a). Although global expression levels of Pgr, specifically the
Pgr-A isoform that is dominant for uterine function54, were not
consistently changed in stromal cells of aged females (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6c, d), we noted striking differences in tissue-specific
distribution. Intriguingly, expression of both Pgr and Esr1
receptors, as well as the phosphorylated active form pEsr1, was
more variable in aged uteri. This was particularly evident in the

 luminal epithelium where a highly mosaic staining pattern was
observed (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 6e). At E6.5, strongest
Pgr staining had progressed to the secondary decidual zone in
young females. In aged samples, by contrast, highest levels were
still confined to the primary decidual zone in close proximity to
the conceptus, further corroborating a slower decidualisation
response in older females (Fig. 6c).
Since implantation per se was not impaired in aged females but
decidualisation of the stromal compartment appeared delayed, we
focussed on studying the progression of decidualisation in
response to the hormonal stimulus more closely in isolated
uterine stromal cells in vitro. When exposed to the well-
established cocktail of E2, P4 and cAMP to trigger decidualisa-
tion,
stromal
cells
from
young
females
slowed
down
in
proliferation as they started to differentiate (Fig. 6d). By contrast,
stromal cells from aged females—which already exhibited much
reduced proliferation rates under unstimulated conditions—did
not change upon exposure to the hormone cocktail, thus
underpinning a significant defect in the response to the hormonal
stimulus (Fig. 6d). To further elucidate the hypo-responsiveness
of aged cells to the decidualisation trigger, we collected cells after
2 and 4 days of exposure to the hormone cocktail, and assessed
a panel of decidualisation markers. Uterine stromal cells from
aged mice exhibited significantly lower gene expression levels of
Prl8a2 (Dtprp), Bmp2, Hand2, Hoxa10, Nr2f2 (Coup-tfII), Igfbp5
and Sfrp5 compared to young stromal cells (Fig. 6e and
Supplementary Fig. 7a). These data indicate that the aged cells
exhibit an intrinsic defect in the temporal progression of decidual
differentiation.
To pinpoint possible causes of the reduced decidualisation
response, we analysed the signal transducer and activator of
transcription-3 (Stat3). Activated Stat3 (pStat3) synergises with
Pgr by physically interacting with the Pgr-A isoform; as such,
Stat3 is required for the onset of decidualisation and appropriate
activation of Pgr target genes55–57. We therefore assessed the
levels of pStat3 in stromal cells from young and aged mice, and
consistently found reduced levels of pStat3 in the hormone-
stimulated cells of aged females (Fig. 6f and Supplementary
Fig. 7b). More significantly even, the subcellular distribution of
pStat3 was dramatically altered in stromal cells of aged E3.5 uteri
and E6.5 implantation sites. While activated Stat3 signalling was
evident by prominent nuclear pStat3 staining in the young
samples, pStat3 was excluded from the vast majority of stromal
cell nuclei in aged females (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 7c).
Since Stat3 phosphorylation is induced by Lif signalling through
Lifr via the Jak/Stat pathway, we tested whether addition of
exogenous Lif to stromal cell cultures could ameliorate the
decidualisation defect; however, the presence of Lif did not
accelerate the progression of decidualisation of aged stromal cells,
thus further supporting the cell-intrinsic nature of the defect
(Supplementary Fig. 7d). Thus, our data demonstrate that
maternal age impacts on the hormonal responsiveness of uterine
stromal cells by interfering with the availability of activated Stat3
as coactivator of the Pgr response, which interferes with
appropriate target gene activation.
Discussion
The negative impact of maternal age on reproductive outcome
is most commonly associated with the exponential increase
in non-disjunctions and other meiotic defects in the oocyte.
What has remained much less appreciated is the increase in
reproductive problems that have no karyotypic basis. In humans
these manifest as various pregnancy complications such as
pre-eclampsia, stillbirth or fetal growth restriction, as well as a
range of developmental defects to the newborn. Similarly in mice,
it has been noted that the number of live offspring declines in
older females in the absence of any appreciable depletion in
oocyte stores and despite unchanged numbers of early implan-
tation sites18, 33. Thus, embryo loss must occur post-implanta-
tion, as evidenced by a higher frequency of resorptions sites and
developmental delays at mid-gestation. It has also been noted that
placental development is perturbed by female ageing17. Here, we
systematically follow up on this observation and find that the
extent of developmental variability increases dramatically in
females aged 40 weeks and older. More significantly, we find that
abnormal embryos are associated with abnormal placentas in
every case assessed, suggesting that the malfunctional placenta
may indeed be the primary cause of embryonic demise. Taking
this thought further, it is even tempting to speculate that the
increased risk of congenital heart defects that resides with the
older mother may in fact be caused by failures in correct
placentation13.
Strikingly, the entire range of placental and embryonic
abnormalities can be rescued when fertilised embryos recovered
from aged females are allowed to develop in young foster
mothers.
Our
data
further
demonstrate
that
the
critical
age-associated problems reside in the uterine response to
pregnancy that in turn interferes with normal development of
the placenta. In line with this, early studies showed that the
reverse transfer of embryos from young donors into old recipients
hampers
developmental
progression,
even
though
these
experiments are technically challenging58. Indeed, changes to the
uterus as a likely cause of the fewer offspring to aged females have
been hinted at before18, perhaps associated with an increase
in collagen fibres59. Concordant with these early observations,

from the nucleus. Scale bars: 100 µm

 our
transcriptome
analyses
revealed
extracellular
matrix
components as a significantly de-regulated pathway in aged
deciduas. Yet there is no evidence from mouse models that
these factors alone cause the rather dramatic abrogation of
developmental progression observed in aged females. What then
are the age-related changes to the decidualising uterus that
interfere with placental development?
To address this question, we systematically dissected the
impact of age on the two major cellular components of the
decidua, i.e. uterine-specific leucocytes and decidual stromal cells.
As far as immune cell types are concerned, there is indeed
evidence
that
an
ageing
micro-environment
compromises
maturation and function of peripheral NK cells34. Consistent with
these findings, we observe reduced NK cell numbers in the
spleens of aged females. Yet in the mid-gestation decidua, the
uNK cell population remains largely unchanged both in terms of
total cell number and maturation state between implantation sites
developed in young and aged females. By contrast, we observed a
drastic reduction in the number of DCs, which is associated with
reduced expression levels of Csf1 as a critical cytokine directing
their recruitment and maturation38. DCs direct the immune
response at the implantation site in the presence of the
semi-allogeneic fetus60. Moreover, the depletion of DCs just
before implantation has been shown to disrupt embryo implan-
tation and decidualisation. Indeed it is associated with impaired
proliferation and differentiation of endometrial stromal cells61, 62.
Thus, the reduction of DCs and their trophic function in the
decidualised uterus of aged mice may well be an important
contributory factor to the perturbations of placental development.
Collectively, however, our data point to a more profound defect
in the stromal cell compartment. The majority of genes that are
de-regulated in aged deciduas form part of the transcriptional
programmes directed by the Pgr and Esr1 receptors51, 53.
Consistent with this, we noted a striking heterogeneity in
expression of both receptors already at E3.5 in the uterine
epithelium of aged females. It is tempting to speculate that this
pattern may indeed explain the spread in phenotypes that is
characteristic of pregnancy in aged female mice. Conceptuses that
appear normal at mid-gestation may have implanted at sites of
high Pgr and Esr1 expression, whereas severely growth-retarded
implantations may have occurred at Pgr/Esr1-depleted sites. The
developmental kinetics of global expression profiles further
showed that decidualisation was delayed by 1–2 days at E11.5.
We demonstrate that this delay can be traced back to the very
early stages of hormonal priming of the uterus and that it is
independent of embryo-induced effects. Stromal cells of aged
females exhibit significantly reduced proliferation rates and
are blunted in their molecular response to the decidualisation
stimulus. These findings corroborate and extend previous reports
that deciduomata from old mice are smaller than those from
young63. They also show that the impairment is independent of
hormone levels per se, as cells in vitro were exposed to identical
culture conditions.
Integrating our data with other models of decidualisation
failure, we find significant overlaps with master regulators of
decidualisation, notably factors in the Pgr pathway including
Bmp2, Nr2f2 and Ptch1. In line with this, Pgr-mediated effects
such as the down-regulation of Ltf, Muc1 and Cdh1 are less
efficient or delayed with age, as evident from our transcriptional
profiles (Supplementary Data 3), even though this does not
impact on implantation rates18, 33, 47. Yet other factors, such as
the steroid receptor co-activators Ncoa1 and Ncoa2, that help to
relay the Pgr signal in the nucleus, as well as Lif availability
remain seemingly unchanged, at least on the transcriptional
level64. Importantly, however, we demonstrate that the overall
abundance and specifically the nuclear availability of activated
Stat3 is profoundly reduced in stromal cells of aged females.
Given that pStat3 binds to and synergises with Pgr to achieve
adequate levels of target gene activation, it is most likely that this
reduction in transcriptional activator availability underlies the
inability to elicit an appropriate decidualisation response. Indeed,
selective deletion of Stat3 from stromal cells has been reported to
result in a significant reduction in embryonic survival, increased
resorption rates and placental dys-morphology65. Interestingly,
Stat signalling was also predicted as a key transcriptional reg-
ulatory pathway affected by age in the non-pregnant myome-
trium, thus lending further support to our findings66.
Overall, our study highlights the importance of the ageing
uterine environment as a prevalent cause of reproductive decline
in older females. Although this concept has been noted to some
extent before58,
67, the underlying molecular changes had
remained elusive. In general, the considerable impact of maternal
age on reproductive success unrelated to oocyte fitness has not
been widely appreciated. Even though it remains to be established
to what extent these findings in the mouse translate to the
situation in humans, our data prompt an in-depth investigation
into the impact of maternal age on the capacity of the repro-
ductive tract to support normal pregnancy unrelated to oocyte
health.
Methods
Mice. C57BL/6Babr mice were used throughout this study. Virgin females were
caged in groups up to 5 until they had reached the desired age as indicated.
All animal experiments were conducted in full compliance with UK Home Office
regulations and with approval of the local animal welfare committee (AWERB) at
The Babraham Institute, and with the relevant project and personal licences in
place. “Young” females were generally 8–12 weeks old. Timed matings were set up
with standard C57BL/6Babr stud males of 8–16 weeks of age, counting the morning
of the vaginal plug as E0.5. “Aged” males were 1 year old. Pregnant females
were dissected at the gestational age indicated, and processed for histology,
RNA isolation or stromal cell isolation as described.
Histology. Placentas of E11.5 conceptuses, E3.5 uteri and E6.5 whole implantation
sites were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for routine
paraffin histology. Sections of 7 µm were cut on a Leica paraffin microtome.
For H&E) staining, sections were deparaffinised and incubated in Mayer’s
haematoxylin (Sigma #51275) for 10 min, followed by a brief wash in tap water.
Differentiation of staining was carried out in 70% acid alcohol (70% ethanol, 1%
hydrochloric acid) for 10 s, followed by incubation in cold tap water for 10 min.
Eosin (alcoholic eosin, Sigma #HT110116) staining was performed for 30 s,
followed by dehydration of sections and mounting with Eukitt quick-hardening
mounting medium (Sigma #03989).
For immunostainings, antigen retrieval was performed by boiling in 1 mM
EDTA, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween-20 or in 10 mM Na citrate buffer, pH 6.0, followed by
blocking in PBS, 0.5% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20. Antibodies used were Ki67
(Abcam ab15580, 1:200 dilution), Pgr (Dako A0098, 1:1000), pStat3 (Cell Signaling
9138S, 1:200), Esr1 (Santa Cruz sc-543, 1:200) and pEsr1 (Santa Cruz sc-101675,
1:200). Secondary antibodies used were either the appropriate AlexaFluor or
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies used at 1:500 and 1:100, respectively.
uNK cell staining was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
Dolichus biflorus agglutinin (Sigma #L1287) at 1:100 dilution following boiling
in 0.01 M Na citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Counter-staining was performed with
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for immunofluorescence and hematoxylin for
immunohistochemistry.
For RNA in situ hybridisations, linearised plasmids containing cDNA inserts
from the Plf cDNA were used to generate digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled riboprobes
using the DIG RNA-labelling protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche #11277073910). In situ hybridisations were carried out at 52 °C overnight
using standard procedures. Signals were detected with anti-DIG-alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Roche), and staining was performed overnight
using NBT and BCIP reagents (Promega #S3771). Sections were counterstained
with nuclear fast red (Sigma #N3020).
RT-qPCR expression analysis. For RT-qPCR analysis, total RNA was extracted
with TRI reagent (Sigma T9424). Total RNA of 0.5–1 µg was reverse transcribed
with random hexamer primers (Thermo Scientific SO142) using RevertAid
H-Minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific EP0451) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Jump Start
Taq Ready mix (Sigma S4438) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 or CFX384 thermocycler using
gene-specific intron-flanking primers (Supplementary Table 1). Gene expression

 was analysed on triplicate samples and the Ct values were normalised to Sdha
housekeeping gene. Where appropriate, Student’s t tests or analysis of variance
(ANOVA) were performed to calculate statistical significance of expression
differences (p < 0.05). mRNA expression is expressed as the mean relative to the
control sample; error bars indicate standard error of the mean (S.E.M.). Box plots
were generated using http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/.
RNA-seq. For RNA-seq from deciduas, total RNA was prepared using Allprep
DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen 80204) followed by Dnase treatment using the
TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies AM1907). mRNA was isolated from total
DNA-free RNA (350 ng) using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Life
Technologies 61006). Indexed, strand-specific libraries were prepared using the
ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre SSV21106) according to
manufacturers’ instructions. Libraries were quantified/assessed using both the
KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems KK4824) and Bioanalyzer
2100 system (Agilent). Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced with a 100 bp
single-end protocol on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer. Raw fastq data were
mapped to the Mus musculus GRCm38 genome assembly using TopHat v2.0.12.
Bioinformatic analysis. Data were quantitated at a protein-coding mRNA level
using the RNA-seq quantitation pipeline in SeqMonk software (http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk), and normalised according to total read count
(reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads, RPKM), and 75%
distribution. Differential expression was calculated using DESeq2 and intensity
difference in SeqMonk, with a p value threshold of 0.05 and adjusted for multiple
testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Stringently differentially
expressed genes were defined as meeting both DESeq2 and intensity difference
criteria, whereas less stringent genes met one or both criteria.
Heatmaps were generated using Heatmap.2 in R. Principal component analysis
was performed using DESeq2 rlog-normalised RNA-seq data on read counts using
the top 500 most variable genes, before plotting the principal component analysis
using prcomp in R. GO and gene set enrichment analyses using the MSigDB
database (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) were performed on genes
found to be significantly differentially up-regulated or down-regulated, separately,
against a background list of genes consisting of those with more than 20 reads
aligned. GO terms with a Bonferroni p value of <0.05 were found using DAVID68,
Gorilla69 and GREAT GO resources. Venn diagrams were plotted using BioVenn
http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/cdd/biovenn/.
For the analysis of gene proximity to Pgr and Esr1 binding elements, we first
determined the cohort of differentially expressed genes between young and aged
deciduas using DESeq2 and intensity difference in SeqMonk. Proximity of these
genes to Pgr and Esr1 binding sites51–53 was determined using published data,
available in NCBI GEO dataset accession numbers GSE34927 and GSE36455
in bed format, using a 10 kb cut-off. Differentially expressed genes were split into
up-regulated and down-regulated genes, which were analysed separately. Statistical
significance of the overlap was calculated by Fisher’s exact test in R.
Microarrays of uterine RNA samples from conditional ablation of Bmp2, Wnt4,
Egfr2 and their respective control groups were performed by Genomic and
RNA profiling Core of Baylor College of Medicine as described previously45.
Two-tailed t test and fold changes were used to define differentially expressed
probes. To obtain a non-redundant list of significantly altered genes, multiple
probe sets for a given gene (when present) were averaged. Genes with an absolute
fold change of ≥1.4 and a p value of ≤0.01 were considered for further analysis.
RNA-seq data from E3.5 uteri were split into up-regulated and down-regulated
genes, and compared with the microarray datasets. The significance of the pairwise
overlap between the datasets was determined by Fisher’s exact test, against a
background of all genes detected in both RNA-seq and microarray datasets.
Stromal cell isolation and culture. Fresh stromal cell isolation as previously
described70 with a few modifications. In brief, uteri from E3.5 mice were slit
longitudinally and disaggregated with 2.5% pancreatin (Sigma P3293) and 0.5%
trypsin (type III) (Sigma T4799) in Hank’s basic salt solution (HBSS)-calcium/
magnesium free for 1.5 h on ice. After vortexing, the medium was removed and the
remaining tissue washed twice in HBSS (discarding luminal epithelial cells) and
incubated 30 min at 37 °C in HBSS containing 0.007% collagenase (ThermoFisher
Scientific 17104-019), 0.02% DNase I (Roche 10104159001), 0.008% protease
(Sigma P8811) with vortexing every 5 min. Dissociated tissues were then triturated,
filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and spun at 1000 × g for
5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in phenol-red free Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (ThermoFisher Scientific
21041-025) plus 10% foetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate
(ThermoFisher Scientific 11360-039), 1X antimycotic/antibiotic (ThermoFisher
Scientific #15240-062) and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (ThermoFisher Scientific
#31350-010).
Decidualisation of cultured uterine stromal cells was induced by
incubating the cells with complete DMEM/F-12 medium plus 10 nM
β-estradiol (Sigma #E2758), 1 µM medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate
(Sigma #M1629) and 10 µM 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate
(Sigma #B5386) (E2 + P4 + cAMP). The culture medium was changed every 2 or
3 days with continuous supplementation with these treatments.
Proliferation assay. For analysis of cell proliferation rates, 10,000 uterine stromal
cells from young and aged mice were plated in either complete DMEM/F12
medium or complete medium containing the decidualisation-inducing cocktail
(E2 + P4 + cAMP) and collected every 24 h over 4 days. After trypsinisation the
number of viable cells was counted using the Muse Count & Viability Assay
Kit (Merck Millipore MCH100102) and run on the Muse cell analyser
(Merck Millipore), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical analysis
was performed using ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc test.
Western blot. Total cell extracts from deciduas were prepared in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
sodium dodecyl sulphate), or in the case of uterine stromal cells, cells were lysed in
a detergent buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 0.5%
Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P2714), and
incubated at 4°C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation (9300 × g, 10 min). Western
blotting was performed following a standard protocol. Blots were probed with the
following antibodies: anti-pStat3 (Tyr705) (Cell Signaling #9138S), anti-Stat3
(Cell Signaling #12640S), anti-Pgr (Dako #A0098), anti-beta-actin (Abcam
ab6276), anti-Bmp2 (Peprotech #500-P195). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Detection was carried out with enhanced
chemiluminescence reaction (GE Healthcare RPN2209) using standard X-ray films.
Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software. All primary scans of
Western blots are provided in Supplementary Fig. 8.
Leucocyte analysis. Preparation of single cell suspensions and FACS analysis were
performed as per established protocols. Briefly, mesometrial poles of E10.5
implantation sites were dissected, pooled and minced and tissue homogenates
digested with Liberase TM (Sigma 05401119001). Cells were typed with
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for CD45 (30-F11), NK1.1 (PK138), CD11b
(M1/70), CD49a (HMα1), CD49b (DX5), I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5),
F4/80 (BM8), CD11c (N418), CD3ε (145-2C11), NKp46 (29A1.4) and Eomes
(Dan11mag) purchased from BD PharMingen, BioLegend or eBioscience. For
intracellular and intranuclear antigens, Fix & Perm and Foxp3 staining buffer set
(both eBioscience) were used, respectively. Cells were acquired on an LSRFortessa.
