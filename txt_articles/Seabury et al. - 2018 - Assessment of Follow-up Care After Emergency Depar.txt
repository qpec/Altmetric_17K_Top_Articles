Abstract
IMPORTANCE Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects millions of Americans each year. Lack of
consistent clinical practice raises concern that many patients with mTBI may not receive adequate follow-
up care.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the provision of follow-up care to patients with mTBI during the first 3
months after injury.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study used data on patients with mTBI
enrolled in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI)
study between February 26, 2014, and August 25, 2016. We examined site-specific variations in
follow-up care, the types of clinicians seen by patients receiving follow-up care, and patient and
injury characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of receiving follow-up care. The TRACK-TBI
study is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal observational study of patients with TBI presenting
to the emergency department of 1 of 11 level I US trauma centers. Study data included patients with
head trauma who underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan within 24 hours of injury, had a
Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15, were aged 17 years or older, and completed follow-up care
surveys at 2 weeks and 3 months after injury (N = 831).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Follow-up care was defined as hospitals providing TBI
educational material at discharge, hospitals calling patients to follow up, and patients seeing a
physician or other medical practitioner within 3 months after the injury. Unfavorable outcomes were
assessed with the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire.
RESULTS Of 831 patients (289 [35%] female; 483 [58%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 40.3
[16.9] years), less than half self-reported receiving TBI educational material at discharge (353 patients
[42%]) or seeing a physician or other health care practitioner within 3 months after injury (367
patients [44%]). Follow-up care varied by study site; adjusting for patient characteristics, the
provision of educational material varied from 19% to 72% across sites. Of 236 patients with a positive
finding on a CT scan, 92 (39%) had not seen a medical practitioner 3 months after the injury.
Adjusting for injury severity and demographics, patient admission to the hospital ward or intensive
care unit, patient income, and insurance status were not associated with the probability of seeing a
medical practitioner. Among the patients with 3 or more moderate to severe postconcussive
symptoms, only 145 of 279 (52%) reported having seen a medical practitioner by 3 months.

Key Points
Question Do patients with mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI) receive
adequate levels of follow-up care?
Findings In a cohort study using data on
831 patients with mTBI presenting to
the emergency department at 1 of 11
level I trauma centers across the United
States, 42% of patients reported
receiving educational material at
discharge and 44% reported seeing a
physician or other medical practitioner
within 3 months after injury. Among
patients with 3 or more moderate to
severe postconcussive symptoms, only
52% reported having seen a practitioner
within 3 months following the injury.
Meaning A large proportion of patients
with mTBI do not receive follow-up care
after injury even when they experience
ongoing postconcussive symptoms.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical global public health issue. This type of injury affects millions of
Americans each year, resulting in approximately 2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits in
2013.1 Of brain injuries among patients presenting to the ED, most are classified as mild TBI (mTBI) or
concussion, defined by an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15.2,3 Despite the
classification of mild, mTBI can lead to persistent physical, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive symptoms
that have a major impact on function and quality of life of the injured patient.4-7 In a recent report
from the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study,
22% of patients with mTBI remained functionally impaired 1 year after the injury.4 While data on the
cost of mTBI are limited, one estimate suggests that mTBI is associated with as much as a 75%
increase in expected medical costs up to 3 years after injury,8 and there is growing evidence that the
sequelae of TBI may also contribute to loss of employment, homelessness, and incarceration.9-11
While patients with moderate to severe TBI are almost always admitted to a hospital or
intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and intervention,12-14 there is considerably less
consensus as to best practices for patients with mTBI.15-18 The lack of consistent clinical practice
raises concerns that many patients with mTBI may not receive adequate follow-up care. To date, few
studies have investigated follow-up care after mTBI, but what evidence does exist suggests
important deficiencies. For instance, more than 60% of a sample of patients that included both those
with mTBI and those with moderate to severe TBI (GCS score of 3-15) received no additional services
following discharge from the acute care hospital in the late 1990s.19 Failure to follow up with patients
could have adverse consequences, as simply providing educational materials to patients with mTBI
is associated with improved outcomes.20-22
In the current study, we examined a key aspect of mTBI and concussion management, the
provision of follow-up care after hospital discharge, using data from the prospective, multicenter,
longitudinal observational TRACK-TBI study cohort. Participants in this study were surveyed
regarding follow-up care in the first 3 months after injury. We examined site-specific variations in
follow-up care, the types of physicians or other medical practitioners seen, and the patient and injury
characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of receiving follow-up care.
Methods
Study Data
The TRACK-TBI study is an ongoing prospective, longitudinal, observational study of patients with
TBI who presented to the ED of 1 of 11 level I US trauma centers (Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston,
Texas; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San
Francisco, California; University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; R Adams Cowley
Shock Trauma Center, Baltimore, Maryland; Ryder Trauma Center, Miami, Florida; University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Seton Medical Center, Austin, Texas; Parkland
Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Texas; Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington; and Virginia
Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond).
Participants or their legal representatives provided written informed consent to participate.
Competency for self-consent was determined through administration of the Galveston Orientation
and Amnesia Test. For those without a passing score, a legally authorized representative provided

 consent, and competency screening was completed at subsequent follow-ups. Eligible participants
were approached by study staff who explained the study, reviewed the consent form, and obtained
consent within 24 hours of injury, unless the site had a waiver of consent for enrollment. A number
of TRACK-TBI sites obtained local institutional review board approval to collect biospecimens along
with a defined set of acute data variables under a waiver of consent. A waiver of consent was applied
in situations in which a potential study patient satisfied all study inclusion criteria but did not have
the capacity to consent and did not have a legally authorized representative who could be identified
within the 24-hour consent period required by the study. This type of circumstance occurs with some
frequency in this population because of the rapidly unfolding events around these traumatic injuries.
This waiver of consent protocol allowed collection of vitally important biospecimen data during the
acute time frame, a period when the brain and body are experiencing rapidly fluctuating reactions
due to the injury. Informed consent was obtained when it was determined that the patient regained
capacity to consent or a legally authorized representative was identified. In a small number of special
cases, the local institutional review board approved biospecimen data retention in the study without
informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative (eg, patient died and a
legally authorized representative was never identified due to homelessness, no family, etc). All data
analyzed in this study were stripped of protected health information and completely deidentified.
The institutional review boards of each institution approved the study. The Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline was followed.
Inclusion criteria were acute head trauma sufficient for an ED physician to order a clinical head
computed tomography (CT) scan within 24 hours of injury. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy,
incarceration, nonsurvivable physical trauma, debilitating mental health disorders or neurological
disease, magnetic resonance imaging contraindications (eg, cardiac pacemakers, aneurism clips,
insulin pumps), and preexisting medical conditions that could interfere with outcome assessments.
Because this study focused on mTBI, including concussion, we further restricted the sample to
patients with a GCS score of 13 to 15 on arrival at the ED, loss of consciousness for less than 30
minutes, and posttraumatic amnesia duration of less than 24 hours. At each milestone (2 weeks and
3 months), participants were followed up with 19 standard outcome assessments that included
measures of postconcussive and/or TBI-related symptoms, psychological health, and global
outcome. In addition, a 200-question interview was administered to participants or their surrogates
to assess follow-up medical care as well as the economic and health consequences of TBI.
Study data analyzed in this article include TRACK-TBI patients aged 17 years or older with mTBI
who were enrolled between February 26, 2014, and August 25, 2016. Patient characteristics used in
the analyses included age, sex, race and ethnicity, health insurance status, and income prior to injury.
These variables were used as covariates in statistical analyses to account for any observable
differences in the patient population that might correlate with follow-up care. The data also included
injury characteristics, including admission GCS score, initial head CT scan results, cause of injury, and
whether the patient experienced posttraumatic amnesia, loss of consciousness, or altered
consciousness. Patients were identified as having a positive finding on the initial head CT if a lesion
consistent with acute TBI (eg, contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage) was documented in the
radiology report.
The primary goal of the analysis was to examine patients’receipt of care and how it varied
according to patient characteristics and across study sites. The 2-week and 3-month follow-up
surveys captured self-reports of follow-up care received and clinical outcome measures of physical
and psychological symptom burden. Specifically, patients were asked whether they received TBI
educational materials from the hospital at discharge, whether anyone from the hospital called them
to follow up about their TBI, and whether they had seen a physician or other health care practitioner
since being discharged (and if so, the type of practitioner seen). Our analysis only included patients
who responded to all interview questions pertaining to follow-up care at both 2 weeks and 3 months.
To measure clinical outcomes, patients in the TRACK-TBI study were assessed with the
Rivermead Post Concussion Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) tool

 at 3 months. The RPQ measures severity of headaches, dizziness, and nausea as well as cognitive,
mood, and sleep disturbances and other physical symptoms associated with postconcussion
syndrome (PCS) on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the symptom was not experienced at all and 4
indicating the symptom was a severe problem within the past 7 days, as compared with preinjury
status. Following Sterr et al,23 we identified patients with PCS as those with 3 or more postconcussive
symptoms with a severity rating of 3 or higher. The BSI-18 provides an assessment of psychological
distress by measuring depression, anxiety, and somatization symptom domains. This study used t
scores, calculated from the summed responses in each domain and normalized across sex. A Global
Severity Index t score of 63 or higher is considered a clinically significant level of distress.4
Statistical Analysis
We first conducted a descriptive analysis by measuring the percentage of patients who reported
receiving educational materials at discharge, receiving a follow-up call from the hospital, or seeing a
medical practitioner in the 2 weeks after injury and in the 3 months after injury. We compared
follow-up care for patients with and without positive findings on the initial head CT to test whether
the likelihood of follow-up care was associated with clinical severity. For those patients who did see a
practitioner by 3 months, we examined the type(s) of practitioners seen.
Differences in the rate of follow-up care across study sites could be driven by differences in the
underlying patient characteristics (eg, patient insurance status). To account for this, we used
multivariate logistic regression to test whether patient characteristics, injury characteristics, or study
site were associated with the receipt of follow-up care. We examined odds ratios (ORs) from the
logistic regression to examine how patient and injury characteristics were associated with follow-up
care. To demonstrate the magnitude of variation in follow-up care across study sites, we computed
adjusted values for the percentage of patients expected to receive follow-up care in each site holding
other covariates at their mean values. The variation in these adjusted values reports the site-specific
variation in the use of follow-up care, removing any observable differences in the underlying patient
populations across sites.
Finally, we investigated whether receipt of follow-up care was correlated with outcomes at 3
months. We tested whether patients who were symptomatic and experiencing worse outcomes
were more likely to receive follow-up care by calculating the percentage of patients who reported
having seen a medical practitioner by 3 months after injury compared with their burden of
postconcussive symptoms and psychological distress. The significance of the differences in the
percentage of patients seeing a medical practitioner by 3 months for those who were or were not
symptomatic was assessed using paired t tests.
As noted previously, we excluded patients who either exited the study or did not respond to the
questions about educational materials or seeing a medical practitioner at either 2 weeks or 3 months.
This exclusion could have been because patients were lost to follow-up, because the full battery was
not completed, or because the follow-up care variables did not apply (for example, if participants
were still admitted at 2 weeks, the follow-up care questions were not administered). To understand
whether this exclusion resulted in selection bias in the study sample, we compared patient and injury
characteristics of the full sample and the final study sample. We conducted a multivariate logistic
regression of the likelihood of being included in the study to determine whether demographic,
socioeconomic, or injury factors were associated with missingness.
Stata statistical software version 14.0 (StataCorp) was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
There were 1316 patients with mTBI enrolled in the TRACK-TBI study at the point that we began our
analysis. Of these, 1017 (77%) completed all follow-up care questions at 2 weeks and 919 (70%)
completed them at 3 months; we further restricted the sample to participants who had completed
follow-up care questions at both time points, resulting in a final study sample of 831 participants (289

 [35%] female; 483 [58%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 40.3 [16.9] years). Most patients (460
[55%]) had an annual income of less than $50 000. The eTable in the Supplement compares
characteristics of the full sample and the study sample. Overall, patient characteristics were similar
between the full sample and the study sample. Using multivariate logistic regression to test which
variables were associated with inclusion in the final study sample, we found that privately insured
patients were more likely to be included than uninsured patients (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.39-0.79), while
patients with an undisclosed or unknown income level were less likely to be included than patients
with a reported income of less than $50 000 (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84). Admission to the ICU
was also associated with a lower likelihood of being included (OR relative to patients discharged from
the ED, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.32-0.69), at least in part because these patients were still being cared for in
the acute setting and were therefore less likely to be administered the questions at 2 weeks.
We describe the characteristics of the final study sample in Table 1. Of the 831 patients in the
sample, 658 (79%) had a GCS score of 15, corresponding to the highest level of consciousness
indicator. Overall, 236 patients (28%) had a lesion on the initial CT scan. Approximately 35% (288
patients) were discharged home, 44% (362 patients) were admitted to the hospital but not to the
ICU, and 22% (181 patients) were admitted to the ICU.
Most patients with mTBI and concussion enrolled in the TRACK-TBI study received no follow-up
care at either 2 weeks or 3 months after injury (Table 2). Approximately 42% (353 patients) reported

 that they received TBI educational material at discharge and 27% (209 patients) reported having
been called to follow up about their brain injury by 2 weeks. Similarly, less than half of patients (41%
[343 patients]) reported having seen a medical practitioner about their mTBI at 2 weeks, and 44%
(367 patients) reported seeing a medical practitioner by 3 months.
There was wide site-specific variation in patients’receipt of follow-up care even after adjusting
for patient characteristics across sites. The Figure depicts the adjusted rates of TBI educational
material receipt at discharge and having seen a medical practitioner by 3 months. These rates
correspond to the expected percentage of patients receiving follow-up care at each site if all patients
had identical demographics and injury characteristics. Sites were ranked by the adjusted rate of
educational material receipt and assigned an alphabetic identifier for display purposes (A-K). Two
sites, J and K, differed from the others in that they had affiliated specialty TBI clinics. The adjusted
rate of receiving educational material at discharge varied from 19% to 72%, while the rate of having
seen a practitioner at 3 months after injury ranged from 22% to 58%. There was no discernable site-
level correlation between receiving educational materials and seeing a practitioner, except that sites
with specialty TBI clinics had the highest rates for both outcomes.
Of the 273 patients who saw a medical practitioner by 3 months and answered the series of
follow-up questions to identify the type of practitioner, 218 (80%) reported that seeing a clinician
was helpful. By 3 months, slightly less than a third (29% [80 patients]) had seen more than 1 clinician
type. The majority (52% [141 patients]) reported seeing a general practitioner, while 38% (105) saw
a neurologist (Table 3). Of particular interest to our analysis was the percentage of patients who
visited a TBI clinic, where they would have been most likely to see a practitioner specializing in TBI
care. Only 15% (42 patients) reported visiting a clinic that specialized in TBI or concussion. Of the 42

 patients who reported having visited a TBI clinic, 31 (74%) were treated at sites J or K, although these
study sites represent just 24% of the full study sample.
Injury severity was associated with patient receipt of follow-up care (Table 4). In particular, a
GCS score of 13 or 14, denoting a higher injury severity than a score of 15 (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.10-2.58)
and a positive finding on the initial head CT scan consistent with TBI (OR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.90-4.60)
were associated with greater likelihood of seeing a medical practitioner. By 3 months, 144 of the 236
patients with a positive finding on a CT scan (61%) had seen a medical practitioner and 92 (39%) had
not. In contrast, loss of consciousness and alteration of consciousness were not associated with
having seen a medical practitioner, nor were hospital admission or admission to the ICU.
Some patient demographic characteristics were associated with follow-up care. Women (OR,
1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.08) and non-Hispanic white patients (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.10-2.43) were more
likely than men and members of other racial/ethnic groups, respectively, to have seen a practitioner
by 3 months. However, when controlling for these factors, age, patient admission to the hospital
ward or ICU, income, and insurance status were not associated with having seen a medical
practitioner by 3 months.
Patients with poorer outcomes 3 months after injury were only somewhat more likely to receive
follow-up care. At the 3-month follow-up, 279 patients (34%) had 3 or more moderate or severe
postconcussive symptoms on the RPQ, consistent with PCS.23 Among the patients with PCS, 145
(52%) reported having seen a practitioner by 3 months, with the remainder (134 patients [48%])
reporting no follow-up. Similarly, for the 145 patients (17%) with BSI-18 scores meeting definitions of
psychological distress, less than half (68 patients [47%]) had seen a practitioner by 3 months.
Discussion
We found that less than half of patients with mTBI self-reported receiving TBI educational material at
discharge or seeing a medical practitioner within 3 months of the injury. There were wide disparities
in rates of follow-up care across study sites and variation among the types of medical practitioners
who provide follow-up care to patients with mTBI. Overall, a positive finding on the initial head CT
scan was most closely associated with receiving follow-up care. Nevertheless, nearly 40% of patients
with a positive finding on a head CT scan (92 of 236) had not seen a physician or other practitioner
by 3 months following their injury. Somewhat surprisingly, patient income and insurance status were
not associated with receipt of follow-up care. We also found that even patients admitted to the
hospital ward or ICU were no more likely to have received follow-up care than those discharged
directly from the ED. The finding that 48% of patients with significant postconcussive symptoms
(134 of 279) were not seen by a medical practitioner by 3 months underscores the need to improve
the system of care for mTBI and concussion.
Low rates of follow-up care, in and of themselves, do not necessarily signify an unmet need for
care. If patients who did not see a practitioner were those who fully recovered from their TBI, the
observed rates of care might be reasonable. However, our findings suggest that this is probably not
the case. Despite higher rates of follow-up care for patients with a lesion on a CT scan, only half (145
of 279 [52%]) of patients with 3 or more moderate to severe postconcussive symptoms on the RPQ
had seen a practitioner by 3 months after their injury.
Our findings reveal the consequences that may result from the absence of systems of follow-up
care for patients with mTBI and concussion. They also highlight an apparent lack of appreciation by
many clinicians of the substantial symptom and life burdens experienced by a significant proportion
of patients with injuries labeled mild. One contributing factor in the acute and critical care setting is
that mTBI comes with extremely low risk of mortality. For that reason, patients with mTBI are often
quickly triaged. Increased efforts are warranted to raise ED clinician awareness of the importance of
follow-up care to prevent morbidity and disability.
Recent evidence has stressed that mild TBI can have serious consequences and is often
associated with burdensome symptoms and disabilities.4,24-26 Indeed, for a third of the patients

Follow-up After Emergency Care for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Concussion

 included in this study (279 patients [34%]), 3 or more moderate to severe postconcussive symptoms
persisted 3 months after injury. Such outcomes emphasize the need for better—and more
consistent—care for a population at high risk of long-term disability and quality-of-life impairments.
It is noteworthy that our results, reported in the Figure, show that patients treated at the 2 facilities
with specialty TBI clinics fared the best as measured by receiving educational materials and seeing a
practitioner by 3 months.
Although we are not aware of any other recent studies examining rates of follow-up care for
patients with mTBI at level I trauma centers across the United States, our study can be grouped with
related literature examining the value of postacute care. Driven in part by new programs imposing
penalties for hospital readmission, there has been considerable interest in testing whether follow-up
after discharge can prevent readmission, although results have been mixed.27-29 Our study does not
speak directly to whether follow-up care improves outcomes, but it does suggest that rates of
follow-up for discharged patients with mTBI may be lower than for other conditions. For example, 1
study found that 79% of Medicare beneficiaries with a wide range of conditions had a physician
follow-up visit within 3 months of an acute care hospitalization, thereby reducing hospital
readmission and decreasing health expenditures.30 In the case of mTBI, it is possible that its relatively
low mortality rate and a general lack of care coordination after an ED visit contribute to low rates of
follow-up even for patients experiencing symptoms.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. The sample size constrained the power of statistical analysis. The
relatively small number of study sites and the fact that they were all university-affiliated, level I
trauma centers may limit the generalizability of the results. We expect that hospital practice and
procedures are a significant driver of follow-up care, and more work is needed to understand what
can be done to improve rates of follow-up and availability of TBI-specific care. Another limitation is
the potential for inherent biases associated with patient self-reporting of follow-up care and
outcomes. In particular, patients who have experienced a brain injury may have impaired ability to
recall receipt of educational materials or follow-up care. However, if patients do not recall receiving
educational materials because of their head injury, this could mean that changes are needed in the
process for delivering these materials. Our data also had relatively little information on polytrauma or
other factors associated with injury that could have affected patient need for follow-up care. If
patients had significant polytrauma not observed in the study, we expect that would increase the
need for follow-up care, making our results even more noteworthy.
Conclusions
We found low rates of follow-up care following mTBI with important variations across US level I
trauma centers. The 2 study sites with facilities that specialized in TBI had the highest rates of
follow-up care, and most patients who were followed up reported that it was helpful. Injury severity
was associated with follow-up, although even patients experiencing persistent postconcussive
symptoms and psychological distress often did not receive follow-up care. These results highlight the
need for more rigorous and systematic follow-up for patients who experience TBI or concussion,
including systems of care specifically designed to offer follow-up treatment to patients with mTBI.
