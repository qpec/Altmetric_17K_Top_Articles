abstract
Sexual violence is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of sexual 
victimizations. Since the American Academy of Pediatrics published its 
last policy statement on sexual assault in 2008, additional information and 
data have emerged about sexual violence affecting adolescents and the 
treatment and management of the adolescent who has been a victim of 
sexual assault. This report provides new information to update physicians 
and focuses on the acute assessment and care of adolescent victims who 
have experienced a recent sexual assault. Follow-up of the acute assault, as 
well as prevention of sexual assault, are also discussed.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
BACKGROUND
For the purposes of this clinical report, “sexual assault” is a 
comprehensive term that describes any nonconsensual sexual act. Sexual 
assault includes any situation in which there is nonvoluntary sexual 
contact, with or without penetration and/or touching of the anogenital 
area or breasts, that occurs because of physical force, psychological 
coercion, or incapacitation or impairment (eg, secondary to alcohol or 
drug use). Sexual assault also occurs when victims cannot consent or 
understand the consequences of their choice because of their age or 
because of developmental challenges. 
1
This report only addresses acute sexual assault in the adolescent age 
group (including follow-up care and prevention) and not sexual abuse of 
young children or abuse that might be disclosed long after it occurred. 
Most jurisdictions define “acute” to reflect an event that occurred in the 
past 72 hours. Some jurisdictions include events as far out as 7 to 10 
days in the “acute” category. For more information about sexual abuse 
of children and adolescents, please refer to the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical report, “The Evaluation of Children in the 
Primary Care Setting When Sexual Abuse Is Suspected.” 
2 Available 
resources and services for adolescents who have been sexually assaulted 
will vary from community to community. Pediatricians should become 
familiar with the resources available in their community.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
National data show that teenagers 
and young adults ages 12 to 34 
years have the highest rates of being 
sexually assaulted of any age group. 
3 
Annual rates of sexual assault were 
reported in 2012 (for 2011) by 
the US Department of Justice to be 
0.9 per 1000 persons 12 years and 
older (male and female). From 2002 
to 2011, there has been an overall 
decrease of 37% in rape/sexual 
assaults, including a 10% decrease 
in 2010 to 2011. 
3, 
 
4 A survey of 1200 
middle- and high-school students 
identified that 18% of girls and 12% 
of boys had an unwanted sexual 
experience during adolescence. 
5 In 
2014, the White House published 
a report of a task force appointed 
to protect college students from 
sexual assault.6 Sexual assaults occur 
frequently on college campuses; 
a 2009 study showed that 20% 
of women report being sexually 
assaulted while in college, typically 
in their first 2 years. 
7 In almost 
80% of the cases, the perpetrator is 
someone the woman knows, rather 
than a stranger. More recently, the 
Association of American Universities 
released a study surveying 27 
institutions of higher education, 
reporting that almost 12% of female 
and male college students say they 
experienced nonconsensual sexual 
contact by threat of physical force, 
by actual physical force, or while 
incapacitated. 
8 The percentage 
of female respondents reporting 
sexual assault or misconduct was 
23%. Perpetrators have been 
classmates, friends, ex-partners, 
and acquaintances. 
9 Statistics on 
sexual assault may reflect substantial 
underreporting. In addition, because 
many victims do not immediately 
disclose an assault, “past-year 
surveys” may not reliably capture 
the actual number of victims and 
incidents.
Studies have demonstrated that 
two-thirds to three-quarters of 
all adolescent sexual assaults are 
perpetrated by an acquaintance or 
relative of the adolescent. 
10, 
 
11 Older 
adolescents are most commonly 
victims during social encounters 
with assailants, for example, on a 
date. In younger adolescent victims, 
the assailant is more likely to be a 
member of the adolescent’s extended 
family. 
12 In a national study of 
women and men who experienced 
sexual assault, approximately 45% 
of women and 29% of men reported 
that the assault was from an intimate 
partner; women, however, were 
more likely than men to be assaulted 
by an acquaintance. 
12, 
13
The majority of perpetrators of 
reported sexual assaults are male, 
regardless of the sex of the victim. 
12 
Studies of sexual assault of males 
have demonstrated that up to 90% of 
the perpetrators of rape are male. 
12 
Sexual assault of males by females 
is more commonly reported by 
older adolescents or young adults, 
as compared with sexual assault of 
children or young adolescents. 
14 
–16
The circumstances surrounding 
sexual assaults and subsequent 
reporting patterns differ when 
the victim is an adolescent 
versus an adult. Adolescent rape 
victims presenting to emergency 
departments are more likely than 
adult victims to have used alcohol 
or drugs and are less likely to incur 
nonanogenital injury during a 
rape. 
3, 
 
11, 
 
12, 
 
17 Adolescent female 
victims are also more likely to delay 
seeking medical care after a sexual 
assault and are less likely than are 
adult women to press charges when 
given a choice.11, 
 
17
Although sexual assault is a common 
occurrence among college and high-
school students, only approximately 
half of high school victims ever tell 
someone about an incident. 
18 As few 
as 10% of sexual assaults may be 
reported to authorities, depending 
on the age and sex of the victim and 
the circumstances surrounding the 
assault. When the victim knows the 
perpetrator, reports to the police 
are less frequent. 
19 In addition, 
male victims are less likely to report 
a sexual assault than are female 
victims. 
14 
–16
SUBSTANCE USE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
Adults significantly underreport 
voluntary drug use associated with 
sexual assault, but adolescents have 
demonstrated increased disclosure. 
20 
Alcohol or drug use immediately 
preceding sexual assault has been 
reported among more than 40% of 
adolescent victims and adolescent 
perpetrators 
15 and in approximately 
30% of sexual assaults reported by 
undergraduate females. 
21 Cannabis, 
which may be identified in urine 
samples days or weeks after its 
use, has been found in 17% to 35% 
of systematically collected urine 
samples of alleged victims of sexual 
assault. 
22, 
23 Recreational drug use is 
common in adolescents and young 
adults 
24 
– 
26; perpetrators of sexual 
assault may take advantage of the 
impaired state of a nonconsensual 
person who has voluntarily used 
alcohol or drugs. Substances can also 
be used inadvertently or coercively 
for sedation, to decrease inhibition, 
or to increase libido. Individual state 
laws generally define the crime as 
sexual activity with an individual 
who has been coerced or who has 
limited decision-making capacity 
because of intoxication or cognitive 
limitations and is unable to consent. 
27
Collection of Toxicology Samples
The revised National Protocol for 
Sexual Assault Medical Forensic 
Examinations and other published 
reviews have underscored the 
widespread use of alcohol and other 
substances that facilitate sexual 
assault and the importance of timely 
collection of toxicology samples to 
document such use. Collection of 
toxicology samples usually occurs 
separately from collection of physical 
forensic evidence. Toxicology sample 
collection is recommended when

the victim presents with symptoms 
and signs of substance use (eg, 
fluctuating level of consciousness, 
physiologic instability, severe 
intoxication, amnesia of the event) 
or when concerns of possible drug 
involvement are raised by the patient 
or the accompanying persons or 
witnesses. It is important to obtain 
informed consent before toxicology 
sample collection, if possible. 
28 
Informed consent can address 
issues related to confidentiality 
and discoverability of forensic and 
medical toxicology results, the value 
of results for immediate medical care, 
the influence of timing of specimen 
collection in the results reported, the 
limitations of toxicology to identify 
some drugs, and the responsibility 
for payment. When patients have 
ingested a psychoactive substance, 
confirmation of the details of the 
alleged crime committed may need 
to be reviewed at a later time with 
patients because of their temporarily 
compromised cognition or memory. 
An altered state of consciousness 
can complicate the emotional 
and physical trauma and make an 
evaluation even more challenging.
Both forensic and toxicology sample 
collection should occur in a timely 
manner and in parallel. In some 
instances, previously collected 
samples may be allowed to be 
discarded at a later time or date. 
Poison Control Centers, vendor 
laboratories, and other toxicology 
resources can be consulted to 
ensure that specimens are collected 
and transported correctly. If drug-
facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) is 
suspected, even if the suspected drug 
may be alcohol, it is ideal to collect 
the first urine produced after the 
assault, if possible. It is encouraged 
that the collection and transport of 
specimens be coordinated by sexual 
assault response teams, health care 
providers, and law enforcement 
personnel. Documentation of the 
chain of custody of any specimens 
is necessary if the sample is to 
be used in a legal proceeding. To 
best preserve and minimize the 
disturbance of forensic evidence 
from the genitalia and surrounding 
areas of the body, it is suggested 
that urination be delayed until other 
specimens are collected. However, 
this approach may not be possible 
and could delay the collection of 
toxicologic evidence.
Use of Substances
Voluntary use of alcohol or other 
drugs proximate to a sexual assault 
is common and should not influence 
the perceived legal status of the 
event or result in reductions in 
standards of care for presenting 
victims. Documentation of substance 
use history may be used by 
opposing attorneys to undermine 
the credibility of a victim in court, 
but may also be used to support 
the victim’s vulnerability and 
inability to provide legal consent. 
The examining physician should 
attempt to accurately document 
substance use history relevant to 
the event. Victims may also “self-
medicate” after an assault as a 
coping mechanism, especially if 
they have previously experienced 
a sexual assault. Impairment may 
influence a victim’s ability to make 
decisions about interacting with 
law enforcement professionals 
and consenting to the collection 
of forensic evidence. Examiners 
should consider developing policies 
regarding handling patients with an 
altered mental status. At a minimum, 
if serious medical problems are 
ruled out, the patient will need 
to be observed until consent and 
cooperation can be obtained, 
which will delay the start of the 
examination. 
28 Use of substances is 
one of the factors that may interfere 
with the reporting and prosecution of 
cases of sexual assault.
Although alcohol is the most common 
substance involved in sexual assault, 
DFSA has been a subject of attention 
since the 1990s, when increasing 
rates of adolescent acquaintance 
rape were allegedly associated with 
the availability of illegal so-called 
“date rape drugs.” 
29 
 
– 
32 The most 
well-known of these drugs is the 
benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic 
flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, Roche 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc, manufactured 
outside of the United States). 
Ketamine and γ-hydroxybutyrate 
(GHB) are also used as date rape 
drugs.33 GHB is more commonly used 
than flunitrazepam in DFSA because 
it is less expensive and more easily 
obtained. Use of any benzodiazepines 
with alcohol is known to amplify 
the actions and adverse effects 
of each individual substance. 
Studies of specimens collected 
when DFSA has been suspected 
have confirmed the presence of 
substances in 61% of urine samples 
tested after an alleged sexual 
assault. Testing from 3303 samples 
found occasional confirmation of 
flunitrazepam (0.33%) and GHB 
(3.0%) use and higher levels of other 
benzodiazepines (9.5%). Cocaine 
(18.6%), amphetamines (6.7%), and 
cannabis (18.6%) were also found 
with high frequency, and alcohol 
was detected in the urine of 41.1% 
of all samples. 
34 Most of these data 
were from studies in adults, but a 
few included older adolescents. In 
a Canadian study by Du Mont et 
al of 184 individuals 16 years and 
older who met the criteria for DFSA, 
86% had consumed alcohol before 
the assault, and one-quarter of the 
sample had used over-the-counter 
prescription or street drugs in the 72 
hours before the test collection. 
35, 
 
36 
Unexpected (ie, no known history 
of drug exposure to the specific 
drug) positive toxicology results 
were found in 49% of the suspected 
DFSA cases; results showed 
cannabinoids (40%) and cocaine 
(32%) most frequently. Similar 
individual studies and systematic 
reviews 
37 from the United States, 
Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, 
and other countries have reported 
that less than 2% of cases of DFSA 
e3

are associated with common date 
rape drugs.34 
– 
36, 
 
38 
 
 
– 
43 There may 
be a greater index of suspicion for 
such use in geographic areas where 
flunitrazepam and similar drugs are 
legal or more accessible (eg, Mexico 
and near border areas).
Testing for Date Rape Drugs
Date rape drugs and many other 
drugs of abuse are not included in 
standard drug-screening panels; 
flunitrazepam is not identified in 
routine tests for benzodiazepines. 
Health care providers are advised to 
inquire how to detect the presence 
of suspected drugs and collect the 
proper specimens from the victim 
at the time of evaluation. Commonly 
prescribed benzodiazepines and 
over-the-counter antihistamines 
are also being used to facilitate 
sexual assault, so testing can also be 
considered for these medications 
when their use is suspected. 
44
All of these drugs are detectable 
for only a short time. If there is 
suspicion that one of them has been 
used, toxicology screening should 
be performed as soon as possible, 
perhaps even before finishing the 
history and physical examination. 
The reference concentrations of these 
drugs are not universally available, 
and consultation with a sexual 
assault center, toxicologist, or state 
forensic laboratory may be required 
for interpretation of drug testing 
results. Toxicology screens for drugs 
of abuse generally are inadmissible 
in legal settings because false-
positive and false-negative results 
may occur. If a general toxicology 
screen performed to assess for 
the possibility of an exposure has 
a positive result, the same sample 
should also be sent for confirmatory 
testing by using gas chromatography 
or mass spectroscopy.
Substances Increase Vulnerability
Alcohol still is by far the most 
common date rape drug, and it is 
advisable to warn adolescents and 
college students of their increased 
vulnerability to assault when 
drinking. 
21, 
 
31, 
 
45 
– 
48 Sexual assault 
in which substance use is involved 
is likely to be more severe and is 
associated with assaults by strangers, 
greater physical injury, greater 
victimization, and greater likelihood 
of completed rape. 
45 If potential 
victims’ friends are also drinking, 
they may not notice that an assault 
is taking place or be able to respond 
in a way that maximizes safety and 
minimizes physical and psychological 
consequences. After a sexual assault, 
it is important to address how 
decreasing or avoiding future alcohol 
and substance use may decrease 
vulnerability to subsequent incidents. 
Such counseling may need to be 
deferred to a later time, depending 
on the condition and receptivity of 
the victim. 
47 
–49
SEXUAL ASSAULT OF YOUTH WITH 
DISABILITIES
Adolescents with developmental 
disabilities are at an increased risk 
of sexual assault and acquaintance 
rape. 
50, 
 
51 Between 2009 and 
2011, compared with adolescents 
without disabilities, adolescents 
with disabilities ages 12 to 15 years 
had rates of violent victimization 
that were 2.5 times greater, and 
those with disabilities ages 16 to 
19 years had rates that were more 
than 3 times greater. 
52 Lifetime 
sexual violence victimization 
was 3 times higher in males with 
disabilities compared with males 
without disabilities (13.9% vs 3.7%, 
respectively). 
53 It is estimated 
that 68% to 83% of women with 
developmental disabilities will be 
sexually assaulted in their lifetime.54 
Those who have milder cognitive 
disabilities are at the highest risk. 
55, 
 
56 
In a national sample of adult women, 
little difference in the risk of sexual 
assault was seen between women 
with moderate disabilities and those 
reporting no disability; women with 
severe disabilities were 4 times more 
likely to be sexually assaulted than 
women with no disabilities. 
57
People with disabilities are likely 
more vulnerable to sexual assault 
because of a variety of factors, 
including a decreased ability to flee 
or fight off an attacker, an expectation 
of increased compliance, an increased 
tolerance of physical intrusion, 
dependence on others for personal 
care, deficits in communication 
skills, and an inability to implement 
effective safeguards. 
55, 
 
58, 
 
59 As is the 
case for people without disabilities, 
victims with disabilities often know 
their perpetrators. Assailants were 
family members or acquaintances 
in 32% of cases involving victims 
with intellectual disabilities. An 
additional 44% of assailants had a 
care-providing relationship with the 
victim (eg, personal care attendants, 
transportation providers, or 
residential care staff). 
60
Only approximately 3% of sexual 
assault cases involving people 
with developmental disabilities 
typically have been reported to law 
enforcement. 
61 As many as 25% of 
girls and women with intellectual 
disabilities who were referred 
for contraception had a history 
of sexual violence, suggesting 
that screening for sexual assault 
could increase reporting in this 
population. 
62 Factors that influence 
whether people with disabilities 
report a sexual assault include the 
understanding and significance 
the victim attaches to the incident, 
the ability to communicate about 
what happened, whether the victim 
perceives there to be a trustworthy 
and capable person to whom the 
information may be disclosed, and 
the level of trust or expectation of 
being believed and feeling safe. 
56, 
 
63, 
64 
Some of these factors uniquely affect 
individuals with disabilities, but 
others are shared by individuals 
without disabilities as well.
It is strongly encouraged that 
pediatricians be familiar with child 
abuse resources and programs that

are appropriate for teenagers who 
are cognitively impaired. Service 
agencies can provide appropriate 
genital and pelvic examinations for 
victims with physical disabilities 
requiring mobility aids. Finally, it is 
helpful if pediatricians are aware of 
sexual violence prevention programs 
designed for participants with 
intellectual disabilities. 
64, 
 
65
ASKING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT
It is important that pediatricians have 
an increased awareness that sexual 
assault is a prevalent issue that can 
affect any of their patients, regardless 
of sex. During the high school 
and college years, a H.E.A.D.S.S. 
assessment can guide questions 
about the domains of Home, 
Education/Employment, Activities, 
Drugs, Sexuality, and Suicide/
Depression. Asking adolescents 
about exposure to sexual assault 
(and other types of victimization) 
is advised during routine health 
supervision visits in which 
psychological problems, sexuality 
issues, contraception, or substance 
use are discussed. Adolescents can 
be asked direct questions about their 
sexual experiences without their 
parents or partners present. These 
questions may include the age of 
their first sexual experience, use of 
the Internet and other social media 
to find romantic or sexual partners, 
and a history of unwanted or forced 
sexual acts. When exploring alcohol 
or substance use, it is important to 
discuss the link between impairment 
and vulnerability to sexual assault. 
It is advised that adolescents who 
disclose a previous assault be 
asked about the dynamics of their 
relationships (eg, exploitative, 
controlling, nonconsensual). 
66
Exploring the perceptions and 
attitudes of adolescents regarding 
nonconsensual sexual encounters is 
important. Because there may have 
been voluntary participation before 
an assault occurred, adolescents 
might think that “consent” cannot 
be withdrawn. They may worry 
that their perceptions of assault 
will not be validated or believed. 
Teenagers may be reluctant to report 
an incident for several reasons: 
feelings of responsibility or guilt for 
the event, the need to protect, worry 
about the response of their parents 
or other authorities, fear of negative 
consequences, or poor recollection 
of the assault because of the use 
of alcohol or other substances. 
Self-blame, humiliation, and lack 
of information, understanding, or 
knowledge about sexual violence may 
prevent an adolescent from seeking 
medical care.
SEXUAL ASSAULT REPORTING
Specific reporting requirements for 
parents, child protective services, 
or law enforcement vary by state or 
even local jurisdictions. Some states 
have laws mandating that sexual 
intercourse or other sexual contact 
between minors must be reported 
if certain age differences exist 
between a minor (usually defined 
as younger than 18 years) and his 
or her sex partner (whether minor 
or adult), even if the sexual act was 
voluntary and consensual. The age 
of consent for sex varies from state 
to state. Depending on the patient’s 
current age, age at time of the event, 
the identity and relationship to the 
alleged perpetrator (such as an 
acquaintance, a relative, teacher/
coach, or health care provider), 
it may be mandatory to report 
the event to law enforcement or 
child protective services even if 
the teenager does not want it to 
be reported. 
67 Some adolescents 
may refuse to seek care or disclose 
personal information because 
reporting of sexual partners or 
incidents of sexual violence may be 
required. 
68 
 
–71 Pediatricians need to 
know about the specific reporting 
laws in the states in which they 
practice. This information is available 
online through the Child Welfare 
Information Gateway. 
72
SEXUAL ASSAULT EVALUATION
When an adolescent discloses that 
an acute sexual assault has occurred, 
it is incumbent on the health care 
provider to provide a nonjudgmental 
response. A supportive environment 
may encourage the adolescent to 
provide a clear history of what 
happened, agree to a timely medical 
and/or forensic evaluation, and 
engage in counseling and education 
to address the sequelae of the event 
and to help prevent future sexual 
violence.
It is important to obtain the 
history of what happened from the 
adolescent, when possible. As in 
any other medical encounters, the 
physician should learn about relevant 
past medical and social history. 
Physicians should consider the 
possibility that the adolescent could 
be a victim of human trafficking and 
commercial sexual exploitation and 
ask appropriate questions, such as 
“Has anyone ever asked you to have 
sex in exchange for something you 
wanted?” 
66 In addition, the physician 
should address the physical, 
psychological, and safety needs 
of the adolescent victim of sexual 
violence and be aware that responses 
to sexual assault can vary. It is 
advised that adolescents be asked 
directly whether they have safety 
concerns related to the perpetrator, 
the perpetrators’ friends, or others. 
Victims should be asked whether 
they have been threatened, whether 
they are afraid of anyone, and 
whether the perpetrator or the 
perpetrator’s friends have a history 
of violence and access to weapons.
Most adolescents who disclose an 
acute sexual assault will consent 
to a physical evaluation that has a 
forensic component. The forensic 
elements of an evaluation are 
those that pertain to the criminal 
investigation that occurs after 
e5

www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
an assault is disclosed to law 
enforcement officers (eg, DNA 
collection). The adolescent should 
have a medical examination that 
assesses and cares for any injury, 
infections, and pregnancy in addition 
to addressing mental health and 
safety issues. It is of paramount 
importance that patients know they 
can and will still get the medical 
care they need related to the assault 
even if they choose not to have a 
forensic evaluation. In cases in which 
reporting is not mandatory, patients 
can be advised that a forensic 
evaluation does not require the 
victim to agree to report or press 
charges against the perpetrator. 
Many law enforcement agencies will 
hold forensic results for 2 or more 
years, allowing victims to reconsider 
legal action after the acute period has 
passed.
A referral for forensic examination 
and treatment can be made to an 
emergency department or sexual 
assault treatment center that has 
professional staff experienced in 
treating adolescent assault victims. 
It is important to note that the young 
person may have nongenital injuries, 
the treatment of which may be a 
priority, depending on their severity. 
The health care provider should 
address the adolescent’s immediate 
health concerns, including any acute 
injuries, the likelihood of exposure 
to sexually transmitted infection 
(STIs), the possibility of pregnancy, 
and other physical or mental health 
concerns. Before any forensic 
examination, victims of acute sexual 
assault should be asked to not change 
their clothes, bathe/shower, eat/
drink, urinate/defecate, or douche 
until they have been examined; 
however, even if they have done so, 
they are still encouraged to seek care. 
The federal Violence Against Women 
Act (Pub L No. 103–322 [1994]) 
requires that adolescents be given 
the option of having a sexual forensic 
medical examination even if they are 
uncertain about cooperating with 
law enforcement at the time of the 
examination.
A forensic examination is ideally 
performed by the most qualified 
health care provider available, 
such as a pediatric emergency 
medicine physician, a physician who 
specializes in child abuse, or a nurse 
practitioner with sexual assault care 
training who is working with an 
experienced physician. A properly 
maintained chain of evidence 
and accurate documentation of 
findings are critical. 
28, 
 
73 
 
– 
77 Details 
of the required examination and 
documentation are presented in a 
handbook published by the American 
College of Emergency Physicians, 
Evaluation and Management of 
the Sexually Assaulted or Sexually 
Abused Patient. 
28, 
 
77 Physicians who 
treat sexually abused or assaulted 
patients need to be aware of the 
legal requirements of their state or 
locality, including the completion 
of appropriate forms, maintaining 
the legal chain of evidence, and 
reporting to the appropriate local 
authorities. In many communities, a 
specific medical facility is designated 
as the location in which forensic 
examinations are performed, with 
specific policies and protocols 
in place to address the needs of 
these patients. Physicians should 
familiarize themselves with the 
resources and the protocols of the 
communities in which they practice 
so that they can refer their patients to 
the appropriate site.
A forensic medical examination 
includes a medical history, 
documentation of physical findings, 
use of an imaging system (still or 
video) to record findings and allow 
for future image review, collection 
of potential forensic evidence from 
the patient, and consideration 
of medications to address issues 
of possible STI transmission or 
pregnancy risk. 
28 With DNA-
amplification techniques, a forensic 
examination may identify foreign 
DNA for at least 72 hours after an 
assault 
28, 
 
78, 
 
79 and possibly longer.28, 
 
75 
If the adolescent presents more than 
3 days after the reported assault, 
health care providers should refer 
to their local protocols regarding 
evidence collection. After 1 week, 
examination, counseling, and 
treatment can take place without the 
need for forensic collection.
Forensic medical sexual assault 
examinations can be performed only 
with the consent of the adolescent. 
Law enforcement or parents cannot 
“mandate” that an adolescent have a 
forensic sexual assault examination. 
Adolescents must never be forced 
or coerced to have a forensic sexual 
assault evaluation. The age at which 
a patient has the ability to consent 
legally to a forensic medical sexual 
assault examination varies from state 
to state; a list that outlines sexual 
assault care by state is available from 
the Center for Adolescent Health and 
the Law. 
80 Pediatricians are advised 
to become familiar with their state’s 
laws.
The sexual assault history should 
be documented and should include 
verbatim statements whenever 
possible, important past medical and 
mental health history, and other areas 
of risk. The physical examination 
should include a written description 
of the findings and detailed 
drawings as well as photographic 
or video images whenever feasible. 
Descriptions of findings should be 
as clear and precise as possible. 
Examiners should avoid terms, such 
as “hymen intact” or “hymen not 
intact, 
” but instead use language that 
objectively describes the appearance 
of the anatomy. Colposcopy or 
another appropriate imaging system 
may assist examiners in detecting and 
documenting anogenital trauma. 
81 
– 
83 
Adolescents have appreciated that 
video colposcopy allowed them to 
watch their own examination on 
an adjacent screen.

forensic medical sexual assault 
examinations should be reviewed 
by the most experienced health

care provider who can interpret the 
findings. The majority of adolescents 
who have been sexually assaulted 
will have an unremarkable anogenital 
examination when they are examined 
acutely. After the acute period, it 
is even less common to find any 
clear evidence of previous genital 
trauma.85 
 
– 
88
Examiners are often asked to assess 
whether the findings identified are 
“consistent with” or “inconsistent 
with” the history of assault as 
provided by the adolescent. Physical 
injury to anogenital structures 
can be caused by both consensual 
and nonconsensual sexual activity. 
Alternatively, consensual as well 
as nonconsensual sexual activity 
may result in no physical injury to 
anogenital structures. An examiner 
may be able to offer an assessment 
that the physical findings are 
consistent with “penetrating sexual 
activity, 
” but may not be able to 
determine independently whether 
the physical findings observed 
were caused by consensual or 
nonconsensual sexual activity. 
Taking a history of whether recent 
sexual contact occurred in addition 
to the reported assault is helpful so 
that the physical findings identified 
during the evaluation can be 
interpreted in the correct context. If 
more than 1 individual reportedly 
engaged in penetrating sexual acts 
with the adolescent, it is generally 
not possible for the examiner to 
determine who caused a specific 
injury. Clinical records generated 
in the context of care provided 
to adolescents who present after 
disclosure of an acute sexual assault 
are routinely subpoenaed and 
reviewed by investigators as well 
as attorneys involved in a possible 
criminal prosecution.
MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT
Reactions that adolescents display 
after sexual assault can include 
feeling that their trust has been 
violated, increased self-blame, 
negative self-concept, and anxiety. 
Adolescent victims may feel that 
their actions contributed to the 
act of rape and can be confused 
as to whether the incident was 
forced or consensual. 
89 
– 
91 Studies 
of adolescent girls have found that 
rape during childhood is associated 
with a variety of risky behaviors, 
such as a younger age for the first 
voluntary intercourse; poor use of 
contraception; a greater number of 
pregnancies and abortions; higher 
rates of STIs; and increased risks 
of victimization by older partners. 
Increases are also noted in mental 
health problems, including higher 
rates of depression, suicidal ideation 
and suicide attempts, and other 
self-harm behaviors, such as self-
mutilation and eating disorders, 
among sexual assault victims. 
73, 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
–102 
A history of sexual assault or 
abuse may also be associated with 
psychiatric or behavioral problems 
that are more common in the 
opposite sex, such as eating disorders 
in boys and fighting in girls. 
96
All adolescent victims of sexual abuse 
should be asked about symptoms that 
would warrant a formal psychiatric 
assessment, such as suicidal or 
homicidal ideation or other self-
harm behavior. If, for some reason, 
the pediatrician is not comfortable 
performing such an inquiry, he or she 
should refer the patient to a health 
care provider who is comfortable 
with such assessments and who can 
evaluate the patient immediately. 
Evidence of suicidal or homicidal 
ideation should be attended to 
immediately in conjunction with 
an experienced mental health 
professional.
The adolescent may be encouraged to 
share information with a supportive 
caregiver, counselor, or other 
qualified and trusted adult. Although 
adolescents may desire (and be 
legally entitled to) confidentiality, 
support from a qualified and capable 
adult can be valuable, especially 
when teenagers are being treated in 
unfamiliar emergency department 
environments. Involving a support 
professional also may improve 
adolescents’ compliance with 
follow-up recommendations. The 
support professional also can serve to 
address concerns or issues expressed 
or presented by family members. 
A supportive parent/caregiver may 
also be enlisted and educated to 
monitor for and recognize symptoms 
or problems that develop after the 
acute care is provided. Parents can 
be counseled and encouraged to 
facilitate access to resources that can 
support their and their teenagers’ 
mental and physical health needs 
and not blame themselves or their 
teenager for the unfortunate event.
Because the risk of suicide may be 
high after assault, 
 
103 counseling 
parents to reduce potential access 
to lethal means of suicide, such as 
available medications or weapons, 
is advised. Research evidence has 
demonstrated that limiting access 
to firearms reduces the risk of death 
by suicide, so parents need to be 
counseled clearly to remove all 
firearms from the home, and, if that is 
not possible, to advise that weapons 
are stored, locked, unloaded, and 
inaccessible to the adolescent. 
104
MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY AND STI 
RISK AFTER SEXUAL ASSAULT
Treatment guidelines for STIs from 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) 
79 include 
recommendations for comprehensive 
clinical treatment of victims of 
sexual assault, including emergency 
contraception and HIV prophylaxis. 
Sexual assault is associated with a 
risk of pregnancy; 1 study reported 
a national pregnancy rate of 5% per 
rape among females 12 to 45 years 
of age. 
105 
 
– 
109 Pregnancy prevention 
and emergency contraception should 
be addressed with every adolescent 
female, including rape and sexual

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
assault victims. The discussion can 
include the risks of failure of the 
preventive measures and options for 
pregnancy management. It is advised 
that a baseline urine pregnancy 
test be performed. Emergency 
contraception should be offered to 
females who have been (or may have 
been) vaginally penetrated or who 
think that ejaculate has come into 
contact with their genitalia. 
28, 
 
73, 
 
75– 
77, 
 
79 
Emergency contraception should 
be offered within 120 hours of the 
sexual assault. The AAP outlines the 
recommended medication doses and 
guidelines in its policy statement, 
“Emergency Contraception.” 
110
The most common STIs reported 
in sexual assault victims are those 
that are common in the population 
and include Chlamydia, gonorrhea, 
and trichomoniasis. 
79, 
 
111 The best 
approach to collecting specimens 
for STIs immediately after a sexual 
assault is debated. A speculum 
examination may be traumatic, 
especially for a teenager who has 
not had one before and may lead to 
avoidance of reproductive health 
care in the future. Therefore, nucleic 
acid–amplification tests (NAATs) 
that use urine or vaginal specimens 
for gonorrhea and Chlamydia are 
preferred to cervical specimens 
for STI testing in females. 
79, 
 
112 For 
trichomoniasis, a NAAT vaginal 
specimen is recommended. Urine 
NAAT testing is also recommended 
for males, but additional testing at 
penetration sites, such as the anus, 
may be indicated.
Specimen collection for STIs should 
be discussed with the adolescent, and 
testing should be performed with the 
adolescent’s consent. Positive results 
may indicate an existing infection 
and may be a result of previous 
consensual sexual contact. NAATs 
(or cultures) also may be positive 
as a result of an assault, even when 
collected within 72 hours of the 
event. 
113 
– 
115 All 50 states have laws 
strictly limiting the use of a victim’s 
previous sexual or infection history 
to undermine the credibility of the 
adolescent’s history of assault. 
79
If specimens are to be collected, the 
decision about which specific test is 
preferred may vary by state. Both 
NAATs as well as culture typically 
are accepted by courts. The use of 
NAATs is preferable to cultures to 
detect Chlamydia and gonorrhea 
because the high sensitivity makes 
it more likely to detect DNA before 
the end of the incubation period. 
116 
The CDC guidelines also recommend 
NAATs from vaginal specimens 
for trichomoniasis. Consequently, 
NAATs are preferred for diagnostic 
evaluation of sexual assault victims, 
even if the site of penetration 
or attempted penetration is not 
vaginal. 
79 Vaginal secretions may 
be microscopically examined by 
wet mount for evidence of bacterial 
vaginosis and candidiasis if vaginal 
discharge, itching, or odor exists. 
79
CDC recommendations for sexual 
assault prophylaxis can be found at

sexual- 
assault. 
htm. 
 
 
79 Empirical treatment 
of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and 
trichomoniasis is recommended. If 
there is a history of alcohol ingestion 
or if emergency contraception is to 
be given, metronidazole or tinidazole 
for trichomoniasis can be provided 
to be taken later at home to minimize 
drug interactions and potential 
gastrointestinal adverse effects.
Repeat STI testing after prophylaxis 
can be offered as indicated. Sexually 
active adolescents should be 
counseled to abstain from sexual 
intercourse until STI prophylactic 
treatment is completed. If there is 
no prophylaxis prescribed, then 
adolescents may be counseled on 
the symptoms of STIs, and testing is 
recommended 1 to 2 weeks after the 
assault. Unfortunately, compliance 
with follow-up typically is poor. 
116 
Many adolescents will not recall 
everything said during a sexual 
assault evaluation, so it is suggested 
that instructions be provided in 
writing for later reference.
Serum samples should be obtained 
for baseline testing for hepatitis B, 
hepatitis C, syphilis, and 
HIV. 
28, 
 
74, 
 
75, 
 
77, 
79 Teenagers who 
have not initiated or completed 
immunization against hepatitis B 
virus can be offered the hepatitis B 
vaccine. Although there are currently 
no CDC recommendations regarding 
immunization against human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infections in 
the context of an acute sexual assault, 
the AAP recommends initiating the 
HPV series at 9 years of age and 
older or continuing/completing the 
series if all 3 doses have not been 
received. 
79, 
 
117 Completion of the 
series can be coordinated with the 
primary care provider, if possible.
Although HIV transmission has 
occurred from a single episode of 
sexual assault, the frequency of 
transmission is low, given that the risk 
of HIV transmission in consensual 
sex is 0.1% to 0.2% for vaginal and 
0.5% to 3% for receptive anal 
intercourse. 
79, 
 
118, 
 
119 HIV prophylaxis 
should be considered and 
recommended as per the HIV 
postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) 
guidelines from the CDC when there is 
genital or anal penetration with known 
ejaculation, especially if trauma 
occurred or if the patient has a known 
genital infection. The risks and benefits 
of HIV PEP should be considered. If 
HIV PEP is started, it is recommended 
that it begin as quickly as possible. 
Factors that may indicate a higher 
risk of HIV infection include chronic 
sexual abuse, multiple perpetrators, 
HIV-positive perpetrator(s), a high 
prevalence of HIV in the geographic 
area in which the sexual assault 
occurred, and a perpetrator with a 
genital lesion. 
74, 
75, 
 
77, 
 
79, 
 
120, 
 
121 The 
CDC recommends the following 
assessment for PEP within 72 hours 
of sexual assault79:
 
• Assess the risk of HIV infection in 
the alleged assailant.
 
• Evaluate the characteristics of the 
assault that might increase the risk 
of transmission.

• Consult with a specialist in HIV 
treatment.
 
• Discuss antiretroviral prophylaxis, 
including the risks of toxicity and 
the lack of proven benefit.
 
• Perform baseline complete blood 
cell count, serum chemistry, and 
HIV testing.
 
• Provide enough medication to last 
3 to 7 days until the patient returns 
for assessment of tolerance.
FOLLOW-UP CARE
Because patients treated in 
emergency departments often do 
not return for follow-up care, 
 
122 the 
emergency treatment team may refer 
an adolescent victim to his or her 
medical home as well as a specialty 
treatment center, if available in 
the community. The provision of 
information related to the evaluation 
to the primary health care provider 
or medical home can potentially 
improve follow-up. Although 
such communication generally is 
permitted under federal regulations 
(Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act [Pub L No. 104–
191 (1996)]), ethical and privacy 
considerations as well as some states’ 
confidentiality laws indicate that 
the treating physician should secure 
the consent of the adolescent before 
communicating with the primary 
care provider or specialty 
center. 
123, 
 
124
Follow-up usually includes a visit 
within 1 to 2 weeks of the initial 
presentation to assess injuries 
and adherence to medications, 
determine the victim’s mental 
health functioning and need for any 
additional psychological counseling, 
and arrange for appropriate referrals, 
if needed. 
125 Reassessment for STIs 
may be needed depending on which 
medications were given at the time of 
the initial evaluation and/or whether 
the adolescent has had consensual 
sexual activity since the assault. 
114 
At 2 weeks, pregnancy testing can be 
performed.
The CDC recommends that syphilis 
and fourth-generation HIV testing be 
repeated at 4 to 6 weeks and at 
3 months, and only HIV testing at 
6 months after the assault if initial 
test results were negative and 
infection in the assailant could not 
be excluded. 
79, 
 
126 
 
– 
130 Health care 
providers should be prepared to 
complete the hepatitis B virus and 
HPV immunization series.
At follow-up, victims of sexual assault 
should be assessed for mental health 
sequelae, as they are at high risk of 
posttraumatic stress disorder and 
other posttrauma disorders. 
131 
A 4-item posttraumatic stress 
disorder screening tool assessing 
symptoms of startle, physiologic 
arousal, anger, and emotional 
numbness has been used with some 
success by gynecologists in adults 
ages 22 to 46 years. 
132 Counseling 
resources can address this problem 
as well as additional psychological 
trauma that may develop after date 
or acquaintance rape. Psychotropic 
medications may be required in some 
instances. It is helpful if the health 
care provider is knowledgeable about 
services available in the community 
that can address these problems and 
provide initial psychological support. 
RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest 
National Network, http:// 
centers. 
rainn. 
org) is an excellent resource for 
victims and health care providers.
Studies have shown that trauma-
focused cognitive behavioral therapy 
is useful to aid adolescents who have 
been sexually assaulted. 
133 A call or 
referral to a sexual assault care center 
may provide the names of mental 
health professionals experienced in 
this arena who can provide these 
services. Under some circumstances, 
funding may be available to pay 
for necessary tests and treatments 
through the Victims of Crime Act 
(Pub L No. 98–473 [1984]).
SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION
Research data demonstrate that 
sexual assault of adolescents often 
occurs in places in which adolescents 
commonly spend their time and is 
perpetrated by people with whom 
the teenager is familiar and may 
consider “safe.” Perpetrators and 
victims of sexual assault may be 
of any sex; therefore, prevention 
messages for adolescents need 
to be designed for both males 
and females. 
134 
– 
136 Adolescents 
also need to be able to identify 
and avoid high-risk situations, 
including attending parties or social 
activities with unknown people, 
meeting strangers with whom they 
have had contact on the Internet, 
walking alone at night, allowing 
themselves to be photographed 
nude or in sexually explicit poses 
or situations, or sexting. Teenagers 
should be advised that if they ever 
are assaulted, they should seek 
medical care immediately. Factors 
that may increase the likelihood 
of assaults (eg, use of drugs or 
alcohol) and strategies to prevent 
sexual assaults (eg, “buddying up, 
” 
not drinking from a vessel that has 
been left unattended, abstaining 
from or moderating alcohol intake, 
and not accepting drinks from 
strangers) can be discussed, and 
associated educational materials can 
be made available and distributed 
by pediatricians, particularly during 
the adolescent years and at the 
precollege visit. 
134– 
136 College health 
professionals, including physicians, 
nurses, and health educators, along 
with specialists in student services/
student affairs, can also work with 
at-risk communities in university 
settings (eg, athletics, housing, 
freshmen organizations, Greek life) to 
provide education and resources to 
reduce the risks of sexual violence on 
and beyond campus.
Unfortunately, few effective 
strategies for the prevention of 
perpetration of sexual violence have 
been identified through rigorous 
e9

Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
research. Current approaches 
include aggressive education 
about sexual violence that seeks to 
change attitudes, knowledge, and 
culture, but evidence to identify best 
practices that reduce sexual violence 
perpetration is minimal. 
137, 
 
138 A 
recent Cochrane review examined 
38 studies of educational or skills-
based interventions for preventing 
relationship and dating violence in 
adolescents and young adults. The 
results showed no evidence that the 
programs enhanced skills to prevent 
relationship violence or decreased 
relationship violence. Some of the 
programs did demonstrate improved 
understanding and knowledge 
about relationships after the 
intervention. 
139 Two educational 
interventions, the Safe Dates 
program 
140 and the building-level 
intervention of Shifting Boundaries, 
141 
are universal, school-based dating 
violence prevention programs 
that have shown some evidence 
of effectiveness in preventing 
relationship violence. Safe Dates 
includes a 10-session curriculum 
addressing attitudes, social norms, 
and healthy relationship skills; a 
45-minute student play about dating 
violence; and a poster contest. 
140 
Although its effects were modest, 
students in the intervention group 
were significantly less likely to be 
victims or perpetrators of sexual 
violence involving a dating partner 
4 years after participating in the 
Safe Dates program. 
142, 
 
143 The 
building-level intervention of Shifting 
Boundaries involves temporary 
school-based restraining orders, 
higher levels of adult presence in 
school areas identified as unsafe, 
and the use of posters to increase 
awareness and reporting of sexual 
violence to school personnel. 
Shifting Boundaries was effective 
in reducing the perpetration of 
sexual harassment and peer sexual 
violence as well as sexual violence 
victimization (but not perpetration) 
by a dating partner. 
141
Recently, there has been increased 
interest in developing bystander 
interventions to reduce sexual 
violence, particularly in university 
settings. 
144 A recent meta-analysis 
suggested that bystander approaches 
show promise in changing bystander 
attitudes and intervention behaviors, 
if not actual sexual violence 
perpetration. 
145 Two recent studies 
on college campuses have reported 
decreased rates of sexual violence 
perpetration after implementation 
of bystander interventions, 
 
146, 
 
147 
suggesting that these approaches 
warrant additional attention and 
evaluation.
CLINICAL GUIDANCE FOR 
PEDIATRICIANS
1. Pediatricians are encouraged 
to routinely ask adolescents, 
including those with disabilities, 
about a history of sexual violence, 
dating violence, and sexual 
assaults. All adolescents who 
disclose a sexual assault should 
be asked about commercial sexual 
exploitation. Identification of 
sexual assaults may help reduce 
the risk of such future events, 
reduce the stigma, and provide 
victims with appropriate medical, 
psychological, and supportive 
care.
2. Pediatricians should be aware 
of the current reporting 
requirements related to sexual 
assault and state laws ensuring 
the rights of adolescents to obtain 
medical care at sexual assault or 
rape crisis centers in their states.
3. Pediatricians should be 
knowledgeable about the specific 
resources available to respond to 
sexual assault and rape in their 
communities and when and where 
to refer adolescents for forensic 
medical examinations and sexual 
assault care as well as resources 
for teenagers with disabilities.
4. Pediatricians should be familiar 
with the CDC guidelines for care 
of survivors of sexual assault. 
If the pediatrician does not feel 
qualified to care for a patient in 
an acute situation, provisions 
should be made for the patient to 
be evaluated immediately by an 
appropriate experienced 
provider.
5. Appropriate STI screening, PEP, 
treatment, and follow-up should 
be provided per CDC guidelines, 
including referrals for acute and 
follow-up testing and care.
6. Emergency contraception 
should be offered to adolescent 
girl patients who disclose sexual 
assault if reported within 
120 hours of the assault. 
Emergency contraception’s 
safety record allows it to be 
offered even if the adolescent is 
not sure whether penetration 
occurred. Documentation of 
pregnancy status should occur at 
the time of the evaluation and at 
follow-up.
7. Health care providers are 
advised to consider the possibility 
that “date rape” drugs may have 
been used in the context of an 
assault.
8. Pediatricians should be prepared 
to offer emotional support, 
determine the need for counseling 
and/or urgent mental health 
interventions, and refer patients 
and their families for additional 
evaluation or mental health care. 
Pediatricians should be aware of 
services in the community that 
provide evaluation, management, 
and counseling for the adolescent 
patient who has been sexually 
assaulted.
9. Pediatricians should support 
evidence-based sexual violence 
prevention activities in local 
high schools, colleges, and 
communities. Pediatricians can 
work with educators and law 
enforcement professionals to 
enhance and expand programs to 
reduce sexual violence.
