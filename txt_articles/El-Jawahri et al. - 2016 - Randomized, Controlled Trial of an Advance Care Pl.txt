Key Words: heart failure ◼ quality 
of health care ◼ quality of life
Background: Conversations about goals of care and cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR)/intubation for patients with advanced heart failure can 
be difficult. This study examined the impact of a video decision support 
tool and patient checklist on advance care planning for patients with heart 
failure.
Methods: This was a multisite, randomized, controlled trial of a video-
assisted intervention and advance care planning checklist versus a 
verbal description in 246 patients ≥64 years of age with heart failure 
and an estimated likelihood of death of >50% within 2 years. Intervention 
participants received a verbal description for goals of care (life-prolonging 
care, limited care, and comfort care) and CPR/intubation plus a 6-minute 
video depicting the 3 levels of care, CPR/intubation, and an advance care 
planning checklist. Control subjects received only the verbal description. 
The primary analysis compared the proportion of patients preferring 
comfort care between study arms immediately after the intervention. 
Secondary outcomes were CPR/intubation preferences and knowledge (6-
item test; range, 0–6) after intervention.
results: In the intervention group, 27 (22%) chose life-prolonging care, 
31 (25%) chose limited care, 63 (51%) selected comfort care, and 2 (2%) 
were uncertain. In the control group, 50 (41%) chose life-prolonging care, 
27 (22%) selected limited care, 37 (30%) chose comfort care, and 8 (7%) 
were uncertain (P<0.001). Intervention participants (compared with control 
subjects) were more likely to forgo CPR (68% versus 35%; P<0.001) and 
intubation (77% versus 48%; P<0.001) and had higher mean knowledge 
scores (4.1 versus 3.0; P<0.001).
conclusions: Patients with heart failure who viewed a video were more 
informed, more likely to select a focus on comfort, and less likely to desire 
CPR/intubation compared with patients receiving verbal information only.

a
s a result of the prognostic uncertainty of heart fail-
ure and the multiple advanced therapies potentially 
available, it is difficult to know when the opportune 
time is to broach discussions about care preferences and 
future care options for patients with advanced heart fail-
ure.1 A recent consensus statement has suggested that 
patients have a discussion about overall goals of care an-
nually.2 However, it is still challenging even for the best-in-
tentioned clinician to know how to have these discussions. 
Despite major advances in lifesaving therapies, heart failure 
remains a highly morbid disease; patients with heart failure 
also have a much lower rate of use of end-of-life resources 
such as hospice.3
Advance care planning (ACP) is a process of shared 
decision making that informs and engages patients to 
ensure that the care delivered is concordant with their 
informed wishes.4 ACP is recognized as a standard for 
high-quality patient-centered care.4,5 Video decision sup-
port tools encourage ACP by stimulating informed con-
versations and helping people think about the choices 
they face.4,6 Video tools can help people envision future 
circumstances and deliberate about their decisions.4,7,8
Our group, the VIDEO Consortium (Video Images of 
Disease for Ethical Outcomes), has developed and evalu-
ated several decision support tools to assist patients with 
ACP.7–11 Our previous work in patients with cancer sug-
gests that video tools serve as catalysts to spark ACP 
conversations by informing patients about their options, 
leading to care decisions that are more aligned with 
patients’ preferences and values.7,9,10 Extending this re-
search to patients with heart failure is important given its 
high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality.12
We conducted a randomized trial of a goals-of-care 
video and ACP checklist among patients with advanced 
heart failure. Our primary hypothesis was that patients 
in the video-assisted intervention arm would be more 
likely to prefer medical care focused on quality of life and 
comfort compared with those who received only a verbal 
description of their options. Secondary hypotheses were 
that the video-assisted group would be less likely to want 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempted or to be 
placed on a ventilator, more knowledgeable about their 
options, more likely to have ACP conversations with their 
physicians, and more likely to prefer what their physicians 
would choose for themselves in such circumstances.
MethODs
setting
We conducted this study with 246 patients from 7 teaching 
hospitals: Massachusetts General Hospital (n=92), Newton-
Wellesley Hospital (n=49), University of Colorado Hospital 
(n=40), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (n=33), Boston 
Medical Center (n=18), Nashville Veterans Administration 
Medical Center (n=8), and Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center (n=6). Institutional Review Board approval was 
obtained at each hospital. Study participants provided written 
informed consent.
Participants
We enrolled 246 participants from June 28, 2012, to February 
7, 2015. Eligibility criteria included age ≥64 years, ability to 
provide informed consent, ability to communicate in English, 
and an established diagnosis of advanced heart failure with 
limited prognosis as defined by the criteria in Appendix A in the 
online-only Data Supplement. We excluded patients with a score 
of ≤6 on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire.13
Study recruitment, data collection, and intervention 
administration were done by trained research assistants 
(RAs: physicians or nurses) at each hospital. The RAs under-
went standardized training in all aspects of the research 
protocol, including use of structured scripts to administer 
the questionnaires.
RAs reviewed records of hospitalized and ambulatory 
patients with advanced heart failure to identify potential sub-
jects. Each patient’s attending physician was asked to confirm 
eligibility and to approve approaching the patient for participa-
tion. Eligible patients were invited to participate, and informed 
consent was obtained from those who agreed.
After obtaining informed consent, the RA administered the 
Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire to confirm final 
study eligibility. The RA administered a baseline questionnaire 
(demographics, self-reported health status, goals-of-care pref-
erences, CPR/intubation preferences, and knowledge ques-
tions), after which participants were randomized to either the 
video-assisted intervention or verbal control arm. We used a 
central, computer-generated 2:2 block randomization design 
stratified on the basis of use of an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator at each institution, with assignments concealed in 
numbered envelopes.
Video-assisted intervention arm
Participants randomized to the video-assisted intervention arm

clinical Perspective
What is new?
• A video decision aid for patients with advanced 
heart failure encouraged patients to have advance 
care planning conversations with their physicians. 
• Patients better informed about their goals-of-care 
options led to more patients desiring care focusing 
on comfort and avoiding CPR and intubation.
• The incidence of patient-doctor conversations 
increased.
What are the clinical implications?
• Advance care planning video decision aids stimulate 
and supplement patient-physician communication, 
enhance patients’ understanding of their goals-of-
care options, and ensure that patients receive care 
that reflects their well-informed wishes.

loud by the RA (Appendix B in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Then, participants viewed a 6-minute goals-of-care video for 
patients with advanced heart failure on an iPad in the presence 
of the RA. Intervention participants were also given a patient 
checklist (Appendix C in the online-only Data Supplement) 
reviewing ACP. The RA gave the patient checklists to patients 
at the end of the interview (after completion of the postinter-
vention questionnaire). The RAs were instructed to defer ques-
tions about the checklist and to encourage patients to discuss 
their questions with their physicians; notably, patients did not 
ask any questions about the checklist during the study.
We used standardized procedures to minimize interaction 
between RAs and patients while viewing the video. Specifically, 
RAs were not permitted to comment or answer questions while 
the patient viewed the video; participants were instructed to 
watch the video without interruption and had no further expo-
sure to the video.
The video begins with a physician introducing the patient to 
ACP and a 3-part goals-of-care framework (life-prolonging care, 
limited medical care, and comfort care), which was used and 
tested in previous studies.9,14 In the video, life-prolonging care 
images included a simulated code with clinicians conducting 
CPR and intubation on a mannequin; an intensive care unit with 
a ventilated patient being tended by respiratory therapists; and 
medications, including vasopressors, administered through a 
venous catheter. Visual images depicting limited medical care 
included a patient getting medications via a peripheral intrave-
nous catheter, scenes from a typical medical ward service, and 
a patient wearing a nasal cannula. The video depiction of com-
fort care included a patient receiving oral medications at home, 
a patient with a nasal cannula on oxygen at home, and a medi-
cal attendant assisting a patient with self-care. In its develop-
ment, the design, script, scenes, and structure of the video were 
reviewed for accuracy and appropriateness by experts in cardi-
ology, critical care, geriatrics, palliative care, decision making, 
health literacy, medical ethics, and patients with heart failure. 
The research team performed all filming and editing of the video 
before the development of this study protocol following previ-
ously published criteria.15 All providers and patients included in 
the video (or their proxies) gave consent to be filmed.
We obtained video-assisted intervention participants’ 
goals-of-care preferences, CPR/intubation preferences, and 
knowledge before randomization during the baseline interview 
(baseline questionnaire) and immediately after listening to the 
description of the goals of care and viewing the video (postint-
ervention questionnaire). Patients with questions after viewing 
the video were referred to their attending physician.
Verbal control arm
After randomization, participants in the verbal control arm 
listened to the same description of the 3 goals of care used 
in the video arm read out loud by the RA (Appendix B in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Participants in the control group 
did not watch the video or receive the ACP checklist. We used 
standardized procedures across sites to minimize interaction 
between RAs and patients during the interview. Specifically, RAs 
were not permitted to comment or answer questions while the 
patient listened to the verbal narrative or answered the inter-
view questions; control participants were instructed to ask their 
physicians any questions they may have about goals of care.
We obtained verbal control participants’ goals-of-care pref-
erences, CPR/intubation preferences, and knowledge before 
randomization during the baseline interview (baseline question-
naire) and then immediately after listening to the description of 
the goals of care (postintervention questionnaire). Patients with 
questions after hearing the verbal description were referred to 
their attending physician.
Data collection and Outcomes
The baseline questionnaire included the following self-reported 
variables: age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, marital status, 
religion, health status, goals-of-care preferences, CPR/intuba-
tion preferences, and knowledge of ACP options.
We categorized patients’ goals-of-care preferences as fol-
lows: life-prolonging care, limited medical care, comfort care, 
or unsure. We categorized patients’ CPR preferences as “yes, 
attempt CPR,” “no, do not attempt CPR,” or “not sure.” Similarly, 
we categorized intubation preferences as “yes, attempt intuba-
tion,” “no, do not attempt intubation,” or “not sure.”
We assessed patients’ knowledge of goals of care as in 
previous studies using 5 true/false questions and 1 multiple 
choice question, each worth 1 point, for a summary score of 
0 to 6 (higher score reflects greater knowledge; Appendix D in 
the online-only Data Supplement).7,9,10
In both arms, the postintervention questionnaire included 
the following self-reported variables: goals-of-care prefer-
ences, CPR/intubation preferences, and knowledge questions.
We also asked the attending physician for each participant 
to report what code status (full code, do not resuscitate, do 
not resuscitate and do not intubate, or do not hospitalize/
comfort only/hospice) they would prefer for themselves if they 
were in the patient’s situation (clinicians’ preferences).
We conducted follow-up interviews with participants over 
the phone at 1- and 3-month intervals after study enrollment. 
During the follow-up interviews, participants reported whether 
they had discussed goals of care with a clinician since the last 
study interview.
statistical analysis
All participants’ characteristics and outcomes were summa-
rized as frequency and percentage for categorical variables 
and mean±SD for continuous variables. The primary outcome 
was participants’ stated goals-of-care preferences after inter-
vention, defined as immediately after listening to the description 
of the goals of care for the verbal control arm and immediately 
after listening to the description of the goals of care and view-
ing the video for the video-assisted intervention arm.
We compared goals-of-care, CPR, and intubation prefer-
ences between the video-assisted intervention and verbal con-
trol arms using χ2 tests. We used a 2-sample t test to compare 
participants’ mean knowledge scores between the 2 arms. To 
compare the agreement between participants’ CPR and intu-
bation preferences with their clinicians’ code preferences, 16 
participants without documented clinician’s preference were 
excluded from the analysis. Participants who were uncertain 
about their preferences were considered to prefer CPR or intu-
bation for this analysis. We used the κ statistics to summa-
rize the agreement for each study arm. Lastly, we used Fisher 
exact tests to compare goals-of-care discussions (at 1- and

study Participants
A total of 682 patients were assessed for eligibility (Fig-
ure 1). Seventy-seven patients were excluded for clinical 
reasons because they did not meet eligibility criteria, 
124 patients were excluded on the basis of physician’s 
request, and 167 were excluded for other reasons (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement). We approached 
314 patients for study participation. Five patients failed 
the mental status examination, and 63 declined (20%).
Half of the 246 participants were randomized to the 
video-assisted intervention arm (n=123) and half to the 
verbal control arm (n=123). Participants were mostly 
white (85%) with a mean age of 81 years (SD=8 years), 
and 61% were male. Most participants (91%) had New 
York Heart Association class III disease, and 28% had an 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (Table).

27 (22%) preferred life-prolonging care, 31 (25%) 
preferred limited medical care, 63 (51%) preferred 
comfort care, and 2 (2%) were uncertain. In the verbal

preferred comfort care, and 8 (7%) were uncertain 
(P<0.001; Figure 2).
cPr and intubation Preferences
The proportions of participants in the video-assisted 
intervention and verbal control arms wanting to forgo 
CPR and intubation were similar at baseline (Table). After 
the intervention, more participants in the video-assisted 
intervention arm preferred to forgo CPR and intuba-

A majority of clinicians would choose to forgo CPR and 
intubation for themselves if they were in the patient’s situ-
ation (Figure 3). The concordance of clinicians’ and pa-
tients’ code preferences for CPR and intubation was high-
er in the video-assisted intervention arm (κ=0.13 for CPR 
and κ=0.14 for MV, respectively) than in the verbal control 
arm (κ=−0.05 for CPR and κ=0.06 for MV, respectively).

the verbal control arm. The follow-up rates were not signif-
icantly different between groups (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). At follow-up, participants randomized 
to the video-assisted intervention arm were more likely to 
report goals-of-care conversations with healthcare provid-
ers compared with verbal control participants at 1 month 
(40% versus 6%, respectively; P<0.001) and 3 months 
(61% versus 15%, respectively; P<0.001; Figure 4).
comfort With the Video
The video was highly acceptable to participants assigned 
the intervention. Among the 123 video-assisted interven-
tion participants, 97 (79%) were “very comfortable,” 24 
(20%) were “somewhat comfortable,” and 1 (1%) was “not 
comfortable” watching the video. When asked whether they 
would recommend the video to other patients, 101 (82%) 
would “definitely recommend,” 17 (14%) would “probably 
recommend,” and 4 (3%) would “not recommend” the video.
DiscussiOn
This study evaluates an innovative approach to inform-
ing and involving patients with advanced heart failure in 
decisions surrounding their care. Video-assisted inter-
vention patients were more knowledgeable about their 
care options, more likely to prefer medical care focused 
on quality of life and comfort, and more likely to prefer 
to forgo invasive interventions compared with patients 
in the verbal control group. Moreover, video-assisted in-
tervention patients were more likely to make decisions 
that were concordant with the decisions that physicians 
caring for them anticipated making for themselves in the 
same situation, and they were more likely to initiate ACP 
conversations with their providers.
This trial is an important step forward because heart 
disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and 
because ACP has been slow to come to this clinical 
arena.16,17 Patients’ underestimation of poor prognosis, 
clinicians’ lack of communication training, and clinicians’ 
uncertainty about the trajectory of heart failure partly ac-
count for the lack of ACP conversations.18–20 However, 
patients and families deserve to learn their options for 
goals of care and to be able to make decisions and com-
municate them to someone who can help them meet 
those goals. Our approach using video decision support 
tools offers a scalable solution to enhance these conver-
sations and ACP more broadly.
Videos help people foresee how they might feel about 
different health states, medical interventions, and the con-
sequences of different actions.21 Decision support tools 
such as that described here can empower and activate 
patients, providers, and health systems to ensure that pa-
tients receive medical care that is aligned with their prefer-
ences.22 Interestingly, when provided with a verbal narra-
tive alone, control patients in this study changed toward 
desiring more life-prolonging measures in terms of their 
goals of care, although this change was not statistically 
significant. It is plausible that at baseline before the verbal 
narrative, control patients did not have an understanding 
of this particular framework in terms of thinking about 
goals of care. Thus, their preferences after the verbal nar-
rative reflect their exposure to these preferences. Nota-
bly, fewer patients were unsure of their preferences after 
the verbal narrative or the video intervention.
In this study, the video tool improved patients’ under-
standing of their options, influenced their preferences, and 
served as a catalyst to actually having the conversation 
with their clinician, the rate-limiting step in patient-centered 
care.23 Activating patients with advanced heart failure to 
initiate ACP conversations with their providers alleviates 
provider unease and uncertainty about discussing ACP 
under circumstances of prognostic uncertainty. Our video-
assisted approach was designed to stimulate and supple-
ment, not supplant, the conversations that patients should 
have with their clinicians. We believe that the success of 
the intervention shows that patients can be empowered to 
engage clinicians in ACP, a focus of recent national guide-

sations with healthcare providers

strengthening discussions with providers who may not feel 
comfortable having these discussions otherwise.
Our study has several important limitations. First, 
data collectors were not blinded to the randomization. 
Although this may have introduced bias, previous ran-
domized studies in ACP have seldom been blinded to 
ease the burden on participants of addressing sensitive 
topics and because the nature of such interventions 
makes blinding challenging. Second, our study included 
predominantly white patients, limiting the generalizability 
of our findings. Third, in the intervention arm, patients 
viewed the video and received an ACP checklist. Although 
the checklist is considered an important component of 
the intervention to remind patients to discuss ACP with 
their clinicians, we do not believe that the checklist it-
self accounts for the differences in outcomes seen in 
this study. Notably, patients’ preferences and knowledge 
about CPR were assessed before they had a chance 
to review the checklist. Fourth, although the video-as-
sisted intervention led to more goals-of-care conversa-
tions between patients and providers, we do not have 
any information on documented ACP discussions such 
as advanced directives, do-not-resuscitate orders, or 
hospice use. Finally, visual media can be manipulated to 
favor a particular decision. We are quite sensitive to this 
concern and extensively vetted all aspects of the video 
with a range of stakeholders. Furthermore, the facts that 
participants had an overwhelmingly positive impression 
of the video (96% recommend) and that the video led to 
increased knowledge are reassuring.
As the Institute of Medicine recently pointed out, al-
though ACP and effective communication between pa-
tients and physicians are recognized as a standard for 
high-quality care, “achieving such a partnership is a chal-
lenge.”4 Medicare’s recent interest in billing mechanisms 
for reimbursement related to ACP is clearly an attempt 
to stimulate such conversations.24 Tools to empower 
patients and promote shared decision making related 
to ACP can help ensure that this time is well spent and 
may be required for payment. Video decision support 
tools provide a standardized and cost-effective means 
to address the immediate communication needs of our 
healthcare system and to ensure that patients receive 
care that reflects their well-informed wishes.
