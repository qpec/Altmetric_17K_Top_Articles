Abstract
Background: Current estimates suggest that approximately 75% of people approaching the end-of-life may benefit
from palliative care. The growing numbers of older people and increasing prevalence of chronic illness in many
countries mean that more people may benefit from palliative care in the future, but this has not been quantified.
The present study aims to estimate future population palliative care need in two high-income countries.
Methods: We used mortality statistics for England and Wales from 2006 to 2014. Building on previous diagnosis-based
approaches, we calculated age- and sex-specific proportions of deaths from defined chronic progressive illnesses to
estimate the prevalence of palliative care need in the population. We calculated annual change over the 9-year period.
Using explicit assumptions about change in disease prevalence over time, and official mortality forecasts, we
modelled palliative care need up to 2040. We also undertook separate projections for dementia, cancer and
organ failure.
Results: By 2040, annual deaths in England and Wales are projected to rise by 25.4% (from 501,424 in 2014 to 628,659).
If age- and sex-specific proportions with palliative care needs remain the same as in 2014, the number of people
requiring palliative care will grow by 25.0% (from 375,398 to 469,305 people/year). However, if the upward trend
observed from 2006 to 2014 continues, the increase will be of 42.4% (161,842 more people/year, total 537,240). In
addition, disease-specific projections show that dementia (increase from 59,199 to 219,409 deaths/year by 2040) and
cancer (increase from 143,638 to 208,636 deaths by 2040) will be the main drivers of increased need.
Conclusions: If recent mortality trends continue, 160,000 more people in England and Wales will need palliative care by
2040. Healthcare systems must now start to adapt to the age-related growth in deaths from chronic illness, by focusing
on integration and boosting of palliative care across health and social care disciplines. Countries with similar
demographic and disease changes will likely experience comparable rises in need.

Background
Many people approaching the end-of-life could benefit
from palliative care, which can be defined as a patient-
centred approach to care in advanced disease, focusing
on quality of life and relief of symptoms [1–6]. The way
in which palliative care is delivered depends on individ-
ual patient needs. Palliative care is frequently delivered
by non-specialists, for example, as advance care planning
in a primary care setting or symptom management in
secondary care. Specialist multidisciplinary palliative
care teams deliver care for more complex needs in a
variety of settings, including hospitals, hospices and in
the community, although they can also provide more
straightforward end-of-life care.
More palliative care support is likely to be required for
some illnesses and clinical syndromes, such as multi-
morbidity, chronic progressive illnesses with long disease
courses, and diseases with complex symptoms. This is

 important because, alongside demographic changes
[7, 8], the incidence, prevalence and mortality of chronic
illness is rising worldwide [8–10], with an increase in
long-term conditions and multimorbidity [9, 10].
Healthcare services will therefore need to adapt to
provide appropriate services for changing populations,
and this will require more resources, including for pallia-
tive and end-of-life care. Estimates of the cost of care in
the last year of life are consistently high [11–13], and in
England, these costs are expected to grow by 25% by
2030 [14].
However, despite the growth in drivers of palliative
care needs, access to palliative care remains inconsistent,
even in high-income countries, with the number of pro-
viders varying from 5 to 680 per million population [12].
Overall, only a minority who need palliative care, per-
haps as low as 14%, receive it [12, 15–17].
To improve access to palliative care, we must first
investigate and understand the level of need in the popu-
lation. A helpful definition of need is that of Stevens and
Raftery, who define healthcare need as the ‘ability to
benefit’ from healthcare services [18–20]. This definition
can be applied to individual health problems, and also to
population health. It is thus informative for epidemio-
logical research and health service planning.
Current population needs for palliative care have been
estimated in several countries using different methods
for its measurement [21, 22], based on patient diagnoses
[22–24], symptom prevalence [25] and population sur-
veys [5, 26]. Most of these methods produce broadly
similar results in terms of how many people are esti-
mated to need palliative care [5, 22, 24–26], although
additional data sources can increase sensitivity [22, 27].
However, in light of the major demographic and dis-
ease changes occurring and expected to occur globally,
we need to know more than the current level of pallia-
tive care need – we need to know how the healthcare
needs of people at the end of life will change over time
in order to plan healthcare services. Projections of pallia-
tive care need are therefore required to guide service
development. In this study, we aim to estimate the num-
bers and proportions of people at the end-of-life stage
who may benefit from palliative care, and project this
estimate of palliative care need onto future populations,
using two high-income countries, namely England and
Wales, as examples.
Methods
Design
Secondary analysis of routinely available national death
registry and population data (both provided by the
Office for National Statistics (ONS)) for England and
Wales. We estimated palliative care need for the time
period of 2006 to 2014 using two estimates, namely an
estimate of palliative care need at 75% of all deaths, and
an estimate based on a set of relevant causes of death.
We then projected these estimates of palliative care need
using official mortality forecasts to model estimates of
palliative care need up to 2040. We developed these
projections by investigating mortality in specific disease
groups, the effect of age and incorporating an estimate
of pain prevalence.
Data sources
Death registry data (2006–2014)
As part of their Deaths Registered series, the ONS re-
cords the ‘main’ cause of death for every death registered
in each calendar year in England and Wales using the in-
formation supplied on the death certificate. We used this
data to identify causes of death for inclusion in our pal-
liative care estimate. This approach has limitations, as it
relies on accurate death certification. However, evidence
suggests that, at a population level, cause of death
correlates well to known diagnoses [28]. The Deaths
Registered series uses an International Classification of
Disease (ICD)-10 code-based classification, which was
last updated in 2011 (Additional file 1) [29].
Anticipated population and mortality changes (2014–2040)
Population data are collected by the ONS using a mid-
year estimate on June 30. The 2014 data used in this
analysis is based on 2010 Census data with subsequent
annual adjustments. The ONS uses these population
data, along with assumptions about fertility, mortality
and migration, to develop population and mortality pro-
jections. Assumptions are based on long-term popula-
tion trends. For this analysis, we used the mortality
projections from the principal population projection for
England and Wales up to 2040. We limited our projec-
tion to 2040 because, after this, there is increased uncer-
tainty in mortality assumptions [7].
Mortality and projections data for England and Wales
are produced together using uniform methodology;
therefore, data for both countries can be easily com-
bined. More detail on technical aspects of combining
these datasets can be found in Additional file 1.
Estimates of current palliative care need
We used two estimates of palliative care need, both of
which are based on a proportion of population deaths as
palliative care needs are most evident at the end of life.
This has served as a reasonable proxy for population pal-
liative care need in previous population analyses [22, 24].
Estimate 1
The first estimate, based on population survey by
Gomez-Batiste et al. [26], assumes that approximately
75% of people in high-income countries die from
Etkind et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:102

 chronic progressive diseases with evolving and increas-
ing healthcare needs, and that, therefore, 75% of all
people
at
the
end-of-life
stage
may
benefit
from
specialist or non-specialist palliative care.
Estimate 2
The second estimate is calculated based on deaths from
specific chronic diseases. We chose a diagnosis-based
estimate because we hypothesised that changes in the
prevalence of chronic illnesses would be a key factor
affecting the level of need. For this estimate, we consid-
ered that people dying of chronic illnesses are very likely
to have complex physical, psychological, spiritual and/or
social problems that can be improved by either specialist
or non-specialist palliative care services. They therefore
have the ability to benefit from palliative care, and hence
have palliative care needs as per the Stevens and Raftery
definition [18, 19]. At a population level, palliative care
need can therefore be estimated as the proportion of
people who die from chronic diseases.
High quality, routinely collected data to support this
estimate are publicly available. We used ICD-10 diag-
nostic codes previously used to estimate population
palliative care need (Table 1) [21, 22], and defined a per-
son requiring palliative care as someone dying from an
illness with an included ICD-10 code [22]. We calculated
the percentage of deaths from these codes out of all
deaths in a calendar year, which gave our prevalence
estimate of palliative care need.
Projections of palliative care need estimates
Projection methodology
Projection method 1: We calculated palliative care need
estimate 1 according to 75% of deaths for the most
recent available year, 2014. We then applied this esti-
mate to ONS mortality projections up to 2040, assuming
the proportion of deaths requiring palliative care would
remain constant.
Projection method 2 (assuming proportion of palliative
care needs constant): We calculated palliative care need
estimates according to age- and sex-specific deaths from
included ICD-10 codes for 2014 (estimate 2), and
applied this estimate to mortality projections up to 2040,
assuming the proportion would remain constant as per
projection method 1.
Projection method 2 (assuming an annual change): It
is unlikely in reality that the prevalence of chronic dis-
ease, and hence the proportion of people dying in need
of palliative care, will remain constant over time. We
therefore refined projection method 2 to project a meas-
ure of annual change in palliative care need. Using the
ICD-10 code based cause-of-death estimate, we calcu-
lated the proportion of deaths with palliative care need
using the cause of death estimate, from 2006 to 2014.
We then calculated a mean annual change in the pro-
portion of deaths requiring palliative care over this base
period. We assumed the annual change would continue
to occur in a linear fashion, and applied the resulting
proportion to population forecasts up to 2040. To ac-
count for changes in coding of death registry data which
occurred in 2011 [29], we calculated mean annual
change based on two base periods (2006 to 2014 and
2011 to 2014). See Additional file 1 for further details.
Projecting palliative care need by age group and disease
group
Using projection method 2 (assuming annual change) as
a basis, we developed the projections to investigate pro-
jected changes in palliative care need in specific age and
disease groups. We first described the number of people
in each 5-year age group who are projected to need pal-
liative care between 2014 and 2040, and then undertook
disease group-specific projections.
For disease group-specific projections, we categorised
our ICD-10 codes into four groups, namely deaths from
cancer,
dementia,
organ
failure
(including
cardiac,
respiratory, renal and liver disease) and other included
diseases (neurological disease, stroke and HIV). We sep-
arated cerebrovascular disease and dementia to demon-
strate the impact of changes in dementia deaths.

 Incorporating pain prevalence
Symptom prevalence is key to palliative care need and
highlights the complexity of need. It has been accounted
for in assessments of population palliative care need
[25]. From a literature review, we identified estimates of
the prevalence of pain in the last year of life. Pain preva-
lence in cancer [25, 30–32], organ failure [31, 32],
dementia [33, 34] and neurological conditions [35] has
been estimated. Based on this, we applied pain preva-
lence estimates onto our disease group projections to
provide the estimated number of people dying from
included diseases who also suffered from pain.
Sensitivity analyses
We undertook sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness
of our methodology. Firstly, we adjusted for the time-
period over which death registry and mortality projections
data are collected and assessed the effect this had on our
projections. Secondly, we applied the Lee–Carter ap-
proach to mortality projections to produce an alternative
projection, and compared this to our main methodology
[36]. See Additional files 1, 2 and 3 for further details.
Ethical approval
Since this study used routinely collected anonymised,
publicly available data, no ethical approvals were needed.
Results
Estimates of palliative care need from 2006 to 2014
Between 2006 and 2014, the number of deaths in England
and Wales has remained relatively constant, changing from
502,599 to 501,424. In this time period, population pallia-
tive care need, based on the ICD-10 code estimate, has also
risen from 364,283 (72.5% of deaths) to 375,398 (74.9%;
mean annual change of 0.30%). Cancer deaths have in-
creased from 135,635 to 143,638; organ failure deaths
reduced from 145,604 to 129,338; dementia deaths in-
creased from 27,364 to 59,199; and other deaths re-
duced from 55,680 to 43,223. After the ICD-10 coding
change, from 2011 to 2014, palliative care need increased
from 357,251 (73.8%) to 375,398 (74.9%; mean annual
change 0.37%).
Anticipated population changes from 2014 to 2040
Population changes: According to ONS forecasts, the
population of England and Wales will grow by 9,443,000
between 2014 and 2040 (Table 2). The proportion of
people aged over 65 will increase from 17.7% to 24.2%.
These changes impact on the number of people ex-
pected to die in 2040. The ONS projects a rise in the
number of deaths from 501,424 in 2014 to 628,659 in
2040 (127,234 (25.4%) increase). Additionally, more
people are projected to die at an older age. The propor-
tion of people dying over the age of 85 will rise from
38.8% in 2014 to 53.2% in 2040. Our projections take
these changes into account (Table 3 and Fig. 1).
Projections of palliative care need from 2014 to 2040
Projection method 1: If the proportion of people who
die needing palliative care remains at 75.0% of all deaths,
471,494 people (95,426 more) will need palliative care in
2040 (Table 3).
Projection method 2 (constant proportion): If age-
and sex-specific proportions of deaths requiring pallia-
tive care, using the ICD-10 estimate, remain the same
as in 2014, the number of people requiring palliative
care will grow by 25.0% (from 375,398 to 469,305
people/year; 93,907 increase) by 2040 (Table 3 and
Fig. 1).
Projection method 2 (assuming annual change): If the
2006–2014 age- and sex-specific trend in palliative care
need according to the ICD-10 estimate continues, the
proportion of people needing palliative care will rise to
85.5% of all deaths (537,240). This corresponds to
161,842 more people needing palliative care each year
than in 2014. If the more recent 2011–2014 trend is
used, 87.6% of all deaths (550,734; 175,336 more) will
need palliative care by 2040.

age and disease groups
Palliative care need by age group
Based
on
projection
method
2
(assuming
annual
change), we found that the number of people who die
aged 0–44 years who are likely to need palliative care
will fall between 2014 and 2040 from 6465 to 3891.
Similarly, palliative care need in the 45–69 age group
will fall from 46,201 to 31,132 due to expected mortality
improvements in this age group (Fig. 2). However, the
number of people aged 85 and older who need palliative
care will more than double, rising from 142,716 in 2014
(38.0% of overall palliative care need estimate) to
300,910 in 2040 (56.0% of the need estimate).
Palliative care need by disease group
Our disease group projections were based on projection
method 2 (assuming annual change). Assuming that re-
cent trends in mortality will continue in a linear fashion,
cancer deaths will rise from 143,638 in 2014 to 208,636
deaths per year in 2040. Dementia deaths are projected
to rise from 59,199 to 219,409. Organ failure deaths are
projected to fall in people aged below 90, resulting in an
overall reduction from 129,338 to 98,092. However, in

 people dying aged 90 and over, organ failure deaths are
projected to rise by 12,088. Other deaths will fall from
43,223 to 34,134 (Fig. 3).
Projection incorporating pain prevalence
Our estimates of pain prevalence in the four groups of
diseases were 84% in cancer [25], 67% in organ failure
[25], and 60% in dementia and other [33]. Applying
these pain prevalence estimates to refine the projection
of palliative care need according to method 2 (assuming
annual change 2006–2014) indicated that, by 2040,
393,101 (70.1%) people within the palliative care need
estimate will have pain (Fig. 3); of these, 175,254 deaths
from cancer, 131,645 from dementia, 65,721 from organ
failure, and 20,480 from other diseases will have pain.
This demonstrates that, whilst the raw numbers of
people dying from dementia are projected to be higher
than cancer by 2040, the number of people with cancer
and pain (175,254) will be greater than the number of
people with dementia and pain (131,645).
Sensitivity analyses
Our projection using the Lee–Carter approach [36] found
that 551,146 people would need palliative care by 2040,
which differs by 2.6% from projection method 2 (assuming
annual change 2006–2014) (see Additional file 2). To as-
sess the impact of data collection period on our projec-
tions, we compared the palliative care estimate reached
using 2014–2015 population data with 2014 death registry
data, to the same estimate using 2013–2014 population
data with 2014 death registry data. We found that using
the later period reduced the palliative care need estimate
by 0.5%.
Discussion
This study projects, for the first time, an estimate of pal-
liative care need 25 years into the future, showing that
between 25% and 47% more people may need palliative
care by 2040 in England and Wales. The projected rise
in deaths from chronic diseases, in addition to increasing
overall deaths, and more deaths occurring at older ages,
will drive growth in palliative care need that is much
greater than previously expected. Our projection of mor-
tality for major disease groups further indicates that the
dominant illnesses accounting for the growth in pallia-
tive care need will be dementia and cancer.
It is as yet unclear exactly how health professionals are
to meet the increased population palliative care need. If
all are to receive palliative care from specialist teams, a
massive increase in training of specialist nurses and phy-
sicians is needed now. On the other hand, generalists
may continue to provide the majority of end-of-life care,
especially in community settings, with support from
specialist teams for patients with more complex needs
[37, 38]. To achieve this, we will need more staff, but
also additional training in palliative care for non-
specialist healthcare professionals currently providing
care at the end of life, including oncologists, general
practitioners, elderly care physicians and community
nurses, amongst others. It takes at least 9 years to train
a community geriatrician, and so workforce planners
need to act now [39]. Further research into education is
also needed to ensure we provide optimal healthcare
professional training in palliative and end-of-life care.
These
results
are

health services because they indicate that the high
proportion of resources already required in the last

Page 6 of 10
 year of life [11, 13, 40] will rise markedly. If palliative care
need increases as these projections indicate, this amounts
to a huge challenge for both generalist and specialist pallia-
tive care services, and therefore supports an argument for
changes in models of palliative care delivery. Specialist pal-
liative care services still mainly treat patients with cancer
[41], and we project that this need will grow, particularly
given the high prevalence of pain and other symptoms in
advanced cancer. However, the unprecedented increase in
deaths from dementia means that a change in focus
towards people with dementia will also be required.
Since the disease trajectory of dementia is both pro-
longed and unpredictable [42], specialist palliative care
services may need to care for individual patients for lon-
ger periods of time and potentially provide support for
patients at several time points, which may be unsustain-
able with current care models. Integration of palliative
care into mainstream healthcare provision may be a way
to support co-ordinated care for these patients, focusing
particularly on those with complex needs [37]. Another
approach is to develop short-term palliative care inter-
ventions at key time points within the disease trajectory
[43, 44]. A third key approach is to focus efforts earlier
in the disease course. Interventions such as advance care
planning may allow needs to be met in line with patient
preferences as illness progresses [45]. To achieve this,
prospective identification of advanced disease and poten-
tial palliative care need is vital. Further work is needed
to identify who may benefit most from palliative care [46]
and to understand the stability of preferences for patients
facing a prolonged and uncertain illness trajectory [47].
In this analysis, we have used several years of high qual-
ity, whole-population data to analyse mortality trends.
The
ICD-10-based
palliative
care
estimate
uses
an
evidence-based code filter which has been developed itera-
tively over several years, and has been tested internation-
ally [21]. In reality, the situation is more complex than our
estimates suggest, since the large majority of people who
die, especially those dying at older ages, will have more
than one illness before they die [48, 49]. Multimorbidity
increases with age [48–50], which is particularly relevant
because far more deaths are projected to occur at older
ages by 2040. We cannot account for multimorbidity in
this cause-of-death-based estimate, but it is safe to assume
that, as well as the condition recorded as the ‘main’ cause
of death, many people in our estimate will have had other
comorbid conditions. This means that the complexity of
palliative care need is likely to grow due to the high symp-
tom burden [51], complex healthcare needs [52], and high
hospitalisation rates [53] of patients with multimorbidity.
Our projections may therefore underestimate overall pal-
liative care need. Future plans for end-of-life care must ac-
count for the rising healthcare use of older adults with
comorbidity [49], and health services must adapt from the

For c and d the trend from 2011 to 2014 has been projected (to avoid

 current tendency to focus care on single organ disease, to
more co-ordinated, person-focused care. Appropriate in-
tegrated models of care, including integrated short-term
specialist palliative care services, may help to improve care
co-ordination and allow care delivery in line with individ-
ual preferences [43, 54, 55].
Our projections should not be interpreted as a forecast
of what will happen. Rather, they are projections of what
may occur if recent trends in cause of death continue.
Other approaches, such as that of Lee and Carter [36],
have been used elsewhere to provide robust projections of
mortality. However, regular coding changes in mortality
datasets mean that only a short base period is available for
analysis, limiting the value of these approaches to project
disease-specific mortality [56]. Nevertheless, our sensitiv-
ity analysis using the Lee–Carter approach produced com-
parable results to the main forecasts. Our aggregate model
uses recent trends to project future levels of need. Because
of this, we cannot account for potential future changes in
medical treatments or patient outcomes, such as the im-
pact of a rise in obesity, or advances in cancer treatment
[8]. This is particularly important for dementia – whilst
current trends suggest an increase in prevalence of
dementia to two million people in the UK by 2051 [57],
some evidence suggests dementia prevalence may soon
start to fall due to improved management of risk factors
[58]. If dementia prevalence does fall, the rise in dementia
deaths will be smaller than recent trends suggest. Never-
theless, more people will live with chronic illness and mul-
timorbidity as life expectancy rises [48]. We can therefore
be confident that, even if dementia prevalence falls, popu-
lation palliative care need will rise markedly.
We have limited our projections to 2040 because of the
increased uncertainty in mortality projections after this
point. However, population data indicates that, whilst
deaths in each age group over 65 are increasing in number
up to 2040, deaths as a proportion of the population still
alive in each age group over 65 are falling [7]. This means
that, by 2040, many more people will be living over the
age of 65. What is certain is that all of these people will
eventually die, meaning that population palliative care
need in older people will increase beyond 2040.
This study shares the limitations of all analyses using
death registry data in that it relies on accurate completion
of death certificates. Some causes of death are inconsist-
ently recorded [59, 60] and this can lead to over- or under-
reporting. These errors tend to be quite specific (e.g. colon
cancer vs. rectal cancer [60]), so our choice of broader dis-
ease groups will reduce errors. Using death registry data
also means that we can only estimate palliative care need at
the end of life. Whilst the majority of palliative care needs
do occur in the last months of life, palliative care needs are
increasingly recognised earlier in the disease course, and
such needs would not be captured by our estimate.
Conclusions
This study builds on existing population palliative care esti-
mates by investigating future palliative care need. Our ana-
lysis indicates that palliative care need will grow far more
over the next 25 years than previously expected. The rise
in deaths from chronic illnesses likely to require palliative
care means that need will grow out of proportion to ex-
pected demographic changes. Many high-income countries
will undergo similar population and disease changes and
so can expect comparable increases in palliative care need.
Current models of palliative care must adapt to these pro-
jected changes, and greater focus on non-specialist health
professional education is needed. In particular, we must
prepare for the growth in dementia and cancer if we are to
provide appropriate care to people dying in the future.
