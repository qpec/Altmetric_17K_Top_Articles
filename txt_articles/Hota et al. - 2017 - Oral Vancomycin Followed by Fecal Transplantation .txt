Background. Fecal transplantation (FT) is a promising treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but its true 
effectiveness remains unknown. We compared 14 days of oral vancomycin followed by a single FT by enema with oral vancomycin 
taper (standard of care) in adult patients experiencing acute recurrence of CDI.
Methods. In a phase 2/3, single-center, open-label trial, participants from Ontario, Canada, experiencing recurrence of CDI 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 14 days of oral vancomycin treatment followed by a single 500-mL FT by enema, or a 6-week 
taper of oral vancomycin. Patients with significant immunocompromise, history of fulminant CDI, or irreversible bleeding disorders 
were excluded. The primary endpoint was CDI recurrence within 120 days. Microbiota analysis was performed on fecal filtrate from 
donors and stool samples from FT recipients, as available.
Results. The study was terminated at the interim analysis after randomizing 30 patients. Nine of 16 (56.2%) patients who received 
FT and 5 of 12 (41.7%) in the vancomycin taper group experienced recurrence of CDI, corresponding with symptom resolution in 
43.8% and 58.3%, respectively. Fecal microbiota analysis of 3 successful FT recipients demonstrated increased diversity. A futility 
analysis did not support continuing the study. Adverse events were similar in both groups and uncommon.
Conclusions. In patients experiencing an acute episode of recurrent CDI, a single FT by enema was not significantly different 
from oral vancomycin taper in reducing recurrent CDI. Further research is needed to explore optimal donor selection, FT prepara-
tion, route, timing, and number of administrations.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI), characterized 
by repeated episodes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes 
sepsis, affects 20%–47% of patients with CDI [1, 2]. It is thought 
to arise from disruption of intestinal microbiota due to antibi-
otic exposure, age, medical conditions, and suboptimal humoral 
immune response. The standard treatment for RCDI is a taper 
regimen of oral vancomycin over 6–8 weeks [3, 4]. However, as 
an antibiotic, vancomycin may perpetuate the problem by further 
interfering with the intestinal microbiota. Moreover, the effec-
tiveness of tapering vancomycin is poorly understood.
Fecal transplantation (FT), the introduction of feces from 
a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of someone with dis-
rupted microbiota, is a promising salvage therapy for RCDI. 
Multiple systematic reviews of largely uncontrolled, heter-
ogeneous studies, have reported success rates of 80%–93% 
for RCDI [5–9]. Five randomized trials have shown symp-
tom resolution in 70%–94%; however, none of these studies 
compared FT to standard of care treatment and not all eval-
uated FT for treatment of active episodes of RCDI [10–14]. 
Therefore, the true effectiveness of FT, as compared to current 
standard of care, for treatment of an acute episode of RCDI

remains uncertain. Furthermore, FTs are being manufactured 
and performed with considerable variability and some of these 
factors may affect outcome [15]. Consequently, best practice 
guidelines, specialist groups, and regulatory bodies have both 
endorsed and cautioned clinicians about FT [3, 4, 16–20].
With the hypothesis that FT was superior to oral vancomy-
cin taper, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
comparing the effectiveness of 14 days of oral vancomycin fol-
lowed by a single FT by enema with standard of care treatment, 
a 6-week taper of oral vancomycin, in patients experiencing an 
acute episode of RCDI.
METHODS
Design and Participants
We conducted a phase 2/3, single-site, open-label RCT compar-
ing 14 days of oral vancomycin followed by a single fecal trans-
plant (FT) by enema with 6 weeks of oral vancomycin taper in 
adult patients experiencing an acute episode of RCDI. FT was 
performed using fresh donations from screened, healthy donors 
identified by the recipients. Research ethics board and Health 
Canada approvals were obtained. A data and safety monitoring 
committee monitored the trial.
Participants were recruited in Ontario, Canada. Consenting 
adult (≥18 years of age) patients were included if they had a his-
tory of at least 2 episodes of laboratory or pathology-confirmed 
CDI, and had received at least one course of oral vancomycin 
(minimum 10 days of 500 mg total daily dose). Symptoms of 
CDI were self-reported and confirmed by study physicians 
to meet standard epidemiologic definitions of diarrhea [21]. 
Enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) for C. difficile toxin or polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) for C. difficile toxin gene was accepted 
for laboratory confirmation.
Exclusions included neutropenia, graft-vs-host disease, 
or other severe immunocompromised states; CDI requiring 
intensive care unit admission; evidence of active, severe colitis 
unresponsive to oral vancomycin; hypersensitivity or intol-
erance to oral vancomycin; chronic gastrointestinal diseases 
that may cause diarrhea; planned therapy in the next 120 days 
that may cause diarrhea (eg, chemotherapy); planned surgery 
requiring perioperative antibiotics within 120 days; preg-
nancy; significant bleeding disorder; or inability to tolerate FT 
procedure.
Consenting adult (≥18 years age) potential donors were 
screened using a self-screening questionnaire of behaviors 
associated with risk for blood-borne pathogens, study phy-
sician assessment, and blood and stool testing for potentially 
transmissible infections. Donor screening occurred after 
randomization of a participant to FT and within 2 weeks of 
FT. Donor exclusion criteria (see Supplementary Methods 1) 
and screening were developed in consultation with Health 
Canada.
Procedures
Upon recurrence of CDI, participants were randomized at a 1:1 
ratio to either intervention. Investigators and participants were 
not blinded to interventions as it would be impractical due to 
FT odor, and sham enemas were not endorsed by the research 
ethics board due to unnecessary potential risk.
For vancomycin taper, participants received 14 days of van-
comycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours followed by a taper over 
4 weeks: vancomycin 125 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 week; 
then, vancomycin 125 mg orally every 24 hours for 1 week; 
then, vancomycin 125 mg orally every second day for 1 week; 
then, vancomycin 125 mg orally every third day for 1 week.
Patients randomized to FT received 14 days of oral vanco-
mycin 125 mg every 6 hours followed by one FT by enema, 48 
hours after stopping vancomycin. Donors provided stool from 
their most recent bowel movement, no more than 48 hours 
before FT. Fifty grams of donated feces was homogenized with 
500 mL of normal saline in a Stomacher Lab Blender using 
a sterile 330-µm microfilter-separated double compartment 
polyethylene bag. Five hundred milliliters of fecal filtrate was 
transferred to an enema bag and delivered immediately to the 
patient over 10–30 minutes. These proportions were selected 
based on published methodologies for FT at the time of study 
design [22–24]. The manufacturing of FT was validated for 
viability of aerobes and anaerobes using semiquantitative cul-
ture [25].
Participants were followed for 120 days. For vancomycin 
taper, day 0 was the first day of the 4-week taper whereas for 
FT, day 0 was the day of FT. Participants reported by telephone 
and submitted stools for testing if diarrhea occurred between 
days 0 and 120. Stools were also requested for microbiota 
analysis at baseline, day 7, and day 120. Two study visits (at 
days 7 and 120) and 4 telephone visits (at days 4, 21, 42, and 
84) evaluated possible CDI recurrence and adverse events. 
Participants who experienced RCDI were offered crossover to 
the alternative study treatment and followed for an additional 
120 days.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was recurrence of symptomatic, lab-
oratory-confirmed CDI within 120 days of the intervention, 
using criteria outlined in the inclusion criteria. Safety out-
comes included solicited adverse events at days 4 and 7; unso-
licited adverse events within 14 days of interventions; serious 
adverse events throughout follow-up; mortality attributable to 
CDI during follow-up; and all-cause mortality throughout fol-
low-up. Other secondary outcomes included recurrence of CDI 
symptoms within 14 and 120 days (not laboratory-confirmed); 
recurrence of CDI within 120 days of crossover; days of diar-
rhea in the 120 days of follow-up; and CDI requiring hospital 
admission. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess for 
symptoms of RCDI and adverse events.

Fecal Microbiota Analysis
Fecal microbiota analysis was performed retrospectively on 
frozen fecal filtrate from 19 donors and stool from 3 recipients 
with successful outcomes (baseline; 7 days post-FT; 16 weeks 
post-FT, as available). DNA was extracted using PowerSoil 
DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, California). 
The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA locus was inter-
rogated using the V4-515F and V4-806R primers [26] and ana-
lyzed with QIIME [27]. Diversity indices were compared using 
Student t test (Supplementary Methods 2).
Statistical Analyses
Using a 2-sided test for comparison of 2 independent propor-
tions, and assuming 8% recurrence in the FT group [22], 30% 
recurrence in the vancomycin arm [28], 80% power, and α of 
.05, we required 57 participants per intervention (114 partici-
pants total). Assuming 20% attrition over follow-up, 138 partic-
ipants were required for randomization.
We planned an interim analysis for safety and feasibility after 
the completion of the first 30 participants. The trial was stopped 
at the interim analysis and a futility analysis based on the pri-
mary outcome was added using a Bayesian approach [29]. The 
primary analysis was per protocol and secondary analysis was 
intention to treat. For the primary outcome, we calculated the 
posterior distribution of the risk difference and the probabil-
ity that the absolute risk reduction exceeded several clinically 
important thresholds (any reduction, >10%, and >20%). All 
Bayesian analyses used uniform priors on proportions. Analyses 
of safety and secondary outcomes were descriptive. All analyses 
were done using R 3.2.1 [30].
RESULTS
Between January 2011 and July 2014, 140 patients were assessed 
for eligibility (Figure 1). Forty were ineligible on prescreening 
and 19 declined participation, primarily due to unwillingness 
to be randomized. Of the 81 consented patients, 3 met exclu-
sion criteria and 48 (59.2%) did not experience recurrence of 
symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed CDI over the study period, 
which was required for randomization. Of these 48 patients, 2 
experienced diarrhea not meeting case definition and 6 expe-
rienced self-limited diarrhea meeting case definition but with 
negative C. difficile laboratory tests. Thirty patients were ran-
domized: 14 to vancomycin taper and 16 to FT. Two patients 
in the vancomycin taper group withdrew—one to seek FT else-
where and another due to repeated protocol noncompliance.

Thus, 12 patients in the vancomycin taper arm and 16 in the FT 
arm were included in the interim analysis.
Baseline characteristics were similar in both randomiza-
tion groups (Table 1). Most randomized patients were women 
and had a history of 4–5 episodes (range, 2–9) of CDI prior to 
entering the trial. Thirteen (13/16) of the FT and 10 of 12 of the 
vancomycin taper patients had failed at least one vancomycin 
taper prior to enrollment. In comparison to those randomized, 
patients who were not randomized because they did not have an 
episode of RCDI were younger, had fewer recurrences, and had 
lower mean Charlson comorbidity scores. In the FT group, 10 
of 16 participants retained at least 80% (400 cc) of the enema.
Of 18 donors screened, 2 were excluded on the basis of stool 
and blood testing. Most donors were male (12/16) with a mean 
age of 50 years. Eleven (11/16) were blood relatives of the recip-
ient and 4 (4/16) lived within the same household as the recipi-
ent at the time of donation.
Nine of 16 (56.2%) patients who received FT and 5 of 12 
(41.7%) in the vancomycin taper group experienced recurrence, 
corresponding with resolution of symptoms in 43.8% and 
58.3%, respectively (Figure 2). Recurrence occurred a median 
of 9 days after FT treatment and 35 days after initiating vanco-
mycin tapering (7 days after completing the vancomycin taper). 
There was no association between donor relatedness or shared 
household and FT recipient recurrence. Four of the 5 patients 
who failed vancomycin taper crossed over to FT. All 4 experi-
enced recurrence of symptoms after FT. All patients who failed 
FT subsequently withdrew.
Figure 3 shows the per-protocol absolute risk reduction esti-
mates for CDI recurrence with FT. Although the initial plan 
was for intention-to-treat analysis, given the small number of 
participants, the 2 patients in the vancomycin group who did 
not complete the trial were excluded. The Bayesian 95% interval 
for the change in risk of CDI recurrence with FT ranged from a 
2.8% reduction to a 47.3% increase. There was a posterior prob-
ability of 22.2% that the FT reduced recurrences at all and only 
a 2.8% probability that risk was reduced by 20% or more.
The futility analysis found that if the planned total of 57 
patients were randomized to each treatment group, given the 
current data, there was only a 3.4% probability of finding a 
significant benefit for FT, defined as the upper end of the one-
sided Bayesian 95% interval for the risk reduction lying below 
0. Results of the futility analysis did not change using intention 
to treat.
In the early period (days 0–7), abdominal pain, tenderness, 
and bloating were equally prevalent in the FT and vancomycin 
groups (Table 2). In the later period (after 7 days), abdominal 
pain, tenderness, bloating, mucoid stools, and smelly stools 
were reported more frequently in the vancomycin group.
Four serious adverse events were reported in 3 patients. None 
was deemed related to the study interventions. One patient in 
the vancomycin taper group was hospitalized with fever and 
a urinary tract infection. One FT patient was hospitalized 
with anasarca and was diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. 
Another FT patient experienced a perforated bowel secondary 
to diverticulitis 35 days after FT. This patient had a longstanding 
history of diverticulitis; upon review with the most responsible 
physicians, it was decided that the FT was unlikely to be related 
to the perforation.
No study participant experienced recurrence of CDI symp-
toms without laboratory confirmation within 14 days or 
120 days of treatment. Patients who underwent FT experienced

a mean of 0.8 (SD, 0.8) days of diarrhea in follow-up, com-
pared with 1.7 (SD, .4) days in the vancomycin taper group. No 
patients developed CDI requiring hospital admission or died.
Fecal microbiota composition and diversity of 19 FT donors 
were consistently high, with no significant difference between 
those associated with FT success and FT failure (Supplementary 
Figure). In 3 successful FT recipients, we demonstrated 
increased fecal microbiota diversity post-FT.
DISCUSSION
In this trial evaluating treatment of an acute episode of RCDI, 
a single FT using fresh donor stools administered by enema 
after 14 days oral vancomycin therapy had comparable effec-
tiveness to 6 weeks of tapered oral vancomycin, with resolution 
of CDI in 43.8% and 58.3% in each group, respectively. Our trial 
was stopped after randomization of 30 patients, on the basis of 
futility.
FT has been widely reported as 80%–93% effective at curing 
RCDI [5–14]. These high success rates are derived from studies 
with various limitations. Most FT studies reporting effective-
ness >90% are observational and methodologically heteroge-
neous. One RCT was stopped early, reporting 81% resolution 
after a single FT by nasojejunal administration, compared with 
31% after 2 weeks of oral vancomycin [10]. Two weeks of oral 
vancomycin is associated with a higher failure rate than vanco-
mycin taper [28], possibly contributing to the trial’s early termi-
nation. A second RCT of FT by colonoscopy stopped early for 
effectiveness, but it too used a comparator that was not stand-
ard of care [11]. A small randomized trial of FT by nasogastric 
route vs colonoscopy using a frozen inoculum reported overall 
CDI resolution in 90% of 20 treated patients [12]. In another 
randomized trial, clinical resolution occurred in 70.3% and

Although follow-up continued for 120 days, the y-axis ends at 60 days as there 
were no recurrences beyond this timepoint.

75% of patients randomized to fresh and frozen FT by enema, 
respectively (n = 219) [13]. These latter 2 studies included RCDI 
patients on suppressive antibiotic therapy rather than those 
experiencing acute recurrence. Without a control arm in either 
trial, it is not known what proportion of patients would have 
been symptom-free had their antibiotics been simply discontin-
ued. A multicenter, double-blind randomized trial found 90.9% 
clinical cure in acute and chronic RCDI patients receiving 
donor FT compared with 62.5% in those receiving autologous 
FT by colonoscopy [14]. However, at one site, 90% of patients 
receiving autologous FT reported clinical cure, highlighting the 
high proportion of patients labeled as RCDI who may become 
symptom-free upon discontinuation of vancomycin suppressive 
therapy.
In the aforementioned studies, multiple administrations of 
FT were often required to achieve resolution of CDI symptoms 
[5, 6, 10, 13]. Single administration of FT resulted in lower res-
olution of CDI: 62%, 65%, and 70% in 3 randomized trials [11–
13]. The 43.8% resolution of RCDI from a single FT observed in 
our study is therefore in line with previous reports.
The timing of FT, patient pretreatment, patient and donor 
selection, FT manufacturing, route of administration, and 
duration of follow-up also likely have an impact on outcomes 
of FT [15]. We randomized patients once they experienced an 
acute recurrence of CDI and not during symptom-free inter-
vals, thereby ensuring we compared patients at the same point 
in their disease course. Our patients were typical for those in 
whom FT would be considered in most jurisdictions. We based 
our protocols for donor feces collection, delivery, and manufac-
turing on published literature and an internal laboratory vali-
dation study. We demonstrated increased microbiota diversity 
post-FT in 3 recipients. Enema route was chosen for delivery 
as it was supported by data, practical, inexpensive, and well-ac-
cepted by patients [22]. Although FT may also be administered 
by colonoscopy or nasojejunal tube, to date, there are no defin-
itive data demonstrating superiority of one route of admin-
istration over another [5–9, 12]. Finally, we included a long 
follow-up of 120 days to capture treatment failures.
We pretreated FT patients with 14 days of oral vancomycin, 
which may have negatively impacted the intestinal microbiota 
such that a single FT was not sufficient for flora reconstitution. 
Vancomycin was discontinued 48 hours prior to FT. Subsequent 
data demonstrate that vancomycin remains detectable in feces 
for 4–5 days after discontinuation of therapy, potentially 
impacting the microbiota of the FT [31].
The ideal approach to donor selection has yet to be defined. 
We did not attempt to match our donors to recipients in any 
way. We demonstrated high microbiota diversity in our donor 
pool, regardless of recipient relatedness, shared household, or 
recipient outcome.
We present valuable data on the effectiveness of a 6-week 
oral vancomycin taper, the current standard of care treatment 
for multiple recurrences of CDI. Vancomycin taper resulted in 
recurrence in 41.7% of our patients. This proportion is higher 
than the 0–30% recurrence rate reported in 2 older observa-
tional studies upon which current treatment recommendations 
are based [28, 32].
We noted that 59% of enrolled patients never experienced 
recurrence of disease and were therefore not randomized, 
despite prior histories of several CDI recurrences. Seventeen 
percent (8/48) of these patients experienced symptoms sugges-
tive of postinfectious irritable bowel disease such as self-lim-
ited loose stools. As clinical features of RCDI in FT studies are 
often self-reported and may not be corroborated by medical 
assessment or laboratory confirmation, it is possible that post-
infectious irritable bowel syndrome is confounding the true 
estimates of recurrence in some studies. Indeed, others have 
reported similar observations [14, 33].
A limitation of our study is the small number of randomized 
patients. Furthermore, our patients received FT as outpatients, 
so these results cannot be extrapolated to the more acutely ill. 
Finally, we were unable to perform a blinded study.
We show a similar recurrence rate in RCDI patients treated 
with 14 days of oral vancomycin followed by single FT by 
enema compared with oral vancomycin taper. These data 
should be taken into consideration in CDI treatment guide-
lines and in the design of FT programs. More research is 
needed to optimize FT methodologies—specifically, donor 
selection, FT manufacturing, timing, route, and number of 
administrations.
