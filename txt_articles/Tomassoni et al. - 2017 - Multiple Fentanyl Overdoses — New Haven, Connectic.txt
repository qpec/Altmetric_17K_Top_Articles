On the evening of June 23, 2016, a white powder advertised 
as cocaine was purchased off the streets from multiple sources 
and used by an unknown number of persons in New Haven, 
Connecticut. During a period of less than 8 hours, 12 patients 
were brought to the emergency department (ED) at Yale New 
Haven Hospital, experiencing signs and symptoms consistent 
with opioid overdose. The route of intoxication was not known, 
but presumed to be insufflation (“snorting”) in most cases. 
Some patients required doses of the opioid antidote naloxone 
exceeding 4 mg (usual initial dose = 0.1–0.2 mg intravenously), 
and several patients who were alert after receiving naloxone 
subsequently developed respiratory failure. Nine patients were 
admitted to the hospital, including four to the intensive care 
unit (ICU); three required endotracheal intubation, and one 
required continuous naloxone infusion. Three patients died. 
The white powder was determined to be fentanyl, a drug 50 
times more potent than heroin, and it included trace amounts 
of cocaine. The episode triggered rapid notification of public 
health and law enforcement agencies, interviews of patients 
and their family members to trace and limit further use or 
distribution of the fentanyl, immediate naloxone resupply and 
augmentation for emergency medical services (EMS) crews, 
public health alerts, and plans to accelerate naloxone distribu-
tion to opioid users and their friends and families. Effective 
communication and timely, coordinated, collaborative actions 
of community partners reduced the harm caused by this event 
and prevented potential subsequent episodes.
Shortly after 4:00 p.m. on June 23, 2016, four patients with 
symptoms and signs of opioid overdose, characterized by central 
nervous system and respiratory depression, miosis (pinpoint 
pupil constriction), hypotension, and bradycardia, arrived in 
rapid succession at the York Street Campus (two patients) and 
St. Raphael Campus (two patients) EDs of Yale New Haven 
Hospital in downtown New Haven. Within 6 hours, seven 
additional patients arrived at the York Street Campus ED and 
one more at the St. Raphael ED; these patients included two 
who were pronounced dead on arrival and four critically ill 
patients requiring endotracheal intubation and ICU admission 
(Figure). The patients represented four geographic clusters (i.e., 
at least one other victim found in the same vehicle or park-
ing lot, or in the same house or an adjacent house), and were 
transported by EMS crews responding to bystander 911 calls. 
All of the patients had clinical signs of opioid overdose and 
received at least one dose of naloxone from EMS (Table 1). 
Twelve patients met the case definition for suspected fentanyl 
exposure (i.e., clinical signs of opioid toxicity and response to 
naloxone, with laboratory confirmation of fentanyl or fentanyl 
metabolites in blood, or history of direct association with a 
laboratory-confirmed fentanyl exposure) (Table 1). Among the 
four patients admitted to the ICU, three required endotracheal 
intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure 
that was relatively refractory to large doses of naloxone, and 
one required a continuous naloxone infusion for 12 hours. Two 
of the three intubated patients suffered acute kidney injury 
and pulmonary or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, one of whom 
(patient K) died 3 days later from multisystem organ failure. 
The third patient survived with permanent cardiac injury. 
Other intoxicated patients who arrived at the ED with signs 
or symptoms of the opioid toxidrome were excluded from this 
analysis because of inconsistent history (e.g., patient reported 
using a nonfentanyl opioid) or toxicology test results that did 
not identify fentanyl.
Shortly after arrival in the ED, serum toxicology screens, 
designed to detect a panel of nonopioid toxins, were per-
formed for all patients, and qualitative urine immunoassay 
toxicology screens for drugs of abuse were performed for nine 
patients (A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, and L) (Table 2). The urine 
immunoassay screening tests cannot detect fentanyl and its 
analogs; however, all but one of the nine tested positive for 
cocaine. The one patient with a negative urine cocaine screen 
(patient A) acknowledged past cocaine use. Serum and urine 
specimens were later analyzed at the University of California, 
San Francisco (UCSF) using liquid chromatography high-
resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) (1) to detect 215 
common illicit and pharmaceutical drugs and metabolites, 
followed by additional analyses in attempts to identify 7,038 
novel drugs and metabolites (2,3). Levels of fentanyl, cocaine, 
benzoylecgonine (a cocaine metabolite that persists in body 
fluids and is an indicator of cocaine use) and levamisole 
(a veterinary antihelminthic that has been used as a cocaine 
adulterant) were quantified. Nine patients (B, C, D, F, G, H, 
J, K, and L) had fentanyl detected in blood that was collected 
during their hospitalization and tested at UCSF (Table 2). 
One patient who reported cocaine use before symptom onset 
(patient A) and who was found in the vicinity of patients B, 
C, and D at the time of intoxication, was discharged before 
the full scope of the outbreak had been recognized and did 
not receive confirmatory toxicology testing. The Connecticut

Medical Examiner’s Office performed postmortem toxicology 
screens on specimens obtained from two patients who died en 
route to the hospital (patients E and I).
Serum samples from the hospitalized patients analyzed 
at UCSF demonstrated fentanyl levels of 0.5–9.5 ng/mL 
(Table 2) (therapeutic range for analgesia = 0.6–3.0 ng/mL) 
(4); postmortem levels in the first two patients who died were 
11 ng/mL (patient E) and 13 ng/mL (patient I). Norfentanyl, a 
major metabolite of fentanyl, was detected in the serum of nine 
patients; norfentanyl was not detected in postmortem testing 
of patients E and I, presumably because death occurred before 
metabolism of fentanyl to norfentanyl. All hospitalized patients 
had detectable serum levels of cocaine, cocaine metabolites 
(benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester), cocaethylene 
(a compound formed in vivo when ethanol is ingested in the 
presence of cocaine), or levamisole by LC-HRMS confirmatory 
testing (Table 2), all suggesting recent cocaine use. The absence 
of other opioids, such as heroin, methadone, or oxycodone, in 
serum (only one patient [D] was hydrocodone positive) was 
consistent with reports by the patients that most were not 
habitual opioid users.
Additional substances detected in serum and urine were 
reported qualitatively (Table 2) and reflected nicotine (coti-
nine), cannabinoid (tetrahydrocannabinol), and hydroxyzine

(antihistamine) use, or receipt of naloxone. Postmortem toxi-
cology screens identified fentanyl as a cause of death for patients 
E and I, both of whom arrived in the ED in cardiac arrest. In 
addition to the clinical specimens, one 32-mg forensic sample 
of the illicit drug material collected by law enforcement was 
tested at the Drug Enforcement Administration laboratory. 
Analysis of that product recovered from an involved crime scene 
found 6.6% (± 0.8%) fentanyl by weight with trace amounts 
of cocaine and an inert adulterant.
Within a few hours of recognition of the outbreak, a multia-
gency response involving the New Haven Office of Emergency 
Management, New Haven and Connecticut Departments of 
Public Health, the Drug Enforcement Administration, local 
police, Connecticut Poison Control Center, and the New 
Haven Mayor’s Office was undertaken. Initial actions included 
1) rapid notification of public health and law enforcement 
agencies by ED and EMS personnel; 2) real-time interviews 
of patients and family members in an attempt to trace and 
limit further use or distribution of the fentanyl; 3) advice to 
EMS crews to increase naloxone doses in treating suspected 
cases; 4) public health alerts regarding the event, including 
notices of the sale of a high potency opioid marketed as 
cocaine causing deaths in the region; and 5) plans to acceler-
ate distribution of naloxone to opioid users and their friends 
and families. The high naloxone requirements necessitated 
both immediate naloxone resupply and augmentation for local 
EMS crews, including the transfer of 700 naloxone kits from 
the Connecticut Department of Public Health to hospitals 
and EMS crews the following morning. Actions of multiple 
partners led to the arrest 4 days later of three persons allegedly 
responsible for the illicit fentanyl sales.
Discussion
This explosive occurrence of multiple fentanyl overdoses 
triggered a rapid response by public safety and medical com-
munities to identify the substance and its source. Federal, state, 
and local agencies responded to confine the outbreak quickly, 
save patient lives where possible, alert the public, and gather

additional information. The rapid medical, law enforcement, 
and public health actions likely limited the extent and impact 
of this outbreak.
These events highlight the intrinsic risks inherent in illicit 
drug use and support the broad distribution of naloxone. The 
urine toxicology screens suggest that most patients were cocaine 
users, but not chronic opioid users, and as such, would likely 
not have received any training in the identification or treatment 
of opioid overdose. This episode resulted in the formation of 
a partnership between the Connecticut Department of Public 
Health and Yale New Haven Hospital that facilitated imple-
mentation of a pilot program to provide overdose education 
and take-home naloxone kits to ED patients at risk for over-
dose. In addition, community opioid treatment programs and 
providers collaborated with the EDs to provide rapid access to 
treatment for patients with opioid use disorders.
Commonly available immunoassay toxicology screening tests 
are unable to detect fentanyl or its metabolites; the opiate screen 
is designed to detect codeine, morphine, and heroin, and with 
an expanded panel, oxycodone and methadone. Widespread 
use of toxicology screens unable to detect fentanyl or its analogs 
underscores the importance of recognizing the opioid toxi-
drome. Rescuers and clinicians should recognize the potential 
need to administer multiple or high doses of naloxone in cases 
of opioid overdose that do not respond to administration of 
a single standard naloxone dose where fentanyl or its analogs 
(highly potent opioids) might be responsible for unresponsive-
ness. The total dose of naloxone required for opioid reversal 
will depend on many factors, including the opioid dose, the 
potency of the opioid in binding receptors, the lipophilicity 
of the opioid in crossing into the central nervous system, the 
elimination half-life of the opioid, individual patient factors, 
and the route of administration of the naloxone (intranasal 
compared with intramuscular or intravenous) (5–7). Because 
of the persistent respiratory depression associated with fen-
tanyl, additional doses of naloxone might be needed after 
initial reversal.*
Although illicit opioids often are mixed with harmful 
adulterants (e.g., fentanyl and its analogs blended with or 
deliberately substituted for heroin or mixed with the opioid 
analgesic combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone 
[e.g., Norco]) (8,9), this outbreak was unique in representation 
of fentanyl as cocaine to an opioid-naïve population, which 
resulted in an outbreak of fatal and nonfatal overdoses.
Lack of metabolism of fentanyl to norfentanyl might be the 
result of rapid death after fentanyl use (10). It has been sug-
gested that rapid death might be caused by immediate onset 
of respiratory arrest or that fentanyl might cause rapid onset of 
chest wall rigidity, leading to death (10). This effect of fentanyl 
is well recognized by clinicians familiar with the drug, but is 
not likely to be known among illicit drug users. In addition, 
many users might be unaware that their expected substance 
of choice might be substituted by or adulterated with high 
doses of fentanyl.
Distribution of naloxone to persons at risk for opioid 
overdose, their families, and friends through prescriptions by 
practitioners, pharmacists, and other public health avenues 
might help prevent fatal fentanyl overdoses. In addition, this 
outbreak of severe opioid intoxication among patients who 
were cocaine users, but not chronic opioid users, suggests 
that distributing naloxone and offering training to all illicit 
drug users, their friends, and family members might prevent 
such opioid-associated morbidity and mortality. The swift 
coordinated multiagency response likely limited the impact of 
this outbreak, and the resultant strengthening of community 
partnerships has the potential to further limit the morbidity 
and mortality related to opioids in communities.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Fentanyl and its analogs have been substituted for heroin and 
other opioids, and are usually marketed to persons seeking 
opioids. Because of fentanyl’s high potency compared with 
heroin, methadone, and oxycodone, there is a high risk for fatal 
overdose associated with illicit use. Higher than normal doses of 
the opioid antagonist naloxone might be required to reverse 
fentanyl overdose.
What is added by this report?
On June 23, 2016, fentanyl marketed as cocaine resulted in an 
extraordinary opioid overdose outbreak in New Haven, 
Connecticut, resulting within 6 hours in at least 12 cases, 
marked by four intensive care unit admissions and three deaths. 
A rapid and coordinated public health response involving 
multiple partners likely reduced the impact of this outbreak.
What are the implications for public health practice?
A collaborative and timely multi-organization response can 
mitigate the consequences of an extraordinary public health 
event. Development and implementation of a screening test for 
fentanyl might inform clinicians about the presence of these 
particularly deadly opioids and prevent deaths. Opioid use 
education and naloxone administration kits and education 
should be extended to all persons at risk for illicit drug use, their 
families, and friends.
