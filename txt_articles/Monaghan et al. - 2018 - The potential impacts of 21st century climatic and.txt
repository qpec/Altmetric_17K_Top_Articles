Abstract The mosquito Aedes (Ae). aegypti transmits the viruses that cause dengue,
chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. We investigate how choosing alternate emissions and/
or socioeconomic pathways may modulate future human exposure to Ae. aegypti. Occurrence
patterns for Ae. aegypti for 2061–2080 are mapped globally using empirically downscaled air
temperature and precipitation projections from the Community Earth System Model, for the
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Population growth is
quantified using gridded global population projections consistent with two Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), SSP3 and SSP5. Change scenarios are compared to a
1950–2000 reference period. A global land area of 56.9 M km2 is climatically suitable for
Ae. aegypti during the reference period, and is projected to increase by 8 % (RCP4.5) to 13 %
(RCP8.5) by 2061–2080. The annual average number of people exposed globally to Ae.
aegypti for the reference period is 3794 M, a value projected to statistically significantly
increase by 298–460 M (8–12 %) by 2061–2080 if only climate change is considered, and by

 4805–5084 M (127–134 %) for SSP3 and 2232–2483 M (59–65 %) for SSP5 considering both
climate and population change (lower and upper values of each range represent RCP4.5 and
RCP8.5 respectively). Thus, taking the lower-emissions RCP4.5 pathway instead of RCP8.5
may mitigate future human exposure to Ae. aegypti globally, but the effect of population
growth on exposure will likely be larger. Regionally, Australia, Europe and North America are
projected to have the largest percentage increases in human exposure to Ae. aegypti consid-
ering only climate change.
1 Introduction
The mosquito Aedes (Ae). aegypti serves as the primary vector for the viruses that cause
dengue, the most prevalent vector-borne viral disease (WHO 2009). About 2.5 billion people
in over 100 countries live in regions of high dengue risk (Kroeger and Nathan 2006), and a
recent study estimated that up to 390 million dengue virus infections occur worldwide
annually (Bhatt et al. 2013). When present, the febrile symptoms of dengue virus infections
are generally mild to moderate, but about 1 % of infections are manifested as the more severe
dengue hemorrhagic fever (Gubler 1998). Aedes aegypti is also a vector of chikungunya virus,
which can cause dengue-like symptoms in infected persons (Pialoux et al. 2007). The annual
global occurrence of chikungunya is not well known; however, sporadic epidemics affecting
>1 M people have occurred in Asia and, more recently, the Americas (Pialoux et al. 2007;
Nasci 2014; Halstead 2015). The ranges of dengue and chikungunya are expanding (Eisen and
Moore 2013; Morrison 2014), making Ae. aegypti a vector of growing importance.
Climate variability largely determines the distribution and population dynamics of Ae.
aegypti at the global scale (e.g., Capinha et al. 2014). Aedes aegypti is typically found in
tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, within urban areas where it can exploit artificial
water-filled containers for its immature (larval and pupal) stages (Tabachnick and Powell
1979). Its northern (southern) hemisphere range is generally equatorward of the January (July)
average 10 °C isotherm, but in some cases can extend as far poleward as the 1.8 °C January
average isotherm in North America and Europe (Christophers 1960). At local scales, temper-
ature, humidity and precipitation influence Ae. aegypti development, reproduction and survival
(Focks et al. 1993; Morin et al. 2013). Warmer temperatures are associated with higher adult
mosquito abundance, because immature Ae. aegypti development rates increase as water
temperatures rise concurrently with air temperatures (Eisen et al. 2014). However, extremely
high temperatures (above ~32 °C) can decrease development rates and increase adult mortality
(Christophers 1960). Higher rainfall generally increases the number of suitable container
habitats for Ae.aegypti, and higher humidity prevents desiccation of adults, facilitating greater
mosquito abundance (Lucio et al. 2013).
Numerous studies employing varying methodologies have examined the potential for
anthropogenic climate change to alter the global range of Ae. aegypti (Campbell et al. 2014;
Capinha et al. 2014; Khormi and Kumar 2014; Rogers 2015). Collectively, the results suggest
that climate change (in particular warmer temperatures) may cause the future range of Ae.
aegypti to expand poleward from its present margins of survival. However, within some
regions presently suitable for Ae. aegypti, the future results are not as consistent among
studies. Less suitable habitats may result from climatic conditions that become too hot or
dry (Rogers 2015). The effects of rising temperatures on Ae. aegypti populations are compar-
atively robust among the studies that consider temperature as a variable, but the effects of
488

 precipitation shifts are less certain. Manual filling of mosquito container habitats by humans
may dampen the response of Ae. aegypti to rainfall fluctuations (Kearney et al. 2009), and in
some instances, increased water storage practices in response to locally drier conditions may
even enhance future habitat suitability for Ae. aegypti (Beebe et al. 2009). Some argue that
such human factors, and others including intervention practices (e.g., pesticide use), urbani-
zation, and transportation networks, may be stronger determinants of the range of Ae. aegypti
than climate (e.g., Gubler 2002; Parham et al. 2015).
This paper is part of a project on the Benefits of Reduced Anthropogenic Climate changE
(BRACE; O’Neill and Gettleman 2016.). BRACE aims to characterize the differential climate
outcomes and subsequent impacts on a variety of sectors that result from differences in
greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing from two distinct emissions pathways: one in which GHG
emissions increase throughout the 21st century, and the other in which GHG emissions
eventually decrease. Related BRACE papers on health impacts examine population exposure
to extreme heat events (Xu et al. 2015; Jones et al., submitted) and future risks of heat-related
mortality (Anderson et al., submitted; Marsha et al. 2016). Here, we define four types of
occurrence patterns for the virus vector mosquito Ae. aegypti on the basis of temperature and
precipitation thresholds following Eisen et al. (2014). An ensemble of global climate model
simulations is then employed to characterize how these patterns may shift in the late 21st
century for two different climate change outcomes associated with the two distinct GHG
emissions pathways. Finally, two plausible population pathways for humanity are combined
with the projected mosquito occurrence patterns to estimate the number of humans exposed to
Ae. aegypti in the late 21st century. The present study is unique in that 1) it uses straightfor-
ward climatic thresholds to define distinct Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns; 2) it explores the
relative roles of climatic versus population changes on the future number of people exposed to
Ae. aegypti; and 3) it quantifies the avoided climatic impacts of following a lower versus
higher intensity GHG emissions pathway.
2 Methods
A brief overview of methods is provided here. A full description is in Online Resource 1.
Eisen et al. (2014) establish four types of occurrence patterns for Ae. aegypti, based on
temperature and precipitation thresholds in representative cities in which Ae. aegypti is present:
Type 1. Year-around potential for high abundance of Ae. aegypti (e.g., Manila,
Philippines);
Type 2. Year-around presence of Ae. aegypti but only seasonal potential for high
abundance (e.g., Chiang Mai, Thailand);
Type 3. Only seasonal presence of Ae. aegypti active stages (larvae, pupae and adults),
with overwintering eggs (e.g., Buenos Aires, Argentina);
Type 4. Only seasonal presence of Ae. aegypti active stages, with no overwintering eggs
producing viable larvae (e.g., Puebla City, Mexico).
These distinctions are important, because they determine the duration and Bintensity^ to
which humans in a given region may be exposed to Ae. aegypti. Table 1 shows the temperature
and precipitation thresholds from Eisen et al. (2014) used here to define Types 1–4. Only one
type is allowed to occur per grid box; where types overlap, the more suitable type for Ae.
Climatic Change (2018) 146:487–500
489
 aegypti is selected (e.g., if Types 1 and 2 overlap, Type 1 is selected). Collectively, these
thresholds indicate that warmer, wetter regions with small temperature variability are best
suited for Ae. aegypti. The thresholds from Table 1 are applied to the gridded global
temperature and precipitation fields described below to produce reference and future maps
of the four Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns.
A gridded 10 arc-minute monthly global climatology of near-surface temperature and
precipitation for 1950–2000 was obtained from version 1.4 of WorldClim (Hijmans et al.
2005). WorldClim comprises the reference historical data used to produce maps of Ae. aegypti
occurrence patterns, and provides the basis for a simple procedure to empirically downscale
and bias correct projected climate model data described in Online Resource 1.
Maps of Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns for the late 21st century are produced with future
climate projections from version 1 of the Community Earth System Model (CESM; Hurrell
et al. 2013). CESM is a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model (AOGCM). The
version used here is the same that supported the Coupled Model Intercomparison Experiment
Phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012). Simulations from the historical period (1950–2000) and
two future projections for 2061–2080 are used. The future simulations are forced in accor-
dance with the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP; van Vuuren et al. 2011) 4.5 and
8.5 scenarios. RCP4.5 is a low-to-moderate emissions and concentration scenario with GHG
radiative forcing reaching 4.5 W m-2 near 2100. RCP8.5 is a high-emissions and concentration
scenario with GHG radiative forcing reaching 8.5 W m-2 near 2100. Monthly near-surface air
temperature and precipitation fields are used from the first 15 members of a 30-member CESM
initial condition ensemble based on the RCP8.5 scenario (Kay et al. 2014) and from a 15-
member CESM ensemble based on the RCP 4.5 scenario (Sanderson et al. 2015), allowing
internal model variability to be characterized. The differences in CESM temperature and
precipitation between 1950 and 2000 and 2061–2080 for each ensemble member are then
added to the corresponding WorldClim fields to generate bias-corrected, downscaled future
projections, as described in Online Resource 1.
To assess the potential impacts of future population changes on exposure to Ae. aegypti,
gridded global population projections (Jones, B., O’Neill, B.C., Spatially explicit global
population scenarios consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, submitted to
Environmental Research Letters) from two of the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(SSPs) – SSP3 and SSP5 – are used. The SSP3, or BRegional Rivalry^, pathway describes a
world in which there are high levels of inequality and little coordination across countries, and

 in which little progress is made toward meeting development goals, addressing environmental
issues, or reducing fossil fuel consumption (O’Neill et al. 2015). Slow economic development
and lower education trends stall the demographic transition in lower income countries, leading
to rapid population growth relative to higher income nations, and a steadily increasing global
population throughout the century. The SSP5, or BFossil-fueled development^, pathway
describes a world in which traditional economic growth is seen as the solution to social and
economic issues, and is characterized by greater progress toward human development, but at
the cost of intense usage of resources and high fossil fuel consumption (O’Neill et al. 2015).
Economic growth is rapid and global population peaks by mid-century and then declines,
driven by declining fertility in developing countries, while urbanization rates are very high
worldwide. The gridded SSP3 and SSP5 population projections span each decade from 2010
to 2100, and are based on version 3 of the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) dataset for
the year 2000 (CIESIN 2005), and aggregate country-level population (Samir and Lutz 2014)
and urbanization (Jiang and O’Neill 2015) projections to 2100 consistent with each SSP. The
SSP3 and SSP5 projections for 2070 are used to represent the 2061–2080 period, and the
GPW 2000 dataset to represent the 1950–2000 reference period. The gridded population
datasets are conservatively remapped from their native 7.5 arc-minute spatial resolution
to the same 10 arc-minute resolution as the climate fields, and are used to estimate the
recent and future number of persons exposed to Ae. aegypti for each occurrence pattern
(Types 1–4), by summing the population for all grid cells corresponding to a given
pattern and region of interest. Regions include the entire globe and the six permanently
inhabited continents: Africa, Asia, Australia (including Oceania), Europe, North America
and South America.
In all results presented below, uncertainty due to both the mapping methodology and
internal climate model variability is considered. A validation of the global reference maps of
Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns and the number of humans exposed is described in Online
Resource 1, yielding an estimated methodological uncertainty of +/−10 %. Statistical signif-
icance between means is assumed when a two-tailed Student’s t-test is p < 0.05.
3 Results
3.1 Future changes in climate fields
Widespread and statistically significant near-surface air temperature increases over land are
projected for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for 2061–2080, consistent with rising
greenhouse gases in both emissions pathways (See Online Resource 2, Fig. S1). The global
average near-surface temperature increase (over land) for 2061–2080 relative to 1950–2000 is
3.1 °C for RCP4.5 and 4.8 °C for RCP8.5. The largest warming is typically at middle to high
latitudes. Statistically significant precipitation changes for 2061–2080 over land are also
widespread for both RCP scenarios. Most regions exhibit increased precipitation, consistent
with an overall increase in rainfall globally due to greater atmospheric water vapor resulting
from warmer tropospheric temperatures (e.g., Held and Soden 2006). Notable exceptions
where less rainfall is projected include Amazonian South America, Central America, western
Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, southern Africa, northwestern India and Pakistan, and southern
Australia. These patterns of climatic change play an important role in the projected 2061–2080
changes in the occurrence patterns of Ae. aegypti.

 3.2 Future changes in the geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti
The global extents of the four Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns for the 1950–2000 reference
period and their changes for the 2061–2080 RCP scenarios are shown in Fig. 1. In general, the
most suitable occurrence patterns (Types 1 and 2) are near the equator and the less suitable
patterns (Types 3 and 4) are poleward (Fig. 1a), following the climatic gradients from the
relatively warm, wet tropics to the cooler, drier mid-latitudes. Table 2 accompanies Fig. 1 and
presents the total surface area for the 1950–2000 reference period and the change in surface
area for the two 2061–2080 RCP scenarios, for each continent and globally. Types 1 and 2 are
projected to expand on all continents for both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, with the
exception of Europe where conditions remain too cool. Interestingly, strong drying in the
Amazon rainforests for RCP8.5 leads to a contraction of Type 1 in that area (Fig. 1b), muting
the overall expansion of Type 1 in South America. Type 3 exhibits areas of both expansion and
contraction, depending on the continent. Statistically significant contraction of Type 3 occurs
in Africa, Asia, Australia (RCP8.5 only), South America and globally, and is mainly due to the
encroachment of the more suitable Type 2 pattern into areas previously categorized as Type 3.
Significant northward expansion of Type 3 occurs in Europe and North America into areas
previously categorized as Type 4. Type 4 significantly expands poleward into previously
unsuitable areas in Asia, Europe and North America due to warmer temperatures, and expands
in mainland Australia (where temperatures are already suitable) due to increases in rainfall.
Type 4 significantly contracts in Africa (RCP4.5 only) and South America due to replacement
by more suitable types. Globally there is a statistically significant expansion of Types 1, 2, 4,
and BAll Types^ combined, and a contraction of Type 3. On a percentage basis, the BAll
Types^ expansion is 8–13 % globally depending on the RCP scenario, influenced by partic-
ularly large expansion of Type 1 (44–54 %) and Type 2 (15–33 %). In most cases where
expansion occurs, it is larger under the RCP8.5 scenario compared to RCP4.5.
3.3 Future changes in human exposure to Ae. aegypti
Figure 2 shows the projected number of persons exposed to Ae. aegypti globally for 2061–
2080 as a result of changes to the areal extents of the four occurrence patterns. Similar figures
for each of the 6 continents are in Online Resource 2. Table 3 accompanies Fig. 2 and presents
the changes numerically for BAll Types^ combined as well as for the difference between
RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, globally and for each continent. The GPW pathway assumes that
population does not change from year 2000 levels, and therefore isolates the specific impact
of climate change on persons exposed to Ae. aegypti. The GPW results for 2061–2080 are
largely consistent with the changes in areal extent discussed in the previous section; globally
the number of persons exposed increases for Types 1, 2, 4 and BAll Types^ and decreases for
Type 3. When population growth is accounted for in addition to climate change (the SSP3 and
SSP5 pathways), in nearly every instance changes in the number of persons exposed to Ae.
aegypti far exceed those due to climate change alone (GPW). Globally, the number of persons
exposed for the 1950–2000 reference period for BAll Types^ is 3794 million; this value
expands by 298 million (8 %) for the GPW case (climate change only), but by 4805 million
(127 %) and 2232 million (59 %) for the SSP3 and SSP5 pathways.
Changes in the number of persons exposed under SSP3 are larger than SSP5 for continents
primarily comprised of developing and middle-income countries (Africa, Asia and South
America) because population grows most rapidly in developing countries for the SSP3 pathway.
492
Climatic Change (2018) 146:487–500
 By contrast, for continents with predominantly industrialized countries (Australia, Europe and
North America), changes are largest for SSP5 because population grows most rapidly in indus-
trialized countries for this pathway. On a percentage basis, growth of persons exposed for the
climate change only pathway (GPW) is greatest for the continents with a large fraction of land in
the mid-latitudes: Australia, Europe and North America. For example, Europe exhibits particularly
large percentage growth in persons exposed to Ae. aegypti for the GPW pathway of 144 % for
RCP4.5 and 292 % for RCP8.5, and trails only much-larger Asia in terms of absolute growth.
Compared to RCP4.5, there is larger growth in the number of persons exposed under the
RCP8.5 scenario on all continents and for all 3 population pathways for BAll Types^ (Table 3).

 However, only for North America and Europe are the differences significant for all three
population pathways. The differences are insignificant for all three of the population pathways
for Africa, Asia and South America, where strong population growth far outweighs the impact
of climate change. For RCP8.5 an additional 162 (GPW), 279 (SSP3) and 251 (SSP5) million
persons globally would be exposed to Ae. aegypti compared to RCP4.5, equivalent to about 4–
7 % of the 3974 million people exposed for the 1950–2000 reference period, though only the
SSP5 changes are significant.
4 Discussion and conclusions
By 2061–2080, for both RCP scenarios, many regions already suitable for Ae. aegypti may
maintain or shift toward Type 1 and Type 2 occurrence patterns associated with greater
mosquito abundance for a longer annual duration. The areal extent of the Type 1 pattern is
projected to increase by 44–54 % globally, and Type 2 by 15–33 %, with the majority of
expansion in Africa, southern Asia and South America. Accordingly, the number of persons

all patterns combined (BAll Types^). Colored bars indicate the ensemble mean value, and the black lines at the
top of each bar indicate the range of values among ensemble members. To aid comparison, the bar colors for each
Type are identical to the colors used in the global extent map (Fig. 1a). Results are shown for the 2061–2080
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions and concentration scenarios for each of the three population pathways: GPW
2000, SSP3 2070 and SSP5 2070. Violet-colored solid horizontal lines on each panel indicate the population
affected for the 1950–2000 reference period, assuming the GPW 2000 population; the dashed violet lines are +/−

(insignificantly) different from the 1950–2000 reference period (p < 0.05)

 exposed to these more suitable Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns may increase substantially. For
example, the number of humans exposed to Ae. aegypti in 2061–2080 for the Type 1
pattern is projected to increase by about 35–45 % (GPW), 200–215 % (SSP3) and 115–
120 % (SSP5) from a present-day exposed population of about 230 million. Percentage
increases are similar for the Type 2 pattern. Comparing these results to the global BAll
Types^ increases in humans exposed by 2061–2080 of 8–12 % (GPW), 127–134 %
(SSP3), and 59–64 % (SSP5), it is evident that even climate change alone (the GPW
case), in the absence of population growth, leads to relatively large increases of these
more suitable occurrence patterns.
In regions that have marginal or no suitability in the present-day, by 2061–2080 a
shift toward enhanced seasonal suitability for Ae. aegypti is projected, particularly due to
the expansion of the Type 4 occurrence pattern into areas previously unsuitable for the
establishment of Ae. aegypti. The areal extent of the Type 4 pattern is projected to grow
by 8–18 % globally, but will likely grow at a more rapid rate at the cool mid-latitude
margins of present-day suitability, particularly in Europe (138–308 %). Consequently, the
number of Europeans exposed to Ae. aegypti in 2061–2080 for the Type 4 pattern is
projected to increase by about 140–265 % (GPW), 105–220 % (SSP3) and 240–400 %
(SSP5) from a present-day exposed population of 44 million. Therefore, in addition to
population change, by 2061–2080 climate change alone (the GPW case) may drive large
increases in the number of humans exposed seasonally to Ae. aegypti in areas that have
marginal present-day suitability.
We therefore find that within regions, for certain Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns, climate
change plays an important role in driving increases in human exposure to Ae. aegypti.
However, when considering human exposure to Ae. aegypti for all occurrence patterns
collectively, we find that climate change is a comparatively modest driver of increased
exposure relative to population growth globally and particularly for continents comprised
mainly of developing and middle income countries. For example, the average growth in the
population exposed to all Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns by 2061–2080 for Africa, Asia and
Table 3 Change in population for BAll Types^ of Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns for 2061–2080 versus 1950–

scenarios.*

 South America combined is 4–6 % for GPW (climate change only), compared to 161–165 %
for SSP3 and 70–72 % for SSP5 (pathways for which both climate change and population
growth are accounted for). As a result, the differences in human exposure to Ae. aegypti
between the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios are statistically insignificant for all
three continents for all three population pathways, meaning there is no apparent advantage to
taking the lower-emissions RCP4.5 pathway in terms of reducing human exposure to Ae.
aegypti in these regions. There are however, statistically significant differences between
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for North America and Europe for all three population pathways, and
globally for the SSP5 storyline, and thus in these regions there is an advantage to taking the
lower emissions RCP4.5 pathway, though it is still modest compared to overall changes in
exposure due to population growth.
Total population growth in developing and middle income countries in Africa, Asia and
South America is greater for the SSP3 (BRegional Rivalry^) pathway compared to the SSP5
(BFossil-fueled Development^) pathway, due to more rapidly declining birthrates in develop-
ing and middle income countries for SSP5 (O’Neill et al. 2015). Conversely, population
growth is larger in developed countries in Australia, Europe and North America for SSP5,
driven by urbanization. As a result, human exposure to Ae. aegypti increases most for the SSP3
pathway in Africa, Asia and South America, whereas it increases most for the SSP5 pathway
in Australia and Europe (and is about the same for either pathway in North America due to
developing and middle income countries in Central America versus the developed United
States). These are important distinctions because SSP3 and SSP5 also differ in dimensions not
directly included in our modeling results, but that would be expected to affect the extent of
future outbreaks of dengue and their control. SSP3 is a world with weak investments in health,
institutions, and research and development with a declining ability to identify, communicate,
prevent and manage dengue outbreaks (Ebi 2013). Most urban growth in low-income coun-
tries is in unplanned settlements, with limited attention to increasing access to safe water and
improved sanitation, implying increases in the number of possible breeding sites for Ae.
aegypti. On the other hand, SSP5 is a world with strong investments in health, education,
institutions, and research and development with the capacity and political will to prepare
for, prevent and manage dengue outbreaks (Ebi 2013), even though enhanced global
trade networks (and presumably transportation infrastructure) may facilitate the expan-
sion and/or reintroduction of Ae. aegypti into marginally suitable areas. Significant
progress is achieved in improving access to safe water and improved sanitation, thus
reducing breeding grounds for Ae. aegypti. These distinctions imply that the more
vulnerable developing and middle income countries in Africa, Asia and South America
may be disproportionately impacted under the SSP3 pathway, not only because more
humans in these countries would be exposed to Ae. aegypti under SSP3, but also because
of comparatively diminished capacity to mitigate dengue risk.
The analysis is subject to a number of model and data limitations. We employ a simple
modeling approach for Ae. aegypti occurrence based on long-term monthly and annual average
temperature and precipitation thresholds. This approach does not directly address important
complex system interactions related to Ae. aegypti ecology, development, behavior and
survival that occur on shorter timescales, and that more sophisticated process-based modeling
approaches may resolve (e.g., Focks et al. 1993; Morin et al. 2015). For example, several
climatic processes known to impact Ae. aegypti life-history traits are not represented, such as
rainfall intensity (Koenraadt and Harrington 2008), diurnal temperature variability (Carrington
et al. 2013) and upper temperature limits (Williams et al. 2014). Our approach also neglects

497
 microclimatic impacts that may buffer mosquitoes from temperature and precipitation ex-
tremes (Kearney et al. 2009). It is noteworthy that while the projections of populations exposed
to Ae. aegypti (Fig. 2 and Table 3) apply only to areas that are inhabited by humans, our
calculations of the areal extent of occurrence patterns (Fig. 1 and Table 2) are independent of
population and thus imply suitability in some uninhabited regions. Only results from the
CESM AOGCM are used, an approach that does not allow inter-model uncertainty to be
estimated (CESM is one of about 20 CMIP5 AOGCMs). The SSP population projections are
subject to numerous sources of uncertainty, not the least the unknown geopolitical landscape of
the future (O’Neill et al. 2015).
Other study limitations are related to human and mosquito behavior. Aedes aegypti is highly
dependent on human behavior for finding suitable container habitats, shade, and shelter (e.g.,
Eisen et al. 2014). For example, a study in San Juan, Puerto Rico found that most Ae. aegypti
pupae were produced in human-managed containers (Barrera et al. 2011). How such behav-
ioral factors may change in the future is unaccounted for. Interspecies competition among Ae.
aegypti and other mosquitoes may affect the rate and extent of range expansion; for example, it
has been suggested that Ae. albopictus may reduce or displace Ae. aegypti populations in
regions of the United States, Brazil and Thailand where both species co-occur (Moji et al.
1988; Lounibos et al. 2002; Braks et al. 2004). How human interventions aimed at reducing
Ae. aegypti populations may change in the future is unknown. For example, controversial
releases of genetically-modified Bsterile^ male mosquitoes (Ernst et al. 2015) may become
more common in the future, and, if they do, would differ between the SSPs. Additionally, how
other human factors such as cultural practices, water access, urbanization, transportation
networks and global trade may evolve and impact the spread of Ae. aegypti is unclear
(Mackenzie et al. 2004). Gubler (2002) notes that a resurgence of dengue (likely linked to
the proliferation of Ae. aegypti) over the past half century is associated with the establishment
of peri-urban shantytowns that lack reliable water and sewer services, as well as a large
increase in international transportation.
Finally, it is noteworthy that increases in population exposure to Ae. aegypti do not
necessarily translate into increased risk for dengue or chikungunya virus transmission, due
to other factors such as the potential for a vaccine to be developed (Thomas 2015), and other
climatic impacts on mosquito ecology (Patz et al. 1998; Liu-Helmersson et al. 2014). Despite
these caveats, numerous studies project that 21st century climate change may, overall, facilitate
enhanced dengue transmission (Hopp and Foley 2001; Hales et al. 2002; Colón-González et al.
2013, Bouzid et al. 2014).
We conclude that both climate change and population growth may increase human
exposure to the virus vector mosquito Ae. aegypti by the late 21st century. The global
population is projected to grow from year 2000 levels of 6053 million (GPW) to 11,143
million for SSP3 or 8468 million for SSP5 by 2070. The percentage of this total global
population exposed to Ae. aegypti for the reference 1950–2000 case is 63 %, a value projected
to increase to 68–70 % by 2061–2080 if population is held constant (GPW; i.e., climate change
only), to 77–80 % for SSP3 and to 71–74 % for SSP5. Developing economies in tropical and
subtropical Africa, southern Asia and South America may be particularly impacted by the
expansion of year-round Ae. aegypti occurrence patterns, whereas industrialized mid-latitude
economies may be impacted by the expansion of seasonal occurrence patterns. The benefits of
reduced anthropogenic climate change on human exposure to Ae. aegypti due to taking the
RCP4.5 emissions scenario instead of the RCP8.5 scenario may be more pronounced in
industrialized countries than in developing and middle income countries.
