espite advances in the treatment and prevention of car-
diovascular disease and a reduction in total cardiovas-
cular mortality, the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) 
remains high. In the United States, 180 000 to 450 000 people 
die suddenly each year,1 and in up to half of SCDs, cardiac 
arrest is the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease.2 
Effective, low-cost, noninvasive, and readily available tools to 
identify individuals at increased SCD risk are therefore neces-
sary to optimally target primary prevention interventions and 
to decrease SCD incidence.
Clinical Perspective on p 2234
Background—Asymptomatic individuals account for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs). Development of 
effective, low-cost, and noninvasive SCD risk stratification tools is necessary.
Methods and Results—Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and Cardiovascular Health Study 
(n=20 177; age, 59.3±10.1 years; age range, 44–100 years; 56% female; 77% white) were followed up for 14.0 years (median). 
Five ECG markers of global electric heterogeneity (GEH; sum absolute QRST integral, spatial QRST angle, spatial ventricular 
gradient [SVG] magnitude, SVG elevation, and SVG azimuth) were measured on standard 12-lead ECGs. Cox proportional 
hazards and competing risks models evaluated associations between GEH electrocardiographic parameters and SCD. An SCD 
competing risks score was derived from demographics, comorbidities, and GEH parameters. SCD incidence was 1.86 per 1000 
person-years. After multivariable adjustment, baseline GEH parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were 
independently associated with SCD. Final SCD risk scores included age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary 
heart disease, stroke, and GEH parameters as continuous variables. When GEH parameters were added to clinical/demographic 
factors, the C statistic increased from 0.777 to 0.790 (P=0.008), the risk score classified 10-year SCD risk as high (>5%) in 
7.2% of participants, 10% of SCD victims were appropriately reclassified into a high-risk category, and only 1.4% of SCD 
victims were inappropriately reclassified from high to intermediate risk. The net reclassification index was 18.3%.
Conclusions—Abnormal electrophysiological substrate quantified by GEH parameters is independently associated with 
SCD in the general population. The addition of GEH parameters to clinical characteristics improves SCD risk prediction.

Arrhythmia/Electrophysiology
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 4, 2019
 Waks et al  Global Electric Heterogeneity and Sudden Cardiac Death  2223
In the general population, SCD is related primarily to 
coronary heart disease (CHD)2 and ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias.3,4 Fundamental studies in electrophysiology have 
demonstrated that susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is 
characterized by heterogeneity in myocardial activation and 
recovery times4,5 and action potential morphology,6,7 which 
can be detected on QRST integral maps.8,9 Noninvasive assess-
ment of cardiac electric heterogeneity is therefore a promising 
method of assessing SCD risk.
In the 1930s, Wilson et al10 developed the concept of an 
arithmetically summed area under the QRS complex and T 
wave as a measure of the net electric effect produced by local 
variations in the duration of the excited state. Wilson et al cal-
culated the vectorial sum of the QRS and T vectors, defined 
as the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG), to determine the 
direction along which nonuniformity in excitation and repo-
larization was greatest10 and the duration of the excited state 
was shortest.11 Subsequent experimental and theoretical inves-
tigations demonstrated that the SVG is related to global het-
erogeneity of both action potential duration and morphology.7 
The concept underlying the SVG was extended to the spatial 
QRS-T angle, the 3-dimensional angle between the QRS and 
T vectors,12 and the sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST), 
a scalar analog of the SVG calculated as the absolute value 
of the area under the QRS complex and T wave.13–15 These 
electrocardiographic parameters have been associated with 
ventricular arrhythmia in high-risk individuals,14,16 but their 
association with SCD in the general population and their util-
ity in SCD risk stratification remain unclear.
We hypothesized that markers of myocardial global elec-
tric heterogeneity (GEH; SVG, spatial QRS-T angle, and SAI 
QRST) would be independently associated with SCD and that 
they would improve SCD risk prediction in the general popu-
lation beyond clinical and demographic characteristics.
Methods
Study Populations
To obtain widely generalizable results, we merged 2 large, biracial, 
prospective, community-dwelling adult cohorts. The Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an ongoing, prospective cohort 
study assessing risk factors, progression, and outcomes of atheroscle-
rosis in 15 792 community participants (45% male, 74% white) 45 
to 64 years of age recruited from 4 US communities between 1987 
and 1989. Details of ARIC enrollment and study procedures have 
previously been given.17 Black participants in the Washington and 
Minnesota cohorts (n=55) and participants with reported race other 
than white or black (n=48), uninterpretable ECGs (n=344), or miss-
ing covariates (n=736) were excluded. The final ARIC study popula-
tion included 14 609 participants.
The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is an ongoing, prospec-
tive cohort study assessing risk factors, progression, and outcomes 
of CHD and stroke in 5888 community participants 65 to 100 years 
of age (42% male, 85% white) recruited from 4 US communities. 
During 1989 to 1990, 5201 participants were enrolled, and in 1992 
to 1993, a second cohort of 687 blacks was recruited. Details of 
CHS enrollment and study procedures have previously been pub-
lished.18 After the exclusion of participants with reported race other 
than white or black (n=39), uninterpretable ECGs (n=87), or missing 
covariates (n=194), the final CHS study population included 5568 
participants.
Together, the 2 cohorts included 20 177 adults (mean age, 
59.3±10.1 years; range, 44–100 years; 44.1% male; 77.3% white). 
Both studies were approved by the institutional review boards of all 
participating institutions, and all participants gave informed con-
sent. Definitions of covariates and incident nonfatal cardiovascular 
events are provided in the Methods section of the online-only Data 
Supplement.
ECG Recording, Analysis, and Measurement of 
GEH Parameters
Recording and processing of 12-lead ECGs were identical in 
ARIC and CHS. Standard 10-second 12-lead ECGs were digi-
tally acquired at a sampling rate of 500 Hz and amplitude reso-
lution of 1µV with MAC personal computer electrocardiographs 
(Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, WI) and were automatically 
processed with the GE Magellan research utility (GE Marquette, 
Milwaukee, WI) to measure amplitudes and intervals. The 12-lead 
ECGs were digitally recorded at study enrollment and during 
follow-up: yearly in the CHS cohort and triennially in the ARIC 
cohort. To evaluate longitudinal ECG changes, we analyzed ECGs 
at up to 10 visits in CHS participants and at up to 4 visits in ARIC 
participants.
A detailed description of GEH parameter measurement is pro-
vided in the Methods section of the online-only Data Supplement. 
SAI QRST was measured as the arithmetic sum of areas under the 
QRST curve as previously described13,15 (Figure 1A). Spatial mean 
QRS-T angle was defined as the 3-dimensional angle between the 
mean QRS vector and the mean T vector (Figure 1B) as previously 
described.12 SVG represents a vector in 3-dimensional space defined 
by the vectorial sum of the QRS vector and the T vector (Figure 1B). 
The magnitude, azimuth, and elevation of the SVG vector were mea-
sured (Figure 1C).
Heart rate, corrected QT interval, and QRS duration were mea-
sured by the GE 12SL algorithm (GE Marquette). Sex-specific 
Cornell product was calculated for the assessment of ECG left ven-
tricular hypertrophy.19
Patient Follow-Up and SCD Adjudication
Follow-up of ARIC participants included annual telephone calls, local 
hospital surveillance, 3 triennial visits through 1998, and a search of 
the Social Security Death Index; details of follow-up have previously 
been reported.20 CHS follow-up included semiannual alternating 
phone calls and clinic visits through 1999 with twice-yearly phone 
calls thereafter, review of Medicare hospitalization records, and a 
search of the Social Security Death Index; details of follow-up have 
previously been reported.21
The primary outcome of this analysis was SCD, which was 
similarly adjudicated in ARIC and CHS. SCD was defined as a sud-
den pulseless condition presumed to be attributable to a ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual without evidence 
of a noncardiac cause of cardiac arrest. We a priori sought to exclude 
patients with nonarrhythmic characteristics, including those with evi-
dence of progressive hypotension or advanced decompensated heart 
failure (HF) before death. All SCD events in this analysis occurred 
out of the hospital or in a hospital emergency department. A detailed 
description of SCD adjudication is provided in the Methods section 
in the online-only Data Supplement.
Participants were censored at time of loss to follow-up or death if 
the cause of death was not SCD. Administrative censoring occurred 
on July 31, 2006, for CHS and December 31, 2001, for ARIC.
Statistical Analysis
A detailed description of our statistical methods is provided in the 
online-only Data Supplement. In brief, we conducted the following 
analyses.
Association Between GEH Parameters and Baseline 
Characteristics
Minimally adjusted linear regression was used to determine associa-
tions between baseline demographic, clinical, and traditional ECG 
characteristics and GEH parameters. Circular variables (SVG azi-
muth and elevation) were analyzed with circular statistics.

Association Between GEH Parameters and SCD
Cox proportional hazards and competing risks models quantified 
associations between individual GEH parameters treated as continu-
ous variables and SCD. Given that there are no prior data demon-
strating the association between GEH parameters and SCD in the 
general population, we constructed 4 models designed to assess the 
magnitude and significance of association between each GEH param-
eter and SCD as additional potential confounders were sequentially 
added. Model 1 adjusted for demographic characteristics (age, sex, 
race, and study cohort/center). Model 2 additionally adjusted for 
Figure 1. Measurement of global electric heterogeneity (GEH) parameters. A, Sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) represents the sum 
of the area under the QRS complex and T wave with the isoelectric line used as the reference (shaded area). x-, y-, and z-lead QRS-T 
complexes and their calculated SAI QRST results are shown. B, Spatial QRS-T angle represents the angle between the QRS vector and 
T vector in 3-dimensional space. C, Spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) is a vector defined as the vectorial sum of the QRS vector and the 
T vector. SVG magnitude is the length of the SVG vector. SVG azimuth is the angle of the SVG vector projected onto the xy (horizontal) 
plane, and SVG elevation is the angle of the SVG-vector projected in the xz (vertical) plane.

prevalent cardiovascular disease and traditional cardiovascular risk 
factors (CHD, HF, stroke, atrial fibrillation, β-blockers, creatinine, 
body mass index, hypertension, antihypertensive medications, diabe-
tes mellitus, smoking status, alcohol intake, total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and physical activity 
index). Model 3 further adjusted for electrocardiographic parameters 
associated with SCD (heart rate, corrected QT, QRS duration, sex-
specific Cornell product, and bundle-branch block, or intraventric-
ular conduction delay). Model 4 evaluated whether the association 
of GEH parameters with SCD remained significant over time and 
included all baseline covariates included in model 3, time-updated 
GEH parameters, time-updated traditional electrocardiographic mea-
surements, and time-updated incident nonfatal cardiovascular events 
(atrial fibrillation, HF, CHD, and stroke). Because information on 
baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was not available 
for ARIC participants, sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of 
adding LVEF into fully adjusted and time-updated models in 4954 
CHS participants. Subgroup analysis was performed in model 3 to 
determine significant interactions between GEH parameters and clin-
ical characteristics.
Definition of Abnormal GEH Parameters
Sex- and race-specific thresholds defining abnormal GEH parameter 
values were selected with the use of the Youden index22 to maximize 
the sum of sensitivity and specificity. A competing risks model was 
constructed to determine the incremental SCD risk associated with 
multiple “abnormal” GEH parameters.
Longitudinal Changes in GEH Parameters Over Time and 
SCD Risk
Mixed-effect multilevel models (adjusted by age, sex, and race 
with participants nested within study center nested within cohort) 
were constructed to determine whether GEH parameters changed 
over time. To investigate whether longitudinal changes in GEH 
parameters were independently associated with SCD, the interac-
tion with time was assessed in time-updated Cox models to test 
the assumption of proportionality for the hazard of time-updated 
variables over time. In addition, separate Cox proportional haz-
ards models were used to determine whether large increases in 
GEH parameters between study visits 1 and 3 were associated 
with SCD.
Schoenfeld residuals confirmed that the proportional hazards 
assumption was valid in all Cox proportional hazards models.
Risk Score Development
We constructed 2 SCD risk scores using the Fine and Gray compet-
ing risks model to test the incremental predictive value of adding 
GEH parameters as continuous variables to clinical characteristics. A 
combination of clinical guidance and backward selection was used to 
select covariates for inclusion in the final risk score models. To allow 
wider applicability of the risk score, we initially assessed clinically 
important covariates from model 3 (see Methods in the online-only 
Data Supplement). The final clinical-only SCD risk score included 
known SCD risk factors: age, sex, race, CHD, stroke, diabetes mel-
litus, and hypertension.
The combined clinical+GEH score was initially developed with 
covariates from the clinical-only score, all 5 GEH parameters, and 
all significant interaction terms. Backward selection was then per-
formed with a cutoff value of P=0.10. The final model included 
age, sex, race, CHD, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, SAI 
QRST, spatial QRS-T angle, SVG elevation, and interaction terms 
(SAI QRST×age, QRS-T angle×age, QRS-T angle×race, QRS-T 
angle×diabetes mellitus, QRS-T angle×hypertension, and SVG 
azimuth×sex). Weighting of the contribution of each variable to 
SCD risk was determined by the relative size of effect estimates. A 
cumulative incidence function was used to assign 10-year SCD risk 
to each participant on the basis of their individual clinical-only and 
clinical+GEH risk scores.
All statistical analyses were performed with STATA 14 (StataCorp 
LP, College Station, TX) and Oriana-Circular Statistics version 4 
(Kovach Computing Services, Pentraeth, Wales, UK).
Results
Associations of Baseline Clinical and Traditional 
ECG Characteristics With GEH Parameters
Baseline characteristics and incident nonfatal cardiovascular 
events are shown in Table 1. Associations between baseline 
clinical and ECG characteristics and the 5 measures of GEH 
are shown in Tables I through III in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Abnormal LVEF was positively associated with 
all GEH parameters. Prevalent CHD was positively associated 
with all GEH parameters except SVG magnitude, for which a 
strong inverse association was observed.
Association Between GEH Parameters and SCD
Among ARIC participants, over a median follow-up of 14.1 
years, 291 SCDs occurred (incidence, 1.48 [95% confidence 
interval, 1.32–1.66] per 1000 person-years). Among CHS 
participants, over median follow-up of 13.1 years, 195 SCDs 
occurred (incidence, 3.00 [95% confidence interval, 2.61–
3.45] per 1000 person-years). In the combined cohort, over 
median follow-up of 14.0 years, 486 SCDs occurred (inci-
dence, 1.86 [95% confidence interval, 1.70–2.03] per 1000 
person-years). SCD accounted for 7.56% of all deaths in the 
combined cohort.
Table 2 shows the associations between GEH parameters 
and SCD risk in Cox proportional hazards models 1 through 4. 
In model 2, all 5 GEH parameters were associated with SCD. 
Figure 2 shows the hazard of SCD over the range of GEH 
parameter values, relative to the mean value, when quadratic 
splines were used to characterize the relationship between 
GEH parameters and SCD risk. In adjusted analyses, there was 
a dose-response relationship between GEH parameters and 
SCD. Further adjustment for baseline electrocardiographic 
parameters (model 3) and time-updated ECG/GEH measure-
ments and incident nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes (model 
4) revealed minimal change in the magnitude of association 
between SAI QRST, QRS-T angle, and SVG magnitude and 
SCD, although the associations between SVG elevation/azi-
muth and SCD were attenuated. In sensitivity analyses explor-
ing the importance of adding LVEF to fully adjusted models 
(Table 2), the addition of baseline LVEF did not substantially 
change the magnitude or significance of association between 
any GEH parameter and SCD. Competing risks models 
revealed similar associations between GEH parameters and 
SCD (Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
Longitudinal Changes in GEH Parameters and 
SCD Risk
Mixed effects models revealed that over time values of SAI 
QRST, QRS-T angle, SVG elevation, and SVG azimuth 
increased and values of SVG magnitude decreased in a sta-
tistically significant manner (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Importantly, the overall magnitude of changes 
in GEH parameters, however, was small: for example, <1° 
of the QRS-T angle and <1 mV·ms of SAI QRST between 
2 visits (median, 2.8 years). In time-updated Cox models, 
there were no significant interactions between time and time-
updated SAI QRST (P=0.436), QRS-T angle (P=0.189), 
SVG magnitude (P=0.083), SVG elevation (P=0.982), and

SVG azimuth (P=0.534), and the assumption of proportional 
hazards was confirmed in all time-updated Cox regression 
models. Therefore, there was no evidence of change in the 
association between SCD risk and GEH parameters over time; 
small changes in GEH parameters over time were not associ-
ated with additional SCD risk.
However, large, sudden increases in GEH parameters 
(≥50% for SAI QRST and SVG magnitude, elevation, and 
azimuth; ≥3-fold for QRS-T angle) were independently asso-
ciated with SCD after adjustment for all other covariates, inci-
dent nonfatal CVD events, and baseline GEH parameter values 
(Table VI and Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
There was a dose-dependent increase in SCD proportional to 
the increase in GEH parameter values between baseline and 
study visit 2 or 3.
Subgroup Analyses
The strength of association between SAI QRST and spatial 
QRS-T angle and SCD decreased with increasing age (Table 
VII in the online-only Data Supplement). QRS-T angle had a 
stronger association with SCD in white participants and par-
ticipants free of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. SAI QRST

had a stronger association with SCD in women. There was no 
significant interaction with ventricular pacing or the presence 
bundle-branch block/intraventricular conduction delay.
Dichotomized GEH Parameters and SCD Risk
The optimal sex- and race-stratified cutoff points for GEH 
parameters, as calculated by the Youden index, are reported in 
Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement. As the number 
of abnormal GEH parameters increased from 0 to 5, the rate 
of SCD increased from 0.5% to 12.0% (Figure 3), and the 
percent of all SCDs increased from 2.4% to 17.6% (Figure 
II in the online-only Data Supplement). In an unadjusted 
competing risks model, participants with 5 abnormal GEH 
parameters had a subhazard ratio for SCD of 25.4 (95% con-
fidence interval, 14.6–44.1; P<0.0001) compared with those 
with 0 abnormal parameters.
Development of SCD Risk Scores
Table 3 describes the final SCD risk scores. Significant 
improvement in SCD risk prediction was seen with the addi-
tion of GEH parameters and appropriate interaction terms. 
The clinical-only risk score predicted 10-year cumulative 
SCD incidence between 0.44% and 42.14%, whereas the 
clinical+GEH risk score assigned participants to a wider range

of 10-year SCD risk (0.05%–55.12%). The clinical+GEH 
score C statistic was significantly higher than the clinical-
only C statistic (0.790 versus 0.777; P=0.008), although the 
magnitude of the difference was small. Additionally, despite 
the increased complexity, goodness of fit of the clinical+GEH 
score was better than that of the clinical-only score, as 
shown by a smaller Akaike information criterion. The full 
clinical+GEH SCD risk score equation and an interactive risk 
calculator are available in the online-only Data Supplement 
and at http://www.ecgpredictscd.org/.
Performance of the Clinical+GEH SCD Risk Score
Internal Cross-Validation and Calibration
The clinical+GEH risk score was well calibrated for SCD 
events, with similar predicted and observed rates of SCD 
(Table IX in the online-only Data Supplement and Figure 4A).
No significant differences between C statistics in the 5 
internal cross-validation partitions were observed for the clin-
ical-only risk score (C statistic range, 0.746–0.806; P=0.29) 
or the clinical+GEH risk score (C statistic range, 0.762–0.811; 
P=0.53). Figure 4B shows results of cross-validation of the 
clinical+GEH score in 5 partitions of the study cohort.
Stratification Capacity
Risk stratification capacity of the clinical+GEH score is 
shown in Table 4 and Tables X and XI in the online-only 
Data Supplement. Compared with the clinical-only score, 
the clinical+GEH score classified twice as many participants 
(24.1% versus 11.9%) as low risk (10-year SCD risk <0.5%), 
fewer participants (68.7% versus 82.0%) as intermediate risk 
(10-year SCD risk, 1%–5%), and more participants (7.2% 
versus 6.2%) as high risk (10-year SCD risk >5%). Overall, 
35.8% of SCD victims were identified as high risk by the 
clinical+GEH risk score, whereas the clinical-only score iden-
tified only 27.4% of SCD victims as high risk. Only 6.5% of 
participants without SCD events were identified as high risk 
by the clinical+GEH score.
Reclassification Improvement
Table 4 also demonstrates that, with the addition of GEH 
parameters, 50 of 486 SCD victims (10.3%) were appropriately 
reclassified into a higher-risk category, and almost all of these 
participants (49 out of 50) were appropriately reclassified 
from intermediate risk to high risk. Overall, 14.9% of SCD-
free participants were appropriately reclassified from inter-
mediate risk to low risk. Only 8 of 486 SCD victims (1.7%) 
were inappropriately reclassified from high risk to intermedi-
ate risk, and no SCD victims were inappropriately reclassi-
fied from high risk to low risk. Net reclassification index was 
18.3%, with an event net reclassification index of 6.6% and a 
nonevent net reclassification index of 11.7%.
The addition of GEH parameters also improved SCD-
specific risk prediction (Table 4). The proportion of all 
SCDs decreased from 6.1% to 2.8% in the low-risk groups 
and increased from 14.7% to 16.4% in the high-risk groups. 
Among participants with a predicted 10-year SCD risk of 
>10%, 1 of every 4 deaths was an SCD (Table X in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Classification Tests
A high-risk clinical+GEH score predicted SCD with 35.8% 
sensitivity, 93.6% specificity, 98.3% negative predictive value, 
and 12.1% positive predictive value. A combined high or 
intermediate risk score predicted SCD with improved sensi-
tivity (96.9%) at the cost of reduced specificity (24.7%) and 
retained a very high negative predictive value (99.7%).
Clinical+GEH Risk Score Performance in Subgroups
As shown in Table XII in the online-only Data Supplement, 
the risk score also performed well in the subgroup of patients 
with abnormal intraventricular conduction (bundle-branch 
block/intraventricular conduction delay; n=2328). In this 
group, assessment of GEH appropriately reclassified 29.4% 
of SCD victims (all intermediate risk to high risk), and no 
patients with SCD were inappropriately reclassified into a 
lower-risk category. Importantly, 64.1% of SCD victims were 
appropriately identified as high risk. In a small subgroup of 
participants with ECGs analyzed during ventricular pacing 
(n=47), assessment of GEH appropriately reclassified 33% of 
SCD victims and identified 5 of 6 SCD victims (83%; Table 
XIII in the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
Analysis of this large, community-based, biracial prospective 
cohort of >20 100 participants with a wide age range revealed 
several important findings. First, we demonstrated an inde-
pendent association of GEH with SCD. GEH electrocardio-
graphic parameters remained independently associated with 
SCD after adjustment for multiple known SCD risk factors, 
time-updated ECG measurements, and time-updated incident 
nonfatal cardiovascular events. GEH parameters selectively 
predicted SCD over nonsudden fatal CHD and noncardiac 
death in competing risks models, suggesting that abnor-
mal GEH parameters selectively identified participants with 
abnormal electrophysiological substrate rather than simply 
identifying a sicker population with structural heart disease. 
Moreover, each GEH parameter provided additive infor-
mation on SCD risk. The complementary nature of SVG, 
QRS-T angle, and SAI QRST is expected because each of 
these measures represents distinct ways of quantifying GEH. 
Large increases in GEH parameters over short periods of time

number of abnormal dichotomized global electric heterogeneity 
(GEH) parameters, with each parameter given equal weight.

were also associated with increased SCD risk. Decreases in 
GEH parameters were not associated with reduced SCD risk, 
but given that relatively few participants experienced large 
decreases in GEH parameters, this study may be underpow-
ered to detect a reduction in SCD risk in these subgroups.
Importantly, there was no significant change in the magni-
tude or significance of association between GEH parameters 
and SCD when LVEF was included in the models, suggest-
ing that, although GEH parameters are associated with LVEF, 
their association with SCD is independent of the degree of left 
ventricular dysfunction. The finding that GEH parameters are 
independently associated with SCD highlights the importance 
of including electrophysiological markers in SCD risk strati-
fication models and future investigation of heritable genetic 
mechanisms underlying increased GEH.
Second, we developed a competing risks SCD risk score 
that combined clinical/demographic SCD risk factors with 
GEH parameters. The risk score identified a small subgroup 
of individuals with a high risk of SCD over 10 years of follow-
up among a study population with an overall low SCD risk. 
The risk score was cross-validated internally. Our results open 
a new avenue for risk stratification and primary prevention of 
SCD, although validation in prospective studies is needed, and 
the optimal management/treatment of high-risk individuals 
requires further study.
SCD Risk Score Development and Performance
Development of an accurate and easily deployable SCD risk 
score is an important goal,23 and no SCD risk scores are available 
for use in the general population. Several SCD risk scores have 
been proposed (including the Muerte Subita en Insuficiencia 
Cardiaca [MUSIC; Sudden Death in Heart Failure] score,24 The 
Multicenter UnSustained Tachycardia Trial [MUSTT] score,25 
and Duke score26), yet none has performed well enough for 
widespread clinical application. Many SCD risk scores are spe-
cific for patients with reduced LVEF, and an important limitation 
is that factors associated with SCD are also associated with non-
sudden death caused by progressive HF. Importantly, our SCD 
risk score considered competing risks of nonsudden fatal CHD 
and noncardiac death. This approach allowed us to demonstrate 
that our risk score is specific for SCD over other modes of death, 
likely as a result of our ability to identify abnormal electrophysi-
ological substrate with inclusion of GEH parameters.
Our risk score performed well in identifying individuals 
with a high risk of SCD from an overall low-risk community 
population. Population screening tests are often designed to 
be highly sensitive at the expense of specificity; initial false-
positive tests are accepted if specific confirmatory tests are 
available. In the case of SCD, however, no specific tests are 
available that could confirm the results of a highly sensitive 
and poorly specific screening test. Thus, for screening for and

risk stratification of SCD in the general population, a highly 
specific test is desirable.
It is important to consider that abnormal GEH by itself is 
not responsible for the onset of ventricular arrhythmias or SCD. 
Even with myocardial electrophysiological substrate favor-
able for ventricular arrhythmias, a triggering event is required. 
Thus, it is not surprising that there might be significant delay in 
the onset of SCD even in patients with significantly abnormal 
GEH parameters. This offers an opportunity for intervention.
Our finding of improved reclassification of SCD risk in 
a small subgroup of participants with ventricularly paced 
ECGs or bundle-branch block/intraventricular conduction 
delay supports the Wilson et al10 hypothesis that variability in 
GEH can be detected independently of the ventricular activa-
tion sequence. The SVG reflects heterogeneity of activation 
(and secondary heterogeneity of repolarization) across the 
myocardium that is independent of the myocardial activation 
sequence. It is often assumed that ventricularly paced ECGs do 
not provide useful information beyond the presence of pacing. 
Our results, although limited by small numbers, tend to refute 
this assumption. Ventricular pacing introduces electric dyssyn-
chrony and heterogeneity, which are reflected by larger GEH 
parameters compared with ECGs recorded during native ven-
tricular activation. Despite the overall pacing-induced increase 
in GEH, however, assessment of GEH parameters during pac-
ing still improved SCD reclassification in this subgroup. Further 
study of GEH in patients with ventricular pacing is warranted.
Clinical Application of the SCD Risk Score
Beyond treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, there are 
no accepted interventions specifically for the primary pre-
vention of SCD in the general population. Prediction and 
prevention of SCD, however, are interconnected in that 
the development of effective SCD prevention requires the 
availability of effective SCD risk prediction tools. Although 
measurement of GEH parameters is not currently readily 
available, existing 12-lead ECG systems could easily report 
their values with minimal additional software modification. 
A 2-step strategy, however, may also be reasonable: The 
clinical-only SCD score could be easily evaluated without

the need for laboratory tests or an ECG, and individuals 
with elevated clinical-only SCD risk could then undergo 
further risk stratification via measurement of GEH electro-
cardiographic parameters.
Individuals identified as at extremely high risk for SCD 
(such as those with 10-year SCD risk >10%) might be 
appropriate candidates for future randomized, controlled 
trials investigating expanded indications for implantable

cardioverter-defibrillators. Those with more modest risk 
might be targeted for aggressive diagnosis and treatment of 
subclinical heart disease. Patients with large increases in GEH 
parameters in the short term might also be similarly targeted 
with aggressive cardiovascular risk modification.
There is growing recognition27 that approximately half of 
sudden cardiac arrest victims have warning symptoms before 
their index event, but most symptoms are ignored, likely because 
only one third of sudden cardiac arrest victims have previously 
been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Implementation of 
our risk score would enable early identification of individuals at 
increased SCD risk, which, in turn, could also improve education 
and awareness of SCD risk factors and warning signs. Simply 
having high-risk individuals recognize their increased SCD risk 
could improve sudden cardiac arrest survival by increasing rates 
of seeking medical attention at the onset of cardiac symptoms.27
Strengths and Limitations
We developed our SCD risk score in 2 large, biracial, prospec-
tive cohorts encompassing a wide age range. Our risk score is 
therefore likely to be widely generalizable. However, the study 
does have limitations. The definition of covariates was slightly 
different in each cohort. We adjusted for multiple SCD con-
founders, but it is possible that residual confounding influenced 
the results. Information on LVEF, which has been associated 
with SCD, was available only in the CHS cohort and therefore 
could not be included in the final risk score. However, the addi-
tion of LVEF in time-updated models did not alter the associa-
tion between GEH parameters and SCD. One possible reason 
for this observation is that LVEF is normal in the vast majority 
of the general population. Additionally, although HF was asso-
ciated with SCD in minimally adjusted analyses, after multi-
variable adjustment, HF was not a significant predictor of SCD 
in the study population, and according to our procedure for 
backward selection, it was removed from the final risk score.
Patients who experienced sudden cardiac arrest but who were 
successfully resuscitated and survived to hospital discharge were 
not considered cases of SCD in this analysis. However, because 
survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is rare,27 it is unlikely 
that this significantly affected the results. Finally, although 
all deaths were thoroughly adjudicated, we cannot determine 
whether some SCDs were due primarily to bradyarrhythmias as 
opposed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, because sud-
den cardiac arrest caused by bradyarrhythmia is frequently the 
result of pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, 
GEH might still be associated with SCD in these patients. This 
phenomenon requires further study.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Despite advances in treatment and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, sudden cardiac death (SCD) incidence 
remains high, and SCD is frequently the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease. Development of a noninvasive, inex-
pensive, and easy-to-use SCD risk score for use in the general population is an important goal. In this study, we assessed 
5 ECG measures of myocardial global electric heterogeneity (GEH)—sum absolute QRST integral, spatial QRS-T angle, 
and spatial ventricular gradient (magnitude, azimuth, and elevation)—in 20 177 participants in the community-based 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). We demonstrated that baseline 
GEH electrocardiographic parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were independently associated with 
SCD and that assessment of multiple GEH electrocardiographic parameters provided additive/complementary information 
on SCD risk. We developed a novel SCD risk score that used readily available clinical characteristics (age, sex, race, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and coronary heart disease) and GEH electrocardiographic parameters. We demonstrated 
that the risk score was highly specific for SCD and that the addition of GEH electrocardiographic parameters to clinical 
characteristics significantly improved SCD risk prediction, likely because GEH electrocardiographic parameters identified 
participants with myocardial electric substrate favorable for ventricular arrhythmias. Our study represents an important step 
forward in understanding SCD risk factors and identifying people in the general population with elevated SCD risk who 
might be targeted for future SCD risk reduction strategies. The genetic basis of abnormal myocardial electric heterogeneity, 
as expressed by abnormal GEH electrocardiographic parameters, also warrants further study.
