Research in Context 
Evidence before this study 
Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors such as canagliflozin reduce glucose levels, 
blood pressure, body weight and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, all of which suggest 
they might have protective effects on the kidney. The analyses of effects on the exploratory renal 
outcomes from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial suggested that empagliflozin-treated participants 
with established cardiovascular disease had slower decline in kidney function, and a reduced risk of a 
composite outcome comprising end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or doubling in creatinine, although 
these outcomes were not adjudicated in that trial. The CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment 
Study (CANVAS) Program recently reported that canagliflozin prevents major cardiovascular events, 
and the results of exploratory analyses on adjudicated renal outcomes demonstrated a reduced risk of 
adverse kidney outcomes, based on a composite endpoint of sustained 40% reduction in eGFR, ESKD 
or renal death. The effects of canagliflozin on a comprehensive range of kidney outcomes are 
therefore of interest in better defining the effects of canagliflozin and SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney 
function in diabetes. 
Added value of this study 
This pre-specified exploratory analysis of the CANVAS Program showed that canagliflozin reduced 
the risk of sustained major kidney outcomes (doubling of creatinine, ESKD or renal death) in 
participants with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk (with and without established 
cardiovascular disease). It also found that kidney function declined progressively in placebo-treated 
participants, but was stabilised in participants treated with canagliflozin, and that albumin loss in the 
urine was reduced. The results were consistent across subgroups of participants, and renal adverse 
event rates were not increased. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
These data show clear evidence of substantial kidney protection in participants with type 2 diabetes at 
high cardiovascular risk treated with canagliflozin. These results, while consistent with those reported 
for empagliflozin, provide additional support for the growing evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors such as 
canagliflozin can play an important role slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, given 
  
 
renal outcomes were both confirmed and adjudicated in this trial. Further studies are required to 
assess whether canagliflozin can delay time to kidney failure in patients with established kidney 
disease. 
 
  
 
ABSTRACT  
Background 
In the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, canagliflozin reduced 
the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and suggested a renal benefit in patients with type 2 
diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events compared to placebo. The results of a pre-specified 
exploratory analysis of canagliflozin’s long-term effects on a comprehensive range of sustained and 
adjudicated renal outcomes are reported.  
Methods 
 
The CANVAS Program consists of two double-blind, randomised trials assessing canagliflozin 
compared to placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Pre-specified 
outcomes reported here include the composite of sustained, adjudicated doubling in serum creatinine, 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), or renal death, as well as individual components of this outcome, 
annual eGFR loss, and changes in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR). 
Findings 
A total of 10 142 participants (baseline mean eGFR 76·5 mL/min/1·73 m2, median UACR 12·3 mg/g, 
80% receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade) were randomised. The composite of sustained 
doubled creatinine, ESKD, or renal death occurred less frequently in the canagliflozin group 
compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0·53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·33–0·84), with consistent 
findings in pre-specified patient subgroups. Annual eGFR decline was slower (slope difference 
1·2 mL/min/1·73 m2/year, 95% CI 1·0–1·4) and mean UACR was 18% lower (95% CI 16%–20%) in 
participants treated with canagliflozin compared to placebo. Rates of renal adverse events were 
comparable in both groups. 
Interpretation 
In a pre-specified exploratory analysis, canagliflozin was associated with a reduced risk of sustained 
loss of kidney function, attenuated eGFR decline, and lower albuminuria supporting a possible 
renoprotective effect in people with diabetes.

INTRODUCTION 
Type 2 diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure in many countries1 and the number of 
people receiving renal replacement therapy for kidney failure globally is projected to increase from 
2·6 million in 2010 to >5 million people in 2030.2 Control of risk factors, including glucose,3-5 blood 
pressure (BP),6-8 and albuminuria,9 is the focus of attempts to protect kidney function, alongside renin-
angiotensin system (RAS) blockade.10,11 Residual risk nonetheless remains high, and several novel 
interventions targeting kidney disease have recently proved unsuccessful.12-15 
 
Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower glucose, BP, and body weight in people 
with type 2 diabetes, and also alter intrarenal haemodynamics in hyperfiltering individuals with type 1 
diabetes,16 although effects on glycaemia and body weight are attenuated in people with reduced 
kidney function.17 The CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program 
consists of two parallel trials (CANVAS and CANVAS-R [renal]).18 The CANVAS Program 
demonstrated cardiovascular safety, and reported 14% lower rates of cardiovascular events among 
canagliflozin- compared to placebo-treated participants.18 In pre-specified, exploratory analyses 
outside the formal hypothesis testing sequence (Figure S1), canagliflozin was also associated with a 
27% reduction in the likelihood of progression of albuminuria and a 70% higher likelihood of 
regression of albuminuria. In addition, there were 40% lower rates of a composite renal outcome 
comprised of sustained and adjudicated 40% reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR), ESKD or renal death.18 Exploratory analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study have 
recently reported that the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin also has potential benefits on renal 
outcomes, although these were not adjudicated in that trial.19 
 
Collectively, these data suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors might have renoprotective efficacy, but 
regulatory decisions and guidelines have previously required benefits to be demonstrated for ‘harder’ 
endpoints based on doubling in creatinine, with central adjudication. While a sustained doubling of 
serum creatinine is undoubtedly an important endpoint, given that it reflects a loss of 57% of kidney 
function (eGFR), the rate of kidney function decline in conditions like type 2 diabetes is often 
  
 
moderate. Clinical trials therefore require very long follow-up duration and/or extremely large 
numbers of participants to accumulate an adequate number of events in broad populations of 
participants, which can impact feasibility and has therefore generated an increasing interest in using 
lesser changes in eGFR as an alternative outcome.  
 
In order to address this challenge, a workshop convened by the US National Kidney Foundation and 
the US Food and Drug Administration in collaboration with academic researchers proposed that a 
sustained 40% reduction in eGFR could be a reasonable replacement for doubling of serum creatinine, 
but trials using this outcome have not yet led to treatment indications by regulatory authorities. As 
such, there is great interest in the magnitude and consistency of effects of canagliflozin on a range of 
renal outcomes from the CANVAS Program,  
 
We report here analyses assessing the effects of canagliflozin on a comprehensive range of pre-
specified, adjudicated, exploratory renal outcomes across the CANVAS Program.20 
 
METHODS 
Study design and participants 
The CANVAS Program integrates two directly comparable randomised, placebo-controlled trials, 
CANVAS and CANVAS-R (Renal), that have been described in detail previously,20-22 with primary 
safety and efficacy results reported.18 In brief, the CANVAS trial was designed to meet the US Food 
and Drug Administration guidance for registration of new glucose lowering agents,23 as part of a 
meta-analysis of all studies that led to the registration of this agent. In consultation with regulatory 
agencies, a second comparable trial (CANVAS-R) was initiated post-approval in order to allow the 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) for 
cardiovascular events to be less than 1·3 in an integrated analysis of CANVAS/CANVAS-R. As part 
of the design of this trial, plans were made for renal-specific analyses to be undertaken across the 
CANVAS Program. The details of the cardiovascular and renal analysis plans were finalised prior to 
data lock and have been published.20-22 
  
 
The main entry criteria for the trials were identical.18,21,22 People with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c 
7·0% and 10·5% (≥53 and ≤91 mmol/mol) who were aged ≥30 years and had a history of 
symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, or who were aged ≥50 years and had ≥2 pre-specified 
cardiovascular risk factors,21,22 which could include elevated urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 
(UACR), were eligible to participate. Individuals with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1·73 m2 were excluded, 
but there were no other kidney-related eligibility criteria. 
 
Randomisation and masking 
Participants entered a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period designed to ensure potential 
participants were able to comply with study procedures and to identify immediate non-compliers. 
Central randomisation was performed using an interactive web response system, based on a computer-
generated randomisation schedule prepared by the study sponsor using randomly permuted blocks.  
 
Participants in CANVAS were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to once-daily canagliflozin 300 mg, 
canagliflozin 100 mg, or matching placebo. Participants in CANVAS-R were randomly assigned (1:1) 
to once-daily canagliflozin or matching placebo at an initial dose of 100 mg daily with optional up-
titration to 300 mg or matching placebo initiating at week 13. Participants and all study staff were 
blinded to treatment allocations until study completion. Investigators and sites were encouraged to use 
local best-practice guidelines for other glycaemic management and background therapies, including 
RAS blockade. 
 
Procedures 
Post-randomisation, face-to-face follow-up was scheduled for 3 times in the first year and at 6-month 
intervals thereafter, with alternating telephone follow-up between face-to-face assessments. UACR 
was measured every 26 weeks in CANVAS-R, and at week 12 and then annually in CANVAS. Serum 
creatinine measurement with estimation of GFR was undertaken in a central laboratory using the Jaffe 
method with rate blanking,24 and was performed at least 3 times in the first year after randomisation, 
and then every 26 weeks. Off-treatment serum creatinine measurements approximately 30 days after 
  
 
cessation of randomised treatment were collected in participants enrolled in CANVAS-R. Adverse 
events (AEs), including information about kidney outcomes (eg, need for renal replacement therapy), 
were assessed at every visit. Individuals who prematurely discontinued study treatment were 
encouraged to continue scheduled follow-up wherever possible. 
 
Outcomes 
A number of composite kidney outcomes were pre-specified, the components of which were 
adjudicated by a blinded renal Endpoint Adjudication Committee (Supplementary Appendix). These 
included the composite of sustained doubling of serum creatinine (sent for adjudication if sustained 
for two consecutive measures ≥30 days apart, or occurring on the last available measurement), end-
stage kidney disease (ESKD; defined as the composite of maintenance dialysis sustained for at least 
30 days, renal transplantation, or a sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1·73 m2) and renal death (defined as 
participant death with a proximate renal cause). As doubling of serum creatinine is a relatively late 
end-point reflecting a 57% reduction in eGFR, and lower thresholds of eGFR decline have been 
proposed as being clinically important and potentially acceptable endpoints from a regulatory 
perspective,25-27 additional pre-specified outcomes included the composite of sustained 40% reduction 
in eGFR, ESKD, or renal death, as well as the composite of each of these outcomes combined with 
either cardiovascular death or new-onset macroalbuminuria. For each composite, time to the first 
event was counted, with any subsequent events disregarded. Each of the components of the composite 
outcomes are also separately reported, and the outcomes are defined in detail in the Supplementary 
Appendix.  
 
Other pre-specified renal outcomes included albuminuria- and creatinine-based outcomes (eGFR 
slope, change in urinary albumin levels, new-onset micro- or macroalbuminuria analysed jointly and 
separately). GFR was estimated (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation,28 
based on centrally measured serum creatinine collected at routine study visits. Albuminuria was 
measured in first morning void urine specimens and calculated as the UACR. Changes in albuminuria 
with canagliflozin were calculated as the ratio of the geometric mean of post-randomisation UACR 
  
 
measures compared with placebo. New-onset albuminuria was defined as the development of micro- 
or macroalbuminuria in participants with baseline normoalbuminuria. Normoalbuminuria was defined 
as UACR <30 mg/g. New-onset microalbuminuria was defined as the development of a UACR ≥30 
mg/g to ≤300 mg/g in participants with baseline normoalbuminuria, and where the UACR increased 
by ≥30% from baseline. New-onset macroalbuminuria was defined as the development of a UACR 
>300 mg/g in participants with baseline normo- or microalbuminuria, and where the UACR increased 
by ≥30% from baseline. 
 
Renal-related serious AEs were captured throughout both trials, and all AEs (regardless of 
seriousness) were also collected in CANVAS until early 2014. Kidney-related safety outcomes 
included any (serious and non-serious) renal-related AEs (collected from CANVAS until January 
2014) or serious AEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation (collected throughout both trials), 
including acute kidney injury (AKI), and were evaluated based on incidence of preferred term, using a 
standard narrow Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query. Hyperkalaemia was 
evaluated using the MedDRA preferred terms hyperkalaemia and increased blood potassium. 
 
Statistical analysis 
For categorical outcomes, HRs and 95% CIs were estimated by the principle of intention-to-treat 
using Cox regression models, with stratification by trial and adjustment for baseline albuminuria level 
or eGFR as appropriate. Subgroup analyses were undertaken for pre-defined patient categories. As the 
primary aim of the CANVAS Program was to demonstrate cardiovascular safety and efficacy, the pre-
specified renal outcomes assessed here were either outside the formal analysis sequence, or were not 
reached in the testing hierarchy, thus nominal effect estimates are provided.18 Unless otherwise 
specified, efficacy analyses are reported for the full integrated dataset that includes all randomised 
participants in the CANVAS Program (the CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials), and for both 
canagliflozin doses combined compared to placebo.  
 
  
 
The average rate of change in eGFR over time and the differences between treatment arms were 
assessed via a piecewise linear mixed effect model in two time periods: baseline to week 13, week 13 
to last available measure during the trial period, using an intention-to-treat approach. The model 
included fixed effect terms for treatment and study, with linear covariates of time and time-by-
treatment interaction. The intercept and time were included as random effects to allow variation 
between patients. A similar model was used to assess effects using an on-treatment approach, which 
included data up to two days after the discontinuation of study medication. The 30 days post-
discontinuation of randomised therapy measure of creatinine in the CANVAS-R trial was used to 
assess changes in eGFR independent of the acute and reversible haemodynamic effects of 
canagliflozin.  
 
A linear mixed effects model was fit to the logarithm of UACR and included treatment, logarithm of 
baseline UACR value, visit, study, treatment-by-visit interaction, and logarithm of baseline UACR 
value by visit interaction as fixed effects. The percentage of treatment difference relative to placebo 
was calculated by taking the antilogarithm of the estimated coefficient for the treatment group and 
subtracting 1, and then multiplying by 100 to provide percentage differences between groups. 
Albuminuria levels below the limit of detection were assigned the values of the lower detectable limit, 
with sensitivity analyses undertaken by excluding these values. 
 
To evaluate the impact of changes in HbA1c on renal efficacy of canagliflozin relative to placebo, a 
two-stage modeling approach was applied.29 In the first stage, the longitudinal data of effect on 
HbA1c before development of a renal outcome were fit with a linear mixed model including 
treatment, study, baseline value of HbA1c, and the continuous covariates of time and time by 
treatment interaction. Intercept and time were included as random effects. The fit trajectory function 
of the endpoint was then included in the separate Cox models of renal composite endpoints as a time-
varying covariate. The mixed effect model of UACR was also adjusted for the fit values of change in 
HbA1c from stage one modeling to understand the benefit of canagliflozin beyond glycemic control.  
 
  
 
An on-treatment analysis for safety outcomes (i.e. patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug up to 
30 days after study drug discontinuation) was done, as an on-treatment analysis was likely to be a 
more conservative approach than an intention-to-treat analysis in this context. Some serious AEs 
(cancer, fracture, amputation and diabetic ketoacidosis) were collected and included in analyses 
regardless of timing in order to capture any longer-term effects of canagliflozin. 
 
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9·2. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
identifiers NCT01032629 and NCT01989754. 
 
Role of the funding source  
The trials were sponsored by Janssen and conducted as a collaboration between Janssen, an academic 
Steering Committee, and an Academic Research Organization, George Clinical. The sponsor was 
involved in the study design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data, and the writing of the 
report. Analyses were undertaken independently by the Sponsor, and independently replicated and 
results confirmed by a statistician at George Clinical. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. 
The manuscript was drafted by the first author with all authors participating in subsequent revisions. 
The authors had full access to the data, made final decisions about content and submission for 
publication, and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the analyses. The corresponding author 
had full access to all of the data and the final responsibility to submit for publication. The trials were 
approved by the ethics committees at each site and all participants provided written informed consent. 
 
RESULTS 
The CANVAS Program screened 15 494 people (December 2009-March 2011 for CANVAS and 
January 2014-May 2015 for CANVAS-R20-22), among whom 10 142 participants were randomised 
across 2 trials: CANVAS (4330 participants) and CANVAS-R (5812 participants; Figure S2). 
Reasons for screen failures are shown in Figure S2, and included 64 people who did not comply with 
the placebo during the run-in phase. Mean follow-up was 188 weeks (296 weeks in CANVAS and 
108 weeks in CANVAS-R). At baseline, median UACR was 12·3 mg/g; microalbuminuria was 
  
 
present in 22·6% of participants and macroalbuminuria was present in 7·6% of participants. Baseline 
mean eGFR was 76·5 mL/min/1·73 m2; 24·4% of participants had an eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1·73 m2; 
55·5% between 60 and <90 mL/min/1·73 m2; and 19·8% between 30 and <60 mL/min/1·73 m2, 
including 5·2% with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1·73 m2.  
 
Baseline characteristics were well balanced across randomised groups (Table 1), including when 
categorised by baseline eGFR. Baseline characteristics by study have been reported previously18 and 
renal characteristics by study are summarised in Table S1. Compared to participants with normal 
kidney function, those with reduced kidney function were, on average, older, more likely to be 
female, have a longer diabetes duration, have established microvascular or macrovascular disease, and 
be treated with insulin and cardiovascular protective therapies.  
 
At baseline, 80·2% and 79·8% of participants in the canagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, 
were receiving RAS blockade, with an additional 4·0% and 3·9% of participants, respectively, having 
this therapy added to their treatment regimen during follow-up. 
 
Effects on major kidney outcomes 
The composite outcome of sustained doubling in serum creatinine, ESKD, or renal death occurred less 
frequently with canagliflozin compared to placebo (1·5 vs 2·8/1000 patient-years; HR 0·53, 95% CI 
0·33–0·84; Figures 1A and 2).  
 
Lower rates were also observed in canagliflozin-treated participants when either new-onset 
macroalbuminuria (HR 0·58, 95% CI 0·50–0·67) or cardiovascular death (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·68–
0·97) was added to this composite outcome (Figure 2). For each of these outcomes, substituting the 
sustained doubling of creatinine with sustained 40% reduction in eGFR resulted in more events and 
greater precision with similar point estimates of effect (Figure 2).  
 
  
 
Few individuals experienced sustained ESKD or renal death during the trials, given that participants 
were generally at low renal risk overall, and event rates were not clearly different between 
canagliflozin and placebo (0·4 vs 0·8/1000 patient-years, HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·23–1·32; Figure 2).  
 
Effects on composites containing either sustained doubling of serum creatinine or 40% reductions in 
eGFR were comparably lower among canagliflozin-treated participants across subgroups for both 
outcomes (Figure 3). These effects were also similar after adjustment for changes in HbA1c (Table 
S2). Analyses by dose from the CANVAS trial alone suggest that the 100 mg and 300 mg doses had 
similar effects on these outcomes (Table S3). 
 
Effects on estimated glomerular filtration  
Overall change in eGFR 
Mean eGFR over time is shown in Figure 1B. From baseline to the final available measurements for 
each participant, the mean change in eGFR in placebo-treated participants from baseline to the last 
available eGFR was –3·9 ± 0·2 mL/min/1·73 m2, compared to −1·8 ± 0·2 mL/min/1·73 m2 in 
canagliflozin-treated participants (mean difference 2·0 mL/min/1·73 m2, 95% CI 1·5–2·6). Among 
participants who completed study treatment and were re-evaluated approximately 30 days after 
treatment discontinuation (per the CANVAS-R protocol), mean change in eGFR from baseline to the 
last available measurements during the off-treatment period was 2·6 mL/min/1·73 m2 higher (95% CI 
1·8–3·4, Figure 1C) in the canagliflozin-compared to placebo-treated participants. 
 
Effects on eGFR slope 
The differences in eGFR slopes between treatment groups varied throughout follow-up due in part to 
an acute haemodynamic change on eGFR upon initiation of treatment (Figure 1B). From baseline to 
week 13, the placebo-treated group had an adjusted mean ± standard error GFR acute decrease of –0·7 
± 0·2 mL/min/1·73 m2, whereas canagliflozin-treated participants had a decrease of –3·1 ± 0·1 
mL/min/1·73 m2 (difference between canagliflozin and placebo of –2·4 ± 0·2 mL/min/1·73 m2; 95% 
CI –2·8 to –2·0 mL/min/1·73 m2). From week 13 to last available measurements during the trial 
  
 
(median of 20·9 months overall, 67·5 months for CANVAS and 16·7 months for CANVAS-R), 
participants randomised to placebo had a mean annual long-term decline of –0·9 ± 0·1 mL/min/1·73 
m2/year whereas those randomised to canagliflozin experienced a stabilisation of kidney function, 
with a mean annual long-term increase of 0·3 ± 0·1 mL/min/1·73 m2/year (difference 1·2 ± 0·1 
mL/min/1·73 m2/year, 95% CI 1·0–1·4 mL/min/1·73 m2/year), using intention-to-treat based 
analyses. Similar results were observed using on-treatment measurements (–0·8 ± 0·1 mL/min/1·73 
m2/year with placebo versus 0·3 ± 0·1 mL/min/1·73 m2/year with canagliflozin (difference 1·1 ± 0.1 
mL/min/1·73 m2/year; 95% CI 0·9–1·3 mL/min/1·73 m2/year). Results were also similar in 
participants with baseline eGFR above and below 60 mL/min/1·73 m2 (Table S4), and those who 
were and were not treated with RAS blockade at baseline (Table S5). The treatment effects of 
canagliflozin on the rate of eGFR decline after 13 weeks were greatest in participants with baseline 
macroalbuminuria (3·0 mL/min/1·73 m2/year, 95% CI 2·0–4·0) compared to those with 
microalbuminuria (1·0 mL/min/1·73 m2/year, 95% CI 0·6–1·4) or normoalbuminuria (1·1 
mL/min/1·73 m2/year, 95% CI 0·9–1·2; Table S6). Effects were also comparable across CANVAS 
and CANVAS-R (Table S7). 
 
Effects on albuminuria 
Overall, patients treated with canagliflozin had an 18% lower level of albuminuria during follow-up 
(95% CI 16%–20%, Figure 4A). The difference in albuminuria compared to placebo was 9% (95% CI 
7%–12%), 34% (95% CI 29%–38%) and 36% (95% CI 28%–43%) in patients with normo-, micro-, 
and macroalbuminuria at baseline, respectively (Figure 4B–4D), although average albuminuria levels 
increased over time in both groups. Albuminuria reductions remained significant after adjustment for 
HbA1c changes over time (14% lower [95% CI 12%–16%]; Table S8).  
 
Among participants with normoalbuminuria at baseline, new-onset albuminuria (micro- or macro-) 
occurred less frequently in participants randomised to canagliflozin compared to placebo (100·4 vs 
130·8/1000 patient-years, HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·73–0·88). Lower rates of new-onset microalbuminuria 
were observed among participants with normoalbuminuria at baseline randomised to canagliflozin 
  
 
(96·7 vs 127·3/1000 patient-years; HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·73–0·87, Figure 4E); rates of new-onset 
macroalbuminuria among participants with normo- or microalbuminuria at baseline were also lower 
(15·1 vs 27·6/1000 patient-years; HR 0·58, 95% CI 0·50–0·68; Figure 4F) among the canagliflozin 
group compared to placebo.  
 
Safety outcomes 
The total number of renal-related serious AEs was not different with canagliflozin versus placebo (2·5 
vs 3·3/1000 patient-years; HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·49–1·19). Rates of serious AEs due to AKI (1·6 vs 
2·5/1000 patient-years; HR 0·66, 95% CI 0·39–1·11) or hyperkalaemia (0·4 vs 0·6/1000 patient-
years; HR 0·75, 95% CI 0·27–2·11) were also not different (Figure S3). Rates of all serious and non-
serious renal AEs (collected in CANVAS participants prior to January 2014) were also not different 
with canagliflozin versus placebo (20·3 vs 17·8/1000 patient-years; HR 1·16, 95% CI 0·86–1·56). In 
the CANVAS trial, no differences were found for either AKI (3·0 vs 4·2/1000 patient-years; HR 0·72, 
95% CI 0·38–1·39) or hyperkalaemia (7·0 vs 4·5/1000 patient-years; HR 1·60, 95% CI 0·92–2·81). 
The increased risk of amputation was consistent in people with baseline eGFR levels above and below 
60 mL/min/1.73m2 (HR 1·91 [95% CI 1·29–2·83] vs 2·17 [95 % CI 1·14–4·10], respectively), as was 
the risk of fracture (HR 1·29 [95% CI 1·04–1·61] vs 1·18 [95% CI 0·80–1·73], respectively). 
 
DISCUSSION 
The CANVAS Program demonstrated that patients at high cardiovascular risk with mostly well 
preserved kidney function had improvements in a range of renal function parameters when treated 
with canagliflozin. Along with lower levels of albuminuria and a reduced likelihood of developing 
micro- or macroalbuminuria, canagliflozin-treated participants also experienced a stabilisation in 
kidney function measured by change in eGFR over time and by slope of eGFR decline, which 
translated into fewer participants experiencing a sustained reduction in kidney function.  
 
These analyses show consistent results on a broad range of renal outcomes, including those used by 
regulators, guidelines, and clinicians to define renoprotection, and therefore provide strong support for 
  
 
the hypothesis that canagliflozin has clinically relevant renal benefits for patients. The breadth and 
consistency of these findings add substantially to the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn 
from the limited renal outcome data provided in the original CANVAS Program report.18 The 
robustness of these exploratory renal protection findings is further supported by the magnitude of the 
differences between canagliflozin and placebo arms, and the consistency of the protection across 
multiple different pre-specified, sustained, and adjudicated renal endpoints. In the recently reported 
renal data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial,19 similar benefits of empagliflozin on GFR slope 
and composite renal outcomes including doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, and renal death were 
reported, further strengthening the likelihood that SGLT2 inhibitors have important benefits for the 
kidney. While kidney outcomes were not confirmed or adjudicated during the EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME trial,30 subsequent analyses have shown similar results based upon retrospectively 
confirmed events.31 On this background, the clear effects on pre-specified, prospectively confirmed, 
and adjudicated endpoints in the CANVAS Program greatly increase the likelihood that SGLT2 
inhibition will have a future role in kidney protection amongst patients with type 2 diabetes.  
 
Several mechanisms may contribute to renoprotection with SGLT2 inhibitors. Improved glycaemic 
control was found to reduce the risk of ESKD in the ADVANCE trial,5,32 though this has not been a 
consistent finding.4 Head-to-head studies against sulphonylureas have also shown stabilisation of 
eGFR in participants treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, whereas it declined progressively in those 
randomised to sulphonylureas.33 Furthermore, the renal benefits were similar after adjustment for 
effects on HbA1c, making it very unlikely that the renal effects are glucose dependent. BP lowering 
may also be an important contributor but the renal effects of intensive BP control have also been 
somewhat inconsistent.8,34 The acute effects on eGFR suggest that intraglomerular pressure is reduced 
by SGLT2 inhibitors, which may be due to inhibition of tubuloglomerular feedback and afferent 
arteriolar vasoconstriction.16 This mechanism is complementary to that of RAS blockade, and its role 
is supported by short-term data in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with empagliflozin 
demonstrating attenuated renal hyperfiltration by affecting tubuloglomerular feedback. Although 
untested in patients with type 2 diabetes, a similar mechanism is expected.16 Finally, recent studies of 
  
 
other classes of glucose-lowering agents have either shown no consistent effect on kidney outcomes 
(dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors),35,36 or have shown benefits for albuminuria based 
outcomes and eGFR slope, but not for ESKD or doubling of serum creatinine (liraglutide, a glucagon-
like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonist).37 Overall, the available data suggest that the large apparent 
benefits for the kidney are likely to be predominantly due to the specific renal effects of SGLT2 
inhibitors, and can be achieved on top of RAS blockade. 
 
The CANVAS Program renal analyses benefit from the large size, long duration, strong design, 
rigorous conduct and the pre-specification, confirmation, and adjudication of renal outcomes. Patients 
were well managed according to contemporary guidelines, although glycaemic control did not achieve 
guideline targets on average, highlighting the need for better glucose-lowering therapies. The major 
limitation of this and prior reports is the paucity of the clinically important kidney outcomes of ESKD 
and renal death (21 events in total) or doubling of serum creatinine (60 events), due in large part to the 
recruitment of participants with high cardiovascular risk but overall with mostly normal kidney 
function and therefore relatively low renal risk. Future research aiming to better define people at high 
risk of rapid loss of kidney function should be a priority. Regulatory agencies have routinely and 
reasonably prioritised ESKD and renal death over albuminuria- or creatinine-based outcomes, and it is 
unlikely that the exploratory analyses from the CANVAS Program or the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trial will lead to the granting of a treatment indication for the prevention of kidney disease on the label 
of SGLT2 inhibitors. The ongoing Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established 
Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE, NCT02065791) trial will define whether the 
albuminuria- and creatinine-based effects observed with canagliflozin translate into clinically 
important renal benefits in individuals with type 2 diabetes. To the best of our knowledge, 
CREDENCE will be the first dedicated renal outcome trial using an SGLT2 inhibitor, and will 
provide more data about effects in people with established kidney disease, including those with 
reduced kidney function, since most participants have eGFR <60 mL/min/1·73 m2 and all have 
macroalbuminuria despite maximally tolerated RAS blockade. Further trials with dapagliflozin38 and 
empagliflozin39 will also look at renal effects in both diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney 
  
 
disease. Further analyses assessing delay in onset time of albuminuria progression are planned, but 
have not yet been conducted. While pre-specified, the renal outcomes reported for the CANVAS 
Program are outside the formal hypothesis testing sequence and thus exploratory18 and the large 
number of analyses and relatively few outcomes increases the risk of false positive findings, though 
the broad concordance of the data and consistency with other SGLT2 inhibitor trials strengthens the 
conclusion of renoprotection in people with diabetes. 
 
Conclusions 
Canagliflozin reduced the risk of sustained decline in kidney function, lowered albuminuria excretion, 
and attenuated eGFR decline. These results suggest canagliflozin may have an important role in 
reducing the burden of kidney disease in people with diabetes.

CI, confidence interval; dSCr, doubling serum creatinine; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease; CV, cardiovascular; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.  
For each composite and individual outcome, time to the first event of that type was counted, and any subsequent events are disregarded. 40% reduction in eGFR and 
doubling of creatinine were required to be sustained, defined as being present on at least 2 consecutive measurements more than 30 days apart. ESKD defined as the 
composite of maintenance dialysis sustained for at least 30 days, renal transplantation or a sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1·73 m2, and adjudicated by an expert 
committee. Renal death defined as death where the proximate cause was renal as defined by the endpoint adjudication committee. There were only 3 renal deaths, all 
in the placebo group.

CANVAS Program renal outcome criteria 
 
A. Renal endpoints 
The renal endpoints of interest are: 
 
Progression of albuminuria; 
 
Regression of albuminuria; 
 
Renal composites: 
 
40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), renal death, or requirement for renal 
replacement therapy; 
 
Doubling of serum creatinine, renal death, or requirement for renal replacement therapy 
 
Albuminuria  
Urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is used to assess albuminuria. Subjects will be classified as having 
normoalbuminuria (ACR <30 mg/g), microalbuminuria (ACR ≥30 mg/g and ≤300 mg/g), or 
macroalbuminuria (ACR >300 mg/g). 
 
Albuminuria progression is the development of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in a subject 
with baseline normoalbuminuria or the development of macroalbuminuria in a subject with baseline 
microalbuminuria, accompanied by an ACR value increase of greater than or equal to 30% from 
baseline. 
 
Albuminuria regression is the development of normoalbuminuria in a subject with baseline 
microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria or the development of microalbuminuria in a subject with 
baseline macroalbuminuria, accompanied by a decrease in the urinary ACR value of greater than or 
equal to 30% from baseline. 
 
The onset of events of albuminuria progression/regression is based on the ACR measurements 
quantified by a central laboratory. The date of the progression/regression event will be defined as the 
visit date of the first urine sample for the potential progression/regression findings. Events based on 
ACR measurements were not adjudicated. 
 
Renal Composites 
The components of the renal composite endpoints, such as requirement for renal replacement therapy, 
40% reduction in eGFR, and doubling of serum creatinine, identified by the investigators or the 
sponsor for meeting the criteria pre-specified in the charter will be sent to the independent Endpoint 
Adjudication Committee (EAC). 
 
Requirement for Renal Replacement Therapy 
In the absence of universally accepted guidelines that define the onset of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the 
following definitions have been developed to identify and adjudicate ESKD events.  
1. Diagnosis  
Worsening uremia in patients progressing from chronic kidney disease to ESKD causes characteristic 
symptoms that require renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation. The 
requirement of ongoing renal replacement therapy establishes the diagnosis of ESKD. In some cases, 
the diagnosis can be made in the absence of renal replacement therapy when certain criteria are 
fulfilled.  
 
Kidney transplantation  
Definitive renal replacement therapy prescribed when uremic symptoms have already occurred, 
or are anticipated to occur, due to the progression of irreversible chronic kidney disease. Death 
during the transplant surgery will be considered kidney transplantation.  
 
Chronic dialysis  
ESKD will be diagnosed if dialysis is performed for 30 days or more and is not subsequently 
known to recover. Indications for dialysis are indicated in section 2 below.  
 
Dialysis not administered  
In cases where dialysis is not available or not administered due to futility or subject refusal, the 
diagnosis of ESKD will require sustained eGFR of <15 mL/min/1·73 m2 (by CKD-EPI formula 
and confirmed by repeat central laboratory measure).  
 
2. Onset of ESKD  
The mode of onset of ESKD will be adjudicated into the following categories:  
  
 
 
Chronic progression  
 
Acute deterioration, diagnosed when the decline in kidney function is sudden and acute kidney 
injury is superimposed on chronic kidney disease resulting in renal replacement therapy.  
 
3. Confirmation of ESKD  
 
If the patient recovers renal function, (defined as patient taken off dialysis because the physician 
evaluates that patient has enough renal function to live independently) the diagnosis of ESKD will 
be rescinded.  
 
If the patient is known to have received dialysis for >30 days but <90 days, and not known to 
recover, ESKD will be confirmed. The reason for the unavailability of information beyond 30 days 
should be clearly documented by the investigator.  
 
If dialysis was initiated, but not continued for 30 days due to death, futility of therapy, or 
transplantation, the patient will be considered to have reached ESKD. In this situation, the reason for 
discontinuation of dialysis should be clearly documented by the investigator.  
 
 
If dialysis is known to have been continued for <30 days and there is no further information 
available about the event, the adjudicators will use their discretion in considering the event as an 
endpoint.  
 
4. Date of ESKD  
 
If an event is adjudicated as ESKD due to kidney transplantation, the date of the transplantation 
will be the date of the event if transplantation was the first form of renal replacement therapy 
given.  
 
If an event is adjudicated as ESKD due to initiation of dialysis, the date when dialysis was 
initiated will be the date of the event.  
 
In cases where dialysis is not available or not administered due to futility or subject refusal, the 
date of ESKD will be when eGFR falls below 15 mL/min/1·73 m2, as determined by central or 
local laboratory measurements.  
Information around presence or absence of symptoms of uremia will also be collected, if available, for 
subjects meeting the ESKD endpoint; however this will not affect the final adjudication decision which 
will be based on the primary definition of ESKD as described in sections 1–4 above.  
 
Symptomatic uremia  
Symptomatic uremia is diagnosed in the presence of the uremic syndrome, which is a constellation of 
signs and symptom involving several different systems, including:  
o 
General: Pruritus, dry skin, fatigue, anhedonia  
o 
Metabolic: Deterioration in nutritional status, recent significant weight loss, electrolyte or 
acid base disturbances (severe hyperkalemia or severe acidosis);  
o 
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting  
o 
Neurological: Neuropathy, encephalopathy, psychiatric disturbances, seizures;  
o 
Volume overload, including difficult-to-control or accelerated hypertension;  
o 
Bleeding diathesis not attributable to other causes;  
o 
Pleuritis or pericarditis of uremic origin or other;  
o 
Severe hyperparathyroidism.  
 
Advanced asymptomatic uremia  
The initiation of dialysis is generally performed when eGFR declines to <15 mL/min/1·73 m2 on a 
subjective basis in anticipation of development of uremic symptoms. If no symptoms are documented 
for initiation of dialysis, asymptomatic uremia will be diagnosed. In the minority of patients who 
exhibit no symptoms even at very low eGFR values (such as <8 mL/min/1·73 m2), but for whom renal 
replacement therapy is initiated in the view of benefits of therapy, the diagnosis will be of advanced 
asymptomatic uremia.  
 
  
 
Doubling of Serum Creatinine and 40% Reduction in eGFR  
Doubling of serum creatinine will be defined as a greater than or equal to 2-times increase in serum 
creatinine from the baseline assessment that persists for 30 days or more and is not thought to be due to 
reversible cause.  
The baseline serum creatinine will be used to compare subsequent values and determine if doubling of 
serum creatinine has occurred.  
A 40% reduction in eGFR will be defined as a greater than or equal to 40% reduction in eGFR from the 
baseline assessment that persists for 30 days or more and is not thought to be due to reversible cause  
 
The baseline eGFR will be used to compare subsequent values and determine if 40% reduction in 
eGFR has occurred.  
 
Both central serum creatinine and eGFR values and local lab values, if available, may be used to 
calculate the increase in serum creatinine or change in eGFR.  
 
Cases in which there is a single observation or there are not 2 consecutive observations of doubling 
of serum creatinine or 40% reduction in eGFR will not be submitted to the Renal EAC for 
adjudication.  
 
However, cases in which there is a single observation of doubling of serum creatinine or 40% 
reduction in eGFR at the last measurement during the studies will be submitted to the Renal EAC 
for adjudication.  
 
If a confirmatory central lab value cannot be collected due to death or dialyses and there is no 
evidence of acute kidney injury, the event will be adjudicated positively.  
 
It is assumed that as a matter of good general clinical practice, the investigator will make reasonable 
attempts to exclude reversible causes of elevation of serum creatinine such as volume depletion or 
nephrotoxic medication. The event will be adjudicated positively once the initial doubling of serum 
creatinine via local or central laboratory results has been confirmed at 30 days or more, and if the 
process is determined to be irreversible. The date of the event will be the date on which the creatinine 
first doubled. 
 
B. Safety 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) at the time of database lock. 
 
CANVAS-R was started after the approval of canagliflozin. Since the safety profile of canagliflozin had 
been well established in the Phase 3 program, the AE collection in CANVAS-R was streamlined to 
include: 
 
Serious AEs; 
 
AEs that resulted in study drug discontinuation;  
 
All AEs (serious and nonserious) for selected AEs of interest. 
 
After the approval of protocol amendment INT-6 (January 2014), the AE data collection in CANVAS 
was also streamlined in the same fashion as CANVAS-R.

For each composite and individual outcome, time to the first event of that type was counted, and any subsequent events are disregarded. 40% reduction in eGFR and doubling of 
creatinine were required to be sustained, defined as being present on at least 2 consecutive measurements more than 30 days apart. ESKD defined as the composite of maintenance 
dialysis, renal transplantation or a sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, and adjudicated by an expert committee. Renal death defined as death where the proximate cause was renal 
as defined by the endpoint adjudication committee. There were only 3 renal deaths, all in the placebo group.  
*Excludes data from CANVAS-R. 
†Annualised incidence rates are reported through 7-Jan-2014 since after this time, only serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation were collected in

*One patient was randomised at 2 different sites and therefore the second randomised ID was excluded from the 
ITT analysis set. 
†Percentages calculated based on the ITT analysis set. 
‡A patient is considered as having completed the study, regardless of whether the patient is on or off study drug, 
if the patient is followed until a time point between the notification of the trial end date (November 1, 2016) and 
the trial end date (February 23, 2017), or until the time of death for those who died prior to the trial end date.

*For these adverse events, the annualised incidence rate are reported based on the CANVAS study alone through 7-Jan-2014 since after this time, only serious adverse events 
or adverse events leading to discontinuation were collected. In the CANVAS-R study, only serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation were collected 
for these events. Due to the differences in collection methodology, an integrated analysis of these adverse events is not possible.
