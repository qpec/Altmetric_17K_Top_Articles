Context: Epidemiological evidence on maternal and paternal heritability of the wide normal vari-
ation within pubertal timing is sparse.
Objective: We aimed to estimate the impact of parental pubertal timing on the onset of puberty
in boys and girls.
Design: Annual pubertal examinations of healthy children in a longitudinal cohort study. Infor-
mation on parental timing of puberty (earlier, comparable to, or later compared to peers) and
menarche age was retrieved from questionnaires.
Participants: A total of 672 girls and 846 boys.
Main Outcome Measures: Age at onset of pubic hair (PH2�), breasts (B2�), and menarche in girls;
and PH2�, genital stage (G2�), and testis �3 mL with orchidometer (Tvol3�) in boys.
Results: In boys, pubertal onset was significantly associated with pubertal timing of both parents.
PH2� and Tvol3� were earlier: �11.8 months (95% confidence interval, �16.8, �6.8)/�8.9 (�12.8,
�4.9), and �9.5 (�13.9, �5.1)/�7.1 (�10.4, �3.7) if the father/mother, respectively, had early
pubertal development compared to late. In girls, menarche was significantly associated with both
parents’ pubertal timing: �10.5 months (�15.9, �5.1)/�10.1 (�14.3, �6.0) if father/mother had
early pubertal development compared to late. For the onset of PH2� and B2� in girls, estimates
were�7.0months(�12.6,�1.4)and�4.1(�10.6,�2.4)/�6.7(�11.0,�2.5),and�6.7(�11.0,�2.0)
for fathers/mothers, respectively. Maternal age of menarche was significantly associated with the
onset of all pubertal milestones except PH2� in girls.
Conclusions: Maternal as well as paternal pubertal timing was a strong determinant of age at
pubertal onset in both girls and boys. Age at breast and pubic hair development in girls, which has
declined most during recent years, seemed to be least dependent on heritability. (J Clin Endocrinol
Metab 101: 2667–2674, 2016)
A
large and widely unexplained variation exists within
normal pubertal maturation. Early pubertal onset is
related to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, breast cancer,
and all-cause mortality (1, 2). Given the recent trend of
earlier pubertal maturation, especially in girls, the interest
in factors determining pubertal timing is increasing. Tim-
ing of puberty is multifactorial. Intrauterine and early in-
fant growth (3–5) as well as environmental compounds
(6–8) may be important factors, and genetics undoubt-
edly plays a major role. According to twin studies, heri-

 tability is accountable for 57–61% of the variation in age
at menarche (9, 10) and for 91% of the variation in the
onset of pubertal growth spurt (11). These high heritabil-
ity estimates from twin studies are, however, somewhat in
contrast to the still limited knowledge of specific regula-
tors of pubertal onset from genetic studies. Genes that
affect pubertal timing, eg, MKRN3 (12), KISS1, and
KISS1R (13), have been identified, but mutations in these
are generally rare. Large genome-wide association studies
have drawn attention to single nucleotide polymorphisms
affecting pubertal timing. Recently, specific single nucle-
otide polymorphisms in FSHR and FSHB were found to be
strongly associated with pubertal onset (14). But although
more than 100 loci have been identified for age at men-
arche, together these explain only around 3% of the trait
variance (15).
A number of studies have shown significant correla-
tions between the age at menarche of mothers and the age
at menarche of daughters (16). However, the evidence
from epidemiological studies is more sparse concerning
earlier pubertal milestones such as age at thelarche (breast
development), pubarche (pubic hair development), and
gonadarche (genital stage �2 or testis size above 3 mL in
boys), which are the “gold standard” when clinically eval-
uating the onset of puberty. The role of paternal heritage
is poorly described, except in the clinical conditions of
delayed or precocious puberty (17, 18).
Specific knowledge on the heritability is important not
only in the clinical setting, but also for researchers when
studying environmental factors that may affect pubertal
timing. We therefore asked parents of children, who par-
ticipated in a large prospective birth cohort, to complete a
questionnaire about their own pubertal development be-
fore the first clinical examination of their children.
We hypothesized that both paternal and maternal pu-
bertal timing was strongly associated with the onset of all
secondary sex characteristics in both boys and girls.
Subjects and Methods
In a large prospective mother-child cohort conducted in Copen-
hagen, Denmark, mothers were recruited between 1997 and
2003 in early pregnancy from three university hospitals. Only
Caucasian mothers of Danish origin were included in the cohort.
The cohort has previously been described in detail (19).
Between 2006 and 2013, 672 girls and 846 boys attended one
to five annual clinical examinations (n � 4128; age range, 4.5–
15.1 years). Pubertal stages in girls were evaluated as B1–B5 and
PH1–PH5 by inspection according to Tanner (20) as well as
palpation of breasts, thus avoiding misclassification of fat tissue
as breast development. The onset of puberty was defined as � B2
(B2�/thelarche) and � PH2 (PH2�/pubarche) (21, 22). The
girls were asked if they had experienced their first menstrual
bleeding since the last examination (and when possible the spe-
cific month). In boys, testicular volume was measured by
Prader’s orchidometer (palpation). Pubertal stages in boys were
evaluated by inspection as G1–G5 and PH1–PH5 (23). The onset
of puberty in boys was defined as testicular volume �3 mL
(Tvol3�/gonadarche), � G2 (G2�/gonadarche) and/or � PH2
(PH2�/pubarche) (24, 25). If testicular volumes of the two testes
were not equal, the larger testis measurement was used. Like-
wise, if a girl had larger breast stage on one side, the larger stage
was used. The physicians in the study participated in repetitive
workshops to ensure and maintain standardization.
In questionnaires, which were sent to the family 2 weeks be-
fore the examination, mothers and (biological) fathers were
asked: “Was your own pubertal timing early, average, or late
compared to your peers?” Mothers were also asked about their
age at menarche.
The study was conducted according to the Helsinki II Dec-
laration and approved by the local ethics committee (KF 01-030/
97/ KF 01276357/H-1-2009-074) and the Danish Data Protec-
tion Agency (1997-1200-074/2005-41-5545/2010-41-4757).
The parents and children gave their written informed consent
before examination.
Statistics
We estimated the mean age of onset of puberty and the impact
of parental puberty timing by probit analyses using Proc Lifereg
(SAS Institute). This allowed taking into account the left, right,
and interval-censoring present in the data. In all children, the
longitudinal course of pubertal development was evaluated. For
most children, we had an age at which they did not have the
pubertal marker of interest and a following age at which they did
(interval-censored observation). Some of the children had the
pubertal marker of interest already at the first examination. The
attainment of this marker was therefore known to occur before
the age at first examination (left censored observation). Other
children did not attain the marker of interest at any of the ex-
aminations (observation right censored at last examination). If a
precise age of menarche could be obtained, this age was used as
noncensored data. The probit analysis allowed estimating the
mean as well as the variance of the pubertal age of onset distri-
bution. The latter was used to estimate how much of the varia-
tion in the pubertal onset distribution could be explained by
parental pubertal timing. The percentages of the variance of on-
set of pubertal milestones that were explained by parental timing
were calculated as 1� (variance for model including information
on parents/variance for model without information on parents).
Progression time from the onset of B2 to menarche was esti-
mated using the lowest possible interval and highest possible
interval for censoring.
If transient pubertal maturation was observed (eg, breast de-
velopment appearing at one examination but not at the next), we
excluded this observation in the models, hence using age at the
previous examination and age when consistent pubertal onset
was observed (B2�, n � 33; Tvol3�, n � 1; PH2�, n � 8; G2�,
n � 52).
The impact of parents’ pubertal timing (categorical variable:
being earlier or average vs later than their peers) and of maternal
menarche (as a continuous variable, in years) was estimated by
including these as covariates (one at the time) in the probit anal-
yses. Estimates are given in months with 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs). Analyses were also adjusted for the pubertal timing of

Possible interactions between maternal and paternal pubertal
timing were tested, including a product term in the models.
The distribution (cross-tabulation) of mothers’ and fathers’
pubertal timing was examined with �2 test.
Results
Mean age at Tvol3�, G2�, and PH2� for boys and at
B2�, PH2�, and menarche in girls is shown in Table 1.
Mean age of menarche in girls was significantly earlier
comparedtomeanageofmaternalmenarche(12.99years,
SD: 1.16; vs 13.17 years, SD: 1.32; P � .001). Mean ages
of pubertal milestones (B2�, PH2�, Tvol3�, age of men-
arche) were not significantly different in children with pa-
rental information (n � 1081) vs those without (n � 435;
28.7%) (data not shown).
The distribution of parents’ pubertal timing as early,
average, and late is shown in Supplemental Table 1. The
combination of parental pubertal timing was not ran-
domly distributed because children with late maturing
fathers more often also had a late maturing mother (�2,
P � .01).
Early (compared to late) pubertal timing in fathers was
significantly associated with earlier onset of all pubertal
milestones in their sons (Table 2), with the largest esti-
mates for PH2�. Boys with early maturing fathers had
pubarche earlier (�11.8 months; 95% CI, �16.8, �6.8)
than boys with late maturing fathers and compared to
boys with average maturing fathers (�5.4 months; 95%
CI, �9.4, �1.3). All associations were also significant for
boys with average maturing vs late maturing fathers, but
regarding G2� and Tvol3�, not for boys with early com-
pared to average maturing fathers. In girls, having an early
maturing father (compared to late) was associated with
significantly earlier age at menarche (�10.5 months; 95%
CI, �15.9, �5.1) and earlier age at pubarche (�7.0
months; 95% CI, �12.6, �1.4). In contrast, the associa-
tion to age at breast development in girls was not signif-
icant for early maturing fathers, but we found a significant
difference for average vs late maturing fathers. Girls with
early maturing fathers did not mature significantly earlier
than average maturing fathers (Table 3). The significant
associations remained so after adjusting for maternal pu-
bertal timing (data not shown).
Early and average maternal pubertal timing (compared
to late) was significantly associated with earlier onset of all
pubertal milestones in both the sons (Table 2) and the
daughters (Table 3), with estimated effects of having an
early maturing mother compared to having a late matur-
ing mother ranging from �10.1 months, (95% CI, �14.3,
�6.0) for menarche in girls to �6.5 months (95% CI,
�10.7, �2.4) for G2� in boys. Children with early ma-
turing mothers did not differ from those with average ma-
turing mothers in age at pubertal onset except for men-
arche in girls. Adjusting for fathers’ pubertal timing did
not essentially change estimates (data not shown).
Maternal age of menarche was associated with all
pubertal milestones of both boys and girls, except girls’
development of pubic hair (Tables 2 and 3). The largest
effect estimate was for the association with their daugh-
ter’s age of menarche: 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.1, 5.6) per
year (Table 3).
Parental pubertal timing explained 7.8, 9.3, and 6.0%
of the variance in Tvol3�, PH2�, and G2� in boys (ma-
ternal and paternal timing both in the model) and 3.3, 5.9,
and 14.5% for B2�, PH2�, and menarche in girls, re-
spectively (for PH2�, maternal and paternal timing was
included in the model; for menarche and B2�, paternal
timing and maternal menarche was included in the model
because maternal menarche in these models explained
more variance than maternal timing).
Mean ages of pubertal milestones in subgroups, with
combinationsofmothers’andfathers’pubertaltiming(eg,
children with an early father and an early mother), are
shown for boys in Figure 1, A—C, and for girls in Figure
2, A–C. Significant interactions between the parents’ pu-
bertal timing were found for PH2� in boys (P � .01) and
for menarche in girls (P � .005), because for these mile-
stones, if just one of the parents had matured early, the
child would also mature significantly earlier (regardless
of the other parent’s pubertal timing) (Figures 1C and
2C).
Discussion
Overall, we found that both the paternal and maternal
history of pubertal timing affect the timing of pubertal

 onset in the sons and daughters. This suggests a significant
degree of heritability of the normal variation of pubertal
onset, which appears not to be sex-specific. There were
subtle differences in the effect of parental timing on indi-
vidual secondary sex characteristics. In girls, age of men-
arche appeared to be more strongly correlated to parental
pubertal timing than breast and pubic hair development.
Although we cannot exclude that these differences are
caused by inherent inaccuracies in determining the onset
of these early markers of puberty in girls, our findings
indicatethatnongeneticfactors,ie,environmentalfactors,
influence thelarche and pubarche more than age of men-
arche in girls. Paternal pubertal timing was significantly
associated with the onset of pubic hair and age at men-
arche, but not consistently with breast development in
girls. Maternal timing of puberty was associated with all
milestones in both boys and girls. When combining ma-
ternal and paternal history of pubertal timing, an appar-

Data are expressed as estimate in months (95% CI). Example: boys with early maturing fathers develop pubic hair 11.8 months earlier than if their
fathers were late maturing and 5.4 months earlier than if fathers were average maturing. Boys with late maturing fathers develop pubic hair 6.4
months later than if their father were average maturing. An increase in mothers’ menarche age (by 1 year) was associated with 2.2 months later
pubic hair development in sons.

Parental Pubertal Timing and Age at Pubertal Onset

 ently additive effect could be seen for all pubertal mile-
stonesinboys,butonlyformenarcheingirls.Lookinginto
interactions, however, we found that for pubic hair de-
velopment in boys and for menarche in girls, just having
one early maturing parent had significant impact, regard-
less of the other parent’s pubertal timing.
In accordance with other studies (16), we found that
maternal age at menarche predicted age at menarche in
their daughters. Additionally, maternal age at menarche
was related to the onset of breast development in girls as
well as to pubic hair development and gonadarche in boys.
More often than expected due to chance, late maturing
fathers matched with late maturing mothers. This possible
example of assortative mating was adjusted for in our
models (adjusting for the other parent by having both in
the model), but it did not substantially change the results.
Delayed puberty is more frequent in boys than in girls
and is often associated with a history of late pubertal de-
velopment of their fathers (17). However, we did not find
a father-to-son/mother-to-daughter (sex-specific) effect of
parental pubertal timing. Pubertal timing of both parents
had effects on pubertal onset of both boys and girls. These

 findings are in line with a large Finnish study of di- and
monozygotic twin boys and girls concluding that a large
part of the variance in pubertal maturation was explained
by genetics and that the genetic effect was not sex depen-
dent (26). Furthermore, recent large genomic analyses
found that both recalled age at voice break in boys (27)
and Tanner stages in boys and girls (28) shared some ge-
netic etiology with timing of menarche in girls. Also in line
with our findings, studies of children with precocious
puberty as well as children with constitutional delay of
growth found evidence of paternal as well as maternal
heritage (17, 29). In addition, our study confirms results
from the ALSPAC study in which maternal menarche be-
fore 12 years of age was associated with earlier self-re-
ported attainment of B2�, PH2�, and menarche in girls
(30). However, this study did not report the association
between maternal menarche age and onset of pubertal
milestones in the boys (31).
The association between maternal age of menarche and
onset of pubic hair in girls was nonsignificant. A possible
interpretation of this may be that the female gonadarche
(thelarche) pathway and adrenarche (pubarche) pathway
differs regarding both physiological and genetic regula-
tion. This is in accordance with a study of genetic corre-
lations evaluating 184 pairs of mono- and dizygotic twin
girls. The authors concluded that although gonadarche
(breast development and menarche) and adrenarche were
to a significant extent heritable and showed high genetic
correlations, they were also differently affected by envi-
ronmental factors and should be regarded as different
manifestations and not a unitary physiological factor (32).
We had information from more mothers than fathers,
and this could have affected the likelihood of finding sig-
nificant results. However, the fathers’ information was
highly associated to age at menarche and onset of pubic
hair in girls as well as pubic hair and gonadarche in boys.
To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological
study to investigate the impact of paternal pubertal mat-
uration on the normal variation in pubertal onset in a
father’s offspring. A reason for this gap of evidence could
be that it is often more reliable to ask the mothers. It is
easier to recall menarche than any other pubertal sign, and
most fathers will not be able to recall when their testes
started growing. The question of being early, average, or
late compared to peers is usually also simple to answer by
memory or looking at school pictures. Approximately half
of the mothers in our study categorized themselves as hav-
inghadaveragepubertaltimingcomparedtotwo-thirdsof
the fathers. This suggests a sex-specific bias, with fathers
tending to choose average timing more often, or it reflects
the lack of an obvious male milestone like menarche. Be-
cause associations of both parents are consistently strong
with almost all pubertal milestones in children, we do not
believe that this potential recall bias compromises our
findings (or that the question we asked the parents was too
simple). Furthermore, both age of menarche and timing of
maturation (early, average, or late in relationship to peers)
haveearlierprovedtobewellrememberedbywomen(33).
The parents answered the questionnaires before the clin-
ical examinations of their children, and hence their an-
swers were not likely biased by the results of these. Mean
age of pubertal onset was not significantly different in the
children with or without data on parental puberty, which
indicates that the missing data did not cause systematic
bias either.
Some children experienced transient pubertal develop-
ment (eg, B2, G2, or Tvol3�), which was not observed at
the subsequent examination. We cannot rule out that
some of these cases were due to interobserver variation,
although this was not pronounced in our study (34). It is,
however, more likely that these inconsistencies reflect true
variations in androgen and estrogen levels that cause in-
termittent pubertal signs because this is a well-known
physiological phenomenon experienced in clinical set-
tings, although only described in a few studies (30, 35, 36).
Mean ages of pubertal onset in this cohort were similar
to those from contemporary studies and significantly ear-
lier than from the study performed in 1991–1993 in the
same geographic area (37–39), with the exception of mean
age of PH2� in boys that seems unchanged. Our findings
confirm the suggested trend toward earlier pubertal onset,
especially in girls. Girls in our study also had earlier mean
age of menarche than their mothers. This is in line with the
hypothesis that the observed trend toward earlier pubertal
maturation is not caused by genetics, but is caused most
probably by other (environmental) factors (38).
Interestingly, the associations between parental pu-
berty and breast development in girls were generally
weaker than associations with menarche and with puber-
tal milestones in boys. In line with this, a Dutch twin study
foundthatgeneticinfluenceonpubertalmarkersandFSH,
LH, T, and estradiol levels at 9 and 12 years was higher for
boys than for girls. Heritability had an impact on all hor-
mones except estradiol levels at 9 years in girls, which
common environmental factors conversely seemed to in-
fluence (40). Although genome-wide association studies
have found overlaps between loci associated with men-
arche and pubertal Tanner stages in both boys and girls
(28), these findings could reflect that impact of environ-
ment and heritability varies between boys and girls as well
as for early and late pubertal markers. Environmental fac-
tors such as body composition changes and chemical ex-
posure may play a larger role for an early marker as breast
development than for menarche. In line with this hypoth-

 esis, the decline of age at breast development was more
pronounced than that of age at menarche. Similarly, in
boys in whom effect estimates and variance explained by
inheritance in general were larger than in girls, the age of
pubertal onset has not changed as much over time as it has
for breast development in girls.
Conclusions
Both paternal and maternal timing of puberty had a
strong influence on the timing of pubertal onset in chil-
dren, and this was not sex-specific. Mean ages of pubertal
onset support earlier findings of a secular trend toward
earlier pubertal maturation. This was most pronounced
for breast development in girls, for which hereditability
appears to have less impact than for menarche. This sug-
