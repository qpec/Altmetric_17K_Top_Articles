Abstract During sleep, the thalamus generates a characteristic pattern of transient, 11-15 Hz
sleep spindle oscillations, which synchronize the cortex through large-scale thalamocortical loops.
Spindles have been increasingly demonstrated to be critical for sleep-dependent consolidation of
memory, but the specific neural mechanism for this process remains unclear. We show here that
cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing
neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale
networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over
hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns
through hundreds of reverberations. These results provide a novel mechanistic account for how
global sleep oscillations and synaptic plasticity could strengthen networks distributed across the
cortex to store coherent and integrated memories.

Introduction
Memories are stored in distributed networks across the cortex. In the two-stage model of memory
consolidation (McClelland et al., 1995; Rasch and Born, 2007), memories are integrated in the hip-
pocampus and then linked in the neocortex for long-term storage, where information represented in
visual, auditory, somatosensory, or cognitive regions must be bound into a coherent whole
(Wheeler et al., 2000; Horner et al., 2015). It is well established that sleep oscillations actively con-
tribute to this process: during stage 2 sleep spindles, the thalamus generates a rhythmic activity pat-
tern that becomes widespread through large-scale thalamocortical loops (Contreras et al., 1996),
and

(Gais
et
al.,
2002;
Mednick et al., 2013). Long-range connections in cortex result primarily from excitatory pyramidal
cells (Sholl, 1956; Schu
¨z et al., 2002), but precisely how sleep oscillations aid strengthening of these
excitatory connections between distributed cortical networks through spike-time dependent plastic-
ity (STDP) remains unclear, particularly in the presence of long axonal conduction delays
(Lubenov and Siapas, 2008). Here, we identify a global activity pattern repeatedly observed during
sleep spindle oscillations in human neocortex that could serve this role.
We study intracranial electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings of five clinical patients in stage 2
sleep and apply recently developed computational methods (Muller et al., 2014) to classify

 spatiotemporal dynamics at the level of individual oscillation cycles. ECoG arrays were implanted in
subjects undergoing evaluation for resective surgery of epileptogenic cortex (Figure 1A, left). Over
several days of recording, these subjects exhibit long periods without major epileptic events. During
that time, subjects express a relatively normal sleep architecture, with well-defined sleep oscillations.
Stage 2 sleep epochs were then manually identified by an expert rater, and sleep spindles recorded
on the ECoG were isolated using automated techniques (Hagler et al., 2016). These spindles
appeared physiologically normal and well-isolated from background noise (Figure 1A, right and Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1). Our algorithmic approach classifies spatiotemporal patterns as
expanding waves, defined as a significant linear increase in phase offset with distance from a point
source (Figure 1—figure supplement 2; see Materials and methods – Spatiotemporal dynamics), or
rotating waves, defined as a significant increase in phase offset with rotation about a wave center
(Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In 41,860 spindle oscillation cycles tested across subjects, a large
proportion (50.8%) was classified as rotating waves, along with a smaller subset (15.6%) as expand-
ing. After inspecting these results, we observed further that the rotating waves exhibited a clear bias
towards travel in the temporal ! parietal ! frontal (TPF) direction (69.5%, p<10�10, one-tail bino-
mial test against equal occurrence, 14,796 TPF cycles, 21,272 total; for each individual subject
p<10�3, see Figure 1—source data 1 for individual wave totals) (Figure 1B and Video 1). Propaga-
tion speed distributions peaked between 2–5 m/s (Figure 1C), varying within a narrow range from
the 20th to the 80th percentiles (3–9 m/s for the full distribution; 4–10, 3–8, 3–10, 2–3, and 4–13 m/s
for individual subjects, respectively), within the range of conduction speeds for the short
(Girard et al., 2001) and long (Schu
¨z et al., 2002; Swadlow and Waxman, 2012) white matter asso-
ciation fibers. Further, this rotating TPF organization occurred consistently across subjects and
implantation hemispheres (Figure 1D; see also Figure 1—figure supplements 5–7).
Spike-time dependent plasticity is a well-studied mechanism for regulating synaptic strengths
that depends on the relative timing of presynaptic inputs and postsynaptic spikes (Markram et al.,
1997; Bi and Poo, 1998), but for establishing large-scale neural assemblies during sleep oscillations
through synaptic plasticity, axonal conduction delays pose a specific problem (Lubenov and Siapas,
2008). For example, cortical white matter association fibers have conduction delays up to 50
eLife digest When you wake up in the morning after a good night’s sleep you feel refreshed.
You can also think more clearly because your memory has been re-organized, a process called
memory consolidation. The problem that the brain has to solve during sleep is how to integrate
memories of experiences that happened during the day with old memories, without losing the older
memories.
Scientists know that waves of electrical activity, referred to as spindles, help to consolidate and
integrate memories during sleep. Spindles are active in the cerebral cortex, the part of your brain
used for thinking, in the time between dream sleep and deep sleep. Yet it is not known exactly how
these bursting patterns of electrical activity help to strengthen memories.
Now, Muller et al. explored how the spindles could strengthen and connect parts of memories
stored in distant parts of the brain. First, a computer algorithm analyzed electrical recordings of
brain activity taken while five patients with epilepsy slept. The patients were being monitored to
help with their seizures, and the recordings showed that spindles do not occur at the same time
throughout the cortex as previously thought. Instead, the spindle is a wave that begins in portion of
the cortex near the ear, spirals through the cortex toward the top of back of the head and then on
to the forehead area before circling back.
These repeated circular waves of electrical activity strengthen connections between brain cells in
distant parts of the brain. For example, these waves may help strengthen connections between the
cells of the cortex that separately store memories of the sound, sight and feel of an event during the
day, whether that’s being bitten by a dog or talking with a friend. Next, Muller et al. plan to develop
computer models of the spindles and verify whether their models make accurate predictions by
studying spindles in sleeping mice and rats.

caused by spikes traveling along pyramidal axons
to distant regions in the cortex would align with
the local burst of population activity (Figure 2B,

aptic strengthening to occur.
Next, we wanted to understand whether these
population activity patterns repeat with the tem-

to

a

similarity
index
(see
Materials and methods), in order to detect similar spatiotemporal patterns across oscillation cycles
(Video 2). By calculating this metric over all cycle
pairs in different wave classes (all cycles, expand-
ing, rotational), we can directly compare the tem-
poral precision mediated by each type. The
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of similar-
ity indices among identified rotational waves is
highly shifted to the right (Figure 3A, black) com-
pared to the CDF for all cycles (5 subjects, 42/54
sleep epochs, 77.8% significant, one-tailed two-
sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a ¼ 0:01, Bon-
ferroni correction), indicating higher intra-class
similarity between these cycles than for other
wave types. Note that this is not simply a conse-
quence of the rotational phase pattern itself, as
expanding waves emanating from a consistent
point source could certainly exhibit higher intra-
class similarity than rotational waves with a vary-
ing center. Further, the median similarity index
consistently increases in individual subjects when

 indicates the observed rotating waves strongly modulate temporal precision in repeated patterns of
population activity. To be specific, by utilizing the average temporal frequency for these spindle
oscillations (13.5 Hz), we can estimate that in two cycles whose similarity index falls into the highest
bin in Figure 3C (0.9–1.0), 50% of electrodes will experience an alignment of the spatiotemporal
activity pattern within a 5 millisecond temporal window. Recent experiments have shown a tight
temporal link between field potentials and synaptic currents (both EPSPs and IPSPs; Haider et al.,
2016). By detecting these precisely recurring activity patterns in ECoG recordings, we can infer that
distributed networks composed of local excitatory and inhibitory groups, whose firing is modulated
by thalamocortical fibers during the sleep spindle, are repeatedly activated with a millisecond accu-
racy that is well within the temporal precision required for STDP.
If this millisecond precision in fact mediates formation and maintenance of corticocortical assem-
blies, we would then expect spiking associated with these synaptic currents to drive increased rever-
beration throughout the night, as excitatory connections between local groups of pyramidal cells
and interneurons are strengthened and in turn promote more replay of the expressed activity pat-
tern. High gamma-band power (HGP, 80–120 Hz), a reliable electrophysiological correlate of spiking

power shift’ described in Manning et al., 2009), consistently increases around spindles (Figure 4A).
Further, HGP is modulated by spindle phase (Figure 4B), increasing towards the surface-positive
(depth-negative) peak, consistent with previous animal (Peyrache et al., 2011) and human
(Andrillon et al., 2011) recordings. Finally, by studying repeats of rotating waves over 2.5 hr of con-
tinuous sleep recording in Subject 1, we observe a preliminary indication of increased reverberation
consistent with strengthening of distributed excitatory networks: similarity in the next identified
rotating wave is highly predictive of the number of strong reverberations throughout the night (black

 dots, Figure 4C). Randomizing the relationship between the next rotating wave and the rest of the
sleep recording eliminates this effect (shuffling control, Figure 4C), and such increased reverberation
is not observed for expanding waves under similar conditions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Sim-
ilar observations are consistent across subjects (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These results sup-
port the hypothesis that precisely repeating rotating waves may enable strengthening of large-scale
corticocortical assemblies throughout the night.
Early animal sleep spindle studies, using up to 8 electrodes in a linear array (Andersen et al.,
1967; Kim et al., 1995; Contreras et al., 1996, 1997), in addition to preliminary EEG evidence in
the human (Achermann and Borbe
´ly, 1998), proposed that spindles involve global synchronization
of cortical circuits, raising the possibility that this sleep oscillation places neocortex into a specialized
state for consolidation of long-term memories. In recent years, several studies have reported a mix-
ture of ’local’ and ’global’ spindles using amplitude-duration thresholding approaches (Nir et al.,
2011; Andrillon et al., 2011). By carefully studying the phase information in the spindle frequency
band recorded on large-scale ECoG arrays, we have uncovered that a substantial number of spindle
oscillation cycles are organized into global, hemisphere-spanning patterns of rotating and expanding
waves (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). These patterns most likely represent the characteristic spa-
tiotemporal organization of the ’global’ spindles observed in Andrillon et al. (Andrillon et al., 2011)
(�40% involvement, cf. their Figure 5C), with more localized patterns left unclassified by our detec-
tion approach (Figure 1—figure supplements 9 and 12). These global patterns are likely estab-
lished through widespread thalamocortical loops, placing the cortex into a state of large-scale
coherence (Contreras et al., 1996), shaped into rotating and expanding waves through corticocorti-
cal white matter connections with axonal conduction speeds consistent with the observed propaga-
tion speeds (Figure 1C). Future computational modeling work will address in detail the role of
thalamocortical, corticocortical, and corticothalamic connections in generating the spatiotemporal
activity patterns reported here.
Spindles have recently been specifically and causally implicated in the sleep-dependent consoli-
dation of long-term memories (Mednick et al., 2013; Hennies et al., 2016). While some memories
integrate content from single sensory modalities, requiring consolidation in only single cortical
regions (such as motor cortex, Khazipov et al., 2004), many memories integrate multimodal sensory
and cognitive information (Gibson and Maunsell, 1997), and require ’global’ integration of distrib-
uted networks across the cortex. In this work, we have identified a novel mechanism by which this
process could occur: the stereotyped activity patterns reported here may enable STDP to establish
large-scale neuronal assemblies at scales where axonal conduction delays are long relative to the
oscillation cycle (Fries, 2005; Lubenov and Siapas, 2008), and repeat many times throughout sleep
with millisecond accuracy. While the schema illustrated in Figure 2 is a highly simplified view of the
microscale interactions between long-range excitatory projections and local networks during spindle
oscillations, computational and theoretical studies have previously obtained a detailed understand-
ing of STDP dynamics with neurons receiving sequenced (Rao and Sejnowski, 2001, 2003), bursting
(Song et al., 2000), and oscillating inputs (Muller et al., 2011; Luz and Shamir, 2016). This theoreti-
cal understanding of the interplay between STDP and population activity can allow in future work a
precise account of how microscale synaptic interactions are shaped by global oscillation patterns,
and how variability in these patterns (e.g. variation in wave speed, Figure 1C) will affect this mecha-
nism. Taken together, these results provide insight into how distributed information stored across
cortical regions may be bound into a coherent, integrated, but specific memory through spike-time
dependent synaptic plasticity.

Subjects
Patients with longstanding pharmacologically resistant complex seizures gave fully informed consent
according to NIH guidelines as monitored by the local Institutional Review Board (Massachusetts
General Hospital). Electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings during natural sleep were made over the
course of clinical monitoring for spontaneous seizures. Electrode placement was determined solely
by clinical criteria, with electrode grids usually spanning the Sylvian fissure and multiple lobes of the
cerebral cortex (frontal, parietal, and temporal). Patients were informed that participation in the

 research would not alter their clinical treatment in any way, and that they may withdraw their consent
at any time without jeopardizing clinical care.
Electrodes
ECoG contacts (Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corp., Racine, WI) were 3 mm platinum-iridium (90%
platinum) discs arranged in a two-dimensional grid (8 rows and 8 columns, Subjects 1, 3, and 4; 8
rows and 12 columns, Subject 2; 8 rows and 6 columns, Subject 5) implanted semi-chronically on the
pial surface in an effort to localize the seizure origin. Within the grid, electrodes were spaced 10 mm
apart. In some patients, linear ECoG arrays provided additional spatial coverage; application of our
multichannel detection approach, however, focused on the two-dimensional electrode grid. One
strip of electrodes positioned over the pial surface and facing the skull served as the reference dur-
ing the recordings; results were additionally verified using an average reference. Note that due to
reference artifacts, an average reference was employed for the recordings in Subject 4. We note as
well that the temporal extent of the waves, over tens of milliseconds, makes electrophysiological
artifacts such as volume conduction an unlikely explanation for the observations reported here.
Recordings were performed with clinical EEG monitoring equipment (XLTEK, Natus Medical Inc.,
Pleasanton, CA) and sampled at 500 or 512 Hz.
Electrode localization
Post-implantation electrode localization utilized coregistration of preoperative magnetic resonance
imaging
(MRI)
with
postoperative

(CT),
as
described
by
Dykstra
et al. (Dykstra et al., 2012). Cortical surfaces were computed with FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999;
Fischl et al., 1999). To account for the misalignment between the MRI and CT due to the craniot-
omy, the locations of the grid electrodes were projected onto the cortical surface (Dykstra et al.,
2012). Geodesic electrode distances, which take into account the folded geometry of the cortical
surface and were used in some calculations (e.g. estimation of spatial correlation values), were esti-
mated using a shortest paths approach on the cortical surface mesh.
Sleep spindle detection
During the monitoring period for spontaneous seizures, the subjects slept in the clinical environment
and expressed relatively normal sleep patterns. ECoG recordings that did not have a seizure in the
preceding or following 12 hr were scored visually by an expert rater following the standard sleep
stage classification (Silber et al., 2007). For each patient, we obtained from 15 to 101.5 min of
NREM stage 2 sleep, when the spindles are most prevalent. Individual sleep spindles were then
detected during stage 2 sleep using one of several complementary methods, either based on ampli-
tude-duration thresholding (Gais et al., 2002; Warby et al., 2014) or a similar wavelet-based
approach with additional verification steps (Hagler et al., 2016). The number of spindles detected
was in agreement with previous reports of spindle density (Gais et al., 2002; Warby et al., 2014).
The results were additionally verified using a novel approach quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of power in the bandpass (9–18 Hz, 8th-order Butterworth filter) versus the bandstop (1–
100 Hz bandpass, with 9–18 Hz bandstop) signal. In this approach, the SNR metric is calculated on
short (500 ms) sliding windows in each channel. When the SNR metric reaches 0 dB, the signal and
noise power are at parity, corresponding to a sharp, narrowband epoch in the recording. Picking a
constant SNR threshold (5 dB) corresponds roughly to the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) tech-
nique in radar. This approach yields a conservative but approximately amplitude-invariant method
for detecting arbitrary narrowband epochs in multichannel data.
Power spectral density analysis
Following spindle detection, we made a verification analysis by calculating the average power spec-
tral density (PSD) over isolated spindle epochs in each subject. Data were initially filtered to remove
line noise artifacts, and PSDs were then calculated in 1 s intervals during the spindle and matched
non-spindle epochs. PSDs for individual channel and spindle epochs were concatenated into a large
array and averaged in each case. A clear peak in the 11–15 Hz frequency band for the spindle
epochs can be seen, while no peak is observed in the matched non-spindle epochs (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 1A). Divisive normalization is calculated by dividing the power at each frequency in

 the spindle epochs by the power in the matched non-spindle epochs, and expressing the result in
dB (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, inset). If the divisive normalization over an epoch of stage 2
sleep reached 5 dB, then the spindles were taken to be well-isolated and possessing the spectral
characteristics necessary for an accurate phase representation, and were then included in further
analysis. Based on this calculation, 54 individual epochs of stage 2 sleep, varying from 30 s to 35 min
in duration, were selected in five clinical subjects.
Temporal filtering
Temporal filtering of stage 2 sleep recordings was carried out with an 8th-order digital Butterworth
bandpass filter (9–18 Hz), forward-reverse in time to prevent phase distortion (see MATLAB function
filtfilt). All results were checked with multiple cutoff frequencies to ensure against parametric
sensitivity.
Spatial correlation analysis
To assess spatial correlation during spindle oscillations as a function of distance in the cortex, we
adapted standard methods (Destexhe et al., 1999) with a Monte Carlo implementation more suited
for sampling correlations on two-dimensional electrode arrays. To calculate this metric, one elec-
trode is first selected at random, and a second is then selected from the set of electrodes within a
binned distance di from the first. The temporal correlation between these electrode pairs is then
computed in the bandpass timeseries between the start and end points of the spindle. This process
is repeated for a given number of iterations Nk at each distance bin di, and the average spatial corre-
lation is computed as the mean of the correlation values for the individual epochs (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1B, black). The spatial correlation values were computed for non-spindle epochs
matched to the temporal extent of the individual tested spindle epochs (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1B, red). The average spatial correlation values are elevated during spindle oscillations with
respect to the matched non-spindle periods of stage 2 sleep, indicating that a coherent, large-scale
increase

Spatiotemporal dynamics
To study spatiotemporal dynamics in these neural recordings, we adapted our previously introduced
method for detecting arbitrarily shaped traveling waves (Muller et al., 2014) to multisite ECoG
arrays (Figure 1—figure supplements 2 and 3). This approach allowed us to characterize and clas-
sify the spatiotemporal dynamics during thousands of episodes of spindling activity in many hours of
sleep recordings. The method proceeds in three steps: (1) analytic signal representation for charac-
terization of instantaneous signal characteristics at each electrode, (2) center localization at each
individual oscillation cycle, and (3) quantification of the spatiotemporal pattern in each oscillation
cycle as a function of distance from (or rotation about) the isolated center point. In the following, we
describe in detail the method for isolating expanding and rotating waves in multichannel data.
To estimate instantaneous signal characteristics, we employ the well-known analytic signal repre-
sentation. This approach entails transforming a real-valued timeseries into a complex phasor, whose
modulus (length) and argument (angle) in the complex plane represent the signal instantaneous
amplitude and phase, respectively. Specifically, if vx;y;t is a real-valued, narrowband timeseries at a
point ðx; yÞ; x 2 ½1; Nc�; y 2 ½1; Nr�, where Nc and Nr denote the number of rows and columns, and t 2
½1; Nt� is the sample number, then its analytic signal representation is
Vx;y;t ¼ vx;y;t þ i^
vx;y;t
(1)
where i is the complex unit and ^
f denotes the Hilbert transform of a signal f . The instantaneous
phase of vx;y;t is then the argument at each point in this complex sequence
fx;y;t ¼ ArgðVx;y;tÞ;
(2)
and instantaneous amplitude is the modulus. At several points in the analysis, results were confirmed
with an FIR implementation of the Hilbert transform, in addition to the standard FFT-based approach
(Marple, 1999). We evaluated phase values at a set of time points T ¼ ft1;t2;...;tKg in each spindle

 near the positive oscillation peaks. The phase fields were then smoothed using a robust approach
(Garcia, 2010) for center localization to reduce noise and interpolate values from missing electrodes;
note that the smoothed values were not used in the calculations for detecting expanding and rota-
tional wave patterns.
These phase values are then used to capture spatiotemporal dynamics in the multichannel data.
To isolate putative expanding or rotating wave centers in each oscillation cycle, we first assess the
spatial gradient of phase
~
gx;y;tj � �rfx;y;tj
(3)
with tj 2 T . For the spatial gradient, derivatives are taken across the two dimensions of space and
are approximated by the appropriate forward and centered finite differences. As in previous work,
phase derivatives were implemented as multiplications in the complex plane (Feldman, 2011;
Muller et al., 2014).
Detection of expanding waves
To detect expanding waves, we assess the divergence of the phase gradient field
dx;y;tj ¼ r �~
gx;y;tj ;
(4)
and define the putative wave source to be that point which satisfies the arg max over space in each
cycle
S � ðx;y;tjÞ ¼
x;y
arg maxdx;y;tj ;
(5)
where argmaxf ða;bÞ � fa;bj8p;q : f ðp;qÞ � f ða;bÞg. This step allows us to find the source for a possi-
ble expanding wave in each cycle (step 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 2), about which the phase
field is then evaluated to quantify the evidence for an expanding wave spatiotemporal organization
(step 3, Figure 1—figure supplement 2). For this next step, we calculate the circular-linear correla-
tion coefficient �f;d (Jammalakadaka and Sengupta, 2001; Berens, 2009) between signal phase f
and radial distance d from the source point in the original, unsmoothed phase field

where rcd represents the Pearson correlation between the cosine of the circular variable f and the
linear variable d, rsd between the sine of f and the variable d, and rcs between the cosine and sine of
f. This approach allows us to quantify the strength of the spatiotemporal pattern of activity on the
array in a single number, which is then compared to the value produced by repeating the calcula-
tions many times under random shuffling of the data (blue dotted line, Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 4A and Materials and methods – Shuffling Controls).
Detection of rotating waves
Analogous to the above case, we start by assessing the curl of the phase gradient field

and defining the putative center to be that point which satisfies the arg max over space

This center point then defines an anchor about which we can pass into a polar coordinate system,
describing the distance d and rotation angle � about that point (step 2, Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 3). With the putative rotation center isolated in each oscillation cycle, we then proceed to cal-
culate the circular-circular correlation coefficient �f;� between signal phase f and rotation angle

Similar to the previous case, this number �f;� quantifies the evidence for a rotational wave organi-
zation on the array, which is then compared to the value derived from a random-shuffling permuta-
tion test (red dotted line, Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and Materials and methods – Shuffling
Controls). For each case, additional control analyses with simulated rotating waves embedded in
noise were used to verify the robustness of our approach (Figure 1—figure supplement 11). Finally,
in the case that both expanding and rotational elements are detected, the pattern is classified as
rotational, because sub-patterns of rotational waves tend to be detected as expanding elements
(verified in Figure 1—figure supplement 5; see also Materials and methods – Average vector field
controls).
Shuffling controls
To quantify the level of spatiotemporal phase flow expected in the data by chance, we implemented
a shuffling procedure to establish a permutation-based threshold for both the expanding and rotat-
ing wave measures. To do this, we shuffled the phase values in each oscillation cycle randomly across
space a number of times (100 or 1000 times in initial tests, then reduced to 25 without changing
results), repeating each time the same calculation as for the un-shuffled data. The 99th percentile of
the resulting distribution then determines a threshold above which the value for the correlation met-
ric (either for expanding or rotational waves, considered separately) exceeds chance, with the spatial
autocorrelation erased.
A possible confound resulting from this shuffling procedure is that the data intrinsically possess
some spatial autocorrelation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), which is ignored by the so-con-
structed permutation test. To address this point in the context of rotational wave detection, we con-
ceived an additional permutation test control. In this second control, we considered the set of points
at a Chebyshev (i.e. King’s chessboard) distance di 2 ½1; dm� from the putative rotation center, where
dm indicates the maximum distance on the electrode array from that point. We then shuffled chan-
nels at distances di for all i, and repeated the calculation for the rotational wave detection. The
resulting permuted data have a spatial correlation function identical to that in the un-shuffled data,
but with the rotational structure fully destroyed. The 99th percentile cutoff determined from this sec-
ond control analysis fell within 0.01 of the originally estimated value (3% difference), validating the
original shuffling permutation test employed above.
Simulated data controls
Using simulated expanding waves of the form
f ðt;dÞ ¼ Aeið!t�kdÞ þ shðtÞ;
(11)
and simulated rotating waves
f ðt;�Þ ¼ Aeið!t�g�Þ þ shðtÞ;
(12)
where A is the oscillation amplitude, ! is the oscillation angular frequency, k is the wavenumber, g is
the polar wavenumber, and hðtÞ is a Gaussian white noise term, we verified the robustness of our
detection approach under noise of varying amplitudes. Note that d and � are defined with respect to
the wave center, left unspecified for simplicity. Oscillation amplitude was set to unity, without loss of
generality, and other oscillation parameters were matched to those observed during stage 2 sleep
spindles. Oscillation frequency ! was set to the average instantaneous frequency estimated from
702 spindles in Subject 1 (13.5 Hz), and wavenumbers were adjusted to approximate the wave-
lengths observed in the data. Varying systematically the level of added noise, we ran the algorithms

 for detecting expanding and rotating waves described above for 25 trials at each point and
recorded the algorithm’s detection performance in each case (mean � SEM, Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 11C). These results illustrate the approximate invariance of our computational approach to
random noise.
In another test, we systematically varied the position of the wave center on the simulated 64 elec-
trode array, for both expanding and rotational waves (Figure 1—figure supplement 11D). Parame-
ters were set as above, and simulations were again run over 25 trials at each point. This test probed
the sensitivity of the rotational detection approach to border effects, which is expected to be negli-
gible at the encountered noise levels in comparison to the thresholds established by the permuta-
tion controls (dotted lines, Figure 1—figure supplement 11D).
In a third test, we verified that the spatiotemporal patterns observed here are not due to varia-
tions in spindle frequency, which are known to occur along the rostro-caudal axis (Peter-
Derex et al., 2012). To do this, we re-ran our analysis on one stage 2 sleep session containing 179
spindles in Subject 1, generating surrogate data as follows. Each electrode evolved in time accord-
ing to its mean instantaneous frequency during the spindle, but with a randomized initial phase
angle. These surrogate data thus possessed the same frequency content on average as in the origi-
nal data, but with their spatial organization of phase removed. In this control, both rotating and
expanding wave patterns were highly decreased (3.5% and 0.8% of cycles, respectively, compared
to 64% and 14% in the original data).
Average vector field controls
The algorithmic classification of wave patterns in individual oscillation cycles involves several steps,
and we wanted to make an independent check to verify these results. To do this, we adopted a re-
centered averaging approach, shifting the vector field of propagation directions from the smoothed
phase fields at each oscillation cycle to the putative rotation center (red dots, Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 5), and taking the circular mean (Fisher, 1993; Berens, 2009) of propagation direction at
each point. Performing the calculation in this way prevents regions with noise or high phase gradient
magnitude from dominating the result. The obtained vector fields for rotational TPF (Figure 1—fig-
ure supplement 5A) and expanding (Figure 1—figure supplement 5B) waves illustrate the accuracy
of the algorithm and the general validity of our classification approach in separating waves into
expanding and rotational groups.
Phase map correlation analysis
To quantify the precision of repeated spatiotemporal patterns during across spindle oscillations over
several minutes of data, we calculated the circular-circular correlation between phase values in indi-
vidual oscillation cycles. For two phase maps ax;y and bx;y, the circular correlation is defined as
above (Fisher, 1993; Berens, 2009)

the upper triangle (Figure 3A). To construct the CDF in the permutation case (Figure 3A, purple

Ethics
Human subjects: Patients with longstanding pharmacologically resistant complex seizures gave fully
informed consent according to NIH guidelines as monitored by the local Institutional Review Board
(Massachusetts General Hospital). Electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings during natural sleep were
made over the course of clinical monitoring for spontaneous seizures. Electrode placement was
determined solely by clinical criteria, with electrode grids usually spanning the Sylvian fissure and
multiple lobes of the cerebral cortex (frontal, parietal, and temporal). Patients were informed that
participation in the research would not alter their clinical treatment in any way, and that they may
withdraw their consent at any time without jeopardizing clinical care (see Materials and Methods -
Subjects).
