Abstract: 
The broadband herbicide glyphosate (N‐[phosphonomethyl]‐glycine) and its main metabolite 
aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were analyzed by GC‐MS‐MS in 24 h‐urine samples cryo‐archived by 
the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB). Samples collected in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 
2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were chosen for this retrospective analysis. All urine samples had been 
provided by 20 to 29 years old individuals living in Greifswald, a city in north‐eastern Germany. Out of the 
399 analyzed urine samples, 127 (= 31.8 %) contained glyphosate concentrations at or above the limit of 
quantification (LOQ) of 0.1 µg/L. For AMPA this was the case for 160 (= 40.1 %) samples. The fraction of 
glyphosate levels at or above LOQ peaked in 2012 (57.5 %) and 2013 (56.4 %) after having discontinuously 
increased from 10.0 % in 2001. Quantification rates were lower again in 2014 and 2015 with 32.5 % and 
40.0 %, respectively. The overall trend for quantifiable AMPA levels was similar. Glyphosate and AMPA 
concentrations in urine were statistically significantly correlated (spearman rank correlations coefficient = 
0.506, p ≤ 0.001). Urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels tended to be higher in males. The possible 
reduction in exposure since 2013 indicated by ESB data may be due to changes in glyphosate application in 
agricultural practice. The ESB will continue monitoring internal exposures to glyphosate and AMPA for 
following up the time trend, elucidating inter‐individual differences, and contributing to the ongoing 
debate on the further regulation of glyphosate‐based pesticides

1 Introduction and background 
 
The broadband herbicide glyphosate (N‐[phosphonomethyl]‐glycine) was introduced in the 
1970s into agricultural practice and has nowadays become the worldwide most widely used 
active substance for weed control (Dill et al., 2010; Duke and Powles, 2008; Jaworski, 1972). 
Glyphosate’s main biodegradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) (Borggaard 
and Gimsing, 2008) is a known residue in crops and other plants treated with glyphosate and 
can be assumed to have a comparable toxicity profile (EFSA, 2015; FAO, 1998; UBA, 2015a, 
b; WHO, 2005). 
In Germany, the sales volume of glyphosate (active substance) for the domestic market were 
approx. 3,300 tons in 2000. After having increased to approx. 6,300 tons in 2007, and slightly 
more than 7,600 tons in 2008, volumes dropped to approx. 4,000 tons in 2009. From 2010 to 
2014 domestic sales fluctuated between 5,000 and 6,000 tons (German Parliament, 2015; 
Seng, 2016). Regarding the active substance with the highest domestic sales amount in 2014, 
glyphosate ranks second after the inert gas carbon dioxide in professional uses, while it 
ranks first in non‐professional uses (BVL, 2015). 
The German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) documents time trends of pollutant 
concentrations in humans and the environment. Starting in the late 1970s, human and 
environmental samples are cryo‐preserved for retrospective analyses of potentially harmful 
substances, since the 1980s according to a standardized protocol (Kolossa‐Gehring et al., 
2012; Schröter‐Kermani et al., 2016). 
As the health impact of the general population’s exposure to glyphosate and AMPA is 
currently controversially discussed (Cressey, 2015; EFSA, 2015; Guyton et al., 2015; Myers et 
al., 2016; Niemann et al., 2015), the German Environment Agency initiated a retrospective 
analysis of these compounds in ESB 24 h‐urine samples. This analysis was carried out in 
2015. 
The main goal of this study was to elucidate the internal exposure of the general German 
population to glyphosate and AMPA and its change over time. The analyzed ESB urine 
samples from year 2001 up to year 2015 were provided by young adults, who had not been 
specifically exposed to glyphosate, i. a., because of non‐existing occupational contact. 
  
Page 3 
In addition to the temporal trends in glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in 24 h‐urine 
samples, possible associations between substance concentrations and other parameters 
(e. g. sex, weight, and creatinine level) were investigated. In order to detect first indications 
of possible dietary effects on internal exposure of young adults to glyphosate and AMPA, 
samples of ESB participants who reported a vegetarian or vegan diet were exemplary 
analyzed for the years 2007 and 2015. Moreover, a second comparative sub‐population of 
participants at another ESB sampling location (city of Muenster) was included in the study. 
2 Methods 
2.1 Sampling and study group 
This retrospective monitoring study was based on 24 h‐urine specimen collected in the 
annual sampling of the German ESB. To reduce the risk of contamination, all containers 
needed for sampling and aliquoting were carefully cleaned before use according to standard 
operating procedures (Eckard et al., 2011; Lermen et al., 2015). All samples have been 
provided by young adults (predominantly students) aged 20 to 29 years. To follow the time 
trend of human exposure to glyphosate and AMPA, cryo‐preserved urine samples collected 
in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were analyzed. All urine 
samples were collected from individuals living in Greifswald, a city in north‐eastern 
Germany. Annual ESB sampling in Greifswald is regularly carried out in the period of March 
and April. 
From each of the ten study years, 24 h‐urine samples donated by 20 male and 20 female 
participants were randomly selected for analyses. The only inclusion criterion for this 
random main study sample was that no specifically restricted diet – mainly vegetarian or 
vegan – had been reported by the sample provider in the self‐administered ESB 
questionnaire. In 2001 the questionnaire item on dietary restrictions had not yet been 
implemented. Therefore, some samples from 2001 may have been provided by vegetarians 
or vegans. The fraction of vegetarian or vegan ESB participants, however, remained roughly 
between 2 and 14 % from 2002 to 2014 followed by fractions up to 18 % in 2015. Therefore, 
it can be assumed that, if any, only very few participants with restricted diets might have 
erroneously been included in the 2001 sample. One 2013 measurement had to be excluded 
from the main study sample, as the participant was later identified not to fulfill the inclusion 
criterion.  
  
Page 4 
Hence, the main sample of this study consisted of 399 participants living in the ESB sampling 
location Greifswald (Wiesmüller et al., 2007) with virtually equal sample sizes and sex ratios 
in each study year (cf. Table 1). The average body mass index (BMI) of the study population 
was 23.1 kg/m². The volume of the acquired 24 h‐urine samples varied substantially from 
490 to 3,438 mL, with an arithmetic mean of 1,874 mL. On average, the creatinine 
concentration was 0.91 g per liter urine. Creatinine levels ranged from 0.18 to 3.73 g/L. Male 
ESB participants tended to have higher BMI values and urinary creatinine levels than 
females. 
To investigate possible regional/seasonal differences of glyphosate and AMPA levels 40 urine 
samples collected in January 2005 and 2015 at the ESB sampling location Muenster (city in 
north‐western Germany) have additionally been analyzed. Moreover, 20 urine samples from 
vegetarian or vegan participants have been analyzed as well, to investigate differences due 
to diet. These samples were collected in Greifswald in the years 2007 (10 females) and 2015 
(5 males and 5 females) and represent all available samples from vegetarian or vegan 
participants. A description of the two additionally analyzed comparative ESB sub‐populations 
(cf. section 3.2) is provided in Table 2. Participants in Muenster tended to have slightly lower 
BMI values. The other sub‐population of self‐reported vegetarians/vegans also exhibited 
lower average BMI values as well as higher 24 h‐urine sample volumes and lower urinary 
creatinine concentrations. 
2.2 Analytical procedure  
The chemical analysis was based on the method by Alferness and Iwata (1994) initially 
developed for trace analysis of Glyphosate and AMPA in food which uses gas 
chromatography (GC) coupled with a single quadrupole mass selective detector (MSD). The 
newly developed method applied in the present study used GC with tandem mass 
spectrometry (GC‐MS‐MS) to reach a low limit of quantification (LOQ) in human urine along 
with high selectivity. Isotope labeled internal standards have been used for further 
increasing the method’s performance. 
2.2.1 Standards and reagents 
All chemicals were of analytical grade unless stated otherwise. Reference compounds 
(glyphosate and AMPA) and internal standards (1,2‐13C2‐15N‐glyphosate and 13C‐15N‐AMPA) 
were obtained from Dr. Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany) as solutions in water (10 µg/mL 
  
Page 5 
each). 2,2,2‐trifluoroethanol (99 %), trifluoroacetic anhydride (99 %) and acetonitrile were 
purchased from Sigma‐Aldrich (Seelze, Germany). Methanol was obtained from Merck 
(Darmstadt, Germany). Water was purified by an ultra‐water purification system from ELGA 
(Ransbach‐Baumbach, Germany). 
2.2.2 Sample preparation 
50 µL of urine sample and 25 µL of the internal standard (IS) solution (containing 4 ng/mL of 
each IS) were transferred to 10 mL screw‐capped glass tubes containing 1 mL of acetonitrile. 
After evaporation to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge, 0.5 mL of 2,2,2‐trifluoroethanol and 
1 mL of freezing cold (‐40 °C) trifluoroacetic anhydride were added cautiously to the residue. 
The derivatization of the analytes was started by heating the closed tubes to 85 °C for 1 h in 
a heating block. After cooling down to room temperature the mixture was cautiously 
evaporated to dryness. The oily residue was then dissolved in 100 µL of methanol and 
transferred into a microvial. This final solution was used for GC‐MS‐MS analysis. 
Mixed glyphosate and AMPA calibration solutions were prepared by serial dilution of a stock 
solution (each 5 ng/mL) in solutions of 50 µL water in 1 mL acetonitrile containing 25 µL of 
the IS‐solution. These solutions were processed in the same way as described for human 
urine samples and represent sample concentrations from 0.1 to 10 µg/L. 
2.2.3 GC‐MS‐MS analysis 
The derivatized analytes were separated by gas chromatography using a GC system7890 
equipped with a split/split less injector (Agilent) and a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel). The GC 
column was a HP INNOWAX, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film 
thickness (Agilent). 1 µL of the sample solution was injected split‐less. To improve the 
chromatographic performance, highly deactivated SKYTM liner (Restek) were used. The 
injector temperature was 255 °C. The oven temperature was held at 75 °C for 0.5 min, then 
ramped to 170 °C at 20 °C per min, and was held for 5 min. Afterwards, a 3.5 min bake‐out at 
260 °C was carried out to elute high‐boiling compounds. Helium 4.5 was used as carrier gas 
with a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. 
Quantification was performed by an Agilent 7000 mass spectrometer (MS‐MS) operated in 
negative ion mode. The mass spectrometric parameter and ion transitions used are 
summarized in Table 3. While the primary transitions are well suitable for quantification of 
glyphosate and AMPA at low environmental internal exposure levels, the secondary 
  
Page 6 
transitions of glyphosate and AMPA only worked well at urine concentrations beyond 
approx. 20 µg/L to confirm the identity of analytes. As the method is clearly focused on 
reaching the lowest quantification limits in human urine, the secondary transitions were not 
considered. The high specificity of the primary ion transition of was evaluated during the 
validation of analytical method (cf. section 2.2.4). 
2.2.4 Validation and quality assurance measures of analytical method 
For evaluation of the method performance the requirement of SANCO guideline 825 
(European Commission, 2010) were considered which are mandatory for analytical methods 
in the context of pesticide registration and monitoring. We investigated specificity, linearity, 
working range, accuracy, precision and LOQ for evaluation of the method. 
The specificity of the analytical method was checked by the chromatography of unfortified 
human urine samples which showed no other interfering peaks besides the analytes. 
Further, the sample solutions of 44 unfortified human urine samples containing residues of 
glyphosate were analyzed in parallel using separation columns with phases of different 
selectivity (HP INNOWAX vs. ZEBRON 5). Analyzed concentrations of glyphosate (n = 44 > 
LOQ) and AMPA (n = 25 > LOQ) ranged from 0.2 to 5 µg/L on both columns and correlated 
well: The respective slopes of the linear regression lines were close to unity (1.03 for 
glyphosate and 1.12 for AMPA) and the coefficients of determination (R2) reached 
satisfactory values (0.9968 for glyphosate and 0.9893 for AMPA). Summarizing, it can be 
concluded that the primary transition is very selective and allows a reliable quantification of 
glyphosate and AMPA. 
Basic calibration was performed by the measurement of 8 calibration solutions with 
concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 µg/L. A linear relationship between concentration and 
the ratio of the peak area of glyphosate and AMPA and its internal standards was observed. 
All calibration curve points were within 15 % of their respective theoretical value. 
The linear correlation coefficients were typically > 0.99. Calibration curves for glyphosate 
and AMPA based on water and pooled human urine were both linear (each R2 > 0.99) and 
ran parallel. The slopes differed only by approx. 2 %. This indicates that possible matrix 
effects are well compensated by the internal standards and matrix matched calibration 
solutions are not required for accurate determination of glyphosate and AMPA. 
  
Page 7 
The LOQ for glyphosate and AMPA was determined by fortification of human urine samples. 
The lower level at 0.1 µg/L demonstrated sufficient recovery (86 to 115 %) and precision (8.9 
to 9.1 %) for both analytes. This concentration was set as the LOQ of the GC‐MS‐MS method. 
The urine samples were analyzed in a randomized order. Blank values (urine substituted by 
water) were measured during the analysis of urine samples regularly every 15th sample. All 
blank values were below the LOQ of 0.1 µg/L. 
Evaluation of the accuracy and precision of the method was performed through recovery 
experiments. Pooled human urine samples with no detectable amount of glyphosate and 
AMPA (each < 0.1 µg/L) were fortified at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5 µg/L on 8 replicates each level. 
The recovery values ranged from 81 to 106 % with a relative standard deviation (RSD) below 
8.3 %. 
Further, we performed recovery experiments using individual human urine samples to check 
for possible matrix effects caused by variations in the composition of the samples. Ten 
individual urine samples free of glyphosate and AMPA (each < 0.1 µg/L) were spiked at 0.5, 
2.5 and 5 µg/L and were analyzed in triplicate. The recoveries ranged from 87 to 110% 
proving that possible matrix effects were compensated by the internal standards 13C2‐15N‐
glyphosate and 13C‐15N‐AMPA. 
In addition, the performance of the method was checked by measuring of control samples 
spiked at 0.5 and 2.5 µg/L during the analysis of the samples from this study (about every 
33rd sample). A summary of the results of the control samples is provided in Table 4. 
2.3 Statistical analysis 
Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations below the LOQ were set to LOQ/2 prior to statistical 
evaluation. All data analyses were carried out in SPSS Statistics Version 20 (IBM Corporation, 
2011). Differences between frequencies were tested with Pearson’s Chi² test of 
independence after cross tabulation. Correlations between variables were quantified by 
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, as concentration and other data mostly contained 
few extreme values. Box‐plots were created in R Version 3.2.3 (R Core Team, 2015) 
displaying the 25th, median and 75th percentile as a box. The whiskers were set to extend to 
the minimum and maximum value, due to considerable skewness and obvious non‐normality 
of the data. All p‐values of 0.05 or lower were considered to indicate statistical significance.

3 Results and discussion 
3.1 Urinary concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in the main study sample 
3.1.1 Frequency of quantifiable concentrations 
Out of the 399 analyzed urine samples, 127 (= 31.8 %) contained glyphosate concentrations 
that reached or exceeded the LOQ of 0.1 µg/L. For AMPA this was the case for 160 (= 40.1 %) 
of all samples. The fraction of samples at or above LOQ varied significantly over the years 
investigated, both for glyphosate (p ≤ 0.001) and AMPA (p = 0.005). As displayed in Table 5 
and Figure 1, years with the highest quantification rates were 2012 (57.5 %) and 2013 
(56.4 %) after rates having discontinuously increased from 10.0 % in 2001. Fractions of at 
least 0.1 µg/L were lower again in 2014 and 2015 with 32.5 % and 40.0 %, respectively. The 
overall trend for quantifiable AMPA levels was quite similar. The highest fraction of samples 
reaching or exceeding the LOQ was observed for samples taken in 2012 (60.0 %).The 
fractions of quantifiable levels of glyphosate and AMPA per year were generally higher in 
males. Especially for glyphosate, the principally increasing trend in urine concentrations was 
mainly due to samples provided by males (cf. Table 5). Fractions of quantifiable glyphosate 
levels in samples from females were particularly high only in 2012 (55.0 %) and 2013 
(47.4 %). The same difference between males and females was also apparent – yet less 
pronounced – for AMPA. 
Glyphosate sales in Germany have increased substantially from approx. 3,300 tons in 2000 to 
approx. 5,400 tons in 2014. The interim peak of approx. 7,600 tons in 2008 might be 
interrelated with the abolishment of EU set‐aside requirements announced in 2007 (BBC 
News, 2007; European Commission, 2008). Against the background of these data, the 
increase in quantifiable glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in analyzed ESB urine samples 
were in agreement with expectations. Although the internal exposure to glyphosate and 
AMPA seems to have decreased again since 2013, there was a clear increase in comparison 
to 2001. The possible reduction in exposure since 2013 indicated by ESB data may be due to 
changes in application of glyphosate in agriculture: Austria, for example, banned the pre‐
harvest use of glyphosate in 2013 (GTF, 2014). Also in Germany, intended glyphosate uses as 
pre‐harvest treatment have been restricted (e. g. to partial applications instead of whole 
field treatments) from 2014 onwards. Currently, no German sales data are available for the 
year 2015.

3.1.2 Distribution of concentrations  
The 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles and maximal values for glyphosate and AMPA levels by 
sex and study year are provided in Table 5. Only in 2012 and 2013 the median concentration 
of glyphosate was slightly above the LOQ of 0.1 µg/L. The 75th percentile exceeded the LOQ 
in all study years after 2007, reaching highest values in 2012 and 2013. The 95th percentiles 
of glyphosate concentrations in 24 h‐urine were substantially higher in 2013 (1.12 µg/L) and 
2014 (0.80 µg/L) compared to all other years. Also the maximum concentrations of 
glyphosate peaked in these two years (2013: 2.80 µg/L, 2014: 1.78 µg/L). 
The median urinary AMPA concentration only slightly exceeded the LOQ in 2012. With the 
exception of the first year of the study, 2001, all 75th percentiles exceeded the LOQ with the 
highest level observed in 2013. The 95th percentiles of AMPA levels peaked in 2013. The two 
highest AMPA concentrations were observed in samples from 2013 (1.88 µg/L and 
1.54 µg/L). 
The observed urinary glyphosate and AMPA concentrations are in good agreement with 
findings from other studies (Hoppe, 2013; Krüger et al., 2014; LANUV, 2016; Niemann et al., 
2015). In view of these results, ESB data can be assumed to provide a reliable indication of 
the background exposure to glyphosate and AMPA in Germany and its change from 2001 to 
2015. Comparability with other studies is of course limited i. a. due to differences in the 
study population and in the type of urine samples. 
As displayed in Figure 2 and Figure 3 glyphosate and AMPA concentrations were generally 
higher in samples from male ESB participants compared to samples from female 
participants. From 2011 onwards, median levels and 75th percentiles for glyphosate were 
higher in males. Box‐plots for AMPA concentrations exhibit the same pattern. The maximum 
values for glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine, however, were observed in 
samples from female ESB participants. 
Up to now, there is no satisfactory explanation for the differing urinary glyphosate and 
AMPA levels in males and females. The differences in urinary glyphosate might be due to 
differences in exposure patterns between males and females or to sex‐related differences in 
physiological determinants of glyphosate and AMPA in urine. To further elucidate these 
aspects, additional research is necessary.

3.1.3 Correlations between glyphosate, AMPA and physiological parameters 
Spearman rank correlations between glyphosate and AMPA levels in urine and physiological 
parameters observed in the main study sample are summarized in Table 6. Glyphosate and 
AMPA concentrations in urine were statistically correlated (spearman rank correlations 
coefficient rS = 0.506, p ≤ 0.001). When calculating coefficients of rank correlation separately 
for each study year, glyphosate and AMPA levels correlated statistically significantly in all 
years except for the first two, 2001 and 2003. For the following eight years of the study, rS 
ranged between 0.360 and 0.616 (all p‐values ≤ 0.05). A statistically significant association 
between glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine was also observed when cross 
tabulating all quantifiable and non‐quantifiable levels for both analytes as well as when 
calculating the Pearson product‐moment correlation coefficient (data not shown). There 
were, however, urine samples with comparatively high glyphosate and quite low AMPA 
concentrations, and vice versa. 
The coefficients of correlation of glyphosate and AMPA with BMI were comparatively low 
and statistically significant only for glyphosate. Correlations between BMI and glyphosate 
concentrations in urine were only statistically significant at the 5 % level in 2011 (rS = 0.344) 
and 2015 (rS = 0.365). For AMPA, only the correlation of the concentrations in urine with the 
participants’ BMI in 2015 reached statistical significance (rS = 0.346). 
Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine were consistently negatively correlated with 
the urine sample volume (rS = ‐0.278 and ‐0.327) and positively correlated with urinary 
creatinine levels (rS = 0.347 and 0.373). All these coefficients of correlation were statistically 
significant (p ≤ 0.001). The BMI was positively correlated with the creatinine concentration in 
24 h‐urine samples (rS = 0.252, p ≤ 0.001). Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine 
were positively associated with urinary creatinine in all study years. The coefficients of 
correlation were statistically significant at the 5 % level in almost all study years. Examined 
for the individual years of the study, the rS of urine sample volume and glyphosate as well as 
AMPA levels were consistently negative. The correlation, however, was often not statistically 
significant. 
These results warrant a further discussion on options for a combined consideration of 
glyphosate and AMPA in exposure assessment. The quite low – yet significant – correlation 
  
Page 11 
between BMI and glyphosate deserves attention when further investigating glyphosate 
exposure via food consumption.  
The negative association of glyphosate and AMPA concentrations with 24 h‐urine sample 
volumes and positive association with urinary creatinine concentrations are in line with 
expectations, as both parameters reflect the individual urinary diluteness. 24 h‐creatinine 
excretion is usually higher in males (Forni Ogna et al., 2015). Hence, this result is of interest 
for the further analysis of sex‐related differences in urinary glyphosate and AMPA. 
3.2 Comparison with other ESB sub‐populations 
To get a first insight into differences in exposures due to the place of residence and season 
of sampling, 40 urine samples collected in 2005 and 2015 at the ESB sampling location 
Muenster were also analyzed for glyphosate and AMPA. In contrast to samples being taken 
in April/May in Greifswald, the annual Muenster sampling is carried out in January. The 
summary statistics for glyphosate and AMPA in this sub‐population are given in Table 7. In 
2005 and 2015 the percentage of quantifiable glyphosate levels was significantly higher in 
the main study sample (Greifswald) than in Muenster (2005: 30.0 % vs. 5.0 %, p = 0.003 and 
2015: 40.0 % vs. 15.0 %, p = 0.012). For AMPA no statistically significant differences between 
Greifswald and Muenster samples were observed in 2005 (40.0% vs. 27.5 %, p = 0.24) and 
2015 (42.5 % vs. 35.0 %, p = 0.49). Also the 75th and 95th percentile of urinary glyphosate 
concentrations in the main study sample are higher than in samples collected in Muenster. 
For AMPA these percentiles are quite similar for both populations. 
A second comparative subsample analyzed for glyphosate and AMPA consists of 10 samples 
provided in 2007 and 2015 by self‐reported vegetarians/vegans taking part in Greifswald (cf. 
Table 7). There was virtually no difference between self‐reported vegetarians/vegans and 
the main study sample concerning quantifiable percentages of glyphosate in 2007 and 2015. 
For AMPA the fractions of samples with levels of at least 0.1 µg/L tended to be lower for 
vegetarians/vegans (2007: 0.0 % vs. 30.0 %, p = 0.047 and 2015: 30.0 % vs. 42.5 %, p = 0.47), 
being statistically significant only in 2007. In that year, all self‐reported vegans/vegetarians 
who participated in Greifswald were female. When limiting the comparison to samples 
collected from women, the difference observed in 2007 was less pronounced and not 
statistically significant anymore (0.0 % vs. 25.0 %, p = 0.083).

Glyphosate concentrations in urine seem slightly higher in the main study sample in 
comparison to the Muenster sub‐population. Although there are virtually no differences in 
urinary AMPA, this result hints to the possibility of regional or seasonal differences in 
exposure. Against expectations, the results of this study do not advocate urinary glyphosate 
and AMPA levels being higher in vegetarian/vegan participants. Unfortunately, no equal sex 
distribution could be achieved for the sub‐population of self‐reported vegetarians/vegans, 
due to a low participation rate of male vegetarians/vegans. This might especially reduce 
comparability of this sub‐population, as males tend to exhibit higher glyphosate and AMPA 
concentrations in urine. Another limitation of this comparison is that vegetarian/vegan 
participants exhibit on average higher 24 h‐urine sample volumes than in the main study 
sample without self‐reported specifically restricted diet. In general, the sample sizes of the 
two sub‐populations analyzed for comparison are possibly too small to draw general 
conclusions on seasonal or regional effects and on effects of dietary preferences. Therefore, 
larger scaled populations studies are warranted for further elucidate reasons for differences 
in internal glyphosate and AMPA exposure. 
3.3 Strengths and limitations of the study 
According to the authors’ knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive data on 
the time trend of glyphosate and AMPA in urine of the non‐specifically exposed general 
population without occupational exposure. The standardized sampling procedures applied in 
the German ESB are a main strength of this study, as they warrant the comparability of 
exposure data over time. The consistency of data is further improved by cryo‐preservation of 
samples and randomized analysis of all samples by means of up‐to‐date laboratory 
techniques. For some potentially important parameters, such as dietary preference, data 
was not available for all participants of this retrospective analysis, due to a later addition of 
these items to the ESB questionnaire. This causes some limitation of the study’s explanatory 
power. 
As only 30 to 40 % of glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine reached or exceeded the 
LOQ, the statistical analysis had to focus on differences in the fraction of quantifiable levels. 
A more sensitive method for quantifying glyphosate and AMPA appears necessary to 
overcome this limitation in future studies. Considering actual concentrations as the 
  
Page 13 
explained variables in statistical analysis promises to provide additional insight especially 
into differences in glyphosate and AMPA exposure between sub‐populations. 
The analysis of 24 h‐urine samples is another important strength of the study, as it can be 
assumed to reflect the exposure to pesticides during one day more reliably than spot urine 
or first‐morning‐void sample (Scher et al., 2006). The narrow age range of the study 
population supports the identification of changes in internal exposure over time. Adults aged 
20 to 29 years, however, can represent the overall German population only to a limited 
extent. 
3.4 Health‐relevance of observed internal exposure 
The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for glyphosate derived by the European Food Safety 
Authority (EFSA) is 0.5 mg/kg/d (EFSA, 2015). Assuming a bodyweight of 60 kg, an oral 
absorption of 20 % with fast elimination via urine, and a daily urine excretion of 1,500 to 
2,000 mL, the concentration in 24 h‐urine associated with this ADI results in 3,000 to 
4,000 µg/L. This concentration is higher than the maximum concentration observed in this 
study (2.8 µg/L) by a factor of 1,000. Considering EFSA’s risk assessment, no glyphosate 
concentration measured in ESB samples is problematic for human health. The International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), however, classified glyphosate in Group 2A 
(“probably carcinogenic to humans”). Taking this assessment into account, especially the 
increasing trend in internal glyphosate exposure documented by ESB samples deserves 
attention with regard to human health. 
4 Outlook 
Building on the results presented in this paper, the German ESB will continue to follow the 
time trend of urinary concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in young adults, for which 
occupational exposure can be excluded. This is necessary to verify whether the exposure has 
further decreased since 2015. In case of a further regulation of glyphosate as active 
substance in plant protection products in the European Union or voluntary reductions in 
application, updated ESB data promise to support the evaluation of the effectiveness and 
efficiency of these actions. 
Multivariate analysis of glyphosate and AMPA concentration data – taking into account at 
least sex, urinary creatinine, urine sample volume, and BMI – is likely to provide further 
  
Page 14 
insight into reasons for differences in human exposure to these compounds. ESB 
questionnaire data on food consumption frequencies may further increase the explanatory 
power of such statistical models. 
For further elucidating the variation in the population’s exposure, the German Environment 
Agency currently is analyzing morning urine samples acquired in the cross‐sectionally 
designed population‐representative German Environmental Survey for Children and 
Adolescents (GerES 2014‐2017) (Kolossa‐Gehring et al., 2012) for glyphosate and AMPA.
