IMPORTANCE Administration-to-birth intervals of antenatal corticosteroids (ANS) vary. The
significance of this variation is unclear. Specifically, to our knowledge, the shortest effective
administration-to-birth interval is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To explore the associations between ANS administration-to-birth interval and
survival and morbidity among very preterm infants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe (EPICE)
study, a population-based prospective cohort study, gathered data from 19 regions in 11
European countries in 2011 and 2012 on 4594 singleton infants with gestational ages
between 24 and 31 weeks, without severe anomalies and unexposed to repeated courses of
ANS. Data were analyzed November 2016.
EXPOSURE Time from first injection of ANS to delivery in hours and days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three outcomes were studied: in-hospital mortality; a
composite of mortality or severe neonatal morbidity, defined as an intraventricular hemorrhage
grade of 3 or greater, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, surgical necrotizing enterocolitis, or
stage 3 or greater retinopathy of prematurity; and severe neonatal brain injury, defined as an
intraventricular hemorrhage grade of 3 or greater or cystic periventricular leukomalacia.
RESULTS Of the 4594 infants included in the cohort, 2496 infants (54.3%) were boys, and
the mean (SD) gestational age was 28.5 (2.2) weeks and mean (SD) birth weight was 1213
(400) g. Mortality for the 662 infants (14.4%) unexposed to ANS was 20.6% (136 of 661).
Administration of ANS was associated with an immediate and rapid decline in mortality,
reaching a plateau with more than 50% risk reduction after an administration-to-birth
interval of 18 to 36 hours. A similar pattern for timing was seen for the composite mortality or
morbidity outcome, whereas a significant risk reduction of severe neonatal brain injury was
associated with longer administration-to-birth intervals (greater than 48 hours). For all
outcomes, the risk reduction associated with ANS was transient, with increasing mortality
and risk for severe neonatal brain injury associated with administration-to-birth intervals
exceeding 1 week. Under the assumption of a causal relationship between timing of ANS and
mortality, a simulation of ANS administered 3 hours before delivery to infants who did not
receive ANS showed that their estimated decline in mortality would be 26%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antenatal corticosteroids may be effective even if given only
hours before delivery. Therefore, the infants of pregnant women at risk of imminent preterm
delivery may benefit from its use.

 A
ntenatal corticosteroids (ANS) reduce morbidity and
mortality in preterm infants and are recommended for
women at risk of delivery before 34 weeks’gestation.1-5
Antenatal corticosteroids have been estimated to reduce in-
fant mortality by 31%, respiratory distress syndrome by 34%,
intraventricular hemorrhage by 46%, and necrotizing entero-
colitis by 54%.4
While there seems to be agreement that neonatal ben-
efits are maximized when ANS are administered 24 hours to 7
days before delivery,4,6-13 less is known about other and nar-
rower administration-to-birth intervals.5 In particular, to our
knowledge, the latest point at which ANS can be effectively
used is not known.3 Given favorable pharmacokinetics14 and
rapid circulatory effects,15-18 ANS may be effective even hours
before birth. At the other end of the administration-to-birth
interval, some6-11 but not all12,13 studies suggest declining
benefits from ANS if administered more than 7 days before
preterm birth. Limitations in statistical power, varying
exposures,5,19 and outcomes6-13 may contribute to such di-
verse results and interpretations.
Because the problem of timely prediction of preterm de-
livery remains unresolved,20 administration of ANS will con-
tinue to occur hours, days, or weeks before delivery. There-
fore, a more detailed understanding of the importance of the
administration-to-birth interval of ANS for infant outcome is
needed. The objective of this study was to investigate associa-
tionsbetweendifferentadministration-to-birthintervalsofANS
in hours and morbidity and mortality in very preterm infants.
Methods
The Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe (EPICE) co-
hort study is a population-based study on the use of evidence-
based practices in very preterm births with less than 32 weeks’
gestation in 19 regions across 11 European countries, con-
ducted in 2011 and 2012 (http://www.epiceproject.eu).21
Geographicandorganizationaldiversity,feasibility,andsample
size were accounted for when selecting regions. Inclusions
occurred over a 12-month period except in France (6-month
period). Ethics approval was obtained in each region, as
required by national legislation. The European study was also
approved by the French Advisory Committee on Use of Health
DatainMedicalResearch(CCTIRS)andtheFrenchCommission
for Data Protection and Liberties (CNIL). Informed parental
consent (active or passive, depending on each participating
country’
s national legislations) was obtained; in some regions,
consentrequirementswerewaivedbyethicsboardsforparents
notincludedinthefollow-upcohort(ie,stillbirthsandneonatal
deaths), as data were deidentified and from routine sources.
Study Population
From a total of 10 329 births, we excluded 2429 terminations
of pregnancy and stillbirths, 126 infants with severe congeni-
tal anomalies, 2336 multiples, 300 infants born at 22 and 23
weeks’gestationalage(GA),22362infantsofmotherswithmiss-
ing data on date and time of ANS administration, and 182 in-
fants of mothers who had received more than 1 course of ANS.
A repeated course was defined as an interval between ANS in-
jections exceeding 1 week. The final sample consisted of 4594
singleton live-births at 24 to 31 weeks’GA (Figure 1). Adminis-
trationofcorticosteroidsduringpregnancyforindicationsother
than preterm birth was not included in the study protocol.
Exposure
For each infant, information was collected on dates and times
of the first ANS injection as well as the total number of injec-
tions. Questionnaires were also sent to the heads of the ma-
ternity units regularly managing 10 or more very preterm ad-
missions annually. Most maternity units (123 of 135 [91.1%])
responded,andprotocolsforANS,includingtypeofdrug,doses,
and number and intervals of injections, were collected.
We defined our exposure as time from the first injection
of ANS to delivery. We classified ANS exposure in 4 categories
(no ANS, first injection <24 hours, first injection between 24
hours and 7 days, and first injection >7 days before birth) for
descriptive analyses of the characteristics of women and new-
borns and for comparison with other studies.6 For more de-
tailed analyses of associations between timing of ANS and out-
come,weusedadministration-to-birthintervalsasacontinuous
variable. We did not include information on 1 or several doses
of ANS because of high collinearity between timing of ANS and
number of doses; 866 of 1111 women (77.9%) receiving ANS less
than 24 hours prior to delivery received only 1 dose.
For some women, we only had information on the date of
ANS administration but not the time. This caused problems
for our classifications when administration was within 2 days
of delivery (204 of 1522 women [13.4%] delivering within 2
days). For a solution, we used multiple imputations chained
equations to impute these data based on all variables in the
study in addition to the time of delivery, date of administra-
tion, and number of injections received. We used 100 im-
puted data sets.23 Results are presented using imputed data.
Outcomes
Based on the evidence of the effects of ANS on preterm
infants,1-5 the outcomes selected were in-hospital mortality,
a composite of mortality or severe neonatal morbidity or both,
or severe neonatal brain injury. In-hospital mortality was de-
fined as death before discharge home. Severe neonatal mor-
bidity was defined as an intraventricular hemorrhage grade of
3 or 4,24 cystic periventricular leukomalacia,25 stage 3, 4, or 5
Key Points
Question What is the shortest administration-to-birth interval of
antenatal corticosteroids that promotes survival and decreases
neonatal morbidity in very preterm infants?
Findings In a population-based cohort of 4594 European infants
born before 32 weeks’gestation, we found that in-hospital
mortality was significantly reduced when antenatal corticosteroids
had been administered only a few hours prior to delivery.
Meaning Encouraging administration of antenatal corticosteroids
when delivery is very imminent could result in substantial survival
and health gains for very preterm infants.

 retinopathy of prematurity,26 or severe necrotizing enteroco-
litis (assessed as need for surgery or peritoneal drainage; Bell
stages27 were not routinely recorded in all regions) among in-
fants discharged alive. Severe neonatal brain injury was de-
fined as an intraventricular hemorrhage grade of 3 or 4, cystic
periventricularleukomalacia,orboth.Wedidnotincludebron-
chopulmonary dysplasia into our composite outcome be-
cause of regional variability in respiratory management and
oxygen saturation targets have major effects on rates of bron-
chopulmonary dysplasia.28
Covariables
Covariables that could be potential confounders of the asso-
ciations between timing of ANS and infant outcome were se-
lected based on the literature4,6,29-32 and clinical knowledge.
We included variables reflecting case mix (maternal age; par-
ity;pregnancycomplications,includingpreeclampsia,eclamp-
sia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelet
count syndrome; preterm prelabor rupture of membranes; GA
[defined as best assessment based on last menstrual period or
antenatal ultrasonography, part of routine obstetric care in all
regions]; smallness for gestational age [defined as birth weight
less than the third and between the third and 10th centiles,
based on customized intrauterine growth curves33]; and in-
fant sex) and variables related to management of the delivery
(birth at a level III neonatal unit; mode of delivery; and deliv-
ery on same day as admission to hospital). Preeclampsia was
defined as hypertension after 20 weeks’GA (blood pressure
of140/90mmHgorhigher)andproteinuriawithaproteinlevel
of 0.3 g/L or greater, and eclampsia was defined as hyperten-
sion associated with convulsions or coma. Preterm prelabor
rupture of membranes was defined as spontaneous rupture of
membranes 12 hours or more before onset of contractions.
Statistical Analyses
We first compared perinatal characteristics in our study
population by timing of ANS administration using 4 catego-
ries. We then modeled the associations between ANS
administration-to-birth intervals and the 3 outcomes using
the 4-category variable and a continuous variable in hours.
For the latter analysis, we used restricted cubic splines with
5 knots located at the fifth, 20th, 28th, 40th, and 95th per-
centiles (knots placed at 0, 1, 6, 24, and 520 hours) for mor-
tality and the composite mortality and morbidity outcome.
We selected 3 knots close to each other because of strong
nonlinearity in the first 24 hours after ANS. For severe neo-
natal brain injury, we used the default percentiles (knots
placed at 0, 6, 49, 122, and 525 hours) used by Harrell.34
Generalized linear models, assuming a Poisson distribution,
were used to estimate risk ratios35 across exposures for all
analyses. Adjusted models included population case mix
and pregnancy management variables, as described above.
Region was included as a fixed effect, and we accounted for
clustering between observations within regions.
Finally, we assessed the effect on in-hospital mortality if
all infants without ANS had been administered ANS less than
3 hours, 3 to 5 hours, and 6 to 12 hours before delivery by re-
running our final 4-category model and subdividing the less-
than-24-hours category into these subgroups; we then pre-
dicted mortality after setting the population with no ANS
sequentially to the first, second, and third subgroups.
M.N., A.P., and J.Z. analyzed the data. Analyses were car-
ried out using STATA version 14.0 SE (StataCorp).
Results
The most common ANS protocol was two 12-mg injections 24
hours apart (performed in 105 of 123 units [85.4%]), followed
by two 12-mg injections 12 hours apart (performed in 13 units
[10.6%]). Another 4 units (3.3%) used other protocols. Beta-
methasone was used in 97 units (78.9%), dexamethasone in
6 units (4.9%), and both in 19 units (15.4%) (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Distribution of Administration-to-Birth Intervals
Fewer than half of included women (1871 of 4594 [40.7%]) re-
ceived ANS 24 hours to 7 days before delivery, ie, by current
standards, the administration-to-birth interval considered to
be optimal. Many women received ANS closer to delivery (1111
[24.2%]) or did not receive ANS (662 [14.4%]) (Table 1). The
cumulativedistributionofadministration-to-birthintervalsare
presented in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. Administration and
timing of ANS varied across the 19 European regions (eFigure
2 in the Supplement).
Perinatal Characteristics by Timing of ANS
Variables reflecting population case mix and management of
pretermdeliverydifferedbetweenANScategories,withtheex-
ception of infant sex (Table 1). In particular, women receiving
ANS more than 7 days before delivery were more likely to have
preterm prelabor rupture of membranes and a higher GA and
to deliver in a level III unit. Of patients with missing data, 235
of 362 (64.9%) came from 3 of the 19 regions, reflecting diffi-
culties in data collection. After adjustment on region, infants
with missing information were more often born to mothers
with preeclampsia, more often delivered with cesarean sec-
tion, and less often born at level III units than infants in the
study population (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

 Timing of ANS and Outcome
Using 4 categories of ANS timing, any ANS—irrespective of the
administration-to-birthinterval—wasassociatedwithlowerin-
fant mortality than no ANS, with the largest risk reduction for
ANS administered 24 hours to 7 days before delivery (ad-
justed risk ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.6). Antenatal corticoste-
roids administered 24 hours to 7 days before delivery was also
associatedwithlowerrisksofmortalityorsevereneonatalmor-
bidity and of lower risk for severe neonatal brain injury than
no ANS (Table 2).
Increasing the resolution of the analyses by expressing the
risk for our 3 outcomes as a continuous function of the admin-
istration-to-birth interval, ANS less than 12 hours before birth
was associated with an immediate and rapid decline in mor-
tality, followed by a slower risk reduction and reaching a pla-
teauwithmorethan50%riskreductionafteranadministration-
to-birth interval of 18 to 36 hours (Figure 2). A similar pattern
for timing of ANS was seen for the composite outcome of mor-
tality or severe neonatal morbidity (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment), whereas a significant risk reduction of severe neonatal
brain injury was associated with longer administration-
to-birth intervals (Figure 3). For all outcomes, the risk reduc-
tion associated with ANS was transient, with increasing mor-
tality and risk for severe neonatal brain injury associated with
ANS administration-to-birth intervals of 5 to 7 days or more.
In a simulation of providing ANS for the 661 infants in
the sample who did not receive ANS, our model predicted a
26% decrease in mortality if these infants received ANS at

ANS 3 to 5 hours before delivery, and a 51% decrease if they
received ANS 6 to 12 hours before delivery (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that infant mortality was rapidly and sig-
nificantly reduced when ANS were administered only a few
hours before delivery. Infant birth 12 hours following ANS ad-
ministrationwasassociatedwithsimilarmortalityriskasthose
exposed to ANS 18 to 48 hours before delivery. Under the as-
sumption of a causal relationship between timing of ANS and
mortality, our simulations showed that if infants with no ANS
prior to delivery received ANS 6 to 12 hours before delivery,
their mortality was estimated to have been reduced by 51%.
Furthermore, the administration of ANS was associated with
a significant reduction in severe neonatal morbidity.
Our findings challenge current thinking about the opti-
mal timing of ANS. Previously, ANS administered less than 24
hours before birth have been referred to as suboptimal,36
partial,12orincomplete,9suggestingpoorereffectivenessatad-
ministration-to-birth intervals less than 24 hours. However,
the categories used in previous studies appear to have hid-
den clinically important effects of ANS occurring within this
period. In addition, given that most (77.9%) pregnant women
in our study delivering within 24 hours of ANS only received
1 injection, significant effects may be achieved by a single ANS
injection.19 In this context, we note with interest the recent
statement by the National Institute for Health and Care Excel-
lence Guideline Development Committee3; taking account of
the pharmacological mechanism of action of ANS, the com-
mittee suspects that any benefits from ANS would likely be
transferred even if there was only a limited amount of time be-
tween administration and time of birth.
The underlying mechanisms for the rapid actions of ANS
suggested herein are not fully understood. Cord blood con-
centrations of ANS peak 1 hour after administration to the
mother and become undetectable 2 days after the last dose.14
While induction of many corticosteroid effects involve ge-
nomic interactions and therefore take time,18 nongenomic ef-
fects of corticosteroids have in more recent years also been dis-
covered. These effects can be very rapid and occur within
minutes.17,18 Nongenomic effects may contribute to findings
in preterm lambs, demonstrating beneficial corticosteroid ef-
fects on pulmonary edema and blood pressure within 8 hours
after administration and significant lung function improve-
ment within 15 hours.16 In humans, fetal movements and heart
variabilityincreasedsignificantlywithin8hoursafterANS,pos-
sibly indicating fetal well-being or fetal stress enhancing
maturation.15
Although the risk reduction was slower than that associ-
ated with survival—suggesting competing outcomes (mortal-
ity and morbidity) or that the underlying mechanisms may be
different—an ANS administration-to-birth interval of 48 hours
to 1 week was associated with a significantly reduced risk for
severe neonatal brain injury. A lower risk of severe neonatal

 compared with an interval of 1 to 7 days, a group represent-
ing 18.8% of all infants in our study. In 2015, Melamed et al6
reported similar findings using the Canadian Neonatal Net-
work. Repeated courses of corticosteroids (betamethasone
was the only drug tested) have been associated with a reduc-
tion in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and
possibly also severity of neonatal lung disease.38 At 2-year to
3-year follow-up, there was no evidence of either significant
benefit or harm with a repeated course of ANS in terms of
rates of neurosensory disabilities, developmental delay, or
growth failure.2,3,38 Follow-up in midchildhood demon-
strated long-term safety.39
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of our study include its prospective design,
large size, and heterogeneous population including both ter-
tiary and nontertiary centers all over Europe. This ensures
generalizability to a wide range of settings. Case mix, mortal-
ity, and morbidity rates are within the same ranges as previ-
ously reported from other high-income countries.6 We had
power and data in sufficient detail to perform adjusted
analyses on timing of ANS and outcome at very short
administration-to-birth intervals. The outcomes—infant sur-
vival and major neonatal morbidities—were robust and clini-
cally highly relevant.
Our study also has limitations. Even though we excluded
infants with malformations and infants born before 24 weeks’
GA, and even after adjusting for group differences presented
in Table 1, residual confounding may have occurred, as the
populations of women who delivered at various points after
ANS administration may have been different. We investi-
gated several outcomes, and multiple confidence intervals are
reported in this article; caution should be applied when evalu-
ating their joint statistical level. The EPICE database does not
contain information on time of admission, so we could not
determine admission-to-administration intervals. In addi-
tion, reasons for not treating pregnant women with ANS were
not available, and we cannot exclude that withholding treat-
ment may have occurred in some cases, especially at the
lower end of GAs. However, we were able to adjust for a wide
range of perinatal characteristics as well as factors reflecting
management.
In our cohort, 7.0% of women received ANS but had no
data on timing of administration; comparison of their char-
acteristics suggests that these missing data may represent
emergencies with suboptimal documentation. Some women
had incomplete data on timing; for these patients, we used
multiple imputation, which yielded results similar to com-
plete case analysis. Our study was descriptive with no
attempts in the study framework to standardize treatment,
and therefore, we were unable to investigate whether one
corticosteroid (or one particular dosing regimen) has advan-
tages over another.5,19
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results suggest significant health-
promoting effects of ANS beginning just hours before deliv-
ery. This new knowledge encourages a more proactive man-
agement of women at risk for imminent preterm birth, which
may help reduce infant mortality and severe neonatal brain in-
jury.Ourstudyalsohighlightsthatalargeproportionofwomen
remainatriskforverypretermbirthmorethan7daysafterANS
and that their infants have increased morbidity and mortal-
ity. We suggest that future research areas should include test-
ing optimal dosing (1 vs 2 doses) and dosing intervals of ANS.
Given the suggestion of very rapid action, immediate postna-
tal corticosteroid rescue for very preterm infants unexposed
to ANS could also be a topic for future research.
