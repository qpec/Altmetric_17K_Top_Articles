IMPORTANCE The incidence and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are thought to
be rising, but updated epidemiologic data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To explore the evolving epidemiology and investigate the effect of therapeutic
advances on survival of patients with NETs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective, population-based study using
nationally representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
program was conducted to evaluate 64 971 patients with NETs from 1973 to 2012. Associated
population data were used to determine annual age-adjusted incidence, limited-duration
prevalence, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates. Trends in survival from 2000 to 2012 were
evaluated for the entire cohort as well as specific subgroups, including distant-stage
gastrointestinal NETs and pancreatic NETs. Analyses were conducted between December
2015, and February 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Neuroendocrine tumor incidence, prevalence, and OS
rates.
RESULTS Of the 64 971 cases of NETs, 34 233 (52.7%) were women. The age-adjusted
incidence rate increased 6.4-fold from 1973 (1.09 per 100 000) to 2012 (6.98 per 100 000).
This increase occurred across all sites, stages, and grades. In the SEER 18 registry grouping
(2000-2012), the highest incidence rates were 1.49 per 100 000 in the lung, 3.56 per
100 000 in gastroenteropancreatic sites, and 0.84 per 100 000 in NETs with an unknown
primary site. The estimated 20-year limited-duration prevalence of NETs in the United States
on January 1, 2014, was 171 321. On multivariable analyses, the median 5-year OS rate varied
significantly by stage, grade, age at diagnosis, primary site, and time period of diagnosis. The
OS rate for all NETs improved from the 2000-2004 period to the 2009-2012 period (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.85). Even larger increases in OS between these periods were
noted in distant-stage gastrointestinal NETs (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.81) and distant-stage
pancreatic NETs (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.70).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence and prevalence of NETs are steadily rising,
possibly owing to detection of early-stage disease and stage migration. Survival for all NETs
has improved over time, especially for distant-stage gastrointestinal NETs and pancreatic
NETs in particular, reflecting improvement in therapies. These data will help to prioritize
future research directions.

G
iven the rarity and indolent clinical course of neuro-
endocrine tumors (NETs), the epidemiology of these
tumors is best studied in large, population-based reg-
istries with considerable longitudinal follow-up.1-3 The Na-
tional Cancer Institute’
s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) Program is a comprehensive source of popu-
lation-based information initiated in 1973 that is updated
annually.4,5 Previously, the most comprehensive population-
based study of NETs in the United States had been performed
by our group using the November 2006 submission of SEER
data with cases diagnosed up to 2004 that showed increasing
incidence.1 Since then, the SEER Program has expanded and
the current (SEER 18) registry grouping now includes approxi-
mately 30% of the US population. Diagnostic techniques for
NETs, such as computed tomography and endoscopy, have im-
proved and have likely increased NET diagnosis rates and ac-
curacy of staging.6-8 In addition, updated staging and grad-
ing classifications for NETs have been proposed and more
universally adopted, possibly further increasing the recogni-
tion of NETs and improving their pathologic classification.9-11
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the in-
creased incidence of NETs is associated mainly with the rise
in detection of early-stage disease.
The somatostatin analogue octreotide acetate was ini-
tially introduced in 1987 and as a long-acting release form in
1998 for management of carcinoid syndrome given their abil-
ity to inhibit hormone secretion by NETs.12 With the lack of ad-
equate treatment options for NETs until recently, these agents
were likely used for tumor control even before the comple-
tion of randomized trials (octreotide long-acting release in
mid-gut NETs in 2008 and lanreotide acetate for gastroen-
teropancreatic NETs in 2011) establishing their efficacy.1,13-15
In addition, for pancreatic NETs, the alkylating agent strepto-
zocin was the first drug approved in 1982; further research in
the mid-2000s showed that another alkylating agent, temo-
zolomide, also had antitumor activity.16,17 Given the rise in
early-stage disease and improvements in systemic therapies,
wealsohypothesizedthatthelimited-durationprevalence(the
proportion of patients alive on a certain day and diagnosed
within a limited duration prior to that date) would also be
increasing. Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to
comprehensivelyevaluatethedemographic,clinical,andprog-
nostic features of NETs using data from the SEER Program.
Methods
Data Source
The SEER database on the November 2014 submissions was
used for our study.4 The SEER Program is a coordinated sys-
tem of population-based state cancer registries collecting
incidence and survival data on cases reported from the target
geographic areas. Since its inception in 1973 (SEER 9 regis-
try), the program has undergone 2 major expansions to
include additional areas (SEER 13 in 1992 and SEER 18 in 2000)
and currently includes 20 geographic areas with demograph-
ics representative of the entire US population. The pertinent
population data are obtained from the US Census Bureau and
mortality data are obtained from the US National Center for
Health Statistics. Strict quality control is maintained by the
SEER Quality Improvement program that establishes stan-
dards for cancer registries and maintains them through con-
tinual monitoring, assessment, and education.5 We used his-
tologic codes from the International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology,3rd Edition, to identify patients with NETs, as de-
tailed in a prior publication.1 Per policy of The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, no institutional review
board approval was required for the study. Data analysis was
conducted between December 2015, and February 2017.
NET Classification
We used SEER histologic grade information to classify cases
as grade (G) 1, well differentiated; G2, moderately differenti-
ated; G3, poorly differentiated; and G4, undifferentiated or
anaplastic. G3 and G4 were combined into 1 category for all
analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Given that there are 3 SEER registry groupings, to maximize
the representativeness of our study, we calculated the 1973-
2012 incidences using SEER 9, the 1992-1999 incidences using
SEER 13, and the 2000-2012 incidences using SEER 18 data-
bases. Limited-duration prevalence rates were calculated for
10 and 20 years. We examined the 15-year survival by site and
stage using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Fur-
thermore,weprovidedthemedianoverallsurvival(OS)bysite,
stage, and grade with a maximum follow-up time of 30 years
using data from the SEER 9 registry. Finally, we provided the
most recent median, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates for dis-
tant-stage G1 and G2 NETs from the SEER 18 cohort. Time of
follow-up for all analyses was from the date of diagnosis until
death, date of last contact, or end of study period.
To evaluate the most recent trends in survival, we con-
ducted multivariable survival analyses of the SEER 18 data
(2000-2012). Three cohorts were identified for multivariable
survival analyses: the total SEER 18 NET cohort, which com-
prised all patients with NETs in SEER 18; the distant-stage gas-
trointestinal NET cohort (liver was excluded since it had a high
probability of being a metastatic rather than primary site); and
the distant-stage pancreatic NET cohort. The latter 2 cohorts
Key Points
Question Has the epidemiology of neuroendocrine tumors
changed over time?
Findings In this population-based study that included 64 971
patients with neuroendocrine tumors, age-adjusted incidence
rates increased 6.4-fold between 1973 and 2012, mostly for
early-stage tumors. Survival for all neuroendocrine tumors has
improved, especially for distant-stage gastrointestinal and
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
Meaning Neuroendocrine tumors are increasing in incidence and
prevalence owing to increased diagnosis of early-stage tumors.
Survival of patients with distant-stage tumors has improved,
reflecting improvements in therapies.

were chosen to evaluate the effect of advances in systemic
therapies for these sites on survival. Distant-stage pancreatic
NETs were analyzed separately given the unique biology and
clinical behavior of this subgroup. Five-year OS and the Cox
proportional hazards model were used in the multivariable
analysis, with censoring applied at 5 years.18 Covariates for this
analysisincludedfactorsknowntoinfluenceprognosisofNETs,
including grade, race, age, stage, site, and time interval from
diagnosis.1,2 The overall model was significant at P < .001.
Incidence (including annual percentage change) and lim-
ited-duration prevalence rates (10-year and 20-year) were cal-
culated using SEER*Stat software, version 8.2.1 (Surveillance
Research Program, National Cancer Institute). In this soft-
ware, annual percentage change is calculated by fitting a least-
squares regression to the natural logarithm of the rates, using
the calendar year as a regressor variable, and age-adjusted
incidence rates are computed using weighted proportions of
corresponding age groups in the 2000 US standard popula-
tion. The projected prevalence of NETs in the US population
on January 1, 2014, matched by age, sex, and race, was calcu-
lated using ProjPrev, version 1.0.4 (Data Modeling Branch, Na-
tional Cancer Institute).
All other statistical analyses were performed using SAS,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Comparative differences were
considered significant at P < .05.
Results
The data set that we used contained a total of 64 971 patients,
including 7294, 10 631, and 64 971 in SEER 9, 13, and 18 regis-
tries, respectively. Of these patients, 34 233 (52.7%) were
women. The annual number of NET cases and the numbers at
risk are detailed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Of 45 318 NETs
with a known grade, 23 126 were G1, 7416 were G2, and 14 766
were G3 and G4. Of 53 465 NETs with a known stage, 28 031
were localized, 10 777 were regional, and 14 657 were distant
at the time of diagnosis.
Annual Incidence
The annual age-adjusted incidence of NETs was 1.09 per
100 000 persons in 1973 and increased to 6.98 per 100 000
persons by 2012 as shown in Figure 1A (and contrasted with
annual age-adjusted incidence of all malignant neoplasms).
Age-specific incidence rates were calculated for 3 age groups:
younger than 50 years, 50 to 64 years, and 65 years or older.
The most dramatic rise in incidence was noted in patients 65
years or older with a more than 8-fold rise to 25.3 per 100 000
persons and, in those 50 to 64 years, to 14.3 per 100 000 per-
sons; those younger than 50 years had a more modest 3-fold
rise to 1.75 per 100 000 persons (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Theannualpercentagechangeforage-adjustedincidencefrom
2000to2012inSEER18was3.2per100 000persons(P < .001).
The increase in the incidence of NETs from 1973 to 2012
occurred across all sites, stages, and grades. The increases in
incidence for various sites ranged from 15-fold in the stom-
ach to 2-fold in the cecum (Figure 1B). Among stage groups,
the incidence increased the most in localized NETs, from 0.21
per100 000personsin1973to3.15per100 000personsin2012
(P < .001) (Figure 1C). Among grade groups, incidence in-
creased the most in G1 NETs, from 0.01 per 100 000 persons
in 1973 to 2.53 per 100 000 persons in 2012 (P < .001)
(Figure 1C). In SEER 18 (2000-2012), the highest incidences
were 1.49 per 100 000 persons in the lung, 3.56 per 100 000
persons in gastroenteropancreatic sites (including 1.05 per
100 000 persons in the small intestine, 1.04 per 100 000
persons in the rectum, and 0.48 per 100 000 persons in the
pancreas), and 0.84 per 100 000 persons in NETs with an
unknown primary site of origin.
Prevalence
Reflecting the rising incidence and indolent nature of NETs,
the 20-year limited-duration prevalence increased substan-
tially, from 0.006% in 1993 to 0.048% in 2012 (P < .001)
(Figure 2A). Ten-year limited-duration prevalence and
absolute counts for both time periods are detailed in eTable 2
in the Supplement. Among grade groups, prevalence in-
creased the most in G1 NETs and, among sites, prevalence was
highest in the rectum, followed by the lung and small intes-
tine (Figure 2). The projected prevalence of NETs in the US
population on January 1, 2014, matched by age, sex, and race,
was 171 321 per 100 000 persons.
Survival
The median OS time for all patients was 9.3 years (112 months).
Localized NETs had better median OS (>30 years) compared
with regional NETs (10.2 years) and distant NETs (12 months)
(P < .001). Of those with known grades, G1 NETs had the high-
est median OS (16.2 years) among grade groups, G2 NETs had
the worse OS (8.3 years), and G3 and G4 NETs had the worst
OS (10 months). NETs in the rectum (24.6 years) and appen-
dix (>30.0 years) had the best median OS among site groups,
while NETs in the pancreas (3.6 years) and lung (5.5 years) had
the worst median OS. All these differences in survival were sig-
nificant (log-rank P < .001).
We then evaluated survival patterns according to site and
stage (Figure 3). In localized NETs, median OS ranged from 14
years in the small intestine to more than 30 years in the ap-
pendix. In regional NETs, median OS ranged from 33 months
for NETs with an unknown primary to more than 30 years in
theappendix.FordistantNETs,thoseinthesmallintestinehad
the best median OS (5.83 years); NETs in the lung (6 months)
and colon (4 months) had the worst median OS. All of these
differences in OS were significant (log-rank P < .001).
Next, we evaluated OS according to site and grade.
Patients with G1 or G2 appendiceal NETs or G1 rectal NETs
had the longest median OS (>30 years). Irrespective of site,
patients with G3 and G4 NETs had poor OS, ranging from
30 to 33 months for the small intestine and appendix,
respectively, to 8 months for the cecum and colon (P < .001)
(Figure 3).
Finally, we evaluated the median, 3-year, and 5-year sur-
vival rates for well-differentiated to moderately differenti-
ateddistantstageNETsintheSEER18cohort(2000-2012)since
we believed that this information would be most helpful for
practicing clinicians (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

Multivariable Analysis of OS
We next performed multivariable analysis with hazard ratios
(HRs) calculated for 5-year mortality hazard rates (Table). We
found that patients with G2 NETs (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.59-1.94)
and G3 and G4 NETs (HR, 5.26; 95% CI, 4.85-5.71) had worse OS
than did those with G1 NETs. Race, age, stage, and site were all
found to have significant correlation with survival. Overall sur-
vival was worse in regional NETs (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.57-1.90)
and distant NETs (HR, 5.05; 95% CI, 4.64-5.50) than in local-
izedNETsafteradjustmentforothercovariates.NETsintheliver
had the worst OS (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.46-2.36) and NETs in the
stomach had the second-worst OS (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.34)
compared with NETs in the lung.

100 000 in 1973 to 6.98 per 100 000 in 2012, a 6.4-fold
increase. Survival of patients with NET has improved
over time, and this increase was especially pronounced
in distant gastrointestinal NETs and in distant pancreatic
NETs, reflecting improvements in therapies for those
sites.
Although prior studies done across the world have also
shown a rise in the incidence of NETs, this elevation has
been most marked in North American studies. Whether
these differences are due to underlying biologic factors,
environmental factors, health care patterns, and/or data
capture by registries is unknown.1-3 Although the increase in
incidence occurred across all sites and all stages during this
period, it was markedly greater for the localized stage, pos-
sibly due to an increased diagnosis of asymptomatic, early-
stage disease. This finding is supported by a Canadian
population-based study that showed that, despite the over-
all increase in the incidence of NETs, the proportion of
patients with metastatic disease has remained constant over
time.3 In the present study, we provide extensive details
regarding the trends at each site during a much longer time
period and show that the rise in incidence was greatest in
the stomach (15-fold) and rectum (9-fold). The trends at
these sites may be associated with the increased use of
endoscopic procedures. The steady rise in the incidence of
NETs at other common sites, including the lung and small
intestine, is probably related to increased use of imaging
procedures in clinical practice. Similarly, the steep rise in G1
NETs is possibly related to increased recognition and wide-
spread adoption of the formalization of the nomenclature,
grading, and staging of these tumors.11 To highlight the bur-
den of NETs, we evaluated the rising prevalence in the form
of 20-year and 10-year limited-duration prevalence rates.
Since these prevalence rates include patients irrespective of
whether they are under treatment or considered cured, they
are a composite of the incidence and survival rates. The
age-, sex-, and race-adjusted 20-year limited duration
prevalence for the US population for January 1, 2014, was
estimated to be 171 321, which is significantly higher than
the previously reported prevalence of 103 312 in 2004.1
Survival analyses using SEER 18 confirmed prior find-
ings of the prognostic significance of age, sex, histologic
grade, primary site, and stage at diagnosis.1,2 Most cases
that were coded as liver likely represented metastatic dis-
ease from other primary sites, thus making for a very
heterogeneous group but with poor outcomes overall. The
improvements in survival for the entire cohort over time
were likely driven largely by factors pertaining to nonmeta-
static disease and may be due in part to the changes in the
incidence discussed above, including a higher proportion of
relatively more indolent NETs, such as gastric and rectal
carcinoids, being discovered that would have otherwise
gone undetected. Stage migration (also known as the “Will
Rogers phenomenon”) also may have occurred affecting
survival owing to improvements in general radiology tech-
niques, such as more sensitive computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging. Improvements in the manage-
ment of NETs, including development of octreoscans in the
late 1980s, and the adoption of standardized staging and
pathology guidelines may also have contributed.19

To evaluate the effect of the evolution of systemic thera-
pies on survival, we evaluated OS trends of distant-stage NETs
in the SEER 18 registry grouping, with subgroup analyses in
distant gastrointestinal NETs and distant pancreatic NETs. We
found improvements in OS in all distant NETs in SEER 18 over
time, with pronounced improvements in OS in distant gastro-
intestinal NETs and distant pancreatic NETs. It is likely that
these trends are an underestimation of the true impact of
recent advances in systemic therapies for these subtypes,
given the data’
s inability to account for more recent drug
approvals.15,20-22 Furthermore, these favorable trends in the
survival of patients with metastatic NETs will likely continue
as data on newer agents, such as peptide receptor radionu-
clide therapy, become integrated into routine clinical care.23
A large volume of retrospective data from Europe supports the
efficacy of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in well-
differentiated NETs that show adequate expression of soma-
tostatin receptors as demonstrated by activity on somatosta-
tin receptor scintigraphy.24 The recently completed phase 3
Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy-1 trial, although limited to
small-bowel NETs, provides the first randomized data and
firmly establishes the activity of this modality.23 It is likely that
peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and other peptide ra-
dionuclide conjugate therapies targeted toward somatosta-
tin receptors currently in development will have a significant
effect on the natural history of NETs arising at sites other than
the small bowel.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, given that NETs may
not have been reported to cancer registries unless considered
malignant, it is likely that we have underestimated their true
incidence and prevalence. Second, several known prognostic
indicators are not captured by the SEER database. In addi-
tion, the database does not provide information regarding the
functional status of the NETs that may also affect treatment

decisions and survival. Finally, treatment factors, such as
quality of surgery, time to diagnosis, and systemic therapy,
were unavailable and may have confounded the results. Such
drawbacks are inherent to any retrospective, population-
based study and may raise concerns about the generalizabil-
ityofthefindings.However,thesizeofthepresentstudy,which
we believe to be the largest to date, and the long duration of
follow up compensate to a great extent and provide a compre-
hensive epidemiologic picture of NETs.
Conclusions
The incidence and prevalence of NETs have continued to rise
in the United States, owing to the increased diagnosis of early-
stage disease and possibly stage migration. The survival of pa-
tientswithNETshasimproved,andthisimprovementhasbeen
greater for those with distant gastrointestinal NETs and, in par-
ticular, distant pancreatic NETs.
