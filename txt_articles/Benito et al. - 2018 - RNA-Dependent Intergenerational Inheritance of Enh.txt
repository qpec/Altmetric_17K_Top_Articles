In Brief
Environmental enrichment (EE), a
combination of physical and mental
exercise, has been shown to increase
cognitive abilities in mice and in humans.
Benito et al. find that offspring of male
mice subjected to EE also show this
increase. This effect is dependent
on sperm RNA and involves
microRNA212/132.

SUMMARY
Physical exercise in combination with cognitive
training is known to enhance synaptic plasticity,
learning, and memory and lower the risk for various
complex diseases including Alzheimer’s disease.
Here, we show that exposure of adult male mice to
an environmental enrichment paradigm leads to
enhancement of synaptic plasticity and cognition
also in the next generation. We show that this effect
is mediated through sperm RNA and especially
miRs 212/132. In conclusion, our study reports inter-
generational inheritance of an acquired cognitive
benefit and points to specific miRs as candidates
mechanistically involved in this type of transmission.
INTRODUCTION
There is emerging evidence that exposure to environmental
stimuli can initiate processes that transmit information to the
next generation via non-genetic mechanisms (Bale, 2015; Boha-
cek and Mansuy, 2015; Fischer, 2014). Such forms of inter- or
transgenerational inheritance have been described for aversive
stimuli, such as chronic or early life stress that lead to altered
response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increased
anxiety and depressive-like behavior in the following generations
(Gapp et al., 2014, 2016; Franklin et al., 2010; Rodgers et al.,
2013). There is also evidence that exposure of individuals to
detrimental environmental stimuli can lead to cellular adapta-
tions that protect the offspring when they are exposed to the
same environmental insult (Zeybel et al., 2012). The idea that
environmental factors can affect germ cells and thereby alter
biological processes in the offspring is fascinating and may
play an important role in the pathogenesis of complex diseases,
especially in neuropsychiatric disorders (Bale et al., 2010; Klen-
gel et al., 2016).
An environmental factor that was shown to lower the risk for
various complex diseases, including those affecting the brain,
is the combination of physical exercise and cognitive training,
also called environmental enrichment (EE). EE is known to
enhance synaptic plasticity in rodents and humans and is thus
considered a suitable strategy to reduce the risk for dementia
and other cognitive diseases (Nithianantharajah and Hannan,
2006; Fischer et al., 2007; Brown et al., 2013; Fischer, 2016).
Importantly, there is evidence that exposure of juvenile mice to
EE can enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity in their
offspring (Arai et al., 2009). Whether EE training in adulthood
might also affect synaptic function of the next generation has
not been tested so far, and the underlying mechanisms of trans-
generational transmission are still poorly understood. There is,
however, evidence that RNA in gametes could play a role
(Gapp et al., 2014; Bale, 2015; Bohacek and Mansuy, 2015).
In this study, we demonstrate that exposure of adult mice to
EE significantly enhances hippocampal LTP and cognitive func-
tion in their offspring. We show that this phenotype is due to
changes in the RNA composition in the sperm of the correspond-
ing fathers and identify microRNAs (miR) 212/132 as one factor
involved in process.
RESULTS
EE Training Increases Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity
in an Intergenerational Manner
First, we wanted to confirm that our EE protocol enhances hip-
pocampal LTP in adult mice. To this end, we subjected mice to
10 weeks of EE training before measuring hippocampal LTP at
the Schaffer Collateral CA1 synapse. We observed a highly sig-
nificant increase in LTP in EE mice compared to home-caged
(HC) controls (Figure 1A). Next, we wanted to test whether EE
training in adult male mice would affect synaptic plasticity in their
offspring (F1 generation), which are not subjected to EE. To
this end, adult male mice underwent 10 weeks of EE training
and were then mated to HC females (Figure 1B). We measured

 hippocampal LTP when the offspring were adult (3 months of
age). Notably, offspring of EE fathers had increased LTP
compared to those born to fathers that were housed in HC (con-
trols; Figure 1C). The effect was similar in both male and female
offspring (Figure S1). In order to account for possible confound-
ing factors, we performed a linear regression model including the
effect of paternal treatment (HC versus EE), sex (male versus
female), and paternal treatment X sex interaction. In line with
our previous analysis, we observed a highly significant effect of
paternal treatment (p < 0.0001). We then tested whether this
phenotype is passed on to the grandoffspring of the original EE
animals, representing the F2 generation. Here, we did not
observe any difference in the LTP between the groups (Fig-
ure 1D). These data indicate that EE in male mice leads to
enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity in offspring, but that
this effect represents inter- (and not trans-) generational
inheritance.
Intergenerational Enhancement of LTP Is Mediated via
Sperm RNA
Since the mothers were never exposed to EE, which might have
affected
maternal
care,
the
enhanced
synaptic
plasticity
observed in the offspring of fathers that underwent EE training
must be associated with changes in the father’s gametes. Previ-
ous reports linked sperm RNA to transgenerational inheritance

and observed, for example, that individual
miRs were altered in sperm of mice that
passed an acquired anxiety phenotype
to the next generation (Gapp et al.,
2014). Apart from this, there is additional
evidence that manipulating miRs levels
in
gametes can alter the offspring’s
phenotype (Rassoulzadegan et al., 2006;
Rodgers et al., 2015). At the same time,
miRs are known to play key roles in pro-
moting synaptic plasticity (Fischer, 2014;
Schratt, 2009). We therefore hypothe-
sized that miRs might play a role in
the intergenerational transmission of EE-
induced LTP enhancement. First, we
measured the sperm microRNAome detectable in mice used in
our experimental system. Out of 1,886 miRs present in
the mouse genome, 219 were identified in sperm (Figures 2A
and 2B). We subjected these 219 miRs detected in sperm to a
PubMed search according to the following criteria: (1) expres-
sion in the brain, (2) having been linked to brain plasticity and
memory function, and (3) having a documented role in brain
development since this might be a possible route of action by
which miRs present in gametes could affect brain function in
the offspring (Figure 2B). Using these criteria, we identified 6
miRs that showed more than 1 PubMed hit, namely, miR212/
132, let-7d, let-7c, let-7b, miR34c, and miR124. MiR212/132
was the top hit according to our search criteria (Figures 2B
and 2C). These miRs are co-expressed from the same locus,
have been shown to affect synaptic function and learning
behavior in mice, and play a role in brain development (Clovis
et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2016; Hernandez-Rapp et al., 2015;
Remenyi et al., 2013; Tognini and Pizzorusso, 2012). Therefore,
we assayed the expression of the miR212/132 cluster in mice
upon EE training. We found that miR132 and miR212 were
upregulated both in sperm and hippocampus of mice that
were exposed to EE for 10 weeks (Figures 3A and 3B). Of
note, a shorter duration of EE (2 weeks) was not sufficient to
induce the upregulation of these miRNAs in sperm (Figure S2A),
while increased levels were observed in the hippocampus

 (Figure S2B). Furthermore, none of the other miRs we had iden-
tified as candidates for the observed intergenerational pheno-
types (let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, miR34c, and miR124; see Figure 2),
nor randomly selected miRs exhibited altered expression after
10 weeks of EE (Figures S2C and S2D). These data argue against
a general increase of sperm miRs in response to EE and led us to
hypothesize that miR212/132 might play a role in the intergener-
ational transmission of the EE phenotype. To test this possibility,
we first injected RNA from sperm of HC or EE mice into fertilized
oocytes and examined LTP in the corresponding offspring once
they were adult. RNA in both groups was co-injected with scram-
bled RNA allowing us to include a third group in which we
injected into oocytes sperm RNA from EE mice along with
miR212/132 inhibitor, which we had previously validated for its
inhibitory action (Figure S3).
We observed that the offspring born to oocytes injected with
RNA from 10-week EE mice exhibited enhanced LTP, which
was reversed to control (HC) levels if miR212/132 inhibitors
were co-administered (Figures 3C and 3D). These data demon-
strate that EE in adult males enhances hippocampal synaptic
plasticity in their offspring and that this effect is mediated
through sperm RNA causally involving miR212/132.
Next, we wondered whether this enhancement of LTP was
accompanied by an improvement in cognitive performance.
We therefore subjected the offspring of EE fathers and those of
HC controls to behavioral testing (Figure 4A). We observed no
difference in explorative behavior and basal anxiety among
groups (Figure S4). Next, mice were subjected to two hippocam-
pus-dependent behavioral tests, namely, the contextual fear-
conditioning (FC) and Morris water maze (MWM) paradigms.
To avoid ceiling effects on learning, mice were trained using
rather mild protocols. Thus, the electric footshock applied during
FC was 0.5 mA, an intensity that allows the detection of memory
improvement. Of note, there was no difference between the
groups in pain sensation as measured by their reaction to the
footshock (Figure S4E). In the MWM, mice were trained for a
maximum of 5 days, a protocol that in our hands results in a mod-
erate memory consolidation of the platform location in wild-type
(WT) animals, which normally form robust spatial memory only
after 8 training days (Figure S5).
First, we tested mice in the contextual FC. We observed that
mice born to EE fathers showed elevated freezing behavior
when compared to mice born to HC fathers (Figures S6A and
S6B, t test, p < 0.05 for HC:HC versus EE:HC group). Similar re-
sults were observed in the water maze paradigm for platform
crossings and relative time of platform occupancy (Figures
S6C and S6D, t test p < 0.05, HC:HC versus EE:HC group). We
also employed a more stringent approach using a linear-mixed
model for statistical analysis taking into account the effect of
the different litters, since for the behavioral experiments we em-
ployed more than one mouse/litter. In this analysis, we observed
a non-significant trend for memory enhancement in the offspring
of EE fathers in the FC and water maze paradigms (percentage
of time freezing: t = 1.45, df = 10, p = 0.17; platform crossings:
t = 1.79, df = 10, p = 0.1; relative time of platform occupancy:
t = 1.99, df = 10, p = 0.07). In sum, these data suggest that the
intergenerational effect of EE on memory function is subtler
compared to the LTP phenotype. This may in part be due to
the fact that the analysis of LTP in hippocampal slice preparation
allows for a well-defined and specific readout, while the analysis
of an animal’s complex behavior as an estimate of memory func-
tion, on the other hand, offers a rather limited dynamic range.
Rather than relying on the classical readout of the FC and water
maze paradigms, we therefore decided to also calculate an inte-
grated cognitive score based on a principal component analysis
(PCA). The parameters included in the integrated cognitive score
were (1) relative time of platform occupancy in MWM, (2) number
of platform crossings in MWM and (3) percentage of time
freezing in FC. The first component of the PCA analysis captures
the most variance, and hence we took the scores from the PC1
(principal component 1) as a ‘‘cognitive score’’ that would reflect
the overall change in cognitive function. This score revealed a

 significant difference between animals born to HC and EE fa-
thers (Figures 4B and 4C linear mixed model t-value = 2.80,
df = 10, p = 0.018), confirming that there is indeed intergenera-
tional inheritance of a mild, but significant cognitive advantage
after EE exposure in the fathers.
Next, we decided to address the question of whether sperm
RNA and in particular miR212/132 would play a role in the mem-
ory enhancement seen in the offspring born to EE fathers. As
described for the LTP experiments (see Figure 3). we isolated
RNA from the sperm of EE mice and injected this RNA into fertil-
ized oocytes with scrambled RNA. Oocytes injected with RNA
from sperm of HC mice together with scrambled RNA were
used as control. Also, here, we included a group where EE sperm
RNA was co-injected with miR212/132 inhibitors (Figure 4D).
The born mice were subjected to behavioral testing when they
were adult. In accordance with our previous observations on LTP
enhancement, the mice that originated from oocytes injected
with EE sperm RNA showed improved memory function in the
FC (Figures S6E and S6F, p = 0.04, t test) and water maze
paradigms
(Figures
S6G
and
S6H,
platform
crossings:
p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney test; relative time of platform occu-
pancy: p = 0.04, t test.) when compared to those that originated
from oocytes injected with HC sperm RNA. This observation was
further corroborated when we analyzed the cognitive score as
described above (Figures 4E and 4F), suggesting that similar
to the intergenerational inheritance of cognitive enhancement
mediated by EE, injection of EE sperm RNA into fertilized
oocytes also results in a cognitive benefit. In contrast to its effect
on LTP, the miR212/132 cluster appeared to have no effect
on the behavioral readout. Mice that were born from oocytes
injected with EE sperm RNA and co-injected with miR212/132
inhibitors exhibited a similar, albeit insignificant, trend for
memory enhancement (Figures 4E and S6F–S6H; percentage
time freezing: p = 0.28, Mann-Whitney test; platform crossings:
p = 0.19, Mann-Whitney test; relative time of platform occu-
pancy: p = 0.08, t test). These findings suggest that the intergen-
erational effect of EE on LTP and memory enhancement critically
depends on sperm RNA and that the LTP effect is mediated via
altered levels of miR212/132. In contrast, miR212/132 levels
cannot explain the enhanced memory function indicating that
additional mechanisms contribute to the intergenerational
enhancement of learning behavior in response to EE. Finally,
miR212/132 are not upregulated in the offspring of EE fathers
(Figure S8), which suggests that the mechanisms underlying
EE-mediated enhanced synaptic plasticity and cognition in the
F0 and F1 generation are likely to be different. This interpretation
could also explain why the effect of EE in our study is inter- and
not transgenerational.
DISCUSSION
Our data demonstrate that EE during adulthood mediates the
enhancement of hippocampal LTP in the adult offspring. This is
not only the first confirmation, but also an important extension
to the original observation by Arai et al. (2009), who showed
that EE in juvenile mice (2 weeks of age) enhances LTP in their
offspring. Our observation that this phenomenon occurs even
when EE is initiated at a time point at which brain development
is complete has important implications, suggesting that exercise
before conception could provide a brain plasticity benefit to the

 offspring. Interestingly, Arai et al. observed that EE-mediated
intergenerational enhancement of LTP is transmitted through
the mothers but not the fathers. This can be explained by the
fact that the authors subjected mice to EE before sexual maturity
(i.e., at 14 days of age) for 2 weeks, when female gametes are
already present. In contrast sperm production begins only at
sexual maturity when mice are 6–8 weeks of age. These facts
can plausibly explain why 2 weeks of EE in males starting at
the age of 14 days failed to elicit intergenerational transmission.
Thus, in our study EE was initiated when mice were 10 weeks of
age and thus sexually mature. Moreover, we provide evidence
that, in addition to enhanced LTP, offspring of EE fathers exhibit
a mild but significant cognitive advantage when compared to
offspring of HC fathers. When compared to the LTP effect, the
memory enhancement was, however, moderate. One explana-
tion could be that the analysis of Schaffer collateral CA1 LTP in
hippocampal slice preparation is much more sensitive and thus
better suited to detect increased or decreased plasticity
compared to behavioral assays that offer a limited dynamic
range for the detection of changes. In line with this, calculation
of a combined cognitive score on the basis of two hippocampal
memory tests using PCA showed that offspring born to EE fa-
thers or from oocytes treated with RNA isolated from sperm of
EE mice exhibit a significant cognitive benefit. It also has to be
considered that in our study we analyzed memory function in
healthy WT mice. It will thus be interesting to see whether EE
training in fathers would provide a benefit in synaptic plasticity
and memory function to offspring in a situation when brain plas-
ticity is challenged as it is for example the case during aging or in
neurodegenerative conditions. In support of this view, recent
findings show that EE partially ameliorates the detrimental trans-
generational effects observed in offspring born to parents that
were exposed to stressful experiences (Gapp et al., 2016). Simi-
larly, it will be interesting to see whether increased brain plas-
ticity is observed in offspring when the mother undergoes EE
training. In this study, we did not address this issue and rather
focused on EE fathers since studying the corresponding gam-
etes for subsequent mechanistic analysis is more suited for an
initial study. It is, moreover, important to notice that the male
mice used for mating were removed from the cage upon concep-
tion and thus never came to contact with the offspring. It is thus
highly unlikely that the described phenotypes in offspring are due
to differences in maternal care. Further support for this view
stems from the observation that mice born from fertilized oo-
cytes that were injected with sperm RNA of EE mice recapitulate
the phenotype observed in the offspring of EE fathers. Moreover,
offspring born to enriched parents and raised by a HC housed
dam also display enhanced memory formation (Figure S7). It
will be important for future research to test whether EE training
of adult female mice will also transmit a synaptic plasticity and
cognitive benefit to offspring and to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms. Especially interesting will be to see whether EE in-
duces upregulation of miR212/132 in oocytes and whether this
or other processes play a role in the intergenerational transmis-
sion of EE-mediated enhanced synaptic plasticity and cognition.
Such experiments have to take into account a number of addi-
tional issues such as the fact that most protocols to collect oo-
cytes include a superovulation regime that could potentially
confound oocyte plasticity such as miR expression.
Our data show that the intergenerational inheritance of an EE-
induced phenotype involves changes in sperm RNA. This finding
is in line with previous studies that investigated transgenerational
effects in mutant mice (Rassoulzadegan et al., 2006), in mice
exposed to specific stressors leading to altered glucocorticoid

 signaling (Rodgers et al., 2013; Rodgers et al., 2015), anxiety
behavior (Gapp et al., 2014), or diet-induced obesity (Grandjean
et al., 2015). An important difference to most of these studies is
that we observe an inter- but not a transgenerational effect; i.e.,
an EE-induced brain plasticity benefit was detectable in the F1
but not in the F2 generation. From an evolutionary point of
view, our finding could make sense, since nature offers to the or-
ganism a physiological system that allows for non-genetic inher-
itance of a cognitive benefit in situations of demand but makes
sure that these phenotypes do not persist when the environ-
mental settings change again. Taking into account that ‘‘too
much’’ plasticity and the resulting aberrant neuronal activity
have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Fischer et al.,
2005; Mesulam, 1999; Palop et al., 2006), it appears logical
that EE-mediated LTP enhancement is restricted only to the
next generation. Moreover, the EE-mediated intergenerational
changes in brain function appear to be regulated at multiple
levels. Our data clearly show that one of these mechanisms is
related to sperm RNA. In this context, it is interesting to note
that the EE-mediated intergenerational inheritance of LTP
enhancement was linked to the action of miR212/132. These
data are also in line with an earlier study demonstrating that
oocyte injection of a mixture of eight miRs could recapitulate
the transgenerational effects observed in response to chronic
paternal stress (Rodgers et al., 2015). However, inhibition of
miR212/132 in fertilized oocytes injected with sperm RNA from
EE mice did not occlude the inheritance of improved memory
function assayed in the behavioral paradigms. These data clearly
indicate that there must be additional miRs and other RNA-
dependent mechanisms of similar importance. Moreover, we
cannot
exclude
that
non-RNA
mediated
processes
also
contribute to this phenotype. In fact, altered DNA methylation

ical variants (Siklenka et al., 2015; Zeybel et al., 2012) have
been implicated in intergenerational inheritance. These findings
also suggest that the intergenerational effects of EE-mediated
LTP improvement can be dissociated from the improvement of
learning behavior at the molecular level, which is in line with
the view that, although LTP has been considered a molecular
correlate of memory function, it cannot fully explain all aspects
of memory consolidation (Titley et al., 2017).
An experiment that could have provided additional evidence
for the involvement of miR212/132 in the intergenerational trans-
mission of enhanced LTP would be to inject these miRNAs
specifically into fertilized oocytes and perform the tests on the
resulting progeny. However, we decided against this ‘‘gain-of-
function approach.’’ Convincing data show that downregulation
of miR212/132 leads to impairment of synaptic plasticity and
learning and memory (Hansen et al., 2010, 2013; Scott et al.,
2012). However, while memory enhancement was observed if
miR132 overexpression is 1.5- to 2-fold (Hansen et al., 2013),
which is similar to the increase seen in our study in response
to EE, transgenic mice overexpressing miR132 more than
3-fold exhibit learning impairment (Hansen et al., 2010, 2013;
Scott et al., 2012). Importantly, the learning impairment caused
by supra-physiological upregulation of miR132 in these trans-
genic mice could be turned into learning enhancement by miti-
gating miR132 overexpression to a level representing a 1.5- to
2-fold increase (Hansen et al., 2013). These data suggest that
moderate increase in miR212/132 facilitates, whereas excess in-
crease in its expression impairs learning and memory, a finding
that is not uncommon for molecules implicated with memory
function (Fischer et al., 2005). Thus, we suggest that in case of
miR212/132 our ‘‘loss-of-function’’ experiment is the most reli-
able experimental approach to support a role of miR212/132 in
intergenerational inheritance.
The precise mechanisms by which sperm RNA transmit EE-
induced intergenerational enhancement of brain function to
adult offspring remain to be identified. One possibility is that
sperm miRs alter gene expression during embryonic develop-
ment thereby causing subtle changes in brain plasticity. This
hypothesis appears worthwhile to be addressed in future
studies, since even small changes in brain development can
affect synaptic function in the adult organism and are believed
to
contribute,
for
example,
to
neuropsychiatric
diseases
(Faa et al., 2016; Mahmoudi and Cairns, 2017). Of note,
miR212/132 play a role in neurodevelopment as well as the
adult brain and have been linked to neurodevelopmental brain
diseases such as schizophrenia (Clovis et al., 2012; Miller
et al., 2012). These data may also help to understand why
EE-induced transmission of LTP enhancement is only observed
in the F1 but not in the F2 generation. We speculate that the
mechanisms underlying enhanced brain plasticity in the parents
and the offspring are different. In the case of the offspring,
these mechanisms may be linked to neurodevelopmental pro-
cesses, a hypothesis to be tested in future studies. In support
of this view, we observed that hippocampal levels of miR212/
132 increase in fathers exposed to EE (F0 generation; see Fig-
ure 3), a finding that is in line with previous data linking moder-
ately increased miR212/132 levels to memory enhancement
(Hansen et al., 2016; Hernandez-Rapp et al., 2015; Scott
et al., 2012), but not in their adult offspring (F1 generation;
see Figure S8). An equally interesting question relates to the
mechanisms that lead to increased miR212/132 levels in
sperm. Changes in DNA-methylation or histone-modifications
during spermatogenesis are likely mechanisms (Gapp et al.,
2014; Zeybel et al., 2012). However, other mechanisms should
also be considered. For example, our data show that miR212/
132 are already increased after 2 weeks of EE in the hippocam-
pus, but only after 10 weeks of EE in sperm. These data could
indicate that expression of miR212/132 in the brain is more
responsive to external stimuli than that in sperm. Alternatively,
there is evidence that brain-derived exosomes, which are
known to carry also miRs, have been detected in the circulation
(Shi et al., 2014), and thus it is not entirely impossible that
increased
levels of miR212/132 in sperm
originate
from
increased miR212/132 expression in other tissues such as
the brain. Clearly, more research is required to address these
questions.
In conclusion, the idea that EE training in adulthood provides a
cognitive benefit not only to the individual undergoing this
procedure, but also to its offspring is fascinating. Whether these
findings are translatable to humans needs to be determined.
Nevertheless, the accumulating evidence that sperm RNA
content encodes information about environmentally induced

 phenotypic traits is an issue that not only needs to be considered
in reproductive medicine, but may also offer the chance to
discover biomarkers for complex diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Lower
Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety. WT C57B/6J
animals were ordered from Janvier labs at 9 weeks of age and were allowed
to habituate to the animal facility and the group for 1 week. Afterward, they
were housed either in standard HC or under EE conditions as described below.
Food and water were provided ad libitum. Animals were kept on a 12-hr/12-hr-
light/dark cycle. For all experiments, including mating, adult mice were used,
which refers to an age of 3–4 months.
EE
For EE, mice were kept in groups of 4–5 in large cages and provided with toys
(in the form of tunnels, housing, and differently shaped objects, 8 per cage) and
running wheels (2 per cage). 2 toys were replaced daily with novel ones, and
the rest was rearranged inside the cage. Cages were changed weekly alto-
gether. Mice were put in the EE at 10 weeks of age and kept there for 10 weeks.
HC animals were also kept in groups of 4–5 in large cages in the absence of
objects and running wheels but subjected to the same cleaning schedule.
Luciferase Assay
For luciferase assays, the complementary seed sequence for miR-212/132
was cloned into pmirGLO (Promega) into PmeI/XbaI sites by oligo hybridiza-
tion (see below). The constructs were cotransfected into HEK293 cells with
miR-212/132 mimics (5 nM, QIAGEN) or miR-212/132 inhibitors (5 nM for 3p
arms, 50 nM for 5p arms, Exiqon) using lipofectamine according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase measurements were taken 48 hr in a
Tecan plate reader using Promega’s Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
following manufacturer’s instructions. The Firefly/Renilla ratio was calculated
and then normalized to control conditions.

Sperm Collection and RNA Isolation
Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Sperm was isolated by dis-
secting the epididymis and running a needle through the tube to allow sperm
to swim out into 1 mL of pre-warmed PBS. Epidydimal tissue was kept at 37�C
for 20 min, and the supernatant was then collected and centrifuged at
8,000 3 g for 5 min at 4�C. In order to remove contaminating epithelial cells
prior to RNA isolation, the pellet was treated with hypotonic buffer (0.1%
SDS, 0.5% Triton-X) for 30 min on ice to ensure that endothelial cells from
the surrounding tissue were disrupted. The solution was centrifuged once
more at 8,000 3 g for 10 min at 4�C to obtain the final sample. RNA was
isolated using Tri-Reagent from Sigma-Aldrich according to manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA was treated with DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
further purified using phenol:chloroform to remove all DNase I components.
RNA concentration was determined with the Nanodrop and quality with the
Bioanalizer.
qRT-PCR
cDNA synthesis was done using QIAGEN’s miScript II Reverse Transcription
kit II according to manufacturer’s instructions starting from 250 ng of
DNase-I-treated RNA. qRT-PCR was performed using QIAGEN’s commer-
cially available miScript Primer Assays (i.e., forward primers) specific for
each miRNA combined with miScript Universal Primer and miScript SYBR
Green Master Mix. miRNA levels were normalized to RNU6B. 2–5 ng of
cDNA was used per reaction. Assays were run in duplicate. For miR212/132,
the qRT-PCR was performed for both active and inactive arms. For all other
miRNAs, only active arms were analyzed. The DDCt method was used to
calculate relative expression.
RNA Injections into Fertilized Oocytes
Sperm RNA from 4 HC and 4 EE animals was isolated as described above.
RNAs were pooled and set at 0.5 ng/mL in 250 mL 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM
(pH 7.4) based on a previous publication reporting significant effects at
this concentration (Gapp et al., 2014). 3- to 4-week-old C57BL/6JRj females
were super-ovulated with pregnant male serum gonadotropin (7.5 U, Intervet)
and human chorionic gonadotropin (7.5 U, Intervet) and mated with C57BL/
6JRj males. Donor females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on the day
of plug, and fertilized eggs were collected. RNA was injected into the cyto-
plasm of zygotes at the pronuclear stage using an Eppendorf Femtojet and
Femtotip II capillaries with constant flow under visual control on an inverted
microscope using a 403 air objective and differential interference contrast
(DIC) optics. Injected zygotes were transferred into the oviduct of pseudo-
pregnant NMRI fosters bilaterally. The offspring generated from these injec-
tions was allowed to grow in a standard cage until 3 month of age before
behavioral testing.
Behavioral Experiments
Animals that went into behavioral experiments were sexually naive and were sin-
gle-caged 1 week prior to the start of the procedures. For contextual FC, animals
were put in a FC box (Med Associates) for 3 min, after which they received a 2-s,
0.5-mA footshock. They were left in the box for 10 s and then removed and put
back into their original cage. 24 hr later, animals were reintroduced into the con-
ditioning box, and freezing behavior was recorded for the 3-min period. Freezing
was considered when animals remained immobile (except for respiratory move-
ments) for at least 2 s. Note that this FC paradigm represents a rather mild
training therefore allowing the detection of memory enhancement, which is in
line with HC mice showing relatively low freezing levels. For MWM, animals
were trained in a round pool filled with opaque water where the escape platform
was placed approximately 1 cm below water level. They were trained in 4
consecutive 1-min trials per day with randomized entry points. If the animals
did not reach the platform within 1 min, they were gently guided to it. Animals
were allowed to stay on the platform for 15 s after each trial. The time needed
to reach the platform (escape latency) was automatically recorded via a top-
installed camera (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) and registered with
the TSE Systems software VideoMot. For the probe test, the platform was
removed and animals were introduced in the position opposite of the original
platform location and left to navigate the pool for 1 min. The percentage of
time spent in the specific region where the platform used to be during training
(time of platform occupancy) was recorded with the TSE Systems software.
The experimenters were blind to the animals’ experimental condition.
Breeding Scheme for Intergenerational Analysis
10-week-old male mice acquired from Janvier were subjected to 10 weeks of EE
according to the protocol described above. HC and EE male mice were bred
with females that had remained HC throughout this time. After mating, the fa-
thers were immediately removed from the cage so that they did not have any
contact with their offspring and did not impact upon their rearing. Offspring
that originated from these pairings were housed in standard HCs and subjected
to LTP measurements or behavioral experiments at 3–4 months of age.

 LTP Recordings
Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 3- to 4-month-old mice. Animals
were anesthetized with isoflourane and decapitated. Brain was removed from
the skull and hippocampus was dissected. Transversal hippocampal slices
(400 mm thick) were obtained using a tissue chopper (Stoelting). Slices were
collected in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (124 mM NaCl,
4.9 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 2.0 mM MgSO4, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 24.6 mM
NaHCO3, 10.0 mM D-glucose; saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 [pH 7.4]
and 305 mOsm). Slices were incubated in an interface chamber at 32C and
high oxygen tension was maintained by bubbling with 95% O2 and 5% CO2
(30 L/hr). Slices were allowed to recover for 3 hr after preparation. Then monop-
olar platinum-iridium electrodes (13303, MicroProbes) used for both recording
and stimulating were positioned in the CA1 region. The field excitatory postsyn-
aptic potential (fEPSP) slope was recorded with a Model 1700 differential AC
amplifier (A-M Systems) and Power 1401 analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge
Electronic Design), and monitored online with custom-made software, PWIN
(IFN Magdeburg). The test stimulation strength was determined for each input
as the current needed to elicit a field EPSP of 40% maximal slope. Baseline
recording began at least 3.30 hr after slice preparation, using test stimuli consist-
ing of four biphasic constant current pulses (0.2 Hz, 0.1 ms/polarity, averaged)
per time point, every 5 min for a minimum of 30 min. LTP was induced with a
strong tetanization protocol consisting of three stimulus trains (100 biphasic con-
stant-current pulses per train at 100 Hz and 0.2 ms/polarity, inter-train interval
10 min). Test stimuli were delivered 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 21, 25, and 30 min after the
first tetanization train and then every 5 min for up to 2 hr. The experimenters
were blind to the animals’ experimental condition.
Small RNA Sequencing
RNA isolated from two independent biological replicates of sperm from WT adult
mice was used for small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) library preparation using
Illumina’s TruSeq kit according to manufacturer’s instructions starting from
1 mg total RNA. Library quality was checked with the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). For
processing of sequencing data, a customized in-house software pipeline was
used. Quality check and demultiplexing were performed using the CASAVA
1.8.2 software (Illumina). We trimmed low-quality ends from reads before
adaptor removal having Phred quality score of less than 28 encoded in ASCII +
33. We then trimmed the 30 adapters and filtered out the reads with the minimum
length of 15 nucleotides using cutadapt. We first mapped the reads to a custom-
made reference genome created from miR and piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) se-
quences. Reads greater than 33 bp were mapped to the reference genome
created by other small non-coding RNA. Remaining unmapped reads were
then mapped to the mouse genome. We used bowtie (v.1.1.2) for mapping.
We allowed no mismatches for the first part of mapping and one mismatch for
rest of the mapping. Read count distribution and visualization were generated
using in-house Python script with Python version 2.7.10.
Statistical Analysis
Since several animals from the same litter were analyzed and tests were done at
two different time points (i.e., batches) to ensure that the group size was homo-
geneous and stayed within the same light/dark cycle, we used generalized
mixed models to account for such type of random effects. We used the R pack-
ages MASS (MASS_7.3-45) and nlme (lme4_1.1-12) to construct and evaluate
the generalized linear models. We first constructed a model with treatment
and sex as fixed factors and litter nested within batch as random factors. There
was no significance for sex main effect or for the interaction between sex and
treatment, so we dropped the sex effect for evaluating the main effect of treat-
ment. For the oocyte injection experiments, the sperm RNA comes from a
pool of 4 HC/EE mice and the manipulation happens at the level of each indi-
vidual embryo so we considered animals separately. Other analyses were
done with GraphPad Prism and corresponding statistical tests are mentioned
in the figure legends. All figures represent mean ± SEM. Exact n (mouse) and
N (litter) numbers are also specified in figures legends if applicable.
