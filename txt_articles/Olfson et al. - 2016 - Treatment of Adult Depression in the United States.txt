Treatment of Adult Depression in the United States
Mark Olfson, MD, MPH; Carlos Blanco, MD, PhD; Steven C. Marcus, PhD
IMPORTANCE Despite recent increased use of antidepressants in the United States, concerns
persist that many adults with depression do not receive treatment, whereas others receive
treatments that do not match their level of illness severity.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the treatment of adult depression in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of screen-positive depression, psychological
distress, and depression treatment data from 46 417 responses to the Medical Expenditure
Panel Surveys taken in US households by participants aged 18 years or older in 2012 and 2013.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Percentages of adults with screen-positive depression
(Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score of � 3) and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of the effects
of sociodemographic characteristics on odds of screen-positive depression; percentages with
treatment for screen-positive depression and AORs; percentages with any treatment of
depression and AORs stratified by presence of serious psychological distress (Kessler 6 scale
score of �13); and percentages with depression treatment by health care professional group
(psychiatrists, other health care professionals, and general medical providers); and type of
depression treatment (antidepressants, psychotherapy, and both) all stratified by distress
level.
RESULTS Approximately 8.4% (95% CI, 7.9-8.8) of adults screened positive for depression,
of which 28.7% received any depression treatment. Conversely, among all adults treated for
depression, 29.9% had screen-positive depression and 21.8% had serious psychological
distress. Adults with serious compared with less serious psychological distress who were
treated for depression were more likely to receive care from psychiatrists (33.4% vs 17.3%,
P < .001) or other mental health specialists (16.2% vs 9.6%, P < .001), and less likely to
receive depression care exclusively from general medical professionals (59.0% vs 74.4%,
P < .001). They were also more likely to receive psychotherapy (32.5% vs 20.6%, P < .001),
though not antidepressant medications (81.1% vs 88.6%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most US adults who screen positive for depression did not
receive treatment for depression, whereas most who were treated did not screen positive. In
light of these findings, it is important to strengthen efforts to align depression care with each
patient’
s clinical needs.

P
revious research indicates that many adults with
depression do not receive treatment for their
symptoms.1,2 According to national surveys from 2001
to 2003, approximately 1-half (49.5%) of adults with a life-
time medical history of major depressive disorder had never
received treatment for depression1 and a similar percentage
(48.4%) had not received any mental health care in the past
year.2 Over the past several years, however, there has been a
substantial increase in antidepressant prescriptions,3 which
have become the most commonly prescribed class of medica-
tions in the United States.4 In light of increased antidepres-
sant use, an updated characterization of the treatment of
adult depression would help to gauge current mental health
service needs and target initiatives to improve access to
depression care.
Screening for depression has recently received increased
attention. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
now recommends screening adults for depression and
adequate services for follow-up treatment that may be pro-
vided through a variety of different arrangements of clini-
cians and settings.5 The USPSTF recommendations, which
support the effectiveness of antidepressants, specific psy-
chotherapies, and their combination, highlight the need to
integrate behavioral health services within primary care. In
this context, it is important to assess national treatment pat-
terns of screen-positive depression across treatment modali-
ties and sectors of care.
Because patients with depression present in various set-
tings and with various levels of depression severity, match-
ing patients to appropriate treatments and health care pro-
fessionals is a widely endorsed clinical goal.6,7 A range of
interventions may be provided, from monitoring, psycho-
therapy or counseling, exercise,8 and yoga,9 to pharmaco-
logical treatment, and combination interventions.10
Because placebo-controlled trials indicate that antidepres-
sants are not more effective than placebo for mild depres-
sion,11.12 antidepressants are generally not recommended
for patients with mild or less severe depression.6,7 Stronger
evidence supports the benefit of antidepressants for
patients with severe depression11 and a combination of psy-
chotherapy and antidepressants is particularly effective for
patients with persistent depression and more severe
symptoms.13 Clinical trials14 and practice guidelines6 sup-
port referral of complex cases to psychiatrists and other
mental health specialists.
Little is known about the extent to which adults with de-
pression in the United States receive depression care and,
among those who receive treatment, the extent to which pa-
tients are matched based on their illness severity to appropri-
ate depression treatments and health care professionals. We
examined the prevalence and treatment of adults with screen-
positive depression among a nationally representative house-
hold sample of adults. Among all patients treated for depres-
sion, we further assessed whether serious psychological
distress was associated with more intensive treatment, includ-
ing antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, combined
treatment, and treatment from a psychiatrist or other spe-
cialty mental health professional.
Methods
Sources of Data
Data were analyzed from the household components of the
2012and2013MedicalExpenditurePanelSurveys(MEPS)con-
ducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ). Following AHRQ recommendations, the 2 annual
samples were concatenated to increase sample size.15 Tech-
nical information concerning the survey sampling design and
nonresponse adjustment is provided elsewhere.16-18 The MEPS
oversampledblacks,Hispanics,Asians,andpersonswithapre-
dicted low income. Analyses, which relied exclusively on de-
identified data, were exempted from human subjects review
by the institutional review board of the New York State
Psychiatric Institute.
Depression Symptoms and Treatment
The MEPS used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2),
a brief screen for depressed mood and anhedonia during the
past 2 weeks, to screen for depression. A PHQ-2 score of 3 or
more (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating
moreseveredepressivesymptoms)definedscreen-positivede-
pression. In primary care patients, a PHQ-2 score of 3 or more
has a sensitivity of 0.61 to 0.87 and specificity of 0.78 to 0.92
formajordepressivedisorderwhichreferstomoresevererather
than mild depression.19-21 In a validation study of 88 primary
care patients with a PHQ-2 score of 3 or more, 34 (38.6%) had
major depressive disorder, 32 (36.3%) had other less severe de-
pression, and 22 (25.0%) had neither type of depression.19
Detailed data were collected directly from households
using 3 interviews during each survey year. Treatment of de-
pression was defined by an outpatient visit or use of antide-
pressant, antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, or anxiolytic medi-
cations, or psychotherapy for depression (International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes 296.2, 296.3,
300.4, and 311) without regard to clinical effectiveness.
Patients treated for bipolar disorder were excluded from the
definition of depression treatment.
Respondents indicated whether each visit included psy-
chotherapy or mental health counseling. One or more psycho-
therapy or counseling visits defined use of psychotherapy.
Three groups were defined: any psychotherapy, any antide-
pressant treatment, and combination treatment. Informa-
tion was also collected concerning the health care profession-
als providing treatment at each visit. Respondents were
classified into those who received depression treatment from
(1) any psychiatrist, (2) any social worker or psychologist, and
(3) only general medical professionals (ie, health care profes-
sionals other than psychiatrists, psychologists, or social work-
ers). The 2 mental health specialty groups were not mutually
exclusive.
Psychological Distress
Psychological distress was assessed in the MEPS with the
Kessler 6 (K6) scale (scores range from 0- 24 with higher scores
indicating more severe distress), which queries the fre-
quency of mental health symptoms in the past 30 days.22 The

K6 has high internal consistency (α = 0.89) and strong re-
ceiver operator characteristics for disorders defined in the Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).23
At a cut score of 13, which defined serious psychological dis-
tress, the K6 has a classification accuracy of 0.92 for serious
mental illness defined as meeting criteria for at least one DSM
diagnosis and substantial impairment.24 In 1 study,25 the mean
(SD) K6 score of psychiatric outpatients with depression or
anxiety disorders was 13.1 (4.2).
Sociodemographic Characteristics
and Health Insurance
Respondents were classified by age group (18-34 years, 35-49
years, 50-64 years, and ≥65 years), sex, race/ethnicity (white,
non-Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; and Hispanic), and mari-
tal status (married; separated, divorced, or widowed; and not
married). They were also classified by highest level of educa-
tion (less than high school graduate, high school graduate but
not college graduate, and college graduate), family income by
percentage of the federal poverty level (<100%, 100%-200%,
201%-400%, and >400%), and by health insurance (any pri-
vatehealthinsurance,onlypublichealthinsurance,andnone).
Statistical Analyses
The percentages of adults with screen-positive depression and
with any depression treatment were each determined overall
and according to sociodemographic strata. A logistic regres-
sion model was fit to evaluate the effects of each sociodemo-
graphic variable level on odds of screening positive for depres-
sion controlling for each of the other sociodemographic
variables. A second model limited to adults with screen-
positive depression evaluated the effects of each sociodemo-
graphiccharacteristiconoddsofreceivinganydepressiontreat-
ment. A third model that included all adults evaluated the
effects of each sociodemographic characteristic on odds of re-
ceiving any depression treatment. The latter 2 models also
controlled for PHQ-2 score.
Among all adults treated for depression, the percentages
treated using each modality (antidepressants, psycho-
therapy, and antidepressants and psychotherapy) were calcu-
latedseparatelyforrespondentswithseriouspsychologicaldis-
tress and less serious or no psychological distress. Similar
analyses were performed for depression treatment by each of
the 3 health care professional groups. Results are presented
overall and separately for each sociodemographic stratum. A
corresponding series of logistic regression models within each
stratum produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for the asso-
ciation of serious distress (relative to less serious or no dis-
tress) with each depression treatment and professional group
controlling for the other sociodemographic variables. Sepa-
rate logistic models were used to calculate P values for the in-
teraction between levels of each sociodemographic variable
and seriousness of psychological distress to assess whether
these AORs differed across strata.

Results
Screen-Positive Depression
Approximately 8.4% of adults had screen-positive depres-
sion. Screen-positive depression was nearly 5 times more
prevalent among adults in the lowest (18.2%) than highest
(3.7%) income group. It was also common among adults who
were separated, divorced, or widowed; had public health
insurance; or had less than a high school education (Table 1).
Less than one-third (28.7%) of adults with screen-
positive depression received any depression treatment dur-
ing the survey year. After adjusting for other covariates, the
odds of receiving depression treatment among those with
screen-positive depression was increased by being aged 35 to
64 years; female; white, non-Hispanic; having at least com-
pleted high school; and having health insurance (Table 1). Ap-
proximately 78.5% of adults with screen-positive depression
and who received no depression treatment made 1 or more
medical visits during the survey year (data not shown).
Depression Treatment
An estimated 8.1% of adult population received treatment for
depressionregardlessoftheirdepressionscreenstatus(Table1).
Among those treated, a minority had screen-positive depres-
sion (29.9%) or had serious psychological distress (21.8%), as
defined by a K6 score of 13 or more (Figure 1).
The percentage of adults who were treated for depres-
sion varied across sociodemographic groups. The highest per-
centages of treatment occurred among publicly insured indi-
viduals and separated, divorced, and widowed persons;
whereas the lowest percentages occurred among uninsured
adults, racial/ethnic minorities, and men. Compared with
uninsured adults, those with public health insurance had
approximately 3 times the odds of receiving depression
treatment (Table 1).
Treatment Modalities
Antidepressants (87.0%) were the most common treatment for
depression followed by psychotherapy (23.2%), anxiolytics
(13.5%), antipsychotics (7.0%), and mood stabilizers (5.1%)
(eTable in the Supplement).
A minority of depressed patients receiving antidepres-
sants (20.3%), psychotherapy (30.5%), or their combination
(29.6%) had serious distress (data not shown). Patients with
serious as compared to less serious distress were signifi-
cantly less likely to be treated with antidepressants (81.1% vs
88.6%, P < .001) (Figure 2). By contrast, patients with serious
distress were significantly more likely than patients with less
distress to be treated with antipsychotics (13.4% vs 5.2%,
P < .001), anxiolytics (21.0% vs 11.4%, P < .001), mood stabi-
lizers(8.9%vs4.0%,P < .001),psychotherapy(32.5%vs20.6%,
P < .001)orantidepressantsandpsychotherapy(14.8%vs6.5%,
P < .001). The 2 groups did not significantly differ with re-
spect to the percentage that received any of the 4 classes of
medications (91.2% vs 92.7%, P = .30) (eTable in the Supple-
ment).Theassociationbetweendistressandcombinationtreat-

tainment related to a stronger association between serious
distress and treatment (interaction P = .05) (Table 2).
Health Care Professionals
Most patients who were treated for depression were treated
exclusively by general medical professionals (73.3%), with
fewer patients treated by psychiatrists (23.6%) or other men-
tal health specialists (12.6%). Patients treated for depression
exclusively by general medical professionals were less likely
than those treated by psychiatrists or other mental health pro-
fessionals to have screened positive for depression or serious
psychological distress (Figure 2). Treatments for depression
varied across the 3 groups of health professionals. Although
most patients treated by each group received antidepres-
sants, patients who were treated only by general medical pro-
fessionals seldom received psychotherapy (eTable in the
Supplement).
Treated patients with serious distress were nearly twice
as likely as those with less distress to be treated by a psychia-
trist (Figure 2). While approximately half of college graduates
with serious distress were treated by psychiatrists, less than a
third of their counterparts with less education received psy-
chiatric care (Table 3). Patients with serious distress were also
more likely than those with less distress to be treated by other
mental health professionals (Figure 2). Married as well as pri-
vately insured and uninsured patients with serious distress
were disproportionately treated by other mental health pro-
fessionals (Table 3). As compared to patients with less serious

college graduates (Table 3).
Discussion
Despitearecentincreaseinantidepressantuse,substantialgaps
persist in the treatment of depression.1,2 Over two-thirds of all
adults who screened positive for depression did not receive
depression treatment during the survey year. Racial/ethnic
minorities had a particularly low likelihood of receiving
treatment.26 Because most screen-positive untreated adults
made at least 1 annual medical visit, primary care models that
involve depression care managers and consulting specialists
may have opportunities to narrow the gap in untreated de-
pression. Prior research has shown that, compared with de-
pressedprimarycarepatientswhoreceivestandardcare,those
who receive integrated mental health services tend to achieve
more favorable depression outcomes.27
Although antidepressants are not superior to placebo for
mild depression,11,12 patients with less serious distress were
more likely than those with serious distress to receive antide-
pressants. The clinical reasons for this pattern are unclear, but
may include a tendency to overestimate the effectiveness of
antidepressants in treating mild depression, insufficient time
to provide alternative interventions for mild depression, and
errors in clinical assessment. A meta-analysis28 of the clinical
diagnosis of depression in primary care revealed that in a typi-
cal practice, false positives substantially outnumber true posi-
tives. The reported treatment patterns suggest a need to in-
crease routine assessment of depression severity. In systems
of care that routinely assess depression severity and use de-
pression guidelines that do not recommend antidepressants
for mild symptoms, antidepressants are rarely prescribed for
mild depression.29 Yet limited evidence supports the effec-
tiveness of psychotherapy for mild depression. Although cog-
nitive behavioral therapy and other psychological interven-
tions have been reported to have small to moderate beneficial
effects on patient reported outcomes in mild depression, this
researchisinconclusive.30Moreresearchisneededonwhether
antidepressants or psychotherapy are superior to exercise or
nonspecific attention for mild depression.
Psychotherapy was less commonly provided than antide-
pressants. Nevertheless, psychotherapy was more frequently
provided to patients with more serious than with less serious
psychological distress. This is consistent with evidence
supporting efficacy of several specific psychotherapies for

moderate depression31 with less benefit for mild depression.32
Yet only a minority (30.5%) of depressed patients receiving
psychotherapy had serious psychological distress.
Psychotherapycanbeeffectivefordepressioninlaterlife33
and many older adults prefer psychotherapy over pharmaco-
therapy (57% vs 43%).34 In our study, however, psycho-
therapy was rarely provided to older adults, even those with
seriouspsychologicaldistress.Thismaybebecauseolderadults
tend to favor treatment in primary care settings35 where psy-
chotherapy may not be available. However, even when on-
site psychotherapy is freely available to depressed older pri-
marycarepatientswhoexpressapreferenceforpsychotherapy,
some select antidepressants.36
Approximately 1 in 5 patients treated for depression
received both antidepressants and psychotherapy, although
the proportion was lower for older adults and patients with
less education. Patients with serious psychological distress
were more likely than those with less distress to receive
combined treatment. In these patients, antidepressants
combined with psychotherapy tends to confer greater
improvement than antidepressants alone.37 Because combi-
nation treatment is more costly and many patients improve
on single-modality treatment, it may be reasonable to
reserve combined treatment for patients who are at greatest
risk of incomplete response to monotherapy.38 Lower
income and education,39,40 as well as older age,41 have been
associated with poor outcomes in depression. Nevertheless,
these groups did not have higher rates of receiving combina-
tion treatment. These patterns highlight the importance of
improving access to high-quality depression care for socio-
economically disadvantaged groups.
In the treatment of depression, patients with serious psy-
chological distress were approximately twice as likely as those
with less distress to be treated by a psychiatrist. This may re-
flect a tendency for psychiatrists to care for patients with more
severe mental health conditions42 and aligns with guideline
recommendations.6 Patient and family influences on treat-
ment-seeking behavior including a tendency for adults with
more severe, distressing, or impairing symptoms to directly
seek out specialty mental health care likely contribute to this
distribution of patients across provider groups.43 This pat-
tern did not extend to older patients, African Americans,
patients with less education, and uninsured patients. An
important strength of some programs that integrate special-
ized mental services into primary care is their ability to facili-
tate access to effective depression care to disadvantaged
populations.44,45
Antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics were
more commonly used to treat patients with higher than with
lower levels of distress. These medications tend to be re-
served for patients with more complex or treatment-
resistant conditions. Antipsychotics are effective adjunctive
treatments for patients who have not responded to multiple
antidepressant trials.46 Anxiety frequently cooccurs with de-
pression and coprescription of anxiolytics may reduce early
antidepressant discontinuation47 or help manage anxiety
symptoms that do not respond to antidepressants. Although
benzodiazepines and other anxiolytics are commonly pre-
scribed to patients with depression,48 concerns over cogni-
tive impairment, withdrawal symptoms following discontinu-
ation, and psychomotor effects underscore a need for caution
concerning long-term use of anxiolytics in patients with
depression.49 Mood stabilizers might be useful adjuncts to
antidepressants for treating irritability or agitation associ-
ated with depression.50
A minority of patients who were treated for depression
screened positive for depression (29.9%) or had serious psy-
chological distress (21.8%). Without more detailed informa-
tion, it is not possible to determine how many patients with-
out these clinical indicators had been effectively treated.
However,thelargepercentageoftreatedpatientswhoscreened
negative for depression and did not have serious distress raises
the possibility of overtreatment.51
Limitations
The current analyses have several limitations. First, the MEPS
surveys rely on respondent recall and diaries which may un-
derestimatementalhealthserviceuse;however,amedicalpro-
vider survey supplements and validates reported service use.
Second, although K6 scores correlate with several psychiatric
disorders, it is not a diagnostic measure. Third, although the
resultsprovidenationallyrepresentativeinformationonmedi-
cation use and psychotherapy, no information is provided con-
cerning medication doses or duration. Fourth, no informa-
tion is available concerning treatment outcomes. Fifth, the
survey does not permit estimation of state-level variation in
depression treatment. Finally, no adjustments were made to
the many P values for the multiple comparisons; therefore,
P values should be interpreted with caution.
Conclusions
Although access to depression care has expanded in recent
years,52 critical treatment gaps persist, especially for racial/
ethnicminorities,lowincomeindividuals,lesseducatedadults,
and uninsured people. Among adults who receive depression
care, it is important to align patients with appropriate treat-
ments and health care professionals. With dissemination of in-
tegrated care models, opportunities exist to promote depres-
sion care that is neither too intensive nor insufficient for each
patient’
s clinical needs.
