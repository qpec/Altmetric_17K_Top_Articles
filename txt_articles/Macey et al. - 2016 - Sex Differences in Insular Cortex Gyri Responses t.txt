Sex differences in autonomic regulation may underlie cardiovascular disease variations 
between females and males. One key autonomic brain region is the insular cortex, 
which typically consists of five main gyri in each hemisphere, and shows a topograph-
ical organization of autonomic function across those gyri. The present study aims to 
identify possible sex differences in organization of autonomic function in the insula. 
We studied brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to a series 
of four 18-s Valsalva maneuvers in 22 healthy females (age ± SD: 50.0 ± 7.9 years) and 
36 healthy males (45.3 ± 9.2 years). Comparisons of heart rate (HR) and fMRI signals 
were performed with repeated measures ANOVA (threshold P < 0.05 for all findings). All 
subjects achieved the target 30 mmHg expiratory pressure for all challenges. Typical HR 
responses were elicited by the maneuver, including HR increases from ~4 s into the strain 
period (Phase II) and rapid declines to below baseline 5–10 s, following strain release 
(Phase IV). Small, but significant, sex differences in HR percent change occurred during 
the sympathetic-dominant Phase II (female < male) and parasympathetic-dominant 
Phase IV (female > male, i.e., greater undershoot in males). The insular cortices showed 
similar patterns in all gyri, with greater signal decreases in males than females. Both 
sexes exhibited an anterior–posterior topographical organization of insular responses 
during Phase II, with anterior gyri showing higher responses than more posterior gyri. 
The exception was the right anterior-most gyrus in females, which had lower responses 
than the four other right gyri. Responses were lateralized, with right-sided dominance 
during Phase II in both sexes, except the right anterior-most gyrus in females, which 
showed lower responses than the left. The findings confirm the anterior and right-
sided sympathetic dominance of the insula. Although sex differences were prominent in 
response magnitude, organization differences between males and females were limited 
to the right anterior-most gyrus, which showed a lower fMRI response in females vs. 
males (and vs. other gyri in females). The sex differences suggest a possible differing 
baseline state of brain physiology or tonic functional activity between females and males, 
especially in the right anterior-most gyrus.

Sex differences in cardiovascular and other diseases may be 
driven in part by variations in autonomic nervous system 
function; identifying the neural source of such differences may 
improve understanding of mechanisms and potential treatment 
options. While many sex differences in cardiovascular function 
vary by age, with substantial variations between pre- and post- 
menopausal women, there nevertheless remain distinct character-
istics of females compared with males (1, 2). For example, males 
show a higher prevalence of hypertension than females (3–5), 
but prognoses for women after myocardial infarction are worse 
than for males (6, 7). Such clinical sex differences are associated 
with autonomic function variation, including reduced muscle 
sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in women (8, 9), lower rest-
ing heart rate (HR) in men, differing HR variability patterns (10), 
sex differences in catecholamine responses to central sympathetic 
inhibition (11), and lower baroreflex sensitivity in females [(12); 
for review, see Dart et al. (13)]. One possibility is that enhanced 
alterations in sympatho-adrenal activation in males compared 
with females reflect greater sympathetic nervous system control 
in females, which is protective against hypertension and other 
cardiovascular disease (14). Many neural structures associated 
with autonomic functions show sex differences in function or 
structure at cellular and anatomical scales (15, 16). Brain regions 
serving autonomic regulation are potential therapeutic targets 
for interventions, but further understanding of sex differences 
in autonomic function of such regions is required.
The insular cortex is one key autonomic regulatory structure 
located under the parietal operculum and within the lateral sul-
cus (17–20). The insula receives input from multiple cortical areas 
involved with emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor functions 
and projects to autonomic outflow areas in the brainstem both 
directly and via the hypothalamus (21–24). Although the insular 
cortices may not be involved in tonic maintenance of blood pres-
sure (25), stimulation, stroke, lesion, resection, and MRI studies 
in human and non-human models provide evidence which 
demonstrates that those cortical areas serve roles in autonomic 
regulation (20, 25–39). The gyri of the insula are organized in 
a ventrodorsal orientation (18). Functions are topographically 
organized, in both human and non-human primates, with auto-
nomic regulation, in particular, showing differentiation over the 
major gyri (40–46). However, the topographic differentiation of 
autonomic function by sex is unclear. Sex differences in spatial 
organization of insular function could contribute to sex differ-
ences in physiologic autonomic regulation (47).
Altered functions could arise from differences in structure. 
Males show larger insulae, with on average more gyral folding 
than females (16, 48). Larger brain weight and volume in males 
are consistent macroscopic findings, although one accounted 
for by their larger body dimensions (15, 49–51). Distribution 
of gray and white matter brain tissue compartments shows sex 
differences when adjusted for individual brain size (51–57). A 
recent meta-analysis of raw mean brain volumes for typically 
developing females and males found that the right insular cortex, 
right anterior cingulate gyrus, and bilateral thalamus gray matter 
densities were greater in female subjects, whereas the left anterior 
and posterior cingulate gyri and the right and left amygdalae have 
greater gray matter volume in male subjects (58).
The topographic organization of autonomic functions in the 
insula can be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing (fMRI) during physiological challenges. One such stimulus is 
the Valsalva maneuver (44, 59), a standard test of autonomic func-
tion involving a forced expiratory effort against a closed glottis, 
resulting in increased thoracic pressure (60–63). The physiologic 
responses to the Valsalva consist of four phases, with different 
recruitment of parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, and 
the task allows differentiation of various components of the auto-
nomic response, with amplitude and timing patterns that might 
differentiate sex roles (64–66). Phase II is the strain period 3–5 s 
after initiation of the challenge and is characterized by strong 
sympathetic activation, indicated by an increasing HR (67, 68). 
Sympathetic withdrawal follows in the Phase IV recovery period 
3–5 s after pressure release, characterized by a rapid HR fall to 
levels below baseline, followed by a gradual return over minutes 
to starting levels (69–71). Variations from the normal response 
occur in people with impaired autonomic regulation (72).
The objective was to assess female and male insular gyral 
organization of fMRI responses to the Valsalva maneuver in 
healthy adults. We evaluated both anterior–posterior organiza-
tion within left and right insular cortices, and the laterality of 
equivalent gyri, since the right insula has been shown to be 
dominant during sympathetic phases of autonomic stimuli (44); 
animal and human models also show a preferentially sympathetic 
role for the right insula (73–76). Based on sex differences in 
central and peripheral autonomic function, we hypothesized 
that insular organization would differ between the sexes. Based 
on greater cell densities in females, we hypothesized males 
would show lower magnitudes of responses than females. Based 
on the lower metabolism in females in the anterior insula, we 
hypothesize that the short gyri would show more substantial sex 
differences compared with the long gyri.

subjects
We studied 57 healthy adults (age ± SD: 47.0 ± 9.1 years, range: 
31–66 years; 37 males, 20 females). All subjects had no history 
of cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, 
neurological disorders, or mental illness and were not taking car-
diovascular or psychotropic medications. Subjects were recruited 
from the Los Angeles area and did not weigh more than 125 kg 
or have any metallic or electronic implants; the latter two issues 
are MRI scanner contraindications. All subjects provided written 
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, 
and the research protocol was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of UCLA. No subjects were taking exogenous 
sex hormones (for example, oral contraceptive pills, hormone 
replacement therapy, or testosterone therapy).
Valsalva Maneuver
The Valsalva maneuver was performed in a sequence of four 18-s 
exhalations against a closed glottis, spaced 1 min apart, to a target 
 FigUre 1 | insular gyri color-coded and overlaid on average anatomical scan. The anterior region of the insula is comprised of the short gyri, including the 
anterior short gyrus (ASG), mid short gyrus (MSG), and posterior short gyrus (PSG). The posterior region of the insula is comprised of the long gyri, including the 
anterior long gyrus (ALG) and posterior long gyrus (PLG). Coordinates in MNI space are indicated for each slice, and the slice location of the axial view is shown by 
the dashed line on the sagittal view and vice versa.

expiratory pressure of 30 mmHg (77). While 40 mmHg for 20 s is 
commonly used, we selected slightly lower pressure and duration 
to help ensure the task could be successfully performed by a wide 
range of subjects of differing age and health. A light signal was 
used to indicate onset of the challenge for the Valsalva effort to 
the subject. Subjects were instructed to, upon seeing the light 
signal, take a breath and exhale against a resistance, maintaining 
a target pressure. A second light was illuminated when the subject 
achieved this 30 mmHg target pressure. Subjects practiced the 
Valsalva maneuver prior to scanning, and the research team 
observed each challenge to ensure the target pressure was reached 
and maintained for each of the four expiratory periods.
Physiologic signals
Cardiac, load pressure and indicator signals (e.g., light on/off) 
were recorded with an analog-to-digital acquisition system 
(instruNet INET-100B, GWI Instruments, Inc., Somerville, MA, 
USA). HR was assessed using an MRI-compatible pulse oximeter 
(Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA). The sensor was 
placed on the right index finger throughout the scan, and HR 
was calculated from the raw oximetry signal acquired at 1 kHz 
using custom peak-detection software followed by expert review. 
Expiratory pressure was measured via tubing connected to a 
pressure sensor (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT, USA) 
outside the scanner. Patient cue signals were simultaneously 
recorded, and all signals were synchronized to the MRI scans 
and data corresponding to the fMRI recording period extracted.
Mri scanning
Functional MRI scans were acquired using a 3.0-T scanner 
(Siemens Magneton Tim-Trio, Erlangen, Germany), while sub-
jects lay supine. A foam pad was placed on either side of the head 
to minimize movement. We collected whole-brain images with 
the blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast [repetition 
time (TR)= 2000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; 
matrix size = 64 × 64; field-of-view = 220 mm × 220 mm; 
slice thickness = 4.5 mm]. The spatial resolution was based 
on achieving whole-brain coverage with the fastest possible 
acquisition time. Two high-resolution, T1-weighted anatomi-
cal images were also acquired with a magnetization prepared 
rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (TR = 2200 ms; 
TE = 2.2 ms; inversion time = 900 ms; flip angle = 9°; matrix 
size = 256 × 256; field-of-view = 230 mm × 230 mm; slice 
thickness = 1.0 mm). Field map data consisting of phase and 
magnitude images were collected to allow for correction of 
distortions due to field inhomogeneities.
Mri Data Preprocessing
All anatomical scans were inspected to ensure the absence of 
visible pathology. For each fMRI series, the global signal was 
calculated and the images realigned to account for head motion. 
Subjects with large changes in global BOLD signal, or who 
moved more than 4 mm in any direction were not included in 
the study. Each fMRI series was linearly detrended to account 
for signal drift (but not global effects) (78) and corrected for 
field inhomogeneities, spatially normalized, and smoothed 
(8-mm Gaussian filter), and mean time trends from each voxel 
were calculated across all subjects, as well as the challenge-
means across each of the four Valsalva periods. A mean image 
of all subjects’ spatially normalized, anatomic scans was created. 
Software used included the statistical parametric mapping pack-
age, SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, 
UK; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), MRIcron (79), and MATLAB-
based custom software.
region of interest Tracing
The five major gyral regions in the insular cortex, the anterior 
short gyrus (ASG), mid short gyrus (MSG), posterior short 
gyrus (PSG), anterior long gyrus (ALG), and posterior long 
gyrus (PLG), were outlined on the mean anatomical image with 
MRIcroN software (79), using previously published anatomical 
descriptions (18, 80). Figure 1 illustrates the gryi on an average 
anatomical scan in sagittal and axial views. While individual 
tracing would be more accurate for identifying the gyral dif-
ferentiation on anatomical scans, the fMRI data are at a much 
lower spatial resolution (voxel volume of 53 vs. 0.8 mm3 for the

anatomical scans), and the BOLD effect itself, which is the basis 
for assessing neuronal responses, is diffuse, so the advantage 
of individual tracing would be minimal. Since gyral folding in 
the insula has individual variation (48), the present approach 
distinguishes gyral regions rather than gyri per se. The three main 
gyri of the anterior insula, the ASG, MSG, and PSG, make up 
the convex surface of the structure and are visible on the sagittal 
and axial views of the mean anatomical image. The accessory and 
transverse gyri, two other gyri in the anterior insula, are difficult 
to visualize (80) and were not visible on the mean anatomical 
image. Thus, in our tracing of the ASG, we included the entire 
most-anterior portion of the insula, which included the accessory 
and transverse gyri. The posterior gyri (ALG and PLG) were eas-
ily visible on sagittal and axial sections of the anatomical volume.
statistical analysis
Repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA), implemented with 
the mixed linear model procedure “proc mixed” in SAS 9.4 soft-
ware (81), was used to identify periods of significant response 
relative to baseline, during the Valsalva and subsequent recovery 
periods (82). We modeled the fMRI responses as a function of 
scan timepoints. Significance was first assessed at the global 
level; as per the Tukey–Fisher criterion for multiple comparisons, 
the timepoints of significant responses were identified only for 
significant models (P < 0.05). Three sets of models were created: 
(1) within and between-group analyses of fMRI signal change 
relative to baseline; (2) separate female and male between-group 
signal change relative to PLG, where group consistent of five gyri 
in one hemisphere (with six between-gryi comparisons each); 
and (3) separate female and male signal change of left relative to 
right gyrus. Statistical assessment of sex differences for (2) and 
(3) were not performed as those signals were relative to another 
gyrus, such that the signal in males was relative to a different 
reference than females, which would complicate interpretation 
of RMANOVA-identified female and male differences. To avoid 
potential confounds due to global vascular effects, we focused on 
relative changes between gyri. The restriction of only assessing 
differences, rather than absolute responses, results from the 
relative nature of the BOLD-based fMRI technique. To identify 
anterior–posterior organization, we assessed responses with 
respect to the PLG, as the posterior insula typically responds less 
than anterior regions in response to autonomic stimuli (83). To 
identify lateral organization, we assessed right-sided relative to 
left-sided responses for each gyrus (44). We did not include a 
hemisphere factor in any model since the aims were restricted 
to identifying gyral-specific differences. Since age is a potentially 
confounding factor, especially in females given the changes in 
autonomic function associated with menopausal status (84), we 
implemented each RMANOVA model both with and without age 
as a covariate.
resUlTs
subjects
Females were, on average, slightly older than males (mean 
age ± SD: female 50.0 ± 7.9 years; male 45.3 ± 9.2 years), although 
the difference was not significant (P = 0.06, independent samples 
t-test). Body mass index also did not differ significantly (female 
24.0 ± 5.1 kg/m2, male 25.2 ± 2.7 kg/m2; group difference 
P = 0.24, independent samples t-test). Six females reported being 
left-handed, two ambidextrous, and 14 right-handed. Four males 
reported being left-handed, two ambidextrous, and 30 right-
handed. The difference was not significant (P = 0.2, chi-squared).
Physiology
The average HR changes in females and males illustrate the typical 
pattern of autonomic responses elicited by the Valsalva (Figure 2). 
The initial HR increase results from full inspiration prior to the 
forceful expiration, which leads to brief HR increases as compen-
sation for the thoracic pressure changes, a period termed Phase 0 
(85). While there were significant differences between females 
and males, notably smaller relative HR increases during Phase II 
and reduced undershoot in Phase IV, the magnitude of those 
differences was small, and both sexes showed the same pattern 
of responses (Figure 2A). The absolute levels show the expected 
higher HR in females over males (Figure 2B), and visual inspec-
tion of the sequence of four Valsalva challenges shows similar 
responses over the repeated maneuvers (Figure 2B).
Both groups showed a decrease in oxygen saturation (SaO2) 
from 10 s into the challenge, with a return toward baseline begin-
ning ~8 s into the recovery period. The SaO2 was slightly higher 
in females than males during baseline and recovery periods 
(Figures 2C,D). However, females showed a greater decline 
during and after the challenge, such that the values were similar 
during the low SaO2 period. Female recovery was also larger, with 
an overshoot peaking ~20 s into the recovery period, whereas 
males showed a flat response.
fMri responses
The Valsalva maneuver elicited significant fMRI signal responses 
during the expiration period that differed from baseline in all gyri 
in both sexes (Figure 3). For both males and females, significant 
within-group responses were present throughout the strain 
period and during the recovery (blue X’s and red O’s in Figure 3).
Female and male responses differed in all gyri (Table 1; 
Figure 3). While the patterns included increases and decreases 
relative to baseline, the magnitude of female responses was con-
sistently higher than males throughout the Valsalva period, as 
shown by the higher group averages (that is, the solid female lines 
higher than dashed male lines). Group differences were present 
from 4 s into the challenge, shortly after the start of the strain 
period (P < 0.05, RMANOVA red–yellow stars in Figure 3). The 
differences remained through to the end of the strain period, with 
the exception of the right ASG, where there were no differences 
from timepoints 8–12 s. The sex difference remained up to the 
first timepoint after the strain in the left ASG and in all posterior 
gyri (bilateral PSG, ALG, and PLG). The MSG showed no group 
difference during recovery.
anterior–Posterior Organization
Although most functional organization in terms of anterior–
posterior and left–right relative responses was similar to the 
 FigUre 2 | heart rate (hr) and saO2 changes during a series of four Valsalva maneuvers, averaged for female and male groups. (a) HR% change 
relative to baseline and (c) SaO2 averaged over four challenges (mean ± SE). Timepoints of significant within-group responses indicated in blue and green *, and

mixed group findings, differences appeared by sex, especially in 
the anterior insula (Table 2; Figure 4). An anterior–posterior 
organization was evident in the left insula, with ASG > MSG, 
MSG > PSG, and PSG > ALG. The organization of these four 
anterior-most gyri was similar in females and males, with signifi-
cant differences between the regions during the expiratory period 
(P < 0.05, RMANOVA). However, the PLG in males showed a 
similar magnitude of response to the ALG, whereas in females, 
the PLG showed a magnitude between those of the MSG and 
PSG. In both sexes, the ASG demonstrated an elevated response 
relative to other gyri throughout most of the strain period (time-
points 4–18 s), with the MSG also showing a sustained, higher

response relative to more posterior gyri. The same was true for 
the PSG relative to the ALG, and in males, the PSG relative to the 
PLG. In females, the PSG displayed significantly lower activity 
than the PLG for 6–10 s during the challenge. To summarize the 
left-sided patterns, males: ASG > MSG, MSG > PSG, PSG > PLG; 
females: ASG ≥ MSG, MSG > PSG, PSG ≤ PLG.
The right insula showed an anterior–posterior organiza-
tion in males, although the ASG and MSG neither differ 
significantly nor did the ALG and PLG; the PSG responses 
were between these pairs of regions. In females, the right 
insular organization differed from that in males. The MSG 
and PSG were modestly higher than the PLG for half the strain 
period (6–14 s), whereas the ASG showed the lowest response 
in conjunction with the ALG. To summarize the right-sided 
patterns, females: MSG, PSG, PLG > ASG, ALG; males: ASG, 
MSG > PSG > ALG, PLG.

left–right Organization
Lateralization of activity during the challenge was evident in all 
gyri with the exception of the ASG in males and MSG in females 
(Table 3; Figure 5). However, the pattern of lateralization differed 
between sexes. Males showed greater activity in the right over 
left throughout the expiratory period in all gyri except the ASG. 
Females showed similar sustained greater activity in right vs. left 
in long gyri and PSG. In the MSG, there was no significant effect 
(Table 3). In the ASG, females showed the opposite pattern to 
males and other gyri, namely, a signal decrease in right vs. left
 
during the expiratory phase.
age influences
Inclusion of age in the models testing above did not alter the sig-
nificance of group, time, or group by time variables (Tables 1–3). 
In all models, the inclusion of age slightly improved the model 
fit as indicated by higher chi square and −2 log likelihood val-
ues. As a variable in these models, age was only significant in 
 
anterior–posterior comparisons, on both sides in females and on 
the left only in males.
summary of Key Finding: sex Differences 
in right asg
Comparison of ASG responses in Figures 3 and 4 show that male 
and female responses in the right ASG show the most substantial 
differences of any region, leading to both lateralization and 
 
anterior–posterior organization differences in the ASG region. 
These substantial sex differences in both magnitudes and patterns 
of fMRI signals occurred, despite only moderate variations in HR 
responses to the Valsalva maneuver.
We made available summary data including RMANOVA 
models and results, figures, and preprocessed fMRI images in a 
repository (86); the full raw dataset could not be provided to due 
the consent acquired at the time.
DiscUssiOn
Overview
Responses in both the right and left insular cortices during the 
strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver differed between sexes, 
with larger magnitude fMRI signal declines in males over females 
in all gyri. Similar anterior–posterior distributions of activity 
appeared in both males and females. Lateralization showed 
a right-sided dominance during the strain phase in all gyri in 
males, and in all but the anterior-most ASG in females, consistent 
with the right-sided sympathetic dominance previously reported 
(73). Thus, the most notable differences between sexes were the 
magnitude of response and the unique responses in females in 
the right ASG. These male–female differences in insular function

may contribute to sex differences in cardiac responses to auto-
nomic challenges and, over time, cardiovascular disease. The 
strain phase of the Valsalva is characterized by a large and rapid 
increase in sympathetic activity, as reflected in the HR increase; 
thus, the general findings corroborate the more anterior location 
of autonomic control within the insula.
insular role in regulation:  
fMri and Physiology
Heart rate changes exhibited a typical pattern for healthy adults, 
with only minor sex differences, consistent with other findings 
(87). The fMRI time course in males and females followed an 
approximate inverse relationship with the HR changes, with brief 
insular deactivations at inspiration and beginning of expiration, 
declines during the sympathetic Phase II, a brief trough after 
release, followed by an overshoot and return to baseline in Phase 
IV (47). Oxygen saturation decreased in the latter half of Phase 
II and remained low for ~8 s following recovery, with a rebound 
in ~15 s into Phase IV; the oxygenation changes likely reflect lack 
of ventilation during breath-hold then higher ventilation after 
termination of the Valsalva. The fMRI signals did not appear 
to follow the oxygenation saturation patterns. While the fMRI 
changes could reflect a sensory role, with neural responses based 
on blood pressure and related afferent signals, human stroke and 
animal stimulation studies suggest the structure participates in 
regulation of autonomic functions (24, 74, 88–90). In particular, 
the observed pattern is consistent with the insula having an 
inhibitory role on HR changes. However, the insula does not 
show the exact opposite pattern to the HR changes since the 
functional role in cardiovascular regulation is more complex than 
a direct, proportional inhibition. The fMRI signals in all gyri 
return to baseline levels relatively early in Phase IV (which can 
last several minutes), suggesting the structure is not involved in 
sustaining sympathetic withdrawal. The insula has projections to 
the hypothalamus, a key autonomic region closely linked with 
medullary outflow areas (91, 92), as with other cortical areas, 
the insula shows inhibitory roles over lower brain regions (93). 
However, the male participants consistently showed greater 
insula declines in fMRI compared with females, even though HR 
changes were similar; in other words, the differences in magni-
tude of insula response did not lead to a difference in HR changes,

at least as measured by percent change. Other challenges have 
been reported to also elicit sex differences in insular responses; 
lower body negative pressure leads to greater right, but not left
 
insular activity in males compared with females (94), and a hand 
grip task leads to higher right-sided responses in males compared 
with females (95). The reasons for greater insula deactivation to 
the Valsalva maneuver in males are unclear, but could reflect a 
different baseline state or a different neural response. Cerebral 
blood flow (CBF) differs by sex, but in young adults, the insula 
shows lower metabolism in females compared with males (96).
lateralization
The lateralized organization of the insular responses in all but the 
anterior-most gyri showed greater right-side activation during 
Phase II of the Valsalva in both males and females, consistent 
with a preferentially sympathetic role of the right over left insula 
(73–76). The same patterns appeared in a combined female/
male group (44). Similarly, left-sided insula injury is associated 
with greater parasympathetic than sympathetic impairment 
(97, 98). In some circumstances, the rat posterior insula shows 
no lateralization of cardiovascular function in response to 
stimulation (90); while differences between rat and humans 
(74) may extend to lateralization, these recent data, nevertheless, 
show that the insula has complex topographic organizational 
and different response patterns arise from different stimulation 
types. The two hemispheres also show strong connections in 
the anterior insula (99). Nevertheless, human stroke findings 
are consistent with a right-sided sympathetic regulatory role 
(28, 100, 101). Resection of the right insula due to the pres-
ence of a tumor also results in greater parasympathetic activity 
(38). Functional responses to a hand grip challenge also show 
right-sided dominance during sympathetic phases, for both 
left- and right-handed tasks (102). Further support is provided 
by a meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings (36). The present 
findings support a right-sided sympathetic dominance for at 
least some types of autonomic regulation, including, in this case, 
increased intrathoracic pressure.
anterior sympathetic Dominance
During the sympathetic-dominant Phase II of the Valsalva, the 
anterior gyri showed greater fMRI responses compared with 
posterior gyri, with the exception of the ASG in female subjects. 
Other imaging studies show similar preferentially anterior insu-
lar roles in physiologic responses (103). At a cellular level, the 
rat insula shows varying structure and propagation properties 
in the rostral–caudal direction [equivalent of anterior–poste-
rior in humans (23, 104)], consistent with varying functional 
topography. Anterior function is more closely associated with 
visceral reactivity in the rat (40). Some of the original evidence 
supporting lateralization of sympathetic and parasympathetic 
function was based on right anterior insula stimulation, showing 
HR increases in rats (74). Supporting these earlier animal find-
ings, in a healthy adult human population (males and females 
combined), the Valsalva shows a distinct right-sided dominance 
during the sympathetic Phase II period (44). Sex differences 
in the anterior-dominant sympathetic roles are highlighted 
by lower body negative pressure studies, which elicit greater 
right anterior insular activity in males than females, together 
with different physiological responses (94); males also showed 
greater reductions in left anterior insular activity. The present 
findings, in all but the right ASG in females, are thus consistent 
with current understanding of anterior–posterior distribution of 
autonomic function.
sources of sex Differences  
in Brain Function
A number of sex-based structural issues may contribute to the 
regional variation in functional responses found here. The mid-
dle short gyrus (MSG) in males is more distinct than in females; 
this sub-region was also more distinct in the left hemisphere, 
suggesting other sex and laterality variations (16). Females show 
higher gray matter volume in the right insular cortex than males 
(58). However, males show a greater number of distinct gyri on 
average [4.7 vs. 4.1 (48)]. Insular fibers also vary by sex; these 
fibers are influenced during development by hormonal status 
(105), specifically, connections between the left insula and left

precentral gyrus show a lower density during development 
in females vs. males (106). In addition to structural differ-
ences, insular metabolism in young adults is lower in females, 
compared with males, but this difference is reduced in more 
posterior regions (96).
The global sex differences in functional responses could arise 
from varied sources, including metabolism, CBF, and hormone 
levels, as well as functional state. Sex hormones influence func-
tion (107–109) and have neuroprotective effects (110). CBF is 
higher in females than males, and activity-related CBF changes 
vary by sex (111, 112). Metabolism shows variation by sex in 
the parietal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices in adults 
(113), as well as the insula in adolescents (96). Brain functional 
state likely also differs between females and males in the insula; 
for example, both basal state and stress responses mediated by 
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis show extensive sex 
variations (114). The sex differences in these physiologic variables 
likely lead to sex differences in baseline state and responsiveness 
of insula function.
Differentiating the right asg
The anterior-most ASG showed patterns distinct from other 
female gyral responses as well as from male ASG responses. 
Since the HR changes were similar between sexes, this later-
alization difference reflects either a differing baseline state or 
an altered organization. Considering the activation differences 
extend across all gyri, females and males may differ both by 
baseline state and by organization on the anterior short gyri. 
This altered organization of the anterior gyri was also reflected 
in within-structure, anterior-to-posterior organization, but with 
 11
Macey et al.

the differences appearing principally on the right side, with the 
anterior and mid short gyri showing relatively lower fMRI signals 
in females, in contrast with the higher activation in males. On the 
left side, both sexes demonstrate greater anterior gyral activation. 
The combined findings, therefore, suggest differing organization 
between females and males of the right ASG only, as opposed 
to differing baseline states.
clinical implications
A range of behavioral and physiological characteristics are 
mediated by insular structural and functional properties. The 
sex-based variations in the structure may mediate mechanisms 
underlying significant health issues. The blood pressure regula-
tory roles served by the insula likely contribute to the higher 
lifetime risk of stroke in women over men, with that preference 
principally found in older women (115). Age-related findings 
may directly reflect developmental changes in neural maturation 
or later in neuropathology unique to the insula. Alterations of 
the insular cortices appear prominently in structural MRI stud-
ies of depression, and women are twice as likely to experience 
depression signs (116). The insula is frequently implicated in 
anxiety (117, 118), and women show more prevalent and more 
disabling anxiety disorders (119). The incidence of migraine is 
higher in females (120), and the insula serves a significant role 
in integration of pain signals (121). Thus, differences in the 
integrity of structure and function of the insula by sex should 
be considered in evaluation of central contributions to multiple 
medical disorders.
The fMri signal and saO2 influences
The fMRI BOLD signal is influenced by baseline factors and 
changes in cerebral blood volume and metabolism and thus is not 
necessarily only a measure of neural activity. Sex differences in 
SaO2 included slightly higher baseline and recovery levels and a 
deeper fall and larger overshoot during recovery. Since fMRI sig-
nals are sensitive to baseline blood oxygenation, these differences 
in SaO2 could have influenced the findings (122). Conceivable, a 
higher SaO2 could lead to a ceiling effect for the females relative 
to males and thus limit the possible magnitude of signal change 
as seen in Figure 3; however, if all factors are equal, a higher 
baseline BOLD level would result in a larger signal change (122). 
The dynamic sex differences in SaO2 response are unlikely to have 
influenced the left–right or anterior–posterior differences since 
those effects occurred later in the challenge and lasted into the 
recovery period. Furthermore, global blood oxygenation levels as 
measured with a pulse oximeter would affect all regions similarly 
and thus should not contribute to region-specific variation. A 
final consideration is that challenges such as the Valsalva that 
elicit large changes in blood pressure lead to CBF and volume 
changes that dominate over oxygenation and neuronal activity 
influences, and variations in both baseline and responses of 
vascular state could have differed by sex. Such influences are by 
their nature global and could have influenced the consistent mag-
nitude sex differences (Figure 3), but the left–right and anterior 
posterior differences (Figures 4 and 5) should principally reflect 
neuronal factors.
age influences
There may be a modest confound of age since the sample was 
not exactly aged matched, with females being older albeit 
not significantly so (50.0 vs. 45.3 years, P = 0.06). Females in 
particular show changes in autonomic function associated with 
age and menopause (84, 123). However, although age impacts 
autonomic function, indices of the Valsalva maneuver, such as 
the Valsalva ratio, vary little or not at all with age (1, 65). If the sex 
differences were primarily due to age, the HR alterations should 
also show large sex differences. However, visual inspection of 
the magnitude of HR differences (Figure 2) relative to the fMRI 
differences (Figures 3–5) shows the cardiovascular responses 
differ only modestly, whereas the fMRI signals vary substantially, 
sometimes in opposite directions. The Valsalva challenge is 
therefore eliciting a similar albeit not equal peripheral response, 
but with substantial differences in neural response. Confirming 
the minimal influence of age, the inclusion of this variable in 
the RMANOVA models did not alter the patterns of difference 
in any model.
limitations
The sample included left-handed, right-handed, and ambidex-
trous subjects; since handedness is associated with variations 
in some autonomic measures, such as QRS-T interval (124) 
and MSNA responses, although not cardiovascular responses 
to hand grip (125, 126), this factor may have confounded the 
findings. Since the handedness distribution was similar between 
sexes, the effect is likely to be one of increasing variability and 
reducing sensitivity to differences (i.e., increase false nega-
tives). Menopausal status menstrual cycle stage and hormonal 
contraceptive use were erroneously not assessed, but the sample 
likely includes pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal women. Since 
menopausal status and stage of the menstrual cycle influence 
many aspects of autonomic function (84, 123), the female 
measures may have been confounded by hormonal influences. 
Such effects would likely increase variability in the female 
group, which would reduce statistical sensitivity; thus, the sex 
differences reported here are unlikely to be false positives. We 
assessed topography distinguished by gyri, which run essentially 
anterior–posterior, but there is likely also functional differentia-
tion across an approximate inferior–superior direction, given the 
cytoarchitectonic gradient in the insula from agranular cortex in 
the (inferior) anterior part to dysgranular cortex in the middle 
part to granular cortex in the posterior part (127–129). However, 
clear topographical distinctions based on MRI scans beyond 
gyri are likely to remain complex, given the heterogeneity of 
this structure (130–132). The short gyri, in particular, are not 
always distinct (16, 48); thus, the classifications ASG, MSG, 
and PSG should be considered to refer to adjacent regions 
that, in some subjects, are not distinguished by a gyral fold. 
Our focus in the present study was gyral-specific patterns, but 
variations in function or vascular responses across hemispheres 
could be assessed using similar models with the addition of 
hemisphere as a factor. Other limitations include the relative 
nature of fMRI signals such that only functional responses can 
be measured, but not baseline activity. Functional responses are

measured as regional blood volume and oxygenation changes, 
which while strongly associated with neuronal activity (133), are 
also influenced by whole-brain cerebral vasculature. However, 
such global effects would not alter the between-gryi and 
lateralization organizational patterns identified in the current 
 
study.
cOnclUsiOn
The insula shows sex differences in the topographic organiza-
tion of functional responses during the sympathetic phase of the 
Valsalva maneuver. The response patterns are consistent with a 
principally inhibitory role for the structure. While the preferen-
tially anterior autonomic function and preferentially righted sided 
sympathetic roles for the insula are shared in males and females, 
females show a smaller magnitude of change in fMRI signals 
than males in insular gyri. The exception is the right anterior-
most gyrus (ASG) in females, which shows lower responses, 
compared with other female right and left anterior gyri, and 
compared with male gyri. The sex differences reflect altered 
baseline state and magnitude of responses and likely contribute 
to sex-related variations in autonomic responsiveness to some 
 
stimuli.
aUThOr nOTe
The mechanism of the tachycardia during the maneuver remains 
controversial, some workers suggesting exclusive enhancement 
of sympathetic activity and others suggesting depression of 
parasympathetic outflow; also, both parasympathetic withdrawal 
and increased sympathetic outflow have been suggested (Bennett 
et al., 1976; Eckberg, 1980). The quantification of heart interval 
variations [P65 (Junqueira, 2002)] impaired autonomic control 
of heart Valsalva.
