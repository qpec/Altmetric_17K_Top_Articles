Abstract
Background
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets have
reinforced the importance of functioning laboratory services to ensure prompt diagnosis
and to assess treatment efficacy. We surveyed the availability and utilization of technolo-
gies for HIV treatment monitoring and early infant diagnosis (EID) in World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) Member States.
Methods and Findings
The survey questionnaire included 14 structured questions focusing on HIV testing, cluster
of differentiation 4 (CD4) testing, HIV viral load (VL) testing, and EID and was administered
annually from 2012 to 2014 through WHO country offices, with each survey covering the
previous 12-mo period. Across 127 targeted countries, survey response rates were 60% in
2012, 67% in 2013, and 78% in 2014. There were encouraging trends towards increased
procurement of CD4 and VL/EID instruments in reporting countries. Globally, the capacity
of available CD4 instruments was sufficient to meet the demand of all people living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), irrespective of treatment status (4.62 theoretical tests per PLWHA in
2013 [median 7.33; interquartile range (IQR) 3.44–17.75; median absolute deviation (MAD)
4.35]). The capacity of VL instruments was inadequate to cover all PLWHA in many report-
ing countries (0.44 tests per PLWHA in 2013 [median 0.90; IQR 0.30–2.40; MAD 0.74]). Of
concern, only 13.7% of existing CD4 capacity (median 4.3%; IQR 1.1%–12.1%; MAD 3.8%)
and only 36.5% of existing VL capacity (median 9.4%; IQR 2.3%–28.9%; MAD 8.2%) was
being utilized across reporting countries in 2013. By the end of 2013, 7.4% of all CD4 instru-
ments (5.8% CD4 conventional instruments and 11.0% of CD4 point of care [POC]) and
10% of VL/EID instruments were reportedly not in use because of lack of reagents, the
equipment not being installed or deployed, maintenance, and staff training requirements.

Conclusion
This is the first attempt to comprehensively gather information on HIV testing technology
coverage in WHO Member States. The survey results suggest that major operational
changes will need to be implemented, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, if
the 90-90-90 targets are to be met.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Global 90-90-90 targets have reinforced the importance of functioning laboratory ser-
vices to ensure prompt diagnosis and to assess treatment efficacy.
• World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the provision of antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART) for people living with HIV emphasize the need to increase access to HIV test-
ing, treatment, and viral load monitoring.
• In order to understand gaps in laboratory capacity to support further ART scale-up,
WHO assesses country capacity to provide HIV diagnosis and treatment monitoring
tests, how efficiently HIV diagnosis and treatment monitoring technologies are utilized,
and the need for scale-up to meet predicted demand.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We obtained data on the availability and utilization of technologies for HIV treatment
monitoring and early infant diagnosis (EID) across 60% of 127 countries surveyed from
2012–2014.
• Globally, the capacity of available CD4 instruments was found to be sufficient to meet
the demand of all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), irrespective of treatment sta-
tus; however, capacity to measure viral load was inadequate to cover needs in most
reporting countries.
• Of concern, only 13.7% of existing CD4 capacity and only 36.5% of existing viral load
(VL) capacity was being utilized across reporting countries in 2013. Lack of reagents,
equipment not being installed or deployed, maintenance, and staff training requirements
were among the reported reasons for underutilization.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Overall, among the countries surveyed, increasing numbers of CD4 and VL/EID instru-
ments are being procured.

 • However, capacity to measure viral load is insufficient to meet current needs, and under-
utilization of CD4 and VL technology is widespread.
• Major improvements in laboratory capacity utilization are needed in low- and middle-
income countries if the 90-90-90 targets are to be met.
Introduction
The ambitious Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 tar-
gets require coordinated action to ensure that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV know
their HIV status, 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV infection receive antiretroviral therapy
(ART), and 90% of those receiving ART achieve durable viral suppression [1]. Currently, an
estimated 16 million people are receiving ART. Rapid ART scale-up has reinforced the impor-
tance of strengthening laboratory services now considered as a critical component of a health
system to increase access to ART and to improve the quality of treatment and care for people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) [2–4]. The 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) guide-
lines [2] recommending that ART is prescribed to all people as soon as possible after a HIV-
positive diagnosis regardless of CD4 cell count imply a significant rise in the number of people
who need to be started and maintained on treatment. Progress towards the 90-90-90 targets
will require a significant expansion of HIV testing to diagnose HIV infection and to monitor
treatment efficacy in a robust tiered laboratory network [5,6].
Expanding access to treatment requires high-quality HIV testing technologies, including
CD4 testing to assess risk of disease progression, viral load (VL) testing to monitor treatment
efficacy, early infant diagnosis (EID) to determine HIV-infection status in HIV-exposed chil-
dren, and other monitoring capabilities within a tiered laboratory network. Technologies that
can be used at point of care (POC) provide an important opportunity to expand access to HIV-
related testing [7,8]. The availability and utilization of HIV EID and treatment monitoring
technologies in many HIV/AIDS endemic countries have not been formally assessed. A
detailed analysis is needed if we are to effectively tackle future challenges to ART scale-up. To
this end, in 2012, WHO started to conduct annual surveys to assess the availability and the uti-
lization of CD4, VL, and EID testing technologies in WHO Member States. Full and detailed
datasets supporting our findings have been provided [9]. We present 3-y survey data and an
assessment of trends of instruments available and tests performed, as well as an analysis of
potential theoretical capacity versus the demand.
Methods
The Survey Tool
An English-language electronic questionnaire survey tool used annually by WHO to assess
ART use in WHO Member States was revised to include 14 structured questions on the avail-
ability, functionality, and utilization of CD4, VL, and EID laboratory technologies and the mar-
ket share for different branded technologies. The questionnaire survey is included as S1 Survey
Questionnaire.
The 2012 survey covers 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011, the 2013 survey covers 1 Janu-
ary 2012 to 31 December 2012, and the 2014 survey covers 1 January 2013 to 31 December
2013. Throughout this article, data from the 2012 survey will be referred to as 2011 data, data
from the 2013 survey as 2012 data, and data from the 2014 survey as 2013 data.

 Data Collection
Questionnaires were distributed via WHO regional offices to WHO country HIV officers sup-
porting Ministry of Health HIV programme managers, who used data from their national
annual reports to complete the survey within 4 mo (April–July of each survey year). Data col-
lection was focused on the public health sector, which includes ministry of health and various
nongovernmental organization (NGO) HIV programmes. The study did not cover the private
sector. Unlike NGOs, the private sector does not report data to the national HIV programme.
Questionnaires were returned by email to WHO’s Department of HIV/AIDS for data cleaning,
verification, and analysis.
Surveys were sent to 127 countries, distributed as follows by WHO region:
• all 47 countries in the WHO African Region (AFRO);
• 33 countries in the WHO Region of the Americas (AMRO; Latin America and Caribbean
countries: all countries from the Region of the Americas except the United States of America
and Canada);
• all 21 countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO);
• 8 high-burden HIV countries in the WHO European Region (EURO);
• all 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEARO);
• 7 high-burden HIV countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPRO).
The completed questionnaires were jointly collected by WHO country offices, the six WHO
regional offices (WHO Regional Office for Africa, Brazzaville; WHO Regional Office for the
Americas, Washington; WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, Cairo; WHO
Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen; WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia, New Delhi;
and WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, Manila) and WHO headquarters, Geneva.
Data Analysis
For the analysis of deployment of existing HIV EID and monitoring technologies, additional
data were used. Specifically, numbers of PLWHA were retrieved from the UNAIDS AIDSinfo
Online Database [10]. The midestimate of the number of PLWHA was used for the analysis.
When data on PLWHA were unavailable from the above source, information was extracted
from the latest country report available on the UNAIDS website [11]. If the country report pro-
vided the number of PLWHA only for 1 y of interest, that number was used for all 3 reporting
years. If the country report provided only the number of diagnosed HIV patients, that number
was rounded up to the next 100. Data on the number of PLWHA on ART were provided by
responding countries. Testing technologies were categorized as conventional or POC according
to definitions applied by the manufacturer.
The lowest published theoretical number of tests that an instrument can perform per techni-
cian per day was used to calculate theoretical capacity of CD4 and VL instruments in all coun-
tries responding to at least one survey [12–15]. Capacity analyses were based on the
assumption that personnel work an average of 8 h per d, 250 d per y. The internationally
accepted number of work days (260) was reduced in consideration of national holidays. The
average number of national holidays was calculated for a subset of 18 countries and applied to
all countries participating in these surveys [16].
Statistical analysis was performed in XLSTAT statistical application for Microsoft Excel
(Addinsoft). Data visualization was done using Tableau software (Tableau Software). The p-
values for the analysis of trends in instrument market share, nonutilization, and maintenance

 contracting and servicing were calculated using a chi-square test. In the case of rejection of the
null hypothesis of multiple proportions equality, the chi-square test was followed by the Maras-
cuilo procedure employed to simultaneously test all possible pairs of proportions and to iden-
tify the proportion(s) responsible for the rejection of the null hypothesis. A p-value of <0.05
was considered significant.
Results
Survey Response Rate
Survey response rates, based on 127 targeted countries, were 60% (76 countries) in 2012, 67%
(85 countries) in 2013, and 78% (99 countries) in 2014 (countries that responded to at least
one diagnostic survey question). Over the 3 survey years, 55 (43%) countries responded to all
three surveys, 35 (28%) countries to two surveys, 25 (20%) countries to one survey, and 9 (7%)
responded to none of the three surveys. As each survey covers the previous 12-mo period, the
results refer successively to year 2011, 2012, and 2013.
Availability and Use of CD4 Instruments
Reporting countries have accumulated CD4-testing capacity sufficient to meet WHO recom-
mendation to perform CD4 tests upon HIV diagnosis and every 6 to 12 mo thereafter. CD4
testing is not necessary for a stabilized patient on ART with suppressed VL, if VL testing is
available (Table 1) [5,6].
Across 40 countries reporting CD4 instrument data for 3 consecutive y, the number of CD4
instruments has risen every year between 2011 and 2013, mostly due to the procurement of
CD4 instruments for use at POC, which rose from the previous year by 36% in 2012 and by
53% in 2013. Growth for conventional CD4 instruments, however, was only 11% in 2012 and
4% in 2013 in countries responding to all three surveys (Fig 1). As a result, the theoretical
capacity of CD4 conventional and POC instruments increased from 66.3 million tests in 2011
to 90.6 million tests in 2013, which equates to a theoretical CD4 testing capacity of 4.59
(median 5.21; IQR 3.07–9.57; median absolute deviation [MAD] 2.56) tests per PLWHA in
2011, 5.17 (median 6.71; IQR 4.10–11.64; MAD 3.31) tests in 2012, and 6.25 (median 7.27; IQR
3.51–11.32; MAD 3.83) tests in 2013 (Fig 2).
Three conventional CD4 instruments, BD FACSCount, CyFlow Counter, and BD FACSCa-
libur, and only one POC instrument, Alere Pima Analyser, have dominated the CD4 technol-
ogy market for 3 consecutive y (Table 2). In 2011, 2012, and 2013, 74%, 77%, and 72% of
reporting countries utilized WHO prequalified (WHO PQ) CD4 technologies (X2 [2; 214] =
0.5, p = 0.771, effect size [ES] Cramer’s V = 0.03).
All countries with CD4 instruments and with information on number of PLWHA were ana-
lysed and the theoretical capacity per PLWHA was measured: there were 66, 71, and 68 coun-
tries with data available for number of CD4 instruments and number of PLWHA, respectively
in 2011, 2012, and 2013. CD4 capacity was sufficient to cover CD4 testing demand in respond-
ing countries, with theoretical CD4 capacity across 68 reporting countries in 2013 of 4.62 tests
per PLWHA (median 7.33; IQR 3.44–17.75; MAD 4.35) (Fig 3).
All countries that reported the number of CD4 tests performed and the number of CD4
instruments were analysed to calculate the utilization rate of the available theoretical CD4
capacity. CD4 instruments were considerably underutilized, with only 7.1%, 7.7%, and 13.7%
of existing CD4 capacity utilized across 51, 45, and 50 countries reporting data on the number
of tests done and the number of CD4 instruments in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively (X2 [2;
186,171,250] = 2,062,586, p < 0.001, ES Cramer’s V = 0.07) (median utilization 3.6% [IQR
0.8%–8.0%; MAD 3.1%] in 2011; 5.9% (IQR 2.6%–12.9%; MAD 4.6%) in 2012; and 4.3% [IQR

 1.1%–12.1%; MAD 3.8%] in 2013) (Fig 4). The instrument utilization rate was calculated by
dividing the total number of CD4 tests performed by the theoretical CD4 capacity (theoretical
number of CD4 tests) for all reporting countries. Suboptimal numbers of CD4 tests were per-
formed per patient on ART per year: on average, 1.44 across 44 countries in 2011 (median
1.25; IQR 0.65–2.07; MAD 0.62), 1.32 across 50 countries in 2012 (median 1.70; IQR 1.13–
2.47; MAD 0.72); and 1.41 across 46 countries in 2013 (median 1.54; IQR 0.89–2.26; MAD
0.71). In 2013, 14 (30.4%) countries performed <1 CD4 test per PLWHA on ART, which falls
short of current recommendations.

 The surveys highlighted major issues concerning the functionality and use of CD4 instru-
ments. Thirty-seven (53.6%), 33 (44.6%), and 35 (49.3%) countries reported CD4 conventional
and/or POC instruments not in use in 2011, 2012, 2013, respectively (X2 [2; 214] = 1.2,
p = 0.558, ES Cramer’s V = 0.05). In 2013, 455 (7.4%) of all CD4 instruments reported by
responding countries were not utilized. The percentage of reported instruments that were cur-
rently not being used was significantly higher for CD4 POC than for conventional systems in
2011 (18.2% versus 8.3%; X2 [1; 3,785] = 62.3, p < 0.001, ES phi = 0.13) and 2013 (11.0% versus
5.8%; X2 [1; 6,123] = 51.1, p < 0.001, ES phi = 0.09) but lower in 2012 (2.7% versus 5.1%; X2 [1;
4,428] = 10.2, p = 0.001, ES phi = 0.05), although the ES was negligible in 2012 and 2013 (Fig
5). Key reasons for nonutilization included breakdown for CD4 conventional instruments and
lack of reagents for POC CD4 instruments (Fig 6). A number of instruments were reported to
be in country but not yet installed, possibly because of lack of technical support, training, and/
or reagents, as well as shortages of personnel and lack of deployment planning for newly pro-
cured instruments.
While nonutilization of CD4 conventional instruments due to breakdown slightly declined
from 2011 to 2013 (X2 [2; 10,672] = 11.1, p = 0.004, ES Cramer’s V = 0.02), and nonutilization
due to lack of reagents remained mostly unchanged during the same period (X2 [2; 10,672] =

 1.9, p = 0.386, ES Cramer’s V = 0.01), the situation for POC CD4 instruments worsened from
2011, with breakdown and lack of reagents being the key reasons reported for nonutilization in
2013 (breakdown, X2 [2; 3,664] = 50.7, p < 0.001, ES Cramer’s V = 0.08; lack of reagents, X2 [2;
3,664] = 41.8, p < 0.001, ES Cramer’s V = 0.07).
Less than 50% of conventional CD4 instruments were covered with maintenance contracts
across all 3 survey years; however, there was an increase in the percentage of instruments
reported to be under contract in 2012 and 2013 from 2011 (X2 [2; 10,672] = 71.4, p < 0.001, ES
Cramer’s V = 0.06) (Fig 7). The proportion of POC CD4 instruments with maintenance con-
tracts dropped significantly from 55% in 2011 to 5% coverage in 2013 (X2 [2; 3,664] = 953.3,
p < 0.001, ES Cramer’s V = 0.36). The underlying reasons were not investigated; however, the
two potential explanations are previously existing maintenance contracts not renewed after
expiry and purchasing of more instruments without maintenance contracts. Servicing levels
were also low and declined significantly between 2012 and 2013 (conventional CD4, X2 [1;
7,597] = 174.6, p < 0.001, ES phi = 0.15; POC CD4, X2 [1; 2,954] = 629.3, p < 0.001, ES

were serviced in 2013 (Fig 7).
Availability and Use of VL/EID Technology
WHO recommends, in line with the 90-90-90 targets, to perform VL testing 6 mo and 12 mo
after ARV treatment initiation and annually thereafter if the patient is stable on ART and to
perform at least two EID tests per HIV-exposed infant, including tests at birth, at 6 wk, confir-
matory tests, and tests at 9 mo in some countries [5,6]. Data show that countries continue to
expand quantitative/qualitative (VL/EID) nucleic acid testing (NAT) capacity to meet WHO
recommendations (Table 3).
Based on our analysis of 38 countries that reported across all survey years on this survey
question, NAT capacity increased by 24.4% between 2011 and 2013 (to 9.7 million tests in
2013 from 7.8 million tests in 2011). Abbott m2000, COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (48
or 96), COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer, and NucliSENS EasyQ were the most common

respectively. The lower panel shows the CD4 capacity per PLWHA.

 instruments on the market, with Abbott m2000 and COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (48
or 96) expanding their market presence between 2011 and 2013 (Table 4). The survey reveals
that technologies that can be used at POC for nucleic acid (VL/EID) testing are not yet being
used in reporting countries.
VL instrument capacity is sufficient to cover PLWHA currently on ART but not adequate
to cover all PLWHA (Fig 8). The theoretical VL capacity per patient on ART per year was on
average 2.10 tests in 2011 (median capacity per patient on ART 5.14; IQR 1.27–17.31; MAD
4.16); 2.20 tests in 2012 (median 4.63; IQR 1.45–11.47; MAD 3.83); and 1.23 tests in 2013
(median 3.59; IQR 0.81–9.12; MAD 2.96) (Fig 8), suggesting that current theoretical VL capac-
ity covers the current needs of PLWHA on ART. Yet, country specific analysis of theoretical
VL capacity available revealed that in 2013, 28% of reporting countries did not have adequate
VL capacity to perform �1 VL test per patient on ART (the theoretical need if all HIV-positive
individuals were put on treatment, consistent with the latest WHO recommendations).

 Theoretical VL capacity per PLWHA (including those who are not on ART) was even lower,
reaching only 0.52 tests per y in 2011 (median 0.84; IQR 0.27–2.53; MAD 0.71); 0.65 tests per y
in 2012 (median 1.28; IQR 0.35–3.50; MAD 0.99); and 0.44 tests in 2013 (median 0.90; IQR
0.30–2.40; MAD 0.74) (Fig 8). Fifty-four percent of reporting countries did not have the capac-
ity to perform �1 VL test per PLWHA per y.
In addition, utilization of instruments was low, although increasing, throughout the report-
ing years. Only 13.7% of theoretical capacity was reportedly being used in 2011 (median 7.5%;
IQR 2.6%–23.9%; MAD 6.0%); 16.9% (median 11.5%; IQR 2.2%–32.5%; MAD 9.8%) in 2012;
and 36.5% (median 9.4%; IQR 2.3%–28.9%; MAD 8.2%) in 2013 (X2 [2; 29,633,750] = 1,722,577,
p < 0.001, ES Cramer’s V = 0.17) (Fig 9). Only 25% of 33 reporting countries performed �1 VL
test per patient on ART in 2013.
Encouragingly, our data show that across 33, 44, and 51 reporting countries, the number of
EID tests performed per infant born to an HIV-positive mother was 1.17 (median 1.10; IQR
1.00–1.91; MAD 0.14) in 2011, 1.43 (median 1.32; IQR 1.01–2.14; MAD 0.32) in 2012, and
1.15 (median 1.20; IQR 1.00–1.94; MAD 0.20) in 2013, suggesting high coverage of EID testing,

 including confirmatory testing (Fig 10). In 2013, only 3 countries reported less than 1 EID test
per infant born to an HIV-positive mother.
As with survey findings for CD4 instrumentation, the surveys highlighted major issues con-
cerning the functionality and use of VL instruments. Twenty-one (35.6%), 22 (34.4%), and 23
(38.3%) countries reported 12%, 14%, and 10% of all VL/EID instruments nonutilized in 2011,
2012, and 2013, respectively (reporting countries, X2 [2; 183] = 0.2, p = 0.896, ES Cramer’s
V = 0.02; nonutilized instruments, X2 [2; 2,119] = 7.7, p = 0.022; the difference between 2011
and 2012 and between 2011 and 2013 was not statistically significant, ES Cramer’s V = 0.04).
Nonutilization was mostly due to noninstallation and a lack of reagents, with no improvements
noted over the 3 survey years (noninstallation, X2 [2; 2,119] = 0.02, p = 0.993, ES Cramer’s
V = 0.002; lack of reagents, X2 [2; 2,119] = 5.5, p = 0.065, ES Cramer’s V = 0.04; Fig 11). The
number of instruments with maintenance contracts was below 50% across all 3 survey years—
increasing from 21% in 2011 to 49% in 2012 and then declining to 38% in 2013 (X2 [2; 2,119] =
105.8, p < 0.001, ES Cramer’s V = 0.16). Servicing levels were also low, with 47% of all instru-
ments reportedly serviced in 2012 and 31% in 2013 (X2 [1; 1,557] = 44.7, p < 0.001, ES
phi = 0.17). No instruments were reported to be serviced in 2011, which may be attributed to a
lack of corresponding data at the country level.
Discussion
Survey results across 3 y demonstrate a trend of increasing numbers of CD4 and VL/EID
instruments procured in responding countries. Increasing instrument numbers suggest the
expansion of services, particularly at the lower levels of the testing network.
Our data show that for CD4, the number of instruments present in countries is sufficient to
meet current demand for not only patients on ART but all PLWHA in the countries surveyed.
For VL, data show that while responding countries can theoretically meet demand for testing
of PLWHA on ART, current instrument capacity is not yet sufficient to cover all PLWHA: over
half (54%) of the responding countries did not have the theoretical VL capacity to perform �1
VL test per PLWHA in 2013. These data highlight a lack of capacity in many reporting

 countries to implement new WHO recommendations [2] on VL testing for treatment monitor-
ing and the need for continued support if new goals are to be achieved.
Despite the fact that many countries have instruments in place and the theoretical capacity
to respond to testing needs, our analysis indicates widespread underutilization of CD4 and VL
technology. Only 13.7% of existing CD4 capacity was utilized in 2013, with 30.4% of countries
performing less than 1 CD4 test per patient on ART per y, which falls short of current recom-
mendations. For VL technology, only 36.5% of theoretical capacity was utilized across report-
ing countries (median 9.4%; IQR 2.3%–28.9%; MAD 9.8%) in 2013. The stark contrast
between available instrument capacity and instrument utilization can be partly explained by
the substantial number of machines reported as nonutilized each survey year because of break-
downs, stock outs of reagents, lack of installation, or other reasons (e.g., 7.4% of all CD4 instru-
ments and 10% of VL/EID were not in use by the end of 2013). Another contributing factor,
not assessed in these surveys, may be inadequate geographic distribution of CD4 and VL
instruments, which may be deployed in low-volume sites, resulting in underutilization of tech-
nology. The theoretical capacity should help programme managers and funding agencies to

 plan and deploy instruments based on their capacity and the volume of tests expected to be
done in the laboratory facility. Programme managers and funding partners should not expect
100% capacity utilization: nonetheless, efficient use of available equipment and those to be pro-
cured should remain a goal for the national programme managers. Of additional concern are
data showing extremely low coverage of instruments with maintenance contracts and infre-
quent or total absence of servicing for in situ instruments (below 50% for all machines reported
across responding countries).
There is a need to assess and address the root causes of instrument underutilization. Lack of
reagents, uninstalled and underutilized equipment, maintenance requirements, and staff train-
ing are issues that national programme managers and policy makers can and must address.
Many of the commonly observed equipment challenges can be addressed and prevented from
recurring with site selection and deployment planning that includes timely training and
retraining, staff proficiency testing, supply chain strengthening, and enforceable maintenance
and servicing contracts. Countries could also explore using equipment lease or reagent rental

 contracts in which the company provides the machine and the country pays for the reagents.
With this scheme, diagnostic companies replace or timely repair a nonfunctioning machine
and timely supply reagents as agreed in the contract to ensure that the laboratory activities are
not interrupted.
Our findings support the need to strengthen diagnostic capacity in reporting countries
[17,18]. Recent data from Médecins Sans Frontières have shown financial constraints as a key
reason for incomplete or slow implementation of VL testing [19,20]. Many countries still face
numerous implementation and funding shortfalls that make it difficult to put the new WHO
guidelines into practice [19,20].
Decentralization of HIV care, in some of the hardest hit countries, will remain difficult
unless POC technologies meeting WHO prequalification requirements become available and
can be deployed for use in peripheral, low-volume treatment centres [21]. Several POC CD4,
POC VL, and POC EID technologies are expected to be available in early 2016 [22,23].

 However, POC will not solve all the shortfalls raised by our survey, although it may circumvent
the need for trained laboratory specialists at the lower levels of the tiered health system.
Regardless of the need for POC, it is clear that laboratory-based monitoring will remain a key
component of HIV programmes now and in the future [19,20,24]. While we await new POC
VL and POC EID technologies, strengthening of the transport systems that facilitate specimen
collection from remote ART facilities (e.g., dried blood spot specimens for EID) must remain a
focus.
This is the first attempt to comprehensively gather information on HIV testing and moni-
toring technology in WHO Member States, with the goal to inform programme managers and
funding partners in their effort to increase access to HIV monitoring technologies. Caution
needs to be taken when using the results of these surveys because of under-reporting in some
national programmes and the potential for reported information to be incomplete. Neverthe-
less, the response rate had increased by 2013, mitigating responder bias and suggesting a wel-
come increase in interest in HIV diagnostics. Another important limitation to note is that the
survey findings were limited to the public sector. In some countries, the private sector makes
an important contribution to HIV treatment and care, and associated diagnostic testing and
monitoring will not be reflected in these survey findings. The next step will be to provide guid-
ance and institute data quality control procedures to ensure that comprehensive, validated
datasets are available on a yearly basis in order to reduce some of the limitations and inconsis-
tencies that arise when comparing large datasets across multiple countries. WHO will continue
to evaluate the market share and performance of laboratory technologies through these annual
surveys. Finally, future analyses should consider other potential explanations for variability in

 laboratory capacity, including level of economic development, donor assistance, and preva-
lence of HIV and other infections requiring similar laboratory diagnostic approaches, such as
viral hepatitis.
Despite significant progress in ART scale-up, which has enabled 16 million people to receive
treatment, meeting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets depends heavily on the commitment and
capacity of governments and international partners to improve access to high-quality testing for
EID and treatment monitoring. With laboratory systems in reporting countries expanding, a
national laboratory strategic plan to strengthen services must be developed, implemented, and
monitored by governments and their national and international partners. The focus of interna-
tional community, to ensure optimal use of laboratory technologies, should be on those countries
where interventions for scaling up access to HIV diagnostic technologies are most needed.
