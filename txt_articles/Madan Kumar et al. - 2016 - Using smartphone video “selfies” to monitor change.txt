Abstract
Background—Attempts to refine toothbrushing (TB) technique, an ingrained habit in adults, can 
meet with some challenges. Recently, the role of proactive interference as a barrier to improving 
the learning of proper brushing has been proposed. This pilot feasibility study was designed to 
investigate TB behavior and to see how it changes after training. Smartphone video “selfies” 
(SPVSs) are increasingly being used in the medical field to assess, monitor, and determine the 
progression of diseases.
Materials and Methods—We used SPVS to study TB skills in a small sample of volunteers. 
Over a period of 14 days, after a one-time group training session, we observed TB behavior of 
volunteers using self-captured SPVS.
Results—Following the brief intervention, we observed an 8% of improvement in TB skills.
Discussion—To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report using SPVS to study TB 
behavior. We demonstrated initial feasibility of using SPVS in the dental setting. We observed 
modest improvements in toothbrushing accuracy and quality, and we generated important 
experiences about the use of Selfies for TB monitoring and intervention, and some interesting 
insights about where in the toothbrushing is more or less effective.
Conclusion—Further investigation using a larger sample size is needed to thoroughly assess the 
effectiveness of this approach to improve TB skills and better understand the role of proactive 
interference.

Oral health is an integral part of general well-being.[1] Proper maintenance of oral health 
may help to avert preventable oral diseases such as dental caries and periodontal diseases. 
Toothbrushing (TB) is the most widely used method of oral hygiene.[2] Proper TB can 
drastically reduce the risk for oral diseases although this depends on the effectiveness of the 
TB technique that is used.[3] At present, consensus has not yet been achieved on the optimal, 
psychological approach for encouraging proper TB; however, new concepts and models for 
health theory behavior-based interventions have begun to emerge.[4] The process and 
mechanisms of TB habit formation have been previously described, and to varying degrees, 
intervention approaches have been based on these foundations.[2] For example, it has been 
pointed out that both a neurocognitive approach and an effective psychological approach are 
needed for complete integration and regular practice of TB.[5] In a recent study examining 
the adoption of proper TB technique while being video-recorded through a mirror, a 
significant number of participants did not fully integrate proper TB into their regular routine 
in spite of having seemingly sufficient motivation, skill, and desire.[5] Recently, we 
described a coaching approach encouraging proper TB that was informed by the 
Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model proposed by Fisher et al., 2009,[6] 
and other important health theories such as motivational interviewing (MI) by Miller and 
Rollnick, 2012,[7] and integrative health coaching as described by Simmons and Wolever, 
2013.[8] IMB is a recent conceptual framework that helps promote individual level health-
related behavior change. In the context of oral health, the IMB model theorizes that 
participants are more likely to undertake health-promoting behaviors when they are aware of 
relevant information regarding an existing or potential oral disease state, when they are 
sufficiently and personally motivated to take corrective action, and when they are fully aware 
of the precise behavioral skills that are required (as well as strategies to follow if there are 
barriers to completing the desired behaviors).[6,9] Further, integration of a behavior change 
approach informed by the IBM model, MI, and integrative health coaching, as described by 
Vernon and Howard, 2015, stresses the importance of promoting internal motivation and 
enhancing the participant’s self-efficacy to adopt and maintain proper oral hygiene self-care.
[10] Ideally, the resultant change in behavior and motor skills will manifest as proper oral 
hygiene maintenance, that is, a newly formed TB habit. However, in spite of one’s best 
efforts, a significant percentage of patient’s may relapse back into their old and improper TB 
habits.[11,12] Recently, researchers have speculated that proactive interference (when 
learning a new behavior is impeded by interference of knowledge and habits tied to an old 
behavior) may have an important influence in reverting to improper, old TB habits.[12] 
Adopting a more effective TB technique can be challenging; this is especially true when TB 
has been practiced for a number of years without proper supervision, guidance, and 
reinforcement. On an individual level, for a proper TB skills to be adopted, there are a 
number of separate steps or components-for example, the process of memory formation, 
coding, retrieval, contextual cueing, association, “muscle memory”, addressing interferences 
besides sufficient motor skill, and one’s desire to change the old TB habit.[13] It is 
interesting to note however that, currently, there is no single, universally recommended,

 proper TB technique that has been shown to be successful in all situations; thus, only 
tailored approaches have been shown to be successful.[13] Smartphones have permeated 
almost all walks of human life in the 21st century and have been recently used for early 
diagnosis and prognosis of disorders such as Parkinson disease.[14] This trend, of using 
mobile technology, has been characterized as a new modality for scientific inquiry and is 
frequently referred to as mHealth.[15] With advancing mobile phone technology and 
innovations, experts in participatory medicine and patient-generated health data postulate 
that with easier interfaces, increasing smartphone use (by more people) and the availability 
of high-speed internet connectivity (of sufficient quality and with access to high percentage 
of the population) would allow patients to monitor themselves via photography, video, and 
other means, either on their own or in conjunction with the clinician.[16] In the dental setting, 
use of this technology could help shift the focus from treating a condition such as 
periodontal disease to preventing such oral conditions and promoting more optimal oral 
health.
The use of self-photography or “selfies” using smartphone-based technology is now widely 
popular. Further, the specific use of smartphone video “selfies” (SPVSs) is also growing in 
popularity; in the near future, this practice may provide a venue by which patients can 
receive timely health care.[17] On-site video recordings of TB have been shown to be an 
effective method to educate and motivate participants to refine, enhance, and maintain the 
refined TB habits.[18,19] Currently, to the best of our knowledge, using dental SPVS to 
promote proper TB behavior has not been previously described. In this pilot feasibility study, 
we explore the use SPVS to assess TB skill before and after a brief intervention and note any 
trends that may be consistent with proactive interference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a small prospective, interventional pilot feasibility study. After baseline measures 
had been collected (including the on-site, baseline SPVS), there was a brief intervention 
after which four more SPVSs (for a total of 5) were self-recorded in their own home by 
participants at 24 h and 48 h on the 7th day and 14th day. Our intention was to explore the 
extent to which participants would adopt an improved TB technique and to inform an 
intervention and research design for large-scale studies.
The study was composed of four volunteers who were dental residents completing their 
internship period (final 5th year of supervised clinical training prior to degree certification 
after successful completion of 4 years of dental course work). The study was approved by 
the Ragas Dental College and Hospital’s Institutional Review Board and written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants. Study participation was voluntary and there were 
no financial or other or incentives except that a mobile phone stand worth INR 100 (about 
US $1.50) was given to each participant. This mobile phone stand was intended to help 
standardize SPVS data collection and to keep the phone safe during the video-acquiring 
process. The study participants were chosen based on a brief, informal interview involving 
assessment of their willingness to cooperate with a study regarding their TB behavior. The 
inclusion criteria were high level of motivation (≥8 on the motivational scale of 0 to 10),[20] 
low oral hygiene index-simplified (OHI-S) score (<0.6),[21] and willingness to comply with

 the study protocol as well as owning or having access to a mobile smartphone with a 
reasonable field of vision and memory space, with a front camera of minimum 3 MP 
resolution. The exclusion criteria were those with poor motivation (≤7),[20] a subjective 
assessment by the interviewer as having of a potential for noncompliance to study protocol/
procedures including poor ability to handle smartphone videography correctly, high OHI-S 
score (>0.6),[21] those under current orthodontic appliance therapy, the presence of 
overhanging fillings, and those who had periodontal interventions or had undergone oral 
hygiene instructions within the past 6 months. Further, persons with poor oral hygiene were 
also excluded from the study so that they could receive timely and proper oral health care.
The study protocol was as follows. At baseline and prior to the brief intervention, the OHI-S 
score was assessed as a combined score of the coronal extent of soft debris index-simplified 
(DI-S) and the calculus index-simplified (CI-S) was performed on 6 index teeth surfaces.[21] 
We collected scores of two submeasures (DI-S and CI-S) (which could range between 0 and 
3, thus, an overall score of 0–6 was possible)[21] and the participant’s level of motivation to 
improve TB skills (assessed using a Likert scale of 0–10, with “0” indicating no motivation 
and 10 referring to the highest level of motivation). The participants were uniformly trained 
to demonstrate competence video recording themselves while brushing their teeth using their 
own cell phones to record an SPVS. During video-capture training, emphasis was on placed 
using front-facing camera view to correctly record the mouth with the hand, brush, and 
bristles in the field of view. Volunteers were asked to use their regular toothbrush and 
toothpaste. Training was provided to video shoot the “dental-selfie” (or SPVS) of brushing 
without divulging the entire face or eyes or any personally identifying marker. Therefore, the 
resultant SPVS recorded the process of TB while focusing on the mouth with maximum 
attention to the participant’s hand and TB angulations. Thus, participants were asked to 
record their regular and entire TB behavior prior to the brief TB intervention, which served 
as the baseline SPVS recording.
For this study, the widely recommended modified Bass technique[22] was used in the brief 
intervention training as the standard for “proper” TB technique. Each baseline SPVS, taken 
prior to the brief TB intervention, was reviewed by an experienced oral health-care giver 
(PDMK) and individually, the participant’s procedural errors were pointed out and the 
correct procedure was demonstrated. Next, individually, each participant was asked to repeat 
the TB procedure. Then, errors in the modified Bass technique were specifically pointed out 
and iterative corrections were made until volunteers were able to demonstrate the proper TB 
technique.
No further reminders, instructions, or feedbacks were given to the participants. All 
participants were asked by the research team not to deliver oral hygiene instructions to any 
of their patients during the 14-day study period. The participants were asked not to view any 
of their SPVSs after they were recorded. After recording an on-site, baseline SPVS of TB, 
participants recorded (at their own home) their brushing at the end of 24 h, 48 h, day 7, and 
day 14. For each participant, 5 (1 baseline and 4 subsequent recordings) SPVSs were 
analyzed. At the end of the day 14, participants’ level of motivation and OHI-S scores were 
collected again as previously described (given above). The participant’s brushing method 
was not checked or reviewed during the study period. At the end of the study, on-site authors

 (PDMK, TR) reviewed each video separately. TB skills were assessed for quality and 
accuracy as described below. Prior to the start of the study, the authors had agreed upon the 
assessment criteria (given below). Accordingly, data were collected from each SPVS. 
Authors (PDMK, TR) performed their assessment separately; any discordance between 
raters triggered a review of the video by both raters and was discussed until consensus was 
reached. The mean score of both raters was taken as the final value. We present separate 
assessments of changes across time in TB quality and accuracy informed by earlier works of 
Poche et al., 1982, and Rachel, 2012.[23,24] Finally, for each video, the length of time spent 
on TB was measured and recorded in seconds.
Assessment of toothbrushing quality
We assessed six sextants of teeth (three per maxillary and mandibular arch) consisting of 
right posterior teeth [premolars and molars–universal tooth number 1–5; 28–32], anterior 
teeth [incisors and canines–universal tooth number 6–11, 22–27], left posterior teeth 
[premolars and molars, tooth 12–16; 17–21] each with the buccal and lingual sides 
considered separately, for a total of 12 sections of teeth. The total of each complete TB 
stroke (to and fro motion) in each of the 12 sections was counted and recorded. If the 
participant performed the majority of strokes in a correct, prescribed rhythmic manner, they 
were given a score of “1” in each section. If not, a score of “0” was given in each section. 
Similarly, the maintenance of the proper 45° angle of the toothbrush bristles to the surface of 
the teeth at the cervical margin of teeth at the start of the stroke-if done correctly, a score of 
“1” was given in each of the 12 sections, whereas incorrect angulation was given a score of 
“0” in each of 12 sections. If there was uncertainty with a given rating, the video was paused 
and re-reviewed. Single screenshots were obtained and saved as a JPEG image and were 
then checked by drawing a line to calculate the exact angle between toothbrush bristle and 
surface of teeth as captured on serial digital images using Microsoft paint program 
(Microsoft Windows 7.0 office Edition, 2012) (digital assessments were performed by TR). 
A final decision was arrived upon by consensus of the two raters. Similarly, the correct brush 
handling position-i.e., hand position, wrist position, and delivery of the brushing movement-
if it was as per the recommended technique, a score of “1” was given and if not, a score of 
“0” was given-again, in each of 12 sections. Hence, in all 12 sections of teeth, each of three 
parameters (correct stroke/TB angulation/positioning of brush) totaled a maximum score of 
36 (i.e., 12 × 3 = 36) points. The cumulative score converted to an overall average score by 
dividing by 12 (i.e. 6 sextants involving two surfaces-buccal and lingual = 12) to yield an 
overall score that could range from 0 to 3. Hence, the score “3” implies that the participant 
has performed the brushing correctly as per the criteria in all sextants and surfaces in terms 
of the three parameters (correct stroke/ angulations/positioning of brush) while a score of 
“0” implies that participant has not correctly brushed in all sextants and surfaces as per the 
three parameters.
Assessment of toothbrushing accuracy
In this assessment, the total number of strokes in each of 12 sections of teeth was counted. 
The numbers of correct application strokes, the number of times the toothbrush bristles that 
were held in the prescribed 45° angulation against the tooth and correct positioning of the

 arm (parallel to the floor) were also counted. These values were expressed as percent of the 
number of correct strokes for that section of teeth using the below formula:
Percent of correct strokes = Number of correct strokes
Total number of strokes × 100
Percent of correct angulations =
Number of correct angulations
Total number of angulations counted × 100
Percent of correct brush positions =
Number of correct brush positions
Total number of brush position attempts × 100
The overall accuracy of TB skills for the particular section of teeth was the mean of the 
percent of correct strokes, percent of correct angulations of the brush, and percent of correct 
brush positions. The overall accuracy of the participant was; the mean of the 12 sections.
Accuracy of toothbrushing in 1 section = Percent of correct strokes+Percent of correct angulations + Percent of correct brush position

Accuracy of toothbrushing
= Sum of accuracy of all 12 sections

In this calculation, if, in a sections of teeth (per sextant within the buccal and lingual 
surfaces), only one stroke is performed and is as per our training recommendations, then the 
value would be computed as 100% correct; thus, a potential limitation of this method is that 
can introduce an artificial bias into the results. In anticipation of this limitation and to 
mitigate it, the assessment measures of TB quality and total length of time spent on TB were 
also incorporated into the study. Hence, the results are best interpreted by considering both 
the assessment of TB quality and TB accuracy rather than either measure in isolation.
Analytical approach
All the data were entered and analyzed in Statistical Package for Social Services (SPSS, 
IBM, IL, USA), version 20.0 or R Statistical Software, version 3.2.4 (Open source software, 
www.r-project.org, The R Foundation). Descriptive statistics are presented and discussed. A 
one-way ANOVA for ranks (nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test) was employed to assess the 
difference between the above-described outcome parameters during the study intervals 
employing a P ≤ 0.05 for evaluation of significant difference.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
A total of six volunteers were interviewed, of which four volunteers (dental student interns) 
entered and completed the study. Each of four volunteers completed all five SPVSs; a total 
of twenty SPVSs were included in the analyses. Participants’ mean age was 21.25 ± 0.5 
years. There were three males and one female in this pilot, feasibility study. The mean OHI-
S was calculated as 0.475 ± 0.15. The CI-S was “0” in all the dental interns and accumulated 
dental plaque/debris contributed to the score. At the end of the study, the mean OHI-S was 
0.425 ± 0.2. At baseline, the self-declared mean motivational score was 8.5 ± 0.58 while at 
the end of the study, it was 9 ± 0.57.

 The investigator’s descriptive summary of the training phase
All participants were right-handed and used the right hand for brushing. At baseline (prior to 
training), several surfaces within sextants within were not being brushed - notably the 
lingual surface of maxillary and mandibular anterior segment and the palatal aspect of the 
right maxillary posterior segment. After our brief training, this lack of attention was rectified 
at all study time points even at the 24 h period. However, the number and direction of 
brushing strokes (as recommended by the modified Bass technique for that particular 
sextant), the angulation at which the brush should be held against the tooth surface (as 
recommended when using the modified Bass technique), and brush position were not in 
compliance with the prescribe technique and were not adequate to be rated as a full score. 
This lack of adopting the prescribed technique persisted till the end of the study. Again, after 
the intervention, all four participants had TB strokes that covered all their tooth surfaces. 
However, much of the variability in TB was limited to buccal/facial surfaces as compared to 
the lingual/palatal surfaces and more coverage was given to cervical areas of the posterior 
tooth. Hence, remnants of “hot spots”[19] (i.e., areas where TB was not adequately 
performed) persisted. Further, in spite of requesting that participants should brush for a full 2 
min, the length of time spent on TB at baseline appeared to persist relatively unchanged 
from baseline to the end of the study (mean time at baseline was 70 ± 19.4 s and at the end 
of the 14th day was 54.3 ± 11.6 s). Thus, even after our brief intervention, participants still 
continued brushing their teeth the same (habitual) length of time during the study.
Toothbrushing quality and accuracy results
The quality and accuracy scores regarding the effectiveness of TB over the time period of 
the study are depicted in Tables 1–3 and Figure 1. Evaluation of mean differences over 
longitudinal time points of the outcome scores yielded no statistically significant differences 
despite the appearance of episodic decreases and increases. Note that the baseline TB 
accuracy was 46.5 ± 26.7%, which at the end of the 14-day trial period marginally increased 
to 50.3 ± 25.9% (P is Not Significant). This delta (change over time) of + 3.8 in 
effectiveness should be interpreted with caution due to the low sample size and high 
standard deviation. Interestingly, an increase of 8.06% in the accuracy of TB quality 
(3.8/46.5 × 100) from baseline is observed although this is likely due to a disproportionate 
contribution of one participant, as can often happen often in small samples, and hence the 
need for a larger trial. The time spent on TB (duration measured in seconds) at different time 
points across the study is shown in Table 3.
Exploratory analyses
It was observed that there was an increase in the number of strokes performed till the 7th day 
and then this value began to decrease. Table 4 depicts the changes in the mean ± standard 
deviation, median, number of strokes for each of the surfaces in all sextants in the study. 
However, the difference between the number of strokes over longitudinal time points was 
statistically significant neither under the Kruskal–Wallis test (df = 4.0, P = 0.79) nor the 
Friedman χ2 = 75.8 df = 59, P = 0.07 (the tests satisfy different assumptions for small 
repeated measures data). Although we did not measure stroke length, it was qualitatively 
observed that the strokes were relatively shorter and the speed of strokes was increased.

 We further considered the potential influence of sextant and aspect (buccal or lingual) on the 
mean levels of TB accuracy over study time points. Using a mixed model designed for 
ordinal outcomes,[25,26] appropriate for our averaged percentages over the three outcomes, 
we assessed that whether TB location (sextant and surface) on these two parameters 
accounted for significant differences in intercepts over time. The overall model fit was 
sufficient in comparison to a null model without estimates for section of teeth (by sextant 
and surface). Although differences in mean levels among participants for sextant were 
apparent, they were not significant in our model. There was a significant time × tooth 
surface interaction, however (γ = 0.37, P < 0.01), suggesting that intercept level differences 
over time points varied significantly between buccal and lingual brushing. The boxplot in 
Figure 2 displays these means and variances. Although we did not think that with such a 
small sample that these differences warranted further investigation, we do think that this 
could be an important feature to explore in the future and to mention in our discussion (see 
below); for this reason, we have included boxplots by mean level differences with their 
variability in TB accuracy for all participants combined and for each participant individually 
[Figures 2 and 3]. Figure 2 shows the striking stability of lower variances for all participants 
on the buccal aspect versus stable but much greater variances for the lingual aspect. We 
reviewed boxplots [Figure 3] of individual participants and also saw this greater variability 
and less consistency in lingual brushing versus buccal.
DISCUSSION
In this small but novel study, we determined initial feasibility using SPSV to record TB 
behavior and as a method to evaluate, in essence, directly observed TB skills and how they 
changed over 14 days. Investigators rated TB skills of research participants using two 
methods of direct observation; these methods were based on previous work.[23,24] Similar to 
other studies,[27] we determined that the length of time a person brushed their teeth did not 
change measurably after our brief intervention; however, we did observe a modest increase 
in accuracy and an increase in number of strokes per observed sextant in the initial phases of 
the study [Table 4]. The IMB model informed the structure and design of our study. Selected 
participants (dental interns) had background knowledge (information) on the science of teeth 
and oral health, the importance of TB, and some familiarity with optimal TB skills. A high 
level of motivation was an inclusion criterion for participants. Our brief training and use of 
SPVS across time offered some initial exposure to tooth brush behavioral skills training. In 
future studies, these IMB-related health theory constructs could be defined in detail a priori 
and measured more precisely. Our main addition to the literature is that similar to areas in 
medicine,[28–30] dental SPVSs were able to be used easily and efficiently to record, monitor, 
and evaluate change over time in TB skills after a brief intervention. Importantly, our 
measure of TB behavior was directly observed and not based on plaque accumulation, 
gingival or periodontal health;[31–33] such direct observation is critical component to 
implement and evaluate future IMB-based or informed interventions.
Previously, the effectiveness of TB has been measured either by participant’s self-reported 
behavior (which is prone to “reactivity”); biological measures (biomarkers/pH etc.); indirect 
measures (toothbrush changes, tooth wear); direct outcomes (involving biofeedback 
devices); and clinical outcomes.[15,31] There have been few reports using direct observation

 methodology to assess and quantify the effectiveness of TB; instead, indirect methods, such 
as the presence of plaque, calculus, or debris, have been used to measure TB effectiveness—
and such indirect approaches have strengths and limitations.[32,33] On the other hand, 
“biofeedback” devices, a direct method of evaluation, are now available; however, they are 
bulky, not cost-effective, can be technique sensitive, and often require an “in-office” 
procedure that can limit access to this technology.[31] As well, sensor-based toothbrushes, 
another direct method of evaluation, are available and increasingly provide intricate details 
of TB. Notably, the newly emerging smart toothbrushes[34–38] such as those by Oral-B™ 
(http://oralb.com/en-us/product-collections/bluetooth) which uses sensors and the Prophix 
toothbrush (https://www.getprophix.com) which uses cameras and a view screen are 
compatible with and could enable new advantages for our approach.
Given the current limitations in the dental literature, this study attempted to quantify the 
quality and accuracy of TB using a novel approach. The current study based its technique on 
previously described parameters that were used to measure the outcome of teaching TB to 
preschool children[25] and children with special needs.[26] This subset of the population 
lacked sufficient motor skill and required constant motivation to help them perform a 
complex motor skill such as TB.[25,26] For the present study, although the TB accuracy 
estimation was time-consuming and resource-demanding, the technique we used provided 
more opportunities for (actual or potential) patient–provider interactions, a more dynamic 
evaluation and allowed participation from the privacy and comfort of the participant’s own 
home. For the oral health provider in this study, there was a plethora of TB information and 
data to review and consider, such as the as the speed and width of the TB stroke, TB bristle 
angulation, and the targeting of “hot spots”[19] – observations that may prove useful to 
continue to refine the training process to develop a proper long-term TB habit. In addition, 
from the patient’s perspective, easily acquiring dental video selfies made the patient an 
active and contributing participant in the endeavor—rather than a more passive observer, i.e., 
one who just carries out the instructions of the oral health-care provider. Thus, such active 
involvement (while not measured in this study) may bolster motivation and increase the 
likelihood of a patient “sticking with” the process of re-learning and refining their TB skills. 
Further, the use of dental SPVS may render the patient more conscious while performing the 
TB behavior and could allow the participant a chance to correct his/her technique by viewing 
videos again by themselves, engaging in self-evaluation, and then taking corrective action. 
Thus, engaging in dental SPVS could itself could serve as an agent to reinforce continued 
TB monitoring and improvement.
The authors intentionally included highly motivated dental interns for this pilot trial since 
such participants were assumed to be aware of the brushing technique and more likely to 
understand the nuances of the modified Bass technique. The results from this study may be 
difficult to generalize in a general population but serve as an indication of feasibility. It is to 
be noted that the accuracy of participant’s TB skills at baseline and at the end of the study 
was less than ideal as defined by the modified Bass technique. Other studies have indicated 
that TB behavior among Indian dental interns does not meet adequate standards[38–40] when 
compared to students from other countries.

 In a very recent study, people’s adaptation to smartphone-based applications (apps) for TB 
reminders has shown very promising results.[41] Probably, a video-based monitoring app 
could be useful to a dentist or dental hygienist who could monitor the participant’s TB 
behavior, which could be recorded in the luxury of one’s own home and later reviewed by an 
oral health-care provider remotely. The cost of this app on a smartphone could be a minor 
while there could, potentially, be major long-term benefits to the user’s oral health and 
quality of life.
To affect motivation and alter skills will, in most instances, require ongoing supervision. 
Personal hygiene measures such as hand washing[42] or proper TB or other oral hygiene 
measures (such as flossing) may take a longer period of time than one may anticipate to be 
integrated into one’s regular routine. Mobile-based applications, however, have been 
reported to be successful in making surgeons and theater staffs comply with recommended 
guidelines for hand washing.[42]
The strengths of the present study are in its novel use of SPVS technology, the direct 
observation methodology (i.e., assessing TB quality and accuracy), and the in-home data 
collection by study participants. Certainly, given that this was a pilot project, our sample size 
is very small and we did not quantify IMB constructs. Despite these limitations, we were 
able to demonstrate important characteristics of the participant experience, both through 
descriptive and exploratory data analysis techniques.
For example, in this brief study, participants changed their TB behavior only modestly, did 
not attain proper TB technique and the time they spent brushing remained close to their 
baseline level. This may imply that “old habits die hard” (i.e., past behaviors strongly 
influence current behaviors and habits can be challenging to alter). Clearly, greater attention 
is needed to lengthen the time spent on brushing and a simple intervention such as brushing 
for the length of a 2 min song (of the participant’s choice) or similar cueing may be helpful. 
Regarding achieving proper TB technique, perhaps a more gradual and incremental training 
approach may be encouraged ongoing improvement. Here, ongoing feedback using SPVS 
technology and a remote “oral health coach”[10] may improve outcomes. Alternatively, 
having a participant view a dental selfie in which they have (or another person has) executed 
the TB technique correctly (for a full 2 minutes and with proper attention to each of 12 
sections in the mouth) and which the participant can then imitate, may also help improve 
outcomes over time. By extension, effective interventions that use both SPVS technology 
and “smart toothbrushes” could have major public health impact.
Although we were unable with this small sample to demonstrate statistically significant 
mean differences in the interaction of sextant and aspect, it should be noted that on closer 
examination of boxplots [Figure 3] reflecting the mean in this interaction, there appears to 
be greater variability across participants and across time points in the sections on the lingual/
palatal surfaces as opposed to the facial/buccal surfaces. It was noted by our trainers that the 
lingual surfaces had been relatively ignored prior the brief intervention; thus, participants 
were likely making conscious effort to brush these surfaces although overall attention to 
brushing the lingual surfaces was not consistent. It may also be that success in some areas 
has to do with handedness and/or the arc of the arm and wrist. These fluctuations over time,

 after a one-time, brief intervention, may be consistent with proactive interference[12] and 
may imply that greater and ongoing feedback and/or cueing is necessary in future studies to 
focus participant’s attention to routinely and properly brush the lingual surfaces of teeth (or 
other “hot spots”).[19]
CONCLUSION
Herein, we presented innovative use of “video selfies” for monitoring, implementing change, 
and evaluating the effectiveness of TB behavior. We established initial feasibility by 
demonstrating a marginal increase in TB effectiveness. Large-scale studies could be 
conducted pending implementation of reliable and valid automated technology that can 
determine TB skills in real time. Advances in the field of biomedical instrumentation may 
currently or soon be able to provide such an option.[35–37] With emerging evidence and 
insights in the field of health behavior change and brain circuitry,[43] use of innovative 
practices—such as the video selfie—may be effectively employed to assist long-term change 
in TB behaviors.[43] Until sufficient evidence-based guidelines emerge, use of dental video 
selfies could be implemented by clinicians (with the caveat that privacy and confidentiality 
concerns are addressed) to better serve the oral health needs of their patients.
