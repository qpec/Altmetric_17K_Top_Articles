ABSTRACT
Objective Exposure to e-cigarette adverts increases
children’s positive attitudes towards using them. Given
the similarity in appearance between e-cigarettes and
tobacco cigarettes, we examined whether exposure to
e-cigarette adverts has a cross-product impact on
perceptions and attitudes towards smoking tobacco
cigarettes.
Methods Children aged 11–16 (n=564) were
interviewed in their homes and randomised to one of
three groups: two groups saw different sets of 10
images of e-cigarette adverts and one group saw no
adverts. Of the 20 e-cigarette adverts, 10 depicted
the product as glamorous and 10 depicted it as healthy.
The children then self-completed a questionnaire
assessing perceived appeal, harms and benefits of
smoking tobacco cigarettes.
Results The analyses were conducted on 411 children
who reported never having smoked tobacco cigarettes or
used e-cigarettes. Exposure to the adverts had no impact
on the appeal or perceived benefits of smoking tobacco
cigarettes. While the perceived harm of smoking more
than 10 cigarettes per day was similar across groups,
those exposed to either set of adverts perceived the
harms of smoking one or two tobacco cigarettes
occasionally to be lower than those in the control group.
Conclusions This study provides the first evidence that
exposure to e-cigarette adverts might influence children’s
perceptions of smoking tobacco cigarettes, reducing their
perceived harm of occasional smoking. These results
suggest the potential for e-cigarette adverts to
undermine tobacco control efforts by reducing a
potential barrier (ie, beliefs about harm) to occasional
smoking.
INTRODUCTION
In countries with comprehensive and established
tobacco control policies, fewer adults and children
smoke now than several decades ago. As the
number of children experimenting with tobacco
cigarettes is declining, experimentation with elec-
tronic
cigarettes
(e-cigarettes)
is
now
more
common than experimentation with tobacco cigar-
ettes. For example, in England in 2014, 22% of
children
aged
11–15
had
experimented
with
e-cigarettes while only 18% had experimented with
tobacco cigarettes.1 Similarly, in the USA e-cigarette
use tripled from 2013 to 2014 among high school-
ers (5–13%) and middle schoolers (1–4%), whereas
tobacco smoking rates declined from 16% to 9%
and 4% to 3%, respectively, among these two
groups from 2011 to 2014.2
The
increasing
exposure
of
children
to
e-
cigarette adverts could be contributing to high rates
of experimentation with that product.3 4 A recent
analysis of US panel data shows that promotional
spending for e-cigarettes has rapidly increased,
reaching $28 million in 2013, over eight times the
spending in 2012.5 Furthermore, a recent analysis
of the online market found that older e-cigarette
brands were more likely to sell ‘cigalikes’, claiming
they assist smoking cessation and are healthier and
cheaper
than
tobacco
cigarettes,
while
newer
brands offered more flavours and were less likely to
compare themselves with tobacco cigarettes.6 These
marketing trends are coupled with American ado-
lescents’ exposure to televised e-cigarette adverts
increasing by 256% from 2011 to 2013.7 Previous
studies suggest that such exposure can increase
children’s positive attitudes and intentions to use
e-cigarettes.8
Adverts
for
e-cigarettes
that
are
candy-like or sweet flavoured, as opposed to non-
flavoured or tobacco-flavoured, may be especially
appealing to adolescents and increase the desire to
buy and try these products.9
Adverts for e-cigarettes feature messages historic-
ally used in the marketing of tobacco cigarettes.
For example, e-cigarette adverts often depict their
use as glamourous, cool, attractive, liked by celebri-
ties and as a symbol of freedom.10
11 In past
research, ‘cool’ and ‘glamorous’ characters such
as Joe Camel and the Marlboro man increased the
appeal and initiation of smoking.12–15 E-cigarette
adverts may also explicitly or implicitly depict
the potential for e-cigarettes to foster health
through claims of being safer than tobacco cigar-
ettes.10

16
Depictions
of
endorsements
by
doctors are reminiscent of tobacco cigarette advertis-
ing in the 1950s.17 These two advertising themes of
‘glamour’ and ‘healthfulness’ are examined in the
current study
.
Given the physical and motor-behavioural simi-
larities between tobacco cigarettes and many types
of e-cigarettes, exposure to e-cigarettes in adverts
may affect attitudes towards smoking tobacco
cigarettes. Among adult smokers, seeing someone
use an e-cigarette in vivo or in video adverts
increases the desire and urge to smoke tobacco
cigarettes18 19 and decreases intentions to abstain
from smoking tobacco cigarettes among former
smokers.20
T
wo studies have assessed the impact of e-
cigarette adverts on the appeal and perceived harm
of tobacco smoking among youth, but both studies
had important limitations.8 9 One used a mixture
of adverts with opposing messages, highlighting the

 differences and similarities between e-cigarettes and tobacco.8
Neither
study
had
samples
representative
of
general
populations.
The present study builds on the existing limited evidence con-
cerning the possible cross-cueing effects of e-cigarette advertis-
ing on the appeal of tobacco smoking among children, assessing
the effects of two advertising themes used in earlier tobacco
advertising (glamour and healthfulness) and using a sample rep-
resentative of the general population.
Our primary hypothesis was that exposing children to glam-
orous
e-cigarette
adverts
increases
the
appeal
of
tobacco
smoking, and our secondary hypothesis was that exposing chil-
dren to healthful e-cigarette adverts that emphasise the potential
health benefits of e-cigarettes over tobacco cigarettes reduces the
appeal of tobacco smoking.
METHODS
Design
Participants were randomised to one of three groups where they
viewed: 10 adverts associating e-cigarette use with glamour, 10
adverts associating e-cigarette use with health or no adverts
(control).
Participants
The study included 564 children aged 11–16. This sample pro-
vided 90% power at p=0.01 to detect a medium-size difference
in appeal of smoking tobacco cigarettes among the three
groups,21 allowing for a reduction in sample size caused by
excluding children with prior tobacco smoking or e-cigarette
use.1
Sampling strategy
A market research agency (ICM Direct; http://www.icm-direct.
com/) conducted the interviews. Participants were selected using
a random location quota sampling procedure across the UK.
Fifty super output areas (SOAs) were randomly selected (with
probability of selection proportionate to their size) from the
32 844 lower layer super output areas (LSOAs) in England,
1909 LSOAs in W
ales, 2500 data zones in Scotland (equivalent
to LSOAs) and 890 LSOAs in Northern Ireland. Recruitment
quotas based on census data and Office for National Statistics
estimates for age, sex, ethnicity and tenure were set within each
LSOA.
Materials
The adverts used in this study were selected following a pilot
study in which participants rated 40 e-cigarette adverts based on
how ‘cool’ or ‘healthy’ they portrayed e-cigarettes to be. From
the pilot, we selected 10 adverts rated as more glamorous than
healthful, showing the largest differences between the two
aspects. These ‘glamour’ adverts were reminiscent of tobacco
advertising in the 1950–1960s, depicting e-cigarettes as cool,
attractive, fashionable, popular and featuring attractive young
people. W
e also selected 10 adverts with the largest differences
in ratings of ‘healthy’ over ‘cool’. These adverts featured
people wearing white coats and claimed e-cigarettes can aid
smoking cessation, do not contain carcinogens found in
tobacco cigarettes and are ‘safe and healthy’. Additional
by-item analyses showed that the adverts allocated to the
glamour group were significantly different and clearly distinct
from adverts allocated to the health group (see online supple-
mentary materials).
Measures
Tobacco cigarette-related measures
Appeal of smoking tobacco cigarettes was rated on three bipolar
items: unattractive versus attractive, not cool versus cool and
boring versus fun.21 Responses were recorded on scales ranging
from 1 to 5, with higher scores denoting greater appeal. The
items formed a reliable scale (α=0.81).
Perceived positive (pros) and negative (cons) attributes of
tobacco smoking were assessed with the Decisional Balance for
Adolescent Smoking Scale developed by Hudmon et al22 and
validated for use with children.23–25 Participants rated six items
describing perceived pros (eg, ‘Kids who smoke have more
friends’) and six items describing perceived cons of smoking
(eg, ‘Smoking makes teeth yellow’) on 5-point scales. Scale reli-
ability for both subscales was high (αpros=0.81; αpros=0.87).
Perceived harms of tobacco smoking were assessed using three
items from previous research: ‘Smoking can harm your health’
rated from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree, ‘How dan-
gerous do you think it is to smoke more than 10 cigarettes a
day?’ and ‘How dangerous do you think it is to smoke one or
two cigarettes occasionally?’ both rated on five-point scales
ranging from 1=not very dangerous to 5=very dangerous.26
Scale reliability in the current sample was modest (α=0.50);
therefore; we analysed the items separately as in previous
studies.26–28
Prevalence estimates of tobacco smoking were given on an
open-ended question: ‘How many young people your age out of
100 do you think smoke tobacco cigarettes?’.29
Susceptibility to tobacco smoking was assessed using three
items: ‘Do you think you will be smoking tobacco cigarettes
when you are 18 years old?’; ‘Do you think you will smoke a
tobacco cigarette at any time during the next year?’ and ‘If one
of your friends offered you a tobacco cigarette, would you
smoke it?’.21 30 Participants who did not respond ‘definitely
not’ to all three items were categorised as susceptible.
E-cigarette-related measures
Appeal of using e-cigarettes was assessed using the same three
bipolar items used to assess the appeal of smoking tobacco
cigarettes (α=0.88).
Prevalence estimates of e-cigarette use were assessed by adapt-
ing the item used to assess prevalence estimates of tobacco
smoking: ‘How many young people your age out of 100 do you
think use e-cigarettes?’.
Measures assessed only in the two conditions in which adverts
were shown
Appeal of e-cigarette adverts was assessed by asking: ‘How much
do you like this advert (not the product)?’.31 Responses ranged
from 1=not at all to 4=a lot. Responses to the adverts were
averaged into a single index (α=0.88).
Interest in buying and trying e-cigarettes was assessed with
one item: ‘Does this advert make you want to buy and try this
product?’ with scores ranging from 1=not at all to 4=yes, a
lot.31 Responses were averaged across the 10 adverts (α=0.91).
Other measures for all conditions
Tobacco smoking was assessed using the questions ‘Have you
ever smoked a tobacco cigarette?’ and ‘Have you ever tried
tobacco cigarette smoking, even one or two puffs?’.30 Items
assessing tobacco cigarette smoking were adapted to assess use
of e-cigarettes: ‘Have you ever used an e-cigarette?’ and ‘In the
past 30 days, on how many days did you use an e-cigarette?’.

 Gender, age, ethnicity and geographic location within the UK
were also recorded.
Procedure
ICM Direct recruited participants and collected the data.
Trained interviewers knocked on doors at households from eli-
gible LSOAs and obtained written consent from parents/guar-
dians. Children were randomly assigned to one of the three
groups, using a pre-established random sequence generated by
the statistical package R. After children verbally assented, inter-
viewers instructed them and handed over the study booklets.
Interviewers assisted participants when requested. Those allo-
cated to the glamour and healthful conditions were shown a
block of 10 print-adverts in the booklets, whereas those allo-
cated to the control condition were not shown any adverts.
Children across all conditions were told that the study was
about their views on e-cigarettes, and their thoughts about the
e-cigarette adverts shown (only in glamour and healthful condi-
tions)
(see
booklets
in
online
supplementary
materials).
Exposure to the adverts was not timed, and their order was not
counterbalanced. Each advert was shown only once. Children in
all three groups completed the measures in one session (£10
compensation).
Analyses
Responses to the primary and secondary outcomes were not
normally distributed, so differences between the groups were
assessed using non-parametric tests (Kruskal-W
allis for compari-
sons between more than two groups; Mann-Whitney for com-
parisons between two groups). Logistic regression was used for
measures with dichotomous outcomes.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics
Of the 564 children randomised, 153 (27.1%) were excluded
because they had already smoked tobacco cigarettes or used
e-cigarettes, leaving a final sample of 411 children. Sample
characteristics are summarised in table 1. Randomisation was
effective: the three experimental groups did not differ on any of
the demographic characteristics.
Main analyses
Descriptive statistics (M, SD) for the outcome variables are
summarised in table 2. The mean ranks from non-parametric
analyses are shown in online supplementary materials.
Tobacco-related outcomes
There were no statistically significant differences between the
groups on appeal of smoking tobacco cigarettes, perceived pros
and
cons
of
smoking
tobacco
cigarettes,
susceptibility
to
smoking tobacco cigarettes or the prevalence estimates for
tobacco smoking. Of the three items assessing the perceived
harms of smoking tobacco cigarettes, there was a difference
between the groups on the item, ‘How dangerous do you think
it is to smoke one or two cigarettes occasionally?’. Children
exposed to either set of e-cigarette adverts perceived the danger
as
lower
than
the
control
group
(Kruskall-W
allis
test,
χ2(2)=10.07, p=0.007). Those in the glamour (U=7680.500,
Z=−2.225, p=0.026, r=0.136) and those in the health condi-
tion (U=7492.000, Z=−3.057, p=0.002, r=0.184) perceived
occasional smoking of one or two tobacco cigarettes to be less
harmful than did those in the control condition. There was no
significant difference in perceived harm of occasional smoking
between participants in the glamour and health conditions
(U=9054.000,
Z=−0.926,
p=0.354,
r=0.045;
see
online
supplementary materials table S2).
E-cigarette-related outcomes
The appeal of using e-cigarettes did not differ between experi-
mental groups, but estimates of the prevalence of e-cigarette use
differed significantly between conditions (Kruskal-W
allis test,
χ2(2)=6.95, p=0.031), with those in the glamour condition

 estimating that more children were using e-cigarettes compared
with the control group (U=7461.000, Z=−2.213, p=0.027,
r=0.136) and the health group (U=7981.500, Z=−2.334,

prevalence estimates of e-cigarette use between children in the
health and control groups (U=9003.000, Z=−0.153, p=0.879,
r=0.009).
Outcomes assessed only in the groups exposed to
e-cigarette adverts
Children exposed to either set of adverts did not differ in how
appealing they found the adverts or their interest in buying or
trying e-cigarettes, both of which were low.
Exploratory analyses
T
wo sets of post hoc analyses were conducted to explore the
finding that exposure to either set of e-cigarette adverts reduced
the perceived harm of occasional smoking of tobacco cigarettes.
First, we examined participants’ responses to the three harm
items across the three experimental conditions (see figure 1 and
online supplementary materials, table S3). W
e found that expos-
ure to either set of adverts increased the number of participants
who perceived occasional smoking of one or two tobacco cigar-
ettes as ‘not very dangerous’.
W
e used the same measures of perceived harm of tobacco
smoking in another study assessing the impact of exposure to
candy-like flavoured and non-flavoured e-cigarette adverts.9
Using results from this study and the current study, we con-
ducted a meta-analysis of the proportions of participants who
responded to the item, ‘How dangerous do you think it is to
smoke one or two cigarettes occasionally?’ by stating that it was
‘not very dangerous’, comparing those exposed to any type of
advert for e-cigarettes with those in the control groups.
Children’s exposure to any of the adverts for e-cigarettes used
in each of the two studies increased the perception that occa-
sional smoking of one or two cigarettes was not very dangerous:

(2.47
to

Z=4.04,
p<0.001 (see figure 2).
DISCUSSION
In an experiment examining the effects of glamorous and
healthful
e-cigarette
adverts
among
UK
11–16 year
olds,
exposure to the adverts had no impact on the appeal, suscepti-
bility or perceived benefits of smoking tobacco cigarettes. While
the perceived harm of smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day
was similar across groups, those exposed to either set of adverts
perceived the harms of smoking one or two tobacco cigarettes
occasionally to be lower than did those in the control group.
The lack of impact of the adverts on appeal and susceptibility to
tobacco smoking is encouraging and replicates findings from
two other studies using similar measures.8
9 However, the
impact on perceived harms is concerning given that harm per-
ceptions are predictive of tobacco smoking.32–34 Perceived harm
of occasional smoking is particularly predictive of subsequent
engagement with smoking35 36 and differentiates smokers from
non-smokers.37 Furthermore, although the health consequences
of occasional smoking can be as severe as regular smoking,38
young smokers who smoke occasionally do not consider them-
selves smokers, believing that they are immune to the risks asso-
ciated with smoking, with low intentions to quit.39 40 Although
the adverts did not affect perceptions of appeal, susceptibility
and perceived benefits of smoking tobacco cigarettes, their
effect on perceived harm is theoretically and empirically import-
ant. In theories like the Health Belief Model, perceived threat is
a key construct affecting changes in health behaviour. In the
empirical literature, perceived risk significantly predicts inten-
tions and behaviours generally,41 42 as well as more specifically
in relation to smoking.32–34
Only two other studies thus far have examined the perceived
harms of tobacco smoking following exposure to e-cigarette
adverts. Vasiljevic and colleagues found no significant dif-
ferences in perceived harm of regular and occasional tobacco
smoking following exposure to either candy-like flavoured or
non-flavoured e-cigarette adverts among English school chil-
dren.9 However, meta-analysis using data from that study and
the current study showed that exposure to any kind of
e-cigarette advert reduced the perceived harm of occasional
smoking one or two tobacco cigarettes. In contrast, Farrelly and
colleagues’ experiment found that exposing children to four
e-cigarette TV adverts did not decrease the perceived harm of
tobacco smoking.8 However, their measure of perceived harm
(‘How harmful are cigarettes’) was general and not time-specific.
A similar item (‘Smoking can harm your health’) that was used
in the present study and the study by Vasiljevic et al9 replicated

Tob Control: first published as 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-052940 on 5 September 2016. Downloaded from 
 the results by Farrelly et al8 in showing that brief exposure to e-
cigarette adverts did not affect children’s general perceptions
that smoking is harmful. A broader set of items assessing harm,
potentially specifying type of harm, time frame and under what
conditions the harm would occur should be used in future
studies alongside qualitative studies exploring how children per-
ceive harms of tobacco smoking when exposed to e-cigarette
adverts.43
The present study also found that children exposed to gla-
mourous e-cigarette adverts estimated the number of young e-
cigarette users to be greater than did children exposed either to
healthful e-cigarette adverts or no adverts. This extends recent
findings that exposure to e-cigarette adverts fosters more posi-
tive attitudes and intentions to use e-cigarettes in children, sug-
gesting that exposure to e-cigarette adverts may shift the
perceived norms of e-cigarette use among children.8 9 This may
contribute to the increasing prevalence of e-cigarette use among
children. W
e only observed this effect for glamorous depictions
of e-cigarette use. That we did not find a similar effect for
healthful adverts suggests that glamorous depictions may be
more potent at shifting the norms of e-cigarette use among chil-
dren. Our findings suggest that restricting youth-targeted adver-
tising with glamorous images of e-cigarettes may curb the rising
experimentation and use of e-cigarettes in young people, but
this requires evaluation.
Strengths and limitations
The current study provides novel, robust and timely evidence
contributing to the small but growing evidence base on the
potential
for
e-cigarettes
to
influence
attitudes
towards
smoking tobacco cigarettes. The study is limited by assessing
perceptions and attitudes and not actual tobacco smoking or
e-cigarette use. However, there is a large body of evidence
demonstrating that perceptions and attitudes influence many
judgements and behaviours.44
45 In keeping with this, the
appeal
of
tobacco
smoking
predicts
subsequent
tobacco
smoking in young people.29 46 Nevertheless, future studies
should examine more direct measures of behaviour or incorp-
orate implicit measures of appeal that avoid social desirability
biases.
The study was also limited by using momentary exposure to
still e-cigarette adverts. The reported effects may therefore
underestimate the impact of the prolonged and vivid exposure
to e-cigarette adverts that children experience in real-life settings
(on television, internet and social media). The present study
should be extended to examine children’s responses to e-
cigarette adverts in more naturalistic settings, over longer
periods of time and using more vivid forms of advertisement.
The advertising stimuli depicted primarily ‘cigalike’ devices,
rather than advanced generation devices, which could limit gen-
eralizability across the range of e-cigarettes currently available in
the
marketplace.
However,
the
choice
to
focus
on
first-
generation devices was deliberate, given that we wished to
explore how devices that looked like tobacco cigarettes impacted
beliefs about or interest in tobacco cigarettes. Future studies
could explore differential effects of first-generation and second-
generation e-cigarettes.
Implications for policy
Since May 2016, e-cigarette marketing across Europe falls under
the new Tobacco Products Directive (TPD).47 The new regula-
tions limit the exposure of children to TV and newspaper
e-cigarette adverts. However, the proposed implementation of
these regulations in the UK and other EU member states still
allows some form of e-cigarette advertising (posters, leaflets,
billboards in shops), so children may still be exposed to
e-cigarette adverts. The TPD also does not explicitly prohibit
the use of glamorous or healthful themes/content. In the USA,

 the Food and Drug Administration recently began regulating
e-cigarettes, but the regulations do not include provisions to
limit youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising or to restrict
e-cigarette adverts with potentially youth-appealing themes/
content.48
From a policy viewpoint, we note that our study only exam-
ined in-the-moment responses to e-cigarette adverts, and there-
fore our findings may underestimate or overestimate the impact
these adverts may have in the longer term. Contemporary mar-
keting communications are aimed not so much at stimulating
immediate purchasing,49 but doing so more indirectly by raising
awareness,
interest
and
identification
with
products
and
brands.50 51 These outcomes are subtle and develop gradually
and are unlikely to be observed in studies such as ours investi-
gating the immediate effects of advertising.
However, this is the first study to provide evidence for the
possible cross-cueing and re-normalising effects of e-cigarettes
on tobacco smoking52 53 by showing that associating e-cigarettes
with either glamour or health lowers the perceived harm of
occasional smoking of one or two tobacco cigarettes among
children who have not used tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes.
Moreover, our study shows that glamorous e-cigarette adverts
can shift the perceived normativeness of e-cigarette use by
increasing the perceived prevalence of children who are e-
cigarette users. These findings, coupled with the growing popu-
larity of e-cigarette products among children,2 54 55 and the
wider literature on the dangers to the developing brain arising
from nicotine exposure and addiction16 56 suggest a need to
re-examine the rules surrounding the marketing of e-cigarettes.
What this paper adds
▸ Exposure of adolescents to e-cigarette adverts increases the
appeal of using e-cigarettes.
▸ Given the similarities in appearance between e-cigarettes
and tobacco cigarettes, could exposure to e-cigarette adverts
increase the appeal of smoking tobacco cigarettes?
▸ Exposing children to e-cigarette adverts associating
e-cigarettes with glamour or their putative health benefits
did not increase the appeal or perceived benefits of smoking
tobacco cigarettes.
▸ Exposing children to either set of e-cigarette adverts did,
however, lower their perceptions of the harm of smoking
one or two tobacco cigarettes occasionally.
▸ This study provides the first evidence that exposure to
e-cigarette adverts might influence children’s perceptions of
smoking tobacco cigarettes, reducing their perceived harm.
