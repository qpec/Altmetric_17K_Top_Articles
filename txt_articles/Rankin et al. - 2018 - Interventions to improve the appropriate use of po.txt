Background
Inappropriate polypharmacy is a particular concern in older people and is associated with negative health outcomes. Choosing the best
interventions to improve appropriate polypharmacy is a priority, hence interest in appropriate polypharmacy, where many medicines
may be used to achieve better clinical outcomes for patients, is growing.
Objectives
This review sought to determine which interventions, alone or in combination, are effective in improving the appropriate use of
polypharmacy and reducing medication-related problems in older people.
Search methods
In November 2013, for this first update, a range of literature databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched, and
handsearching of reference lists was performed. Search terms included ’polypharmacy’, ’medication appropriateness’ and ’inappropriate
prescribing’.
Selection criteria
A range of study designs were eligible. Eligible studies described interventions affecting prescribing aimed at improving appropriate
polypharmacy in people 65 years of age and older in which a validated measure of appropriateness was used (e.g. Beers criteria,
Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI)).
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts of eligible studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies.
Study-specific estimates were pooled, and a random-effects model was used to yield summary estimates of effect and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). The GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to assess the
overall quality of evidence for each pooled outcome.

 Main results
Two studies were added to this review to bring the total number of included studies to 12. One intervention consisted of computerised
decision support; 11 complex, multi-faceted pharmaceutical approaches to interventions were provided in a variety of settings. Inter-
ventions were delivered by healthcare professionals, such as prescribers and pharmacists. Appropriateness of prescribing was measured
using validated tools, including the MAI score post intervention (eight studies), Beers criteria (four studies), STOPP criteria (two
studies) and START criteria (one study). Interventions included in this review resulted in a reduction in inappropriate medication
usage. Based on the GRADE approach, the overall quality of evidence for all pooled outcomes ranged from very low to low. A greater
reduction in MAI scores between baseline and follow-up was seen in the intervention group when compared with the control group
(four studies; mean difference -6.78, 95% CI -12.34 to -1.22). Postintervention pooled data showed a lower summated MAI score
(five studies; mean difference -3.88, 95% CI -5.40 to -2.35) and fewer Beers drugs per participant (two studies; mean difference -0.1,
95% CI -0.28 to 0.09) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Evidence of the effects of interventions on hospital
admissions (five studies) and of medication-related problems (six studies) was conflicting.
Authors’ conclusions
It is unclear whether interventions to improve appropriate polypharmacy, such as pharmaceutical care, resulted in clinically significant
improvement; however, they appear beneficial in terms of reducing inappropriate prescribing.

A review of the ways that healthcare professionals can improve the use of suitable medicines for older people
Taking medicine to treat symptoms of chronic illness and to prevent worsening of disease is common in older people. However, taking
too many medicines can cause harm. This review examines studies in which healthcare professionals have taken action to make sure that
older people are receiving the most effective and safest medication for their illness. Actions taken included providing pharmaceutical care,
a service provided by pharmacists that involves identifying, preventing and resolving medication-related problems, as well as promoting
the correct use of medications and encouraging health promotion and education. Another strategy was computerised decision support,
which involves a programme on the doctor’s computer that helps him/her to select appropriate treatment.
This review provides limited evidence that interventions, such as pharmaceutical care, may be successful in ensuring that older people
are receiving the right medicines, but it is not clear whether this always results in clinical improvement.

aLimitations in the design of studies included in the analysis such as lack of protection against contamination and lack of allocation
concealment resulted in downgrading of the quality of evidence.
bA validated assessment of under-prescribing was not included in all studies; therefore, the findings answered a restricted version of the
research question. This resulted in downgrading of the quality of evidence.
cStatistically significant heterogeneity, variation in effect estimates and non-overlapping CIs between studies resulted in downgrading of
the quality of evidence.
dImprecision in effect estimates was observed whereby CIs were wide and/or crossed the line of no effect.
eTwo studies were excluded from the analysis because of a unit of analysis error (Crotty 2004a) and an outlying effect estimate with a
high risk of bias (Spinewine 2007).

Interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy for older people (Review)

 B A C K G R O U N D
Prescribing for older people is complex because of factors such as
age-related changes in body composition and multiple patholo-
gies. Finding the balance between aggressively treating diseases
and avoiding medication-related harm is a critical objective of-
ten set by healthcare professionals, yet rarely achieved (Steinman
2007). This review updates a Cochrane review of interventions
to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy for older people
(Patterson 2012). The previous version of this review (Patterson
2012) found that, despite the potential to reduce inappropriate
prescribing, it was unclear whether interventions to improve ap-
propriate polypharmacy in older people resulted in clinically sig-
nificant improvement.
Polypharmacy has a range of definitions that refer to the use of
multiple medication regimens, but no standard definition is used
consistently (King’s Fund 2013; Stewart 1990). A simple defini-
tion-’the administration of more medicines than are clinically in-
dicated, representing unnecessary drug use’ (Montamat 2004)-has
been used, but for the purpose of this review, we have used the
common definition of ’the concomitant ingestion of four or more
medications’ (DoH 2001; Rollason 2003).
Polypharmacy is common in older people, conventionally defined
as those aged 65 years and over, as this age group often suffers
from multiple morbidities (Barnett 2012) such as heart disease
and diabetes that require multiple medications for treatment and
prophylaxis. In the USA, the prevalence of polypharmacy, defined
in the Slone Survey as five or more medicines, in older people has
increased over time, and the most recent available data indicate
that approximately 28% of older people in the USA are receiving
polypharmacy (Slone Survey 2007). This is relatively consistent
with data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, which
has reported polypharmacy in 31% of the older population using
the same definition of five or more medicines (Richardson 2012).
Hence, older people use a disproportionate quantity of health ser-
vice resources. For example, in 2013, patients aged 60 and older
accounted for 23% of the population in England and were dis-
pensed 60% of all prescription items (Information Centre 2014).
Inappropriate medications can be defined, in terms of older peo-
ple, as ’medications or medication classes that should generally be
avoided in persons 65 years or older because they are either inef-
fective or they pose unnecessarily high risk for older persons and a
safer alternative is available’ (Beers 1991). The term ’inappropri-
ate prescribing’ also encompasses the use of medicines that lead
to a significant risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) arising from
prescribing practices such as continuing therapy for longer than
necessary, in addition to unnecessary polypharmacy.
Reasons for the occurrence of polypharmacy in older patients
have been described in the literature and can be broadly classified
into three groups: demographic factors such as race and educa-
tion (Fillenbaum 1996); health status factors such as poor health
including depression, hypertension, anaemia, asthma, angina, di-
verticulosis, osteoarthritis, gout, diabetes mellitus, poor self-per-
ceived health and poor life satisfaction; and factors related to access
to health care such as number of healthcare visits, use of supple-
mental insurance and access to multiple providers of health care
(Espino 1998; Hajar 2007).
Recent promotion of the use of clinical guidelines has influenced
prescribing patterns, which often advocate the use of more than
one drug to manage common diseases. Many guidelines for pre-
vention and management of diseases common in older people rec-
ommend adding medications for secondary prevention. For ex-
ample, within Europe, guidelines developed by a joint task force
on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, which
involved the European Society of Cardiology (Joint Task Force
2012), advocate this approach. However, it has been reported that
some clinical guidelines do not modify or discuss the applicability
of their recommendations for older patients with multiple mor-
bidities, nor do they take account of patient preferences or com-
ment on the quality of evidence supporting the guideline (Boyd
2005). Use of clinical guidelines may therefore promote polyphar-
macy and increase the risk of adverse events such as drug-drug and
drug-disease interactions. In light of this, the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is considering the devel-
opment of guidelines for the clinical treatment of patients with
multiple morbidities (NICE 2012).
Appropriate or therapeutic polypharmacy also occurs when the re-
sults of clinical trials suggest that multiple medications should be
used to treat specific diseases (Gurwitz 2004). Acceptance of the
idea that such appropriate polypharmacy may be beneficial is in-
creasing, and the combined use of multiple medications is benefi-
cial and appropriate for many conditions, especially those in older
people with multiple morbidities. For example, diabetes mellitus
is often treated with several drugs at once (Standl 2003). However,
it is important to consider whether each drug has been prescribed
appropriately or inappropriately, both individually and in the con-
text of the whole prescription (Aronson 2006). Improving appro-
priate polypharmacy involves encouraging use of the correct drugs
under appropriate conditions to treat the right diseases. In certain
circumstances, this may include the removal of unnecessary drugs
or those with no valid clinical indication and the addition of useful
ones.
However, polypharmacy is associated with negative health out-
comes including adverse drug reactions, poor adherence and geri-
atric syndromes such as urinary incontinence, cognitive impair-
ment and impaired balance leading to falls (Hajar 2007). The
chance of occurrence of medication-related problems is increased
in older age because the ageing process reduces the efficiency of
the body’s organs in eliminating drugs (Mangoni 2003). The risk
of an ADE is 13% with the use of two medications, but when
five medications are used, it increases to 58% (Fulton 2005). If
seven or more medications are used, the incidence increases to

 82% (Prybys 2002). In addition, the number of medicines pre-
scribed predicts the number of drug interactions likely to occur
(Gallagher 2001). Poor understanding of causes of certain disor-
ders makes prescribing drug combinations more difficult. Treating
poorly understood diseases may increase the risk for inappropriate
polypharmacy (Werder 2003).
Under-prescribing is defined as lack of drug treatment for a clinical
condition for which drug therapy is indicated according to clin-
ical practice guidelines (Lipton 1992). Under-prescribing can be
as challenging as polypharmacy in older people, and it has only re-
cently gained recognition as a matter of concern. Under-prescrib-
ing has been shown to be associated with polypharmacy, whereby
the probability of under-prescription increases with the number
of medicines used (Kuijpers 2007). Using a sample of 150 older
study participants, Kuijpers 2007 reported that the prevalence of
polypharmacy and under-prescribing was 61% and 31%, respec-
tively. Among participants receiving polypharmacy, 42.9% were
under-treated, in contrast to 13.5% of those using four or fewer
medicines (odds ratio (OR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0
to 11.2).
These findings may be explained by the unwillingness of general
practitioners (GPs) to prescribe additional drugs for patients with
polypharmacy (for reasons such as complexity of drug regimens,
fear of ADEs and drug-drug interactions and poor adherence)
(Kuijpers 2007). This so-called treatment/risk paradox or risk/
treatment mismatch is seen when patients with the highest risk
of complications are determined to have the lowest probability of
receiving the recommended medications (Ko 2004; Lee 2005).
Thus, ’polypharmacy’ can refer to the prescribing of many drugs
(appropriately) or too many drugs (inappropriately) (Aronson
2004). What constitutes ’many’ or ’too many’ drugs is a prescriber’s
dilemma, and choosing the best interventions aimed at ensuring
appropriate polypharmacy remains a challenge for healthcare prac-
titioners and organisations.
Description of the condition
Inappropriate polypharmacy, as described above, occurs when
older people are prescribed more medicines than are clinically indi-
cated. As under-prescribing is also inappropriate therapy for older
people, we have included in this review interventions provided
to address this problem, such as the promotion of appropriate
polypharmacy.
Inappropriate polypharmacy has been measured by using validated
instruments or screening tools such as a validated list of medicines
considered inappropriate for older people (AGS 2012; Beers 1991;
Fick 2003), a list of clinically significant criteria for potentially
inappropriate prescribing in older people (Gallagher 2008) or the
Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) (Knight 2001). Other
methods of assessment of inappropriate polypharmacy include ex-
amining patient adherence to prescribed medications to identify
target areas for intervention (Barat 2001; Bedell 2000).
Description of the intervention
Improvement in appropriate polypharmacy can be achieved
through a wide range of interventions. These can be classified as
professional, for example, educational programmes for prescribers
or consumers; organisational, for example, medication review clin-
ics and specific audits on benzodiazepine use; or financial, for ex-
ample, prescribed incentive schemes and regulatory interventions.
Interventions that reduce the risk of medication-related problems
are important to consider (Fick 2008). These may be provided
by healthcare professionals, educators, policy makers and health-
care service planners. The traditional approach to intervention
in polypharmacy, based on the assumption that polypharmacy is
harmful, has been to reduce inappropriate medication. By iden-
tifying risk factors for polypharmacy, it is possible to decrease its
associated morbidity, mortality and cost (Werder 2003).
Methods recommended in many intervention studies include use
of computer data entry and feedback procedures, which have
been shown to decrease polypharmacy and drug-drug interac-
tions (Werder 2003); visual identification of medicines; continu-
ous medication review and thorough patient education to opti-
mise polypharmacy (Fulton 2005).
This review seeks to identify evidence regarding which types of
interventions can improve appropriate polypharmacy.
How the intervention might work
Interventions to improve polypharmacy are likely to achieve the
following outcomes.
• Improved appropriate polypharmacy through removal of
inappropriately prescribed medication.
• Increased appropriate medications by promotion of
adherence to evidence-based therapy.
Computerised decision support (CDS) aimed at prescribers,
whereby electronic alerts are produced to guide the prescriber to
the right treatment, has been successful in reducing inappropriate
prescribing for older people. Pharmacist-led interventions such as
medication review, co-ordinated transition from hospital to long-
term care facility and pharmacist consultations with patients and
physicians have been shown to effectively reduce inappropriate
prescribing and ADEs (Hanlon 1996; Kaur 2009). Multi-disci-
plinary case conferences involving GPs, geriatricians, pharmacists
and residential care staff, wherein individual patient cases are dis-
cussed, have reduced the use of inappropriate medications in res-
idential care (Crotty 2004a)

 Why it is important to do this review
A systematic review may help to identify how we can improve ap-
propriate polypharmacy in older people. Inappropriate prescrib-
ing for older people is both highly prevalent and commonly asso-
ciated with polypharmacy (Bradley 2012; Cahir 2010). It is im-
portant that the gap in current evidence be addressed, so that in-
terventions that are effective in managing disease with appropriate
polypharmacy may be identified and put into practice.

This review sought to determine which interventions, alone or
in combination, are effective in improving the appropriate use of
polypharmacy and reducing medication-related problems in older
people.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), includ-
ingcluster-randomisedcontrolledtrials(cRCTs), non-randomised
controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-and-after stud-
ies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies meeting the
Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) specification
(EPOC 2009) in the review.
We classified trials eligible for inclusion according to the reader’s
degree of certainty that random allocation was used to form com-
parison groups in the trial. If study author(s) stated explicitly that
groups compared in the trial were established by random alloca-
tion, we classified the trial as an RCT. If study author(s) did not
state explicitly that the trial was randomised, but randomisation
could not be ruled out, we classified the report as a CCT.
Types of participants
The review included studies of older people aged 65 years and
older, who had more than one long-term medical condition, in-
cluding those for whom polypharmacy (classified as four or more
medicines) was common practice, for example, those with Parkin-
son’s disease or diabetes. We considered trials for inclusion if they
included a majority (80% or more) of participants aged 65 years
and older, or if the mean age of study participants was over 65
years. If studies included both older and younger people, we in-
cluded them if we were able to extract relevant data. We contacted
study authors to check the availability of relevant data.
We excluded studies in which the intervention focused on people
with a single long-term medical condition or who were receiving
short-term polypharmacy, for example, those who were terminally
ill or were receiving cancer chemotherapy.
Types of interventions
We examined all types of interventions aimed at improving ap-
propriate polypharmacy in any setting compared with usual care
as defined by the study. We included all unifaceted interventions,
for example, those targeted solely at drug prescription, and multi-
facetedinterventions,forexample, specialistclinicsinvolvingcom-
prehensive geriatric assessment, in studies in which most outcomes
were related to polypharmacy. We included studies of interven-
tions for which the target was polypharmacy across all ages, pro-
vided results for those aged 65 years and over were available sepa-
rately. We examined all types of interventions that directly or in-
directly affected prescribing and were aimed at improving appro-
priate polypharmacy. These included the following.
• Professional interventions such as educational programmes
aimed at prescribers.
• Organisational interventions such as skill-mix changes,
pharmacist-led medication review services or specialist clinics,
information and communication technology (ICT)
interventions such as clinical decision support systems or use of
risk screening tools.
• Financial interventions such as incentive schemes for
changes in prescribing practice.
• Regulatory interventions such as changes in government
policy or legislation affecting prescribing.
Types of outcome measures
Validated measures of inappropriate prescribing were the main
outcome measures considered in the review. Increasing appropri-
ate polypharmacy could improve indicators of morbidity such as
reduction in ADEs or hospital admissions, but clinical outcomes
were not clearly reported because of confounding factors such as
multi-morbidity in older people. We excluded studies in which
expert opinion was used to determine medication appropriateness.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome was change in the prevalence of appropriate
use of polypharmacy, as measured by a validated instrument. This
was defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria.
• Appropriateness of medications prescribed, as measured by
a validated instrument, for example, Beers criteria (Fick 2003) or
MAI (Knight 2001).
• Prevalence of appropriate medication, for example, an
increase in the number of appropriate drugs, as defined by a
validated tool, for example, Screening Tool to Alert doctors to
the Right Treatment (START) criteria (Barry 2007).

 • Hospital admissions.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes included the following.
• Medication-related problems in older people, for example,
adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions and medication
errors.
• Adherence to medication.
• Quality of life (as assessed by a validated method).
Search methods for identification of studies
Michelle Fiander, Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) for the EPOC
Group, developed search strategies in consultation with the review
authors. The TSC searched the Cochrane Database of System-
atic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects
(DARE) for related systematic reviews, as well as the databases
listed below for primary studies. Searches were conducted in
November 2013; exact search dates for each database are included
with the search strategies, which are provided in Appendix 2

databases were searched for articles indexed between May 2010
and November 2013. Two methodological search filters were
used to limit retrieval to appropriate study designs: the Cochrane
Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (sensitivity- and precision-max-
imising version, 2008) (Lefebvre 2011) to identify randomised
trials; and an EPOC methodology filter to identify studies us-
ing non-RCT designs. No language restrictions were applied. All
search strategies used for this review are provided in Appendix 2.
Searching other resources
• Screened selected issues of the Journal of the American
Geriatrics Society (e.g. handsearching).
• Reviewed reference lists of relevant systematic reviews.
• Contacted authors of relevant studies and reviews to ask
that they clarify reported published information or to seek
unpublished results/data.
• Contacted researchers with expertise relevant to the review
topic or to EPOC interventions.
• Conducted cited reference searches on studies selected for
inclusion in this review, related reviews and other relevant
citations as listed on the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)
Web of Science/Web of Knowledge.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
For this update, two review authors (CH and CC) independently
screened titles and abstracts identified in searches to assess which
studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. At this stage, we
excluded papers that did not meet the inclusion criteria. If uncer-
tainty or disagreement arose at this stage, we obtained full-text ar-
ticles and assessed them independently to determine whether they
met previously defined inclusion criteria. Any remaining disagree-
ment or uncertainty was resolved by consensus through discussion
with another review author (CR).
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (CH and CC) independently extracted details
of articles included in this update, including study design, study
population, intervention, usual care, outcome measures used and
length of follow-up data, using a specially designed data extraction
form based on the EPOC template (EPOC 2009). We contacted
study authors to ask for missing information or clarification. We
used information from data extraction forms to guide the extrac-
tion of numerical data for meta-analysis in Review Manager 5.2
(RevMan 2012).
We presented data from RCT and CBA studies using the format
suggested in the EPOC Working Paper on presentation of data
(EPOC 2009).

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (CH and CC) independently assessed the
internal validity of each study included in this update and resolved
discrepancies by discussion.
We used the tool of The Cochrane Collaboration for assessing
risk of bias (Higgins 2011) based on six standard criteria: ade-
quate sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinded or
objective assessment of primary outcome(s), adequately addressed
incomplete outcome data, freedom from selective reporting and
freedom from other risks of bias. We used three additional criteria
specified by EPOC (EPOC 2009): similar baseline characteris-
tics, reliable primary outcome measures and adequate protection
against contamination. We reported all included studies in the
Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tables.
Two review authors (CH and CC) used the GRADE (Grades
of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each
primary outcome included in the ’Summary of findings’ table (
Guyatt 2008). The qualityof the bodyof evidence foreach primary
outcome was rated according to the five GRADE considerations
(study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness
and publication bias).
Measures of treatment effect
We measured the effect of the intervention by referencing pub-
lished tools used to measure inappropriate prescribing as well
as tools used to assess appropriateness of prescribing as outlined
above, for example, MAI and Beers criteria. We reported out-
comes for each study in natural units. When baseline results were
available from studies, both preinterventionand postintervention
meansandproportionsforstudyandcontrol groupswere reported.
We analysed data using RevMan 5.2. When possible, results were
presented with 95% CIs and estimates for dichotomous outcomes
(e.g. number of participants receiving appropriate polypharmacy)
as risk ratios.
Unit of analysis issues
We critically examined the methods of analysis of all study types.
When studies with a unit of analysis error were identified, the
data were reanalysed with exclusion of such studies (sensitivity
analysis).
Dealing with missing data
We assessed the methods used in each included study to deal with
missing data. Any study with a differential loss to follow-up be-
tween groups greater than 20% was excluded from meta-analysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed reporting bias by scrutinising study results using the
’Risk of bias’ tables provided in RevMan 5.2. We examined funnel
plots corresponding to meta-analysis of the primary outcome to
assess the potential for small-study effects such as publication bias.
Data synthesis and investigation of heterogeneity
Methods utilised to synthesise the studies depended on their qual-
ity, design and heterogeneity. We pooled the results of studies if at
least two studies were homogeneous regarding participants, inter-
ventions and outcomes. We grouped studies and described them
according to type of intervention, setting and study design, and
we performed an assessment of evidence on the theoretical basis
for each of the approaches described.
In the presence of statistical heterogeneity (greater than 50%, as
estimated by the I2 statistic), we applied a random-effects model
for meta-analysis. For pooling, we considered only groups of stud-
ies of the same design (RCTs and CCTs).
When it was not possible to combine outcome data because of
differences in reporting or substantive heterogeneity, we provided
a narrative summary.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis for pooled results based on
methodological quality to assess the overall effect. For example,
studies with a unit of analysis error or high risk of bias were ex-
cluded from the analysis.
Ongoing studies
We described ongoing studies identified during completion of
the review and provided details such as primary author, research
question(s) and methods and outcome measures, together with an
estimate of the reporting date in the Characteristics of ongoing
studies table appended to this review.
Studies awaiting classification
Studies for which sufficient information was not available to de-
termine eligibility for inclusion in this review have been allocated
to the Studies awaiting classification section.
Summary of findings
We used Summary of findings for the main comparison for the
main comparisons in the review to interpret results and draw con-
clusions about the effects of different interventions, including size
of the effects and quality of the evidence.

Results of the search
Updated electronic searches identified 2722 potentially relevant
citations (Figure 1). Following review of titles and abstracts,
67 full-text publications were retrieved for more detailed assess-
ment. Through searches of other sources, such as relevant reviews
(Appendix 3), including the list of ongoing studies provided in
the previous review (Patterson 2012) and the Clinical Trials Reg-
istry, as well as through contact with study authors, 11 additional
potentially relevant citations were identified and assessed.

 Of these, two studies met all other inclusion criteria (including
study design, study population, types of interventions examined)
and were added to the review.
Four pairs of publications referred to the same studies (see
Characteristics of excluded studies). Fourteen studies were ex-
cluded primarily because of an unsuitable design, for example, ob-
servational study, no control group. Twenty-five studies were ex-
cludedbecause of the outcome measure used(the primaryoutcome
beingthe change inprevalence of appropriate use of polypharmacy,
as measured by a validated instrument). One study was excluded
because it focused on a single long-term medical condition.
We excluded a further 21 citations consisting of conference ab-
stracts, protocols and summary reports because of the outcome
measure used and/or the absence of appropriate data. Based
on identified conference abstracts and published protocols, five
ongoing studies were identified (see Characteristics of ongoing
studies). Six additional studies are awaiting classification (see
Characteristics of studies awaiting classification).
Included studies
Two studies were added to this review (Dalleur 2014; Gallagher
2011), hence the total number of studies included is 12: Bucci
2003; Crotty 2004a; Crotty 2004b; Hanlon 1996; Schmader
2004; Spinewine 2007; Tamblyn 2003; Taylor 2003; Trygstad
2005 and Trygstad 2009. The North Carolina Long-Term
Care Polypharmacy Initiative was published as three studies
(Christensen 2004; Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009), but only two
of these studies (Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009) met the inclusion
criteria. As outlined below, data from each of the studies that were
added to the review could not be included in any form of meta-
analysis; therefore narrative descriptions of results are presented.
Details are provided in the Characteristics of included studies ta-
ble and are briefly summarised below.
Study design
Included studies consisted of eight RCTs (Bucci 2003; Crotty
2004b; Dalleur 2014; Gallagher 2011; Hanlon 1996; Schmader
2004; Spinewine 2007; Taylor 2003), two cluster RCTs (Crotty
2004a; Tamblyn 2003) and two controlled before and after studies
(Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009).
Settings
Of the seven studies (1489 participants) conducted in hospital
settings, three were conducted in hospital outpatient clinics (gen-
eral medicine, Hanlon 1996; heart function, Bucci 2003; geriatric
evaluation and management (GEM), Schmader 2004), one at the
hospital/home care interface (Crotty 2004b) and three in an in-
patient setting (Dalleur 2014; Gallagher 2011; Spinewine 2007).
Two studies (12,629 participants) were conducted in the primary
care setting at community-based family medicine clinics (Taylor
2003) and in GP practices (Tamblyn 2003). Three studies (8320
participants) took place in nursing homes (Crotty 2004a; Trygstad
2005; Trygstad 2009).
The included studies were carried out in five countries: Australia
(twostudies), Belgium(twostudies), Canada(two studies), Ireland
(one study) and the USA (five studies).
Participants
A total of 22,438 participants were included in this review. The
mean age of intervention group participants was 76.4 years and of
control group participants was 76.3 years. Equal proportions of
intervention and control group participants were female (65.6%).
Ethnicity was not reported in most of the studies; in the four stud-
ies (8685 participants) that did report this, 71.7% of participants
were white.
All study participants had more than one long-term medical con-
dition, and, on average, participants were receiving more than four
medicines at baseline. In 11 of the 12 studies for which data were
available (9878 participants), participants were prescribed a mean
of 9.4 (intervention) and 8.9 (control) medicines.
Common long-term care conditions among participants in the
studies included in this review were asthma, diabetes, dyslipi-
daemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (including conges-
tive heart failure) and dementia.
Interventions
In all cases, interventions were classified as organisational accord-
ing to EPOC definitions; none of the included studies was classi-
fied as professional, financial or regulatory.
Eleven studies examined complex, multi-faceted interventions of
pharmaceutical care in a variety of settings. Pharmaceutical care
is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of
achieving definitive outcomes that improve a patient’s quality of
life (Hepler 1990). Pharmaceutical care reflects a systematic ap-
proach that ensures patients receive the correct medicines, at an ap-
propriate dose, for appropriate indications. It involves pharmacists
moderating drug management in collaboration with physician,
patient and carer (Hepler 1990). One unifaceted study (Tamblyn
2003) examined CDS provided to GPs in their own practices.
Pharmaceutical care was commonly provided by pharmacists
working closely with other healthcare professionals in a variety of
settings. Inhospital settings, pharmacistsworkedas partof a multi-
disciplinary team in outpatient clinics (Bucci 2003; Hanlon 1996;
Schmader 2004), in inpatient services on hospital wards as a clin-
ical pharmacy service (Spinewine 2007) or as part of the hospital
discharge process (Crotty 2004b). In community settings, phar-
maceutical care services, including medication reviews, patient in-
terviews and counselling, were provided by pharmacists in com-
munity-based family medicine clinics (Taylor 2003). In nursing
homes, multi-disciplinary case conferences combined with staff
education were provided by pharmacists (Crotty 2004a), as was a
drugtherapymanagementservice (Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009).

Interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy for older people (Review)

 Physicians delivered the intervention via a computerised support
programme in one study (Tamblyn 2003), whereas in all other
studies, criteria-based processes were used to develop recommen-
dations for improving the appropriateness of prescribing to pre-
scribers.
Models of pharmaceutical care provided in the included studies
were complex and variable. In seven studies, the pharmacist(s) con-
ducted an independent medication review using participant notes
(Crotty 2004a; Crotty 2004b) or together with participants dur-
ing a face-to-face encounter (Bucci 2003; Hanlon 1996; Schmader
2004; Spinewine 2007; Tamblyn 2003; Taylor 2003). Following
medication review, recommendations were discussed with a multi-
disciplinary team during case conferences (Crotty 2004a; Crotty
2004b) or were discussed with prescribers and followed up by
written recommendations (Hanlon 1996) from multi-disciplinary
team members at the same outpatient clinic (Bucci 2003) or dur-
ing inpatient ward rounds (Spinewine 2007). In one study, the
pharmacist was an integral member of the multi-disciplinary team
(Schmader 2004) and contributed to the pharmaceutical aspect of
the care plan of participants at the point of decision making. In
two studies, consultant pharmacists performed a comprehensive
profile review of the computerised drug profiles of selected partici-
pants using a range of tools such as the Beers criteria and made rec-
ommendations to prescribers in nursing homes by fax, telephone
or written communication (Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009).
In two studies, participants’ medication lists were screened by a
geriatrician (Dalleur 2014) or by the primary research physician
(Gallagher2011) upon admission to hospital, and oral and written
recommendations outlining appropriate prescribing changes were
then provided to the attending physicians. In the Dalleur 2014
study, no pharmacist was available to collaborate with the inpatient
geriatric consultation team owing to lack of resources within the
hospital.
Participant education was provided as part of the pharmaceuti-
cal care intervention in four of six studies in which the inter-
vention was conducted face-to-face, and these participants were
given ’directive guidance’ and specialised medication scheduling
tools (e.g. monitored dosage systems) to encourage adherence to
their prescribed medication regimens (Bucci 2003; Hanlon 1996;
Spinewine 2007; Taylor 2003). Directive guidance describes phar-
maceutical care activities such as provision of information about
medications, their administration and their adverse effects (Bucci
2003).
Education was provided to prescribers and other healthcare pro-
fessionals included in the multi-disciplinary team as part of the
intervention in five studies (Bucci 2003; Crotty 2004a; Crotty
2004b; Hanlon 1996; Spinewine 2007); this occurred at case con-
ferences, during ward rounds or when evidence-based information
and answers to specific medication-related queries were presented.
In two studies in which the pharmacist was part of a multi-dis-
ciplinary team, no educational intervention was specified in the
methodology (Schmader 2004; Taylor 2003).
The timing of provision of the intervention was variable. In-
terventions were delivered over a period of time, for example,
during the hospital inpatient stay and at discharge (Schmader
2004; Spinewine 2007) or over several clinic visits and over several
months on an ongoing basis (Tamblyn 2003). Interventions were
also delivered at the time of an event, for example, following hospi-
tal admission (Dalleur 2014; Gallagher 2011), during attendance
at outpatient clinics (Bucci 2003; Hanlon 1996; Schmader 2004;
Taylor 2003), at nursing home visits (Crotty 2004a; Trygstad
2005; Trygstad 2009) or at hospital discharge to a nursing home
(Crotty 2004b). In studies for which details of intervention ad-
ministration were provided, interventions were most commonly
administered during a single episode of care (Bucci 2003; Crotty
2004a; Hanlon 1996; Tamblyn 2003; Taylor2003; Trygstad 2005;
Trygstad 2009). Interventions were provided over varying dura-
tions, ranging from five or six months (Bucci 2003; Trygstad 2005)
to three years and three months (Schmader 2004). Further details
of the interventions are detailed in the Characteristics of included
studies tables.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest in this review was the change
in prevalence of appropriate use of polypharmacy, as measured by
a validated instrument. Validated assessments of appropriateness
reported in all included studies were measured independently by
pharmacists, geriatricians or the research team, who had access
to participants’ charts and medication records, except in Trygstad
2005 and Trygstad 2009, where the Medicaid dispensed prescrip-
tion claims database was used. Time between delivery of the in-
tervention and follow-up outcome measurement varied from im-
mediately post intervention (e.g. post hospital discharge or clinic
visit) (Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007; Tamblyn 2003) to at
least one month (Bucci 2003), eight weeks (Crotty 2004b), zero
to three months (Crotty 2004a; Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009),
six months (Gallagher 2011) and up to one year (Dalleur 2014;
Hanlon 1996; Taylor 2003).
Eight studies measured appropriateness using the summated MAI
score post intervention (Bucci 2003; Crotty 2004a; Crotty 2004b;
Gallagher 2011; Hanlon 1996; Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007;
Taylor 2003). If it was not possible to calculate the change in MAI
from the results presented, study authors were contacted to pro-
vide the change in the summated MAI score. One study reported
the MAI score in terms of the number of prescriptions with in-
appropriate medications; this was unsuitable for inclusion in the
meta-analysis (Taylor 2003). The Beers list of criteria was used
to assess the appropriateness of medications post intervention in
four studies (Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007; Trygstad 2005;
Trygstad 2009), andone studyreportedthe numberof participants
with one or more Beers criteria drugs post intervention (Spinewine
2007). Data for the change in the number of Beers drugs were
not reported by the Spinewine 2007 study authors. Two stud-
ies used the STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Person’s Prescrip-
tions) criteria to screen for potentially inappropriate prescribing
13

 in hospitalised study participants (Dalleur 2014; Gallagher 2011).
Both studies reported the proportions of participants with at least
one potentially inappropriate medication, as identified using the
STOPP criteria post intervention. In the Gallagher 2011 study,
the START criteria were also applied, and the proportions of par-
ticipants with at least one potentially inappropriate prescribing
omission, as identified using the START criteria post intervention,
were reported.
One study measured appropriateness using the McLeod criteria
and reported the rate of inappropriate medications prescribed per
physician visit post intervention (Tamblyn 2003). No other vali-
dated criteria (e.g. Zhan) were reported.
Under-use of medication was reported in three studies (Gallagher
2011; Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007). Under-use defined as
’the omission of drug therapy indicated for the treatment or pre-
vention of established diseases’ (Lipton 1992) was measured using
the Assessment of Under-utilisation of Medication (AUM) instru-
ment (Jeffery 1999) in two studies (Gallagher 2011; Schmader
2004), whereas Spinewine 2007 used seven process measures from
the full range of Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elderly (ACOVE)
criteria (Wenger 2001), which relate to the inappropriate under-
use of medication.
Five studies measured hospital admissions by examining hospital
records at varying time points post intervention (Crotty 2004b;
Gallagher 2011; Spinewine 2007; Taylor 2003; Trygstad 2005)
ranging from eight weeks (Crotty 2004b; Spinewine 2007) to one
year (Taylor 2003).
Medication-related problems, a secondary outcome, were mea-
sured in six studies and were reported as medication misadven-
tures (defined as iatrogenic incidents that occur as a result of error,
immunological response or idiosyncratic response and are always
unexpected or undesirable to the participant) (Taylor 2003), po-
tential drug therapy problems (Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009) or
postintervention ADEs (Crotty 2004b; Hanlon 1996; Schmader
2004).
One study assessed adherence to medication via participant self-
report (Taylor 2003).
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the
Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form health survey (SF-
36) in two studies (Hanlon 1996; Taylor 2003).
Excluded studies
Excluded publications that were read in full are summarised along
with the reasons for exclusion in the Characteristics of excluded
studies table.
Studies of unsuitable design were excluded from this review (14
studies). Twenty-five studieswere excludedbecause of the outcome
measure used (the primary outcome was change in the prevalence
of appropriate use of polypharmacy, as measured by a validated
instrument). One study was excluded because it focused on a single
long-term medical condition.
A further 21 citations consisting of conference abstracts, proto-
cols and summary reports were excluded because of the outcome
measure used and/or the absence of appropriate data.
Risk of bias in included studies
Details of the risk of bias are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3
and in the Characteristics of included studies tables.

Allocation
Six trials reported adequate sequence generation (Bucci 2003;
Crotty 2004a; Crotty 2004b; Gallagher 2011; Hanlon 1996;
Schmader 2004), and three reported concealment of allocation
(Crotty 2004a; Crotty 2004b; Gallagher 2011).
Blinding
In six studies, blinded measurement of outcomes had taken place
to ensure that primary outcome assessors had no knowledge of the
intervention received by participants (Bucci 2003; Crotty 2004b;
Hanlon 1996; Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007; Trygstad 2009).
Incomplete outcome data
Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed in nine stud-
ies. In one study (Schmader 2004), 864 participants were ran-
domly assigned but only 834 were included in the analysis, and no
intention-to-treat analysis was reported. Therefore, it was unclear
whether all outcome data were included.
Selective reporting
One study (Trygstad 2009) did not report baseline data, and in
the Spinewine 2007 study, the authors failed to report one of the
secondary outcomes-’medications taken.’
Other potential sources of bias
The primary outcome measures used were reliable instruments in
all studies, for example, MAI kappa value = 0.84.
Participants in one study were protected from contamination
(Crotty 2004a). In six studies it was unclear whether protec-
tion against contamination had been provided (Dalleur 2014;
Gallagher 2011; Schmader 2004; Tamblyn 2003; Trygstad 2005;
Trygstad 2009), and the remaining studies were determined to
have high risk of contamination (Bucci 2003; Crotty 2004b;
Hanlon 1996; Spinewine 2007; Taylor2003). Contaminationbias
occurs when members of the control group are inadvertently ex-
posed to the intervention, thus potentially minimising differences
in outcomes between the two groups (Higgins 2011). This is an
important limitation for this review, where, in some studies, for
example, a pharmacist involved in the provision of pharmaceutical
16

 care to members of the intervention group may have inadvertently
modified the treatment of those in the control group as a result of
having knowledge of the intervention. The possible influence of
contamination bias should be considered when the results of this
review are interpreted.
Seven studies (Bucci 2003; Crotty 2004a; Crotty 2004b; Dalleur
2014; Gallagher 2011; Hanlon 1996; Schmader 2004) had suf-
ficient power to detect a meaningful effect size. Funnel plots of
postintervention estimates of the change in MAI and summated
MAI showed little evidence of publication bias (Figure 4; Figure
5).

Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
Pharmaceutical care compared with usual care for older people
receiving polypharmacy
Pharmaceutical care and CDS interventions included in this re-
view demonstrated a reduction in inappropriate polypharmacy.
Hospitalisations, as reported in five studies, were reduced in three
studies (Crotty 2004b; Taylor 2003; Trygstad 2009) (in one co-
hort, but not in the remaining nine cohorts), and two studies
(Gallagher 2011; Spinewine 2007) found no difference.
No consistent intervention effect on medication-related problems
was observed across studies (six studies); these problems were re-
ported in terms of ADEs (Crotty 2004b; Hanlon 1996; Schmader
2004), medication misadventures (Taylor 2003) and potential
drug therapy problems (Trygstad 2005; Trygstad 2009). Improve-
mentinadherence tomedicationwasdemonstrated(Taylor 2003),
but no changes in HRQoL (Hanlon 1996; Taylor 2003) were de-
tected.
Primary outcome results
As only one unifaceted study was included (Tamblyn 2003), a
subgroup analysis was not possible. Tamblyn 2003 also was not
included in the meta-analysis, as a different outcome measure was
used (McLeod criteria; McLeod 1997) that was not considered
similar enough to the other outcomes for data to be combined.
Change in the prevalence of appropriate use of
polypharmacy, as measured by a validated instrument
Change in summated MAI score
Two studies reported appropriateness of polypharmacy as the
change in the summated MAI score (Bucci 2003; Crotty 2004a),
and further unpublished data were received from the authors of
two studies (Crotty 2004b; Spinewine 2007). Two hundred ten
intervention participants and 214 control participants were in-
cluded in the analysis. Comparison of the change in summated
MAI score from baseline to follow-up between the intervention
group and the control group is shown in Analysis 1.1. Overall a
greater reduction in the summated MAI score was seen in the inter-
vention group compared with the control group (mean difference
-6.78, 95% CI -12.34 to -1.22). Marked heterogeneity between
studies was noted (I2 = 96%; P value < 0.00001). Crotty 2004a
reported a unit of analysis error; nursing homes were the unit of
18

 randomisation, but the analysis was conducted at the participant
level. A sensitivity analysis excluding Crotty 2004a showed a sim-
ilar change in summated MAI score (mean difference -7.75, 95%
CI -17.06 to 1.56, I2 = 97%) in favour of the intervention group
(Analysis 1.2) based on 178 intervention participants and 175
control participants. A further sensitivity analysis removing both
Crotty 2004a and Spinewine 2007 (an outlying study with a large
effect size that had a high risk of bias with respect to contami-
nation, allocation concealment and selective outcome reporting)
also showed a greater reduction in the summated MAI score of
the intervention group, but the magnitude of the difference was
smaller compared with previous analyses (mean difference -1.79,
95% CI -3.73 to 0.16, I2 = 39%) (Analysis 1.3).
Prevalence of appropriate use of polypharmacy post
intervention
Summated MAI score post intervention
Postintervention pooled data from five studies (Bucci 2003; Crotty
2004b; Hanlon 1996; Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007) with 488
intervention participants and 477 control participants showed a
lower summated MAI score (mean difference -3.88, 95% CI -5.40
to -2.35) in the intervention group compared with the control
group (see Data and analyses, Postintervention; Analysis 1.4). Lit-
tle evidence of heterogeneity between these estimates was found (I
2 = 0%). Gallagher 2011 also reported the summated MAI score
post intervention. These data were not included in the meta-anal-
ysis because it was skewed. Compared with the control group, the
median summated MAI score was lower in the intervention group
at discharge and at each assessment during the six-month follow-
up period (P value < 0.001).
MAI score-other
One study (Taylor 2003) expressed the MAI score as the number
of inappropriate prescriptions and thus could not be included in
the meta-analysis. The percentage of inappropriate prescriptions
decreased in all 10 MAI domains in the intervention group and
increased in five domains in the control group.
Beers criteria
Number of Beers drugs post intervention
Pooled data from two studies (Schmader 2004; Spinewine 2007)
with 298 intervention participants and 288 control participants
showed that intervention group participants were prescribed fewer
Beers drugs compared with control group participants post inter-
vention (mean difference -0.1, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.09, I2 = 89%)
(Analysis 1.5). The Trygstad 2009 study, which also reported the
number of Beers list drugs, comprised 10 cohorts. It was not in-
cluded in the meta-analysis, as study design, analysis and reporting
(e.g. using propensity matching, reporting results as difference-
in-difference) differed from the others, resulting in estimates that
were not sufficiently similar to support inclusion. We were unable
to ascertain the standard deviation of the results for Trygstad 2005,
which also was not included in the meta-analysis.
Number of participants with one or more Beers drugs
As well as the total number of Beers list drugs post intervention,
Spinewine 2007 reported the proportions of participants taking
one or more Beers list drugs before and after intervention. Similar
improvements were reported in the proportions of intervention
and control group participants receiving one or more Beers list
drugs between the time of hospital admission and discharge (OR
0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.1). As this was the only study to report
this measure of appropriate polypharmacy, meta-analysis was not
possible.
McLeod criteria
The McLeod criteria were used in one study (Tamblyn 2003) to
identify initiation and discontinuation rates of 159 prescription-
related problems. During the 13-month study period, the number
of inappropriate medications started by study physicians per 1000
visits was 43.8 (intervention) and 53.2 (control). The relative rate
of initiation of an inappropriate prescription for the intervention
group was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.98). Meta-analysis was not
possible, as these criteria were not used in other studies.
STOPP and START criteria
Two studies (Dalleur 2014; Gallagher 2011) used the STOPP cri-
teria to screen for potentially inappropriate prescribing in older
study participants admitted to hospital. Gallagher 2011 reported
lower (P value < 0.001) proportions of participants in the inter-
vention group compared with the control group, with one or more
STOPP criteria medications given for each of the postintervention
assessments (discharge; two, four and six months post discharge).
Dalleur 2014 reported that the reduction in the proportions of
participants with one or more STOPP criteria medications be-
tween the time of hospital admission and discharge did not differ
between intervention and control groups (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.49
to 4.89; P value 0.454). However, at group level, the discontinu-
ation rate of potentially inappropriate medications, as identified
using STOPP criteria, was higher in the intervention group com-
pared with the control group (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.24;
P value 0.013). Data from these two studies were not pooled be-
cause included participants were not considered to be homoge-
nous. Dalleur 2014 specifically targeted frail patients aged 75 years
19
Interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy for older people (Review)

 and older, whereas Gallagher 2011 included patients aged 65 years
and above.
In the Gallagher 2011 study, the START criteria were also used
to screen participants’ medication lists. For each of the postin-
tervention assessments (discharge, two, four and six months post
discharge), lower proportions of participants with one or more
START criteria medications were reported in the intervention
group compared with the control group (P value < 0.001). As this
was the only study to report the use of these criteria, meta-analysis
was not possible.
Under-use of medication
Two studies assessed under-use of medication using the AUM in-
dex (Gallagher 2011; Schmader 2004). In the Gallagher 2011
study, a greater reduction was seen in the proportion of interven-
tion group participants with prescribing omissions post interven-
tion, as identified using the AUM index, compared with the con-
trol group (absolute risk reduction 21.2%, 95% CI 13.3 to 29.1).
In the Schmader 2004 study, a reduction in the number of con-
ditions with omitted drugs was observed post intervention in the
intervention group relative to the control group; the difference in
change in AUM score was -0.3 (P value < 0.0001). As the two
studies assessed under-prescribing on two different levels (i.e. par-
ticipant, medical condition), meta-analysis was not possible.
In the Spinewine 2007 study, the magnitude of the reduction in
ACOVE scores was greater in the intervention group (baseline
score 50.0, postintervention score 14.6; P value < 0.001) com-
pared with the control group (baseline score 58.9, postinterven-
tion score 44.4, P value 0.02), and intervention participants were
six times more likely than control participants to show at least one
improvement in appropriate prescribing based on these criteria
(OR 6.1, 95% CI 2.2 to 17.0). No meta-analysis was possible, as
this outcome measure was assessed differently from those in the
above two studies, and under-use was not reported in the other
studies.
Hospital admissions
Five studies measured hospital admissions post intervention
(Crotty 2004b; Gallagher 2011; Spinewine 2007; Taylor 2003,
Trygstad 2009). Two studies (Gallagher 2011; Spinewine 2007)
reported no difference in hospitalisations between intervention
and control group participants, and the remaining studies reported
some overall reductions in hospital admissions using a variety of
measurements, as detailed below.
Taylor 2003 reported a reduction in both the number of hospi-
tal admissions (P value 0.003) and the number of emergency de-
partment visits (P value 0.044) during the intervention year com-
pared with preintervention. Crotty 2004b reported less hospital
usage among participants who received the intervention and were
still alive at eight weeks post intervention compared with control
group participants (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.99).
However, analysis of all participants including deaths and losses to
follow-up showed similar hospital usage in the intervention and
control groups (-9 (16.7%) with intervention vs -15 (26.8%) with
control; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.21). Trygstad 2009 showed
a reduction in the RR of hospitalisation in one cohort of nursing
home residents receiving retrospective-only-type medication re-
views (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00; P value 0.04). The remain-
ing eight cohorts also had an RR below 1.0; however, confidence
intervals for the individual point estimates crossed the line of no
effect.
Because of differences in methodology in the measurement of
hospital admissions and the expression of results, a meta-analysis
was not possible for studies reporting hospital admissions.
Inappropriate medication was also reported by these studies. In the
study by Trygstad 2009, the Beers list was used to measure inap-
propriate medication, but no reductions were observed in the co-
horts receiving retrospective medication review. In the remaining
four studies, appropriateness of prescribing improved, as shown
by reductions in MAI scores, but the association with hospitalisa-
tions was inconsistent.
Secondary outcome results
Medication-related problems in older people (e.g. adverse
drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, medication errors)
Medication-related problems were reported in six studies using
different terms. No consistent intervention effect on medication-
related problems was noted across studies.
Three studies reported medication-related problems as ADEs
(Crotty 2004b; Hanlon 1996; Schmader 2004). Schmader 2004
showed that the risk of a serious ADE was reduced (RR 0.65, 95%
CI 0.45 to 0.93; P value 0.02) in a geriatric outpatient clinic com-
pared with usual outpatient care; however, no difference in the
risk of an ADE was noted when all types of ADEs were considered
(RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.23; P value 0.75). The other two
studies (Crotty 2004b; Hanlon 1996) showed no differences be-
tween proportions of intervention and control group participants
with ADEs at follow-up.
Taylor 2003 reported medication-related problems as medication
misadventures. Proportionsof interventiongroup(2.8%)andcon-
trol group (3.0%) participants with at least one medication mis-
adventure at 12 months were similar (P value 0.73).
Potential medication problems categorised as ’consider duration’
(of therapy), ’clinical initiatives’ and ’therapeutic duplication’
were reported in the two North Carolina initiative studies (see
Characteristics of included studies tables; Trygstad 2005; Trygstad
2009). At three months, duration alert rates were reduced by 6.3%
in the intervention group (n = 5160) and by 16.7% in the con-
trol group (n = 2202); clinical initiatives were reduced by 10.8%
20
Interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy for older people (Review)

 in the intervention group and 0.7% in the control group, and
therapeutic duplication was reduced in the intervention group by
9.4% and in the control group by 8.8% (Trygstad 2005). Control
group results were not reported separately in Trygstad 2009. At
three months, duration of therapy alerts were reduced by 27.8%
(mean difference in the difference (mDID) = -0.023; P value >
0.05); clinical initiative alerts were reduced by 13.9% (mDID = -
0.24; P < 0.05); and therapeutic duplication alerts were reduced
by 5.6% (mDID = -0.087; P value > 0.05) (Trygstad 2009).
Adherence to medication
One study (Taylor 2003) reported adherence to medication in
terms of compliance scores, calculated through assessment of par-
ticipants’ reports of missed doses. Those with medication compli-
ance scores of 80% to 100% increased by 15% at 12 months from
a mean (± standard deviation (SD)) of 84.9 ± 6.7% to 100% in
the intervention group (n = 33), but the control group (n = 36)
did not change from 88.9% ± 5.8% at baseline to 88.9% ± 6.3%
at 12 months (P value 0.115).
Quality of life (as assessed by a validated method)
Two studies (Hanlon 1996; Taylor 2003) assessed HRQoL. No
differences in HRQoL scores (SF-36) were observed between
groups at baseline or at endpoint.
Quality assessment-the GRADE approach
Based on the GRADE approach (Guyatt 2008), the overall quality
of the body of evidence for each primary outcome for which data
were included in a meta-analysis was deemed to be low or very
low. Although each study included in the meta-analyses was of a
randomised design, and, where assessed, no evidence of publica-
tion bias was found (Figure 4; Figure 5), the quality of the body
of evidence was downgraded for each outcome based on other
GRADE considerations (i.e. study limitations, consistency of ef-
fect, imprecision, indirectness).
The quality of the body of evidence for the summated MAI score
post intervention was downgraded to low. Serious design limita-
tions with implications in terms of selection bias, reporting bias
and risk of contamination bias were identified in several studies.
It was also found that some studies answered a restricted version
of the research question, as a validated assessment of under-pre-
scribing was not included as part of the overall assessment of pre-
scribing appropriateness. Therefore, interventions did not directly
target appropriate polypharmacy.
The quality of the body of evidence for the change in MAI score
was downgraded to very low. Similar issues were identified to those
in studies evaluating the summated MAI score post intervention
in terms of design limitations and a restricted version of the re-
search question. Evidence showed heterogeneity (I2 = 89%) and
imprecision, whereby the pooled effect estimate had a 95% CI
that was wide and/or crossed the line of no effect.
The quality of the body of evidence for the number of Beers drugs
per participant post intervention was downgraded to very low.
Serious design limitations were identified in both studies, with
implications in terms of risks of selection bias and contamination
bias. Evidence showed heterogeneity (I2 = 96%) and imprecision
in the pooled effect estimate.

Summary of main results
The addition of only two studies to this updated review highlights
the lack of intervention studies of suitable quality that have been
conducted to date aimed at improving appropriate polypharmacy
in older people. The two studies that were added to this update
had little impact on the overall findings of the review, as it was
not possible to include data from either study in a meta-analysis.
Overall, the studies included in this review were limited by their
small sample sizes and poor quality.
The summated MAI was one of the measures of appropriate medi-
cation used in the studies to indicate appropriateness of polyphar-
macy in older people. Four of the 10 included studies were pooled
inameta-analysisof the change inthe summatedMAI; thisshowed
improvement in the appropriateness of polypharmacy (Analysis
1.1). Postintervention summated MAI results of five studies that
were pooled in a meta-analysis (Analysis 1.4) also appeared to indi-
cate that pharmaceutical care interventions improved appropriate
polypharmacy. This was consistent with postintervention results
of the Gallagher 2011 study, which were not included in the meta-
analysis because the summated MAI scores were skewed. Little ev-
idence of heterogeneity was noted in the effect of the interventions
on the summated MAI score (I2 = 0).
ChangesinsummatedMAIscore resultswere normallydistributed
and were more suitable for meta-analysis, but greater heterogene-
ity was noted among the included studies (I2 = 96%), largely
because of the influence of the results of one study (Spinewine
2007). Overall, the reduction in the intervention group summated
MAI score was greater than that in the control group. A sensitivity
analysis in which Crotty 2004a was removed because of a unit of
analysis error showed further improvement in the effect estimate
when compared with the meta-analysis. Furthermore, removal of
an outlying study with a large effect size (Spinewine 2007) reduced
heterogeneity but also reduced the effect estimate. This may have
been related to the small sample size for this meta-analysis (82
intervention participants and 85 control participants). When the
two studies were combined using the number of Beers list drugs
per participant as a measure of appropriateness (Schmader 2004;
Spinewine 2007), differences between intervention and control
21

 groups in the number of Beers list drugs per participant favoured
the intervention group. However,this difference is unlikely to have
any clinical significance. Data from two studies (Dalleur 2014;
Gallagher 2011) that used the STOPP criteria to screen for poten-
tially inappropriate medications could not be included in a meta-
analysis because participants were not considered to be homoge-
nous. No consistent intervention effect was seen between the two
studies in terms of the proportions of intervention and control
group participants with one or more STOPP criteria medications.
Only one study (Gallagher 2011) used the START criteria to
screen for potentially inappropriate prescribing omissions. Three
studies measured the under-usage of medication using two differ-
ent assessment tools; the AUM index (Gallagher 2011; Schmader
2004) and the ACOVE criteria (Spinewine 2007). Each of these
studies reported improvement in the under-usage of medication,
but study results could not be included in a meta-analysis because
of differences in the assessment measures used and in reporting of
results.
The various endpoints of inappropriate medication score consid-
ered in this review are surrogate markers; future studies should
focus on clinical outcomes such as hospital admissions. Only five
studies reported hospitalisations, and we were unable to combine
these results, as the reporting styles were different.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Types of interventions included in the review were limited. Few
trials aimed to improve the skills of the prescriber. Most inter-
ventions were pharmaceutical care interventions, which included
outreach by pharmacists, screening of automated drug alerts by
consultant pharmacists visiting nursing homes and clinical phar-
macist interventions in various settings. Only one trial that in-
volved CDS was identified. The interventions were complex and
most were multi-faceted. Variation in heterogeneity observed in
the pooled estimates should be treated cautiously as the interven-
tions did not seem to work consistently across all studies, perhaps
because of differences in how the interventions were provided,
background practice and culture and variable processes in delivery
of care. In addition, study-specific factors, such as variation in the
quality of studies, may have played a role. The methods sections of
studies provided little detail on how complex interventions were
developed, how trials were designed and how staff were trained in
delivery of the intervention. Other information pertinent to the
success of pharmaceutical care interventions including documen-
tation, communication and sharing of information and extent of
access to clinical records given to intervention pharmacists was not
stated clearly in the papers.
Although a promising result was obtained, suggesting that the in-
terventions described in this review were successful in improving
appropriateness of polypharmacy, the clinical impact of this is not
known. The summated MAI score is a weighted average of the in-
dividual process scores of 10 criteria for each prescribed drug. For
each criterion, the index includes operational definitions, explicit
instructions and examples, and the evaluator rates whether the
particular medication is ’appropriate,’ ’marginally appropriate’ or
’inappropriate’. Each medication can score between zero and 18,
representing the range of medication appropriateness from com-
pletely appropriate to completely inappropriate. Although the re-
moval of any inappropriate medication (with a resultant improve-
ment in appropriate polypharmacy) is beneficial, it is unclear to
what extent a reduction in the magnitude of 3.88 in the summated
MAI score represents a clinically significant reduction in the risk
of harm. However, improvement in validated assessment scales,
such as the MAI, is important, as the quality of prescribing is as-
suming increasing importance as a means of preventing avoidable
medication-related harm.
Evidence of potential bias was found in some studies, for example,
only three studies reported adequate concealment of allocation,
and only two reported appropriate protection from contamina-
tion, both of which may have influenced the effect estimate in
these studies and therefore the overall pooled estimate.
Few rigourously conducted studies have tested interventions and
examined clinically relevant outcomes such as hospital admissions
or ADEs. Five studies in this review reported hospital admis-
sions post intervention (Crotty 2004b; Gallagher2011; Spinewine
2007; Taylor 2003; Trygstad 2009), and four studies (Crotty
2004b; Gallagher 2011; Spinewine 2007; Taylor 2003) reported
that the appropriateness of prescribing improved, as was shown
by reductions in the MAI, although the association with hospital
admissions was inconsistent. In the fourth study (Trygstad 2009),
no difference was found in the number of Beers list alerts post in-
tervention, but the relative risk of hospitalisation was reduced. Use
of different appropriateness scales in the included studies made it
difficult for researchers to assess the impact of any improvement
in medication appropriateness on hospital admissions. Similarly,
some associations between measures of appropriateness and med-
ication-related problems appeared to exist but were difficult to as-
sess because of variation in scales used to measure outcomes and
in reporting methods.
The aim of the intervention studies included in this review was to
reduce harm subsequent to the prescription of too many medicines
and to ensure that older people are prescribed appropriate medi-
cations that enhance their quality of life. However, several studies
focused on reducing the number of medications, rather than im-
proving overall appropriateness of prescribing, including under-
prescribing, that is, recommending medications that are clinically
indicated yet are currently missing. Such under-treatment is a rel-
evant outcome with clinical relevance (Aronson 2004; Gurwitz
2004) that is not often studied.

 Quality of the evidence and potential biases in the
review process
A limited number of studies were included in this review, as a
paucity of studies in this area used validated instruments to mea-
sure the appropriateness of prescribing. The number of studies
that could be combined in the meta-analyses was small. For ex-
ample, the meta-analysis based on the number of Beers drugs per
participant included just two studies (Analysis 1.5). As shown in
the Summary of findings for the main comparison, the quality
of evidence presented in this review, as described by the GRADE
approach, was low or very low. Despite inclusion of data from
randomised trial designs in the meta-analyses, the quality of the
body of evidence was subsequently downgraded when each of the
GRADE considerations (i.e. study limitations, consistency of ef-
fect, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias) was taken into
account. This limits our confidence in the pooled effect estimates.
Based on observed heterogeneity in the pooled effect estimates
(Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.4), the findings of meta-analyses related
to MAI scores (change in MAI, summmated MAI post interven-
tion) should be treated cautiously, as the interventions did not
seem to work consistently across all studies. Factors contribut-
ing to this heterogeneity could have included variation in type,
intensity and duration of interventions, as well as differences in
the timing of follow-up assessments. In addition, study-specific
factors such as variation in study quality may have played a role.
However, no systematic approach was used to ensure a consistent
level of detail in published reports of the interventions. For ex-
ample, the methods sections of the studies provided little detail
on the development of complex interventions, trial design or staff
training in delivery of interventions. Other information pertinent
to intervention success, such as documentation, communication
and intervention pharmacists’ level of access to clinical records,
was not clearly reported in the papers. The specific processes that
constituted successful interventions was often unclear, which may
have contributed to heterogeneity in effect estimates.
No language restrictions were placed on the search strategy, but
all of the included trials were published in English and were con-
ducted in developed countries. Despite the limited number of
studies included in the meta-analyses, funnel plots of studies re-
porting MAI-related outcomes revealed no apparent publication
bias (Figure 4; Figure 5).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Other systematic reviews have reported that the most influential
factor affecting the results of pharmaceutical care interventions is
the way that interventions were conducted, for example, face-to-
face consultations with physicians achieved a greater reduction in
the number of medications taken than was achieved by written
recommendations (Rollason 2003). Another narrative review re-
ported that timely provision of the intervention, that is, prospec-
tive advice at the time of prescription rather than at the time of
dispensing of medication, is more effective (Spinewine 2007a).
A recent and related Cochrane review of interventions to opti-
mise prescribing for older people in care homes (Alldred 2013)
found no evidence of an intervention effect on any of the pri-
mary outcomes, which included adverse drug events and hospi-
tal admissions. Other studies of interventions conducted across a
variety of settings have also been unable to detect the effects of
pharmaceutical care on these outcome measures (Holland 2007;
Spinewine 2007a). One systematic review (Kaur 2009) revealed
that the most successful types of interventions used to reduce in-
appropriate prescribing in older people were those that had multi-
disciplinary involvement including a geriatrician, utilised CDS or
had mandatory pharmaceutical services or drug restriction policies
in place. Results of this current review largely support the findings
described above, as most of the pharmaceutical care interventions
involved a multi-disciplinary component, and the CDS interven-
tion study (Tamblyn 2003) reported a positive result.

Implications for practice
Evidence obtained when results of these studies were combined is
rather weak, and it is unclear whether interventions provided to
improve appropriate polypharmacy, such as pharmaceutical care,
resulted in clinically significant improvement. Uncertainty sur-
rounds the effects of such interventions on hospital admissions and
medication-related problems, and it could be argued that these are
the critical outcomes for patients. However, these interventions
appear beneficial in terms of reducing inappropriate prescribing
and encouraging proper use of medications.
From the results of this review, we can recommend that phar-
maceutical care appears to improve prescribing for older patients
receiving polypharmacy, especially when a multi-disciplinary el-
ement is included in the provision of care (Bucci 2003; Crotty
2004a; Crotty 2004b; Gallagher 2011; Hanlon 1996; Schmader
2004; Spinewine 2007; Taylor 2003). In addition, although only
one study was included in this review, CDS appears to be a helpful
intervention for improving appropriate polypharmacy (Tamblyn
2003).
Given the difficulties involved in applying the results of clinical
studies to older people, physicians should carefully consider their
sources of evidence and recommendations to find the right balance
between avoiding the ’risk/treatment paradox’ (high-risk older pa-
tients denied safe medications capable of materially improving sur-
vival or quality of life) and avoiding inappropriate use of medica-
tions for which risks are likely to outweigh benefits (Scott 2010).
Based on the findings of our updated review, we are still uncer-
tain about which elements of the intervention processes constitute
23

 success in improving appropriate polypharmacy, and a number of
questions remain unanswered. For example, is it sufficient to pro-
vide the intervention during a single episode of care, or should pa-
tients be exposed to the intervention on a daily/weekly or monthly
basis? What is the optimal duration of an intervention, and should
interventions ideally be multi-faceted or unifaceted? It is clear that
control of processes to support fidelity and control of the chosen
interventions is critical. Staff training is important to ensure con-
sistency; the receptiveness of prescribers, patients and staff in var-
ious settings will have an impact on the uptake and effectiveness
of interventions in older people.
Implications for research
Overall, the quality of the studies in this review was poor, and
further research should attend to rigour in study design. More
research is needed to test whether existing tools for comprehen-
sive medicationreview(e.g.the hyperpharmacotherapyassessment
tool (HAT tool) (Bushardt 2008) and other similar interventions)
can improve appropriate polypharmacy. A two-stage process of
simple screening at drug level only (this could be automatically
generated by computer, e.g. Christensen 2004) followed by appli-
cation of a more comprehensive tool such as the MAI by clinically
trained personnel, allowing detection of clinical problems through
clinical knowledge and access to patients and/or medical records,
may be beneficial.
Uncertainty about which elements of the intervention are criti-
cal to successful outcomes needs to be addressed. On the basis of
the studies included in this review, this poses challenges, as de-
tails of intervention development and delivery were lacking. Meth-
ods of specifying and reporting complex interventions, as well as
their implementation strategies, are necessary to strengthen the
evidence base required for interventions to be more effective, im-
plementable and replicable across different settings (Michie 2011;
Proctor 2013). Future intervention studies targeting appropriate
polypharmacy could benefit from guidance provided by the frame-
work of the Medical Research Council on the design of complex
interventions (MRC 2008). This framework recognises the im-
portance of the initial stage of intervention development, in which
evidence and theory are used to inform the selection of relevant
components before the intervention is piloted, and the feasibility
of delivering it in practice is assessed. These initial stages precede
formal evaluations seeking to establish the effectiveness of the in-
tervention. Careful documentation of development of the inter-
vention and of the training and background of providers that may
be critical to the effectiveness of the intervention is essential for fa-
cilitating replication of successful interventions in practice. The re-
cently published TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description
and Replication) checklist offers useful guidance that may assist
the reporting and replication of future interventions (Hoffmann
2014). A systematic approach to the reporting of future interven-
tions could facilitate comparisons between studies and could help
to reduce, or account for, heterogeneity between effect estimates.
The frameworkof the Medical Research Council (MRC 2008)also
outlines the potential application of qualitative methodologies,
such as semi-structured interviews, to involve users and to gain in-
sights into the processes of change that underlie the intervention.
For example, establishing the reasons why not all interventions
are accepted may be enlightening and may support research into
the development of more successful interventions. There appears
to be a ceiling effect (approximately 75%) whereby inappropriate
prescribing continues despite the evidence base of interventions
(Furniss 2000; Zermansky 2006). Qualitative interviews of pre-
scribers may uncover reasons as to why they did not accept inter-
ventions (e.g. timing or appropriateness of provision of the inter-
vention, the expertise of providers). Additionally, poor prescrib-
ing practice must be explored and understood with the goal of
learning how to improve it and how to enhance patient safety by
reducing the need for intervention. The importance of these in-
vestigations extends beyond the research context alone. Given the
high financial expenditure that has been attributed to potentially
inappropriate prescribing in older people (Bradley 2012; Cahir
2010), it is likely that policy makers will continue to be interested
in the costs of these types of interventions.
The importance of behaviour change in increasing the uptake of
evidence into practice is increasingly recognised. For example, an
overarching theoretical framework known as the theoretical do-
mains framework (TDF) has been developed to simplify psycho-
logical theory relevant to behaviour change to make it accessible
to those involved in implementation research (Michie 2005). The
TDF has been used in a number of different contexts to date,
including exploratory interview studies conducted to identify be-
liefs that reflect barriers to, and enablers of, behaviour change,
which can be used to guide behavioural change intervention de-
sign (Francis 2012). Such an approach could potentially serve to
address the notable lack of theoretically informed interventions
that has been identified in this review and in other reviews related
to healthcare practice (Colquhoun 2013; Davies 2010).
In the previous version of this review (Patterson 2012), we recom-
mended that future studies could consider relevant risk factors for
polypharmacy including demographic factors, such as race and ed-
ucation (Fillenbaum 1996); health status, poorer health and access
to health care (Hajar 2007); and multiple providers of health care
(Espino 1998) and numbers of healthcare visits (Jörgensen 2001),
in designing interventions. We recommended that future stud-
ies should utilise clearer definitions of appropriate polypharmacy
because the term ’polypharmacy’ can be both negative and posi-
tive, and this duality of meaning makes objective research difficult
(Bushardt 2008). This subject has recently drawn attention with
publication of a report by the King’s Fund in the UK (King’s Fund
2013). This report discussed the need to reconsider current defi-
nitions of polypharmacy on account of the increasing numbers of
medications being prescribed to patients and recommended that
24

 polypharmacy should be defined as appropriate (i.e. medicine use
has been optimised and medicines prescribed according to best ev-
idence) or problematic (i.e. medicines have been prescribed inap-
propriately or intended benefits have not been realised). Although
the potential benefit of having a simple means of identifying pa-
tients at particular risk for inappropriate prescribing and adverse
effects was acknowledged, the authors of the King’s Fund report
noted that existing thresholds used to define polypharmacy, such
as four or five or more medicines, may be too low. A pragmatic
approach was proposed to identify patients warranting medication
review, which focused on particular patient groups (e.g. patients
receiving ≥ 10 regular medicines, patients receiving four to nine
medicines with other risk factors).
Publication of the King’s Fund report (King’s Fund 2013) coin-
cided with the abstract screening process in the update of this
review. Therefore, for the purpose of this update, the definition
of polypharmacy was not changed from that used in the original
review. Future updates of this review may reconsider the criteria
used to define polypharmacy while taking into consideration that
the threshold of four or more regular medicines may be too low,
and that it would be preferable to consider the overall appropri-
ateness of therapy as opposed to the number of medications alone.
Using the definition of appropriate polypharmacy proposed in
the King’s Fund report (King’s Fund 2013), we recommend that,
in seeking to improve appropriate polypharmacy in older people,
future intervention studies should ensure that under-prescribing
is also targeted. It should be accepted that appropriate polyphar-
macy is not just about reductions in numbers of drugs but rather
includes the prescription of medication appropriate to the needs
of patients. However, many of the studies included in this review
focused solely on reducing the numbers of medications prescribed
without assessing prescribing omissions. As validated tools to as-
sess potentially inappropriate prescribing in older people, such as
Beers criteria, are not specifically designed to measure appropriate
polypharmacy, it is important that future interventions should in-
clude assessments of potentially inappropriate omissions/under-
prescribing with the goal of improving appropriate polypharmacy.
Perhaps most critically, the selection of clinical and humanis-
tic outcomes appropriate for older people (e.g. hospitalisations,
ADEs) will be important to consider in future studies. Quality of
life is difficult to measure in the older co-morbid population, espe-
cially given longitudinal changes in this outcome, and the SF-36
may not be the most appropriate tool (McHorney 1996). Strate-
gies for improving the evidence base for older patient care have
been reviewed by Scott 2010.
The judgement as to whether many (appropriate polypharmacy)
or too many (inappropriate polypharmacy) medications are used
is difficult. The complexity of the clinical situation, patient at-
tributes and wishes and the individuality of prescribing for older
complex patients will remain a challenge in this regard. Develop-
ment of a new, universal, easily applied, valid and reliable out-
come measure to evaluate effectiveness of interventions should
be a priority for future research. Ideally this measure should be
globally applicable across various healthcare and cultural settings;
for example, STOPP and START are validated instruments that
may go some way toward fulfilling this need (Gallagher 2008).
Although research on the use of STOPP and START criteria is still
at a relatively early stage, these criteria have received support from
the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society and are posed for
wider application in future research (Hill-Taylor 2013). Both of
the studies included in this update applied the STOPP criteria
(Dalleur 2014; Gallagher 2011). Gallagher 2011 also applied the
START criteria. The START criteria offer a promising strategy to
decrease under-prescribing (Cherubini 2012) and, combined with
the STOPP criteria, could serve to improve appropriate polyphar-
macy in older people.
A number of other important developments have occurred re-
garding screening tools to assess prescribing in older people
since the original version of this review was published. Two new
tools-the RASP (Rationalisation of Home Medication by an Ad-
justed STOPP list in Older Patients) instrument (Van der Linden
2014 [pers comm]) and the FORTA (Fit fOR The Aged) list
(Kuhn-Thiel 2014)-have been validated. Two studies that are
awaiting classification (Muth 2010; Van Der Linden 2013) em-
ployed screening tools that were not used previously in studies in-
cluded in this review (i.e. PRISCUS list, RASP instrument). Data
from such research will aid practitioners in identifying preferred
criteria (Levy 2010).
Finally, it is important that sufficient detail about the context
in which complex interventions are conducted, such as those in-
cluded in this review, is reported and understood, so the transfer-
ability of complex interventions can be assessed (Wells 2012). For
example, heterogeneity among the fitness levels of older people
(Spinewine 2007a) means that translational research and retest-
ing of successful interventions may be necessary in dissemination
to new populations, as a population of quite healthy 70-year-old
people may respond differently to an intervention compared with
a group of very frail 92-year-old individuals.

Bucci 2003
Methods
Study design: RCT (block design, using a computerised randomisation scheme)
Unit of allocation/analysis: participant
Follow-up: 1 month after intervention
Duration: unclear
Providers: pharmacists
Participants
Setting/participants: 80 participants (39 intervention and 41 control) enrolled at a hos-
pital clinic at the University Health Network Toronto General Hospital, Canada
Focus on polypharmacy: mean number of medications at baseline 7.6 intervention, 6.0
control
Age (mean): 56.4 years intervention, 60.2 years control
Male: 78.9% intervention, 78% control
Ethnicity: no information given
Interventions
The intervention involved receipt of pharmacist services, that is, functioning as part of a
healthcare team,meetingparticipants’ drug-relatedneedsandensuringcontinuityof care.
Specifically, this involved the pharmacist reviewing the appropriateness of drug therapy,
making recommendations for change and providing information about medications,
their administration and their adverse effects
Those randomly assigned to the non-intervention group received usual care from other
clinic staff
Outcomes
Participant outcomes were assessed by the research assistant pharmacist at baseline and
at follow-up using the MAI and the directive guidance scale
Appropriateness of prescribing was determined by preintervention and postintervention
mean MAI scores
The Purdue Pharmacist Directive Guidance score rated the guidance provided by the
pharmacist. Directive guidance is described as pharmaceutical care activities such as
providing information about medicines, their administration and their potential to cause
adverse effects
Notes
The participant chart was reviewed by a research assistant pharmacist who was blinded to
the intervention, and information required to assess the appropriateness of medications
was abstracted. A summated MAI score was determined for each participant at least
1 month after the intervention. Follow-up took place at a scheduled clinic visit or by
telephone

Interventions
A medication review was conducted before a multi-disciplinary case conference. The res-
ident’s GP
, a geriatrician, a pharmacist, carers and a representative from the Alzheimer’s
Association of South Australia attended the case conferences, which were held at the
nursing home. At the case conference, care staff expanded on any issues in the case notes
that required discussion, and the Alzheimer’s representative discussed non-pharmaco-
logical management of dementia-related behaviour. A problem list was developed by the
GP in collaboration with the care staff
A half-day training workshop examining use of a toolkit in the management of challeng-
ing behaviours was provided to all facilities in the study, including control facilities
Outcomes
Medication appropriateness was assessed using the MAI. Change in MAI was reported.
All residents had their medication charts reviewed before and after the intervention by
an independent pharmacist
The Nursing Home Behaviour Problem Scale (NHBPS) was used to assess the effect of
the intervention on residents’ behaviour
Monthly drug costs for all regular medications on the government’s pharmaceutical
benefits scheme were calculated for all residents in the intervention and control groups

Crotty 2004b
Methods
Study design: single-blind RCT
Unit of allocation/analysis:participants
Follow-up: at 8 weeks
Duration: unclear
Providers: transition co-ordinator pharmacist, nurses
Participants
Setting/participants: 110 (56 intervention and 54 control) eligible patients making first-
time transition from a hospital to 1 of 85 long-term residential care facilities in Southern
Adelaide South Australia. Patients were eligible if they or their carer gave consent and
they had a life expectancy > 1 month
Focus on polypharmacy: the number of preadmission medicines was 6.6 intervention
group and 7.7 control group
Age (mean): 82 years (95% CI 80.2 to 83.7) intervention, 83.4 years (95% CI 81.7 to
85.1) control
Female: 58.9% intervention, 63% control
Ethnicity: non-English speaking background: 8.9% intervention, 5.6% control
Interventions
The intervention focussed on transferring information on medications to care providers
in long-term care facilities (first-time transition). When discharged from hospital to
long-term care facilities, participants’ family physicians and community pharmacists
were faxed a medication transfer summary compiled by the transition pharmacist. After
transfer, the transition pharmacist co-ordinated an evidence-based medication review
that was conducted by community pharmacists within 10 to 14 days of transfer
A case conference that involved the transition co-coordinator, the family physician, the
community pharmacist and the nurse was held within 14 to 28 days of transfer
Usual hospital discharge processwasreceivedbycontrolsand includeda standard hospital
discharge summary
Outcomes
The appropriateness of prescribing was measured using the MAI. A single score was
determined for each medication received. A total MAI score for each resident was calcu-
lated as a sum of MAI scores
Secondary outcome measures included unplanned visits to the emergency department
or hospital readmissions (grouped together as hospital usage), ADEs, falls, worsening of
mobility, behaviours, pain and increasing confusion

Follow-up: at discharge and 1 year after discharge
Duration: unclear
Provider: inpatient geriatric consultation team (IGCT)
Participants
Setting/participants: 146 (74 intervention and 72 control) frail patients ≥ 75 years of age

Female: 58.1% intervention, 68.1% control
Ethnicity: no information given
Interventions
In the intervention group, geriatricians used 64 STOPP criteria (‘Duplicate drug classes’
was not considered) to systematically screen the list of medications being taken by par-
ticipants on admission for potentially inappropriate medications and provided oral and
written recommendations to the ward physician during hospitalisation for discontinua-
tion of potentially inappropriate medications. Participants also received standard IGCT
care
Participants in the control group received standard care from the IGCT. Control partic-
ipants’ medications were routinely reviewed by the IGCT geriatrician, using an implicit
approach (i.e. no explicit tool was used)

Ethnicity: no information given
Interventions
The primary research physician applied STOPP/START criteria to baseline data of par-
ticipants in the intervention group on admission to identify potentially inappropriate
prescriptions and prescribing omissions. These were immediately discussed with the at-
tending medical team, and discussion was followed up by written communication within
24 hours. Intervention recommendations comprised simple statements highlighting po-
tentially inappropriate prescriptions according to relevant STOPP/START criteria. The
attending physician judged whether these recommendations should be accepted and
prescribing changes implemented. Medication changes were included in the discharge
summary to the intervention participants’ general practitioners

Interventions
The intervention consisted of the provision of pharmaceutical care from admission to
discharge by a clinical pharmacist. A pharmacist was present 4 days per week and par-
ticipated in medical and multi-disciplinary rounds, had direct contact with participants
and carers and had access to participant medical records. For every participant, the phar-
macist performed a medication history on admission and prepared a participant record
with clinical and pharmaceutical data. Appropriateness of treatment was analysed, and a
pharmaceutical care plan was prepared. Whenever an opportunity to optimise prescrib-
ing arose, the pharmacist discussed this with the prescriber, who could accept or reject
the advice. The pharmacist answered all questions received from healthcare professionals
about medications. At discharge the pharmacist provided written and oral information
on treatment changes to the participant or carer, as well as written information to the
GP

Setting/participants: 107 primary care physicians with at least 100 participants, who
were 30 years of age or older, had practices in Montreal and spent at least 70% of the
week in fee-for-service practice were randomly assigned. Participants were 66 years of
age or older, had been seen on 2 or more occasions by the study physician in the past
year and were living in the community at the start of the study
Focus on polypharmacy: implied 35.6 intervention/33.8 control prescriptions per elderly
patient in the 18 months before the study date

Female: 61.2% intervention, 64.2% control
Ethnicity: no information given
Interventions
Each physician was given a computer, a printer, health record software and dial-up access
to the Internet. The software documented health problems and medications supplied.
For each participant, trained personnel developed a health problem list and documented
26 health problems related to targeted drug-disease contraindications and other health
problems
CDS group physicians downloaded updates of dispensed prescriptions from the Que-
bec beneficiary, medical-service and prescription claims database (Regie de l’assurance
maladie du Quebec (RAMQ)). Data were integrated into the participant’s health record
and were categorised as having been prescribed by the study physician or by another
physician. Alerts were instituted to identify 159 clinically relevant prescribing problems
among the elderly (McLeod 1997). Alerts appeared when the physician accessed the
record, when prescription record updates were downloaded from RAMQ and when cur-
rent health problems and prescriptions were recorded in the chart by the physician. They
identified the nature of the problem, possible consequences and suggested alternative
therapy in accordance with expert consensus

the basis of the pharmacists’ recommendations. Pharmacists were specifically trained to
evaluate a therapy’s indication, effectiveness and dosage, as well as the correctness and
practicality of directions, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, therapeutic
duplication and duration of treatment, untreated indications and expense
The pharmacist reviewed the medical record for medication-related problems, conducted
a chart review to ensure that information on drug therapy and allergies was accurately
documented, examined the medication history to determine compliance with and com-
plications of medications and provided comprehensive individualised participant educa-
tion, which included a brief review of the disease, important lifestyle modifications and
basic drug information. Pharmacists monitored participants’ responses to drugs and at-
tempted to improve compliance by consolidating medication regimens, reducing dosage
frequency, devising medication reminders and teaching participants techniques for us-
ing devices such as inhalers. In addition to this, a system was developed in which the
participant, the physician or the nurse reported suspected problems associated with drug
therapy. Participants, nurses and physicians were educated about the signs and symptoms
of medication misadventures

Interventions
An on-site drug profile review was completed by pharmacists. A toolkit with instructions
for documenting and screening criteria, used to flag drugs, was given to pharmacists.
Pharmacists were also provided with computer-generated drug profiles from Medicaid
pharmacy claims that displayed flags for patients and suggestions for modification of
drugs and classes of drugs. Drug profiles were a compilation of all drugs for which a
claim was paid in the 90 days before generation. regardless of the presence of an alert.
The first alert criterion was receipt of a drug widely considered to be inappropriate for
use in the elderly (Beers list drug). The second criterion was receipt of a drug on the
community care of North Carolina prescription advantage list (PAL), which encourages
substitution of a less expensive drug within a therapeutic class. The third criterion was
appearance of a drug on the clinical initiatives list, which includes 16 drugs that had
potential for quality improvement and cost savings. Pharmacists were asked to record
the result of the review and the result of the consultation with the prescribing physician.
If an intervention resulted in a drug therapy change of any type, the new drug, dose
and quantity were noted. Drug dose and quantity were also reported for each new drug
added for previously untreated indications

Interventions
Prescription drug records of all North Carolina nursing facilities were retrieved from
Medicaid claims databases for the period August 2002 to April 2003. This period en-
compassed the 90-day baseline, the 90-day intervention and the 90-day postintervention
periods to allow for a difference in difference (DID) with a comparison group study
method. Targeted (’value added’) drug regimen reviews (DRRs) were performed during
the routine monthly DRRs required by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA)
nursing facility guidelines. Drug claims data were used to create drug profiles that con-
tained cost- and quality-focussed alerts for patients with 18 or more drug fills in the 90
days immediately preceding the intervention. Computer algorithms were used to screen
profiles for 5 types of drug alerts: Beers drug alerts, prescription advantage list (PAL)
alerts, Clinical Initiatives alerts, duration alerts for specific drugs and therapeutic dupli-
cation alerts. Alerts were generated retrospectively from claims data and were provided
to consultant pharmacists for their retrospective reviews, together with residents’ most
recent drug claims profiles. These profiles were comprehensive in nature and considered
all drugs on a resident’s profile regardless of the presence or absence of an alert. The
prospective component of the study allowed a pharmacist to intervene and request a
drug change for new medication orders that came into the dispensing facility, using
the same alerting-targeting criteria developed for the retrospective, computer-generated
drug profiles. Some residents received only retrospective reviews and interventions, some
received only prospective interventions and some received both

Participants
Patient participants: English- or Spanish-speaking patients, aged 18 years or older, admitted to the general medicine,
family medicine, cardiology or orthopaedics services within the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC), a
tertiary academic health sciences centre, with one of the following diagnoses: hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, heart
failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes, or patients receiving oral anticoagulation
Interventions
Minimal intervention group: Participants will receive medication teaching throughout hospitalisation from the
pharmacy case manager. On the day of discharge, participants will receive a discharge medication list and a wallet card
containing all discharge medications. Participants will receive no further contact or intervention from the pharmacy
case manager
Enhanced intervention group: In addition to providing medication teaching to participants throughout hospitali-
sation, the pharmacy case manager will compile a detailed discharge care plan, which will be faxed to participants’
community physicians and community pharmacists. Participants will also receive a follow-up phone call from the
pharmacy case manager 3 to 5 days after hospital discharge. Problems identified during the follow-up phone call will
be communicated to participants’ community physicians or to the inpatient medical team, and an electronic report
of the follow-up call will be faxed to the community physician and the community pharmacist. The pharmacy case
manager will continue to communicate with participants and participants’ community healthcare providers at least
weekly until all identified problems have been resolved
Outcomes
Primary: medication appropriateness (modified version of Medication Appropriateness Index), guideline adherence,
adverse drug events (ADEs), hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, billing records for university and
community hospital admissions, unscheduled office visits, prescription costs
Secondary: medication adherence (pharmacy and self-reported data), inappropriate medications (Beers criteria),
physician and pharmacist feedback

Participants
Care homes for older people (average age > 65 years), registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) for
at least 6 months and not specifically for people (of all ages) with learning disability, sensory impairment, mental
health problems, physical disabilities and alcohol dependence. Care homes will also be excluded if they have received
a medication review service from the Primary Care Trust in the previous 6 months, if they receive the services of a
community geriatrician or if they are subject to investigation of the safeguarding of vulnerable adults
Interventions
Intervention homes will receive a multi-professional medication review at baseline and at 6 months, with follow-
up at 12 months. Control homes will receive usual care (support they currently receive from the National Health
Service) with data collection at baseline and 12 months
Outcomes
Primary: number of falls (mean number per participant per month), potentially inappropriate prescribing (number
of drugs matching STOPP criteria at each data collection point)
Secondary: medication costs (mean drug cost per participant-net ingredient costs for 28 days); utilisation of primary
care, secondary care and personal social services health professional time (general practitioner (GP), nurse and other);

Cluster RCT
Participants
Patient participants: patients aged 60 years and older, at least 3 chronic diseases affecting 2 or more organ systems
which require pharmaceutical treatment, at least 5 long-term prescriptions with systemic effects, health care provided
by general practitioner (at least 1 contact in most recent quarter), legally competent to sign any documents, able
to understand and participate in trial of own free will, able to fill out questionnaires and participate in telephone
interviews, able to provide written informed consent to participate in trial
Interventions
Complex intervention involving basic assessment of medicines (brown bag review) and checklist-based (MediMoL-
Medication Monitoring List) preconsultation interview on problems related to medicines (technical handling, po-
tential adverse drug reactions) and participants’ therapeutic aims conducted by a general practice-based healthcare
assistant; structured information provided by healthcare assistant to general practitioners to enable participants to
discuss their problems; computerised decision support system used by general practitioners to optimise medication
(to reduce number of inappropriate prescriptions, e.g. pharmaceutical interactions, renal dose adjustments, dupli-
cate prescriptions) and to prioritise medication in the physician-participant consultation while taking participants’
preferences into consideration
Outcomes
Primary: Medication Appropriateness Index score (time frame: 6 and 9 months from baseline)
Secondary (time frame: 6 months and 9 months from baseline): generic health-related quality of life (EQ-5D),
functional disability (VES-13), change in all-cause hospitalisation, observed and self-reported adherence, future life
expectancy/years of desired life, medication complexity, Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, severity of chronic
pain, satisfaction with shared decision making (Man Son Hing scale)

3 or more changes to medications during hospital stay; past history of medication-related problems; referred
to the medicines management clinic service by hospital doctor or clinical pharmacist because of concerns
about ability to manage medicines in primary care
Interventions
Medicines management outpatient service: Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive a new
customised clinical pharmacy service (medicines management clinic and follow-up phone calls)
Outcomes
Primary: time to hospital readmission (time frame: 12 months post discharge)
Secondary: number of hospital readmissions (time frame: 12 months post discharge); number of GP con-
sultations and GP home visits (time frame: 12 months post discharge); number of accident and emergency
visits (time frame: 12 months post discharge); Medication Appropriateness Index score (time frame: 4, 8
and 12 months post discharge), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) (time frame: every 4 months over
12 months post discharge); medication adherence assessments (time frame: 12 months post discharge), cost
utility analysis (time frame: 12 months post discharge)

Trial name or title
Reduction of Potentially Inappropriate Medication in the Elderly
Methods
Cluster RCT
Participants
Patient participants: aged 70 years and older, taking at least 6 different drugs on a regular basis, life expectancy
of at least 6 months (at the discretion of the treating primary care physician), legal competence, willingness
to comply with study arrangements (i.e. assessment in the primary care office, telephone interviews) and to
provide written informed consent, accessible by phone
Interventions
Written information sources (pocket-sized quick reference guide and comprehensive manual) containing
recommendations from the PRISCUS list of potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly will be
provided to general practitioners in the intervention arm. General practitioners will also be offered different
training opportunities, depending on their needs and requirements, to allow them to get familiar with
recommendations and to practice their application
Outcomes
Primary: proportion of participants per office with potentially inappropriate medication as defined by
PRISCUS list (time frame: after 12 months of follow-up)

Table 2. Updated Beers (2002) criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults: independent of diagnosis
or condition
Drug
Concern
Severity rating
(high or low)
Propoxyphene (Darvon) and combination
products
(Darvon with ASA, Darvon-N and Darvo-
cet-N)
Offers few analgesic advantages over parac-
etamol (acetaminophen), yet is associated
with the adverse effects of other narcotic
drugs
Low
Indomethacin (Indocin and Indocin SR)
Of all available NSAIDs, this drug pro-
duces the most CNS adverse effects
High
Pentazocine (Talwin)
Narcotic analgesic that causes more CNS
adverse effects, including confusion and
hallucinations, more commonly than other
narcotic drugs. Additionally, it is a mixed
agonist and antagonist
High
Trimethobenzamide (Tigan)
One of the least effective antiemetic drugs,
yet it can cause extrapyramidal adverse ef-
fects
High
Muscle
relaxants
and
antispasmodics:
methocarbamol (Robaxin), carisoprodol
(Soma), chlorzoxazone (Paraflex), metax-
alone (Skelaxin), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)
and oxybutynin (Ditropan). Do not con-
sider the extended-release formulation of
Ditropan XL
Most muscle relaxants and antispasmodic
drugs are poorly tolerated by elderly pa-
tients because they cause anticholinergic
adverse effects, sedation and weakness. Ad-
ditionally, their effectiveness at doses toler-
ated by elderly patients is questionable
High
Flurazepam (Dalmane)
This benzodiazepine hypnotic has an ex-
tremely long half-life in elderly patients (of-
ten days), producing prolonged sedation
and increasing the incidence of falls and
fracture. Medium- or short-acting benzo-
diazepines are preferable
High
Amitriptyline
(Elavil),
chlor-
diazepoxide-amitriptyline (Limbitrol) and
perphenazine-amitriptyline (Triavil)
Because of its strong anticholinergic and
sedation properties, amitriptyline is rarely
the antidepressant of choice for elderly pa-
tients
High
Doxepin (Sinequan)
Because of its strong anticholinergic and
sedating properties, doxepin is rarely the
antidepressant of choice for elderlypatients
High

 Table 2. Updated Beers (2002) criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults: independent of diagnosis
or condition
(Continued)
Meprobamate (Miltown and Equanil)
This is a highly addictive and sedating anx-
iolytic. Those using
meprobamate for prolonged periods may
become addicted and may need to be with-
drawn slowly
High
Doses of short-acting benzodiazepines:
doses greater than lorazepam (Ativan) 3
mg; oxazepam (Serax) 60 mg; iprazolam
(Xanax) 2 mg; temazepam (Restoril) 15 mg
and triazolam (Halcion) 0.25 mg
Because of increased sensitivity to benzodi-
azepines in elderly patients, smaller doses
may be effective and safer. Total daily doses
should rarely exceed the suggested maxi-
mum
High
Long-acting
benzodiazepines:
chlor-
diazepoxide (Librium), chlordiazepoxide-
amitriptyline (Limbitrol),clidinium-chlor-
diazepoxide (Librax), diazepam (Valium)
, quazepam (Doral), halazepam (Paxipam)
and chlorazepate (Tranxene)
These drugs have a long half-life in el-
derly patients (often several days), produc-
ing prolonged sedation and increasing the
risk of falls and fractures. Short- and in-
termediate-acting benzodiazepines are pre-
ferred if a benzodiazepine is required
High
Disopyramide (Norpace and Norpace CR)
Of all antiarrhythmic drugs, this is the
most potent negative inotrope and there-
fore may induce heart failure in elderly pa-
tients. It also has strong anticholinergic ef-
fects. Other antiarrhythmic drugs should
be used as well
High
Digoxin (Lanoxin) (should not exceed 0.
125 mg/d except when treating atrial ar-
rhythmias)
Decreased renal clearance may lead to in-
creased risk of toxic effects
Low
Short-acting dipyridamole (Persantine).
Do not consider the long-acting dipyri-
damole (which has better properties than
the short-acting formulation in older
adults) except with patients with artificial
heart valves
May cause orthostatic hypotension
Low
Methyldopa (Aldomet) and methyldopa-
hydrochlorothiazide (Aldoril)
May cause bradycardia and exacerbate de-
pression in elderly patients
High
Reserpine at doses > 0.25 mg
May induce depression, impotence, seda-
tion and orthostatic hypotension
Low
Chlorpropamide (Diabinese)
It has a prolonged half-life in elderly pa-
tients and could cause prolonged hypogly-
caemia. Additionally, it is the only oral hy-
poglycaemic agent that causes SIADH
High

GI
antispasmodic
drugs: dicyclomine (Bentyl), hyoscyamine
(Levsin and Levsinex), propantheline (Pro-
Banthine), belladonna alkaloids (Donnatal
and others)
and clidinium-chlordiazepoxide (Librax)
GI antispasmodic drugs have potent anti-
cholinergic effects and have uncertain ef-
fectiveness. These drugs should be avoided
(especially for long-term use)
High
Anticholinergicsandantihistamines:chlor-
pheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), diphenhy-
dramine (Benadryl), hydroxyzine
(Vistaril
and
Atarax),
cyproheptadine
(Periactin),
promethazine
(Phenergan),
tripelennamine, dexchlorpheniramine (Po-
laramine)
All non-prescription and many prescrip-
tion antihistamines may have potent an-
ticholinergic properties. Non-anticholiner-
gic antihistamines are preferred in elderly
patients for the treatment of allergic reac-
tions
High
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
May cause confusion and sedation. Should
not be used as a hypnotic, and when used to
treat emergency allergic reactions, it should
be used in the smallest possible dose
High
Ergot mesyloids (Hydergine) and cyclan-
delate (Cyclospasmol)
Have not been shown to be effective in the
doses studied
Low
Ferrous sulphate > 325 mg/d
Doses > 325 mg/d do not dramatically in-
crease the amount absorbed but greatly in-
crease the incidence of constipation
Low
All barbiturates (except phenobarbital) ex-
cept when used to control seizures
Are highly addictive and cause more ad-
verse effects than most sedative or hypnotic
drugs in elderly patients
High
Meperidine (Demerol)
Notaneffective oral analgesicindosescom-
monly used. May cause confusion and has
many disadvantages compared with other
narcotic drugs
High
Ticlopidine (Ticlid)
Hasbeenshowntobe nobetterthanaspirin
in preventing clotting and may be consid-
erably more toxic Safer, more effective al-
ternatives exist
High
Ketorolac (Toradol)
Immediate and long-term use should be
avoided in older people, as a significant
number have asymptomatic GI pathologi-
cal conditions
High
Amphetamines and anorexic agents
These drugs have potential for causing de-
pendence, hypertension, angina and my-

 A P P E N D I C E S
Appendix 1. The Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) and the Beers criteria
The MAI was designed to assist physicians and pharmacists in assessing the appropriateness of a medication for a given patient. The
MAI requires clinicians to rate 10 explicit criteria to determine whether a given medication is appropriate for an individual. For
each criterion, the index has operational definitions, explicit instructions and examples, and the evaluator rates whether the particular
medication is “appropriate,” “marginally appropriate” or “inappropriate” (Table 1).
The 10 explicit criteria are:
1. Indication: the sign, symptom, disease or condition for which the medication is prescribed.
2. Effectiveness: producing a beneficial result.
3. Dosage: total amount of medication taken per 24-hour period.
4. Directions: instructions to the patient for proper use of a medication.
5. Practicality: capability of being used or being put into practice.
6. Drug-drug interaction: the effect that administration of one medication has on another drug; clinical significance connotes a
harmful interaction.
7. Drug-disease interaction: the effect that the drug has on a pre-existing disease or condition; clinical significance connotes a
harmful interaction.
8. Unnecessary duplication: non-beneficial or risky prescribing of two or more drugs from the same chemical or pharmacological
class.
9. Duration: length of therapy.
10. Expensiveness: cost of drug in comparison with other agents of equal efficacy and safety.
These are measured on a 3-point scale (Table 1).
To assess the effects of the interventions on prescribing appropriateness, patient MAI scores may be determined by summing MAI
medication scores across all evaluated medications. Thus, this patient MAI score depends on the number of medications taken by the
patient and the MAI score per medication.
Furthermore, to determine a single summated score for each drug, in addition to an overall score for the patient, a weighting scheme
was developed. A weight of three was given for indication and effectiveness. A weight of two was assigned to dosage, correct directions,
drug-drug interactions and drug-disease interactions. A weight of one was assigned to practical directions, expense, duplication and
duration.
The Beers criteria are consensus explicit criteria used to enhance safe medication use in older adults when precise clinical information
is lacking (see Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5; Table 6). The Beers criteria are based on expert consensus developed through an
extensive literature review with a bibliography and a questionnaire evaluated by nationally recognised experts in geriatric care, clinical
pharmacology and psychopharmacology using a modified Delphi technique to reach consensus. These criteria have been used to survey
clinical medication usage, to analyse computerised administrative data sets and to evaluate intervention studies to decrease medication
problems in older adults.
The most recent version of Beers criteria (AGS 2012) comprises three lists. The first list comprises 34 individual medications or classes
of medications that should be avoided in older adults and their concerns (Table 4). The second list includes diseases or conditions and
drugs that should be avoided in older adults with these conditions (Table 5). The third list provides medications to be used with caution
in older adults (Table 6). The statements in each list are rated on the basis of quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations
using the American College of Physicians’ Guideline Grading System.

S Patterson (SP) prepared the protocol under the direction of C Hughes (CH), N Kerse (NK) and CR Cardwell (CRC). C Cadogan
(CC) and C Ryan (CR) were involved in updating the review. SP
, M Bradley (MB), CH, CC and CR are pharmacists, NK is a GP
and an experienced researcher with an interest in geriatric medicine and CRC is a biomedical statistician. MB, CH, NK, CR and CRC
have been involved in systematic reviews in other areas. SP undertook the database searches and reviewed the literature identified in

Asonlytwostudies(Bucci 2003; Crotty2004a)reportedthe primaryoutcome measure of change inthe appropriate use of polypharmacy,
we used postintervention results of summated MAI scores and the number of Beers drugs per participant in the meta-analyses to
compare the effect sizes of the interventions.
The search strategy was modified slightly from that used in the original review to avoid limiting the search unnecessarily. Based on a
recommendation made following the search development process for the previous review, the term ’polypharmacy’ was searched alone
(e.g. not combined with the concept of “age” using the Boolean operator “AND”) because most of the literature on polypharmacy
focuses on older populations.
Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index (via the Institute on Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science) and AARP
AgeLine were not searched for this update after a review of previously included studies revealed that they were not a reliable source of
studies for this topic.
