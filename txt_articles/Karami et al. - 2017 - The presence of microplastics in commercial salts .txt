commercial salts from different 
countries

The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in saltwater bodies is relatively well studied, but nothing is known 
about their presence in most of the commercial salts that are widely consumed by humans across the 
globe. Here, we extracted MP-like particles larger than 149 μm from 17 salt brands originating from 
8 different countries followed by the identification of their polymer composition using micro-Raman 
spectroscopy. Microplastics were absent in one brand while others contained between 1 to 10 MPs/Kg of 
salt. Out of the 72 extracted particles, 41.6% were plastic polymers, 23.6% were pigments, 5.50% were 
amorphous carbon, and 29.1% remained unidentified. The particle size (mean ± SD) was 515 ± 171 μm. 
The most common plastic polymers were polypropylene (40.0%) and polyethylene (33.3%). Fragments 
were the primary form of MPs (63.8%) followed by filaments (25.6%) and films (10.6%). According to 
our results, the low level of anthropogenic particles intake from the salts (maximum 37 particles per 
individual per annum) warrants negligible health impacts. However, to better understand the health 
risks associated with salt consumption, further development in extraction protocols are needed to 
isolate anthropogenic particles smaller than 149 μm.
Since their mass production in the 1950s, global plastic production has been increasing, which exceeded 322 
million tons in 20151. Mismanaged plastic waste could find their ways to oceans2. Meanwhile, continuous frag-
mentation of large plastic objects has resulted in the accumulation of smaller particles called microplastics (MPs, 
sized between 1 and 1000 μ 
m3,4). Also, MPs may be directly introduced to the aquatic environments through their 
primary sources (e.g., synthetic sandblasting media, cosmetic formulations, textiles)5–7. The widespread distri-
bution of MPs in aquatic bodies is well documented, such as in the Celtic sea8, Laurentian Great Lakes9, Persian 
Gulf10, and in sub-tropical gyres11. Accordingly, it is expected that products originating from the contaminated 
water bodies are also loaded with MPs.
Several studies have shown the presence of MPs in seafood products like clams12 and fish13. Therefore, the 
consumption of seafood products could be a significant route of exposure to MPs in humans. For instance, top 
European shellfish consumers are expected to ingest up to 11,000 plastic particles per annum14. Microplastics 
might be of health concern since they have been shown to carry hazardous chemicals15,16 and microorganisms17.
Despite the relatively well-documented occurrence of MPs in seafood products, little is known about MP loads 
in abiotic saltwater products, which are expected to inevitably contain contaminants from the water. Sodium is an 
essential element for the human body to maintain homeostasis and is mainly consumed as common salt (sodium 
chloride, NaCl)18. Commercial sea and lake salts are mainly produced through a crystallization process as a result 
of seawater evaporation or naturally occurring brine under the combined effects of sunlight heat and wind19,20. 
There are concerns over the potential transfer of water contaminants into sea salt after the crystallization and 
concentration process20. In the only available study on abiotic products, Yang et al.21 showed the presence of up 
to 681 MPs/kg in salts originating in China. However, the chemical composition of individual MP particles was 
not determined, with MP identification based instead on grouping the particles according to their morpholog-
ical features and analyzing representative samples through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR).

Nevertheless, visual sorting is not the most reliable method to identify MPs22,23 as this could significantly overes-
timate the concentration of anthropogenic materials. No report is available, however, on MP loads in salt samples 
from other regions of the world that are potentially consumed by around 6 billion people, excluding billions of 
other organisms such as cattle that need to consume salt on a regular basis24. In this study, we further investigated 
the presence of MPs by extracting particles from 17 different brands of salt originating from 8 countries over 
4 continents. Density separation and visual identification were employed to initially isolate MP-like particles. 
Finally, all particles were analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy for their chemical composition.
Results
The presence of a large quantity of white sediment in the lake salt from Malaysia (Table 1) blocked the 
149 μ 
m-pore size filter membrane. These particles were identified as calcium carbonate (CaCO3) using Raman 
spectroscopy. Therefore, this sample was excluded from MP analysis. A total of 72 MP-like particles were isolated 
from 16 salt brands. The average particle size (mean ± 
 SD) was 515 ± 
 171 μ 
m. The size of the smallest particle 
was 160 μ 
m and the largest sized 980 μ 
m. Figure 1 presents a histogram of the number of the particles sorted 
by size. As depicted by Fig. 2a, 30 particles (41.6%) were confirmed as plastic polymers, 17 particles (23.6%) 
were pigments, 21 particles (29.1%) were not identified, and 4 particles (5.50%) were non-plastic items (i.e., 
amorphous carbon). The major plastic polymers were PP at 40.0% of the total plastic polymers followed by PE 
(33.3%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET; 6.66%), polyisoprene/polystyrene (6.66%), polyacrylonitrile (10.0%), 
and polyamide-6 (nylon-6, NY6; 3.33%) (Fig. 2b). Particles identified as pigments were phthalocyanine (82.3%), 
chrome yellow (5.88%), hostasol green (5.88%), and hostaperm blue (5.88%) (Fig. 2c). The abundance of MPs per 
salt sample ranged from 0 per kg in the salt sample # France-F (i.e. Country of origin: France, brand F) to 10 in the 
salt sample # Portugal-N. Figure 3a and b are the stacked bar chart of the number of plastic polymer and pigment 
particles isolated from each salt brands, respectively.

With regards to the particle morphology, the predominant type were fragments (63.8%) followed by filaments 
(25.6%), and films (10.6%) (Fig. 4). No sphere beads were isolated from the salt samples. Figure 5 illustrates the

Discussion
In this study, we developed a simple and cost-effective protocol to isolate MPs from salt samples. The presence of 
insoluble particles quickly blocked the filter papers with pore sizes of 2.7, 8, and 22 μ 
m. Initially, we hypothesized 
that the blockage was due to the presence of organic materials. However, lack of changes on the filtration after 
KOH digestion showed the presence of digestion-resistant organic or inorganic materials. Therefore, dilutions 
with deionized water, followed by filtration through a membrane with a larger pore size (149 μ 
m), was the sim-
plest and quickest method to isolate MPs from the salt samples. Our recent study demonstrated a high efficcincy 
of 4.4 M NaI solution to separate (recovery rate > 
95%) plastic polymers from high-density particles like shell 
fragments from bivalves and sand grains3. To minimize the chance of overestimating or underestimating MP 
prevalence in the salt samples, in addition to NaI extraction, we implemented microscopical examination and 
Raman spectroscopy. Despite processing the samples through NaI extraction and visual identification, 5.50% of 
the particles were amorphous carbon (Supplementary Information Figure 1e), which underscores the necessity of 
using spectroscopic techniques to identify the chemical composition of the isolated particles. Micro-Raman spec-
troscopy is a highly specific technique used to identify the composition of biological, mineral or polymer samples. 
It offers a number of advantages such as analysis of microscopic particles while being non-invasive towards the 
samples23,25. In addition, Raman measurements do not depend on the transmission of light through the particle, 
which consequently allows an accurate analysis of thicker or pigmented particles23. Some of the earlier studies 
solely relied on the morphological characteristics of MPs, like shape and color to identify MPs in environmental 
samples26,27 while others partially confirmed the particle composition through a random selection of the isolated

particles21,28. Although observation is an indispensable part of polymer identification, it cannot be employed as a 
stand-alone technique for particle characterization because it is unlikely to be sufficient to identify the polymer 
type through morphological features.
Consistent with the findings of this study, fragments and filaments have been reported as the main form of 
MPs29,30. The absence of microbeads in the salt samples may indicate their low prevalence in aquatic environ-
ments. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the most abundant plastic polymers in the salt samples 
(40.0% and 33.3%, respectively) which is consistent with reports on their wide distribution in the marine envi-
ronment22. The presence of these polymers in salt samples could be due to the low density of PP (0.90–0.91 g/cm3) 
and PE (0.91–0.96 g/cm3) allowing these to float on the water surface and be readily directed into saltpans. 
In addition, their low density may facilitates their spread by becoming airborne. Polyisoprene/polystyrene 
(styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer) were the other detected synthetic polymers in the salt samples. These 
polymers are used when elasticity and easy processing is required, such as in adhesives and sealants31. A few 
isolated particles from the salt samples had a similar composition to their packaging. This might indicate degra-
dation of the packaging materials leading to the contamination of the salt product. Nevertheless, this hypothesis 
was rejected since all the fragments or films were highly corroded, indicating their long-term presence in the 
environment.
Almost one fourth of the isolated particles were identified as pigments (phthalocyanine, chromate yellow, and 
hostaperm blue) because the strong Raman signal of these pigments hindered the identification of plastic poly-
mers. Phthalocyanine is a synthetic pigment and is extensively used in the plastics industry32 and was the main 
pigment isolated from the salt samples (Fig. 2c). Hostaperm blue falls under the copper phthalocyanine chemical 
class and is an industrial dye that is mainly used in the plastics industry32. Victoria blue is commonly used as a 
coloring agent in polyacrylic fibers (Supplementary Information Figure 1a)30 that are mainly introduced to the 
marine environment through the washing of clothes after passing through sewage treatment plants34. Meanwhile, 
lead chromate (yellow) pigment is a toxic compound that has extensive applications in paints and plastic indus-
tries owing to its excellent light-fastness and low cost33,35. Earlier studies have attributed exposure to lead chro-
mate pigment with incidents of bronchial carcinoma36, cerebrovascular disease37, and nephritis38 in humans. 
However, the occurrence of only one particle of lead chromate pigment per Kg of salt # South Africa-Q, poses a 
negligible threat to the health of consumers.
Initially, we hypothesized that the pigment particles might be paint particles. However, since none of the 
extracted particles shared similar mechanical properties as paint particles like brittleness39, we suggest the 
absence of paint particle in the salt samples. Other than plastics, pigments are widely used in other materials 
like textile, rubber, and fiberglass40,41. Van Cauwenberghe et al. suspected that the particles identified as copper 
phthalocyanine, polychloro copper phthalocyanine, and permanent red in deep-sea sediments42, as well as copper 
phthalocyanines and haematite in bivalves14 to be plastic materials. Similarly, in this study we could confirm that 
the pigmented particles had an anthropogenic origin but could not ensure they were MPs.
In the present study, a significant portion (29.1%) of the particles was not identified by Raman spectroscopy. 
Photo-degradation and weathering are the two major factors suggested as the causes for variation in the spectro-
scopic spectra of polymers such as PVC23. Moreover, the presence of additives could alter the polymer spectra and 
hinder comparisons with the reference library23,42. Another reason for having unidentified samples is the lack of 
a comprehensive spectra library to identify mixed samples23.
Lake salt from Malaysia was excluded from MP analysis because this contained a large volume of sediments, 
which were later identified as CaCO3. Calcareous sedimentation is a common process occurring in lakes mainly 
due to the assimilation of carbon dioxide by photosynthesizing plants and/or seasonal temperature effects on 
the solubility of carbon dioxide and calcite43. It should be noted that the other lake salt (# Iran-I) did not contain 
calcareous sedimentation, which shows the variation in calcium contents among different lake salt brands.
In 2010, the global daily sodium consumption was 3.95 g/day (equivalent to 9.88–10.2 g salt/day44) corre-
sponding to 3.6 to 3.7 Kg salt per annum. The number of anthropogenic particles (MPs and pigments) detected 
in the salt samples ranged from 0 (sample # France-F) to 10 (sample # Portugal-N) MPs/Kg. Based on this data, 
humans could ingest a maximum of 37 plastic particles annually. This should take into account that this maxi-
mum value is based on the assumption that sea salt is the sole source of sodium intake. Other sources of sodium 
supply are food additives like monosodium glutamate and preservatives. Therefore, in real scenarios, the maxi-
mum MPs intake is probably even less than 37 particles.
Microplastics may cause adverse effects to organisms through causing micro injuries (mainly in the case of 
fragments)4 or the release of pollutants that had been sorbed during their prolonged incubation in the water. In 
the case of the latter, MPs have shown the ability to sorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs)45 and subsequently 
desorb them under simulated gut conditions46. However, recent studies have argued the lower importance of MPs 
as a vector for translocation of POPs to aquatic biota as compared to other routes like food and water15,16. Despite 
a potentially high concentration of POPs and other contaminants in MPs, the combination of their small particle 
size and low prevalence indicate that the consumption of sea salt does not appear to be a major route for the con-
taminant transfer into the human body as compared to other sources like water and food. Due to technical limita-
tions, however, we could only quantify the level of particles larger than 149 μ 
m. The prevalence of smaller particles 
in the salt samples, however, might be higher than the larger ones. Smaller sizes could facilitate their translo-
cation into other organs and, therefore, cause a higher degree of toxicity. For example, in a study by Lu et al.47, 
20 μ 
m polystyrene (PS) microspheres accumulated in the gills and gut of zebrafish (Danio rerio), while 5 μ 
m 
microbeads were incorporated into the gills and gut as well as liver. Further advances in isolation techniques are 
needed to quantify smaller MP particles before making a more accurate justification on the health impacts of sea 
salt consumption. However, it should be taken into account that salt is not the only edible item that has been shown 
to contain MPs. These have been previously detected in clams12, mussels14, fish13 and unexpectedly in honey48 as 
well as beer49. Therefore, the long-term consumption of various products containing MPs might become a concern.

Due to their low density and slow degradation, plastics are becoming the chief cross-border contaminant that 
often travels far from their original source. Hence, MPs found in the salt samples of one country could have been 
produced by another country thousands of miles away. A potential solution to this global dilemma requires a 
strong commitment from all the countries to make a substantial improvement in plastic disposal and recycling.
Conclusions
The results of this study did not show a significant load of MPs larger than 149 μ 
m in salts originating from 8 
different countries and, therefore, negligible health risks associated with the consumption of salts. The increasing 
trend of plastic use and disposal50, however, might lead to the gradual accumulation of MPs in the oceans and 
lakes and, therefore, in products from the aquatic environments. This should necessitate the regular quantification 
and characterization of MPs in various sea products.
Methods
Materials. 
A total of 17 brands of salt from Australia, France, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Portugal, 
and South Africa were purchased from a Malaysian market. NaCl (analytical grade) was purchased from Merck 
(Darmstadt, Germany), and sodium iodide (NaI), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and ethanol 95% were supplied 
by R&M Chemicals (UK). Solutions of NaI (4.4 M) and KOH (10% w/v) were prepared by dissolving the pow-
der/pellet in ultrapure deionized water. GF/D microfiber filter paper (pore size 2.7 μ 
m), and filter membrane 
No. 540 and 541 filter membranes (hardened ashless, pore size 8 and 22 μ 
m, respectively) were purchased from 
Whatman. The 149 μ 
m filter membranes were supplied by Spectrum Laboratories (USA). High-density poly-
ethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), PP, PS, PET, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), NY6, and nylon-66 
(nylon-66, NY66) virgin plastic fragments were supplied by Toxemerge Pty Ltd (Australia). About 10% of parti-
cles were sized below (D10) 40 μ 
m, 50% below (D50) 140 μ 
m, and 90% (D90) below 310 μ 
m.
Extraction method development. 
In an attempt to employ a solvent to dissolve the salt particles or effi-
ciently digest the organic materials, we compared digestion using a KOH solution3 with appropriate dilutions 
with deionized water. A 20 g sample of sea salt from sample # Australia-A was placed into a 250 mL DURAN 
glass bottle (Schott, Germany) sealed with a premium cap and pouring ring (Schott, Germany), and then 200 mL 
KOH solution or deionized water were added (1:10 w/v). The bottle was manually shaken until the full dissolution 
of salt. These solutions were then incubated at 40 °C for 48 h and were vacuum filtered through 2.7, 8, or 22 μ 
m 
membranes. Results showed that both solvents failed to pass through the 2.7, 8 or 22 μ 
m filter membranes owing 
to the presence insoluble or digestion resistant materials. Therefore, dilution with deionized water was used to 
dissolve salts due to its cost effectiveness, accessibility, and inertness to the plastic polymers. Next, another exper-
iment was run to find a filter membrane with the most suitable pore size.
Filtration optimization. 
Upon poor filtration of the salt solution (dissolved in water or digested with KOH 
solution) through a 22 μ 
m filter membrane, a series of sieves were individually used to identify the best pore size 
for filtration. Briefly, a solution of sea salt was prepared in deionized water (1:10 w/v) and added into different 
8-inch testing sieves-full height stainless steel frame and wire (pores sizes 38, 45, 53, 63, 90, 106, 125, or 150 μ 
m; 
 
Daigger Co., Vernon Hills, IL, USA) and mechanically shook on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 2 h. The salt 
solution could only fully pass through the 150 μ 
m pore size sieve. Therefore, disposable filter membranes with 
the nearest pore size to 150 μ 
m were chosen (Spectrum Laboratories, USA; Pores size: 149 μ 
m) for assessing MP 
loads in the salt samples.
Method validation. 
To validate the dilution method, 5 g of NaCl (analytical grade), 0.05 g of crushed shell 
from Asian green mussel (Perna viridis), 0.05 g of sand grains, and 0.1 g of HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET, PVC, NY6 
or NY66 were weighed on a scale (0.1 mg precision) and then added into a 100 mL laboratory bottle in triplicate. 
The bottles were filled with 50 mL deionized water and shook manually until the complete dissolution of salt. 
After that, they were vacuum filtered through 8 μ 
m-pore size filter membrane using a vacuum pump (Gast vac-
uum pump, DOA-P504-BN, USA) connected to a filter funnel manifold (Pall Corporation, USA). To separate 
the high-density particles (shell fragments and sand grains), the filter membrane was soaked in 10–15 mL of NaI 
(4.4 M, density: 1.5 g/cm3) in a 50 mL glass bottle and sonicated at 50 Hz for 5 min followed by agitation on an 
orbital shaker (200 rpm) for 5 min. Finally, the solution was centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant 
containing MPs was vacuum filtered through another 8 μ 
m filter membrane. To ensure the full isolation of MPs, 
this stage was repeated again. Finally, the filter membrane was placed into a clean glass Petri dish and dried at 
50 °C in an oven for 5 h.
No significant change was noticed in the weight of the filter membrane belonging to the procedural blank 
after filtration (Student’s t-test, p > 
 0.05) showing the full dissolution of NaCl. The recovery rates of all polymers 
were > 
 95%. Therefore, dissolution in deionized water followed by density separation using NaI was used to iso-
late MPs from the commercial salt samples (Fig. 6).
Extraction and characterization of MPs in the commercial salt samples. 
Extraction. One pack-
age of sea salt (200–400 g) was mixed with 2–4 L of deionized water in a 2 or 5 L laboratory bottle and then vac-
uum filtered through a filter membrane (pore size 149 μ 
m) to collect the insoluble materials. Between 3 and 5 salt 
packages (replicate) per brand were used to make a final weight of 1 kg. The filter membrane was placed into a 
50 mL laboratory bottle and was subjected to NaI treatment as described earlier. The pellet was re-suspended in 
10–15 mL of NaI, sonicated, agitated, and centrifuged to ensure the complete separation of MPs trapped within 
the insoluble materials.

Characterization. 
Visual selection of the extracted particles. The filter membranes were inspected using a 
Motic SMZ-140 stereomicroscope (Motic, China). Visual inspection was performed and MP-like particles were 
sampled based on their morphological characteristics like color and shape. However, low-density particles such 
as carbon-based materials, plant tissues, and remains of invertebrate exoskeletons could not be excluded through 
density separation. The remains of these invertebrates were mostly yellow, light brown, or black in color, and 
possessed a soft texture and an even surface with smooth edges. The plant-based materials were dark brown or 
black. Extra care was taken when sampling the brown and black particles due to their similarity in appearance 
to non-plastic items. Microplastic-like particles were divided into foam (lightweight particles with spongy tex-
ture), fragments (jagged and irregular shape particles which often have an uneven surface), fibers/filaments (thin, 
straight and often cylindrical particles), films (thin plane of flimsy particles), or beads (rounded particles)51. The 
selected particles were photographed using a camera apparatus (AxioCam, ERc 5S, Germany). To measure the 
size of particles, digital images were examined using ImageJ software. Because of the irregularity of most of the 
isolated particles, sizes of the largest cross-section was measured.
Raman spectroscopy. Particles were analyzed over a range of 150 to 3000 cm−1 using a Raman spectrometer 
(Horiba LabRam HR Evolution) equipped with a Single Mode Open Beam Laser Diode (Innovative Photonic 
Solutions) operating at a wavelength of 785 nm coupled with a charge-coupled device detector (Horiba Synapse). 
The experimental conditions were adapted as much as possible to limit fluorescence and increase the spectral 
quality of the measured particles. Another laser line (514 nm) was tested but due to the high level of fluorescence 
in the visible range, the laser 785 nm was selected, even though some fluorescence was still observed using this 
wavelength. The acquisition time and number of accumulations were adjusted for each scan such that the detec-
tor did not saturate and that the signal to noise was sufficient for performing a library search. A high numerical 
aperture objective (100X with NA 0.90) was used to increase the signal collection. The confocal hole was par-
tially closed to limit the collection of the fluorescent background. The laser power was set low (below 3 mW) to 
avoid burning or damaging the material. The low power of the laser did not permit complete efficient bleaching; 
however, since the acquisition time and the number of accumulations were increased whenever necessary, some 
photobleaching occurred while accumulating.
Before the library search, to reduce noise and enhance the spectrum quality without losing subtle spectral 
information, each spectrum passed through a baseline correction and denoising procedure (Labspec 6, Horiba 
Scientific). Pre-processed spectra were then evaluated and compared to the following spectral libraries: Raman 
polymers and monomers from Bio-Rad Sadtler and Raman Forensic from Horiba using the KnowItAll software 
from Bio-Rad. The Correlation algorithm (KnowItAll, Bio-Rad) was used to evaluate each query spectrum to 
the spectra of the databases. The Hit Quality Index (HQI) was used to rank the results of a spectral search. The 
HQI, which was scaled between 0 and 1000, indicates how well each spectrum from the database matches the test 
spectrum. The HQIs > 
 700 were accepted as evidence of a reliable match between the unknown and the reference 
spectrum. Furthermore, to investigate the possibility of MP leakage from the packing material to the salts, the 
chemical composition of the plastic packaging was also determined.
Contamination prevention. 
To avoid contamination, cotton lab coat and nitrile gloves were worn at all 
times. All liquids (deionized water, ethanol) were filtered through 2.7 μ 
m glass fiber filter membranes. The glass-
ware were washed once with dishwashing liquid, then with deionized water, and finally with ethanol. The work

surface was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol. Procedures were carried out in a horizontal laminar flow 
cabinet (Model AHC- 4A1-ESCO) to prevent contamination with airborne MPs. One procedural blank contain-
ing only filtered deionized water was tested simultaneously during the extraction procedure and another proce-
dural blank containing only the NaI solution was tested simultaneously during the density separation process, to 
account for any potential contamination.
