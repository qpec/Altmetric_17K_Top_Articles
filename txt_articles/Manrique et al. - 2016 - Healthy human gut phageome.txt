The role of bacteriophages in influencing the structure and function
of the healthy human gut microbiome is unknown. With few
exceptions, previous studies have found a high level of heteroge-
neity in bacteriophages from healthy individuals. To better estimate
and identify the shared phageome of humans, we analyzed a deep
DNA sequence dataset of active bacteriophages and available
metagenomic datasets of the gut bacteriophage community from
healthy individuals. We found 23 shared bacteriophages in more
than one-half of 64 healthy individuals from around the world.
These shared bacteriophages were found in a significantly smaller
percentage of individuals with gastrointestinal/irritable bowel dis-
ease. A network analysis identified 44 bacteriophage groups of
which 9 (20%) were shared in more than one-half of all 64 individ-
uals. These results provide strong evidence of a healthy gut
phageome (HGP) in humans. The bacteriophage community in the
human gut is a mixture of three classes: a set of core bacteriophages
shared among more than one-half of all people, a common set of
bacteriophages found in 20–50% of individuals, and a set of bacte-
riophages that are either rarely shared or unique to a person. We
propose that the core and common bacteriophage communities are
globally distributed and comprise the HGP, which plays an important
role in maintaining gut microbiome structure/function and thereby
contributes significantly to human health.

T
he human body supports a diverse community of microorganisms,
the majority of which are thought to be bacteria residing in the
lower gastrointestinal tract (1–4). A “healthy gut microbiome (GM)”
concept, where similar, but not the same microbes provide common
functions that promote human health is supported by metagenomic
sequencing of microbes and comparative analyses of gene content
(3). The healthy-GM structure is conserved among individuals at
higher taxonomic levels (especially phylum) (2, 4), and a core GM at
the species level shared by more than 90% of the individuals. Shared
bacterial species have been proposed to form a “core bacterial
community” that provides beneficial functions (3). This concept,
however, is based almost entirely on bacterial sequence data and, with
few exceptions (5–8), has not considered the role of bacteriophages.
Gut bacteria host a diverse bacteriophage community (phageome)
that potentially helps determine microbial colonization and contrib-
utes to shaping GM structure and function. The active phageome of a
healthy human (i.e., actively replicating as opposed to nonreplicating,
integrated prophage) has been estimated to comprise 35–2,800
viruses (6, 8), the vast majority of which have no significant sequence
homology to known bacteriophages. Although the phageome was
found to be relatively stable within a person (6–8), comparative
phageome analysis at a global scale has received little attention.
To address large-scale phageome overlap, we assembled meta-
genomic reads from a novel, deep bacteriophage dataset from stool
samples of two healthy individuals and analyzed currently available
data from 62 healthy people around the world. This analysis identified
23 bacteriophages that were present in more than one-half of all in-
dividuals. We then applied a sequence-based viral community network
tool (9) to identify closely related viruses at higher taxonomic levels.
This analysis identified 44 bacteriophage groups, of which 9 (20%)
were shared across more than one-half of individuals around the
globe. We propose shared bacteriophages as a healthy gut phageome
(HGP) and that, together with their core bacterial hosts, play an es-
sential role in maintaining GM function in the healthy human gut.
Results
Previous studies that identified a core GM in healthy people
showed that increasing the depth of sequencing was critical to de-
tect shared bacterial species (3). Thus, we conducted an ultradeep
baseline study of the active human gut phageome of two healthy,
unrelated adults at two sampling intervals (15 or 3 mo). We focused
our efforts on DNA bacteriophages because of their relevance to
host bacteria and because most (>95%) RNA viruses in the human
gut are likely plant viruses (10). Total DNA was extracted from
stool samples as well as purification of virus-like particles (VLPs).
TEM analysis of VLPs showed a high concentration of head-tailed
bacteriophages consistent with their taxonomic classification in the
Caudovirales order (Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae).
Microviridae bacteriophages were also identified, and no eukaryotic
virus sequences were found. 16S rDNA-based metagenomics (11)
of total stool DNA confirmed that the bacterial community of both
individuals was typical of healthy human adults, dominated by
Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes. Also, as expected, the GM structure
was stable between time points. Unlike previous studies, DNA
extracted from VLPs was sequenced without prior amplification to
avoid potential amplification bias. Sequencing yielded a total of
8.1 Gb of data, representing one of the most in-depth human gut
phageome studies to date, even after deduplication of reads (Table
Significance
Humans need a stable, balanced gut microbiome (GM) to be
healthy. The GM is influenced by bacteriophages that infect
bacterial hosts. In this work, bacteriophages associated with the
GM of healthy individuals were analyzed, and a healthy gut
phageome (HGP) was discovered. The HGP is composed of core
and common bacteriophages common to healthy adult individ-
uals and is likely globally distributed. We posit that the HGP
plays a critical role in maintaining the proper function of a
healthy GM. As expected, we found that the HGP is significantly
decreased in individuals with gastrointestinal disease (ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease). Together, these results reveal a large
community of human gut bacteriophages that likely contribute
to maintaining human health.

 S1). Rank abundance analysis indicated that sufficient sequencing
depth was achieved per sample to detect dominant bacteriophages
(Figs. S1 and S2).
Four individual active phageome datasets were assembled to-
gether resulting in 4,301 contigs (ALL). A total of 70 complete
circular and 2 nearly-full length linear phage genomes, based on
end sequence comparison were identified (Table S2; referred to as
“complete” genomes). The remaining contigs were potentially
complete or partial phage genomes. On average, 73% (range, 66–
79%) of sequencing reads from each sample assembled into the
ALL contigs, demonstrating a relatively even contribution from
both individuals. Consistent with previous studies (6, 8), the di-
versity of the phage community was low (Shannon diversity index =
4.25; SD = 0.95), and the phage distribution was similar in each
person, being dominated by a few phages, with no more than 115
genomes accounting for 75% of the normalized reads (Fig. S1). A
total of 1,703 of the 4,301 contigs (40%), and 63 of the 72 (88%)
complete genomes contained at least one ORF with homology to a
phage protein demonstrating their viral origins. However, only 314
(7%) of ALL contigs contained a family taxon-specific phage
orthologous group (mostly to Caudovirales). This indicates that the
majority (60%) of active bacteriophages in the GM are novel, with
only a limited subset that can be taxonomically classified. Taken
together, this approach was successful in assembling complete
phage genomes and showed the expected community structure.
To maximize the identification of shared phages between our
two test subjects, reads from the four samples were mapped to the
ALL contigs. Recruitment of a single read was used as evidence of
phage presence in a particular sample, allowing the identification of
both high- and low-abundance phages that were not originally as-
sembled due to low coverage. As has been shown previously (6, 8),
phageome structure was more similar within individuals over time
[Bray–Curtis (BC) distance = 0.47; SD = 0.24] than between in-
dividuals (BC distance = 0.96; SD = 0.01). However, 17% of ALL
contigs were present in both individuals in at least one time point,
and 7% were present in both individuals at all time points. Of the
72 complete genomes, 56 (78%) were found in both individuals.
These results reveal that there is a smaller but significant fraction of
phage sequences shared between these two unrelated test subjects.
Given the high level of interindividual phageome variability
previously reported, the identification of significant phageome
overlap between our two test subjects was surprising, but consistent
with the existence of a core microbial community identified by
others (3, 12). This result led us to investigate the presence of ALL
contigs in other human gut phageome datasets. The dataset by
Norman et al. (7) was selected for comparison based on the large
number of healthy (n = 62) and diseased subjects (n = 102), their
geographic distribution, and the sequencing depth achieved (Table
S1). The dataset was deduplicated, and 11% of the total reads were
mapped to ALL contigs (Table S3). In total, 1,787 of the 4,301
ALL contigs (42%) were present in at least one person from the
Norman dataset; 1,679 (39%) were present in 2–19% of people
(termed “low overlap” bacteriophages), 132 (3%) were detected in
20–50% (termed “common” bacteriophages), and 23 (0.5%) were
present in >50% (termed “core” bacteriophages) (Fig. S2). Of the
72 complete genomes from our two subjects, 10 (14%) were core
and 23 (32%) were common bacteriophages (Fig. 1). One of the
core bacteriophages is the recently identified “crAssphage” (13).
Our independent identification of crAssphage supports the ro-
bustness of our approach and highlights the discovery of a signifi-
cantly expanded set of core GM bacteriophages. Given their
prevalence, we refer to both core and common bacteriophages as
the “healthy gut phageome,” or HGP. It is important to note that
the 155 bacteriophages comprising the HGP represented only 4%
of the estimated total bacteriophage community, and we presume
that a larger set of HGP bacteriophages will be discovered with
increasing sequencing depth of additional individuals. Also, the
observation that some HGP members were detected by a single
sequencing read suggests that they are either rare members of the
GM or that the sequencing depth of the Norman dataset was too
low to accurately estimate their true presence (Fig. S3). Regardless,
these results support the presence of a broadly distributed HGP in
healthy human adults.
To add confidence to these results, we reversed the process by
first independently assembling the bacteriophage community from
healthy individuals within the Norman dataset, followed by read
recruitment from all of the individuals. We observed the same
general findings. Of the 13,707 bacteriophage contigs from the 62
Norman healthy individuals, 1,408 (9%) were found in more than
20% of the individuals and 115 (0.83%) were found in more than
50% of the individuals. The average size of these contigs was 7 kb,
compared with 32 kb of the HGP bacteriophages from our ALL
dataset. This suggested that these contigs could be partial frag-
ments from the core and common bacteriophages identified in the
two test individuals. When we compared the HGPs from the two test
individuals with the Norman HGP, we identified all of the HGP
bacteriophages initially identified in our ALL set. Of the 1,408 shared
bacteriophages in the Norman dataset, 1,013 (71%) were highly re-
lated to the HGP. We also identified additional potential core bac-
teriophages (n = 10) and common bacteriophages (n = 86) (Table
S4). These results show that our approach of using only two test
individuals but ultradeep sequencing their bacteriophage community
was sufficient to detect a HGP. We speculate that a much larger
HGP will be identified by analyzing additional healthy individuals.
Erroneous mapping of sequencing reads was tested by mapping
over 38 million viral metagenomic reads from other environments
(marine and hot spring environments) and a synthetic dataset to
ALL contigs. No reads were recruited. We used the synthetic
dataset to estimate the percentage of true positives by mapping
the synthetic reads back to a collection of 1,197 Caudovirales
(including the 50 genomes from which the synthetic reads were
derived). The error rate used to create this dataset was set at 1.5%

locations (Boston, Cambridge, Chicago) that harbor each of the complete

phage (bacteriophage 31), were present in >50% of the individuals (core), and
46% were found in >20% of the individuals (core and common). Each line is a

 (a value set by the program) compared with the estimated Illu-
mina error rate of 0.0046% (14). We found that 93% of the
contigs called were true positives (Table S5) and that increasing
the number of reads required to call a contig did not significantly
change this percentage (Table S5). Given the high error rate in the
synthetic dataset, the frequency of miscalled contigs in our ex-
perimental datasets is likely much lower (approximately one order
of magnitude), providing confidence that using even a single read
to identify shared bacteriophages is a valid approach.
To investigate whether HGP bacteriophages play a role in
maintaining human health, we compared the prevalence of core
bacteriophages in healthy individuals to those with irritable bowel
disease (IBD) [n = 66 with ulcerative colitis (UC); n = 36 with
Crohn’s disease (CD)] (7) (Fig. 2). Although core bacteriophages
are found on average in 62% of healthy individuals, their preva-
lence was reduced by 42% and 54% on average in UC and CD
patients, respectively (value of P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). Moreover,
healthy subjects harbored on average 62% of the 23 core bacte-
riophages; however, in UC and CD patients, the average is sig-
nificantly reduced to 37% and 30%, respectively (value of P <
0.0001) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the HGP is signifi-
cantly perturbed in diseased patients.
To analyze the HGP structure, we conducted a network analysis
using ALL contigs. The network groups viruses based on sequence
homology to identify related viruses and to organize short contigs
from partial genomes that dominate metagenomic datasets (9). A
total of 240 statistically supported groups was identified (clustering
coefficient value of 0.667 and modularity value of 0.675), with 44
containing five or more contigs (Fig. 3A and Table S6). Groups
with less than five contigs represented only 11% of the total reads
and were excluded to focus on the largest groups of related se-
quences. Of the 72 complete genomes, 45 (63%) were present and
belonged to 17 different groups. One of these groups contained
crAssphage and three additional complete crAssphage-related
genomes. Previously classified phage genomes were mapped onto
the network to test the accuracy of the grouping, and in nearly all
cases (25 of 28), phages belonging to the same family grouped
together. We also evaluated 172 artificially fragmented Caudo-
virales genomes. The fragmented genomes clustered as expected,
with 20 of 26 being family-specific groups. Only six groups had
fragments from more than one family, which is consistent with the
high level of horizontal gene transfer shown between bacterio-
phages (15). These results suggest that the 44 network-defined
groups can be considered roughly as family-level groups. Only 14
of the 44 network-defined groups contained classified bacterio-
phages, supporting that novel bacteriophages are abundant in the
human gut. The network analysis proved useful in reducing the
complexity of metagenomic datasets by organizing contigs into
biologically relevant groups. Whether the members of these groups
carry out similar functions in the gut is a subject for future study.
The network analysis supports the global distribution of the
HGP. The majority (41 of 44) of network-defined groups were
present in at least one of our test subjects (Table S7); in the
Norman study (Fig. 3C), 12 groups were present in 2–20% of
individuals (low overlap group); 13 were present in 20–50%
(common groups); and 9, including the crAssphage and 2 other
groups with complete genome representatives, were present in
>50% of healthy individuals (core groups, Fig. 3B). Overall, the
viral network represents a more encompassing view of the viral
community than can be seen by only looking at the limited number
of specific taxa classified by fragmented sequence information and
supports the existence of a definable HGP.
Discussion
The overall objective of this study was to investigate the presence
of a HGP. We propose that the phageome of healthy people can
be divided into three classes (Fig. 3D): (i) the core, found in more
than one-half of all individuals; (ii) the common, shared among
many individuals; and (iii) the low overlap/unique, found in a
limited number of individuals. The core is composed of at least 23
bacteriophages in this study and is significantly reduced in UC and
CD patients, suggesting that these bacteriophages play a role in
maintaining human health. Our results do not account for tem-
poral dynamics in either the GM or phageome. Therefore, our
estimates of sharing (>50%, 20–50%, 2–20%) for these bacterio-
phage categories are conservative and may need to be refined with
temporal data from more subjects.
The role of bacteriophages in the human GM is poorly un-
derstood. In most bacteria-dominated ecosystems, bacteriophages
play a key role in shaping community structure and function (16,

 17). Thus, it is expected that the human gut ecosystem is strongly
affected by the activity of bacteriophages. Microbe–virus interac-
tions are often dominated by lytic interactions in a prey–predator
dynamic (18). However, community sequence analysis of the
human gut indicates that lysogenic bacteriophages (prophages)
dominate over lytic bacteriophages (6, 8, 19). It is thought that the
majority of bacterial cells contain at least one prophage, and that
selective activation of a subset of these prophages is what can be
detected as the active phageome in stool samples. The dynamics
that arise from a lytic–lysogenic balance in the gut are still
unknown. However, the active gut bacteriophages have been shown
to influence bacterial population dynamics in a murine gut mi-
crobial ecosystem model (20), and to confer advantages to certain
microbiome members during stress, such as antibiotic exposure
(21). We presume that the active phageome of healthy people plays
a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of a healthy
gut ecosystem. Although the HGP represents a small proportion of
the overall potential gut bacteriophage community, elucidating the
role of the active phageome in a healthy gut will be essential to fully
understanding its potential roles in disease or rehabilitation fol-
lowing episodes of microbiome imbalance.
Identification of a human HGP was somewhat surprising. Cur-
rently, two somewhat contrasting views of human gut phageome
exist. On one hand, there is evidence of more phageome similarity
among relatives and household members compared with unrelated
individuals (7, 8). On the other hand, there is evidence that some

 phages are common to unrelated people (13, 19, 20, 22). Stern
et al. (19) identified 991 bacteriophage sequences from cellular
metagenomes that were shared across 124 individuals. The ma-
jority of these bacteriophages appeared to be integrated prophages,
and only a small fraction was present as VLPs. We found an ex-
panded set of shared phages as well as phages that were unique to
individuals. It is likely that the core HGP is hosted by core gut
bacteria detected by others (3, 12). Our work provides a more
comprehensive view and accurate estimate of phageome overlap.
We presume even more overlap will be discovered with greater
sequencing depth, the application of similar network analytical
approaches, and consideration of more individuals.
In humans, viruses are often viewed as deleterious disease-
causing agents, but the existence of an HGP suggests that the net
influence of bacteriophages in the human gut is not deleterious, but
rather beneficial. Despite large differences in the species compo-
sition of gut bacteria between people, there is a reproducible,
higher-level taxonomic signature (4). This higher-level structure is
thought to be a marker of a healthy gut ecosystem. We posit that
bacteriophages play an essential role in this ecosystem and that the
human HGP, arising from the large pool of cellular prophages,
likely contributes to the proper function of the healthy GM by
influencing the stability and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem
through active lysis and predator–prey dynamics.
Our results increase the known repertoire of shared bacterio-
phages in healthy humans and expand the number of complete core
HGP genomes from one (crAssphage) to nine representatives.
Network analysis identified groups of related viruses, and provided a
powerful tool to organize and reduce the complexity of fragmented
metagenomic data. We suspect that our efforts (sequencing and
computation) underestimated the full extent of the human HGP,
and that larger studies will generate even more accurate estimates of
HGP prevalence, which will allow for a better understanding of the
cosmopolitan human phageome. Future studies are needed to ad-
dress the role of the HGP in health and disease, and to assess the
potential use of core bacteriophages for clinical therapeutics and
controlled manipulation of the human gut ecosystem.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection. Samples were collected from two individuals of 26 and 55 y at
two time points over a period from time 0–3 or 15 mo, respectively, under a
protocol approved by the Internal Review Board of Montana State University.
Both individuals were healthy, with normal bowel movement (at least once every
2 d and no more than three times a day), and had not received antibiotics for >2
mo before the collection of the samples. Collections were carried out with sub-
ject’s informed consent under an approved institutional review board protocol.
VLP Isolation, DNA Extraction, and Sequencing. VLPs were purified based on
Minot et al. (6) (modification: 0.45-μm filtration). The 1.5 g/cm3 fractions were
pooled, dialyzed, and DNase treated, and DNA was extracted using PureLink
Viral DNA/RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using MiSeq Paired
End Illumina Technology.
Bacteriophage Sequences Assemblies. Bacteriophage sequences from two test
individuals were initially assembled using MIRA 4.0 (23) and VICUNA (24)
[quality trimmed reads using Trimmomatic v0.32 (25), 25-bp overlap at a
minimum of 90% identity, and a minimum contig size of 1,000 bp]. Contigs
generated by MIRA and VICUNA were further assembled to each other using
Geneious 9.0.2 (contigs had to overlap across 250 bp at 98% identity to be
assembled) (26). An ALL dataset was generated by assembling contigs from all
time points and individuals together, at 500-bp overlap at a minimum of 98%
identity, using Geneious. Norman dataset reads were quality trimmed using
Trimmomatic. Individual reads were grouped by cohort, and pooled reads
were cross-assembled with IDBA-UD (27) using minimum and maximum kmer
lengths of 20 and 120, respectively (7). Contigs longer than 1,000 bp obtained
were pooled together and assembled using Geneious and manually curated
using the same parameters as in our experimental approach.
Bacteriophage Community Analysis. Reads were recruited to contigs using
Geneious with high-stringency parameters [a read needed to be >98% identical
across its entire length (300 bp) to be recruited]. The number of reads per
contig was normalized to the length of the contig (number of total base pairs
aligned to contig/base pair of contig). The percentage of total normalized
reads to a contig was considered the percentage of the bacteriophage com-
munity accounted for by a particular contig. BC distances and between com-
munities and Shannon index were calculated using vegan package in R.
Taxonomic Classification and Detection of Bacteriophage Genes. ORFs were
predicted using the WebMGA server. Proteins longer than 100 aa with less
than 1% of the length of ambiguities were queried against ACLAME data-
base (e value < 1e-10) and contigs were classified based on Waller (28).
Detection of Contigs in Publicly Available Metagenomes. Reads from the
Norman dataset (7) were quality trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.32 (25) and
deduplicated using cd-hit-dup (29). Trimmed unique reads were mapped to
ALL contigs using high-stringency parameters [90% identity across the full
length of the maximum read length (250 bp) using Geneious]. Reads shorter
than this length will not be aligned; thus, these parameters only allow for high-
quality deduplicated reads to be recruited to contigs.
Read Recruitment Controls. Because read length from the hot springs datasets
(9) was very heterogeneous (340–855 bp), reads were aligned at 90% over the
minimum length of these datasets. Reads from marine metagenomes [deep
ocean hydrothermal vent (SRR3133481)] were mapped with the same aligning
parameters as the reads from the Norman dataset, adjusting the read length
to the size of the reads from this dataset (202 bp). A synthetic dataset was
generated from randomly selected 50 genomes from a list of 1,197 complete
Caudovirales genomes downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology
Information with Grinder (30). The generated 2,000,000 Illumina reads
(250 bp) were mapped to ALL contigs and to the set of 1,197 genomes using
the same parameters as for Norman reads (see above).
Network Analysis. The network analysis was carried out based on Bolduc et al.
(9). Briefly, network analysis is based on an all-versus-all BLASTn/leuvin search
that incorporates both the number and strength of matches between contigs
to group-related sequences into discrete groups. BLASTN analysis was per-
formed with default parameters, except e-value cutoff was set to 1E-10 and
max target sequences to 10,000. Matches were filtered based on the param-
eters of high-scoring segment pair (HSP) length > 200 (minimum alignment
length) and 75% nucleotide identity. The network algorithm measures the
number and weight (HSP and e value) of these connections and clusters se-
quences into groups of highly related sequences. The network was manually
curated and visualized using Gephi with ARF view. A network control was
performed on 172 complete Caudovirales genomes associated with bacterial
host from the human gut (31). Genomes were fragmented into 9,000 with
50-bp overlap using an in-house python script (9), and network analysis was
performed using the same parameters used in the ALL dataset network.
Identification of HGP Bacteriophages in Norman Assemblies. HGP bacterio-
phages were identified via network analysis. Contigs from our ALL and Norman
dataset were pooled together. An all-versus-all BLASTN analysis was performed
and network analysis was applied (see above). Contigs that were in the same
group as HGP bacteriophages identified in our analysis were considered closely
related HGP bacteriophages.
