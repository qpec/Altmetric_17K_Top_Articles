W
hole grains (WGs) are rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, 
minerals, phytochemicals, and other bioactive com-
pounds that may jointly favor long-term health.1,2 Although 
dietary guidelines around the world have included WGs as an 
essential component of healthy eating patterns,3 consumption 
is largely below recommendations in the United States and 
many European countries.4–7 For example, WG intake among 
US adults remains <1 serving per day, despite the long-time 
recommendation in Dietary Guidelines for Americans of ≥3 
servings per day WG intake.4
Clinical Perspective on p 2380
Given the lack of large-scale intervention studies inves-
tigating the effects of WG intake on chronic disease risk, 
well-conducted prospective cohort studies provide the most 
promising evidence on the health benefits of WG. Previous 
meta-analyses of prospective studies have consistently 
reported inverse associations between WG intake and type 
2 diabetes mellitus,8–11 cardiovascular diseases (CVDs),8,12,13 
and certain cancers,14–16 which are among the major global 
causes of death. However, existing findings on WG intake 
and mortality remain largely inconclusive. Although several 
studies observed significant inverse associations between WG 
intake and both total and CVD mortality,17–23 others reported 
null findings.22,24 To the best of our knowledge, no studies have 
quantitatively summarized the published literature on associa-
tions of WG intake with total and cause-specific mortality.
Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of prospective 
cohort studies on WG intake and risks of total, CVD, and 
cancer mortality. We estimated WG ingredient intake in dry 
weight among eligible studies and explored potential dose-
response relationships between WG intake and mortality. In 
Background—Current findings on associations between whole grain (WG) intake and mortality are inconsistent and have 
not been summarized by meta-analysis.
Methods and Results—We searched for prospective cohort studies reporting associations between WG intake and mortality 
from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer through February 2016 in Medline, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov, 
and we further included unpublished results from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and 
NHANES 1999 to 2004. Fourteen studies were eligible for analysis, which included 786 076 participants, 97 867 total 
deaths, 23 957 CVD deaths, and 37 492 cancer deaths. Pooled relative risks comparing extreme WG categories (high versus 
low) were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80–0.88; P<0.001; I2=74%; Pheterogeneity<0.001) for total mortality, 0.82 
(95% CI, 0.79–0.85; P<0.001; I2=0%; Pheterogeneity=0.53) for CVD mortality, and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94; P<0.001; I2=54%; 
Pheterogeneity=0.02) for cancer mortality. Intakes of WG ingredients in dry weight were estimated among studies reporting 
relative risks for ≥3 quantitative WG categories, and they were <50 g/d among most study populations. The 2-stage dose-
response random-effects meta-analysis showed monotonic associations between WG intake and mortality (Pnonlinearity>0.05). 
For each 16-g/d increase in WG (≈1 serving per d), relative risks of total, CVD, and cancer mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 
0.92–0.94; P<0.001), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90–0.93; P<0.001), and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94–0.96; P<0.001), respectively.
Conclusions—Our meta-analysis demonstrated inverse associations of WG intake with total and cause-specific mortality, and 
findings were particularly strong and robust for CVD mortality. These findings further support current Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans, which recommends at least 3 servings per day of WG intake.  (Circulation. 2016;133:2370-2380.

addition, we analyzed associations between WG intake and 
mortality in 2 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) populations and included these original 
results in this meta-analysis.
Methods
Search Strategy
Our study followed the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology guidelines.25 A literature search was performed in 
Medline, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov for articles published through 
February 9, 2015. We combined search terms on exposure (WG and 
its variants and specific cereal grains such as oat, barley, brown rice, 
and wheat) and outcomes (mortality and cause of death) without lan-
guage restriction. Details of the search strategies are shown in the 
online-only Data Supplement. Reference lists of retrieved articles 
were scanned manually for additional studies.
Eligibility
Candidate articles were included if they met all of the following crite-
ria: They applied a prospective cohort design; the exposure included 
intakes of WG ingredients (with specified methods for calculation) 
or WG foods (with specified food items); and the outcome included 
mortality from all causes, CVD, or cancer. For multiple sets of results 
published from the same study population, we used results based on 
the longest duration of follow-up.
Search and Data Extraction
Two authors (G.Z. and A.G.) independently screened titles and 
abstracts of articles retrieved in the initial search, evaluated the eli-
gibility of articles on the basis of a full text review, and extracted 
data. Differences of opinions were resolved by discussion among 
authors to reach consensus. The following data were extracted from 
each study: first author’s last name; year of publication; study loca-
tion; study period; follow-up duration; number of participants; age; 
amounts of WG ingredient/food intake; methods of diet assessment; 
number of deaths from all causes, CVD, or cancer; methods of death 
confirmation; relative risks (RRs; measured by hazard ratios in all 
individual studies) and confidence intervals (CIs) for all WG catego-
ries; and covariates adjusted in multivariable analysis. For studies 
reporting WG ingredient intake, we extracted food items and meth-
ods for WG ingredient calculation.18,19,21–23 For studies reporting WG 
food intake, we extracted the definitions of and a list of specific WG 
foods.17,20,24,26–28
To evaluate potential dose-response relationships, we further 
extracted numbers of cases, numbers of participants, and median 
intakes in each WG category from studies that reported RRs (95% 
CIs) for ≥3 quantitative WG categories.18,20,21,23 If numbers of partici-
pants and cases were not provided, we used the average number of 
cases and participants (total participants or cases divided by the num-
ber of categories).19,22 When median intake was missing, we approxi-
mated it by using the midpoint of the lower and upper bounds. If 
the highest category was open-ended, we assumed that the highest 
category had the same WG intake range as the adjacent category. For 
studies reporting WG as servings per day or analyzing WG foods, 
we converted medians into WG ingredients in grams by referring 
to additional publications or databases that provide WG amounts

of individual foods (online-only Data Supplement). Study quality 
was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.29 
Scores ranged from 0 to 9 points, with higher scores indicating higher 
study quality (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).
To use all available data in this meta-analysis, we also examined 
WG intake in relation to mortality in NHANES III and continu-
ous NHANES surveys 1999 to 2004 and included results in the cur-
rent investigation. NHANES is a series of nationwide surveys among 
noninstitutionalized US residents with the primary aim of assessing 
the health and nutritional status of adults and children. To achieve 
nationwide representativeness, a complex multistage probability-
sampling design is used in NHANES surveys. The study protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA), and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants. Because mortality follow-up in 
NHANES surveys was up to the end of 2010, we included participants

surveyed before 2005 to allow sufficient follow-up (>6 years). We 
analyzed the association between WG intake and mortality in these 2 
cohorts and included original results in this meta-analysis. WG was 
estimated by linking data from a single 24-hour dietary recall to the 
MyPyramid Equivalents Database. Mortality information was obtained 
by searching the National Death Index. Details of the study population 
and method are provided in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Meta-analysis was based on risk estimates from models with the most 
complete adjustment of potential confounders but not components of 
WGs such as cereal fiber. RRs comparing the highest and lowest WG 
groups were summarized with a random-effects model.30 Statistical 
heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test (P<0.10) and I2 
statistic.31 Analysis was stratified by study location (United States, 
Scandinavia, and other regions), WG assessments (WG ingredients, 
WG foods), dietary questionnaire (single food frequency question-
naire [FFQ] at baseline, repeated FFQ during follow-up, and others), 
whether WG is the main exposure (yes, no), sample size (<20 000, 
≥20 000), median follow-up duration (<10 years, ≥10 years), adjust-
ments for dietary factors (energy intake and other dietary confound-
ing factors; yes, no), Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score (<8, ≥8), and 
mean age at baseline (all adults, only >55 years). In light of the 
limited number of included studies, we performed univariate meta-
regressions to explore whether these factors are potential sources of 
heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and the 
Egger linear regression test.32
To examine the parametric relationship between WG intake and 
mortality, we first calculated the covariance of RRs using num-
ber of cases and participants in each WG category and applied 
the inverse of variance/covariance matrix as study weight in the 
analysis.33 A 2-stage dose-response random-effects meta-analysis 
was performed.34 In the first stage, a restricted cubic spline model 
with 2 spline variables of WG intake was fitted after taking into 
account the correlation within each set of published RRs. In the sec-
ond stage, the regression coefficients and the variance/covariance 
matrixes within each study were combined by use of the multivari-
ate extension of the method of moments in a multivariate random-
effects meta-analysis.34 We calculated the overall significance of 
models by testing the hypothesis that the 2 regression coefficients 
equal 0, and we calculated the significance for nonlinearity by test-
ing the hypothesis that the coefficient of the second coefficient 
equals 0.35 STATA commands MVMETA and GLST were used for 
model fitting. All analyses were conducted with STATA version 
12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
The population-attributable fraction was calculated with the fol-
lowing formula: population-attributable fraction=100%×Pe(RR−1)/
(Pe[RR−1]+1), where Pe is the prevalence of WG consumption below 
dietary recommendation among US adults, which is 92.7% accord-
ing to a recent analysis in NHANES 2009 to 2010.36 RR is the risk 
estimate from the current meta-analysis, comparing average WG con-
sumption among US adults (0.82 serving a day) with recommended 
intake (3 servings per day).
Results
Of the 4062 records retrieved from initial search, 3966 were 
excluded after title and abstract screening, and 84 were 
excluded after full text review. We further excluded 5 mul-
tiple reports based on the same populations, 3 reports among 
participants with existing CVD or cancer, 4 reports with no 
descriptions of WG ingredient calculation or specific WG 
food criteria, and 1 report using WG intake as a continuous 
variable (Figure 1). Twelve studies from 11 publications were 
eligible for analysis.
Baseline characteristics of NHANES III (n=11 666) and 
NHANES 1999 to 2004 (n=12 488) are provided in Tables 
II and III in the online-only Data Supplement. As shown in 
Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement, WG intake 
was inversely associated with total and cause-specific mor-
tality, although none of the associations reached statistical 
significance.
Thus, 14 unique sets of results were included in the 
meta-analysis, which included 786 076 participants, 97 867 
total deaths (n=12), 23 957 CVD deaths (n=11), and 37 492 
cancer deaths (n=9; Table 1). Two studies reported find-
ings for WG bread and WG cereals separately,24,28 and 1 
study performed only sex-specific analysis.22 Most stud-
ies (n=10) were conducted in US populations, with the 
remaining studies in either Scandinavian countries (n=3) 
or the United Kingdom (n=1). Median follow-up durations 
ranged from 6 to 28 years, and study periods were between 
1971 and 2010. Six studies analyzed WG foods, and 8 esti-
mated intakes of WG ingredients (4 used the MyPyramid 
Equivalents Database and 4 used self-developed methods). 
Foods accounting for WG intake ranged from a single item 
(eg, WG bread, dark bread, or WG cereals) in FFQs to a 
comprehensive list of grain-based foods available from 
24-hour dietary recall (Table 1 and the online-only Data 
Supplement). The association between WG intake and mor-
tality was the primary study aim of 10 investigations, and 
the rest considered WGs a component of healthy diets or a 
source of dietary fiber. Most studies applied FFQs to assess 
dietary exposure (3 used repeated FFQs, 7 used baseline 
FFQs, 2 used 24-hour dietary recall, and 1 used a diet his-
tory questionnaire). Newcastle-Ottawa Scale scores ranged 
from 6 to 9, with 9 studies scoring ≥8 (Table IV in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Main Analysis
Figure 2 shows forest plots on mortality, comparing the 
highest and lowest groups of WG intake. The pooled RR 
for total mortality was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80–0.88; P<0.001), 
with significant heterogeneity detected among studies 
(I2=74%; Pheterogeneity<0.001). For CVD mortality, 2 studies 
provided results for coronary heart disease and stroke sep-
arately, and 1 study reported only coronary heart disease 
mortality, yielding 15 individual estimates. The pooled RR 
was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79–0.85; P<0.001) without appar-
ent heterogeneity (I2=0.0%; P heterogeneity=0.53). The RR of 
cancer mortality was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94; P<0.001), 
pooling 11 individual estimates from 9 studies (I2=54%; 
Pheterogeneity=0.02).
Results of stratified analysis are shown in Tables V 
through VII in the online-only Data Supplement, with sig-
nificantly lower RRs observed in most subgroups. In univar-
iate meta-regression, heterogeneities of all-cause mortality 
and cancer mortality were not explained by study location, 
WG assessments, dietary questionnaire, study aim, sample 
size, median follow-up duration, adjustment for dietary 
factors, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score, or ages at baseline. 
Funnel plots for publication bias are shown in Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement. The Egger test did not 
suggest publication bias for total mortality (P=0.72), CVD 
mortality (P=0.21), or cancer mortality (P=0.64).

Dose-Response Analysis
Among 10 studies that provided adequate data for dose-
response analysis, estimated median intakes across WG cat-
egories ranged from 0.7 to 21 g/d (in a US study) to 20 to 
80 g/d (in a Scandinavian study). The dose-response relation-
ship between WG ingredient intake and mortality is shown in 
Figure 3. With no WG consumption used as the reference, the 
RRs of total mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97; P<0.001; 
Figure 3A) at 10 g/d, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77–0.91; P<0.001) at 
30 g/d, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75–0.85; P<0.001) at 50 g/d, and 0.78 
(95% CI, 0.74–0.82; P<0.001; Ptrend<0.001; Pnonlinearity=0.06) at 
70 g/d. For CVD mortality (Figure 3B), the RRs were 0.92 
(95% CI, 0.88–0.96; P<0.001) at 10 g/d, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.75–
0.89; P<0.001) at 30 g/d, 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84; P<0.001) 
at 50 g/d, and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68–0.87; P<0.001; Ptrend<0.001; 
Pnonlinearity=0.10) at 70 g/d compared with no WG consumption. 
For cancer mortality (Figure 3C), the RRs were 0.96 (95% 
CI, 0.91–1.01; P=0.12) at 10 g/d, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.89–0.99; 
P=0.04) at 30 g/d, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76–0.94; P=0.001) at 50 
g/d, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.72–0.89; P<0.001; Ptrend<0.001, 
Pnonlinearity=0.67) at 70 g/d compared with no WG consumption. 
Because tests for nonlinear trends were not rejected (P>0.05 
for all outcomes), we further estimated RRs for each 16-g/d 
increase in WG ingredient consumption (≈1 serving per day), 
which were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92–0.94) for total mortality, 0.91 
(95% CI, 0.90–0.93) for CVD mortality, and 0.95 (95% CI, 
0.94–0.96) for cancer mortality.
Sensitivity Analysis
Results of main analysis did not change in the following sensi-
tivity analyses (Table VII in the online-only Data Supplement): 
restricting the analysis in studies eligible for dose-response 
meta-analysis; excluding studies that used only cereals as the 
WG source24,27,28; excluding studies that used only bread as the 
WG source17,18,24,28; excluding the largest study by Huang et 
al21; and for CVD mortality, excluding studies that analyzed 
only stroke mortality or coronary heart disease mortality. 
Dose-response curves were similar in the following sensitiv-
ity analyses: assuming that WG bread was made from 100% 
WG flour in studies by Steffen et al26 and Jacob et al20 (Figure 
II in the online-only Data Supplement); assuming that 1 oz 
equivalent of WG in MyPyramid Equivalents Database is 
16 g dry WG ingredients (Figure III in the online-only Data 
Supplement); and excluding the largest study by Huang et al21 
(Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
Population-Attributable Fraction
Estimated population-attributable fractions were 10.4% for 
total mortality, 11.6% for CVD mortality, and 10.2% for can-
cer mortality.
Discussion
Our study demonstrated significant inverse associations 
between WG intake and mortality from all causes, CVD, and 
cancer. Further dose-response analysis showed a strong mono-
tonic association of WG with total and cause-specific mortal-
ity. These findings support current dietary guidelines for WG 
consumption that recommends ≥3 servings per day for long-
term health and longevity.
Studies included in this meta-analysis collectively showed 
strong and robust inverse associations between WG intake and 
CVD mortality. The results were in line with existing findings 
linking WG intake with CVD risk, as well as other cardio-
metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Meta-
analyses of 8 to 14 prospective cohort studies reported a 21% 
CVD risk reduction comparing the highest WG intake group 
with the lowest.8,12,13 For diabetes risk, the pooled RR com-
paring extreme WG groups was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69–0.80),8 
with each 2– to 3–servings per day increment associated with 
21% to 32% lower risk.9,10 Two meta-analyses of clinical trial 
results consistently documented that WG intake lowered fast-
ing glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total choles-
terol, and body fat percentage.8,37
The relationship between WG intake and cancer out-
comes is less clear. In our meta-analysis, significantly 
lower cancer mortality was observed only when daily WG 
consumption exceeded 30 g/d. An early meta-analysis of 
40 case-control studies found that WG intakes were lower 
among patients with various types of cancer than control 
subjects,14 although the retrospective study design of these 
early studies hindered causal inference. Subsequent pro-
spective studies consistently found inverse associations 
between WG intake and colorectal cancer but not with other 
cancers.23 For example, Haas et al16 reported an inverse 
association between WG intake and colorectal cancer inci-
dence in a meta-analysis of 25 studies. Aune et al15 further 
performed a dose-response analysis of 6 prospective stud-
ies and found a linear inverse association between WG food 
intake and colorectal cancer risk, with each 3-serving incre-
ment associated with a 17% lower risk. It is possible that 
the association between WG intake and cancer depends on 
population characteristics and cancer types and is explained 
partly by other lifestyle and dietary factors,23 which needs to 
be investigated by further studies.
Despite limited available data, WG consumption may 
also contribute to lower mortality from other causes. Among 
>30 000 Norwegians, a nonlinear inverse association was 
observed for WG bread consumption and risk of noncardio-
vascular and noncancer deaths.18 In the Iowa Women’s Health 
Study, intakes of WG foods were inversely associated with 
risk of death attributed to inflammatory diseases other than 
CVD and cancer such as infectious diseases, respiratory sys-
tem diseases, and digestive diseases.20 Huang et al21 found an 
inverse association between WG intake and mortality from 
respiratory diseases, infections, and other unknown causes. 
Johnsen et al22 also reported that WG intake was associated 
with lower mortality resulting from causes other than CVD, 
cancer, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory diseases. Clearly, 
more data are required to further elucidate the potential ben-
efits of WGs on other health conditions.
Our analysis revealed a largely linear dose-response rela-
tionship of WG intake with total and CVD mortality. Although 
risk estimates were less stable at very high doses because of 
limited data, the monotonically decreasing curves for WGs up 
to 50 g/d strongly supported the current Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans recommendation to consume ≥3 oz equiva-
lents WG foods (48 g WG ingredients) for the prevention of 
chronic diseases. It is critical to note that individuals should

choose foods that are high in WG ingredients (at least 16 g 
WG ingredients in dry weight per serving) to achieve ≈48 g/d 
of WG intake while maintaining a low consumption of refined 
carbohydrates, which have established adverse effects.38,39 
In this regard, low-carbohydrate diets that ignore the health 
benefits of WG foods should be adopted with caution because 
they have been linked to higher CVD risk and mortality.40–42 
Instead, diets that emphasize the quality of carbohydrates, 
fats, and proteins such as the Mediterranean diet, Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, and Alternate Healthy 
Eating Index 2010 should be recommended to facilitate dis-
ease prevention.43
Multiple bioactive compounds in WGs could contrib-
ute to the prevention of obesity, CVD, diabetes mellitus, 
cancer, poor gut health, nervous system disorders, poor 
skeletal health, and oxidative stress. The high fiber content 
may lower cholesterol production and glucose response 
and increase satiety, partially through inducing the pro-
duction of short-chain fatty acids, which also lower car-
cinogenic potential. The high magnesium content in WGs

may improve insulin sensitivity, suppress glucose update, 
and lower blood pressure. WGs also contain other miner-
als and constituents, including Fe, Zn, Cu, Se, polyphenols, 
carotenoids, and tocopherols, thus may suppress the oxida-
tive stress that underlies the pathogenesis of many chronic 
diseases.2
The strengths of our study include a large number of 
participants in original studies and careful examination of 
dose-response relationships. We standardized WG intake 
to reduce heterogeneity of WG estimates among individ-
ual studies and to facilitate comparison with the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans. According to sensitivity anal-
yses, findings were independent of differences in WG 
assessment methods. Meanwhile, our study has some limi-
tations. Because included studies were carried out before 
a more consistent definition of WG became available,44 
lists of WG foods or food sources varied substantially 
among individual studies. For US adults, >70% of daily 
WG intake is from breads and cereals (yeast breads/rolls, 
quick breads, pastas/cooked cereals/rice, and ready-to-eat 
cereals),4 which were included by most studies in our dose-
response meta-analysis. Because of the small number of 
studies available, meta-regression has limited capacity to 
identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Because most 
studies are from US and Scandinavian populations, it is 
not known whether these findings can be generalized to 
populations of other ethnicities. Most studies used FFQs to 
collect dietary data, therefore WG intake could be under-
estimated when the list of food items was limited. Because 
WG contents vary both between and within food items, 
measurement error in WG and misclassification of par-
ticipants are inevitable. Such random measurement errors 
may weaken primarily the true associations in these pro-
spective studies. For studies that used short-term dietary 
assessment tools such as 3-day food records, day-to-day 
variations in WG intake may reduce the validity of these 
assessments to reflect long-term diet. Other potential limi-
tations include unmeasured or residual confounding from 
healthier lifestyles associated with high WG intake and the 
inclusion of participants with prevalent and unmeasured

Figure 3. Dose-response analysis for associations between whole grain intake and mortality from all-cause (A; Ptrend<0.001; Pnonlinearity=0.06), 
cardiovascular disease (CVD; B; Ptrend<0.001; Pnonlinearity=0.10), and cancer (C; Ptrend<0.001; Pnonlinearity=0.67) mortality in prospective cohort 
studies. The pooled linear risk trend (thick solid line) and its 95% confidence interval (thick dashed lines) were obtained by a random-
effects dose-response meta-analysis. Circles are inversely proportional to the variance of log relative risks.

new onset of disease during follow-up, which may sub-
stantially change the diet at baseline or during the follow-
up period.
Conclusions
WG consumption was inversely associated with mortality in 
a dose-response manner, and the association with CVD mor-
tality was particularly strong and robust. These observations 
endorse current dietary guidelines that recommend increas-
ing WG intake to replace refined grains to facilitate long-term 
health and to help prevent premature death.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Whole grains (WGs) provide various essential nutrients for long-term health and have been associated with lower risk of 
many chronic diseases. However, WG consumption is largely below dietary recommendation in the United States and many 
European countries. We performed the first meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies on WG intake and risk of mortal-
ity, which included 14 studies with 786 076 participants and 97 867 total deaths. Accordingly, inverse associations between 
WG intake and mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer were observed, and findings for cardiovascular 
disease mortality were robust and strong compared with those for total and cancer mortality. All estimated WG ingredient 
intakes were <80 g/d, with most studies <50 g/d. Within this range, dose-response analysis revealed a largely linear relation-
ship between the amount of WG intake and total, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality. Our findings corroborated 
current Dietary Guidelines for Americans that recommends WG consumption of ≥3 servings per day (48 g/d WG ingredi-
ents) to facilitate the prevention of chronic diseases and premature death.
