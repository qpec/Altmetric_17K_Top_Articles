Alcohol use disorder has been linked to dysregulation of the brain stress systems, producing a negative emotional state leading to chronic
relapsing behavior. Vasopressin receptors appear to have a regulatory role in stress, anxiety, and alcohol. This study evaluated the novel
compound, ABT-436, a V1b receptor antagonist, in alcohol-dependent participants in a 12-week clinical trial. Men and women (n = 150)
who met criteria for DSM–IV alcohol dependence were recruited across four sites. Participants received double-blind ABT-436 or placebo,
and a computerized behavioral intervention. ABT-436 was titrated to 800 mg/day during weeks 2–12. Although the primary outcome,
percentage of heavy drinking days, was lower in participants receiving ABT-436 compared with placebo, this difference was not statistically
significant (31.3 vs 37.6, respectively; p = 0.172; d = 0.20). However, participants receiving ABT-436 had significantly greater percentage of
days abstinent than those receiving placebo (51.2 vs 41.6, respectively; p = 0.037; d = 0.31). No significant differences were found between
treatment groups on any other measures of drinking, alcohol craving, or alcohol-related consequences. Smokers receiving ABT-436
smoked significantly fewer cigarettes per week than those receiving placebo (p = 0.046). ABT-436 was well tolerated, with diarrhea (mild-
to-moderate severity) being the most common side effect. In subgroup analyses, participants with relatively higher baseline levels of stress
responded better to ABT-436 than placebo on select drinking outcomes, suggesting there may be value in testing medications targeting the
vasopressin receptor in high stress, alcohol-dependent patients.

INTRODUCTION
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a devastating disease that is
responsible for a myriad of medical, psychological, social,
economic, and personal problems (Dawson et al, 2008;
Roerecke and Rehm, 2014). A recent report indicates that
13.9% of US adults met the criteria for AUD during the past
year, whereas 29.1% met AUD criteria at some time in their
lives (Grant et al, 2015). The economic burden of alcohol
misuse is staggering, costing the US more than $249 billion
in 2010 (Sacks et al, 2015). Fortunately, progress has been
made in developing medications to treat AUD. This
development parallels the progress in understanding the
neurobiological basis of AUD development and mainte-
nance. Four medications have been approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration to treat alcohol dependence:
disulfiram, oral naltrexone, long-acting injectable naltrexone,
and acamprosate. Still, because of the heterogeneity of AUD,
these medications are not effective for all people. Continued
research is needed to develop additional medications that are
effective and safe for a diverse AUD population, providing
clinicians with a greater menu of options for treating this
disorder.
To better understand AUD, researchers have conceptua-
lized this complex disorder in terms of specific domains,
including reward, incentive salience, negative emotionality,
executive function, and social processes (Litten et al, 2015).
These domains, in turn, can be linked to three stages of the
addiction
cycle:
binge/intoxication,
withdrawal/negative
affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (Koob and Le Moal,
1997). It has been postulated that as the severity of AUD

 increases, there is an increased contribution of the with-
drawal/negative affect stage and increased engagement of the
brain stress systems, including the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal (HPA) axis and extrahypothalamic stress systems
(Koob, 2008). Key neurotransmitters and their related
receptors include corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), nor-
epinephrine, glucocorticoids, dynorphin/kappa opioid, hy-
pocretin (orexin), and vasopressin. Medications that block
the receptors of these brain stress systems successfully
reduced excessive alcohol intake in animal models, particu-
larly where the excessive drinking is linked to the alleviation
of signs associated with withdrawal and protracted absti-
nence (negative reinforcement) (Koob and Mason, 2016).
Vasopressin (arginine vasopressin, or AVP), a nonapep-
tide synthesized in the hypothalamus, is one of two main
neuropeptides responsible for regulating the HPA axis.
Along with CRF, AVP stimulates the release of pituitary
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) via the AVP 1b (V1b)
receptor. The release of ACTH stimulates production of
cortisol via the adrenal cortex and is central to the HPA axis
response to stress (Carrasco and Van de Kar, 2003; Herman
and Cullinan, 1997; Sapolsky et al, 2000; Tsigos and
Chrousos, 2002). In addition, like CRF, extrahypothalamic
vasopressin appears to play a significant role in regulating
various complex behaviors in preclinical studies, including
stress, anxiety-like behaviors, aggression, social affiliation,
sexual pair bonding, and addiction (Caldwell et al, 2008).
When selectively blocked, the V1b receptor appears to
modulate anxiety, depression, and addiction. Griebel et al,
2002 found that rats treated with V1b receptor antagonist
SSR149415
displayed
anxiolytic-like
activity
and
antidepressant-like effects in models of anxiety and depres-
sion. In other preclinical studies in rats, V1b receptor
antagonists blocked dependence-induced compulsive-like
alcohol intake. For instance, Edwards et al, 2011 reported
that V1b antagonist SSR149415 dose-dependently reduced
alcohol intake in dependent rats and did not affect alcohol
intake in nondependent rats. Zhou et al, 2011 reported that
the V1b receptor antagonist SSR149415 significantly reduced
alcohol intake in Sardinian alcohol-preferring rats, compared
with non-preferring rats. It is important to note the
consistency of the findings observed in these two studies
conducted at independent labs and using different animal
models. These findings provided a rationale for studying a
V1b receptor antagonist for the treatment of AUDs.
The
novel
compound
studied
in
this
clinical
trial,
ABT-436, is a potent, full and competitive selective V1b
receptor antagonist manufactured and provided by AbbVie.
Phase 1 studies involving the safety, pharmacodynamics, and
alcohol interaction for ABT-436 have been completed (Katz
et al, 2016a,b). Here we report the results of a multi-site
clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of ABT-436 in an
alcohol-dependent population. Outcomes assessed during
the 12-week trial included alcohol consumption, alcohol
craving, and drinking consequences. Cigarette smoking was
assessed because of the high comorbidity of cigarette
smoking and alcohol consumption. Changes in mood were
also assessed due to the impact on mood when the intake of
these substances is modified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Randomized participants (n = 150) were diagnosed with past
year alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual, 4th edition Text Revision (DSM–IV–TR)
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Participants were
eligible if they were 21 to 65 years of age, reported drinking
an average of at least 28 standard drinks per week for women
or 35 standard drinks per week for men during the 28-day
period before consent, had a CIWA-AR score of o10, were
not diagnosed with Axis I disorders (except panic disorder),
do not have any underlying medical condition that could
exacerbate during trial participation or could achieve plasma
cortisol ⩾ 18 μg/dl within 60 min after CORTROSYN chal-
lenge (ACTH stimulation test). Most psychiatric medications
were excluded except for the stable use of antidepressants.
(see Supplementary Appendices 1 and 2 for the full
inclusion/exclusion
criteria
and
assessment
schedule,
respectively).
Study Design
The study was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group 12-week treatment trial. Candi-
dates responded by telephone to advertisements at four
academic sites in the US between 21 February 2013 and 21
October 2014. The study (Protocol NCIG 004) was approved
by the local Institutional Review Board at each participating
clinical site; all subjects participating in the study provided
their written informed consent before initiation of any study
procedures. See Supplementary Appendix 3 for details on
clinical sites and study oversight.
In addition to screening and baseline visits, six in-clinic
visits and six telephone visits were conducted. A follow-up
telephone interview was conducted at week 15, ~ 2 weeks
after the last in-clinic study visit, to assess safety and
determine any changes in drinking. Participants were
required to have a breath alcohol concentration ⩽ 0.02%
to complete the in-clinic assessments.
Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to
receive either ABT-436 or matched placebo using a permuted
stratified block randomization procedure. The stratification
variables were clinical site and Spielberger Trait Anxiety
Index (STAI) score (o39 and ⩾ 39) (Spielberger et al, 1983),
the latter was selected to balance groups with respect to trait
anxiety (George et al, 2008), which was hypothesized to
influence treatment response. Randomization was imple-
mented via a centralized, interactive web-based response
system (IWRS). See Supplementary Appendix 4 for addi-
tional details on randomization and blinding.
Investigational Product
ABT-436 is a potent and selective V1b receptor antagonist
developed and manufactured by AbbVie. Medication was
dispensed at scheduled visits over 12 weeks using a double-
blind method. ABT-436 was supplied in 200 mg tablets with
identical matching placebo tablets. For both the ABT-436
and placebo groups, the amount was titrated from a starting
dose of 200 mg on day 1, and 200 mg twice a day on days
2–7, to a target dose of 400 mg, twice a day, on weeks 2–12.
Efficacy of V1b receptor antagonist for alcohol dependence
ML Ryan et al

Neuropsychopharmacology
 On the basis of studies conducted by AbbVie, the dose of
200–800 mg QD was the projected efficacious dose range
based on data from preclinical efficacy models, pharmaco-
kinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling for HPA axis attenua-
tion (urine total glucocorticoids, urine-free cortisol, plasma
ACTH, and serum cortisol), and an initial signal for efficacy
in a Phase 1b study in major depressive disorder patients
with 800 mg QD of ABT-436. Although single doses up to
1600 mg and multiple doses up to 1500 mg were generally
well tolerated in Phase 1 studies in mostly male subjects,
400 mg BID was selected for this study to reduce the risk of
drop outs due to gastrointestinal effects. Participants who
could not tolerate the target dose were permitted to gradually
reduce their dose to 600 mg daily, then 400 mg daily, and
finally to 200 mg daily until the dosage was well tolerated. If
200 mg daily was not tolerated, medication was discontinued
but those participants were encouraged to remain in the
study and participate in study assessments. Dosage com-
pliance was verified by comparing the patient’s self-report to
pill count. Medication compliance was calculated as the total
amount of medication taken, divided by the total amount
prescribed during the maintenance phase of the study (weeks
2–12). To validate adherence, ABT-436 plasma levels were
determined from samples collected at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and
13 and validated using a 96-well salting-out assisted liquid/
liquid extraction and high performance liquid chromato-
graphy tandem mass spectroscopy method (Zhang et al,
2009). ABT-436 plasma levels were not intended as a
mediator
of outcome given
the
variability
of sample
collection post dosing.
Behavioral Platform
All participants were required to view Take Control—a
computerized bibliotherapy platform (Litten et al, 2013).
Measures of Efficacy
Alcohol consumption was captured via the Time-Line
Follow-Back and Form 90 interview methodology and
procedures (Sobell and Sobell, 1992; Miller, 1992). The a
priori primary efficacy end point was percentage of heavy
drinking days measured weekly during the maintenance
phase of the study (weeks 2–12). A ‘heavy drinking day’ was
defined as four or more drinks (women) or five or more
drinks (men) per drinking day.
A priori secondary efficacy end points included other
drinking measures (ie, drinks per day, drinks per drinking
day, percentage of days abstinent, percentage of very heavy
drinking days (8+/10+ drinks per drinking day for women
and men, respectively), percentage of subjects with no heavy
drinking days, and percentage of subjects abstinent), during
weeks 2–12; as well as severity of alcohol craving (Penn
Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS)) (Flannery et al, 1999),
number of alcohol-related consequences (ImBIBe; a revised
and abbreviated form of the DrInC (Litten et al, 2013; Miller,
1995; Werner et al, 2008)), and number of cigarettes smoked
per day (past week).
Safety Assessments
Safety was assessed via vital signs, blood chemistries and
hematology, urine drug tests, breath alcohol concentration,
adverse events, concomitant medication use, electrocardio-
gram), alcohol withdrawal (Clinical Institute Withdrawal
Assessment for Alcohol–revised (CIWA-Ar) (Sullivan et al,
1989)), and psychiatric measures, including suicidal ideation
(Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Posner et al, 2011))
and the Profile of Moods States (McNair et al, 1992).
ABT-436’s effect on the HPA axis was assessed by an ACTH
stimulation test (CORTROSYN challenge) at screening, week
5, and the end of the study. This ACTH stimulation test was
conducted as a safety measure to ensure that alcohol-
dependent patients, who might be expected to have an
already blunted cortisol response (Wand and Dobs, 1991),
would not be further compromised by the potential cortisol
reducing effects of ABT-436 (Katz et al, 2016a). Adverse
events were assessed in the clinic and during telephone
interviews using the open-ended question: ‘How have you
been feeling since your last visit?’
Statistical Analysis
All baseline, safety, and efficacy analyses (except for the pre-
specified model examining the number of cigarettes smoked
per week) were analyzed on a modified intention-to-treat
(mITT) population that included all randomized participants
who received at least one dose of medication (n = 144;
ABT-436 = 73, placebo = 71). For efficacy analyses, one
additional placebo subject had no drinking data during the
maintenance period and one ABT-436 subject was missing
data on a baseline covariate, resulting in 142 analyzable
participants (ABT-436 = 72, placebo = 70). The smoking
efficacy model included only participants who were smokers
at baseline (ie, smoked at least one cigarette in the past week)
(n = 49; ABT-436 = 23, placebo = 26).
Continuous outcomes measured at multiple time points
were analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed-effects
model. Least-square means (LSMEANs), standard errors
(SEs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented for
each treatment group and were derived from fully adjusted
models on untransformed outcomes (to facilitate clinical
interpretation) averaged across the maintenance period
(weeks 2–12). Cohen’s d and p-values were based on the
fully adjusted models with the appropriately transformed
outcome variables.
For the dichotomous drinking outcomes (ie, percentage of
subjects abstinent and percentage of subjects with no heavy
drinking days), unadjusted prevalence rates were deter-
mined. Odds ratios (ORs) and p-values were derived from
unadjusted logistic regression models that included only the
treatment group; covariates were not included because of
insufficient numbers of abstinent and no heavy drinking
events (Peduzzi et al, 1996).
Imputation for missing data generally was not performed;
however, as a sensitivity analysis, missing data for the
primary outcome, percentage of heavy drinking days, were
handled in two ways: (a) by imputing missing data as heavy
drinking days and (b) by using multiple imputation.
An exploratory analysis of five potential moderators was
conducted on the primary efficacy outcome, percentage of
heavy drinking days, and percentage of days abstinent to
determine if a differential treatment effect existed during the
maintenance period as a function of baseline characteristics.
These characteristics included three measures of stress

 (STAI, POMS Tension-Anxiety subscale, and peak cortisol
level in response to an ACTH stimulation test), gender, and
alcohol consumption (drinks per day for the 28-day period
before screening). A model similar to the primary efficacy
model was used for each moderator; the moderator was
included and the treatment-by-week interaction term was
replaced with a treatment-by-moderator interaction term.
For all statistical tests, po0.05 (two-tailed) was considered
statistically significant. No adjustment was made for multiple
inferential tests. For the primary outcome, an estimated
sample size of 148 participants was required to obtain 126
study completers (63 per treatment group), yielding 80%
power to detect a treatment effect (Cohen’s d = 0.50) with a
two-tailed t-test at a 0.05 significance level. Data were
analyzed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). See
Supplementary Appendix 5 for additional details regarding
the statistical analysis.
RESULTS
Study Sample
Of the 415 participants consented for the study, 150 were
randomized to receive ABT-436 or a placebo (n = 75 per
group); 265 were excluded because they did not meet
eligibility criteria or they chose not to participate (see
Supplementary Appendix 6 for the CONSORT diagram).
The top reasons for exclusion included: elevated blood
pressure (20.8%), positive urine toxicology drug screen
(10.2%), not meeting drinking criteria (8.3%), and taking
prohibited medication (6.0%). The mITT population ex-
cluded six randomized participants who never received study
medication. In the mITT population, more participants
withdrew early from the study in the placebo than ABT-436
group (14 vs 10, respectively). Only one patient in the
ABT-436 group withdrew from the study because of adverse
events (AE) (diarrhea), compared with three in the placebo
group (fogginess, rash, hives, and pruritus). However, more
participants discontinued medication because of AEs (and
stayed in the study) in the ABT-436 group than in the
placebo group (8 vs 0, respectively).
Participants in the ABT-436 and placebo groups were not
statistically different on any baseline characteristic (Table 1).
Randomized
participants
were
mostly
male,
white,
employed, unmarried, and middle-aged. On average they
drank heavily, consuming ~ 10 drinks per day, and met or
exceeded four drinks (women) or five drinks (men) per
drinking day on ~ 79% of the days. With respect to treatment
drinking goals, ~ 13.2% desired permanent abstinence and to
never drink again, whereas the majority sought to drink in a
controlled manner. About one-third (34%) smoked at least
one cigarette in the week before the screening visit, averaging
98 cigarettes per week (among the smokers). Participants had
very low levels of alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar = 1.1),
near-normal levels of trait anxiety (STAI = 39.4), and only
modest levels of mood disturbance (POMS Total Mood
Disturbance = 10.6).
Medication Compliance and Participation
Overall medication compliance during the maintenance
phase was 92.2% and was similar for both treatment groups
(92.1% vs 92.3% for the placebo and ABT-436 groups,
respectively; p = 0.916). The average daily dosage during the
maintenance phase was nearly identical in both groups:
628 mg in the placebo and 627 mg in the ABT-436 groups (or
3.1 of the four maximum pills) (p = 0.980). Analyte levels of
ABT-436 were largely consistent with patient self-reports of
medication consumption (concordance rates: 78.5–89.7%
during weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9). The PK samples were taken to
validate adherence and not intended as a mediator of
outcome given that the samples were taken at different times
post dosing. Overall, 84% of participants had complete
drinking data during the maintenance phase, with the
ABT-436 group being slightly higher than the placebo group
(86.0% vs 83.0%, respectively), which was not statistically
significant (p = 0.593).
Primary Efficacy Outcome
Averaged across the maintenance period (weeks 2–12), the
ABT-436 group experienced somewhat lower adjusted levels
of the primary outcome, percentage of heavy drinking days,
than the placebo group (31.3 vs 37.6, respectively; d = 0.20),
although this small effect was not statistically significant
(p = 0.172) (Table 2). The treatment effect was statistically
significant in the first week of the maintenance period
(week 2) and was also largest in this week (p = 0.045;
d = 0.34). However, across the weeks, the treatment effects
were
generally
small
(d’s = 0.03–0.34),
did
not
reach
statistical significance (with the exception of week 2), and
did not differ statistically from each other (ie, treatment
group by week interaction, p = 0.218) (Figure 1a). The overall
treatment effect was similar, and also not statistically
significant, when missing drinking data were handled using
multiple imputation—the adjusted mean percentage of heavy
drinking days was 31.8 and 37.8 for ABT-436 and placebo,
respectively
(p = 0.175;
d = 0.19).
The
treatment
effect,
however, increased slightly and achieved near-statistical
significance with an imputation scheme that treated days
with missing data as heavy drinking days (34.5 vs 43.8 for
ABT-436 and placebo, respectively; p = 0.061; d = 0.26).
This small improvement in treatment effect was attributable
to greater dropout (and more missing data to impute as
heavy drinking days) in the placebo group than the
ABT-436 group.
Treatment means suggest that ABT-436 appeared to have
greater efficacy than placebo on the primary outcome,
percentage of heavy drinking days, among participants with
relatively greater baseline stress as measured by the POMS
Tension-Anxiety, peak cortisol level during an ACTH
stimulation test, and STAI (Figure 2); however, none of
the five potential moderators were statistically significant
(all

terms,
p’s 40.152). The treatment effect did not differ by gender
or baseline drinks per day. The moderator results were
similar using the outcome, percentage of days abstinent
(see Supplementary Appendix 7).
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes
Averaged across the maintenance period, the ABT-436 group
had significantly greater percentage of days abstinent than
the placebo group (51.2 vs 41.6, respectively; p = 0.037;

 d = 0.31) (Table 2). This effect was largest in the first week
and remained consistent throughout the maintenance period
(Figure 1b). The treatment groups were not significantly
different on any of the other five drinking outcomes.
No significant differences existed between the ABT-436
group and the placebo group on alcohol-related craving
(PACS score; 9.9 vs 10.3, respectively; p = 0.571; d = 0.08) and
consequences (ImBIBe score; 12.9 vs 11.6, respectively;
p = 0.768; d = 0.05). Among the non-drinking outcomes,
averaged across the maintenance period, the smokers in the
ABT-436 group smoked significantly fewer cigarettes per
week (89.1 vs 98.3, respectively; p = 0.046; d = 0.39).
Safety
A total of 28 AE categories were reported in at least 5% of
participants from either treatment group (Table 3). Of these,
diarrhea was significantly greater in the ABT-436 group than
the placebo group (50.7% vs 19.7%, respectively; po0.001).
However, only four subjects stopped taking ABT-436 during
the study as a result of gastrointestinal complaints. Although
only a statistical trend, the ABT-436 group, compared with
the placebo group, had greater rates of anxiety (6.8% vs 0%,
respectively;
p = 0.058)
and
nausea
(24.7%
vs
12.7%,
respectively; p = 0.087). Among participants with these three
AE categories, the majority experienced ‘mild’ symptoms
(70%), whereas the remaining participants experienced
‘moderate’ (25%) and ‘severe’ symptoms (5%). Three serious
adverse events (SAEs) occurred during the treatment phase
of the trial: cellulitis proximal to an insect sting (ABT-436),
atrial fibrillation (ABT-436; occurring 9-weeks after dis-
continuing the study medication during the treatment
period), and peptic ulcer disease (placebo). None of the
serious adverse events were deemed related to the study

Note: Skewed outcomes were transformed as follows: square root transformations (drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percent days abstinent, ImBIBe, cigarettes per
week, and POMS); inverse transformation (percent very heavy drinking days). No imputation was used for missing outcome data.
aModels are based on an mITT population that included subjects who received at least one dose of medication (N = 144; ABT-436 = 73, placebo = 71). One additional
placebo subject had no drinking data during the maintenance period, and one ABT-436 subject was missing data on a baseline covariate, resulting in an analyzable
N = 142 (ABT-436 = 72, placebo = 70).
bLSMEANS for continuous drinking outcomes are based on the outcome variable (untransformed for interpretative purposes), averaged across the study maintenance
phase (weeks 2–12), and were obtained from a mixed model that included the treatment group, week, site, treatment goal, trait anxiety, years of regular dinking, pre-
randomization reducer status, baseline value of the outcome, and the treatment group by week interaction. Corresponding Cohen’s d and p-values are based on the
same model but with the appropriately transformed outcome variable.
cOdds ratios and corresponding p-values are derived from a logistic regression model without covariates. Covariates were not included in order to avoid bias due to the
low number of events (Peduzzi et al, 1996).
dUnless otherwise noted, LSMEANS for non-drinking outcomes are from models similar to those used for drinking outcomes, but are averaged across study weeks 2, 3,
5, 7, 9, and 13; and only include treatment group, week, site, baseline value of outcome, and the treatment group by week interaction.
eThe model for cigarettes per week included only patients who were smokers at baseline (ie, smoked at least one cigarette per day in the past week) (n = 49;
ABT-436 = 23, placebo = 26).
fThe model for PACS included additional covariates: treatment goal, alcohol dependence severity, and years of regular drinking.
gThe model for ImBIBe included an additional covariate: any prior alcohol treatment history (inpatient or outpatient) including AA attendance.

DISCUSSION
This multisite study evaluated the efficacy and safety of
ABT-436, a vasopressin V1b receptor antagonist, in a mITT
population of 144 alcohol-dependent participants. This is the
first clinical trial of ABT-436 and the first multi-site trial
to evaluate a vasopressin V1b receptor antagonist in an
alcohol-dependent
population.
Participants
receiving
ABT-436
had
significantly
greater
percentage
of
days
abstinent
than
those
receiving
placebo
(51.2
vs
41.6,
respectively; p = 0.037; d = 0.31). Although the primary
outcome, percentage of heavy drinking days, was lower in
participants receiving ABT-436 compared with placebo, this
difference was not statistically significant (31.3 vs 37.6,
respectively; p = 0.172; d = .20). No significant differences
were found between the two groups on any other measures
of drinking, alcohol craving, or alcohol-related consequences.
It has been postulated that the release of vasopressin
during alcohol withdrawal in alcohol-dependent individuals
could foster a negative emotional state through stress
sensitization, leading to an escalation in drinking (Edwards
et al, 2011). Several lines of evidence support a relationship
between vasopressin and drinking. For example, vasopressin
and its receptors are highly expressed in the extended
amygdala, an area important for stress sensitization and for
stress-induced alcohol consumption (Koob, 2008). Increases
in serum and urine vasopressin levels have been observed

Efficacy of V1b receptor antagonist for alcohol dependence

Neuropsychopharmacology
 during alcohol withdrawal, particularly when symptoms are
severe (Eisenhofer et al, 1985; Trabert et al, 1992). Finally,
Zhou et al, (2011) reported higher levels of basal vasopressin
mRNA levels in the medial/central amygdala in Sardinian
alcohol-preferring rats compared with Sardinian alcohol-
non-preferring rats.
If ABT-436 works to attenuate the AVP/V1b-mediated
stress response and, consequently, this leads to reduced
drinking, then ABT-436 should theoretically have greater
efficacy among individuals with relatively high levels of
stress. Indeed, in this study, alcohol-dependent participants
who experienced ‘higher stress’ at baseline appeared to
respond better to ABT-436 than those with fewer stress
symptoms (Figure 2). Although the treatment-by-moderator
interactions were not significant, the ABT-436 group had
greater efficacy than placebo in subgroups with higher
baseline trait anxiety (STAI), tension-anxiety (POMS), and
peak cortisol in response to ACTH stimulation test. The
latter, in particular, would be consistent with previous work
suggesting that ABT-436’s mechanism of action appears to
be mediated by HPA axis reductions in serum ACTH and
cortisol levels (Katz et al, 2016a). Compared with normative
data, these subgroups had clinically significant levels of
anxiety; the average STAI score in the elevated anxiety
subgroup
(mean = 47.4)
was
similar
to
that
of
adult
neuropsychiatric patients diagnosed with anxiety (approxi-
mately = 48). In addition, the average POMS Tension-
Anxiety score in the elevated subgroup (mean = 12.4) was
almost one standard deviation above the normative adult
mean (approximately = 8) (Nyenhuis et al, 1999; Spielberger
et al, 1983). However, despite the fact that ABT-436 had
greater efficacy among participants with elevated stress
symptoms, the compound did not produce a direct and
measurable anxiolytic effect in these subgroups. For example,
among those with elevated POMS Tension-Anxiety at
baseline, the mean reduction in POMS Tension-Anxiety
score from baseline to the end of treatment was not
significantly different between the ABT-436 and placebo
groups (4.7 and 5.2, respectively). Thus, although baseline
anxiety may moderate the efficacy of ABT-436, the current
study does not support a reduction in anxiety as the primary
mediator/mechanism by which ABT-436 reduces drinking. It
is possible that ABT-436 reduced the stress response,
compared with placebo, and it was simply not captured
here. For example, ABT-436 may reduce drinking through
stress systems that cannot be captured by standard anxiety
tests. Future trials might maximize the treatment effect of
ABT-436
by
enriching
the
treatment
population
with
participants who have clinically elevated anxiety (and/or
hyper-reactivity to stress). In addition, progress toward
understanding
the
mechanism
of
ABT-436
could
be
enhanced by developing better measures, which are sensitive
and predictive to evaluate alcoholic’s response to stress.
Although the mechanism of action appears to be related to
the HPA axis, ABT-436 crosses the blood-brain barrier
(AbbVie, data on file), and thus it also may act on
extrahypothalamic areas, including the extended amygdala,
an area involved in the brain stress system (Koob, 2008). It
has recently been hypothesized that medications may need to
normalize, rather than block, the activity of the HPA axis
because of the blunted response of the HPA axis in chronic
alcoholics (Adinoff et al, 2005). In addition, it has been
postulated that chronic alcohol use drives the extrahypotha-
lamic stress system increasing extrahypothalamic CRF as
well
as
vasopressin
to
drive
compulsive-like
drinking
(Vendruscolo et al, 2015). For example, evidence of a
sensitized central amygdala includes a greater increase in
CRF mRNA in alcohol-dependent rats than those observed

Efficacy of V1b receptor antagonist for alcohol dependence
ML Ryan et al

Neuropsychopharmacology
 in nondependent rats (Roberto et al, 2010). In addition, a
CRF antagonist, D-Phe-CRF12-41 injected directly into the
central nucleus of the amygdala, selectively decreased alcohol
drinking in dependent but not nondependent rats (Funk
et al, 2006). Similar results were observed in the same animal
model of dependence with systemic administration of CRF-1
antagonists (Funk et al, 2006) and a V1b antagonist
(Edwards et al, 2011).
It is interesting to note that, relative to placebo, ABT-436
significantly reduced the frequency of drinking episodes
(as measured by percentage of days abstinent), but not the
amount of drinking (drinks per day). The reason for this
mixed effect on drinking pattern is unclear. Other medica-
tions, such as acamprosate, which, like ABT-436, are thought
to impact the withdrawal/negative affect stage of drinking
(DeWitte et al, 2005; Myrick et al, 2007), also have more of
an effect on the frequency of drinking and less on total
alcohol consumption. In contrast, medications like naltrex-
one, which influence the reward aspect of AUD (O’Malley
et al, 2002; Davidson et al, 1996, 1999), have the opposite
effect. For example, acamprosate increased the number of
days abstinent in a clinical trial (Mason, 2005) but this
medication did not reduce the number of drinks consumed
after the initial drinking before human laboratory trials
(Myrick et al, 2009; O’Malley et al, 2004). In contrast,
naltrexone decreased the amount of alcohol consumed in
human laboratory paradigms (Anton et al, 2004; O’Malley
et al, 2002) and in clinical trials (particularly by decreasing
the number of heavy drinking days), but had no impact on
the frequency of drinking (Maisel et al, 2012). Thus, it is
possible that the effect of ABT-436 on the withdrawal/
negative affect (stress) domain has more of an impact in
reducing the frequency of drinking than in reducing total
alcohol consumption.
In this trial, few subjects were able to achieve total
abstinence or no heavy drinking days; moreover, the
ABT-436 and placebo groups did not differ on rates of these
outcomes. The fact that only a small minority of participants
(13%) expressed a goal of achieving total abstinence at
baseline may have influenced this outcome. Also, partici-
pants were allowed to drink up to randomization and thus,
may not have been able to make the drastic reduction in
drinking necessary to achieve total abstinence by the end of
the 1-week titration period. Future trials may be more likely
to find an effect on abstinence and no heavy drinking
outcomes by (a) enriching the study population with
participants who have a goal of achieving these specific
outcomes; (b) including a mandatory abstinence period prior
randomization (eg, of at least 3 days); and (c) giving
participants a longer period of time to change their drinking
behavior before outcome assessment (grace period).
ABT-436 reduced the number of cigarettes per week
among smokers. Drinking and smoking often co-occur, and
both alcohol and nicotine can alter the physiological and
subjective
effects
of
each
drug
in
terms
of
craving,
reinforcement, and self-administration (reviewed by Britt
and Bonci, 2013). As with drinking, stress-induced negative
emotional states in animals can also drive smoking behavior
(Koob and Le Moal, 2006; Leao et al, 2015). A recent review
of
biological
mechanisms
underlying
the
relationship
between stress and smoking examined this relationship in
humans (Richards et al, 2011). Although, the mechanism by
which nicotinic receptors modulate drinking behaviors is not
fully characterized, Leao et al, (2015) found that activation of
nicotinic receptors facilitates the escalation of alcohol
consumption suggesting that individual nicotinic receptor
function individual differences may effect one’s propensity
for alcohol misuse. Indeed, stimulation of nicotinic receptors
appear to have multiple effects on the brain, including
modulation of areas involved in negative emotional states
(reviewed by Wu et al, 2014). Thus, it is not surprising that
medications like ABT-436, which are thought to reduce
negative emotional states, could reduce smoking as well as
alcohol consumption.
Because this was the first multisite clinical trial using
ABT-436 in an alcohol-dependent population, the side-effect

 profile was closely monitored. ABT-436 was well tolerated,
with generally mild-to-moderate side effects. The most
common side effect was diarrhea, which occurred in 51%
of the ABT-436-treated participants and 20% of the placebo
group. However, only one participant receiving ABT-436
withdrew from the study because of this side effect. ABT-436
also did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the adrenal
gland (ACTH stimulation test), mood, liver and renal
function, and hematology and blood chemistry.
In summary, blocking the V1b receptors with ABT-436
reduced the frequency of drinking without significantly
altering the amount consumed. Evidence exists that alcohol-
dependent participants with high stress levels responded
better to ABT-436 in reducing both the frequency of
drinking and heavy drinking days. Interestingly, ABT-436
was also efficacious in reducing smoking, perhaps by
targeting a common withdrawal/stress domain underlying
both
drinking and smoking behaviors.
Future studies
exploring vasopressin and other targets within the stress
system should focus on participants with high baseline stress
levels
because
this
subpopulation
may
be
particularly
responsive. This could effectively be accomplished in a
human laboratory study testing the effects of ABT-436, as
well
as
other
anti-stress
medications,
on
a
validated
paradigm of stress induction and stress-induced drinking.
Co-occurring alcohol and tobacco use also should be
considered when planning future studies, as medications
targeting the stress system response may be beneficial in
treating both addictions.
