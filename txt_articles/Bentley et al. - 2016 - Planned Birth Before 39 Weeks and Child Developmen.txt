OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of gestational age and mode of birth with early child 
development.
METHODS: Population-based record linkage cohort study was conducted among 153 730 live-
born infants of ≥32 weeks’ gestation with developmental assessments at school age, in New 
South Wales, Australia, 2002 to 2007. Children were assessed in 5 domains: physical health 
and well-being, language and cognition, social competence, emotional maturity, and general 
knowledge and communication. Children scoring in the bottom 10% of national domains 
were considered developmentally vulnerable, and children developmentally vulnerable 
for ≥2 domains were classified as developmentally high risk (DHR), the primary outcome. 
Robust multivariable Poisson models were used to obtain individual and combined adjusted 
relative risks (aRRs) of gestational age and mode of birth for DHR children.
RESULTS: Overall, 9.6% of children were DHR. The aRR (95% confidence interval) of being 
DHR increased with decreasing gestational age (referent: 40 weeks); 32 to 33 weeks 1.25 
(1.08–1.44), 34 to 36 weeks 1.26 (1.18–1.34), 37 weeks 1.17 (1.10–1.25), 38 weeks 1.06 
(1.01–1.10), 39 weeks 0.98 (0.94–1.02), ≥41 weeks 0.99 (0.94–1.03), and for labor induction 
or prelabor cesarean delivery (planned birth; referent: vaginal birth after spontaneous 
labor), 1.07 (1.04–1.11). The combined aRR for planned birth was 1.26 (1.18–1.34) at 37 
weeks and 1.13 (1.08–1.19) at 38 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Early (at <39 weeks) planned birth is associated with an elevated risk of poor 
child development at school age. The timing of planned birth is modifiable, and strategies 
to inform more judicious decision-making are needed to ensure optimal child health and 
development.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Fetal brain 
development accelerates after 32 weeks’ gestation, 
and children born before 39 weeks have elevated 
risk of poor development. Internationally, modal 
gestational age has decreased due to increasing 
numbers of planned births (prelabor cesarean 
delivery and labor induction).
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Poor child development 
is exacerbated by early planned birth. This timing is 
potentially modifi
 able, and benefi
 ts of waiting should 
be communicated to clinicians, mothers, and families, 
and strategies should be developed to inform more 
judicious clinical decision-making.

Fetal growth and development is a 
continuum, with the optimal time of 
birth at 39 to 40 weeks’ gestation. 
Fetal brain development accelerates 
rapidly in the later stages of 
pregnancy from 32 weeks’ gestation, 
making it vulnerable to disruption 
from shortened gestation. 
1, 
 
2 There 
is growing evidence that, in addition 
to preterm birth (≤37 weeks’ 
gestation), infants born early term 
(37–38 weeks) have a greater risk of 
neurodevelopmental impairment or 
poor school performance compared 
with infants born at the optimal 
time. 
3 
 
– 
7 Early childhood development 
is also important for future 
educational achievement, health, 
and well-being, 
 
8 with 11% to 17% of 
children aged 4 to 6 years considered 
to be developmentally high risk 
(DHR) by school age.

Gestational age at birth arises after 
the spontaneous onset of labor or is 
determined by a clinical decision that 
birth should occur. In the latter case, 
these planned births are performed 
by induction of labor or prelabor 
cesarean delivery. Internationally, 
significant changes in clinical practice 
have seen an increase in planned 
births before 39 to 40 completed 
weeks’ gestation, particularly at 
37 to 38 weeks, and a decrease in 
modal gestational age from 40 to 
39 weeks. 
13 
 
 
–17 This “left-shift” in 
gestational age has been attributed 
to increasing primary and repeat 
cesarean delivery, greater use of 
labor induction, and the clinical 
perception that birth just before 
the optimal date carries little 
significant morbidity. 
17, 
 
18 If poorer 
neurodevelopmental outcomes are 
a possible consequence of early 
planned birth, and waiting is at all 
possible, then there is an urgent need 
to inform clinicians, mothers, and 
families to ensure judicious decision-
making in curtailing pregnancy.
To date, there has been no 
investigation of the potential 
impact of early planned birth on 
child development, specifically 
the contribution of mode of birth. 
This study used record linkage 
of population birth, hospital, and 
development data to investigate the 
association of gestational age and 
mode of birth with development at 
school age.
METHODS
Study Population and Data Sources
The study population included all 
live births from 32 weeks’ gestation 
between 2002 and 2007 in New 
South Wales (NSW), Australia. The 
study cohort consisted of births that 
subsequently had measures of early 
development in their first year of full-
time school in 2009 or 2012.
Birth records for 2002 to 2007 were 
obtained from the NSW Perinatal 
Data Collection, a population-based 
statutory surveillance system 
that includes all live births and 
stillbirths of ≥20 weeks’ gestation 
or ≥400 g birth weight if gestational 
age is unknown. The birth record 
captures information on maternal 
characteristics, pregnancy, labor 
and delivery factors, and infant 
outcomes. Maternal and infant 
hospital admission records were 
obtained from the NSW Admitted 
Patient Data Collection and used to 
supplement information recorded 
at the time of birth. Admission 
records include demographic, facility, 
diagnosis, and procedure information 
for every inpatient admitted to any 
public or private hospital in NSW. 
Development for children in their 
first year of full-time school (aged 
4–6 years) was ascertained from the 
Australian Early Development Census 
(AEDC) developmental assessment 
instrument. 
19 The AEDC is a triennial 
census that was first implemented 
in 2009. The AEDC is the Australian 
adaptation of the Canadian Early 
Development Index. 
20 Teachers 
assess and record information on 
nearly 100 characteristics for each 
child, which are then combined 
and aggregated to calculate scores 
for 5 domains and 16 subdomains. 
AEDC records for 2009 and 2012 
were available for this study. Birth, 
hospital, and development records 
for individuals were probabilistically 
linked by the NSW Centre for Health 
Record Linkage. 
21 The study was 
approved by the NSW Population 
and Health Services Research Ethics 
Committee (reference number 
2012-12-430).
Gestational Age and Mode of Birth
The study exposures of interest were 
gestational age and mode of birth, 
which are reliably reported in birth 
data. 
22 Gestational age, reported in 
completed weeks as determined by 
the best clinical estimate including 
early ultrasound and last menstrual 
period, was categorized as 32 to 33, 
34 to 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 (referent), 
and ≥41 weeks. Mode of birth 
(vaginal birth or cesarean delivery) 
and onset of labor (spontaneous, 
labor induction, or prelabor cesarean 
section) were combined to create 
5 mutually exclusive groups, with 
vaginal birth after spontaneous labor 
as the referent group. Planned births 
(labor induction or prelabor cesarean 
delivery) were also classified and 
compared with infants born after 
spontaneous labor.
Early Childhood Development
The AEDC instrument assesses 
development in 5 main domains: 
physical health and well-being, 
language and cognitive skills, social 
competence, emotional maturity, and 
communication skills and general 
knowledge. 
23 Each domain contains 
a number of related but distinct 
developmental subdomains. The 
AEDC instrument has been through 
extensive development and testing 
and shown to be reliable and valid. 
24 
– 
26 
For each domain and subdomain, 
children scoring in the bottom 
10% nationally were considered 
developmentally vulnerable (DV) 
for the corresponding aspect of 
development.27 Children identified

as having special needs or aged <4 
years were not assigned a domain 
category. The primary study outcome 
was children who were DHR, defined 
as being DV on ≥2 of the 5 main 
domains. 
23 DV for selected domains 
and subdomains was considered a 
priori as separate secondary study 
outcomes and included the physical 
health and well-being domain, the 
language and cognitive development 
domain, and the gross and fine 
motor skills, basic literacy, and basic 
numeracy subdomains.
Confounders
We considered a number of possible 
confounders of the association 
between developmental outcomes 
and gestational age and mode of 
birth. These included, from birth 
records, maternal age, parity, 
timing of first antenatal visit, 
plurality, small for gestational age, 
 
28 5-minute Apgar score <7, sex, 
and socioeconomic status 
29; from 
birth and hospital records, maternal 
diabetes or hypertension, smoking 
during pregnancy, maternal country 
of birth, and private obstetric care; 
from hospital records, marital 
status at birth and major congenital 
conditions; and from development 
records, age at assessment, 
assessment year, and English as a 
second language. (See  
Table 1 for 
categorizations.)
Statistical Analysis
Gestational age, mode of birth, 
developmental outcomes, and 
confounders were described in 
contingency tables. Multivariable 
logistic regression with progressive 
backward elimination was used 
to construct a model for each of 
the developmental outcomes, with 
gestational age and mode of birth 
adjusted for potential confounders. 
Variables were retained if they were 
significant at P < .05 or if they were 
confounders based on a change in 
the adjusted associations of ≥10%. 
Once final models were determined,

robust Poisson generalized 
estimating equations with a log-link 
and exchangeable correlation were 
used to estimate adjusted relative 
risks (aRRs) and to account for the 
similarity of children assessed by 
the same teacher. Individual and 
combined adjusted associations 
for gestational age and by mode 
of birth or planned birth were 
calculated. To address confounding 
by indication for early planned birth, 
we repeated the analysis for low-
risk pregnancies, defined as women 
aged 20 to 34 years without diabetes 
or hypertension with a liveborn, 
singleton infant born at ≥37 weeks’ 
gestation, cephalic presenting, and 
with a birth weight for gestational 
age and sex between the 10th and 
90th percentiles. 
28 In addition, for 
multiparous women the previous 
pregnancy had to be low-risk, 
with the exception of noncephalic 
presentation. All analyses were 
performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 204 156 children with a 2009 
or 2012 AEDC assessment, 162 872 
(80%) had a linked birth record 
between 2002 and 2007. Children 
with no recorded gestational age or 
mode of birth or a gestational age 
<32 weeks (n = 1770; 1.1%) or no 
assigned domain category (n = 8405; 
5.2%) were excluded (n = 9142; 
5.6%), providing a study cohort of 
153 730 children with an average 
assessment age of 5.5 years (SD = 
0.35). Overall, 5.6% of infants were 
born at 32 to 36 weeks’ gestation and 
22.5% at 37 to 38 weeks. Planned 
birth accounted for 41.4% of all 
births ( 
Table 1). Among births at 37 
weeks, planned birth accounted for 
almost half (48.4%), and at 38 weeks 
they made up more than half (55.2%) 
(Supplemental Fig 2).
Overall, 9.6% of children were DHR 
and were more likely to be male, 
small for gestational age, or born 
to mothers with lower maternal 
age, with greater socioeconomic 
disadvantage, or who smoked during 
pregnancy ( 
Table 1). The proportion 
of DHR children decreased with 
increasing gestational age: 13.1% of 
preterm (<37 weeks) births, 10.2% 
of early-term (37–38 weeks) births, 
and 9.0% of term (39–40 weeks) 
births ( 
Table 1). The percentage 
of DV children ranged from 5.3% 
for language and cognitive skills to 
8.4% for physical health and well-
being ( 
Table 2). As with DHR, the 
proportion of DV children for each 
of the selected measures decreased 
with increasing gestational age and 
was lowest at 39 to 40 weeks ( 
Table 
2). The decreasing proportion of 
DHR or DV children with increasing 
gestational age was also apparent by 
labor onset (Supplemental Fig 3).
For all outcomes the observed 
proportion of DHR or DV children 
varied by the mode of birth and 
was higher for vaginal birth after 
spontaneous labor (DHR 9.9%, 
DV 5.5%–8.5%) and lower for 
labor induction (DHR 9.3%, DV 
5.2%–8.3%) and prelabor cesarean 
delivery (DHR 8.7%, DV 4.8%–
8.0%) ( 
Tables 1 and  
2). However, 
after adjustment for confounders, 
compared with vaginal birth after 
spontaneous labor, all modes of birth 
that involved obstetric interventions 
were consistently associated with 
a higher risk of being DHR or DV. 
The increased risk of being DHR or 
DV associated with labor induction 
(6%–18%) was similar to that of 
prelabor cesarean delivery (5%–
12%) ( 
Table 3). Cesarean section 
after labor induction was consistently 
associated with the largest increase 
in risk (14%–18%). The adjusted risk 
of being DHR or DV decreased with 
increasing gestational age to 39 to 
40 weeks. Infants born at 37 weeks’ 
gestation (14%–16%) and 38 weeks’ 
gestation (1%–8%) had a higher risk 
of being DHR or DV compared with 
those born at 40 weeks ( 
Table 3).

pattern of increasing risk with each 
mode of birth and shorter gestation is 
apparent. For example, the combined 
aRRs demonstrate that compared 
with vaginal birth after spontaneous 
labor at 40 weeks’ gestation, all other 
modes of birth at <37 weeks’ gestation 
increased the risk of being DHR by 
30% to 43%, at 37 weeks by 22% 
to 33%, and at 38 weeks by 10% 
to 20%. For planned birth at 37 to 
38 weeks’ gestation compared with 
spontaneous vaginal birth at 39 to 40 
weeks, the risk of being DHR increased 
by 17% (aRR 1.17; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.12–1.22). The pattern 
of increasing risk with each mode of 
birth and shorter gestation was similar 
for the other DV secondary outcomes 
(Supplemental Fig 4).
To address the potential for 
confounding by indication, we repeated 
the main analysis by using a subgroup 
of 54 848 (35.7%) women with 
low-risk pregnancies (Supplemental 
Table 4 and Supplemental Fig 5). 
The association between gestational 
age and developmental outcomes 
remained similar to the main results. 
However, the associations between 
DHR, DV in basic literacy, and DV in 
gross and fine motor skills and birth at 
37 weeks’ gestation strengthened. The 
association between developmental 
outcomes and mode of birth varied 
slightly. For infants born via vaginal 
birth after labor induction or by 
cesarean section after spontaneous 
labor, the risk of poor development 
attenuated. In contrast, the aRR 
between prelabor cesarean delivery 
and all developmental outcomes 
became similar to, or stronger than, 
the risk for cesarean delivery after 
labor induction. In these analyses, 
the estimated associations were less 
precise because of the reduced sample 
size.
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that early 
planned birth is independently 
associated with poor child 
development. This finding is 
significant because early birth due 
to planned birth now accounts for 
almost half of births before 39 to 
40 weeks’ gestation. The decision 
for planned birth is predicated on 
beliefs that it is safer for the baby 
or mother to deliver early. It is of 
paramount importance to ensure 
that there are no unintended harms 
from such a significant shift in 
clinical practice. Although increased 
risks of poor health in childhood 
are associated with early planned 
birth, early childhood development 
is another important aspect of child 
well-being that predicts adult social, 
educational, and health outcomes. 
To our knowledge this is the first 
study to investigate the combined 
risk of mode of birth and gestational 
age and demonstrate the increased 
risk of poorer early childhood 
development with early planned 
birth. We found not only that the risk 
of poor development increased for 
every additional week a child is born 
before 39 to 40 weeks’ gestation but 
that it increased more for modes of 
birth other than vaginal birth after 
the spontaneous labor, even among 
women whose pregnancies we were 
able to identify as being low risk.
For gestational age, our findings 
agree with other population-based 
record linkage studies showing an 
association between decreasing 
gestational age and poorer 
childhood neurodevelopmental 
and cognitive outcomes.

30–

However, our results extend this 
existing knowledge revealing that 
poor development is exacerbated in 
the case of planned birth, where a 
considered decision made to deliver 
an infant determines gestational age. 
Because the timing of planned birth 
is modifiable, delaying birth may

improve neurologic development. 
The biological underpinning for an 
elevated risk of poor development 
is multifactorial and related to the 
curtailment of brain development, 
resulting in reduced gray matter 
volume, underdevelopment of neural 
and physiologic pathways critical to 
supporting brain growth postnatally, 
and subsequent learning difficulties 
arising from behavioral disorders. 
1,

Although early birth may be 
indicated and of demonstrated 
short-term benefit for selected high-
risk pregnancies (eg, hypertension, 
prolonged pregnancy, suspected fetal 
growth restriction, prelabor rupture 
of membranes at term), for many 
conditions evidence is lacking or 
suggests little benefit (eg, suspected 
fetal macrosomia, maternal 
diabetes, preterm prelabor rupture 
of membranes). 
33 
 
 
 
– 
39 Furthermore, 
clinical research suggests that the 
threshold for planned birth and the 
gestational age for intervening has 
decreased. 
17, 
 
18 Numerous reasons 
have been used to justify early 
planned birth, including litigation, 
patient and provider perception 
of safety versus risk, reduced 
perinatal mortality, increased fetal 
monitoring, maternal age, obesity, 
and convenience. Despite these 
justifications and the increasing 
trend in planned births, national 
stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates 
have remained stable, and there has 
been no change in the risk of stillbirth 
from 36 to 40 weeks’ gestation.40 
Furthermore, recent studies from the 
United States have demonstrated that 
reducing planned delivery before 39 
weeks’ gestation has not increased 
the rates of stillbirth. 
41, 
 
42
The study findings support 
clinical guidelines and policies 
recommending that labor induction 
or prelabor cesarean delivery for 
nonmedical reasons should not 
be routinely carried out before 39 
to 40 weeks’ gestation. Despite a 
specific maternity policy to this effect 
introduced in our own setting in 
2007, there has been no appreciable 
change in practice. 
43, 
 
44 There also 
exists substantial practice variation 
in the use and timing of labor 
induction or prelabor cesarean 
delivery. 
44 
–46 Alternative measures 
that encourage the peer review of 
medical indications for early birth 
and support education for health 
care providers have been shown 
to be effective in reducing rates of 
early planned birth and may be more 
successful by ensuring stronger 
thresholds for medical indication. 
47
The increased risk of poor child 
development is among many 
short- and long-term risks to an 
infant born a bit early. Therefore, 
the potential benefits and harms of 
early birth for the mother and infant 
must be balanced against those 
for continuing the pregnancy. This 
includes increased risk of neonatal 
and infant morbidity, pediatric 
emergency department visits, 
childhood hospitalizations, and 
health care costs. 
48 
 
– 
51 There are also 
studies suggesting that these effects, 
including poorer cognitive outcomes, 
may persist into adolescence and 
adulthood.52, 
 
53 The findings of this 
study add to the growing clinical 
and epidemiologic evidence that 
prolonging pregnancy (increasing 
gestational age), even at term (from 
37–38 weeks), can benefit brain

To support informed decision-
making with their pregnancy care 
provider, it is important for women 
and their families to have readily 
available and accessible information 
about the optimal duration of 
pregnancy and any increased risk 
of poorer development or other 
adverse outcomes associated 
with early planned birth. 
55 This 
information is relevant given recent 
research reporting that >90% 
of women indicated the earliest 
gestational age for safe delivery was 
before 39 weeks. 
56, 
 
57 Furthermore, 
another study reported that almost 
half of women thought a cesarean 
delivery without medical indication 
should be performed upon request, 
despite minimal knowledge about 
the risks and benefits of one. 
58 We 
advocate policies and strategies 
that support informed and shared 
decision-making for women, 
their families, and clinicians. 
Nevertheless, there are instances 
where the spontaneous onset of 
labor occurs before 39 weeks or 
planned birth is unavoidable, and 
it is important that appropriate 
interventions and support in 
early childhood are developed 
and provided for these potentially 
vulnerable children.
This study examined a large 
population-based cohort of 
children by using validated measures 
of early childhood development and 
reliably reported information for 
gestational age, mode of birth, and 
potential confounders. 
22, 
 
24, 
 
26, 
 
59 
Developmental outcomes were 
collected independently and 
prospectively of gestational age 
and mode of birth, and missing data 
were minimal. Follow-up through 
record linkage provided a cohort 
covering >80% of all children 
assessed in NSW in 2009 and 2012, 
with the remainder having been 
born outside NSW. Because of the 
limitations of using administrative 
data, we were unable to obtain 
information on every potentially 
relevant confounder. However, face 
validity is demonstrated with others 
studies investigating childhood 
development adjusting for factors 
we could not and reporting similar 
findings to ours for gestational 
age.3 The association between 
planned birth and development 
may be subject to confounding by 
indication. 
60 However, because the 
exact indications for planned birth 
are not captured in the data, we 
examined the association between 
a subgroup of low-risk pregnancies 
and obtained results consistent with 
the main analysis.
CONCLUSIONS
Early planned birth is associated 
with an elevated risk of poor child 
development. Because the timing of 
planned birth is modifiable, delaying 
birth for an additional week or more 
may have significant long-term 
benefits. Strategies and interventions 
to support and encourage more 
judicious decision-making, weighing 
the risks and benefits for early 
planned birth, are needed to
