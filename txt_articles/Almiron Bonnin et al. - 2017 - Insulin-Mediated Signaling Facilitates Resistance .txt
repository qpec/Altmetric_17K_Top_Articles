Abstract
Despite abundant evidence implicating receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK), including the platelet-derived growth factor recep-
tor (PDGFR), in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma (GBM), the
clinical use of RTK inhibitors in this disease has been greatly
compromised bythe rapid emergence of therapeutic resistance. To
study the resistance of proneural gliomas that are driven by a
PDGFR-regulated pathway to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
we utilized a mouse model of proneural glioma in which mice
develop tumors that become resistant to PDGFR inhibition.
We found that tumors resistant to PDGFR inhibition required
the expression and activation of the insulin receptor (IR)/insulin
growth-like factor receptor (IGF1R) for tumor cell proliferation
and survival. Cotargeting IR/IGF1R and PDGFR decreased the
emergence of resistant clones in vitro. Our findings characterize a
novel model of glioma recurrence that implicates the IR/IGF1R
signaling axis in mediating the development of resistance to
PDGFR inhibition and provide evidence that IR/IGF1R signaling
is important in the recurrence of the proneural subtype of glioma
in which PDGF/PDGFR is most commonly expressed at a high
level. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(4); 705–16. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) recognize extracellular signals
and activate intracellular adaptor proteins, which in turn mediate
downstream effectors such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphos-
phate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) or mitogen-acti-
vated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal–regulated
kinases (ERK1/2) to modulate important pathologic properties
of tumors including proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and cell
motility (1). Activation of RTKs has been linked to the initiation,
maintenance, and progression of many different tumor types
including glioblastoma (GBM; refs. 2, 3). GBM is one of the most
common malignant intracranial tumors in adults (4). Despite
optimal medical management, the median survival of patients
with GBM is only 12 to 15 months (4). Surgery, chemotherapy,
and radiation can contribute to an initial response, but most
GBMs progress despite therapy or become resistant to therapy and
recur. Therefore, significant efforts are currently under way to find
more effective approaches to treat GBM including the use of
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI).
TKIs have been used in the clinic to treat tumors in which there
was evidence for the pathologic activation of the RTK that they
target, and in some cases this approach has dramatically improved
patient survival (1, 2). Examples of this strategy currently being
used for treatment include epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) inhibition for lung cancer, human epidermal growth
factor 2 (HER2) inhibition for breast cancer, and breakpoint
cluster region (BCR)-Abelson (ABL) inhibition for chronic mye-
loid leukemia (CML; ref. 5). Recent transcriptomic analysis of
high-grade gliomas resulted in the characterization of four clin-
ically relevant subtypes: proneural, neural, classical, and mesen-
chymal glioblastoma (6). Each of these subtypes is defined by a
specific molecular signature (6). Genetic alterations resulting in
increased platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling are a characteristic
feature of the proneural subgroup of gliomas (6–8). The impor-
tance of PDGF signaling in the proneural subgroup of high-grade
gliomas, which is the least responsive to therapy, provided a
strong rationale for clinical trials to evaluate PDGFR inhibitors
in the treatment of this type of glioma (9). However, the clinical
efficacy of RTK inhibitors has been shown to be compromised by
the rapid emergence of resistance in both glioma (4, 10) and other
tumor types (11).
Multiple mechanisms of resistance to RTK-targeted therapy,
including mutation of the active site, amplification of the targeted
receptor, and activation of alternative RTKs, have been identified
in a variety of tumors (12). Given this diversity of mechanisms
known to contribute to the development of RTK resistance, we
sought to characterize therapeutic resistance to PDGF/PDGFR
inhibition so that novel clinical strategies to inhibit these key
drivers of tumor progression could be developed. This is

 especially important in the context of proneural gliomas where
the current standard of therapy has shown the least benefit relative
to the other subtypes of glioma (6).
Materials and Methods
Cell cultures
Primary mouse tumor sphere cells (TSCs) from CNS glioma or
from flank allografts were isolated as previously described (13).
The first two passages of TSCs were maintained in EGF-containing
(20 ng/mL) DMEM/F12 with 1X B27 supplement with insulin.
TSCs were then propagated in DMEM/F12 with 1X B27 supple-
ment with or without insulin, in a humidified 5% CO2 atmo-
sphere at 37�C.
Mouse allograft
To establish doxycycline-resistant allografts from doxycy-
cline-sensitive TSCs, we injected 100,000 doxycycline-sensitive
TSCs into Nu/Nu or C57BL/6J syngeneic mice. Following for-
mation of a palpable tumor, animals were treated with oral
doxycycline and were observed for regression in allograft size.
Oral doxycycline was always administered at 1 g/L in the
animal's drinking water. All tumors initially regressed. After
three months of treatment, recurrent flank allografts were
excised and cultured. All animal care was in accordance with
approved IACUC-approved protocols.
Basso mouse scale assessment
To assess neurological deficits in tumor-bearing mice, func-
tional hind limb strength is evaluated using the Basso mouse scale
as previously described (14).
Drugs
AG1295 (Sigma-Aldrich; ref. 15), OSI-906 (Selleckchem;
ref. 16), Imatinib (Sigma-Aldrich), LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich;
ref. 17) and UO126 (Qiagen; ref. 18) stock solutions were
prepared in DMSO and stored in �20�C. Doxycycline (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) is diluted in PBS as a stock and stored in
�20�C. All drugs were diluted into fresh media immediately
before experimentation.
SiRNA transfections
TSCs were seeded at 50,000 cells/mL and transfected with
Neofx (Ambion) per the manufacturer's manual. Pooled siRNA
targeting IR (Thermo Scientific), IGF1R (Thermo Scientific), and
the control siRNA siGlo (Thermo Scientific) were transfected at 25
nmol/L final concentration.
Cell growth and cell death
TSCs were seeded into 6 or 96 well plates at a concentration of
50,000 cells/mL and grown for 7 days. As a surrogate measurement
of cell number, total ATP was examined in lysed cells based on the
luminescence produced by the reaction of ATP with luciferase and
D-luciferin (ATPlite, PerkinElmer). For some experiments, cell
counts were determined on a Nexolom cell counter. Cell viability
was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) anal-
ysis of propidium iodide (PI) exclusion assay (19).
Western blotting and RTK antibody array
Cells lysed in RIPA buffer were size fractionated in 8% SDS-
PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to PVDF (Millipore).
Antibodies detecting cleaved
and
uncleaved
PARP,
total
PDGFRa/b, phospho-PDGFRa/b, total AKT, phospho-AKT,
total ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-ErbB2, total ErbB2,
phospho-IGF1R/IR, total IR, and total IGF1R were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology. Each antibody was diluted at
1:1,000 in TBST containing 5% BSA for overnight immuno-
blotting. An HRP-conjugated actin antibody (Sigma) was used
at 1:50,000 to detect b-actin as a loading control. The RTK
Antibody Array was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. Fol-
lowing treatment of TSC-S1 and TSC-R1 with doxycycline
(1 mg/mL) for 48 hours, whole-cell lysates were used to probe
RTK antibody arrays, upon which a series of antibodies to RTKs
were spotted in duplicate.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissues were perfusion fixed by immersion in 4% PFA
overnight, and then embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochem-
ical analysis was performed by the Norris Cotton Cancer Center
Research Pathology Shared Resource (Lebanon, NH) using stan-
dard techniques. Antibodies detecting PDGFRa/b and IR/IGF1R
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Each was diluted
at 1:500.
Real-time PCR
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and reverse
transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). To
examine mRNA levels, we utilized the iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad) and MyIQ Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Expres-
sion data were analyzed relative to untreated or DMSO control
and normalized to 18S Ct values. Primer sequences are provided
in Supplementary Table S2.
Generation and application of RTK signature
The RTK signature was derived from previously published data
from our lab (20). The microarray profile of untreated GFAP/tTA:
TRE/hPDGFB cells was compared with doxycycline-treated cells
by taking the log2-fold change of all genes in the array. A P value
was computed for each gene and –log10 transformed. These values
were used to generate an upregulated and downregulated profile;
in the upregulated profile, all downregulated genes were assigned
a zero value and vice versa for the downregulated profile. The
BASE algorithm was usedto calculate anRTK scorefor each patient
by taking the tumor gene expression profile and the upregulated
and downregulated signatures as input (21).
Data queries and statistical analysis
All data are representative of three or more independent experi-
ments, presented as the mean � SEM. We used the two-tailed
student t test to evaluate differences between two groups, and one-
way ANOVA to evaluate differences in multiple groups, followed
by the Tukey correction. Dose–response curves were compared
using two-way ANOVA, and each time point was compared with
the one-way ANOVA and corrected using the Tukey correction.
The frequency of recurrence in doxycycline and OSI-906 treated
TSCs was analyzed using a contingency table. Gene expression
data of human GBM or human proneural GBM were obtained
through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Heat map and hier-
archical clustering were performed by GENE-E software. All
statistical analyses were performed by Graphpad Prism 5 software.

 Results
Seeking an in vivo model to study the mechanism of resistance
to RTK inhibition in high-grade gliomas, we took advantage of the
PDGF/PDGFR-driven mouse model of proneural glioma devel-
oped previously in our laboratory (22). This model uses the glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter to drive the expression
of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) which regulates expression
of a transgene encoding human platelet-derived growth factor B
by binding to a tetracycline responsive element that is located just
upstream of the transgene (TRE; ref. 11). This GFAP/tTA:TRE/
hPDGFB mouse model produces tumors that were characterized
in our laboratory to faithfully model the proneural subtype of
glioma (20) as defined by Verhak and colleagues (6). Expression
of the hPDGFB ligand in the GFAP/tTA:TRE/hPDGFB mouse
drives tumorigenesis. PDGFB is recognized by both PDGFRA and
PDGFRB homodimers or heterodimers (23). Exposure to either
tetracycline or doxycycline inhibits transcription of the hPDGFB
transgene to decrease PDGFR signaling, thereby mimicking
important aspects of the therapeutic activity of RTK inhibitors
(19, 20, 22).
To study the effectiveness of targeted RTK inhibition on
established PDGF/PDGFR-driven high-grade proneural glio-
mas, we treated GFAP/tTA:TRE/hPDGFB mice showing evi-
dence of glioma. We withdrew oral doxycycline administration
from adult GFAP/tTA:TRE/hPDGFB mice to allow hPDGFB
production. Then, when these mice exhibited symptoms of a
CNS tumor, we reexposed them to oral doxycycline. In this
mouse model, progressive paralysis is an effective surrogate for
tumor development (22), and it can be measured using the
Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion (14, 22, 24). We evaluated
mice during the course of oral doxycycline administration and
found that even though all mice (n ¼ 30) treated with doxy-
cycline exhibited evidence of tumor regression, some animals
relapsed after a period of remission (n ¼ 8) developing dis-
abilities in locomotion we could recognize as evidence of
tumor progression (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Tumors
arising in these animals that became resistant to treatment were
used to prepare TSCs, designated TSC-R1, TSC-R2, and TSC-R3
(Supplementary Table S1). These cultures were evaluated in
subsequent experiments.
We also developed an allograft model to study resistance to
inhibition of PDGFR in glioma driven to grow by PDGF/PDGFR.
We prepared TSCs from individual tumors that arose in GFAP/
tTA:TRE/hPDGFB animals that had not been exposed to doxycy-
cline. The growth of these TSC cultures was sensitive to doxycy-
cline, and they were designated TSC-S1 and TSC-S2 (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Fig. S1A and Supplementary Table S1). Subse-
quently, we injected these TSCs into the flank of syngeneic
animals. Once flank tumors were approximately 300 mm3, ani-
mals bearing these tumor allografts were treated with oral doxy-
cycline (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). As we observed in the
spontaneous model described above, we found that all mice
treated with doxycycline exhibited tumor regression (n ¼ 17),
but some animals (n ¼ 13) relapsed after a period of remission of
1 to 3 months (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These recurrent tumors
grew despite continued oral doxycycline treatment. TSCs from
these relapsed tumors provided a second set of cellular reagents
from resistant tumors, designated TSC-R4, TSC-R5, and TSC-R6
(Supplementary Table S1) with which to pursue these studies of
therapeutic resistance.
TSCs derived from recurrent proneural hPDGFB-driven tumors
are resistant to PDGF/PDGFR inhibition
While hPDGFB suppression mediated by doxycycline expo-
sure (Supplementary Fig. S2A) dramatically inhibited the
growth of TSC-S lines, it had no significant effect on the growth
of TSC-R cultures, regardless of whether they were derived from
de novo hPDGFB-driven CNS glioma or hPDGFB-driven flank
allografts (Fig. 1A and Supplementary S2A). Further validating
the resistance of TSC-Rs to PDGF/PDGFR signaling inhibition,
TSC-Rs exhibited a significantly decreased sensitivity to treat-
ment with Imatinib, a pharmacologic inhibitor of PDGFR that
readily suppressed the growth of TSC-Ss (Fig. 1B; ref. 25). To
examine the effect of PDGF/PDGFR signaling on the viability of
these TSCs, we used a dye-exclusion assay. After exposing TSCs
to doxycycline or AG1295, a chemical inhibitor of PDGFR, we
incubated these cultures with propidium-iodide (PI) and eval-
uated them. Inhibition of PDGFR using either doxycycline or
AG1295 induced cell death in TSC-S cultures but not in TSC-R
cultures (Fig. 1C and 1D). To confirm the induction of apo-
ptotic cell death, we examined PARP cleavage following inhi-
bition of PDGF/PDGFR in the doxycycline-sensitive and resis-
tant TSCs (Fig. 1E). Cleaved PARP, which provides evidence of
apoptosis, was detected only in TSC-Ss and not in TSC-Rs
following the inhibition of PDGF/PDGFR signaling. This pro-
vides additional evidence that cell survival of TSC-Rs was not
affected by inhibition of PDGF/PDGFR signaling (Fig. 1C–E).
These in vitro studies indicate that TSCs derived from our in vivo
models retain the PDGF sensitivity of the tumors from which
they were derived.
Proneural TSCs resistant to PDGF/PDGFR inhibition require
PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling for cellular proliferation
Because the function of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2
signaling pathways in driving cellular proliferation is well
characterized (26, 27), we examined whether PDGFR activation
regulated these second messengers in TSCs. As expected, treat-
ment of all TSC lines with doxycycline reduced hPDGFB mRNA
to undetectable levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and conse-
quently decreased the levels of PDGFR phosphorylation as
shown in several representative cultures (Fig. 2A). Also, treat-
ment with AG1295, a PDGFR inhibitor, resulted in a marked
reduction of PDGFR phosphorylation in all treated cell cultures
as shown in several representative cultures (Fig. 2B; ref. 15). In
sensitive lines, doxycycline, as well as pharmacologic inhibition
of PDGFR with AG1295 or imatinib, suppressed AKT and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation as shown for several representative
cultures (Fig. 2A and B), reduced cellular growth, and increased
cell death (Fig. 1A–D). Consistent with these data, expression
of a constitutively activated AKT (myristoylated-AKT) rescued a
representative sensitive TSC line, TSC-S2, from doxycycline-
mediated growth suppression (Supplementary Fig. S3A) illus-
trating the importance of AKT activation in PDGF/PDGFR-
mediated growth of TSC-Ss. In TSC-R cultures, however, PDGFR
inhibition had less of an effect on the canonical PDGFR
downstream targets, AKT and ERK1/2 (Fig. 2A and B). Whether
the PDGFR inhibition was mediated by doxycycline treatment
or pharmacological inhibition, it had less or no detectable
effect on the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 as well as
no significant effect on cellular growth in TSC-Rs (Figs. 1A
and 2A). These findings indicate that TSC-Rs are able to main-
tain AKT and ERK1/2 activation in the absence of PDGFR

 signaling. This loss of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK regulation by
PDGF/PDGFR provides evidence that PI3K/AKT and MAPK/
ERK may still be key mediators of proliferation and survival in
TSC-Rs. Moreover, it suggests TSC-Rs have developed an alter-
native mechanism for maintaining the activation of these path-
ways, thereby conferring resistance to PDGFR inhibition.
To evaluate whether the persistent activation of PI3K/AKT and
MAPK/ERK1/2 mediates the resistance of these glioma-derived
TSCs to PDGFR inhibition, we assessed the growth of these
cells after treatment with AG1295, LY294002, or UO126, phar-
macologic agents that specifically target PDGFR, PI3K, or ERK1/2,
respectively (Fig. 2C; refs. 1, 26, 27). In TSC-S cultures, we

 observed growth inhibitory effects with PDGFR, PI3K, or ERK1/2
inhibitors, as expected. In TSC-S cultures, the most significant
effect of these various inhibitors on growth was observed follow-
ing AG1295 inhibition of PDGFR (Fig. 2C), most likely because it
leads to the inhibition of both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2
axis (Fig. 2B). In TSC-R cultures, however, we observed a different
growth response following such drug treatments (Fig. 2C). None
of the resistant lines were sensitive to PDGFR inhibition, though
all but one of them (TSC-R3) were sensitive to the growth
inhibitory effect of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and the
ERK1/2 inhibitor, UO126 (Fig. 2C). The activity of these drugs
in a representative TSC-R cell line is demonstrated in Figure 2D.
The growth inhibitory effect of LY294002 and UO126 was sta-
tistically significant in all TSC-R lines except for TSC-R3 (Fig. 2C).
These findings support a model of resistance to RTK inhibition in
which the molecular alterations maintaining proliferation are
upstream of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 axis.
IR/IGF1R is required for proliferation of proneural hPDGFB-
driven TSCs after they become resistant to PDGF/PDGFR
inhibition
To determine if an alternative RTK upstream of AKTand ERK1/2
may be responsible for the maintenance of AKT and ERK1/2
activation and the proliferation of TSC-R cultures, we examined
the phosphorylation of a panel of RTKs in representative TSC
cultures (Fig. 2E). We found increased phosphorylation of three
RTKs in the resistant line: proto-oncogene Neu (ErBB2), muscle
specific kinase (MuSK), and insulin receptor (IR)/insulin growth-
like factor receptor (IGF1R; Fig. 2E). However, the increase in
MuSK and ErBB2 could not be validated by Western blot in these
cell lines or others.
Based on these data and previously reported findings support-
ing a role for IR/IGF1R in maintaining the activation of AKT and
ERK in GBM (3), we conducted a histologic analysis to charac-
terize the expression of IR/IGF1R throughout the process of
remission and recurrence in response to doxycycline-mediated
hPDGFB suppression in our allograft model. Recurrent tumors
that grew despite hPDGFB suppression invariably expressed IR/
IGF1R uniformly throughout the tissue analyzed and at a gener-
ally higher level than seen in tissue from primary tumors (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4A–S4C). Consistent with this observation, the
expression of IR and IGF1R was elevated in TSC-R cultures
compared with the levels in the parental TSC-S cultures from
which they were derived, as demonstrated in pairs of such cell
lines when examined for the steady-state level of encoding mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B) or in a representative pair of
such TSCs when examined for expression of pro-IR, total IR, or
IGF1R protein (Fig. 3A). We also observed that total protein levels
of IR and IGF1R decreased when insulin was present (Fig. 3A),
consistent with the increased protein turnover of RTKs following
ligand binding (1). Thesedata illustrate that IR/IGF1R isexpressed
in some cells within sensitive tumors and in TSC-Ss, but it
becomes much more abundant in resistant tumors and TSC-Rs.
This enhanced expression of IR/IGF1R in vitro and in vivo suggests
that activation of a preexisting IGF1R pathway might contribute to
the development of resistance to PDGFR inhibition in these
proneural glioma cells.
We used insulin as a tool to determine if there was a functional
role in TSC-Rs for the increased expression of IR and IGF1R, which
respond to both insulin and IGF (28–32). We found that in the
absence of insulin, cell death increased and relative cell growth
decreased in average by more than 50% in TSC-Rs (Fig. 3B
and 3C). Consistent with these data, insulin withdrawal resulted
in the inhibition of the canonical RTK downstream target, AKT, in
TSC-Rs, and a representative culture demonstrates this in Figure
3A. The proliferation of TSC-R3, which did not require the
activation of PI3K or MAPK (Fig. 2C), was unaffected by insulin
treatment (Fig. 3B). Importantly, doxycycline-sensitive TSC-Ss,
which were isolated and cultured in the same manner as TSC-Rs,
were insensitive to insulin withdrawal (Fig. 3B and 3C). We
observed no altered cellular growth or changes in cell death
following insulin withdrawal from the TSC-S cultures (Fig. 3B
and 3C), and in the absence of insulin, the downstream growth
regulatory mediators, AKT and ERK1/2, were not activated in
TSC-Ss, as demonstrated in a representative TSC-S culture
in Figure 3A. These findings suggest a functional role for IR and
IGF1R in the proliferation and survival of TSC-Rs.
To examine further the effect of IR/IGF1R inhibition on TSC-
Rs, we evaluated the response of TSCs to OSI-906, which
inhibits IR and IGF1R activation (ref. 16; Fig. 3D). Comparing
the relative cell growth and cell death of TSC-Rs and TSC-Ss in
the presence of OSI-906, we found that TSC-Rs are much more
sensitive to OSI-906 than the TSC-Ss from which they
were derived (Fig. 3E and F, and Supplementary Table S1).
We confirmed this finding utilizing pooled siRNAs to modu-
late IR expression. We found that inhibition of IR expression
led to a dramatic growth inhibitory effect in TSC-Rs when
compared with the effect seen in a representative TSC-S culture
(Supplementary Figs. S5C and S5D). The same siRNAs were
used in Supplemental Figs. 5C and 5D. Moreover, inhibition of
phosphorylation of IR/IGF1R using OSI-906 also resulted in
inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 activation in TSC-R1 but not in
TSC-S2 (Fig. 3D). These findings are consistent with the obser-
vation that upon PDGF/PDGFR inhibition sensitive TSCs stop
growing and die, while the resistant TSCs do not (Fig. 1A–E).
Resistant cells are clearly no longer dependent on PDGF/
PDGFR signaling, because they have acquired an alternative
RTK, IR/IGF1R, to drive proliferation and survival through AKT
and ERK1/2 activation.
Proliferation and survival modulation by IR/IGF1R activa-
tion is not evident in the doxycycline-sensitive cultures, TSC-Ss
(Fig. 3B and 3C), despite the clear presence of IR/IGF1R in these
sensitive cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Figs. S5C and S5D).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the functional potential of IR/
IGF1R signaling may be masked during robust PDGF/PDGFR
growth stimulatory pathway signaling in the sensitive TSCs. To
test this hypothesis, we incubated sensitive cells, TSC-Ss, in a
dose range (25–100 pg/mL) of doxycycline that we determined
in preliminary experiments was adequate to inhibit growth but
did not cause cell death. We then evaluated the effect of insulin
on the proliferation of these cells. Although IR/IGF1R signaling
did not enhance the proliferation of sensitive TSC when the
PDGF/PDGFR pathway was active (Fig. 3B), when PDGF/
PDGFR activation was diminished the effect of insulin on
proliferation of TSC-S became obvious (Fig. 4A and 4B). Con-
sistent with these observations, we found that when hPDGFB
expression was suppressed in the sensitive TSCs, insulin
contributed to maintaining the phosphorylation levels of
downstream mediators shared by the PDGFR and IR/IGF1R
pathways, including SHP2, AKT, and ERK1/2 (Fig. 4C). We
observed that AKT was particularly sensitive to IR/IGF1R inhi-
bition during doxycycline-mediated hPDGFB suppression, as

 indicated by the sharp decrease in its phosphorylation seen
following insulin-withdrawal from TSC-Ss in the presence of
doxycycline (Fig. 4C). Unlike our observation that insulin
partially rescues the inhibition of cell growth mediated by
doxycycline (Fig. 4B), the inhibition of cell growth mediated
by the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 was unaffected by insulin
in TSC-Ss and is demonstrated here in a representative line
in Figure 4D. These findings suggest that the IR/IGF1R pathway
is already expressed and is either active or capable of being
activated in TSCs from sensitive tumors. During suppression of
PDGFR, the driver RTK, IR/IGF1R is able to mediate prolifer-
ation of these sensitive cells through the activation of down-
stream mediators shared with PDGFR.
To further characterize the role of IR/IGF1R in the develop-
ment of resistance to PDGFR inhibition in hPDGFB-driven
proneural TSCs, we examined the effect of IR/IGF1R inhibition

 on the emergence of TSC populations resistant to PDGFR
inhibition (Fig. 4E). We
plated
5,000 freshly dispersed
hPDGFB-driven proneural cells in 24-well plates and incubated
them in the presence of insulin for 6 weeks in increasing doses
of OSI-906 alone or in combination with doxycycline using
DMSO as the vehicle. The concentrations of doxycycline and
OSI-906 used were previously shown to significantly inhibit the
proliferation of TSC-Ss and TSC-Rs, respectively (Fig. 1A
and 3D). After this prolonged incubation, we observed the
emergence of tumor spheres in most of the cultures exposed to
doxycycline alone. The addition of OSI-906 to doxycycline,
however, resulted in a very significant reduction in the frequen-
cy with which tumorspheres appeared (Fig. 4E). The effect of
adding OSI-906 to the doxycycline-mediated hPDGFB suppres-
sion was dose dependent and this addition of OSI-906 achieved
approximately a 90% reduction of tumorsphere formation at a
dose of 0.5 mmol/L when compared with the DMSO control.
OSI-906 alone, however, had no effect on tumorsphere forma-
tion. We interpreted these findings to indicate that OSI-906–
mediated IR/IGF1R inhibition suppressed the expansion of the
subset of cells in the TSC-S cultures that were able to develop
resistance to doxycycline.

 IGF1R is associated with survival and RTK activity in a subgroup
of proneural GBMs with lower PDGFRA and PDGFRB levels
In an initial effort to explore the clinical relevance of our
current findings, we queried TCGA database seeking to iden-
tify evidence within the proneural subgroup of human GBM,
suggesting a pathologic role for IGF1R. Utilizing Verhak's
gene expression-based molecular classification of GBM, we
identified 95 proneural GBMs with complete mRNA data in
TCGA provisional dataset (6). Euclidian hierarchical cluster-
ing, based on the expression of the 58 known human RTKs,
identified two distinct patient groups: cluster "A" and cluster
"B" (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, cluster "B" has a 2.4-fold lower
average expression of PDGFRA (P < 0.0001) and a 1.5-fold
lower average expression of PDGFRB (P < 0.0001) than was
observed in cluster "A."
To develop a measure of RTK activity for each GBM sample, we
derived a "RTK signature" from the expression profile of TSC-Ss
treated with and without doxycycline. We assumed that RTK
drivers share common downstream pathways, and used this
signature to derive a RTK activity score for each patient. This
activity score was positively correlated with the expression of
PDGFRA (P < 0.0001) and PDGFRB (P < 0.0001) in the proneural
GBMs analyzed, which asserts its validity as a measure of RTK
activity.
To test RTKs that could potentially be driving tumor progres-
sion in these clusters, we correlated the mRNA expression level of
each RTK with RTK activity and survival. While many RTKs are
differentially expressed between clusters "A" and "B", we found
that in cluster "B," which has lower PDGFRA and PDGFRB levels
than were observed in cluster "A," IGF1R was the only RTK
amongst all 58 known human RTKs examined, whose expression
was positively correlated with both RTK activity (Spearman r ¼
0.2305, P ¼ 0.0384) and decreased survival (Spearman r ¼
�0.3326, P ¼ 0.0068). Furthermore, in this cluster, IGF1R expres-
sion was associated with shorter patient survival (Fig. 5B). We
interpret these data as being consistent with the possibility that
IGF1R-mediated RTK signaling might serve as an alternative
pathway driving proneural GBM progression in the absence of
high PDGF/PDGFR signaling.
Discussion
IR and IGF1R are homologous proteins (3, 30, 32, 33) which
share common ligands and common downstream targets (28–
32). These RTKs, which are widely coexpressed, are known to
heterodimerize activating various downstream targets impor-
tant for growth and survival (28, 34–38). Previous reports on
IR/IGF1R in the context of therapeutic resistance to targeted
RTK therapy have recognized the sensitization of various
tumors to RTK therapy that results when an inhibitor of IR/
IGF1R is used in combination with a second TKI, including
PDGFR inhibitors (39–48). For example, preclinical studies
have shown that dual targeting of IGF1R and PDGFRa/b act
synergistically to inhibit the growth of high-grade gliomas (39–
41). Similarly, it has been reported that that coinhibition of IR/
IGF1R and EGFR improves the treatment of subcutaneous GBM
xenografts in a synergistic fashion (46). Consistent with these
reports, insulin and IGF1 have been shown to antagonize EGFR
inhibition in EGFR-dependent GBM patient-derived mouse
xenografts (46). In the clinic, coinhibition of IR/IGF1R and
EGFR has been suggested to improve the response of lung,
breast, and head and neck cancers to RTK therapy in the clinic
(41–48). However, these recent reports suggesting a role for IR/
IGF1R in the sensitization of tumors to various TKIs including
PDGFR (39–48) have not addressed the role of IR/IGF1R in
acquired resistance and recurrence.
Our studies demonstrate that activation of IR/IGF1R is a
novel bypass RTK associated with the emergence of resistance to
PDGFR inhibition in PDGFR-driven proneural GBMs. These
studies provide a strong rationale for deciphering the mecha-
nism underlying IR/IGF1R activation in this setting. Unlike the
mechanism proposed by Akhavan, in which transcription of the
bypass RTK is suppressed by activation of the driver RTK in
EGFRvIII mutant GBMs (49), we found that IR/IGF1R was
expressed regardless of PDGFR activity in our model of pro-
neural glioma (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S6). IR/IGF1R was
expressed and was either active or capable of becoming acti-
vated in TSCs from primary, drug sensitive tumors (Fig. 4). As
resistance to PDGF/PDGFR inhibition emerges and IR/IGF1R
becomes the new driver of proliferation, tumor cells which can
respond to insulin become a dominant feature of the recurrent
tumor (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S4). In resistant tumor cells,
the original driver RTK, PDGFR, continues to be expressed and
is phosphorylated in the presence of PDGF (Fig. 2; Supple-
mentary Fig. S6A and S6B), but it no longer mediates viability
and proliferation through AKT and ERK1/2 activation (Figs. 1
and 2). Rather, there is an apparent loss of dependence of AKT
and ERK1/2 activation from PDGFR signaling as a new asso-
ciation between IR/IG1R and AKT and ERK1/2 becomes more
prominent.
These observations might be explained by the selection of a
subpopulation of cells, from within the primary sensitive PDGFR-
driven tumors that has acquired a growth dependence on IR/
IGF1R and thereby mediates resistance to PDGF/PDGFR inhibi-
tion upon treatment. Going forward, the development of TKI
combination therapies, targeting not only the driver RTKs, but
also the bypass RTKs, may significantly enhance treatment out-
comes in the proneural subgroup of GBM.
