ABSTRACT: Child abuse and neglect play a causal role in many mental health problems.
Knowing whether users of mental health services were abused or neglected as children could be
considered essential for developing comprehensive formulations and effective treatment plans. In
the present study we report the findings of a systematic review, using independent searches of
three databases designed to discover how often mental health staff find out whether their clients
were abused or neglected as children. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified. Most people
who use mental health services are never asked about child abuse or neglect. The majority of cases
of child abuse or neglect are not identified by mental health services. Only 28% of abuse or
neglect cases identified by researchers are found in the clients’ files: emotional abuse, 44%;
physical abuse, 33%; sexual abuse, 30%; emotional neglect, 17%; and physical neglect, 10%.
Between 0% and 22% of mental health service users report being asked about child abuse. Men
and people diagnosed with psychotic disorders are asked less than other people. Male staff ask less
often than female staff. Some improvement over time was found. Policies compelling routine
enquiry, training, and trauma-informed services are required.
KEY WORDS: assessment, child abuse, child neglect, maltreatment, mental health services,
review.
INTRODUCTION
Childhood abuse plays a causal role in many adult
mental health problems, including: depression, anxiety
disorders, eating disorders, sexual dysfunction, person-
ality disorders, dissociative disorder, substance abuse,
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder,
and psychosis (Kessler et al. 2010; Longden & Read
2016; Read 2013; Read et al. 2005; Varese et al. 2012;
Watson et al. 2014). People who were abused as chil-
dren are high users of adult mental health services.
They are more likely to be admitted to a psychiatric
hospital and have earlier, longer, and more frequent
admissions; have higher global symptom severity; and
are more likely to self-harm and kill themselves (Hep-
worth & McGowan 2013; Read 2013). A review of 52
inpatient studies found that over 50% of men and over
60% of women had been sexually or physically abused
as children (Read et al. 2008). Adults scoring high on
the Adverse Childhood Experiences scale are 10 times
more likely to be prescribed antipsychotics and 17
times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants
(Anda et al. 2007).
Until recently, very little was known about how well
mental health services act on this extensive and impor-
tant body of research. There have been no reviews of
studies about the extent to which mental health ser-
vices enquire about child abuse and neglect in general.
The only review in this whole field focussed only on
sexual abuse (Hepworth & McGowan 2013). It found
nine studies directly or indirectly addressing the fre-
quency of enquiry about sexual abuse, and two about
staff attitudes or knowledge. The reviewers concluded

 that
‘mental

routinely
enquire about childhood sexual abuse’, but noted that
the literature is ‘limited in quantity and is of moderate
to poor quality’.
Aims
The current systematic review provides the first ever
summary of studies investigating enquiry by adult men-
tal health services about five types of childhood adver-
sity: physical neglect, emotional neglect, physical abuse,
emotional abuse, and sexual abuse.
METHOD
Search strategy
The
search
strategy
was
based
on
the
Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses guidelines. An electronic database search was
completed, by one of the reviewers, using PsycINFO,
from the earliest record to December 2016. The search
terms, entered as ‘subject’ were ‘child abuse’ OR ‘child
neglect’ OR ‘sexual abuse’ OR ‘physical abuse’ OR
‘emotional abuse’ OR ‘psychological abuse’ OR ‘physi-
cal neglect’ OR ‘emotional neglect’ OR ‘child maltreat-
ment’ OR incest (35 692) – AND – ‘mental health
services’ OR ‘psychiatric services’ OR ‘mental health
assessment’ OR ‘psychiatric assessment’ OR ‘psycholog-
ical assessment’ OR ‘psychiatric nursing assessment’
OR ‘medical records’ OR ‘patient files’ (n = 42 999).
This search strategy was limited to research articles
and dissertations, but was not limited by language or
date. It produced 591 potentially-eligible references.
Studies whose titles suggested that they might have
the potential to address the issue of how often adult
mental staff/services ask about and/or record childhood
abuse or neglect were extracted. Inclusion criteria com-
prised a range of types of methodologies, such as stud-
ies addressing: (i) how much of the childhood abuse
and neglect identified in a clinical sample by research-
ers is recorded in the medical files of those people;
(ii) how many mental health service users report being
asked about childhood abuse or neglect; (iii) how often
mental health staff say they ask; and (iv) if when speci-
fic abuse/neglect questions are included in clinical
assessment protocols, how often those questions are
asked.
On this basis, 60 of the 591 papers were extracted.
Reading the abstracts of these 60 papers led to the
exclusion of 43, for the following reasons: 17 concerned
only the relationship between abuse/neglect and mental
health problems; eight were not studies (editorials,
practice
guidelines);
eight
were
about
how
staff
respond to abuse disclosures; six focussed on children’s
services; two on abusers; and two on training.
Thus, 17 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were
identified. Searching the references of these 17 papers,
and of the only relevant review, identified four more
studies, producing a total of 21 eligible for inclusion in
the review.
The same search strategy using identical terms was
deployed independently by two of the other reviewers,
using Scopus and Medline. No additional studies were
identified.
RESULTS
Studies
The most common research approach, used by nine of
the 21 studies (Table 1), was to compare the amount
of abuse or neglect identified by researchers with the
amount recorded in the clients’ clinical files (Briere &
Zaidi 1989; Craine et al. 1988; Cunningham et al.
2016; Goodwin et al. 1988; Jacobson et al. 1987; Lips-
chitz et al. 1996; Rossiter et al. 2015; Shannon et al.
2011; Wurr & Partridge 1996).
The other 12 studies used one or more of five other
methodologies (Agar et al. 2002; Cavanagh et al. 2004;
Cusack et al. 2004; Lab et al. 2000; Lothian & Read
2002; Mansfield et al. 2017; Mitchell et al. 1996; Read
& Fraser 1998a; Read et al. 2006; Rose et al. 1991;
Sampson & Read 2017; Xiao et al. 2016).
Eight of the studies were conducted in the USA; six
in New Zealand; two each in Australia, Northern Ire-
land, and England; and one in Ireland. Of the 18 with
clinical samples (3 were with staff), 11 were reasonably
gender balanced (from 43% to 57% female), two (Lips-
chitz et al. 1996; Mansfield et al. 2017) were predomi-
nantly female (71% and 72% women, respectively), and
five were 100% female (Briere & Zaidi 1989; Craine
et al. 1988; Goodwin et al. 1988; Read et al. 2006; Xiao
et al. 2016). The earliest study was in 1987 (Jacobson
et al.). Studies occurred thereafter at a rate of just
under one per year on average.

 by researchers using either structured interviews (Craine
et al. 1988; Jacobson et al. 1987) or questionnaires
(Cunningham et al. 2016; Lipschitz et al. 1996; Rossiter
et al. 2015; Shannon et al. 2011; Wurr & Partridge
1996), with the number found in the same clients’ files
(Table 1). For example, Rossiter et al. (2015) reported
on 129 clients of Irish inpatient and outpatient services.
One or more of the five types of childhood adversity
assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Bern-
stein & Fink 1998) were reported by 77% of the clients,
but their medical files produced a rate of only 38%. In
this study, rates of emotional abuse, sexual abuse,

ASKING ABOUT ABUSE AND NEGLECT
9
 physical neglect, and emotional neglect were signifi-
cantly higher (P < 0.001) when assessed by the research-
ers than in the clinical records (the difference was not
significant for physical abuse, P = 0.06). The biggest dif-
ferences
were
for
emotional
neglect
and
physical
neglect, which were 4.7 and 8.9 times, more likely to be
identified by researchers than by services, respectively.
Two early studies (Briere & Zaidi 1989; Goodwin
et al. 1988) had generated analogous data by compar-
ing the number of sexual abuse cases identified when
clinicians or researchers specifically asked about sexual
abuse, with the number of cases found in the files of a
random control group of clients from the same popula-
tion that had been assessed as per usual practice.
Combining all 23 findings from the nine studies, for
all
five
types
of
adversity
(Table 1),
produced
a
weighted average of the percentage of identified abuse
or neglect that was found in clients’ files of 27.9%
(211/755). The percentage of identified sexual abuse
found in clients’ files in nine studies ranged from 8.6%
to 50%, with a weighted average of 30.2%. The per-
centage of physical abuse found in files in five studies
ranged from 12.2% to 69.4%, with a similar weighted
average from four studies of 33.1%.
Only three studies researched neglect (physical and
emotional) and emotional abuse. Their weighted averages
were emotional abuse (44.3%, 39/88), physical neglect
(10.3%, 10/97), and emotional neglect (17.4%, 20/115).
The combined average for the two types of neglect (physi-
cal, emotional) was 14.2% (30/212), which was less than
half of the 33.3% (181/543) for the three types of active
abuse combined (physical, sexual, emotional).
A 10th study found that 87% of 142 service users
with long-term and severe mental illness had experi-
enced one or more types of childhood, adulthood, or
lifetime traumas (including 31% child sexual abuse) but
that only 28% had any trauma documented in their
files (Cusack et al. 2004). The study did not specify
how many of each type of trauma (e.g. child sexual
abuse) were documented, and was, therefore, not
included in the above analysis.
Asking service users whether they were asked
In three studies, people were directly asked whether they
had been asked about child abuse by mental health ser-
vices. A New Zealand survey of 72 people’s experiences
of their initial assessments in mental health services
(Lothian & Read 2002) found that only 15 (20.8%) had
been asked about abuse when assessed (although 65%
reported child abuse when asked by the researcher). A
survey of New Zealand women receiving therapy for sex-
ual abuse found that only 13 of the 60 (21.7%) who had
been in contact with mental health services reported that
they had ever been asked about abuse by services (Read
et al. 2006). Interviews with 89 ‘heavy users’ of psychi-
atric services in New York revealed that 30 had been sex-
ually abused and 34 physically abused as children, but
that none had ever been asked about sexual or physical
abuse by services (Rose et al. 1991).
Asking mental health staff whether they ask
In a survey of 111 mental health staff in London, UK,
only 18% said they ask about sexual abuse in men half
the time or more, and one-third reported that they
never ask (Lab et al. 2000). A sample of 85 New Zeal-
and mental health professionals who chose to attend a
training day on asking about child abuse believed, on
average, that in 64% of cases they knew whether or not
their client had been sexually abused (Cavanagh et al.
2004). Recently, only 13 of 57 Australian mental health
staff (23%) agreed with the statement ‘I routinely ask
patients
about
childhood
trauma
including
sexual
abuse’ (Mansfield et al. 2017).
Asking managers whether staff ask
Of 466 nurse managers of psychiatric inpatient units in
the USA who responded to a survey on assessment of
sexual abuse, 69% believed that assessment at admis-
sion should always include asking about sexual abuse,
but only 43% believed that their facility actually did so
(Mitchell et al. 1996).
Completion of abuse sections of assessment
forms
Three New Zealand studies measured how often, when
abuse questions are included in assessment forms, the
questions actually get asked. An inpatient study intro-
duced a new initial assessment form which included
questions about sexual, physical, and emotional abuse
(Read & Fraser 1998a). The form was used in 53 of 100
subsequent, consecutive admissions. In 36 of those 53
files (67.9%), the questions in the abuse section were not
asked. When the study was repeated in a community
mental health centre (CMHC), however, the abuse sec-
tion of the new admission form was ignored in only six of
26 cases (23.1%) (Agar et al. 2002). The most recent
New Zealand study of four CMHCs (after the introduc-
tion of computerized medical records) found that the

J. READ ET AL.
 abuse sections of 84 of 153 records (54.9%) were blank
(Sampson & Read 2017). A recent Australian study
found that newly-introduced child abuse questions were
ignored in 17 of 52 assessments (32.6%) of inpatients
and outpatients (Mansfield et al. 2017).
Prevalence of adversities recorded in files when
specific questions are asked or not asked at
initial assessment
Another less direct approach to assessing clinical prac-
tice in this area is to use the same three New Zealand
studies (Agar et al. 2002; Read & Fraser 1998a; Samp-
son & Read 2017) to examine how much additional
abuse is discovered when specific abuse questions in
assessment forms are asked at initial assessment com-
pared to when they are not asked, and disclosures are
therefore either spontaneous or result from staff asking
at some point after assessment. Six of the nine compar-
isons shown in Table 2 reveal significant differences,
confirming that many cases of abuse are unidentified in
services unless clients are asked routinely, which is not
often the case. The weighted averages for sexual abuse
for the three studies combined are 37.7% (40/106) if
asked at assessment and 13.7% (17/124) if not. For
physical abuse, the difference between the two aver-
ages is even larger at 40.6% (42/106) versus 6.3% (8/
126).
Documenting affirmative and negative child
abuse histories
Two very recent Australian studies have taken yet
another route to addressing the issue. A study of 100
files of inpatients and outpatients in Australia found
that 24 included documentation of child sexual abuse,
and a further 29 had a note that the client had been
asked and responded that they had not been abused
(Mansfield et al. 2017). The combined 53% rate of
child sexual abuse history documented might overesti-
mate the rate of enquiry by staff, however, as it could
include
spontaneous
disclosures
and
abuse
known
about from previous contact with services. A similar
study included a broad range of childhood and adult-
hood traumas (including child abuse), and found a 49%
rate of documentation of trauma history (41% yes, 8%
no) among 100 women inpatients in Australia (Xiao
et al. 2016). Despite having a different focus, the stud-
ies found similar rates of absence of any documentation
concerning asking about abuse/trauma (47% and 51%).
Is clinical practice improving over time?
In the current review, the more recent the study the
greater
the
amount
of
previously-identified
sexual
abuse found in the medical notes (r = 0.68, degrees of
freedom = 8, P < 0.05).

ASKING ABOUT ABUSE AND NEGLECT
11
 In the New Zealand study of service users’ experi-
ence of assessments (spanning many years), there was a
significant positive correlation between how recently
the assessment had occurred and the likelihood of
being asked about child abuse (Lothian & Read 2002).
Although not directly assessing how often staff actu-
ally enquire, there have been two studies assessing
whether identification of abuse increased over time in
a given setting. A 2016 audit of 250 files of all four
CMHCs in a district health board in New Zealand
(Sampson & Read 2017) was compared to a 2002 audit
of 200 files at one of those four CMHCs (Agar et al.
2002). Soon after the first study the district health
board had introduced policy guidelines that all clients
should be asked about abuse and that staff should be
trained on how to do that (Cavanagh et al. 2004; Read
et al. 2007). Identification of childhood sexual abuse
had increased from 20% to 32.4% (P < 0.01), and from
17% to 36% (P < 0.001) for childhood physical abuse.
The only other follow-up study found an increase in
the identification of lifetime physical or sexual abuse
among users of an outpatient clinic in New York City
(NY, USA) from 40% to 50.5% between 1996 and
2008, without new policies or trainings (but did not
analyse the data by specific types of abuse) (Posner
et al. 2008).
Demographic and diagnostic differences
Sex
In the early USA inpatient study, the proportion of
identified sexual abuse that had been recorded in files
was, while very low in general, slightly higher for
women (18%) than for men (0%), whereas the opposite
was the case for physical abuse (women 4%, men 18%)
(Jacobson et al. 1987).
In the New Zealand inpatient study (Read & Fraser
1998a), women were asked the abuse questions in the
new admission form more often than men (43% vs
25%), but the difference was not statistically significant
(Read & Fraser 1998a). In the second New Zealand
CMHC study, however, the difference was significant
(women 54%, men 37%) (Sampson & Read 2017). In a
recent Australian study, the introduction of abuse ques-
tions increased the proportion of women for whom
there was some file documentation about child sexual
abuse (affirmative or negative) to 73%, but only to 53%
for men (Mansfield et al. 2017).
In a survey of New Zealand psychiatrists and psy-
chologists, 25% said they were less likely to ask about
sexual abuse if the client was male (Cavanagh et al.
2004). The London survey found that 82% of staff ask
men about sexual abuse less than half the time, and
one-third never ask (Lab et al. 2000).
Unfortunately,
it
seems
possible
that
disclosure
about child sexual abuse might be even more depen-
dent on being asked for men than for women. In the
New Zealand inpatient study, the difference in rates of
sexual abuse when asked and not asked was significant
for men (62% vs 4%) but not for women (33% vs 8%)
(Read & Fraser 1998a).
Age
The New Zealand study of women in therapy for sexual
abuse found that older women were significantly less
likely to have been asked about abuse by mental health
services (Read et al. 2006). However, in the second
New Zealand CMHC study the clients’ age was unre-
lated to whether childhood abuse and neglect were
reported (Sampson & Read 2017).
Ethnicity
The only study to have analysed its findings in terms of
ethnicity found that whether clients were Maori or
European was unrelated to the probability of abuse or
neglect being found in their files (Sampson & Read
2017).
Income
The New Zealand study of women in therapy found
that higher income was significantly related to the
probability of being asked about abuse by mental
health services (Read et al. 2006).
Diagnosis
In the New Zealand inpatient study, people diagnosed
with schizophrenia were slightly less likely (23%) to be
asked the abuse questions than people with other diag-
noses (39%), but the difference was not significant
(Read & Fraser 1998a). In the second New Zealand
CMHC study (Sampson & Read 2017), people diag-
nosed with psychotic disorders were significantly less
likely than other people to have abuse/neglect recorded
in their initial assessments. Three diagnostic groups
had high rates of the abuse section of the admission
form left blank (psychosis, 64%; bipolar disorder, 72%;
and drug/alcohol abuse, 71%) compared, for example,
to 18% for PTSD.
In the New Zealand survey of psychologists and psy-
chiatrists 41% reported they were more likely to ask
about sexual abuse if the diagnosis was depression, bor-
derline personality disorder, or PTSD (Cavanagh et al.
© 2017 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.
12
J. READ ET AL.
 2004). If the diagnosis was schizophrenia, however,
none were more likely to ask, and a few (4%) were less
likely to ask. The survey of London professionals found
that one of the two most common reasons for not ask-
ing about sexual abuse was ‘presenting problem was
“irrelevant to sexual abuse” for example simple phobia
or psychosis’ (Lab et al. 2000, p. 396).
A trauma initiative that had increased the detection of
trauma in other psychiatric services failed to do so for a
service for people with serious mental illness who were
predominantly African American (Cusack et al. 2004).
Sex of professional
In the first New Zealand CMHC study (Agar et al.
2002), the new admission form containing abuse ques-
tions was used by 26% of female staff, but only by 3%
of male staff. In the subsequent New Zealand CMHC
study (Sampson & Read 2017), female clinicians were
significantly more likely than their male counterparts to
record at least one type of abuse or neglect (52% vs
36%) and male staff were significantly more likely to
leave the abuse/neglect section blank (69% vs 46%). If
both clinician and client were female, at least one type
of abuse or neglect was recorded 63% of the time,
compared to 26% if both were male. These findings
are consistent with a US finding that female mental
health clinicians are more likely to identify sexual
assaults in adulthood (Currier & Briere 2000).
Profession
In the survey of 111 London mental health staff, 50% of
psychologists said they never asked men about sexual
abuse histories, compared to 25% of nurses and 16% of
psychiatrists (Lab et al. 2000). More nurses (29%) than
psychiatrists (4%) or psychologists (7%) believed that
men should always be asked about sexual abuse.
In the first New Zealand outpatient study, which mea-
sured actual behaviour rather than self-reports, the new
form with abuse questions was used by 1% of psychia-
trists and 31% of other professions (Read & Fraser
1998a). In the second New Zealand CMHC study, how-
ever, profession was unrelated to whether child abuse
and neglect were reported (Sampson & Read 2017).
DISCUSSION
Failure to enquire about abuse and neglect
Nine studies revealed that less than one-third (28%) of
abuse and neglect identified by researchers had been
documented in clients’ files, let alone responded to
therapeutically. This figure falls to particularly alarming
levels for emotional neglect (17%) and physical neglect
(10%). Three studies confirmed this failure in clinical
care, with findings that the percentage of mental health
service users who report being asked about child abuse
ranges from 0% to 21%. The three surveys of profession-
als, and the one of managers, produce somewhat higher
rates, which could be in part result from social desirability
bias. Even ignoring that possibility, these studies confirm
that routine enquiry is very far from the norm.
At a point in history when child abuse is widely
acknowledged, internationally, to be prevalent and
damaging, and when church, educational, sporting, and
governmental organizations are being investigated for
institutional collusion, one wonders whether ‘collusion’
is too strong a word to, apply to psychiatric services as
well. This review makes it clear that historical abuse
and neglect are being systematically ignored even by
services that are specifically intended to provide sup-
port and healing for people in emotional distress.
Paucity of studies
Another major finding of this review is the paucity of
studies
about
whether
mental
health
services
are
responding responsibly to the fact that childhood adversi-
ties play a causal role in most mental health problems.
Prior to 1987, there were no studies meeting our fairly
broad inclusion criteria, and there have been only 21 in
the subsequent 30 years. It remains to be seen whether
the cluster of five studies in 2015 and 2016 (Cunningham
et al. 2016; Mansfield et al. 2017; Rossiter et al. 2015;
Sampson & Read 2017; Xiao et al. 2016) represents a
belated and overdue acceleration of research interest.
Enquiry about neglect and emotional abuse is even more
underresearched than enquiry about physical and sexual
abuse (possibly partly because there is less consensus
about definitions of neglect and emotional abuse).
This failure of our research community to show suffi-
cient interest in the self-evidently crucial issue of how
abused people are treated by mental health services is
troubling, and suggests that the biogenetic model that
often pays little heed to psychosocial factors (Bentall
2003; Read & Dillon 2013) not only dominates services
but also seems to pervade our research efforts (Bentall &
Varese 2012).
Barriers to asking

ASKING ABOUT ABUSE AND NEGLECT
13
 barriers to asking. Therefore, identifying these barriers
would be a worthwhile research endeavour; however,
there is only a very small amount of literature available.
Four staff surveys – two in New Zealand (Cavanagh
et al. 2004; Young et al. 2001) and one each in Aus-
tralia (Mansfield et al. 2017) and England (Lab et al.
2000) – identified fairly consistent reasons for not ask-
ing: (i) feeling there are more immediate concerns to
deal with; (ii) fear that clients might find being asked
very distressing and could make their problems worse
(the ‘can of worms’ argument); (iii) worry that enquiry
could be suggestive (and thereby lead to ‘false memo-
ries’); (iv) belief that it is inappropriate to ask clients
with problems that the clinician believes are irrelevant
to sexual abuse (e.g. psychosis); (v) not knowing how,
or not having resources, to respond well to disclosures;
(vi) belief that disclosures by ‘mental patients’ might be
false, imagined, or delusional.
Furthermore, one study found a negative relation-
ship between biogenetic causal beliefs and the self-
reported probability of asking about child abuse (Young
et al. 2001). Very few participants in these studies
identified their own emotional discomfort or potential
vicarious traumatization.
Limitations and future research
The fundamental limitations of this review are the
small number of studies and the small sample sizes.
That the majority of studies occurred in just two coun-
tries is a further limitation. The heterogeneity of the
methodologies of the studies significantly limits our
ability to estimate precisely how much abuse and
neglect is missed by services. The same heterogeneity,
however, can be seen as a strength, given that all stud-
ies found inadequate clinical practice, regardless of
methodology, and moreover, regardless of location or
time. All aspects of this sparse literature warrant atten-
tion from researchers, using larger samples. Priority
should be given to identifying the facilitators of sus-
tained systemic change. Evidenced models of trauma-
informed care should be developed, in cooperation
with service users and their families, along with multi-
level ways to measure the extent to which each service
is implementing effective trauma-informed policies.
CONCLUSION
The review found some evidence that clinical practice
might have been improving gradually over the three
decades spanned by the studies reviewed. However,
even the most encouraging finding in relation to sexual
abuse showed that, in 2016, mental health services are
still missing half of the cases identified by researchers
(Cunningham et al. 2016). We next identify the various
pathways to the urgently-needed further improvement.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Interventions to improve enquiry rates
The potential mechanisms for improving clinical prac-
tice in this domain range from trauma-specific assess-
ment forms, policies, and guidelines, and training
programmes, to, on a more systemic level, trauma-
informed mental health services, and a shift of overall
paradigm.
Assessment forms
Our review found (from just 3 studies) that when
specific abuse questions are asked at assessment, the
amount of abuse identified is far higher than when
relying on subsequent enquiry or spontaneous disclo-
sure. Therefore, introducing assessment forms or pro-
cedures that include such questions is recommended.
We also discovered, however, that forms are not always
used (Read & Fraser 1998a), and even when they are
used, the abuse questions are often ignored (Agar et al.
2002; Read & Fraser 1998a; Sampson & Read 2017). It
seems, therefore, that forms alone do not change
behaviour.
Policies and guidelines
Policies or guidelines about the need for routine
enquiry, at local or national level, or by professional
organizations, are also important. These policies and
guidelines should stress that all service users should be
asked about both abuse and neglect, regardless of diag-
nosis, sex, or age. However, without training, monitor-
ing, follow up, and commitment from all professions
and
managers,
policies
and
guidelines
will
be
insufficient.
By 2003 the British Government had recognized
that ‘awareness about the nature and extent of domes-
tic violence and child sexual abuse and its effects
appears to be low generally amongst mental health pro-
fessionals’, and recommended that ‘staff raise issues of
violence and abuse routinely and consistently in assess-
ment and care planning’ (Department of Health, 2003,
p. 7). It soon became apparent that the policy was
being ignored, and that a major initiative, including
training, was required (Department of Health 2015). In

J. READ ET AL.
 2008, the National Health Service (NHS) reiterated
the policy that everyone receiving mental health ser-
vices should be routinely asked about sexual abuse/as-
sault, and that a question on sexual abuse/assault be
included in the care programme approach (Depart-
ment of Health 2008; National Health Service 2008).
Seven years later, the 53 mental health trusts were
asked, via the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act,
whether
they
audited
this
activity
(Brooker
et al.
2016a,b). Of the 36 that replied, only five (14%, or 9%
of all trusts) stated that they did audit. The researchers
also ascertained that 57% of mental health providers
failed to give the Health and Social Care Information
Centre (HSCIC) any data about whether mental health
service users are asked about violence and abuse,
despite this being expected as part of the Mental
Health and Learning Disabilities Data Set. Overall, the
HSCIC could ascertain whether or not abuse was
being asked about for only 17% of clients. An FOI
enquiry to the Department of Health asking whether
the 2008 policy was still policy in operation referred
the enquirers to NHS England. The response from
NHS England, however, referred the enquirers back to
the Department of Health (Brooker et al. 2016a,b).
There is a need for greater governance of routine
enquiry and clearer leadership from bodies, including
governmental and professional organizations, that can
influence service providers.
Training
Previous training is a predictor of self-reported proba-
bility of abuse enquiry (Young et al. 2001) and actual
enquiry (Currier et al. 1996). Training needs to stress
that people, including mental health service users,
rarely spontaneously disclose child abuse (Eilenberg
et al. 1996; Read et al. 2006) and that it is, therefore,
incumbent on mental health staff to actively ask all cli-
ents, regardless of sex, age, or diagnosis.
Training programmes should directly address the
barriers to asking listed earlier. For example, it is
essential to counter any victim-blaming beliefs about
users of mental health services not being believable
when they say they were abused, using the research
demonstrating that abuse disclosures by service users,
including those diagnosed with schizophrenia, are reli-
able (Darves-Bornoz et al. 1995; Fisher et al. 2011).
Besides dealing with when and how to ask, training
programmes must teach how to respond to disclosures
respectfully and therapeutically (Cavanagh et al., Read
et al. 2007). Responses to disclosures are often inade-
quate
(Agar
&
Read
2002;
Ashmore
et al.
2015;
Eilenberg et al. 1996; Posner et al. 2008; Read et al.
2007; Read & Fraser 1998b; Read et al. 2016). The
NHS initiative identified not knowing how to respond
as the most important barrier to asking (Department of
Health 2015). Training programmes (and policies and
guidelines) will need to address the implications of
mandatory reporting laws in their locality (Davies et al.
2014; Mathews 2012).
An example of a programme aiming to address most
of
the
issues
and
barriers
identified
earlier
was
designed in New Zealand after the Auckland District
Health Board introduced a policy in 2000 (similar to
the 2008 NHS policy) ‘to ensure that routine mental
health assessments include appropriate questions about
sexual abuse/trauma, and that discourse is sensitively
managed’ (Cavanagh et al. 2004, p. 2). The one day
programme devotes the morning to asking and the
afternoon to responding, with both sessions involving
didactic learning and role plays (Cavanagh et al. 2004;
Read et al. 2007). An evaluation produced positive
findings in terms of user satisfaction and changes in
attitudes and clinical practice (Cavanagh et al. 2004).
Significant increases in the amount of child abuse
recorded in files before and after the training was
introduced were reported, but it is unclear how much
of that improvement was due to the training (Sampson
& Read 2017). The training programme has been
translated and successfully adapted for use with Ger-
man substance use health-care professionals (Lotzin
et al. 2017).
Another one day training programme was delivered
in eight trusts in England as part of the NHS policy
initiative (Department of Health 2008, 2015; Donohoe
2010; McNeish & Scott 2008). Its goals were ‘to
address staff fears in working with survivors/victims of
violence and abuse, particularly child sexual abuse’ and
‘to equip staff to routinely and consistently explore vio-
lence and abuse in assessments and respond appropri-
ately to disclosures’ (McNeish & Scott 2008, p. 7). An
evaluation found that 86% (of the 33% recipients who
completed the survey) felt confident to carry out rou-
tine enquiry. Half of those conducting assessments in
the trusts said they ‘always’ asked about violence and
abuse, with a further 35% saying ‘mostly’. The only
trust (Devon) to provide evidence from an actual audit,
before training had been provided to all staff, reported
that abuse had been asked about in 1819 of 4018
(45%) of assessments (McNeish & Scott 2008).
The New Zealand and UK training programmes are
quite similar, including teaching that all clients should
be asked and having a strong focus on how to respond

ASKING ABOUT ABUSE AND NEGLECT
15
 as well as how to ask. They differ, however, in the rec-
ommended wording of the actual questions. The UK
programme teaches staff to ask ‘Have you experienced
physical, sexual or emotional abuse?’, whereas the New
Zealand approach is to ask about specific types of
events (e.g. ‘Did an adult ever hurt or punish you in a
way that left bruises, cuts or scratches?’ and ‘When you
were a child, did anyone ever do something sexual that
made you feel uncomfortable?’) (Cavanagh et al. 2004;
Read et al. 2007). This is because many abuse survivors
have not labelled their abuse as abuse, and because
research shows that framing questions in terms of
‘abuse’ reveals only approximately half of the abuse
identified by questions about specific events or beha-
viours (Dill et al. 1991; Read et al. 2007).
Training can be tailored to fit specific contexts. For
example, a programme was recently designed especially
for an early intervention in psychosis service in the UK
(Walters et al. 2015). The most rigorously-researched
training programme to date was in Germany for staff
working in substance use services. Trauma-enquiry
behaviour significantly increased for the staff who were
trained, 3 and 6 months after the training, but did not
change in the control group (Lotzin et al. in press).
Even short interventions can be useful. US mental
health staff who received just a one hour lecture on
abuse prevalence, impacts, and issues around sensitive
assessment, identified significantly more sexual and
physical violence than those who did not receive the
lecture (Currier & Briere 2000).
Trauma-informed services
Polices should be designed not only to mandate train-
ing but to create a positive, trauma-focussed culture
for the service as a whole (Bateman et al. 2013; Broo-
ker et al. 2016a,b; Department of Health 2008; Mus-
kett
2014;
Substance
Abuse
and
Mental
Health
Services Administration 2014; Sweeney et al. 2016;
Toner et al. 2013). Without such a culture, any specific
gains from forms, policies, and trainings could be short
lived. The idea is that all staff engage with people in
such a way that facilitates recovery from any trauma or
adversity that has led to the problems that they present
with, that acknowledges that different traumas and
adversities might require different responses, and that,
at the very least, avoids retraumatizing through prac-
tices that either reproduce the trauma with the use of
force or that dismiss the occurrence or impact of
abuse. Whether such changes are a prerequisite for, or
dependent
on,
a
fundamental
paradigm
shift
in
research and services is debatable (Bentall 2003; Boyle
2013; Read & Dillon 2013; Read et al. 2014).
Service user perspectives
Users of mental health services have written and spoken
extensively about the role of childhood maltreatment in
the development of their difficulties, and about the fre-
quent failure of mental health services to respond help-
fully, or to even ask (Daya 2015; Dillon 2010; Longden
2013; Romme et al. 2009; Sen 2017). Family members
have also spoken out. For example, the need for trauma-
informed care is heard in an impassioned plea, over
20 years ago now, entitled ‘On being invisible in the men-
tal health system’, from a mother of an abused daughter
who eventually killed herself (Jennings 1994).
Training programmes should present the research
showing that most service users are not distressed by
being asked about violence and abuse (Cunningham
et al. 2017; Department of Health 2015; Lothian &
Read 2002; Scott et al. 2015). Indeed, some are dis-
tressed by not being asked. In the process of designing
the New Zealand training programme, 72 long-term
users of mental health services were asked what they
thought about asking everyone about child abuse (Loth-
ian & Read 2002). Some of their responses were subse-
quently used in the training, and remain relevant
15 years later:
There was an assumption that I had a mental illness,
and because I wasn’t saying anything about my abuse,
nobody knew.
There was so many doctors and nurses and social work-
ers in your life asking you about the same thing, men-
tal, mental, mental, but not asking you why.
I just wish they would have said ‘What happened to
you?’ ‘What happened?’ but they didn’t.
