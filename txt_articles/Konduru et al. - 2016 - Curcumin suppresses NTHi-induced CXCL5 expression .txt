Curcumin suppresses NTHi-induced 
CXCL5 expression via inhibition 
of positive IKKβ pathway and 
up-regulation of negative MKP-1 
pathway
Anuhya S. Konduru, Byung-Cheol Lee & Jian-Dong Li
Otitis media (OM) is the most common childhood bacterial infection, and leading cause of conductive 
hearing loss. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major bacterial pathogen for OM. 
OM characterized by the presence of overactive inflammatory responses is due to the aberrant 
production of inflammatory mediators including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5). The 
molecular mechanism underlying induction of CXCL5 by NTHi is unknown. Here we show that 
NTHi up-regulates CXCL5 expression by activating IKKβ-IκBα and p38 MAPK pathways via NF-κB 
nuclear translocation-dependent and -independent mechanism in middle ear epithelial cells. Current 
therapies for OM are ineffective due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant NTHi strains and risk of 
side effects with prolonged use of immunosuppressant drugs. In this study, we show that curcumin, 
derived from Curcuma longa plant, long known for its medicinal properties, inhibited NTHi-induced 
CXCL5 expression in vitro and in vivo. Curcumin suppressed CXCL5 expression by direct inhibition of 
IKKβ phosphorylation, and inhibition of p38 MAPK via induction of negative regulator MKP-1. Thus, 
identification of curcumin as a potential therapeutic for treating OM is of particular translational 
significance due to the attractiveness of targeting overactive inflammation without significant 
adverse effects.
Otitis media (OM) is the most common childhood bacterial infection1 with 700 million occurrences globally each 
year2. OM frequently leads to conductive hearing loss, affecting children during the crucial period of speech and 
language development3. The gram-negative bacillus Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) represents the 
cause of approximately one-third episodes of OM. Current treatments for OM rely on the systemic use of antibi-
otics, which has led to the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains4,5. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
for developing alternate therapeutic strategies for treating OM.
OM is characterized by the presence of excess inflammation in the middle ear1. During infection, epithelial 
cells act as the first line of defense by secreting numerous pro-inflammatory mediators including chemokines. 
 
Chemokines mainly act by recruiting neutrophils to the site of infection. While the appropriate neutrophil 
response is critical for the removal of the invading pathogen, excess inflammation can lead to tissue damage and 
perpetuate inflammation leading to detrimental effects, as seen across several inflammatory pathologies includ-
ing OM6–9. Thus, tight regulation of inflammation is necessary.
CXCL5/ENA-78 (epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78) of the Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif-containing 
C-X-C chemokine family is critical for recruiting neutrophils in response to bacterial infections10. Epithelial-cell 
derived CXCL5 is vital in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)-driven destructive inflammatory responses in 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis-induced pulmonary tuberculosis. Cxcl5−/− mice were found to be resistant to fatal 
tuberculosis11. The role of CXCL5 in neutrophil trafficking in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation 
 
in mice has been reported12. A recent study demonstrated that LPS-induced deregulated CXCL5 expression 
resulted in exaggerated neutrophil-mediated inflammation in pulmonary bronchiolar cells13. CXCL5 is also

involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis14, with CXCL5 overexpression leading to poor survival in 
cancer patients15. Affymetrix chip analysis on mouse genome revealed marked up-regulation of CXCL5 expres-
sion by NTHi in the middle ear of mouse16. Middle ear effusion samples from patients with acute and chronic OM 
have shown the presence of viable NTHi trapped within neutrophil extracellular traps, which continued to elicit 
inflammatory responses17,18. Thus, these findings suggest that therapeutic strategies to control aberrant CXCL5 
production are of utmost importance for modulating inflammation.
Current anti-inflammatory therapies act via suppressing the positive signaling pathways involved in the 
production of inflammatory mediators. However, prolonged use of these drugs could have severe side effects 
because these pathways are also involved in mediating physiological responses. Therefore, therapeutic strategies 
that increase the levels of endogenous negative regulators of inflammation while leaving the positive pathways 
intact are gaining prominence19. Despite the importance of CXCL5 in mediating inflammation, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of CXCL5 production in OM remains largely unknown. Therefore, 
understanding the mechanism of NTHi-induced CXCL5 regulation in OM will help develop new therapies.
Curcumin, a yellow pigment, common spice derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa plant was long-used 
for its medicinal properties20. Curcumin has been widely reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, 
anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic anti-tumorigenic, anti-amyloidogenic effects. Due to its tolera-
bility and non-toxicity at high doses, curcumin could be used for prolonged periods without any side effects20. 
Completed clinical trials revealed promising therapeutic effects of curcumin in patients with cancer, inflamma-
tory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and diabetes21–27. More clini-
cal trials evaluating the efficacy of curcumin on a broad range of inflammatory conditions are currently underway. 
Despite its widely known potent anti-inflammatory properties, the effect of curcumin on NTHi-induced inflam-
matory responses, especially CXCL5 expression remains to be evaluated.
In the present study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of NTHi-induced CXCL5 expres-
sion. We show that NTHi up-regulates CXCL5 expression by activating IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα 
 and p38 MAPK pathways. 
Interestingly both pathways mediated CXCL5 expression in an NF-κ 
B-nuclear translocation-dependent and 
-independent manner, respectively. Also, we show that curcumin suppresses NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression in 
middle ear epithelial cells. Curcumin suppressed CXCL5 expression by direct inhibition of IKKβ 
 phosphorylation 
and inhibition of p38 MAPK via induction of negative regulator MKP-1. Thus, our study provides novel insights 
into the regulation of CXCL5 chemokine and identifies curcumin as a potential therapeutic for treating OM.
Results
NTHi induces CXCL5 expression in middle ear epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. 
Epithelial cells 
act as the first line of defense against injurious stimuli by mediating inflammatory responses. We sought to deter-
mine if NTHi induces CXCL5 expression in human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEECs). NTHi induced CXCL5 
mRNA expression in a dose- (Fig. 1a) and time-dependent (Fig. 1b) manner in HMEECs. NTHi induced up-reg-
ulation of CXCL5 protein expression in HMEECs as quantified by ELISA (Fig. 1c). Effect of NTHi on CXCL5 
expression was also confirmed in human airway epithelial BEAS-2B cells, human lung epithelial A549 cells and 
human cervical epithelial HeLa cells, suggesting the generalizability of this phenomenon to multiple epithelial 
cells (Fig. 1d). We further explored the generalizability of NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression by employing two 
additional commonly used clinical NTHi strains 2627 and 9274 known to cause OM28,29. NTHi strains 2627 and 
9274 also induced CXCL5 mRNA expression at levels comparable to that of NTHi strain 12 (used throughout the 
study) in HMEECs (Fig. 1e). Consistent with the in vitro findings, NTHi also induced up-regulation of CXCL5 
mRNA in mouse middle ear (Fig. 1f).
TLR2-MyD88-TRAF6-TAK1 signaling axis is required for NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression. 
 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are cell surface receptors that play a critical role in mounting early innate immune 
responses against invading pathogens. TLRs recognize conserved motifs known as pathogen-associated microbial 
patterns (PAMPs), expressed on microbial pathogens and initiate signaling cascades leading to the production 
of pro-inflammatory mediators. To date, at least 11 human TLRs have been identified. Among them, TLR2 is 
known to recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria. Based on our previous 
finding that TLR2 mediated NTHi-induced pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, we sought to determine its role 
in CXCL5 chemokine production. HMEECs were transfected with TLR dominant-negative mutants TLR2-DN 
and TLR4-DN. Overexpression of TLR2-DN significantly decreased NTHi-induced CXCL5 mRNA expression, 
whereas TLR4-DN had no significant effect on CXCL5 expression (Fig. 2a). Next, we sought to determine the sig-
naling molecules downstream of TLR2, involved in mediating CXCL5 expression. Following recognition of NTHi 
by TLR2, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein is recruited to the receptor. MyD88 then 
recruits and activates IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs), which further lead to the recruitment and acti-
vation of tumor-necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). IRAK-TRAF6 complex dissociates from 
the receptor bound complex and further interacts with transforming growth factor-β 
- activated kinase 1 (TAK1). 
Activation of TAK1 leads to initiation of further downstream signaling pathways, resulting in nuclear transloca-
tion of transcription factors, and in turn regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. To determine 
the involvement of MyD88 and TRAF6 in CXCL5 expression, HMEECs were transfected with dominant-negative 
mutants MyD88-DN and TRAF6-DN. Overexpression of MyD88-DN and TRAF6-DN significantly suppressed 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 2b). Depletion of endogenous TAK1 with TAK1 siRNA also decreased 
CXCL5 mRNA expression (Fig. 2c). TAK1 siRNA knockdown efficiency was confirmed by Q-PCR. Therefore, 
these results suggest that TLR2-MyD88-TRAF6-TAK1 signaling axis is required for NTHi-induced CXCL5 
expression.

Activation of IKKβ-IκBα signaling pathway is required for NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression. 
 
Previous studies have shown that IKKβ 
 signaling axis is crucial for NTHi-induced inflammatory responses30. 
Therefore, we examined the role of IKKβ 
 in up-regulation of CXCL5. We first confirmed that NTHi activates 
IKKβ 
 in HMEECs. IKKα 
/β 
 phosphorylation was observed at 15 minutes, followed by a peak at 30 minutes, 
and declined after that (Fig. 3a). To determine if IKKβ 
 is required for NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression, we 
used multiple approaches. IKKβ 
 inhibitor significantly suppressed NTHi-induced CXCL5 mRNA expres-
sion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). To identify the major IKK isoform involved in NTHi-induced 
CXCL5 regulation, HMEECs were transfected with IKK dominant-negative (DN) mutants IKKα 
-DN and 
IKKβ 
-DN. Overexpression of IKKβ 
-DN significantly decreased NTHi-induced CXCL5 mRNA expression, 
Figure 1. NTHi up-regulates CXCL5 expression in middle ear epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. (a) HMEECs 
were stimulated with NTHi (MOI of 25, 50 or 250) for 5 h, and CXCL5 mRNA expression was measured by Q-PCR. 
(b) HMEECs were stimulated with NTHi (MOI of 50) for 1, 3 or 5 h, and CXCL5 mRNA expression was measured 
by Q-PCR. (c) HMEECs were stimulated with NTHi for 12 h, and CXCL5 protein levels in cell culture supernatants

whereas IKKα 
-DN had no significant effect (Fig. 3c). Consistent with this result, depletion of endogenous IKKβ 
with IKKβ 
 siRNA also decreased CXCL5 mRNA expression (Fig. 3d). IKKβ 
 siRNA knockdown efficiency was 
confirmed by Western blot. To further confirm that activated IKKβ 
 induces CXCL5 expression, HMEECs were 
transfected with constitutively active (CA) form IKKβ 
-CA. Overexpression of IKKβ 
-CA markedly induced 
CXCL5 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3e). Phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of Iκ 
Bα 
, by IKKβ 
, are required for signal31. Overexpression of a trans-dominant mutant form of Iκ 
Bα 
 (Iκ 
Bα 
-DN) 
suppressed NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 3f). To further confirm that Iκ 
Bα 
 degradation is essential for 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 up-regulation, we used MG-132 proteasome inhibitor. MG-132 significantly suppressed 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3g). Thus, these results suggest that 
IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα signaling pathway is required for CXCL5 induction by NTHi.
Activation of p38 signaling is required for NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression. 
NTHi has been 
shown to mediate inflammatory responses via activation of p38 MAPK signaling axis in addition to activation 
of IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα pathway31. Therefore, we examined the role of p38 in up-regulation of CXCL5. We first confirmed 
that NTHi activates p38 MAPK in HMEECs. p38 phosphorylation was observed at 15 minutes, followed by 
a peak at 30 minutes, and declined after that (Fig. 3h). To determine if p38 MAPK activation is essential for 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression, multiple approaches were used. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 activa-
tion, significantly suppressed NTHi-induced CXCL5 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3i). 
To identify the major p38 isoform involved in NTHi-induced CXCL5 regulation, HMEECs were transfected with 
p38 DN mutants p38α 
-DN and p38β 
-DN. Over-expression of either or both p38α 
, p38β 
 DN forms significantly 
decreased NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 3j), consistent with SB203580 data. Together, these data suggest 
that p38 pathway is required for induction of CXCL5.
IKKβ-IκBα and p38 signaling axes mediate CXCL5 induction via p65 nuclear translocation- 
dependent and -independent mechanism, respectively. 
Next, we sought to determine how 
IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα 
 and p38 signaling pathways induce CXCL5 expression. Co-treatment with IKKβ 
 inhibitor and 
SB203580 synergistically suppressed CXCL5 expression at mRNA (Fig. 4a) and protein (Fig. 4b) levels. As 
NF-κ 
B is a known major transcription factor for pro-inflammatory mediators32, we investigated its involvement 
in NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression. Nuclear translocation of NF-κ 
B is critical for its activity32. NTHi induces

nuclear translocation of p65, the major subunit of NF-κ 
B complex31. To determine that p65 nuclear translocation 
and activation is required for NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression, we used multiple approaches. Pretreatment with 
caffeic acid phenyl ester (CAPE), a specific inhibitor of NF-κ 
B nuclear translocation (independent of Iκ 
Bα 
 deg-
radation), completely abrogated NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 4c). Pretreatment with CAPE markedly 
diminished NTHi-induced NF-κ 
B promoter-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 4d). Depletion of endogenous p65, 
with p65 siRNA, decreased CXCL5 mRNA expression (Fig. 4e). p65 siRNA knockdown efficiency was confirmed 
by Western blot. Overexpression of p65 further enhanced NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 4f). Therefore, 
these results suggest that NTHi induces CXCL5 transcription via activation of NF-κ 
B, specifically by p65 subunit.
To determine whether p38 MAPK induces CXCL5 expression via p65, HMEECs transfected with p65 
were pre-treated with SB203580, prior to NTHi stimulation. SB203580 decreased CXCL5 expression in 
p65-transfected cells (Fig. 4g). We further confirmed the requirement of p38 for NF-κ 
B activation by multiple 
approaches. Pre-treatment with SB203580 markedly decreased NTHi-induced NF-κ 
B promoter-driven lucif-
erase activity (Fig. 4h). Consistent with this result, over-expression of either or both p38α 
 and p38β 
 DN forms 
decreased NTHi-induced NF-κ 
B promoter activity (Fig. 4i). These results suggest that p38 MAPK also mediates 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression in a p65 dependent mechanism.
Since nuclear translocation of p65 is imperative for NF-κ 
B-driven gene expression32, we determined if p38 
up-regulates CXCL5 expression via facilitating nuclear translocation of p65 by immunofluorescence staining. 
CAPE markedly inhibited nuclear translocation of p65, whereas SB203580 did not show any significant effect 
(Fig. 4j). Taken together these results suggest that p38 mediates CXCL5 expression via a mechanism independent 
of the nuclear translocation of p65. Therefore, these results suggest that IKKβ 
 and p38 signaling pathways mediate 
 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 up-regulation via activation of p65 in a p65-nuclear translocation-dependent and 
-independent mechanism, respectively.
Curcumin suppresses NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression in vitro and in vivo. 
Having identified 
the molecular mechanisms underlying NTHi-induced up-regulation of CXCL5, we next sought to explore the 
translational significance of these findings. Because curcumin, a promising anti-inflammatory agent, has previ-
ously been shown to inhibit NF-κ 
B33,34, we first determined if curcumin inhibits NTHi-induced up-regulation 
of CXCL5. Curcumin pre-treatment inhibited CXCL5 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5a). 
Curcumin’s inhibitory effect on CXCL5 protein levels was also confirmed (Fig. 5b). Additionally, the inhibitory 
effect of curcumin on CXCL5 mRNA expression was also observed in HMEECs stimulated with other common 
clinical NTHi strains 2627 and 9274 (Fig. 5c), thereby suggesting the generalizability to more OM-causing NTHi 
strains. Consistent with in vitro findings, curcumin pre-treatment inhibited CXCL5 mRNA expression in the 
middle ear of mice inoculated with NTHi (Fig. 5d). These data suggest that curcumin inhibits NTHi-induced 
CXCL5 expression in middle ear epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.
Next, we sought to determine the therapeutic relevance of the inhibitory effect of curcumin in NTHi-induced 
OM model. Thus, we evaluated the effect of administering curcumin post-NTHi infection that resembles a clin-
ically relevant setting. Administering curcumin post-NTHi infection significantly suppressed NTHi-induced 
CXCL5 mRNA expression in vitro (Fig. 5e) and in vivo (Fig. 5f). Curcumin suppressed CXCL5 expression to the 
same extent under both pre-NTHi and post-NTHi infection conditions. Since CXCL5 is a neutrophil chemoat-
tractant, we further evaluated the effect of curcumin on PMN recruitment in response to NTHi infection in a 
mouse model of OM. Consistent with the above results curcumin (pre-NTHi and post-NTHi infection) inhibited 
PMN infiltration as assessed by PMN staining of middle ear effusion from mice (Fig. 5g). Thus, these data suggest 
that curcumin is a potential therapeutic for treating NTHi-induced inflammation as seen in OM.
Curcumin suppresses NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression via inhibition of IKKβ and p38 pathways. 
 
Next, we sought to determine the mechanism by which curcumin inhibits CXCL5 expression. Since activation 
of IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα 
 and p38 signaling pathways has been shown to be involved in NTHi-induced CXCL5 expres-
sion, we assessed the effect of curcumin on these pathways. Curcumin abrogated NTHi-induced IKKα 
/β  
phosphorylation (Fig. 6a). Moreover, curcumin inhibited IKKβ 
-CA-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 6b). 
Curcumin reduced NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6c). We also confirmed the inhibitory effect of cur-
cumin on NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 6d). Next, we determined 
the effect of curcumin on p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κ 
B-driven luciferase promoter activity. Consistent 
with the above findings, curcumin suppressed NTHi-induced p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6e) and NF-κ 
B 
luciferase activity (Fig. 6f). Thus, these data suggest that curcumin inhibits NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression via 
inhibition of both IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα 
 and p38 signaling pathways.
Curcumin suppresses CXCL5 expression via up-regulation of negative regulator MKP-1. 
MKP-
1, a member of a class of dual specificity phosphatases collectively termed MAPK phosphatases, has been shown 
to be a key negative regulator of inflammatory responses via dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAPKs, 
including p3835,36. Since we identified the requirement of p38 MAPK activation in NTHi-induced CXCL5 
expression, we determined the role of MKP-1 in CXCL5 regulation. Overexpression of MKP-1 suppressed 
NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression (Fig. 7a). Depletion of endogenous MKP-1 with MKP-1 shRNA enhanced 
CXCL5 mRNA expression (Fig. 7b). MKP-1 shRNA knockdown efficiency was confirmed by Q-PCR. These data 
suggest that MKP-1 is a negative regulator of NTHi-induced CXCL5 induction.
To further determine if MKP-1 acts as a negative regulator of CXCL5 induction via inactivation of p38, we 
evaluated the effect of MKP-1 on p38 phosphorylation. Overexpression of MKP-1 reduced NTHi-induced p38 
phosphorylation (Fig. 7c). In contrast, depletion of MKP-1 enhanced p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 7d). These data 
suggest that MKP-1 negatively regulates NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression by targeting p38 MAPK.

(Fig. 7e) and protein (Fig. 7f) levels. These data suggest the curcumin increases NTHi-induced expression of 
negative regulator MKP-1.
Having shown that curcumin inhibits NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression via inhibition of p38 and up-regulation of 
MKP-1 expression, we sought to determine if the inhibitory effect of curcumin on p38 is dependent on the up-regulation 
of MKP-1. Depletion of MKP-1 with shMKP-1 rendered curcumin treatment ineffective in inhibiting NTHi-induced 
CXCL5 expression (Fig. 7g). Additionally, curcumin no longer suppressed NTHi-induced p38 phosphorylation 
 
in the absence of MKP-1 (Fig. 7h). These data suggest that curcumin inhibits NTHi-induced activation 
 
of p38 via up-regulating MKP-1. Thus, our results suggest that curcumin inhibits NTHi-induced CXCL5 
 
expression via MKP-1-dependent inhibition of p38 MAPK.
Discussion
Inflammatory responses are essential for the containment, removal of the invading pathogens and recovery of 
the host. However, excess inflammation can be detrimental to the host as seen in OM6–9,37,38. Therefore, tight

regulation of the intensity and duration of inflammatory responses is necessary. In the present study, we show that 
curcumin inhibits CXCL5 chemokine up-regulation in NTHi-induced OM model, in vitro and in vivo. We found 
that NTHi up-regulated CXCL5 expression by activating IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα 
 and p38 MAPK pathways via NF-κ 
B nuclear 
translocation-dependent and -independent mechanism. Curcumin not only inhibited the positive IKKβ 
 path-
way but also up-regulated the expression of MKP-1, a key negative regulator of p38 MAPK, thereby suppressing 
CXCL5 expression by dual action. Thus, the current study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism 
underlying the tight regulation of neutrophil attractant chemokine CXCL5 in the pathogenesis of NTHi-induced 
OM and also demonstrates the potential of curcumin as a novel therapeutic for treating OM (Fig. 8).
NF-κ 
B was found to be the major transcription factor regulating NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression. In our 
study, both IKKβ 
-Iκ 
Bα 
 and p38 MAPK pathways were found to act via p65 subunit to regulate NF-κ 
B tran-
scriptional activity, albeit through different mechanisms to induce CXCL5 expression. Under resting conditions 
NF-κ 
B is present in the cytoplasm bound to Iκ 
Bα 
. Upon activation of upstream signaling pathways, NF-κ 
B 
dissociates from Iκ 
Bα 
 and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. CAPE, an inhibitor of NF-κ 
B 
nuclear translocation, inhibited p65 nuclear translocation and suppressed NF-κ 
B transcriptional activity that in 
turn suppressed CXCL5 expression. Interestingly p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 failed to inhibit p65 nuclear 
translocation but suppressed NF-κ 
B transcriptional activity and CXCL5 expression. These findings suggest that 
p38 MAPK regulates NF-κ 
B transcriptional activity itself but not p65 nuclear translocation. Previous studies 
have reported that post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation of p65 are critical 
 
for promoting its DNA binding and interaction with transcriptional machinery to regulate gene expression. 
 
p38 MAPK was found to regulate the acetylation status of p65 but not its phosphorylation. In response to acti-
vating stimuli, p38 was found to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator p300 (a histone acetyltransferase). 
Phosphorylated p300 binds to and acetylates K310 residue on p65. Acetylation of K310 was shown to enhance 
p65 transcriptional activity39. Therefore it likely that p38 MAPK mediates NTHi-induced CXCL5 expression in a 
similar manner by increasing NF-κ 
B transcriptional activity, independent of p65 nuclear translocation.
OM, a leading cause of conductive hearing loss in children, is caused by NTHi1. OM is characterized by the 
presence of excessive inflammation in the middle ear3,40. Current therapies for OM involve the use of analgesics 
and antipyretics for symptomatic treatment41. Though these medications are effective during certain stages of 
the disease, prolonged usage poses the risk of serious side effects due to unknown “off-targets” and weakened 
immune system. Decongestants, antihistamines, and corticosteroids have not been effective in treating OM42. 
Prophylactic use of antibiotics has rendered over 80% of the NTHi strains drug-resistant4,5. Also, development of 
vaccines against NTHi remains a challenge due to the high genetic diversity of NTHi strains and high antigenic 
variability of surface-exposed antigens43,44. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing alternative therapeutics 
for OM with increased efficiency and safety. Therefore, identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms leading 
to up-regulation of inflammation is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies with increased

specificity and reduced side effects. Interestingly, in the current study we provide evidence that curcumin inhib-
its NTHi-induced CXCL5 chemokine expression in middle ear epithelial cells. Interestingly, both pre-infection 
and post-infection treatment with curcumin not only inhibited NTHi-induced CXCL5 up-regulation but also 
suppressed PMN infiltration into the middle ear in a mouse model of OM. Curcumin treatment’s efficacy in 
inhibiting CXCL5 expression and PMN recruitment post-NTHi infection is of particular clinical significance. 
Recently chemokines and chemokine receptors are increasingly considered as targets for developing new drugs 
to control inflammation45. Our finding that curcumin suppresses NTHi-induced CXCL5 chemokine expression is 
of particular relevance in the current scheme of identifying chemokine-drug combinations to treat inflammation. 
Thus, curcumin could be repurposed as a new therapeutic for treating OM.
Curcumin is a nutraceutical that has been in use in South Asian countries for many centuries owing to its 
medicinal properties20. Curcumin can interact with a myriad of signaling molecules including transcription 
factors, protein kinases, growth factors, receptors, adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines46, thus 
explaining it pleiotropic therapeutic potential against a wide range of diseases. Curcumin does not present a 
dose-limiting toxicity, making it suitable for prolonged usage. Completed clinical trials reported usage of cur-
cumin dosage ranging from 0.045 to 8 g/day. Currently, 38 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of curcumin at 
a dosage ranging from 0.18 to 8 g/day for treating pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, kidney dis-
ease, Crohn’s disease, cancer are underway47. United States Food and Drug Administration classified curcumin 
as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), warranting its use as a supplement. In the current study, we identified 
a novel role of curcumin in suppressing CXCL5 chemokine production. Co-administration of curcumin along 
with piperine, docetaxel, soy isoflavones, bioperine, lactoferrin, mesalamine in clinical trials48–52, suggest the 
possibility of customizing curcumin-based therapies to maximize its therapeutic efficiency. Since bioavailability 
of curcumin is a challenge47, further studies combining the use of adjuvants, lipids, nanoparticles are needed to 
elucidate further the potency of curcumin in treating OM.
Another relevant finding of biological significance in the current study is the dual acting mechanism of cur-
cumin in inhibiting CXCL5 expression. Curcumin inhibited NTHi-induced IKKβ 
 phosphorylation, thereby 
suppressing CXCL5 up-regulation. Moreover, we found that curcumin also inhibits NTHi-induced CXCL5 
expression via MKP-1-dependent suppression of p38 MAPK. In the absence of MKP-1, curcumin failed to sup-
press CXCL5 expression. Due to the importance of p38 in maintaining homeostasis, up-regulation of negative 
regulator MKP-1 by curcumin could play an important role in controlling the over-active immune responses with 
minimal side effects. This finding is of particular translational significance due to the attractiveness of targeting 
overactive inflammation via induction of negative-regulators19.
We previously demonstrated that dexamethasone glucocorticoid inhibits p38 MAPK via up-regulation of 
MKP-153. Glucocorticoids owing to their potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects have been in 
use for treating a gamut of diseases such as asthma, allergies, skin disorders, multiple sclerosis, immune disorders 
and cancer. However, prolonged usage has been reported to cause severe, sometimes irreversible side effects 
such as osteoporosis, endocrine and metabolic disorders, behavioral and cognitive changes, gastrointestinal 
tract complications, uveitis and weakened immune system54. Numerous studies over the past years have demon-
strated that curcumin’s efficacy in resolving pathologies was similar to that of dexamethasone55,56. No evidence 
of side effects with low to moderate consumption of curcumin exists. With a higher curcumin dosage 12 g/day, 
 
mild symptoms such as diarrhea, low blood sugar, abdominal pain, and indigestion have been reported47. 
Additionally, curcumin has been reported to aid in overcoming the side effects of glucocorticoid usage57. 
Curcumin is also effective against oxidative stress, characteristic of many inflammatory conditions. Curcumin 
supplementation could be an effective disease preventive strategy due to its immunomodulatory activity58. Thus, 
curcumin fits the bill for an alternative therapeutic with minimal side effects.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of CXCL5 
chemokine, which could, in turn, suppress inflammation. Further studies promoting curcumin bioavailability 
may provide means to develop therapies to modulate inflammation more stringently without adverse effects. 
Development of drug delivery systems in the form of a topical ointment and ear drops could be of clinical signif-
icance in treating OM. The findings of this study may have applications in a broader context to other pathologies 
including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
Cells were stimulated with NTHi for 12 h. Culture 
media was harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 × 
 g for 10 min to precipitate cell debris. Culture supernatants were 
assayed using human ENA78/ CXCL5 ELISA kit (Sigma) according to manufacturer’s protocol. OD was meas-
ured using Benchmark Plus microplate spectrophotometer. A standard curve showing the relationship between 
concentration and OD was generated for CXCL5 protein standards. CXCL5 protein concentration in culture 
supernatants was determined by interpolating from the standard curve.
Western Blot Analysis. 
Following NTHi stimulation, whole cell extracts were recovered with lysis buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 
NaF, supplemented with1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail). Cell extracts were incubated 
on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × 
 g for 30 min to precipitate cell debris. Supernatants were separated 
on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked 
with blocking buffer (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% nonfat dry milk). After 3 washes with 
TBS-T, the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 1: 1,000–1: 2,000 dilutions in antibody 
dilution buffer (TBS-T containing 5% BSA) at 4 °C. After 3 washes with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated 
with corresponding secondary antibody at 1: 5,000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h. After 3 washes with TBS-T, 
the proteins were visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare). Images have been 
cropped for presentation. Full-size images are presented in Supplementary Figs 1–4.
Mice and Animal Experiments. 
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Anesthetized 
mice were trans-tympanically inoculated with NTHi at a concentration of 5 × 
 107 CFU per mouse. Saline was 
inoculated as control. For inhibition studies, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with curcumin (50 mg/kg) 
1 h prior or 1 h after NTHi inoculation. For mRNA analysis, mice were sacrificed 6 h post-NTHi inoculation. Total 
RNA was extracted from the dissected mice middle ear. For PMN analysis, mice were sacrificed 9 h post-NTHi 
inoculation. Middle ear effusions from mice were harvested with 10 μ 
l saline (x3). Following cytocentrifugation 
cells were stained with Diff-Quik stain kit (Siemens) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Images were recorded 
with light microscopy system (AxioVert 40 CFL, AxioCam MRC and AxioVision LE Image system, Carl Zeiss). 
All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of, and were approved by, The Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee at Georgia State University.

Immunofluorescence staining. 
HMEECs were grown on 18 mm round glass coverslips (VWR). Cells 
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies at 1: 100–1: 400 dilu-
tions. Primary antibody was detected with FITC or Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. The coverslips 
were mounted onto glass slides using VECTASHIELD HardSet Antifade mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector). 
Images were recorded with fluorescence microscopy system (AxioVert 40 CFL, AxioCam MRC and AxioVision 
LE Image system, Carl Zeiss).
Statistical analysis. 
All experiments were repeated in at least three independent experiments. Data are 
shown as mean ± 
 standard deviation (s.d.). The difference in means was assessed with unpaired student’s t-test for 
data with two conditions (k = 
 2), ANOVA (with Tukey’s post-hoc) for data with more than two conditions (k > 
 2), 
using SPSS 22 statistics software (IBM). * 
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
