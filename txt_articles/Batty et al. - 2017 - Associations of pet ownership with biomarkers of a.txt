RESEARCH
Associations of pet ownership with biomarkers of ageing: 
 
population based cohort study
G David Batty,1 Paola Zaninotto,1 Richard G Watt,1 Steven Bell2
ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To examine the prospective relation between animal 
companionship and biomarkers of ageing in older 
people.
DESIGN
Analyses of data from the English Longitudinal Study 
of Ageing, an ongoing, open, prospective cohort study 
initiated in 2002-03.
SETTING
Nationally representative study from England.
PARTICIPANTS
8785 adults (55% women) with a mean age of 67 
years (SD 9) at pet ownership assessment in 2010-11 
(wave 5).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Established biomarkers of ageing in the domains of 
physical, immunological, and psychological function, 
as assessed in 2012-13 (wave 6).
RESULTS
One third of study members reported pet ownership: 
1619 (18%) owned a dog, 1077 (12%) a cat, and 
274 (3%) another animal. After adjustment for a 
range of covariates, there was no evidence of a clear 
association of any type of pet ownership with walking 
speed, lung function, chair rise time, grip strength, 
leg raises, balance, three markers of systemic 
inflammation, memory, or depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION
In this population of older adults, the companionship 
of creatures great and small seems to essentially 
confer no relation with standard ageing phenotypes.
Introduction
The notion that animal companionship might be linked 
to human health can be traced to ancient writings and, 
with the first population based study conducted at least 
four decades ago,1 the specialty has a long research 
pedigree. This is particularly the case for the study 
of patient groups, with rather fewer investigations of 
the general population.2-4 That present day surveys 
indicate that around half of UK households own a 
pet5—reflecting secular increases over recent years—
suggests that interaction with animals is perceived as 
life enhancing.
There are persuasive prima facie reasons to 
anticipate that pet ownership may have both negative 
and positive health consequences. Deleterious impacts 
on human health could occur if owners delayed their 
own medical care in preference to pet welfare; grief and 
distress occurred after a companion animal’s death6; 
or, most obviously, owners were attacked by their pet.7 
The numerous potential zoonotic hazards that might 
accompany pet ownership have been described, but 
occurrences seem rare, at least in Western societies.8 9 
Alternatively, psychological health may be improved by 
the perceived sense of companionship provided by pets. 
The increased physical exertion commensurate with 
dog ownership10 11 may influence weight regulation 
and therefore cardiometabolic factors. Additionally, 
case reports in diagnostic medicine describe the ability 
of pet dogs to detect the early stages of an epileptic 
fit and even selected malignancies.8 These supposed 
benefits arising from human-animal relationships 
have led to ambitious calls for the comprehensive 
integration of human, animal, environmental, and 
ecosystem health.12
Although some empirical evidence links animal 
companionship with apparent protection against a 
series of important health outcomes in middle aged 
populations, including premature mortality, obesity, 
hypertension, 
and 
hyperlipidaemia, 
systematic 
reviews13 and position statements3 suggest that 
these associations are not universal. Despite 12% of 
older Australians indicating that an animal was their 
predominant form of company,14 little is known about 
the impact of such companionship on physical and 
psychological biomarkers of ageing in older people—
factors that are related to life expectancy, chronic 
disease, and disability.15 If there is a relation with 
ageing biomarkers, which may be anticipated given 
the described links with physical exertion and sense 
of companionship, the public health implications of 
animal ownership could be important.
The few studies in this area have almost exclusively 
utilised a cross-sectional design and focused on 
single, self reported biomarkers of ageing, particularly 
depression, which provide only a partial understanding 
of the health consequences of pet ownership and raise 
concerns of recall bias, particularly in older groups. 
Reverse causality may also be a problem, whereby 
decreased mobility in older age may be the reason 
for seeking animal companionship, rather than 
the reverse, and this may have led to the apparent 
deleterious relation of certain pets with poor health 
status,16 including suboptimal mental health17 in some

studies of older people. Accordingly, we examined the 
prospective link between pet ownership and a selected 
range of objective biomarkers of ageing proposed for 
use in large scale population based studies of older 
people.15
Methods
Study population
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) 
is an ongoing, open, prospective cohort study of 
a representative sample of men and women who, 
when recruited in 2002-03 (wave 1), were aged 
50 or more and living in private households in 
England.18 Data have been collected biennially 
in the home using computer assisted personal 
interviews and self completion questionnaires, with 
additional nurse visits during alternate waves for 
the assessment of biomedical data. Comparison of 
the sociodemographic characteristics of participants 
against the profile in the national census indicates 
that the sample remains broadly representative of the 
English population.18
For the purposes of our analyses, the study baseline 
is wave 5 (2010-11), when inquiries about pet 
ownership were first introduced into the study. Cohort 
members were asked “Do you keep any household 
pets inside your house/flat?,” followed by items about 
specific pets (dog, cat, bird, other furry pet, or “other” 
type of pet).19 We collapsed the last three groups owing 
to a low prevalence of ownership.
Physical biomarkers
We utilised follow-up data on biomarkers of ageing as 
collected at wave 6 (2012-13), around two years after 
assessment of pet ownership.20 A walking speed test 
was administered to participants aged 60 years or 
more, using walking aids if required, and was based 
on the time taken to walk a distance of 2.4 m and 
back.21 Measures of physical strength included hand 
grip (for upper body) and the timed chair stand test (for 
lower body).22 A hand held dynamometer was used to 
measure hand grip strength (kg) in the dominant hand. 
In the chair stand test, the time required to rise from a 
chair to a full standing position on five occasions with 
arms folded across the chest was recorded; a slower 
time reflected poorer function.
Static balance was evaluated in three separate and 
progressively more difficult tests.23 24 For the side-by-
side and semi-tandem stand, we gave participants who 
could hold their position for 10 seconds a score of 1 
for each test outcome. For the full tandem stand, study 
members able to hold the position for 3-10 seconds 
scored 1 point, with those able to hold the position 
for more than 10 seconds allocated 2 points. A final 
score of 3 or less out of a possible 5 denoted impaired 
balance.23 A leg raise assessment was administered 
to all participants aged less than 70 years who 
successfully completed the side-by-side balance test: 
with their eyes open, study members were asked to 
raise one leg for 30 seconds from a standing position. 
Finally, forced expiratory volume in one second was 
ascertained using a standard handheld Vitalograph 
spirometer.25
Immunological biomarkers
A blood sample was drawn from consenting 
respondents 
and 
analysed 
for 
inflammatory 
markers, including acute phase reactants (high 
sensitivity C reactive protein, white blood cell count) 
and coagulation products (fibrinogen).26 27 The 
technicalities of the blood analyses, and the quality 
assessment of the measurement laboratory, have been 
described in detail elsewhere.28
Psychological biomarkers
Memory was measured using a word list learning 
test in which 10 words were presented orally to 
participants who were then asked to recall as many 
as possible immediately after reading, and again after 
a five minute delay during which they completed 
other survey items.29 30 Scores on both tests were 
totalled (range 0–20). Depressive symptoms were 
assessed at baseline and follow-up using the eight 
item Centre of Epidemiological Studies Depression 
scale.31 We used a score of 3 or more to define 
“caseness,”32 33 a threshold that has been validated 
against standardised psychiatric interviews in older 
populations.31
Confounding and mediating factors
Other data collected at baseline (wave 5), simultaneous 
with the assessment of pet ownership, were used to 
derive covariates. Height and weight were measured 
directly using standard procedures; body mass index 
was computed using the conventional formulas.23 
34 The remaining data were self reported. Cigarette 
smoking was classified as current, former, or never. 
An assessment of physical activity was based on items 
about engagement in activities of vigorous, moderate, 
or mild intensity, from which a 5 point scale was derived 
(a lower value denoting more sedentary behaviour). 
Alcohol intake was based on units consumed each 
week.35 Our socioeconomic variable was total net non-
pension household wealth as based on an estimation 
of the assets of study members and their partners, 
including, where applicable, properties, businesses, 
other assets, and any form of investments or savings 
(except for pension savings), less debts owed by them.36 
37 We created an index of social isolation by assigning 
scores based on responses to questions about marital 
status/cohabitation, contact with family or friends, 
and participation in social groups.38 A higher score 
indicated less social contact. The degree of loneliness 
was ascertained using the UCLA loneliness scale 
(revised)39; a higher score reflecting greater loneliness. 
Participants were also asked to rate their health on a 5 
point scale, with a higher score being less favourable. In 
regression analyses, we regarded wealth, self reported 
health, smoking status, and alcohol consumption as 
confounding factors, and social isolation, loneliness, 
physical activity, and body mass index as mediating 
factors. In further post hoc analyses, we also controlled

for baseline measurement of the outcome of interest as 
ascertained at wave 4 (2008-09).
Patient involvement
This paper is based on a prospective cohort study 
in which we recruited members of the general 
population and collected data on an array of potential 
risk factors and health outcomes. As a study of the 
general population, patients were not involved in 
constructing the present research question, the 
outcome measures, nor the design, recruitment, or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to disseminate the results of this specific 
research to study participants. The study data are 
freely available to the research community.
Data imputation and statistical analyses
Given loss to follow-up that is inevitable in a cohort 
study, we imputed missing data. This involved the 
generation of 10 datasets, resulting in a sample of 
8785 participants for our main analyses (fig 1). We 
ascertained if the imputations were plausible by 
comparing plots of the distribution of observed and 
imputed values. Effect estimates were computed 
separately for each of the 10 datasets and then 
combined using the Rubin method.40 Results using 
this approach were similar to those based on analyses 
of non-missing datasets, so we elected to report results 
from the imputed dataset for the greater precision it 
provides. We log transformed all ageing outcomes 
that were not normally distributed—in practice, the 
inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein, white 
blood cell count, and fibrinogen.41 β coefficients 
with accompanying 95% confidence intervals were 
estimated using a series of linear regression models; 
for the log transformed data, these coefficients and 
confidence intervals were multiplied by 100 and 
expressed as percentage differences.42 We used 
modified Poisson regression43 to estimate relative 
risks for binary ageing phenotypes. All effect estimates 
were adjusted for a series of covariates. We adopted 
a Bonferroni corrected P value threshold of <0.0045 
(0.05 divided by 11 outcomes) as providing strong 
evidence of differences in biomarkers between the 
pet ownership groups. All statistical analyses were 
conducted using Stata version 15.1.
Results
After imputation, in our analytical sample of 8785 
(4863 women; 55%) the mean age at baseline was 
67 years (SD 9), with mean age at follow-up around 
two years later of 69 (SD 8) years. One third of study 
members reported owning any type of animal: 1619 
(18%) a dog, 1077 (12%) a cat, and 274 (3%) other. 
Participants’ baseline characteristics did not differ 
consistently according to type of animal owned, and 
where differences were evident they were typically 
modest (table 1). Thus, compared with participants 
who did not own a pet, those who did were moderately 
younger and less likely to be physically inactive. Dog 
owners were more likely to be lonely and be in poorer 
health. Compared with participants who did not 
report owning a pet, in those who did, smoking was 
marginally more common.
For the longitudinal relations between pet 
ownership and the ageing biomarkers, results 
are divided according to theme of the outcome: 
physical function (fig 2), immune function (fig 3), 
and psychological function (fig 4). After adjustment 
for multiple covariates, there were no strong 
relations between different types of pet ownership

and the various physical biomarkers of ageing, and 
statistical significance at conventional levels was 
rarely apparent. Compared with participants who 
did not report pet ownership, dog companionship 
was associated with somewhat slower walking speed 
and a longer time to rise from a chair; conversely, 
dog ownership was also related to a slightly higher 
pulmonary function. Cat owners were more likely 
to fail the leg raise test than people in the other pet 
ownership groups. Pet ownership was essentially 
unrelated to our three immunological markers 
of C reactive protein, white blood cell count, and 
fibrinogen. There was no apparent relation between 
ownership of any type of pet and cognitive function 
or symptoms of depression.
We carried out some planned subgroup analyses. To 
make the impact of controlling for groups of variables 
transparent, we disaggregated the multivariable model 
into confounding and potential mediating factors 
(supplementary figures 1-3). We also examined if the 
relation of pet ownership with ageing biomarkers was 
modified by the owner’s sex (supplementary figures 
4-6); we explored the association of pet ownership 
with additional health indices that are not considered 
to be markers of ageing (supplementary figure 7); 
and, finally, we tested the impact of adjustment of the 
baseline (wave 4) assessment of each ageing biomarker 
(supplementary figures 8-11). In summary, in separate 
analyses of men and women, similar observations were 
made to those apparent in the full cohort; links between 
pet ownership and other health indices were few, and 
where they did exist were again of modest magnitude; 
and taking into account earlier measurement of the 
outcome of interest did not materially change our 
general finding of null results.
discussion
Of the widely used biomarkers of ageing we 
prospectively related to pet ownership in this study, 
there was no clear evidence of association. Some 
possible exceptions were walking speed and chair rise 
 
time, which were both less favourable among people 
reporting dog companionship, although the magnitude 
of these effects was undoubtedly low.
Strengths and limitations of this study
The present study has some strengths, which include its 
size; the analyses of the prospective relation between 
pet ownership and health, which reduces concerns 
about reverse causality; and the range of covariates 
captured, which allowed us to explore alternative 
explanations for the associations under investigation.
Our study does of course have its limitations. 
Firstly, to date, pet ownership was only measured 
on one occasion. With evidence suggesting that this 
characteristic is time varying,44 repeat assessment 
would provide more accuracy. The same concern could 
be applied to almost any exposure in epidemiology, 
however, including those that have subsequently 
become known causal risk factors for chronic disease 
(eg, smoking and lung cancer, raised blood pressure 
and stroke). It is likely that this variation over time 
in pet ownership would lead to an underestimation 
of the true effects.45 Secondly, it may also be that 
pet ownership has an impact on health outcomes 
that were not included herein, such as biomarkers of 
psychological stress (eg, cortisol). Thirdly, we had no 
information on who was responsible for the care of the 
pet—study members may report pet ownership, but 
they may not be the primary caregiver and therefore 
perhaps not experience the potential health benefits. 
We also did not have specific details of ownership 
which, in addition to caretaking, include frequency of 
interaction, and, in the case of dogs, the care of which 
may require higher levels of physical exertion, age 
and breed of the animal, duration of ownership, and, 
where applicable, time spent walking.46 Finally, as our 
study is observational, there is the perennial concern of

confounding by unknown factors. Randomised trials of 
the health consequences of pet ownership in an older 
population could be conducted, although blinding of 
participants and investigators would be impossible 
and the generalisability of findings from what are often 
highly select participants in trials is moot.
Comparison with other studies
With the exception of mental health outcomes, we 
are unaware of any observational studies that have 
examined the links between pet ownership and 
biomarkers of ageing. For depression, evidence from 
some cross sectional studies suggests that people 
who report owning animals experience a higher 
prevalence of such symptoms,14 whereas in a one 
year follow-up of a small group of older, community 
dwelling Canadians, animal companionship showed 
no relation with later psychological health ascertained 
using a non-standard questionnaire.47 A small, quasi-
intervention study comprising people with multiple 
sclerosis found an apparent improvement in walking 
speed after utilisation of a service dog.48
Conclusion
In the present study, the companionship of creatures 
great and small seems to confer essentially no relation 
with standard physical and psychological biomarkers 
of ageing.
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing was developed by a team of 
researchers based at University College London, the Institute for Fiscal 
Studies, and the National Centre for Social Research, UK.
Contributors: GDB conceived and designed the study, prepared an 
analytical plan, and wrote the manuscript. SB prepared an analytical 
plan and analysed all data. PZ and SB built the dataset. All authors 
commented on earlier versions of the manuscript. GDB and SB will act 
as guarantors. 
Funding: This study was funded by the US National Institute on 
Ageing, and a consortium of UK government departments coordinated 
by the Economic and Social Research Council. GDB is supported by 
the UK Medical Research Council (MRC; MR/P023444/1) and the US 
National Institute on Ageing (1R56AG052519-01; 1R01AG052519-
01A1). The views expressed herein by the authors are independent of 
all funding agencies.
Competing interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform 
disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: no 
support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial 
relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the 
submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or 
activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work. SB 
is the very proud owner of two naughty tortie Persian cats but, sadly, 
zero pugs. GDB, a vicarious rabbit owner as a child, does not currently 
own an animal but his home does have a minor moth infestation. 
PZ yearns for the parrots of her youth, Romeo and Juliet, but present 
living circumstances thankfully preclude such tragic romantic 
dalliances. RGW has a longstanding affection for dogs, not cats, and 
is the fond owner of a magnificent labrador, Tilda, named after the 
actress, not the Irish sister study to ELSA.
Ethical approval: Data collection for this study was approved by the 
London Multicentre Research Ethics Committee.

Data Service (www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/hseTitles.asp). Syntax for 
our analyses are available from SB.
Transparency: The lead author (GDB) affirms that the manuscript 
is an honest, accurate, and transparent account of the study being 
reported, and that no important aspects of the study have been 
omitted. and that any discrepancies from the study as planned (and, if 
relevant, registered) have been explained.
