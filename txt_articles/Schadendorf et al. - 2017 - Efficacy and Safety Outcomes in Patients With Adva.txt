Purpose
Approximately 40% of patients with advanced melanoma who received nivolumab combined with
ipilimumab in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse events (AEs). We conducted
a retrospective analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients
who discontinued treatment because of AEs.
Methods
Data were pooled from phase II and III trials of patients who received nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg
every 2 weeks (N = 409). Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who discontinued
because of AEs during the induction phase (n = 96) and in those who did not discontinue because of
AEs (n = 233). Safety was assessed in treated patients who discontinued because of AEs (n = 176) at
any time and in those who did not discontinue because of AEs (n = 231).
Results
At a minimum follow-up of 18 months, median progression-free survival was 8.4 months for patients
who discontinued treatment because of AEs during the induction phase and 10.8 months for
patients who did not discontinue because of AEs (P = .97). Median overall survival had not been
reached in either group (P = .23). The objective response rate was 58.3% for patients who dis-
continued because of AEs during the induction phase and 50.2% for patients who did not dis-
continue. The vast majority of grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred during the induction phase, with most
resolving after appropriate management.
Conclusion
Efficacy outcomes seemed similar between patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab
treatment because of AEs during the induction phase and those who did not discontinue because of
AEs. Therefore, even after discontinuation, many patients may continue to derive benefit from
combination therapy.

INTRODUCTION
The immune checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab
(anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4) and
nivolumab (anti-programmed death-1 [PD-1]),
alone and in combination, and pembrolizumab
(anti–PD-1) monotherapy are approved for the
treatment of advanced melanoma. Pembrolizumab
has shown improved overall survival (OS) com-
pared with ipilimumab monotherapy,1 and the
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has
demonstrated improved objective response rate
(ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) com-
pared with ipilimumab alone in patients with
advanced melanoma in both the phase II Check-
Mate 069 (Study of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab

 Ipilimumab Versus Ipilimumab Alone in Previously Untreated
Advanced Melanoma; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01844505)
trials.2-5 Recently, nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone
have demonstrated an improvement in OS compared with ipili-
mumab alone in CheckMate 067.6
Despite the high rate of efficacy with nivolumab and ipili-
mumab combination therapy, there are high rates of adverse
events (AEs). Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related AEs were expe-
rienced by 54% of patients who received combination therapy in
CheckMate 069, and more than one third of patients randomly
assigned to the combination group discontinued treatment be-
cause of AEs.5 Of the patients who received combination therapy
in CheckMate 067, 55% reported grade 3 or 4 treatment-related
AEs.3 Forty-seven percent of those receiving combination therapy
received more than four doses of nivolumab and entered the
nivolumab-alone maintenance phase; 53% received between one
and four doses of the combination during the nivolumab plus
ipilimumab induction phase.
When using nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination therapy,
what clinicians can expect when they need to discontinue treatment
because of AEs is one of the most important questions in the
treatment of patients. Although prior data have shown encouraging
efficacy among patients who discontinued immunotherapy at any
time,4-7 no data are available on efficacy outcomes among patients
who discontinued treatment early on (ie, before completion of the
induction phase). Furthermore, whether severe immune-mediated
AEs are a predictive marker for efficacy is still an unanswered ques-
tion.8 In this analysis, we evaluated efficacy outcomes in patients who
discontinued the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab because
of treatment-related AEs during the induction phase of the CheckMate
069 and 067 studies; in addition, we characterized the safety profile of
patients who discontinued treatment because of AEs.
METHODS
Study Design and Patients
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab combined with
ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma who discontinued
treatment because of AEs, data were pooled from the CheckMate 069 phase
II trial2 and the CheckMate 067 phase III trial3 (Fig 1). In both multicenter,
double-blinded, randomized trials, treatment-naive patients with unre-
sectable stage III or stage IV melanoma received at least one dose of nivolumab
1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses (induction),
and then nivolumab alone at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (nivolumab maintenance).
Additional eligibility criteria have been described previously.2,3 Patients were
treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dosing delays were per-
mitted to enable the management of drug-related AEs, and dosing was allowed
to resume once the AE resolved to either baseline or grade 1 severity. No dose
modifications were permitted. Patients who discontinued treatment during the
induction phase were not allowed to continue with nivolumab maintenance.
The protocol-specified reasons for discontinuation of treatment in both trials
are provided in the Data Supplement. Each study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board at each participating study site, and the studies
were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines as defined by the International Conference
on Harmonisation. All the patients (or their legal representatives) provided
written informed consent before enrollment.
Efficacy and Safety Assessments
Patients were assessed for efficacy if they had received at least one dose
each of nivolumab and ipilimumab as combination therapy and dis-
continued treatment because of AEs during the induction phase of treatment
(n = 96) or did not discontinue treatment because of AEs (n = 233; Fig 1).
For patients who discontinued before receiving nivolumab monotherapy, the
induction phase was defined as the time between the first and last doses of
combination treatment. Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-
mors, version 1.1,9 tumor response was assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks
after the patient was randomly assigned, then every 6 weeks for the first
12 months, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression, withdrawal of
consent, or study discontinuation. The efficacy outcomes assessed were PFS,
OS, ORR, best overall response, time to response, duration of response, and
reduction in tumor burden. Minimum follow-up was 18 months.
Patients were assessed for safety if they had received at least one dose
each of nivolumab and ipilimumab as combination therapy. All patients
had safety data collected continuously during the treatment period and for
a minimum of 100 days from the last dose of study therapy. Two patient
cohorts were included in the safety analyses: patients who discontinued
and had a treatment-related AE any time (within either the induction
period or the nivolumab maintenance period; n = 176) and patients who
did not discontinue treatment because of AEs (n = 231; Fig 1). Safety
analyses, including laboratory assessments, were conducted 14 days before
the initiation of treatment and within 72 hours before the next cycle of
treatment of up to seven cycles. Safety was then formally assessed at every
subsequent dose.
Safety evaluations included the assessment of treatment-related AEs,
which were assessed and graded according to the National Cancer Institute

 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.10 An AE
was deemed to be on-study if it occurred within 30 days after the last dose
of study treatment. Additional safety evaluations included treatment-
related select AEs (ie, those with a potential immunologic basis); time to
onset and resolution of select AEs, defined as complete resolution
or improvement to baseline grade; and serious AEs (SAEs), defined as
those AEs that may lead to or result in death, are or may become
life threatening, may result in or lead to in-patient hospitalization or
prolongation of hospitalization, or may result in or lead to significant
disability or incapacity.
Statistical Analyses
Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS, OS, and duration of response with
two-sided 95% CIs were calculated using the Brookmeyer and Crowley
method, with hazard ratios estimated using an unstratified Cox pro-
portional hazards model; P values were assessed using an unstratified log-
rank test. The proportion of patients with a complete or partial response
(ORR) was calculated using the Clopper and Pearson method; two-sided
P values were calculated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
A total of 409 patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab
plus ipilimumab in the CheckMate 069 and CheckMate 067
studies. All randomly assigned patients were included in the ef-
ficacy analyses. Two patients were not treated and were therefore
excluded from the safety analyses (Fig 1). Among the 407 patients
who received combination treatment, 176 (43%) discontinued
treatment because of AEs, of whom 96 (24%) discontinued because
of AEs during the induction phase (Fig 1). The remaining 231
patients did not discontinue treatment because of AEs; this group
included those who discontinued treatment for other reasons (eg,
97 [42%] because of disease progression). The baseline charac-
teristics were generally well balanced between the group of patients
who discontinued during the induction phase and those who did
not discontinue because of AEs; however, significantly fewer pa-
tients had M1c disease and elevated lactate dehydrogenase among
those who discontinued because of AEs at any time compared with
those who did not discontinue because of AEs (Data Supplement).
Patients who discontinued treatment because of AEs at any
time received a median of three doses of nivolumab (range, one to
45) and ipilimumab (range, one to four). In patients who dis-
continued during the induction phase, the median number of
doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab was three each (range, one to
four). Patients who did not discontinue treatment because of AEs
received a median of 14 doses of nivolumab (range, one to 58), and
four doses of ipilimumab (range, one to four). The median du-
ration of treatment was 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.1 months),
1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6 months), and 9.4 months (95% CI,
5.1 to 14.8 months) in patients who discontinued because of AEs at
any time, who discontinued during the induction phase, and who
did not discontinue because of AEs, respectively.
Subsequent systemic treatments were received by 61 patients
(35%) who discontinued treatment because of AEs at any time, 37
patients (39%) who discontinued during the induction phase, and
55 patients (24%) who did not discontinue because of AEs (Data
Supplement). The median time to subsequent systemic therapy
was not reached in patients who discontinued because of AEs at any
time or in patients who did not discontinue treatment because of
AEs, with 115 of 176 patients (65%) and 178 of 233 patients (76%)
free of systemic treatments at 12 months, respectively. The median
time to subsequent systemic therapy was 25.3 months for patients
who discontinued because of AEs during the induction phase, and
59 of 96 (61%) were free of systemic treatments at 12 months.
Efficacy
Investigator-assessed ORR was 58.3% (95%, CI 47.8% to
68.3%) for patients who discontinued during the induction phase
and 50.2% (95% CI, 43.6% to 56.8%) for patients who did not
discontinue because of AEs (P = .180; Table 1). The proportion of
patients with a complete response and the time to response were
similar across the two subgroups, and the median duration of
response was not reached in either group (Table 1; Fig 2). The
proportion of patients with an ongoing response was 64% for
patients who discontinued treatment because of AEs during the
induction phase and 80% for patients who did not discontinue
because of AEs (Table 1). The median reduction in tumor burden
was 251.4% for both groups (Data Supplement).
The median PFS for patients who discontinued treatment
during the induction phase because of AEs was 8.4 months (95%
CI, 5.8 to 16.7 months) and 10.8 months (95% CI, 5.9 to
23.0 months) for patients who did not discontinue because of AEs
(hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.37; P = .966; Fig 3A). PFS
rates at 18 months were 38% and 49% for patients who dis-
continued because of AEs during the induction phase and patients
who did not discontinue because of AEs, respectively. Similarly,
there was no difference in OS between these groups (Fig 3B), with
the medians not reached in either group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95%
CI, 0.54 to 1.17; P = .2344). OS rates at 18 months were 67% for
patients who discontinued because of AEs during the induction
phase and 62% for those who did not discontinue because of AEs.

Outcomes After Discontinuation of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab
 Safety
Overall, 156 of 407 treated patients (38%) discontinued treatment
because of any-grade treatment-related AE, the vast majority of which
were grade 3 or 4 AEs (Table 2). Colitis was the most frequently
reported treatment-related AE, which led to discontinuation in 40
patients (10%), followed by elevated alanine aminotransferase (5%)
and aspartate aminotransferase (4%).
Treatment-related SAEs led to hospitalization in 125 (71%) of
the 176 patients who discontinued because of an AE at any time
and 131 (57%) of the 231 patients who did not discontinue because
of an AE. Colitis was the main SAE leading to hospitalization; it
occurred in 37 (21.0%) of the patients who discontinued because
of AEs and in six (2.6%) of the patients who did not discontinue
because of AEs.
Treatment-related select AEs were pooled and assessed by
organ category. The most frequently observed grade 3 or 4
treatment-related select AEs for patients who discontinued because
of AEs at any time were GI, and included diarrhea (20%) and colitis
(20%; Data Supplement). For patients who did not discontinue
because of AEs, grade 3 or 4 hepatic AEs were most frequently
observed (10%). Fifty percent of patients who discontinued be-
cause of an AE at any time and 19% of patients who did not
discontinue because of AEs experienced AEs in two or more select
organ categories (Data Supplement). Less than 2% of patients in
either subgroup experienced AEs in three or more organ categories.
In both treatment subgroups, the majority of grade 3 and 4
select AEs seemed to occur during the induction phase, with skin
AEs typically developing the fastest (2 to 3 weeks), followed by GI
AEs (6 to 11 weeks), hepatic AEs (8 to 10 weeks), and endocrine
AEs (11 to 12 weeks; Fig 4). The vast majority of grade 3 and 4
select AEs resolved after the use of established safety algorithms,
typically within 3 to 5 weeks, with the exception of endocrine AEs
(Table 3). Most endocrine AEs did not resolve, because patients
requiring long-term hormone and/or corticosteroid replacement
therapy were not considered to have resolved by definition.
Systemic corticosteroids were the most common immuno-
suppressive agents used for AE management; they were used in
91% of patients who discontinued because of an AE and in 55% of
patients who did not. Infliximab was used in 10% compared with
1% of patients, likely as a result of the higher number of patients
with colitis among those who discontinued because of an AE.
Administration of infliximab on tumor kinetics was assessed in
the subgroup of patients who discontinued because of colitis at
any time and who were treated with infliximab (Data Supplement).
Treatment with infliximab did not seem to affect the development of
a response or the durability of response; however, a few patients who
received infliximab did seem to progress after an initial response.
Overall, as reported previously, three patients died as a result
of treatment-related AEs.2,3,5 One patient with a history of cardiac
issues died 29 days after one dose of treatment as a result of
ventricular arrhythmia; a second patient who received three doses
of treatment died 69 days after the last treatment as a result of
pneumonitis and iatrogenic pneumothorax; and a third patient
died 86 days after the last treatment, with the cause of death listed
as panhypopituitarism with cortisol deficiency and adrenal crisis.
DISCUSSION
In this post hoc, retrospective analysis of data from patients with
advanced melanoma who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab
combination therapy, most who discontinued because of AEs did
so during the induction phase, before receiving all four doses of the
combination. PFS, OS, and ORR seemed to be similar in patients

 who discontinued treatment because of AEs during the induction
phase and in those who did not discontinue because of AEs. The
median duration of response has not yet been reached in either
group. The median time to subsequent systemic therapy was not
reached for those patients who discontinued treatment because of
AEs at any time or for those patients who did not discontinue
because of AEs, and was 25 months in patients who discontinued
because of AEs during the induction phase.
Two general hypotheses were considered before this analysis.
First, the group who did not discontinue because of AEs would
have improved efficacy because they generally were receiving treat-
ment for a longer period thanwere those who did discontinue because
of AEs during the induction phase. The second hypothesis was that
high immune-mediated AEs in patients who discontinued because of
AEs could be a signal that an immune reaction had been activated.
Our results support the second hypothesis, because the group
who discontinued because of AEs during the induction phase had
efficacy outcomes similar to those who did not discontinue
because of AEs.
Caution should be taken in the interpretation of these
findings, given that this analysis is retrospective. Notably, the
proportion of patients with M1c disease and elevated lactate de-
hydrogenase was lower in those patients who discontinued because
of AEs compared with those who did not discontinue because of
AEs at any time, which suggests that patients who did not dis-
continue because of AEs may have had a worse prognosis. In
addition, interpretation of these data is complex because it is
difficult to assess the respective role of two variables that may

Outcomes After Discontinuation of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab
 influence efficacy: duration of treatment, and immune-related AEs
as a marker of a strong immune reaction. It has been suggested that
the development of select treatment-related AEs may be associated
with response; however, not all evidence supports this.8 Finally,
there was a relatively short follow-up period in the current analysis;
a longer follow-up of the patients (particularly for PFS and OS) will
be required to determine if continued treatment among those who
did not discontinue because of AEs results in better outcomes
compared with those who discontinued because of AEs.
Patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab
because of AEs had a pattern of select treatment-related AEs
similar to that of patients who did not discontinue because of
AEs, albeit with a greater frequency. It also seems that patients
who discontinued because of AEs had select treatment-related
AEs occur earlier (by a few weeks) compared with patients who
did not discontinue because of AEs. Importantly, the wide
range of onset suggests that physicians and patients need to
remain vigilant over time because some AEs can occur late.
Most grade 3 and 4 select treatment-related AEs in both patient
groups resolved within a few weeks with appropriate temporary
immunosuppression. The lack of an obvious effect of inflix-
imab on response in our study is consistent with the results of
a recent pooled analysis of data from the CheckMate 069 and
CheckMate 067 trials.11 In that analysis, OS outcomes were
similar between patients with immune-related GI AEs who
received corticosteroids, with or without infliximab, and those
who had immune-related GI AEs but did not receive immu-
nosuppressive agents.11
New, prospective trials are required to better address the role
of anti–PD-1 maintenance therapy after induction with nivolumab
plus ipilimumab. It is possible that patients who discontinue
combination therapy because of AEs may still benefit from ad-
ditional treatment with anti–PD-1 monotherapy, provided there is
complete resolution of their AEs. However, recurrence of an AE is
an important consideration in the continued treatment of these
patients.12 More evidence is needed to determine whether patients
should discontinue therapy after they have demonstrated a clinical
response and to determine the optimal duration of treatment
required to reach a maximum response. In addition, there is in-
terest in understanding the predictive capacity of onset of AEs on
efficacy outcomes. The randomized discontinuation trial design
has been implemented successfully to evaluate the efficacy of
treatments for a variety of diseases.13-15 This trial design may help
address unanswered questions in future trials of combination
therapy in advanced melanoma.
In conclusion, most patients who discontinued the combina-
tion of nivolumab and ipilimumab did so before receiving all four

 doses of the combination. Efficacy of nivolumab plus ipilimumab
seemed to be similar for those who did and did not discontinue
because of AEs. This suggests that patients may continue to derive
benefit from combination therapy even after treatment is stopped
because of AEs. Whether AEs are a precondition for this post-
discontinuation benefit remains an open question.
