IMPORTANCE Therapeutic options for severe emphysema are limited. Lung volume reduction
using nitinol coils is a bronchoscopic intervention inducing regional parenchymal volume
reduction and restoring lung recoil.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of nitinol coils in
treatment of severe emphysema.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter1:1randomizedsuperioritytrialcomparing
coilswithusualcareat10universityhospitalsinFrance.Enrollmentofpatientswithemphysema
occurredfromMarchtoOctober2013,with12-monthfollow-up(lastfollow-up,December2014).
INTERVENTIONS Patients randomized to usual care (n = 50) received rehabilitation and
bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids and oxygen; those randomized to
bilateral coil treatment (n = 50) received usual care plus additional therapy in which
approximately 10 coils per lobe were placed in 2 bilateral lobes in 2 procedures.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was improvement of at least 54 m in
the 6-minute walk test at 6 months (1-sided hypothesis test). Secondary outcomes included
changes at 6 and 12 months in the 6-minute walk test, lung function, quality of life as
assessed by St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire (range, 0-100; 0 being the best and 100
being the worst quality of life; minimal clinically important difference, �4), morbidity,
mortality, total cost, and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS Among 100 patients, 71 men and 29 women (mean age, 62 years) were included. At
6 months, improvement of at least 54 m was observed in 18 patients (36%) in the coil group
and 9 patients (18%) in the usual care group, for a between-group difference of 18% (1-sided
95% CI, 4% to �; P = .03). Mean between-group differences at 6 and 12 months in the coil
and usual care groups were +0.09 L (95% CI, 0.05 L to �) (P = .001) and +0.08 L (95% CI,
0.03 L to �) (P = .002) for forced expiratory volume in the first second, +21 m (95% CI,
−4 m to �) (P = .06) and +21 m (95% CI, −5 m to �) (P = .12) for 6-minute walk distance, and
−13.4 points (95% CI, −8 points to �) and −10.6 points (95% CI, −5.8 points to �) for
St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire (1-sided P < .001 for both). Within 12 months, 4 deaths
occurred in the coil group and 3 in the usual care group. The mean total 1-year per-patient
cost difference between groups was $47 908 (95% CI, $47 879-$48 073) (P < .001); the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $782 598 per additional quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this preliminary study of patients with severe emphysema
followed up for 6 months, bronchoscopic treatment with nitinol coils compared with usual
care resulted in improved exercise capacity with high short-term costs. Further investigation
is needed to assess durability of benefit and long-term cost implications.

E
mphysema,akeycomponentofchronicobstructivepul-
monary disease, is characterized by lung tissue inelas-
ticity, air trapping, and hyperinflation, causing dys-
pnea, exercise limitation, and impaired quality of life.
Management of severe emphysema represents a challenge be-

comes, particularly in pa-
tients with upper lobe–
predominant emphysema
and low exercise capacity.1,2 However, lung volume reduction
surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Shape-memory nitinol coils are nonblocking devices bron-
choscopically delivered into subsegmental airways to induce
regional parenchymal volume reduction, enhance lung re-
coil, and reestablish small airway tethering. To date, coils have
been investigated in 5 nonrandomized studies8-11,13 and 1 ran-
domized, controlled 90-day crossover study.12,14 These stud-
iesreportedthatcoiltreatmentprovidedimprovementinqual-

Highcostsareassociatedwithlungvolumereductionstrat-

should consider evidence of cost-effectiveness. Because the
health economic evidence base for bronchoscopic interven-
tional strategies is minimal,15 the current study design in-
cluded a cost-effectiveness analysis.
TheREVOLENStrial(RéductionVolumiqueEndobronchique
par Spirales) was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, cost,
and cost-effectiveness of coil treatment in severe emphysema.
Methods
Study Oversight
Ten sites throughout France participated in the study. This
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Dijon Est I and
by the French Agency for Medicines and Health Products. A
website was accessible to participants and referring physi-
cians (http://www.euroemphysema.com). Enrollment of par-
ticipants started in March 2013 and was completed in Octo-
ber 2013. The last follow-up visit was in December 2014. An
independent data and safety monitoring board monitored
eventsandreviewedefficacyresults.Thetrialprotocolhasbeen
previouslypublished16andisavailableinSupplement1.Allpar-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Patient Population and Randomization
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive
usual care or coils using a centralized computer-generated ran-
domization system with fixed blocks of 4. The main inclu-
sion criteria were bilateral emphysema, postbronchodilator
forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of less than
50% predicted, residual volume (RV) of greater than 220% pre-
dicted, and formal pulmonary rehabilitation within the pre-
vious 12 months (eBox in Supplement 2).
Emphysema was quantified in each lobe using the Na-
tional Emphysema Treatment Trial visual assessment score.17
The most severely affected lobe of each lung was targeted for
coil treatment and the upper lobe was chosen when ipsilat-
eral scores were the same. Scoring and targeting were deter-
mined by each site. No computed tomography densitometry
analysis was used in this study.
Usual Care Group
Patients were treated at the discretion of the patient’
s physi-
cian in compliance with international guidelines; ie, they re-
ceived prerandomization rehabilitation, inhaled bronchodi-
lators, and influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, with or
without inhaled corticosteroids and with or without oxygen,
according to the degree of severity and exacerbation rate.
Intervention Coil Group
Patients in the coil group received the same treatment as the
usualcaregroupandalsoreceivedcoiltreatmentwithin15days
after randomization. The contralateral treatment was com-
pleted 1 to 3 months after the first. All coil insertion proce-
dures were conducted under general anesthesia using fluoros-
copytoguideplacement(eFigures1and2inSupplement2).Two
sizes of coil (100 mm and 125 mm; PneumRx/BTG) were avail-
able. Approximately 10 coils per targeted lobe were delivered.
The coil group received amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 2 g (or clin-
damycin,600mg,andgentamycin,5mg/kg,ifallergictoamoxi-
cillin),immediatelybeforetheprocedure.Chestradiographywas
performed within 2 hours of and at 24 hours after the proce-
dure (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). In the absence of significant
complications,patientsweredischargedatthediscretionofthe
attending physician.
Follow-up
Allpatientswereassessedatbaselineandat1,3,6,and12months
after baseline. All patients underwent medical examination,
6-minutewalktestonroomair,chestx-ray,andpulmonaryfunc-
tion tests according to international guidelines.18 Patients com-

Study End Points
The primary outcome was improvement of at least 54 m in the
6-minutewalktestat6months.Thecutofftodefinearesponder

”Secondaryend
points were changes at 6 and 12 months from baseline in the
6-minutewalkdistance,pulmonaryfunctiontests(FEV1,forced
vitalcapacity[FVC],RV,totallungcapacity[TLC],andRV/TLC),
dyspnea(modifiedMedicalResearchCouncildyspneascaleand
Baseline Dyspnea Index/Transition Dyspnea Index), and qual-
ity of life (St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire and EuroQol 5
Dimensions Questionnaire) in each group.
The safety outcomes included all nonserious and serious
adverse events. In the coil group, serious adverse events were
stratified by occurrence within 30 days vs after 30 days to 12
months. A composite score included any of the following se-
rious adverse events occurring within 24 hours after treat-
ment: death, pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement
for more than 7 days or surgical treatment, hemoptysis greater
than 150 mL, and invasive ventilation for more than 24 hours.
A second composite score also included the following serious
adverse events occurring within 12 months in both groups:
death, hemoptysis greater than 150 mL, pneumonia requir-
ing hospitalization, pneumothorax requiring chest tube place-
ment for more than 7 days or surgical treatment, invasive ven-
tilation for more than 24 hours, and lung transplantation.
Economic Evaluation
The prospective economic evaluation was concurrent with the
randomized trial, in accordance with the CHEERS statement.20
The prospective analysis was conducted from the health care
perspective to determine the cost per quality-adjusted life-
year (QALY) gained with coils compared with usual care over
a 1-year period. Both hospital and nonhospital resources were
considered. Procedure costs for coil treatment were obtained
with a bottom-up microcosting approach that identified all rel-
evant cost components of the procedure and valued each com-
ponent for all individual patients using duration of the proce-
dure, staff, medical devices, and type of operating room as
variables. Unit costs are presented in eTable 1 in Supplement
2. All costs are in 2014 US dollars (US $1 = €0.754 in 2014) and
are not discounted because of the short time horizon.
HealthoutcomesarevaluedinQALYs.Health-relatedqual-
ity of life was assessed using the EuroQol 5 Dimensions self-
administered questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.
TheutilityvaluesarebasedonFrenchtariffsforthecorrespond-
ing EuroQol 5 Dimensions scores. Utility curves were obtained
for each group by plotting average utility values at baseline, 6

Acost-effectivenessanalysiswasconductedtoestimatein-
cremental costs per incremental QALY. Incremental costs were
taken as the difference in per-patient costs between groups.
Baseline characteristics, QALYs, and costs are described
using counts (and proportions), means (with standard devia-
tions or 95% confidence intervals), or medians (with inter-
quartile ranges). Differences in costs and QALYs were tested
using standard parametric or nonparametric tests (t test or
Mann-Whitney test) as appropriate and are described as means
(with 95% confidence intervals). The incremental cost differ-
ence and generated 95% confidence intervals were calcu-
lated using nonparametric bootstrapping with 1000 replica-
tions. An acceptability curve was generated based on the
bootstrapresults.Statisticalsignificancefordifferencesamong
a priori comparisons was set at P = .05 (2-sided).
Statistical Analyses
The statistical power to demonstrate a superior success rate (1-
sidedhypothesistest)intheprimaryendpointforthecoilgroup
vs the usual care group was anticipated to be 90% with a sig-
nificance of α = .05 at a total sample size of 100 patients, based
on the hypothesis of a 37% end-point achievement in the coil
group and 5% in the usual care group and with 30% of patients
unable to perform the 6-minute walk test or lost to follow-up
at 6 months. The hypothesis of a 37% primary end-point
achievement in the coil group was based on data provided by
PneumRx in 2012. One-sided statistical tests were considered
appropriate in view of the favorable results of previous smaller
studies9-14,21 and confirmed by a recent meta-analysis.22 The
sample size was calculated using Nquery software, version 7.0
(Statistical Solutions Ltd).
Variables are presented using means with standard devia-
tions or raw numbers and percentages. Differences at base-
line between groups were analyzed using the χ2 test, t test, or
Fisher exact test.
Fortheprimaryendpoint,intention-to-treatanalyseswere
conductedusingamultipleimputationmethodformissingdata
usingSASproceduresPROCMIandPROCMIANALYSE(SASver-
sion 9.3, SAS Institute Inc). A logit model was used to impute

walk test at 6 months, based on the parameters of FEV1, FVC,
RV, St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire total score, modi-
fiedMedicalResearchCouncildyspneascale,andBaselineDys-
pnea Index/Transition Dyspnea Index. Ten imputations were
performed. Bivariable logistic models were then fitted with the
imputed values using treatment group as the predictor vari-
able. An additional maximum bias analysis considering pa-
tients who did not perform the 6-minute walk test to be non-
responders for the primary end point was also conducted.
The secondary end points for efficacy (1-sided test) and
safety (2-sided test) outcomes were analyzed using the χ2 test,
ttest,orFisherexacttest,orWilcoxontestwhenapplicable,with
no data imputation. For quantitative end points, mean differ-
ences and 1-sided 95% confidence intervals were reported. All
end points were assessed by intention-to-treat analysis.

An independent data monitoring team ensured 100%
source verification of the data. Statistical analyses were per-
formed according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan
(available in Supplement 3). No intermediary statistical analy-
ses were conducted. A 1-sided P < .05 was considered statis-
tically significant for the efficacy analysis. No adjustment of
significancelevelwasusedforthesecondaryendpoints,which
were then exploratory. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered sta-
tistically significant for baseline between-group compari-
sons and for safety analyses. SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS

Results
Patients and Procedures
Of 116 patients who consented, 100 patients were random-
ized to the coil (n = 50) or usual care (n = 50) groups (Figure).
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Among the 50
patients randomized to the coil group, 47 patients received bi-
lateral and 3 received unilateral coil treatment (Figure), for a
total of 97 procedures (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). A mean of
9.8 (SD, 1.3) coils per procedure were placed. The mean pro-
cedure time was 54 (SD, 17) minutes.

were significant in the coil group compared with the usual care
group in the 6-minute walk test (when analyzed as percent
change but not when analyzed by distance walked), FEV1, FVC,
RV,RV/TLC,modifiedMedicalResearchCouncildyspneascale,

c The 6-minute walk test was
conducted with 1 patient receiving
oxygen in error, and the patient was
retained for further follow-up and
included in analyses.
dThe modified Medical Research
Council dyspnea scale grades 5
different levels of dyspnea based on
the circumstances in which it arises.
See Methods section of text for
description.
e One patient with a modified Medical
Research Council dyspnea scale
score of 1 was included in error but
was included in the follow-up and
analyses.
f The Baseline Dyspnea Index uses 5
grades (0-4) for 3 categories,
functional impairment, magnitude
of task, and magnitude of effort,
with a total score of 0 to 12. Higher
scores indicate less dyspnea.
g The St George’
s Respiratory
Questionnaire (range, 0-100) has 3
component domains (impact,
activity, and symptoms) measuring
quality of life. Higher scores indicate
worse quality of life.
h A visual score from 0 to 4 was
assigned to each lobe, based on the
extent of tissue destruction, where
0 = no emphysema, 1 = 1% to 25%
emphysematous, 2 = 26% to 50%,
3 = 51% to 75%, and 4 = >75%.
i Emphysema was classified as
heterogeneous if there was a
difference of greater than 1 point
between ipsilateral lobes.

Health Economic Evaluation
The health economic evaluation was based on data from all 50
patients in each group. At 1 year, the mean cost difference per
patient was $47 908 (95% CI, $47 879-$48 073; P < .001)
(Table 4). The change in mean QALYs at 1 year was 0.038 (95%

The 12-month incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was
$782 598 per QALY (95% CI, $663 496-$1 327 212 per QALY).
The uncertainty associated with the cost-effectiveness of coil
treatment is shown as a scatter plot of the mean cost and QALY
differences in eFigure 5A and the acceptability curve is shown
in eFigure 5B in Supplement 2.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized multicenter
study assessing the 6-month efficacy, 1-year safety, and cost-
effectivenessofendobronchialcoiltreatmentinsevereemphy-
sema. Among patients followed up for 6 months, broncho-
scopic treatment with nitinol coils compared with usual care
resulted in improved exercise capacity with high short-term
costs. One of the main strength of this study is the complete-
ness of follow-up at both 6 and 12 months. Coil treatment was
associatedwithasignificantdecreaseinlunghyperinflationand
sustained improvement in quality of life. The magnitude of
changes in lung function and quality of life were very similar

changes in quality of life in our study were higher than usually
observed in endobronchial lung volume reduction clinical
trials.3,4Becauseourstudywasdesignedtomirrorreal-lifeclini-
cal decision making, computed tomography assessments were
conducted by each investigator without central reading center
or proprietary software analyses. Collateral ventilation was not
evaluated because fissure integrity did not influence response
to coil treatment.11 There was no difference in efficacy be-
tween heterogeneous and homogeneous emphysema, as pre-
viously shown.9,22 To evaluate coils as a therapeutic option
for patients typically excluded from lung volume reduction
trials, we did not exclude patients with 6-minute walk test
results of less than 140 m, diffusing capacity of the lungs for
carbon monoxide of less than 20% predicted, lower lobe–
predominant emphysema, homogeneous emphysema, hypox-
emia, hypercapnia, or α1-antitrypsin deficiency or patients tak-
ing anticoagulation drugs (except for vitamin K antagonists) or

our inclusion criteria of an RV of greater than 220% predicted
was more restrictive than in previous coil treatment studies.22
Overall,ourpopulationwasauniqueseverelyhyperinflatedand

There were several limitations to this study. First, the pre-
specified statistical analysis for efficacy was 1-tailed. Based on
this method, the trial met its prespecified primary end point
forsuccessat6months.However,additionallargerstudieswith
longer follow-up using 2-tailed statistical analyses are needed
to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the long-term effi-
cacy of coil treatment. Second, this study was neither sham
controlled nor blinded, which needs to be considered for the
interpretation of the 6-minute walk test, which is effort de-
pendent. Third, the 6-minute walk test method was a single
test with no supplemental oxygen, and the cutoff to define a
responder was 54 m.19 The lack of practice of a second 6-min-
ute walk test has been shown to increase the variance of this
measure.23 The American Thoracic Society guidelines recom-
mend a standard oxygen titration protocol to determine walk

ductionrandomizedtrials.1-4The54-mcutoffistwicethemost
recent minimal clinically important difference standards for
the 6-minute walk test, which are between 25 m and 30 m.24
Finally, a key factor influencing our 6-minute walk test out-
come may have been prebaseline pulmonary rehabilitation,
which was an inclusion criterion in our study. In a recent meta-
analysis, the mean change in the 6-minute walk test result af-
terrehabilitationinchronicobstructivepulmonarydiseasewas
estimated to be 43.9 m.25 Our study showed a relatively mod-
est magnitude of change, with a between-group difference of
21 m in the 6-minute walk test at both 6 and 12 months, which
was statistically significant at 6 months when analyzed as per-
cent change but not when analyzed by change in distance
walked and not significant at 12 months (although our study
was not powered for a 12-month end point). Compared with
the meta-analysis on coil treatments,22 our 6-minute walk dis-
tance changes from baseline were much lower at both 6 and
12 months, whereas the changes in lung function and quality
of life were in the same range. Finally, the absence of system-
atic prespecified continuation of rehabilitation after random-
ization could be regarded as an issue for the assessment of the
long-term benefits of the intervention.
Whenthebetween-groupdifferencesinthesecondaryend
points were compared with validated minimal clinically im-
portant differences in chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, the improvement in quality of life assessed by the
St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire was largely higher than
4 points26 at both 6 and 12 months (means, −13.4 and −10.6
points, respectively) and the improvement in dyspnea as-
sessedbytheTransitionDyspneaIndexwashigherthan1unit27
at both 6 and 12 months (means, 1.6 and 1.1 units, respec-
tively). The mean between-group differences in changes in RV
at6and12monthswereboth7%androughlyreachedthemini-
mal clinically important difference, which is a change be-
tween6.1%and8.6%.28ForFEV1,themeanbetween-groupdif-
ferences were 0.09 L at 6 months and 0.08 L at 12 months and
did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of
0.1 L.29
The magnitude and severity of serious and nonserious ad-
verse events in this study were consistent with previous coil
studies,22 similar to endobronchial valves,3,4 and far less than
for lung volume reduction surgery.1,2 The rate of pneumonia
was very similar to that recently reported in a meta-analysis
of 140 patients treated with coils.22 All cases of pneumonia re-
solved with medical care. The mechanisms involved in pneu-
monia may result from local airway irritation, subsegmental
airway closure, tension-induced inflammation, or local ische-
mia rather than from an infectious mechanism. Additional
studies assessing pneumonia or lung opacities associated with
coil treatment are needed to better understand the mecha-
nisms, risk factors, and short-term and long-term evolution.
Our study also demonstrated the feasibility of bilateral coil
treatment in this severely ill population; 94% of patients as-
signed to the coil group completed bilateral treatment.
The study design included a health economic analysis to
inform health care payers. The short duration of the follow-up
precluded any robust conclusion on the long-term efficiency
of the procedure because the procedure and device costs
should be allocated over the total duration of clinical benefit.
If we assumed that the QALYs gain could be maintained over
at least 3 years with identical follow-up costs in both groups,
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would decrease to
about $270 000 per QALY, close to the incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio reported for lung volume reduction surgery
intheUnitedStates.30Thiscost-effectivenessratioat1yearand
modeled to 3 years would not be considered efficient enough
to warrant adopting the technology by most countries. Imple-
mentation of this technique in a large-scale emphysema popu-
lation is likely to require this additional data given the high per-
patient cost in the short run and the uncertain effect on total
health care expenditures. Therefore, our study included both
a crossover and an extended (5-year) follow-up including a
health economic analysis of all treated patients.
Conclusions
In this preliminary study of patients with severe emphysema
followed up for 6 months, bronchoscopic treatment with ni-
tinol coils compared with usual care resulted in improved ex-
ercise capacity with high short-term costs. Further investiga-
tionisneededtoassessdurabilityofbenefitandlong-termcost
implications.

PneumRx and receipt of travel reimbursements and
speaker fees for educational sessions from
PneumRx. Dr Dutau reports receipt of consultant
fees from Novatech. Dr Bourdin reports advisory
board membership and participation as an
investigator in clinical trials sponsored by
GlaxoSmithKline, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis,
and AstraZeneca. Dr Pison reports support for
lectures and travel from Pulmonx. No other
disclosures were reported.
Funding/Support: The REVOLENS Study was
supported by an academic grant from the French
Ministry of Health (Direction Générale de l’
Offre de
Soins, PSTIC-2012), which required a randomized
trial design associated with an economic evaluation
including a cost-effectiveness analysis. The coils
were purchased from the manufacturer,
PneumRx/BTG.
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The French Ministry
of Health had full access to the results of the study
but had no involvement in the design and conduct
of the study; collection, management, analysis, and
interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or
approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit
the manuscript for publication.
