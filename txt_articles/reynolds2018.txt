 A Multicomponent, Preschool to Third Grade Preventive
Intervention and Educational Attainment at 35 Years of Age
Arthur J. Reynolds, PhD; Suh-Ruu Ou, PhD; Judy A. Temple, PhD
IMPORTANCE Educational attainment is the leading social determinant of health, but few
studies of prevention programs have examined whether the programs are associated with
educational attainment outcomes after the mid-20s, especially for large-scale programs that
provide a longer duration of services.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between a preschool to third grade intervention and
educational attainment at midlife and differences by program duration, sex, and parental
educational level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This matched-group, alternative intervention study
assessed 1539 low-income minority children born in 1979 or 1980 who grew up in
high-poverty neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. The comparison group included 550 children
primarily from randomly selected schools participating in the usual early intervention. A total
of 989 children who entered preschool in 1983 or 1984 and completed kindergarten in 1986
were included in the Chicago Longitudinal Study and were followed up for 27 to 30 years
after the end of a multicomponent intervention. A total of 1398 participants (90.8%) in the
original sample had educational attainment records at 35 years of age. The study was
performed from January 1, 2002, through May 31, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS The Child-Parent Center Program provides school-based educational
enrichment and comprehensive family services from preschool to third grade
(ages 3-9 years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Educational outcomes from administrative records and
self-report included school dropout, 4-year high school graduation, years of education,
postsecondary credential, and earned degrees from associate’
s to master’
s or higher.
RESULTS A total of 1539 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.1 [0.32] years; 1423 [92.9%] black
and 108 [7.1%] Hispanic) were included in the study. After weighting on 2 propensity scores,
preschool participants had higher rates of postsecondary degree completion, including
associate’
s degree or higher (15.7% vs 10.7%; difference, 5.0%; 95% CI, 1.0%-9.0%), master’
s
degree (4.2% vs 1.5%; difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-4.1%), and years of education (12.81 vs
12.32; difference, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.20-0.77). Duration of participation showed a consistent
linear association with outcomes. Compared with fewer years, preschool to second or third
grade participation led to higher rates of associate’
s degree or higher (18.5% vs 12.5%;
difference, 6.0%; 95% CI, 1.0%-11.0%), bachelor’
s degree (14.3% vs 8.2%; difference, 6.1%;
95% CI, 1.3%-10.9%), and master’
s degree or higher (5.9% vs 2.3%; difference, 3.6%; 95% CI,
1.4%-5.9%). The pattern of benefits was robust and favored male participants for high school
graduation, female participants for college attainment, and those from lower-educated
households.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study indicates that an established early and continuing
intervention is associated with higher midlife postsecondary attainment. Replication and
extension of findings to other locations and populations should further strengthen
confidence in the health benefits of large-scale preventive interventions.

ecause of its influence on a wide variety of life-course
outcomes, educational attainment is arguably the most
important long-term outcome of early childhood in-
terventions(ECIs).Loweducationalattainment(ie,highschool
credential or less) is a major risk factor for all 7 health metrics
of the American Heart Association (eg, hypertension, smok-
ing, and obesity),1-3 economic disparities, criminal behavior,
and mental health problems.4-8 For these reasons, educa-
tional attainment is the leading social determinant of health
inHealthyPeople2020.9Earlychildhoodinterventionsareone
of the most promising and consequential of all prevention
programs,10-13 but few, if any, studies have examined the en-
tire spectrum of education from high school dropout to post-
secondary success, primarily because of the lack of follow-up
beyond 25 years of age, when continuing education is preva-
lent.
Findingsarealsoinconsistentacrossstudies,14-19withsome
showing positive effects on high school graduation and/or col-
lege attendance and others showing no such effects, a mixed
patternfavoringhighschoolorcollegeattainmentbutnotboth,
anddifferencesbysexorracialgroups.Moreover,toourknowl-
edge, no previous studies have assessed degree completion for
large-scale, public programs after the mid-20s.
In the Perry Preschool Study,17 for example, program par-
ticipants had significantly higher rates of high school gradu-
ation than controls, but no differences were observed for post-
secondary degree attainment. The reverse pattern was found
in the Carolina Abecedarian Project.18 Because of small sample
sizes, no credible interpretations about subgroup associa-
tions were possible. A designed replication of the Abecedar-
ianProject,theInfantHealthandDevelopmentProgram,found
no differences in high school dropout.16 Other long-term fol-
low-upstudies,includingofHeadStart,15,19havereportedposi-
tive associations with educational attainment up to 25 years
of age. Differences by sex vary across studies,17-20 but high-
risk groups, including the most economically disadvantaged,
have had greater benefits.13,20,21
Given the relatively small samples and limited number of
programs analyzed in long-term follow-up studies, differ-
ences by child and family characteristics and for different dos-
ages of intervention are underinvestigated.22,23 This limits the
implications of findings for health promotion and economic
mobility. Because postsecondary attainment for low-income,
minority populations is not usually completed until the early
30s,24 midlife follow-up is essential for understanding im-
pacts. Sex and family socioeconomic status moderate life-
course outcomes.4,15,24
In our study, we assessed for the first time, to our knowl-
edge, links between participation in the Child-Parent Center
(CPC) program, a large-scale and multicomponent school-
based ECI, and educational attainment at 35 years of age. We
addressed whether (1) CPC program participation beginning
at 3 or 4 years of age was linked to greater educational attain-
ment, including postsecondary degree completion; (2) dura-
tion of participation up to 6 years was associated with greater
attainment; and (3) increases were modified by sex and pa-
rental educational level. We hypothesized that earlier and con-
tinuing participation would link to attainment and that men
and those whose parents had less education would show
greater benefits.
Methods
Study Design
The Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS) is a multisite, prospec-
tive investigation of CPC and early experiences on well-being
across the life course.14,25,26 The study sample includes 1539
low-income, minority children born in 1979 or 1980 who grew
up in high-poverty neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. In this
matched-group, alternative-intervention design, all 989 chil-
drenwhoenteredpreschoolin1983or1984andcompletedkin-
dergarten in 1986 from 20 CPCs were included. The same-age
comparison group of 550 children was enrolled from 5 ran-
domly selected Chicago public schools with alternative ECIs
(full-daykindergarten;15%withHeadStartpreschool)or8CPC
sites without preschool experience. Previous reports25-27 have
described the sampling, baseline characteristics, and design
elements (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). All data
collection procedures have been approved by the University
of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. All participants pro-
vided written or oral informed consent, and all data were de-
identified for analysis.
Because of living in high-poverty neighborhoods, chil-
dren in this cohort were eligible for and participated in gov-
ernment-funded early childhood programs. Like most other
studies of established programs, random assignment to the in-
tervention was not possible and would have violated the le-
gal rules that require enrollment of the neediest children on a
first-come, first-serve basis.25,27 Data were collected from ad-
ministrativerecords,schools,andfamiliesfrombirthto35years
of age.

Key Points
Question Does participation in a large-scale, preschool to third
grade intervention for economically disadvantaged children link to
midlife educational attainment?
Findings In a cohort study that followed up 1398 children to 35
years of age, 4 to 6 years of intervention was significantly
associated with a 48% higher rate of degree completion
(associate’
s degree or higher) compared with lesser participation.
Preschool participation was independently associated with most
attainment outcomes, including years of education, with greater
benefits for those whose mothers were high school dropouts.
Meaning Multiyear, comprehensive preventive interventions
beginning in early childhood can promote long-term educational
success that contributes to positive health and economic
outcomes.

 being otherwise served. The program is designed to promote
children's school competence, especially school readiness,
achievement, and family involvement in learning. Each center
is colocated in a school or on school grounds and serves 100 to
150 children beginning in preschool who then matriculate to
school-age services in the same location. Any child who visits a
CPC site receives services. Participation age ranges from 1 to 6
years. In addition to a leadership team in each site, all teachers
havebachelor’sdegreesandarestatecertified(eMethodsinthe
Supplement).
Major program elements include the following: (1) high-
quality educational enrichment through reduced class sizes
and a balance of teacher- and child-directed learning; (2)
family support services that include participation in school
activities, support groups and workshops, and home visits;
and (3) comprehensive services that include nutritional and
health supports (ie, subsidized meals, health screening, and
speech therapy). Service continuity from preschool to third
grade (ages 3-9 years) is a hallmark, thus providing a stable
and predictable learning environment. The CPC program is
being expanded as a multicomponent school reform
model.28,29
Outcomes
The full spectrum of secondary and postsecondary educa-
tion was assessed. All measures were dichotomous except
years of education. Data were obtained from administrative
records of various sources and were supplemented by inter-
views with youths and family members. For higher educa-
tion, the National Student Clearinghouse was the primary
source.30 More than 3600 public and private colleges, repre-
senting 98% of all students, report enrollment and gradua-
tion data. We used data collected from matched records
from those reports and the Illinois Shared Enrollment and
Graduation Consortium (now part of the National Student
Clearinghouse) from January 1, 2002, to May 31, 2015 (mean
age, 35.1 years) (eMethods in the Supplement). The amount
and sources of information were similar among the inter-
vention groups.
Secondary education was measured by 5 indicators: drop-
out by 16 years of age, 4-year graduation (earned diploma
within 4 years of ninth grade entry), and 3 others, including
high school completion (earned diploma or General Educa-
tional Development credential). Postsecondary education was
measured by years of education (range, 7-22 years), college at-
tendance (2 or 4 years), degree completion (associate’s and
higher), and a credential (eg, occupational certificate)
(eMethods in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
With use of methods of previous studies,14,21,25 outcomes
were analyzed by probit and linear regression in Stata statis-
tical software, version 14 (StataCorp).31 Findings are
reported as means or percentages and group differences
after adjusting for the influence of the covariates through
inverse probability weighting (IPW).32,33 Inverse probability
weighting adjusted for each individual’s propensity to enroll
in the program (selection model) and to leave the study
sample (attrition model) (eMethods in the Supplement).
After major assumptions were corroborated, propensity
scores for each model were estimated through probit regres-
sion, with the resulting values used as inverse weights to
estimate associations.34 As a double adjustment, the
weights were multiplied together.
Inverse probability weighting is a more flexible and com-
prehensive analytic approach than traditional covariate ad-
justmentormatchingandyieldsestimateswiththelowestvari-
ances and SEs in large samples while correcting for potential
biases.34,35 The covariates of the propensity scores were mea-
suredprimarilybetweenbirthand5yearsofage,includingfam-
ily risk indicators, sex, race/ethnicity, and child welfare his-
tory. There were 17 covariates for the selection model and 26
for the attrition model (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement).
Models were estimated separately for preschool and
school-age and for extended intervention groups. Dichoto-
mously coded CPC preschool participation at 3 or 4 years of
age and school-aged participation from first to third grade
were assessed simultaneously. The CPC extended interven-
tion for 4 to 6 years was assessed against the comparison
group with less extensive participation (0-3 years). Duration
was also analyzed among 6 groups consistent with a dosage-
response relationship.
A dummy code for missing data was included to deter-
mine whether estimates based on multiple imputation (ex-
pectation maximization) affected outcomes. We adjusted SEs
for school-level clustering (mean intraclass r value, 0.05), al-
though this did not affect estimates. Group differences and
marginal effects were emphasized, with 95% CIs. Robustness
analyses included each IPW model separately (selection and
attrition)andthetraditionalcovariateapproach.Sexandmoth-
er’s educational level subgroups were estimated in separate
models, with interpretations emphasizing differences shown
in the overall model.
Results
Cohort Follow-up at 35 Years of Age
A total of 1539 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.1 [0.32] years;
1423 [92.9%] black and 108 [7.1%] Hispanic) were included
in the study. In May 2015, a total of 1398 participants
(90.8%) from the original sample had data on educational
attainment. Retention rates were 91.4% for the intervention
group and 89.8% for the comparison group. The high rate of
retention was attributable to the use of multiple sources of
data, including administrative, self-report, and follow-up
tracking. Among those with available information, 963
(72.5%) in the total sample resided in Illinois, with most
others (213 [16.0%]) remaining in the Midwest (70 partici-
pants had missing contact information). Table 1 gives the
rates of participation over time and attrition. The compari-
son group received a variety of early childhood services.
There was no evidence of selective attrition by program
status.14,25 The attrition sample included those who moved
and were not located or deceased (eTable 1 and eMethods in
the Supplement).

 Group Comparability
At follow-up, the program and comparison groups were
similar on most characteristics (Table 2). These characteris-
tics were measured from administrative records and family
surveys primarily between birth and 5 years of age. The
groups were similar in employment, single-parent family
status, neighborhood poverty, and adverse experiences (eg,
parent substance abuse). They differed in mother’s educa-
tional level and child welfare but were equivalent among
male participants. The original sample had similar group
equivalence (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The original and
follow-up samples had similar attributes (eg, family risk,
program participation) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). How-
ever, the attrition sample had a higher percentage of male
participants. Inverse probability weighting accounted for
differences in analyses (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement).
Outcomes for Preschool and School-aged Participation
As indicated in Table 3, after controlling for IPW selection and
attrition, the preschool group had significantly higher levels
of educational attainment on 9 of 12 outcomes. These out-
comes included a higher rate of 4-year high school gradua-
tion (51.0% vs 44.0%; difference, 7.0%; 95% CI, 1.4%-12.6%),
college attendance (61.2% vs 53.1%; difference, 8.1%; 95% CI,
0.8%-15.4%), associate’s degree or higher (15.7% vs 10.7%; dif-
ference, 5.0%; 95% CI 1.0%-9.0%), and master’s degree or
higher (4.2% vs 1.5%; difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-4.1%)
(Figure). The advantage for years of education was a half year
(12.81 vs 12.32 years), but the difference for an earned bach-
elors’ degree was smaller (11.0% vs 7.8%). The only differ-
ence for CPC school-age was in on-time high school gradua-
tion.
Outcomes for Extended Program Participation
Compared with fewer years of participation, the CPC 4- to
6-year group (extended intervention) had higher levels of
educational attainment on 11 of 12 outcomes. These out-
comes included a higher rate of 4-year high school gradua-
tion (55.3% vs 44.7%; difference, 10.6%; 95% CI, 3.4%-
17.8%) (Table 3 and Figure), 4-year college attendance
(31.4% vs 24.0%; difference, 7.4%; 95% CI, 0.4%-14.4%),
associate’s degree or higher (18.5% vs 12.5%; difference,
6.0%; 95% CI, 1.0%-11.0%), bachelor’s degree (14.3% vs
8.2%; difference, 6.1%; 95% CI, 1.3%-10.9%), and postsec-
ondary credential (25.0% vs 18.1%; difference, 6.9%; 95%
CI, 0.9%-12.9%) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The percent-
age improvements over the comparison group were 38.1%
for associate’s degree or higher and 48.0% for postsecond-

a Program participation covers the 6-year period (1983-1989) that defines
enrollment in the CPC intervention.
bThe CPC preschool comparison group participated in a full-day kindergarten
program, and 84 participated in Head Start preschool. A total of 109 parents in
the comparison group reported that their child participated in other child care
or education in preschool, and 176 individuals in the comparison group were
eligible to receive limited services in the CPC program for kindergarten but
enrolled in different classrooms; they are not part of the original CPC
intervention group. Some individuals in the comparison group participated in
the school-aged program because it was open to any child enrolled in
elementary school from first to third grade. Fifteen children in the CPC
intervention group enrolled in the alternative full-day kindergarten.
c These categories account for attrition from the original study sample of 1539.
Individuals were unavailable for follow-up during the postprogram years
because they moved from Chicago and could not be located, were deceased,
or did not have sufficient identifying information to track, refused to
participate, or were incarcerated (other). At 35 years of age, the total number
of deceased individuals in the study was 73. Seven individuals who died after
July 1, 2009, were included in the study sample. The attrition sample of 141
had missing data on educational attainment between the ages of 28 and 35
years.

a Data are presented as percentage of individuals unless otherwise indicated. The child and family background
indicators were measured from administrative records (birth certificates, school records) primarily from birth to
5 years of age. Parent reports from ages 7 to 12 years were used to supplement some risk indicators (eg, number
of children). These and other indicators were used in the inverse probability weighting models. Home
environment problems (eg, frequent family conflict) and adverse child experiences were from retrospective
reports. The preschool to third grade group showed similar patterns and is not shown.
bThe index ranges from 0 to 7, with higher numbers indicating greater levels of family risk.

thelargestdifferencesbetweentheminimumandmaximumdu-

age points (53.2% vs 30.6%; marginal effect, years = 3.0%; 95%
CI, 1.8%-4.1%).
The second result was that the high-dosage groups, which
participated in the entire program from preschool to at least
second grade (4-5 years or 5-6 years), had the greatest attain-
ment difference with the preschool and kindergarten group for
all 3 high school graduation measures and bachelor’s degree
or higher (eg, 15.4% vs 8.5% for preschool to second grade vs
preschool only). They also had increased educational attain-
ment compared with the lower dosage groups, including the
school-aged intervention group with no preschool (eTable 6
in the Supplement).
Third, the attainment levels of the 2 high-dosage groups
were similar. Program groups had increases in degree attain-
ment between 28 and 35 years of age that were more than
double those of the comparison groups (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement).

 Differences by Subgroups
Separate estimates were reported for sex and mothers’ edu-
cational level (eTables 7 to 10 in the Supplement). Compared
with male participants, female participants had higher rates
of educational attainment. Although postsecondary out-
comes were increased for female participants, in the ex-
tended intervention, the difference was significant for col-
lege attendance only (female participants: 73.5% vs 62.6%;
difference, 10.9%; 95% CI, 3.3%-18.5%; male participants:
50.8%vs49.0%;difference,1.8%;95%CI,−7.7%-11.2%)(eTable
7 in the Supplement). For mothers’ educational level, differ-
ences in years of education, 4-year college attendance, asso-
ciate’s or higher degree, and postsecondary credential were
greater for preschool participants whose mothers dropped out
of high school compared with those with mothers who were
high school graduates (eTable 9 and eTable 10 in the Supple-
ment). This finding and others for 3 postsecondary outcomes
are shown in the Figure. The difference in high school attain-
ment was greatest for male participants, especially as dura-
tion of intervention increased (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
Robustness Analysis
We compared the main IPW model with 3 others: (1) covariate-
adjusted model with no IPW, (2) IPW for program selection,
and (3) IPW for attrition. As reported in eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment, program estimates were robust across models that bal-
anced the covariates between groups (eTables 11 and 12 in the
Supplement). The covariate-adjusted model yielded slightly
lower estimates of impact (eFigures 1, 3, and 4 in the
Supplement).
Discussion

vices beyond 5 years of age are especially limited.
As the most comprehensive longitudinal study of an es-
tablished large-scale program, CPC was associated with edu-
cational attainment in midlife. We found positive outcomes for
4-year high school graduation, college attendance, and de-
gree completion (associate’s degree or higher). Given that edu-
cational attainment is the leading social determinant of health,

adjustments. Unadjusted biserial correlation between years of intervention
(defined by the groups in the table) and the outcome is adjusted to account
for dichotomous outcomes.

 findings demonstrate that school-based early childhood pro-
grams, such as the CPC program, have significant potential to
advance life-course health and well-being. For example, all 7
ideal health metrics of the American Heart Association1-3 (eg,
hypertension) are associated with educational attainment in
a dosage-response fashion.36,37 Higher levels of education are
associatedwithgreatereconomicwell-being,5,38,39reducedde-
pression, and involvement in the justice system.5,6 Increased
access to high-quality programs provides an important av-
enue of improved well-being.
The program had compensatory effects for those at el-
evatedrisk:blackmaleparticipantsandchildrenofschooldrop-
outs. Although the results varied by duration of intervention,
they indicate that prevention can be particularly effective in
increasing educational attainment for those with the largest
disparitiesinoutcomes.Forexample,thepreschoolgroupfrom
low-education households had a 2-fold increase in bachelor’s
degree attainment compared with the comparison group. This
result dovetails with previous findings14,21,25 and supports the
CPC program in enhancing quality, intensity, and continuity
of learning.27-29
Our focus on 4-year high school graduation is unique and
reflects a key Healthy People metric.9 The association be-
tween intervention and the educational attainment con-
tinuum in midlife increases the likelihood that the CPC pro-
gram can influence adult health.40 This finding is supported
by increasing literature that early childhood experiences link
to healthy behaviors.39,41 A major implication is that invest-
mentsintheECI,whetherduringthepreschoolorearlyschool-
agedyears,areinvestmentsinpublichealthandcanaffectlong-
term outcomes. Although access to publicly funded preschool
hasincreasedinrecentyears,only42%ofchildrenaged4years
and 15% of those aged 3 years enroll in state prekindergarten,
Head Start, or other programs.42 Continuing participation in
programssimilartotheCPCprogramisnottrackedbuthasbeen
estimated to be less than 10%.22,23,28 Our findings indicate the
importance of increasing the availability of such services.
Another unique feature of the study was examination of
preschool to third grade services within a dosage framework.
Research on dosage effects have been limited despite their di-
rect policy implications. Studies43,44 have found that an ad-
ditional year of preschool leads to improvements in educa-
tional outcomes. Whether the effects are sustained largely
depends on the quality of subsequent experiences.4,23,27 Our
findings extend previous work by showing that years of par-
ticipation from preschool to second or third grade were linked
to all high school graduation outcomes. Years were also asso-
ciated with higher rates of earned degrees, including a bach-
elor’s degree. Long-term effects on education can be strength-
ened if services continue through at least second grade.
Theprocessesthataccountfortheobservedlinkswithedu-
cational attainment are complex, but several have been iden-
tified. Through educational enrichment, the CPC program and
other interventions promote early cognitive scholastic skills,
which lead to better school performance and adjustment and
increased school commitment, thereby reducing the need for
treatment.11,15,17,22Similarcumulativeprocessesofeffectshave
been found for family support and parenting behaviors and
school support and quality.22,23,45 Socioemotional advan-
tages (eg, self-control) also have a key role in explaining links
with crime prevention and college persistence.11,45 The linch-
pin of this mediational process is that initial links are suffi-
ciently strong as a function of effective implementation. How
this process carries over to physical health and health behav-
iors in midlife warrants further investigation, but educa-
tional attainment is a key conduit that contributes to a pro-
cess of cumulative advantage.4,36,37,45
A rare feature that further strengthens inferences is the
availability of complete records of attainment from multiple
sources. Education is a continuous process that extends into
the 30s for the CLS cohort and in general. The CPC preschool
to third graders and preschoolers had nearly doubled rates of
degree attainment from 28 to 35 years of age, whereas the rates
for comparison groups increased slightly (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). The program groups also had increased rates of
earned degrees by nearly 50% (Table 3 and Table 4). Despite
economic barriers that make it more difficult for poor and mi-
norityyouthstopursuepostsecondaryeducation,46thesefind-
ings indicate that prevention early in life can help reduce eco-
nomic disparities in attainment at a time when the returns to
college are increasing.5,46
Nevertheless, these sizable benefits do not eliminate dis-
parities across the education continuum with more advan-
tagedgroups,especiallyfordegreecompletion.47,48Earlychild-
hood programs, which are targeted to families at higher levels
of risk, would not be expected to permanently compensate for
continuing disadvantages. For example, the rate of arrest
among CLS youths is double the national rate,49 and this dif-
ference accounts for the higher rates of attainment for female
participants in the study and substantially contributes to the
lower rates of degree completion compared with the general
population.
Limitations
This study has 3 limitations. First, the findings are based on a
quasi-experimental design, and thus the strength of infer-
ences may not be as strong as in well-executed randomized ex-
periments. Nevertheless, the groups were largely equivalent
and findings were consistent across analytic methods. Sec-
ond,measuresofpostsecondaryeducationwerecollectedfrom
administrative records and supplemented with self-reports. It
is possible that some participants were missed from the rec-
ords search even though we obtained a 91% rate of retention.
Third, generalizability of findings may be restricted. Al-
though other programs are supportive of the long-term ben-
efits reported here,10,11,13 the population served in our study
had relatively high levels of economic disadvantage. In addi-
tion, the CPC program has a long history of effectiveness be-
cause of its quality and comprehensiveness, and thus results
may not apply to programs of modest quality.
