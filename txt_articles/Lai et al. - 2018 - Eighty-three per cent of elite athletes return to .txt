AbstrAct
Objectives The primary objective was to calculate the 
rate of return to sport (RTS) following anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) reconstruction in elite athletes. Secondary 
objectives were to estimate the time taken to RTS, 
calculate rates of ACL graft rupture, evaluate postsurgical 
athletic performance and identify determinants of RTS.
Design Pooled RTS and graft rupture rates were 
calculated using random effects proportion meta-
analysis. Time to RTS, performance data and 
determinants of RTS were synthesised descriptively.
Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, 
AMI, PEDro, SPORTDiscus and The Cochrane Library 
were searched from inception to 19 January 2016. Hand 
searching of 10 sports medicine journals and reference 
checking were also performed.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies 
were included if they reported the ratio of elite athletes 
who returned to their preinjury level of sport following 
ACL reconstruction. Twenty-four studies were included.
results The pooled RTS rate was 83% (95% CI 77% 
to 88%). The mean time to RTS ranged from 6 to 
13 months. The pooled graft rupture rate was 5.2% 
(95% CI 2.8% to 8.3%). Six out of nine studies that 
included a noninjured control group found no significant 
deterioration in athletic performance following ACL 
reconstruction. Indicators of greater athletic skill or value 
to the team were associated with RTS.
summary and conclusions Eighty-three per cent 
of elite athletes returned to sport following ACL 
reconstruction, while 5.2% sustained a graft rupture. 
Most athletes who returned to sport performed 
comparably with matched, uninjured controls. This 
information may assist in guiding expectations of 
athletes and clinicians following ACL reconstruction.
IntrODuctIOn
Athletes who sustain an anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL) rupture often undergo surgical reconstruc-
tion to facilitate their return to sport.1–3 However, 
a previous systematic review reported that only 
60% of nonelite athletes returned to their prein-
jury level of sport after ACL reconstruction.4 Elite 
athletes were analysed as a subgroup rather than 
being the focus of that systematic review, and addi-
tional studies of elite athletes who have undergone 
ACL reconstruction have since been published. 
Important physical,5–8 psychological9 and social10 
differences between elite and nonelite athletes might 
give elite athletes a greater chance of returning to 
sport following ACL reconstruction compared with 
nonelite athletes.
The primary aim of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis was to determine the rate of return 
to the preinjury level of sport following ACL recon-
struction among elite athletes. The secondary aims 
were to assess how long elite athletes took to return 
to sport, determine the rate of ACL graft rupture 
among the elite athlete cohort, evaluate athletic 
performance after ACL reconstruction and iden-
tify potential determinants of returning to sport. 
Further understanding of these outcomes may assist

Key messages
What is already known about the subject?
 
► Athletes who sustain an ACL rupture often 
undergo surgical reconstruction to facilitate 
their return to sport.
 
► In recent years, more studies of ACL 
reconstruction outcomes have reported the 
rates of return to sport, which are lower than 
previously assumed, and further studies focused 
on elite level athletes and their return to 
sport following ACL reconstruction have been 
published.
 
► Little is known about why some elite level 
athletes do not return to sport or about the 
outcomes of those elite athletes who do return 
to sport.
What are the new findings?
 
► The return to sport rate among elite athletes 
following ACL reconstruction was 83%, and the 
graft rupture rate was 5.2%.
 
► Most elite athletes took between 6 and 13 
months to return to sport, which is less time 
than what has previously been reported among 
nonelite athletes.
 
► Although athletic performance among elite 
athletes who returned to sport after ACL 
reconstruction often deteriorated compared 
with preinjury levels, their performance 
generally remained comparable with that of 
elite athletes who had not sustained an ACL 
injury.

systematic review
athletes and clinicians to form realistic goals and expectations 
following ACL reconstruction.
MEthODs
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines11 were followed in 
preparing, conducting and reporting this systematic review.
search strategy
The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, 
CINAHL, AMI, PEDro, SPORTDiscus and The Cochrane 
Library were searched from inception to 19 January 2016. 
Search terms were entered under two concepts; terms within 
each concept were combined with the OR Boolean operator, 
and the two concepts were combined with the AND Boolean 
operator. Where possible, terms were mapped to medical subject 
headings and searched using keywords. Examples of terms 
in concept 1 included ‘anterior cruciate ligament’, ‘anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction’ and ‘ACL’. Examples of terms 
in concept 2 included ‘sport’, ‘athlete’, ‘physical activity’, ‘return 
to sport’ and ‘sport re-entry’. An example of a database search as 
applied to MEDLINE is provided in Supplementary file 1.
To supplement the database searches, we hand searched the 
online contents pages and ‘Articles in Press’ lists of The Amer-
ican Journal of Sports Medicine; British Journal of Sports Medi-
cine; Arthroscopy; The Knee; Knee Surgery, Sports T
raumatology, 
Arthroscopy; The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Phys-
ical Therapy; Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport; Sports 
Health; Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine; and Open 
Access Journal of Sports Medicine. Studies in the reference lists 
of the included studies were also screened.
selection criteria
Studies of interventional or observational design were included 
if they reported, in English language, the number or ratio of 
participants who returned to their preinjury level of sport, in a 
consecutively recruited cohort of at least 10 elite athletes who 
had undergone ACL reconstruction. Elite athletes were defined 
as people playing sport professionally, or at the highest possible 
competitive level for their sport, or in Division I of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association.
Conference proceedings and review studies were excluded 
because of the risk of duplicating data. Studies that included only 
participants who had undergone revision ACL reconstruction or 
ACL reconstruction combined with high tibial osteotomy were 
also excluded.
T
wo reviewers independently applied the selection criteria to 
the studies. The reviewers first screened the titles and abstracts 
of studies identified by the search strategy. Studies that either 
clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria or had at least one 
exclusion criterion were excluded. The full-text versions of the 
remaining studies were then retrieved, and the selection criteria 
were applied independently by the reviewers. Any discrepancies 
were discussed, and a third reviewer was consulted if consensus 
could not be reached. If additional information was required to 
decide whether a study should be included, attempts were made 
to contact the authors of the study.
risk of bias assessment
A six-item checklist12 was used to assess the risk of bias in included 
studies for this systematic review. The items assessed were 
selection criteria described, representative population selected, 
participants’ preinjury sports participation level reported, data 
collected prospectively, demographic data reported and postop-
erative sports participation level compared with preinjury level. 
In addition, the level of evidence for each study in addressing 
the primary aim of this review was graded.13 For each included 
study, two reviewers independently assessed and recorded the 
number of checklist items fulfilled and the level of evidence. Any 
discrepancies were resolved through discussion; a third reviewer 
was consulted if consensus could not be reached. The risk of bias 
assessment was not used in weighting for meta-analysis.
Data extraction and synthesis
T
wo reviewers independently extracted data from each study. 
Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If further clar-
ification of data was required, contact with the authors of the 
respective studies was attempted.
‘Return to sport’ was treated as a dichotomous outcome and 
defined as playing at least one match or competing in at least one 
event following ACL reconstruction at the preinjury or higher 
level of competition. The return to sport rate was calculated 
from the number of elite athletes who returned to sport, out of 
the number of elite athletes who underwent ACL reconstruction, 
and expressed as a percentage. If a study defined ‘return to sport’ 
or derived a return to sport rate in a different manner, and if 
enough data were available, the return to sport rate was recalcu-
lated to meet the definition used in this review.
Where available, rates of ACL graft rupture were calculated 
from the number of elite athletes who sustained ACL graft 
rupture out of the number of elite athletes who initially under-
went ACL reconstruction, and expressed as a percentage.
The sports and competitions played by participants were 
extracted from each study. Where three or more studies of the 
same sport reported return to sport rates or graft rupture rates, 
subgroup analyses were performed for those sports.
Further data that were extracted from each study included the 
mean time taken for athletes to return to sport following ACL 
reconstruction, athletic performance measures of elite athletes 
who had undergone ACL reconstruction and matched control 
groups of elite athletes without ACL injury, and determinants 
of returning to sport following ACL reconstruction. These data 
were synthesised descriptively.
Pooled rates of return to sport and ACL graft rupture were 
calculated using random effects proportion meta-analysis (Stats-
Direct, V
.2.8; Altrincham, UK). Heterogeneity was assessed 
using the I2 statistic14 and interpreted according to the guide-
lines published by The Cochrane Collaboration.15 Funnel plots 
were used to evaluate bias in the results of the meta-analyses, and 
funnel plot asymmetry was quantified with the Harbord test.16
rEsults
study selection
The literature search identified 2844 potentially eligible studies 
for screening; 2502 were excluded after reviewing the titles and 
abstracts. The full-text versions of the remaining 342 studies 
were obtained, of which 318 were subsequently excluded. The 
remaining 24 studies, which included 1272 elite athletes, met 
the inclusion criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis 
(figure 1).

studies (25%) collected data prospectively,20 26 28 34 35 40 and demo-
graphic data were reported in 15 studies (63%).18 19 22–24 27 28 32–39 
All of the studies compared postoperative activity levels with 
preinjury levels. With respect to addressing the primary aim of 
this systematic review, all of the included studies were graded as 
level 4 evidence (table 1).
sports studied
Eighteen studies reported on a cohort of elite athletes from a 
single sport. Nine of these studies included football players of 
various codes: four were of soccer players,23 34 35 39 four were of 
American football players19 21 33 38 and one was of rugby players.40 
Three studies were of basketball players,18 27 32 and two studies 
were of ice hockey players.22 37 T
wo studies included snow sports 
athletes: one study was of alpine skiers,36 and one study was of 
freestyle skiers and snowboarders.24 One study was of baseball 
players,25 and one study was of handball players.31 Three studies 
included participants from various sports,17 28 29 while three 
studies did not report which sports participants played20 26 30 
(table 1).
return to sport rates
The pooled rate of return to sport following ACL reconstruc-
tion in elite athletes (n=1272) was 83% (95% 
CI 77% to 88%; 
I2=86%; Harbord test=−1.98, 92.5% 
CI −4.76 to 0.80; 
figure 2). Among elite soccer players (n=220), the return to 
sport rate was 85% (95% 
CI 78% to 90%; I2=36%; Harbord 
test=1.93, 92.5% 
CI −9.40 to 13.27; Supplementary file 2). 
Among elite American football players (n=279), the return to 
sport rate was 78% (95% 
CI 67% to 87%; I2=65%; Harbord 
test=−0.54, 92.5% 
CI −8.95 to 7.87; Supplementary file 3). 
Among elite basketball players (n=103), the return to sport rate 
was 82% (95% 
CI 74% to 89%; I2=0%; Harbord test=−2.47, 
92.5% 
CI −9.97 to 5.04; Supplementary file 4).
time taken to return to sport
Fifteen studies provided data on the duration taken for athletes 
to return to their preinjury level of sport (table 1). One study 
reported that all participants returned to sport within 6 months.40 
Six studies reported mean times of 6–9 months,20–22 34 35 39 six 
studies reported mean times of 9–12 months,18 23 27 32 33 37 and 
two studies reported mean times of 12–13 months.19 38
On average, soccer players returned to sport between 6 
and 10.2 months postoperatively,23 34 35 39 American football 
players returned to sport between 8.2 and 13 months postop-
eratively19 21 33 38 and rugby players returned to sport within 6 
months of ACL reconstruction.40 Basketball players returned to 
sport, on average, between 10.7 and 11.8 months postopera-
tively.18 27 32 Ice hockey players returned to sport, on average, 
between 7.8 and 9.8 months postoperatively.22 37
Graft rupture rates
Fourteen of the included studies reported a graft rupture rate 
(table 1). The pooled graft rupture rate was 5.2% (95%

CI 
−3.85 to 2.70; figure 3). Three studies of elite soccer players 
reported graft rupture rates. The pooled graft rupture rate in 
elite soccer players was 5.6% (95% 
CI 2.5% to 9.9%; I2=0%; 
Harbord test=0.64, 92.5% 
CI −23.16 to 24.44; Supplementary 
file 5). Only two studies of American football players and two 
studies of elite basketball players provided graft rupture rates, so 
subgroup analyses were not performed.
Athletic performance on return to sport
Eleven studies compared athletes’ preinjury and postsur-
gery performances (table 2). Seven of these studies measured 
overall athletic performance using the following: the number 
of competition medals won by alpine skiers36 and freestyle 
skiers and snowboarders,24 International Ski Federation (FIS) 
rankings and points for alpine skiers,36 the number of All-Star 
team selections for National Basketball Association (NBA)27 
and National Hockey League (NHL)37 players and formu-
lated ratings for players in the NBA18 and the National Foot-
ball League (NFL).19 38 Eight studies measured performance 
with various individual statistics, including games played per 
season,18 22 23 25 27 32 37 38 touchdown passes made by NFL quar-
terbacks,38 goals scored by soccer23 and ice hockey players,22 37 
home runs scored by baseball players25 and shooting percentages 
among basketball players.18 27 32 Nine of the 11 studies selected 
a control group of elite athletes who had not sustained an ACL 
injury but were matched to the ACL reconstruction study group 
on characteristics, including age, body mass index and amount 
of playing experience18 22 23 27 32 37 38; national team selection36; 
preinjury playing performance18 22 23 37 38; and playing posi-
tion.22 23 27 32 38
Erickson et al23 reported that the performance of Major 
League Soccer (MLS) players did not deteriorate significantly 
following ACL reconstruction, while they attempted more shots 
at goal and made more assists per season than matched controls. 
Among NFL players, the study of running backs and wide 
receivers found that those returning after ACL reconstruction 
had lower power ratings compared with their preinjury levels 
and those of matched controls,19 while the study of quarterbacks 
did not report any significant deterioration in performance post-
surgery compared with either their preinjury performance or the 
performance of matched controls.38
The three studies of elite basketball players each reported 
that players’ postsurgery performance deteriorated compared 
with preinjury performance on measures including player effi-
ciency rating,18 number of All-Star selections,27 games played per 
season,18 27 shooting percentage,18 27 32 points and rebounds per 
game27 and steals per game.32 However, elite basketball players’ 
performance did not decline significantly compared with those 
of matched controls,18 32 except Harris et al27 reported that 
players returning from ACL reconstruction played fewer games 
per season.
The two studies of NHL players had conflicting results. Sikka 
et al37 found that forwards and wings who underwent ACL 
reconstruction did not return to their preinjury level of perfor-
mance and did not perform as well as players in the control 
group, while defenders improved their plus-minus rating in their 
second season after returning to sport and performed compa-
rably with players in the control group. Erickson et al22 reported 
that performance did not deteriorate after ACL reconstruction, 
and some performance measures improved compared with those 
of the control group.
As a cohort, X-Games freestyle skiers and snowboarders won 
more medals after surgery than they did preinjury.24 Members 
of the French national alpine skiing team who underwent ACL 
reconstruction won more medals per race and improved their FIS 
rankings and points after surgery.36 After ACL reconstruction, 
elite baseball players played fewer games per season compared 
with their preinjury levels.25
Determinants of returning to sport and preinjury performance
Six studies analysed player-related factors possibly associated 
with a return to sport and preinjury levels of performance. 
Surrogate measures indicative of greater levels of athletic skill or 
value to an elite sporting team, including being selected earlier 
in the NFL draft,33 being on a college sporting scholarship21 39 or 
having a higher depth chart position (players who started games 
on field were positioned highest and players who rarely played 
games were positioned lowest),21 were associated with higher 
rates of return to sport. NHL players with more goals or assists 
in the season preceding ACL injury were more likely to return to 
their previous level of performance.37
T
wo studies found that more preinjury playing experience was 
associated with a higher rate of return to sport.21 33 However,

systematic review
college athletes injured during their fourth or fifth years at 
college were less likely to return to sport,21 39 and NHL players 
injured after turning 30 years of age were less likely to return 
to play at least one full season.37 French alpine skiers who were 
younger at the time of injury were more likely to improve their 
performance after returning to sport.36 Playing position was 
not a significant determinant of returning to sport in American 
football,33 women’s basketball32 or women’s college soccer,39 
but Sikka et al37 found that NHL defenders were more likely 
to return to their previous level of performance than forwards 
and wings.
Nine studies reported on the influence of surgical factors on 
return to sport. Concomitant injuries to menisci were associated 
with shorter careers among NHL players,37 but no other studies 
found that concomitant injuries significantly affected return to 
sport rates.18 21 29 39 Daruwalla et al21 found that autografts were 
associated with higher rates of return to sport than allografts, 
but two other studies did not find any significant association 
between graft types and return to sport rates39 or postsurgery 
performance.37 Among elite baseball players, ACL reconstruction 
to the rear batting leg was associated with decreased batting 
average on return to sport.25 The timing of surgery,30 tunnel 
drilling technique21 26 39 or graft fixation method21 28 39 did not 
significantly affect return to sport rates among elite athletes.
DIscussIOn
return to sport rates
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that 
83% of elite athletes returned to their preinjury level of sport 
following ACL reconstruction. This finding is consistent with 
previously published rates4 and incorporates additional data 
from 11 recent studies. It confirms that rates of return to the 
preinjury level of sport following ACL reconstruction are higher 
among elite athletes (83%, 95% 
CI 77% to 88%) than among 
nonelite athletes (60%, 95% 
CI 53% to 67%).4 A combination 
of factors, including elite athletes having superior athletic skill,5 
levels of physical fitness7 and knee proprioception,6 8 different 
psychological profiles,9 ready access to high-quality healthcare10 
and greater financial incentives to play than nonelite athletes

systematic review
might help to explain why elite athletes have a higher rate of 
return to sport.
Conversely, nearly one out of every five elite athletes who 
undergo ACL reconstruction does not return to sport, which 
remains below the expectations of patients undergoing ACL 
reconstruction41 and their clinicians.42 Our results may help elite 
athletes who undergo ACL reconstruction, and clinicians who 
work with elite athletes, to have realistic expectations and goals 
for surgery and rehabilitation.
time taken to return to sport
Rehabilitation following ACL reconstruction surgery is a compli-
cated process, and the time from surgery should not be the 
only factor used to determine when a return to sport should be 
allowed.43 44 The average time between ACL reconstruction and 
return to sport may, however, help to guide goal setting for elite 
athletes and clinicians. Among the 15 studies that reported these 
data, only two studies of American football players19 38 reported 
that elite athletes took longer than 12 months on average to 
return to sport. T
wo other studies of American football players 
included in this review reported mean times of 8.2 months21 and 
10.8 months21 to return to sport. There are currently insuffi-
cient data to confirm whether or not elite athletes from different 
sports take substantially different amounts of time to return to 
sport.
The majority of studies in this review reported that elite athletes 
returned to sport on average within 12 months. This is consider-
ably shorter than what has previously been reported in the none-
lite population.45 In our review, it was not possible to determine 
whether there was any correlation between the amount of time 
taken to return to sport and graft rupture rates. Although elite 
athletes appear to return to sport earlier than nonelite athletes,45 
whether this approach is safe remains uncertain.
Graft rupture rates
ACL graft rupture is a traumatic and career-threatening event 
for elite athletes. Elite athletes and clinicians should be aware 
of the rate of ACL graft rupture when considering the risks and 
benefits of returning to sport. The pooled graft rupture rate 
was 5.2% (95% 
CI 2.8% to 8.3%), which is comparable with a 
previous meta-analysis of six primary studies of nonelite athletes 
that reported a graft rupture rate of 5.8%.46 It is important to 
recognise that the graft rupture rate in this review may be under-
estimated though, as six of the 14 studies that reported graft 
rupture rates gathered data from the public domain,22–24 27 32 38 
and not all athletes were followed up for the duration of their 
careers. This graft rupture rate was calculated from studies that 
met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, so there may 
be studies of elite athletes following ACL reconstruction that 
did not report return to sport rates but did report graft rupture 
rates. Any such studies have not been included in this meta-anal-
ysis. In addition, we were not able to calculate an annualised 
graft rupture rate because the majority of included studies that 
reported graft rupture rates did not report the average duration 
of follow-up.
Athletic performance on return to sport
Feucht et al reported that 94% of patients who were about to 
undergo primary ACL reconstruction expected to return to sport 
with only slight or no restrictions.41 It is reasonable to specu-
late that most elite athletes who undergo ACL reconstruction

systematic review
would expect to return not only to their preinjury level of sport 
but also to their preinjury level of performance. Returning to 
preinjury levels of performance can be considered as a further 
stage of progress following a return to playing at the preinjury 
level of sport.47 The concept of studying athletic performance 
on returning to sport from ACL reconstruction is relatively new 
and under-researched. Eleven studies in this systematic review 
attempted to compare preinjury and postsurgery athletic perfor-
mance, and all of them have been published since 2006.
We found conflicting results regarding elite athletes’ perfor-
mance on their return to sport. Five studies reported that post-
surgery performance was unchanged22 23 38 or improved24 36 
compared with preinjury performance, while six studies reported 
that performance deteriorated after surgery.18 19 25 27 32 37 Differing 
methods of identifying participants might account for some of 
these discrepancies: for example, Erickson et al22 used data that 
were available in the public domain, while Sikka et al37 accessed 
a competition-wide injury surveillance system. Even though the 
studies that used data available in the public domain described 
thorough search strategies for identifying elite athletes who 
underwent ACL reconstruction, accessing a database of injuries 
prospectively collated and maintained by the sporting organisa-
tion is likely to be a more reliable source of injury data.
To control for the dynamic nature of elite sport and the 
progression of time, nine studies used a matched control group 
with which to compare the study groups’ performances. Encour-
agingly, six of the nine studies did not demonstrate any signifi-
cant deterioration in postsurgery performances when compared 
with the control groups’ performances.18 22 23 32 34 38 In many 
cases, deterioration in athletic performance following ACL 
reconstruction may be explained by the progression of time, 
rather than the result of ACL reconstruction.

systematic review
Due to the limited number of studies available for each 
sport, the wide variety of methods used to measure athletic 
performance and the conflicting results between some studies, 
the synthesis of athletic performance data was challenging. As 
further studies explore the concept of returning to preinjury 
performance following ACL reconstruction, it may become 
possible to reach stronger conclusions to assist athletes and clini-
cians. It would be useful for future studies to assess the longevity 
of elite athletes’ careers following ACL reconstruction. In addi-
tion, the increasing use of global positioning systems in sport 
may offer an avenue to measure performance and load in elite 
athletes following ACL reconstruction.47
Determinants of returning to sport and preinjury performance
Several studies identified that indicators of greater athletic skill 
or value to an elite sporting team were determinants of returning 
to sport. The findings on age and experience were less consistent, 
but it is possible that even if elite athletes with greater experience 
are more likely to return to sport, younger elite athletes who 
return to sport may be more likely to sustain improved athletic 
performance after ACL reconstruction.
While only one of the included studies found that the presence 
of concomitant injuries was associated with shortened career 
length, this may be explained by inadequate power contained 
within each study. The use of autografts was associated with 
higher rates of return to sport than the use of allografts in 
one study,21 but no other surgical factors were associated with 
different rates of return to sport. This corroborates previous 
systematic reviews that have not found substantial differences in 
clinical outcomes following the use of autografts compared with 
allografts.48–50 There does not appear to be enough evidence to 
suggest that any one graft choice would increase return to sport 
rates among elite athletes.
Positive psychological responses to injuries,51 including 
ACL injuries,52 53 are determinants of returning to sport in the 
general athletic population. None of the studies included in this 
systematic review focused on the psychological determinants 
of returning to sport among elite athletes, and this may be an 
avenue for further research.
General limitations
The overall return to sport rate of 83% should be interpreted 
with some caution. There was substantial statistical heteroge-
neity across the studies (I2=86%), which may be explained by 
several factors. There was a broad time frame covered across the 
studies, with elite athletes from as early as 1975 through to 2013 
being included. Various methods of identifying and recruiting 
elite athletes were used across studies, and the rate of return to 
sport may be affected by the type of sport played. The inconsis-
tent lengths of follow-up across studies may have affected the 
calculations of pooled return to sport and graft rupture rates. 
Therefore, it is important that future studies specify the duration 
of follow-up.
There was also a risk of bias identified in several studies. 
Nine studies did not report the demographic characteristics 
of included athletes, which may limit the external validity and 
generalisability of this meta-analysis. Only six of the included 
studies collected data prospectively, which introduces a risk of 
recall bias. However, this risk is expected to be low given that 
return to sport is usually a highly anticipated and memorable 
event following major injury. Eight studies collected data exclu-
sively from the public domain,19 22–25 27 32 38 and although the 
described search methods were comprehensive, it is likely that 
some ACL injury and return to sport data may have been missed. 
Although the risk of bias assessment checklist used in this study 
has been used in previous systematic reviews,4 12 it has not been 
validated as a mechanism to weight studies in meta-analysis.
All of the studies included in this review were level 4 evidence. 
We expect that that the majority of future studies in the elite 
athlete population will also be of observational design. While 
the quality of findings from this review may be weakened by the 
lack of interventional studies on elite athletes who sustain ACL 
rupture, this review does address the aims of the study as best as 
possible in the elite athlete context.
Publication bias54 may have led to overestimation of return to 
sport rates and underestimation of graft rupture rates. However, 
none of the Harbord tests performed were statistically signifi-
cant at the 92.5% CI. This indicates that publication bias may 
not have been a significant issue in this meta-analysis, although 
the substantial heterogeneity present between individual studies 
limits the interpretation of the Harbord tests.15
There is a relative paucity of research on return to sport 
rates in the elite female athlete population following ACL 
reconstruction, even though female athletes face a greater risk 
of ACL rupture when participating in the same sports as male 
athletes.55 56 Only two studies included in our review reported 
on a female-only cohort,32 39 while 13 studies reported on a male-
only cohort of elite athletes18 19 21–23 25 27 28 33 35 37 38 40 and most 
of the remaining studies did not detail the number of male and 
female elite athletes who returned to sport. These factors meant 
that we could not determine whether outcomes differed between 
male and female elite athletes who underwent ACL reconstruc-
tion. Our results should not be generalised to elite athletes who 
have had revision ACL reconstruction, as studies of revision ACL 
reconstruction were excluded from this meta-analysis, and the 
outcomes of revision ACL reconstruction, including return to 
sport rates, are generally inferior compared with primary ACL 
reconstruction.57 58 However, our meta-analysis does represent 
the best available estimate of return to sport rates in elite athletes 
who undergo ACL reconstruction, given that it is based on 1272 
elite athletes across 24 studies.
cOnclusIOn
The rate of return to preinjury level of sport following ACL 
reconstruction among elite athletes was 83%, and most of those 
who returned to sport played their first game between 6 and 13 
months after surgery. Elite athletes with greater levels of athletic 
skill may be more likely to return to their preinjury level of 
sport. Five per cent of elite athletes who underwent ACL recon-
struction sustained a graft rupture. The performance of elite 
athletes who returned to sport following ACL reconstruction 
was comparable with the performance of matched cohorts of 
elite athletes who had not undergone ACL reconstruction. These 
results may be used by athletes and their treating clinicians to 
guide realistic expectations regarding return to sport following 
ACL reconstruction.

systematic review
Elite athletes place greater demands on their knees than nonelite athletes, so it is 
unlikely that being in an elite sporting environment would have increased Jessica’s 
odds of returning to sport. (b) Even though nearly one out of five elite athletes who 
undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction never return to their previous level 
of sport, elite athletes have a greater chance of returning to their preinjury level 
of sport than nonelite athletes. (c) Physical attributes alone explain the differing 
return to sport rates between elite and nonelite athletes following anterior cruciate 
ligament reconstruction. (d) Jessica would have been more likely to return to sport 
if she were playing soccer or football instead of netball. Answer: (b) This meta-
analysis found that 83% of elite athletes return to their preinjury level of sport, 
which is higher than previously reported rates in nonelite athletes. 2. John Smith is 
a 24-year-old male professional rugby player who plays at the fullback position. He 
sustained a direct contact injury to his right knee while being tackled in a match 
and was subsequently diagnosed with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament and a 
lateral meniscal tear. Having undergone an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
with a hamstrings tendon autograft together with a repair of his lateral meniscus, 
which of the following statements is true? (a) The presence of a concomitant 
injury to his medial meniscus will substantially reduce John’s chances of returning 
to professional rugby. (b) There is currently strong evidence to suggest that John, 
being a fullback, John is more likely to return to sport than a forward would be if 
they were to sustain a similar injury. (c) The hamstrings tendon autograft is a better 
choice than the bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft for elite athletes due to the 
lower incidence of donor site complications. (d) If John sustained this injury as a 
20-year-old, with less professional rugby experience, he would have been less likely 
to return to professional rugby. Answer: (d) The majority of studies in this systematic 
review did not find that concomitant meniscal injuries, playing position or graft 
choices were strongly associated with different return to sport rates. Two studies 
of elite football players of various codes found that greater playing experience 
was associated with a higher rate of return to sport. 3. Jack Watson is a 28-year-
old male professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association. He 
sustained a left anterior cruciate ligament injury while changing direction 12 months 
ago. Prior to his injury, he was an All-Star guard. His career is about to resume. 
Which of the following statements regarding his upcoming performances is most 
likely to be true? (a) Given that Jack has taken a full 12 months to return to sport, 
Jack is likely to return to his preinjury levels of performance within one season on 
measures including games played per season and shooting percentage. (b) Very 
few elite basketball players ever regain their preinjury level of form and Jack should 
learn to play different roles within the team immediately in order to continue his 
career. (c) Jack will find it challenging to add to his previous All-Star selection, but 
if he can remain on the court, his career trajectory is likely to remain comparable to 
players with similar experience and playing characteristics. (d) Guards return to their 
preinjury level of form more frequently than forwards and centres in the National 
Basketball Association. Answer: (c) Studies of elite basketball players have reported 
that players returning to sport following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 
on average, do not return to preinjury levels of performance, but these declines are 
not statistically significant compared with matched control groups. 4. Which of the 
following rates is closest to the risk of a graft rupture across a career for an elite 
athlete? (a) One in 50(2%). (b) One in 20(5%). (c) One in five (20%). (d) One in two 
(50%). Answer: (b) The pooled graft rupture rate in elite athletes following anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction was 5.2%. 5. The Australian Rules football season 
is typically between April and September. Peter Wood is a 23-year-old professional 
Australian Rules football player who sustained an isolated anterior cruciate ligament 
injury early in April. Mark’s 25-year-old brother, Andrew, who plays in an amateur 
nonelite competition, sustained a similar injury one week earlier. Both have elected 
to undergo ACL reconstruction with hamstrings tendon autografts, and they aim to 
returning to sport. Which of the following statements is most likely to be correct? 
(a) Peter is more likely to return to sport, and a realistic goal is to be ready to play 
early in the next season. (b) Peter is more likely to return to sport, and he is a good 
chance of playing in the finals in September if he undergoes surgery immediately. (c) 
Peter is more likely to return to sport, but it is unlikely that he will return until late in 
the following season (ie, approximately 15 months out of sport).(d) Andrew is likely 
to return to sport earlier than his brother because the lower demands of amateur 
Australian football allow athletes to return to sport earlier on average than those in 
the high-demand elite environment. Answer: (a) Elite athletes return to sport more 
frequently than nonelite athletes, and the majority of studies have reported that elite 
athletes take between 6 and 13 months on average to return to sport.
