increase access to transplantation for patients with longer dialysis exposure. The objective of this study was to
determine the association of transplantation with survival in patients with $10 years of dialysis treatment.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements Our study of n=5365 patients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients determined the adjusted relative risk of death in recipients of a deceased donor kidney transplant after
$10 years of dialysis treatment compared with waitlisted patients with the same dialysis exposure in a time-
dependent nonproportional hazards analysis.
Results The adjusted relative risk of death in n=2320 transplant recipients compared with patients on dialysis who
had equal lengths of follow-up from their 10-year dialysis anniversary was 0.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.53 to
0.68), and this benefit was observed in a variety of patient subgroups, including patients $65 years of age
and patients with diabetes. However, transplant recipients were at higher risk of death for 180 days after
transplantation and did not derive survival benefit until 657 days after transplantation, despite receiving good-
quality kidneys. The study patients were younger and had higher expected post-transplant survival than patients
currently waitlisted with $10 years of dialysis.
Conclusions Transplantation is associated with better survival in patients who were actively waitlisted with
dialysis exposure $10 years. Whether transplantation is associated with better survival in currently waitlisted
patients with similar dialysis exposure and whether transplantation of lower-quality deceased donor kidneys is
associated with better survival are uncertain.

Introduction
Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for
patients with ESRD, because it is associated with
better survival, better quality of life, and lower use
of health care resources compared with treatment
with dialysis (1–3). The better survival associated with
kidney transplantation compared with treatment with
dialysis extends to patients of advanced age and
patients with comorbid disease conditions, such as
diabetes and cardiovascular disease, leading to an
increased need for this treatment that has outpaced
increases in the availability of deceased donor kidneys
(1,4). The resulting discrepancy between the need and
supply of transplantable kidneys remains the domi-
nant issue in kidney transplantation, with the recent
national data showing a threefold increase in the
number of patients removed from the waiting list
because of deteriorating health status between 2010
and 2015 (5). Currently, 13% of the nearly 10,000
waitlisted kidney transplant candidates in the United
States have had ESRD for .11 years (5).
Patients with prolonged exposure to dialysis
before transplantation are known to have inferior
post-transplant outcomes (6–8). However, most of the
information regarding the association of kidney
transplantation with better survival is derived from
studies during an era in which patients received
transplants relatively rapidly, typically within the
first few years after the development of ESRD (1,4).
Therefore, whether patients in the current era who
receive transplants after prolonged treatment with
dialysis continue to derive a similar survival benefit
remains uncertain.
Recent changes to the kidney allocation system
(KAS) have increased access to transplantation for
patients with longer durations of pretransplant di-
alysis exposure. Specifically, in the new KAS, waiting
time among patients not waitlisted before the initiation
of dialysis is now calculated from the date of first
chronic dialysis treatment rather than the date of
waitlist activation (9). This policy change presents an
opportunity to consider the option of transplantation
in patients who have not accessed transplantation and
have been treated with dialysis for prolonged periods
of time. If referred and waitlisted for transplantation,
these patients would be backdated to their initial

 dialysis start date, and many would rapidly receive de-
ceased donor transplants ahead of currently waitlisted
patients with shorter durations of dialysis treatment (10).
We hypothesized that transplantation may not be associ-
ated with better survival in patients who have prolonged
exposure to dialysis because of a survivor effect and the fact
that longer pretransplant dialysis exposure is associated
with a higher increased risk of allograft failure (6–8).
Accordingly, we undertook this study to determine the
association of deceased donor kidney transplantation with
survival in a cohort of patients with prolonged dialysis
exposure defined as $10 years.
Materials and Methods
Our local hospital research ethics board approved this
study. The clinical and research activities being reported
are consistent with the principles of the Declaration of
Istanbul as outlined in the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ
Trafficking and Transplant Tourism.
Data Source and Study Population
Data from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) and the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) were
used for this analysis. The SRTR data system includes data
on all donors, waitlisted candidates, and transplant recip-
ients in the United States submitted by the members of the
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).
The Health Resources and Services Administration, US
Department of Health and Human Services provides over-
sight of the activities of the OPTN and the SRTR contractors.
The study population included patients with ESRD ($18
years old) with a 10-year dialysis anniversary between
January 1, 2005 and November 30, 2011. This time period
was chosen to allow for a minimum of 5 years of potential
follow-up after the 10-year dialysis anniversary in all
patients (the last date of follow-up in study data files
was November 30, 2016). The final study cohort of 5365
patients was identified after excluding patients $70 years
of age, in whom transplantation remains infrequent,
patients who were never waitlisted before their 10-year
dialysis anniversary or during study follow-up, waitlisted
patients who were permanently removed from the waiting
list before their 10-year dialysis anniversary, and patients
who were waitlisted in inactive status but never activated
to the waiting list before the end of study follow-up
(November 30, 2016) as shown in Figure 1.
Statistical Methods
Characteristics of study patients were described using
the median and quartiles for continuous variables or
frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. The
characteristics of study patients were compared with those
of waitlisted patients with $10 years of dialysis exposure
on November 30, 2016 (the most recent waitlist data in our
SRTR files) using the chi-squared and Kruskal–Wallis test
as appropriate. The expected post-transplant survival
(EPTS) of study patients was calculated at the time of
the 10-year dialysis anniversary in study patients and
comparator patients currently waitlisted. The EPTS score is
calculated using four variables (age, prior organ transplant,
diabetic status, and dialysis time), and the scores range
from 0% to 100% (11). The score represents the percentage
of transplant candidates in the reference population (all
adult patients on the waiting list on December 31, 2015)
with a higher post-transplant survival. Therefore, lower
scores are associated with a higher EPTS. The kidney donor
profile index (KDPI) was determined by calculating the ten-
variable Kidney Donor Risk Index. Cutpoints for KDPI
quartiles were based on the standardized 2015 Kidney Donor
Risk Index values of deceased kidney donors recovered for
transplantation (12).
Survival Analyses
Patients were followed from the date of their 10-year
dialysis anniversary to the date of death or end of study
follow-up, with follow-up censored at the time of trans-
plantation from a living donor. The primary analysis was
designed as intention to treat and did not censor patients in
the event of removal from the waiting list or allograft
failure. A secondary analysis, censored patients at the time
of waitlist removal. The cumulative 5-year patient survival
from the date of the 10-year dialysis anniversary was
determined using the Kaplan–Meier method. Death rates
per 100 patient-years were determined during dialysis
treatment and after transplantation in all patients and
subgroups defined by EPTS determined on each patient’s
10-year dialysis anniversary. The primary study outcome
was the relative risk of death in recipients of a deceased
donor transplant compared with waitlisted patients with
the same duration of dialysis treatment who remained on
the waiting list. The primary outcome was determined
using a nonproportional hazards model. The model treated
deceased donor transplantation as a time-dependent co-
variate to account for the fact that patients switched
from dialysis to transplantation at different times during

 follow-up. We calculated the number of days remaining on
dialysis until equal death rates were observed between
patients who did and did not receive a transplant as well as
the number of days until both groups had equal survival as
previously described (1,4,13). Survival models were ad-
justed for variables commonly associated with survival in
waitlisted patients and available in the SRTR dataset:
patient age on their 10-year dialysis anniversary, sex,
race, cause of ESRD, body mass index, comorbid conditions
recorded at the time of waitlisting, peak panel reactive
antibody, and year of first chronic dialysis treatment. The
association of deceased donor transplantation with long-
term survival was determined in subgroups defined by age,
sex, race, diabetes, panel reactive antibody, and EPTS.
Variables with missing data were assigned a category of
missing to allow inclusion of all patients in the models.
Finally, to inform the potential implications of study
findings, a cross-sectional analysis was performed by cause
of ESRD to determine the number and characteristics of
patients ages 18–69 years old who had never received a
transplant and were never waitlisted despite $10 years of
continuous dialysis treatment on September 9, 2015 (the
latest date included in our USRDS data files).
All analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC).
Results
The study cohort included n=5365 adult patients on
dialysis activated to the deceased donor transplant waiting
list before (n=1038) or after (n=4327) their 10-year dialysis
anniversary (Figure 1). Among patients waitlisted before
their 10-year dialysis anniversary, the median (Q1-Q3)
time to waitlist activation was 7.2 (5.1–8.8) years. Among
patients waitlisted after their 10-year dialysis anniversary,
the median (Q1,Q3) time to waitlist activation was 12.6
(11.1–14.6) years after the date of first dialysis treatment.
Study patients were younger, were less likely to have
diabetes as the cause of ESRD were less obese, and had
greater EPTS than contemporary waitlisted patients with
the same duration of pretransplant dialysis exposure (Table
1). Study patients were also less likely to have a previous
transplant and had lower panel reactive antibodies. Study
patients had lower median household incomes, were more
likely to be of nonwhite race, and were more likely to have
Medicare insurance than contemporary waitlisted patients
with the same duration of pretransplant dialysis exposure
(Table 1). During the median (Q1,Q3) follow-up of 6.5 (5.0–
8.5) years, n=2320 study patients received a deceased donor
kidney transplant (the median [Q1–Q3] time to transplan-
tation was 2.3 [0.91–4.24] years after the 10-year dialysis
anniversary date). The median (Q1–Q3) KDPI of the
kidneys transplanted was 44% (25–65), and only 6% of
kidneys had a KDPI.85%. There were n=1815 (34%) total
deaths, and the 5-year cumulative survival probability of
the study cohort was 78%. Table 2 shows the death rate per
100 patient-years during treatment with dialysis and after
transplantation. Among dialysis-treated patients, the death
rate increased with increasing durations of dialysis

 treatment after the 10-year dialysis anniversary. In contrast,
the death rate was highest in the first year after trans-
plantation and then decreased with increasing time after
transplantation. The overall death rates before and after
transplantation varied by EPTS, but patients in all EPTS
groups had lower death rates after transplantation.
Figure 2 shows the adjusted relative risk of death among
patients who received a first deceased donor kidney
transplant compared with patients with equivalent
durations of dialysis treatment. Deceased donor trans-
plant recipients were at higher risk of death for a period
of 180 days after the date of transplant surgery and then
had lower risk of death. Because of this higher risk of
death early after transplantation, survival between
transplant recipients and patients who continued treat-
ment with dialysis did not equalize until 657 days after
transplantation.
Table 3 shows that transplant recipients had a 40% lower
long-term risk of death compared with patients who
continued dialysis (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence
interval, 0.53 to 0.68) after adjustment for differences in
patient age, sex, race, cause of kidney disease, body mass
index in kilograms per meter2, comorbid conditions,
sensitization, and year of first chronic dialysis treatment.
Transplantation was consistently associated with lower
risk of death compared with treatment with dialysis in
subgroups defined by age, sex, race, cause of ESRD, sensi-
tization to HLA antigens, and EPTS (Table 3). In a secondary
analysis, in which patient follow-up was censored at the time
of removal from the waiting list, transplantation was still
associated with lower risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95%
confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.86).
There were n=22,169 patients (including 64% under the
age of 60 years old and 27% with diabetes as the cause of
ESRD) recorded in the USRDS data files who had never
been waitlisted or received a transplant despite $10 years
of dialysis treatment who may be eligible for deceased
donor kidney transplantation as of September 9, 2015
(Table 4). Patients with diabetes as the cause of ESRD were
older, were more likely to be men and white non-Hispanic,
and had more comorbidities than patients with other
causes of ESRD.
Discussion
Given the scarcity of transplantable kidneys, examina-
tion of the rationale for considering different patient
subgroups for transplantation is a relevant clinical and
policy issue. Improving the survival of patients with ESRD
is the most compelling reason to treat patients with kidney
transplantation rather than dialysis (2). Prolonged exposure
to dialysis is associated with lower patient and allograft
survival (6–8), and to our knowledge, previous work has
not documented the survival benefit of transplantation in
patients with prolonged dialysis exposure $3 years who are
increasingly encountered in current clinical practice due to
the long-standing shortage of suitable deceased donor
kidneys for transplantation (4). The relevance of this
analysis is highlighted by the fact that there are n=3112
patients with similar duration of dialysis exposure cur-
rently waitlisted for transplantation as well as a potential
group of over 22,000 patients on dialysis ages 18–69 years
old with $10 years of dialysis exposure who have never
been waitlisted and could rapidly receive a deceased donor
transplant if referred and found suitable for waitlisting
under the new KAS (10).
The finding that transplantation was associated with a
substantially better survival among patients with $10
years of dialysis exposure was surprising. We hypothe-
sized that transplantation may not be associated with better

 survival in such patients because of a survivor effect and
because pretransplant dialysis exposure is associated with
inferior post-transplant allograft survival (6–8). The asso-
ciation of transplantation with better survival was pre-
served in subgroups of patients, including those with
diabetes as the cause of ESRD, those of older age, and
patients sensitized to human leukocyte antigens. Compared
with the seminal analyses of Wolfe et al. (1), patients with
prolonged dialysis exposure in this study required a much
longer time to achieve the survival benefit associated with
transplantation. In that study, transplant recipients had an
equal risk of death 106 days after transplantation and
derived a survival benefit 244 days after transplantation
compared with 180 and 657 days, respectively, in these
study patients. These differences are primarily the result of
the fact that study patients were dialysis survivors and
had a lower overall death rate during dialysis treatment
(5.8/100 patient-years) compared with patients included in
the analysis of Wolfe et al. (1) (6.3/100 patient-years). In
addition, study patients also had a slightly higher rate of
death after transplantation (3.9/100 patient-years) com-
pared with 3.8/100 patient-years in the analysis of Wolfe
et al. (1). This information may be useful when counseling
patients who are clinically stable and have been on long-
term dialysis about the benefits of kidney transplantation.
Examination of the death rates in study patients during
dialysis treatment also provides information that may be
important for the management of similar patients currently
on the waiting list. There was a relatively large increase in
the death rate with increasing time on dialysis in study
patients after the 10-year dialysis anniversary. Of note, 80%
of the study patients were waitlisted after their 10-year
dialysis anniversary, and it is likely that some patients were
evaluated by transplant centers relatively close to the time
of deceased donor transplantation, suggesting the impor-
tance of close surveillance of such patients during the
waitlisting period.
Despite our efforts to identify a contemporary cohort of
patients with sufficient potential follow-up to inform
current clinical practice, the extent to which the study
findings can be applied to the over 25,000 dialysis-treated
patients with similar durations of pretransplant exposure is
uncertain. The study patients were younger and had higher
EPTS than the over 3000 patients currently waitlisted with a
similar duration of pretransplant dialysis exposure. Only a
minority (n=528; 9.8%) of the study patients were waitlisted
after the implementation of the new KAS, and 267 of these
patients received a transplant. Therefore, the majority of
study patients were likely not waitlisted with the expectation
of rapid transplantation, which may be the primary motiva-
tion to refer patients not currently waitlisted for transplan-
tation after the implementation of the new KAS.
It is notable that most study patients received relatively
low KDPI kidneys, and only 6% received kidneys with
KDPI.85%. Given the higher risk of perioperative morbidity

 in transplants using high KDPI kidneys (14–16), patients
with prolonged dialysis exposure may not derive a survival
benefit from transplantation from a high-KDPI donor. The
main consideration in selecting patients for a high KDPI
donor kidney is to avoid the additional exposure to dialysis
required to receive a better-quality kidney (15,16). This
consideration may not be relevant for most patients with
prolonged dialysis exposure under current allocation rules,
because such patients may gain rapid access to better-quality
deceased donor kidneys. The duration of dialysis exposure
(i.e., $10 years) was arbitrarily chosen but is justified by
the fact that a substantial proportion (13%) of currently
waitlisted patients have had ESRD (including treatment
with dialysis or transplantation) for 11 years or longer (5).
This study is subject to the well known limitations of
observational studies and did not examine other impor-
tant considerations, including improvements in quality of
life and cost-savings associated with transplantation, com-
pared with treatment with dialysis (2).
In summary, kidney transplantation with good-quality
deceased donor kidneys was associated with a long-term
survival benefit in selected patients with pretransplant
dialysis exposure $10 years. However, survival was not
achieved until nearly 2 years after the date of transplan-
tation, despite the fact that most of the transplants were
performed with relatively low KDPI kidneys. Although
these findings support consideration of patients with
similar durations of dialysis exposure for transplantation,
further studies are needed to inform the selection of such
patients for transplantation and determine whether such
patients also benefit from transplantation with lower-
quality deceased donor kidneys.
