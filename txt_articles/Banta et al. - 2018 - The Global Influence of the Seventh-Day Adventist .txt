Abstract: The emphasis on health ministry within the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) movement led
to the development of sanitariums in mid-nineteenth century America. These facilities, the most
notable being in Battle Creek, Michigan, initiated the development of vegetarian foods, such as
breakfast cereals and analogue meats. The SDA Church still operates a handful of food production
facilities around the world. The first Battle Creek Sanitarium dietitian was co-founder of the American
Dietetics Association which ultimately advocated a vegetarian diet. The SDA Church established
hundreds of hospitals, colleges, and secondary schools and tens of thousands of churches around
the world, all promoting a vegetarian diet. As part of the ‘health message,’ diet continues to be an
important aspect of the church’s evangelistic efforts. In addition to promoting a vegetarian diet and
abstinence from alcohol, the SDA church has also invested resources in demonstrating the health
benefits of these practices through research. Much of that research has been conducted at Loma Linda
University in southern California, where there have been three prospective cohort studies conducted
over 50 years. The present study, Adventist Health Study-2, enrolled 96,194 Adventists throughout
North America in 2003–2004 with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Adventist Health
Studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet is associated with longer life and better health.

1. Introduction
For millennia, numerous faith traditions have encouraged adherents to limit eating meat, even if
temporarily. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, which began in mid-nineteenth-century America
explicitly linked theology and food to encourage a vegetarian lifestyle among present and potential
believers. The Church also influenced the diet of non-members around the world through its ambitious
organizational structure dedicated to education, health care, and the development and mass production
of plant-based foods, such as meat analogues, breakfast cereals, and soy milk. Lastly, results of research
conducted among vegetarian Adventists and at universities affiliated with the church have greatly
contributed to the scientific understanding of the health effects of vegetarian diets and to dietary
changes of the society at large.
Historians have noted that the religious and social upheaval of the Second Great Awakening
of early to mid-nineteenth Century America produced movements such as Mormonism, Shakerism,

and Millerism (Butler 1986). When the Millerite prediction that the world would end in the early 1840’s
did not come to pass, a handful from that movement went into a period of reflection and reassessment,
resulting in a core group of ‘Adventists.’ This group increased from about 200 in 1850 to 3500 when
the Seventh-day Adventist church was officially organized in 1863, having wide-ranging interests such
as temperance, education, and religious liberty (Butler 1986).
Historically, the SDA church began as a sect, marked by a high “state of tension” with the
surrounding sociocultural environment due to factors such as prohibitions on diet and entertainment,
observance of Saturday as the Sabbath, refusal to bear arms, and belief in the imminent end of
the world (Lawson 1998). Over time, the Adventist church reduced those tensions, in part as a
result of the educational and healthcare institutions it developed and also through legal and political
accommodations (Lawson 1998).
In this review we will show the important role of diet within the theology and practice of
Adventism, how the organizational and institutional structure of the church advances the Adventist
perspective on diet—particularly in the marketplace, and how Adventists have used research and
professional activities to advance vegetarianism in the broader society. Although this article focuses on
efforts within the United States, there are examples of efforts across the world-wide church. We will be
using the term ‘vegetarian’ as opposed to ‘plant-based’ to refer to the Adventist diet. However, there are
also sub-groupings with this group such as vegan (no animal products), lacto-ovo-vegetarian
(can include eggs and/or milk), pesco-vegetarian (can also include fish), and semi-vegetarian (eat red
meat, poultry, and fish less than once per week and more than once per month) (Le and Sabate 2014).
2. Church Mission and Structure
2.1. Theology and Health Message
The SDA church has long been noted as a Bible-based church. In contrast to many Christian
denominations, the church views many of the Old Testament’s teachings and practices as still applicable.
This is demonstrated in the church’s name referencing the seventh-day Sabbath established at creation
as presented in Genesis 2:1–3 and reiterated in the Mosaic covenant at Mount Sinai as written in
Exodus 20:8–11. Another aspect of the creation account appreciated by Adventists is that the initial
human diet was proclaimed by God as drawing on “every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole
earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it” (Genesis 1:29 New International Version).
The church does not have a formal creed, but has published a list of fundamental beliefs
(28 Fundamental Beliefs 2015). Fundamental Belief #22 is titled “Christian Behavior.” It includes
the idea that the human body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and, thus, requires attentive care.
Specifically regarding diet: “Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt the most healthful diet
possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures” (28 Fundamental Beliefs 2015).
Leviticus 11:1–23 identifies ‘unclean’ animals such as pigs, shellfish, vultures, and bats. Ceremonially clean
animals include fish with scales and fins, chickens, duck, geese, and four-legged animals which chew
the cud and have split hooves, such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The concept of body as a temple was
advanced early in the denomination’s history. An extreme example was SMI Henry, who wrote in
1900 that the Holy Spirit could even eliminate disease and restore health, based on her experience of
supernatural healing as a patient in the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1896 (Land 2001).
One of the Church’s founding leaders, and certainly its most prolific writer, was Ellen G. White,
who lived from 1827 until 1915. She wrote about many topics, including diet, and may be one of the
most translated woman authors in history (Sanchez et al. 2016). One of her books, Ministry of Healing,
includes a chapter titled “Diet and Health.” In that chapter she provides a number of recommendations.
Some notable assertions include:
•
“Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator” (p. 296).
•
“There is more religion in a good loaf of bread than many people think” (p. 302).
•
“A disordered stomach produces a disordered mind” (p. 310).
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
3 of 25
•
“When it comes to diet, one person cannot lay down an exact rule for another” (p. 310).
A survey of Adventist religious faculty found that many considered wholism to be the church’s
most important contribution to theology—more so than interpretations regarding the second advent
and the seventh-day Sabbath (Bull 1990). This understanding that “a healthy mind and body directly
affects one’s morals and one’s ability to discern truth” is distinct from the anthropological dualism of
many Christian (Sanchez et al. 2016) as well as non-Christian faith traditions. Adventist faculty in Chile
examined the social meaning of vegetarian diet, based primarily on two books: Prophetess of Health:
A Study of Ellen G. White, written by historian and former Adventist, Ronald L. Numbers (1st edition
1976, 3rd edition 2008), and the SDA response, Messenger of the Lord (1998) by Herbert E. Douglass.
They argued that the vegetarian diet in the 1800’s ritualized the new identity of the emerging Adventist
movement and also had great symbolic meaning (Sanchez et al. 2016). For example, vegetarian diet
was an important part of ‘the present truth’, that is, the message that the church was to proclaim to the
world and served as a reminder to the Adventist view of world history, starting with the vegetarian
diet originating in the Garden of Eden (Sanchez et al. 2016).
One sociologist of religion has claimed that Adventists and other faiths with a vegetarian element,
such as Buddhists, exhibit varying levels of a “bio-spirituality” in which “food, health and worship
are unified on a daily basis, at every meal” (Nath 2010). In summary, though the SDA church does
not include diet, including vegetarianism, as a formal element of theological teaching or as a tenet for
membership, it does advocate for a healthy diet based on the principle that our bodies are temples
of God.
The “Adventist” part of the denomination’s name refers to a belief in the literal return of Jesus,
particularly as discussed in the Book of Revelation. A key passage is Revelation 12:6–12, which presents
a vision of three angels who give a message to the world about the impending judgement and the
importance of faithfulness and keeping the commandments. Early Church leaders advocated for
the SDA Church fulfilling a prophetic role by proclaiming the “Three Angels Message”. Early on,
Ellen White linked the “Health Message” with the “Three Angels Message”:
The health reform is as closely related to the third angel’s message as the arm to the body;
but the arm cannot take the place of the body. The proclamation of the third angel’s
message, the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus, is the burden of our
work. The message is to be proclaimed with a loud cry, and is to go to the whole world.
The presentation of health principles must be united with this message, but must not in any
case be independent of it, or in any way take the place of it. Page 75.1. (White 1976)
2.2. Church Structure
2.2.1. Membership and Church Institutions
As seen in Table 1, the SDA church had 20.3 million members worldwide as of 30 June 2017.
For administrative purposes, the church is organized into 13 geographic ‘divisions.’ The headquarters
for the worldwide church is called the General Conference and is located near Washington, D.C.
Each division has its own administrative center, with many divisions being comprised of ‘conferences,’
which also have their own administrative structures. SDA membership is lowest in the Middle East
and North Africa Division and Northern Asia-Pacific Division, primarily Islamic and Asian countries,
particularly those presently or formerly under communist rule and/or where Christian evangelism
is restricted.

The SDA church has emphasized evangelism efforts in developing countries.
A majority
of members reside in low to middle-level income countries, with the top five countries in 2009
being India—1.5 million, Brazil—1.1 million, the United States—1.0 million, Philippines and
Zambia—0.7 million each (Lawson and Cragun 2012). Furthermore, even within developed countries,
a large percentage of Adventists are in lower-income categories (Lawson and Cragun 2012).
Adventists were early adopters of medical programs on radio and cooking shows on television
and have become media-savvy about spreading their health message. As of 31 December 2016, the SDA
Church had 15 media centers, 59 publishing houses and branches, 6050 credentialed and licensed
literature evangelists, and 25,332 full time/part time/intern literature evangelists who distribute
books and other materials, including the vegetarian and health message in about 375 languages
(SDA 2018). Furthermore, the Church programs aired on 853 radio stations and 441 television stations;
produced more than 70,000 podcasts each year in 229 languages with over 1.1 billion downloads
in 2015 (Sboros 2017). One example is the It Is Written ministry (https://www1.itiswritten.com/),
which is currently based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. That ministry has been airing TV programs since
1956 and also has a related Spanish-language ministry. Although most of their effort is on evangelism
and humanitarian projects, they have produced media segments specifically on diet.
The Adventist Church has a mission emphasizing health care and education. As seen in Table 1,
as of 30 June 2017 the SDA Church had 85,112 local churches, 171 hospitals or sanitariums, 101 colleges
or universities, and 753 secondary schools. At a practical level, co-location of SDA schools, hospitals,
food factories and churches provides a synergy among Adventist institutions. For example, as a result
of co-location, parent(s) may work for an SDA hospital or college and send their child(ren) to SDA
K-12 schools. The entire family then attends a local SDA church. Additionally, there are often SDA
grocery stories which specialize in the sale of vegetarian foods located on or near SDA colleges and/or
church regional offices. This co-location reinforces the SDA lifestyle among members.
2.2.2. Adventist Healthcare
The Adventist “health system” is one of the largest nonprofit healthcare delivery systems in the
world. In addition to hospitals and sanitariums, in 2016, the SDA Church operated 329 clinics
and dispensaries, 133 nursing homes/retirement centers and 21 orphanages/children’s homes,
and provided more than 17 million outpatient visits (SDA 2018). As a result, many people were
potentially exposed to the Church’s wellness and lifestyle philosophy.
Although organizationally distinct, the hospital network is perceived to be under the umbrella of
the SDA Church. That network in the United States includes five different systems which together
have 83 hospitals (AHPA 2017). Roughly thirty independent hospitals throughout Africa, Asia, and the
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
5 of 25
Americas are loosely coordinated through Adventist Health International (What Is AHI? 2018), which is
headquartered in Loma Linda.
An underlying premise of SDA health care is the importance of total wellness (spiritual, physical,
social and mental). Unfortunately, the reputation of hospital food both inside and outside of Adventism
has not always been the best. More Adventist hospitals are moving away from greasy, highly processed
and bland tasting foods, making way for fresh, vibrant and tasty vegetarian fare using ingredients
grown on on-site gardens or from local farmers. One example of this is the Parkview Adventist Medical
Center in Brunswick, Maine (Kamila 2010). Another example is the Adventist Health Castle Medical
Center in Kailua, Hawaii, which always includes a vegan option at each meal and highlights their
renowned tofu walnut bars (The Bistro 2018). Many other hospitals also tout their food services on-line.
The majority of Adventist Health institutions offer vegetarian food items in their cafeterias as well as
to their patients, though many also offer limited meat options for their patients.
There is limited published research regarding Adventist hospitals, one resource being the
Adventist HealthCare Center for Health Equity and Wellness located in Gaithersburg, Maryland
(https://www.adventisthealthcare.com/health/equity-and-wellness/research/). Another resource
is the Australasian Research Institute located on the campus of the Sydney Adventist Hospital
(http://www.australasianresearch.org/). The Australasian Research Institute has published diet-related
articles regarding inpatients. Another organization that could potentially address hospitals and diet is the
Adventist Health Policy Association (http://adventisthealthpolicy.org/).
2.2.3. Sanitariums
Historically, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was linked with the health sanatoriums of the
‘Christian Physiology’ movement of nineteenth century America (Nath 2010). That health reform
movement was underscored by beliefs that diet was not only essential in maintaining health but
also pivotal in shaping morality (Nath 2010). On a practical level, Ellen White’s vision of health
reform was first operationalized in 1866 as the Western Reform Institute in Battle Creek Michigan.
It combined several theories of health reform designed to heal the whole person by caring for the mind,
body and spirit. Patients were taught to cure themselves whenever possible using “natural” means,
including water, sunshine, exercise, rest and proper diet. To bring a more professional approach,
the White’s partially subsidized the medical education of John Harvey Kellogg, the son of initial
contributors to the Institute. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg served as medical director for 67 years,
renaming the institute as the “Battle Creek Medical Surgical Sanitarium” (The Battle Creek Idea 2009).
Dr. John Harvey Kellogg emphasized hydrotherapy (more than 200 variety of water treatments),
invented several forms of light and radiant heat baths—including one installed in Buckingham Palace,
developed musical accompaniments for exercise routines, and performed over 22,000 operations—and
was even consulted by the Mayo brothers and other leading physicians of the day on difficult cases
(The Battle Creek Idea 2009).
Malcolm Bull argued that John Harvey Kellogg was crucial in the medicalization and
secularization of the SDA church. For example, whereas Ellen White had originally supported lifestyle
reform on moral grounds, such as to control sexual appetite and avoid sin; the church transitioned
to health as an important goal in-and-of itself, with the religious organization generally following
the lead taken by medicine (Bull 1990). A brief overview of sanitariums, with an emphasis on diet,
was given in a speech by Dr. Kellogg:
The sanitarium is a product of modern medical progress . . . The central and fundamental
idea in such a place should be the thought that health-getting is not a matter of magic
nor of pill-swallowing, but, rather, a matter of education. . . . . A sanitarium must provide
food prepared in such a manner as to be both wholesome and palatable, tempting to the
patient whose appetite is perverted and fickle, and at the same time easy of digestion and
highly nourishing. (Kellogg 1891)
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
6 of 25
The Battle Creek Sanitarium grew dramatically during its first forty years, including a large new
construction following a fire in 1902. However, with increasing success there was also increasing
conflict between church and Sanitarium leaders to the extent that in 1907 the Kellogg brothers
assumed full control and were “dis-fellowshipped” from the SDA church (The Battle Creek Idea 2009).
Eventually most sanitariums became traditional hospitals, even if keeping the designation in their
name. However, there are some modern Adventist examples still following the historical precedents,
such as the Weimar Institute in Northern California, which treats guests using the NEWSTART
approach (N = Excellent Nutrition, E = Regular Exercise, W = Pure Water, S = Sunlight in Moderate
Amounts, T = Temperance in All Things, A = Fresh Air, R = Daily and Weekly Rest, T = Trust in God
(About Us 2018).
An essay specifically on Adventism in Nordic countries observed that the sanitarium concept
of the early 1900’s found a ready market, particularly among the upper classes. However, as society
became more secularized, as government increasingly paid for healthcare, and as SDA institutions
provided conventional medical procedures, it became more difficult to maintain distinct SDA facilities
(Eklof 2008). The conclusion, at least within Sweden, was that “The successful enterprises—as they had
been for a considerable time—could not, at the end of the 20th century, continue to be self-financing or
fulfil the missionary objectives among the upper classes. The institutionalized health care apparatus
came to an end around the turn of the century, which also included the sale of health associated food
product companies” (Eklof 2008).
2.2.4. SDA Education
As of 31 December 2016 there were 8515 educational institutions in the world under SDA
management, with total enrollment of 1.95 million students (SDA 2018), making it the world’s second
largest integrated network of schools. As part of the admissions process, students are informed
of the SDA lifestyle requirements while on campus. Adventist schools serve vegetarian meals to
their students and promote an atmosphere of wholeness in which there is a balance between diet,
exercise and school work. Schools are always working to ensure that the meals served are not only
tasty and visually appealing but that they also meet the national nutritional guidelines. Many of those
schools, particularly within the US, have webpages which mention their menus. An article published
by the Vegetarian Resource Group highlights an effort by a dietitian to improve the quality of the
vegetarian lunch menu in one SDA school (Gall and Salazar 2012).
Although the largest number of people are touched in primary and secondary schools, there is
a strong emphasis on academic and professional training. Most salient for diet, particularly with
the establishment of multiple Adventist sanitariums, was a need for trained dietetic staff. Early in
the 1900’s the question was raised as to how the church would educate members to fill the need.
“Are we to send our young people to worldly schools to study the science of health and nutrition
and then apply their knowledge to the solving of the problems in our institutions” (Denny 1919)?
According to Ellen G. White, one answer was to provide education through its own schools rather
than send members to secular schools:
At Loma Linda many can be educated to work as missionaries in the cause of health and
temperance... That which is of the most importance is that the students be taught how to
represent aright the principles of health reform. (Denny 1919)
Thus, nutrition and dietetics education was established in 1908 at Loma Linda University.
Furthermore, Mervyn G. Hardinge produced one of the early investigations of vegetarianism for
a doctoral dissertation at Harvard in the early 1950’s, then went on to be founding dean of the Loma
Linda University School of Public Health in 1967. As seen in Table 2, 13 other SDA universities also
offer college through graduate degree programs in diet/nutrition. In addition to the United States,
nutrition degrees are offered in Jamaica, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe,
the Philippines, and South Korea.

2.2.5. SDA Churches
There have been thousands of articles published regarding churches and health. These include efforts
by the public health and academic communities to work with various churches to further health promotion
activities and to reduce health disparities (Markens et al. 2002; Kaplan et al. 2006). Religious organizations
can have a great influence on members’ behavior at many levels (Campbell et al. 2007).
One way in which efforts at local churches are enhanced is through coordinating from within
the SDA hierarchy. For example, the SDA General Conference has a health ministry’s department,
which supports and coordinates health activities throughout the organization. As an example of the
ongoing importance of diet, their main webpage on 11 July 2018 included a number of diet-related
items, such as a report on the most recent General Conference Nutrition Council Annual Meeting,
a summary of the 7th International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition, a Factsheet on vegetarian diets
and a link to the SDA vegetarian version of the USDA MyPlate (http://healthministries.com/).
SDA churches provide a number of food-related activities not just for their members but also
for the community in the form of food drives and vegetarian cooking classes. Churches may serve
as venues for public health interventions. An SDA version is the Complete Health Improvement
Program (CHIP), developed by Loma Linda University graduate Hans Diehl, which is centered on the
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
8 of 25
promotion of a whole-food, vegetarian eating pattern, and daily physical activity (Morton et al. 2014;
Diehl 1998).
Furthermore, the link between nutrition education and church mission is clearly shown in an
Adventist Review (a denominational newsmagazine) article:
In the Far East, Africa, the Middle East, North, Central, and South America, Europe, Australia,
and the islands of the Pacific, Vegetarian Nutrition instructors are directing schools of health,
cooking schools, and helpful classes of many kinds. With new programs for the home,
the church, and the community, the church is acknowledging the truth of Ellen G. White’s
statement: “To teach . . . the science of healthful living is to do missionary work for the
Master.”—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 476. (Vyhmeister 1984)
One of the SDA traditions is the “Sabbath Potluck” where church members bring a vegetarian
dish to share and fellowship with other church goers. Whereas most SDA churches have an unwritten
“vegetarian potluck” policy, there are churches where meat options will be found on the table. A recent
article published in the Adventist Review discussed the passing of Ella May Hartlein (Ella May Hartlein,
Credited with the Invention of the Haystack, Dies at 98 2018). She has been credited with the invention
of Haystacks, which is one of the most popular “dishes” for SDAs. A mix of tortilla chips, beans, cheese
and vegetables, it is a well-known menu item at camp meetings and other large church gatherings.
There are many variations on the original recipe; for example, some add rice to the mix and skip the
chips or some will have lettuce instead of chips.
2.2.6. SDA Humanitarian Outreach
Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) is the global humanitarian organization of the
Seventh-day Adventist Church (https://adra.org/). They deliver relief and development assistance
to individuals in more than 131 countries, funding nearly 1200 projects and reaching an estimated
15.6 million beneficiaries (SDA 2018). ADRA focuses on nine impact areas, with one being hunger
and nutrition. Efforts under this impact area include assisting farmers to increase their food supply,
income and savings for food purchasing, helping women to identify, prevent, and treat malnutrition
at an early stage, before it impacts their long-term health, and promoting community-level nutrition
awareness using strategies that help households achieve diverse and nutrient-rich diets.
Indeed, when thinking of diet in less-developed parts of the world, such as much of Africa,
the issue is not so much vegetarianism, as it is poverty and malnutrition, compounded by the epidemic
of HIV/AIDS. In fact, it has been documented that one of the barriers to successful treatment of
HIV/AIDS is food insecurity (McKinney et al. 2014). In an effort towards increasing the use of
soybeans within Kenya, a household survey in 2005 found that essentially Adventists were the only
respondents using soybeans; they were processing soybeans into roasted soy nuts or soy beverages
(Chianu et al. 2008). Though not an official program, efforts directed toward an SDA response to
poverty might follow a theology of wealth and poverty presented as a, “Charity in community with
claiming faith and self-limitation” model in a paper based on in-depth interviews of Adventists in
Malawi (Doss 2011). In that article, Gordon Doss noted that in 2010, 22% of all Christians resided in
Africa and that those individuals often have different views regarding wealth and poverty compared
to those in the West. Their views regarding acknowledgement of limited resources may be consistent
with a plant-based, rather than meat-based diet.
3. SDA Food Industry, Research, and policy
3.1. Food Industry
A centerpiece of the sanitarium philosophy was improving the diet of patients. Towards that end,
Ella Eaton Kellogg, along with her husband John Harvey Kellogg and brother-in-law William Keith
Kellogg, ran an experimental kitchen which developed more than 80 grain and nut-food products,
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
9 of 25
including peanut butter and flaked breakfast foods (The Battle Creek Idea 2009). In the United States,
Seventh-day Adventists established around 100 cereal-based processed food companies, many of
which merged (Sboros 2017). The Battle Creek Sanitarium played a significant role in shaping the
mass-produced breakfast cereal industry (Nath 2010). The eating habits of the American public were
transformed by flaking wheat, breakfast became boxed cereal a la Kellogg, as opposed to a breakfast
heavy on eggs and meat.
Shurtleff and Aoyagi (2014), have released a 1344 page book in which they present historical
details regarding Seventh-day Adventist work with soy foods, vegetarianism, meat alternatives,
wheat gluten, dietary fiber and peanut butter. The following section relies heavily on their work.
As they note, there are two basic types of Seventh-day Adventist organizations: (1) Those owned by
the SDA church/denomination (officially General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists)—such as
Sanitarium Foods (Australia) and Loma Linda Foods (from 1905 to about 1989) and (2) Those owned
by practicing Seventh-day Adventists—such as Worthington Foods and Cedar Lake. There have
been many transfers of ownership among food producers. This paper will not attempt to provide a
complete corporate history or cover every food product. There have been many changes of ownership,
including selling entities to non-Adventists. Furthermore, the emphasis for this review is on U.S.
activities. As of 2016, the SDA Church reported owning 20 entities within the category of “Food
Industries” (SDA 2018).
3.1.1. Breakfast Cereals
The wheat flake was discovered accidentally in 1894 and served in the Sanitarium dining rooms
under the name of “Granose,” flavored only with salt. In 1895, Dr. Kellogg filed a patent application
for “flaked cereals and the process of preparing same,” also including barley, oats, corn and other
grains in the application. John and W. K. Kellogg formed the Sanitas Food Company primarily to
manufacture their health foods for current and former patients (The Battle Creek Idea 2009).
A former patient, C.W. Post, developed Postum, a grain-based improved version of the
coffee-substitute served at the Sanitarium, and then developed Grape-Nuts cereal, which turned
Post into a millionaire by 1900. As others saw the potential wealth, a ‘cereal boom’ started in Battle
Creek. Younger brother W.K. Kellogg wanted to join that broader market with products tastier than
served at the Sanitarium, so he formed his own Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1906
(The Battle Creek Idea 2009), independent of his older brother who had little interest in profit.
The resulting Kellogg Company is still based in Battle Creek, with a market capitalization in June 2018
of $23.4 billion, whereas Post Holdings enjoys a market capitalization of $5.9 billion.
3.1.2. Meat Analogues
Meat analogues are products developed with similar texture, flavor, color, and nutritive value to
be substituted directly for meat. They can be created using low cost vegetable protein such as textured
soy protein, mushroom, wheat gluten, and pulses as a substitute for animal-protein (Kumar et al. 2017).
One randomized cross-over study of 43 healthy young men found that high protein meals based on
beans and peas were more filling and satiating compared to a high protein meal based on veal and
pork (Kristensen et al. 2016). Market research in 2012 found that although only 7 percent of consumers
call themselves vegetarian, 36 percent report using meat substitutes (Connolly 2013).
This category of commercial meat alternatives was invented by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, with his
first two meat alternatives being Nuttose (1896) and Protose (1899)—both based on ground peanuts.
In the United States this category was commercially pioneered (starting in the early 1940s) and
developed by Worthington Foods and Loma Linda Foods (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).
3.1.3. Soy Foods
In 1892, Ella Kellogg published “Science in the Kitchen”, in which she wrote, “The nitrogenous
matter of legumes is termed legumin, or vegetable casein, and its resemblance to the animal casein of
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
10 of 25
milk is very marked. The Chinese make use of this fact, and manufacture cheese [clearly tofu] from
peas and beans.” This was followed by an 1896 editorial “Bean Cheese,” by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg
in his periodical Modern Medicine and Bacteriological Review, in which he gave a detailed description of
how tofu and frozen tofu are made (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014). Later, Dr. Kellogg included two recipes
involving soybeans in his 1919 edition of “The New Method in Diabetes” (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2004).
La Sierra Industries (Arlington, California) launched La Sierra Smoein—a bacon-flavored smoked
soy powder seasoning in 1921. This was America’s first commercial soy-based meat alternative.
Dr. Harry W. Miller started making and canning Miller’s Soya Lac (soymilk fortified with vitamins and
minerals, renamed Soyalac by September 1941) and Soy-A-Malt (malted soymilk) at his International
Nutrition Laboratory in Mt. Vernon, Ohio. Soyalac was America’s first widely successful soymilk.
It remained on the market as an infant formula for decades (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).
In 1960, Worthington Foods, originally of Worthington, Ohio introduced Fry-Chik, a meatless
drumstick that was the world’s first meat alternative based on spun soy protein fibers, followed in 1974
with the Morningstar Farms line of meat-like products also based on spun soy protein fibers. The first
of a new generation of meat alternative entrees, they were soon sold nationally in U.S. supermarkets.
Since the mid-1970s, Worthington has been the world’s largest manufacturer of meat-like vegetarian
products—most based on soy proteins and gluten. However, Kellogg Co. purchased Worthington
Foods in 1991 for $342 million. With that sale, there was a time with no SDA companies making soy
foods or meat alternatives in the United States (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).
However, in 2009, Adventists formed Heritage Health Foods (http://heritagehealthfood.com/),
located in Collegedale, Tennessee. Heritage purchased both the Cedar Lake Food Company (originally of
Cedar Lake, Michigan) and the Worthington frozen product line. They sell not only soy products, but also
vegetarian corn dogs, sliced deli meats, hamburgers, sausage, and even vegefish fillets.
Outside of the United States, there was SDA food production in England by 1907, with their
first soy product, Granose Protose, being launched in 1940 (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014). Although no
longer under SDA control, granose continues be sold by Symington’s, an English company founded
in 1827. Harry W. Miller, an Adventist medical missionary in China, in 1937 introduced Vetose Soya
Milk (natural or chocolate), Soy Ice Cream, and Vetose Acidophilus (cultured soymilk) made by
his Vetose Nutritional Laboratories in Shanghai; unfortunately, that business was destroyed by the
Japanese military during World War II. Fortunately, he survived and moved to Ohio (see above).
On a more successful international note, in 1962 Dr. Harrison, a Black American physician and
self-supporting Seventh-day Adventist medical missionary, founded Africa Basic Foods in Uganda.
This was the earliest known company in Black Africa to make and market a line of commercial soy
foods. His company continues as the East African Basic Foods Ltd.
3.1.4. Wheat Gluten
As early as 1882, the Food Department of the Battle Creek Sanitarium was selling Gluten Wafers,
Gluten Food, and Diabetic Food. All were probably used in diabetic diets. In 1907, Dr. Kellogg was
issued U.S. Patent 869,371 for a meat substitute whose two main ingredients were gluten and casein
(milk protein). By 1912 the Kellogg Food Co. in Battle Creek, Michigan, was selling at least 7 food
products based on wheat gluten, including 3 types of biscuits and a breakfast toast. Protose, launched in
1899, was Dr. Kellogg’s second earliest commercial meat like product—after Nuttose. Originally made
from nuts, at some early unknown date Protose came to include gluten.
Worthington Foods has been the most commercially successful in introducing gluten-based meat
like products to America. Their first such product was Proast, launched in 1939, followed by Choplets
in 1941. In 1968–70 with Prosage (a meatless sausage) Worthington invented a unique and proprietary
process for combining gluten and textured soy proteins to give improved texture, flavor, and nutritional
value—leading to a host of new meat like products by the early 1980s. By 1992, Seventh-day Adventist
food companies had introduced at least 166 commercial food products containing gluten as a major
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
11 of 25
ingredient; of these, at least 55 were made by Worthington Foods. Moreover, of Worthington’s
180 products, approximately 90% contained at least some wheat gluten (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).
3.1.5. Peanut Butter
According to legend, a kitchen worker stepped on a peanut and from that concocted America’s
favorite sandwich spread. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, in an 1895 letter to Ellen G. White in Australia,
wrote: “We make very little use of cream or milk in our family, and use no butter whatever for seasoning,
but use nuts instead. I have recently succeeded in making some very excellent preparations from nuts
which take the place of butter entirely and are sweeter, more palatable, and more digestible. I find
this plan is working very successfully both with the patients and with the helpers at the Dormitory.”
Three months later, Dr. Kellogg applied for U.S. patent (No. 567,901) for a “nut-butter” made from
peanuts or almonds (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).
In 1896 Dr. Kellogg’s peanut butter was sold commercially, by Sanitas Nut Food Company.
In an ad titled “New Nut Products” in the Chicago Vegetarian (p. 8), Nut Butter was advertised as:
“A substitute for ordinary butter, presenting fat in the form of a perfect emulsion; combined with water,
forms a delicious cream. Used for shortening of all kinds. A pure product of nuts; can be eaten by
those who cannot eat ordinary butter (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).” Then, in 1898, Edward Halsey,
formerly a baker at Battle Creek, through the Sanitarium Health Food Co. in Australia introduced
Sanitarium Peanut Butter—Australia’s first (Shurtleff and Aoyagi 2014).
3.1.6. SDA-Operated Food Organizations
Table 3 presents the food industries which are officially part of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
The oldest of organizations, listed in the SDA Yearbook under the name of “Health Food Department”,
is the Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company, which is the trading name of two sister food companies
(Australian Health and Nutrition Association Ltd. and New Zealand Health Association Ltd.). Founded in
Melbourne, Victoria, Sanitarium has factories in Australia and New Zealand. Its flagship product is
Weet-Bix, sold in the Australian and New Zealand breakfast cereal markets. Sanitarium has produced
and marketed many food products throughout its 120 year history, including breakfast cereals, peanut
butter, vegetarian meals, snacks and beverages (Sanitarium—Our Story 2018). It is considered to be
the largest and most diverse organization within the Adventist food industry.

3.2. Research
There is now a well-established body of research by Adventists which support a vegetarian
lifestyle. However, it is important to recognize that there was some risk involved at the beginning.
In fact, administrators at Loma Linda University in the mid 1900’s discouraged the first vegetarian
researcher, because, “if you find the diets of vegetarians are deficient, it will embarrass us”
(Johnston 1999). Fortunately, that researcher, Mervyn G. Hardinge, persevered and encouraged
others as well. It is also important to note that there are many conflicting claims made regarding which
type of diet is optimal. This paper is not the forum for such a scientific debate, in this section we are
simply presenting what Adventists have published in the peer-reviewed literature.
3.2.1. Adventist Health Studies
The Adventist Health Studies and several British studies, most recently the Oxford EPIC Study,
have been recognized as major Western cohort studies that generally demonstrate vegetarian diet
health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular disease, cancer, and overall mortality rates as well as
better mental health (Beezhold et al. 2009; Key et al. 1999; Tonstad et al. 2009). The results from the
British studies with regard to cancer and total mortality have been less convincing, although showing
somewhat similar results. It is well-recognized, however, that vegetarian diets in different parts of the
world do differ substantially (Fraser 2009), which makes direct comparisons challenging.
The Adventist studies began with the SDA Mortality Study of 1958–1966 (Kahn et al. 1984;
Phillips 1980). White male and female California Adventists who were 30 to 89 years old in 1960 were
recruited from 234 churches, and participants completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1960
(Snowdon and Phillips 1985). There were 22,940 study participants (Butler et al. 2008). In addition to
surveys, all deaths in the Adventist cohort during 1960 to 1980 were identified by computer-assisted
record linkage to the California death certificate file (Snowdon and Phillips 1985).
Next was the First Adventist Health Study of 1974–1988 (Fraser et al. 1991; Fraser et al. 1992;
Singh and Fraser 1998). This cohort was defined as non-Hispanic White subjects 30 years of age and
older who lived in California Adventist households and completed two mailed demographic and
lifestyle questionnaires (Fraser and Shavlik 2001). Participants were initially contacted from names and
addresses in church directories and sent a brief census questionnaire. The study enrolled 34,192 men
and women from 437 churches who were sent and returned extensive lifestyle questionnaires,
supplemented by hospitalization data and matches against state death tapes and the National Death
Index (Fraser and Shavlik 2001).
The Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) began in 2002, with goals of examining the relationship
between diet and risk of breast, prostate, and colon cancers in Black and White individuals. A total of
96,194 Adventists in 4500 churches from the United States and Canada were recruited. Special emphasis
was placed on recruiting Blacks, who comprised a substantial portion of Church membership,
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
13 of 25
with AHS-2 staff and trained local recruiters soliciting participation from members of approximately
1000 Black churches throughout the United States and Canada (Herring et al. 2010). It was observed
that calling those members from churches who had not returned the initial questionnaire within
three months did increase participation from Black churches; but not White churches (Bell et al. 2005).
Blacks comprised 26.9% of the final sample (Butler et al. 2008). Both AHS-1 and AHS-2 examined
incidence and mortality, and across all three studies, no more than 2.1% of males and 1.1% of females
were current smokers (Butler et al. 2008).
AHS-2 has received more than $24 million in National Institutes of Health funding since 2002
and resulted in more than 110 publications as of early 2018.
Approximately 400 peer-reviewed
publications have come from all Adventist studies over the 50+ year span.
Findings have been
published in prestigious journals such as JAMA (Smith-Warner et al. 2001), The New England Journal
of Medicine (Sabate et al. 1993), Archives of Internal Medicine (Fraser et al. 1992; Fraser and Shavlik 1997),
and JAMA Internal Medicine (Fraser and Shavlik 2001; Orlich et al. 2013). According to Google
Scholar, as of July 2018, some articles have been cited more than 400 times, with topics including
the health effects of nut consumption (Fraser et al. 1992; Sabate et al. 1993), diet and prostate cancer
(Mills et al. 1989; Jacobsen et al. 1998), effects of air pollution (Abbey et al. 1991; Abbey et al. 1999),
diet and type 2 diabetes (Tonstad et al. 2009), and general effects of diet on cancer/heart disease/mortality
(Mills et al. 1989; Fraser 1999; Phillips 1975; Van den Brandt et al. 2000).
Given the large number of papers, it is beyond the scope of this paper to extensively review
all findings. Dr. Gary Fraser, the principal investigator for AHS-2, has written a book summarizing
findings from Adventist Health studies in relation to chronic illness, particularly cancer and heart
disease (Fraser 2003). More recent reviews have quantitatively summarized Adventist Health Studies
findings with regards to intermediary health outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes
(Le and Sabate 2014; Orlich and Fraser 2014), as well as ischemic and other cardiovascular diseases and
specific types of cancer (Le and Sabate 2014). For the present review, Dr. Fraser has briefly summarized
below several of the most noteworthy aspects in the Adventist Health Studies series:
•
The studies describe mortality and experience of major non-communicable disease among Adventists.
•
Adventists have lower overall mortality, incidence of cardiovascular disease, and also many cancers.
•
Among Adventists, different vegetarian categories (vegans, lacto-ovo-, pesco-vegetarians) are
defined and their dietary characteristics described.
•
Vegetarian Adventists have less hypertension, lower blood lipids and C-reactive protein
(CRP—associated with inflammation), less diabetes, and lower body mass index (BMI) values,
when compared to Adventist non-vegetarians.
•
Vegetarian Adventists have less cardiovascular disease, lower rates of colorectal cancer, and vegans
especially have lower rates of prostate, and probably breast cancer, than non-vegetarian Adventists.
•
Adventists in California live 7.3 years (men) and 4.4 years (women) longer than non-Adventist
California men and women, adjusting for educational differences.
•
Red meat eaters have higher rates of colon cancer.
•
Higher nut consumption is associated with much lower risk of coronary heart disease.
•
Those drinking more dairy milk have lower rates of colon and rectal cancers (but preliminary
findings suggest increased risk of breast and prostate cancers).
•
Independent of fats in the diet, proteins from red meat are associated with higher, and proteins
from nuts and seeds with lower, risk of cardiovascular mortality.
•
A good breakfast and avoiding calories later in the day are associated with lower body weight
with aging.
•
Adventists tend to move toward more vegetarian diets as they age.
•
Higher tomato consumption is associated with lower rates of prostate and ovarian cancers.
•
Confirmed the apparent helpful effects of regular physical activity and adequate protein intake to
prevent common bone fractures.
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
14 of 25
•
Found that overweight is associated with increased mortality through to old age.
•
Air pollution is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease,
asthma and total mortality.
Adventist Health Studies have required developing methods of dealing with effects of dietary
reporting errors and also tested innovations to recruit Black study members more effectively. It should
be noted that AHS also demonstrated the health benefits of church attendance.
For example,
findings from AHS-1 suggested that even after controlling for previous disease status, gender,
vegetarian diet, exercise, nut consumption and smoking, Adventists who attended church less than
once per month were 1.58 times more likely to die during the study period than those who attend
church 3 to 4 times per month (Fraser 2003).
3.2.2. Biopsychosocial Religion and Health Study (BRHS)
In many respects, it is difficult to study the effects of religion and diet on mortality because
AHS-2, by and large, is a church-going cohort, with few members using tobacco or drinking alcohol;
moreover, the non-vegetarians eats less red meat compared to the average American. Loma Linda
researchers, nevertheless, took on this challenge with funding from the National Institute of Aging
for what became the Biopsychological Religion and Health Study (BHRS). The goal was to select a
sample from the AHS-2 cohort and obtain additional psychological and religious data (the Psychosocial
Manifestations of Religion Sub-study, PsyMRS) and additional biological measures for an even smaller
subset (the Biological Manifestations of Religion Sub-study, BioMRS) (Lee et al. 2009)—at two points
in time four years apart.
In an examination of how various psychosocial and religious measures affect mortality,
BRHS researchers sampled approximately 21,000 AHS-2 members, of which 10,988 agreed to
complete a 20-page questionnaire. Of these, 6531 also submitted completed surveys four years later
(Morton et al. 2017). The authors concluded that there are, “complex, interrelated set of religious
constructs that mutually reinforce and complement one another, with the links between religious
variables with psychosocial mediators leading to healthier behaviors and decreased mortality”
(Morton et al. 2017). Interestingly, they found that religious involvement itself had more of an influence
than social support in reducing negative emotional experience.
Whereas lifestyle factors such as vegetarian diet and regular exercise were important predictors
of reduced rates of hypertension, even after controlling for these, intrinsic religiosity was just as
strongly related to lower hypertension rates as the lifestyle factors (Charlemagne-Badal and Lee 2016).
The favorable relationships between anticipated church support and hypertension appear to be
mediated by BMI and are an indication of how this dimension of religion combined with lifestyle
promotes good health, specifically, reduced risk of hypertension (Charlemagne-Badal and Lee 2016b).
In addition, BHSR data has been used to show that trans fatty acid intake and Mediterranean
(mainly vegetarian) foods were related to more positive and less negative affect (Ford et al. 2016;
Ford et al. 2013) as well as related to better emotion regulation (Holt et al. 2014, 2015).
3.2.3. Vegetarianism and Environment
Concern for nature is one of the reasons that convinces many to pursue a plant-based diet.
This includes both a desire to avoid taking the life of animals and a desire to reduce the impact on the
environment. LLU researchers used findings from the Adventist Health Study to estimate what the
impact would be in California if everyone consumed a vegetarian diet. Researchers concluded that the
non-vegetarian diet required “2.9 times more water, 2.5 times more primary energy, 13 times more
fertilizer, and 1.4 times more pesticides than did the vegetarian diet (Marlow et al. 2009).”
LLU researchers have argued that a meat-based diet is harmful to the environment
(Sabate et al. 2015), a vegetarian diet could be beneficial regarding climate change (Soret et al. 2014),
and that wider use of a vegetarian diet not only benefits the environment, it would also advance social
justice (Sabate and Soret 2014).

3.2.4. Research Activity outside of the Unites States
California is not the only source of Adventist studies. There have been diet and lifestyle-related
studies regarding Adventists in a number of countries. As shown in Table 4, these studies have further
documented actual dietary patterns of Adventists and have generally shown better health outcomes
among Adventists, though in some cases showing a shortfall of nutrients or calories. Most studies
involving Adventists other than the Adventist Health Studies series have been descriptive or involved
small sample sizes, one exception has been the use of population registries in Nordic countries.
For example, in Denmark researchers were able to identify thousands of Adventists and Baptists
based on church records and national datasets, then prospectively match to hospital and death records
(Thygesen et al. 2012b).

3.3. Policy
3.3.1. Dietetics Associations
In addition to educating professionals who were well versed in a vegetarian diet, Adventists have
been involved with professional organizations. The American Dietetic Association was founded in
1917. One of its co-founder was Lenna Francis Cooper, the first lead dietitian at the Battle Creek
Sanitarium. One way Cooper’s influence was institutionalized was through an annual “Lenna Frances

Cooper Memorial Lecture” for the ADA. The 20th such lecture argued that nutrition is becoming an
important element of medical education (Young 1983). Kathleen Zolber, PhD, a nutrition professor
at Loma Linda University, became the first Adventist president of the ADA in 1982–1983. She was
instrumental in establishing the Evidence Analysis Library, a source for sound information for RDs,
and the publication of Food For All, authored by Lydia Sonnenberg, MS, RD and U.D. Register, PhD,
RD. This publication led the way in acceptance of vegetarian diets by nutrition professionals
The ADA did not always advocate for a vegetarian diet. In fact, Loma Linda University’s dietetics
program was not accredited until 1957, in part due to a belief that one could not be a real dietitian if
not able to prepare a typical meat-based American diet. However, in 1988 the ADA issued a position
statement favoring vegetarian diets, and have reaffirmed that position every four or five years since
then, usually expanding the length of the position each time. The most current statement reads:
It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned
vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide
health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.
These diets are
appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood,
adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally
sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources
and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and vegans are at
reduced risk of certain health conditions, including ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, certain types of cancer, and obesity. Low intake of saturated fat and high
intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, soy products, nuts, and seeds (all rich
in fiber and phytochemicals) are characteristics of vegetarian and vegan diets that produce
lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and better serum glucose control.
These factors contribute to reduction of chronic disease. Vegans need reliable sources of
vitamin B-12, such as fortified foods or supplements. (Melina et al. 2016)
Of the nine authors and reviewers of the ADA’s 1988 vegetarian position paper, five were
Adventist vegetarians and six took part in Loma Linda University’s First International Congress
on Vegetarian Nutrition in 1987 (History of the American Dietetic Association’s Vegetarian Position
Papers, Part Three: 1988). It was observed that at the First Congress nobody disputed that Seventh-day
Adventists have longer life expectancies than the general population, probably due to vegetarianism
and perhaps other elements of Adventist lifestyle (History of the American Dietetic Association’s
Vegetarian Position Papers, Part Three: 1988). Furthermore, for the 2016 ADA position paper on
vegetarian diet two of the four authors and reviewers were Adventist.
Early in 1954, SDA dietitians organized the Seventh-day Adventist Dietetics Association (SDADA)
One of the membership requirements for SDADA was membership in ADA. In the first three years,
they published many educational materials including pamphlets, manuals, recruitment slides and
scripts, posters, articles in denomination periodicals, and their own journal, the “Dietitian’s Digest.”
Paul Damazo, RD led in the production of the first ever color motion picture (30 min) on ADA dietetics
as a career, “Service of Love,” which had a major positive influence on the dietetic profession in favor
of SDA dietitians (History of the American Dietetic Association’s Vegetarian Position Papers, Part One:
Why Seventh-Day Adventists Want to Prove That Vegetarianism Is the Healthiest Diet, and How They
Influenced the Ada/Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 2012).
The SDADA has 40 publications in English and 252 library holdings, in the genres of handbooks
and manuals and popular works (Seventh-Day Adventist Dietetic Association 2010). Most of the
works are diet manuals and cookbooks. Examples include “Everyday Nutrition for Your Family” in 1961,
edited by Lydia Sonnenberg, a nutrition professor at LLU, the “SDADA Diet Manual”, and “It’s Your
World of Good Food” (vegetarian cookbook) in 1973. That cookbook was written by U. D. Register
and his wife, Helen Register, RD as an accompaniment to the national 30-min television program of
the same name, starring Art Linkletter. Finally, the book “About Nutrition” had 5 editions published
between 1971 and 1986.

3.3.2. International Vegetarian Congress
The First International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition took place in 1987 in Washington, D.C.
Lead organizers were nutrition and dietetics faculty at Loma Linda University, with support from the
Loma Linda University Medical Center, affiliated groups, and the food industry, such as Worthington
Foods. Subsequent meetings took place every five years, with the seventh taking place in Loma
Linda on February 2018. These congresses have played a leading role in changing the attitudes
of health care professionals (e.g., physicians, nutritionists, and dietitians) toward a vegetarian diet.
The Seventh Congress included more than 750 attendees from 36 countries, including presenters from
Harvard and Oxford (the EPIC study) Universities. Sponsors for the Seventh Congress included The
Harding-Buller Foundation of Worthington, the Loma Linda Brand (producing plant-based proteins for
more than 125 years), and Heritage Health Food/Worthington. Proceedings for the first six conferences
have been published as supplements to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (Wien et al. 2014).
Proceedings from the seventh conference will also be published in the same journal.
The popular USDA Food Guide Pyramid became the framework for the Vegetarian Food Guide
Pyramid, a publication of the General Conference Nutrition Council of SDAs. A somewhat similar
pyramid was presented at the Third Congress. The pyramid-shaped graphic illustration and supporting
document was specifically designed for vegetarians (Haddad et al. 1999). The five major plant
food groups (whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit, nuts, and seeds) form the trapezoid-shaped
lower portion of the pyramid. Optional food groups, which may be avoided by some vegetarians
(vegetable oils, dairy, eggs, and sweets), form the smaller, separate, triangle-shaped top portion of
the pyramid (Haddad et al. 1999). Lenore Hodges, PhD, RD and Georgia Hodgkin, EdD, RD, FADA,
authors of the Vegetarian Pyramid, changed the food graphic to the MyVegetarian Plate following
the change by the US Department of Agriculture. A summary from the Fifth Congress on Vegetarian
Nutrition included a recommendation that future U.S. dietary guidelines follow the lead of the 2005
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and emphasize food-based recommendations and thinking
to the full extent that evidence allows (Jacobs et al. 2009).
The Loma Linda expertise was acknowledged in a CRC Press book entitled, “Vegetarian Nutrition”,
authored predominantly by LLU faculty and edited by Dr. Joan Sabate (Vegetarian Nutrition 2001).
Furthermore, the vegetarian guidelines such as the Loma Linda pyramid and ADA vegetarian
recommendations have been adapted into guidelines by other organizations, such as the Japanese
Vegetarian Food Guide, the VegPyramid of the Scientific Society of Vegetarian Nutrition (SSNV-Italy),
and Power Plate by Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM-USA) (Baroni 2015).
4. Discussion
This review was not able to adequately cover the many individuals and organizations, both within
the United States and throughout much of the world, who have worked or continue to work to advance
the Adventist message on diet. However, we have introduced some of the key individuals in order
to demonstrate the thesis of an Adventist global impact on diet. These include Ellen G. White who
was instrumental in linking elements of the American diet reforms of the 1800’s to the theology and
practice of a ‘remnant’ church. Another key individual was John Harvey Kellogg, who operationalized
the Adventist message in a medically-oriented sanitarium. JH Kellogg and his family also worked
to operationalize the Adventist message through a food industry. Mervyn G. Hardinge led an effort
to demonstrate through research the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. Later Adventists were able
to point to those research findings in making professional recommendations for a vegetarian diet.
In addition to key historical figures, there are many organizations, such as food producers, schools,
and health care facilities which together truly have a global impact on diet. Thus, the Seventh-day
Adventist Church was able to incorporate and influence positive public health in society as well as
play a role in the mainstream financial life of many nations.
Indeed, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is well-known for its healthcare and educational
institutions spread around the globe, with a size and scope that belies its relatively small membership
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
18 of 25
numbers compared to other major world religions. There is no doubt that these institutions have an
influence on the lifestyle, including diet, of the millions of patients who are treated and on the millions
of students who are educated, particularly those who live on campus and/or eat in school cafeterias.
Unfortunately from an academic standpoint, there are surprisingly few peer-reviewed publications
which address the impact of SDA healthcare and educational systems on population-level diet.
Particularly as a result of combining religion/health/medicine in the form of sanitariums,
the SDA Church also began to produce vegetarian foods for the benefit of church members and
the general public. Both the formal SDA Church and Adventists working independently of Church
supervision, were heavily involved in developing and producing vegetarian food products in the
1900’s. Their involvement with food production resulted in the mass production of many different
foods, including breakfast cereals, meat analogues, and soy milk. The fact that much of current
production is no longer under control of the SDA Church, perhaps a disappointment for some within
the faith, is a demonstration of the growing wide-spread acceptance of vegetarian foods and a function
of substantial for-profit potential. However, the for-profit nature of the business has led to plant foods
such as high sugar cereals, which are not as healthy. The simple processing of the late 1800’s has given
way to more extensive processing and low nutritional value aspects, such as sugar, salt, stabilizing,
texture, and flavoring additives. Though the movement of nutrition science and policy since the
turn of the current century has been towards whole cereal grain consumption, the modern Kellogg
company has generally not embraced that movement as much as other breakfast cereal companies.
Regardless, it is appropriate to acknowledge the positive impact of developing several sectors of the
food industry. Furthermore, the Adventist food industry has contributed financially towards research
and advocacy, such as in supporting the International Congresses on Vegetarian Nutrition.
After presenting the health message for many decades based largely on the writings of Ellen G. White,
the Church dedicated resources to scientifically study the health benefits of the SDA lifestyle,
especially diet. With the passage of half a century, during which Adventist researchers were able
to secure millions of dollars of funding from the National Institutes of Health, there is now a large
body of peer-reviewed publications and the broader society generally accepts that there are benefits of
vegetarianism, independent of any religious message. It has been argued that a paradigm shift has
occurred within the professional world, from a model which viewed a vegetarian diet primarily in
terms of deficits compared to a meat-based diet, to a model in which a vegetarian diet is perceived as
most healthful and a meat-based diet has deficits, such as in phytochemicals and fiber (Sabate 2003).
As noted by Hardinge, societal “attitudes toward vegetarian diets have progressed from ridicule and
skepticism to condescending tolerance, to gradual and sometimes grudging acceptance, and finally
to acclaim” (Johnston 1999). Furthermore, there is also scientific evidence of a synergistic benefit of
religion and diet/lifestyle.
The Adventist Health Studies were designed as prospective cohort research studies. As outlined
in epidemiology textbooks, there are strengths and weaknesses associated with any study design
(Gordis 2014). Cohort studies are especially good at exploring associations between exposures (such as
diet) and multiple outcomes (such as disease and mortality). Drawbacks include cost (need to
enroll many subjects) and long time period needed to observe health outcome (since subjects do
not have a disease at beginning of study). Indeed, many cohort studies must be maintained for
decades to yield meaningful results. Cohort studies are not strong for describing a population (best to
use a cross-sectional study design) or in proving a relationship between two variables (best to use
randomized controlled trial study design, although often this is not practical or ethical). Potential biases
in cohort studies include selection biases, such as differential non-response and follow-up loss,
information biases, and as true of any study design, bias in analysis by the researchers and statisticians
if they have strong preconceptions (Gordis 2014). However, it is important to note that most Adventist
research has compared Adventists to other Adventists who have somewhat different lifestyles, beliefs,
or adherences. Cost is not a trivial issue, as Loma Linda University has needed to continue funding
 Religions 2018, 9, 251
19 of 25
the Adventist Health Studies even during periods when there was not funding from the National
Institutes of Health.
Although cohort studies generally do not need to represent a particular population, some have
questioned how well the Adventist Health Study represents Adventists in the United States,
particularly African Americans. It has been observed that there are regional differences in church
involvement, notably AHS participants in the southern US tend to be longer-time church members and
also more involved with church activities compared to California participants (Lampkin et al. 2009).
However, it is unlikely that such variations would invalidate observed relationships between diet and
health status. Furthermore, recruitment into all health-oriented studies can be influenced by broader
social forces such as racism and individual’s perception of health care and perceived sense of control
over their health (Lampkin et al. 2009).
The Adventist Church has been successful in presenting the personal health and spiritual
benefits of a lifestyle which includes a vegetarian diet. However, it can do more with regards to
diet. For example, future research could better quantify the costs and benefits at the society level of
vegetarians’ longer life. Greater organizational effort could be placed into advancing a “stewardship”
model of population diet, which would include examining and mitigating the environmental impacts of
modern food systems and more forcefully articulating the ethical and moral problems of a meat-based
diet within the context of global poverty and food shortages.
In summary, during the 1800’s the SDA church ultimately combined an evolving vegetarian
perspective, an active evangelistic agenda, and a health ministry program, such that a vegetarian
lifestyle was presented in many places around the world in a package that promoted a whole person
and good health. As concluding exemplars, the Blue Zone books sponsored by National Geographic
highlighted a handful of cities around the world in which a relatively large number of residents live
to be at least 100 years of age, extensive information is available on their website (https://www.
bluezones.com). The Blue Zones identified in the initial book (Buettner 2008) were: Sardinia, Italy;
Okinawa, Japan; Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica; Icaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California. Loma Linda
made that list as a representative of Adventists, who have been demonstrated though research to
have a longer and healthier life. Per the website, lessons learned from Loma Linda include the
importance of a healthy social circle, social engagement, family, faith, moderate physical activity,
and no smoking or alcohol. Food-specific lessons include plant-based diet, and consuming plenty of
legumes, including soy, whole grains, and nuts. Finally, The Adventists Trilogy, three films produced
by Martin Doblmeier which aired on PBS stations, presented not only on Adventist education and
global health missions; but started by showing how the biblically-based approach to health and
wholeness led to members living an extra 7–10 years longer than others. Thus, not only does the
Adventist perspective on diet emphasize the wholeness of mind and body; it is difficult to present
the Adventist message on diet without also presenting the whole Adventist “package” of theology,
worship, health ministry, and education.
