Abstract
Studies on the effects of consuming 100 % fruit juice on measures of glycaemic control are conflicting. The purpose of the present study was to system-
atically review and quantitatively summarise results from randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining effects of 100 % fruit juice on glucose–insulin
homeostasis. Eligible studies were identified from a systematic review of PubMed and EMBASE and hand searches of reference lists from reviews
and relevant papers. Using data from eighteen RCT, meta-analyses evaluated the mean difference in fasting blood glucose (sixteen studies), fasting
blood insulin (eleven studies), the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; seven studies) and glycosylated Hb (HbA1c; three
studies) between the 100 % fruit juice intervention and control groups using a random-effects model. Compared with the control group, 100 % fruit
juice had no significant effect on fasting blood glucose (−0·13 (95 % CI −0·28, 0·01) mmol/l; P = 0·07), fasting blood insulin (−0·24 (95 % CI −3·54,
3·05) pmol/l; P = 0·89), HOMA-IR (−0·22 (95 % CI −0·50, 0·06); P = 0·13) or HbA1c (−0·001 (95 % CI −0·38, 0·38) %; P = 0·28). Results from strati-
fied analyses and univariate meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associations between 100 % fruit juice and the measures of glucose control.
Overall, findings from this meta-analysis of RCT suggest a neutral effect of 100 % fruit juice on glycaemic control. These findings are consistent with
findings from some observational studies suggesting that consumption of 100 % fruit juice is not associated with increased risk of diabetes.
Key words: 100 % Fruit juice: Fasting blood glucose: Fasting blood insulin: Insulin sensitivity: Homeostatic model assessment of insulin
resistance
Worldwide, the number of people with diabetes is rising. In
2014, the estimated prevalence among adults was 8·5 %, which
is approximately double the prevalence of 4·7 % in 1980(1).
Due to its prevalence and associated complications, diabetes is
a well-recognised public health concern(2). Overweight and obes-
ity are the strongest risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D),
though lifestyle and dietary modification also are recognised strat-
egies that may delay or prevent development of the disease.
Controversy and uncertainty have been expressed within the
scientific community as to what effect, if any, 100 % fruit juice
may have on health including risk for diabetes(3). Pure (100 %)
fruit juices can be nutrient-dense foods providing K, Mg,
folate, Ca, vitamins A and C, and soluble fibre as well as an
array of bioactive substances including carotenoids and flavo-
noids(4–6). Nutritional guidance encourages consumption of
fruit as part of a balanced and healthy diet, although guidance
often recommends limited consumption of fruit in the form of
juice citing concerns over a lack of fibre and the potential for
excessive energy intake(7). Juices also tend to have moderately
high-glycaemic index ratings(8), indicating a relatively rapid and
high post-prandial glucose response as compared with foods
with a lower glycaemic index, and diets lower in these types

 of simple carbohydrates may be relevant for the prevention
and management of some chronic diseases including T2D(9).
However, results from in vitro and animal studies suggest
that
polyphenols
may
favourably
affect
glucose–insulin
homeostasis through a variety of mechanisms(10). The net
effect of 100 % fruit juice on glucose metabolism and biomar-
kers of diabetes therefore reflects a complex interplay of
numerous factors.
Results from human studies of associations between 100 %
fruit juice consumption and risk of T2D or effects on diabetes
biomarkers have been conflicting. A recent meta-analysis of
thirteen prospective cohorts reported no association between
consumption of fruit juice and incident T2D(11). When further
adjusted for obesity, the meta-analysis showed a 7 % increased
risk for incident T2D, though the presence of significant het-
erogeneity limits the quality of this evidence(11).
No meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT)
with a specific focus on 100 % fruit juices has been identified.
Wang et al.(12) reported finding no significant effect on gly-
caemic control and blood insulin in a meta-analysis of twelve
RCT collectively described as 100 % fruit juice. The analysis
included studies using juice products other than 100 %
fruit juice(12), namely beverages prepared from freeze-dried
whole fruit which provided a substantial source of dietary
fibre(13,14), beverages prepared from fruit juice sweetened
using no-energy sweeteners(15,16), and a study in which
both the test and control beverages were prepared from
100 % fruit juice(17). The identified meta-analysis therefore
was not exclusively based on RCT of 100 % fruit juice com-
pared with a non-juice control. Several years have passed
since completion of the meta-analysis and recent clinical trials
examining the effects of 100 % fruit juice consumption on
glucose–insulin homeostasis provide further insight into the
role of juice on biomarkers of diabetes risk.
The purpose of the present study was to systematically
review the literature to identify RCT in which effects of 100 %
fruit juice on measures of glucose control and insulin sensitiv-
ity have been examined and, based on the totality of evidence,
to re-evaluate in a meta-analysis the effects of 100 % fruit juice
on these biomarkers for diabetes risk.
Methods
Literature search and study selection
The present systematic review and meta-analysis followed the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement(18). A comprehensive lit-
erature search was conducted to identify clinical studies exam-
ining the relationship between the consumption of 100 % fruit
juice and measures of glucose–insulin homeostasis, with no
exclusions based on age, ethnicity or health status of the
study population. A pre-specified protocol is not available
for this study. The search of PubMed was conducted with
terms (juice[TIAB] OR juices[TIAB]) AND (‘controlled
trial’ OR ‘clinical trial’ OR crossover OR cross-over OR ran-
dom*) with no limits other than English-language papers. The
search of EMBASE was conducted using similar terms. Terms
for specific measures of glucose control or insulin sensitivity
were not included in the search string to allow for iden-
tification of studies in which measures of interest were col-
lected as secondary outcomes or in the course of routine
patient monitoring. The initial search was conducted on 23
March 2015, and searches were updated on 14 April 2016.
Supplemental literature searches included review of reference
lists in relevant studies and pertinent review articles and
correspondence with researchers in the field.
The search results were screened independently by two
investigators (M. M. M., E. C. B.) for eligible studies and dis-
crepancies were resolved by consensus. Clinical trials were eli-
gible if the following criteria were met: (1) the trial was
randomised and conducted in human subjects; (2) the trial
was a controlled intervention providing 100 % fruit juice and
a control beverage (e.g. sugar/carbohydrate or energy-matched
beverage, water, or no beverage); (3) the fruit juice consumed
was identified as 100 % fruit juice (including single-strength
juice prepared from concentrate or a blend of 100 % fruit
juices) or any juice specified by name such as, but not limited
to, apple, blueberry, cherry, cranberry, grape, grapefruit,
orange, pear, pomegranate or strawberry juice; (4) subjects
consumed 100 % fruit juice for a minimum of 2 weeks; (5)
outcome data for at least one measure of glucose control or
insulin sensitivity were reported; and (6) reported outcomes
included change from baseline values or baseline and endpoint
values with error terms. Tomato juice was not included as a
fruit juice in this analysis as it is typically marketed as a vege-
table juice.
Data extraction
All eligible studies were reviewed and pertinent data were
extracted, including: name of the first author, publication
year, study design, geographic location of the intervention,
demographic and health characteristics of the study population
(e.g. age, sex, presence of obesity or a chronic disease, BMI),
sample size, intervention duration, juice type, a description
of the control product, and outcomes measured. Additional
data extracted from the studies included sugar content of
the 100 % fruit juice and control beverages, volume of juice
consumed per d, baseline fasting blood glucose level, informa-
tion on randomisation, double-blinding, and withdrawals and
dropouts to develop quality scores of each study based on
the Jadad criteria(19). Information on funding was reviewed
to determine if the research was completed with support
from industry funding, including donation of study product.
Data extraction was completed independently by one investi-
gator and reviewed for accuracy by another (M. M. M. and
E. C. B. or K. A. B.). The extracted information included
that provided by study investigators in response to requests
for missing data and study details(20–23). Fasting blood glucose,
fasting blood insulin, the homeostatic model assessment of
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glycosylated Hb (HbA1c) and
other reported measures of glucose–insulin homeostasis (oral
glucose tolerance test, insulinogenic and Matsuda indices)
were captured as change from baseline or as baseline and post-
intervention values. Fasting glucose values were converted to

 mmol/l assuming 1 mg/dl = 0·05551 mmol/l. Fasting insulin
values were converted to pmol/l assuming 1 µU/ml = 6·0
pmol/l(24).
Statistical analysis
A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of con-
sumption of 100 % fruit juice on each measure of glucose con-
trol or insulin sensitivity reported in at least three studies. The
meta-analysis evaluated the mean difference from baseline and
end of treatment values between the 100 % juice treatment
and control group of fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insu-
lin, HOMA-IR and HbA1c. The I2 statistic was used to assess
statistical heterogeneity between studies.
For studies not reporting the change from baseline to the
end of intervention in both the treatment and control groups,
the mean difference was calculated as (Treatmentend −
Treatmentbaseline) − (Controlend − Controlbaseline). The method
described by Curtin et al.(25) was used to estimate the mean dif-
ference and associated standard error from the combined par-
allel and cross-over studies. A pooled estimate of the variance
of the mean difference was estimated for each study. For par-
allel studies, the estimate was derived using the reported esti-
mates of the standard errors or the calculated standard
errors as derived from the reported CI estimates. For cross-
over studies when estimates of the standard deviation (or
standard error) were only available for baseline and post-
intervention measurements, the pooled variance was estimated
using standard errors for the intervention and control groups
and an imputed correlation coefficient of 0·5(26,27) following
the approach described by Higgins & Green(27). The correl-
ation coefficient (0·5) assumed in the derivation was similar
to the average coefficient derived from a study in which
variances were provided for baseline, treatment end, and
change from baseline measures of fasting blood glucose and
HOMA-IR; the correlation coefficient for fasting blood insulin
derived from this study was 0·7(28). Hence, a sensitivity ana-
lysis assuming a correlation coefficient of 0·7 was conducted
for fasting blood insulin.
A random-effects model was used to determine the mean
and 95 % CI of differences in changes from baseline between
100 % juice and control groups. The approach described in
DerSimonian & Laird(29) was used to conduct the random-
effects model. Stratified analyses by study characteristics
were planned a priori to investigate sources of heterogeneity
and univariate meta-regressions were conducted for further
investigation. For each of the biomarkers of diabetes, analyses
were conducted for type of fruit juice (apple, berry, blend, cit-
rus, grape, pomegranate), type of control beverage (beverage
matched for carbohydrate or sugar and/or energy, beverage
without carbohydrate or sugar and/or energy, no beverage),
volume of intervention beverage (as reported in the original
studies for the meta-regression analysis, and categorised as
≤250 ml/d, >250 ml/d in the stratified analysis), duration of

Publication bias was assessed for outcomes with more than
ten studies by visual examination of funnel plots of the stand-
ard error of the mean difference v. the mean difference and the
Egger’s regression asymmetry test(30). Sensitivity analyses to
explore the influence of a single study on each meta-analysis
were conducted by computing the meta-analysis estimates,
omitting one study at a time. Level of significance was defined
as P < 0·05. All statistical analyses were completed with
STATA, version 12.1 (StataCorp LLC).
Results
Literature search, study characteristics
A total of eighteen RCT of 100 % fruit juice were eligible for
inclusion in the present review (Fig. 1). Characteristics of the
eighteen RCT of 100 % fruit juice and measures of glucose
control or insulin sensitivity included in the meta-analysis are
presented in Table 1(31). Two publications provided relevant
outcomes from the same clinical trial and results from both
publications were captured for the analysis(28,32). In two of
the identified studies, results of two comparisons of potential
interest were presented(33,34), though in order to avoid double-
counting of studies, one comparison from each was selected
for inclusion in the meta-analysis(33). In a parallel-design study
of the effects of Concord grape juice, the energy-matched
control beverage (v. a no-beverage control) was selected for
the control group(33). In a cross-over study providing clear or
cloudy apple juice within two of the five study arms(34), clear
apple juice was selected for the test group as this type of juice
is assumed to be more commonly consumed.
Sixteen of the eighteen included trials reported data for
fasting blood glucose(20–23,28,32,33,35–43), eleven reported fasting
blood insulin(21,28,34–37,39–43), seven reported HOMA-IR(28,36,
37,39,42–44) and three reported HbA1c(28,35,45). Duration of sup-
plementation ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months, with the
majority of studies providing the intervention for a period of
8 weeks or more. The studies were predominantly conducted
in Europe (n 8) or North America (n 7), with the remaining
three studies conducted in Asia (n 3).
All but five studies included a test and control arm; four
studies included three arms(23,33,41,42) and one study included
five arms(34). Although all studies were controlled, the type
of control beverage provided varied across studies. Across
the eighteen studies, twelve indicated some level of industry
funding including financial support and/or test products.
Six studies had a Jadad score of ≥4(23,28,32,33,37,39,45), while
the remaining trials (twelve of eighteen) had a Jadad score of

 <4. As shown in Table 2, each study was identified by the
investigators as a randomised study, though only five provided
the methods of random sequence generation. Eleven of the
studies were reported to be double-blind, and eight of these
detailed a method regarded as appropriate within the Jadad cri-
teria. The remaining eight studies were open label or single
blind. Descriptions of study withdrawals, including both the
number and reason, were provided in fourteen of the eighteen
studies. No studies described inappropriate randomisation or
double-blinding methods. High risk for attrition bias was iden-
tified in three studies and a cross-over study with an unspeci-
fied washout period between treatments presented unclear risk
for bias.
Effect of 100 % fruit juice on fasting blood glucose
In the meta-analysis of fasting blood glucose data reported in
sixteen RCT, consumption of 100 % fruit juice had no sig-
nificant effect on fasting blood glucose compared with the
control treatment (−0·13 (95 % CI −0·28, 0·01) mmol/l;
P = 0·07) (Fig. 2); there was moderate to high heterogeneity
among the studies (P < 0·01, I2 = 70·6). Stratified analyses
(Table 3) used to evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity
resulted in mean difference estimates ranging from −0·70 to
0·20. Associations that were statistically significant in strati-
fied analyses included an intervention of 2–7 weeks (−0·20
(95 % CI −0·38, −0·08) mmol/l; P = 0·03, I2 = 57·0), and
studies with a Jadad score of <4 (−0·23 (95 % CI −0·43,
−0·03) mmol/l; P = 0·03, I2 = 74·8); in both of these strati-
fied analyses, fasting blood glucose was lowered by consump-
tion of 100 % fruit juice compared with the control group.
The only factor with a statistically significant regression coef-
ficient in the univariate meta-regressions was study location;
therefore no multivariate meta-regression analyses were
conducted.
Effect of 100 % fruit juice on fasting blood insulin
Compared with the control treatment, consumption of 100 %
fruit juice had no significant effect on fasting blood insulin
(−0·24 (95 % CI −3·54, 3·05) pmol/l; P = 0·89) with no het-
erogeneity (P = 0·52, I2 = 0) in the eleven RCT included in the
analysis (Fig. 3). Stratified analyses of the effects of 100 % fruit
juice on fasting blood insulin resulted in mean difference esti-
mates ranging from −8·50 to 11·6, none of which was statis-
tically significant (Table 4).

 Effect of 100 % fruit juice on insulin resistance
The effect of 100 % fruit juice on HOMA-IR was not signifi-
cant (−0·22 (95 % CI −0·50, 0·06); P = 0·13) with moderate
to high heterogeneity (P < 0·01, I2 = 73·9) (Fig. 4). Stratified
analyses resulted in mean difference estimates ranging from
−1·60 to 0·50 (Table 5). In stratified analyses, HOMA-IR
was significantly lower in the 100 % fruit juice groups com-
pared with the control group in studies in which pomegranate
juice was consumed (−0·37 (95 % CI −0·57, −0·18); P <
0·005, I2 = 0) or intervention duration was 2–7 weeks (−0·41
(95 % CI −0·59, −0·23); P < 0·005, I2 = 0). In the univariate
meta-regressions, only volume of juice intervention showed a
statistically significant
inverse association with change in
HOMA-IR (regression coefficient = −0·002; P = 0·01).
Effect of 100 % fruit juice on glycosylated Hb
The effect of 100 % fruit juice on HbA1c was not significant
(−0·001 (95 % CI −0·38, 0·38) %; P > 0·99) with low hetero-
geneity (P < 0·01, I2 = 22·3) (Fig. 5). Stratified analyses resulted
in mean difference estimates ranging from −0·11 to 0·60
(Table 6). No statistically significant associations were observed
in the stratified analyses or univariate meta-regressions.
Publication bias
The potential for publication bias was investigated through vis-
ual inspection of funnel plots for analyses with a sufficient
number of studies, namely fasting blood glucose and fasting
blood insulin. Visual inspection of funnel plots for fasting
blood glucose showed that all but three studies(22,36,38) fell
inside the funnel. These three studies had relatively smaller
mean difference estimates indicative of statistically significant
beneficial effects of the intervention beverages. Sensitivity ana-
lyses in which each study was removed from the analysis indi-
vidually or all three simultaneously resulted in a mean
difference that was still negative and not significantly different
from zero (data not shown), thus suggesting no publication
bias. Results from the Egger’s test supported this conclusion
for both fasting blood glucose and insulin (Fig. 6; P = 0·80
and 0·38, respectively).
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses that excluded individual RCT resulted in
estimates similar to values derived from all studies, although
some mean differences became statistically significant. In the
case of fasting blood glucose, omission of either of three stud-
ies(33,39,42) resulted in overall mean difference estimates that
were statistically significant and indicative of a beneficial effect
of 100 % fruit juice consumption (mean difference of −0·16;
95 % CI −0·31, −0·005). The effects of 100 % fruit juice on
fasting blood insulin or HOMA-IR were not found to be sen-
sitive to any particular study included in the meta-analysis. The
sensitivity analysis conducted for fasting blood insulin assuming

 a correlation coefficient of 0·7 in the derivation of the pooled

100 % fruit juice on fasting blood insulin (results not shown).
Discussion
The present systematic review and meta-analysis provides a
comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the relationship
between 100 % fruit juice and measures of glycaemic control.
Results from this meta-analysis of eighteen RCT show no sig-
nificant effect of 100 % fruit juice on fasting blood glucose,
fasting blood insulin, insulin resistance as evaluated by
HOMA-IR or HbA1c. Additionally, results of stratified ana-
lyses confirm the lack of consistent associations between
100 % fruit juice consumption and these markers for diabetes.
The absence of any clear adverse or beneficial effect of 100 %
fruit juice on markers of diabetes in the present meta-analysis
of available RCT suggests a largely neutral role of 100 % fruit
juice on glucose–insulin homeostasis.
The findings of the present meta-analysis are generally con-
sistent with a 2014 meta-analysis by Wang et al.(12). Overall,
seven studies were included in both the previous and the pre-
sent meta-analysis(20,21,33,35,37,41,45). The eleven additional trials
included in the present analysis reflect recent additions to the
literature as well as studies not captured by Wang et al. (12). As
in the present analysis, no significant effect on glycaemic con-
trol measured by fasting glucose, fasting insulin or HbA1c was
reported in the meta-analysis of studies identified as 100 %
fruit juice by Wang et al.(12). In contrast to the present analysis
in which no effect of 100 % fruit juice on HOMA-IR was
found, a significant increase in HOMA-IR was reported by
Wang et al.(12) based on data from three trials, only one of
which was considered eligible for the present meta-analysis(45).
The other two HOMA-IR values in the meta-analysis by Wang
et al.(12) include a value from a study not meeting our inclusion
criteria(16), and a value attributed to the trial by Sumner et al.(45)
which was neither reported in that paper nor noted as sourced
from the study authors. The value attributed to Sumner
accounted for 78 % of the weighted mean HOMA-IR in the
meta-analysis by Wang et al.(12), and therefore largely explains
the difference between the previous and present analyses.

 for diabetes are also consistent with findings from a meta-analysis
of prospective cohorts showing that consumption of 100 % fruit
juice is not associated with increased risk of T2D(46) and findings
from a more recent meta-analysis of cohorts in which diabetes
was clinically verified(11).
Stratified analyses were conducted as part of the present
meta-analysis to investigate specific conditions that may adversely
or beneficially affect glucose–insulin homeostasis. The stratifi-
cations included parameters to differentiate among the juice
intervention, study population and study characteristics.
Consistent with the primary findings, results from the stratified
analyses showed no significant effect of 100 % fruit juice on
fasting blood insulin and HbA1c, though results of both ana-
lyses, and in particular HbA1c, were limited by the small num-
ber of studies. Stratified analyses of fasting blood glucose
showed a significantly greater reduction from baseline with
100 % fruit juice compared with the control in trials with an
intervention duration of 2–7 weeks and trials with a Jadad
score <4. The significant effect observed in shorter studies
could reflect higher compliance by study participants over a
shorter study intervention. However, a cross-tabulation of
the studies with fasting blood glucose data by these two factors
reveals that all studies with a shorter duration of intervention
(2–7 weeks) also had a Jadad score <4, which is an indicator of
a lower methodological quality trial. As detailed in the review
of Jadad scores by studies (Table 2), many of the RCT suggest-
ing a beneficial effect of 100 % fruit juice on fasting blood
glucose had one or more major sources of potential bias,
and in particular high or unclear performance bias. Findings
in the stratified analyses therefore provide some though limited
support for a beneficial effect of fruit juice on fasting blood
glucose. Stratified analyses of HOMA-IR also showed a signifi-
cantly greater reduction from baseline with 100 % fruit juice
compared with the control in trials with an intervention dur-
ation of 2–7 weeks, and additionally in trials with pomegranate
juice. The significance of these findings also is limited, as each
analysis was based on data from only two studies and did not
notably reduce heterogeneity. The inverse association of vol-
ume of 100 % fruit juice with HOMA-IR identified in univari-
ate meta-regressions also is an indicator of potentially beneficial
effects of 100 % fruit juice, albeit very small as evidenced by
the relatively small regression coefficient.
A variety of juices was provided as test beverages across
the studies and the types and concentrations of some bioac-
tives in fruit juice vary across fruit juice type. For example,
pomegranate juice is a unique source of ellagitannins, including
punicalagins(47). Among citrus juices, grapefruit juice is a con-
centrated source of naringin while the primary flavonoid in
orange juice is hesperidin(48,49). Cranberries are a source of
polyphenols including procyanidins, anthocyanins, quercetin
and myricitrin(50), the primary anthocyanins in many grape
juices are glucosides of cyanidin or delphinidin(49,51), and
apple juice is a source of quercetin(49,51). The amount of
fruit juice consumed during the dietary interventions was
also highly variable, with juice intake of approximately two
cups or more (480 to 595 ml) per d in nine of the interven-
tions and one cup or less in six studies (<250 ml). The amount
of sugars provided by the juices ranged from 22 to 97 g. The

 ‘100 % fruit juice’ category therefore represents a heteroge-
neous food group and differences in the type and composition
of fruit juices may be important when considering the physio-
logical effects of fruit juice, including effects on glycaemic con-
trol and insulin sensitivity. Stratified analyses, however,
showed no clear differences across categorisations and hetero-
geneity was not notably reduced.
The RCT of 100 % fruit juices identified in the present review
also used a variety of control products, including energy-
containing beverages matched for sugar or carbohydrate con-
tent, sugar-free beverages containing non-energy-containing
sweeteners or only water, and, in some studies, no beverage.
Peluso & Palmery(52) have noted that selection of an appropriate
placebo in studies of the postprandial response to fruit juice is
critical, with energy and sugar-matched beverages (including
proportions of glucose and fructose) providing an appropriate
control to assess the effects of bioactives in juice, and a water
beverage providing an appropriate control to assess the effects
of juice as a whole(52). Stratified analyses of fasting blood glu-
cose by these control group comparisons did not result in
significant effects, suggesting that neither the non-sugar juice
components nor the juice itself had an effect on fasting blood
glucose in the clinical trials.
The effects of 100 % fruit juice on measures of glucose con-
trol or insulin sensitivity varied little across study population
characteristics including baseline fasting blood glucose levels.
Body weight status of study participants is another important
characteristic as overweight and obesity are recognised risk fac-
tors for the development of T2D due to decreased sensitivity
of non-adipose tissue to insulin(2). In all but one of the studies
with reported BMI data(34), mean BMI exceeded 25 kg/m2,
indicating that the study populations were generally overweight
or obese individuals. The available reported data on body
weight or BMI indicate no differences in change between
the juice intervention and control groups. In addition to weight
status, the study populations also represented a variety of
health states including healthy, diabetic, hypertensive/pre-
hypertensive, hypercholesterolaemic, and adults with various
other conditions. While many of these conditions are common
co-morbidities of overweight and obesity, it is difficult to

 delineate their independent role in the relationship between
100 % fruit juice consumption and diabetes risk.
Many methods are used to assess bias in RCT when
conducting a meta-analysis, including the Jadad criteria(53).
Based on the Jadad criteria, which reflect randomisation, dou-
ble blinding, and recording of withdrawals and dropouts(19),
the majority of studies in this meta-analysis had an unclear
risk of selection bias due to absence of a description of the
random sequence generation. A relatively high proportion of
studies were non-double-blind (seven of eighteen) which
points to a high risk of performance bias. Regarding attrition
bias, the majority of studies (fourteen of eighteen) provided
information on participant disposition throughout the study
and the data largely indicate low risk of bias, though attrition
was relatively high (20–32 %) in three studies(34,37,42) and the
remaining studies have unknown or potentially high risk for
this source of bias. Other potential sources of bias not cap-
tured in the Jadad criteria but noted upon review of the studies
include unknown or potentially high bias due to an unspecified
washout period between interventions(34).
Despite concerns that 100 % fruit juice may have adverse
effects on glycaemic control, primarily as a result of sugars
in these beverages, results from this analysis of RCT do not
support a conclusion that 100 % fruit juice adversely affects
glucose–insulin homeostasis. The results largely indicate no
effect on glycaemic control. Some stratified analyses suggest
the possibility of a beneficial effect of 100 % fruit juice on fast-
ing blood glucose and HOMA-IR, though the evidence is
inconclusive based on limitations of the available data. A
mechanism by which 100 % fruit juice may have a favourable
effect on measures of glycaemic control is not clearly known,
though some evidence, largely from in vitro and animal studies,
indicates that polyphenols may favourably affect glucose–
insulin homeostasis through a variety of mechanisms including
inhibition of glucose absorption, stimulation of insulin secretion
from the pancreas and change in glucose release from the liver,
activation of insulin receptors and glucose uptake by cells, and
modulation of cell signalling pathways and gene expression(10).
Further research is needed to understand these effects.
A strength of the present meta-analysis is the large number of
randomised, controlled clinical trials identified for inclusion in the
quantitative analysis. The broad though focused search strategy
identified studies in which glucose metabolism outcomes were
primary outcomes as well as studies in which the measures
were collected as secondary outcomes or routine monitoring dur-
ing the clinical trials. The large number of identified studies
allowed for stratified analyses by similar characteristics of the
intervention, study population, and overall study design to further
explore effects of 100 % fruit juice on diabetes biomarkers.
However, sample sizes in many stratified analyses were relatively
small, and many analyses may result in detection of spurious asso-
ciations, therefore these findings must be interpreted with caution.
Although the total number of identified studies was rela-
tively large, variability among some parameters of study inter-
ventions, populations, and overall study design are limitations
of this analysis and must be considered when interpreting the
findings. The included studies reflect a diverse range of juice
interventions (both type of juice and amount consumed), inter-
vention durations, variable dietary restrictions throughout the
intervention period (and typically no restrictions on consump-
tion of other types of 100 % fruit juice), study populations
with a range of health conditions, and studies with potential
for some bias. Variability in these factors and potentially
other factors not considered in the analysis contribute to the
observed heterogeneity among studies, thus making it difficult
to conclusively interpret the findings.

 Conclusion
In conclusion, the available RCT indicate that repeated intake
of 100 % fruit juice does not have a significant effect on
glycaemic control or measures of insulin resistance. These
findings from RCT of markers for diabetes are consistent
with findings from some observational studies suggesting
that consumption of 100 % fruit juice is neutral regarding

 risk of T2D. Results from stratified analyses and univariate
meta-regressions also largely showed no significant associa-
tions between 100 % fruit juice and these measures of glucose
control. High-quality studies of glucose–insulin homeostasis
measures monitored in well-defined and controlled popula-
tions are needed to further clarify the effects of 100 % fruit
juice on diabetes risk as evaluated by these biomarkers. Such
research focused on commonly consumed juices served in
moderate daily portions reflective of prudent dietary guidance
would provide important information to further our under-
standing of the role of 100 % fruit juice on glycaemic control.
