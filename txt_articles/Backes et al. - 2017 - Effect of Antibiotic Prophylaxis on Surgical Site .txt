IMPORTANCE Following clean (class I, not contaminated) surgical procedures, the rate of
surgical site infection (SSI) should be less than approximately 2%. However, an infection rate
of 12.2% has been reported following removal of orthopedic implants used for treatment of
fractures below the knee.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a single dose of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis on
the incidence of SSIs following removal of orthopedic implants used for treatment of
fractures below the knee.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial
including 500 patients aged 18 to 75 years with previous surgical treatment for
fractures below the knee who were undergoing removal of orthopedic implants from 19
hospitals (17 teaching and 2 academic) in the Netherlands (November 2014-September
2016), with a follow-up of 6 months (final follow-up, March 28, 2017). Exclusion criteria were
an active infection or fistula, antibiotic treatment, reimplantation of osteosynthesis material
in the same session, allergy for cephalosporins, known kidney disease, immunosuppressant
use, or pregnancy.
INTERVENTIONS A single preoperative intravenous dose of 1000 mg of cefazolin (cefazolin
group, n = 228) or sodium chloride (0.9%; saline group, n = 242).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was SSI within 30 days as measured by
the criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Secondary outcome
measures were functional outcome, health-related quality of life, and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS Among 477 randomized patients (mean age, 44 years [SD, 15]; women, 274 [57%];
median time from orthopedic implant placement, 11 months [interquartile range, 7-16]),
470 patients completed the study. Sixty-six patients developed an SSI (14.0%): 30 patients
(13.2%) in the cefazolin group vs 36 in the saline group (14.9%) (absolute risk difference,
−1.7 [95% CI, −8.0 to 4.6], P = .60).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing surgery for removal of
orthopedic implants used for treatment of fractures below the knee, a single preoperative
dose of intravenous cefazolin compared with saline did not reduce the risk of surgical site
infection within 30 days following implant removal.

etal implants are often used in open reduction and
internal fixation of fractures. With the use of antibi-
otic prophylaxis the surgical site infection (SSI) rate
followingfracturefixationwasreducedfrom8.3%to3.6%,and
therefore,antibioticprophylaxisisroutinelyadministeredprior
to fracture surgery.1
In most patients, removal of implants is not routinely in-
dicated following fracture healing. Still, removal of orthope-
dic implants is one of the most frequently performed ortho-
pedic procedures worldwide. For example, 28% to 79% of
implants are removed following lower leg, ankle, or foot frac-
ture surgery.2-8 SSI rates of 0% to 20% following removal of
orthopedic implants have been reported, but in only 1 of these
studies SSI was the primary outcome measure.2-7,9,10 In that
study, the overall SSI rate following removal of orthopedic im-
plants was 11.6%, with the highest incidence in the foot, ankle,
or lower leg region (12.2%).3
Because removal of orthopedic implants is considered a
clean (without skin contamination or local infection) surgical
procedure with an expected SSI rate of 2% to 3.3%, preopera-
tive administration of antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated
according to the latest guidelines of the US Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC).11-14 However, higher SSI
rates than anticipated (compared with rates following frac-
ture fixation) are reported following removal of orthopedic
implants.2-7,9,10,15 Due to these high SSI rates, some advocate
that antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered prior to re-
moval of orthopedic implants.15 Despite the large number of
implant removal procedures performed worldwide, there is in-
sufficient evidence on this subject and the potential benefi-
cial effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on SSI rates following re-
moval of orthopedic implants.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single
dose of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of SSIs follow-
ing removal of orthopedic implants used for treatment of frac-
tures below the knee, the area with highest rate of infection.
The study tested the hypothesis that a single dose of prophy-
lactic antibiotics would lower the SSI rate following orthope-
dic implant removal in the lower leg.
Methods
Trial Oversight and Design
The Wound Infections Following Implant Removal (WIFI) trial
was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in
which patients undergoing removal of orthopedic implants to
treat fractures below the knee were recruited. The trial pro-
tocol and statistical analysis plan are available in the eAppen-
dix in Supplement 1. The study protocol was approved by the
medical ethics committee at the Academic Medical Center of
the University of Amsterdam and published.16 After publica-
tion of the study protocol, type 1 and 2 diabetes was added as
a second stratification factor and approved by the medical eth-
ics committee. The study was conducted according to the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki17 and in accordance with
the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act. Inde-
pendent monitors assessed the overall performance of study
conduct and other issues. The trial was performed in 17 teach-
ing hospitals and 2 academic hospitals in the Netherlands
(eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Patient Population
Patients aged 18 to 75 years who were undergoing removal of
orthopedic implants following treatment of fractures of the
foot, ankle, and lower leg were eligible for inclusion. Exclu-
sion criteria were an active SSI or fistula, antibiotic treatment
at the time of implant removal for a concomitant disease or in-
fection, reimplantation of material in the same session, an al-
lergy for cephalosporins, a known kidney disease, immuno-
suppressant use, or pregnancy. Patients were screened for
eligibility at the outpatient clinic. Inclusion ran from Novem-
ber 2014 through September 2016, follow-up ran from
November 2014 through March 2017, and the study was ended
after inclusion of 500 patients. Date of final follow-up was
March 28, 2017.
Intervention, Randomization, and Blinding
After obtaining written informed consent, eligible patients
were randomly assigned to receive either 1000 mg of cefazo-
lin in a bolus of sodium chloride (0.9%) intravenously (ce-
fazolin group) or a bolus of sodium chloride (0.9%) intrave-
nously (saline group) preoperatively. This bolus, which was
identical in appearance, was prepared and administered 15
to 60 minutes prior to incision in the holding or operation
theater by the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist in the
absence of the surgeon. The dose of 1000 mg of cefazolin
was in accordance with guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis
in orthopedic trauma surgery.13,18
Participants were assigned to the cefazolin group or the
salinegroupina1:1ratio.Randomizationwasperformedwithin
eachsiteandrandomizationsequencewasgeneratedbyadedi-
cated computer randomization software program (Alea Soft-
ware, Netherlands Cancer Institute), version 2.2. Randomiza-
tion was stratified by center and presence of diabetes mellitus
and performed preoperatively by a theater assistant or the an-
esthesiologist using a dedicated, password-protected, Secure
Sockets Layer–encrypted website, ensuring allocation con-
cealment for the patient and the surgeon.
Key Points
Question Does antibiotic prophylaxis with a single preoperative
dose of intravenous cefazolin (1000 mg) reduce the risk of surgical
site infection following removal of orthopedic implants used for
treatment of fractures below the knee?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 470
patients who were undergoing surgery for removal of orthopedic
implants used for treatment of below-the-knee fractures,
surgical site infection occurred in 12.9% of patients in
the cefazolin group and 14.9% of patients in the saline group,
a nonsignificant difference.
Meaning A single preoperative dose of intravenous cefazolin did
not reduce the risk of surgical site infection within 30 days
following removal of orthopedic implants used for treatment of
fractures below the knee.

 Outcomes
Primary outcome was an SSI within 30 days after removal of
orthopedic implants as defined by the criteria applied by the
CDC.12,13 Each SSI was characterized as superficial or deep.
A superficial SSI involves only skin or subcutaneous tissue of
the incision and at least 1 of the following: (1) purulent drain-
age from the incision with or without laboratory confirma-
tion; (2) organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained
culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision;
(3) at least 1 of the following signs or symptoms of infection:
pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat;
and deliberate opening of superficial incision by surgeon
unless incision is culture-negative; (4) diagnosis with
subsequent treatment for superficial SSI by a (orthopedic)
trauma surgeon.
A deep SSI involves deep tissues and at least 1 of the fol-
lowing: (1) purulent drainage from the incision; (2) the
incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened
by a surgeon when the patient has at least 1 of the following
signs or symptoms: temperature higher than 38°C or local-
ized pain or tenderness, unless site is culture-negative;
(3) an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the
incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation,
or by histopathologic or radiologic examination; (4) diagno-
sis with subsequent treatment for deep SSI by a (orthopedic)
trauma surgeon.12
Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life
(measured by the EuroQol 5-Dimension 3-Level [EQ-5D-3L]
questionnaire [index range, 0-1; 1 indicates maximal health-
related quality of life]),19 functional outcome (assessed with
the Lower Extremity Functional Scale [LEFS]),20 and patient
satisfaction with treatment (measured using a visual analog
scale [VAS], ranging from 0 [completely not satisfied] to 10
[completely satisfied]). Questionnaires were sent electroni-
cally preoperatively (EQ-5D-3L and LEFS) and 6 months fol-
lowing the procedure (EQ-5D-3L, LEFS, and VAS). If a partici-
pant did not have access to the internet, questionnaires were
sent by regular mail. All participants received at least 1 re-
minder in case a questionnaire was not completed.
Patients were seen routinely by a physician (a nonmem-
ber of the surgical team) who was blinded to patient treat-
ment group assignment at the outpatient clinic within 4 weeks
after the surgical procedure. Patients also reported on wound
problems in their online questionnaires and were contacted
by telephone if a problem was reported on the questionnaire
by a physician. Signs of SSI (warmth, redness, pain, swelling,
wound dehiscence, purulent drainage, or temperature >38°C)
were documented on a case report form. Patients were in-
structedtovisittheemergencydepartmentoroutpatientclinic
sooner in case of any signs of SSI. In case of SSI, appropriate
treatment was started according to local policy.
Data Collection
Patientandsurgicalcharacteristicswerecollected.Patientchar-
acteristics were sex, age at the time of removal of orthopedic
implants, location of index fracture, SSI following the index
fracture, reason of implant removal, body mass index (BMI;
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared), diabetes, and use of alcohol or drugs or nicotine.
Treatment regimens in case of SSI were documented; subdi-
vided into 4 categories: local wound care without antibiotics,
with oral antibiotics, with intravenous antibiotics, or with sur-
gical debridement.
The following surgical characteristics were documented:
time from initial fracture treatment with orthopedic implant
placement to implant removal, location of removal, com-
plete or partial removal of implants, duration of surgery, tour-
niquet use, and resident or consultant performing surgery. If
a wound or perioperative culture was collected, the cultured
microorganisms were documented.
Missing data for the LEFS questionnaire was handled ac-
cording to the instructions of the developers of the question-
naire; up to 4 items (≤2 within 1 domain) within 1 question-
naire can be imputed by using predefined rules.22 In case of
more missing values or nonresponse, multiple imputation
(10 data sets) using predictive mean matching was used, data
were subsequently pooled using the Rubin rule.23
Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis
An incidence of 3.3% of SSI was expected in clean-
contaminated, elective orthopedic procedures for the cefazo-
lin group.12,14 In recent Dutch retrospective studies at the time
of study design, the incidence of SSI following removal of or-
thopedic implants from the foot, ankle, or lower leg was 9.2%
to 19%.3,9,10 An SSI rate of 10% at the lower end of this range
was chosen for the saline group to have at least 80% power to
detect a clinically relevant decrease in SSI rate by two-thirds,
from 10% to 3.3%.16
Itwascalculatedthatasamplesizeof216patientsperstudy
group would provide 80% power to detect a 6.7% difference
with a 2-group χ2 test at a 2-sided α level of .05. To allow for
an anticipated dropout of 10% to 15%, a total of 250 patients
were included per study group.
An interim analysis was performed midway through the
study (after inclusion of 216 patients) by an independent stat-
istician to estimate the SSI rate in the saline group to reevalu-
ate the sample size calculation. Because only an estimation
of the SSI rate in the saline group was performed and no
treatment effect was tested, the overall type I error rate was
maintained.
An intention-to-treat analysis was performed according to
plan described in the published protocol.16 Continuous data
are presented as means and standard deviations or medians
and interquartile ranges (IQRs) where appropriate; categori-
cal data are presented as counts and percentages. For continu-
ous data, t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used and, for
categorical24 data, χ2 tests or Fisher exact tests were used,
where appropriate. A 95% CI was calculated for the absolute
risk differences by using the Wilson score method, continuity-
corrected in case of low cell counts. In a sensitivity analysis,
generalized linear mixed modeling was applied to assess the
effect of cefazolin on the SSI rate while correcting for the strati-
fication factors of diabetes and treatment center. Diabetes was
modeled as a fixed variable and treatment center as a random
variable. SSI rate was assumed to have a binomial distribu-
tion (logit link). In all analyses, statistical uncertainties were

 quantified using corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs, and a P value
of .05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance. Pa-
tients who underwent randomization in error were excluded
from analysis (ie, they did not meet the inclusion criteria or
did meet an exclusion criterion). Post hoc, exploratory, unad-
justed subgroup analyses comparing patients with and with-
out antibiotics by weight (<60 kg and ≥60 kg13) and by type of
removal of orthopedic implants (Kirschner wire, screw, syn-
desmotic screw, plate and screws, and intramedullary nail)
were performed with logistic regression by testing for inter-
actionswithtypeoftreatment.Furthermore,univariableanaly-
ses to identify factors associated with SSIs were performed.
Analyses were performed using WINPEPI, version 3.2,25 and
the SPSS (IBM), version 24.0.
Results
Patients
In total, 500 patients were included in 19 Dutch hospitals,
of which 2 were university hospitals (eAppendix in Supplement
2). Two hundred thirty-two patients received antibiotic pro-
phylaxis intravenously (cefazolin group) and 245 patients
received sodium chloride only (saline group) (Figure).26
Eighty-eight patients were treated in an academic center.
After randomization 7 patients were lost to follow-up. A total
of 470 patients were available for analysis (228 in the cefazo-
lin group and 242 in the saline group). Baseline characteris-
tics are displayed in Table 1.
Primary Outcome
Sixty-six patients (14.0%) developed an SSI (SSI classifica-
tion: superficial, 58; deep, 8). In the cefazolin group, 30 pa-
tients (13.2%) developed an SSI vs 36 patients (14.9%) in the
saline group (P = .60; absolute risk difference, −1.7 [95% CI,
−8.0 to 4.6]) (Table 2). Adjustment for center and diabetes did
not affect the odds ratios (ORs) for the association between ce-
fazolin and risk of SSI (unadjusted OR: 0.867 [95% CI, 0.514
to 1.462] for center to 0.854 [95% CI, 0.505 to 1.445] for dia-
betes mellitus).
In 6 of 8 patients (75%) with a deep SSI, surgical debride-
ment was performed; all 8 patients were admitted and treated
with intravenous antibiotics. Seven of 8 patients with a deep
SSI were in the saline group (Table 2). In 49 of 58 patients
(84.5%) with a superficial SSI, oral antibiotics were pre-
scribed at the outpatient clinic or emergency department and
9 patients (15.5%) were treated conservatively without anti-
biotics. Two patients (3.4%) had the incision opened locally.

The mean patient satisfaction score with treatment on the
VAS was 7.7. This did not statistically significantly differ
between the 2 study groups postoperatively (7.5 in the
cefazolin group vs 7.8 in the saline group; absolute differ-
ence, −0.22 [95% CI, −0.77 to 0.33]).
Post Hoc Analyses
A variety of microorganisms were cultured in patients with
an SSI. Thirty of 232 patients (12.9%) in the cefazolin group
were diagnosed with an SSI (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). In
this group, 19 causative organisms were found in 19 cultures.
Fourteen microorganisms (74%) were sensitive for cefazolin
and 5 (26%) were not sensitive for cefazolin. Among 2.7% of
patients from whom a culture swab was obtained, no growth
was detected, and, in 45.5% of patients diagnosed with an
SSI, no culture swab was collected. In 87.2% of the cases, the
identified microorganisms (both groups) were sensitive
to cefazolin.
The tests for interaction for exploratory subgroup analy-
ses revealed that neither weight (ie, <60 kg or ≥60 kg) (P = .14)
nor the type of removal of orthopedic implants (P = .63) mod-

Discussion
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial
involving patients who were undergoing surgery for removal
of orthopedic implants used for treatment of fractures below
the knee, a single preoperative dose of intravenous cefazolin
compared with no administration of antibiotic prophylaxis
did not reduce the risk of a SSI within 30 days after the surgi-
cal procedure.
A high rate of SSI was observed; higher than in most avail-
able retrospective series.2-7,9,10,15 SSI rates are often higher in
prospective studies, because adequate reporting of SSIs after
hospital discharge has proven to be difficult and underreport-
ing is common.27 However, the incidence of 14.0% was still
higher than expected. In contrast to the hypothesis, antibi-
otic prophylaxis did not lower the SSI rate and it exceeds rates
reported following open reduction and internal fixation.1
The high rate of SSIs following removal of orthopedic
implants could be a result of a low threshold for start of
antibiotic treatment upon the slightest suspicion of a SSI
(eg, wound dehiscence without infection), which might have
caused overtreatment. We used the CDC criteria as the pri-
mary end point criterion; these state that a wound is classi-
fied as infected whenever antibiotic treatment has been
started. As a result, patients with a wound dehiscence or
wound edge necrosis who started antibiotic treatment were
registered as patients with an SSI. The relatively high number
of patients with an SSI without collection of a wound culture
swab supports this hypothesis.
Cefazolin was used in this study—a first-generation ceph-
alosporin, which is a broad spectrum antibiotic with good and
rapid bone, soft tissue, and muscle concentrations.28 Cepha-
losporins have proven to be effective as antibiotic prophy-
laxis in orthopedic trauma surgery.1 It is widely used, as con-
firmed by a recent survey among US orthopedic surgeons in
which 96% of the respondents reported to use cefazolin as the
standard antibiotic prophylaxis.29 Several microorganisms,
which were cultured in patients with SSI, were not sensitive
for cefazolin (12.8%). However, the majority was sensitive
(87.2%); therefore, cefazolin appears to be an adequate op-
tion for antibiotic prophylaxis.
Timing of administration of antibiotic prophylaxis has
shown to be of importance. Antibiotics should be adminis-
tered within 1 hour prior to incision.30,31 The allocated inter-
vention was administered within this timespan as random-
ization was performed in the operating room holding or in
the operation theater. Additionally, some advocate repeated
doses of antibiotic prophylaxis.29 A Cochrane review32 has
shown that a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis is suffi-
cient and multiple doses do not lower the SSI rate in surgical
fixation of long bone fractures. The guideline of the Ameri-
can Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons therefore only advises
redosing if procedure time exceeds 1 to 2 times the half-life of
the antibiotic (1.5 to 2.0 hours for cefazolin).28 Removal of
orthopedic implants lasted a mean 36 minutes (maximum,
109 minutes). As a result, not repeating prophylaxis would
not have influenced the results. Even though the correct type
of antibiotic was administered in the correct dose at the right
time without need for redosing, a high SSI rate was still
observed following removal of orthopedic implants.
There were numerically more deep SSIs in the saline group
than in the cefazolin group (1 patient [0.4%] in the cefazolin
group vs 7 patients [2.9%] in the saline group), although this
difference was not statistically different. These results, how-
ever, need to be interpreted with care. First, it was a data-
driven analysis on a secondary outcome measure. Second, the
study was not powered for detecting a difference in deep SSIs
mandating careful interpretation.
Several causes for the failure of the primary outcome in
the design of a randomized clinical trial are identified: under
powering, inadequate primary outcome, inappropriate popu-
lation, inappropriate treatment regimen, and deficiencies in
trial conduct.33 An adequate sample size calculation was per-
formed based on extensive evaluation of available literature
with conservative estimation of treatment effect, with an ap-
propriate and unambiguous primary outcome measure and in-
cluding the appropriate population and trial regimen.
Postoperative health-related quality of life measured
through the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire did not statistically sig-
nificantly differ between the 2 study groups. It was, however,
lower compared with reference data.34 This was also the case
for the self-rated health status incorporated in the EQ-5D-3L
questionnaire.34 Functional outcome did not differ statisti-
cally significantly between the 2 study groups. Functional out-
come was considerably lower compared with normative data
provided for the LEFS questionnaire. However, when com-
paring functional outcome in this cohort with patients with a

 history of a lower extremity fracture in this study, function-
ality was comparable.35 Overall, patients were satisfied with
treatment, as reflected by the mean score of 7.7 on the treat-
ment satisfaction (VAS) scale. This did not statistically signifi-
cantly differ between the 2 study groups.
In addition to the negative effects of an SSI for the pa-
tient, SSIs incur a financial penalty to the health care system.
In the current era of increasing burden of health care–related
costs on governmental spending, prevention of SSI is of im-
portance as a superficial SSI may cost up to $1700 per case and
a deep SSI may cost up to $21 200 per case.36
Awareness that removal of orthopedic implants is not a
straightforward procedure is needed. The procedure is
accompanied by a high rate of SSIs. Patients should be
adequately counseled on the risks of SSI following removal of
orthopedic implants.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, a dose of 1000 mg of
cefazolin was administered, which was standard dosage at
the time of development of the trial (and is still the standard
dosage for surgery lasting <60 minutes).18 In recently pub-
lished studies, some advocate administration of 2000 mg
cefazolin if a patient weighs more than 60 kg13 or 85 kg.28
However, this practice is solely based on expert opinion and
pharmacokinetic data and there is no high-quality evidence
for this practice.13 A post hoc, exploratory, subgroup analysis
including patients weighing less than 60 kg and 60 kg or
more was performed. In these subgroup analyses, no statisti-
cal differences between the 2 subgroups in the rate of SSI
were found, although a potential benefit associated with
antibiotic prophylaxis was observed in patients with a body
weight less than 60 kg. This analysis was, however, a data-
driven, post hoc, underpowered analysis. Research on
whether the biological availability of antibiotics (in this con-
centration) in the lower extremity is adequate enough to pre-
vent development of an SSI is therefore warranted. In addi-
tion, antibiotic susceptibility may be reduced thousand-fold
when a biofilm is present.37 This is especially important in
case of incomplete removal of orthopedic implants. Second,
a potential beneficial effect on preventing deep SSIs was
observed. However, the study was not powered for analysis
on this secondary outcome measure, hampering the interpre-
tation of this finding. Third, the number of eligible patients in
the participating centers is not available; as a result, selection
bias might be present. Nevertheless a randomized clinical
trial using blinded outcome assessment analyzed with appro-
priate statistical methods was performed ensuring the qual-
ity of the presented data.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing surgery for removal of orthope-
dic implants used for treatment of fractures below the knee, a
single preoperative dose of intravenous cefazolin compared
with saline did not reduce the risk of surgical site infection
within 30 days following implant removal.
