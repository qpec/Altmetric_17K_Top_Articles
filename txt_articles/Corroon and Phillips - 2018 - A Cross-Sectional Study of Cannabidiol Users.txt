 Open Access
A Cross-Sectional Study of Cannabidiol Users
Jamie Corroon1,2 and Joy A. Phillips3
Abstract
Introduction: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that cannabidiol (CBD) found in Cannabis spp. has broad
therapeutic value. CBD products can currently be purchased online, over the counter and at Cannabis-specific
dispensaries throughout most of the country, despite the fact that CBD is generally deemed a Schedule I con-
trolled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and renounced as a dietary supplement ingre-
dient by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Consumer demand for CBD is high and growing, but few studies
have examined the reasons for increasing CBD use.
Materials and Methods: A self-selected convenience sample (n = 2409) was recruited via an online survey
designed to characterize whom, how, and why individuals are currently using CBD. The anonymous question-
naire was accessed from October 25, 2017 to January 25, 2018. Participants were recruited through social media.
Results: Almost 62% of CBD users reported using CBD to treat a medical condition. The top three medical con-
ditions were pain, anxiety, and depression. Almost 36% of respondents reported that CBD treats their medical
condition(s) ‘‘very well by itself,’’ while only 4.3% reported ‘‘not very well.’’ One out of every three users reported
a nonserious adverse effect. The odds of using CBD to treat a medical condition were 1.44 (95% confidence
interval, 1.16–1.79) times greater among nonregular users of Cannabis than among regular users.
Conclusion: Consumers are using CBD as a specific therapy for multiple diverse medical conditions—particularly
pain, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. These data provide a compelling rationale for further research to
better understand the therapeutic potential of CBD.

Introduction
Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of more than a hundred can-
nabinoids found in Cannabis sativa L (Cannabis
spp. or Cannabis), a plant more well known colloqui-
ally as marijuana and hemp. CBD is typically the sec-
ond most abundant cannabinoid found in Cannabis
after tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).1 CBD was first iso-
lated in 1940 and characterized structurally in 1963.2,3
CBD is well tolerated in humans and maintains a
good safety profile.4,5 Neither abuse nor dependence
has been demonstrated.5 In preclinical studies, CBD
shows potential therapeutic efficacy against a diverse
assortment of medical conditions. These include sei-
zure disorders, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, depres-
sion, inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
neurodegeneration, symptoms of multiple sclerosis,
and chronic pain, either used alone or when coadmi-
nistered with THC.5–20
In October of 2017, a New Drug Application was sub-
mitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to seek approval of CBD isolated from marijuana for the
treatment of two pediatric seizure disorders. Approval
was granted in June, 2018, making Epidiolex (cannabi-
diol) the first plant-derived Cannabis
compound
approved as a drug by the FDA. Availability of Epidiolex
is pending Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

 rescheduling of cannabidiol, which is expected to occur
within 90 days.21–23 Sativex (nabiximols), a combination
drug with equal parts CBD and THC extracted from
marijuana, is currently approved to treat spasticity due
to multiple sclerosis in >30 countries worldwide but is
not approved in the United States.17,21
The worldwide regulatory status of CBD is complex
and constantly changing.5 While CBD is legal in many
countries as a component of prescription Sativex
(nabiximols), it may be simultaneously illegal as a com-
ponent of a nonapproved Cannabis extract containing
>0.2% (particularly in European countries) or 0.3%
THC. In Europe, individual European Union Member
States currently determine the legality of CBD within
their borders. Most allow prescription CBD products,
as do Australia and New Zealand.5,24 Canada became
the second nation in the world to legalize Cannabis
for recreational use in June 2018.25 The World Health
Organization’s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence
recommended that CBD should not be controlled by
Schedule I of the 1961 UN Single Convention on Nar-
cotic Drugs.5 Their comprehensive report is expected
this year.
In the United States, until such time as it is resched-
uled, CBD from marijuana is deemed by the DEA to
fall within the purview of the ‘‘marihuana extract
rule’’ (Rule). A dispute over the scope of the Rule was
litigated in federal court. The Court found that the
Rule applies to extracts of marijuana but that the indus-
trial hemp provisions of the 2014 Farm Act (i.e., ‘‘The
2014 Farm Bill’’) preempt the Controlled Substances
Act (CSA), which the DEA enforces.26 Thus, hemp cul-
tivated in compliance with the Farm Bill is not a con-
trolled substance. The Court did not address the issue
of CBD directly, however, and left open the issue of
the legal status of CBD derived from industrial hemp,
from imported ‘‘nonpsychoactive hemp’’ or from
parts of the Cannabis sativa plant excluded from the
legal definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substan-
ces Act of 1970.27–35 Despite conflicting legal interpre-
tations, and DEA prohibition, hemp-derived CBD
products can currently be purchased as dietary supple-
ments both online and over the counter throughout
most of the country. To complicate matters further,
the FDA does not recognize CBD as a dietary supple-
ment ingredient because of its status as an Investiga-
tional New Drug.36
This regulatory confusion has not deterred consum-
ers from exploring the purported benefits of CBD. Retail
sales of hemp-derived CBD products in the United
States reached $170 million in 2016, and are projected
to grow at a 55% compound annual growth rate over
the next 5 years to reach >$1 billion. These estimates
do not include marijuana-derived CBD.37 Although
Cannabis users have been extensively studied data
characterizing the individual use of CBD are scarce.
The goal of this study was to collect survey data to elu-
cidate how, and why, individuals are using CBD.
Methods
Survey
The study protocol was submitted electronically to the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of San Diego State
University. Given the voluntary nature of the survey,
and the lack of identifying information, the electronic
approval process determined that no IRB approval
was necessary.
We developed a novel questionnaire to assess broad
characteristics of self-described CBD users and under-
lying reasons for, and methods of, CBD use. The survey
consisted of structured questions answered by either
yes/no or multiple-choice responses. Questions focused
on several key domains: sociodemographics; reasons
for use; duration and frequency of use; method of ad-
ministration; perceived clinical efficacy; and adverse ef-
fects. Study data were collected and managed using
Qualtrics� Survey Software, a secure tool allowing par-
ticipants to directly enter responses anonymously.
Subjects were a self-selected convenience sample
who accessed the online survey from October 25,
2017 to January 25, 2018. Recruitment strategies in-
cluded promotion on survey-specific Web pages on
Facebook, LinkedIn, and ResearchGate. CBD product
manufacturers and herbal vaporizer manufacturers
assisted in recruitment by promoting links to the sur-
vey on their Facebook pages and/or via email to their
customers. The only inclusion criterion was current
or prior use of CBD. Respondents could skip any ques-
tion(s) they did not wish to answer.
Data analyses
Descriptive statistics including simple proportions
were used to describe demographics, usage characteris-
tics, medical conditions, perceived efficacy, side effects,
and other CBD use preferences. Data analyses were
conducted using SAS University Edition (SAS 9.4;
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Univariate and bivariate
comparisons were conducted using PROC FREQ and
chi-square tests. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to esti-
mate strength of association using PROC LOGISTIC.

Results
Demographics
A total of 2490 responses were collected. Eighty-one re-
spondents were excluded from the analysis for failure to
answer the first question regarding stated use of CBD,
leaving 2409 respondents included in the final study
population. The sample was balanced in terms of gender
(female: 50.87%; male: 47.40%) with most respondents
reporting ages between 55 and 74 years (39.97%).
Most were either graduates of, or currently enrolled in,
college or a postgraduate program (71.22%). The vast
majority resided in the United States (91.23%). Respond-
ents from all 50 U.S. states were represented in the sur-
vey with the majority residing in California (n = 412,
21.90%; Table 1). In addition, there were survey respon-
dents from 23 other countries. Regular Cannabis use was
reported by 55.17% of respondents.
Stated use: medical versus general health
and well-being
More than 60% (61.56%) reported using CBD to treat a
medical condition(s) (Table 1). The odds of using CBD
to treat a medical condition were 1.65 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.39–1.97) times greater among women
than among men, higher with age, and roughly equal
among residents and nonresidents of the United States
(OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.9–2.5; Table 2). Respondents <18
years of age were subsequently assessed as an indepen-
dent category despite the small number of observations
(n = 25) and wide CI (OR, 18.72; 95% CI, 4.20–83.39,
compared with those between 18 and 24 years of age.
Data not included in Table 2). This additional analysis
was based on the established use of CBD to treat pedi-
atric seizure disorders6,7,16 and the percentage of re-
spondents in that age category reporting using CBD
to treat a medical condition (n = 23; 92%).
The odds of using CBD to treat a medical condition
were 1.44 (95% CI, 1.16–1.79) times greater among
nonregular users of Cannabis when compared with
regular users.
Medical conditions
There were 1483 respondents who reported using CBD
to treat at least one medical condition. A minimum of
3963 medical conditions were reported. This represents
an average of more than two and a half (mean: 2.67)
different medical conditions per respondent.
In order of frequency, the top three medical condi-
tions reported were chronic pain, arthritis/joint pain,
and anxiety (Fig. 1).
Respondents selected ‘‘Other’’ 362 times. The most
common ‘‘Other’’ conditions reported were neuropathy
(n = 48), autoimmune conditions (n = 38), and fibro-
myalgia (n = 37).
Methods of administration
A total of 4135 methods of administration were reported
by 2200 respondents. This represents an average of al-
most two (mean: 1.88) different methods of administra-
tion per respondent. Overall, the most common method
reported was the administration of CBD in a sublingual

 form (Fig. 2). This includes liquids administered as
sprays, drops, and tinctures. The least common method
was topical use.
More than half (51.36%) of those reporting a method
of administration reported using only one method (n =
1130; missing = 209; not including ‘‘Other,’’ n = 31). On
average, respondents who reported using one method
of administration were 1.6 times more likely to use
CBD for a medical condition than for general health
and well-being (medical condition, n = 691; general
health and well-being, n = 439). Medical users reporting
one method of administration were 2.4 times more likely
to use a topical form, 2.0 times more likely to use an ed-
ible form of CBD, and 1.8 times more likely to use CBD
in a sublingual or pill or capsule form than general health
and well-being users reporting one method.
Learning about CBD, frequency and duration of use
Overall, 75.85% of respondents reported learning about
CBD from internet research, family members, or
friends. Of the remaining respondents, medical users
were more likely to learn about CBD from a Medical
Doctor or Naturopathic Doctor and to use it more
frequently than those using it for general health and
well-being. The odds of using CBD to treat a medical
condition were 1.79 (95% CI, 1.46–2.19) times greater
among respondents using it more than once per day
compared with those using it daily (Table 3). Duration
of use was more variable, but the odds of using CBD to
treat a medical condition were greater among those
using it for <5 years (Table 3).
Treatment efficacy
Only respondents who reported using CBD to treat
a medical condition were asked about its efficacy
(n = 1483). Almost 36% (35.80%) of respondents
reported that CBD treats their medical condition(s)
‘‘very well by itself,’’ while only 4.30% reported ‘‘not
very well’’ (Table 4). Respondents most frequently
reported feeling that CBD treated their medical con-
dition(s) ‘‘very well by itself’’ or ‘‘moderately well
by itself’’ for the following three conditions: chronic
pain, arthritis/joint pain, and anxiety (Fig. 3).
The odds of regular Cannabis use were two to three
times greater among those who reported feeling that
CBD treated their medical condition ‘‘very well by itself’’
(OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.29–4.18) or ‘‘moderately well by
itself’’ (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.61–5.29; see Table 4).
Side effects
A minimum of 1314 side effects were reported across
2409 respondents (missing, n = 1095). Seven hundred
eighty-five (59.74%) of these effects were categorized
as adverse (Table 5). On average, this represents at
least one reported adverse effect in approximately
one out of every three (3.07) users of CBD.
The top five most frequently reported adverse effects
were dry mouth (n = 268, 11.12% of all CBD users), eu-
phoria (n = 155, 6.43%), hunger (n = 153, 6.35%), red
eyes (n = 66, 2.74%), and sedation/fatigue (n = 43,
1.78%). Just under 30% (28.46%) of medical users
reported an adverse effect when compared with
34.56% of general health and well-being users.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first published survey
(aside from industry reports) that specifically analyzes
CBD users, as opposed to overall Cannabis or medical
Cannabis users. The results of this study suggest that
CBD is used more frequently as a specific therapy for
medical conditions than for general health and well-
being. This stands in contrast to the majority of mari-
juana users, who largely use THC-dominant Cannabis
for recreational or nonmedical reasons.38
The most common medical condition for which
CBD was reportedly used was pain. In preclinical
studies, CBD-based analgesia is associated with po-
tent immune-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, and

 antioxidant activity.39–47 CBD acts as an agonist for a
wide variety of cell-surface receptors including aden-
osine A2A, 5-HT1A, TRPV1, a7nAch, a3 glycine re-
ceptors, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPAR-c) nuclear receptor. These
receptors are all associated with anti-inflammatory
activity.48–58 Consistent with the efficacy reported
by survey respondents, CBD has been shown to re-
duce inflammatory cytokines in murine models of in-
flammatory disease and chronic and acute pain.59
The endocannabinoid system may also play a role in
CBD-mediated analgesia. CBD inhibits enzymes (i.e.,
fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase)
that degrade endocannabinoids. This inhibition is associ-
ated with increased endocannabinoid levels, analgesia,
and opioid-sparing effects in preclinical models of pain.60
Anxiety and depression were also commonly reported
reasons for CBD use in this survey. CBD has long been
proposed to inhibit THC-associated anxiety by antago-
nizing cannabinoid receptor activation by THC.61–63
CBD may also reduce anxiety via the serotonin 5-
HT1A and/or GABAA receptors.14,64 These receptor
pathways are being explored in hopes of novel thera-
peutic strategies for phobias, post-traumatic stress dis-
order, and drug abuse.65,66
The majority of survey respondents learned about
CBD from internet research, family members, or
friends. This was the case for both medical and gen-
eral health and well-being users. Over 74% of respon-
dents reported using CBD daily or more than daily.
Sublingual delivery was the most common route of
administration in both groups. The frequency of
use of sublingual preparations found in this study
contradicts a recent industry-funded CBD survey
where respondents reported more frequent vaping,
smoking, and topical use.67 This industry survey
was collected from customers of an online medical
marijuana
recommendation
service.
Presumably,
these respondents were seeking marijuana-derived
products, so the frequency of inhalation as a method

 of administration is consistent with marijuana users
overall.68 Our finding may be in part due to the
fact that hemp-derived CBD products are largely dis-
tributed online and in health-food stores and widely
offered as oral preparations.
The
percentage
of
respondents
(55.17%)
who
reported regular Cannabis use is markedly higher
than national estimates. In 2015, an estimated 8.3%
(*22.2 million people) of individuals aged 12 years
or older had used marijuana in the past month.69 The
reason for the higher rate of Cannabis use among survey
respondents is not clear, although one possibility is that
Cannabis users would be more likely to have heard of
CBD. However, CBD use by a relatively high percentage
(44.83%) of nonregular Cannabis users suggests that in-
dividuals are not using CBD as a perceived legal route to
THC consumption.
Approximately half of all respondents reported
using CBD for <1 year. Just over 10% reported using
CBD for >5 years. Nonserious adverse effects were rel-
atively common among respondents and higher among
those using CBD for general health and well-being, de-
spite the fact that this group reported less frequent use
than medical users. While dry mouth, sedation/fatigue,
decreased appetite, and diarrhea have previously been
reported following CBD use,6,7 other studies have dem-
onstrated no adverse effects.10,70–72 This dichotomy
may be related to dose, interactions with prescription
medications, or both. More broadly, adverse effects
may also be related to the method of administration
and/or the use of purified, high-dose CBD as opposed
to CBD in a whole plant extract. These questions and
more reinforce the need for more research on unan-
ticipated consequences of CBD use, particularly the

 impact of long-term usage.4,5 Many of the adverse ef-
fects reported in this study (i.e., euphoria, hunger,
and red eyes) are commonly associated with THC
use.73 These analyses did not attempt to discriminate
between hemp-derived CBD and marijuana-derived
CBD products, which may have differing chemical con-
stituents (including THC content) and therefore differ-
ent effects. Further, no discrimination could be made
between isolated CBD and CBD used as a constituent
of a whole plant extract.
Industry-originated studies have found that users are
confused about the source of their CBD and the con-
centration of CBD and other ingredients.67–74 It is
worth noting that independent research has confirmed
that the CBD content in almost 70% of CBD-labeled
products available online may be mislabeled. In one
study, 43% of products were underlabeled and 26%
were overlabeled for actual CBD content. More than
20% contained detectable levels of THC.75 Since CBD-
containing products are largely unregulated there is no ob-
vious way for users to know the quantity of CBD, or other
constituents, which may be present in the products they
use. Given this uncertainty, it is possible that some of
the reported efficacy and the adverse effects may be in
part due to the inclusion of other compounds in the
CBD preparation, including THC.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths, including the size,
geographic representation of the sample, wide age
range of the respondents, and a focus on specific
usage characteristics. In part, this was the result of uti-
lizing multiple recruitment methodologies.
In terms of limitations, the study population was a
self-selected convenience sample, and as such, may
not be representative of the general population or the
overall population of CBD users. Individuals with
favorable opinions of or experiences with CBD or
Cannabis are more likely to have responded to the
questionnaire than those with negative opinions and
experiences. In addition, ‘‘regular cannabis use’’ was
not defined in the survey and ‘‘marijuana’’ was not dis-
tinguished from ‘‘Cannabis.’’ Since the survey was pri-
marily circulated via the internet, CBD users with
limited social media connectivity would be underrepre-
sented. Finally, no mechanism for identifying repeat re-
spondents was incorporated into the survey. Although
results were examined manually, it is possible that re-
peat respondents may have distorted the results (i.e.,
Ballot stuffing).
Conclusion
The use of CBD among individuals for both specific
health conditions and general health and well-being is
widespread. The results of this study demonstrate that
individuals are learning about CBD from the internet,
friends, or family members, rather than from healthcare
professionals. CBD is being used as a specific therapy for
a number of diverse medical conditions—particularly
pain and inflammatory disorders, in addition to anxiety,
depression, and sleep disorders. A large percentage of
respondents indicate that CBD treats their condition(s)
effectively in the absence of conventional medicine and
with nonserious adverse effects. These data provide a
compelling rationale for further research to better un-
derstand the therapeutic potential of CBD in treating
chronic pain, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and
other medical conditions.
