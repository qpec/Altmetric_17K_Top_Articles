In Brief
Auditory hair cells are nonregenerative,
resulting in persistent hearing loss upon
damage. Walters et al. find that
manipulating two genes, p27Kip1 and
Atoh1, induces the conversion of
nonsensory cells to hair cells in adult
mice. This effect is mediated by GATA3
and POU4F3, where POU4F3 alone was
found to convert nonsensory cells.

SUMMARY
Hearing loss is widespread and persistent because
mature mammalian auditory hair cells (HCs) are non-
regenerative. In mice, the ability to regenerate HCs
from surrounding supporting cells (SCs) declines
abruptly after postnatal maturation. We find that
combining p27Kip1 deletion with ectopic ATOH1
expression surmounts this age-related decline, lead-
ing to conversion of SCs to HCs in mature mouse
cochleae and after noise damage. p27Kip1 deletion,
independent of canonical effects on Rb-family pro-
teins, upregulated GATA3, a co-factor for ATOH1
that is lost from SCs with age. Co-activation of
GATA3 or POU4F3 and ATOH1 promoted conversion
of SCs to HCs in adult mice. Activation of POU4F3
alone also converted mature SCs to HCs in vivo.
These data illuminate a genetic pathway that initiates
auditory HC regeneration and suggest p27Kip1,
GATA3, and POU4F3 as additional therapeutic tar-
gets for ATOH1-mediated HC regeneration.
INTRODUCTION
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is one of the most common
long-term disabilities in humans (Blackwell et al., 2014; Timmer
et al., 2015). Most SNHL results from the loss of sensory hair cells
(HCs), which in mature mammalian cochleae, do not regenerate
(McGill and Schuknecht, 1976; Soucek et al., 1986). Research
aimed at regenerating HCs has focused on ATOH1, a basic-he-
lix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that represents a thera-
peutic target for converting nonsensory supporting cells (SCs)
into sensory HCs (Atkinson et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2013; Izumi-
kawa et al., 2005, 2008; Kawamoto et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2012;
Kraft et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2012, 2014; Ouji
et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2013; Parker et al., 2014; Wu et al.,
2013; Yang et al., 2012, 2013; Zhao et al., 2011; Zheng and
Gao, 2000). Clinical trials are being conducted to test whether
an ATOH1 gene therapy can rehabilitate hearing in SNHL
patients (NCT: NCT02132130). However, research in animal
models suggests that ectopic Atoh1 may be insufficient because
(1) a limited number of SCs respond by upregulating HC-specific
genes (Izumikawa et al., 2005; Kawamoto et al., 2003; Liu et al.,
2012, 2014); (2) those cells that do respond lack markers of ter-
minal differentiation and the physiological properties of mature
cochlear HCs (Atkinson et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012, 2014;
Yang et al., 2012); and (3) in genetic mouse models, it has yet
to be demonstrated that ATOH1 can convert SCs into HCs in
the adult cochlea (Kelly et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). Because hu-
man cochleae become functionally mature neonatally (Hepper
and Shahidullah, 1994), and because SNHL is most prevalent
in older adults (Blackwell et al., 2014), overcoming the limits
that aging imposes on reprogramming cochlear cells is of para-
mount importance.
Reprogramming of cells is rarely accomplished by manipu-
lating a single factor. Rather, the coordinated manipulation of
several factors is needed for reprogramming and regeneration
of cardiac, neural, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic tissues (La-
lit et al., 2016; Niu et al., 2013; Shaffiey et al., 2016; Song et al.,
2016; Wei and Hong, 2016). Similarly, in vitro evidence suggests
that co-expression of several factors (POU4F3, GFI1, and
ATOH1) is more effective than ectopic expression of ATOH1
alone in converting embryonic stem cells into HC-like cells
(Costa et al., 2015). In embryonic and neonatal mouse cochlear
tissue, ectopic expression of TCF3, GATA3, ETV4, NMYC, or
ETS2 in combination with ATOH1 yielded more HC-like cells
than did overexpression of ATOH1 alone (Ikeda et al., 2015;
Masuda et al., 2012).
In nonmammalian models of HC regeneration, p27Kip1 (p27)
expression is significantly decreased at early time points
following HC loss (Hawkins et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2014,
2016). p27 is a known regulator of quiescence in HCs and SCs
in the inner ear (Chen and Segil, 1999; Lo
¨ wenheim et al., 1999),
and it is negatively correlated with regenerative potential in other
tissues (Georgia and Bhushan, 2006; Minamishima et al., 2002;
Wang et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 2002). As such, the targeting
of p27 has been suggested as a means for increasing the num-
ber of HCs that can be generated by ectopic ATOH1 via a prolif-
erative increase in the pool of SCs to be targeted (Minoda et al.,
2007). However, p27 has not been investigated for any direct role
in cellular transdifferentiation or more specifically the loss of re-
programming efficiency with age.
Here we show that unlike ectopic ATOH1 alone, concomitant
p27 deletion and ectopic ATOH1 expression results in a signifi-
cant number of SCs converting to HCs in adult mice in vivo. How-
ever, in contrast to known functions of p27, we did not observe

 proliferation of SCs or converted HCs (cHCs). Furthermore,
when cell-cycle regulators downstream of p27 were similarly
deleted in conjunction with ectopic ATOH1, there was no in-
crease in SC to HC conversion. These results suggest a role
for p27 in ATOH1 function and cell differentiation that is cell-cy-
cle independent. Our data support this, revealing a previously
uncharacterized role for p27 in repressing GATA3 expression
in mature SCs. GATA3, in turn, facilitates ATOH1-mediated con-
version of mature SCs to HCs. In addition, we demonstrate that
POU4F3 upregulation is a critical event in the conversion of SCs
by ATOH1. Ectopic expression of human POU4F3 (hPOU4F3) is,
by itself, sufficient to upregulate HC-specific genes in mature
SCs, and ectopic hPOU4F3 in conjunction with ATOH1 converts
even more SCs into HCs than either ectopic hPOU4F3 or ectopic
ATOH1 individually. In summary, p27 plays a cell-cycle-indepen-
dent role in preventing ATOH1-mediated conversion of adult
SCs to HCs by repressing GATA3 expression; GATA3 and
POU4F3 promote ATOH1-mediated HC regeneration in the
mature cochlea; and ATOH1-based gene therapies for auditory
HC regeneration may benefit from the additional targeting of
one or more of the gene products described (i.e., p27, GATA3,
or POU4F3).
RESULTS
Co-manipulation of p27 and ATOH1 Results in the
Phenotypic Conversion of Adult Cochlear SCs to HCs
We have previously demonstrated that an Fgfr3-iCreER mouse
line (Young et al., 2010) can be used to overexpress an Atoh1HA
transgene in cochlear pillar cells (PCs) and Deiters cells (DCs),
but not HCs, when tamoxifen (Tamox) is administered to mice
at postnatal day (P) 12 or later (Liu et al., 2012). Furthermore, a
hemagglutinin (HA) tag on the Atoh1HA transgene allowed us
to fate map PCs and DCs that ectopically express the transgene
and distinguish those cells from endogenous HCs. Ectopic
expression of ATOH1HA at P12 or P13 resulted in phenotypic
conversion of 11.7% of the HA-positive PCs and DCs, with 13
HC-specific markers, hair bundles, and innervating fibers being
observed (Liu et al., 2012). However, when ectopic ATOH1HA
was induced in mature cochleae (P30), no PCs or DCs exhibited
HC-specific markers, even though most of them were HA posi-
tive. To test whether the conditional knockout (CKO) of p27 could
overcome this limitation and facilitate the phenotypic conversion
of PCs and DCs by ATOH1HA in mature cochleae in vivo, we
bred p27loxP/loxP mice (Chien et al., 2006) with Fgfr3-iCreER+;
Atoh1HA+ mice and induced them with Tamox at P28 (hereafter,
CAP27 mice, for co-manipulation of ATOH1HA and p27). Three
weeks after induction (P49), cochleae were collected and immu-
nostained for the HC-specific proteins POU4F3, myosin VI
(MYO6), myosin VIIa (MYO7A), parvalbumin (PVALB), calbindin
(Calb), and prestin (Table 1). Similar to previous observations,
few HA-positive SCs expressed HC-specific markers in the
Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ mice (Figure 1). In contrast, CAP27
littermates demonstrated a robust upregulation of several
HC-specific markers (Figures 1 and S1), specifically MYO6
(12.1% ± 2.4% of HA+ cells), MYO7A (not quantified), PVALB
(9.3% ± 1.9% of HA+ cells), Calb (2.1% ± 0.7% of HA+ cells),
and POU4F3 (>100% of HA+ cells). We did not detect any cells
that had upregulated prestin, a marker of HC maturation (Fig-
ure 2). Cochlear cells that were immunopositive for HA exhibited
several phenotypes suggestive of different stages of maturation
or conversion (Figure S2). While many of the cHCs exhibited api-
cal migration of the nucleus from to the HC layer, a hallmark of
HC regeneration in nonmammals (Stone and Cotanche, 2007),
some of the PVALB- or MYO7A-positive cells retained morphol-
ogies consistent with that of SCs and exhibited no nuclear migra-
tion. Some cHCs exhibited nuclear and somal sizes larger than
those of endogenous outer HCs (OHCs), while nuclear diameters
in others were more consistent with those of SCs and endoge-
nous OHCs (Figures S1 and S2). This is consistent with the
observed markers typical of early HC development (e.g.,
POU4F3 and MYO6) appearing more often than markers that
are typical of later maturation (e.g., Calb and prestin) (Figure 2).
This pattern suggests that SCs were converted to HCs with vary-
ing latencies, leading to cHCs that resembled diverse stages of
normal HC development.
Because enlarged nuclei were observed in several of the
cHCs, we sought to investigate whether those cells might be
dying or if enlarged nuclei and somal size were merely part
of the conversion process. Measures of the density of PCs
and DCs are consistent with similar measures from wild-type
mice (Mizutari et al., 2013) and did not reveal any signifi-
cant loss of SCs: 70.91 ± 0.64 SCs per 100 mm in Fgfr3-
iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ samples versus 70.64 ± 0.45 SCs per
100 mm in CAP27 mice. However, immunostaining for cleaved
caspase-3, a marker of apoptotic cell death, suggested that
a small portion of the cHCs (<6 per cochlea) were undergoing
apoptosis 3 weeks after Tamox injections (Figure S2). Exami-
nation of PVALB and ATOH1HA double-positive cells in
CAP27 cochleae 6 weeks after Tamox revealed a possible
loss of some cHCs between 3 and 6 weeks after Tamox

 (105.8 ± 18.1 versus 69.3 ± 5.6 PVALB+ cHCs), though this
difference was not statistically significant (Figure S2). Thus,
co-manipulation of p27 and ATOH1 appears to overcome
the limitation of SC to HC conversion in the adult mouse co-
chlea but induces cell death in some of the affected cells
and fails to elicit further maturation of cHCs beyond what
ATOH1 alone accomplishes in neonatal mice.
Consistent with what has been observed in neonatal models
(Liu et al., 2012) we observed PVALB-positive cHCs with hair
bundles that stained readily with phalloidin and attracted
beta-3-tubulin (Tuj1) or neurofilament (NF-H)-positive nerve ter-
minals (Figure 3), suggesting that a portion of the converted
cells had differentiated at least to a state in which they exhibited
morphological attributes of functional HCs. However, future
work will be needed to determine whether the apposition of
neurites is reflective of actual synaptic communication. Scan-
ning electron microscopy also revealed a number of hair
bundles projecting from under the reticular lamina that were
consistent with previous reports of SC to HC conversion (Kawa-
moto et al., 2003; Minoda et al., 2007). Many of these cells had a
kinocilium and/or disorganized bundles, again suggesting
incomplete maturation. A few cells presented with two kinocilia
(Figure 3), which is not typical of a mammalian cochlea. Rather,
previous electron microscopy (EM) studies have shown HCs
with two kinocilia in the balance organs of fish and amphibians
(Flock, 1964; Hudspeth and Jacobs, 1979). This observation
suggests that SCs converted to HCs by ATOH1 may represent
a more primitive type of HC, as suggested previously (Yang
et al., 2012).
There has been speculation, yet no conclusive answer, as to
whether Notch signaling or other factors that might hinder or
foster a regenerative response in the cochlea are changed in
response to noise damage (Mizutari et al., 2013; Maass
et al., 2015). To determine whether the context of noise dam-
age would enhance or inhibit the effect of p27 and ATOH1 co-
manipulation in reprogramming PCs and DCs, we exposed
Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+
mice
and
CAP27
littermates
to
octave-band noise (8–16 kHz) at 120 dB sound pressure level
(SPL) for 2 hr at P30 (2 days after Tamox). Immunostaining for
HA and PVALB at P49 revealed a similar number of co-labeled
cells in the noise-damaged CAP27 mice as had been observed
in undamaged CAP27 mice (Figure S3). Again, we did not
observe any cells that were positive for both HA and prestin.
In noise-damaged Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ cochleae, we did
not observe any cHCs that co-expressed either PVALB or
prestin. These data reproduce the finding that p27CKO en-
hances ATOH1-mediated conversion of mature PCs and DCs
and suggest that co-manipulation of p27 and ATOH1 is a
viable strategy for initiating a regenerative response in mature
mammalian cochleae. In addition, the results provide some
insight into the question of whether noise damage results in
the up- or downregulation of factors that affect the phenotypic
conversion of SCs to HCs. In the context of ATOH1-mediated
conversion, as studied here, there appear to be no dramatic
changes resulting from noise trauma that prevent (or promote)
the conversion of PCs or DCs to HCs, though this does not
exclude possible changes in the expression of Notch-related
or other pertinent factors.
Conversion of PCs and DCs in CAP27 Mice Involves a
Noncanonical Role of p27
The canonical function of p27 is to halt cell division by inhibiting
cyclin/CDK complexes that would otherwise phosphorylate the
Rb (Rb1), p107 (Rbl1), or p130 (Rbl2) proteins (Ezhevsky et al.,
1997). To determine whether this canonical pathway is pertinent
in the SC to HC conversion in CAP27 mice, we examined cell pro-
liferation in this model and looked for SC to HC conversion in mice
in which ATOH1 and Rb-family proteins were co-manipulated. To
assay proliferation, we added bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to the
drinking water of experimental and control mice for 2 weeks after
Tamox induction at P28. Neither Fgfr3-iCreER+;p27CKO nor
CAP27 mice (n = 4 for each) exhibited SCs or HCs that were
positive for BrdU when examined at P42 (Figure S4). Cells in the
tympanic border and in the modiolus were positive for BrdU,
revealing that it entered the peripheral auditory system and
was detectable. We next tested whether genetic ablation of Rb-
family proteins, concomitant with ectopic ATOH1HA, could reca-
pitulate the CAP27 phenotype. The co-manipulation of Rb and
ATOH1 did not result in an increase in PVALB-positive cHCs
compared to ectopic expression of ATOH1HA alone (Figure S4).
Similarly, neither the co-manipulation of p130 and ATOH1HA
(Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+;p130CKO)
nor
the
co-manipula-
tion of p107 and ATOH1HA (Fgfr3Cre;Atoh1HA;p107KO) resulted
in an increase in the number of PVALB-positive cHCs com-
pared to Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ mice. In double-knockout
models (Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+;RbCKO;p130CKO and Fgfr3-
iCreER+;Atoh1HA+;RbCKO;p107KO), we also saw no significant
increase in the number of PVALB-expressing cHCs beyond what
was seen in Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ mice. Finally, we bred triple
CKO mice that would also express ATOH1HA (Fgfr3-iCreER;
Atoh1HA;RbCKO;p130CKO;p107KO), but none of the mice that
were homozygous for all three knockouts and positive for Fgfr3-
iCreER and ATOH1HA survived more than 4 days after Tamox in-
jection. Despite this limitation, the data demonstrate that deletion
of any two Rb-family proteins does not facilitate conversion of
PCs and DCs by ATOH1 in mature mouse cochleae. These find-
ings suggest that the conversion in CAP27 mice is independent of
an effect on Rb-family proteins and that, in mature PCs and DCs,
inhibition of ATOH1 function by p27 is noncanonical.
p27CKO Results in an Upregulation of GATA3 in Mature
PCs and DCs
To investigate why ATOH1-mediated conversion of PCs and
DCs declines after P12–P13, we examined the expression of
two known co-factors for ATOH1: GATA3 and TCF3 (Masuda
et al., 2012). Immunostaining for these factors revealed prevalent
expression of both GATA3 and TCF3 in neonatal SCs, including
PCs and DCs (Figures 4 and S5). At P30, TCF3 was still present
in most SCs, whereas GATA3 was undetectable in PCs and
DCs (Figures 4 and S5). This inverse correlation of GATA3
expression with age, and its role in facilitating the upregulation
of POU4F3 and MYO7A by ATOH1 (Masuda et al., 2012),
implicated GATA3 as a critical factor in ATOH1HA-mediated
conversion of SCs. To test whether GATA3 was mediating the
effect of p27CKO on ATOH1 function in mature PCs and DCs,
we first examined whether p27CKO could affect GATA3 expres-
sion. Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ mice, Fgfr3-iCreER+;p27CKO

 mice, and CAP27 mice were induced with Tamox at P28 and
stained for MYO6 and GATA3 at P49. Cell counts revealed
many more GATA3-positive PCs and DCs in the CAP27 and
the Fgfr3-iCreER+;p27CKO mice compared to the Fgfr3-
iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ mice (Figure 4). These data suggest that
p27CKO in adult PCs and DCs reinstates GATA3 expression to
a neonatal-like pattern.
GATA3 Facilitates ATOH1-Mediated Conversion of SCs
to HCs in the Mature Mouse Cochlea
Although PCs and DCs lost GATA3 expression with age, inner
phalangeal and border cells (IPh/BCs) (Figure 5A) remained
GATA3 immunopositive in adult cochleae. To test whether mature
IPh/BCs could respond to ATOH1HA, we bred GLAST-CreER
mice, in which Cre is active in IPh/BCs (Mellado Lagarde et al.,
2014), with Atoh1HA+ mice and induced with Tamox at P28.
Ectopic expression of ATOH1HA by itself resulted in the upregu-
lation of POU4F3 (not quantified) and MYO7A (50.75 ± 6.1 cHCs
per cochlea) in IPh/BCs (Figures 5 and S5). This positive correla-
tion of GATA3 expression and ATOH1 function in converting IPh/
BCs suggests that the lack of a similar response to ATOH1HA in
mature PCs and DCs is due to loss of GATA3 in those cells and
that p27CKO confers responsiveness to mature PCs and DCs
by reinstating GATA3 expression. To test this, we attempted to
conditionally delete GATA3 from IPh/BCs while ectopically ex-
pressing ATOH1HA (Glast-CreER;Atoh1HA;GATA3loxP/loxP), but

 these animals died within days of Tamox administration. As a sec-
ond approach, we bred Rosa26-GATA3 mice (Nguyen et al.,
2013) with Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ mice (Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1-
HA+;GATA3+) to ectopically express both GATA3 and ATOH1HA
in mature PCs and DCs. Similar to CAP27 mice, significantly more
PCs and DCs were converted to HCs by GATA3 and ATOH1HA
co-expression than ATOH1HA expression alone (Figures 5E–
5J). This suggests that GATA3 is a critical co-factor for ATOH1
in the initial regenerative conversion of SCs to HCs and that
the age-related decline of GATA3 in PCs and DCs prevents
ATOH1-mediated conversion.

Conversion of Adult Cochlear SCs to HCs
To further elucidate the role of GATA3 in converting mature
PCs and DCs to HCs, we sought to test the involvement of

generated a mouse line that simulta-
neously overexpresses hPOU4F3 and
the fluorescent marker mCherry upon
Cre
recombination
(Figure
S6).
By
breeding these mice with Fgfr3-iCreER+
mice, we were able to ectopically ex-
press hPOU4F3 in mature PCs and DCs
and fate map the affected mCherry-pos-
itive cells. A number of cells were positive
for both mCherry and either PVALB
(1.9% ± 0.8% of mCherry+ cells) or
MYO7A (2.1% ± 0.8% of mCherry+
cells),
demonstrating
that
ectopic
hPOU4F3 can upregulate HC-specific
markers in mature SCs (Figures 6 and
S6). Although more PCs and DCs could
be
induced
to
express
PVALB
or
MYO7A by ectopic POU4F3-mCherry
than by ATOH1HA, the phenotype for
ectopic hPOU4F3 was not as robust as
the CAP27 phenotype. This suggests
that
both
ATOH1
and
POU4F3
are
needed to elicit the upregulation of HC
markers in a greater number of PCs and
DCs. To test this, we bred POU4F3-
mCherry
mice
with
Fgfr3-iCreER+;
Atoh1HA
mice
and
ectopically
ex-
pressed both hPOU4F3 and ATOH1 in
mature PCs and DCs (Fgfr3-iCreER+;
Atoh1HA+;POU4F3-mCherry+).
This
combined expression resulted in even
more

(16.5%

mCherry+ cells) and MYO7A+ (20.7% ± 3.3% of mCherry+
cells) cHCs than in either Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+ or Fgfr3-
iCreER+;POU4F3-mCherry+ mice (Figures 6 and S6). These
data demonstrate that POU4F3 alone can upregulate HC-spe-
cific markers in mature PCs and DCs and that POU4F3

 combined with ATOH1 causes the conversion of greater
numbers of PCs and DCs than either ATOH1 or POU4F3 alone.
DISCUSSION
Sensorineural hearing loss is one of the most common and costly
long-term disabilities because rehabilitation is limited by a lack
of cochlear HC regeneration. Attention has focused on ectopic
ATOH1 as a potential gene therapy for HC regeneration; how-
ever, studies from our lab and others suggest that ATOH1 is inef-
ficient in converting SCs to HCs in adult cochleae. Here we show
that p27CKO potentiates the effect of ectopic ATOH1 in adult
mice, causing upregulation of HC-specific markers in mature
PCs and DCs in both the undamaged and the damaged context.
This finding reveals key players in the initiation of regeneration in
a model that is highly resistant to reprogramming, becomes even
more resistant with age, and is directly linked to a widespread
human health condition. In addition, the notion that ATOH1 can
generate new HCs in adult cochleae has been controversial.
Several studies (Izumikawa et al., 2008; Kelly et al., 2012; Liu
et al., 2012) suggest that ATOH1 is ineffectual in converting
SCs to HCs in mature or damaged ears, particularly in genetic
mouse models. Other reports suggest that virally transduced
ATOH1 (Izumikawa et al., 2005; Kawamoto et al., 2003; Kraft
et al., 2013) can convert SCs to HCs in mature rodent cochleae.
Our data suggest that responsiveness to ATOH1 varies across
SC subtypes and that mature PCs and DCs specifically are unre-
sponsive to ATOH1. Because viral transduction of ATOH1 af-
fects SCs other than PCs and DCs (Atkinson et al., 2014; Kawa-
moto et al., 2003; Kraft et al., 2013), the difference in target cells
may explain the paradox. The data here show that adult PCs and
DCs can be made to respond to ectopic ATOH1 via additional
manipulations of p27, GATA3, or hPOU4F3. This is significant,
not only because it helps to reconcile the controversy concern-
ing ATOH1 activity in adult SCs but also because PCs and
DCs represent highly attractive targets for HC regeneration.
Location is critical to HC function; therefore, the optimal
approach to HC regeneration would be one in which newly
generated HCs replace endogenous OHCs not only in number
but positionally as well. PCs and DCs are intercalated between
and beneath the existing OHCs, and they exhibit nuclear migra-
tion into the HC layer upon conversion. In contrast, other SCs
would have to be induced to migrate along the mediolateral
axis to replace endogenous OHCs. Furthermore, in cell popula-
tions that do respond to ATOH1, the number of cells that convert
is low. Targeting p27, GATA3, or POU4F3 in conjunction with
ATOH1 can therefore lead to increased numbers of converted
cells by expanding the pool of responsive cells to include PCs
and DCs. Such an increase could prove beneficial to ATOH1
gene therapies that are being developed.
In addition to its usefulness for regenerative strategies, the
findings pertaining to p27CKO provide insight into uncharacter-
ized roles of p27. Specifically, the data suggest that the con-
version of mature PCs and DCs by ATOH1HA and p27CKO is
independent of Rb-family inactivation. Although cyclin/CDK
complexes could still be involved in the observed phenotypes,
the apparent lack of involvement of Rb, p107, or p130 suggests
a noncanonical response to p27CKO. Loss of p27 resulted in
GATA3 upregulation in PCs and DCs. To our knowledge, there
is no precedent for p27 in regulation of GATA3 expression or in
HC differentiation. These findings have numerous implications
because p27 is present in many cell and tissue types and impor-
tant in development, aging, and cancer, in which cell differentia-
tion is an important process (Chu et al., 2008; Pruitt et al., 2013;
Teratake et al., 2016). Similarly, GATA3 is a critical transcription
factor in many cell types and cell processes, including T cell dif-
ferentiation, neurosensory development, and tumor progression
and metastasis (Du et al., 2015; Duncan and Fritzsch, 2013; Si
et al., 2015; Van de Walle et al., 2016). If and how p27 regulates
GATA3 expression in these and other cells, tissues, and pro-
cesses therefore remain intriguing and open questions.
GATA3 expression declines in cochlear SCs after gestation, as
has been previously demonstrated (Rivolta and Holley, 1998).
The data here suggest a refinement of that observation in that
GATA3 was most prominently lost from PCs and DCs but re-
mained detectable in IPh/BCs, Hensen cells, and Claudius cells.
In addition, our data suggest that GATA3 is sufficient to restore
neonatal-like responsiveness of PCs and DCs to ATOH1. These
findings suggest an important role for GATA3 in regeneration and
aging, in which loss of GATA3 correlates with senescence and
persistence of GATA3 correlates with greater regenerative po-
tential. It has been suggested that GATA3 is universally impor-
tant in tissue regeneration, playing roles in neural, cardiac, and
fin regeneration in zebrafish (Stra
¨ hle and Schmidt, 2012). In the
cochlea, SCs of the types shown here to be GATA3+ are gener-
ally more proliferative, more regenerative, and more responsive
to manipulations intended to induce a cell fate change (Kamiya
et al., 2001; Kawamoto et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2012; Kuo
et al., 2015; Mellado Lagarde et al., 2014). Because human
cochleae become mature and functional during fetal develop-
ment (Clark-Gambelunghe and Clark, 2015), the current murine
data suggest that human GATA3 expression may already be
lost from PCs and DCs by birth. Therefore, it may be of profound
importance to determine whether GATA3 is similarly lost from
SCs in humans as a result of development or aging. If GATA3
does decline with age in humans, the success of ATOH1-medi-
ated therapies may be hindered. However, the findings here sug-
gest that simultaneous ectopic expression of GATA3 and ATOH1
could bolster the effectiveness of such an approach.
In both CAP27 and Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+;GATA3+ strains,
the increased expression of POU4F3 was particularly robust. In
addition, ectopic hPOU4F3 caused the upregulation of HC-spe-
cific markers in mature PCs and DCs, and co-manipulation of
hPOU4F3 and ATOH1 led to increased conversion of PCs and
DCs compared to manipulation of either gene individually. There-
fore, POU4F3 appears to be an important factor in HC regenera-
tion. This is consistent with previous findings that suggested a
synergistic role for POU4F3 in helping ATOH1 to upregulate
MYO7A in embryonic, nonsensory progenitor cells (Ikeda et al.,
2015; Masuda et al., 2012). Our data extend these findings
to demonstrate a direct role for POU4F3 in the conversion of
adult cochlear SCs to HCs in vivo. However, despite robust
upregulation of POU4F3 in most PCs and DCs in CAP27, Fgfr3-
iCreER+;Atoh1HA+;GATA3+,
and
Fgfr3-iCreER+;Atoh1HA+;
POU4F3-mCherry+ models, only a limited number of cells
upregulated PVALB or MYO7A. This is consistent with the low

Cell Reports 19, 307–320, April 11, 2017
 numbers of cHCs that have been generated in previous models of
ATOH1 overexpression, where it is presumed POU4F3 was also
upregulated, and in our current model, where POU4F3 was
directly, ectopically expressed. These findings suggest that the
low efficiency of conversion in ectopic Atoh1 models may be
due not to an inability of ATOH1 to bind to and activate its target
genes but rather to an inability of POU4F3 to bind to and activate
its target genes. It is therefore likely that factors that improve
accessibility to, or activation of, POU4F3 target genes (e.g.,
epigenetic factors or transcriptional co-factors) would be useful
in increasing the numbers of cHCs in ATOH1 models. The data
strongly suggest that POU4F3 is critical in ATOH1-mediated SC
to HC conversion, particularly in the mature cochlea, and that
POU4F3 represents a therapeutic target, the activity of which
could be enhanced independently or in conjunction with ATOH1
to initiate auditory HC regeneration.
Finally, we provide here a more detailed description of a ge-
netic pathway in the initial events of regenerating HCs from
SCs. However, the regenerative phenotypes described are
clearly incomplete. Although p27CKO, or ectopic expression of
GATA3 or hPOU4F3, is able to overcome the age limitation of
ATOH1-mediated SC conversion, the converted cells are still
immature, lacking appropriate bundle morphology and failing
to express the mature HC marker prestin. In addition, only a
limited number of cHCs could be produced in the models pre-
sented, and some of the cHCs exhibited clear signs of apoptotic
cell death. To have regeneration that can lead to functional re-
covery, additional targets need to be identified that can increase
the numbers of new HCs generated and promote the maturation
and survival of the cHCs. Multiple genes, in addition to those
identified here, will most likely need to be manipulated. For
example, ectopic espin1, concomitant to p27 and ATOH1 or
hPOU4F3 and ATOH1 manipulations, may be useful in promot-
ing normal bundle morphology (Taura et al., 2016). Furthermore,
the enhancement of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, in addition to the
manipulations described earlier, could increase the number of
cells that convert to HCs (Kuo et al., 2015; Ni et al., 2016).
In summary, we show the substantive conversion of adult PCs
and DCs specifically into HCs using three combinatorial genetic
approaches, thus establishing a genetic pathway for the initiation
of HC regeneration in the mature mammalian cochlea. This iden-
tification of several key molecular players in the initial steps of HC
regeneration in the mature cochlea will hopefully act as a founda-
tion for improving genetic and small-molecule approaches to
auditory HC regeneration and the rehabilitation of hearing
following SNHL. It should also improve our understanding of
the interactions and functions of several factors (p27, GATA3,
POU4F3, and ATOH1) that are critical to numerous biological
processes.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and Housing
Animals were housed in the animal resources center at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital according to approved Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) protocols and guidelines. Mice were provided food and
water ad libitum and maintained in a 12:12 light:dark cycle. Generation of the
genetic mouse models ATOH1HA, Fgfr3-iCreER, Glast-CreER, p27loxP/loxP, GA-
TA3loxP/loxP, Rb1loxP/loxP, p130loxP/loxP, p107KO, and Rosa26-GATA3 have been
described previously (Table S1). hPOU4F3-overexpressing mice (POU4F3-
mCherry) were generated by pronuclear injection of a purified bicistronic trans-
gene containing a CAG promoter, followed by the open reading frame (ORF) of
hPOU4F3; an IRES2 internal ribosome entry site; and the coding sequence for
the mCherry fluorescent protein, followed by a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-
transcriptional response element and an SV40 poly(A) (Simian virus 40 late poly-
adenylation signal) terminator sequence (Figure S6). Although four potential
founders genotyped positive for the POU4F3-mCherry transgene, mCherry fluo-
rescence upon Cre recombination was only observed in offspring from one
founder, and this line was used for the experiments described.
For all experiments, sample sizes were n = 4 experimental animals and n = 4
controls, except for the noise damage experiment, in which we used three
experimental mice and three controls, and for the cleaved caspase-3 staining,
in which we used n = 2 experimental mice and n = 2 controls. Experiments
used balanced male-to-female ratios except for the POU4F3-mCherry experi-
ments, in which only females were used due to a lower rate of recombination
and mCherry expression observed in males from this strain. For all experiments,
mice were injected with Tamox (Sigma, 250 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]) at P28
and euthanized at P49, except in three cases: (1) the initial characterization of
the POU4F3-mCherry mice (Figures 6A and 6B) (Tamox at 75 mg/kg [i.p.] on
P12 and P13 and euthanasia at P35), (2) the mice provided BrdU (Sigma) at
2 mg/mL in the drinking water for 14 days following Tamox (250 mg/kg [i.p.]
on P28 and euthanasia at P42), and (3) the CAP27 mice analyzed at a 6-week
survival point (Figure S2). Upon euthanasia, temporal bones were quickly
removed and immersed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Anesthetized mice were perfused with fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M CaCO4 [pH 7.4]). The inner ears were further
perfused via the round window using the same fixative solution and decalcified
in fixative containing 150 mM EDTA using a Pelco Biowave microwave tissue
processor (Ted Pella). Samples were critical point dried (Tousimis Sandai 790)
and mounted with conductive silver paint. Samples were then coated using
horizontally placed stubs in a Denton Desk II Sputter Coater and coated with
less than 20 nm of iridium. All samples were examined in a Teneo VS scanning
electron microscope (FEI).
Immunostaining
Temporal bones were decalcified in 0.125 M EDTA in PBS for 48 hr before
microdissection of the organ of Corti. Tissues were immunostained using an-
tibodies and dilutions listed in Table 1. Samples were imaged using either an

 LSM700 or an LSM710 point-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Where possible, samples were counterstained with Hoechst nuclear dye
(Life Technologies) or with Alexa-conjugated phalloidin (Life Technologies) to
label hair bundles and other actin-rich structures. Where necessary, TSA
amplification kits (Life Technologies) were used to amplify signal according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Data Analysis
Immunopositive cells were counted manually from images of whole-mounted
cochleae using Zen and LSM browser software packages (Carl Zeiss). For PCs
and DCs that were positive for HA, GATA3, and/or POU4F3, counts were ob-
tained from nine representative images per cochlea (average: 268 ± 3 mm in
length per image) separated by roughly equal distances along the tonotopic
axis and covering apical, middle, and basal turns. The densities of positive
cells per micrometer were then extrapolated to a 6 mm total cochlear length.
For the remaining HC markers that were labeled (PVALB, MYO6, Calb, and
prestin), counts were taken from the entire cochlear sample. For all images,
cochlear length was measured as described previously (Liu et al., 2013). For
all experiments, two-tailed t tests were conducted, and where applicable,
Bonferroni corrections were used. All statistical analyses were conducted
using SPSS 17.0 (IBM).
