The abundance of mRNA is mainly determined by the rates of RNA transcription and decay.
Here, we present a method for unbiased estimation of differential mRNA decay rate from
RNA-sequencing data by modeling the kinetics of mRNA metabolism. We show that in all
primary human tissues tested, and particularly in the central nervous system, many pathways
are regulated at the mRNA stability level. We present a parsimonious regulatory model
consisting of two RNA-binding proteins and four microRNAs that modulate the mRNA
stability landscape of the brain, which suggests a new link between RBFOX proteins and
Alzheimer’s disease. We show that downregulation of RBFOX1 leads to destabilization of
mRNAs encoding for synaptic transmission proteins, which may contribute to the loss of
synaptic function in Alzheimer’s disease. RBFOX1 downregulation is more likely to occur in
older and female individuals, consistent with the association of Alzheimer’s disease with age
and gender.

 T
he mRNA decay rate is a key determinant of steady-state
mRNA abundance. Measuring the mRNA decay rate
generally involves time series examination of mRNA
abundance following blockage of transcription1,2, or monitoring
the abundance of labeled mRNA using high-throughput pulse-
chase methods3,4. These methods are mostly suitable for analysis
of cell cultures, however, and cannot be used for measuring
mRNA decay rate in tissue samples.
In principle, it should be possible to measure the decay rate of
mRNAs by decoupling the transcription rate from the steady-
state mRNA abundance. It has been suggested that, while exonic
read counts in RNA-seq data correspond to steady-state mRNA
abundance, changes in the abundance of intronic reads can be
used to estimate the change in transcription rate5–7. Therefore,
RNA-seq reflects a snapshot of both steady-state mRNA level and
transcriptional activity, providing the possibility for deconvolving
the mRNA decay rate from RNA-seq data.
This concept has been recently suggested to capture the dif-
ferential mRNA decay rate in a wide set of contexts5, where the
change in mRNA half-life is estimated as the difference of the
logarithm of fold-change of exonic reads and the logarithm of
fold-change of intronic reads (Δexon–Δintron). Here, we show
that this measure is highly biased, and generally overestimates the
stability of slow-transcribing mRNAs and underestimates the
stability of fast-transcribing mRNAs. We propose a generalizable
approach for correcting this bias, and use it to investigate the
post-transcriptional regulatory programs of a panel of human
tissues.
Our results indicate that mRNA stability plays an integral role
in shaping the transcriptomes of all tested tissues, particularly
those of the central nervous system. We show that a substantial
portion of the brain mRNA stability profile can be explained by
the functions of two RNA-binding protein families (the RBFOX
and ZFP36 families) and four miRNAs (miR-124, miR-29, miR-9,
and miR-128). The RBFOX targets are enriched for mRNAs that
encode synaptic transmission proteins, and are destabilized in the
brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We show
that knockdown of RBFOX1 can partially recreate the AD sta-
bility profile, and its expression rescues the normal transcriptome,
suggesting a link between dysregulation of RBFOX1 and AD.
Results
Decoupling of changes in transcription and mRNA decay rates.
Several recent studies have used the difference of the logarithm of
fold-change of exonic reads and the logarithm of fold-change of
intronic reads (Δexon–Δintron) as an estimate of the change in
mRNA half-life5,8. However, by considering a simple model of
RNA metabolism (Fig. 1a) and solving the kinetic equations of
this model (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1), we found that
Δexon–Δintron is affected by a “bias term” that depends on the
maximum capacity of the pre-mRNA processing machinery,
which is limited in the cell9, as well as the change in transcription
rate (Fig. 1b). The presence of this bias leads to a negative cor-
relation between Δexon–Δintron and differential transcription
rate. In other words, even in the absence of any change in mRNA
stability, Δexon–Δintron would still be positive for genes that
were transcriptionally downregulated, and negative for genes that
were transcriptionally upregulated (Fig. 1c).
To test this model, we measured Δexon–Δintron for human
genes using RNA-seq data from a panel of 20 human tissues10.
Indeed, we observed a significant negative trend between Δexon–
Δintron and the change in transcription rate (Fig. 1d and
Supplementary Fig. 2a), in agreement with our model. Other data
sets that we analyzed also showed the same trend, including
RNA-seq data from Illumina BodyMap 2.0, data from nine
human cell lines from ENCODE11, and three RNA-seq datasets
from mouse12–14 (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), suggesting that this
bias is not data-set-specific or species-specific. This correlation
was not due to inaccuracies in estimating Δexon and Δintron
from low read counts, since a negative correlation could be
observed for gene sets with varying read coverage (Fig. 1e). In
fact, higher expression was associated with larger magnitudes of
bias (Fig. 1e), consistent with our kinetic model in which
saturation of the pre-mRNA processing machinery results in a
steeper
bias
(Fig.
1c).
This
bias
in
Δexon–Δintron
can
substantially confound downstream analysis of mRNA stability
programs. For example, in several tissues, pathways that are
transcriptionally downregulated generally appear to be stabilized
at the mRNA level (Supplementary Fig. 2c), and in other tissues
the bias in Δexon–Δintron partially masks the synergy between
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of pathways
(Supplementary Fig. 2d).
We devised a computational framework that estimates the
transcription rate-dependent bias from RNA-seq data and
subtracts
it
from
Δexon–Δintron
(Methods,
Fig.
2a
and
Supplementary Fig. 3), providing unbiased estimates of differ-
ential mRNA half-life. Although this framework makes simplify-
ing assumptions, such as invariability of some of the kinetic
parameters of mRNA metabolism (see Methods), our simulations
suggest that even when these assumptions are not met, this
framework should still provide more accurate estimates of mRNA
stability compared to uncorrected Δexon–Δintron (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). To empirically evaluate our method, we analyzed the
RNA-seq data15 from the breast carcinoma cell line MDA and
the in vivo-selected highly metastatic sub-line MDA-LM216. We
analyzed this dataset because a large number of mRNAs were
previously identified as stabilized or destabilized in MDA-LM2
cells compared to the parental MDA line17 using BRIC-seq18.
Our analysis showed that for highly biased genes, uncorrected
Δexon–Δintron is not an accurate estimate of differential
stability, as expected from our kinetic model. In fact, when the
magnitude of the bias term was large, uncorrected Δexon–
Δintron was on average higher for LM2-destabilized genes and
lower for LM2-stabilized genes (Fig. 2b). In contrast, our
framework provided estimates that were overall consistent with
the BRIC-seq differential stability measurements, even for highly
biased genes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). To further
evaluate our method, we selected six additional genes that did not
have statistically significant differences in BRIC-seq measure-
ments between MDA-parental and MDA-LM2 cells, and had the
largest bias based on analysis of RNA-seq data (see Methods):
three of these genes appeared to be significantly more stable in
LM2 cells based on Δexon–Δintron, but after bias correction
were inferred to be more stable in MDA cells; the other three
genes showed the reverse pattern. We measured the stability of
these genes in MDA-parental and MDA-LM2 cells by α-amanitin
inhibition of transcription followed by qRT-PCR. Of the six genes
that
we
examined,
four
genes
indeed
showed
significant
differential stability (P < 0.05). In all four cases, the direction of
the change in stability was consistent with the bias-corrected
predictions but not with the uncorrected Δexon–Δintron (Fig. 2c).
Additional analysis for comparison of Δexon–Δintron and our
unbiased estimates of stability can be found in Supplementary
Fig. 5c, d). We have implemented our computational framework

and
observed widespread tissue-specific differences in the mRNA
stability profiles (Supplementary Fig. 6). Comparison of these
stability profiles with those obtained from a panel of mouse tis-
sues suggests a high degree of conservation across species (Sup-
plementary Fig. 7). Furthermore, genes that are involved in the
same pathway are often
co-regulated post-transcriptionally
(Supplementary Fig. 8). In particular, pathway analysis of mRNA
stability profiles revealed a large number of biological processes
specifically upregulated or downregulated in the brain, suggesting
a prominent role of post-transcriptional programs in shaping the
brain transcriptome. This observation prompted us to take a
closer look at regulation of mRNA stability in this tissue, since
systematic analyses of mRNA stability programs in the brain are
scarce, and it is not clear which factors contribute the most to the
mRNA stability landscape of the brain.
We began by examining the potential binding sites of all
human RBPs with available sequence preferences19 as well as all
conserved miRNAs20, and used multiple linear regression to
identify factors whose binding to 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of
mRNA was predictive of mRNA stability in the brain (see
Methods for more details). This analysis identified four miRNAs
and two RBPs that were significantly predictive of brain mRNA
stability (Fig. 3a). Specifically, presence of 3′ UTR binding sites
for miR-124, miR-29, miR-9 and miR-128 was significantly
associated with reduced mRNA stability, whereas binding sites of
RBFOX and ZFP36 families of RBPs were significantly associated
with increased stability.
Of the four miRNAs that were significant, three miRNAs, miR-
124, miR-9, and miR-128, show highly specific expression in the
brain, based on a dataset of miRNA expression profiles across 40
human tissue samples21 (Fig. 3b), which is consistent with the
observed brain-specific destabilization of their targets. Of these
miRNAs, miR-124 and miR-9 are involved in development and
function of the nervous system22,23, and de-regulation of miR-128
is associated with tumors of the nervous system24,25. All four
miRNAs have been previously shown to be able to decrease the
abundance of their target transcripts26–30, suggesting that they
can indeed destabilize their targets. Also, of the two RBP families

 whose target transcripts were significantly up-regulated in brain,
the RBFOX proteins show brain-specific expression (Fig. 3c),
consistent with previous studies suggesting that RBFOX proteins
stabilize their target mRNAs19,31. In contrast, ZFP36 destabilizes
its targets by binding to their 3′ UTRs32, in agreement with highly
specific downregulation of ZFP36 gene and its paralog, ZFP36L1,
in the brain (Fig. 3c). This suggests that ZFP36/ZFP36L1 proteins
bind to the 3′ UTR of brain-specific mRNAs to destabilize them
in non-neural tissues, resulting in highly specific expression of
these genes primarily in brain where ZFP36/ZFP36L1 proteins
are absent. The genes encoding for RBFOX and ZFP36 families of
proteins themselves appear to be mostly regulated at the
transcription level, based on analysis of intronic reads (Fig. 3d).
Therefore, we propose a regulatory model in which brain-specific
transcriptional activation/inhibition of these two RBPs establishes
a post-transcriptional program that stabilizes brain-specific
mRNAs (Fig. 3e). Together with rapid decay of non-neural
transcripts by miRNAs, this parsimonious regulatory model,
which consists of only six regulatory factors (Fig. 3e), explains
~10% of the observed variance of the mRNA stability profile of
the brain, compared to ~31% of the variance that is reproducible
across samples/platforms (Fig. 3f). Furthermore, this model is
able to distinguish transcripts that show reproducible brain-
specific stabilization from those that show destabilization, with an
AUROC of 0.86 (area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve, Supplementary Fig. 9).
Dysregulation of RBFOX programs in Alzheimer’s disease. We
combined the stability profiles of mRNAs in human brain with
the binding site predictions of the miRNAs and RBPs to recon-
struct a high-confidence network of mRNA stability programs in
brain (available at http://csg.lab.mcgill.ca/sup/pan_stability/). We
considered a transcript to be a regulatory target of one of the six
factors discussed in the previous section if that transcript had a
putative binding site for that factor in its 3′ UTR, and the pre-
sence of the binding site was necessary to explain the stability of
the transcript in the brain even after taking into account the effect
of other stability factors (see Methods). This network overall
encompasses 2499 interactions between six regulatory factors
(four miRNAs and two RBPs) and 2138 transcripts (Fig. 4a).
Several lines of evidence suggest that the edges in this regulatory
network are more likely to represent bona-fide regulatory inter-
actions than sequence-based binding site predictions alone.
Specifically, high-confidence predicted RBFOX stability targets
are 2.8-fold more likely to be bound by RBFOX proteins than
transcripts that only have a match to the RBFOX motif in their 3’
UTR (Fisher’s exact test P < 4 × 10–12, Fig. 4b), based on com-
parison to HITS-CLIP data of Rbfox1/2/3 in mouse brain33 (see
Methods). Similarly, ZFP36 high-confidence targets are more
likely to be bound and downregulated by ectopically expressed
ZFP36 in HEK293T cells34 (Fisher’s exact test P < 0.05, Fig. 4c).
High-confidence predicted targets of miR-124 are also 3.6-fold
more likely to be downregulated in HeLa cells that express an
ectopic copy of miR-12426, compared to transcripts that only
have a match to miR-124 seed sequence (Fisher’s exact test
P < 3 × 10–6, Fig. 4d). Furthermore, our high-confidence network
is significantly enriched for experimentally validated interactions
that are collected from the literature for each of the four miRNAs

TargetScan20, which uses conservation to identify miRNA targets,
shows an even larger enrichment of functional miRNA-target
interactions compared to either method alone (Supplementary
Fig. 10b, c), suggesting that our method provides orthogonal
information compared to conservation-based approaches.
We observed significant enrichment of several pathways related
to neuronal function among the stability targets of RBPs in our
high-confidence network (Supplementary Fig. 11). Of particular
note, we found that the RBFOX network is most highly enriched
for genes that are involved in synaptic transmission (2.4-fold
enrichment, Fisher’s exact test P < 1 × 10–9). Synaptic transmis-
sion is the main pathway that is affected in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD)36, suggesting that a defect in the RBFOX stability program
could lead to de-regulation of synaptic genes and, subsequently,
result in AD or AD-like phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we
analyzed the RNA-seq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex of six patients with advanced AD as well as five control
subjects37 (see Methods), using our computational framework for
obtaining unbiased estimates of mRNA stability. Interestingly, we
found that the average mRNA stability profile of AD is
significantly anti-correlated with the brain stability signature that
we obtained from analysis of the panel of 20 tissues (r = –0.13,
P < 2 × 10–35, Supplementary Fig. 12a), indicating that brain-
specific transcripts are, on average, destabilized in advanced AD.
The pathway that showed the most significant enrichment among
the top destabilized genes was synaptic transmission (Supple-
mentary Fig. 12b), supporting the hypothesis that destabilization
of synaptic transmission genes may be associated with AD.
Indeed, the stability targets of RBFOX showed a large enrichment
among genes that are destabilized in the average AD brain
(Mann–Whitney U-test P < 3 × 10–10, Fig. 5a and Supplementary
Fig. 13a). Given that many of RBFOX targets are specifically
expressed in neurons, one possibility is that downregulation of
these transcripts reflects neuronal loss, which is commonly seen
in advanced AD36. However, we observed that RBFOX targets
were significantly more downregulated compared to other
neuron-specific genes (Supplementary Fig. 13b). In addition,
RBFOX targets whose expression is not limited to neural cells
were also downregulated in AD (Supplementary Fig. 13c)—a
change in the ratio of neural cells would have a relatively small

 impact on the apparent abundance of these transcripts since they
are also expressed in other cell types, suggesting that the observed
destabilization of RBFOX targets is not an artifact of neuronal
loss in AD. These observations are not data-set-specific, and we

patients and four control subjects38 (Supplementary Fig. 14). In
addition, the intersection of RBFOX stability target set and the

Fig. 5b). These results suggest that RBFOX-bound transcripts that
encode synaptic transmission proteins are destabilized in AD.
Among the three RBFOX proteins, we found that the
transcription of RBFOX1 gene is significantly reduced in the
AD brain compared to control samples (two-tailed t-test
P < 0.008, Supplementary Fig. 15a). This observation is supported
by analysis of a larger dataset of microarray measurements39,
which shows ~ 2-fold decrease in the abundance of RBFOX1
mRNA in AD subjects compared to normal individuals (two-
tailed t-test P < 3 × 10–53, Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 15b). In
contrast, other neuron-specific genes showed only a median
downregulation of 1.2-fold in AD (Supplementary Fig. 15b). This
suggests that RBFOX1 downregulation may contribute to the
deregulation of the RBFOX stability program in AD. Indeed,
we observed that RNAi-mediated knockdown of RBFOX1 in
differentiated primary human neural progenitor cells40 leads to a
transcriptome shift that is significantly correlated with the AD
stability signature (r = 0.13, P < 4 × 10–33, Fig. 5d). Furthermore,
the predicted RBFOX stability targets are most highly enriched
among transcripts that are both destabilized in AD and down-
regulated by RBFOX1 knockdown (Fig. 5d). This can also be
observed in mouse neurons, where knockdown of Rbfox1/3 leads
to downregulation of the orthologs of AD-destabilized RBFOX
targets, and ectopic expression of a cytoplasmic form of Rbfox1
rescues the expression of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Discussion
By inferring mRNA half-life from RNA-seq data, we were able to
obtain a global view of the mRNA stability landscape of human
tissues, which revealed a prominent role of mRNA stability in
shaping the transcriptome of the brain. By combining the brain
mRNA stability signature with the consensus sequence binding
preferences of miRNAs and RBPs, we identified four miRNAs
and two RBPs as the primary determinants of mRNA stability in
the brain. It is, however, important to note that the consensus
binding preferences of RBPs and miRNAs are often poor pre-
dictors of their in vivo binding sites, and spurious matches to
these consensus sequences are abundant. Among factors that
contribute to such false positive hits are the RNA structure41 and
the inaccuracies in known consensus binding sequences42. Our
high-confidence stability network (Fig. 4a) reduces these false
positives by identifying “functional” targets of each factor, i.e.

 mRNAs that not only have a sequence match to its consensus
binding sequence, but also have a stability that is consistent with
the effect of binding of that factor. Interestingly, even though we
did not use structural information to construct our high-
confidence network, the expected structural preferences of RBPs
are reflected in this network, with high-confidence RBFOX1 and
ZFP36 binding sites showing higher local accessibility compared
to spurious sequence matches (Supplementary Fig. 17a, b).

stability with consensus binding preferences, we can overcome
some of the challenges in computational identification of the true

Among the factors that we studied in brain, RBFOX proteins
are primarily known for their role in regulating alternative
splicing43, and more recently as potential regulators of mRNA
stability19,31. Surprisingly, we found that RBFOX proteins reg-
ulate transcripts that are functionally relevant to development of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and are destabilized in brains of AD
patients. Intriguingly, the RBFOX1 gene itself is downregulated in
AD, consistent with previous studies that have found an asso-
ciation between rare heterozygous deletions overlapping the
RBFOX1 locus and early-onset familial AD44. Furthermore, we
found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of RBFOX1 is able to
partially recreate the AD stability signature in human neural

 progenitor cells, suggesting a role of RBFOX1 in AD-associated
changes in neural cells.
An almost-invariable feature of Alzheimer’s disease is synaptic
impairment, which is often associated with aggregation of
β-amyloids45. RBFOX1 is previously reported to regulate the
splicing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), with de-regulation
of this splicing program leading to an APP isoform that con-
tributes to β-amyloid aggregation46. Here, our analyses suggest an
alternative association between RBFOX1 and AD, where down-
regulation of RBFOX1 may directly affect the stability and
abundance of mRNAs that encode synaptic transmission pro-
teins. If this is the case, then we should expect a correlation
between the extent of RBFOX1 downregulation and the severity
of de-regulation of synaptic transmission pathway in AD patients.
Indeed, there is a strong correlation between RBFOX1 expression
and abundance of RBFOX-regulated synaptic genes across 310
AD individuals (median r = 0.62, two sided t-test P < 3 × 10–6,
Fig. 5e).
These findings provide new insights into pathways that may
lead to increased risk of development of AD. For example, while
the primary risk factors of AD are age and gender47, the
mechanisms
through
which
these
factors
affect
the
AD-
susceptibility are largely unknown. Surprisingly, we found that
RBFOX1 expression is highly correlated with gender in both
normal and AD individuals, and with age in normal individuals.
Specifically, RBFOX1 is expressed at lower levels in females
(Fig. 5c) and older subjects (Figs. 5c, f), consistent with higher
risk of AD in these individuals. These associations, however, can
only partially explain the large magnitude of differences that are
seen between AD and healthy individuals (Figs. 5c, f), consistent
with the notion that AD is a complex and multi-factor disease48.
Furthermore, interpretation of AD transcriptomics data is parti-
cularly challenging given the confounding effect of neuronal loss
on gene expression measurements, despite our attempts to con-
trol for this confounding factor in our analyses (Supplementary
Figs. 13 and 15).
Together with the functional relevance of RBFOX1 stability
targets, and the similarity of the expression profile of RBFOX1-
deficient cells with the stability profile of AD brain, these
observations suggest that defects in RBFOX1 stability program
may contribute to the loss of synaptic function in AD. We note
that, based on our analysis of tissue-specific RNA-seq data,
mRNA stability plays a pivotal role in shaping the transcriptome
and the landscape of active biological processes in many tissues
(Supplementary Figs. 6–8), and therefore de-regulation of pro-
grams that modulate mRNA stability are likely to lead to various
diseases beyond those of the nervous system. Our method for
obtaining unbiased estimates of mRNA stability can be applied to
a wide range of diseases with available RNA-seq data to reveal
disease-associated stability programs.
Methods
RNA-seq and microarray data. For analysis of human tissues, RNA-seq data of
20 human tissues were obtained from ref. 10 (SRA accession SRP056969). For
analysis of AD-associated stability programs, RNA-seq data from brain tissue of
nine AD and eight control individuals were obtained from ref. 37 (GEO accession
GSE53697). For analysis of MDA-parental and MDA-LM2 cells, RNA-seq data
from ref. 15 were used (GEO accession GSE45162). Reads were mapped to the hg19
assembly of human genome using TopHat249 (or HISAT250 in case of MDA/LM2
data) with default parameters. Intronic and exonic coordinates of genes were
extracted from GENCODE v1951, and gene-level read counts were calculated for
introns and exons separately using HTSeq52, including only reads with MAPQ
score ≥ 30. Three AD and three control individuals from ref. 37 were excluded, as
analysis of their RNA-seq data resulted in a disproportionately large number of
genes with zero mapped reads and an unusual clustering of these samples (Sup-
plementary Fig. 18), possibly due to low sequencing read quality.
Mouse tissue RNA-seq data were obtained from ref. 53 (GEO accession
GSE29278), and were mapped to mm10 assembly using HISAT250. Gene-level
intronic and exonic read counts were obtained as above, using Ensembl54 release 87
annotations.
Microarray data from 310 AD and 157 control individuals were obtained from
ref. 39. Gene-level abundances in each sample were obtained by averaging the
relative intensities of probes that mapped to the same gene (logarithm of ratio of
probe intensity between the two channels, with one channel representing pooled
RNA reference sample).
Gene-level exonic and intronic read counts for Illumina BodyMap 2.0,
ENCODE RNA-seq data for cell lines HMEC, NHEK, HUVEC, HSMM, NHLF, H1
hESC, HepG2, GM12878, and K562, as well as RNA-seq datasets presented in
Supplementary Figs. 2b and 5 were obtained from ref. 5. Other RNA-seq and
microarray measurements used in this work were taken directly from the
supplementary data of their respective publications.
Modeling the pre-mRNA and mRNA abundance. The model of RNA metabolism
we used includes three main steps (Fig. 1a). For each gene, DNA is first transcribed
to produce pre-mRNA at rate Vt, following zero-order production kinetics with
rate constant kt. Then, the pre-mRNA is processed into mature mRNA at rate Vp
following Michaelis–Menten kinetics, with parameters Vp,max as the maximum
processing rate obtained at saturating levels of the pre-mRNA, and Michaelis
constant Kp representing the pre-mRNA concentration at which Vp is equal to
half of Vp,max. Michaelis-Menten is one of the simplest approaches to model
kinetics of saturation, and is applied widely to enzymatic reactions, including
RNA processing9. The mature mRNA is degraded at rate Vd, which follows
first-order elimination kinetics5, with a decay rate constant of kd. At steady state,
the input and output of the system must be equal, and therefore the rate of
transcription is equal to the mRNA decay rate5, as well as the rate of mRNA
processing.
Subsequently, we modeled the ratio of abundance of each of pre-mRNA and
mature mRNA between any two samples s and s′ as a function of kt and k′t,
representing the transcription rate in the two samples, respectively, and kd and k′d,
representing the decay rate constant in the two samples, respectively (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 1). Values of Vp,max and Kp were assumed to remain constant
between two samples for simplification. We note that these parameters mainly
depend on the availability of the RNA processing machinery, which is ubiquitously
expressed across most cells55,56, and the intrinsic properties of the pre-mRNA/
processing machinery complex. Therefore, the assumption of invariability of Vp,max
and Kp for each gene across tissues/samples is reasonable in most cases. Together
with the assumption of steady sate, this model results in a set of equations that are
solved to identify the relationship among the abundance of pre-mRNA, the
abundance of mature mRNA, and the differential rates of transcription and decay
between two samples, as shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1. We note that
solving the kinetic equations in the absence of the above simplifying assumptions
(Supplementary Fig. 4a) suggests that when the variation in Vp,max is considerably
smaller in magnitude than the variation in degradation rate, its effect is negligible
and can be ignored. The same is true for Kp when its variation is considerably
smaller than the variation in the concentration of pre-mRNA. Supplementary
Fig. 4b also shows that even when Vp,max and Kp are highly variable, the method
presented in this paper still captures the change in mRNA stability better than
uncorrected Δexon–Δintron.
Removing bias from Δexon–Δintron. We took the average of all samples within
each dataset as the reference sample sref, and then for each gene in each tissue/
sample s, we calculated gene-level Δexon and Δintron values by comparing to sref
using DESeq. Specifically, for each of the exonic and intronic read sets separately,
we used variance-stabilized transformation from DESeq57 to estimate the logarithm
of read abundances for each gene, and then subtracted the average value across the
samples to obtain Δexon and Δintron.
To filter against genes with low read counts that lead to noisy estimates of
Δexon and Δintron, we determined a minimum read cutoff θ that nearly
maximizes the correlation between Δexon and Δintron. Specifically, we determined
the value of read count cutoff that maximizes the correlation (rmax) between Δexon
and Δintron, and then selected the minimum θ that results in r ≥ 0.99 × rmax for
genes with both exonic and intronic read counts ≥ θ.
To estimate the logarithm of ratio of kd,ref and kd (corresponding to decay rates
in the reference sample sref and sample s, respectively) for this selected subset of
genes, we estimated the bias term shown in Fig. 1b for each gene separately. This
bias term depends on the RNA processing Michaelis constant Kp, and the
concentration of pre-mRNA in query sample s and reference sample sref, shown
below as [pre-mRNA] and [pre-mRNA]ref, respectively:

Here, fbias is the gene-specific bias function, and Δi represents Δintron, i.e., the

ratio of Kp and [pre-mRNA]ref. As shown in Fig. 1c, fbias can be approximated as a

 linear function of Δi over a wide range of values of the constant c. Therefore,
we estimated the function fbias for each gene by least-square linear regression of
Δexon–Δintron vs. Δintron across all tissues/samples in each dataset, assuming
that the change in mRNA decay constant across samples is independent of the bias
term, and therefore the partial regression coefficient in the model Δe–Δi = Δlog
(kd) + fbias(Δi) is equal to the regression coefficient in the model Δe–Δi ~ fbias(Δi).
The value of the bias function in each sample is then subtracted from
Δexon–Δintron to obtain an unbiased estimate of log2(kd,ref/kd), which is equal to
differential stability. These steps are implemented in a software package available at
https://github.com/csglab/REMBRANDTS. The mRNA stability estimates
presented in this paper are available at http://csg.lab.mcgill.ca/sup/pan_stability/.
Gene selection for qRT-PCR validation of stability estimates. We used RNA-
seq data from ref. 15 to measure uncorrected and bias-corrected Δexon–Δintron,
and then identified genes that were inferred to be up-regulated or downregulated in
MDA-parental or MDA-LM2 cells based on each measure (two-tailed Student’s
t-test P < 0.05). We then excluded all genes with previously reported differential
stability scores > 0.5 or < –0.5 between MDA-parental and MDA-LM2 cells17, and
among the remaining genes, identified those that had conflicting predictions from
uncorrected and bias-corrected Δexon–Δintron. We sorted these genes based on
their bias slopes, and selected the three most highly biased genes that were pre-
dicted by uncorrected Δexon–Δintron to be stabilized in MDA-LM2, as well as the
three most highly biased genes that were predicted based on uncorrected Δexon–
Δintron to be destabilized in MDA-LM2 relative to MDA-parental—all six genes
had the reverse prediction based on bias-corrected Δexon–Δintron. We then
measured the stability of these genes by α-amanitin inhibition of transcription
followed by qRT-PCR, as described below.
Sample preparation for qRT-PCR. Poorly metastatic MDA-parental
(MDA-MB-231) and highly metastatic MDA-LM2 cells16 were obtained from
Tavazoie lab (The Rockefeller University), and were tested to ensure absence
of mycoplasma contamination. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per well in six-well
plates (in biological triplicate). The following day, RNA was extracted from three
MDA-parental and three MDA-LM2 wells for the 0-h time point. The remaining
wells were treated with 10 μg/mL α-amanitin (Sigma) for 9 h before RNA
extraction.
Validation of mRNA stability estimates by qRT-PCR. RNA was isolated from
MDA-parental and MDA-LM2 cells using a total RNA isolation kit with on-
column DNase treatment (Norgen). Upon first-strand cDNA synthesis (SSIII, Life
Technologies), relative levels of each mRNA of interest were assessed by qRT-PCR
(ABI 7300 Real-Time System), using 18S as the endogenous control. Primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1. For each cell-line, relative stability
for each gene was defined as the 9-hr/0-hr ratio. Statistical significance was
determined using Mann–Whitney U-test on relative stabilities.
Analysis of RBP and miRNA binding sites. We limited the analysis of RBP and
miRNA binding sites to genes for which all isoforms had the same 3′ UTR coor-
dinates, and the 3’ UTR was composed of a single exon, in order to minimize the
possibility of confounding effects of alternative splicing. The 3′ UTR coordinates
were extracted from GENCODE v1951.
For analysis of RBP binding sites, we first collected a non-redundant
compendium of available sequence preferences for human RBPs. We obtained
175 position frequency matrices (PFMs) representing 99 human RBPs from CisBP-
RNA19, including PFMs with direct experimental evidence and those inferred by
homology. Then, we calculated all pairwise PFM similarities using MoSBAT58, and
then used affinity propagation59 to cluster the PFMs based on similarity, keeping
only the “exemplar” from each cluster. This reduced the total number of PFMs to
126, which we call the non-redundant RBP motif set. Then, we scanned the 3′ UTR
sequences with each PFM using AffiMx from the MoSBAT package58, resulting in a
vector of PFM scores that represents the affinity of the corresponding RBP for
binding to different 3′ UTRs.
For analysis of miRNAs, we obtained the seed sequences of 153 conserved
human miRNA families from TargetScan20, and searched for exact matches to each
seed sequence within 3’ UTRs. For each seed sequence, the number of matches
within each 3′ UTR was recorded, resulting in a vector of miRNA seed match
counts across the 3′ UTRs.
To identify RBPs and miRNAs that are associated with brain-specific
stability profiles, we used the unbiased gene-level stability measures as the response
variable in multiple linear regression, with RBP affinities and miRNA seed match
counts as predictor variables. We also included 3′ UTR length, nucleotide
frequencies, and dinucleotide frequencies as additional predictor variables in
regression, in order to control for the confounding effect of these variables.
RBPs and miRNAs whose binding sites were significantly associated with
brain-specific stability were identified based on t-test of regression coefficients at
FDR < 0.01.
High-confidence stability network of brain. In order to identify high-confidence
stability targets of each of the two RBPs and four miRNAs in the brain, we searched
for genes that had a 3′ UTR binding site for that factor and for which that factor
was necessary to explain the differential stability, even after taking into account all
other factors. Specifically, for each factor f, we first repeated the multiple linear
regression of the previous section after excluding f from the set of predictor
variables, and took the residual of regression as the differential stability that
remains unexplained after considering all factors except f. Then, we sorted the
genes by the ascending order of this residual value, and at each residual value x, we
calculated the distance (D) of the cumulative distribution functions for genes that
had a binding site for f (the gene set F) and genes that did not have a binding site
for f:
D x
ð Þ ¼ P X � x g 2 F

The x that maximized D was taken as the residual cutoff that marks stability

(for miRNAs) and had a binding site for f were taken as high-confidence stability
targets of f. Note that the maximum value of D is equal to the two-sample
Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic for the distributions of the residual values between
genes that have a binding site for f and genes that do not have a binding site for f.
We note that this procedure is similar to the “leading-edge” analysis described
previously for GSEA60, except that GSEA uses a weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov
statistic instead of the unweighted statistic that we used. The high-confidence
stability network of brain is available at http://csg.lab.mcgill.ca/sup/pan_stability/.
For evaluation of the high-confidence stability targets of RBFOX proteins, we
obtained potential RBFOX1/2/3 targets by identifying human orthologs of mouse
genes that have at least one Rbfox1/2/3 binding site in their 3′ UTRs based on
HITS-CLIP33. We used mouse genes that had at least one reported Rbfox1/2/3
peak with height ≥ 30, and identified their human orthologs using Ensembl54,
taking only genes with one-to-one orthology. As the background, we used human
genes whose mouse orthologs had at least one HITS-CLIP tag, in order to remove
non-expressed genes.
For validation of predicted ZFP36 stability targets, we obtained PAR-CLIP data
as well as RNA-seq measurements for ectopic expression of ZFP36 in
HEK293T cells from ref. 34. Functional ZFP36 targets were defined as genes with at
least one PAR-CLIP cluster in their 3’ UTRs that also showed ≥ 2-fold
downregulation in ZFP36-expressing cells compared to control.
For validation of miRNA targets, we obtained experimentally validated targets
of hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-29(a/b/c)-3p, and hsa-miR-9-5p
from miRTarBase35 release 6.1, which is a database of miRNA-target interactions
collected from literature. For each miRNA, we removed target genes with
ambiguous miRNA-target interactions (classified as both functional and
nonfunctional in miRTarBase). Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the
significance of enrichment of functional miRTarBase miRNA-target interactions in
our high confidence network, relative to miRNA seed sequence matches.
We also obtained the list of genes that are downregulated after ectopic
expression of miR-124 in HeLa cells from ref. 26. We used the set of genes with at
least one probe on Rosetta 25k array as the background, in order to control for
unobserved gene expression values, and calculated the enrichment of high-
confidence stability targets of miR-124 among downregulated genes using Fisher’s
exact test.
