Abstract
Background: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis
(MS). However, this physiological mechanism has multiple manifestations that range from impaired clearance of
unfolded proteins to altered mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. While connections between the triggering of the
unfolded protein response (UPR) and downstream mitochondrial dysfunction are poorly understood, the membranous
contacts between the ER and mitochondria, called the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), could provide a
functional link between these two mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated whether the guanosine triphosphatase
(GTPase) Rab32, a known regulator of the MAM, mitochondrial dynamics, and apoptosis, could be associated with ER
stress as well as mitochondrial dysfunction.
Methods: We assessed Rab32 expression in MS patient and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) tissue,
via observation of mitochondria in primary neurons and via monitoring of survival of neuronal cells upon increased
Rab32 expression.
Results: We found that the induction of Rab32 and other MAM proteins correlates with ER stress proteins in MS brain,
as well as in EAE, and occurs in multiple central nervous system (CNS) cell types. We identify Rab32, known to increase
in response to acute brain inflammation, as a novel unfolded protein response (UPR) target. High Rab32 expression
shortens neurite length, alters mitochondria morphology, and accelerates apoptosis/necroptosis of human primary
neurons and cell lines.
Conclusions: ER stress is strongly associated with Rab32 upregulation in the progression of MS, leading to
mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death.

Background
At an advanced stage of MS, immunomodulating therap-
ies are no longer effective, highlighting the need to
understand the molecular basis of this disease. Like
other neurodegenerative diseases that are associated
with mitochondrial impairment [1], MS mitochondria
can be dysfunctional, especially during disease progres-
sion [1] and its neurodegenerative phase [2, 3]. For in-
stance, mitochondria no longer respire normally in
progressive MS patients [4]. Dysfunctional mitochondria
produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a conse-
quence, mitochondrial ROS promote inflammation and
shift mitochondrial dynamics towards fission [5]. This
latter process requires dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1),
a ubiquitous guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) [6].
While Drp1 is essential for post-mitotic neurons [7], its
excessive activity can result in apoptosis [8]. Indeed,
mitochondria increase in number in MS neurons under-
going demyelination [9], thus accelerating axonal degen-
eration [10]. Upstream causes of these mitochondrial
defects are largely unknown. One potential mechanism
involves the uncontrolled release of Ca2+ ions from the
main cellular Ca2+ store, the endoplasmic reticulum

 (ER), within the diseased neurons. This intracellular
signaling mechanism ultimately promotes cell death
via a mitochondrial mechanism [11, 12]. Lethal ER-
mitochondria Ca2+ transfer is observed for instance
following axotomy [13] or spinal cord injury [14].
In addition to disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, the
induction of ER stress is another hallmark of MS [15, 16].
This process not only promotes ER-mitochondria crosstalk
in general by increasing the apposition of the ER and mito-
chondria at the so-called mitochondria-associated mem-
brane (MAM) [17–19], but could also promote neuronal
death, thus contributing to the MS pathology [20].
A prominent MAM regulatory protein is Rab32. This
GTPase localizes to the ER and mitochondria [21, 22],
where it regulates ER-mitochondria interactions and
mitochondrial dynamics [23]. Rab32 is induced upon
brain inflammation in a mouse model [24]. Consistent
with an important role in neuroinflammation, our data
indicate that ER stress induces Rab32 and occurs in the
MS brain. These findings increase our understanding of
Rab32 role in impairment of neuronal mitochondrial
dynamics and cell survival.

Isolation and maintenance of primary neuronal cultures
Cultures of human fetal neurons (HFN) were generated
from 15–19-week fetal brains (obtained with consent
from the University of Alberta Ethics Committee) as
described [26].
Human frozen brain tissues and EAE mice tissue
For immunohistochemistry, snap-frozen blocks of post-
mortem normal control (NC) or MS cerebral sub-
ventricular deep white matter samples were obtained
from the NeuroResource Tissue Bank, UCL Institute of
Neurology, London, and UK MS Biobank, with next-of-
kin informed consent for tissue donation and ethical
approval from Central London REC1 (I.D.08/H0718/62)
and approval for the study from the Local Research
Ethics Committee (I.D.04/Q2102/111), UK MS brain
bank charity number 1139257. A total of 12 MS pa-
tients (9 females, 3 males) who had been affected from
secondary progressive (10), primary progressive (1) or
relapsing progressive MS were used for this part of the
study. Control tissue from individuals who had not
been affected by disease (7) and 2 individuals who had
been affected by Parkinson’s disease was also examined.
Control patients died of non-inflammatory diseases
(cardiac failure, lung cancer, bladder cancer, prostate
cancer, tongue cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome; for
two control cases, the cause of death was not known).
Further information is contained in Additional file 1.
For Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis,
tissues of two frozen MS brains (patient 1: secondary
progressive MS, aged 54, male; patient 2: relapsing-
remitting MS, aged 45, male) were obtained from the MS
Tissue Bank at the University of Alberta. Post-mortem
brain tissues were collected and processed as described
[27]. Frozen brain and spinal cord tissues of triplicate
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice,
an animal model of MS, were generated with proper ap-
provals as described [28]. Control samples showed no
signs of nervous disease. Disease peak samples were from
clinical grade 1, whereas post-peak samples were from
clinical grade 4 (hind limb paralysis at time of dissection).
Lysate preparation and analysis from tissues and cell lines
Tissue lysates were prepared from the human frozen brain
as well as from the spinal cords of EAE mice in 1× sodium
dodecyl sulphate (SDS) extraction buffer (0.125 M Tris-
HCK pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-ME), followed
by sonication on a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scien-
tific, Ottawa, ON). Supernatants were collected, and pro-
tein
concentrations
were
measured
by
NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer ND1000 (Thermo/Life Technologies)
at an absorbance of 280 nm. Cellular lysates from SH-
SY5Y cells were prepared as described [25].
RT-PCR
SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in mild hypoxia (4% O2,
grown in the presence of 4% O2, 5% CO2 balanced N2,
as is typical for brain tissue) in the presence of thapsi-
gargin. After 24 h in culture, total RNA was extracted.
The primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: Rab32
forward
AGCAGGACTCTGGTGCGCCTG
(position
211-231); Rab32 reverse CGGGCAGCTTCCTCTATG
TTTATGTTATC (position 557-529). The result was
normalized against the ribosomal 18S.

 Immunohistochemistry
Sample sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) and luxol fast blue (LFB) as described [27].
Lesions were classified into acute (referring to tissue
phenotype, see below), sub-acute, and chronic on the
basis of the number and distribution of oil red-O-positive
macrophages, the extent of demyelination, cellularity in
the borders and parenchyma of lesions, and perivascular
cuffing as described in our previous work [29]. Briefly,
acute lesions were identified via demyelination, invading
macrophages, hypercellularity at the lesion border, and
cuffing around the blood vessels. Sub-acute lesions
showed a demyelinated plaque with fewer macrophages,
mostly at the lesion border, and less perivascular cuffing.
A chronic lesion consisted of a hypocellular demyelinated
plaque completely lacking of oil red-O-stained macro-
phages. Examination of MS brain tissue for Rab32 expres-
sion in specific cell types was performed employing
enzyme immunohistochemistry using a Vectastain ABC
system® (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK), as
described [30].

psi-mH1
plasmids
(HSH001118) as well as scrambled control (CSHCTR001)

FLAG-tagged Rab32 constructs were expressed from
pcDNA3
as
published
[22]
(wt,
wild
type;
Q85L,
dominant-active; T39N, dominant-negative) or transferred
into the bi-cistronic pIRES2-EGFP plasmid (Clontech-
Takara, Mountain View, CA) that allows for the expres-
sion of any protein, in parallel with nuclear EGFP. To do
so, the described constructs contained in pcDNA3 were
PCR-amplified using the SP6 and TS484 (ATATGCTAGC
ACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG) oligos
following cuts with the 5’ Nhe1 and 3’ Xho1 sites. Primary
neurons or SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines were transfected
by nucleofection (Lonza, Mississauga, ON). Immuno-
fluorescence was performed as described [25]. To assay
neurotoxicity, nuclear EGFP was used to identify trans-
fected HFNs and SH-SY5Y. Apoptosis was then de-
tected by Cy5-annexin V binding (BD Biosciences).
Assays were repeated in the presence of bafilomycin
(100 nM, Sigma-Aldrich), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1, 50 μM,
Cayman Chemical), carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-
[O-methyl]- fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) (10 μM,
Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), or with a com-
bination of nec-1 and zVAD-fmk.
Immunogold labeling
Cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 3% paraformalde-
hyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde (GA) containing 2%
sucrose. Next, free aldehyde groups were quenched with
ammonium chloride (50 mM), and samples were perme-
abilized with saponin (0.1%). The samples were blocked
(PBS + 1% BSA + 0.05% FSG + Saponin 0.05%) for an
hour and then were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG in
the blocking buffer overnight in a wet chamber. Follow-
ing washes (0.2%BSA + 0.05%FSG + 0.05% saponin), the
samples were incubated with the secondary antibody
(Fluoronanogold Anti-mouse Fab’Alexa Fluor 488, cat.
7202; Nanoprobes, NY) for 3 h at RT and washed with
PBS three times. The samples then were fixed (2% GA
in PBS + 2% sucrose) for an hour, followed by three
rinses in water. Following a 1-min incubation with Gold-
Enhance EM Plus (Cat. 2114; Nanoprobes, NY), the
samples were rinsed in water, scraped in 100 mM so-
dium cacodylate and pelleted. The pellet was incubated
for 1 h with osmium tetroxide (1%), followed by over-
night staining with uranyl acetate. After dehydration in
increasing concentrations of ethanol and then propylene
oxide treatments, the pellets were transferred to resin
(Embed 812 kit, cat. 14120; Electron Microscopy Sci-
ences, Hatfield, PA) and incubated at 60 °C for 48 h.

Results
Rab32 parallels ER stress within MS patient and EAE
brains
Rab32 is enriched on the ER and mitochondria [31],
where it determines various aspects of ER-mitochondria
crosstalk [21, 23]. The recent discovery that Rab32
expression increases during brain inflammation in mice
[24]
and
the
connection
between
ER-mitochondria
crosstalk and inflammation [32, 33] led us to hypothesize
that Rab32 might play a role in the MS pathology. Thus,
we examined autopsy tissue sections from the MS patient
brains (Fig. 1a–c) for Rab32 expression. These results
demonstrated that Rab32 was increased in lesions of MS
brain tissues (Fig. 1d). Importantly, Rab32 was higher in
active lesions where infiltrating macrophages and resident
microglia were present. Consistent with the reported low
expression of Rab32 in brain tissue [34, 35], very low levels
of Rab32 were noticed in the normal-appearing white
matter (NAWM, Fig. 1d). We next tested whether this in-
crease in Rab32 paralleled an increase of proteins func-
tionally connected to Rab32, including ER chaperones and
proteins regulating ER-mitochondria interactions.
Consistent with the previous identification of ER stress
as a hallmark of the MS CNS [16, 36], we detected in-
creased expression of calnexin, BiP/GRP78, GRP94, and
the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homolo-
gous protein (CHOP) in active, but not chronic lesions

 (Fig. 1d). Next, we tested whether other MAM regula-
tory proteins were upregulated as well. We probed for
the
tether
proteins
GRP75
and
Mfn2
the
MAM-
associated mitochondria fission GTPase Drp1 and the
MAM enrichment factor phosphofurin acidic cluster
sorting protein 2 (PACS-2). Western blotting showed
that all of the above proteins showed increased expres-
sion in active, but not chronic MS brain lesions (Fig. 1e).
We extended our investigation into the animal model of
MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Western blotting showed that high levels of brain-
localized Rab32 occurred in the peak and post-peak
period of EAE (Fig. 1f), reflecting the induction of
Rab32 in both active and chronic lesions of MS brain.
Cell-type specific localization of Rab32 expression
We next examined which cell types harbor increased
amounts of Rab32 in MS brain tissue and also expanded

 the number of patients in our study. To do so, we first
stained for axonal and non-phosphorylated neurofila-
ment that identifies cells as neurons, as well as for
Rab32 and CHOP. Control brain tissue did not show
significant Rab32 staining (Additional file 2). In contrast,
our results shown in Fig. 2a–c demonstrate that high
Rab32 expression was especially encountered at the
border of active lesions of MS brains. Chronic lesions
showed less expression of Rab32. In the merged images,
the signals of Rab32 and neurofilament were only
partially overlapping but were most pronounced in
swollen axons at the active lesion border (arrows in
Fig. 2a–c). Infiltrating immune cells (visible from their
DAPI staining) surrounded these cells. We detected high
amounts of CHOP in virtually the same set of cells that
also over-expressed Rab32. Next, we evaluated to what
extent microglial cells in MS brain expressed Rab32,
using independent tissue samples, part of a 12-patient
cohort (Figs. 2g–l and 3, Additional file 1). This showed
that distinct staining for Rab32 was found within
microglial cells in active lesions characterized by heavy
myelin debris (stained black with DAB nickel chloride,
Fig. 2g–i). Next, we discovered via double immunohis-
tochemistry that in MS NAWM, Rab32 (brown) was lo-
calized to cells with the morphology of microglia and
blood vessels, but not axons (blue/gray) (Fig. 3a, b). In
contrast, in acute MS lesions (referring to tissue,
Fig. 3c), we detected Rab32-positive microglia in the
acute lesion border and adjacent NAWM (Fig. 3d–i).
Interestingly, within the lesion area (Fig. 3h, f), we de-
tected not only a mix of both Rab32 (brown)-positive
cells and Rab32-negative macrophages (blue/gray) but
also some Rab32-positive macrophages (black). Here,
we also detected extensive overlap between staining
for Rab32 (brown) and axons (blue/gray) (Fig. 3f–i).
Together, using multiple patient tissue samples, our
findings indicate that Rab32 increases dramatically in
neurons and macrophages/microglia localized within
active MS lesions and that high amounts of Rab32 co-
incide with the expression of CHOP. In contrast,
chronic MS lesions show Rab32 predominantly in
neurons.
Rab32 expression is under the control of the unfolded
protein response (UPR)
Next, we aimed to understand what cell biological mech-
anism could give rise to high levels of this small GTPase.
To investigate this question, we used in vitro ap-
proaches. First, we performed RT-PCR on the mRNA
from SH-SY5Y cells incubated with and without 0.5 μM
thapsigargin. This showed that the Rab32 mRNA in-
creased by 2.6-fold upon ER stress (Fig. 4a). To corrob-
orate this result at a protein level, we treated SH-SY5Y
cells with tunicamycin in a 0–4-h time course under
normoxic conditions or in presence of 4% oxygen.
Western blotting revealed that 4% O2, as is typical for
brain tissue, increased expression of Rab32, but tunica-
mycin accentuated this increase Rab32 at 2 and 4 h
(Fig. 4b). In parallel, we also assessed the expression of
selected ER stress-related proteins, calnexin and CHOP.
Both the amounts of calnexin and CHOP were only
responsive to tunicamycin treatment. Therefore, Rab32
expression appears to be tied to the induction of ER stress
and to a lesser degree hypoxia, as described previously for
other proteins [37].
Rab32 interferes with neuronal mitochondrial dynamics
and growth
To understand the functional readout of increased neur-
onal Rab32 transcription, we investigated whether Rab32
alters neuronal mitochondrial dynamics, as shown by
others and us [21, 23]. Thus, we decided to express
Rab32
constructs
and
interfering
ribonucleic
acid
(RNAi) from bi-cistronic plasmids co-expressing nuclear
EGFP. As a cellular model, we used primary human fetal
neurons (HFNs) as well as SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cells. Using the primary cells, we investigated neurite
outgrowth of transfected neurons or control cells, as
well
as
their
mitochondria
distribution
following
mitotracker-labeling. In contrast to control conditions
(Fig.
5a),
neurons
transfected
with
dominant-active
Rab32Q85L showed bulkier, less interconnected mito-
chondria units (Fig. 5b, see enlarged areas in Fig. 5a, b).
Quantification revealed that transfection of neurons with
Rab32WT and Rab32Q85L, but not dominant-negative
Rab32T39N, indeed increased the numbers of mitochon-
dria per length of neurite by 13 and 26%, respectively
(Fig. 5c). However, this alteration of mitochondrial dy-
namics coincided with 12 and 22% shorter neurites in
neurons expressing wild-type Rab32 and Rab32Q85L, re-
spectively (Fig. 5d). Interestingly, knockdown of Rab32
did not have any effects for mitochondrial dynamics or
neurite outgrowth, when normalized to scrambled con-
trol transfected cells (Fig. 5c, d). To investigate which ef-
fects on mitochondrial morphology resulted in the
altered mitochondria density and neurite length, we
transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells with dominant-
active FLAG-tagged Rab32Q85L, which showed the
most significant changes. We then analyzed these cells
via immunogold labeling of their FLAG signal to distin-
guish between transfected, over-expressing cells (top)
and untransfected, control cells (bottom, Fig. 5e). This
showed that Rab32Q85L promoted the formation of lar-
ger mitochondria with fewer cristae, concomitant with a
38% reduction in their cristae density per area (table,
Fig. 5e). Our results imply that Rab32 alters mitochon-
drial dynamics in neurons and affects neurite outgrowth.

 Long-term effect of Rab32 and its mutants on neuronal
survival
Next, we focused on the role of Rab32 to control apop-
tosis onset [21] and investigated whether altered expres-
sion or activity of Rab32 would influence the survival of
neurons. We assayed cell viability at 24, 48, and 72 h
post-transfection and set the viability of control EGFP-
expressing cells as 100%. At 24 h, we were unable to de-
tect differences in the survival of cells with altered
Rab32 expression levels or activity compared to control
cells. However, the amounts of cells over-expressing any
version of Rab32 started to decrease at 48 h after
transfection (Fig. 6a). This trend accelerated at 72 h.
In contrast, neurons expressing Rab32 RNAi as well

 as EGFP-only-expressing control cells did not show
significant reductions in their viability (Fig. 6b). We
repeated this survival assay using human SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells and found these cells to be even
more dependent on Rab32 (Fig. 5c), regardless of
whether it was active or inactive.
Caspase inhibition and necrostatin can block Rab32-directed
neuronal death
We next aimed to investigate the mechanism(s) trig-
gered by Rab32 that led to neuronal damage and death.
To do so, we transfected SH-SY5Y cells and determined
whether
they
subsequently
underwent
apoptosis.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, we were unable to
detect annexin V on the surface of control cells (Fig. 7a,
first column), but cells transfected with Rab32WT,
Rab32Q85L, and Rab32T39N (identified via bi-cistronically
expressed EGFP) readily showed annexin V binding (Fig. 7a,
as labeled; scale bar 20 μm). In addition to apoptosis, we
also investigated whether the increased expression of
Rab32 might induce necroptosis. First, we investigated
whether Rab32 expression and activity levels could influ-
ence the amounts of receptor-interacting protein kinase
(RIPK). Thus, we lysed the SH-SY5Y cells transfected with
Rab32WT, Rab32Q85L, Rab32T39N, and shRab32 as well
as EGFP-expressing controls. Western blot analysis showed
that increased Rab32 expression led to increased amounts
of RIPK1 (Fig. 7b). No difference could be detected upon
Rab32 knockdown.
To determine the relative contribution of apoptosis
and necroptosis to neuronal cell death upon Rab32
over-expression, we re-examined the survival of SH-
SY5Y cells transfected with EGFP, shRab32, Rab32WT,
and Rab32Q85L. We then repeated our survival assay
in the presence of necrostatin-1 and zVAD-fmk and,
as an additional control, bafilomycin that inhibits au-
tophagy. Quantification of the surviving cells showed
that the role or Rab32 in autophagy was not respon-
sible for our observations. In contrast, necrostatin-1
and
zVAD-fmk
significantly
inhibited
the
Rab32-
induced neuronal damage and death, further increased
upon combination of both inhibitors (Fig. 7c). Our
results therefore indicate that Rab32 induces neuronal
damage and death from a combination of apoptosis
and necroptosis.
Discussion
In our study, we report that Rab32 serves as a novel
marker of neurodegeneration in MS lesions, consistent
with its previously detected induction in response to pro-
inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [24]. Interestingly,
we found that Rab32 correlated with the inflammatory sta-
tus of the tissues. In contrast to healthy tissue, which
showed low levels of Rab32 as reported previously [34, 35],
Rab32 was highly expressed in active lesions of both hu-
man MS patients and EAE mice; while not as high, expres-
sion of Rab32 was still elevated in chronic lesions. In terms
of cell types, we have detected high amounts of Rab32 in
neurons and microglial/macrophage cells.
Our investigation into a transcriptional regulation of
Rab32 expression showed that this gene responds to ER
stress. Since ER stress is well known to trigger inflam-
mation and mitochondrial dysfunction, our observation
that ER stress leads to Rab32 induction and subse-
quently alters mitochondrial dynamic as well as neuronal
apoptosis induction identifies Rab32 as a protein of
critical interest to MS research. Results presented in
this study demonstrate that an increase of Rab32 in the
inflamed brain directly promotes neuronal cell death
from a combination of apoptosis and necroptosis.
Interestingly, the putative role of Rab32 as an autophagy
promoter [38] is not tied to this pro-death function of
Rab32. While wild-type and active Rab32Q85L showed
effects on mitochondrial morphology and neurite out-
growth, inactive Rab32T39N also compromised the
survival of primary neurons as well as SH-SY5Y cells
(Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting the mere upregulation of
Rab32 is detrimental to neuronal function, potentially

 due to shared functions of active and inactive Rab32.
Moreover, our results reinforce the role of ER stress
as an upstream trigger of inflammation, which is one
of the main pathology drivers in the MS context.
Interestingly, the inhibition of the UPR can improve
myelination of some disease models [39] and also
plays a critical role in the most promising approaches
to treat neurodegeneration [40].
Rab32 is induced in parallel with known mediators or
regulators
of
the
MAM,
namely,
Grp75,
PACS-2,
Mitofusin 2, and Drp1 (Fig. 1). In contrast to Rab32,
however, these MAM modulatory proteins were only

 induced in active, but not in chronic lesions. Nevertheless,
this suggests that MAM functions, including the exchange
of Ca2+ between the two organelles and mitochondrial dy-
namics, actively control neuronal decay within active MS
lesions but reach a new equilibrium in chronic lesions.
Conclusions
Taken together, our results identify Rab32 as a new
marker for active and chronic inflammatory lesions of
the CNS in MS whose ER stress-triggered transcription
leads to altered mitochondrial dynamics and neuronal
cell death. Future research will have to investigate
whether the inhibition of Rab32 production in the in-
flamed CNS could inhibit neurodegeneration in vivo.
