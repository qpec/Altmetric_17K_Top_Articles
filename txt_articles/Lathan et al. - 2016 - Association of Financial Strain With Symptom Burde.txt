Purpose
To measure the association between patient financial strain and symptom burden and quality of life
(QOL) for patients with new diagnoses of lung or colorectal cancer.
Patients and Methods
Patients participating in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study were inter-
viewed about their financial reserves, QOL, and symptom burden at 4 months of diagnosis and, for
survivors, at 12 months of diagnosis. We assessed the association of patient-reported financial
reserves with patient-reported outcomes including the Brief Pain Inventory, symptom burden on the
basis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Ques-
tionnaire C30, and QOL on the basis of the EuroQoL-5 Dimension scale. Multivariable linear
regression models were fit for each outcome and cancer type, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex,
income, insurance, stage at diagnosis, and comorbidity.
Results
Among patients with lung and colorectal cancer, 40% and 33%, respectively, reported limited
financial reserves (# 2 months). Relative to patients with more than 12 months of financial reserves,
those with limited financial reserves reported significantly increased pain (adjusted mean difference,
5.03 [95% CI, 3.29 to 7.22] and 3.45 [95% CI, 1.25 to 5.66], respectively, for lung and colorectal),
greater symptom burden (5.25 [95% CI, 3.29 to .22] and 5.31 [95% CI, 3.58 to 7.04]), and poorer
QOL (4.70 [95% CI, 2.82 to 6.58] and 5.22 [95% CI, 3.61 to 6.82]). With decreasing financial
reserves, a clear dose-response relationship was present across all measures of well-being. These
associations were also manifest for survivors reporting outcomes again at 1 year and persisted after
adjustment for stage, comorbidity, insurance, and other clinical attributes.
Conclusion
Patients with cancer and limited financial reserves are more likely to have higher symptom burden and
decreased QOL. Assessment of financial reserves may help identify patients who need intensive support.

INTRODUCTION
The financial reserves required to manage a cancer
diagnosis are substantial.1 From diagnosis through
survivorship to end-of-life care, the direct and
indirect costs of cancer care can cause signifi-
cant hardship for families without the financial
resources to buffer the additional expenses.2,3 The
influence of financial strain on the clinical outcomes
and experiences of care in patients with cancer is an
ongoing area of interest in health services research.4-9
Recent research suggests that families are not
prepared to manage the expenses associated with
cancer care10 and many continue to experience
financial hardship during survivorship.11 Not
surprisingly, these studies have demonstrated that
financial hardship is positively associated with
medication nonadherence and delaying medical
care.12 Multiple studies demonstrate that patients
living in regions with high levels of poverty delay
medical care.13-20 However, most of these stud-
ies have relied on ecologic measures of socioeco-
nomic status that are based on the attributes of the
region of residence and thus may not reliably
reflect individuals’ experiences.
A much smaller body of work has measured
individual socioeconomic attributes, such as

 household income, and demonstrates a consistent association
between financial hardship and inferior survival for patients with
cancer.6,18,21,22 Personal and household income are also imperfect
measures of financial hardship because they may not reflect assets,
responsibilities, and debt. In contrast to income, the construct of
financial strain is a subjective measure characterizing how an
individual perceives his or her overall economic resources relative
to obligations and needs. Observations from financial surveys
indicate that approximately 34% of American adults lack enough
emergency savings to cover living expenses for 90 days.23
Although it is clear that patients face financial strain as a result
of a cancer diagnosis, and that such strain may influence treatment
choices and adherence, there is limited understanding of how
financial strain influences outcomes such as symptom burden and
quality of life (QOL).24,25
To understand how individuals’ financial strain is associated
with patient-reported health outcomes, we used data from the
Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS)
Consortium, a large prospective population- and health system–
based cohort composed of patients with recently diagnosed lung
and colorectal cancer.26 We hypothesized that patients with
financial strain would experience greater symptom burden and
potentially inferior outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The CanCORS study enrolled more than 10,000 patients with incident
lung or colorectal cancer who had received the diagnosis between 2003 and
2005. Patients were enrolled from five geographic regions (Northern

Cancer Outcomes and Financial Strain
 California, Los Angeles County, North Carolina, Iowa, and Alabama),
five participating health maintenance organizations, and 15 sites within
the Veteran’s Health Administration system.27,28 Each site identified
incident cancer cases using a comprehensive, rapid case ascertainment
protocol. The five regional participating sites used population-based
cancer registries to identify eligible subjects, and the health main-
tenance organization and Veteran’s Health Administration sites
identified eligible subjects from organizational cancer registries. The
study was approved by the human subjects committees at all partic-
ipating institutions.
Patients, or surrogates of patients who were deceased or too ill to
participate, were interviewed approximately 4 months after diagnosis. Four
versions of the baseline interview were available: a full patient interview; a
brief patient interview for patients unable to complete the full interview; a
surrogate interview for surrogates of deceased patients; and a surrogate
interview for living patients too ill to complete the interview themselves. A
follow-up patient or surrogate interview was performed approximately
12 months after diagnosis if the patient was alive at the time of the baseline
interview. In accordance with the standards of the American Association of
Public Opinion Research, where the denominator included both unsuc-
cessful contacts and refusal/nonresponse, the response rate was 51.0%; the
cooperation rate, assessing participation among patients contacted, was
59.9%28,29 For participants who gave consent, medical records from
hospitals, radiation treatment facilities, and offices of medical oncologists,
surgeons, gastroenterologists, pulmonologists, and primary care physi-
cians were abstracted for the time period beginning 3 months before
diagnosis until death or at least 15 months after diagnosis. The CanCORS
study protocol and data collection have been described previously.29
The primary explanatory variable of interest was patient-reported
financial reserves.30-33 In the full interviews of patients and of surrogates of
living patients, patients or their surrogates were asked, “If you lost all of
your current sources of income (for example, your paycheck, Social
Security or pension, public assistance) and had to live off of your savings,
how long could you continue to live at your current address and standard
of living?” Response options were less than 1 month, 1-2 months,
3-6 months, 7-12 months, more than 1 year, and don’t know. This question
was not included in the brief patient interview or surrogate interview for
deceased patients, so these subjects were excluded from the cohort. Overall,
18% of patients with lung cancer and 19% of patients with colorectal
cancer responded, “don’t know” or did not answer the question about
financial reserves; these individuals were also excluded from the primary
analytic cohort. In general, patients with nonresponse to the question
about financial reserves were older, were more likely to be Hispanic or
Asian, and had lower income and education. Those who did not respond to
the questions on income or education were also less likely to respond to the
question on financial reserves (data not shown). Details of the cohort
assembly are displayed in Figure 1.
The primary study outcome was patient-reported QOL across
domains of physical and mental health. Overall QOL was measured using
the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) physical and mental health
scales.34 Patients also completed the five-item EuroQol-5 Dimension scale
(EQ-5D), which provides a global measure of health-related QOL.35 Other
measures were used to capture domains especially salient for patients with
cancer. Pain was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory,36 symptom
burden was measured using the European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 symptom
inventory,37 and for patients with lung cancer, a measure of dyspnea was
used.38 All these measures were patient reported at the time of the baseline
interview, were phrased to address the patient’s current health state, and
were standardized to 100-point scales in which higher values represent
worse outcomes. The QOL outcomes analyses were restricted to patients
who completed the full patient interview, because these measures were
truly patient reported (as opposed to being surrogate reports of the
patient’s outcomes). The subset of patients who completed a follow-up
interview (56% for lung, 71% for colorectal; Fig 1) reported on these same
QOL domains again at approximately 12 months.

 Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis was used to
calculate unadjusted and adjusted differences in mean QOL measures at
baseline by financial reserves category, with 95% CIs. Adjusted results
controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, insurance, cancer
stage at diagnosis, and comorbidity at diagnosis. Comorbidity was
ascertained from the medical record abstraction, using the Adult
Comorbidity Evaluation 27, a validated medical record–based system that
assigns each patient a comorbidity score on the basis of severity noted

Cancer Outcomes and Financial Strain
 across multiple body systems39 and reflects comorbidities present from
3 months before diagnosis through initial treatment; patients who did
not consent to a medical record abstraction were grouped in a separate
category (ie, unknown comorbidity) in the models.
Univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was
performed for the individual QOL items obtained at the follow-up survey.
Regression analyses were performed on multiply imputed data sets to
adjust for survey nonresponse40; however, imputed values were not used
for the financial reserves variable, because this was the main predictor of
interest.
To examine the potential for colinearity, the relationship between
financial reserves and household income was summarized descriptively
using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, stratified by race/ethnicity.
The strength of the association between these three measures (financial
reserves, household income, and race/ethnicity) and the QOL measures
was quantified using the R2 value from univariable linear regression.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and Stata version 13.1 (STATA, College Station, TX), with
CanCORS core data (version 1.18) and baseline and follow-up interview
data (version 1.12).
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the distribution of patient financial strain as well as
other sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Among
patients with lung and colorectal cancer, 40% and 33%, respec-
tively, had limited financial reserves (, 2 months). When com-
pared with patients with colorectal cancer, a higher percentage of
patients with lung cancer had a household income less than
$20,000 (34% v 29%), and fewer had completed a college degree
(18% v 28%). The lung cancer cohort also had a higher percentage
of stage IV patients. The colorectal cancer cohort had a higher
percentage of patients younger than age 60 years (38% v 27%).
Patients reporting low financial reserves were more likely to be
insured by Medicaid or to have no insurance than were patients
reporting reserves of more than 2 months. Among patients with
lung cancer reporting low financial reserves, 19% had Medicaid,
10% had no insurance, and 71% had insurance other than
Medicaid. In contrast, among patients with financial reserves of
more than 2 months, 6% had Medicaid, 2% no insurance, and 91%
non-Medicaid insurance. The pattern was similar for patients with
colorectal cancer (Appendix Table A1, online only).
Financial Strain and QOL/Symptom Burden at 4 Months
From Diagnosis
We found a strong, consistent association between greater
financial strain and inferior QOL. This association was evident for
physical and mental well-being as well as for each of the five QOL
metrics examined. Figure 2 presents the association between
financial strain and each of the QOL outcomes without adjust-
ment for other patient attributes. These results demonstrate a
remarkably consistent pattern associating low financial reserves
with decreased well-being (all P , .001). Baseline QOL values
reported by CanCORS corresponded to cancer-related QOL values
reported in the literature.41-44
Appendix Table A2 (online only) details the relationship
between financial strain and individual income stratified by race/
ethnicity. It reveals that these two constructs are only modestly
correlated (Spearman correlation ranging from 0.29 to 0.42 across
all categories of race/ethnicity). For example, among white patients
reporting household income below $20,000, 29% had financial
reserves exceeding 1 year. In contrast, 14% of those with income
above $60,000 reported financial strain on the basis of reserves of

 2 months or less. This pattern was similar for other racial/ethnic
groups.
The association between greater financial strain and inferior
QOLwas as strong, or stronger, than the association between either
household income or race/ethnicity and these outcomes, with few
exceptions. For example, for lung cancer, the variable financial
reserves were more consistently associated with unadjusted pre-
dictor of SF-12 scores, EQ-5D, pain, and the European Organi-
sation for Research and Treatment of Cancer symptom index than
was household income. This pattern held true for colorectal cancer
except that household income was more closely associated with low
scores on the SF-12 physical function scale. Table 2 lists these
associations for each QOL/symptom burden scale, as quantified by
R2 values and the F statistic.
Figure 3 presents the unadjusted (A1 and B1) and ad-
justed (A2 and B2) differences in means for the dependent
variables of interest according to the degree of patient-reported
financial strain. For both patients with lung cancer and those
with colorectal cancer, patients who had less than 2 months
of financial reserve had significantly lower mean scores for
all outcome measures compared with those with more than a
year of financial reserve. Moreover, results demonstrate a clear
dose-response relationship between financial strain and both
lower QOL and greater symptom burden. These associations
persisted after adjusting for other sociodemographic variables
including household income, educational attainment, race/
ethnicity, age, sex, stage at diagnosis, and comorbidity at
diagnosis.
Financial Strain and Outcomes Approximately 1 Year
From Diagnosis
Approximately 1 year after the baseline interview, a subset
of patients and surrogates completed an abbreviated follow-up
interview (Fig 1). Both patients with lung cancer and those with
colorectal cancer who reported greater financial strain at diag-
nosis tended to have worse overall health, impairment in activity
level, more pain, and more depression than did those with greater
financial reserve. Multivariable analyses revealed that financial
strain was also an independent predictor of impairment in the
well-being of patients with cancer at follow-up interviews (Fig 4).
Specifically, pain and depression were statically significant
across both cancer types. Measures evaluating general health
and physical activity followed the same pattern but were not

Cancer Outcomes and Financial Strain
 significant predictors across both cancer types. In a sensitivity
analysis, we examined the relationship between financial strain
and the magnitude of change in patient-reported outcomes
between the 4-month and 12-month interviews and found no
consistent association (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We found that financial strain at the time of diagnosis has a
consistent independent association with the well-being of patients
with cancer. Not surprisingly, patients who reported the greatest
amount of financial strain were poorer, and a higher percentage
were black or and Hispanic. Our analysis indicates an association
between high levels of financial strain and increased symptom
burden as well as a poorer QOL at the time of diagnosis.
We found that this relationship persisted even after adjusting
for race/ethnicity, median household income, insurance status,
stage at diagnosis, comorbidity, and other patient-level charac-
teristics. Although related to other demographic attributes,
financial strain had an independent association with both symp-
tom burden and QOL Indeed, the impact was similar in magnitude
to well-recognized associations between household income and
race/ethnicity and these outcomes. Moreover, financial strain
remained associated with changes in QOL and symptom burden
values at follow-up interviews conducted 12 months after diagnosis.
The association between low financial reserves and high
symptom burden/poor QOL was present in subgroup analyses that
considered stage at diagnosis, the receipt of chemotherapy as a
component of the initial treatment course, and comorbidity level
(data not shown). The fact that self-reported low financial reserves
coincided with higher symptom burden and worse QOL across
these subgroups suggests that the association we describe is not
simply confounded by baseline health status, disease severity, or
treatment choice. The differences in EQ-5D and SF-12 according to
degree of financial strain are clinically meaningful, although there
is less information about the magnitude of meaningful differences
for the Brief Pain Inventory and dyspnea metrics.42,45 Finally, given
the representativeness of the CANCORS population and the fact
that the QOL scores in our study are in line with the published
accounts in the literature, our results should be generalizable to
routine practice.41-44,46-48
More than 80% of patients were both willing and able to
answer the single-item question about financial strain. This sug-
gests the usefulness of this variable for possible use in routine
clinical settings. Asking about financial reserves may be perceived
as less intrusive than asking about household income and may also
be a cognitively easier task. The independent association of this

 measure of financial stability with important patient-centered
cancer outcomes suggests consideration for its inclusion with
the common demographic information that patients are often
asked to provide in health system interactions. Moreover, this
metric should be prioritized in electronic medical records that
allow for patient interaction.
The role of financial strain and its effects on health and health
behaviors has been evaluated previously by Hudson et al,49 who
examined the impact of race and socioeconomic position on self-
rated health and depression and found that both racial discrim-
ination and lower socioeconomic position over the life course were
related to increased depressive symptoms and poorer self-reported
health status. The increased pain and dyspnea we observed could
be caused by worsening disease burden, even within stage, a lack
of ability to access high-quality supportive care, or difficulty in
obtaining the appropriate medications. Earlier work by Savoy
et al50 has shown that financial strain alone can contribute to poor
health and depressive symptoms, as well as increased cancer risk
behaviors.
Our study is limited primarily by its observational nature,
which precludes causal inference and a precise understanding of
the mechanisms that account for these consistent associations.
Ostensibly, financial strain could result in inferior QOL and
increased symptom burden because of the inability to access
needed care, poor social supports, or increased stress. Alternatively,
the causal association may occur in the reverse direction; inferior
outcomes and higher symptom burden may accelerate depletion of
financial reserves and adversely affect work capacity. The rela-
tionship between financial strain and our outcomes of interest may
indeed be bidirectional. However, from a health care delivery
system perspective, the association is important irrespective of the
directionality because it signals a vulnerable group of patients not
easily identified through other metrics. Lastly, we used a validated
single-item measure to assess financial reserves, but clearly, the
construct of financial reserves is multidimensional. The single
item we chose has been validated across multiple studies and
diverse populations and is widely accepted in the public health
arena.30,51,52
Using a range of well-validated metrics that characterize well-
being in patients with cancer, we found that those with decreased
financial reserves demonstrated an association between lower QOL
scores and increased symptom burden scores. This effect manifests
early in the course of the disease and continues over time. The
strength of the association persists after adjustment for demo-
graphic variables and disease stage. Identifying which patients may
be most in need of financial assistance could have a positive effect
on patient outcomes and could allow for precision triaging of
limited resources. Social workers are commonly called on for
patient emotional support but, in many cases, are also able to help
with identification of community resources for vulnerable patients.
Often, this assistance is only given once there is an incident or
problem that brings this to the attention of the clinician. The
evaluation of financial strain could be performed by social workers,
nurses, or physicians themselves, depending on the structure of the
clinic.53
Our results support future research that should evaluate
whether prospectively identifying patients experiencing finan-
cial strain and providing supportive interventions for these
individuals is an effective strategy to improve outcomes and
decrease suffering.
