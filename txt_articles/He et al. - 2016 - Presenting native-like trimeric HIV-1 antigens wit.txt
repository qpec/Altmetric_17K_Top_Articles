Structures of BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer in complex with broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bNAbs) have revealed the critical role of trimeric context for immune recognition of HIV-1.
Presentation of trimeric HIV-1 antigens on nanoparticles may thus provide promising vaccine
candidates. Here we report the rational design, structural analysis and antigenic evaluation of
HIV-1 trimer-presenting nanoparticles. We first demonstrate that both V1V2 and gp120 can
be presented in native-like trimeric conformations on nanoparticles. We then design
nanoparticles presenting various forms of stabilized gp140 trimer based on ferritin and a
large, 60-meric E2p that displays 20 spikes mimicking virus-like particles (VLPs). Particle
assembly is
confirmed
by electron microscopy
(EM), while
antigenic
profiles
are
generated using representative bNAbs and non-NAbs. Lastly, we demonstrate high-yield
gp140 nanoparticle production and robust stimulation of B cells carrying cognate VRC01
receptors by gp120 and gp140 nanoparticles. Together, our study provides an arsenal of
multivalent immunogens for HIV-1 vaccine development.

 A
critical goal of vaccine development for human immuno-
deficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is to induce broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in naı
¨ve individuals1.
Diverse bNAb families have been identified from HIV-1-infected
individuals2–4, revealing multiple sites of HIV-1 vulnerability
on the envelope (Env) glycoprotein. The functional Env is a
trimer of heterodimers, each containing a receptor-binding
protein (gp120) and a transmembrane fusion protein (gp41),
which associate into a viral spike via non-covalent interactions5.
This trimeric spike is inherently labile, which has hindered
rational vaccine design due to a limited structural understanding
of Env. The BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer6 has provided an
excellent antigenic7,8 and structural9–11 mimic of the native spike.
Structures of this trimer bound to various bNAbs illustrated the
critical role of trimeric context in the recognition of Env by
humoral
responses9,10,12–17.
Following
the
development
of
cleaved SOSIP trimers18–21, cleavage-independent, well-folded
gp140
trimers
were
also
proposed
as
alternative
trimer
immunogens22,23.
Soluble trimer alone, however, may not be the optimal
platform for HIV-1 vaccines, because subunit vaccines are often
not as immunogenic as those based on virus-like particles (VLPs).
With a dense and repetitive array of antigens displayed on
the surface, VLPs can induce robust immune responses24–28.
VLP vaccines against hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV)
and hepatitis E are among the most effective human vaccines,
showing efficacies of 95–100% (ref. 28). The optimal antigen
spacing
has
been
determined
using
haptenated
polymer
molecules29, with a minimum of 20–25 epitopes spaced by
5–10 nm
deemed
sufficient
for
effective
B-cell
activation.
Recently, Schiller and Chackerian30 elaborated the causes of
why HIV-1 fails to rapidly induce neutralizing B-cell responses
through a comparison of HIV-1 and HPV virions, which differ
significantly in their surface antigen display. Self-assembling
nanoparticles are of increasing interest to vaccine researchers,
because they provide robust platforms to investigate the concept
of particulate vaccines without involving complicated purification
methods typically required for VLPs31. The 24-meric ferritin (FR)
nanoparticle (12.2 nm in diameter) has been used to present the
hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza32,33, gp350 of Epstein–Barr
virus32 and scaffold antigens designed for HIV-1 and hepatitis C
virus34,35. Recently, Sliepen et al.36 reported the FR display of
BG505 SOSIP trimer with immunogenicity tested in mice and
rabbits. Two 60-meric nanoparticles—lumazine synthase (LS)
from Aquifex aeolicus (14.8 nm in diameter) and dihydrolipoyl
acetyltransferase (E2p) from Bacillus stearothermophilus (23.2 nm
in
diameter)—have
also
been
reported
in
the
design
of
multivalent HIV-1 immunogens. Specifically, LS was used as a
carrier for an engineered gp120 outer domain (eOD) to target the
germline precursors of VRC01-class bNAbs37,38, while E2p was
used to display the membrane-proximal external region (MPER)
of gp41 (ref. 39), but neither antigen was presented in the native
trimeric form. In principle, large nanoparticle platforms may be
more advantageous for uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) and virus-
like clustering of B-cell receptors (BCRs)40–42.
Here we investigate the nanoparticle display of trimeric HIV-1
antigens by combining structural and antigenic analyses with
B-cell activation assays. We first hypothesize that trimeric V1V2
and gp120 can be presented in native-like conformations around
the threefold axes on the surface of nanoparticles. To test this
hypothesis, we design constructs containing V1V2 and gp120
fused to the N terminus of FR subunit. These chimeric antigens
can assemble into nanoparticles with high affinity for bNAbs
targeting the apex, as well as other key epitopes, consistent with
native-like trimer conformations. We then examine the particu-
late display of a stabilized gp140 trimer with a redesigned heptad
repeat 1 (HR1) bend that shows significant improvement in
trimer purity (described in the companion paper43). To facilitate
this analysis, we design gp140-FR fusion constructs with different
combinations of gp41 truncation and gp41-FR linker length. All
gp140-FR nanoparticles bind to the apex-directed bNAbs with
sub-picomolar
affinities,
with
the
MPER-containing
gp140
nanoparticle also recognized by MPER-specific bNAb 4E10.
The utility of 60-meric E2p to present trimeric gp120 and
stabilized gp140 trimer in native-like conformations is also
confirmed. Lastly, we demonstrate that the ExpiCHO expression
system can markedly improve the yield and quality of a gp140-FR
nanoparticle, and that three nanoparticles can trigger B cells
carrying cognate VRC01 BCRs more effectively than gp140
trimer. We expect that the trimer-presenting nanoparticles
designed and validated in this study will have important
implications for HIV-1 vaccine development.
Results
FR nanoparticles presenting trimeric V1V2. The V1V2 region
of gp120 ranges from 50 to 90 residues in length with 1 in 10
residues N-glycosylated, forming a dense glycan shield on the
HIV-1 Env44. The V1V2-encoded glycan epitopes can be
recognized by bNAbs such as PG9 and PG16 (ref. 45),
CH01-04 (ref. 46), PGT141-145 (ref. 47) and PGDM1400
(ref. 17). A short segment centered at N160 defines the
specificity for most V1V2-directed bNAbs48,49. The crystal
structure of scaffolded V1V2 in complex with PG9 has been
determined for clade-C CAP45 and ZM109, revealing a Greek key
motif with strands B and C harbouring two critical glycans44,50.
The negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of
PG9 and PGDM1400 in complex with the SOSIP trimer indicated
that these two bNAbs are directed to the trimer apex with
different angles of approach12,17. In this study, we hypothesized
that the threefold axes on FR nanoparticle can be used to
present V1V2 in the native-like trimeric conformation found in
high-resolution structures of the SOSIP trimer9,10 (Fig. 1a, left).
We designed two constructs based on the V1V2 of clade-C
ZM109: one containing all three disulfide bonds (residues
118–206, termed V1V2Ext) and a shortened version containing
only two (residues 125–197, termed V1V2Sht), each fused to
the N terminus (D5) of FR subunit32,35 (Fig. 1a right, and
Supplementary Table 1a). After fitting the C termini of trimeric
V1V2 to the N termini of FR subunits around each threefold axis
on the particle surface, structural modelling yielded Ca root-
mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 3.7 and 0.8 Å for V1V2Ext-
FR and V1V2Sht-FR, respectively (Fig. 1b). Further analysis
revealed a dense glycan surface with diameters of 16.6 and
14.3 nm for V1V2Ext-FR and V1V2Sht-FR, respectively.
The two V1V2-FR constructs and the monomeric V1V2
were expressed transiently in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
I-negative (GnTI�/
�) HEK293S cells and purified using a
Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL) column followed by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column.
The SEC profiles displayed a prominent peak indicative of
well-formed nanoparticles (Fig. 1c), which were confirmed by
blue
native
polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis
(BN-PAGE)
(Fig. 1d). Negative-stain
EM revealed pure,
homogeneous
nanoparticles, as indicated by micrographs and two-dimensional
(2D) class averages (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Purity
and homogeneity appeared to be intrinsic to these V1V2-FR
nanoparticles despite their differences in V1V2 length and the
number of disulfide bonds contained. However, the V1V2 spikes
were diffuse in the 2D class averages (Fig. 1e), indicative of some
mobility. To probe the antigenicity of the V1V2 apex, we
measured
nanoparticle
binding
to
PG9

45),

 recognizes V1V2 in both monomeric and trimeric forms12,44,50,
and PGDM1400, which only binds to the apex of the native-like
SOSIP trimer17. Both V1V2-FR nanoparticles showed enhanced
binding to PG9 and PGDM1400 in comparison with V1V2
monomer by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(Fig. 1f). Using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and immuno-
globulin G (IgG), we characterized the kinetics of V1V2 binding
to PG9 and PGDM1400 in both monomeric and particulate
forms (Fig. 1g). As expected, V1V2 monomer bound to PG9 with
low affinity and showed no binding to PGDM1400. By contrast,
V1V2-FR
nanoparticles
bound
to
both
bNAbs
with
sub-nanomolar affinities, but notably different kinetics. The
faster on-rate observed for PGDM1400 indicated well-formed
trimeric apexes that can be readily recognized by this bNAb.
Of note, V1V2Sht-FR exhibited somewhat reduced affinities for
both bNAbs in comparison with V1V2Ext-FR, suggesting an
adversary effect of V1V2 shortening.
Our results demonstrate that the V1V2 region of HIV-1 Env
can be presented in a native-like trimeric conformation on
FR nanoparticle. We also observed homogenous nanoparticles for
V1V2Ext-FR derived from clade-C CAP45 (Supplementary
Fig. 1b–d), suggesting a design strategy adaptable to other strains.
Overall, particulate display of trimeric V1V2 substantially
improved its recognition by apex-directed bNAbs, supporting
the notion that V1V2 nanoparticles may be promising immuno-
gens to focus B-cell responses to this quaternary epitope.
FR nanoparticles presenting trimeric gp120. A 60-meric LS
nanoparticle presenting an engineered gp120 core lacking
variable loops (V1V2 and V3) and inner domain has been used
to target the germline precursors of VRC01 (refs 37,38), a
CD4-binding site (CD4bs)-directed bNAb51. However, structures
of BG505 SOSIP trimer in complex with the VRC01-class bNAb
PGV04 (ref. 52) revealed that glycans on the adjacent gp140
protomer are also involved in CD4bs recognition9,10, suggesting
an angle of approach constrained by the trimeric context.
The importance of trimer constraints for HIV-1 neutralization
was further demonstrated for human Ig knock-in mice, in which
only BG505 SOSIP trimer, but not the LS-eOD nanoparticle,
elicited
NAb
responses53.
Based
on
these
findings,
we
hypothesized that FR nanoparticle can be used to present
full-length, trimeric gp120 and expose all its encoded bNAb
epitopes in the SOSIP-like conformations. These nanoparticle
designs may avoid the complications intrinsic to gp140 trimers
containing
the
metastable
gp41
and
provide
alternative
‘trimer-like’ immunogens. Here we designed three FR fusion
constructs based on the gp120 of clade-A BG505: gp120Ext-FR
and gp120Sht-FR differed in their gp120 length, while gp120SS-
FR contained an additional disulfide bond aimed to stabilize the
gp120 termini (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1b). For
gp120Ext-FR, structural modelling revealed a nearly perfect
superposition of trimeric gp120 C termini (G495) and FR
N termini (D5) around each threefold axis on the nanoparticle
surface, with a Ca RMSD of 1.9 Å and a diameter of 26.2 nm
(Fig. 2b).
The three gp120-FR constructs and the monomeric gp120 were
expressed transiently in HEK293F cells. The secreted proteins
were purified using a GNL column followed by SEC on a
Superose 6 10/300 GL column. Among the three fusion
constructs, gp120Sht-FR showed the most pronounced particle
peak in the SEC profile, whereas gp120SS-FR appeared assembly
deficient (Fig. 2c). Consistently, BN-PAGE exhibited high
molecular weight (m.w.) bands for both gp120Ext-FR and
gp120Sht-FR (Fig. 2d), while negative-stain EM revealed homo-
geneous nanoparticles with 2D class averages calculated for
gp120Sht-FR (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). Overall,
gp120Sht-FR displayed more efficient particle assembly and a
surface decorated with well-formed gp120 spikes, as further
confirmed by cryo-EM (Fig. 2e).
To assess the antigenicity of gp120-FR nanoparticles, we
measured the kinetics of nanoparticle binding to a panel of
representative bNAbs and non-NAbs (Fig. 2f). We first tested
apex-directed bNAbs PG16 and PGDM1400. As expected,
gp120 monomer exhibited minimal binding to PG16 and almost
undetectable binding to PGDM1400. By contrast, two gp120
nanoparticles showed substantially enhanced binding to both
bNAbs with sub-nanomolar affinities. This confirmed that three
gp120s
centered
around
each
threefold
axis
on
the
FR
nanoparticle can indeed form a SOSIP-like trimer conformation.
For CD4bs-directed bNAb VRC01, both gp120Ext-FR and
gp120Sht-FR displayed enhanced binding with flat dissociation
curves. A similar trend was observed for NAb b12, which binds
the CD4bs with a different angle of approach and footprint
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). The avidity effect resulting from
multivalent display was most pronounced for bNAb PGT121,
which targets the V3 base and surrounding glycans: while
monomeric gp120 bound weakly to PGT121 with a fast off-rate,
gp120 nanoparticles showed strong binding with faster on-rates
and flat dissociation curves. We then measured nanoparticle
binding to non-NAbs. For CD4bs-directed F105, monomeric
gp120
exhibited
rapid
on-/off-rates,
whereas
gp120-FR
nanoparticles showed slow on-/off-rates. For V3-specific 19b,
gp120 nanoparticles did show somewhat enhanced binding in
comparison with monomeric gp120 (Supplementary Fig. 2c).
For both F105 and 19b, the differences in kinetics observed
between gp120 nanoparticles and monomer may be explained
by the mixed effect of steric hindrance and avidity resulting from
the dense display of gp120 trimers. Lastly, gp120 nanoparticles
showed negligible binding to CD4i-specific 17b, in contrast
to a notable recognition of gp120 monomer by this antibody
(Supplementary Fig. 2c).
60-meric nanoparticles presenting trimeric gp120. Considering
the previous reports of LS-eOD nanoparticles37,38, we investigated
whether such 60-mers could be used to present trimeric gp120. We
selected
two
thermostable
60-mers
with
distinct
structural
features—LS54 and E2p55—to examine this possibility. Compared
with the 12.2-nm diameter of FR, LS is only slightly larger in size
with a diameter of 14.8nm (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Structural
modelling indicated that the gp120Sht-LS nanoparticle surface
would be covered entirely by 20 trimeric gp120 spikes with an
estimated diameter of 28.7nm (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Following
transient expression in HEK293F cells and GNL purification, the
secreted protein was analysed by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL
column. However, no particle peak was observed in the SEC profile
of this LS fusion construct (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Consistently,
BN-PAGE showed a predominant pentamer band, which was
confirmed by negative-stain EM analysis of two SEC fractions
(Supplementary Fig. 3c–e). Our results thus indicate that the LS
nanoparticle platform may be suboptimal for displaying full-length
gp120 trimers.
We next examined E2p, a hollow dodecahedron with a
diameter of 23.2 nm55 (Fig. 3a). Structural modelling yielded a
gp120Sht-E2p
nanoparticle
with
a
diameter
of
37.6 nm
(Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 1c), close to the optimal size
for direct uptake by DCs56. The 293F-expressed, GNL-purified
gp120Sht-E2p was analysed by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL
column,
which
showed
a
distinctive
high
m.w.
peak
corresponding
to
the

dissociated gp120Sht-E2p trimer (Fig. 3c). Negative-stain EM
revealed large, homogeneous nanoparticles (Fig. 3d, left), with 2D
class averages showing hollow protein cages resembling the E2p
crystal structure55 (Fig. 3d right, and Fig. 3a). Unexpectedly,
although negative-stain EM validated nanoparticle assembly, it
also showed 2D class averages lacking the gp120 spikes. It was
unclear from the EM analysis alone whether some, if not all,
gp120s had formed trimeric spikes. To examine this issue, we
measured nanoparticle binding to a panel of bNAbs and
non-NAbs
by
BLI
(Fig.
3e
and
Supplementary
Fig.
3f).
Remarkably, gp120Sht-E2p showed sub-picomolar affinities for
apex-directed bNAbs PG16 and PGDM1400. The fast on-rates
and
flat
dissociation
curves
indicated
native-like
apexes
resembling that of the SOSIP trimer, but with the additional
advantage
of
avidity.
Similar
to
gp120-FR
nanoparticles,

bound
to CD4bs-specific F105 and V3-specific 19b at a similar
level to gp120Sht-FR, but showed minimal binding to the CD4i
antibody 17b.
As the receptor-binding protein, gp120 has been extensively
studied as an HIV-1 vaccine candidate57, but is now considered
suboptimal due to the exposed non-neutralizing surface that
should be buried within the native Env spike. Our results indicate
that display of full-length gp120 on FR and E2p can restore

 the native-like trimer conformation in the absence of gp41.
With SOSIP-like antigenicity and variations in both size and
surface spacing, these nanoparticles provide versatile platforms to
reinvestigate gp120-based HIV-1 vaccines.
FR nanoparticles presenting stabilized gp140 trimers. The
design and immunogenicity of a FR nanoparticle presenting
BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer have been reported36. Compared with
the SOSIP trimer, this gp140 nanoparticle showed notably
reduced binding by ELISA to apex-directed bNAbs PG9 and
PGT145, and to a bNAb targeting the gp120-gp41 interface,
PGT151. This is somewhat surprising given the antigenic profiles
we observed for the gp120 nanoparticles using BLI. Here we
sought to approach the FR display of gp140 trimer with a
redesigned HR1 bend (residues 547–569, termed HR1 redesign 1
(ref. 43)) and a detailed analysis of both linker length and gp41
truncation. The tested BG505 gp140 constructs included a gp140
truncated
at
position
664
(gp140.664),
gp140.664
with
a
10-residue linker (gp140.664-10aa) and a gp140 truncated at
position 681 with a 10-residue linker (gp140.681-10aa) (Fig. 4a
and Supplementary Table 1d). Structural modelling indicated
diameters of 30.1, 35.7 and 40.1 nm for gp140.664-FR, gp140.664-
10aa-FR and gp140.681-10aa-FR, respectively (Fig. 4b).
Since contaminant Env species cannot be eliminated during
particle assembly, the purity of gp140 trimer will have a
significant impact on the quality of resulting gp140 nanoparticles.
To illustrate this problem, we compared the SEC profiles of the
BG505 SOSIP.664 and HR1-redesigned trimers43, which differed
significantly in their purity (Fig. 4c). All gp140-FR fusion
constructs, including a SOSIP-based design36, were transiently
co-expressed with furin in HEK293F cells and purified using GNL
followed by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column. We first
confirmed assembly of the reported SOSIP-FR nanoparticle36 by
SEC and negative-stain EM (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Our HR1-
redesigned gp140-FR constructs exhibited similar SEC profiles,
but without the misfolded monomer peak observed for SOSIP-FR
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Interestingly, negative-stain EM revealed
an unknown protein species with a hexagonal structure mixed
with aggregates and well-formed gp140 nanoparticles (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4d). In this context, we examined the utility of Capto
Core 700 column58 for gp140 nanoparticle purification. Capto
Core 700 and GNL columns together reduced non-particle
impurities but not the hexagonal species, as indicated by SEC and
negative-stain EM (Supplementary Fig. 4e,f). We next examined
the combined use of Capto Core 700 and 2G12 affinity columns.
With Env-specific 2G12 purification, gp140.664-10aa-FR showed
the most visible particle peak in the SEC profile, in addition to a
reduced trimer peak and no dimer/monomer peak (Fig. 4d). For
all
three
HR1-redesigned
gp140-FR
constructs,
BN-PAGE
showed high m.w. bands corresponding to fully assembled
nanoparticles (Fig. 4e). These BN bands are consistent with the
SEC profiles (Fig. 4d) and the expected shift relative to the gp120-
FR BN bands (Fig. 2d), but in contrast to the previous work
showing SOSIP-FR nanoparticles at the top of the BN gel36. For
gp140.664-10aa-FR, negative-stain EM revealed homogeneous
nanoparticles with visible spikes displayed on the surface (Fig. 4f).
The stability of this nanoparticle construct was confirmed by
imaging a sample that had been frozen and thawed (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4g). Fully assembled nanoparticles were also
observed for gp140.664-FR and gp140.681-10aa-FR (Fig. 4g).
A large panel of bNAbs and non-NAbs was then used
to characterize the antigenicity of gp140-FR nanoparticles
with respect to the HR1-redesigned trimer43 (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig. 5). We first used bNAbs PGDM1400,
PGT145 and PG16 to probe the apex of gp140 trimers
displayed
on
the
nanoparticle
surface.
Remarkably,
all
gp140-FR
nanoparticles
showed
sub-picomolar
binding
affinities with flat dissociation curves due to avidity. For bNAb
PGT121, which targets the N332 supersite, gp140 nanoparticles
showed similar binding profiles to that of the HR1-redesigned
trimer with an increased on-rate. For CD4bs-directed bNAb
VRC01, gp140-FR nanoparticles displayed slow association
similar to gp120-FR nanoparticles. For bNAbs PGT151 and
35O22, which target the gp120–gp41 interface, we observed
different kinetics. For PGT151 (refs 13,14), a faster association
phase was observed with an unchanged dissociation pattern. By
contrast, 35O22 (ref. 59) showed an elevated on-rate that was
accompanied by an increased off-rate. Overall, all three gp140-FR
nanoparticles showed improved recognition by bNAbs, except for
VRC01, suggesting that the crowded surface display of gp140
trimers may affect this class of bNAbs60,61. For non-NAbs,
decreased binding was observed for CD4bs-specific F105 and b6,
with a more significant reduction for b6. For V3-specific 19b, a
slower association phase was observed for gp140 nanoparticles
compared with the individual trimer and gp120 nanoparticles
(Supplementary Figs 2c and 3f), suggesting a minimized V3
exposure due to the dense display of gp140 trimers. For F240,
which targets an immunodominant epitope in cluster I of gp41,
gp140 nanoparticles exhibited undetectable binding compared to
the residual binding observed for individual trimer. The gp140
nanoparticles showed no detectable binding to CD4i-specific 17b
and A32, similar to the individual trimer. Lastly, we used bNAbs
4E10 and 10E8 to probe the antigenicity of MPER in the context
of gp140.681-10aa-FR (Fig. 5c). Although this nanoparticle
exhibited strong binding to 4E10 with rapid association and flat
dissociation curves, it bound only weakly to 10E8. Structural
modelling revealed that MPER is proximal to the FR particle
surface with a distance of more than 10 nm from the outer glycan
surface (Fig. 4b, right), suggesting that steric hindrance may have
a significant impact on 10E8, which selects for a conformational
epitope extending beyond the 4E10-binding site16.
Our analyses thus revealed salient features of gp140-FR nano-
particles with a redesigned HR1 bend43. In contrast to the
previous report36, antigenic profiling by BLI clearly demonstrated
enhanced nanoparticle binding to bNAbs and reduced binding to
non-NAbs. The intrinsic purity of the HR1-redesigned trimer43
proved essential for the production of FR nanoparticles with
homogeneous, native-like Env spikes. Taken together, our results
suggest that these gp140 nanoparticles may be superior to gp140
trimers in eliciting robust B-cell responses to bNAb epitopes.
60-meric nanoparticles presenting stabilized gp140 trimer. We
examined the utility of LS and E2p 60-mers to display the HR1-
redesigned BG505 gp140 trimer43. Given the high density of
display sites on LS54, we first designed a construct containing a
10-residue linker between the C terminus of LS subunit and the N
terminus
of
gp140
(Supplementary
Table
1e).
Structural
modelling

an
estimated
diameter
of
39.2 nm
for
LS-10aa-gp140.664 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Following furin co-
expression in HEK293F cells and GNL purification, the secreted
protein
was
analysed
by
SEC
and
negative-stain
EM
(Supplementary Fig. 6b,c), in which nanoparticles were not
identified. We next designed an E2p fusion construct by
connecting the C terminus of gp140 to the N terminus of E2p
core subunit (Supplementary Table 1e). Structural modelling
indicated that the gp140.664-E2p nanoparticle, 41.5 nm in
diameter, can expose all bNAb epitopes on the Env trimer
(Fig. 6a). The designed gp140-E2p construct was co-transfected
with furin in HEK293F cells followed by GNL purification and
SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column. Although the overall

7
 expression was low, the most prominent peak in the SEC profile
corresponded to well-formed gp140-E2p nanoparticles (Fig. 6b),
which were confirmed by a high m.w. band at the top of the BN
gel (Fig. 6c). Consistently, homogeneous nanoparticles with a
dense layer of spikes were observed by negative-stain EM
(Fig. 6d). Together, our results indicate that gp140.664-E2p can
form VLP-size nanoparticles displaying a regular array of Env
trimers on the surface poised to engage immune responses.

 We first characterized the gp140.664-E2p nanoparticle using a
panel of bNAbs (Fig. 6e). For apex-directed bNAbs PG16 and
PGDM1400,
gp140-E2p
exhibited
slow
association
curves,
flat
dissociation
curves
and
sub-picomolar
affinities.
For
CD4bs-directed bNAb VRC01, gp140-E2p showed relatively
low binding and flat dissociation curves reminiscent of the
gp140-FR nanoparticles (Fig. 5a). For bNAb PGT121, we
observed
native-like
trimer
kinetics
with
slightly
reduced
on-rate. For bNAbs PGT151 and 35O22, gp140-E2p exhibited
binding profiles similar to gp140-FR nanoparticles. Overall,
gp140.664-E2p showed reduced recognition by bNAbs relative
to the individual trimer and gp140-FR nanoparticles, with the
most visible change observed for VRC01 and the least for
PGT151. This raised the possibility that non-native gp140 trimers
were displayed on the E2p surface. To examine this possibility, we
assessed nanoparticle binding to a panel of non-NAbs by BLI
(Fig. 6f). For CD4bs-specific F105, we observed weakened binding
with a faster off-rate relative to the individual trimer. Remarkably,
the 19b binding profile revealed a significant reduction in V3
exposure, in contrast to the enhancement observed for all other
gp120 and gp140 nanoparticles. The gp140-E2p nanoparticle also
bound to the CD4i antibody 17b at a minimal level. However,
gp140-E2p
exhibited
somewhat
increased
recognition
by
gp41-specific
F240
relative
to
the
individual
trimer
and
gp140-FR nanoparticles. Further analysis of the gp140 fusion
sites on both E2p and FR nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. 7)
suggested that the increased F240 binding could be the result of
structural strain in the gp41-E2p connecting region that may
require further optimization.
The
gp140.664-E2p
nanoparticle,
with
an
optimal
size

gp140-FR nanoparticles in eliciting robust immune responses.

that the HR1-redesigned gp140.681 trimer can also be displayed

nanoparticle platform for the development of trimer-presenting,
VLP-like HIV-1 vaccines.
High-yield production and effective B-cell stimulation. Robust
nanoparticle
expression
is
important
for
industrial-scale
production and immunogenicity studies. In this context, we
examined the utility of the ExpiCHO transient expression system,
using gp140.664-10aa-FR as a test case. The secreted protein was
harvested 2 weeks after transfection and purified using a 2G12
affinity column followed by SEC on a Superose 6 10/300 GL
column. The 200-ml ExpiCHO expression produced a particle
peak with a ultraviolet 280 nm absorbance value that is twofold
higher than that from the 2-l HEK293F expression (Fig. 7a). A
small particle peak was still visible in the SEC profile of the 2G12
flow-through after additional GNL purification. Overall, we
estimated a Z20-fold increase in particle yield. Negative-stain
EM confirmed the structural homogeneity of this ExpiCHO-
produced nanoparticle (Fig. 7b), which also demonstrated
improved antigenicity in comparison with the HEK293F-pro-
duced nanoparticle (Fig. 7c), with significantly enhanced binding
to the apex-directed bNAb PGDM1400.
Avidity differentiates VLPs and nanoparticles from individual
antigens by their B-cell responses in vivo. Thus, surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) was used to assess whether IgG can cross-react
with two gp140 trimers on the nanoparticle surface for bNAbs
PGDM1400 and PGT151 (Table 1). For gp140.664-E2p, faster on-
rates and slower off-rates were observed for IgGs relative to their
cognate Fabs, indicating interactions between one IgG and two
adjacent trimers on the E2p surface. By contrast, the differences in
kinetics between IgGs and Fabs were negligible for gp140.664-
10aa-FR, suggesting a less favourable IgG cross-reaction on the FR
surface perhaps due to its small size and greater curvature. We also
investigated the ability of gp120 and gp140 nanoparticles to
stimulate B cells carrying cognate receptors that can recognize
bNAb epitopes on the Env. To this end, we stimulated a B-cell line
carrying the VRC01 BCR62 either with antibodies directed to the
VRC01 light chain (anti-human k-chain) as a positive control or
with HIV-1 antigens. Nanoparticles gp120Sht-FR, gp120Sht-E2p
and
gp140.664-10aa-FR
were
compared
against
the
HR1-
redesigned gp140 trimer. Robust B-cell triggering was observed
for the three nanoparticles presenting multiple copies of gp120 or
gp140; whereas the individual gp140 trimer displayed a notably
weaker response (Fig. 7d). Our results thus indicate that these
nanoparticles may effectively engage B cells bearing bNAb
characteristics in vivo and suggest that a diverse array of
nanoparticle constructs reported here is capable of virus-like
BCR clustering. Future studies focusing on B-cell stimulation and
immunogenicity will facilitate the rational comparison and
selection of these particulate HIV-1 immunogens (Fig. 7e).
Discussion
HIV-1 vaccine development is entering a new era as high-
resolution Env structures and panels of bNAbs become available63.
In particular, the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer has established a
rigorous foundation for rational vaccine design6. Given the current
focus on gp140 trimer design in HIV-1 research18–23, the reported
immunogenicity of the SOSIP trimer will provide a baseline for
comparison with forthcoming trimer-based vaccines21. However,
the lower-than-expected trimer immunogenicity21 suggests that
factors beyond trimer stabilization have to be taken into account in
future vaccine design. One such critical factor is the multivalent
display of native Env spikes30. Although the use of HIV-1 virions
bearing various forms of Env has been explored64,65, sparse display
and undetermined spacing of trimeric spikes may not be optimal
for eliciting robust B-cell responses30. Thus, self-assembling
nanoparticles with proper size and surface spacing that mimic
VLPs would be of high priority in future vaccine development.
Recently, Sliepen et al. reported the design and immunogenicity of
a FR nanoparticle presenting the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer36.
However, the suboptimal structural and antigenic properties of this
nanoparticle highlighted the need for a more in-depth analysis.
In this study, we sought to extend the limit of multivalent
HIV-1 vaccine design with a structure-based, hypothesis-driven
approach. Based on the SOSIP trimer structures9,10,11, we
assessed particulate display of trimeric Env antigens on FR, LS
and E2p nanoparticle platforms. We showed for the first time that
V1V2 and gp120 can form native-like trimeric spikes on FR and
E2p nanoparticles. With simple design, efficient production and
SOSIP-like antigenic profiles, these nanoparticles provide useful
tools to investigate B-cell responses to the apex and other bNAb
epitopes in a multivalent form. By contrast, the inherent Env
metastability has posed a great challenge to the particulate display
of gp140 trimer. Although bNAb affinity purification is effective
for individual gp140 trimer18, it may not be optimal for gp140
nanoparticles, as gp140 trimerization and particle assembly will
likely occur simultaneously. Therefore, the intrinsic purity of
gp140 trimer is critical to nanoparticle vaccine design using the
gene fusion strategy. To address this issue, we adopted a novel
gp140 trimer with a redesigned HR1 bend that significantly
improved the purity of well-folded trimers43. When this trimer
was displayed on FR and E2p, the resulting nanoparticles
produced desirable antigenic profiles against a panel of bNAbs
and non-NAbs. Of note, an alternative approach to gene fusion is
to chemically conjugate the purified gp140 trimers to the surface
of a nanoparticle or VLP, as evidenced by the development of
bacteriophage Qb-based VLP vaccines25.
Our study also demonstrated how size and surface spacing affect
the ability of a nanoparticle to display large, complex HIV-1
antigens. The 60-meric LS (14.8 nm) is only marginally larger than
the 24-meric FR (12.2nm), but significantly smaller than the
60-meric E2p (23.2nm). Although LS has been successfully used to
display a truncated version of gp120 (refs 37,38), the LS fusion
constructs containing full-length gp120 and gp140 were unable to
assemble, probably due to insufficient spacing between the displayed
trimeric antigens. The results for FR and E2p demonstrated that
greater surface spacing may allow for more efficient nanoparticle
assembly and antibody access to the epitopes near the nanoparticle
surface. However, over-distanced antigens on the particle surface
may increase flexibility and lead to less effective cross-linking of
cognate BCRs in vivo. Nevertheless, robust triggering of cognate
VRC01 receptors in B-cell activation assays confirmed that
appropriate surface spacing enabled effective BCR clustering by
gp120 or gp140 trimers presented on FR and E2p nanoparticles.
In summary, the rational design, structural analysis, antigenic
profiling and B-cell activation assays in this study have established
a novel array of trimer-presenting nanoparticles with potential as
HIV-1 vaccine antigens that merit detailed investigation of
immunogenicity.
Methods
Nanoparticle design and modelling. A Perl script was developed to (1) identify
threefold display sites on the surface of a given nanoparticle; (2) superpose the
C termini of a trimeric HIV-1 antigen onto the N termini of three particle
subunits around each threefold axis on the nanoparticle surface; and (3) generate
coordinates for the resulting trimer-presenting nanoparticle with various structural
parameters calculated at the completion of the process. The nanoparticle model
was then visualized using UCSF Chimera (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) for
manual inspection and determination of the antigen-particle linker length. The
computer code for nanoparticle modelling can be obtained from J.Z. upon request.
Antibodies. We used a panel of bNAbs and non-NAbs to characterize the anti-
genicity of designed trimer-presenting nanoparticles. 2G12 and b12, as well as non-

 PEI–MAX (1.0 mg ml�1) in 25 ml of Opti-MEM, whereas for gp140-based anti-
gens, 800 mg of antigen plasmid and 300 mg of furin plasmid were mixed for
transfection. After incubation for 30 min, the DNA–PEI–MAX complex was
added to 1-litre 293F/S cells. Culture supernatants were harvested 5 days after
transfection, clarified by centrifugation at 1,800 r.p.m. for 22 min and filtered using
0.45-mm filters (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HIV-1 antigen proteins were extracted
from the supernatant using a GNL column (Vector Labs). The bound proteins were
eluted with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 1 M methyl-a- D-mannopyranoside
and purified by SEC on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column or a Superose 6
10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined using
ultraviolet absorption at 280 nm (UV280) with theoretical extinction coefficients.
For gp140-FR nanoparticles, Capto 700 Core column (GE Healthcare) and 2G12
affinity column6 were used in various combinations with SEC to improve the
particle purity. The ExpiCHO transient expression system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was used to improve the particle yield for the gp140.664-10aa-FR
construct. ExpiCHO cells and expression media were purchased from the vendor
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), with the transfection performed according to the
vendor’s protocol. Protein was harvested from the supernatant 2 weeks after
co-transfection with furin and subjected to Env-specific purification using a 2G12
affinity column.
BN-PAGE. Individual antigens and trimer-presenting nanoparticles were analysed
by BN-PAGE and stained using Coomassie blue. The protein samples were mixed
with G250 loading dye and added to a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Life Tech-
nologies). BN-PAGE gels were run for 2 h at 150 V using NativePAGE running
buffer (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Negative-stain EM. The purified nanoparticles were analysed by negative stain
EM. A 3-ml aliquot containing B0.01 mg ml�1 of the sample was applied for 15 s
onto a carbon-coated 400 Cu mesh grid that had been glow discharged at 20 mA
for 30 s, then negatively stained with 2% uranyl formate for 45 s. Data were
collected using a FEI Tecnai Spirit electron microscope operating at 120 kV, with
an electron dose of B30 e� Å�2 and a magnification of � 52 000 that resulted in a
pixel size of 2.05 Å at the specimen plane. Images were acquired with a Tietz
4k � 4k TemCam-F416 CMOS camera using a nominal defocus of 1,000 nm and
the Leginon package66. The nanoparticles were picked automatically using DoG
Picker and put into a particle stack using the Appion software package67.
Reference-free, 2D class averages were calculated using particles binned via the
iterative msa/mra Clustering 2D Alignment68 and IMAGIC software systems69,
and sorted into classes.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Each well of a Costar 96-well assay plate
(Corning) was first coated with 50 ml PBS containing 0.2 mg of V1V2 antigen. The
plates were incubated overnight at 4 �C and then washed five times with wash
buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Each well was then coated with 150 ml of
a blocking buffer consisting of PBS, 20 mg ml�1 blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad)
and 5% fetal bovine serum. The plates were incubated with the blocking buffer for
1 h at room temperature and then washed five times with wash buffer. Next, the
apex-directed bNAbs were diluted in the blocking buffer to a maximum con-
centration of 2 mg ml�1, followed by a fivefold dilution series. For each antibody
dilution, a total of 50 ml was added to the appropriate wells. Each plate was
incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and then
washed five times with wash buffer. Next, a 1:5,000 dilution of goat anti-human
IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was made in the wash
buffer, with 50 ml of this diluted secondary antibody added to each well. The plates
were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then
washed five times with wash buffer. Finally, the wells were developed with 50 ml
of TMB (Life Sciences) for 3–5 min before stopping the reaction with 50 ml of 2 N
sulfuric acid, all at room temperature. The resulting plate readouts were measured
at a wavelength of 450 nm.
Biolayer interferometry. The kinetics of HIV-1 antigen (monomer, trimer and
nanoparticle) binding to bNAbs and non-NAbs was measured using an Octet
RED96 instrument (forte
´Bio, Pall Life Sciences). All assays were performed with
agitation set to 1,000 r.p.m. in forte
´BIO 1 � kinetic buffer. The final volume for all
the solutions was 200 ml per well. Assays were performed at 30 �C in solid black
96-well plates (Geiger Bio-One). Antibody (5 mg ml�1) in 1 � kinetic buffer was
loaded onto the surface of anti-human Fc Capture Biosensors (AHC) for 300 s.
A 60-s biosensor baseline step was applied before the analysis of the association of
the antibody on the biosensor to the testing antigen in solution for 200 s. A twofold
concentration gradient of testing antigen was used in a titration series of six. The
dissociation of the interaction was followed for 300 s. Correction of baseline drift
was performed by subtracting the averaged shift recorded for a sensor loaded with
antibody but not incubated with antigen, or a sensor without antibody but
incubated with antigen. The concentrations of soluble monomers, trimers and
nanoparticles in this assay were calculated according to the estimated m.w. For
example, the m.w. of a gp140 trimer was calculated as m.w. of (gp140 þ
glycans) � 3, estimated to be B530 kDa, whereas the m.w. of a gp140-FR
nanoparticle was calculated as m.w. of (gp140-FR þ glycans) � 24, estimated to be
B4696 kDa. Of note, these m.w. values are only approximate and may vary due to
the heterogeneity of glycans. Octet data were processed by forte
´Bio’s data
acquisition software v.8.1. Experimental data were fitted for V1V2 apex-directed
bNAbs using a global fit 1:1 model to determine the KD values and other kinetic
parameters.
Surface plasmon resonance. SPR experiments were performed to determine the
kinetics for bNAb binding to nanoparticles gp140.664-10aa-FR and gp140.664-
E2p. All experiments were performed on a Biacore 3000 optical biosensor equipped
with research-grade CM3 sensor chip (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The
instrument temperature was set at 25 �C for all kinetic analyses. Filtered and
degassed 1 � HBS-EP þ buffer (Biacore AB) was used as running buffer and sample
buffer for all analyses. PGT128 IgG was first immobilized onto CM3 sensor chip in
flow cells 2 and 4 at an immobilization level about 3,500 RU by NHS/EDC
chemistry using Amine Coupling Kit (GE Healthcare), and a control antibody was
also immobilized at a similar immobilization level in flow cells 1 and 3 as reference.
To prepare the surface for kinetic analysis, gp140.664-E2p or gp140.664-10aa-FR1
particle was diluted to the concentration of 1 mg ml�1 in running buffer and the
particle solution was injected over all four flow cells at a flow rate of 5 ml min�1 for
60 min. The chip surface was then washed extensively by running buffer at a flow
rate of 100 ml min�1 until the baseline was stabilized. A custom wizard application
was devised to conduct the kinetic analysis, including the following elements: (1)
detection mode was varied by cycle, in which flow cell 2-1 (Fc2-1) was used for Fab
analysis and flow cell 4-3 (Fc4-3) was used for IgG detection; (2) flow rate of
30 ml min�1 was set for all experiments; (3) a 10-min wash step was used to
stabilize the baseline before sample injection; (4) a 5-min sample kinetic injection
with a 20-min dissociation phase was set and sample injection was varied by cycle,
in which Fc 2-1 was for Fab injection and Fc 4-3 was for IgG injection; (5) an
additional wash step of 20-min was inserted to wash off any bound antibody.
To ensure all bound antibody has been washed away from the chip surface and the
baseline was stabilized, an extensive wash step running at 100 ml min�1 was set
separately between each concentration analysis. Samples (PGT151 Fab, PGT151
IgG, PGDM1400 Fab and PGDM1400 IgG) were prepared freshly from the stock in
running buffer at the concentration of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 nM, and were
injected individually over the designated chip surface according to the custom
wizard application. A few samples were injected in duplicates to ensure the binding
is reproducible. Several random buffer ‘blank’ injections were also conducted over
different surfaces (Fc 2-1 or Fc 4-3) as reference before, between and after antibody
sample injections. Both data processing and kinetic fitting were performed using
BIAevaluation ver 4.1 (Biacore AB). The binding responses from each sample were
double-referenced, that is, subtract the response over the reference surface and
subtract the average response of the ‘blank’ injection from the sample binding
responses. The association and dissociation phase data sets were merged
together to globally fit the responses. The data were fitted using a 1:1 Langmuir
binding model for both Fab and IgG samples. The association and dissociation
rate constants (ka and kd) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) were
calculated (Table 1).
B-cell activation assay. WEHI231 cells expressing a doxycyclin-inducible form of
VRC01 BCR62 were maintained in advanced DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with

on a LSR II flow cytometer (BD). After each run cells were stimulated with 1 ml of
1 mg ml�1 ionomycin (Sigma) to verify indo loading.
