Bone grafts are one of the most commonly transplanted tissues. However, 
autologous grafts are in short supply, and can be associated with pain and donor-
site morbidity. The creation of tissue-engineered bone grafts could help to fulfil 
clinical demand and provide a crucial resource for drug screening. Here, we show 
that vibrations of nanoscale amplitude provided by a newly developed bioreactor 
can differentiate a potential autologous cell source, mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs), into mineralized tissue in 3D. We demonstrate that nanoscale 
mechanotransduction can stimulate osteogenesis independently of other 
environmental factors, such as matrix rigidity. We show this by generating 
mineralized matrix from MSCs seeded in collagen gels with stiffness an order of 
magnitude below those needed to induce bone formation in vitro. Our approach is 
scalable and can be compatible with 3D scaffolds. 
 
With an aging population increasing the demand for musculoskeletal surgery, there is 
a growing need to provide viable bone grafts for clinical use1. A wide range of surgeries 
require bone grafts2, whose supply is limited3. Also, they are associated with donor-
site morbidity4. Allogeneic decellularized grafts or synthetic ceramic alternatives, 
although widely accepted as substitutes, suffer from being biologically inferior in vivo 
relative to viable bone grafts1, 3.  
The creation of appropriate 3D bone mimics would also support a fail-fast, fail-cheap 
workflow for the pharmaceutical sector, allowing the rapid prioritization of the best 
candidates for in vivo or on-chip testing of drug leads5 for bone-related disorders, such 
as osteoporosis. A scalable method that does not require soluble factors or 
osteoinductive scaffolds to direct differentiation would be advantageous; it would 
prevent the confounding effects that arise from the use of differing media 
formulations or from the reliance on a limited selection of materials that are typically 
highly engineered6-13. 
Tissue engineering provides a route to bioengineering bone-like environments, in 
which autologous cells with osteogenic potential, such as MSCs, are mineralized 
within a 3D scaffold using a bioreactor to aid in vitro tissue development. To achieve 
  
3 
cost-effective osteogenesis without the use of defined media or osteoinductive 
scaffolds requires a bioreactor that itself drives osteogenesis14; such a bioreactor 
would have implications for the pharmaceutical sector and the clinic15. 
The designs of currently available bioreactors are complex, often involving unfamiliar 
and hard-to-use parts, such as rotary and perfusion chambers and associated tubing. 
The creation and use of these parts present major sterility, upscale and cost issues16. 
It would therefore be advantageous for a new bioreactor to be able to sit in a standard 
incubator, consist of a few parts, and to use off-the-shelf cell-culture containers that 
are easy to move between the bioreactor and a laminar-flow cabinet. 
We have previously used nanoscale vibrational displacements to stimulate 
osteogenesis in MSCs cultured on tissue culture plastic in 2D17, 18. This work identified 
that mechanical stimulation of 1000 Hz frequency with 15-nm vertical displacement 
promoted MSC differentiation18. The process was shown to be RhoA kinase (ROCK) 
dependent, consistent with known mechanisms of MSC osteogenesis in 2D cultures 
via increased adhesion-driven cytoskeletal tension18-20. 
 
Multi-sample nanovibrational bioreactor for 2D osteogenesis 
In our previous 2D work18 only one sample could be stimulated at a time, and issues 
existed around vibration transmission, which meant that the nanovibrational setup 
was complex and lacked scalability. In our nanovibrational bioreactor, we employed a 
reverse piezo effect, where an applied voltage drives nanoscale displacements from 
piezo ceramics. The bioreactor design incorporates a 13-piezo array, mounted onto 
an aluminium base, directing expansion upwards (Figure 1a). Actuators can be wired 
in series or in parallel, with parallel wiring allowing higher vibration amplitudes to be 
produced. Mounted above the array is a top plate, which has a surface area capable 
of accommodating two 6-well culture plates. This plate is dual-layered, using 
aluminium bonded to magnetic stainless steel (Figure 1a). This design provides a 
balance of weight, rigidity, and the ability to magnetically couple 6-well plates via 
ferrite magnets attached to the base of each well. The magnets allow vibration to be 
  
4 
transferred to the 6-well plates, to provide extra rigidity to ensure the consistent 
transfer of vibration amplitude across each well, and to facilitate the removal of the 
plate when cells need to be fed. 
When employing high-frequency vibration, it is important to consider the possibility 
of deformation. Using ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA), harmonic response models 
at 1000 Hz with 30 nm amplitude predicted: (1) that the bioreactor top plate would 
provide rigidity, minimizing average deformation at the nanometre level to  5 nm or 
17% (Figure 1b); and (2) that the magnetic attachment of 6-well plates maintains 
amplitude accuracy across the growth surfaces (within 3.3 nm (11%) for frequencies 
<3600 Hz) (Figure 1c). 
Laser interferometry techniques developed for gravitational wave research21 were 
used to validate FEA simulations. When wired in series, piezo actuators, without a top 
plate, gave an average vibration amplitude of 24.7 nm (8.3% accuracy between 
actuators - 1000 Hz, 80 Vpk-pk).  Across 25 set points (Figure 1d), amplitude 
measurement of the top plate demonstrated the plate vibrated at 28.2 nm (11.2% 
amplitude consistency). Measurements made with the 6-well plates magnetically 
attached to the top plate (Figure 1d) revealed a slight reduction in displacement 
amplitude. However, displacement amplitude across multiple wells was shown to be 
consistent (21.2% accuracy in the range of 0-3000 Hz (Figure 1e)). Above 4000 Hz, the 
amplitudes increased towards a resonant condition (Figure 1e – denoted by large 
variance), as predicted by ANSYS (Figure 1c). 
To confirm osteogenesis occurs in 2D, MSCs (from human bone marrow) were 
stimulated at 1000 Hz (80 Vpk-pk giving a 22 nm vertical displacement)18. While 1000 
Hz may seem fast relative to the stimulation parameters employed with traditional 
mechanical bioreactors, it is noteworthy that for hydrated bone to be optimally 
piezoactive, a kilohertz range (972 Hz) stimulus is required22. Furthermore, research 
into the effects of nanotopography indicates that feature sizes of 20 nm high are 
osteogenic23, 24; this is very close to the 22 nm displacement we use here. After 7 days 
of MSC culture, quantitative (q)PCR was used to assess the expression of the 
osteospecific transcription factor, osterix, and significant up-regulation of its 
  
5 
expression was observed following nanostimulation (Figure 1f). Furthermore, levels 
of the proteins, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 14 days and osteopontin (OPN) at 21 
days, were assessed in nanostimulated MSCs and compared to mature primary human 
osteoblasts using in-cell western analysis. Both the bioreactor-stimulated MSCs and 
the osteoblasts produced higher levels of these bone marker proteins relative to 
unstimulated MSCs (Figure 1g). These time points were chosen as they map onto 
classical osteodifferentiation progression models for transcription factors (osterix), 
early stage markers (ALP) and later stage markers (OPN)25. 
The 2D paradigm for osteogenesis19, 20, 26 indicates that adhesion-based signalling, 
including signalling via ROCK18, is important for nanovibration-induced MSC 
differentiation. However, in 3D systems, cellular mechanoreceptors might also play a 
role in MSC osteogenesis. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels function as 
mechanosensors, and TRP channel activation occurs via cytoskeletal linkage27.  Two 
recently discovered mechanosensitive cation channels, called Piezo1 and Piezo228, 29, 
affect cytoskeletal organization30, 31 when mechanically activated,  and render cells 
mechanosensitive to cell adhesion and/or cytoskeletal strain32. In non-excitable (non-
neural) cells, TRP and Piezo channels have been implicated in the transduction of 
vibrational force, for example in the  stereocillia that signal changes in fluid pressure 
in the ear during hearing,  indicating the sensitivity of these channels to high frequency 
vibration33, 34. In addition, in a mouse model of osteoporosis, the depletion of  the 
channel Trpv1 (TRP vallanoid sub-family 1)35 protected mice against ovariectomy-
induced bone loss36.  
A wide range of stimulus can activate TRP channels, including mechanical force, as 
long as the energy transduction to the channel is sufficient for mechanical gating to 
occur37. Thus, we hypothesised a role for these channels in the response of MSCs to 
nanovibrational stimulation. Currently available inhibitors of Piezo1 (GsMTX4)38 and 
of TRPV1 (QX314)39, designed for studies of action potential, act transiently. Thus, to 
measure their effect on nanovibration-induced MSC differentiation, a very early stage 
marker of cell response was selected. Mitogen activated protein kinases, such as 
extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), provide a likely marker for the switch 
between MSC growth and osteogenic differentiation phases40, with the onset of 
  
6 
differentiation typified by growth repression through high levels of ERK 1/2 activation 
(phosphorylation)41.   
Using an MSC seeding protocol, which allows 1 hour for cell attachment in 10% serum, 
cells were both stimulated and synchronised at G0 by applying nanovibrations and 
serum starvation (1% serum) for 24 hours. After synchronising, cells were released 
back into the cell cycle using 10% serum for 23 hours before the addition of GsMTX4 
or of QX314 for a further 1 hour (24 hours total). Active, phosphorylated, pERK1/2 was 
then assessed relative to total ERK1/2 protein levels using in-cell western analysis. The 
inhibition of both the Piezo1 and TRPV1 channels repressed ERK1/2 phosphorylation 
in the nanovibration-stimulated cells; no repression was seen in control cultures, 
suggesting that these changes were mechanotransduction-driven via Piezo1 and 
TRPV1 (Figure 1h). From these results, we hypothesised that channel-based 
mechanosensors might be important for the nano-mechanostimulation of MSCs in 3D.  
 
Nanovibration in 3D gel volumes. 
The ability to mechanically stimulate cells at the nanoscale in 3D is challenging 
because of the requirement to transmit nanoscale cues into 3D volumes. In order to 
test this, a 3D biocompatible scaffold that in itself should not initiate osteogenesis was 
used; collagen type I42. The gel was set at low elastic modulus as high-modulus gels 
can confer osteoinductive properties; 40 kPa (notably the stiffness of pre-calcified 
bone matrix) has been shown to be osteoinductive to MSCs7, 26, 43-45. Here, we used 
gels with a bulk elastic moduli of 108 Pa without cells, and with a moduli of 73.5 Pa 
at a loading density of 40,000 cells/ml of gel (Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 2a, 
2b). Local elastic modulus (as a cell might sense it) was measured using AFM, and 
found to be 59 Pa without cells and 62 Pa with cells at a loading density of 40,000 
cells/ml (Supplementary Fig 1). 
To start to understand if collagen could transmit the nanovibrations, FEA harmonic 
response analysis was performed assuming that the 108 Pa collagen gel was within 
the linear elastic range and incompressible (Poisson ratio ν = 0.5)46. For collagen gels 
  
7 
under strain, the Poisson ratio describes the absolute ratio between transverse and 
longitudinal strain. For this analysis, a Poisson ratio, ν, of less than 0.5 was chosen. 
Several values for ν were tested for their replication of the interferometric result with 
an asymptotic increase towards 0.5 improving the accuracy of the simulation (i.e. the 
ability to transmit a full vibration amplitude of 20 nm). The value used also resulted in 
a bulk modulus of the same magnitude as water (Supplementary Table 1). The bulk 
modulus describes a material’s resistance to uniform compression; such materials 
tend to have a high water content, as in the case of collagen gels. Modelling of the 
polystyrene container showed it produced minimal deformation (Figure 2d). 
Modelling of the gel (at 2.5 ml of gel per well), at 1000 Hz with 20 nm displacement, 
predicted an average amplitude of 29 nm at the edge meniscus and 18 nm at the gel 
centre (Figure 2e).  
Using these same modelling parameters, shear stress and strain within the gel 
produced peak values of 3.8 mPa and 1.1 x 10-4 m/m respectively at 1000 Hz (shear 
stress is shown in Figure 2f). These values fall within the linear region of the shear 
stress-strain plot in Figure 2c (from rheological measurement). This supports the 
validity of using a constant elastic modulus value for modelling nanovibration, at this 
frequency, since the strains produced are within the linear elastic range of the 
material. Hence, the viscoelastic properties of the collagen gel are predicted to allow 
the transfer of high frequency vibrations to the cells seeded in 3D. 
Interferometry was again used to confirm predictions. The bioreactor was set up with 
a 6-well plate and with cells (40,000 MG63 cells/ml –note, MG63 cells were chosen as 
they can be used on the interferometer outside of the cell culture laboratory) seeded 
within 2.5 ml collagen gels. Measurements were carried out both at the centre and 
outer edge of the gels. Amplitude calibration showed that for the frequencies 
examined, gel vibration increased linearly with input voltage to the bioreactor (Figure 
2h). In terms of frequency, the top surface of the gel was found to follow the surface 
of the 6-well plate consistently, showing no dampening of the vibration up to 2000 Hz. 
Gel samples that contained cells did not deviate in response from gels without cells 
(Figure 2i). Up to 2000 Hz, amplitude appeared to be increased at the edge of the gel 
at the meniscus curvature, thus reflecting the predicted data (Figure 1b). The vibration 
  
8 
amplitude seen at the edge of the gel was 35 nm compared to 24 nm at the centre for 
1000 Hz (Figure 2i – inset).  
Resonant frequencies were recorded in the region of 2500, 3500 and 5000 Hz and 
were observed in both empty and gel-filled 6-well plates. We also observed an 
increase in vibration amplitude at the outer edge of each well when compared to its 
centre, together with a decrease in measurement accuracy (Figure 2i). If the gel 
volume is doubled to 5 ml, the data indicate that a slight amplitude-dampening effect 
occurs, although the gels act similarly in terms of where resonance occurs with 
different voltage input, and with respect to middle/edge amplitude changes 
(Supplementary Figure 2). Our results also indicate that cells within the 100 Pa gels 
should receive predictable and reproducible nanoscale displacements. However, this 
gel environment is dramatically different to the hard environment of the plastic cell 
culture well (as used to generate Figure 1f & g) or to 40 kPa gels, which have previously 
been used to stimulate osteogenesis7, 26, and this presents a significant challenge in 
terms of achieving osteogenesis. 
 
Nanovibration driven 3D osteogenesis. 
To test MSCs for osteogenesis in the 108 Pa collagen gels, a range of viability and 
osteo-specific transcriptional, protein and mineralisation assays were performed. In 
terms of viability, our analysis showed that MSCs embedded in these gels (referred to 
hereafter as 3D) remain viable during nanostimulation (Supplementary Figure 3). To 
assay for osteogenesis, qPCR at days 7, 14 and 21 of culture was performed, and 
showed increased RUNX2, collagen I, ALP, OPN, osteocalcin (OCN) and bone 
morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) expression in the nanostimulated MSCS in 3D, 
compared to unstimulated MSCs (Figure 3a). In MSCs that were nanostimuled, four of 
the six genes above were downregulated at day 21, as the osteogenic process was 
transcriptionally completed (Figure 3a). OCN protein levels were also assayed at day 
21 and found to be increased following nanostimulation demonstrating progression 
from gene to protein (Supplementary Figure 4).  
  
9 
To study in vitro mineralisation, we used a combination of von Kossa staining for 
phosphate, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT). Von 
Kossa staining indicated that relatively little mineralisation had taken place within 
control gels (Figure 3b – images are from 6 weeks of culture). However, following 
nanostimulation at 15 nm displacement, significant mineralisation was detected in 
MSCs cultured in 3D. Mineralisation levels were higher in these cells than in MSCs 
after 4 weeks of culture in osteospecific media (OSM) (Figure 3b). In longer-term, 6 
week, culture, MSCs cultured in 3D with OSM caught up and underwent a significant 
increase in mineralisation compared to control cells (Figure 3b).  
Within the Raman fingerprint region of 500 to 1500 cm-1 (Figure 3c,d,f and 
Supplementary Figure 5), bovine cortical bone showed a dominant phosphate (PO43- 
v1) peak at 960 cm-1 and a secondary peak at 1072 cm-1, characteristic of substituted 
carbonate (CO32-) and indicative of the mineral component of bone47, as well as of 
hydroxyapatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, where CO32- can substitute for OH- and/or PO43- 
(Figure 3c). For MSCs cultured in control gels, a broad, merged peak from 1200 cm-1 
was observed (likely due to the large amount of collagen present), and protein-related 
contributions from amide I (1595-1720 cm-1) and III (1243 -1269 cm-1) and from CH2 
(1451 cm-1).  Significantly, no bone mineral peaks were noted in these cells (Figure 3d) 
and µCT revealed no mineral deposits (Figure 3e). In nanostimulated MSCs in 3D, two 
peaks at 960 cm-1 (PO43- v1) and 1072 cm-1 (CO32-) were observed (Figure 3f), and µCT 
showed the accumulation of bone mineral (Figure 3g, Supplementary Table 2). 
Together, these findings demonstrate that nanostimulation can drive osteogenesis 
and mineralisation in MSCs in an otherwise non-osteogenic 3D environment. 
 
3D nanovibrational stimulus of mechanosensitive channels. 
We next tested ion channel sensitivity to 3D nanostimulation in order to relate ion 
channel expression to cytoskeletal tension. Temporal qPCR was performed on MSCs 
at days 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 of culture to assay the expression of  Piezo 1, Piezo 2, TRPV1 
and of potassium channel subfamily K receptor 2 (KCNK2, which is stimulated by 
membrane stretch48). Nanostimulation of MSCs in 3D produced a similar trend across 
  
10 
all the channels tested, specifically a bi-phasic high to low expression pattern from day 
3 to day 5, recovery to a higer level at days 7-14 to a lowered expression pattern at 
day 21, with all channel transcripts significantly downregulated by day 21, post-
osteogenesis (Figure 4a). From our 2D data18 and from the literature on osteospecific 
differentiation on a range of 2D surfaces19, 20, it could be postulated that intracellular 
tension should increase during osteogenesis; thus, if the channels were involved in 
osteogenesis in 3D, they might be sensitive to tension inhibitors, such as the ROCK 
inhibitor (Y27632) and the myosin II inhibitor (blebbistatin).  
To test this hypothesis, day 5 was selected as a representative time point for the 
downregulation of Piezo 1, Piezo 2 and TRPV1 channel expression (Figure 4a) and, as 
we were now investigating a single time point, MSCs from additional donors were 
supplemented into the analysis. All three ion channels were downregulated by day 5, 
with Piezo 2 being significantly down-regulated. The trend was noted in OSM-treated 
cells, but was more pronounced in MSCs subjected to nanostimulation (Figure 4b-e). 
Upon addition of Y27632 and blebbistatin, the down-regulation of Piezo 2 expression 
was reversed, indicating a relationship exists between this receptor and cellular 
tension. This trend was noted in both nanostimulated and OSM-treated cells, but was 
more pronounced following nanostimulation (Figure 4c).  TRPV1 also showed a 
tension-dependant link, increasing in expression with nanostimulation and OSM 
treatment following treatment with Y27632. Again, this was more pronounced for 
nanostimulated cells, as blebbistatin treatment increased the expression of TRPV1 
only in nanostimulated MSCs (Figure 4e).  
The effect of actin and ROCK inhibition on early stage (to day 5) osteogenic transcripts 
was next investigated in nanostimulated MSCs. BMP2 receptor (BMPR1a) was 
differentially regulated in blebbistatin-inhibited MSCs (Figure 4f). The response to 
BMP2 is a first step in osteogenesis and it stimulates transcription factors, such as 
RUNX2 (the master osteogenic transcription factor, which peaks in expression at day 
5-10)25. At this early time point, however, RUNX2 expression was not altered in 
response to either inhibitor (Figure 4g). ALP, a later stage marker of osteogenesis 
(which peaks in expression day 1425, 49), was minimally expressed (Figure 4). At day 
  
11 
14, blebbistatin treatment downregulated the expression of two later stage markers 
of osteogenesis, osteonectin (ONN) and OPN (Supplementary Figure 6). 
These data support the hypothesis that 3D osteogenesis via nanovibrational 
stimulation is a mechanotransductive process that involves intracellular tension, with 
mechanoreceptors, such as Piezo, TRP and KCNK, being involved in this process. 
However, we note that our results are not as dramatic, in terms of response to 
cytoskeletal inhibition, as seen in in 2D osteogenesis studies19, 20, 26. 
 
Nanovibrational mechanotransductive signalling. 
The receptor that appeared most mechanoresponsive to nanostimulation at this 
timepoint (day 5) was TRPV1. It has been proposed that TRPV channels influence 
osteogenesis through the -catenin (Wnt pathway) activation of RUNX250, 51. In this 
pathway, ion influx through the TRPV channels causes the activation of protein kinase 
C (PKC) and of ERK, mediating -catenin activity50, 51.  
To investigate the effects of nanovibrations on signalling processes in MSCs, we used 
metabolomic analysis to predict canonical signalling events as this approach provides 
an instant picture of phenotypic modulation. Principle component analysis showed 
that 3D nanovibrated MSCs and control MSCs, had different metabolomes indicative 
of different phenotypes (Supplementary Figure 7a). As expected during active 
differentiation, energy based pathways52 were upregulated in nanostimulated MSCs, 
including lipid (Supplementary Figure 8) and carbohydrate (Supplementary Figure 9) 
metabolic pathways, with lipids representing the largest group. Ingenuity pathway 
analysis (IPA) fits metabolite input data to the literature in order to be able to predict 
biochemical interactions. It was used here to build networks related to lipid 
metabolism, that were merged and linked to canonical signalling pathways related to 
adhesion, cytoskeletal tension, ERK 1/2 signalling, BMP2 signalling and calcium/Wnt 
signalling19, 20, 26 (Supplementary Figure 7b).  
To investigate if TRPV plays a role in the osteogenic process, western blot 
densitometry was used to measure key members of these pathways after control and 
  
12 
nanovibrational culture. Specifically, pFAK, pMyosin, pERK, pSMAD1/5/8 and active -
catenin, with and without inhibition of PKC with enzastaurin, were considered. Only 
-catenin was affected, becoming down-regulated as PKC was inhibited and the 
normal functioning of TRPV channels was indirectly blocked (Figure 5a – no effect of 
PKC inhibition was seen in 3D MSCs treated with OSM, Supplementary Figure 10).  
We next investigated the effect of channel inhibitors on nanostimulated MSCs in 3D 
by measuring total ERK 1/2 and total -catenin levels in the presence and absence of 
PKC and TRPV channel inhibition. MSCs in 3D underwent nanostimulation (1000 Hz), 
nanostimulation with PKC inhibition (1000 Hz-PKC), and nanostimulation with TRPV 
inhibition (1000 Hz-TRPV); protein levels were assayed after 48 hours of stimulation 
(Supplementary Figure 11). At the same time, a metabolomics/IPA analysis was 
performed to investigate signalling networks linked to the -catenin/Wnt pathways. 
Western blot analysis showed that nanostimulated MSCs treated with PKC and TRPV 
inhibitors downregulated the expression of ERK 1/2 and -catenin but that only -
catenin was significantly down-regulated in the presence of both inhibitors (Figure 
5b). The metabolomics analyses indicated that the Wnt/-catenin pathway was 
upregulated following nanostimulation (Figure 6a), but was moderately down-
regulated in the 1000 Hz-PKC MSCs (Figure 6b) and largely suppressed in the 1000 Hz-
TRPV cells (Figure 6c) (see Supplementary Figures 12-14 for more complete networks). 
The metabolomics analysis also inferred that ERK signalling is downregulated in the 
1000 Hz-PKC and 1000 Hz-TRPV MSCs (Figure 6a-c), which is in agreement with the 
western blot data which show that total ERK protein levels are reduced (Figure 5b). 
Together, these findings lead us to propose that TRPV1 activity contributes to Wnt-
mediated osteogenesis in nanovibrated MSCs in 3D. Potential mechanisms are shown 
in Figure 6d with the TRPV/-catenin pathway highlighted in bold. 
To test if inhibition of PKC and TRPV have direct effects on osteogenesis in 3D culture, 
nanovibrational stimulation time was extended out to 5 days to allow for some 
phenotypical development and the cultures were inhibited for PKC or TRPV for the 
final 24 hours. QPCR was used to test transcript level changes; we looked at BMPR1a 
and BMP2 as very early markers, RUNX2 as an early marker and ALP and osteonectin 
  
13 
as mid-stage osteogenic markers. For PKC inhibition, downregulation of BMP2 was 
observed indicating a phenotypical response (Figure 7). However, with TRPV 
inhibition, significant downregulation of BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and osteonectin was 
observed showing an immediate and dramatic effect on progression of the osteogenic 
phenotype. This data supports that TRPV channels are important to osteogenesis and 
that PKC may also have effect (but indicating that it might not be an exclusive effect), 
helping build the hypothesis presented in Figure 6d. 
We have presented a new class of bioreactor and showed that 3D osteogenesis can 
be produced without the use of chemicals and/or growth factors, or of bioactive 
scaffolds, sophisticated culture ware, or dedicated incubators. The use of collagen in 
this study provided mechanical integration with the 6-well plate because it attaches 
to the dish sides. This allowed us to take advantage of its excellent mass-transfer 
properties, which also permit large volumes to be used, avoiding the need to use 
dense osteogenic scaffolds, such as calcium phosphates and other bioactive ceramics, 
which have certain disadvantage and limitations. In fact, on a single bioreactor with 5 
ml of gel fill per well, 60 ml of mineralising osteoblasts in an appropriate 3D matrix 
can be generated from MSCs. 
 
Summary. 
In addition to the potential volumes of graft material that could be produced using 
this bioreactor, it also fits well into a good-manufacturing-practice (GMP) workflow. 
GMP-grade collagen, media and culture plates exist and have been used in human 
trials53. In this approach, the nanovibrational bioreactor remains external to these 
components as it does not come into contact with cell-therapy products. This prevents 
the need to, for example, meet FDA regulation for new scaffolds or induction 
chemicals. 
We propose that, because of the soft 3D nature of the collagen matrix used in our 
approach, the magnitudes of the roles for adhesion and cytoskeletal tension were 
lower than those observed in 2D studies19, 20, 26. We also suggest an increased role for 
  
14 
mechanoresponsive channels, which we believe stimulate enhanced osteogenesis 
through the activation of -catenin signalling.

Materials & Methods 
Vibration apparatus. The bioreactor surface area was designed to hold two 6-well 
plates (Corning, NY) simultaneously with dimensions of 130 × 178 mm. The piezo 
actuators used (PL088.30, Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany) were low profile 
actuators with a large attachment area. The top plate of the platform utilised magnetic 
attachment to secure the 6-well plates. Standard 30 mm diameter, 3 mm thickness 
Fe2O3 ferrite magnets (Magnet Expert, Tuxford, UK) were bonded to the tissue culture 
plates. The quoted magnetic flux at the surface of these magnets is 700 gauss (0.07 T) 
which as a static magnetic field is not thought to be high enough to alter cellular 
function. However, these magnets, being halbach arrays, are only magnetic on the 
side facing the bioreactor and away from the cell culture therefore any stray magnetic 
fields will be far smaller.  
  
15 
To power the piezo array, a high voltage piezo driver (Model ENV 150, Piezosystem 
Jena, Jena, Germany) was used which is capable of providing  160 Vpk-pk. The sine wave 
modulation of the amplifier output was provided by a signal generator (Model 
33210A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). 
 
Finite element modelling (ANSYS). Simulated models of a Corning 6-well plate, the 
bioreactor top plate and the collagen gel were developed in ANSYS finite element 
software (ANSYS, Canonsburg, PA). Models were developed in ANSYS Workbench 
v14.0 with analysis involving use of the Harmonic Response package to provide values 
for deformation at user defined frequencies.  
The culture plate component was modelled as a polystyrene plate bonded to six ferrite 
magnets via a 0.2 mm layer of epoxy. A similar method was used to model the top 
plate with materials bonded with a 0.1 mm epoxy bond. Epoxy bonds were also added 
at the attachment points of the piezo actuators. For this analysis, vibration 
frequencies of 0 to 10,000 Hz, with 30 nm amplitude, were applied to the models to 
compare amplitude consistency. Throughout all the analysis, mesh relevance was set 
at 0 giving a medium mesh density. 
For studies of the collagen gel, the model incorporated the polystyrene culture ware 
(one well of a 6-well plate, and bonding to the vibration source through a 0.1 mm 
epoxy layer. Harmonic response analysis was used to study the frequency dependant 
effects of deformation of the gel construct including meniscus curvature at the edge 
(modelled using the linear shear moduli and assumption of incompressibility) along 
with estimates of the levels of shear stress within the construct. Vibration condition 
was set to 1000 Hz, 20 nm, to model the frequency used in experiment. Harmonic 
response analysis is strictly linear so accuracy would be limited to the linear elastic 
range of the material. However, the modelled values for shear stress fall within the 
linear elastic range measured through rheology suggesting this is an accurate 
modelling assumption for nanoscale vibration. Mesh sizing was set to coarse to reduce 
computational time. Connections between the gel and the culture ware were set to 
bonded (assuming that the gel adheres to the culture ware) and used multi point 
constraints (MPC) to ensure that the mesh was constrained to the container. The 
additional impact of gravity was incorporated through an inertial acceleration of 9.81 
ms-1. 
Interferometric measurement. Assessment of vibration amplitude was carried out 
using laser interferometry. A USB interferometer (Model SP-S, SIOS Meßtechnik 
GmbH, Ilmenau, Germany) was mounted on a frame with the laser aimed downwards 
at the measurement site. In the case of the rigid culture surface, silicon fragments 
were bonded at measurement sites to reflect the laser and for collagen 
measurements, 50 μm thickness silicon fragments were used to minimise any effect 
from the weight of the fragment. The interference condition of the reflected light is 
processed and passed to INFAS analysis software where a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 
produces a frequency spectrum for displacement. This model of interferometer is 
sensitive to displacements of 0.1 nm however at low frequencies the limitations of the 
system are actually due to background motion. For each measurement, a value for 
background noise at that frequency was recorded. To partially reduce the effect of 
  
16 
this noise the interferometric apparatus was sat on a rubber mat to provide a partial 
noise dampening.  
Rheology. Assessment of the physio-elastic properties of the collagen matrix was 
performed by carrying out dynamic frequency sweep experimentation. These 
frequency sweeps were performed by using a strain-controlled rheometer (Kinexus 
rotational rheometer system, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The parallel-plate 
used to perform the frequency sweep had a 20 mm diameter with a 0.25 mm gap. An 
integrated thermostat mechanism was used to maintain the sample temperature at 
25°C. In order to keep the sample hydrated and prevent drying out through 
evaporation the internal atmosphere was kept saturated through the use of a solvent 
trap.  An amplitude sweep was carried out and this confirmed no variation in elastic 
modulus (G’) and viscous modulus (G”). The amplitude sweep was performed up to a 
strain of 1% and these measurements were taken in a linear viscoelastic regime. The 
collagen matrix dynamic shear modulus was measured as a frequency function with a 
frequency range from 1 to 100 Hz. To ensure reproducibility all measurements per 
sample were performed in triplicates. 
Characterisation of collagen matrices by AFM. The fibrillar conformation of type I 
collagen gel matrices was assessed via AFM in AC mode (Nanowizard 3 Bioscience 
AFM, JPK Instruments AG, Berlin, Germany). Collagen gel (2 mg/ml) was gently dried 
with a nitrogen flow before evaluation in the AFM working in air. A pyramidal silicon 
nitride tip, with a cantilever spring constant of ∼3 N/m and a resonance frequency of 
75 kHz (MPP-21120, Bruker), was used to scan the collagen matrix. Height and phase 
images were simultaneously recorded. The influence of cell seeding density in the 
local mechanical properties of the collagen gel matrices was evaluated via force 
spectroscopy. Silicon tipless cantilevers (Arrow TL1, Nanoworld) functionalised with 
20 µm silicon beads were used to perform the measurements. Force-distance curves 
were obtained, after calibration of tip sensitivity and spring constant, with a set-point 
of 10 nN, a zeta length of 10 μm, a constant duration of 1 s, and at room temperature 
in liquid environment. Analysis was performed using the JPK processing software 
(v4.3.21), and force curves were fitted with a Hertz model. 
Cell Culture and collagen gel sample preparation. Primary bone marrow MSCs were 
sourced (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) and MG63s were taken from a cell line 
(ATCC, Manassas, USA). For critical experiments, cells from more than one donor were 
used and this is indicated in the figure legends and in Supplementary Table 5. We 
further note that over this study, MSCs from more than 20 donors were used. Cell 
concentration was typically 40,000 cells/ml (or 100,000 cells per 2.5ml collagen gel). 
Expanded MSCs were used at passages 1-3. The basal media that was used to maintain 
both cell types during experiments and for proliferation was DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 1% sodium pyruvate (11 mg/ml, 
Sigma), 1% Gibco MEM NEAA (amino acids, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) 
and 2% antibiotics (6.74 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 0.2 µg/mL fungizone). Before 
use, cells were trypsinised and counted with a haemocytometer. MSCs were 
homogeneously seeded within a collagen matrix a population of 4 × 104 cells/ml of gel. 
  
17 
All cell culture was performed in an incubator at 37oC with 5% CO2. The basal culture 
media was removed and replenished every 2-3 days. For the osteospecific media 
positive control samples the DMEM basal media was also substituted with 100 µMol 
ascorbic acid and 50 nMol dexamethasone (Sigma) (OSM). The collagen matrix was 
prepared by addition of 10x modified eagle’s media (Sigma), FBS, basal media with the 
appropriate number of cells and 2.05 mg/mL rat tail Type I collagen (First Link UK, 
Wolverhampton, UK) in 0.16% acetic acid. The solution was homogeneously mixed by 
pipetting. Following this 0.1 M NaOH was added while on ice, until a permanent 
pink/red colour change (phenol red indicator) was observed, to form a gel. The 
samples were then quickly placed in a 37°C incubator avoiding agitation. 
 
Alamar blue assay. 4 × 104 MSCs/ml of gel (2.5 ml) were stimulated at 1000 Hz. The 
Alamar blue assay was performed after 1 and 2 weeks of stimulation and compared 
to non-stimulated controls. Cultured media was removed and hydrogels were washed 
3x in warm 1xPBS. 10% (v/v) of AlamarBlue® resazurin (Bio-Rad, Watford, UK) diluted 
in phenol-red free media (D5030, Sigma) was added to each hydrogel. After further 
incubation for five hours at 37°C, 5% CO2, the culture supernatant was transferred into 
96 well plates to measure the up-taken Alamar blue indicating cell metabolism. A 
microplate reader (Clariostar, BMG Labtech, Germany) was used to detect light 
absorbance at wavelengths of 570 nm and 600 nm. The percentage of Alamar blue 
reduction was calculated as following; 
 
                                                           (O2 x A1) - (O1 x A2)

O 1 = molar extinction coefficient of oxidized Alamar blue at wavelength 570 nm. 
O 2 = molar extinction coefficient of oxidized Alamar blue at wavelength 600 nm.

Live-dead staining. 4×104 MCSs/ml of gel (2.5 ml) were seeded in each well of a 6 well 
plate for stimulated and control groups. MSCs were nanovibrated at 1,000 Hz for 2 
weeks. Upon completion, the culture medium was removed and the samples were 
washed 3x in warm 1xPBS. 4 mM of calcein AM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) and 
2mM of ethidium homodimer-1 (Life Technologies) diluted 1:1000 in phenol-red free 
media (D5030, Sigma) was added in each well. The samples were then re-incubated at 
37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 hours. 10x magnification microscopic images were taken (Olympus, 
Pennsylvania, US) operated on Surveyor software version 9.0.1.4 (Objective Imaging, 
Cambridge, UK). FITC/TRITC channel images were stitched and processed using ImageJ 
(Version 1.50g, National Institutes of Health, USA) and Photoshop CS4 (version 11 
extended, Adobe, Ireland).

Cytoskeletal inhibition in 3D. MSCs were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/ml of gel (2.5 ml) in 
stimulated and control culture for 5 days in the presence or absence of inhibitors of 
ROCK (Y27632, Sigma) at 10uM and myosin II (blebbistatin, Sigma cat: B0560) 50mM. 
Inhibitors were added fresh with all medium changes for the duration of the 
experiment. 
 
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel inhibition in 2D. 1x104 MSC cells/well 
were cultured in 24 well plates for 1 hour with 10% serum for cell attachment and 
followed by serum starvation (1% serum) for 24 hours to synchronise the cells in G0. 
After synchronising, fresh basal media was added to cells to start the cell cycle and 
nanovibration stimulation was simultaneously applied for 23 hours (no stimulation in 
the control samples) before addition of inhibitors (GsMTX4 (for Piezo1, 4µM Tocris 
Bioscience cat: 4912,) and QX314 (Sigma cat: L1663) for TRPV1, 1% (v/v) of a 50 mg/ml 
stock) for the last 1 hour (24 hours total).  
 
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel inhibition in 3D. Serum starved MSCs 
seeded at 4×104 cells/ml of gel (2.5 ml) in stimulated and control cultures were 
cultured for 2 or 5 days in basal medium. For the last 24 hours QX314 (Sigma cat: 
L1663) was added at 8-hour intervals at 1% (v/v) of a 50 mg/ml stock) concentration. 
Samples were then processed for either protein or gene expression according to the 
methods provided. 
 
PCK inhibition in 3D. Method 1 for 5 day culture: MSCs seeded at 4×104 cells/ml of gel 
(2.5 ml) in stimulated and control 6 well plates for 5 days in the presence of 
enzastaurin (Tocris Bioscience cat: 5994), a PKC inhibitor. The inhibitor was used at 
1µM concentration for the duration of the experiment. Method 2 for 2 or 5 day culture 
alongside TRPV inhibition: serum starved MSCs seeded at 4×104 cells/ml of gel (2.5 ml) 
in stimulated and control conditions were cultured for 2 or 5 days in basal medium. 
For the last 24 hours enzastaurin was added at 8-hour intervals at 1µM concentration. 
Samples were then processed for either protein expression, gene expression or 
metabolomics analysis according to the relevant methods. 
 
In-Cell Western Assay. MSCs within the 6 well (3D, 4×104 cells/ml of gel) or 24 well 
plates (1x104 cells) were fixed using 10% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were then 
permealized and blocked using 0.5% milk protein in 1xPBS-0.1%Tween20 (v/v) (PBST). 
All antibodies were diluted in 0.5% milk protein in PBST. GAPDH and CellTag 700 stain 
(Li-COR, cat: 926-41090, Lincoln, USA) were used as the reference controls. CellTag or 
rabbit anti-GAPDH primary antibody was diluted at 1:2000.  Primary antibodies for 
target proteins ALP (Abcam, cat: ab354, Cambridge, UK), OCN and OPN (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Cat:Sc-21742, Dallas, USA), phosphoERK (Cell signaling, Cat:4797s) and 
total ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat:4696s, Danvers, USA) were then prepared in 
a dilution of 1:200. The primary antibody incubation was carried out at 37ºC for 2.5 
hours, following 5 washes in PBS/0.1% Tween. The washes were carried out with 
agitation for 5 minutes. For CellTag as reference control, the Li-COR secondary 
antibodies (anti-rabbit, cat: 926-32211; anti-mouse, cat: 926-32210) were used at a 
dilution of 1:2000. For GAPDH as reference control, the secondary antibody was 
  
19 
diluted at a dilution of 1:5000 with a 680 nm infrared dye and GAPDH secondary 
antibody (donkey anti-rabbit) also had a dilution of 1:5000 with an 800 nm infrared 
dye. The secondary antibodies were incubated at ambient room temperature on a 
shaker for 1.5 hour, followed by 5x5min washes in PBS/0.2% Tween. The quantitative 
spectroscopic analysis was carried out using the LI-COR Odyssey Sa and all dyes and 
secondary antibodies were sourced from LI-COR corporation. 
 
Quantitative Reverse Transcription polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Following the 
required period of stimulation (3, 5, 7, 14, 21 days) within the bioreactor, the MSCs in 
collagen gels were assessed by qRT-PCR. Nanovibrated and control samples were 
extracted at the same time. The collagen matrix samples were removed from the 6 
well plates and placed in a 15ml Falcon tube. Equal volumes of Trizol reagent (Life 
Technologies) was added to each sample, which were then vortexed and 
homogenised using a syringe with 20-G needles. 0.2ml of chloroform (Sigma) was 
added per ml of Trizol to each sample, mixed and centrifuged in order to separate the 
aqueous and organic phases. The aqueous phase was removed and the total RNA 
content was then extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit (including a DNAse 
step) according to the manufacturers instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA 
concentration was quantified using Nanodrop, and normalized for each sample.  cDNA 
was prepared by reverse transcription using the Qiagen Quantitect kit. 12 µL of the 
normalised dilutions for each RNA sample were added to a 0.2 mL (200 µL) reverse 
transcription PCR – Cup. To each of the samples 2 µL gDNA wipeout buffer was added. 
Following this each sample was run at 42ºC for 2 mins, on a thermal Cycler (PCR) 
system in order to remove any DNA present in the samples. Following the removal of 
the innate DNA, 6 µL of a stock solution (containing Qiagen reverse transcription 
buffer reagents) was then added to each reverse transcription cup, to give a total 
volume of 20 µL. The second program (Supplementary Table 3) was then initiated to 
reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA which was subsequently used to perform PCR 
quantification using the relative comparable method. The Quantifast SYBR green qPCR 
kit (Qiagen) was used to perform amplification with specific primers (Eurofins 
Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) related to osteogenesis as well as GAPDH, ACTIN and 
18s which were used as a genetic internal controls, listed in (Supplementary Table 4). 
PCR was quantified using the 2-∆∆Ct method and amplification was carried out using an 
Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system. Unstimulated samples also cultured 
in a 3D collagen matrix (samples not nanovibrated) were used as negative controls for 
comparison of osteogenic transcription expression. 
 
Western blotting. Following the required period of stimulation within the bioreactor 
(2 or 5 days experiments) MSC protein expression was assessed (4 replicas per patient 
sample was pooled together for loading on to gels) at a density 4 × 104 cells/ml of gel 
(2.5 ml). MSCs were extracted from the collagen gels using collagenase D (Roche, UK) 
at 2.5 mg/ml. The gels were incubated in the collagenase solution for 90min at 37oC, 
transferred in a universal tube and cells pelleted at 1400rpm for 4min. The cells pellets 
were lysed directly by using protein lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% v/v Triton X-100) containing phosphatase and protease 
inhibitors (complete ULTRA Tablets, Mini, EASYpack no. 05892970001, and PhosSTOP 
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets no. 04906845001, Roche). Protein 
  
20 
concentration was determined using the Nanodrop. Protein samples were run on a 
pre-cast NOVEX gradient (4-12%) gel system (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher) and the 
samples were then transferred onto nylon membrane (Imobilon F, Millipore suitable 
for use with the Li-COR Odyssey system) according to manufacturer’s protocol. For 
probing, the blots were incubated in 5% BSA TBS 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 with the 
appropriate anti-sera dilution. Antibodies (1:1000 dilution in 5% BSA/0.1% TBST) used 
were directed to: phosphoERK (Cell Signaling, Cat:4797s) and total ERK (Cell Signaling, 
Cat:4696s), p-myosin (Cell Signaling, phospho Ser 19, no. 3675), total myosin (Cell 
Signaling, cat:3672s), beta catenin (anti-active β-catenin, clone 8E7, cat:05-665 and 
anti-β-catenin, clone7F7.2, cat:04-958, Millipore, Billerica, USA), phospho SMAD1/5/8 
(S463/465, Cell Signaling,cat:6944s) and total SMADD1 (Cell Signaling), pFAK (Y925) 
(Cell signaling, cat:3284P) and total FAK (MBL Life Sciences, cat:D061-3, Aichi, Japan), 
and total TRPV1 (Abcam, cat:ab111973) were then prepared in a dilution of 1:200. The 
primary antibody incubation was carried out at 4oC overnight for the phosphorylated 
proteins and at room temperature for 1-2 hours for the total proteins, followed by 
3x5min washes in 0.1% TBST on a shaker. For the Li-COR secondary antibodies (anti-
rabbit, cat: 926-32211; anti-mouse, cat: 926-32210) were used at a dilution of 1:8000. 
The secondary antibodies were incubated at ambient room temperature on a shaker 
for 1hour, following 3 washes in 0.1% TBST, again with agitation for 5 minutes. Total 
protein was measured using the Revert total protein stain (Li-COR) solution and used 
as loading control to normalize the samples where necessary. The quantitative 
spectroscopic analysis was carried out using the LI-COR Odyssey Sa and all dyes and 
secondary antibodies were sourced from LI-COR corporate. 
 
Raman Spectroscopy. The 3D collagen gel matrix samples were nanovibrated for 46 
days, were partially dried and were directly assessed by Raman spectroscopy without 
further sample preparation. 4×104 MSCs/ml of gel (2.5 ml) were seeded in each well. 
A Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer with a 785 nm line focus laser was used to 
perform near IR spectroscopic scans. A reference standard of bovine cortical compact 
bone was used to assess the predominant finger print region spectrum for perfectly 
mineralised bone, and it was determined that 960 cm-1 and 1170 cm-1 were the 
predominant scattering wavenumbers. A light microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) 
x20 magnification was used to determine regions of interest and mineral deposition 
for assessment.  
Von Kossa Staining. Nanovibrated 3D collagen matrix samples were stimulated for 4 
or 6 weeks and were then fixed using 10% formaldehyde at 37ºC for 30 minutes. Each 
well was seeded with approximately 4×104 cells/ml of gel (2.5 ml). The matrix samples 
were then submerged in 5 % silver nitrate and exposed to UV lamp for approximately 
30 minutes. The samples were washed 5 times in deionized water and were then 
submerged in 5% sodium thiosulphate for 10 minutes so as to remove any excess silver 
nitrate.  The samples were rinsed 5 times with agitation in deionized water, followed 
by 70% ethanol/30% water. The samples were then imaged without further 
preparation and the staining intensities were quantified using image J. 
 
Micro-CT (µCT) Analysis. MSCs were nanovibrated in 3D at 1000 Hz in a collagen gel 
extracellular matrix for 35 days the samples were fixed using 10% formaldehyde and 
  
21 
transferred into PBS and subsequently imaged using µCT. The scans were then 
compared against unstimulated controls. For this experiment, each well (of the 6 well 
plate) was seeded with 750,000 cells per 2.5 ml gel. In order to image the samples all 
the gels for both the test sample (stimulated at 1000 Hz) and controls were combined 
together in a separate cryo tube manufactured by Nunc A/S, with an internal diameter 
of 9.8 mm (± 0.1 mm). Within the cryo tube the polystyrene saturated with PBS was 
used to secure the gels in place. This ensured that the samples were unable to move 
during scanning. Polystyrene was utilized as it is radiolucent and allowed the gels to 
be imaged unobstructed. The µCT system which was used was a Skyscan 1172 
(Orthopaedic engineering department, University of Edinburgh S/N=08F01110). The 
data was reconstructed using Skyscan reconstruction software and scanning was 
performed with a 360° rotation (resolution /pixel size = 2.9278 µm, Source Voltage = 
58 kV, Source Current = 171 µA, Exposure = 1178 ms). 
 
Metabolomics. MSCs were stimulated in 3D collagen gels (2mg/ml) at a density of 
4×104 cells/ml of gel (2.5 ml) for 5 days or 2 days for the transient ion channel and PKC 
inhibition studies. Non-stimulated samples were used as controls. The metabolites 
were extracted using a 1:3:1 chloroform/methanol/water extraction buffer and 
placed on a shaking platform for 1 h at 4°C. The sample supernatant was transferred 
into 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000g at 4°C. The samples were used 
for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry analysis 
(UltiMate 3000 RSLC, Thermo Fisher, with a 150 x 4.6 mm ZIC-pHILIC column running 
at 300 uL/min and Orbitrap Exactive, Thermo Fisher, respectively). After Nanodrop 
(Thermo Fisher) measurement, total protein content was found identical in all 
samples, thus no further standardization was necessary. A standard pipeline, 
consisting of XCMS54 (peak picking), MzMatch55 (filtering and grouping), and IDEOM56 
(further filtering, post‐processing and identification) was used to process the raw mass 
spectrometry data. Identified core metabolites were validated against a panel of 
unambiguous standards by mass and retention time. Further putative identifications 
were allotted by mass and predicted retention time57. Means and standard errors of 
the mean were generated for every group of picked peaks and the resulting 
metabolomics data were uploaded to Ingenuity pathway analysis software for 
metabolite pathway analysis. 
 
Statistics. Unless stated, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis with Dunn’s post-test 
was used to compare significance in qPCR, in cell western and Von Kossa stain 
experiments. Two tailed, unpaired U-Tests (Mann Whitney) were performed where a 
direct comparison was assessed between only two population groups. A sample 
population of between 3 and 6 replicates were always used. All results are quoted as 
mean ± standard deviation and the probability values have been quoted to an 
accuracy of 95%, 99% and 99.9% (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p ≤ 0.001 respectively).  
Supplementary Table 5 indicates samples numbers and replicates used in each figure 
presented.

Figure 1. Development of the nanovibrational bioreactor. (a) The nanovibrational 
bioreactor consists of a piezo-driven vibrational plate set on top of a heavy base block 
  
25 
to direct vibration upwards. Culture ware is magnetically attached to the top plate and 
vibrated at the nanoscale according to the input voltage signal. (b) ANSYS finite 
element modelling of the bioreactor top plate and a magnetic culture plate. Harmonic 
response analysis shows the amplitude response when both are vibrated (30 nm, 1000 
Hz), showing a high level of consistency is to be expected across the cell growth 
surface. (c) ANSYS harmonic response modelling of the growth surface of a 6-well plate 
in the range of 0 to 10,000 Hz (30 nm amplitude). Response of the growth surface 
follows the input vibration reliably until reaching 3000 Hz (insert shows 1000 Hz). 
Above this frequency, resonances cause large amplification and deformations at the 
growth surface shown by the minimum and maximum amplitudes taken from the 
modelled surface. (d) Laser interferometric testing of the bioreactor top plate and 
growth substrate. Mirrored pieces of silicon are bonded to the measurement point on 
the top plate or placed atop the growth surface to reflect a laser beam. This allows the 
vibration amplitude to be measured to sub-nm resolution. (e) Interferometric 
calibration of the bioreactor for five frequencies. Vibration amplitude is linearly 
dependant on the input voltage (peak to peak) of the bioreactor (actuators wired in 
series). Divergence occurs at 4000 Hz due to resonant amplification, as predicted by 
the Ansys model (shown in (c)). (f)  MSCs were stimulated (1000Hz) on the vibrational 
bioreactor for 7 days and their mRNA levels then measured by qPCR. Osterix mRNA 
levels were significantly up-regulated compared to non-vibrated controls. Donors 
(d)=3, replicates per donor (r)= 4, technical replicates per replicate (t) = 2; results = 
meanSD, stats by Mann Whitney U-test where ***p<0.001. (g) In-cell western 
analysis of MSCs after 2 and 3 weeks of nanovibrational stimulation compared to 
control MSCs and osteoblasts cultured for similar times. Results show that both 
nanovibrated cells and osteoblasts had an enhanced osteoblast phenotype compared 
to untreated MSCs by measurement of ALP and OPN. D=1, r=3, results = meanSD, 
stats for treatment compared to control by ANOVA and Tukey test where *p<0.05 and 
***p<0.001 (dots represent individual data points). (h) In-cell western of pERK1/2 / 
total ERK1/2 in cells released from synchronisation (1 hour seeding in 10% serum and 
serum withdrawal for 24 hours). After reintroduction of 10% serum and 
commencement of nanovibrational stimulation (1000 Hz) (with control cells receiving 
no stimulation) for 23 hours, inhibitors of channels Piezo1 (GsMTx4) and TRPV1 
  
26 
(QX314) were added for 1 hour. pERK 1/2 levels were reduced only in MSCs undergoing 
nanovibrational stimulation when either channel was blocked. D=3, r=4, results = 
meanSD, stats by ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test where **p<0.01 and***p<0.001.  
 
Figure 2. Characterization of 3D-collagen gel culture on the vibrational bioreactor. 
(a) Rheological assessment of the collagen gel without MSCs. Comparison of complex 
shear moduli values show that a soft gel has been formed rather than a liquid state 
(i.e. Gʹ˃Gʹʹ). Conversion yields an elastic modulus equalling ~ 108 Pa. (b) Similar results 
were obtained for collagen gel that contains 100,000 MSCs. These samples yield an 
elastic modulus equalling ~ 74 Pa. (c) Stress-strain curve for the collagen gel constructs. 
For low values of shear deformation or shear stress, the material responds linearly. (d) 
ANSYS deformation modelling of a modelled polystyrene well, replicating one well of 
a 6-well plate whilst being vibrated (1000 Hz, 20 nm). The polystyrene shows consistent 
replication of vibration amplitude with minor edge reduction of less than 10%. (e) 
Mapping deformation of a vibrated gel (1000 Hz, 20 nm) within a modelled polystyrene 
well. The average vibration amplitude was consistent with the driving vibration when 
modelled as incompressible although on average slightly increased amplitudes were 
seen at the edge where a meniscus was present, replicating interferometric results. (f) 
Mapping shear stress during vibration at 1000 Hz, 20 nm amplitude. When compared 
with experimental values in (c), low levels of shear stress indicate that the gel should 
respond as a linear elastic material when vibrated under these conditions (1000 Hz, 20 
nm). (g) Picture of the apparatus, including 2.5 ml samples of collagen gel, whilst being 
tested using laser interferometry. Silicon fragments of 50 µm thickness were placed on 
the surface of the gel to measure transmission of the underlying vibration amplitude. 
Measurements were taken both at the centre of each well and at the edge where a 
meniscus was present. (h) Interferometric calibration of the gel for five vibration 
frequencies. Vibration amplitude is linearly dependant on the input voltage (peak to 
peak) of the bioreactor. (i) Graph showing the nanometre displacement measurements 
in the range of 500 to 5000 Hz with a set voltage of 12 Vpk-pk. Data is shown for the 
centre and outer edge of each well whilst being either empty, filled with 2.5ml collagen 
gel, or with 2.5ml collagen gel seeded with ~ 100,000 MSCs. Resonant peaks can be 
  
27 
seen at frequencies of 2500, 3500 and 5000 Hz with gel vibration consistently following 
the underlying substrate below 2000 Hz. The inset shows the specific variances, 
including increased edge amplitude (dashed lines), at the experimental frequency of 
1000 Hz, replicating the modelled results in (d) and (e). Interferometric results show 
mean values ±SD (n=3).

stimulation. (a) Time course qPCR analysis of BMP2, RUNX2, ALP, OPN, OCN and 
collagen I transcripts, showing significantly higher expression in 3D nanovibrated MSCs 
compared to control 3D cultures at the same time point. Donors (d)=1, replicates per 
donor (r)= 6, technical replicates per replicate (t) = 2; results = meanSD, stats by Mann 
Whitney U-test where *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001. Values are log scale. (b) 
Von Kossa staining and quantification. Staining performed after 6 weeks of 
nanovibrations at 1000 Hz in 3D. Gels shown (on left) were removed from a 6-well 
plate before processing. The intensity of von Kossa staining was measured against 
unstimulated controls and osteospecific media (OSM).  A significantly increased level 
of staining was observed for the nanostimulated samples relative to the unstimulated 
controls after 4 weeks (d=3 (d=1 for OSM), r=4), and for nanostimulated samples and 
OSM-treated cells after 6 weeks (d=1, r=5). Results are mean±SD where *p<0.05, ** 
p<0.01 and ***p<0.001 by ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test (individual data points are 
shown as dots). (c) Raman spectra for bovine cortical compact bone, this profile was 
used as a reference standard to characterise the Raman scattering (fingerprint 
identification region 500 cm-1 – 1500 cm-1) pattern of bone. Predominant peaks 
observed at ~ 960 cm-1 (arrow) and ~ 1072 cm-1 (arrowhead) correspond to PO43- v1 
and CO32- bond stretching, respectively. (d) For the control sample, MSCs were cultured 
in a collagen gel for 46 days. Raman spectroscopy showed no phosphate peak present. 
(f) MSCs nanovibrated for 46 days at 1000 Hz in a collagen matrix. Raman spectroscopy 
showed peaks matching the main peaks of the cortical bone sample. D=1, r=3, Scale 
bar = 50 µm. (e) MSCs cultured for 35 days in a collagen matrix and imaged by µCT 
showing no bone deposits. (g) MSCs nanovibrated at 1000 Hz for 35 days in a collagen 
matrix and imaged by µCT showing mineral deposits (arrow). Scale bar = 200 µm. MSCs 
  
28 
were seeded at 40,000 cells/ml; for the µCT analysis, a higher cell concentration, 
300,000 cells/ml, was used.

5, 7, 14 and 21 days of 3D nanovibrational stimulation compared to control cultures. 
A biphasic trend of high to low expression, recovery, and high to low expression was 
noted with significant downregulation of all the receptor transcripts seen at day 21. 
Donors (d)=1, replicates per donor (r)= 6 (3 for days 3 and 5), technical replicates per

ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) or the myosin II inhibitor (blebbistatin). Cytoskeletal tension 
dependencies were noted for Piezo 2 (c) and TRPV1 (e), with increased significance 
noted when osteogenesis was stimulated by nanovibration compared to stimulation 
by OSM. D=3, r=4, t=2; results = meanSEM, stats by ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis test 
where *p<0.05 and **p<0.01. Values are log scale. (f-h) qPCR analysis of BMPR1a (f),

stimulated control. Cells were inhibited for the final 24 hours of culture. Data shows 
loss of osteoblastic phenotype progression for PKC inhibition (BMP2) and TRPV 
inhibition (BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and osteonectin (OSN)). Data is mean  SD for donors 
(d) = 3, replicated per donor (r) = 4, technical replicates (t) = 2. Data was shown to be 
normally distributed, stats by Tukey test where *p<0.05 and **p<0.01.
