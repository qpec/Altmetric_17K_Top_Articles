Abstract
Importance—Patients who suffer a fragility fracture are at high risk for subsequent fractures. 
Prescription drugs represent one factor that could be modified to reduce the risk of subsequent 
fracture.
Objective—To describe the use of prescription drugs associated with fracture risk before and 
after fragility fracture.
Design—Retrospective cohort study using a 40% random sample of Medicare claims from 2007–
2011.
Setting—General communities throughout the United States
Participants—168,133 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries who survived a fracture of 
the hip, upper arm or wrist. Cohort members were required to be enrolled in Medicare fee-for-
service with drug coverage (Parts A, B and D) and to be community-dwelling for at least 30 days 
in the immediate 4 month post-fracture period.
Exposure—The 4 month periods before and after a fragility fracture.
Outcome Measures—Prescription fills for drug classes associated with increased fracture risk 
were measured using Part D retail pharmacy claims. These were divided into three categories: 
drugs that increase fall risk; drugs that decrease bone density; and drugs whose primary 
mechanism of increased fracture risk is unclear. Drugs that increase bone density were also 
tracked.

 Results—Most patients were exposed to at least one non-opiate drug associated with increased 
fracture risk in the 4 months before fracture (77.1% of hip, 74.1% of wrist, and 75.9% of upper 
arm fractures). Approximately 7% of these patients discontinued exposure after fracture; however, 
this was offset by new users after fracture. Consequently, the proportion of the cohort exposed 
following fracture was unchanged (80.5%, 74.3%, and 76.9% respectively). There was no change 
in the average number of fracture-associated drugs used. This same pattern of use before and after 
fracture was observed across all three drug mechanism categories. Use of drugs to strengthen bone 
density was uncommon (≤25%) both before and after fracture.
Conclusions and relevance—Exposure to prescription drugs associated with fracture risk is 
infrequently reduced following fragility fracture occurrence. While some patients eliminate their 
exposure to drugs associated with fracture, an equal number initiate new high-risk drugs. This 
pattern suggests there is a missed opportunity to modify at least one factor contributing to 
secondary fractures.
Background
Fragility fractures among the elderly are a source of significant morbidity and mortality and 
are associated with annual direct costs of over 16 billion dollars.1,2 With morbidity, 
mortality and financial burdens of fragility fractures projected to increase as the US 
population ages, there is an urgent need to identify individuals at risk for fracture and to 
promote use of interventions that reduce fracture occurrence.1,3,4 One clearly defined high-
risk population is survivors of a first fragility fracture. Not only are such patients at 
significantly increased risk of experiencing a second fracture, the incidence is highest in the 
first six months after a first fracture, highlighting the importance of identifying modifiable 
risk factors and interventions that can implemented immediately after an index fragility 
fracture.5–13
Prescription drugs represent a potentially modifiable risk factor for a second fragility 
fracture. Over recent years, many studies have linked commonly prescribed drugs to 
increased fracture risk either by increasing the risk of falls, or by lowering bone density.14–32 
Other drugs, primarily bisphosphonates, have been shown to increase bone density and 
decrease the risk of subsequent fractures.16,33–35 Our group and others have previously 
shown that the use of bisphosphonates among fracture survivors is low, arguing that this 
alone is not an effective strategy for secondary fracture prevention.36–39 Meanwhile, Sjoberg 
and colleagues described a very high rate of use of drugs associated with falls both before 
and after fracture among 100 consecutive patients at a single institution in Sweden.40 This 
suggests that prescription drugs associated with increased fracture risk could represent a 
critical risk factor for secondary prevention. The extent to which opportunities exist to 
decrease exposure to fracture-promoting drugs among older Americans has not previously 
been studied. We therefore designed this study to explore the use of drugs associated with 
fracture risk before and after a fracture of the hip, wrist or upper arm to determine 1) the 
prevalence of prescription drug use as a potentially modifiable risk factor for secondary 
fracture prevention among a large cohort of fracture survivors in the United States; and 2) 
whether an index fracture event modifies the prescribing behavior of physicians with respect 
to drugs that either increase or decrease fracture risk.

 Methods
Study cohort
The study cohort consisted of US Medicare beneficiaries who sustained a fracture of the 
proximal femur, humerus or distal radius between the years of 2007–2011. Fractures were 
identified using ICD-9 codes and had to be accompanied by an appropriate surgical 
procedure code (CPT code) in the case of hip fracture, or a code for a radiology examination 
within 7 days of the diagnosis of an upper arm or wrist fracture and indication of 
immobilization or fixation. Complete details of cohort selection and the database used for 
this study have been previously published.41 To be included in the cohort, beneficiaries had 
to be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B for at least 12 months and in Part D for 4 months 
prior to the index fracture and for the duration of follow up. Beneficiaries were also required 
to be community-dwelling at the time of fracture and for at least 30 days within the 4 
months following fracture. This requirement was implemented to ensure that retail pharmacy 
fills would be captured in the database and to focus attention on patients cared for outside of 
the nursing home setting. Patients who were enrolled in hospice, who were discharged to a 
nursing home or rehabilitation facility without returning to the community after fracture, and 
who did not fill at least one prescription drug of any kind during the observation period were 
excluded.
Study period
The date a fracture was first coded in Medicare claims was used as the index date. To ensure 
the index date represented a new fracture, we examined the prior 12 months of claims for 
codes identifying a previous fracture at the same site. A 120 day lookback window from the 
index date was used to define prescription drug use prior to the fracture. To determine 
prescription drug use after the index fracture, we followed patients from the index date 
forward 120 days. This allowed us to capture any outpatient prescription fills after the index 
fracture, including those with a 3-month supply filled just prior to the fracture.
Prescription drug use
We identified 21 drug classes that have been associated with increased fracture risk in the 
existing literature. These drugs were examined as a single group, and then subdivided into 
those drugs whose mechanism of fracture risk is thought to be due to increased falls, those 
that decrease bone density, and those whose primary mechanism of fracture risk is unclear 
(Table 1). We also analyzed opiate drugs separately to avoid inflating our post-fracture drug 
use measures by including potentially appropriate pain control following a fracture event. 
We also excluded opiate fills in the 7 days prior to a fracture to avoid misclassifying 
exposure for those patients treated for pain associated with the fracture event before the 
fracture was diagnosed. We used retail pharmacy claims from the Part D Prescription Drug 
Event file to identify prescriptions filled by patients in the community setting. Beneficiaries 
were considered exposed prior to fracture if they had at least one fill for a drug on the list of 
fracture-associated drugs in the 120 days prior to the fracture event. Similarly, patients were 
considered exposed after the index fracture if they had at least one prescription fill for a drug 
of interest in the 120 days following the index date. Pre-fracture use of intravenous 
bisphosphonates was assessed using Part B records. Because IV bisphosphonate use was

 uncommon (observed in 2.2% of the cohort prior to fracture) and because pre-fracture use 
automatically determined post-fracture use by virtue of annual dosing in most cases, we 
reported only oral bisphosphonate use in our analyses.
We then identified a subset of drugs which we hypothesized would be most likely to be 
discontinued after a fracture event based on the quality of existing evidence. To select drugs 
associated with fall risk, we used the meta-analysis of Woolcott et al published using data 
available at the time of our study cohort.42 This study identified sedative/hypnotic 
medications, antipsychotics, and antidepressants as the drugs with the strongest association 
with fracture. To this list of three drug classes, we also added drug classes with either 
numerous studies linking them to fracture risk (oral steroids), or at least one high-quality and 
widely-publicized study establishing a link to fracture risk (proton pump inhibitors and 
thiazolidinediones).
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome was the proportion of fracture survivors who were exposed to any 
potentially fracture-promoting drug (excluding opiates) in the 120 days following an index 
fracture event. This was then compared to the proportion exposed prior to the fracture event 
using McNemar’s test, which effectively compares the frequency of those who stop previous 
use of a drug after the index fracture to those that start a drug not previously used prior to 
the index fracture. Similar comparisons were made for each subgroup of fracture promoting 
drugs. The proportions of patients using oral bisphosphonates and other drugs associated 
with increased bone density were also compared. To determine how often the fracture event 
modified physician prescribing behavior, we calculated the proportion of patients who had 
filled a drug of interest prior to fracture but who did not fill after fracture (users who became 
non-users), and the proportion of patients who were non-users prior to the fracture event 
who filled a drug of interest after the fracture event (new starters). These analyses were also 
repeated for drugs that increase bone density. Finally, to ensure our dichotomous outcome 
didn’t misclassify a reduction in the total burden of drug exposure, we used Student’s t-test 
to compare the mean number of fracture promoting drugs used prior to fracture with the 
number used after fracture.
Three sensitivity analyses were then performed. First, we repeated the primary analysis for 
each drug class included in our subset of drugs most strongly supported by existing 
literature. A second sensitivity analysis was then performed excluding patients who were 
discharged to any acute rehabilitation facility (skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation 
facility, or swing bed) prior to returning to the community. The intent was to evaluate the 
potential impact of missing data because medication prescriptions are not captured in 
Medicare Part D data during these stays. A third sensitivity analysis was performed that 
quantified the use of drugs that increase bone density stratified on whether patients used 
drugs that increase the risk of fracture. This analysis was designed to explore whether 
physicians consistently attempt to attenuate the risk of fracture when patients are prescribed 
drugs that increase fracture risk.

 Results
A total of 168,133 patients with a fragility fracture met the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for this study. The demographics, comorbidities, fracture type, and discharge destination 
after fracture are displayed in Table 2. Across all fracture types, the average age was 80.0 
years (SD 7.7 yrs), 84.2% were women, and 91.8% were white. 53.2% of the fracture cohort 
was hospitalized at the time of the index fracture, although this varied significantly 
depending on fracture type (100% of hip fractures, 8.2% of wrist fractures, and 15% of 
upper arm fractures). The frequency of discharge to an institution for rehabilitation 
following hospitalization also varied by fracture type, but the duration of acute rehabilitation 
did not (total mean 28.1 days, SD 19.8).
Use of fracture-promoting drugs prior to fracture
More than three-quarters (76%) of fragility fracture patients were exposed to at least one 
non-opiate drug associated with an increased risk of fracture in the 120 days prior to their 
index event (Table 3). This finding was consistent across all fracture types (77.1% for hip, 
74.1% for wrist, and 75.9% for upper arm). More than half (55.7%) of patients were taking 
at least one drug that increases fall risk prior to the index fracture, while slightly less than 
half (42.2%) were taking at least one drug that decreases bone density. Again, we observed 
very little variation in these values across fracture types.
Use of fracture-promoting drugs after fracture
In the 120 days following a fragility fracture, we observed very similar numbers of patients 
who were exposed to at least one non-opiate drug associated with increased fracture risk 
(80.5% for hip, 74.3% for wrist, and 76.9% of upper arm). This represents a total change in 
the absolute proportion exposed by fracture type of +3.4%, +0.2%, and +1.0%respectively. 
As Table 3 shows, there were similarly small changes in the proportion exposed to drugs that 
increase fall risk and drugs that decrease bone density across all fracture types. Our 
sensitivity analysis limited to only those patients who returned directly to the community 
after the index fracture revealed very similar results (eTable 2).
When we further examined pre- and post-fracture use, we observed a group of patients who 
stopped fracture promoting drugs after fracture; however, this group was offset by other 
patients who initiated therapy with a high-risk drug after fracture (Figure 1). This pattern 
was also observed in our analysis of those drugs most clearly associated with fracture risk in 
the literature (Table 4). While almost one quarter of users of sedatives, antipsychotics and 
thiazolidinediones and almost half of oral corticosteroid users discontinued use after 
fracture, a similar or greater number of nonusers initiated these drugs. The end result was 
that use of corticosteroids and thiazolidinediones decreased only slightly in the population as 
a whole, while use of the other four drugs increased after fracture.
We also found that the total number of drugs per person associated with fracture risk did not 
change meaningfully after the fracture event (Table 3.) The majority of patients continued to 
fill the same number of high-risk, non-opiate drugs after their index fracture (eTable 1). At 
the same time, more patients increased than decreased the number of fracture-promoting

 drug fills, suggesting the binary classification we used to define our primary outcome did not 
mask a significant decline in the overall burden of potentially harmful prescribing.
Use of drugs that decrease fracture risk
The use of drugs that may reduce fracture risk was uncommon at the time of the index 
fracture (Table 3). Across fracture types, less than one quarter of patients in the study cohort 
had filled a prescription for a drug that increases bone density in the 120 days prior to the 
fracture event. Following the fracture, the total numbers increased only slightly (Table 3 and 
Figure 1). Further analysis yielded a similar pattern to that seen with drugs that increase 
fracture risk: approximately one in five current users discontinued therapy after fracture 
while a nearly identical number of non-users at the time of fracture initiated treatment. 
Finally, when we examined whether drugs that decrease fracture risk might be targeted to 
patients taking drugs that increase fracture risk, we found a small effect. The use of drugs to 
decrease fracture risk was only slightly higher (22.7% vs 21.1%, p<0.001) among users of 
fracture-promoting drugs than among those who were not using high-risk drugs (eFigure 1).
Discussion
This study identified three primary findings. First, the majority of Medicare beneficiaries 
who suffer a fragility fracture are users of at least one drug that has been shown to increase 
fracture risk. This suggests that prescription drugs may be an important modifiable risk 
factor for primary fracture prevention. Second, a fragility fracture does not consistently 
serve as a sentinel event to decrease the total burden of exposure to drugs associated with 
increased fracture risk. An almost identical number of patients are exposed to drugs that are 
associated with increased fracture risk in the four months following a fracture as in the 
period preceding the index event. Third, a fracture event does result in modified exposure for 
a minority of patients, but in both directions: some patients no longer fill fracture associated 
drugs after their fracture event, while an almost equal number initiate exposure. This pattern 
was observed even among the subset of drugs most widely and convincingly recognized to 
cause fractures. The fact that some patients in our study cohort had decreased exposure to 
fracture-associated drugs following a fracture supports the feasibility of more effective 
medication review at the time of a fracture event.
The very high prevalence of fracture-associated drug use in this cohort (76%) is consistent 
with the findings of Sjoberg et al who found that nearly all of 100 elderly fracture patients in 
a single institution cohort in Sweden were using a drug that could increase fall risk at the 
time of the fracture event.40 Although these authors used a broader definition of drugs that 
could increase fall risk, our findings are also consistent with their report that the same 
proportion was using fall-promoting drugs in the 6 months following fracture. Additionally, 
our study confirms prior work demonstrating that the use of bisphosphonates and other 
fracture prevention drugs is uncommon at the time of fracture and does not increase during 
follow up. In fact, many patients who were taking drugs to increase bone density 
discontinued these medications after fracture, a finding which may indicate that physicians 
consider a fragility fracture evidence that the drugs are ineffective.

 The fact that these treatment patterns are apparent in this large, US cohort suggests that 
prescription drug use may be an effective target for secondary fracture prevention. Three 
caveats to this conclusion must be acknowledged. First, many of these drugs have important 
indications that may preclude discontinuation in response to a fracture event. Other drugs, 
however, are less clearly indicated and emerging evidence suggests there are many missed 
opportunities for de-intensification of prescription drug therapy among elderly patients in 
whom the risks of therapy likely outweigh the benefits.43 Patients in whom a fracture may 
be in part the result of drug exposure should at least be considered for such de-escalation of 
therapy. So while it is not realistic to eliminate exposure to drugs that increase fracture risk 
in all cases, reductions in that risk through evaluation of medication use and selective 
discontinuation after fracture appear achievable.
A second caveat is that the magnitude of the risk associated with many prescription drugs 
remains uncertain among fracture survivors. Observational data have demonstrated the link 
between exposure and primary fracture risk,14–32 however the precision of these estimates is 
often poor and most studies have not been conducted to address the question of secondary 
prevention. Published studies also do not address the complexities of drug combinations 
which may have additive or synergistic effects on fracture risk. This leaves unanswered 
questions concerning the magnitude of benefit that could be achieved through concerted 
efforts to modify exposure to fracture-associated drugs after a fragility fracture.
Third, the mechanism to improve prescribing practices after fracture is not clearly 
developed. Patients go through a process of medication reconciliation on hospital admission 
which should include a review of all potentially hazardous drugs; however, our data indicate 
that this process does not reduce high-risk drug use even among patients with hip fracture, 
all of whom were hospitalized. This may reflect a reluctance to modify chronic drug 
regimens on the part of physicians who manage an acute event but are not involved in the 
long-term management of multiple comorbid conditions. It may also reflect a knowledge 
gap among physicians with respect to known associations between prescription drugs and 
fracture risk. Automated decision-support in the electronic medical record focused on 
fracture risk could be developed to address the second concern,44,45 but will not change the 
need for effective communication between hospitalist physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and 
community primary care physicians regarding the risk-benefit tradeoffs of chronic 
medications.
Strengths of our study include the sample size and geographic representation of the study 
cohort as well as the comprehensive drug exposure data afforded by Part D data. Our study 
also has important limitations. The data include only Part D enrollees who tend to have more 
comorbid conditions and higher overall prescription drug utilization than non-enrollees.46 
Our results may not therefore be generalizable to other populations. We used a 4-month 
lookback period to focus on prescription drugs that were likely to be currently in use at the 
time of the fracture event and could therefore be modified by the fracture event. This 
lookback window does not capture prescription drug use prior to that time which may 
misclassify exposure to drugs that impact bone density long after use is discontinued. If 
anything, however, this decision will cause our results to underestimate exposure prior to 
fracture. After fracture, retail pharmacy claims captured in Part D data do not include drugs

 dispensed in a skilled nursing facility after discharge. Our decision to require cohort 
members to have at least 30 days of community dwelling time after fracture mitigates this 
missing data, and our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that patterns of use were nearly 
identical among those discharged directly home. Additionally, most benzodiazepine use was 
excluded from Part D coverage until after the last year of the study cohort. Consequently, 
our data under-represent this drug class. Finally, our data only extend to 2011, leaving open 
the possibility that current prescribing practices are not accurately reflected in our analysis.
Conclusion
The use of drugs that can contribute to elevated fracture risk is common among Medicare 
beneficiaries who suffer a fragility fracture, and the fracture event does not consistently lead 
to a reduction in use of these drugs. This suggests that at least some secondary fragility 
fractures may be preventable through a more concerted effort to manage high-risk drugs 
around a primary fracture event. Additional research is needed to quantify the possible 
benefits associated with modifying post-fracture drug exposure in this high-risk population.
