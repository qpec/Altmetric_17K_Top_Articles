IMPORTANCE Although the increased incidence of second primary malignant neoplasms
(SPMs) is a well-known late effect after cancer, few studies have compared survival after an
SPM to survival of the same cancer occurring as first primary malignant neoplasm (PM) by
age.
OBJECTIVE To assess the survival impact of SPMs in adolescents and young adults (AYAs)
(15-39 years) compared with that of pediatric (<15 years) and older adult (�40 years) patients
with the same SPMs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a population-based, retrospective cohort
study of patients with cancer in 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results regions in the
United States diagnosed from 1992 to 2008 and followed through 2013. Data analysis was
performed between June 2016 and January 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Five-year relative survival was calculated overall and for
each cancer occurring as a PM or SPM by age at diagnosis. The impact of SPM status on
cancer-specific death was examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS A total of 15 954 pediatric, 125 750 AYAs, and 878 370 older adult patients
diagnosed as having 14 cancers occurring as a PM or SPM were included. Overall, 5-year
survival after an SPM was 33.1% lower for children, 20.2% lower for AYAs, and 8.3% lower for
older adults compared with a PM at the same age. For the most common SPMs in AYAs, the
absolute difference in 5-year survival was 42% lower for secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
19% for secondary breast carcinoma, 15% for secondary thyroid carcinoma, and 13% for
secondary soft-tissue sarcoma. Survival by SPM status was significantly worse in younger vs
older patients for thyroid, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid
leukemia, soft-tissue sarcoma, and central nervous system cancer. Adolescents and young
adults with secondary Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio [95% CI], 3.5 [1.7-7.1]); soft-tissue
sarcoma (2.8 [2.1-3.9]); breast carcinoma (2.1 [1.8-2.4]); acute myeloid leukemia (1.9 [1.5-2.4]);
and central nervous system cancer (1.8 [1.2-2.8]) experienced worse survival compared with
AYAs with the same PMs.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The adverse impact of SPMs on survival is substantial for AYAs
and may partially explain the relative lack of survival improvement in AYAs compared with
other age groups. The impact of a particular SPM diagnosis on survival may inform
age-specific prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship recommendations.

 T
he increased incidence of second primary malignant
neoplasms (SPMs) is a well-known late effect after can-
cer. Although pediatric cancer survivors are at a higher
risk of developing an SPM compared with older cancer survi-
vors, adolescent and young adult survivors (AYAs) have the
highest absolute excess risk of SPMs among all age groups.1
Studies have reported the increased late mortality after spe-
cific SPMs among young cancer survivors, but to our knowl-
edge,nostudyhasassessedthesurvivalimpactofvariousSPMs
in AYAs compared with pediatric and older adult patients. It
is possible that the detrimental effect of SPMs on survival ac-
counts for some of the lack of survival improvement in AYAs
compared with pediatric and older adult patients with cancer.2
Therefore, using data from the National Cancer Institute’
s Sur-
veillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, we
compared survival of patients with SPMs with their corre-
sponding first primary cancer types and determined if there
were age-specific differences in survival after SPMs.
Methods
Patients
All patients diagnosed with an invasive first primary malig-
nant neoplasm (PM) or SPM (with known type of PM) during
1992 to 2008 were identified from 13 SEER registries.3 Only 14
common AYA cancers (female breast cancer; thyroid, mela-
noma, and testicular cancers; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-
Hodgkin lymphoma; acute lymphoid leukemia; acute my-
eloid leukemia; soft-tissue sarcoma; bone sarcoma; and
colorectal, central nervous system, cervical, and ovarian can-
cers) were included in this study.
From SEER, we obtained clinical and demographic infor-
mation, including race/ethnicity, routinely recorded in the
medical record at diagnosis, and vital status, which for the de-
ceased included underlying cause of death. Patients were di-
vided into 3 age groups by the age of diagnosis of the PM or
SPM: children (<15 years), AYAs (15-39 years), and older adults
(≥40 years). The PM group patients had a PM only, and the PM
and SPM did not necessarily occur in the same age group.
Second primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed within
2 months of the PM were excluded to remove what were likely
multiple primary tumors. Second primary malignant neo-
plasms with histologic characteristics similar to those of their
corresponding PM were reviewed to verify that no SPMs would
beconsideredrecurrencesaccordingtotheupdatedSEERmul-
tiple primary coding rules or best clinical practice.4 Patients
withinvalidsurvivaltime(n = 7585)wereexcluded.Thisstudy
was approved by the University of California, Davis, institu-
tional review board.
Statistical Analysis
Five-yearrelativesurvivalandstandarderrorsusingtheEderer
II method were calculated using SAS statistical software (ver-
sion 9.3; SAS institute Inc) with National Center for Health Sta-
tistics expected survival life tables. Multivariable Cox propor-
tional hazards regression at P < .05 was used to evaluate
associations of SPM with survival, controlling for age, race/
ethnicity, sex, year of diagnosis, and stage at diagnosis (where
applicable). For deceased patients, survival time was mea-
sured from diagnosis date of the PM or SPM to the date of death
from any cause (all-cause death) and any cancer (cancer-
specific death). Deaths from non–cancer-related causes were
considered as competing risks in analyses of cancer death.
Patients alive at the study end date (December 31, 2013) were
censored at this date or at last known contact.
Results
Atotalof15 954pediatric,125 750AYA,and878 370olderadult
patients diagnosed as having 14 cancers occurring as a PM or
SPMwereincludedinthestudy.Childrenwithcancerwerepre-
dominantly male, whereas AYA and older adult patients were
predominantly female (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The
distribution of PMs and SPMs for each age group are pre-
sented in eTable 1 in the Supplement, and the 3 most com-
mon PMs for those with an SPM are presented in eTable 2 in
the Supplement.
The 5-year relative survival for all selected cancers seems
lower for those with SPMs than those with a PM, with the larg-
est absolute difference in 5-year survival observed for chil-
dren (33.1%) and AYAs (20.2%) compared with older adults
(8.3%) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). In AYAs, 5-year relative
survival for both a PM and SPM melanoma and testicular can-
cer was high. However, 5-year relative survival seems lower
for all other SPMs compared with corresponding PMs in AYAs.
For the most common SPMs in AYAs, the absolute differences
in 5-year relative survival were 41.9%, 18.9%, 15.0%, and 12.6%
lower for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, thyroid
cancer, and soft-tissue sarcoma, respectively, than if these
cancers occurred as a PM.
Inmultivariable-adjustedmodels,childrenwithacutelym-
phoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and central ner-
vous system cancer as an SPM were at a higher risk of cancer
death than that of the same PM (Table). In AYAs, almost every
SPM conferred a higher risk of death compared with the
same PM. Secondary Hodgkin lymphoma and thyroid cancer
had more than a 3-fold increased risk, and secondary breast
Key Points
Question Do second primary malignant neoplasms (SPMs) have a
similar detrimental impact on survival for children, adolescents
and young adults (AYAs), and older adults?
Findings In this cohort study, the impact of SPMs on survival was
more pronounced in children and AYAs than older adults.
Adolescents and young adults with a second Hodgkin lymphoma,
sarcoma, or breast, thyroid, or testicular cancers had a greater
than 2-fold increased risk of cancer-specific death than those with
the same primary malignant neoplasms, but no prior cancer.
Meaning The adverse impact of SPMs on survival is substantial for
AYAs and may partially explain the relative lack of survival
improvement in AYAs compared with older adults with the same
cancers.

 cancer, testicular cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, and bone sar-
coma had more than a 2-fold increased risk of cancer-specific
death. In general, SPMs in older adults were associated with
highermortality,butthemagnitudeofassociationswaslessthan
in AYAs. All-cause and cancer-specific death by SPM status was
significantlyworseinyoungerpatientsforthyroid,Hodgkinlym-
phoma,acutelymphoidleukemia,acutemyeloidleukemia,soft-
tissue sarcoma, and central nervous system cancer; all-cause
death by SPM status was significantly worse among younger
patients for breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal
cancer, and cervical cancer.
Discussion
In this large, population-based study, the impact of an SPM on
survival for the 14 cancers considered was most pronounced
in AYAs and the relatively few SPMs that occurred in child-
hood compared with older adults. For the most common SPMs
in AYAs, the absolute differences in 5-year survival were sub-
stantial.
To our knowledge, we are the first to report such large dif-
ferences in 5-year survival after a second breast cancer or thy-
roid cancer by age. Possible explanations include a difference
in aggressiveness of a PM vs SPM,5-7 the increased probability
that younger patients harbor a genetic syndrome and differ-
ent distributions of PM in younger patients.8 An initial thy-
roid carcinoma may also be a result of overdiagnosis (and thus
not be clinically important) or related to the latency time from
the PM to thyroid SPM.9 Testicular cancer; soft-tissue sar-
coma; bone sarcoma; and central nervous system, colorectal,
and cervical cancers as SPMs likewise conferred an increased
risk of death in AYAs, although melanoma and ovarian cancer
did not.
We are also the first to report a large difference in survival
for PM and SPM Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma, particularly among children and AYAs. Treatment for
any PM may have affected potential treatment options for a
non-Hodgkin lymphoma SPM owing to cumulative toxic
effects,10 thus having an impact on prognosis. In addition, in
AYAs, 76% of PMs before non-Hodgkin lymphoma were Ka-
posi sarcoma, suggesting that an underlying diagnosis of HIV/

 AIDS is having an impact on the prognosis of second non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. Compared with lymphomas, secondary
acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia por-
tend an extremely poor prognosis across all age groups, which
mayberelatedtodifferentbiology,includingcytogeneticorepi-
genetic features, that result in a poor response to therapy for
secondary leukemias.11,12 The primary strength of the current
study is the large number of patients from population-based
registries, increasing the generalizability of our results.
Limitations
Study limitations include a lack of detailed treatment infor-
mation, comorbidities, health behaviors, and genetic infor-
mation. Also, younger populations tend to be more mobile,
which may underestimate the number of SPMs identified
and lead to conservative (negatively biased) estimates of
cancer survival.
Conclusions
The adverse impact of SPMs on both relative survival and can-
cer death seems greater for AYAs and pediatric patients com-
paredwitholderpatientswithcancer.Ourfindingssuggestthat
SPMs may partially account for the relative lack of improve-
ment in 5-year relative survival in AYAs. As more young pa-
tients with cancer continue to live for many decades as survi-
vors, the impact of a particular SPM diagnosis on survival may
inform age-specific prevention, screening, treatment, and sur-
vivorship recommendations.
