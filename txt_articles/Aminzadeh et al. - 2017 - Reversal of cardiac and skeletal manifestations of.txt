Genetic deficiency of dystrophin leads to disability and premature death in Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, affecting the heart as well as skeletal muscle. Here we report that 
cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), which are being tested clinically for the treatment of 
Duchenne cardiomyopathy, improve cardiac and skeletal myopathy in the mdx mouse model 
of DMD and in human Duchenne cardiomyocytes.  Injection of CDCs into the hearts of mdx 
mice augments cardiac function, ambulatory capacity and survival. Exosomes secreted by 
human CDCs reproduce the benefits of CDCs in mdx mice and in human Duchenne 
cardiomyocytes. The findings further motivate the testing of CDCs in Duchenne patients, 
while identifying exosomes as next-generation therapeutic candidates.

INTRODUCTION 
Absence of dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) leads to membrane fragility and 
secondary damage to muscle (both skeletal and cardiac)(1). Early disability is due predominantly 
to the skeletal myopathy, but heart failure is the most common cause of death(2). Cardiosphere-
derived cells (CDCs) may represent a viable therapeutic option(3-5). CDCs are progenitor cells 
intrinsic to the heart; in clinical trials after myocardial infarction, CDCs promote cardiomyogenesis 
and reverse established scar (6, 7). Multiple lines of evidence now indicate that most of the 
beneficial effects of CDCs are indirect. In the extreme, allogeneic CDCs are cleared completely 
within several weeks, but their functional and structural benefits persist at least 6 months (8). CDCs 
secrete diffusible factors that promote angiogenesis, recruit endogenous progenitor cells, and coax 
surviving heart cells to proliferate (9, 10); transplanted CDCs suppress maladaptive remodeling  
(11), apoptosis (10, 12), fibrosis (13), and inflammation after myocardial infarction (13) and in 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy (14). These diverse mechanisms appear to be mediated via the 
secretion of exosomes laden with noncoding RNA including microRNAs (miRs) (15), consistent 
with the notion that exosomes contain a plethora of bioactive molecules which target multiple 
signaling pathways synergistically (16). In a murine model of myocardial infarction, CDC-secreted 
exosomes (CDC-exosomes) mimic the functional and structural benefits of CDCs, while blockade 
of exosome biosynthesis renders CDCs ineffective (15). Given the clinical data with CDCs, and 
the complementarity between their therapeutic actions and the pathophysiological processes 
underlying Duchenne cardiomyopathy (oxidative stress (17, 18), inflammation (19), fibrosis (20), 
and mitochondrial dysfunction (21)), we reasoned that CDCs and their exosomes might be useful 
in treating Duchenne cardiomyopathy. Our early work reported in abstract form (22, 23) revealed 
striking phenotypic correction by CDCs in mdx dystrophic mice, motivating the ongoing HOPE-

Duchenne clinical trial (24) of CDCs in DMD patients.  Initially, we had not aspired to restore 
skeletal muscle function, but merely to offset the pathophysiological consequences of dystrophin 
deletion in the heart. We now report that CDCs and their secreted exosomes potently improve 
skeletal muscle structure and function, contributing to major systemic benefits after injection of 
CDCs into the heart.  
 
RESULTS 
CDC transplantation in mdx hearts  
Intramyocardial injection of first and second (lower) doses of CDCs into the hearts of mdx mice 
improved left ventricular function (as manifested by ejection fraction [EF]) and volumes, relative 
to placebo, for at least 6 months (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). The CDC-induced improvement in EF 
persisted beyond the point at which no surviving CDCs were detectable in mdx hearts (3 weeks 
after CDC delivery; fig. S1B). In addition to improving EF, CDC injection enhanced ambulatory 
function (Fig. 1B). Ten-month-old wild-type mice (WT) and mdx mice (distinct from the mdx mice 
studied in Fig. 1A) were subjected to weekly high-intensity treadmill exercise, starting 3 weeks 
after single-dose CDC or vehicle administration. CDC-treated mdx mice showed a substantial 
increase in maximal exercise capacity, relative to vehicle-treated mdx mice, over the 3 mos that 
exercise capacity was measured; survival also differed in the two groups (Fig. 1C). By ~23 mos of 
age, all vehicle-treated mdx mice had died, whereas >50% of CDC-treated mdx mice remained 
alive (Fig. 1C). In investigating mechanism, we first studied known (anti-oxidative, anti-
inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and cardiomyogenic) effects of CDCs (3-15). Injection of CDCs led 
to major changes in the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation and

mitochondrial integrity (fig. S2). The Nrf2 anti-oxidant pathway was activated in CDC-treated 
mdx heart (Fig. 1D). Nrf2 is normally repressed by Keap1, but oxidative stress (as well as Nrf2 
phosphorylation by protein kinases such as Akt) causes dissociation of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, 
culminating in nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and transcriptional activation of antioxidant enzymes  
(25). In mdx hearts, levels of phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 1E), total Nrf2 (Fig. 1F) and nuclear Nrf2 
(Fig. 1G) were high (as expected in response to oxidative stress); CDC treatment further increased 
their protein levels (Figs. 1D-G) and those of downstream gene products (heme oxygenase-1 [HO-
1], catalase, superoxide dismutase-2 [SOD-2], and the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine 
ligase [GCLC]; Fig. 1H & fig. S2E).  Concomitantly, oxidative stress was attenuated, as evidenced 
by a profound reduction of malondialdehyde adducts (Fig. 1I). Histological analysis revealed 
extensive fibrosis in vehicle-treated mdx hearts, but much less in CDC-treated mdx hearts 
(comparable to an age-matched wild-type [WT] control; fig. S3A). Likewise, CDC treatment 
largely reversed the accumulation of collagens I and III in mdx heart tissue 3 weeks after treatment 
(fig. S3B). CDCs inhibited the inflammation (Figs. 1J,K) and mitochondrial dysfunction (Figs. 
1L-N) characteristic of mdx cardiomyopathy. NFκB, the master regulator of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines (26), was activated in vehicle mdx hearts (Fig. 1K, top panel). Increases 
in phosphorylated IκB and nuclear p65 were accompanied by upregulation of MCP1 (monocyte 
chemoattractant protein1) and accumulation of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T cells (Fig. 1K, 
bottom panel). CDC treatment reversed activation of NFκB and decreased the number of 
inflammatory cells in mdx hearts 3 weeks after CDC injection (Figs. 1J,K; figs. S4, S5). 
Mitochondrial structure and function are abnormal in muscular dystrophy-associated heart failure 
(21). Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed major changes in the expression of genes related to 
mitochondrial integrity in mdx hearts (fig. S2B). Consistent with this finding, CDCs restored

mitochondrial ultrastructure (Fig. 1L), increased mitochondrial DNA copy numbers (but not 
mitochondrial number; fig. S6), augmented levels of respiratory chain subunits (Fig. 1M) and 
normalized the deficient respiratory capacity of isolated mdx mitochondria (Fig. 1N). Of note, the 
salutary mitochondrial changes were associated with upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and 
reductions of oxidative stress and inflammation (Figs. 1D-k; figs. S2C-E, S5). We also probed the 
effects of CDCs on cardiomyogenesis. Vehicle-treated mdx hearts exhibited a modest increase in 
the numbers of cycling (Ki67+) and proliferating (aurora B+) cardiomyocytes (fig. S7), presumably 
as a compensation for ongoing cardiomyocyte loss. CDCs are known to increase endogenous 
cardiomyogenesis in ischemic (7, 11, 12, 27, 28) and non-ischemic models (14). Similar effects 
were seen in the mdx heart: CDC treatment promoted cardiomyocyte cycling and proliferation, as 
evidenced by a marked increase in Ki67+ and aurora B+ cardiomyocytes (fig. S7).  
CDC-exosome transplantation in mdx hearts 
CDC-exosomes mimic the functional and structural benefits of CDCs in a murine model of 
myocardial infarction (15). In mdx mice, likewise, exosomes, isolated from media conditioned by 
hypoxic CDCs, reproduced the benefits of CDCs (Figs. 2A-C, fig. S8A-D). Two repeat doses of 
human CDC-exosomes (separated by 3 months) led to sustained improvement in EF, relative to 
vehicle injection (Fig. 2A & fig. S8B), with a minimal but detectable humoral response in the non-
immunosuppressed mdx mice (fig. S8C). Collagen I and III levels decreased (Fig. 2B) while 
cycling (Ki67+, Fig. 2C upper row) and proliferating (aurora B+, Fig. 2C lower row) 
cardiomyocytes increased in CDC-exosome-injected mdx hearts. The effects of CDC-exosomes 
were mediated at least in part via clathrin-mediated endocytosis by the surrounding myocardium 
(fig. S8D).

Remote effects of CDC transplantation in mdx heart 
Intramyocardial injection of CDCs and their exosomes improved Duchenne cardiomyopathy, 
reversing key pathophysiological processes in the mdx mouse heart (Figs. 1, 2). These changes 
were associated with a substantial increase in exercise capacity, which was disproportionate to the 
improvement in cardiac function: EF increased by <10% (Fig. 1A), while ambulatory capacity 
doubled (Fig. 1B). To further evaluate the mechanism of enhanced exercise capacity in CDC-
treated mdx mice, we isolated and examined three distinct skeletal muscles: the diaphragm (DIA, 
a key respiratory muscle), and two limb muscles (soleus and extensor digitorum longus [EDL], 
representative of slow and fast twitch muscles, respectively) 3 weeks after intramyocardial 
injection of CDCs or vehicle. Whole-transcriptome analysis in DIA revealed down-regulation of 
pathways related to intracellular [Ca2+] excess, oxidative stress and inflammation after 
intramyocardial CDC injection (Fig. 3A & fig. S9). Decreases in malondialdehyde protein adducts 
(Fig. 3B), repressed NFκB, reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. 3C) and diminished 
fibrosis (Fig. 3D) paralleled a marked improvement in the contractile function of DIA (Figs. 3E-
G). Similarly, soleus (Figs. 3H-K) and EDL (figs. S10A) showed notable improvements at 
transcriptomic, histologic and functional levels; soleus fibrosis (fig. S10B) was attenuated and 
contractile force (Figs. 3I-K) was augmented. Changes in gene expression in DIA and soleus were 
significantly correlated (Fig. 3L). 
 As a basis for the remote effects of intramyocardial injection of CDCs on skeletal muscle, we 
considered the possibility that exosomes secreted by CDCs lodged in the heart might exit in the 
venous effluent and exert remote signaling. Principal components analysis revealed that CDC-
exosomes were very similar in their RNA contents to the exosomes isolated from effluents of 
isolated CDC-treated mdx hearts, but quite distinct from exosomes in the effluents of vehicle-

treated mdx hearts 3 days after intramyocardial CDC injection (Fig. 3M), pinpointing exosomes as 
likely mediators of the secondary systemic effects. Such secondary effects are extensive: whole 
transcriptome analysis of liver (fig. S11A) 3 weeks after intramyocardial CDC injection revealed 
downregulation of inflammatory pathways in liver analogous to what we found in heart and 
skeletal muscle. Thus, CDCs’ secondary effects are not restricted to muscle. 
Systemic CDC-exosome injection 
To further evaluate the potential of exosomes to mediate systemic benefits, we injected CDC-
exosomes into the left ventricular cavity of mdx hearts. Six hours post-injection, fluorescently- 
labeled CDC-exosomes were evident not only in the heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4A), but also 
in brain, liver, lung, spleen, gut and kidneys (fig. S11B). Changes in mdx heart (Figs. 4B-E), 
diaphragm (DIA; Figs. 4F-H) and soleus (Figs. 4I-K) 3 weeks after intraventricular CDC-exosome 
injection mimicked the modifications seen in these organs after intramyocardial CDC injection 
(Fig. 3). Taken together, the results in Figs. 1-4 implicate CDC-exosomes as mediators of the local 
and remote effects of intramyocardial CDC injection.    
CDC-exosome injection into mdx skeletal muscle 
To investigate primary effects on skeletal muscle, we injected CDC-exosomes directly into the 
soleus in mdx mice. Histological analysis revealed a paucity of surviving myofibers in vehicle-
injected mdx soleus relative to wild-type controls, and those that remained were hypertrophic (Fig. 
5A). CDC-exosomes markedly increased the total number of myofibers and shifted the size 
distribution to smaller diameters, indicative of myofiber proliferation 3 weeks after injection (Fig. 
5B). Consistent with this interpretation, the number of MyoD+ cells was augmented after CDC-
exosome injection (Figs. 5A,C), with increased tissue levels of MyoD and myogenin, the major

transcription factors orchestrating myoblast determination and differentiation, respectively (29) 
(Fig. 5D). In physiological muscle growth, IGF-1 is commonly implicated as an upstream signal 
(30), but the effects of CDC-exosomes on mdx soleus muscle were independent of IGF-1 receptors 
(Fig. 5E). Along with enhanced muscle regeneration, intrasoleus CDC-exosome injection 
decreased inflammation (Fig. 5F) and fibrosis (Fig. 5G). The net effect was complete restoration 
of contractile force in soleus muscles injected with CDC-exosomes (Fig. 5H).    
CDC-exosomes in human Duchenne cardiomyocytes derived from iPS cells  
Demonstration of efficacy in multiple models of DMD would bolster the notion that CDC-
exosomes may be viable therapeutic candidates. Duchenne human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPS)-derived cardiomyocytes (DMD CMs) exhibit a number of phenotypic deficits characteristic 
of DMD, including decreased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) reminiscent of that observed in 
mdx heart mitochondria (Fig. 1N), and abnormal calcium cycling (31). Priming DMD CMs with 
CDC-exosomes one week earlier suppressed beat-to-beat calcium transient alternans during 1Hz 
burst pacing (a measure of arrhythmogenicity (32); Fig. 6A) and normalized OCR (Fig. 6B). The 
congruence of experimental findings in the two DMD models is noteworthy: the mdx mouse has a 
nonsense mutation in exon 23 of the murine dystrophin gene, while the DMD patient whose iPS 
cells were studied here has a fundamentally different genetic lesion in the human dystrophin gene 
(exon 50 deletion with frame shift (31)). Thus, CDC-exosomes exert salutary effects in at least 
two classes of DMD mutations.  
DISCUSSION 
We propose that CDCs act by secreting exosomes which are taken up by surrounding myocardium 
and by skeletal muscle, antagonizing multiple pathophysiological pathways that underlie DMD.

The congruent effects in mdx mice and in exon 50-deleted DMD hCM (Fig. 6) highlight the ability 
of CDC-exosomes to benefit multiple disease-causing dystrophin mutations. In the present work, 
we have not excluded the possibility that CDCs and their exosomes might, unexpectedly, increase 
dystrophin expression. We are presently investigating that possibility. Nevertheless, the 
dystrophin-independent actions of CDCs and their exosomal contents should be generalizable. 
After all, CDCs and their exosomes work quite well in cardiomyopathies not associated with 
dystrophin deficiency (7, 14, 27). The protean actions of CDCs and their exosomes include 
improved mitochondrial function, enhanced myocyte proliferation, and suppression of oxidative 
stress, inflammation and fibrosis (Fig. 7). Observed effects which appear to be independent of 
dystrophin restoration include the suppression of inflammation in mdx liver (an organ with no 
dystrophin expression). Notably, CDCs and their exosomes not only reverse the dystrophic 
phenotype but also forestall progression: the functional benefits of cardiac injections of CDCs or 
their exosomes persist for at least 3 months, and single doses of CDCs decrease mortality more 
than one year later in mdx mice. These findings beg the investigation of exosomally-triggered 
epigenomic modifications as a potential basis for the durable benefits (33), but such experiments 
are beyond the scope of this report.  
The ongoing HOPE-Duchenne trial is designed to assess single-dose delivery of CDCs to the heart 
(24). Whether in this first trial or in follow-up studies, our results give reason to wonder if CDCs 
will turn out to benefit not only the cardiomyopathy but also the skeletal myopathy of DMD. 
Exosomes derived from CDCs are promising next-generation therapeutic candidates with 
mechanisms of action fundamentally different to those currently in active development for DMD 
(e.g., exon skipping or myoediting).

Methods  
Please see supplement for expanded methods. 
Animal study: 
We studied mdx mouse model of DMD (C57BL/10ScSn-Dmdmdx/J) and wild-type strain-
matched mouse (C57BL/10ScSnJ wild type mouse heart) (Jackson Laboratory, USA) from 10 
months of age. To optimize the process of CDC transplantation, preliminary dose-response 
experiments were performed, which identified 1x105 cells in first injection and 1x104  cells in 
second injection (3 months after first injection) as effective doses, consistent with prior dose-
ranging experiments in ischemic and non-ischemic mouse models(14, 34). A total of 1x105 
cells/40µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; first injection) or 1x104 cells/40µL PBS (second 
injection) or PBS alone were injected into left ventricular (LV) myocardium divided equally 
among 4 sites as described (14, 35). The LV was visually divided into three zones: basal, middle, 
and apical, with one injection in the basal, two in the middle and one in the apical zone. Ten-
month-old CDC/mdx and vehicle/mdx mice were injected with CDCs (Mdx+CDC, n=12) or 
vehicle [placebo: Mdx+Vehicle (PBS), n=12] twice (3 months interval), respectively. Injections 
were during open-chest thoracotomy via a 28½ gauge-needle. All surgical procedures were carried 
out while the animals were under general anesthesia (Dexmedetomidine (0.5mg/kg)/Ketamine 
(75mg/kg); IP; once before surgery). Similar protocols were used for injection of CDC-exosomes 
into myocardium. Intraventricular single injection of CDC-exosomes [(10.32±3.28)x109/150 µL 
PBS] or PBS alone into LV cavity were performed during open-chest thoracotomy via a 28½ 
gauge-needle. Intraaortic injections of CDCs (1x104 cells/40µL PBS) or PBS were conducted 
using PE-10 catheter (ALZET; Cupertino, CA) via neck carotid artery. Intramuscular injection of 
exosomes into soleus (SOL) muscles were performed at a single site at the lower 1/3 of the muscle

using a 25 µl Hamilton syringe (with 0.5 µl marks) with a 31 gauge needle. The needle was 
advanced up to the upper 1/3 of the muscle and then slowly retracted through the belly as exosomes 
[(20.64±2.12)x107/3 µL] were injected. To ensure ethical and humane treatment of animals, we 
adhered to the principles recommended in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals with 
oversight and approval by the Cedars-Sinai Health System Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee and the Department of Comparative Medicine (IACUC#3809). 
CDCs, CDC-exosomes, NHDF exosomes  
CDC: Mouse CDCs were expanded from wild-type strain-matched mouse hearts 
(C57BL/10ScSnJ wild type mouse heart) as described(4). Briefly, ventricular tissues were minced 
into ~1 mm explants, partially digested enzymatically and plated on adherent (fibronectin-coated) 
culture dishes. These explants spontaneously yield outgrowth cells (explant-derived cells) which 
were harvested once confluent and plated in suspension culture (105 cells/mL on poly-D-lysine–
coated dishes) to enable self-assembly of three-dimensional cardiospheres. Subsequent replating 
of cardiospheres on adherent culture dishes yielded CDCs which were used in all experiments at 
passage one. CDC-exosomes: Exosomes were isolated from serum-free media conditioned 
overnight (24 hr) by cultured human CDCs(4, 7) (CDC-exosome) [or normal human dermal 
fibroblasts (NHDF) as a control] in hypoxia (2% O2; default condition) or normoxia (20% O2, 
solely for studies comparing RNA content of exosomes). Ultracentrifugation (100,000g for 1 hr) 
was used to isolate exosomes from conditioned media after sequential centrifugations at 300g 
(10min) and 10,000g (30min) and filtration with 0.22 micron filters(36). Isolated exosomes were 
re-suspended in PBS (for in vivo and in vitro experiments) and the ratio of exosome to protein was 
measured using Nanosight particle counter(37) and Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life 
technologies, Grand Island, NY), respectively. Preliminary dose-response studies identified

[(2.24±1.34)x107] and [6.19±3.68 x108] exosomes from hypoxic CDCs as effective doses for in 
vitro and in vivo (intramyocardial CDC-exosome injection) experiments, respectively. Exosomes 
were characterized by the most rigorous of criteria(38): linear iodixanol density gradient, 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), key membrane proteins, and the biological effect. TEM 
images of sequentially-centrifuged exosomes with and without purification with linear iodixanol 
density gradient are shown (fig. S12A). The vesicles are variable in size and morphology, 
consistent with previous work(39). Western blot on lysed exosomes showed key proteins 
characteristic of exosomes: CD63, CD81 and TSG (fig. S12B). Biological activity of sequentially-
centrifuged exosomes with (Exo1) and without (Exo2) purification with linear iodixanol density 
were compared by injection into mdx soleus muscles and evaluation of mdx soleus transcriptome 
3 weeks after injection (fig. S12C). Correlation of fold changes in expression of same genes 3 
weeks after Exo1 and Exo2 injection in mdx soleus muscles (fig. S12D) demonstrated similarity 
of the effects of Exo1 and Exo2 and supported the notion that the bioactivity of the vesicles isolated 
by our default protocol is genuinely due to exosomes, and not to another type of vesicles that might 
have been co-purified by ultracentrifugation.  
Echocardiography 
Echocardiographic studies were performed two days before (Baseline) and 3 weeks, 2 and 3 
months after first CDC/CDC-exosome (CDC-exosome) or vehicle injection and 3 weeks, 2 and 3 
months after second CDC/CDC-exosome or vehicle injection (when applicable) using the Vevo 
770 Imaging System (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada)(4). The same imaging system was used to 
perform echocardiographic studies at baseline (2 days before) and 3 weeks after selected RNA (or 
control) injection. After induction of light general anesthesia, the heart was imaged at the level of

the greatest LV diameter. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured with VisualSonics version 
1.3.8 software from 2-dimensional long-axis views.  
Treadmill exercise testing and survival analysis 
For Fig. 1B, exercise capacity was assessed weekly with Exer-3/6 open treadmill (Columbus 
Instruments, Columbus, OH), beginning 1 week pre-operatively and 3 weeks after CDC/vehicle 
injection (exercise capacity measured in a subset of mdx mice 1 week pre-operatively was 
equivalent to that measured 3 weeks post-operatively in the Mdx+Vehicle group). After an 
acclimation period (10 m/min for 20 min), stepwise increases in average speed (2 m/min) were 
applied every two minutes during treadmill exercise until the mouse became exhausted (spending 
>10 seconds on shocker; continuous nudging was used during treadmill to help mice stay on the 
track). Subsequently, the mouse was returned to the cage and the total distance recorded. The 
treadmill protocol conformed to guidelines from the American Physiological Society(40). After 3 
months of weekly exercise, CDC/vehicle mdx mice along with wild-type age-matched mice were 
followed for assessment of mortality (Fig. 1C).  
In vitro isometric contractile properties of skeletal muscle 
Mice were deeply anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight IP), 
the soleus (SOL) and/or extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and/or diaphragm (DIA) muscles were 
rapidly excised, and the animal was euthanized. Briefly, following a lateral midline skin incision 
of the lower leg the SOL and/or EDL muscle was dissected and isolated and its tendons of origin 
and insertion were tightened with silk suture (3-0) and rapidly excised. The SOL or EDL muscle 
was vertically mounted in a tissue bath containing a mammalian Ringer's solution of the following 
composition: (in mM) 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1 NaH2PO4, 24 NaHCO3, 11 glucose.

The solution was constantly aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 with pH maintained at 7.35 and 
temperature kept at 24°C. For studies of the diaphragm, following a left costal margin skin and 
muscle incision, a section of the midcostal hemidiaphragm was transferred to a preparatory Sylgar-
lined dish containing cold Ringer’s and a narrow 3-4 mm wide strip of diaphragm was isolated 
maintaining fiber attachments to the rib and central tendon intact which were tighten with silk 
suture and mounted vertically in the tissue bath. One end of the SOL, EDL or DIA was secured to 
a clamp at the bottom of the dish and one end was attached to a calibrated force transducer 
(Cambridge Technology Model 300B, Watertown, MA). A micromanipulator linked to the system 
was used to adjust muscle length. Platinum plate electrodes placed on each side of the muscle were 
used for direct muscle stimulation (Grass Model S88 stimulator; Quincy, MA) using 0.2 msec 
duration monophasic rectangular pulses of constant current delivered at supramaximal intensity. 
Muscle length was adjusted until maximum isometric twitch force responses were obtained. 
Isometric contractile properties were determined at optimal length (Lo). Peak twitch force (Pt) was 
determined from a series of single pulses. Force/frequency relationships were measured at stimulus 
frequencies ranging from 5-150 pulses per second (pps). The stimuli were presented in trains of 1 
sec duration with an interval of at least 1 min intervening between each stimulus train. Muscle 
forces generated, including Pt and maximum tetanic force (Po), were normalized for the estimated 
physiological cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the muscle segment (CSA = muscle weight/1.056 x 
Lo; where 1.056 g/cm3 represents the density of muscle) and expressed in Newtons (N)/cm2. For 
the SOL and EDL muscle Lo was also normalized for muscle fiber length (0.71 and 0.44 of Lo, 
respectively) in estimating muscle specific force. Absolute muscle forces generated by the SOL 
and EDL are also reported (mN)(41).

iPSC derived cardiomyocytes  
Urine-derived cells were seeded onto Matrigel (BD, San Jose, California) coated 12 well plates at 
50,000 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight (day 0). On day two, cells were transduced with 
high-titer OSKM viral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene for three hours. Viral 
supernatants were replaced with fresh USC medium and after three days, replaced with mTeSR1 
medium (StemCell Technology, Vancouver, BC) and changed daily. As iPSC-like colonies 
appeared over time, they were picked using glass pasteur pipettes under a stereo dissection 
microscope (Leica M205C, Buffalo Grove, IL) and transferred to new Matrigel-coated plates for 
further expansion. Urine-derived iPSCs were differentiated to cardiomyocytes following an 
established protocol with modifications. Briefly, iPSC colonies were detached by 10 minute 
incubation with Versene (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA), triturated to a single-cell suspension 
and seeded onto Matrigel-coated plastic dishes at a density of 250,000cells/cm2 in mTeSR1 
medium and cultured for 4 more days. Differentiation was then initiated by switching the medium 
to RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2% insulin reduced B27 (Life Technologies) and fresh 
L-glutamine. 
 
Histology 
Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks (WT: n=4; Mdx+Vehicle: n=6; Mdx+CDC/Mdx+CDC-exosome : 
n=6 each) or 3 months (WT: n=4; Mdx+Vehicle: n=6; Mdx+CDC/Mdx+CDC-exosome : n=6) after 
first CDC/CDC-exosome injections (n=6). Paraffin-embedded sections from apical, middle and 
basal parts of each heart or from diaphragm or entire soleus muscle (cross or longitudinal sections) 
were used for histology. Masson's trichrome staining (HT15 Trichrome Stain [Masson] Kit; 
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was performed for evaluation of fibrosis. T cells, B cells and

macrophages were assessed by immunostaining with antibodies against mouse CD3, CD20 and 
CD68, respectively, and the average number of cells was calculated by counting cells in 10 fields 
from each of 10 sections selected randomly from the apical (3 sections; 50µm interval), middle (4 
sections; 50µm interval) and basal (3 sections; 50µm interval) regions of each heart or from 
diaphragm. The data were presented as number of cells/mm2 field.  Actively-cycling (Ki67+) and 
proliferating (Aurora B+) cardiomyocytes were counted in the same manner, and the cycling and 
proliferating fractions were expressed as the number of Ki67+, Aurora B+ divided by the total 
number of cardiomyocytes per high-power field (HPF), respectively, as described(14). 
Measurements were averaged for each heart. Immunofluorescence staining: Heat-induced epitope 
retrieval in low or high pH buffer (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) was followed by 2 hours 
permeabilization/blocking with Protein Block Solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) containing 1% 
saponin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; Protein Block Solution contained 3% saponin was applied for 
immunofluorescence staining of Ki67). Subsequently, primary antibodies in Protein Block 
Solution were applied overnight in 4 C° for immunofluorescence staining of 5-µm sections from 
apical, middle and basal parts of each heart or cross sections of soleus muscle. After 3x wash with 
PBS, each 10 minutes, Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) 
were used for detection. Images were taken by a Leica TCS SP5 X confocal microscopy system. 
Immunofluorescence staining was conducted using antibodies against Ki-67 (SP6; RM-9106-S0; 
1:50, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA), WGA (Wheat germ agglutinin; W32466, 1:200; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA), Nrf2 (C20; 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, 
CA), aurora B (611082; 1:250; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Immunoperoxidase staining: 
Immunohistochemical detection of CD3 (AC-0004A), CD20 (AC-0012A) and CD68 (790-2931) 
was performed on 5-µm sections using prediluted rabbit monoclonal antibodies from Ventana

Medical System (Tuscon, AZ; CD68) and Cell Marque (Rocklin, CA; CD3, CD20). Staining was 
conducted on the Leica Bond-Max Ventana automated slide stainer (Chicago, IL) using onboard 
heat-induced epitope retrieval method in high pH ER2 buffer (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, 
IL). Staining was visualized using the Dako Envision+ rabbit detection System and Dako DAB 
(Carpinteria, CA). The slides were subsequently counterstained with mayer’s hematoxylin for 1 
minute and coverslipped. Electron microscopy: Apical (1 cube), middle (3 cubes from right, 
middle and left subparts) and basal (3 cubes from right, middle and left subparts) parts of posterior 
wall from each heart (WT: n=3; Mdx+Vehicle: n=3; Mdx+CDC: n=3) were fixed by immersion 
of 1mm3 cubes in 2% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium, and embedded in epon. Sections were 
cut at silver thickness, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed with JEOL 1010 
equipped with AMT digital camera system.   
Western blots 
Western blot analysis was performed to compare abundance of target proteins contributing to Nrf2 
signaling [Nrf2,  phospho-Nrf2 (Nrf2-ps40) and Nrf2 downstream gene products: heme oxygenase-
1 (HO-1), catalase, superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2), and catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine

(Collagen IA1 and collagen IIIA1) and myofiber proliferation and differentiation (Myogenin, 
MyoD and IGF1R). Density of malondialdehyde protein adducts, a marker of oxidative stress, was 
also measured by Western blotting (WB). Samples from apical, middle and basal parts of each 
heart (each 1 mm-thick transverse section) were mixed and homogenized, and nuclear and 
cytoplasmic fractions were extracted per manufacturer’s instructions (CelLytic NuCLEAR

Extraction Kit, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The same kit was applied for extraction of nuclear 
and cytoplasmic fractions from entire soleus muscle, a narrow 3-4 mm wide strip of the left 
midcostal hemidiaphragm and iPSC derived cardiomyocytes. Mitochondria were extracted from 
fresh whole hearts (WT: n=3; Mdx+Vehicle: n=8; Mdx+CDC: n=8) as described in respirometry 
section. Cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial extracts for WB analysis were stored at −80C°. 
The protein concentrations in extracts were determined by the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life 
technologies, Grand Island, NY). Target proteins in the cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial 
fractions were measured by Western blot analysis using the following antibodies: antibodies 
against mouse Nrf2 (C-20; sc-722) , HO-1 (H-105; sc-10789), catalase (H-300; sc-50508), SOD-
2 (FL-222; sc-30080), GCLC (H-338; sc-22755), collagen IA1 (D-13; sc-25974), and collagen 
IIIA1 (S-17; sc-8780-R) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), 
phospho-Nrf2 (Nrf2-ps40; orb34864; Biorbyt, San Francisco, CA), respiratory chain subunits 
(Total OXPHOS Rodent WB Antibody Cocktail antibody; MS604), malondialdehyde (ab27642),

membrane (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in 
blocking buffer (1× TBS, 0.05% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat milk) and then overnight in the same 
buffer containing the given antibodies at optimal dilutions listed in Suppl. Table 1. The membrane 
was washed 3 times for 5 min in 1× TBS, 0.05% Tween-20 before a 2-h incubation in a buffer (1× 
TBS, 0.05% Tween-20 and 3% nonfat milk) containing horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit 
IgG (7074P2), anti-mouse IgG (7076S) [Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, CO] and anti-goat 
IgG (A5420; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 1:1000-3000 dilution. The membrane was washed 
3 times for 5 min in 1 × TBS, 0.05% Tween-20 and developed by autoluminography using the 
ECL chemiluminescent agents (Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Life 
Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Citrate synthase and TBP were used as housekeeping proteins 
against which expressions of the proteins of interest were normalized. Phosphorylated Akt, Nrf2 
and IκB-α were normalized to total Akt, Nrf2 and IκB-α. Western blot analyses of collagen I and 
collagen III were conducted under non-reducing, non-denaturing conditions. 
Statistical analysis  
All pooled data are presented as mean±SEM, except results for alternans data (Fig. 6A) which are 
presented as mean ±SD. Normality and equality of variances of data sets were first tested using 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene's tests, respectively. If both were confirmed, t-test or analysis 
of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test were used for determination of statistical 
significance; if either normality or equality of variances was not assured, nonparametric tests 
(Wilcoxon test or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test) were applied (SPSS II, SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, Illinois). No preliminary data were available for a power analysis. Results from a 
pilot project allowed us to power subsequent studies. The study followed preclinical reporting 
standards, as described (42). Age-matched mice were randomly allocated to experimental groups

using computer generated randomization schedules (https://www.randomizer.org). Conduct of 
experiments and analysis of results and outcomes were performed in a blinded manner (allocation 
concealment and blinded assessment of outcome). There was no post-hoc exclusion of mice or 
data after the analysis before unblinding. 
Ejection Fraction Data 
Preliminary data were collected from a pilot study of 5 animals per group measuring ejection 
fraction at baseline, and again 3 weeks after treatment with cells or vehicle control in mdx and 
corresponding wild-type mice (C57BL/10ScSnJ; Suppl. Table 2). The measured treatment effect 
was approximately 4 units, with a time effect of approximately 1 unit, with group standard 
deviations of 3.5 units. We anticipated larger differences between groups over later time points 
with possible increase in measured variance. Therefore, with 12 animals per treatment group in 
the each of the mdx groups, and 7 wild-type control animals, the study had at least 80% power to 
detect a difference of 4.5 units or greater in treatment effect and 1.4 units or greater in time effect 
in a study design with 6 measurements per animal over time assuming a compound symmetry 
covariance structure, a correlation of 0.7 between measurements within animals over time, and a 
two-sided alpha of 0.05. (Power computed via PASS v. 11.0.). 
Treadmill Data 
Preliminary data were collected from a pilot study of 5 animals per group measuring treadmill 
distance (i.e., the distance ambulated before exhaustion, as described below) at baseline, and again 
3 weeks after treatment with cells or vehicle control in mdx animals and corresponding wild-type 
animals (Suppl. Table 2). The measured treatment effect was approximately 150 meters, with 
limited differences observed over time in untreated groups. Group standard deviations were 
approximately 75 meters, with more variation observed after treatment. We anticipated larger

differences between groups over later time points with possible increase in measured variance. 
Therefore, with 11 animals per treatment group in the each of the transgenic groups, and 7 wild-
type control animals, the study had at least 80% power to detect a difference of 100 meters or 
greater in treatment effect and changes of at least 30 meters over time in a study design with 12 
measurements per animal over time assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure, a 
correlation of 0.7 between measurements within animals over time, and a two-sided alpha of 0.05.

 Figure 1. CDC transplantation into mdx hearts. Function, survival, antioxidant pathways, inflammation and
mitochondrial dysfunction improved by CDC transplantation into mdx mice. A: Ejection fraction (EF) in CDC-injected
mdx mice (Mdx+CDC) and vehicle-injected mdx mice (Mdx+Vehicle) in response to injections at baseline (10 mos of age) and
3 months later (WT: n=7; Mdx+Vehicle & Mdx+CDC: n=12 each). B: Exercise capacity in mice subjected to weekly high-
intensity treadmill exercise, starting 3 weeks after single-dose CDC or vehicle administration (WT: n=7; Mdx+Vehicle &
Mdx+CDC: n=11 each). Cardiac (A) and treadmill (B) experiments were performed separately on different groups of
experimental mice. C: Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in the same animals as B shows lower survival in vehicle-treated mdx
mice than in CDC-treated mdx mice or wild-type controls (p<0.001, log rank test); the latter two groups, however, were
statistically comparable. D: Immunohistochemical images of Nrf2 in mdx mouse hearts 3 weeks after administration of vehicle
or CDCs. Age-matched wild-type mice (WT) served as control. E-I: Western blots and pooled data for protein abundance of
phospho-Akt [Akt-pT308, Akt-pS473, (E)], cytoplasmic phospho-Nrf2 [Nrf2-pS40, (F)], nuclear Nrf2 (G), Nrf2 downstream gene
product, heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1; (H)], and malondialdehyde protein adducts(I) in mdx mouse hearts 3 weeks after
administration of vehicle or CDCs (WT: n=4; Mdx+Vehicle & Mdx+CDC: n=6 each). J: Immunohistochemical images of
hearts stained for inflammatory cell markers CD68, CD20 and CD3; K: Western blots, pooled data and bar graph (lower right)
representing protein abundance of nuclear p65, p-IκB (NF-κB pathway) and MCP1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein1) and
average number of indicated inflammatory cells and in mdx mouse hearts. L: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
from mdx mouse hearts 3 weeks after administration of vehicle (Mdx+Vehicle) or CDCs (Mdx+CDC). Age-matched wild-type
mice (WT) served as control. M&N: Representative western blots and pooled data for mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits
in WT and vehicle/CDC mdx heart tissues (M) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of mitochondria isolated from the hearts of
WT and CDC- or vehicle-treated mdx mice (N) 3 weeks after treatment (WT: n=3; Mdx+Vehicle & Mdx+CDC: n=8 each).
Substrates (pyruvate, malate and ADP), a selective uncoupler (FCCP) and blockers (Oligomycin [Olig.]; Antimycin &
Rotenone [Anti. & Rot.]) of oxidative phosphorylation were applied when indicated. Pooled data are means ± SEM. CM:

 Figure 3. CDC transplantation in mdx hearts conferred beneficial effects on diaphragm and soleus muscles. A: 2-
Dimensional hierarchical clustering using genes with at least 2 times fold change difference between vehicle/CDC mdx
diaphragms. B&C: Western blots and pooled data for protein abundance of malondialdehyde protein adducts (B), cytoplasmic p-
p65 and p-IκB (C; NF-κB pathway; WT: n=4; Vehicle & CDC: n=6 each) and immunohistochemical images of diaphragm stained
for inflammatory cell markers CD20 and CD3; bar graph represents average number of indicated inflammatory cells 3 weeks
after administration of vehicle or CDCs into mdx hearts. D: Representative Masson trichrome images and morphometric analysis
in diaphragms 3 weeks after administration of vehicle or CDCs into the hearts of mdx mice. E-G: in vitro measurement of
diaphragm contractile properties: twitch force (E), maximum tetanic force (F) and specific force (G) 3 weeks after CDC/vehicle
mdx heart treatments. H: 2-Dimensional hierarchical clustering using genes with at least 2 times fold change difference between
vehicle/CDC mdx soleus. I-K: ex vivo measurement of soleus contractile properties: twitch force (I), maximum tetanic force (J)
and absolute force (K) 3 weeks after CDC/vehicle treatment of mdx hearts. L: Correlation of fold changes in expression of same
genes in diaphragm and soleus 3 weeks after intramyocardial CDC injection in mdx mice. M: Three-dimensional plot depicting
principal components analysis (PCA) of RNA-seq expression data from exosomes isolated from hypoxic conditioned media and
effluents of CDC- or vehicle-treated mdx hearts. The effluent of isolated mdx hearts undergoing Langendorff perfusion was
collected for exosomes isolation and subsequent RNA-seq 3 days after intramyocardial CDC/vehicle injection. PCA analysis
showed clustering of CDC-exosomes (red) with exosomes isolated from effluent of CDC mdx hearts (blue), but not vehicle-
injected mdx hearts (stippled), indicating that CDC-exosomes were shed from mdx hearts at least 3 days after intramyocardial
CDC injection. Effluents of mdx hearts from same group were pooled (n=3 for each group). Data are means ± SEM; *P<0.05 vs.
Mdx+CDC; †P<0.05 vs. Mdx+CDC and WT (wild type mice).

 Figure 4. Systemic CDC-exosome injection mimicked the cardiac and the remote effects of intramyocardial CDC injection
in mdx mice. A: Systemic biodistribution of CDC-exosomes after intraventricular injection in mdx mice. CDC-exosomes were
stained with fluorescent lipid dye and tracked 6 hours later using bioluminescence imaging. B: 2-Dimensional hierarchical
clustering using genes from hearts of non-treated mdx mice and of mdx mice treated intramyocardially with CDCs or
intraventricularly with CDC-exosomes. Genes with at least 2-fold differences with corresponding transcripts in non-treated mdx
mice were included. C: Correlation of fold changes in expression of same genes 3 weeks after intramyocardial CDC injection or
intraventricular CDC-exosome injection in mdx hearts. D&E: EF and exercise capacity in mdx mice 3 weeks after intraventricular
injection of vehicle/CDC-exosome (WT: n=5; Mdx+Vehicle & Mdx+CDC-exosome: n=9 each). F: 2-Dimensional hierarchical
clustering using genes from diaphragm of non-treated mdx mice and of mdx mice treated intramyocardially with CDCs or
intraventricularly with CDC-exosomes. Genes with at least 2-fold differences with corresponding genes in non-treated mdx mice
were included. G: Correlation of fold changes in expression of the same genes in diaphragm 3 weeks after intramyocardial CDC
injection or intraventricular CDC-exosomes injection. H: diaphragm contractile properties 3 weeks after intraventricular CDC-
exosome injection. I-K: 2-Dimensional hierarchical clustering (I), correlation analysis (J) and contractile properties (K) from
soleus muscle 3 weeks after intraventricular CDC-exosome injection. Data are means ± SEM; *P<0.05 vs. Mdx+CDC-exosome;
†P<0.05 vs. Mdx+CDC-exosome and WT (wild type mice).

 Figure 5. Intramuscular injection of CDC-exosomes resulted in muscle growth and reversal of pathophysiological
abnormalities. A: H&E and immunohistochemical images of soleus muscle stained for MyoD (WT [wild type], vehicle and CDC-
exosome-treated [Mdx (exosome)] mdx mouse soleus).
Arrows in H&E images point to the lined up nuclei (left column) and
myofibers (right column). In the immunohistochemistry, linearly-arranged nuclei were positive for MyoD (middle column). B&C:
Frequency distribution of myofiber sizes and number of myoblasts (MyoD+) 3 weeks after vehicle/CDC-exosome injection in mdx
soleus muscles (WT: n=5; Vehicle & Exosome: n=9 each). D-F: Western blots and pooled data for protein abundance of MyoD,
myogenin (D), IGF1 receptor (IGF1R; E) and cytoplasmic p-p65 (F) in mdx soleus muscles 3 weeks after intrasoleus vehicle/CDC-
exosome injection (WT: n=4; Vehicle & Exosome: n=6 each). G: Representative Masson trichrome images (enlarged in fig. S17) and
morphometric analysis in mdx soleus muscles 3 weeks after administration of vehicle or CDC-exosomes into mdx soleus (WT: n=5;
Vehicle & Exosome: n=9 each). H: ex vivo measurement of soleus contractile properties: twitch force and absolute force 3 weeks
after vehicle/CDC-exosome injection into mdx soleus muscles. Pooled data are means ± SEM. *P<0.05 vs. Mdx+CDC-exosome;
†P<0.05 vs. Mdx+CDC-exosome and WT (wild type mice); ‡P<0.002 vs. Mdx+vehicle and WT (wild type mice). Scale bars: 5 µm
(A, right column, 10µm (A, middle column), 50 µm (A, left column), 200 µm (G), 20 µm (H).

 Figure 6. CDC-exosomes in human Duchenne cardiomyocytes derived from iPS cells. A: Calcium transients from normal
and DMD CM measured during 1Hz burst pacing. Duchenne cardiomyocytes were primed with vehicle or CDC exosomes
(exosomes) 1 week before assessment. Bar graphs of calcium transient alternans (variation in beat-to-beat calcium transient
amplitude) and time to peak. B: Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in DMD CM primed with CDC-exosomes or exosomes from
normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF, as control; NHDF-exosome) 1 week before OCR measurement. Normal (CTL) and
non-treated DMD CM (vehicle) were studied in parallel. See Fig. 1 legend for abbreviations. All data are means ± SEM except
for the box plot (means ± SD). *P<0.002 vs. CDC-exosome and CTL (Normal cardiomyocyte); #P<0.03 vs. CDC-exosome and
CTL (Normal cardiomyocyte); ¶ P<0.02 vs. CDC-exosome.
