Abstract
Background: Early age at menarche is associated with increased breast cancer risk. Red meat consumption in
adolescence predicts breast cancer risk, but it is unknown whether it is also related to earlier menarche.
Objective: We studied the association between intake of red meat at ages 5–12 y and age at menarche in a prospective
study.
Methods: We assessed usual diets with a food-frequency questionnaire in a group of 456 girls aged 8.4 6 1.7 y and
followed them for a median 5.6 y in Bogot´
a, Colombia. Girls were asked periodically about the occurrence and date of
menarche. Median age at menarche was estimated with use of Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities by categories of red
meat intake frequency. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the incidence of menarche by red meat
intake frequency, adjusting for potential sociodemographic and dietary confounders including total energy intake and
intake frequency of other animal food groups (dairy, poultry, freshwater fish, tuna/sardines, eggs, and innards).
Results: Median age at menarche was 12.4 y. After adjustment for total energy intake, maternal parity, and
socioeconomic status, red meat intake frequency was inversely associated with age at menarche. When compared with
girls with red meat intake <4 times/wk, those consuming it $2 times/d had a significantly earlier age at menarche (HR:
1.64; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.41; P-trend = 0.0009). Incidentally, we found that girls with tuna/sardine intake >1 time/wk had a
significantly later age at menarche (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.90; P = 0.01) than those with intake <1 time/mo. Intake
frequency of other animal food groups was not significantly associated with age at menarche.
Conclusion: Higher red meat intake frequency during childhood is associated with an earlier age at menarche, whereas
greater fatty fish intake frequency is associated with a later menarcheal age.

Introduction
Menarche, the first menstrual period, is a recognizable marker of
puberty. An early age at menarche is associated with breast (1)
and endometrial (2) cancers, obesity (3), type II diabetes (4),
cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality (5). In addition,
early menarche has been related to risk factors during adoles-
cence including alcohol and tobacco use, early sexual debut, and
teenage pregnancy (6, 7).
There is substantial variability in the timing of menarche
across populations and a secular trend toward earlier menarche
within countries (8–10). This suggests that the timing of puberty
may be responsive to changes in environmental conditions.
Although the exact nature of these changes remains uncertain,
epidemiological studies have found associations between high
intake of animal protein during childhood and earlier puberty
(11–17). For example, total animal protein intake between ages 3
and 8 y was related to earlier menarche in US (11) and German
(12) girls. Intake of protein from dairy was related to earlier
puberty in girls from Germany (12), Iran (15), and the United
States (16), whereas higher meat intake in childhood was
associated with earlier menarche in British (13), Korean (14),
and US (17) girls. There is some heterogeneity in this evidence,
however, because a recent study in a large group of US girls found
no association between dairy or meat intake at ages 9–14 y and
age at menarche (18). One possible explanation for this discrep-
ancy is differences in the timing of dietary assessments (13, 18),
because intake around the time of puberty onset may be less
relevant than earlier childhood diet. Relatively few studies, to our
knowledge, have examined childhood intake of specific animal
food groups in relation to menarche.

 A recent investigation found that red meat intake during
adolescence was related to higher breast cancer risk (19).
Considering that early menarche is a predictor of breast cancer
(1), we hypothesized that red meat intake during childhood
could be associated with an earlier menarche.
We evaluated the association between frequency of red meat
intake at 5–12 y with age at menarche in a prospective study of
premenarcheal school-age girls from Bogot´
a, Colombia.
Methods
Study population. The study was conducted in the context of the Bogot´
a
School Children Cohort, an ongoing longitudinal investigation of nutrition
and health in school-age children. Details concerning recruitment and data
collection are published elsewhere (20). Briefly, in February 2006 we
randomly sampled children from all public primary schools in Bogot´
a.
Inclusion criteria involved being enrolled in 1 of the city�s 361 public
primary schools at the time by the beginning of the school year and being
between 5 and 12 y of age. Four thousand children were invited to
participate, of whom 3202 agreed and were enrolled in the cohort. Because
most children in the public school system were from low- and middle-
income families, the cohort represents these socioeconomic strata.
Information collected at the time of enrollment included diet, anthropom-
etry, and sociodemographic characteristics and health status.
Dietary assessment. Between May and June 2006, trained dietitians
administered a 38-item FFQ to a sample of 1027 mothers to 531 girls
and 496 boys who attended parents� meetings at schools in order to
obtain information on their children�s usual intake. Details of
the FFQ have been described previously (21). The FFQ was based on the
most frequently consumed foods in this population according to the
Colombian National Nutrition Survey 2005 and included all major
sources of energy in the population. For each item, we described
reference portion sizes in natural units or standard measures for
commonly consumed servings among children in this population, and
inquired about frequency of intake with a scale comprising 9 options: 4–
5 times/d, 2–3 times/d, 1 time/d, 5–6 times/wk, 2–4 times/wk, 1 time/wk,
1–3 times/mo, <1 time/mo, or never. Energy intakes were estimated by
multiplying the consumption frequency of each food by the energy
contents of the specific portion using composition values from the
USDA’s Standard Reference food composition database, supplemented
with data from manufacturers and published reports (Food Processor
software; http://www.esha.com) and the Food Composition Table of
Colombian Foods by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (22). A
team composed of Colombian and US dietitians worked together on the
nutrient composition analyses to ensure that the foods chosen from the
USDA database resembled the closest to the local foods.
Although the FFQ has not been formally validated, a previous
investigation that included the girls in the current study provided strong
evidence for its validity to measure intake frequency of animal food
sources (21). In that study, principal component analyses of the FFQ
clearly identified an ‘‘animal foods’’ dietary pattern that included
frequent intake of beef, chicken, and dairy. Adherence to this pattern
was strongly, positively, and linearly related to serum concentrations of
vitamin B-12, a nutrient that is naturally found in animal foods only. In
addition, meat intake frequency alone, as measured by the FFQ, was
linearly and monotonically related to serum vitamin B-12. Among
children reporting meat intake $2 times/d, serum vitamin B-12 was
24 pmol/L higher than in children with meat intake <4 times/wk (P-trend =
0.04), after adjustment for sex and intake frequency of dairy, fish, cow
liver, and supplements. Because measurement errors in the FFQ and the
serum vitamin B-12 values are uncorrelated, the findings indicate that the
validity of the FFQ to measure animal foods is adequate.
Anthropometry. In the weeks following enrollment, trained research
assistants visited the schools to obtain anthropometric measurements from
the children. Weight was measured in light clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg
on Tanita HS301 electronic scales (Tanita Arlington Heights, Illinois), and
height was measured without shoes to the nearest 1 mm with wall-
mounted Seca 202 stadiometers (Seca, Hanover, Maryland). We calculated
height-for-age and BMI (in kg/m2)-for-age z scores, with the use of the
WHO sex-specific growth references for children aged 5–19 (23).
Parental and household characteristics. Information on parental and
household characteristics was obtained with the use of a self-administered
questionnaire that was sent to each child�s home during the week of
enrollment. The questionnaire inquired about parental age, education
level, mother�s parity and age at menarche, and the child�s health habits,
including time watching television or playing video games and playing
outdoors. Socioeconomic status was determined from the child�s home
address, as the score assigned by the local government to establish the cost
of public services. Maternal BMI was calculated from height and weight
values that the research team measured at the time of FFQ administration,
using the same methods described for the children. Measured values were
available in 80% of mothers; self-reported values were used in the rest.
Covariates were categorized as presented in Table 1.
Follow-up. Follow-up visits occurred in June and November 2006 and
once yearly thereafter. If children were absent from school on the day of
the visit, they were assessed at home. At each assessment, girls were
asked if they had begun menstruation and, if they had, the date of their
first menstrual period. Major holidays and school vacation time were
used to aid the girls� recall of the date of menarche, if needed.
Written informed consent from parents or primary caregivers of all
children was obtained before enrollment. The study protocol was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the National University of
Colombia Medical School. The Institutional Review Board at the
University of Michigan approved the use of data from the study.
Data analysis. Sixty-six girls who had >5 missing responses in the FFQ
were excluded. Of the remaining 465 girls with valid FFQ data, 9 had
experienced menarche by the time of enrollment and were excluded.
Thus, the analytic sample consisted of 456 girls.
The primary exposure was frequency of red meat intake. This was the
sum of weighted intake frequencies of 3 separate items in the FFQ: beef/
pork/veal/lamb, cold cuts (sausages/ham/bologna), and hamburger/hot
dog. The frequency was categorized as <4 times/wk, 4–6 times/wk,
1 time/d, and $2 times/d. Because red meat is eaten as part of an animal
food source pattern in this population (21), intake of other animal foods
could confound the association with age at menarche; therefore, we also
considered intake frequency of dairy (milk, cheese, and yogurt), poultry,
freshwater fish, canned tuna or sardines (main sources of fatty fish in the
population, asked together in a single FFQ item), eggs, and innards
(cow�s liver, spleen, lung, and tripe). Innards were treated separately
because the items in the red meat category are typically more highly
processed than innards. Furthermore, innards are not consumed as
frequently as items in the red meat group, and as a result their intake may
be measured with more error than other meats.
The outcome, age at menarche, was estimated in decimal years as date
of menarche minus date of birth. Among 75 girls (16.5%) who did not
recall the day of the month when menarche occurred, the 15th was
imputed. In another 33 girls (7.2%) who only remembered the year of
menarche, July 1 was imputed for the calculation of age at menarche. Each
girl�s mother was the primary informant of the date of menarche in 67
participants (14.7%). Twenty-six percent of girls (n = 119) did not have
menarche during follow-up and were censored at the last interview date.
To identify potential confounders, we examined the associations of
baseline sociodemographic characteristics and age at menarche using time-
to-event analyses. Time-to-event analytic techniques including the Kaplan-
Meier method and Cox regression properly account for right censoring in
the data because some girls did not reach menarche during follow-up.
These methods allow for information on menarcheal age from post-
menarcheal girls to be combined with the last known age during follow-up
when menarche had not occurred (‘‘censoring’’) from premenarcheal girls.
We estimated median ages at menarche by categories of sociodemographic
correlates using Kaplan-Meier cumulative probabilities. Values in the text
are medians (IQRs). Cox proportional hazards models were used to
estimate HRs and 95% CIs, with decimal age as the time scale.

 We next examined the distribution of the sociodemographic correlates
across levels of red meat intake frequency. For continuous correlates, we
estimated tests for linear trend from linear regression models in which a
variable representing ordinal categories of red meat intake was introduced
as a continuous predictor. We used robust estimates of the variance in these
models to overcome potential deviations from the multivariate normality
assumption (24). For categorical correlates, we used Cochran-Armitage
tests. We also estimated the correlations (Spearman) of red meat intake
frequency with that of other animal food groups.
In bivariate analysis, we estimated median ages of menarche and HRs
with 95% CI by intake frequency categories of red meat and other
animal food groups using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
We conducted tests of linear trend for the associations between intake
frequency of each food group and menarche by introducing into each
Cox model a variable representing ordinal categories of intake frequency
as a continuous predictor and performing a Wald test.
Finally, we conducted multivariable analyses of the association
between red meat intake frequency and age at menarche by fitting a Cox
proportional hazards model that included as covariates sociodemographic
characteristics that were independent predictors of menarche, other
relevant animal food groups, and total energy intake. Height-for-age and
BMI-for-age z scores were deliberately excluded from the multivariable
model because they could be mediators on the causal pathway between
red meat intake and age at menarche (25). The proportional hazards
assumption was verified with the use of terms for the interaction between
time and covariates. This assumption was met in all models.
Because there were missing values in some covariates, we conducted
supplemental analyses in which these missing values were estimated using
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation technique (26) before
their inclusion in the multivariable models. Results from 10 multiple
imputation cycles were combined with the use of the PROC MIANALYZE
routine of SAS Software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Although our primary aim was to estimate the total effect of red meat
intake on age at menarche, we conducted additional supplemental

 analyses to ascertain the potential mediating effect of BMI-for-age
by introducing it as a covariate into the multivariable models. These
analyses assumed a lack of interaction between frequency of intake and
BMI-for-age on age at menarche and no unmeasured confounding of the
association between BMI-for-age and age at menarche (27). Results were
considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.
Results
The mean age 6 SD of girls at recruitment was 8.4 6 1.7 y. Their
mean 6 SD red meat intake frequency was 1.3 6 1.2 times/d.
Mean total energy intake was 1478 6 718 kcal/d. The median
length of follow-up was 5.6 y (IQR 2.6–6.8 y). It was shorter for
girls who were censored (median 2.5 y; IQR 1.7–4.0 y) than for
those who had menarche during follow-up (median 6.2 y; IQR
5.2–6.8 y). Nevertheless, the 2 groups did not differ from
each other with respect to frequency of red meat intake, age,
socioeconomic status, or BMI-for-age.
The estimated median age at menarche was 12.4 y (IQR 12.2
to 12.5 y). Girls� baseline height-for-age z scores, BMI-for-age z
scores, and socioeconomic status were inversely associated with
age at menarche, whereas maternal age at menarche and parity
were positively associated with age at menarche (Table 1).
Red meat intake frequency was positively related to height-
for-age and BMI-for-age z scores, total energy intake, and
socioeconomic status and inversely associated with maternal
parity (Table 2). Red meat intake frequency also correlated with
dairy (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) and poultry (r = 0.44, P < 0.0001)
frequency of intake (Supplemental Table 1).
In bivariate analysis, red meat intake frequency was inversely
associated with age at menarche (Table 3). When compared with
girls with red meat intake <4 times/wk, those with intake
$2 times/d had a significantly earlier age at menarche (HR: 1.41;
95% CI: 1.02, 1.95; P-trend = 0.04). We also noted that intake
frequency of canned tuna/sardines was positively related to age at
menarche in a nonlinear manner; girls with intake $1 time/mo had
a significantly later age at menarche than girls with tuna/sardine
intake <1 time/mo (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98; P = 0.03).
After adjustment for total energy intake, maternal parity,
and socioeconomic status, red meat intake frequency remained
linearly associated with age at menarche (Table 3). When
compared with girls with red meat intake <4 times/wk, those
consuming it $2 times/d had a significantly earlier age at
menarche (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.41; P-trend = 0.0009).
On the other hand, when compared with girls with tuna/sardine
intake <1 time/mo, those with intake >1 time/wk had a later age at
menarche (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.90; P = 0.01). Results
remained essentially unchanged after additional adjustment for
dairy and poultry intake frequencies, maternal age at menarche,
and time spent playing outdoors. Similarly, using multiple
imputation of missing covariate values did not change the results.
In supplemental mediation analyses, introducing BMI-for-age
z scores at baseline into the multivariable imputed model resulted
in an attenuation of the estimates for red meat. When compared
to that of an intake frequency <4 times/wk, the adjusted HRs
(95% CI) for categories 4–6 times/wk, 1 time/d, and $2 times/d
were, respectively, 1.16 (0.85, 1.60), 1.17 (0.85, 1.62), and 1.33
(0.90, 1.96) (P-trend = 0.17). The estimates for intake frequency
of tuna/sardines did not change.
Intake frequency of other animal food groups including dairy,
poultry, eggs, freshwater fish, or innards was not significantly
associated with age at menarche in bivariate (Supplemental Table
2) or multivariable adjusted (Supplemental Table 3) analyses.

Red meat and menarche

 in a linear fashion. This relation was independent of potential
sociodemographic and dietary confounders. Unexpectedly, we
also found that canned tuna/sardine intake frequency was
positively associated with age at menarche.
Although earlier studies had reported associations be-
tween intake of animal foods and age at menarche (11–17), our
study substantially extends previous findings by examining
intake frequency of specific categories of animal food sources in
midchildhood. The association of red meat intake frequency and
age at menarche is generally consistent with previous studies that
linked prepubertal consumption of animal protein and food
sources to earlier puberty (11–17). Nevertheless, it is opposite to
findings from an investigation of US girls in which intake of red
meat at ages 9–14 y was not associated with age at menarche (18).
One reason for the discrepancy could be related to the timing of
the dietary assessment. Whereas dietary assessment in our study
occurred in girls with a mean age of 8 y, girls in the US study had a
mean age of 11 y at baseline and were much closer to the timing of
menarche. Some authors have proposed that diet at younger ages
may be more important for the timing of puberty than peripubertal
intake (13). In fact, some argue that the timing of puberty is
determined by environmental conditions acting as early as around
the time of birth (28). This is not necessarily contrary to our
findings if we assume that diet tracks during childhood. Addi-
tionally, reverse causation bias could have affected the results of
the US study because the dietary exposures were assessed within a
short period with respect to the outcome. Because menarche is a
relatively late event during sexual development, girls may have
initiated puberty at the time of dietary assessment, and their diet
might have changed as a consequence (18).
One pathway to explain potential effects of animal foods,
particularly dairy, on the timing of puberty has been related to a
protein-mediated stimulation of insulin-like growth factor I
secretion (29, 30). However, meat intake has not been related to
insulin-like growth factor I secretion, and there could be other
plausible mechanisms. Availability of micronutrients found in red
meat such as iron and zinc could signal the body to initiate puberty
because these nutrients are essential for sustaining pregnancy and
for the offspring�s survival and development. In a small randomized
trial, zinc supplementation resulted in earlier age at menarche (31).
Another mechanism could be through the development of adipos-
ity. Childhood obesity is related to early menarche (25), and intake
of some foods in the red meats group, including hot dogs and
hamburgers, was related to children overweight in this population
(32). In supplemental mediation analyses, the association of red
meat intake frequency with age at menarche was attenuated after
adjustment for BMI-for-age z score at baseline, suggesting that part
of the effect of red meat on age at menarche could be mediated
through body size. There are also other potential mechanisms
related to substances ingested with red meat, including estrogenic
mycotoxins such as zearalenone (33, 34) or heterocyclic amines
produced during preparation of red meat at high temperatures (34).
Previous investigations have consistently shown an associa-
tion between early onset of menses and breast cancer in
adulthood (1). Also, red meat intake during adolescence has
been related to premenopausal breast cancer risk (19). Our
finding suggests a potential mechanism to explain these rela-
tions, in that early age at menarche could be a mediator on the
causal pathway between adolescent red meat intake during
childhood and breast cancer risk.
Of note, we incidentally found that tuna/sardine intake
frequency was related to a later age at menarche. Two previous
studies that examined associations between fish intake and age at
menarche found no relation (35, 36). Although the finding in our
study could have been due to chance, there are potential underlying
mechanisms to explain it. Tuna and sardines are rich in long-chain
PUFAs, which are related to more favorable cardiovascular profiles
in adolescents (37), including slower weight gain (38).
Our study has several strengths. First, its longitudinal design
precluded bias due to reverse causation. The prospective

 collection of data on age at menarche prevented recall bias. Any
misclassification of the outcome is unlikely to be differential
with respect to exposure status. In addition, follow-up was high.
Other strengths include the ability to examine different ani-
mal food groups and the possibility to adjust for important
confounders. Adjusted HRs for red meat intake frequency
became stronger than the unadjusted estimates after controlling
for negative confounding by tuna/sardine intake. The associa-
tion of tuna/sardine intake frequency was strengthened in
multivariable analyses after controlling for negative confound-
ing by red meat intake and maternal parity. We assessed intake
using an FFQ that measures animal food intake validly (21). Our
data were internally consistent considering that the associations
of age at menarche with known predictors of puberty were in the
expected directions. Red meat intake was also positively
associated with height, BMI, total energy intake, and socioeco-
nomic status as expected in this population. Finally, we
accounted for missing data in the analysis using state-of-the-
art multiple imputation techniques.
The study also has some limitations. First, the results may not
be generalizable to girls of the highest socioeconomic levels.
Second, unmeasured intake of foods or nutrients that are
associated with red meat intake and are independent predictors of
age at menarche [e.g., fiber, isoflavones (39, 40)] could have
introduced residual confounding. Third, misclassification of
exposure due to measurement errors in the FFQ could have
been a source of bias. Because the FFQ was administered to the
girls� mothers, intake of foods eaten away from home may have
been underestimated. Measurement error in the report of diet is
likely not associated with the recall of age at menarche; thus, its
potential consequence could be an attenuation of the true
underlying effect. Fourth, some girls were lost to follow-up, and
this could potentially introduce selection bias. Fifth, we could
not account for potential changes in diet after the childhood
measurement. Sixth, we were unable to examine associations of
micronutrients present in red meat with age at menarche. Finally,
although the short-term recall of age at menarche is highly reliable
(41), the effects of diet on earlier events of puberty may differ
from those on menarche. It is uncertain whether they represent
effects on the onset rather than the duration of puberty.
In summary, red meat intake frequency during childhood was
inversely associated with age at menarche, whereas fatty fish
intake frequency was positively associated with age at onset of
menses. Future studies should examine the role of particular
components of red meat, including micronutrients and by-
products of processing, on the timing of sexual maturation.
Examining the role of fish intake and the timing of puberty in
other populations is also warranted. Whether replacing red meat
with other animal food sources influences age at menarche
would need to be determined in intervention studies.
