Abstract
Background: Discretionary screen time (time spent viewing a television or computer screen during leisure time) is
an important contributor to total sedentary behaviour, which is associated with increased risk of mortality and
cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to determine whether the associations of screen time
with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were modified by levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength or
physical activity.
Methods: In total, 390,089 participants (54% women) from the UK Biobank were included in this study. All-cause
mortality, CVD and cancer incidence and mortality were the main outcomes. Discretionary television (TV) viewing, personal
computer (PC) screen time and overall screen time (TV + PC time) were the exposure variables. Grip strength, fitness and
physical activity were treated as potential effect modifiers.
Results: Altogether, 7420 participants died, and there were 22,210 CVD events, over a median of 5.0 years follow-up
(interquartile range 4.3 to 5.7; after exclusion of the first 2 years from baseline in the landmark analysis). All discretionary
screen-time exposures were significantly associated with all health outcomes. The associations of overall discretionary
screen time with all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD and cancer were strongest amongst participants in the lowest
tertile for grip strength (all-cause mortality hazard ratio per 2-h increase in screen time (1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.
22–1.43], p < 0.0001; CVD 1.21 [1.13–1.30], p = 0.0001; cancer incidence 1.14 [1.10–1.19], p < 0.0001) and weakest
amongst those in the highest grip-strength tertile (all-cause mortality 1.04 [0.95–1.14], p = 0.198; CVD 1.05 [0.99–1.11],
p = 0.070; cancer 0.98 [0.93–1.05], p = 0.771). Similar trends were found for fitness (lowest fitness tertile: all-cause
mortality 1.23 [1.13–1.34], p = 0.002 and CVD 1.10 [1.02–1.22], p = 0.010; highest fitness tertile: all-cause mortality 1.12 [0.
96–1.28], p = 0.848 and CVD 1.01 [0.96–1.07], p = 0.570). Similar findings were found for physical activity for all-cause
mortality and cancer incidence.

Conclusions: The associations between discretionary screen time and adverse health outcomes were strongest in
those with low grip strength, fitness and physical activity and markedly attenuated in those with the highest levels of
grip strength, fitness and physical activity. Thus, if these associations are causal, the greatest benefits from health
promotion interventions to reduce discretionary screen time may be seen in those with low levels of strength, fitness
and physical activity.

Background
Low levels of physical activity [1] and high levels of seden-
tary behaviour (overall sitting and discretionary television
viewing and computer use) [2–4] both have strong associa-
tions with a number of adverse health outcomes, including
mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is also
strong evidence that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness
[5] and muscular strength [6–9] are associated with similar
adverse health outcomes. It has been suggested that the as-
sociations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with
health outcomes are largely independent [1, 2, 10]. How-
ever, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the adverse ef-
fects of sitting time and television (TV) viewing on
mortality were not observed in individuals with high levels
of physical activity [10]. This observation indicates that the
risks associated with sedentary behaviour are not ubiqui-
tous, since individuals with low physical activity experience
the greatest adverse effects. Using data from UK Biobank,
which includes almost 500,000 participants with data on
grip strength and over 60,000 participants with data on car-
diorespiratory fitness, we recently reported that the adverse
association of low levels of physical activity with mortality
and CVD events are substantially stronger in individuals
with low levels of grip strength and/or cardiorespiratory fit-
ness. This impies that the benefits of physical activity may
be greatest amongst individuals with lower levels of func-
tional capacity, but relatively modest in those with already
high levels of functional capacity, who were at low risk irre-
spective of physical activity levels [9]. This has implications
for public health guidance, as it suggests that specifically
targeting those with low fitness and strength to increase
their physical activity levels may be an effective approach to
reduce population risk [9]. We hypothesised that a similar
pattern would be evident for discretionary screen-time be-
haviours such as TV viewing and personal computer (PC)
screen time, with the adverse effects of high levels of screen
time being greatest in those with low levels of strength, fit-
ness and physical activity [10].
The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine
whether the associations of screen time (TV viewing plus
PC screen time) with mortality and CVD and cancer inci-
dence was moderated by grip strength, cardiorespiratory
fitness and physical activity using data from UK Bio-
bank—a large prospective population-based study. Screen
time (i.e. time spent viewing a TV or PC screen during
leisure time), which represents a substantial proportion of
total sedentary behaviour during leisure time [11, 12], was
used as a measure of screen-time-related behaviours.
Methods
Study design
Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank
recruited 502,655 participants (5.5% response rate), aged
40–69 years, from the general population [13]. Partici-
pants attended one of 22 assessment centres across
England, Wales and Scotland [14, 15], where they com-
pleted a touch-screen questionnaire, had physical mea-
surements taken and provided biological samples, as
described in detail elsewhere [14, 15]. In this prospective
population-based study, all-cause mortality, CVD inci-
dence and mortality, and cancer incidence and mortality
were the main outcomes. The duration of overall discre-
tionary screen time (TV viewing plus leisure PC screen
time), and TV viewing and leisure PC screen time separ-
ately were the exposures of interest. Socio-demographic
factors (age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index,
professional qualifications, income and employment),
smoking status, body mass index (BMI) categories, phys-
ical activity, grip strength, sleep duration and dietary in-
take were treated as potential confounders, as were
systolic blood pressure, medication history for glucose,
cholesterol and blood pressure as well as prevalent dia-
betes and hypertension at baseline. Grip strength, car-
diorespiratory fitness and physical activity were treated
as potential effect modifiers. To minimise potential re-
verse causality, all analyses were conducted using a land-
mark analysis excluding events occurring in the first
2 years of follow-up. Moreover, participants with base-
line medical diagnoses of depression, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic asthma, chronic
liver diseases, alcohol problems, substance abuse, eating
disorders, schizophrenia, cognitive impartment, Parkin-
son’s disease, dementia, chronic pain syndrome, heart
diseases or cancer were excluded (n = 103,755).
Procedures
Date of death was obtained from death certificates held by
the National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre
Celis-Morales et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:77 
Page 2 of 14
 (England and Wales) and the NHS Central Register
Scotland (Scotland). Date and cause of hospital admis-
sions were identified via record linkage to Health Episode
Statistics (England and Wales) and to the Scottish Mor-
bidity Records (Scotland). Detailed information regarding
the linkage procedure can be found at http://biobank.ct-
su.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=2000. At the time of ana-
lysis, mortality data were available up to 31 January 2016.
The mortality analysis was, therefore, censored at this date
or date of death if this occurred earlier. Hospital admis-
sion data were available until 31 March 2015, resulting in
disease-specific analyses being censored at this date, or
the date of hospital admission or death if these occurred
earlier. Follow-up information on cancer was obtained via
linkage to three routine administrative databases, death cer-
tificates, hospital admissions and cancer registrations, with
complete follow-up available until 31 March 2015. CVD
was defined as a hospital admission or death with ICD-10
code I05-I89.9. All-cause cancer was defined as an ICD-10
code of C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9 or D4.0-8.
At baseline assessment, screen time and physical activ-
ity were recorded among participants recruited from
August 2009 using a touch-screen, self-completed ques-
tionnaire. Participants were asked: ‘In a typical day, how
many hours do you spend watching TV?’ They were also
asked about time spent using a computer: ‘In a typical
day, how many hours do you spend using the computer?
(Do not include using a computer at work)'. For this
study, we derived a discretionary screen-time variable
that combined TV viewing and leisure PC screen time in
hours per day.
Physical activity was based on the International Phys-
ical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form [16], with
participants reporting the frequency and duration of
walking and moderate and vigorous activity undertaken
in a typical week [16]. Data were analysed in accordance
with the IPAQ scoring protocol [17] and total physical
activity was computed as the sum of walking and moder-
ate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equiva-
lent (MET, hours/week). Participants were excluded
from the analyses if they recorded implausible values,
that is, if the sum of their total physical activity, sleeping
time and total screen time exceeded 24 h (n = 705 partic-
ipants were excluded) [9].
Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hy-
draulic hand dynamometer and the mean of three mea-
surements for each hand were used. Grip strength was
measured in kilograms. Fitness test data were introduced
into UK Biobank from August 2009, so these data are
available only in a subgroup of 74,836 participants. In
these individuals, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed
using a sub-maximal 6-min incremental ramp cycle erg-
ometer test with workload calculated according to age,
height, weight, resting heart rate and sex, and heart rate
monitored via a four-lead electrocardiogram, as previ-
ously reported, with the aim of achieving a final work
rate of 50% of predicted maximal power [9]. Tests were
terminated
if
heart
rate
exceeded
75%
of
the
age-predicted maximum. In individuals with systolic
blood pressure between 160 and 179 mmHg or diastolic
blood pressure between 95 and 109 mmHg or who an-
swered ‘yes’ or ‘unsure’ to the question ‘Has a doctor
ever said that you have a heart condition and should
only do physical activity recommended by a doctor’
, the
test protocol was modified to achieve a final work rate
of 35% of predicted maximal power (n = 8932). Fitness
was not measured in individuals who were not able to
walk or cycle unaided for 10 min, were pregnant or had
high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg
or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg) (n = 358) or if
the equipment failed (n = 643). The work rate at max-
imal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the
pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero watts) and
the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test to the
age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 × age) [18]
assuming a linear relationship [19]. The linear nature of
the work rate vs heart rate relationship means that the
estimated maximal work rate for an individual should be
independent of the work rate achieved during the exer-
cise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart
rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the
relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxy-
gen uptake (in ml.kg− 1.min− 1) = 7 + (10.8 × work rate (in
watts))/body
mass
(in
kilograms))
[20]
and
then
expressed in terms of maximal MET (where 1 MET ≡
3.5 ml.kg− 1.min− 1).
Dietary information was collected via a self-reported
dietary questionnaire (Oxford WebQ) [21, 22]. Partici-
pants were asked how many portions of specified foods
they generally ate. Subjective sleep duration was obtained
by asking: ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in
every 24 hours?’ Based on the answer, we derived a cat-
egorical sleep duration variable (short sleeper <7 h.day− 1,
normal sleeper 7–9 h.day− 1 or long sleeper >9 h.day− 1).
Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from post-
code of residence using the Townsend score, which is de-
rived from census data on housing, employment, social
class and car availability [23]. Other socio-demographic
information such as employment (paid employment, re-
tired, unable to work, unemployed, student and other),
professional qualifications (college or university, A or O
levels, GCSE, CSEs or equivalent levels) and income
(<£18,000,
£18,000–29,999,
£30,000–51,999,
£52,000–
100,000 and >£100,000) were self-reported at baseline.
Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline as-
sessment. Ethnicity was self-reported and smoking status
was categorised into never, former and current smoking.
Medical history (physician diagnosis of long-standing

 illness, depression, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction,
hypertension, cancer and diabetes) and medication history
(for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension) were collected
from the self-completed baseline assessment question-
naire. Height, body weight and waist circumference were
measured by trained nurses during the baseline assess-
ment. Body composition (percentage body fat) was mea-
sured using standardised bio-impedance protocols. BMI
was calculated as (weight/height2) and the World Health
Organization criteria [24] were used to classify BMI into
underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5–24.9, overweight
25.0–29.9 and obese ≥30.0 kg.m− 2. Central obesity was
defined
as
waist
circumference >88
cm
for
women
and >102
cm
for
men.

Statistical analyses
The associations between hours of overall discretionary
screen time, TV viewing and PC screen time per day and
health outcomes were explored using Cox-proportional
hazard models with years of follow-up as the time scale.
Analyses were performed for the following outcomes:
all-cause mortality and CVD and cancer incidence (fatal
and non-fatal combined) and mortality. All analyses
were performed as a landmark analysis with follow-up
commenced 2 years after recruitment and including par-
ticipants who were event-free at this time. In addition,
participants
with
comorbidities
(depression,
COPD,
chronic asthma, chronic liver diseases, alcohol problems,
substance abuse, eating disorders, schizophrenia, cogni-
tive impartment, Parkinson, dementia, chronic pain syn-
drome, heart diseases and cancer) at baseline were
excluded from all analyses (n = 103,755).
Firstly, the durations of discretionary screen time, TV
viewing and PC screen time in hours per day were
treated as continuous variables and hazard ratios (HR)
were calculated per 1-h increment. Linearity was ex-
plored with fractional polynomial models for each ex-
posure, with no evidence for deviation from linearity.
Each exposure was rounded to the nearest hour. Multi-
plicative interactions between the screen-time exposures
and sex were investigated by fitting the relevant parame-
ters into the model. For these analyses, we ran four
incremental models that included an increasing number
of covariates. Model 0 included age, sex, ethnicity,
deprivation index, professional qualifications, income
and employment as covariates. Model 1 was adjusted for
lifestyle factors including smoking, physical activity, grip
strength, categories of sleep duration, dietary intake (al-
cohol, fruit and vegetables, red meat, processed meat
and oily fish intake). Model 2 was adjusted for model 1
plus BMI categories. Model 3 was adjusted for model 2
plus systolic blood pressure, prevalent diabetes, hyper-
tension and medication for diabetes, hypertension, and
cholesterol. Finally, model 4 was equivalent to model 3
but participants who reported to be ex-smokers (n =
173,104) or current smokers (n = 52,990) were excluded
from the analysis.
To investigate whether grip strength, cardiorespiratory
fitness or physical activity moderated the associations
between screen-time exposures and health outcomes,
participants were stratified into age- and sex-specific ter-
tiles for grip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness and phys-
ical activity (Additional file 1: Tables S2–S4), and all
screen-time exposures were classified into the following
categories: <2 h, 2–3 h, 4–5 h and >5 h. Significant in-
teractions of physical activity, fitness and strength with
screen-time exposures on health outcomes were tested
by fitting an interaction term between the exposure of
interest and the modifier factors coded as ordinal vari-
ables (i.e. TV viewing category × physical activity ter-
tiles). To illustrate the interaction effect, we used ordinal
coding with the referent group being the lowest category
for the duration of screen time (<2 h.day− 1) and the
highest tertile for grip strength, fitness or physical
activity. These interaction analyses were adjusted for
model 3 mentioned above, but physical activity and grip
strength were removed
as
covariates
and
used
as
interaction factors.
The proportional hazard assumption was checked by
tests based on Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were per-
formed using statistical software STATA 14 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Of the 502,655 participants recruited since August 2009,
after excluding participants in a landmark analysis with
follow-up commencing 2 years after recruitment and par-
ticipants who self-reported comorbidities at baseline, we
included 391,089 participants with available data for dis-
cretionary screen time, grip strength and physical activity
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Valid cardiorespiratory fitness
and screen-time data were available for a subset of 59,068
participants
[9].
The
median
follow-up
period
was
5.0 years (interquartile range 4.3 to 5.7), commencing 2
years after baseline, for mortality outcomes and 4.2 years
for CVD and cancer incidence (interquartile range 3.5 to
4.7). Over the follow-up period, 7420 participants died
and there were 22,210 CVD and 23,464 cancer events, of
which 2198 and 4606 were fatal, respectively.
The main characteristics of the participants by categories
of screen time are summarised in Table 1. In summary, in-
dividuals in the highest group for overall screen time
(>5 h.day− 1) were more likely to be from the most deprived
tertile (with lower income, lower professional qualifications

lowest group (<2 h.day− 1). Moreover, individuals in this
higher screen-time category had a higher prevalence of
current smoking, obesity and comorbidities, including dia-
betes and hypertension as well as higher prevalence of be-
ing on medication for hypertension and higher cholesterol,
compared with the lowest group (<2 h.day− 1). They had a
higher BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat,
had a higher intake of processed meat and lower intake of
fruit and vegetables, and had lower levels of physical
activity, fitness and grip strength in comparison to those in
the lowest screen-time group (Table 1). Similar patterns

 Compared to individuals in the lower PC screen-time
category (<2 h.day− 1), those in the higher category
(>5 h.day− 1) were more likely to have college or
university degrees, be in a higher income group and be
currently employed. They had higher fitness and grip
strength but lower physical activity levels and lower
medication use. No major differences were observed
across PC screen categories for dietary intake, adiposity,
obesity and comorbidities (Additional file 1: Table S6).
The characteristics of individuals by tertiles of physical
activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and grip strength are
presented in Additional file 1: Tables S7–S9. Correla-
tions between TV viewing and PC screen time were low
(r = − 0.072). Similarly, the correlation of screen-time ex-
posures with grip strength, cardiorespiratory fitness and
physical activity were low (ranging from r = − 0.199 to
0.115) (Additional file 1: Table S10).
Overall, there were significant associations of overall dis-
cretionary screen time, TV viewing and PC screen time
with health outcomes (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Figure
S1). No significant interactions were found between any of
the screen-time exposures and sex for any of the outcomes
(data not shown); therefore, analyses were not stratified by
sex. Moreover, when BMI categories, diabetes and hyper-
tension prevalence were removed as covariates from the
analysis due to their potential mediating role on the out-
come, the interactions were not altered (data not shown).
The associations of discretionary screen-time exposures
and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.06 [95% confidence interval
CI: 1.05; 1.07], p < 0.0001), incidence of CVD (HR: 1.05
[95% CI: 1.04; 1.06], p < 0.0001) and cancer (HR: 1.04 [95%
CI: 1.03; 1.04], p < 0.0001) were slightly attenuated, but
remained associated, after adjustment for the potential
confounding effects of socio-demographic characteristics,
lifestyle factors (including smoking), physical activity, grip
strength and dietary variables and further adjustment for
mediators (BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure and
hypertension prevalence as well as medication for hyper-
tension and cholesterol) (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Fig-
ure S2). The magnitude of the associations between TV
viewing and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.09 [95% CI: 1.07;
1.10], p < 0.0001) was slightly higher than those observed
for PC screen time (HR: 1.03 [95% CI: 1.01; 1.05], p =
0.001); however, the associations between screen-time ex-
posures were similar for CVD and cancer incidence and
mortality (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S1).
No significant interactions were found between any of
the screen-time exposures and physical activity, fitness and
grip strength for any of the health outcomes, although there
was a tendency (p < 0.10) for interactions between overall
discretionary screen time and fitness for all-cause mortality
and CVD incidence and between screen time and physical
activity for all-cause mortality (Fig. 2 and Additional file 1:
Figures S2–S4 and Tables S11–S13). Nevertheless, when
participants were stratified into tertiles for grip strength,
physical activity and fitness, the magnitude of HRs for in-
creased risk of adverse health outcomes (all-cause mortality,
CVD and cancer incidence) with increasing duration of
overall discretionary screen time were numerically highest,
and statistically significant, in the subgroup of participants
with the lowest levels of grip strength, physical activity or
fitness. In contrast, the association of higher screen time
with health outcomes in those participants who have higher
levels of physical activity, fitness or grip strength was nu-
merically less strong and, with the exception of the associ-
ation with all-cause mortality in those in the highest
tertile of physical activity (HR 1.07 [1.03, 1.13], p = 0.045),
not statistically significant. For example, considering the
association of discretionary screen time with all-cause
mortality, the HR per increasing category of screen time

 was 1.31 (1.22, 1.43) (p < 0.0001) for those in the lowest
tertile for grip strength, but only 1.04 (0.95, 1.14) (p =
0.198) for those in the highest grip strength tertile. When

Discussion
The main novel finding of this study is that the associa-
tions between overall discretionary screen time—an
index of TV viewing and leisure PC screen time—with
all-cause mortality and CVD and cancer incidence and
mortality were substantially attenuated by physical activ-
ity, cardiorespiratory fitness and grip strength. Our re-
sults revealed that, overall, higher levels of screen time
were associated with a higher hazard for all-cause mor-
tality and CVD and cancer incidence and mortality, in-
dependent of physical activity, grip strength, BMI and
other major confounding factors. However, when the co-
hort was stratified by grip strength, the HRs for mortal-
ity, CVD and cancer associated with increasing screen
time were almost twice as strong in those with low com-
pared with high levels of grip strength. A similar pattern
was observed for physical activity. For cardiorespiratory
fitness, the association of increasing screen time with

 increasing risk for mortality, CVD and cancer was aug-
mented in the least fit population tertile. If these asso-
ciations are causal, this suggests that the population
subgroups with the lowest levels of strength, fitness
and
physical
activity
could
potentially
obtain
the
greatest benefit from interventions aimed at reducing
sedentary behaviours. Conversely, in those with high
strength, fitness and physical activity, the adverse ef-
fects of prolonged discretionary screen time were
attenuated.
Although this study used overall discretionary screen
time as one of the exposures of interest, our study also
confirms the direction and magnitude of the association
of TV viewing and leisure PC screen time with health
outcomes [3, 4].
We have recently reported that the associations of
physical activity with mortality and CVD events are
moderated by both grip strength and cardiorespiratory
fitness. The risk associated with low physical activity is
substantially greater in those with low strength and

hypertension, and cholesterol. Analyses were all performed as landmark analysis with follow-up commenced 2 years after recruitment and only including
participants who were event-free at this time. Participants with comorbidities at baseline were excluded from all-analysis (n = 103,755). P-interaction

 fitness, than in those who were strong and fit [9]. Al-
though the present findings indicate that the same is
true for overall discretionary screen time and for TV
viewing and leisure PC screen time when these were
considered separately, the magnitude of the association
of TV viewing and PC screen time with health outcomes
may not apply to the same extent. Taken together, these
findings suggest that individuals with low levels of func-
tional capacity appear to experience the greatest adverse
consequences of high levels of screen time and physical
inactivity, which, if causal, has implications for public
health strategies to reduce mortality, CVD and cancer
risk. Current guidelines advocate targeting everyone who
has high levels of sedentary behaviour or low physical
activity levels with interventions to reduce sitting time
and increase physical activity [25]. Our data suggest that
targeting such interventions to those with low strength
and low fitness could substantially improve our ability to
identify individuals who could benefit most from redu-
cing discretionary screen time, which could potentially

 increase the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
While fitness testing is relatively difficult to measure in
health-care and community settings, grip strength is
quick, simple and cheap to measure, and has high repro-
ducibility [26], so could easily be implemented as a
screening tool in a variety of settings. The effectiveness
of such a targeted approach requires testing in rando-
mised controlled trials.
Conversely, the present data suggest that those with
high levels of fitness and grip strength are relatively pro-
tected from the adverse association of high levels of
screen time with mortality, CVD and cancer risk. High
fitness and grip strength are likely to have an innate
component since fitness and strength both have rela-
tively high heritability [27, 28]. A number of genes re-
lated to fitness and strength have been identified [29],
and some individuals with low levels of physical activity
are fit and strong [9], but it is also likely that current fit-
ness and strength are influenced by patterns of physical
activity earlier in life. There is evidence from animal
model studies that artificial selection for high cardiore-
spiratory fitness leads to a favourable cardio-metabolic
risk profile [30] and increased life expectancy [31], sug-
gesting a causal protective effect of high fitness against
adverse health outcomes. There are also data from ran-
domised trials of resistance training—which improves
strength—that such interventions improve glucose regu-
lation, lipid profile, adiposity and type 2 diabetes risk
[32, 33]. Thus, the inverse association between grip
strength (which provides a good index of overall muscle
limb strength [34]) and mortality/CVD/cancer risk is
mechanistically plausible. The present data suggest a
high level of functional capacity—as evidenced by high
fitness or strength—enables an individual to be able to
tolerate high levels of screen time without experiencing
the same adverse health consequences as their less fit
and strong counterparts. Thus, for individuals who
spend a large proportion of their leisure time on
screen-related activities (TV viewing and computer use),
increasing fitness and strength could conceivably be one
way of offsetting this risk. This is a testable hypothesis
that warrants testing in a randomised trial.
Our findings also confirm the recent observations in a
meta-analysis of a million participants that high levels of
physical activity attenuate the adverse effects of pro-
longed sitting [35]. We extend the findings for a further
502,642 participants to also show that this moderating
effect of physical activity on the association between dis-
cretionary sedentary behaviour and mortality also applies
to CVD and cancer incidence and mortality. Moreover, a
recent prospective study reported that 4.3% to 14.9% of
premature deaths in the United Kingdom could be
avoided through substitution of 30 min.day− 1 of total
screen time or TV viewing time by discretionary active
alternatives, such as DIY and other daily life activities,
with the highest potential reduction in mortality to be
gained from substituting TV viewing with sport and
exercise [4]. This is the largest single study to consider
this research question. A key strength of the present
investigation is that all participants came from a single
well-phenotyped study (UK Biobank), with harmonised
data collection and a comprehensive and consistent set
of covariates. This eliminates the issue of between-study
heterogeneity and enables a more complete adjustment
for potential confounding factors than is possible from a
meta-analysis.
Higher levels of discretionary screen time, and its sub-
components of TV viewing and leisure PC use, are nu-
merically more strongly associated with adverse health
outcomes amongst those with the lowest levels of phys-
ical activity, fitness and grip strength. Moreover, there is
generally no significant association of increasing screen
time with adverse health outcomes amongst the fittest,
strongest and most-active tertiles. Despite this, it is im-
portant to acknowledge that there were no statistically
significant interactions observed when the strengths of
these associations were formally statistically compared.
This suggests that the power needed to detect such an
association is very high and a longer follow-up, to enable
more events to accrue, may be needed. On this note, it
is important to recognise that the earlier meta-analysis
on the association between sitting and mortality accord-
ing to levels of physical activity—which the present
study builds on—did not formally test for interactions
and drew its conclusions from numerical differences in
the mortality HRs [35].
Implications of findings
Overall, these data are potentially relevant to guidance
and interventions aiming to reduce CVD and mortality
risk via behavioural change. Our findings suggest that
the deleterious effects of screen time may be greatest
amongst those with low levels of strength, fitness or
physical activity. Thus, specifically targeting these groups
to reduce screen time (and potentially other sedentary
behaviours) and/or increase physical activity and func-
tional capacity may be a more effective strategy than the
blanket approach of recommending a reduction of sed-
entary behaviour in all. Notably, it is quick and easy to
identify such high-risk groups. The questionnaire used
to assess screen time and physical activity in UK Bio-
bank data can be completed relatively quickly (3–5 min).
Measurement of grip strength is quick, simple and cheap
to administer using a hand grip dynamometer and has
high reproducibility [26]. Thus, screening for physical
activity level and grip strength could easily be under-
taken in routine clinical practice and in community set-
tings

 sedentary behaviour would be particularly beneficial.
Randomised trials to test the effectiveness of such an ap-
proach are, therefore, warranted.
Strengths and limitations
The UK Biobank provided an opportunity to test our re-
search question in a very large, prospective cohort and
the main outcome used in this study was collected using
a linkage to UK NHS mortality and hospital admission
records. Additionally, physical activity, cardiorespiratory
fitness and grip strength were assessed using validated
methods [9, 17, 22, 36], trained staff and standard oper-
ating procedures. In addition, a wide range of potential
confounding variables was controlled for in our analyses.
These include dietary intake variables, BMI, diabetes and
hypertension, which could be on the causal pathway be-
tween discretionary screen time and mortality and mor-
bidity outcomes, potentially resulting in over adjustment
and, therefore, underestimation of the strength of associ-
ation for discretionary screen time (and its subcompo-
nents) and the measured outcomes. Fitness was only
assessed in a subgroup of the UK Biobank cohort, which
limits the power in our analyses stratified by fitness level.
In addition, fitness tests were not conducted if it was un-
safe to do so and our analyses excluded all participants
with comorbidities. It might be expected that such indi-
viduals would be more likely to have a low rather than
high level of fitness, thus their inclusion could conceiv-
ably have obscured or augmented the true association
between fitness and the outcome measures due to re-
verse causality. UK Biobank is relatively representative of
the general population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity
and deprivation within the age range recruited but is not
representative in other regards, such as prevalence of
obesity and comorbidities, which may indicate a healthy
volunteer selection bias [37]. Whilst this limits the abil-
ity to generalise prevalence rates, estimates of the mag-
nitude of associations regarding disease or mortality and
disease risk in the current study should nevertheless be
generalisable [13, 37, 38]. As is the case for any observa-
tional study, causality cannot be confirmed and reverse
causality is always a possibility. However, our analyses
were conducted by excluding all those with chronic
conditions. Although disease and comorbidities existing
before
the
UK
Biobank
measurement
day
were
self-reported, these self-reported records were based on
diseases that have been medically diagnosed. Addition-
ally, we excluded those who died within the first 2 years
of follow-up. These approaches help us to minimise the
risk of reverse causality influencing our estimates. An-
other aspect that could confound our findings is the ef-
fect of potential mediators, such as BMI, diabetes and
hypertension, on the health outcomes. However, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis by testing the interaction
between health outcomes and screen-time exposures
with and without these covariates and the results were
not altered. Therefore, we included only a fully adjusted
analysis in the study.
Although physical activity was measured by self-report
using a validated questionnaire [9, 17, 39], self-reported
screen time has not been examined for criterion validity.
However, most self-reported instruments have similar
validity [40], and the effect estimates reported for screen
time in this study were similar to those reported previ-
ously in comparable populations using similar adjust-
ment strategies [3, 4, 41]. Misreporting of screen time or
physical activity may have attenuated the association be-
tween the lifestyle exposures and mortality compared to
an objective physical activity measurement [42]. How-
ever, this is unlikely to have substantially confounded
the differential influence of the exposures on mortality
and disease risk across the screen-time or physical activ-
ity groups, unless the extent of misreporting of screen
time was systematically greater in the groups with the
highest levels of physical activity, fitness and grip
strength. It is also more feasible to administer a ques-
tionnaire rather than an objective measure as a screen-
ing tool in routine clinical or community settings [26] to
identify individuals for whom increasing physical activity
and reducing screen time would be particularly benefi-
cial. The present data suggest that this self-report
approach is sufficiently robust to identify differential
levels of risk. Although our analyses were adjusted for a
number of major confounding factors, we cannot fully
discard the potential contribution of unmeasured con-
founding factors or other proxies of sedentary leisure be-
haviour in our findings.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the present data build on existing evi-
dence that a high level of discretionary screen time is
a potentially preventable contributor to morbidity and
mortality, by demonstrating that this relationship is
substantially attenuated by grip strength and cardiore-
spiratory fitness. We also confirm and extend recent
observations that the association between TV viewing
and mortality is attenuated by a level of physical ac-
tivity. This has two potentially important implications
for public health. First, interventions to reduce discre-
tionary sedentary behaviours to improve future health
outcomes may be more economically and clinically ef-
fective if they are targeted at those with low levels of
strength, fitness and physical activity. Second, increas-
ing strength and fitness may provide a means of off-
setting the potential adverse consequences of high
screen time. Both of these warrant testing in future
randomised controlled trials.
