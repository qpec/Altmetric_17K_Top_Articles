 Comparison of Insulin Glargine
300 Units/mL and 100 Units/mL
in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes:
Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Profiles and Variability Using
Morning or Evening Injections
Diabetes Care 2017;40:554–560 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0684
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to compare glucose control in participants with type 1
diabetes receiving insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla-300) or glargine 100 units/mL
(Gla-100) in the morning or evening, in combination with mealtime insulin.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In this 16-week, exploratory, open-label, parallel-group, two-period crossover
study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01658579), 59 adults with type 1 diabetes
were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily Gla-300 or Gla-100 given in the morning
or evening (with crossover in the injection schedule). The primary efficacy
end point was the mean percentage of time in the target glucose range
(80–140 mg/dL), as measured using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), during
the last 2 weeks of each 8-week period. Additional end points included other CGM
glycemic control parameters, hypoglycemia (per self-monitored plasma
glucose [SMPG]), and adverse events.
RESULTS
The percentage of time within the target glucose range was comparable between
the Gla-300 and Gla-100 groups. There was significantly less increase in CGM-
based glucose during the last 4 h of the 24-h injection interval for Gla-300 com-
pared with Gla-100 (least squares mean difference 214.7 mg/dL [95% CI 226.9
to 22.5]; P = 0.0192). Mean 24-h glucose curves for the Gla-300 group were
smoother (lower glycemic excursions), irrespective of morning or evening injec-
tion. Four metrics of intrasubject interstitial glucose variability showed no differ-
ence between Gla-300 and Gla-100. Nocturnal confirmed (<54 mg/dL by SMPG) or
severe hypoglycemia rate was lower for Gla-300 participants than for Gla-100
participants (4.0 vs. 9.0 events per participant-year; rate ratio 0.45 [95% CI
0.24–0.82]).
CONCLUSIONS
Less increase in CGM-based glucose levels in the last 4 h of the 24-h injection
interval, smoother average 24-h glucose profiles irrespective of injection time,
and reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia were observed with Gla-300 versus Gla-100.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 Despite advances in basal insulin ther-
apy, many people with type 1 diabetes
still experience marked day-to-day dif-
ferences in glucose levels as well as glu-
cose excursions within the same day.
These often unpredictable fluctuations
in glucose levels make it difficult to op-
timize insulin doses and reach desired
glycemic targets. It is also well recog-
nized that hypoglycemia is a limiting fac-
tor when intensifying insulin therapy
(1). Therefore, a basal insulin that leads
to more stable glucose control with a
reduced risk for hypoglycemia would
provide a distinct clinical advantage.
A pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacody-
namic (PD) euglycemic clamp study at
steady state in people with type 1 dia-
betes showed that the basal insulin
analog insulin glargine 300 units/mL
(Gla-300) provides more consistent and
prolonged insulin exposure compared
with insulin glargine 100 units/mL (Gla-
100), resulting in blood glucose control
that lasts well beyond 24 h (2). A second
euglycemic clamp study demonstrated
predictable and stable 24-h glycemic cov-
erage by Gla-300 as a result of low fluctu-
ation and high reproducibility of insulin
exposure (3). Continuous glucose monitor-
ing (CGM), which records interstitial fluid
glucose levels every 5 min throughout the
day and night, is a valuable way to confirm
whether the differences observed in the
PK and PD properties of insulins under eu-
glycemic clamp conditions translate to
clinically relevant differences in their 24-h
glucose profiles and other parameters of
glycemic control, including hypoglycemia.
CGM was used in this study by 59 adult
participants with type 1 diabetes over two
successive8-weekperiodstoassessglucose
control, safety, and tolerability of Gla-300
comparedwithGla-100whenadministered
in the morning or evening.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design
This exploratory, 16-week, open-label,
phase II, parallel-group, two-period cross-
over study of participants with type 1 di-
abetes was conducted in three study
centers in the U.S. from August 2012 to
May 2013. After a 4-week screening
phase, participants were randomized
1:1:1:1, using aremote telephonesystem,
to receive treatment with Gla-300 or
Gla-100 (both Sanofi, Paris, France) in
the morning or evening during treatment
period A (weeks 1–8); participants then
crossed over to the alternate injection
schedule (evening or morning) for treat-
ment period B (weeks 9–16).
CGM (using the Dexcom Seven Plus
CGM system [Dexcom, San Diego, CA])
was performed throughout the 16-week
treatment period. Participants were
masked to their CGM data. Data from
the last 2 weeks of each 8-week treatment
period (Aand B)were analyzed(weeks7–8
and weeks 15–16 combined). The study de-
sign is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 1.
The study protocol was approved by
the appropriate local or central indepen-
dent ethics committees or institutional re-
view boards, and the study was conducted
according to Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All
participants provided written informed
consent.
Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Adult participants ($18 and ,70 years
of age at screening) diagnosed with
type 1 diabetes and receiving any basal
insulin regimen and mealtime insulin
analog for at least 1 year were eligible
for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included
HbA1c .9.0% at screening; not taking a
stable insulin dose in the 30 days before
screening; use of an insulin pump within
6 months before screening; use of pre-
mixed insulin, human regular insulin as
mealtime insulin, and/or any antihyper-
glycemic drugs other than an insulin an-
alog at mealtime and basal insulin
within 3 months before screening; and
any contraindication to insulin glargine.
Interventions
Participants self-administered sub-
cutaneous injections of Gla-300 or Gla-
100 once daily, at the same time each
daydeither in the morning (immediately
before breakfast until lunch) or evening
(immediately before the evening meal un-
til bedtime)daccording to their assigned
schedule in each treatment period. Injec-
tions were administered using commer-
cially available insulin syringes because an
insulin pen that could deliver the small
volumes of Gla-300 required was not
available when the study was conducted.
All information pertaining to the time,
dose,andlocation ofthe injection ofbasal
insulin treatment as well as the time and
dose of mealtime insulin were recorded
daily in participant diaries.
Participants receiving basal insulin
twice daily before study entry were
changed to a once-daily regimen at
screening (week 22). For treatment pe-
riod A, the basal insulin dose on the day
before randomization and the median
fasting self-measured plasma glucose
(SMPG) value before breakfast during
the 3 days before baseline were used
to calculate the starting dose. For treat-
ment period B, the starting dose was
calculated using the basal insulin dose
on the day before the first study visit
of treatment period B (week 9) and the
SMPG before breakfast during the
3 days before week 9.
The basal insulin dose was titrated no
more often than every 3 to 4 days during
the first 6 weeks ofeachtreatment period
(A and B)toreachthe target fasting SMPG
of 80–130 mg/dL (4.4–7.2 mmol/L), and it
was optimized by the investigators using
CGM data (downloaded at the study vis-
its). In each treatment period, the 6-week
titration phase was followed by a 2-week
maintenance phase (weeks 7–8 and
weeks 15–16) in which basal insulin doses
were to remain as constant as clinically
possible (representing a steady-state sce-
nario to better allow comparison of the
two basal insulins), and in which most
glycemic corrections were made using
the mealtime insulin.
Each participant continued to use the
same rapid-acting insulin analog used in
the 3 months before screening, with ad-
justments to achieve a target 2-h postpran-
dial SMPG of ,160 mg/dL (,8.9 mmol/L).
Glycemic targets were adapted for individ-
ual participants, if deemed necessary.
End Points
The primary end point was the mean
percentage of time within the predefined
CGM glucose range of 80–140 mg/dL
(4.4–7.8 mmol/L) during the last 2 weeks
of each treatment period. Secondary
end points based on CGM included the
mean percentage of time with glucose
,80 mg/dL, the mean percentage of
time with glucose .140 mg/dL, mean
glucose levels, mean and variation in glu-
cose profiles, and glucose variability met-
rics. Mean change in HbA1c (NGSP units)
from baseline to week 16 (analyzed by a
central laboratory) and insulin dose (units
per kilogram; total daily dose, basal dose,
mealtime/bolus dose) were assessed.
Participant-reported hypoglycemic
events were collected for the entire
on-treatment study period and ana-
lyzed by categories as defined by the
care.diabetesjournals.org
Bergenstal and Associates
555
 American Diabetes Association (4); they
were classified as occurring during the
night (0000–0559 h) and at any time of
day (24 h). The number of hypoglycemic
events per participant-year were calcu-
lated using plasma glucose concentration
cutoffs of #70 mg/dL (#3.9 mmol/L)
and ,54 mg/dL (,3.0 mmol/L). To
confirm a hypoglycemic event, partici-
pants were instructed to measure capil-
lary plasma glucose levels (SMPG) before
the administration of carbohydrates
whenever symptomatic hypoglycemia
was suspected, unless safety consider-
ationsrequiredimmediate glucose rescue
before confirmation. Treatment-emergent
adverse events (AEs), both nonserious and
serious, were evaluated.
Data Analysis and Statistics
No formal sample size estimation was
performed for this first-of-its-kind head-
to-head comparison of basal insulins using
CGM in a crossover exploratory study.
Assuming a 15% withdrawal rate, we
planned to enroll approximately 56 partici-
pants to achieve 48 evaluable participants.
Unless otherwise specified, the effi-
cacy results were analyzed using CGM
data from the last 2 weeks of each treat-
ment period (weeks 7–8 and weeks 15–16,
when basal insulin doses were to remain
as constant as possible and most glycemic
corrections were made using mealtime in-
sulin) by treatment group overall (i.e.,
pooled morning and evening injection
schedules); some end points were also an-
alyzed by treatment group and injection
schedule (morning vs. evening).
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT)
population included all randomized par-
ticipants who received at least one dose
of study medication and had at least one
efficacy assessment after the baseline.
The primary efficacy population (the
CGM population) included all partici-
pants from the mITT population who
had evaluable CGM data after the base-
line. The safety population was defined as
all randomized participants who received
at least one dose of study medication.
All summaries and statistical analyses
weregeneratedusingSASsoftware,version
9.2. The efficacy analyses are presented
using last-observation-carried-forward
imputation. The primary end point was
analyzed using a mixed model with re-
peated measurements, with treatment
and period as fixed effects and partici-
pant as the random effect. The model
was fitted to all the data simultaneously,
and from this model the relevant treat-
ment differences were estimated as
least squares (LS) means with SEs. Statis-
tical comparisons were performed
using a two-sided test with a nominal
5% significance level. Mean glucose
levels and 24-h glucose profiles were
generated by calculating the mean
CGM-based glucose level pooled across
all participants within each treatment
group, reported overall and (for 24-h
glucose profiles) by injection schedule.
CGM-detected hypoglycemic events
were defined as one or more continu-
ously measured interstitial glucose value
either #70 or ,54 mg/dL.
Post Hoc Analyses
To confirm the more stable and pro-
longed duration of the glucose-lowering
activity of Gla-300, the mean and SD of
the change per participant (D) in CGM-
based glucose level in the last 4 h of the
24-h injection interval was calculated for
the last 2 weeks of each treatment pe-
riod, compared between Gla-300 and
Gla-100 overall (using mixed model with
repeated measurements analysis), and
described by treatment group for morn-
ing and evening injections (D = glucose
level 0–5 min before injection 2 glucose
level 4 h before injection).
Intrasubject glucose variability met-
rics were analyzed by treatment group.
Metrics assessed included total SD of all
glucose values over all days and times
(SDT), within-day SD (SDw; averaged
over all days), SD of daily means (SDdm),
and SD between days (SDb) for any spec-
ified time of day (5). Each variability met-
ric is presented by treatment group as the
mean of the SD for all participants in each
group.
RESULTS
Study Population
Of 85 participants with type 1 diabetes
enrolledin the study,59were randomized
to treatment with Gla-300 (n = 30) or Gla-
100 (n = 29) and included in the mITT
population; 29 (97%) in the Gla-300 group
and 26 (90%) in the Gla-100 group com-
pleted the study (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Of the four participants who discontinued
thestudy,one (1.7%) in theGla-300 group
was discontinued because of pregnancy
(details are provided in the ADVERSE EVENTS
section), and three (5.1%) in the Gla-100
group were discontinued because of
“other” non-safety-related reasons.
Baseline characteristics were similar
across treatment groups. Characteristics
of the entire study population were
mean age 44.2 years; mean duration of
diabetes 22.1 years; mean HbA1c 7.46%
(58.0 mmol/mol); and prior total daily
insulin dose 0.6 units/kg/day (Supple-
mentary Tables 1 and 2).
Glycemic Control (as Measured by
CGM)
The mean percentage of time within the
predefined target glycemic range of 80–
140 mg/dL during the last 2 weeks of
treatment (primary end point) was com-
parable between the Gla-300 and Gla-
100 groups (LS mean [SE] 31.8% [1.5]
vs. 31.0% [1.6], respectively; LS mean
difference 0.75% [95% CI 23.61 to
5.12]; P = 0.73) (Fig. 1). There was also
no difference between the Gla-300 and
Gla-100 treatment groups in the mean
percentage of time in the target range
when the injection was in the morning
(mean [SE] 31.6% [1.8] vs. 31.5% [1.7])
or in the evening (32.0% [1.7] vs. 30.5%
[1.8]). There was no meaningful difference
between treatment groups in terms of

treatment period overall among the CGM population.

CGM-detected low interstitial glucose
values during the entire on-treatment
period in the Gla-300 and the Gla-100
groups are shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3A (at either threshold [#70
and ,54 mg/dL] and by injection time)
and Supplementary Fig. 3B.
24-h Glucose Profile
Figure 2 shows the mean 24-h glucose
profiles obtained by CGM during the last
2 weeks of each treatment period for par-
ticipants receiving Gla-300 and Gla-100,
pooled across participants in each treat-
ment group. The profiles were smoother
with Gla-300, showing smaller differences
in glucose levels throughout the 24-h
period than with Gla-100 (difference be-
tween the daily minimum and maximum
values: Gla-300, 14 mg/dL; Gla-100,
28 mg/dL) (Fig. 2A). This was particu-
larly evident when comparing by injec-
tion time: profiles of the Gla-300
morning and evening injection groups
were almost able to be superimposed
(Fig. 2B), whereas there were larger
glycemic excursions in the Gla-100
morning injection group (minimum/
maximum values, 149/189 mg/dL) com-
pared with the evening injection group
(minimum/maximum values, 162/183
mg/dL) (Fig. 2C).
Glycemic Control in the Last 4 h of the
24-h Injection Interval
In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, the
mean (SD) change (D) in glucose level
during the last 4 h of each participant’s
24-h injection interval showed significantly
less increase for Gla-300 than for Gla-100
(10.9 [24.5] vs. 26.5 [21.0] mg/dL, respec-
tively; LS mean difference between
groups, 214.7 mg/dL [95% CI 226.9
to 22.5]; P = 0.0192). The difference in
favor of Gla-300 was observed regardless
of injection time.
Mean Glucose
Mean interstitial glucose levels decreased
over the 16-week treatment period in the
Gla-300 group, from 182.1 mg/dL at base-
line to 165.0 mg/dL at week 16 (mean
change from baseline 213.2 mg/dL),
and in the Gla-100 group, from 172.6
mg/dL at baseline to 169.3 mg/dL at
week 16 (mean change from base-
line 22.7 mg/dL).
Glucose Variability Metrics
All metrics assessing the intrasubject
CGM glucose variability, whether within
days or between days (SDT, SDW, SDdm,
and SDb), showed no statistical differ-
ence in glucose measurements for those
receiving Gla-300 compared with those
receiving Gla-100during the last 2weeks
of each treatment period (Fig. 3).
HbA1c
At baseline, mean HbA1c was similar in both
treatment groups (Gla-300, 7.51%; Gla-100,
7.41%). The mean change from baseline
to week 16 was 20.44% (95% CI 20.64
to 20.24) in the Gla-300 group, a statisti-
cally significant decrease, and 20.22%
(20.45 to 0.01) in the Gla-100 group.
Daily Insulin Dose
The total (basal + mealtime) daily insulin
dose throughout the study remained rel-
atively stable in both groups (Gla-300
group: baseline, 0.68 units/kg and week
16, 0.67 units/kg; Gla-100 group: base-
line, 0.59 units/kg and week 16, 0.63
units/kg). The daily basal insulin dose in-
creased slightly in both groups from base-
line to week 16 (Gla-300 group: baseline,
0.30 units/kg and week 16, 0.35 units/kg;
Gla-100 group: baseline, 0.30 units/kg and
week 16, 0.33 units/kg) (Supplementary
Table 2).
Safety
Hypoglycemia (by Participant-Recorded
SMPG)
Throughout the 16-week study, the rate
of confirmed (,54 mg/dL) or severe hypo-
glycemia was lower during the noctur-
nal interval (0000–0559 h) with Gla-300
versus Gla-100 (Gla-300: 4.0 events per
participant-year, Gla-100: 9.0 events per

 participant-year; rate ratio 0.45 [95% CI
0.24–0.82]) (Fig. 4). Rates of such events
at any time of day (24 h) were compa-
rable between the Gla-300 and Gla-100
groups. When assessing hypoglycemia
at the less stringent glycemic threshold
(#70 mg/dL), rates of confirmed or se-
vere events, both at any time of day
(24 h) and during the nocturnal interval
(0000–0559 h), were comparable be-
tween the Gla-300 and Gla-100 groups.
There were no consistent differences
between morning and evening injection
within each treatment group (data not
shown).
One participant (3.3%) receiving Gla-
300 and three participants (10.3%) re-
ceiving Gla-100 each reported one
severe hypoglycemic event (defined
as requiring assistance from another
person). The participant in the Gla-
300 group experienced confusion and
was treated with glucagon; the three
participants in the Gla-100 group re-
ceived oral carbohydrate.
Adverse Events
In total, 24 participants (80%) receiving
Gla-300 and 19 participants (66%)
receiving Gla-100 reported one or more
treatment-emergent AE. The most com-
monly reported AEs were nasopharyngi-
tis, headache, pyrexia, and influenza
(Supplementary Table 3). One partici-
pant in the Gla-300 group who had a his-
tory of repeated abdominal obstruction
experienced a serious treatment-emergent
AE (intestinal obstruction), which was not
considered to be related to the study treat-
mentandresolvedfollowingtreatment.An-
other participant in the Gla-300 group was
withdrawn from the study owing to a treat-
ment-emergent AE of pregnancy. At the
time the database was locked, the preg-
nancy was continuing without any reported
abnormalities. A healthy child was prema-
turely delivered at 33 weeks’ gestation.
CONCLUSIONS
A fundamental goal of type 1 diabetes
management is to maintain glucose lev-
els within a target range and to minimize
vulnerability to hypoglycemic or hyper-
glycemic events that can lead to short-
and/or long-term health complications
(6–8). To achieve this, the “ideal” basal
insulin should provide stable glucose-
lowering activity over an entire 24-h pe-
riod and help maintain target glucose
levels in the fasting state and before
meals (9). The basal insulin can then
be paired with a rapid-acting insulin
before a meal that is adjusted to opti-
mize glycemic control after the meal
(10). The first generation of basal insulin
analogs have substantially improved
glucose management, offering a pro-
longed duration of action and a lower
risk of hypoglycemia, particularly over-
night, compared with NPH insulin (11).
However, only a small percentage of in-
dividuals with type 1 diabetes who use
these first-generation analogs achieve
glycemic targets, and excursions into
clinically dangerous hypoglycemic and
hyperglycemic states are common (12).
The results of these CGM analyses
consistently demonstrated a more
even distribution of glucose-lowering
activity throughout the entire 24-h in-
jection interval with Gla-300 compared
with Gla-100 based on glucose profiles
pooled across individuals. Although
there was no difference between Gla-
300 and Gla-100 regarding the time
spent in the predefined target glycemic
range of 80–140 mg/dL during weeks
7–8 and weeks 15–16 combined (Gla-
300: 31.8%; Gla-100: 31.0%), the relative-
ly low percentage of time in the target
glycemic range in both treatment groups
may be attributed to the upper limit be-
ing defined as 140 mg/dL, which is lower
than thepostprandialtarget of160 mg/dL
used in this study and considerably lower
than the 180 mg/dL after-meal upper
limit set by the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (7).
The mean 24-h glucose profile, aver-
aged for all participants on CGM in each
group by time of day, showed a nar-
rower range of daily interstitial glucose
levels for Gla-300 than for Gla-100. This
difference in profile was even more ev-
ident when morning and evening injec-
tion groups were compared; the glucose
profiles of Gla-300 morning and evening

 injections are nearly superimposable,
whereas larger excursions were seen in
the morning injection group compared
with the evening injection group for
Gla-100. The increase in glucose levels
from 020020800 h in the Gla-100 morn-
ing injection group may be more pro-
nounced than any glucose increases
seen in the evening injection group as a
result of the basal insulin waning toward
the end of the 24-h dosing interval, which
is not masked by the use of rapid-acting
insulin during this early morning period.
While glucose variability metrics were
smaller for Gla-300 than Gla-100, consis-
tent with the 24-h glucose profiles, there
were no statistically significant differ-
ences in these metrics.
Evidenceofthemoreprolongedglucose-
lowering activity of Gla-300 versus Gla-100
is most apparent toward the end of the
daily injection interval, as shown by a sig-
nificantlysmallerincreaseinglucosewithin
the last 4 h of the injection interval for Gla-
300 than for Gla-100. These observations
indicate that Gla-300 has a more sustained
glucose-lowering action and provide clini-
cal evidence of this prolonged glycemic
control over an entire 24-h period.
These results are consistent with previ-
ous findings from euglycemic clamp
studies (2,3).
Rates of hypoglycemia detected using
SMPG values were consistent with the
interstitial glucose values detected by
CGM. The annualized event rates for
SMPG-confirmed or severe hypoglyce-
mia were lower in the Gla-300 than
Gla-100 group during the nocturnal
period (0000–0559 h), which showed a
risk reduction of 55% for confirmed
(,54 mg/dL) or severe hypoglycemia.
During the nocturnal period, mealtime
insulin would be expected to have min-
imal effect as a contributory factor,
allowing a more reliable comparison of
the effects of basal insulin. There were
no consistent within-treatment differ-
ences in terms of hypoglycemia risk
between the morning and evening injec-
tion groups for either of the insulin
preparations. The phase IIIa EDITION 4
study also investigated Gla-300 versus
Gla-100 in people with type 1 diabetes
and observed an increase in SMPG with
Gla-300 before breakfast in the initial
weeks of the study that might have
affected the risk of hypoglycemia. In
the current study, however, mean 24-h
glucose profiles do not provide any
indication of glucose levels being higher
with Gla-300 than with Gla-100 at a time
that might be considered “before break-
fast.” In addition, the hypoglycemia
results presented here could be influ-
enced by the fact that mean interstitial
glucose levels were higher with Gla-300
than Gla-100 at baseline, although this
was likely offset by the greater decrease
in glucose over the study period with
Gla-300 and the lower final mean glu-
cose in that group.
The similar findings in the morning
and evening injection groups for Gla-
300 suggest the potential for flexibility
to select an injection time (morning or
evening) without compromising clinical
benefits, and should enable people with
diabetes to select their insulin injection
schedule according to their lifestyle to
reduce the burden of therapy (e.g., a
morningdosingtimewouldnotbeempha-
sized to avoid the nocturnal hypoglycemia
that occurred in some patients given Gla-
100 at bedtime) (13). The consistent 24-h
insulin activity with Gla-300 suggests there
would be value in a clinical trial exploring
whether people currently using Gla-100
twice daily could be adequately controlled
with Gla-300 once daily.
The safety profile of both treatments
in this study was consistent with that
reported previously (13–16), with simi-
lar numbers of participants in each
group experiencing AEs. Both treat-
ments were well tolerated.
The phase IIIa EDITION 4 study also
compared morning versus evening injec-
tion times (13). This 6-month treat-to-
target study demonstrated comparable
glucose control with Gla-300 and Gla-
100, in terms of HbA1c and fasting
plasma glucose, which did not differ be-
tween the morning and evening injec-
tion groups. Hypoglycemia rates were
generally similar between treatment
groups, except for lower nocturnal hypo-
glycemia with Gla-300 than Gla-100 in
the first 8 weeks of the study. Neither
hypoglycemia nor the AE profile differed
by time of injection.
This exploratory CGM study has limi-
tations: the open-label study design,
which was unavoidable because of the
different injection volumes of Gla-300
and Gla-100, and the use of commercial
syringes that are not approved for use
with Gla-300 in clinical practice and are
suboptimal for delivery of an insulin
with a concentration of 300 units/mL.
Future studies could be enhanced by us-
ing the recently approved Gla-300 pen
injector; the use of syringes with Gla-
300 might be expected to increase
glucose variability in the Gla-300 group,
although an increase in variability was
not seen in this study. This study also
used a short duration of treatment (two
8-week periods), although a 2-week pe-
riod of CGM (weeks 7–8 in this study) is
considered to be representative of the
longer-term pattern of glucose levels
(17). A modest number of participants
were enrolled, with crossover of the in-
jection schedule (morning to evening or
vice versa), so group size was limited,
with a low power to detect differences
between treatmentsdthat is, the per-
centage of time within the glucose range
of 80–140 mg/dL (the primary end point),
glucose variability metrics, and post hoc
analyses. This exploratory study involved
participants with type 1 diabetes with
relatively good glycemic control at base-
line (HbA1c 7.5% in the Gla-300 group
and 7.4% in the Gla-100 group), which
might have limited the improvement of
the quality of glycemic control. Never-
theless, consistent differences were
noted between Gla-300 and Gla-100 in
terms of the average glucose profiles
pooled across individuals, CGM-detected
low and high interstitial glucose values,
SMPG-documented nocturnal hypo-
glycemia (000020559 h), and CGM-
determined glucose levels during the
last 4 h of each participant’s injection
interval.
Recording interstitial glucose levels
continuously throughout the day and
night is a valuable tool for comparing
new therapies and an important way to
confirm whether observed PK/PD differ-
ences between insulins can be translated
to clinically relevant differences in 24-h
glucose profiles. CGM is also particularly
useful for evaluating hypoglycemia and
glucose variability, measures that are
very difficult to capture accurately or to
compare between treatmentsusinginter-
mittent SMPG data.
Inconclusion,inpeoplewithmoderately
well-controlled type 1 diabetes, CGM find-
ingsareconsistentwithpreviouslyreported
PK/PD analyses, demonstrating that Gla-
300 offers improved glycemic control
overafull24-hperiod, withlessfluctuation
in glucose levels, compared with Gla-100.
These results imply that Gla-300 should
