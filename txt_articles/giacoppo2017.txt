IMPORTANCE In patients with left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis, coronary artery
bypass grafting (CABG) has been the standard therapy for several decades. However, some
studies suggest that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents may
be an acceptable alternative.
OBJECTIVE To compare the long-term safety of PCI with drug-eluting stent vs CABG in
patients with LMCA stenosis.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and ScienceDirect databases
were searched from December 18, 2001, to February 1, 2017. Inclusion criteria were
randomized clinical trial, patients with LMCA stenosis, PCI vs CABG, exclusive use of
drug-eluting stents, and clinical follow-up of 3 or more years.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Trial-level hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were pooled by
fixed-effect and random-effects models with inverse variance weighting. Time-to-event indi-
vidual patient data for the primary end point were reconstructed. Sensitivity analyses according
to drug-eluting stent generation and coronary artery disease complexity were performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death,
myocardial infarction, or stroke at long-term follow-up. Secondary end points included repeat
revascularization and a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat
revascularization at long-term follow-up.

ompared with other sites, stenosis of the left main coro-
nary artery (LMCA) is associated with a higher risk of
mortality and myocardial injury owing to the larger
amount of subtended myocardium.1,2 Coronary artery by-
pass grafting (CABG) has been the standard of care for LMCA
stenosis for many years, but due to significant advances in de-
vice technology, increased operators’expertise, and availabil-
ity of improved antithrombotic therapy, percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) has emerged as a valid alternative
technique in a significant proportion of patients.1-4
Current European and American guidelines recommend
both CABG and PCI for the treatment of LMCA stenosis in
patients with overall low to intermediate complexity of coro-
nary artery disease (CAD).5,6 Recently, however, primary
analyses of 2 randomized clinical trials comparing PCI with
CABG for LMCA disease (Evaluation of Xience vs Coronary
Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revas-
cularization [EXCEL]7 and Nordic-Baltic-British Left Main
Revascularisation [NOBLE]8) were reported. These large-
scale trials leveraged stenting with second-generation drug-
eluting stent (DES) (Xience; Abbott Vascular) and contempo-
rary surgical techniques, showing somewhat conflicting
treatment effects.
Previous meta-analyses did not include the EXCEL and
NOBLE trials,9-11 pooled both observational and randomized
investigations,9-11 combined patients receiving bare-metal
stents and DESs,9-12 assessed short-term and midterm
outcomes,9 used odds ratios or risk ratios for long-term
outcomes,10-12 and did not provide reconstruction of out-
comes over time.9-12 Against this background, we carried out
an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials com-
paring DES-based PCI with CABG at long-term follow-up in
patients with LMCA disease.
Methods
We conducted a frequentist, pairwise meta-analysis in
accordance with PRISMA and Cochrane Collaboration
recommendations.13,14 The PRISMA checklist is reported in
eTable 1 in the Supplement. PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web
ofKnowledge,andScienceDirectdatabasesweresearchedfrom
December 18, 2001, to February 1, 2017. Three of us (R.C.,
A.H.F., and J.W.) performed the search independently. After
removal of duplicates, full-text screening was performed with
resolution of divergences by consensus (D.G., R.C., A.H.F., and
J.W.).Otherdetailsontheliteraturesearch,dataextraction,and
feasibility assessment are provided in the eMethods in the
Supplement. The meta-analysis was approved by Deutsches
Herzzentrum München.
Eligibility Criteria
We included investigations fulfilling all of the following crite-
ria: (1) randomized clinical trial, (2) LMCA stenosis, (3) PCI vs
CABG, (4) exclusive use of DESs, and (5) follow-up of 3 or more
years. Trials reporting follow-up of less than 3 years were ex-
cluded to allow focus on long-term outcomes and limit the
influence of early nonsignificant differences.15
End Points
The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death,
myocardial infarction, or stroke at the longest available follow-
up. The secondary end points were repeat revascularization,
individualcomponentsoftheprimaryendpoint,cardiacdeath,
stent or graft occlusion, and a composite of all-cause death,
myocardialinfarction,stroke,orrepeatrevascularizationatthe
longest available follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Fixed-effect and random-effects models with inverse vari-
anceweightingusingtrial-levelloghazardratios(HRs)andcor-
responding SEs were applied.16,17 Trial-level and pooled esti-
mates are reported as HR and 95% CI; risk distribution is
presented by forest plots with weighting according to random-
effects models.18 We assessed heterogeneity across trials using
between-study variance τ2 and I2 statistics.14,16,19 I2 values less
than 25% defined low heterogeneity; 25% to 50%, moderate
heterogeneity;andgreaterthan50%,highheterogeneity.14For-
mal testing for uniform effect size across trials with signifi-
cance set at P = .10 was performed.16 Data from patients
with Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery
(SYNTAX)(Taxus;BostonScientific)scores20of1to22(lowCAD
complexity), 23 to 32 (intermediate), and 33 or above (high) in
the Bypass Surgery vs Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting
Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease
(PRECOMBAT) and EXCEL trials7,21 were synthesized by fixed-
effect models. Testing for differences between the subgroups
with significance set at P < .05 was performed.16 Individual
patient data reconstruction was performed by extreme-
magnificationdigitizationofhigh-qualityKaplan-Meiercurves.
Retrieved spatial information, numbers at risk, and events for
each time interval were used to run a validated algorithm.22
Reconstructed individual patient data were used for time-to-
first-event Kaplan-Meier analyses to describe distribution of
events over time and define cumulative incidence at 5-year fol-
low-up. In a 1-stage, individual patient data meta-analysis, a

Key Points
Question Does percutaneous coronary intervention with
drug-eluting stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting provide
similar long-term safety and efficacy in patients presenting with
significant coronary artery disease involving the left main coronary
artery?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis including
4394 patients, the 2 revascularization techniques provided similar
long-term outcomes in terms of death, myocardial infarction, and
stroke. Coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with a
significant reduction in the risk of repeat revascularization.
Meaning Although patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting benefit from a lower risk of repeat revascularization, if
a patient wishes to avoid the morbidity associated with surgical
revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention is a safe
and effective alternative.

 the original trials with semiparametric penalized likelihood es-
timation of the hazard function was fitted to obtain the com-
bined HR.23 All analyses were performed with R, version 3.3.1
(R Foundation).
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
With respect to the primary end point, several analyses were
conducted: (1) inspection of individual trial influence by
removing each trial independently using a random-effects
model,24 (2) selection of patients with low to intermediate
CAD complexity (SYNTAX score 1-32),21 (3) comparison
according to DES generation,25 and (4) reconstruction of
individual patient data, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and estima-
tion of HR by a shared frailty model.26,27 We assessed the
influence of individual trials by influence analyses for each
of the secondary end points and explored the effect of DES
generation on repeat revascularization and the secondary
composite end point.
Finally, the SYNTAX trial has suggested that outcomes of
patients undergoing PCI differ depending on the presence or
absence of LMCA stenosis.26 However, this trial had no power
to detect differences between the 2 patterns of CAD, and no
additional randomized trials have tested such a hypothesis. In
a supplementary analysis, we compared safety outcomes be-
tween patients with and without LMCA stenosis.
Bias Assessment
Trial-level qualitative assessment was performed using the
7-domain Cochrane Collaboration tool.14 The risk of bias was
classified as high, unclear, or low.14 We assessed the reliabil-
ity of the results for each outcome according to Grading of Rec-
ommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE).27
Results
Characteristics of the Included Studies
After removal of duplicates and merging of data from inde-
pendent searches, we identified 6569 reports (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). Search results are reported in eTable 2 in the
Supplement. After screening at the title and abstract level, 14
potentially eligible trials were identified. After full-text as-
sessment, 4 randomized clinical trials7,8,21,26,28-31 were in-
cluded in the primary analysis. The LMCA stenosis cohort of
the SYNTAX trial26,28-30,32 was included in the primary analy-
sis.The3-vesseldiseasecohortoftheSYNTAXtrial32and2ran-
domized clinical trials33,34 of patients with multivessel CAD
(MV-CAD) without LMCA involvement were included for
supplementary analyses. The list of trials included for pri-
mary and secondary analyses is reported in eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement.
All but 1 of the included studies were prospective, multi-
center, open-label, and reporting 5-year follow-up; the
EXCEL trial7 had a 3-year follow-up. A total of 4394 patients
(PCI, 2197; CABG, 2197) were included in the primary analy-
sis.Ofthese,3371(76.7%)weremen;pooledmeanagewas65.4
years. Trial design and main characteristics of the patients are
summarized in the Table and eTables 3-5 in the Supplement.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria of each trial are listed in eTable
6 in the Supplement.
Primary End Point
Percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG showed com-
parable outcomes (Figure 1B) both by fixed-effect (HR, 1.06;
95% CI, 0.90-1.24; P = .48) and by random-effects (HR, 1.06;
95% CI, 0.85-1.32, P = .60) models. The EXCEL trial7 had the
highest relative weight (35.9%). There was a moderate
degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 42.5%, P = .16). Kaplan-Meier
analysis did not show significant differences between treat-
ments over time (Figure 1A), with a cumulative incidence of
18.3% (319 events) in the PCI group and 16.9% (292 events)
in the CABG group at 5-year follow-up. Within the first 2
years, PCI exhibited a numeric advantage over CABG; how-
ever, from 3 to 5 years, CABG showed a nonsignificant
advantage over PCI. Risk estimation by a shared frailty
model showed similar safety of the techniques (HR, 1.05;
95% CI, 0.90-1.23; P = .53).
Influence analysis showed that heterogeneity was mainly
due to the NOBLE trial8 (Figure 1B), which was the only trial
favoring CABG (omitting NOBLE: HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.80-
1.15; P = .66; I2 = 0%). After including only patients with
SYNTAX scores of 1 to 32, the results remained consistent
(Figure 1B) (random effects: HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.74-1.41;
P = .89). The grouping of trials according to DES generation did
not show significant differences (Figure 1B), with compa-
rable pooled estimates (first-generation: HR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.68-1.20; P = .49; second-generation: HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.82-
1.73; P = .36). Effect size was uniform within the first-
generation DES group (I2 = 0%, P = .95), while the second-
generation DES group showed high heterogeneity (I2 = 71.4%,
P = .06) as an expression of the contrasting results of the
EXCEL and NOBLE trials.7,8
The comparison between trials of patients with LMCA
stenosisandthoseofpatientswithMV-CADwithoutLMCAste-
nosis showed a significant difference regardless of the model
applied(fixedeffect:P = .01;randomeffects:P = .04)(Figure2).
Descriptive data of trials including patients with MV-CAD are
reported in eTables 7-11 in the Supplement. After pooling all
trials regardless of the anatomic pattern, at long-term follow-
up, PCI was associated with a significantly increased risk
(random effects: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45; P = .03).
Secondary End Points
With respect to repeat revascularization (Figure 3A), PCI was
associatedwithasignificantlyhigherriskcomparedwithCABG
(HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.42-2.05; P < .001). A total of 313 events oc-
curred in the PCI group and 184 events occurred in the CABG
group. Effect size was consistent across trials (I2 = 0%, P = .87).
The grouping of trials according to DES generation did not sig-
nificantly change the results (Figure 3B). The second-
generationDES(HR,1.63;95%CI,1.29-2.06;P < .001)andfirst-
generation DES (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.37-2.45; P < .001) groups
showed a similar risk of repeat revascularization (P = .54). At
influence analysis, removal of each trial independently pro-
duced trivial changes (Figure 3C).

 Regarding the secondary composite end point of all-
cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascu-
larization (eFigure 2, upper left in the Supplement), PCI was
associated with an increased risk compared with CABG (HR,
1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.44; P < .001) without significant heteroge-
neity across included trials (I2 = 0%, P = .58). Influence analy-
sis showed consistent results (eFigure 2, lower left in the
Supplement). First- and second-generation DES groups were
associated with a similar risk increase (eFigure 2, right in the
Supplement).
Analyses of all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial in-
farction, and stroke are shown in Figure 4 and eFigure 3 in the
Supplement. There was a comparable risk of death between
PCI and CABG in both all-cause (random effects: HR, 1.04; 95%
CI, 0.81-1.33; P = .77) and cardiac (random effects: HR, 1.00;
95% CI, 0.72-1.39; P = .99), with mild heterogeneity and lim-
ited influence of individual trials. Although the risk of myo-
cardial infarction was comparable between techniques (ran-
dom effects: HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.85-2.58; P = .17), high
heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 67.4%, P = .03) as a result of
the risk increase in the PCI arm of the NOBLE trial8 (omitting
NOBLE: HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.76-1.67; P = .54; I2 = 27.3%) and the
comparable incidence between treatments observed in the
EXCEL trial7 (omitting EXCEL: HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.26-3.02;
P = .003; I2 = 0.6%). The risk of stroke was comparable be-
tween PCI and CABG (random effects: HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.39-
1.92; P = .72), with a high degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 62.7%,
P = .045) mainly as a consequence of the increased incidence
observed after PCI in the NOBLE trial8 (omitting NOBLE: HR,
0.63; 95% CI, 0.37-1.09; P = .10; I2 = 9.1%). Stent or graft oc-
clusion was documented less frequently in patients treated
with PCI compared with CABG (eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment), with differences according to the model used and
detection of substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 87.6%, P < .001)
mainly introduced by the EXCEL trial,7 where stent occlusion
was less frequent than graft occlusion (omitting EXCEL: HR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.45-1.64; P = .64; I2 = 31.0%).
The comparison between trials of patients with LMCA
stenosisandthoseofpatientswithMV-CADwithoutLMCAste-
nosis showed mixed results according to the model applied.
Overall,therewasasignificantdifferencebetweenthe2groups
of trials for the outcomes of all-cause death and myocardial

2.59; P = .004) associated with PCI compared with CABG.

pared with CABG (random effects: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49-

 Discussion
The main finding of this meta-analysis is that, in patients with
significant LMCA stenosis, both PCI with DESs and CABG are
associated with a comparable risk of all-cause death, myocar-
dial infarction, or stroke at long-term follow-up. Cumulative
Kaplan-Meier curve reconstruction did not show significant
differencesovertime,andlong-termsafetywasacceptablewith
both PCI and CABG. The risk of repeat revascularization is the
most important difference between techniques, with a higher
risk for PCI at long-term follow-up compared with CABG.
The use of first-generation DESs has been traditionally
considered one of the explanations for the differential effec-
tiveness between PCI and CABG in early randomized trials.
In this respect in the EXCEL and NOBLE trials,7,8 patients
who underwent PCI were treated with new-generation DESs.
However, in our analysis, neither the risk of repeat revascu-
larization nor the risk of the primary end point between
techniques was influenced by DES generation. Considering
the large amount of evidence supporting the superior antire-
stenotic properties of second-generation DESs compared
with first-generation DESs,25,35-37 it might be speculated that
the superiority of CABG in this respect is driven by protec-
tion against the need for further revascularization in lesions
outside the treated segment. In the EXCEL and NOBLE
trials,7,8 a several-fold increased risk of revascularization
outside the target lesion was observed with PCI compared
with CABG.
We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary end
point including only patients with low to intermediate com-
plexity of CAD (according to the SYNTAX score20) without
detecting significant variations in treatment effects. In
the SYNTAX trial,26 the stratification of patients with LMCA
stenosis according to SYNTAX score terciles showed signifi-
cant differences in the primary outcome. However, in the
PRECOMBAT and EXCEL trials,7,21 the largest number of
events occurred in tercile 23 to 32 and there were no signifi-
cant differences across terciles; however, in the NOBLE trial8
the distribution of events was higher in the first tercile.
These findings may reflect limitations of the anatomic
SYNTAX score and support the use of tools also accounting
for clinical characteristics.39 The risk of issues arising relat-
ing to revascularization completeness, arterial grafting, and
off-pump surgery is presented in eAppendix 2 in the Supple-
ment. The risk of all-cause death and cardiac death between
the techniques was similar at long-term follow-up. However,
although the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke were
also similar, we observed numeric variations between the
techniques that are both likely attributable to heterogeneity
introduced by the NOBLE trial.8 With respect to myocardial
infarction in the NOBLE trial,8 there was a substantial risk
increase with PCI. This finding can be partially explained by
the definition of myocardial infarction used in the trial8 that
excluded periprocedural events, which generally are more
frequent in patients undergoing CABG than PCI and some-
times large enough to be prognostically relevant over the
long term. Moreover, although the incidence of periproce-

 dural myocardial infarction between PCI and CABG in
the NOBLE trial8 seemed comparable, data were collected
in only approximately half of the patients. However, as
observed in the SYNTAX trial,30 a numeric increase in myo-
cardial infarction may be partially explained by a possible
superior protection of grafts against ischemic events due to
CAD progression in nontarget lesions and a possible increase
in periprocedural events in the higher number of patients
requiring repeat revascularization after PCI. Similarly, with
respect to stroke, the risk between techniques was reduced
or comparable in all but the NOBLE trial,8 in which an unex-
pected numeric increase in events occurred after PCI.
The reason for the heterogeneity introduced by the NOBLE
trial8 is unclear. The main clinical, angiographic, and proce-
dural characteristics of patients enrolled in the NOBLE trial8
were overall comparable to or even more favorable for PCI (eg,
15% patients with diabetes, 91.7% completeness of revascu-
larization, and 74% poststenting intravascular ultrasonogra-
phy) than in other trials.
Percutaneous coronary intervention presents a higher risk
of a composite end point of major adverse cardiac and cere-
brovascular events, including repeat revascularization, com-
pared with CABG as a consequence of the significant excess in
repeat revascularization. Trial design should take into ac-
counttheprominentimpactofrepeatrevascularizationindriv-
ing differences in this end point. Moreover, it is likely inadvis-
able in this setting to combine safety end points (ie, all-cause
death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) with an efficacy end
point (ie, repeat revascularization). In patients with LMCA ste-
nosisundergoingPCIorCABG,theimportanceofendpointand
estimator selection has been recently highlighted in the Drug-
Eluting Stent for Left Main Coronary Artery Disease registry.40

The risk of repeat revascularization
was significantly higher in patients
randomized to percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI). The
effect was consistent across trials,
and no heterogeneity was detected.
Although the excess risk of repeat
revascularization with PCI vs
coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) was numerically lower in
second-generation drug-eluting
stents (DESs) compared with
first-generation DESs, testing for
subgroup differences was
nonsignificant and CABG continued
to perform better than PCI.

 AfterassessingtheevidenceaccordingtoGRADE,wefound
high-quality evidence both with respect to the primary com-
posite end point and repeat revascularization and moderate
quality of evidence for death. However, evidence quality for
myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent or graft occlusion was
low, and caution must be exercised in interpreting the obser-
vations in relationship to these end points. Qualitative assess-
ment of trials according to the Cochrane Collaboration tool
showed an overall low risk of bias. Nevertheless, differences
in patient characteristics and study definitions may have con-
tributed to the variations in treatment effects seen.
Finally, we undertook additional analyses including ran-
domized clinical trials comparing PCI with CABG in patients
with MV-CAD without LMCA involvement to provide a com-
prehensive overview of long-term safety of PCI vs CABG. We
observed significant between-group differences in the pri-
mary end point, with a higher risk of events with PCI com-
pared with CABG in patients with MV-CAD and a borderline
increased risk for all-cause death and myocardial infarction.
These findings support the considerable influence of the pat-
tern of CAD on treatment effects. Beyond unmeasured clini-
cal differences between patients with the 2 CAD patterns, the
difference in treatment effects may be related to several
complementary factors, such as the larger reference vessel di-
ameter of diseased coronary segments in the LMCA stenosis
subset and the more diffuse extent of CAD in the MV-CAD sub-

 set. Against this, the similar pooled risks of stroke in the LMCA
stenosis and MV-CAD groups are likely explained by the close
relationshipofeventswithproceduralinvasivenessratherthan
CAD disease pattern.
In aggregate, these findings suggest that, in patients with
significant stenosis of the LMCA and predominantly low to in-
termediate CAD complexity, both PCI and CABG are valid ap-
proaches to revascularization. Patient preference should be
taken into consideration regarding the risks of periproce-
dural complications of surgery and long-term repeat revascu-
larization after PCI. Patients with low surgical risk may ben-
efit from CABG owing to more sustained effectiveness as
evidenced by the reduced incidence of repeat revasculariza-
tion. However, if a patient is not a good candidate for surgery
or wishes to avoid the morbidity associated with surgical re-
vascularization, PCI is a safe and effective alternative.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, the absence of indi-
vidual patient data and partial disclosure of results in original
publications did not permit us to stratify patients according
to every SYNTAX score tercile, perform additional subgroup
analyses, and explore the impact of technical aspects of PCI
procedures both in terms of the number of stents implanted
to treat LMCA bifurcation (1 or 2 stents) and technique per-
formed (eg, culotte, V-stenting, T and protrusion, crush, and
double kissing crush).41 In addition, although the use of in-
travascular imaging guidance has been associated with higher
event-free survival after LMCA stenting,42 data on this issue
are not uniformly available across trials. Second, in this meta-
analysis, the SYNTAX trial26,28-30,32 was considered as 2 co-
horts. However, the randomization process was stratified ac-
cording to the presence or absence of LMCA stenosis. Third,
in the PRECOMBAT trial,21 the composite end point included
ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization instead of re-
peat revascularization as in the other trials. Fourth, in the
NOBLE trial8 during early enrollment, 11% of patients in the
PCI group received first-generation DESs. Fifth, available fol-
low-upintheEXCELtrial7was3years,whiledatafromtheother
trials were from 5-year analyses. Although the effect on pooled
estimate of possible effect size variation is expected to be lim-
ited, the results of the EXCEL trial7 at 5 years may significantly
change. In addition, fewer than half of the patients enrolled in
the NOBLE trial8 reached the 5-year follow-up, which reduces
the precision of estimated cumulative incidences. Finally, the
absence of significant differences between PCI and CABG in
terms of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke may
beduetolackofstatisticalpower.Alloftheincludedtrialshave
a noninferiority design—some with large margins and compu-
tations made for composite end point, including also repeat re-
vascularization. Even after pooling the data, the total number
of patients was not large enough for superiority testing.
Conclusions
InpatientsundergoingrevascularizationofLMCAstenosis,the
PCIandCABGtechniquesareassociatedwithacomparablerisk
of a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or
stroke at long-term follow-up. However, patients treated with
PCI present a higher risk of repeat revascularization com-
pared with those who undergo CABG. Evidence quality with
respect to both of these end points was high. Risk of death—
both all-cause and cardiac—was comparable between the 2
strategies, and only numeric differences in myocardial infarc-
tion and stroke were observed. The group of trials including
patients with CAD involving LMCA stenosis tended to show
divergingresultsfromthegroupoftrialsincludingpatientswith
MV-CAD without LMCA stenosis. In aggregate, these findings
suggest that, in patients with significant stenosis of the LMCA
and overall low to intermediate CAD complexity, both PCI and
CABG are valid approaches to revascularization.
