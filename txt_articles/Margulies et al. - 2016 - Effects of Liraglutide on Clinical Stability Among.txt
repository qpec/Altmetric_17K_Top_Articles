IMPORTANCE Abnormal cardiac metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of advanced
heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1) agonists have shown cardioprotective effects in early clinical studies of patients with
advanced heart failure, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.
OBJECTIVE To test whether therapy with a GLP-1 agonist improves clinical stability following
hospitalization for acute heart failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized
clinical trial of patients with established heart failure and reduced LVEF who were recently
hospitalized. Patients were enrolled between August 2013 and March 2015 at 24 US sites.
INTERVENTIONS The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide (n = 154) or placebo (n = 146) via a daily
subcutaneous injection; study drug was advanced to a dosage of 1.8 mg/d during the first 30
days as tolerated and continued for 180 days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was a global rank score in which all
patients, regardless of treatment assignment, were ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to
death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged proportional change in
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values
indicate better health (stability). Exploratory secondary outcomes included primary end point
components, cardiac structure and function, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, and
combined events.
RESULTS Among the 300 patients who were randomized (median age, 61 years [interquartile
range {IQR}, 52-68 years]; 64 [21%] women; 178 [59%] with type 2 diabetes; median LVEF of
25% [IQR, 19%-33%]; median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2049 pg/mL
[IQR, 1054-4235 pg/mL]), 271 completed the study. Compared with placebo, liraglutide had no
significant effect on the primary end point (mean rank of 146 for the liraglutide group vs 156 for
the placebo group, P = .31). There were no significant between-group differences in the number
of deaths (19 [12%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 1.10
[95% CI, 0.57-2.14]; P = .78) or rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41%] vs 50 [34%],
respectively; hazard ratio, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.89-1.88]; P = .17) or for the exploratory secondary
end points. Prespecified subgroup analyses in patients with diabetes did not reveal any
significant between-group differences. The number of investigator-reported hyperglycemic
events was 16 (10%) in the liraglutide group vs 27 (18%) in the placebo group and hypoglycemic
events were infrequent (2 [1%] vs 4 [3%], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and
reduced LVEF, the use of liraglutide did not lead to greater posthospitalization clinical
stability. These findings do not support the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.

H
eart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in
the United States with more than 4 million admis-
sionsperyearfrom2003-2009.1Abnormalcardiacme-
tabolism, including reduced fatty-acid oxidation and myocar-
dial insulin resistance, contributes to the syndrome of heart
failure.2 As heart failure progresses, these abnormalities be-
come more pronounced and are observed in both patients with
andwithouttype2diabetes.3,4Nocurrentheartfailuretherapy
targets these metabolic derangements. In this context, agents
that improve glucose metabolism could be repurposed as new
therapies for patients with advanced heart failure.
Agents that increase glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) sig-
naling have shown potential in preclinical and early clinical
studies. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is an endogenous incretin
hormone that improves insulin sensitivity with minimal risk
of hypoglycemia. Recombinant GLP-1 increases myocardial
insulin sensitivity5 and is cardioprotective during ischemia in
model systems.6
In a pilot study,7 recombinant GLP-1 was associated with
favorable effects on myocardial function and exercise toler-
ance in patients with advanced heart failure and reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and GLP-1 agonists re-
duced rates of hospitalization for patients with heart failure
in a single-center, retrospective analysis.8 Together, these data
suggest potential benefit of GLP-1 agonists for patients with
advanced heart failure.
We performed the Functional Impact of GLP-1 for Heart
Failure Treatment (FIGHT) study to test the hypothesis that
sustained therapy with a GLP-1 agonist initiated during the
postacute hospital discharge period is associated with greater
clinical stability through 180 days in patients with advanced
heart failure and reduced LVEF. Furthermore, we hypoth-
esized that the treatment effects would be greater in patients
with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Study Design
The FIGHT trial was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-
controlled randomized clinical trial of patients with estab-
lished heart failure and reduced LVEF. The trial was con-
ducted by the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute) Heart Failure Clinical Research Network, which is
funded by the NHLBI, with approval by the research net-
work’
s protocol review committee and monitored by an inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring board. The ethics com-
mittee at each participating site approved the trial design
(the full protocol appears in Supplement 2).
At 24 sites in the United States, patients with heart fail-
ure and reduced LVEF were identified based on hospital ad-
mission records. All participants provided written informed
consent and were enrolled during either the last 24 hours of
his or her hospitalization for heart failure or the 2-week inter-
val after the hospitalization.
After baseline evaluations, including echocardiographic
measures, the 6-minute walk test, the Kansas City Cardiomy-
opathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and blood tests, patients were
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the GLP-1 agonist
liraglutide or placebo as a daily subcutaneous injection.
At 30-, 90-, and 180-day study visits, follow-up testing was
performed. Participants were called at a mean of 210 days
(SD, 7 days) to determine their adverse event status. Details of
the study design have been described.9
Study Population
Patientswererequiredtohaveanestablisheddiagnosisofheart
failure and a LVEF of 40% or lower during the preceding 3
months. To target a relatively high-risk patient population, the
inclusion criteria were (1) a recent (within 14 days) hospitaliza-
tion for an acute heart failure syndrome despite already receiv-
ing evidence-based therapies and (2) a preadmission oral di-
uretic dose of at least 40 mg of furosemide or an equivalent.
Key exclusion criteria were (1) recent acute coronary syn-
dromeorcoronaryintervention,(2)knownintoleranceofGLP-1
agonist therapy, and (3) severe renal, hepatic, or pulmonary
disease. Recognizing that myocardial insulin resistance has
beenobservedinpatientswithadvancedheartfailurebutwith-
out diabetes,3,4 this trial did not exclude patients who did not
have type 2 diabetes.
Study Drug and Randomization
Active therapy in this trial consisted of a human GLP-1 analog
with97%homologytonativeGLP-1,liraglutide(Victoza),which
has been approved for use by the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. Patients were randomly assigned to liraglutide or pla-
cebo in a 1:1 ratio.
Apermutedblockrandomizationschemestratifiedbyclini-
cal site and type 2 diabetes status was performed with an au-
tomated web-based system to ensure relatively equal distri-
bution of patients to each group within each site. The protocol
involved uptitration of study drug dosage as tolerated every
14 days from 0.6 mg/d to 1.2 mg/d to 1.8 mg/d during the first
30 days of the trial. Liraglutide and placebo were packaged
identically to maintain blinding.
Concomitant Medications
The protocol allowed for adjustment of standard heart failure
therapies, including attempted uptitration of neurohormonal
Key Points
Question Does therapy with the glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist
liraglutide improve clinical stability in patients with advanced
heart failure?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 300 adults with
advanced heart failure, liraglutide had no significant effect on
posthospitalization clinical stability based on a global rank score of
time to death, time to rehospitalization for heart failure, and
time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide level. There was no benefit observed among
the 178 patients with type 2 diabetes.
Meaning These findings do not support the use of liraglutide for
improving clinical stability in patients with advanced heart failure
and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.

antagonists, during and after the participants’initial hospital-
ization. In patients with type 2 diabetes, plans for risk reduc-
tion of hypoglycemia included (1) adjustments to doses of in-
sulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide),
(2) at least daily monitoring of blood glucose, and (3) close
follow-up with the treating physician managing the partici-

symptoms of hypoglycemia and the appropriate treatment.
Study End Points
End point assessments were blinded to treatment assign-
ment. The primary end point was a global rank score in which
all participants, regardless of treatment assignment, were
ranked across 3 hierarchical tiers: time to death, time to re-
hospitalization for heart failure, and time-averaged propor-
tional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-proBNP) level from baseline to 180 days. Higher values in-
dicate better health (stability). Patients who died during the
180-day study period were ranked based on the time of their
death with earliest death being ranked first and then later
deaths. Next, patients who did not die were ranked based on
the time to their first rehospitalization for heart failure, such
that the individual with the earliest rehospitalization re-
ceived the next lowest rank and then those with later rehos-
pitalizations. Those patients who neither died nor were
rehospitalized were ranked based on their time-averaged pro-
portional changes in NT-proBNP levels from the least to most
favorable change. The mean rank score was then compared be-
tween groups. In this scheme, a higher mean rank score indi-
cates greater overall stability for patients with heart failure.10
All-cause mortality was considered an objective end point.
Rehospitalization for heart failure was distinguished from re-
hospitalizations due to other causes by a blinded adjudica-
tion committee based on the presence of both clinical mani-
festationsofworseningheartfailureandadditionalorincreased
therapy specifically for the treatment of worsening heart fail-
ure. Levels of NT-proBNP were determined at a central core
laboratory that was blinded to treatment assignment.
The key exploratory secondary end points included (1) the
individual components of the primary end point, (2) time to
other prespecified cardiac events (including emergency de-
partment visits), (3) changes in cardiac structure and func-
tion (by echocardiographic measures) from baseline to 180
days, (4) functional status based on 6-minute walk distances
at 30, 90, and 180 days, and (5) changes in the KCCQ clinical
summary score.
Comparison of treatment effects in patients by type 2 dia-
betes status was a prespecified subgroup analysis. Tertiary end
points included changes in metabolic biomarkers (ie, hemo-
globin A1c, weight, and fasting lipid levels) and changes in cys-
tatin C. Safety end points were reported by site investigators
using an online system and were not adjudicated.
Statistical Analysis
The full statistical analysis plan appears in Supplement 3. All
analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple and included all randomized patients (Figure 1). Analy-
sis of the global rank end point was based on the Wilcoxon test
statistic and calculated using the NPAR1WAY procedure within
SAS software (SAS Institute Inc).
To evaluate for potential clustering of treatment re-
sponses by site, a mixed model was also computed using PROC
MIXED with terms for treatment effect and random effects for
sites.Forbinaryoutcomes,logisticregressionanalysiswasused
for the estimated odds ratio and associated 95% CI to com-
pare liraglutide with placebo.
Unadjusted time-to-event comparisons were conducted
using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests. All
P values are 2-sided with a level of significance of .05 and no
adjustments for multiple comparisons.
Power Calculation
We regarded a reduction of 25% in deaths or rehospitaliza-
tionsforheartfailureasclinicallysignificantbasedonthetreat-
ment effects of neurohormonal blockade,11 and a reduction of
0.5 SD in NT-proBNP level as clinically significant based on as-
sociations between serial natriuretic peptide levels and fu-
ture events.12 Under these assumptions, the planned sample
size of 300 patients (150 participants per treatment group) pro-
vided approximately 92% power.9 This planned sample size
of 300 patients provided more than 90% power to detect dif-
ferences of 0.4 SD for the continuous secondary end points;
however, these secondary end points remain exploratory ab-
sent adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Missing data only affected the primary end point when
patients did not die and were not rehospitalized for heart fail-
ure. Among patients who did not die or were not rehospital-
ized for heart failure, data were available for the time-
averaged NT-proBNP levels in 136 cases and were missing in
35 cases. On these occasions, a LOESS smoother (adjusted for
sex and treatment group) was used to impute missing values.
Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data for
the secondary and tertiary end points. No adjustment for miss-
ing information was made for the safety end points. All statis-
tical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4.

Results
Patients and Treatment
Between August 2013 and March 2015, a total of 154 patients
were randomized to receive liraglutide and 146 to receive pla-
cebo (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2
groups (Table 1). Across the entire cohort, the median age was
61 years (interquartile range [IQR], 52-68 years), the median
duration of heart failure was 6.2 years (IQR, 3.3-11.2 years), and
more than 85% of participants in both groups had been hos-
pitalized for heart failure at least once during the year prior to
the hospitalization for heart failure that was required for study
eligibility.
Ischemic heart disease was the primary origin of heart fail-
ure in 82% of participants, and most patients had 1 or more co-
morbid conditions. Fifty-nine percent of randomized partici-
pants(178patients)hadtype2diabetes.Themedianbodymass
index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) was 32 (IQR, 26-37).
Twenty-nine percent of participants had New York Heart
Association class II heart failure, 63% had class III, and 5% had
class IV. Despite high rates of disease-modifying therapies for
heart failure, the median NT-proBNP level at the time of en-
rollment was 2049 pg/mL (IQR, 1054-4235 pg/mL) and the me-
dian LVEF was 25% (IQR, 19%-33%).
At least 1 dose of study drug was received by 150 of the 154
randomized to receive liraglutide and 145 of the 146 patients
randomized to receive placebo. In the liraglutide group, 60%
of participants achieved the target maximal dose of 1.8 mg/d,
21%receivedamaximumof1.2mg/d,and16%receivedamaxi-
mumof0.6mg/d,whereasthecorrespondingproportionswere
71%, 19%, and 10% for the placebo group.
In both groups, 29% of patients permanently discontin-
ued use of the study drug prior to study termination. Of those
who discontinued the study drug prior to rehospitalization for
heart failure or death, this occurred in 19% of patients in the
liraglutide group and in 17% of patients in the placebo group.
The median duration that participants received the study drug
was 25.0 weeks (IQR, 8.6-25.9 weeks) in the liraglutide group
and 25.0 weeks (IQR, 11.4-26.0 weeks) in the placebo group
(eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).
Primary End Point
In the primary intention-to-treat analysis, there was no signifi-
cant between-group difference in the global rank scores (mean
rank of 146 in the liraglutide group vs 156 in the placebo group;
Wilcoxon rank sum P = .31), with higher rank indicating better
stability (Table 2). To account for possible clustering of re-
sponses by enrollment site, we conducted a sensitivity analy-
sis with site as a covariate; the results were nearly identical to
the primary analysis (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Components of the Primary End Point
For the components of the primary end point, there was no sig-
nificant between-group difference in the number of deaths (19
[12%] in the liraglutide group vs 16 [11%]) in the placebo group;
hazard ratio [HR], 1.10 [95% CI, 0.57-2.14]; P = .78) (Figure 2A),
rehospitalizations for heart failure (63 [41%] in the liraglutide
groupvs50(34%)intheplacebogroup;HR,1.30[95%CI,0.89-
1.88]; P = .17), or the composite of death or rehospitalization
for heart failure (72 [47%] in the liraglutide group vs 57 [39%]
in the placebo group; HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.92-1.83]; P = .14)
(Figure 2B). Among participants who were alive and not re-
hospitalized for heart failure, the time-averaged propor-
tional change in NT-proBNP level was 1.52 (SD, 1.71) times the
baseline levels in the liraglutide group and 1.44 (SD, 1.22) times
the baseline levels in the placebo group (P = .94; Figure 2C).
Exploratory Secondary End Points
Compared with placebo, there was no significant effect of li-
raglutide on any of the prespecified secondary end points in-
cluding changes in cardiac structure and function from base-
lineto180days,6-minutewalktestdistances,theKCCQclinical
summary score, emergency department visits, and the com-
posites of death and rehospitalization for heart failure with or
without emergency department visits (Table 2).
Exploratory Tertiary End Points
Compared with placebo, liraglutide treatment was associated
with greater weight decreases at 30 days (intergroup differ-
ence, −1.7 kg [95% CI, −2.9 to −0.5 kg]; P = .004) and 90 days
(intergroupdifference,−1.9kg[95%CI,−3.4to−0.4kg];P = .01),
with no significant difference at 180 days (intergroup differ-
ence, −1.8 kg [95% CI, −3.9 to 0.3 kg], P = .09). Increases in cys-
tatinC(amarkerofrenaldysfunction)weresignificantlygreater
at 180 days in patients in the liraglutide group compared with
thoseintheplacebogroup(between-groupdifference,0.16mg/L
[95% CI, 0.04 to 0.28] mg/L; P = .009). An exploratory analy-
sislimitedtopatientswhocontinuedtakingthestudydrugwas
not significant (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).
Diabetes Subgroup Analysis
Among the 178 patients with diabetes (baseline characteristics
appearineTable2inSupplement1),therewasnostatisticallysig-
nificantbetween-groupdifferenceinglobalrankscore(meanrank
of85fortheliraglutidegroupvs94fortheplacebogroup;P = .27)
(eTable3inSupplement1).ThePvalueforinteractionwas0.60
for treatment based on type 2 diabetes status.
Similar to the overall study population, the findings for the
secondary clinical outcomes were not significantly different
betweentheliraglutideandplacebogroups.However,thepoint
estimates consistently suggested higher risk of heart failure–
related events with liraglutide and were higher in magnitude
in patients with diabetes than in the overall study population
(Table 2, Figure 3, and eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
Investigator-Reported Safety Events
Severe adverse events observed with liraglutide and placebo
are reported in eTable 4 in Supplement 1. The number of in-
vestigator-reported hyperglycemic events was 16 (10%) in the
liraglutide group vs 27 (18%) in the placebo group and hypo-
glycemiceventswereinfrequent(2[1%]intheliraglutidegroup
vs 4 [3%] in the placebo group). The study was not ad-
equately powered for statistical comparisons of the rates of ad-
verse events between groups.

Discussion
The GLP-1 agonist liraglutide did not improve posthospital-
ization clinical stability in patients with advanced heart
failure and reduced LVEF despite prior studies indicating
that GLP-1 therapy might ameliorate mechanisms of myo-
cardial insulin resistance reported in patients with severe
cardiomyopathies.3,4 The absence of favorable effects of
liraglutide on secondary end points based on echocardio-
graphic measures, 6-minute walk distance, or quality
of life based on the KCCQ clinical summary score also sup-
ports the conclusion that liraglutide did not improve heart
failure status.

Effect of Liraglutide in Patients With Heart Failure and Reduced LVEF

Although the global rank end point based on a hierarchy
of death, rehospitalization, and biomarker analysis does not
allow definitive conclusions about the effect of liraglutide on
clinical outcomes, this study effectively excludes any large fa-
vorable effects with liraglutide on the composite of time to
death or rehospitalization for heart failure (Figure 2B).
To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter random-
ized clinical trial specifically designed to determine whether
a GLP-1 agonist benefits a high-risk subset of patients with es-
tablished heart failure. The high-risk features of this trial’
s
population were evident in (1) their recent hospitalization for
heartfailureatentry,(2)thesubstantialmajoritywithNewYork
Heart Association class III or IV symptoms, (3) their low me-
dian LVEF (25%) and 6-minute walk distance (<240 m), and
(4) the elevated baseline levels of serum creatinine (1.5 mg/dL)
and NT-proBNP (2049 pg/mL) despite treatment with
evidence-based medical therapies. High risk was ultimately
confirmed by high rates of death (11.7%) and rehospitaliza-
tion for heart failure (37.7%) during the 6-month follow-up pe-
riod in the entire cohort.
There are several potential explanations for failure of li-
raglutide to improve heart failure status in this trial. Because
GLP-1 agonists promote glucose-dependent insulin secre-
tion, this trial raises concerns about whether enhancing en-
dogenous insulin secretion is advantageous in the setting of
heart failure. To the extent that GLP-1 agonists mitigate insu-
linresistance,thistrialalsoraisesquestionsaboutwhetherpre-
viously demonstrated2 myocardial insulin resistance in heart
failure models is a maladaptive mechanism in patients with
advancedheartfailureandreceivingstandardmedicaltherapy.
These concerns are supported by the fact that other agents that
augment insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, specifi-
cally dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and thiazolidin-
ediones, have generated adverse heart failure signals.13,14
Alternatively, differences between the results in this trial
and the encouraging earlier study using recombinant GLP-17
could be due to the cardioprotective roles of GLP-1 metabo-
lites, such as GLP-1(9-36)amide, which act independently of
the GLP-1 receptor and are not generated by GLP-1 agonists
like liraglutide.15 It is also possible that patients with
advanced heart failure, like those in this trial, are refractory
to the otherwise beneficial effects of GLP-1 agonists or are
prone to detrimental extracardiac actions of GLP-1, such as
impairment of renal function, that are not apparent in other
populations.16 Even though most baseline parameters were
equivalent in the 2 treatment groups, a slightly higher pro-
portion of ischemic heart disease (86%) among liraglutide-
treated patients (vs 77% in the placebo group) could have
increased their risk of adverse outcomes.
This trial provides complementary information to an
increasing number of large randomized trials that assess car-
diovascular outcomes, including heart failure, associated
with treatments for type 2 diabetes. These include cardiovas-
cular safety studies of sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones,
dipeptidyl-dipeptidase inhibitors,13,17,18 GLP-1 agonists,19 and
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors.20 In the Saxa-

Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI-53) trial,13 there was an increase in
hospitalizations for heart failure in the patients with diabetes
randomized to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor saxa-
gliptin who had no prior diagnosis of heart failure (HR, 1.30
[95% CI, 1.03-1.65]; P = .03). Among the 234 patients with
New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms of heart
failure in the SAVOR-TIMI-53 trial,13 there was a nonstatisti-
cally significant increase in hospitalizations for heart failure
in patients treated with saxagliptin (HR, 1.75 [95% CI, 0.94-
3.36]). The increase in risk in SAVOR-TIMI-53 was highest
among patients with elevated levels of natriuretic peptides,
symptomatic heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Similar
increases in risk of heart failure were noted in patients with
renal insufficiency or elevation in natriuretic peptides, which
are cardinal features of advanced heart failure. To our knowl-
edge, in trials of patients with diabetes taking GLP-1 agonists,
there are no prior reports focusing on patients who already
have advanced heart failure.
In the absence of a beneficial effect on heart failure sta-
tus, it is important to define the efficacy and safety of liraglu-
tide for diabetes management in patients already at high risk.
In the patients with advanced heart failure and type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus in this trial, the efficacy of liraglutide for diabetes
management was supported by a reduction in hemoglobin A1c
and weight loss compared with the placebo-treated partici-
pants.However,nonsignificantincreasesinthenumbersofpa-
tients with diabetes experiencing adverse heart failure out-
comes, including the composite end point of time to death,
rehospitalization for heart failure or emergency department
visit, and signals of worsening renal function raise safety con-
cerns about the use of liraglutide in this patient population.
Together, these nonsignificant signals of harm suggest the
need for caution and close monitoring among clinicians con-
sidering initiation of liraglutide and other GLP-1 agonists for
weight loss or diabetes management in patients with heart fail-
ure and reduced LVEF. Our findings are not relevant to pa-
tients already treated with GLP-1 agonists because such pa-
tients were specifically excluded from this trial. Larger safety
trials21 may provide complementary insight into the safety of
liraglutide and other GLP-1 agonists in patients with less se-
vere and earlier stages of heart failure.
This study has some important limitations. Although sup-
ported by prior work10 and appropriate for a phase 2 trial, the
global rank score end point in this trial has not been validated
inpatientswithheartfailure.Inaddition,thistrialwasnotpow-
eredtodetectdifferencesinclinicaleventsorsafetyendpoints,
and it was not powered for subgroup analyses. The patients
enrolled in this trial had advanced heart disease, and as ex-
pected there were missing data, especially for functional met-
rics such as the 6-minute walk test. It is also possible that pa-
tients seen at referral centers within the NHLBI Heart Failure
Network are not representative of larger populations of pa-
tients with advanced heart failure treated outside academic
medical centers.
Conclusions
Among patients recently hospitalized with heart failure and
reducedLVEF,theuseofliraglutidedidnotleadtogreaterpost-
hospitalization clinical stability. These findings do not sup-
port the use of liraglutide in this clinical situation.
