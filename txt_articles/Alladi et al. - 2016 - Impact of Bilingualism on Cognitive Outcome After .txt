G
iven the social burden of cognitive impairment caused 
by cerebrovascular disease,1 several studies have identi-
fied factors that influence cognitive outcome after stroke.2 A 
potential protective factor not yet examined in this context 
is bilingualism. Recent research suggests that bilingualism 
is associated with better cognitive function in aging3 and a 
later onset of dementia, including vascular dementia (VaD).4 
These findings are interpreted in the context of an advantage 
in executive control and enhanced cognitive reserve in bilin-
guals.5 However, this effect is confounded by immigration 
and education and continues to be debated.6 To explore this 
further, we studied the association between bilingualism and 
cognitive outcome of stroke. We hypothesized that if bilin-
guals differ from monolinguals in vascular risk factor pro-
file, they would present with a later occurrence of stroke. In 
contrast, if bilinguals have indeed a better cognitive reserve, 
we would expect in them the same age of stroke but a more 
favorable cognitive outcome. Nizam’s Institute of Medical 
Sciences, Hyderabad, is a clinical research center well suited 
to explore this relationship. Patients with stroke and dementia 
are assessed by the same team.7,8 Bilingualism is common, 
without the confounding effect of immigration, and has been 
systematically studied.4
Methods
Patients
The patients were participants in the Nizam’s Institute of Medical 
Sciences stroke registry, initiated to study clinical profile and outcome 
in consecutive cases of acute stroke.7 Records of patients evaluated 
during 2006 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients with ischemic stroke 
>18 years and evaluated 3 to 24 months after stroke were included.
Patients with disabling stroke (modified Rankin Scale score>4), 
severe comorbidities, inadequate data, and preexisting dementia were 
excluded. The Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences ethics commit-
tee approved the study.
Clinical Evaluation
All patients were evaluated with a detailed history and clinical evalu-
ation by experienced behavioral neurologists, stroke specialists (S.A., 
S.K., and R.K.), and trained psychologists using a structured diag-
nostic protocol adapted from the Cambridge Memory Clinic mod-
el.9 Cognitive evaluation was done using Addenbrooke's Cognitive 
Examination–Revised (ACE-R), a multidimensional cognitive 
screening tool, adapted for Telugu- and Hindi-speaking populations 
in Hyderabad. ACE-R has been validated in large studies of stroke 
outcome.10 Clinical Dementia Rating scale was used to assess sever-
ity of dementia. All patients underwent brain imaging (computed to-
mographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging). Bilingualism was 
defined as the ability to communicate in 2 or more languages in inter-
action with other speakers of these same languages.4
Background and Purpose—Bilingualism has been associated with slower cognitive aging and a later onset of dementia. In 
this study, we aimed to determine whether bilingualism also influences cognitive outcome after stroke.
Methods—We examined 608 patients with ischemic stroke from a large stroke registry and studied the role of bilingualism 
in predicting poststroke cognitive impairment in the absence of dementia.
Results—A larger proportion of bilinguals had normal cognition compared with monolinguals (40.5% versus 19.6%; 
P<0.0001), whereas the reverse was noted in patients with cognitive impairment, including vascular dementia and 
vascular mild cognitive impairment (monolinguals 77.7% versus bilinguals 49.0%; P<0.0009). There were no differences 
in the frequency of aphasia (monolinguals 11.8% versus bilinguals 10.5%; P=0.354). Bilingualism was found to be an 
independent predictor of poststroke cognitive impairment.
Conclusions—Our results suggest that bilingualism leads to a better cognitive outcome after stroke, possibly by enhancing 
cognitive reserve.

Definition of Outcome Variables
All patients with stroke were classified into the following diag-
nostic groups: VaD, vascular mild cognitive impairment, apha-
sia, and strokes with normal cognition. VaD was diagnosed as 
fulfilling National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 
and Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement 
en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria for possible or probable 
VaD.11 Vascular mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed in subjects 
with impairment in at least 1 cognitive domain subscore of ACE-R, 
that is, attention, memory, fluency, language, and visuospatial do-
mains, and absence of dementia on clinical interview or Clinical 
Dementia Rating scale. Impairment in a cognitive domain was de-
fined if the score on the ACE-R subdomain was <2.00 SD below the 
mean level of age and education-matched norms. Patients with vas-
cular mild cognitive impairment and VaD were considered to have

poststroke cognitive impairment. Diagnosis of aphasia was made by 
2 experienced behavioral neurologists (S.A. and S.K.) and trained 
psychologists by obtaining a detailed history for language deficits 
and assessment of language through a clinical interview supported 
by language subscores of ACE-R. Normal cognitive performance was 
defined as the absence of impairment on any one of the cognitive 
domain subscores of ACE-R based on age and education-matched 
norms. Details of ACE-R adaptation and normative data in local lan-
guages are available in Methods section of this article and Tables I 
and II in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Clinical profiles of monolingual and bilingual subjects were com-
pared using independent samples t test for continuous variables and 
χ2 test for categorical variables. Series of binary logistic regressions 
were conducted to investigate the effect of relevant variables (enter 
method in SPSS). The presence of cognitive impairment was the fixed 
factor for the logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed 
using SPSS 20.0 for windows software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), and 
significance was set at P<0.05. Bonferroni-adjusted P values were 
followed to correct for multiple testing issues.
Results
Of the 608 patients, VaD was diagnosed in 189 (31.1%), vas-
cular mild cognitive impairment in 159 (26.2%), aphasia in 
67 (11.0%), and 193 (31.7%) were found to be normal. On 
comparing for poststroke cognitive outcomes, a larger propor-
tion of bilinguals had normal cognition, whereas the reverse 
was noted in the stroke patients with cognitive impairment 
(Table 1). There were no differences in the outcome of aphasia 
between monolinguals and bilinguals. On excluding aphasics, 
bilinguals had higher scores on total ACE-R and across atten-
tion, fluency, and visuospatial domains, but not on memory 
and language (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
To determine factors associated with poststroke cognitive 
impairment, we compared patients with normal (n=193; 35.7%) 
and impaired cognition (n=348; 64.3%). Older age, lower edu-
cational and occupational status, monolingualism, and vascular 
risk factors were significant (P<0.003; following Bonferroni 
correction for multiple testing). To study whether bilingualism 
was independently associated with poststroke cognitive impair-
ment, we performed a series of logistic regressions. There was 
no colinearity effect among the factors. The first logistic regres-
sion incorporated demographic variables, the second included 
stroke-related variables, and the third examined risk factors. 
These regression models demonstrated variance of 31%, 24%, 
and 28%, respectively. Significant variables from the analyses 
were entered into a final logistic regression analysis. Following 
a Bonferroni correction, bilingualism and age were found to be 
significant independent predictors (Table 2).
Discussion
This is the first study examining systematically the relationship 
between bilingualism and cognitive outcome after stroke. The 
percentage of patients with intact cognitive functions post stroke 
was more than twice as high in bilinguals than in monolinguals. In 
contrast, patients with cognitive impairment were more common 
in monolinguals. In addition to other well-established factors,2 
bilingualism emerged as an independent predictor of poststroke 
cognitive impairment. Furthermore, no differences were found 
between bilinguals and monolinguals in vascular risk factors or 
in the age at stroke, suggesting that the observed differences are 
not because of a healthier lifestyle among bilinguals.
The only outcome not influenced by bilingualism was the 
frequency of aphasia. Although this might look surprising at 
the first sight, this finding is in-line with current research, sug-
gesting that the mechanism underlying the protective effect 
of bilingualism is not because of better linguistic but execu-
tive functions acquired through a lifelong practice of language 
switching.6 The higher scores of bilinguals on attention and 
fluency domains with no difference in language subscore 
support this hypothesis. To conclude, our results support the 
notion of a protective role of bilingualism in the development 
of poststroke cognitive impairment.
