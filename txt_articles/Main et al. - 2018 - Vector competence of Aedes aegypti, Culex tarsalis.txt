Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged since 2013 as a significant global human health threat follow-
ing outbreaks in the Pacific Islands and rapid spread throughout South and Central America.
Severe congenital and neurological sequelae have been linked to ZIKV infections. Assess-
ing the ability of common mosquito species to transmit ZIKV and characterizing variation in
mosquito transmission of different ZIKV strains is important for estimating regional outbreak
potential and for prioritizing local mosquito control strategies for Aedes and Culex species.
In this study, we evaluated the laboratory vector competence of Aedes aegypti, Culex quin-
quefasciatus, and Culex tarsalis that originated in areas of California where ZIKV cases in
travelers since 2015 were frequent. We compared infection, dissemination, and transmis-
sion rates by measuring ZIKV RNA levels in cohorts of mosquitoes that ingested blood
meals from type I interferon-deficient mice infected with either a Puerto Rican ZIKV strain
from 2015 (PR15), a Brazilian ZIKV strain from 2015 (BR15), or an ancestral Asian-lineage
Malaysian ZIKV strain from 1966 (MA66). With PR15, Cx. quinquefasciatus was refractory
to infection (0%, N = 42) and Cx. tarsalis was infected at 4% (N = 46). No ZIKV RNA was
detected in saliva from either Culex species 14 or 21 days post feeding (dpf). In contrast,
Ae. aegypti developed infection rates of 85% (PR15; N = 46), 90% (BR15; N = 20), and 81%
(MA66; N = 85) 14 or 15 dpf. Although MA66-infected Ae. aegypti showed higher levels of
ZIKV RNA in mosquito bodies and legs, transmission rates were not significantly different
across virus strains (P = 0.13, Fisher’s exact test). To confirm infectivity and measure the
transmitted ZIKV dose, we enumerated infectious ZIKV in Ae. aegypti saliva using Vero cell
plaque assays. The expectorated plaque forming units PFU varied by viral strain: MA66-
infected expectorated 13±4 PFU (mean±SE, N = 13) compared to 29±6 PFU for PR15-
infected (N = 13) and 35±8 PFU for BR15-infected (N = 6; ANOVA, df = 2, F = 3.8, P =
0.035). These laboratory vector competence results support an emerging consensus that
Cx. tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus are not vectors of ZIKV. These results also indicate

Author summary
Assessing the ability of common mosquito species to transmit Zika virus (ZIKV) and
characterizing variation in mosquito transmission of different ZIKV strains is important
for estimating regional outbreak potential and for prioritizing local mosquito control
strategies for Aedes and Culex species. In this study, we evaluated the laboratory vector
competence of Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex tarsalis that originated in
areas of California where ZIKV cases in travelers since 2015 were frequent. We observed
variation in infection loads between ZIKV strains in Ae. aegypti, but transmission rates
were not different. In addition, there was a positive relationship between ZIKV RNA levels
in infected mosquitoes ascertained from bodies and ZIKV RNA transmission rates. Our
data add to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of Aedes aegypti as a ZIKV
vector and refute Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis as vectors.
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that was first isolated in 1947 in the
Zika forest of Uganda from a sentinel rhesus macaque [1]. Since its discovery, human ZIKV
cases have been reported across Africa and Asia, but until 2007 the virus received little atten-
tion from researchers as it was thought to cause only mild disease. Following epidemics in
Micronesia in 2007, French Polynesia in 2013, and Brazil in 2015 [2], ZIKV has now been con-
firmed as a cause of the neurological disease Guillain-Barre syndrome and congenital disor-
ders, including microcephaly in infants [3]. Despite a dramatic decline in Brazilian cases since
2016, ZIKV remains a significant global human health threat [4], as other countries including
Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador reported an increase in cases in 2017 [5].
Reducing mosquito vector populations is an effective way to mitigate mosquito-borne dis-
ease transmission [6]. Therefore, identifying ZIKV vector species is crucial for accurate risk
assessments for mosquito transmission and to target vector control measures to mitigate ZIKV
disease. Several Aedes species have been identified as competent vectors in laboratory studies,
including the primary vector Aedes (Ae.) aegypti [7–21], Ae. albopictus [7,8,10,11,15,17,19,20,
22,23], Ae. notoscriptus [10], Ae. camptorhynchus [10], Ae. luteocephalus [24], Ae. vexans [25],
and Ae. vittatus [24]. Culex species generally do not become infected with ZIKV and are inca-
pable of transmitting [7,9,10,12,14,17,23,26–29]. Exceptions include a study from Guadalajara,
Mexico, where infectious ZIKV was detected in pooled mosquito tissue samples from field-
collected Cx. tarsalis, Cx. coronator, and Cx. quinquefasciatus [30]. ZIKV RNA has also been
detected in pooled field samples of Cx. quinquefasciatus from China [31]. Evidence for ZIKV
transmission by Culex species is limited to Cx. quinquefasciatus and includes ZIKV RNA
detected in saliva on Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards provided to a cohort of
laboratory-infected mosquitoes from Brazil [32] and transmission to 1-day-old mice from
mosquitoes from China, although inconsistently with other murine studies [33–35], no murine
fatality was noted [36].

 Previous studies demonstrate that ZIKV vector competence is more complex than simple
mosquito species-level designations, and thus region-specific mosquito genotypes and multi-
ple ZIKV strains must be evaluated to assess region-specific vector competence. For example,
Ae. aegypti from the Dominican Republic transmit ZIKV isolated from Cambodia in 2010
(FSS 13025) and Mexico in 2015 (MEX1-7) more effectively than Ae. aegypti from Salvador,
Brazil [21]. Furthermore, ZIKV from Brazil in 2015 (BeH815744) has higher infectivity than a
French Polynesian strain from 2013 (H/PF13) in Ae. aegypti from Singapore [8]. The source of
virus also matters; fresh ZIKV was more infectious in comparative studies than freeze-thawed
virus [12].
California (CA) vector control districts have been combating stable Ae. aegypti populations
in the state since 2013 [37], including in many counties in Southern CA. In addition, between
2015 and March 2018, 640 travel-associated ZIKV infections were reported in CA [38], 137
(21% of cases in state) of which were in Los Angeles County where the Ae. aegypti used for vec-
tor competence experiments here were collected. Due to the presence of Ae. aegypti and
numerous travel-associated ZIKV infections, there is a risk of the establishment of local mos-
quito-borne ZIKV transmission. Additionally, genetic variation between Central Valley and
Southern CA Ae. aegypti populations has been observed [39], even between populations in
neighboring cities, such as Fresno and Clovis [40]. These findings indicate that gene flow is
limited between Ae. aegypti populations and leave open the possibility that important traits,
such as vector competence, may also vary among Ae. aegypti throughout the state. To better
assess local ZIKV transmission risk, we evaluated the laboratory vector competence of Ae.
aegypti from Los Angeles, CA, for ZIKV isolates from Puerto Rico (2015), Brazil (2015), and
Malaysia (1966). We also evaluated the laboratory vector competence of two highly abundant
Culex species, Cx. quinquefasciatus from Orange County, CA, and Cx. tarsalis from Kern
County, CA, with a Puerto Rico (2015) ZIKV strain.
Materials and methods
Sources of ZIKV strains, mosquitoes, and mice
Three Asian-lineage strains of ZIKV were used in our experiments. A 2015 Puerto Rican strain
was isolated from human serum in 2015 (PR15, PRVABC59), passaged 4 times in Vero cells,
and sequenced. The coding sequence for the complete genome of the passaged we used was
identical to GenBank accession number KX601168. An Asian-lineage Malaysian ZIKV strain
isolated from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in 1966 (MA66, P6-740 [41]) that had been passaged in
suckling mouse brains 6 times and once in Vero cells before it was received from the Centers
for Disease Control was passaged once more in Vero cells. The complete coding genome seq-
uence of our passage of MA66 was 100% identical to GenBank accession number KX601167.1.
A Brazilian strain isolated from human serum in 2015 (BR15, SPH2015) was passaged 3 times
in Vero cells and sequenced. The complete genome coding sequence of BR15 was identical to
GenBank accession number KU321639. Strains MA66 and PR15 were obtained from Dr.
Aaron Brault at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Dr. Mike Busch at Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, provided the BR15
strain. All ZIKV strains and their source Vero cells were confirmed mycoplasma negative by
PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent Mycoplasma Plus PCR Primer Kit,
Santa Rosa, CA.)
The Ae. aegypti mosquitoes used in this study were field-collected as larvae in Los Angeles,
CA, in 2016 and morphologically identified. The F6 generation was used for this study. Adult
Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were field-collected as adults in Orange County, California in
2016 and morphologically identified. The F5 generation was used for this study. The Cx. tarsalis

 mosquitoes were field-collected in the Kern National Wildlife Refuge, Kern County, CA in
2002, morphologically identified, and have been maintained continuously in colony since.
Female interferon-deficient (IFN-α/βR−/−; C57BL/6) mice aged 4–8 weeks (B6.129S2-If-
nar1tm1Agt/Mmjax, The Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA) were used for all experiments.
Differences in ZIKV viremia levels and kinetics in male versus female mice have not been
observed [33].
ZIKV vector competence experiments
Mice were inoculated with 5 log10 Vero plaque forming units (PFU) of ZIKV via subcutaneous
injection. ZIKV-infected mice were presented to mosquitoes 2 days post-inoculation, at peak
viremia [33]. Mice were anesthetized prior to mosquito exposure with a ketamine (VETone
Zetamine CIII, 75 mg/kg), xylazine (AnaSed, 10 mg/kg), and acepromazine (AceproJect, 1
mg/kg) solution administered intraperitoneally. The ZIKV viremia in each mouse was deter-
mined by Vero cell plaque assay from 30 μL of whole blood collected immediately prior to the
mosquito feed. Viremic mice were presented for two cohorts of adult female mosquitoes 30–
60 minutes on one of three arrangements depending on species: (1) 25 Cx. tarsalis in pint car-
tons (amazon.com), (2) 50 Ae. aegypti in pint cartons, or (3) >100 Cx. quinquefasciatus in a 1
ft3 mesh cage (BugDorm, MegaView Science, Taiwan). Engorged females were sorted from
non-fed individuals by vacuum aspiration. Mosquito ages at the time of blood-feeding were
4–14 days post eclosion (dpe) for Cx. tarsalis, 14–21 dpe for Cx. quinquefasciatus, and 4–12
dpe for Ae. aegypti. Cx. tarsalis and Ae. aegypti were held at 26˚C, 80% relative humidity, and
12:12 h light:dark cycle. Cx. quinquefasciatus were maintained at room temperature (22˚C
and 33% relative humidity) to ensure survival. All mosquitoes had constant access to 10%
sucrose before and after blood-feeding, except during a 24-hour starvation period prior to pre-
sentation of the viremic mice. At days 14 and 21 post bloodfeed, mosquitoes were cold-anes-
thetized at -20˚C for 5 minutes and then legs and wings were removed with forceps while
immobilized on ice. Saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis into a capillary tube con-
taining fetal bovine serum (FBS, GenClone) for 20 minutes. Individual bodies, legs+wings,
and the saliva sample from each mosquito were stored separately in 2 mL tubes containing a 5
mm glass bead and 250 μL Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented
with 50μg/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and 20% FBS. All samples were stored at -80˚C until
further processing.
ZIKV RNA extraction
Mosquito tissues and glass capillary tubes containing saliva samples were homogenized in
DMEM by shaking for 2 minutes at 30 shakes/second using a Tissuelyser (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Viral RNA was extracted using the MaxMax Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Thermo-
Fisher, Waltham, MA). A total of 50 μL of homogenate for mosquito tissue and 100 μL of saliva
samples were extracted. All RNA extracts were eluted in 50 μL of elution buffer (Buffer EB,
Qiagen) and stored at -80˚C until further testing.
ZIKV RT-qPCR
ZIKV RNA titers were determined for each body, legs+wings, and saliva sample using the Taq-
man Fast Virus One-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher) reverse transcription RT-qPCR kit with
a previously described ZIKV-specific assay (primers: ZIKV 1086, ZIKV 1162c, and ZIKV
1107-FAM; [42]). At least two technical replicates were performed for all samples. Samples
with a mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of 38 or below were considered positive for ZIKV RNA.
This limit of detection was determined from prior testing of serially diluted samples of known
ZIKV vector competence in mosquitoes from California

 ZIKV RNA concentrations with the same extraction and RT-qPCR reagents and protocols and
equipment [43].
Infectivity of mosquito saliva
To estimate infectious ZIKV in expectorated Ae. aegypti saliva, viral titrations were performed
on a random sample of RT-qPCR-positive saliva samples at the second or third thaw in Vero
cell culture by plaque assay. In brief, cell monolayers were inoculated with 110 μL of undilute
saliva from individual mosquitoes mixed with DMEM containing 2% (vol/vol) FBS, and 100
U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. After a one hour incubation period to allow for viral infection
of cells, 0.8% agarose/DMEM was added to cover the cells. The plates were incubated at 37˚C
in 5% CO2 for 8 days. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.05%
crystal violet. Plaques were visualized as holes in the Vero cell monolayer and counted to deter-
mine PFU values. The limit of detection of the assay was 2.3 PFU where 110 μL of the total
saliva sample (250 μL) was inoculated directly onto the cells. Since the volume of saliva was
limited, each sample was tested in just 1 replicate.
Infection definitions, cohort grouping, and statistical analyses
In this study, we calculated infection rates as the number of RT-qPCR positive individual bodies
divided by the number of individuals that ingested blood and were tested, dissemination rates
as the number of RT-qPCR positive pooled leg & wing sets from each individual divided by the
number of individuals that ingested blood and were tested, and transmission rates as the num-
ber of RT-qPCR positive saliva samples divided by the total number of individuals that ingested
blood and were tested. For Ae. aegypti and Cx. tarsalis, multiple cohorts of the same species fed
on different mice infected with the same ZIKV strain with slight (�1 log10) variations in vire-
mias. Preliminary analysis across same-species cohorts that fed on different mice infected with
the same ZIKV strain revealed no significant differences (Fisher’s exact test, P>0.05) in infec-
tion, dissemination and transmission rates. We therefore combined the data presented for each
ZIKV strain for Ae. aegypti and Cx. tarsalis, while also reporting the magnitudes of viremia in
all mice (Table 1). Comparisons of ZIKV RNA levels and PFU in saliva samples between ZIKV
strains was performed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for pairwise compari-
sons (reported as Padj) and ZIKV RNA detection rates were compared using two-tailed Fisher’s
exact tests (scipy.stats). Data were plotted using matplotlib (Python).

 the 46 individuals tested (4%) had low levels of ZIKV RNA at 14 dpf (Ct < 38; 48 ZIKV
genomes/body). Both infected individuals also had detectable ZIKV in their legs and wings,
indicating disseminated infections. Neither of the ZIKV-infected Cx. tarsalis contained detect-
able ZIKV RNA in their saliva samples (Table 1). The Cx. tarsalis infection rate significantly
increased from 4% to 30% (2/46 to 6/20, P<0.01 Fisher exact test) from 14 to 21 dpf. Among
the 6 infected Cx. tarsalis at 21 dpf, ZIKV RNA was detected in 1 leg and wing sample but, con-
sistent with a lack of transmission 14 dpf, no ZIKV RNA was detected in the saliva (Table 1).
We did not detect ZIKV RNA in any Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito tissues 14 (N = 42) or 21
dpf (N = 37; Table 1).
Ae. aegypti from Los Angeles, CA, were highly competent laboratory ZIKV
vectors
At 14 dpf, ZIKV infection, dissemination, and transmission rates measured by the presence of
ZIKV RNA in Ae. aegypti that ingested MA66 were 86%, 79%, and 53%, respectively (Table 1).
For Ae. aegypti that ingested ZIKV PR15, the infection, dissemination, and transmission rates
on 14 dpf were 85%, 78%, and 65%, respectively (Table 1). ZIKV BR15-exposed individuals
harvested 15 dpf had infection, dissemination, and transmission rates of 90%, 90%, and 75%,
respectively (Table 1). ZIKV RNA infection, dissemination, and transmission rates in Ae.
aegypti that ingested MA66 or PR15 at 21 dpf were equal or higher than 14 dpf rates. The
transmission rate between 14 and 21 dpf increased significantly in Ae. aegypti infected with
MA66 (53% vs. 87%, P<0.01, Fisher’s exact), but not PR15 (65% vs. 74%, P = 0.59, Fisher’s
exact; Table 1). Transmission rates were not significantly different across viruses (P = 0.13,
Fisher’s exact).
The mean ZIKV RNA level (8.9 log10) in MA66-infected bodies was significantly higher
than the mean for BR15 (8.2 log10, ANOVA, degrees of freedom (df) = 2, F-statistic (F) = 16.3,
Padj<0.01) and PR15-infected individuals (8.4 log10, ANOVA, df = 2, F = 16.3, Padj<0.01; Fig
1). The mean ZIKV RNA level in MA66-infected leg+wing tissue (7.5 log10) was also signifi-
cantly higher than PR15-infected leg+wing samples (7.0 log10, ANOVA, df = 2, F = 8.4,
Padj<0.01). Higher ZIKV RNA levels in MA66-infected Ae. aegypti likely do not reflect the

 dose ingested, where flavivirus infections of mosquitoes typically show a strong dose response,
since viremias in both ZIKV MA66-infected mice were lower than those for PR15. ZIKV RNA
levels in saliva were not significantly different among strains (ANOVA, df = 2, F = 0.96,
P = 0.39).
A bimodal distribution of ZIKV RNA levels was observed across cohorts of ZIKV PR15- or
MA66-infected bodies, with high (>6 log10 genomes/body) and low (<6 log10 genomes/body)
clusters of individuals (Fig 1). MA66-infected Ae. aegypti that were highly infected (>6 log10
genomes/body) had higher transmission rates (81%, N = 54) compared to low titer (<6 log10
genomes/body) individuals (5%, N = 19; P<0.0001, Fisher’s exact). We also examined the rela-
tionship between infection, dissemination and transmission at an individual mosquito level
for Ae. aegypti (Fig 2). Most Ae. aegypti that became infected developed disseminated infec-
tions. Individuals with higher (red/pink in figure) ZIKV RNA levels in legs+wings were more
likely to transmit ZIKV RNA than mosquitoes with low (blue in figure) RNA levels in legs
+wings. None of the PR15-infected Ae. aegypti with <6 log10 genomes/body transmitted ZIKV
RNA (N = 4).
To confirm infectivity and measure the transmitted ZIKV dose, plaque assays were per-
formed on Ae. aegypti saliva collected 14 or 15 dpf to enumerate infectious ZIKV in Vero cell
plaque forming units (PFU). Out of 45 RTq-PCR positive saliva samples that were tested by
plaque assay, 32 (71%) yielded at least 1 detectable plaque. The expectorated PFU varied by

were assayed 15 dpf, MA66 and PR15 cohorts were assayed 14 dpf. Each dot represents the mean of two or more RT-qPCR
technical replicates. The dashed lines represent the limits of detection (LOD). Dots below dashed line represent tested samples
with an undetectable Ct or a Ct value of >38. The LOD for saliva was lower than for tissues because RNA was extracted from a
higher proportion of the saliva sample volume. Asterisks show significant differences in means across groups of the same tissue
type, P<0.01, ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc test. No asterisk indicates no significant difference across groups.

 viral strain: the MA66-infected individuals transmitted 13±4 PFU (mean±SE, N = 13) com-
pared to 29±6 for PR15 (N = 13) and 35±8 for BR15 (N = 6; ANOVA, df = 2, F = 3.8,
P = 0.035; Fig 3).
Discussion
Understanding the mosquito species that vector ZIKV is important for estimating regional
outbreak potential and for informing local mosquito control strategies, especially since Aedes
and Culex species differ in life history traits and host-seeking behaviors that could impact con-
trol efforts. For example, oviposition traps bias towards Ae. aegypti that lay in artificial contain-
ers [44] while Culex typically prefer natural pools [45]. For Cx. tarsalis, we detected an overall
ZIKV infection rate of 12% (8/66) in mosquitoes tested 14 and 21 dpf. Disseminated infections
in Cx. tarsalis were detected at <5% on both 14 and 21 dpf, with high Ct values indicating low
ZIKV RNA levels. We postulate that the disseminated infections detected in Cx. tarsalis may
reflect false positives given that mosquitoes with true disseminated infections typically achieve
very high viral RNA titers due to prolonged infection of multiple tissues. The absence of
detectable ZIKV RNA in saliva at 14 or 21 dpf is evidence that Cx. tarsalis from CA is not capa-
ble of transmitting ZIKV in laboratory experiments. Furthermore, Cx. tarsalis feeds less often
on human hosts compared to the highly anthropophilic Ae. aegypti [45–47], making human-
mosquito-human ZIKV transmission by Cx. tarsalis unlikely. We also found no evidence for
ZIKV infection of Cx. quinquefasciatus from California, with no ZIKV RNA detected in bod-
ies, legs/wings or saliva from nearly 80 individuals. This is the first data showing ZIKV vector
competence for California mosquitoes, and it supports results from many other studies which
demonstrate that Cx. quinquefasciatus is not a competent laboratory vector of ZIKV. By con-
trast, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes exhibited infection rates of 85–90% and transmission rates of 53–
80% at 14 dpf. The transmitted dose of infectious ZIKV by Californian Ae. aegypti is consistent
with the range of doses observed in similar studies with Brazilian Ae. aegypti [48,49].
Fig 2. Individual mosquito ZIKV RNA levels in body, legs+wings, and saliva of Aedes aegyptifrom Los Angeles,
CA, USA. Ae. aegypti from Los Angeles ingested blood from viremic ZIKV-infected interferon receptor deficient mice
that had been inoculated with different ZIKV strains. Each colored box represents an individual mosquito sample
showing the magnitude of ZIKV RNA detected in each body (B), legs+wings (LW), and saliva (S). The red to blue
color scale shows high (red) to low (blue) ZIKV RNA levels. Samples with no detectable ZIKV RNA are colored white.
ZIKV BR15-infected mosquitoes were not tested 21 dpf.

Fig 3. Infectious ZIKV levels in expectorated Ae. aegyptisaliva. Saliva from Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from Los
Angeles, CA, USA, infected with either MA66, PR15, or BR15 ZIKV was collected in capillary tubes 14 (MA66 and
PR15) or 15 (BR15) dpf. Vero cell plaque assays were performed on RT-qPCR positive saliva expectorants to quantify
infectious viruses. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 2.3 PFU and is shown as a dashed line. Dots below the
dashed line represent saliva samples with no detectable plaques.

 Ae. aegypti that ingested ZIKV MA66 in our laboratory vector competence studies devel-
oped higher ZIKV RNA levels than PR15- or BR15-infected mosquitoes. This pattern con-
trasted with the lower transmission rate and lower expectorated PFU of MA66-infected Ae.
aegypti at 14 dpf.
A possible explanation for the lower transmissibility of MA66 at 14 dpf is that it lacks a A188V
mutation in the NS1 gene that both PR15 and BR15 possess, which has been linked to higher
infectivity (where infectivity can influence transmissibility) in mosquitoes when interferon-defi-
cient mice are used for blood-feeding [7]. ZIKV strains from recent American outbreaks have also
been shown to exhibit higher infection and transmission rates than historic Asian-lineage strains
[8]. Additional vector competence studies involving region-specific Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
mosquito populations with sequenced genomes and multiple distinct ZIKV isolates will improve
our understanding of the both mosquito and virus genetics involved in ZIKV vector competence,
which could inform our ability to accurately estimate regional outbreak potential.
Among ZIKV MA66-infected Ae. aegypti, we observed that mosquitoes with low RNA copy
numbers in bodies were less likely to transmit than those with infections that exceeded 6 log10
genomes per body. This pattern is consistent with the presence of a midgut barrier to infection
[50]. In that case, the mosquitoes with low body RNA levels represent infections that have not
escaped the midgut while mosquitoes with high body RNA levels correspond to individuals
with ZIKV that has disseminated to secondary amplification tissues.
This laboratory vector competence study confirmed that Ae. aegypti from Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, USA, can transmit Asian lineage ZIKV and that Cx. tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus
are inefficient ZIKV vectors. Given that Culex mosquitoes are poor ZIKV vectors and seek pri-
marily non-human hosts, they are unlikely to facilitate a ZIKV outbreak. Thus, vector control
efforts targeting ZIKV should remain focused on reducing urban Aedes populations.
