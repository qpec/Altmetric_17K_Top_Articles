The social and economic burden of
frontotemporal degeneration
ABSTRACT
Objective: To quantify the socioeconomic burden of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) compared
to previously published data for Alzheimer disease (AD).
Methods: A 250-item internet survey was administered to primary caregivers of patients with
behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia, FTD with motor neuron disease,
corticobasal syndrome, or progressive supranuclear palsy. The survey included validated scales
for disease staging, behavior, activities of daily living, caregiver burden, and health economics,
as well as investigator-designed questions to capture patient and caregiver experience with FTD.
Results: The entire survey was completed by 674 of 956 respondents (70.5%). Direct costs
(2016 US dollars) equaled $47,916 and indirect costs $71,737, for a total annual per-patient
cost of $119,654, nearly 2 times higher than reported costs for AD. Patients $65 years of
age, with later stages of disease, and with bvFTD correlated with higher direct costs, while
patients ,65 years of age and men were associated with higher indirect costs. An FTD diagnosis
produced a mean decrease in household income from $75,000 to $99,000 12 months before
diagnosis to $50,000 to $59,999 12 months after diagnosis, resulting from lost days of work
and early departure from the workforce.
Conclusions: The economic burden of FTD is substantial. Counting productivity-related costs,
per-patient costs for FTD appear to be greater than per-patient costs reported for AD. There is
a need for biomarkers for accurate and timely diagnosis, effective treatments, and services to
reduce this socioeconomic burden. Neurology® 2017;89:2049–2056

Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), the most common dementia in individuals ,60 years of
age, affects z60,000 individuals in the United States.1–4 FTD presents as a diverse group of
degenerative disorders with prominent features of language, personality, behavior, cognition,
and motor dysfunction made up of 4 predominant clinical phenotypes: behavioral-variant FTD
(bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia, FTD with motor neuron disease, and Parkinson-plus
movement disorders due to progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal syndrome.1,3 Although
presentations differ, all forms of FTD cause progressive loss of function and independence over 2
to 20 years.1–6 The prevalence of FTD is 15 to 22 per 100,000 adults. Compared to Alzheimer
disease (AD),7,8 FTD affects younger patients and progresses more rapidly, and patients’ symp-
toms are more variable. Many patients are in their prime earning years, have dependent children,
and have difficulty accessing services developed primarily for older adults with dementia. To
quantify the socioeconomic burden of FTD, we conducted a web-based survey to characterize

 the patient and caregiver experience with
FTD-related resource use, health-related qual-
ity of life (HRQoL), and per-patient annual
costs.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The Florida Atlantic University Institu-
tional Review Board approved the study as exempt.
Survey design. Participants (n 5 956) were recruited via an-
nouncements on the Association for Frontotemporal Degenera-
tion website, newsletter, social media, and e-mail blasts. We
designed a 250-question internet survey using Qualtrics Survey
Software (Provo, UT) to characterize the socioeconomic burden
of FTD from the primary caregivers’ perspective. No identifiable
personal information was collected. Validated scales for clinical
characterization and resource use were used whenever available
and are described below. We used investigator-generated ques-
tions to describe the personal burden of FTD when no validated
scale existed. We used these data to estimate the economic burden
of FTD. The survey was beta-tested and revised for clarity and
readability before its release to the FTD community. The survey
took z2 hours to complete.
Clinical characterization.
Informant-based questionnaires
characterized the patient’s symptoms and severity. The 10-
question Quick Dementia Rating Scale9 staged dementia sever-
ity (range 0–30, higher scores reflect greater impairment). The
12-question Neuropsychiatric Inventory10 assessed behavioral
aspects of disease (range 0–36, higher scores indicate more
behavioral symptoms). The 10-question Functional Activities
Questionnaire11 examined instrumental activities of daily living
(range 0–30, higher scores mean greater functional dependence).
The 12-question Zarit Burden Inventory12 assessed caregivers’
burden (range 0–36, higher scores mean greater burden). In
addition, respondents assessed patient disease stage severity at the
time of the survey on the basis of their opinion and direct
observation of the patient13,14 as mild, moderate, severe, or ter-
minal (capturing the last 6 months of life).
Health utility and resource use. We measured patients’ qual-
ity of life and health utility using the Health Utilities Index–3
(HUI3).15,16 The HUI3 measures health-state utility and provides
a summary score for HRQoL across 8 attributes (vision, hearing,
speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, pain), with
each attribute having 5 or 6 levels of ability/disability for a total
972,000 unique health states. The HUI3 provides utility scores
ranging from 1 (reflecting perfect health) to 0 (dead) with neg-
ative scores possible (minimum score 20.371) and reflecting
health states deemed “worse than being dead.”15 We estimated
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), representing quality-adjusted
life expectancy, by multiplying health utility by survival time.17
As is the case with health utility, negative QALYs are possible,
reflecting survival in health states being worse than death. Neg-
ative HUI3 and QALY scores reflect the respondents’ belief that
there is no perceived positive quality of life for the patient in this
state.
The Resource Utilization Inventory (RUI)18,19 measures
patient and caregiver dementia-associated costs, the use of formal
and informal care, and the loss of paid employment. There are 4
domains: direct medical care, direct nonmedical care, informal
care, and caregiver time. Actual costs are determined via Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, Evaluation and Manage-
ment codes, and Diagnosis Related Groups. We calculated the
mean response for each resource use question. We omitted
missing values unless the patient resided in dependent care and
the resource is used primarily by community-dwelling patients
(i.e., home health aides). In that case, we assumed that the
respondent did not use that resource in the event of nonresponse.
There were no differences between completers and noncomplet-
ers for any variable after correction for multiple comparisons.
We assigned dollar values to hospital admissions on the basis
of the admission-weighted average of Medicare reimbursements
for Diagnosis Related Groups 56 and 57 (degenerative nervous
system disorders, with and without a major complication or co-
morbidity). We used the Medicare reimbursement for an Evalu-
ation and Management visit for an established patient (CPT
99214) to assign a dollar value to office visits and CPT 97110
to assign a dollar value to physical therapy visits. We used esti-
mates from Genworth20 to assign dollar values to assisted living
care, nursing home care, and respite care. We adjusted nursing
home and assisted living costs downward by 8% to account for
the costs of food and shelter.21 We obtained costs for medical
equipment from the Medicare fee schedule.22
We estimated costs for paid home care using Genworth20 and
costs for unpaid care using wage estimates from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.23,24 Table e-1 at Neurology.org provides details
for cost estimates. We estimated lost productivity by asking
whether patients and caregivers were out of the labor force as
a result of FTD. We valued lost productivity for patients using
average annual earnings25 multiplied by 1.25 to account for fringe
benefits. We valued lost productivity for caregivers by subtracting
the annual cost of hiring a home health aide from average
earnings.
We calculated the annual per patient costs considering direct
costs (patient medical care, patient residential care, respite care,
patient medical equipment and supplies, and paid home care with
formal caregivers) and indirect costs (unpaid home care for family
and friends, patient lost wages, and caregiver lost wages). Average
costs were determined by multiplying the average use by the price
per item. For example, patients experienced an average of 0.6 hos-
pitalizations per year. If the typical reimbursement per admission
is $36,044, then the average cost in the sample is $21,626 (0.6 3
$36,044). We calculated direct and indirect costs by summing
across average costs for individual RUI items. Some respondents
answered only a subset of the cost-related questions. We calcu-
lated average costs on the basis of the subsample of respondents
who answered the relevant questions for each cost item.
Statistical analyses. Analyses were conducted with SPSS ver-
sion 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics charac-
terized the caregiver respondents and the patients. We compared
groups using analysis of variance for continuous variables and x2
tests for categorical variables. We compared median incomes
using Kruskal-Wallis tests. We used a generalized linear model
with a gamma distribution and log link to estimate the rela-
tionship between patient-level costs and patient characteristics
and summed costs by item at the individual level. We restricted
the sample to respondents who had nonmissing responses for at
least 15 of the 18 RUI items (n 5 595 respondents) and recoded
any remaining missing values to zero. We selected the cutoff of 15
to balance the benefit of including as many respondents in the
analysis as possible against the disadvantage of including re-
spondents with incomplete cost data. Respondents who answered
15 items were similar in terms of sex, age, disease type, and disease
duration to respondents who answered ,15.
RESULTS Sample characteristics. Nine hundred fifty-
six individuals started the survey, and 674 (70.5%)
completed it. There were no significant demographic

 differences between completers and noncompleters.
The patients were divided into 4 groups (table 1)
based on the caregiver’s assessment: mild, moderate,
severe, or terminal. The majority of caregiver re-
spondents were female spouses, while the majority of
patients were men. The diagnostic groups were
52.9% bvFTD, 21.1% primary progressive aphasia,
7.3% FTD with motor neuron disease, and 5.4%
progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal syn-
drome, while 13.3% were undefined FTD (i.e., the
respondent did not know the subtype). As demon-
strated in table 1, the caregiver global ratings matched
well with duration of disease and standardized rating
scales of global staging (Quick Dementia Rating
Scale),9 behavior (Neuropsychiatric Inventory),10 and
function
(Functional
Activities
Questionnaire).11
Caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Inventory)12 was not
different across stages of disease.
Changes in household income and lost days of work. At
the time of survey, 45% of caregivers still worked,
while 37% were no longer employed after the pa-
tient’s FTD diagnosis. Seventy-four percent of care-
givers worked full-time. Only 3.3% of patients were
still working. Caregivers reported lost days of work
due to patient health issues (25.6%) or caregiver
health issues (21.6%). Caregivers and patients who
were still working full-time reported a median loss of
7.0 days over the previous 4 weeks due to FTD-
related matters.
Respondents provided the total household income
for the patient and family 12 months before and 12
months after the FTD diagnosis (table 2). The overall
household income before diagnosis ranged from
$75,000 to $99,000 but declined after diagnosis to
$50,000 to $59,999 (p , 0.001). There were no dif-
ferences in the extent of loss of household income by
FTD subtype, caregiver type, or patient sex (table 2).
Patient and caregiver health costs associated with FTD.
We found that 67% of caregivers of patients with
FTD reported a notable decline in their health and
that 53% reported increased personal health care
costs calculated from the RUI. On average, caregivers
had 7 clinician visits and slightly less than 1 inpatient
admission per year. On average, patients had 6 over-
night respite stays, 16 daytime respite stays, 35 clini-
cian visits, and 2 hospital or emergency room visits.
In addition, 31.6% of respondents needed to hire
a paid caregiver several times per week.
Estimates of annual per patient costs. Total direct costs
(i.e., the value of goods and services for which there
are explicit monetary payments) were $47,916. Total

 indirect costs (the value of the changes in the provi-
sion of goods and services that are attributable to
FTD but for which there are no explicit monetary
payments) were $71,737. The sum of estimated
direct and indirect costs is $119,654.
Table 3 reports the relationship between patient
characteristics and costs. The sample used in the regres-
sion analysis had a higher proportion of men (69% vs
61%) but was otherwise similar in terms of age, stage,
underlying diagnosis, and disease duration. Patients
$65 years of age incurred higher direct costs
($17,900) but lower indirect costs ($25,000). Men
had higher indirect costs because they were more likely
to use unpaid care and to have stopped working
because of the disease. Women had higher direct costs,
mainly because they were more likely to live in nursing
homes or assisted living facilities. Patients with severe
or terminal stages of disease incurred higher direct costs
($54,000). Across the FTD subtypes, bvFTD had
higher direct costs ($13,030) than other subtypes.
Other costs associated with FTD. Caregivers also re-
ported patient-related crises during the prior year:
19% required an emergency department visit, 11%
required emergency medical services, 8% required
urgent psychiatric care, 6% required police inter-
vention, and 6% required contacting a lawyer. Poor
financial decisions by patients with FTD were re-
ported by 58% of respondents. Legal costs were re-
ported by 9.6% of respondents, attributed largely to
court appearances and attorney fees. The leading
reasons for court appearances included legal guard-
ianship (9.0%), bankruptcy (4.4%), loss of home
(3.9%), loss of business (3.8%), criminal cases
(3.2%), and civil lawsuits (2.7%). The leading rea-
sons for attorney fees included initiating a power of
attorney (25.9%), revising wills (22.9%), guardian-
ships (7.6%), and court appearances (5.8%).
Changes in HRQoL. Table 4 reports HUI315,16 scores
and QALYs17 by severity of disease, FTD subtype,
and caregiver-patient dyadic relationships. HUI3
scores and QALYs were lower for patients in the
severe and terminal stages, with scores indicating that
patients’ quality of life is worse than dead (p ,
0.001). Across all stages of disease, caregivers reported
declines in HRQoL regardless of relationship; how-
ever, QALYs were highest in female caregiver–male

 patient dyads and lowest in female caregiver–female
patient dyads. There were no significant differences in
HRQoL or QALYs by FTD subtypes.
Comparison to economic costs of AD. Lastly, we exam-
ined the cost analyses for annual direct, indirect, and
total costs reported for patients with dementia in pre-
vious studies (table 5). Most of the cited studies
examined patients with AD, mild cognitive impair-
ment due to AD, or nonspecified dementia. These
studies used a variety of data collection strategies,
including record reviews, structured interviews, and
validated scales. Studies from non-US sources were
converted to 2016 US dollars for comparison. Re-
ported costs were higher in more advanced stages of
dementia26 and in younger-onset and non-AD de-
mentias.19,27 Costs were greater in the United States
than in studies originating in other countries. Most
studies did not account for lost wages in the calcu-
lation of indirect costs and used HRQoL or QALYs
to assess influence on quality of life. Across studies,
inability to complete activities of daily living, wors-
ening behavior, caregiver burden, the number of co-
morbid medical conditions, and increasing severity of
disease were associated with higher costs.
One of the largest studies in the United States
examining dementia costs21 used a subsample of
856 patients from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS). This study reported a number of different
cost estimates, which varied based on how unpaid
care was valued and whether costs were adjusted for
coexisting conditions, to report annual direct costs of
$33,329 and annual indirect costs of $30,839 (total
annual costs: $64,168). Their estimate of costs
unadjusted for coexisting conditions with unpaid care
valued at the replacement cost (i.e., the cost of hiring
a paid home health worker) is comparable to our
findings. However, overall costs of dementia care esti-
mated from the HRS data were 53% lower than our
reported total costs for FTD, or a total of $119,653.
DISCUSSION FTD is associated with substantial
direct and indirect costs, diminished quality of life,
and increased caregiver burden. Most patients with
FTD are working age, and most patients have to leave
the labor force during their peak earning years. Care-
givers of patients with FTD may also need to alter
their careers to provide care. Combined, these factors
contribute to a substantial decrease in household
income. Previous studies have documented the heavy
burden imposed by FTD on caregivers and fami-
lies,28,29 but there has not been a study to date that
captured the economic burden of FTD in the US.
A clinic-based study from Singapore27 that exam-
ined differences in median annual costs between
young- and late-onset dementia reported young-
onset dementia costs almost twice those of late-
onset dementia in the clinic patient group ($15,815
vs $8,396). This same study found that FTD and
vascular dementia had higher costs than young-
onset AD. Another study in Argentina30 found
annual direct costs for FTD to be higher than for
AD, with at least part of that cost accounted for by
psychotropic medications. Most studies have reported
that resource use (institutional care, community care,
home services) was highly correlated with dependency
for activities of daily living and behavior. This is

 consistent with our finding that direct costs were
significantly higher in bvFTD compared with other
FTD subtypes.
Our study found that the economic burden for
FTD in the United States is approximately twice that
reported for AD.21 Given the age of the population
affected by AD, the authors did not estimate
productivity-related
costs.
When
productivity-
related costs are excluded and just direct costs and
informal care costs are considered, our estimate of
$69,000 per patient cost for FTD is similar to their
estimate of the $64,000 per patient cost of AD
dementia in the United States. However, because
many patients with FTD and their caregivers would
otherwise be in the labor force, the true per-patient
economic burden of FTD may be substantially higher
than for AD. It is worth noting that the reported AD
per-patient care costs vary widely (table 5) and may
reflect the impact that different methodologies have
on generating cost estimates.
Our study has limitations. Individuals with an
inherently positive view of research were more likely
to respond to an invitation to participate. Not all indi-
viduals who initiated the survey completed the survey,
but
we
found
no sociodemographic
differences
between completers and noncompleters. We relied

 on self-reported resource use data, which may be sub-
ject to inaccurate recall. To counter this, we used well-
accepted, validated instruments in dementia research
(e.g., RUI and HUI3). Our sample population was
caregivers rather than the patients themselves, and all
diagnoses are self-reported. To overcome this, we used
well-validated informant rating scales to assess presence
and stage of dementia, activities of daily living, behav-
ior, and HRQoL to characterize the patients. It is
worth noting that in a disease with no formal clinical
staging, caregivers’ assessment of stage of disease
strongly correlated across all validated staging, func-
tional, and behavioral instruments. Finally, this study
was cross-sectional and is unable to estimate longitu-
dinal costs associated with disease progression.
Our finding of an increased economic burden for
FTD compared to what is reported for AD may still
underestimate true costs. Our cost estimates were
based on items for which we could assign a unit cost
to the item without making speculative assumptions
and reasonably attribute the cost to FTD vs other ill-
nesses. Therefore, while we measured caregiver’s use
of medical services, we did not assign a monetary
value and could not determine what share of care is
attributable to the unique burden of FTD caregiving
without undertaking additional analyses.29
Although the absolute number of patients with
FTD is lower than the number with AD, the eco-
nomic burden of FTD is substantial. One of the
key factors to this burden may be the earlier age at
onset, typically occurring during patients’ or care-
givers’ peak earning years. A better understanding
of the substantial socioeconomic burden of FTD will
provide the needed evidence base to help inform
healthcare policy,31 to drive research agendas, and to
enhance targeted allocation of resources that will lead
to timely and accurate diagnosis and effective treat-
ments where none now exists.
