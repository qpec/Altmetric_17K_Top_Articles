Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety,
but their efficacy relative to placebo has been questioned. We aimed to test how manipulation of verbally
induced expectancies, central for placebo, influences SSRI treatment outcome and brain activity in patients
with social anxiety disorder (SAD).
Methods: We did a randomized clinical trial, within an academic medical center (Uppsala, Sweden), of individuals
fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for SAD, recruited through media advertising. Participants were 18 years or older
and randomized in blocks, through a computer-generated sequence by an independent party, to nine weeks of
overt or covert treatment with escitalopram (20 mg daily). The overt group received correct treatment informa-
tion whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with the SSRI described, by the psychiatrist, as active pla-
cebo. The treating psychiatrist was necessarily unmasked while the research staff was masked from intervention
assignment. Treatment efficacy was assessed primarily with the self-rated Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-
SR), administered at week 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9, also yielding a dichotomous estimate of responder status (clinically
significant improvement). Before and at the last week of treatment, brain activity during an emotional face-
matching task was assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and during fMRI sessions,
anticipatory speech anxiety was also assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State version
(STAI-S). Analyses included all randomized patients with outcome data at posttreatment. This study is registered
at ISRCTN, number 98890605.
Findings: Between March 17th 2014 and May 22nd 2015, 47 patients were recruited. One patient in the covert
group dropped out after a few days of treatment and did not provide fMRI data, leaving 46 patients with complete
outcome data. After nine weeks of treatment, overt (n = 24) as compared to covert (n = 22) SSRI administration
yielded significantly better outcome on the LSAS-SR (adjusted difference 21.17, 95% CI 10.69–31.65, p b 0.0001)
with more than three times higher response rate (50% vs. 14%; χ2(1) = 6.91, p = 0.009) and twice the effect size
(d = 2.24 vs. d = 1.13) from pre-to posttreatment. There was no significant between-group difference on antic-
ipatory speech anxiety (STAI-S), both groups improving with treatment. No serious adverse reactions were re-
corded. On fMRI outcomes, there was suggestive evidence for a differential neural response to treatment
between groups in the posterior cingulate, superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri (all z thresholds exceeding
3.68, p ≤ 0.001). Reduced social anxiety with treatment correlated significantly with enhanced posterior cingu-
late (z threshold 3.24, p = 0.0006) and attenuated amygdala (z threshold 2.70, p = 0.003) activity.
Interpretation: The clinical and neural effects of escitalopram were markedly influenced by verbal suggestions.
This points to a pronounced placebo component in SSRI-treatment of SAD and favors a biopsychosocial over a
biomedical explanatory model for SSRI efficacy.

1. Introduction
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the most
commonly prescribed psychotropic medications but the clinical signifi-
cance of this class of drugs has been widely debated in the field of de-
pression (Bschor and Kilarski, 2016; Khan and Brown, 2015) and
anxiety (Roest et al., 2015; Sugarman et al., 2014). In depression, this
debate has been fueled by meta-analytic studies failing to demonstrate
a clinically meaningful advantage of SSRIs over placebo (Kirsch et al.,
2002) although superior SSRI (Nplacebo) effects have been noted, e.g.
in severely depressed patients (Bschor and Kilarski, 2016; Khan and
Brown, 2015) and when limiting statistical analyses to depressed
mood as a single-item measure (Hieronymus et al., 2015). It has even
been argued that improvement attributed to antidepressants in dou-
ble-blind trials could reflect an enhanced placebo response, i.e., benefi-
cial outcome unrelated to the specific/active properties of the treatment
itself, due to treatment expectations induced by perceived side effects
(Moncrieff et al., 2004). Indeed, previous research in anxiety (Colloca
et al., 2004), depression (Chen et al., 2011; Rutherford et al., 2016)
and pain (Bingel et al., 2011; Colloca et al., 2004) supports that the pa-
tients' expectancies and beliefs can have a profound influence on thera-
peutic outcomes. However, with regard to the SSRI vs. placebo minimal
difference debate, conclusions have been based mostly on meta-analytic
(Kirsch et al., 2002) and correlational studies (Chen et al., 2011), ham-
pering causal inference.
Here, we tested how verbally induced expectancies, a crucial placebo
mechanism, influence SSRI efficacy in patients with social anxiety
disorder (SAD). Treatment studies of SAD have noted response
rates of about 50–60% for SSRIs like escitalopram and 40% for placebo
(Baldwin et al., 2016). In a previous neuroimaging trial of SAD we
found striking similarities between SSRI and placebo responders
both regarding clinical effects and altered anxiety-related brain ac-
tivity (Faria et al., 2012, 2014). However, previous studies could
not fully infer about the influence of expectancies on SSRI treatment
outcome because expectancies have not been measured and experi-
mentally manipulated. Thus, in the present study, we experimentally
addressed the question raised by meta-analytic studies i.e., to what ex-
tent the clinical effects of SSRIs can be manipulated by verbal sugges-
tions. Patients with SAD were treated with equivalent doses of
escitalopram (20 mg daily) for 9 weeks, but only one group was correct-
ly informed about the treatment received and its effectiveness. By use of
a credible cover story, the other group was led to believe that they were
treated with an “active placebo” (neurokinin-1 antagonist) that lacked
specific anxiolytic properties, but was expected to induce side effects
similar to the SSRI.
Thus, the aim was to assess the clinical efficacy of escitalopram with
and without expectations of improvement, i.e. overt vs. covert SSRI
treatment. To evaluate effects also on objective brain parameters, neural
reactivity to a disorder-relevant emotional face-matching task (Hariri et
al., 2002; Gingnell et al., 2016) was assessed before and at the last week
of treatment with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based
on reports of a strong placebo effect in SAD treatment (Baldwin et al.,
2016; Faria et al., 2012, 2014) and the association between SAD symp-
toms and amygdala reactivity (Faria et al., 2012, 2014; Furmark et al.,
2008; Gingnell et al., 2016), we expected larger clinical improvement
and greater attenuation of amygdala responsivity in the overt as com-
pared to covert SSRI group.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
This was an investigator-initiated, randomized, clinical trial on
escitalopram with manipulation of verbal instructions i.e., expectancies,
conducted in an academic medical centre (Uppsala, Sweden). Patients
with SAD were randomized into two treatment arms but all received
equal doses of 20 mg escitalopram per day for nine weeks (10 mg the
first week). However, whereas patients in the overt treatment arm
were correctly informed about the treatment received, patients in the
covert arm were deceived with a cover story (see procedure, expectan-
cy manipulation).
The Regional Ethical Review Board, Uppsala and the Medical Prod-
ucts Agency in Sweden approved the study which complied with the
standards established by the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants
were provided with verbal and written instructions about the study
procedure and objectives, comparing escitalopram and “active placebo”.
The stated purpose of evaluating active placebo was to acquire knowl-
edge about its neural effects, for later use as an improved control treat-
ment in clinical trials. All participants gave written informed consent
prior to inclusion. Participants in the covert group were debriefed by
the study psychiatrist at unblinding. For ethical reasons, all participants
were also offered an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
program (Andersson et al., 2006) for free after initial treatment.
Participants (aged 18 years and older) were recruited through news-
paper advertisements and public billboards. During the initial screening,
the Social Phobia Screening Questionnaire (SPSQ) (Furmark et al., 1999)
and the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S)
(Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) were administered online. Partici-
pants passing initial screening were interviewed using the Mini Interna-
tional Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998), the
SAD section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)
(First et al., 1997), and underwent a medical check-up. All participants
had to meet the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
criteria for SAD as the primary diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were: con-
traindications for MR, age b 18 or N65 years, presence of severe somatic
disease or serious psychiatric disorder such as psychosis or severe major
depression, treatment for any psychiatric disorder (ongoing or termi-
nated within three months), pregnancy, menopause, and drug or alco-
hol abuse/dependency.
2.2. Randomization and Masking
Randomization, stratified by sex and age, was determined by a com-
puterized random-number generator in blocks of two by an indepen-
dent third party (APL, Stockholm, Sweden). The treating psychiatrist
of the study (K.W.) assigned participants to the trial, after baseline mea-
surements and consent, and allocation to intervention was implement-
ed by use of a numbered list. Randomization codes were kept secret, in a
sealed opaque envelope, at the psychiatrist's clinic until study comple-
tion. APL, Stockholm, Sweden, prepared standard escitalopram tablets
for the overt group, and unmarked capsules for the covert group, both
containing escitalopram 20 mg (Cipralex, H. Lundbeck AB, Helsingborg,
Sweden) which were placed in containers marked with “Active placebo/
Escitalopram 20 mg” (10 mg first week). Due to the nature of the inves-
tigation, the treating psychiatrist (K.W.) was not blinded while the
180
V. Faria et al. / EBioMedicine 24 (2017) 179–188
 research staff was blinded to the intervention allocation after
randomization.
To minimize experimenter influence, the primary outcome measure
i.e., the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale self-rate version (LSAS-SR)
(Fresco et al., 2001) with automated scoring, was filled out online at
home and participants were instructed not to reveal their allocated
treatment to assessors. After the final assessments, before unblinding,
all personnel in the study completed a short written questionnaire
with the following (yes/no) questions: 1. During the study, did you
know treatment allocation for any of the participants? (If yes, for how
many?); 2. Did any of the participants disclose information of any
type that revealed their allocated treatment to you? According to the
questionnaire, none of the personnel in the trial, beside the non-blinded
psychiatrist (K.W.), reported knowledge about group allocation for any
participant.
2.3. General Procedure
After initial screening, baseline measurements and consent, two
fMRI scanning sessions with an emotional face-matching task were
scheduled for each participant, one before and one at the end, during
the last week, of treatment. At the end of each fMRI-session, participants
were exposed to a public speaking behavioral test in which they gave a
two minute speech on a freely chosen topic in front of a silent audience
(5–8 persons) – see Gingnell et al., 2016. Anticipatory anxiety was
assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State ver-
sion (STAI-S) (Spielberger et al., 1970) before the speech. All partici-
pants were informed, prior to signing the informed consent, that they
were requested to hold a speech after each fMRI-session. Before and
during week 1, 3, 6, and 9 of treatment, participants filled out the prima-
ry outcome LSAS-SR (Fresco et al., 2001) online at home.
After the posttreatment fMRI scanning session, participants revisited
the psychiatrist for a complementary clinical evaluation. Approximately
6 months after this visit, the participants in the covert group were
contacted again by the psychiatrist and the cover story was revealed
(see Supplement). After treatment, and at unblinding, participants
were offered further contact with the psychiatrist at own cost and ac-
cess to a free internet CBT program (Andersson et al., 2006). Efficacy
of the internet CBT program offered to all participants after initial treat-
ment was not assessed due to low numbers of completers.
2.4. Expectancy Manipulation
After the first fMRI session, an experienced psychiatrist (K.W.)
assessed additional baseline clinical symptom severity (see Supple-
ment), and the participants were handed their supply of daily
escitalopram 20 mg (10 mg first week) with separate verbal instruc-
tions for the overt and covert arm. The overt group was correctly in-
formed about the SSRI treatment and the expected improvement,
whereas the covert group were told that they would receive the active
placebo, i.e. a non-functioning neurokinin-1 antagonist (GW597599)
likely to induce side effects similar to escitalopram but out of which
no symptom-improvement could be expected (see the Supplementary
appendix for the full written and verbal information to participants).
Participants revisited the psychiatrist's clinic after one week and were
then handed their supply of the medication for the remainder of the
study period. Compliance was assessed by serum drug concentrations
at the posttreatment fMRI.
2.5. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MR imaging was performed using a Philips Achieva 3.0 T whole body
MR-scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) equipped
with an 8-channel head-coil. Five of the participants (three in the overt
and two in the covert group) were scanned after an upgrade of the scan-
ner software and for those participants a 32-channel head coil was used.
Participants were positioned supine in the scanner. An anatomical T1-
weighted image (echo time(TE) = 15 ms; repetition time (TR) =
5700 ms; inversion time = 400 ms; field of view = 230 × 230 mm2;
voxel size = 0.8 × 1.0 × 2.0 mm3; 60 contiguous slices) and a
blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) echo planar imaging (EPI)
sequence (TE = 35 ms; TR = 3000 ms; flip angle = 90°, acquisition ma-
trix = 76 × 77, voxel size = 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm3, gap = 1 mm, 30 axial
slices) was acquired. Visual stimuli were presented through goggles (Vi-
sual System, NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) using E-prime (Psychol-
ogy Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA, USA).
2.6. fMRI Paradigm
The paradigm included matching of fearful or angry facial expres-
sions and geometrical shapes (Hariri et al., 2002). In each trial, a target
face or shape was displayed at the top of the screen and, by pressing a
button with their left or right index finger, the participants indicated
which one of two lower images displayed the same emotion or shape
as the target (see Supplement, Fig. S1). Face and shape trials were pre-
sented in blocks of 6, in which images were presented for 4 s,
interspaced with a fixation cross (2s for shape trials and a random dura-
tion of 2, 4, or 6s for face trials). The expressed emotion or shape of the
target varied from trial to trial, and each face block had an equal mix of
emotions as well as sex of the faces. Accuracy and reaction times were
recorded but there were no significant group differences on these mea-
sures. The fMRI session included four additional scans not reported in
the present study.
2.7. Primary Outcome Measures
The main clinical outcome measure was the continuous LSAS-SR
(Fresco et al., 2001) (assessed online 5 times), which was also used to
determine response status according to the criteria for clinically signifi-
cant improvement (Jacobson and Truax, 1991). Responders exhibited a
reliable change index N 1.96 and a posttreatment total score b 39, falling
within 2 SD from the mean of the normal population (Fresco et al.,
2001). Further, anticipatory speech anxiety was assessed after each
fMRI-session with the STAI-S (Spielberger et al., 1970), after three mi-
nutes of preparation.
2.8. Secondary Outcome Measures
Before and after the full treatment period, five secondary outcome
measures were also administered online: the Social Interaction Anxiety
Scale (SIAS) (Mattick and Clarke, 1998), Social Phobia Scale (SPS)
(Mattick and Clarke, 1998), MADRS-S (Montgomery and Asberg,
1979), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck et al., 1988), and the Quality
of Life Inventory (QOLI) (Frisch et al., 1992).
2.9. Credibility Ratings
Before the first fMRI-session and after nine weeks of treatment, par-
ticipants rated their treatment beliefs both about escitalopram and “ac-
tive placebo”. Questions, asked before the first scanning session, i.e.,
prior to randomization, included how logical the treatment seemed;
how sure the patients were that they would be improved in symptom-
atology by the treatment; how strongly they would recommend the
treatment to a friend in a similar situation; how they thought that the
treatment would affect other types of anxiety disorders; how much im-
provement they would expect themselves if given the described treat-
ment. All questions were rated between 0 and 10, 0 indicating “not at
all” and 10 “very much”. The results of these questions were used to cre-
ate a summed credibility score (0–50) for each treatment.
At posttreatment, participants answered two questions regarding
the perceived value of having been part of the study, one open and
one with fixed rating steps (1 = not valuable, 2 = slightly valuable or
181
V. Faria et al. / EBioMedicine 24 (2017) 179–188
 neutral, 3 = rather valuable, 4 = very valuable). They were also asked
how sure they were that the treatment they had been assigned to was
effective for SAD and how strongly they would recommend the treat-
ment to a friend with similar symptoms, both rated between 0 and 10,
0 indicating “not at all” and 10 “very much”. In addition to this they
responded to an open question whether their view of the effectiveness
of the treatment they had received had changed during the study period
(recoded into 1 = more negative, 2 = slightly more negative, 3 = none,
4 = slightly more positive, 5 = more positive).
Credibility/expectancy assessments were not performed continu-
ously during treatment to avoid causing suspicion regarding the cover
story. Participants in the covert group were also asked to rate their be-
liefs at the follow-up psychiatric appointment when the cover story
was revealed (see the Supplement). Ratings were not available from 4
individuals.
2.10. fMRI Outcome
Estimates of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) reactivity was
obtained for each participant and session, by contrasting emotional
faces against geometrical shapes. Change in this reactivity with treat-
ment was then calculated for each participant and compared across
groups (see below).
2.11. Power Calculations
Assessing the effect of verbally-induced expectations on SSRI-treat-
ment is a novel approach but power calculations based on previous pla-
cebo controlled SSRI trials (Faria et al., 2012, 2014; Gingnell et al., 2016)
assumed a difference between treatment arms in mean ± SD LSAS-
scores of 11.4 ± 11.7. Given α = 0.05 and n = 24 per group, the
study had 80% power to detect a difference between treatments.
2.12. Analyses of Behavioral Data
Demographic and pretreatment clinical data were compared be-
tween groups by t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests or Chi-square tests
using IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Clinical treatment effects were evaluated
using repeated measure MANOVA/ANOVA with t-test for follow-up
analyses. For 3 (1%) missing LSAS-SR scores (n = 1 week3, n =
2 week 6) the last observation was carried forward. The standardized
mean difference (Cohen's d pre-post) was also calculated for each
group. For behavioral and demographic analyses, a p-value of b0.05
was considered significant. Statistical analyses were based on partici-
pants with complete outcome data, thereby excluding one early drop-
out (male) in the covert group. A data monitoring delegate oversaw
the study.
2.13. Analyses of Imaging Data
The fMRI-data were analysed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA) using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8).
Each participant's BOLD EPI images were realigned to the mean image
of each session, slice timing corrected to the middle slice of each vol-
ume, co-registered with the anatomical scan and normalized to Montre-
al Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space using parameters
obtained from unified segmentation of the anatomical image. Finally,
smoothing was performed using an 8 mm Gaussian kernel (full width,
half maximum). The BOLD signal in each voxel was high-pass filtered
with 128 s, regressed on the stimulus function (boxcar, onsets and du-
rations of face- and shape-stimuli), six movement parameters obtained
from the realignment step, and convolved with the canonical hemody-
namic response function provided by SPM.
Individual difference images, representing changes in BOLD reactiv-
ity (emotional faces vs. shapes), were calculated by subtracting the
pretreatment from the posttreatment contrast map, and used in second
level group comparisons.
Between-groups t-tests were used to analyse the neural reactivity-
changes with treatment. Comparisons in the automated anatomical la-
beling library (aal) region of interest (ROI) for bilateral amygdala were
assessed at p b 0.05 FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons. In addi-
tion to this, we used an exploratory whole brain approach with p b
0.001 and a cluster extent of ≥10 voxels. Follow-up analyses of associa-
tions between symptom improvement and altered BOLD reactivity in
the amygdala and the observed clusters from the exploratory whole
brain analysis, were assessed in the whole sample by including LSAS-
SR change scores in regression analyses at p b 0.05. Follow-up analyses
were also performed to assess group differences using psychophysio-
logical interaction (PPI) analyses of amygdala connectivity with time-
series fMRI data extracted from obtained peak voxels entered as a re-
gressor together with task (faces vs. shapes) and the interaction be-
tween the two. For all fMRI-analyses time point of scanning (before/
after upgrade) was used as a covariate. Spatial localizations are reported
in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates.
3. Results
3.1. Participants
Between March 17, 2014, and May 22nd 2015, a total of 47 patients
with SAD (mean ± SD age 31.8 ± 10.2 years; 18 women) were recruit-
ed and randomly assigned either to overt (n = 24) or covert (n = 23)
SSRI treatment. One male participant assigned to the covert group did
not provide fMRI-data and dropped out of treatment after a few days,
limiting the statistical evaluation to 46 patients with complete outcome
data. See Fig. 1 for the-trial profile and Table 1 for descriptive
characteristics.
3.2. Pretreatment Evaluation
There were no significant differences between the overt and covert
SSRI group before treatment on baseline demographics, disease charac-
teristics (Table 1), or on any primary or secondary outcome measure
(Table 2). Before randomization, significantly higher (t(42) = 6.58, p
b 0.0001) credibility ratings were given for SSRI treatment (M ± SD
29.77 ± 7.07) compared with “active placebo” according to the cover
story (M ± SD 19.53 ± 9.29), see Fig. 2 (top left). The overt and covert
groups did not differ in their initial (pre-randomization) ratings of the
two treatments (p N 0.38).
3.3. Primary Clinical Outcomes
Online assessments of LSAS-SR, yielded a significant Group × Time
interaction (F(4,176) = 9.16, p b 0.0001, ƞ2 = 0.17) in the repeated
measures ANOVA, supporting larger improvement in the overt as com-
pared to the covert SSRI arm, with a significant between-group differ-
ence emerging at week 3 (t(44) = 2.23, p = 0.03) – see Fig. 2 (lower
panel). Accordingly, after treatment there were significantly more re-
sponders, i.e. individuals meeting the criteria for clinically significant
improvement on the LSAS-SR, in the overt (12/24, 50%) than in the co-
vert (3/22, 14%) SSRI arm (χ2(1) = 6.91, p = 0.009), Fig. 2 (top right).
For LSAS-SR, the (pre-post) effect size was d = 2.24 in the overt vs. d
= 1.13 in the covert group. Anticipatory speech anxiety (STAI-S) ratings
before the behavioral test did not change differently (pre-post) in the
two groups, both improving with treatment (Table 2).
3.4. Secondary Clinical Outcomes
With regard to secondary clinical measures, both groups improved
significantly from pre- to posttreatment on all measures with the excep-
tion of quality of life in the covert arm (Table 2). There was a significant
182
V. Faria et al. / EBioMedicine 24 (2017) 179–188
 Group × Time interaction indicating better treatment outcome in the
overt as compared to covert SSRI arm on measures of social interaction
anxiety, depression and quality of life (Table 2). Repeated measures
MANOVA of all primary and secondary measures indicated a significant
Group × Time (pre/post) interaction (Wilk's λ = 0.62, F(7,38) = 3.30,
p = 0.008, ƞ2 = 0.38) in favor of overt SSRI.
3.5. Treatment Satisfaction
After nine weeks of treatment, participants in both groups were
equally content with having participated in the study (M ± SD: overt
= 3.33 ± 0.82; covert = 2.96 ± 0.70; U = 205, p = 0.09), but partici-
pants in the overt group were more likely to believe that their received
treatment was good for SAD (M ± SD: overt = 6.96 ± 2.71; covert =
5.22 ± 2.87; U = 161, p = 0.01), more likely to recommend their
treatment to a friend (M ± SD: overt = 7.25 ± 2.83; covert = 5.27
± 3.38; U = 170, p = 0.04), and more prone to report a change towards
a more positive attitude to their treatment during the course of the
study (M ± SD: overt = 3.67 ± 1.09; covert = 3.09 ± 0.75; U = 183,
p = 0.03) in comparison to the covert group.
3.6. Blood Serum Analyses
Blood serum analyses of escitalopram concentrations at the post-
treatment fMRI indicated that all patients had taken their medication
as
intended
(median
[25th–75th
percentile]
74.0
[48.75–
119.75] nmol/l). At posttreatment, there were no significant differences
between the overt vs. covert SSRI arm with regard to concentrations of
escitalopram (t(44) = 1.62, p = 0.11), desmethylescitalopram (t(44)
= 0.50, p = 0.62) or didesmethylescitalopram (t(44) = 0.27, p = 0.79).

 3.7. Adverse Events
The total number of recordered adverse events did not differ be-
tween the groups (t(44) = 1.40, p = 0.17), while there was a tendency
(t(44) = 1.90, p = 0.06) for more adverse events that were deemed to
be drug related in the overt (M ± SD 3.39 ± 2.62) as compared to the
covert (2.22 ± 1.38) SSRI group. The most common adverse events
were nausea, tiredness, headache, sleep- and sex-related problems.
Events were generally mild to moderate, usually transient, and all
were resolved at posttreatment.
3.8. Additional Measures
See the Supplement regarding participants' reactions to the reveal of
the cover story, the psychiatrist's complementary evaluation, and com-
parisons of covert SSRI treatment with waiting-list and CBT data.
3.9. fMRI: Overt vs. Covert SSRI Administration
Amygdala ROI analysis did not yield significant between-group re-
sults while an exploratory whole-brain analysis indicated a differential
neural treatment response with relatively increased (pre to post) reac-
tivity to the emotional faces in the overt SSRI arm, and decreased reac-
tivity in the covert group, in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, left
mid temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus (Table 3, Fig. 3). There
were no significant group differences in the above regions before
treatment.
3.10. Brain-behavior Correlations
Follow-up analysis revealed that decreased social anxiety, as mea-
sured with LSAS-SR from pre- to posttreatment, was associated with re-
duced activation of the right amygdala (x = 33, y = −1, z = −29; Z =
2.70, k = 972 mm3, p = 0.003 - see Fig. 4, top panel) and increased ac-
tivation of the posterior cingulate/precuneus region (x = −18, y =
−31, z = 34, Z = 3.24, k = 216 mm3, p = 0.0006; x = 12, y = −46,
z = 16, Z = 3.10, k = 2133 mm3, p = 0.001; x = −30, y = −58, z
= 28, Z = 2.85, k = 486 mm3; p = 0.002 - see Fig. 4, lower panel).
3.11. Psychophysiological Interaction Analysis
Based on the correlation between change in amygdala reactivity and
symptom improvement (LSAS-SR) with treatment, psychophysiological
interaction (PPI) follow-up analysis of group differences in amygdala
connectivity was conducted with time-series fMRI data extracted from
the obtained peak voxel (33, −1, −29) entered as a regressor together
with task (faces vs. shapes) and the interaction between the two. The
covert as compared to overt group, exhibited increased connectivity
after treatment between the amygdala and right dorsal posterior cingu-
late cortex (x = 21, y = −49, z = 40; Z = 3.62; 144 mm3, p b 0.00001)
and right insula (x = 45, y = −22, z = 25; Z = 3.94; 144 mm3, p b
0.00001) – see Fig. 5.
4. Discussion

 to previous studies (e.g., Chen et al., 2011), we used a randomized de-
sign with truthful vs. deceiving instructions to estimate the contribution
of verbally induced expectancies to SSRI efficacy in SAD. Better clinical
outcome was noted in the overt as compared to the covert SSRI group
on the primary LSAS-SR measure, with a doubled (pre-post) effect
size, more than tripled response rate (50% vs 14%), greater treatment
satisfaction after 9 weeks, and superior improvement according to mul-
tivariate analysis of all primary and secondary outcome measures. Thus,
the instructions given while prescribing SSRIs make a significant clinical
difference. This is in accordance with previous literature showing that
administering a treatment covertly is not as efficient as an open admin-
istration (Colloca et al., 2004; Bingel et al., 2011). For post-operative
anxiety, covert administration of benzodiazepines has been reported
to be ineffective, and experimental studies in pain have also shown
that the needed doses to achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes are
much higher when drugs are administered covertly (Colloca et al.,
2004; Bingel et al., 2011). In fact, verbally-induced negative treatment
expectancies may even abolish opioid-induced analgesia (Bingel et al.,
2011).
In SAD, we have previously demonstrated highly similar changes in
brain activity and functional couplings for SSRI and placebo responders
(Faria et al., 2012, 2014), suggesting that expectancies of improvement
could play an important role in SSRI treatment. Here, we show that
overt administration of an SSRI is considerably more effective on the
LSAS-SR, in comparison to covert administration suggesting that the ef-
ficacy of SSRIs may be highly dependent on psychological effects like
positive expectancies, traditionally associated with placebo response.
However, the groups improved equally on anticipatory anxiety before
the public speaking challenge, and escitalopram administered covertly,
when compared to arms from a previous RCT, was superior to a waiting-
list condition and comparable to Internet-based CBT (see Supplement).
While this must be interpreted cautiously in the absence of randomized
comparisons, it is plausible that (covert) escitalopram possesses at least
moderate anxiolytic properties that need to be augmented with psycho-
socially induced expectancies to reach full clinical potential. Overall, our
results favor a biopsychosocial over a pure biomedical explanatory
model for SSRI efficacy in SAD.
The clinical effect was accompanied by a differential neural response
to treatment as measured with BOLD-fMRI during an emotional face-
matching task. Although we did not observe significantly altered amyg-
dala reactivity between groups, attenuated amygdala activity with
treatment correlated significantly with reduced social anxiety,

 consistent with our previous studies (Faria et al., 2012, 2014; Gingnell et
al., 2016). After covert as compared to overt SSRI administration, the
amygdala was more functionally coupled with other regions involved
in emotion processing, including the insula and dorsal posterior cingu-
late cortex. Consistently, experimental studies suggest that the coupling
between the amygdala and other nodes of the emotion processing

 network is stronger when fear memories are intact as compared to at-
tenuated following disrupted reconsolidation (Agren et al., 2012). The
most pronounced difference between groups in the present study was
observed in the posterior cingulate cortex (Table 3) and for the whole
sample, increased reactivity within this region correlated with reduced
social anxiety (Fig. 4). In depression, the posterior cingulate has been
shown to be more activated after treatment both in SSRI- and placebo
responders (Mayberg et al., 2002) and neuroplastic changes within
the
posterior
cingulate
have
been
reported
after
prolonged
escitalopram/citalopram intake in healthy volunteers (Kraus et al.,
2014). Together with the adjacent precuneus, the posterior cingulate
is a central node of the default mode network where altered neural ac-
tivity has been associated with learning, memory, reward, and task en-
gagement (Pearson et al., 2011). The posterior cingulate is also
consistently activated by emotional stimuli and suggested to be a region
in which cognition and emotion interact (Maddock, 1999). Thus, this
may be a brain area where cognitive expectancies exert their effect on
anxiety. However, elucidation of the mechanisms involved would re-
quire additional research e.g., with use of MRI-tasks that specifically ma-
nipulate expectancies together with mediation analyses.
There has been a sharp increase in neuroimaging studies of placebo
in recent years (Benedetti, 2014), but very few have used deception to
separate placebo from the drug effect or vice versa. Positron emission
tomography studies have noted large additional effects of drug (methyl-
phenidate) expectancy on brain glucose metabolism in cocaine abusers
(Volkow et al., 2003) and healthy volunteers (Volkow et al., 2006). Sim-
ilarly, fMRI trials of pain analgesia have demonstrated that expectancies,
when combined with active treatment, yield substantial additional re-
duction in reported pain concomitantly with neurofunctional changes
in pain processing brain regions (Bingel et al., 2011; Schenk et al.,
2014; however, see Atlas et al., 2012). But to our knowledge, the present
neuroimaging trial is the first deception-placebo study of SSRIs and of
prolonged treatment in patients.
Because the overt SSRI treatment yielded significantly higher initial
credibility ratings, none of the participants reported doubts about
the cover story, blood serum analyses showed equal compliance in
both groups, and a differential clinical effect was obtained, we conclude
that the verbal manipulation was successful and the study integrity well
maintained. Among the limitations it should be noted, however, that
the sample size was modest, imposing limits on statistical power.
Also, long-term follow-up assessments of relapse rates were not pos-
sible to conduct. Moreover, we could not evaluate a group treated
with placebo described as escitalopram and an overt placebo arm,
i.e. the remaining two cells of the balanced placebo design (Ross et
al., 1962). Thus, both drug and expectancies were not manipulated
in our study and therefore we could not properly test whether drug
and placebo effects are truly additive (Rutherford and Roose, 2013;
Atlas et al., 2012).
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the anxiolytic ef-
fect of escitalopram in SAD is highly sensitive to expectancies, as indi-
cated by behavioral and neuroimaging evidence. Our study shows that
verbal suggestions can have a profound influence on the anxiolytic ef-
fect of SSRIs. Thus, the presentation of a treatment may be as important
as the treatment itself.
