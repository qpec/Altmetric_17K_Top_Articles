 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia

Abstract 
Background 
To date, aphasia therapy guidelines recommend intensive speech and language therapy 
(SLT) for chronic post-stroke aphasia, but large-scale “class 1” randomised controlled 
trials (RCT) on treatment effectiveness are lacking. This multi-centre, parallel group, 
superiority, open blinded-endpoint RCT examined whether intensive SLT under 
routine clinical conditions improves verbal communication in daily life situations in 
chronic post-stroke aphasia, and whether treatment effects persist over a period of six 
months. 
Methods 
In 19 German in- or outpatient rehabilitation centres, patients aged ≤ 70 years with 
chronic post-stroke aphasia were randomly assigned to either ≥3 weeks of intensive 
SLT (intervention group; n=78, ≥10 h of SLT/week) or three weeks deferral of 
intensive SLT (control group; n=78). A computer-generated permuted block 
randomisation, stratified by treatment centre, was administered by an external 
biostatistician; consecutive inclusion codes were kept in sealed opaque envelopes. 
Primary endpoint was the change in verbal communication effectiveness in everyday 
life scenarios (blinded offline-evaluation of the Amsterdam Nijmegen Everyday 
Language Test/ANELT A-scale) from pre to post 3 weeks of intensive SLT compared to 
3 weeks deferral of intensive SLT. All analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat 
population (≥1 day of intensive SLT or waiting period). This study has been registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial identifier: NCT01540383, status: closed). 
Results  
One-hundred-fifty-eight patients were assigned between April 2012 and May 2014, 
with 156 patients being analysed (one dropout per group prior to intervention). Verbal 
communication significantly improved by 10 percent after intensive SLT (mean 
difference: 2·61 points+/- SD 4·94, 95% CI: 1·49 to 3·72), but not after the waiting 
period (mean difference: -0·03 points +/- SD 4·04; 95% CI: -0·94 to 0·88; group 
difference: Cohen’s d: 0·58). Group differences were not moderated by patient-, stroke-, 
or therapy-related factors.

Treatment effects remained stable for at least six months (if pooled across groups: d 
=0.45).  
Conclusions 
Three weeks of intensive SLT significantly enhanced verbal communication in chronic 
post-stroke aphasia, providing an effective evidence-based treatment approach in the 
middle-aged population. Future studies should examine the minimum SLT intensity 
required for significant treatment effects, and determine whether treatment effects 
cumulate over repeated intervention periods.

Research in context 
 
Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed and PsychInfo on June 28, 2016, for manuscripts published in 
English from inception until June 28, 2016, with the terms “stroke rehabilitation” 
combined with the terms “aphasia” or “outcome” or “evidence-based practice”, or 
"activities of daily living". We also searched the term “stroke” in combination with 
"incidence rates" or “health care costs“, respectively. We had no additional inclusion or 
exclusion criteria for the studies searched. 
 
For decades, it had been postulated that verbal communication improvements cannot 
be achieved in chronic post-stroke aphasia. Several RCTs have been conducted on the 
effectiveness of speech and language therapy (SLT) in this population, yet the reported 
results were inconclusive. Prior RCTs were hampered by methodological limitations: 
sample sizes were generally small (less than 20 patients per group), therapy 
administration was not intensive (i.e., <5 h/ week), and/or long-term therapy 
outcomes were not reported. Recently, however, meta-analyses and systematic reviews 
provided strong evidence that SLT, if administered with sufficient intensity  
(≥5 h/week), is effective even in the chronic stage post stroke. Despite this evidence 
derived from systematic reviews, patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia continue to 
be frequently denied access to SLT services. The main reason is the lack of at least one 
large-scale multi-centre RCT with sound statistics demonstrating lasting 
improvements of everyday language function after intensive SLT.  
 
Added value of this study 
To date, the multi-centre trial “From controlled experimental trial to=2 everyday 
communication/FCET2EC” represents the largest appropriately controlled prospective 
RCT on the effectiveness of intensive SLT compared to a no (or low intensity) SLT 
control condition in patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia. The findings provide 
statistically robust evidence for the superiority of 3-week intensive individualized SLT 
(10 h/week) compared to 3-week deferral of intensive SLT. Treatment effects remained 
stable across the follow-up period of six months. The study thus corroborates the 
results of prior underpowered studies suggesting a positive and lasting effect of 
intensive SLT. In contrast to previous studies in the field, which predominantly 
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia 
6
assessed performance in isolated linguistic functions with low ecological validity, the 
primary outcome of the FCET2EC trial addressed verbal communication in everyday 
life scenarios. 
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
In conjunction with the evidence derived from systematic reviews in the field, results 
of the FCET2EC trial justify the statistically sound conclusion that intensive SLT is an 
evidence-based intervention for chronic post-stroke aphasia. Compared to previous 
studies, inclusion criteria were liberal with respect to stroke etiology (ischaemic, 
hemorrhagic and subarachnoid hemorrhage), aphasia type, and aphasia severity, 
allowing the generalization of the trial’s results to the population of post-stroke 
aphasia patients aged ≤ 70 years. Furthermore, no participant dropped out of the 3-
week intensive individualized agreed-best clinical practice intervention which had 
been provided under routine clinical conditions. It is thus not required to further 
demonstrate the intervention’s feasibility for routine health care settings. The 
FCET2EC results may fundamentally change the allocation of rehabilitation resources 
for chronic post-stroke aphasia. 
 
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia

Introduction 
Persistent aphasia affects about 20% of all stroke patients (1). Being one of the most 
devastating symptoms in stroke survivors (2;3), aphasia predicts the degree of 
rehabilitation services required (4) and failure in returning to work (5). With 
increasing survival rates after the initial stroke (6), additional financial constraints are 
placed on health care providers, with aphasia contributing ~8·5% of stroke-related 
healthcare costs during the first year post stroke (7). 
 
Such dramatic consequences of post-stroke aphasia call for evidence-based effective 
interventions (8). Recent meta-analyses concluded that speech and language therapy 
(SLT) after stroke is effective even in the chronic stage, if administered with sufficient 
intensity (5-10 hours per week) (9-12). However, most of these studies rank below 
“level 2” according to the classification scheme of the Centre for Evidence-Based 
Medicine (http://www.cebm.net/ocebm-levels-of-evidence). The few high-quality 
studies had either small sample sizes, no untreated/low intensity control group (13-16), 
or low SLT intensity (<5 hours/week) (17-20). Thus, large multi-centre randomised 
controlled clinical trials (RCT) on the effectiveness of intensive aphasia therapy with 
reliable and valid outcome parameters are urgently required. 
 
The German multi-centre RCT “From controlled experimental trial to (=2) everyday 
communication” (FCET2EC) probed the effectiveness of ≥3 weeks of intensive agreed-
best-practice SLT in chronic (i.e. persisting for ≥6 months) post-stroke aphasia 
compared to three weeks deferral of SLT (control group). Specifically, this clinical trial 
assessed whether intensive (≥10 hours/week) best practice SLT translates into 
functional improvement of everyday verbal communication and better health-related 
quality of life up to six months post-intervention. We additionally examined the impact 
of patient-, stroke-, and therapy-related factors (see Suppl. Information) on the 
primary treatment effect.

Methods 
 
Trial design: 
The trial design (Figure 1) was published previously (21) (open access download link: 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3850954). The trial qualifies as a 
prospective randomised (equal randomisation to two arms), open, blinded endpoint 
(PROBE), multi-centre, stratified (according to centre), waiting-list controlled, 
parallel-group design to demonstrate the superiority of 3-week intensive SLT over 3-
week deferral of SLT (equal allocation ratio). SLT was provided in 19 German in- or 
outpatient rehabilitation sites specialised in stroke rehabilitation, treating a median of 
688 stroke patients per year (reference year: 2013). As a control, deferral of intensive 
SLT was considered most appropriate because any “active” control condition bears the 
risk of providing language stimulation (17). No major changes in methodology were 
required after the trial had started. 
 
The study coordination centre was based at the General Neurology Department of the 
University Hospital Muenster, Germany. Statistical analyses were performed by an 
external biometrician (P.M., University of Tuebingen, Germany). The Trial Steering 
Committee (TSC) - comprising six members (2 neurologists, 1 neurolinguist, 1 
neuropsychologist, 1 biostatistician, 1 patient delegate) - monitored study progress 
during the 26 months of patient recruitment. Except for the patient delegate, the TSC 
members are scientific experts on stroke and aphasia treatment in Germany (see also 
‘Contributors’). All members were independent of the principal investigators, their 
employing organisations, funders, and sponsors. There were no planned interim 
analyses; the TSC had no access to the data before final analyses were completed.  
 
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Lead Trial Physician 
(A.F.) at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany (primary vote; identifier: 
EA1/234/11), as well as by the ten review boards of the participating centres 
(secondary votes).

Participants: 
To reflect realistic routine healthcare conditions, inclusion criteria were liberal: 
persistent aphasia as confirmed by the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT) (22), lasting ≥6 
months after an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, age between 18-70 years, German 
acquired as first language, basic comprehension abilities and at least rudimentary 
attempts to verbally communicate (communication score >0 on the AAT spontaneous 
speech scale), and the ability to follow simple instructions (≥1 correct response on the 
first 10 items of the AAT Token Test). Exclusion criteria comprised severe untreated 
medical conditions and severe uncorrected vision or hearing impairments, aphasia 
owing to traumatic brain injury (TBI) or neurodegenerative disease, or participation in 
an alternative intensive intervention to relieve stroke symptoms during the 4 weeks 
prior to enrolment. Pre- and post-therapy data were collected at treatment sites or 
patients’ homes, whichever was more convenient for the patient. 
 
SLT was provided as part of routine clinical care, funded by the patients’ healthcare 
provider or retirement fund. All sites applied a uniform recruitment strategy. After 
routine referral to a given centre, potential study participants were contacted by phone 
by a centre representative. Sites carried log files documenting each eligible patient 
referred to the centre and, if applicable, reasons for not including the patient. After 
study termination, all log files were made available to the central study office. Reasons 
for non-inclusion of patients have been comprehensively listed in Figure 1. Every 
patient, and if required his or her legal representative, gave written informed consent 
before trial participation. 
 
Randomisation and masking 
Randomisation (computer-generated blockwise random sequence stratified by centre; 
consecutive inclusion codes for each centre kept in sealed opaque envelopes) and 
group allocation to either the immediate SLT group (I-SLT-G) or the waiting-list 
control group (WL-CG) were carried out by the trial biometrician P.M.. Group 
allocation for a given patient ID was faxed to the study coordination centre for 
implementation. The personnel in the study coordination centre had to be aware of the 
patients’ group allocations to schedule the assessments accordingly, but was not 
involved in the assessments or the SLT intervention.

10 
Pre- and post-therapy assessments were administered by 40 external study assessors 
(all professional SL therapists) not otherwise involved in the study. All assessors were 
extensively trained in administration and scoring of the outcome measures and closely 
supervised by the trial-coordinator and the personnel of the study coordination centre 
during data acquisition. Patients and study assessors could not be masked with respect 
to group allocation because patients in the WL-CG had one additional baseline 
assessment (i.e., prior to and after their 3-week waiting period; see below) compared to 
the I-SLT-G. However, offline evaluation of the primary outcome measure (ANELT) 
was carried out by an independent endpoint committee of eight raters trained for this 
purpose and blinded with respect to group assignment and assessment (pre vs. post) 
by random labelling of the respective audio files (using the names of the planets of our 
galaxy). Data blinding was carried out in the study coordination centre. 
 
For quality assurance, each data set was independently monitored in the study 
coordination centre by two research assistants not otherwise involved in the trial and 
blinded to group allocation; 100% of primary outcome and 30% of secondary outcome 
data were additionally checked by an external monitor.  
 
Procedures:  
Prior to the first patient enrolment, participating therapists were thoroughly trained in 
using the study SLT manual (Supplemental Information for details) and the 
monitoring/documentation forms, and were closely supervised by the authors of the 
manual (a subgroup of the study authors). The intervention was based on best-practice 
guidelines (Supplemental Information), combining linguistic and communicative-
pragmatic approaches individualized to the baseline profile of each patient. SLT was 
provided for ≥3 weeks with ≥10 hours/week and was offered by professional therapists 
in one-to-one and group therapy sessions, plus ≥5 hours/week self-managed PC-
training targeting individual linguistic deficits. Selection of initial individual SLT 
targets was based on the patients’ baseline linguistic and communicative-pragmatic 
performance (Supplemental Information). Daily SLT duration and contents were 
documented by the centres. 
 
The WL-CG received an identical intensive SLT starting immediately after the 3-week 
waiting period. Because of the health care embedding of the trial, patients in the WL-
CG could continue conventional low intensity SLT in private practice during their 3-
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia 
11
week waiting period (on average 1·5 hours/week, see Suppl. Table 1). Total 
rehabilitation duration depended on a patient’s individual healthcare plan, but 
comprised ≥3 weeks for all cases In Germany, most health care insurances currently 
limit aphasia rehabilitation to a period of three weeks. Our study design was adapted 
accordingly (critical treatment period: weeks 1-3). The decision to extend the 
rehabilitation period beyond three weeks is made by the health care funder, not by the 
therapist.  
 
Patients could continue SLT during the follow-up period of six months, and the 
majority of patients did so at a level of 1·2 hrs/week (see Suppl. Table 1).  
 
Demographic, cognitive, speech, language, and clinical (based on medical records) 
characteristics were assessed in an initial screening session (Supplemental 
Information for details). Primary and secondary outcome assessments were carried out 
within three working days (a) prior to and after the 3-week intensive SLT for the I-
SLTG and (b) prior to and after the 3-week waiting period for the WL-CG. Additionally, 
the WL-CG was tested after the ensuing 3-week SLT. Both groups were reassessed six 
months [+/- 10 days] after termination of the 3-week intensive SLT period.  
 
A subgroup of 34 patients (pooled across groups) was granted ≥5 weeks of intensive 
SLT by their respective health care providers. Outcome measures were additionally 
assessed within three working days after the entire (5-8 weeks) intensive SLT period 
for this subsample. 
 
Outcome measures  
The centrally assessed primary outcome measure was verbal communication 
effectiveness in ten everyday life situations employing the two parallel versions of the 
Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT) A-scale (23). Versions I and 
II were counterbalanced across subsequent assessments of a given patient; 53% of the 
patients received version I first, for the remaining patients version II was used. ANELT 
assessments were audio-recorded for blinded off-line evaluation (see section on 
“masking”). All ANELT sessions of a given patient were rated by two of the eight raters 
(coupling of rater pairs across patients by a PC random algorithm, with the constraint 
that the eight raters evaluated comparable amounts of data sets). The interrater 
agreement of all eight raters was highly satisfactory (Krippendorff’s alpha = 0·81). 
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia 
12
Each of the 10 ANELT scenarios of a given version was scored for its degree of verbal 
effectiveness (A-scale), ranging from score 1 = “no relation to communicative scenario 
at all” to score 5 = “all information required for successful communication has been 
provided”. For a given patient, the mean score of the two raters for each of the ANELT 
scenarios was computed. Mean scores for all 10 scenarios were then summarized into a 
total ANELT score (minimum score: 10, maximum score: 50). Primary endpoint was 
the ANELT change immediately post the 3 week intervention; long-term stability of the 
treatment effects over a 6-month period was analysed as secondary endpoint.  
 
The following secondary outcome measures were centrally assessed: 
 stroke severity [modified Rankin Scale (mRS)] (24);  
 auditory intelligibility in everyday communication (ANELT B-scale) (23);  
 impairment-specific language measures (Sprachsystematisches 
APhasieScreening/SAPS) (see Suppl. Information for details) assessing 
comprehension and production abilities in the core language domains of 
phonology, lexicon, and syntax;  
 a standardized questionnaire assessing quality of life as viewed by the patient 
[Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39 (SAQOL-39) (25)]; 
 communication ratings by a significant other [Communicative Effectiveness 
Index (CETI) (26), assessed at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up; 
 transfer to other cognitive functions [nonverbal learning: Nonverbal Learning 
Test (NVLT) (27)]; visual attention/executive functioning: Trail Making Test 
(TMT), versions A and B (28). 
 
The study coordination centre had to be informed of adverse events (AEs) by the 
centres within 24 h of first occurrence. Unexpected or serious AEs had to be reported 
to the TSC which had the authority to halt recruitment or to cease the trial.  
 
 
Statistical analysis 
A priori sample size calculation to detect a significant increase on the primary outcome 
measure (19) from before to after the 3-week intensive SLT with a statistical power of 
0·90, an estimated effect size of 0·71, and a two-sided alpha significance level of 0·05 
yielded a sample size of n=63 patients/group. Anticipating a drop-out rate of 25 
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia 
13
percent, we planned to enrol n=84 patients per group during a 26-month recruitment 
phase.  
 
The analyses of primary and secondary endpoints were performed in the intention-to-
treat (ITT) population, consisting of all randomised patients who received ≥1 day of 
therapy or were ≥1 day on the waiting list. Additional analyses performed in the 
treated per protocol (PP) population (I-SLT-G: n=64, WL-CG: n=72) yielded the same 
pattern of results and are not further reported here. Data of all 156 patients were 
complete for the primary analysis, not requiring data imputation. For normally 
distributed data parametrical methods were used. In case of non-normally distributed 
data, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for group comparisons, and the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test for pairwise intra-subject comparisons.  
 
The primary analysis was based on an ANCOVA model with the ANELT A-scale score 
after the 3-week SLT or 3-week waiting period as dependent variable, treatment group 
(I-SLT-G, WL-CG) as independent variable, and baseline ANELT A-scale score as 
covariate. To assess possible moderator effects, interactions of treatment group with 
demographic, clinical, cognitive, and linguistic variables (Suppl. Information) were 
also analyzed. To assess demographic, cognitive, stroke- or aphasia-related predictors 
of the immediate treatment success (Suppl. Information), therapy effects of both 
treatment groups were pooled. The secondary outcomes were evaluated with the same 
statistical approach. No adjustment for multiple testing was applied to secondary 
analyses. Thus, analyses were not strictly confirmatory with the exception of the 
analysis for the primary endpoint. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 22.

Results 
 
Patient recruitment 
During the recruitment period (April 1, 2012 to May 31, 2014), 158 patients were 
randomly assigned to the two groups (n=79 each; see Figure 1). One patient in each 
group was an early drop-out and excluded from further analyses. No patient was lost to 
the immediate assessment after SLT or after waiting, but one patient in each group 
(1 %) was lost prior to the 6-month follow-up. Eight patients experienced adverse 
events (AEs) during the SLT or waiting period unrelated to study participation (1 car 
accident, 2 common colds, 3 gastrointestinal or cardiac symptoms, 2 recurrent strokes). 
In total, patients received 3-10 weeks of SLT (median: four weeks), with 22·5-49 hours 
of intensive SLT within the first three weeks (median: 31 hours).

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are reported in Table 1/Suppl. Table 
1. Groups did not differ regarding stroke- or aphasia-related variables except for a 
higher frequency of initial thrombolysis in the WL-CG (36% versus 19%). There was a

trend towards a longer post-stroke time period in the I-SLT-G (medians: 43 versus 27 
months). 
 
 
Primary analysis 
Gains in verbal communication effectiveness from pre to post the 3-week intensive SLT 
(primary endpoint) versus 3-weeks of waiting were significantly larger in the I-SLT-G 
(mean difference: 2·61 +/- SD 4·94, 95% CI: 1·49 to 3·72) compared to the WL-CG 
(mean difference: -0·03 +/- SD 4·04; 95% CI: -0·94 to 0·88; group difference: p < 
0·001, Cohen’s d = 0·58; see Figure 2 - left panel and Table 2). The group difference 
was independent of potential moderator variables, e.g. age or time post-index stroke 
(see Suppl. Information for the list of analysed moderator variables).

Secondary analyses 
 
Primary outcome measure 
On the primary outcome measure (ANELT A-scale), the WL-CG showed no significant 
changes across the 3-week waiting period. Once the 3-week intensive SLT was 
delivered to this group, the gain in verbal communication was comparable to the I-
SLT-G (see Figure 2 - right panel and Suppl. Table 3). Both study groups showed stable 
treatment effects over the course of six months (see Figure 2 - right panel and Table 2). 
 
An additional analysis for the subsample of patients with ≥5 weeks of intensive SLT 
(n=34) revealed that the treatment effect in the primary outcome measure (ANELT A-
scale) after a median of six weeks of intensive SLT (mean increase from pre to post 
SLT: 4·23 +/- SEM 0·73 points; 95% CI: 2·74 to 5·73) was approximately one point 
larger compared to the assessment after the initial three weeks of intensive SLT (mean 
increase from pre to post SLT: 3·32 +/- SEM 0·97 points; 95% CI: 1·35 to 5·29). Groups 
with intensive SLT limited to three weeks versus at least five weeks did not differ with 
respect to age, sex, years of education, initial stroke severity, aphasia severity, or 
aphasia syndrome distribution (all p > 0·13). 
 
Secondary outcome measures 
Scores on the linguistic screening measure (SAPS; total score, as well as the lexicon 
and syntax subtotals; see Suppl. Information) and patients’ health-related quality of 
life ratings (SAQOL-39: total score and subscale ‘psychosocial’) significantly improved 
from pre to post the 3-week intensive SLT compared to the 3-week waiting period (all 
p<0.05, see Table 2 and Fig. 3). Group differences in linguistic gains (SAPS scores) 
were not correlated with the analysed moderator variables (see Suppl. Information).

Figure 3: Left: Mean +/- SEM score for the linguistic measure (SAPS total score) from 
pre to post the 3-week intensive SLT (I-SLT-G: red line) versus waiting (WL-CG: grey 
line). Right (analyses without group factor): Mean +/- SEM score on the SAPS total 
score from pre (first baseline in the WL-CG) to post the 3-week SLT and at the 6-
month follow-up in the I-SLT-G (red line) and the WL-CG (grey line). SLT = speech 
and language therapy. 
 
Treatment-related gains on secondary outcomes, including significant others’ 
judgements assessing the patients’ communicative effectiveness (CETI) remained 
stable over the 6-month follow-up period in both groups (see Supp. Table 2). 
 
No significant group differences from pre to post the 3-week intensive SLT versus 
waiting emerged for the ANELT B-scale (acoustic intelligibility), the SAPS phonology 
score, nonverbal cognitive functions (NVLT, TMTs), or stroke-related physical 
dependency (modified Rankin Scale/mRS). 
 
Predictors of primary treatment success  
Of all patient-, stroke- (see Suppl. Information), and SLT-related variables, only 
baseline stroke severity was a significant predictor of immediate treatment success in 
verbal communication. Patients with less severe stroke in the mRS at enrolment

showed larger treatment gains. There were no significant predictors of long-term 
treatment stability over six months.

Discussion 
The results of the randomised multi-centre trial FCET2EC demonstrate that three 
weeks of intensive SLT administered under routine clinical conditions compared to 
three weeks deferral of intensive SLT significantly improved verbal communication 
(primary outcome) in patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia. Additionally, specific 
linguistic measures (lexicon, syntax) and communication-related quality of life ratings 
of both the patients and a significant other increased in response to intensive SLT. 
There were no significant moderators of the treatment effect, indicating that no 
particular feature of patient subgroups was driving the effect, and that therapy setting 
(in- or outpatient) did not influence the outcome. Untrained cognitive functions, like 
nonverbal learning or executive functioning, did not change from pre- to post-SLT, 
corroborating specificity of treatment effects. 
 
Once treated with intensive SLT, the control group showed comparable improvements 
in primary and secondary language outcomes, thus replicating the primary treatment 
effect. Despite the chronic stage of their post-stroke aphasia, 69 of the 156 patients 
(44%) improved by at least a mean difference of three points on the primary outcome 
measure from pre to post three weeks of intensive SLT, merely 16 patients (10%) 
declined by at least three points. This indicates that the observed treatment effect is 
not based on a small group of outliers. Of note, the control group did not improve with 
an average of 1·5 hours of outpatient SLT/week during the 3-week waiting period and 
the entire intensively treated group did not improve with an average of 1·2 hours 
outpatient SLT/week during the 6-month follow-up period (see Supplementary Table 1 
and Figure 2). Thus, even an extended period of low intensity SLT did not result in a 
significant treatment effect. 
 
None of the randomised patients dropped out of the intensive SLT. Clearly, this 
mitigates the concern expressed by the most recent Cochrane review on aphasia 
rehabilitation (9) that superior outcomes of intensive versus non-intensive SLT studies 
may be biased by a higher drop-out rate in intensive SLT studies, resulting in a 
selection of particularly motivated patients. The absence of patient drop-outs during 
the intervention period also demonstrates the general feasibility of intensive SLT for 
routine clinical care. The problem of implementing intensive SLT into the clinical 
routine seems to be more of an economic nature as 153 patients could not participate 
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia 
21
in the intensive SLT intervention due to staff shortage in the respective rehabilitation 
centre at the time of the patient’s referral. 
 
The only significant predictor of primary treatment success was stroke severity. Stroke 
patients with milder stroke severity (mRS) at inclusion showed larger increases in 
verbal communication effectiveness from pre- to post-SLT. Furthermore, both study 
groups retained SL treatment gains over at least six months, demonstrating the 
stability of the effect. 
 
The average gain of approximately three points on the primary outcome ANELT A-
scale from pre- to post-intensive SLT may appear moderate with respect to the clinical 
impact. To our knowledge, there are no published studies on the association of ANELT 
change scores with clinical impact ratings. From a clinical perspective, even a 1-point 
increase in verbal effectiveness in daily life situations, like changing a doctor’s 
appointment by phone, is clinically important because it may reflect a change from “no 
relation to communicative scenario at all” (score 1) to “minimum requirements of the 
communicative scenario are fulfilled” (score 2). A numerically small change may thus 
reflect a categorical shift from “no social participation at all” to “at least low grade of 
social participation”.  
A few trials using the ANELT A-scale as therapy outcome measure reported average 
gains of at least five points from pre to post the intervention period. However, these 
studies included patients in the (sub-)acute phase post stroke. This magnitude of 
change is thus not directly comparable to our chronic stroke sample because of the 
strong influence of spontaneous language recovery during the first six months post 
stroke. For example, the RATS-1 study (15) found an average gain of about five points 
on the ANELT A-scale when comparing verbal communication at the subacute phase 
(~3 months post stroke) with a second assessment seven months later (~10 months 
post onset). The RATS-2 study (19) reported therapy-induced ANELT A-scale change 
scores of 10 points from the acute (3 weeks post onset) to the postacute (three months 
post the initial stroke) phase; from the subacute to the chronic (six months post stroke 
onset) phase, the incremental improvement was on average two points. Patients in the 
present study were on average several years beyond their last stroke, had received only 
three weeks of intensive SLT before the immediate outcome assessment and still 
gained on average three points (which represents more than 50% of the intraindividual 
 Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia 
22
SD). Therapy duration may also be a critical issue with respect to treatment effects: the 
subsample of 34 patients in our study with ≥5 weeks of intensive SLT had gained on 
average >4 points compared to the baseline assessment. This indicates that more 
prolonged intensive treatment durations or repeated periods of intensive SLT in the 
chronic stage post stroke may yield even stronger treatment effects, comparable to 
those observed in the spontaneous recovery phase early after stroke. Thus, our findings 
undermine the dogma that functional improvements cannot be achieved in the chronic 
stage post-stroke. The magnitude of the observed therapy effect (about 10 percent 
improvement from baseline) is comparable to the typical improvement observed after 
several-week physiotherapy programs in chronic post-stroke motor rehabilitation (29) 
and may reflect a physiological limit of training-induced functional recovery after a 
single training episode in the chronic post-stroke stage.  
The off-line scoring of the primary outcome measure by an independent endpoint 
committee was fully blinded. However, we concede that the administration of the 
primary outcome measure was not blinded due to the health care character of the 
study. Assessors were comprehensively trained in ANELT assessment; however, they 
remained naïve with respect to ANELT scoring. The scenario instructions had to be 
read word-for-word to the patient, no verbal or nonverbal interactions with the patient 
were otherwise permitted during assessment. The endpoint committee had verified 
during scoring that assessors had strictly complied with the protocol in all cases. 
 
The major strength of the current trial is the demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement with medium to large effect sizes in verbal communication and linguistic 
abilities with a parallel increase in communication-related quality of life ratings of both 
the patients and their significant others after merely three weeks of intensive SLT, 
provided under routine clinical conditions, in a large sample of chronic post-stroke 
aphasia patients. Low intensity SLT as provided during the waiting period in the 
control group (mean of 1·5 hours/week) or during the 6-month follow-up period post 
intensive SLT (mean of 1·2 hours/week) was ineffective. We cannot rule out, however, 
that low intensity SLT may have supported the maintenance of the immediate 
treatment effect. This finding clearly demonstrates that a boost of intensive SLT is the 
key to successful aphasia rehabilitation in the chronic stage post stroke, urgently 
requiring a change in the way rehabilitation resources are currently used.

We would like to acknowledge several limitations: The study design did not address 
whether there is a critical time window post-stroke to achieve maximum treatment 
effects. Patients were at least 6-month post the initial stroke in the present study (to 
methodologically control for the effects of spontaneous recovery), and the majority of 
patients were several years post-stroke (s. Table 1). A seminal study by Wertz and 
colleagues (30) had provided first evidence that intensive SLT is also effective when 
initiated in the (sub-) acute stage post-stroke. Furthermore, our findings cannot 
elucidate whether (i) a moderately less intense SLT regimen, e.g. six hours/week (13), 
is sufficient to achieve comparable effects, (ii) cumulative treatment effects can be 
achieved with extended treatment periods or repeated intensive SLT periods, (iii) 
patients aged > 70 years or in the postacute post-stroke stage benefit similarly from 
intensive SLT as suggested by a recent cohort analysis (31), (iv) the observed treatment 
effect is specific to the agreed-best-practice SLT approach applied in the current study, 
(v) total hours of SLT provided are as important as treatment intensity (10), and (vi) 
low intensity SLT is required to achieve stability of treatment effects following the 
intensive intervention. 
 
In conclusion, FCET2EC is the first multi-centre RCT in chronic post-stroke aphasia to 
directly demonstrate the superiority of intensive SLT to a no or low intensity treatment 
(waiting list) control condition. Three weeks of intensive SLT with ≥10 hours/week in 
an in- or outpatient setting can thus be considered an evidence-based intervention for 
the entire population of stroke patients suffering from chronic aphasia.

Participants with global aphasia (and to a lesser degree with Wernicke’s aphasia) do not show overall floor performance on the AAT because of the chronic stage 
post-stroke and because of our inclusion criteria [section on “Participants”: “…basic comprehension abilities and at least rudimentary attempts to verbally 
communicate (communication score >0 on the AAT spontaneous speech rating scales), and the ability to follow simple instructions (≥1 correct response on the 
first 10 items of the AAT Token Test)], Moreover, the AAT profile level (measure of aphasia severity) only provides an estimate of the overall performance level in 
the AAT subtests and does not include information on the profile of spontaneous speech ratings, which on the other hand is highly relevant for the syndrome 
group assignment. Therefore, some non-coincidences between aphasia syndrome and aphasia severity categorization are to be expected.

Screening measures and secondary outcome measures 
In an initial screening session prior to study inclusion, the following measures were 
administered: 
• language: Aachen Aphasia Test/AAT (1), comprising an assessment of 
spontaneous speech (study inclusion criterion: communication score >0), the 
Token Test, written language, repetition, naming, and language comprehension. 
AAT results were used to determine aphasia syndrome (Broca, Wernicke, global, 
anomic, non-classifiable) and severity [average weighted score of all AAT 
subtests: AAT profile-level T-score; the AAT profile level T-score also served to 
classify patients into aphasia severity groups: severe (T-score < 46), moderate 
(T-score: 46-54.9),  
mild (T-score: 55-62.9; minimal (T-score > 63)], 
• apraxia of speech: 48-item version of the Hierarchical Word Lists (HWL) (2), 
• visual neglect: Bells Test (3), 
• nonverbal intellectual functioning: Subtest picture completion of the Wechsler 
Adult Intelligence Scale – Revised (WAIS-R) (4), 
• verbal and nonverbal attention/working memory: Subtests digit span and visual 
span of the Wechsler Memory Scale – Revised (WMS-R) (5), 
• nonverbal short-term memory: Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) (6), 
• retrospective assessment of premorbid handedness (Edinburgh Handedness 
Inventory (EHI) (7), 
• depressive mood assessed with the “sadness” item of the Visual Analog Mood 
Scales (VAMS) (8).

Treatment duration, dosage, intensity, and content 
Treatment was administered to all participating patients for a duration of at least three 
weeks (15 consecutive treatment days, excluding weekends and public holidays). 
During this intervention, patients received manual-based, yet individually tailored 
therapist-guided SLT for at least one hour per day, totalling at least 10 hours per week 
(treatment intensity). About two thirds of the therapy targeted language-systematic 
and about one third communicative-pragmatic language functions (therapy content) 
(9-11). Therapy was administered in one-to-one (two thirds of total therapy time) as 
well as in group therapy settings (one third of total therapy time). Patients additionally 
performed self-managed linguistically based exercises (if suitable with a standardized 
PC training program) customized to their individual therapy foci for at least one hour 
per day, totalling at least five hours per week. Overall, participants thus underwent a 
minimum of 45 hours (treatment dosage) of individualized language exercises during 
the first three weeks of the intervention. 
Identification of individual treatment targets 
Selection of individual initial SLT targets was based on baseline performance in two 
novel screening tools: (i) a language-systematic measure assessing receptive and 
expressive language functions at three levels of complexity and focusing on the core 
language domains of phonology, lexicon, and syntax (Sprachsystematisches 
APhasieScreening/SAPS) (12); (ii) a measure assessing communicative-pragmatic 
skills with a battery of nine tasks with increasing communicative demands, ranging 
from object identification and naming to complex role plays (Kommunikativ-
Pragmatisches Screening/KOPS; Glindemann R. and Ziegler W., in preparation). All 
KOPS tasks were embedded in a communicative interaction, and responses were 
allowed in nonverbal communication modes like drawing or gesturing (whenever 
responses could not be given verbally).  
 Supplemental information:

For treatment of language-systematic deficits, the two domains demonstrating 
impairments at the lowest level of complexity in either the receptive or the expressive 
modality became initial treatment targets. If the impairment was equally severe in all 
three language domains, syntax was targeted prior to the lexicon, while phonology was 
targeted last. This hierarchy of treatment targets was motivated by the overall 
treatment goal of improving verbal communication effectiveness. Influential theories 
of language production (13) suggest that language processing at a syntactic level (as 
required when completing short sentence fragments) automatically activates lexical 
and phonological information (14). For patients with comparable impairments across 
phonological, lexical and syntactic domains, the predominant targeting of syntactic 
processing in SLT is therefore the most economical approach. 
If receptive and expressive modalities were equally impaired within a linguistic 
domain, receptive functions were targeted prior to expressive functions. This hierarchy 
was selected because basic receptive functions are generally considered a prerequisite 
for improvements in expressive language functions (15). Furthermore, training 
sentence comprehension has been shown to generalize to sentence production ability, 
while the reverse facilitation has not been demonstrated (16-18).  
Selection of treatment targets for communicative-pragmatic deficits was based on 
resource-oriented principles of functional communication therapy. The major 
principle here is to train patients' ability to receive or convey messages regardless of 
the mode to communicate effectively despite their language-systematic deficits in 
interactive settings. Specifically, the two least impaired types of tasks among those 
demonstrating a baseline performance of less than 80% correct were targeted for 
treatment. In the few cases where a patient performed ≥80% correct on each of the 
nine communicative tasks at baseline, the two most affected tasks among those 
showing relatively mild impairments (i.e., ≥80% correct) were targeted for treatment.  
The contents of the individual SLT were tailored along these selection criteria, and, 
whenever feasible, they also determined the content of the group sessions.  
 
Treatment manual 
Prior to inclusion of the first patient, a treatment manual (Grewe, T., Baumgaertner, A., 
Abel, S., Glindemann, R., Domahs, F., Regenbrecht, F., Schlenck, K.-J., & Thomas, M., 
in preparation) was compiled to assist therapists in choosing appropriate modules for 
each patient’s individual therapy targets. The manual also served to enhance 
 Supplemental information:

5
transparency and comparability of treatment administration across centres. It offered 
a range of modules from which appropriate exercises for a given patient could be 
selected (two language-systematic and two communicative-pragmatic targets, see 
section above). The exercises represent current best practice in SLT as agreed upon by 
the eight authors of the manual in several round table discussions.  
The manual additionally reflects the underlying principles of the two screening 
measures SAPS and KOPS, and the treatment material contained in the manual 
resembles the SAPS and KOPS test stimuli in terms of linguistic structure and task 
demands. The language-systematic part of the manual offers treatment modules in 
the three core language domains (phonology, lexicon, and syntax). In the phonological 
domain, receptive tasks include syllable discrimination and identification, while 
expressive tasks require repetition of pseudowords of increasing complexity. In the 
lexical domain, receptive tasks include word-picture matching and decisions on 
synonymy and semantic features, while expressive tasks require production of 
increasingly complex object names upon picture presentation. In the receptive 
syntactic domain, patients are asked to identify the agent by forced choice between two 
pictures in orally presented sentences of increasing syntactic complexity; in the 
expressive syntactic domain, patients are asked to produce object-verb phrases, 
subject-verb-object structures, and complement clauses upon picture presentation. 
The communicative-pragmatic part of the manual was based on the nine KOPS tasks 
with increasing communicative demands. They include  
(i) object identification,  
(ii) object naming,  
(iii) basal communicative actions (e.g. expressing disagreement),  
(iv) communication of personal and (v) general information,  
(vi) comprehending or (vii) conveying street directions,  
(viii) conveying complex messages in non-interactive role play situations, and  
(ix) responding to non-cooperative communication partners in interactive role plays of 
everyday communicative situations.  
Patients were encouraged to respond in any communication mode, i.e., with speech, 
hand gestures, writing, or drawing.

Prior to patient enrolment, participating SL therapists were thoroughly trained by the 
authors of the manual. This included the use of the manual and documentation in the 
respective forms. The SL therapists closely monitored patients’ compliance with self-
administered exercises (frequently PC training) by going over the practice sheets/tasks 
together with the patient during the following treatment session. In addition, 
therapists frequently (usually after one week of treatment) mailed the completed 
therapy documentation forms (containing frequency, duration and type of treatment 
as well as type of task) to a supervisor assigned to their centre (i.e., one of the authors 
of the treatment manual). Based on these forms, supervisors gave feedback to the 
therapists regarding conformity with the therapy manual for at least 1 h/week per 
centre by telephone throughout the therapy phase. In addition, supervisors were 
available by telephone to discuss short-term decisions regarding therapy content 
and/or progression/regression for a given patient (see below) with the therapists.   
 
Treatment progression/regression 
Language-systematic treatment progressed in a standardized fashion to the next 
complexity level within a given linguistic domain/modality. If the highest level in the 
respective domain/modality was reached, treatment switched to the domain/modality 
‘next in line’ according to baseline assessment. Likewise, communicative-pragmatic 
therapy targets were adjusted to treatment-induced changes in performance 
(progression or regression to the next communicative demand level). Progression in 
response to stable advance in performance, or regression to a lower complexity level in 
case of performance deterioration, was guided by a standardized treatment protocol. 
This included daily monitoring of patients’ performance in the current therapy 
modules. Depending on the results of the monitoring, stable ceiling performance (> 80 
percent correct) in a module resulted in progression to a more complex module, while 
a deterioration in performance led to regression to a less demanding treatment module. 
SLT duration and content were documented on a daily basis.   
 
Treatment per-protocol 
Pooled across groups, 136 of 156 patients were treated per protocol during the 3-week 
critical SLT. The treatment of 15 patients showed minor protocol deviations (i.e., ≥24 
hours SLT were provided in weeks 1-3, but SLT was interrupted for up to three days 
because of minor medical problems or public holidays). Major deviations occurred in 
 Supplemental information:

7
five patients (4 patients: <24 hours of SLT in weeks 1-3 and/or an interruption of SLT 
for 4-5 days; 1 patient: refusal to complete the self-managed linguistic exercises). 
Importantly, no patient of either group (intensive SLT started after the 3-week waiting 
period in the control group) received less than 22.5 hours of SLT during the first three 
critical weeks of SLT, i.e., SLT was “intensive” (i.e., ≥ 5 h/week) for all patients.

4. 
Procedures: Describe each of the procedures, activities, and/or 
processes used in the intervention, including any enabling or 
support activities. 
 
Individual and group therapy led by speech-language 
therapist extensively trained in the use of the 
Treatment Manual; self-managed PC-training 
customized to individual patients’ primary linguistic 
deficits. Daily documentation of content and duration 
of therapy by treating therapists; regular monitoring of 
treatment conformity by centre supervisors (i.e. the 
authors of the Treatment Manual) (in: Procedures; see 
also Supplemental Information) 
 
_____________ 
5. 
WHO PROVIDED 
 
For each category of intervention provider (e.g. psychologist, 
nursing assistant), describe their expertise, background and any 
specific training given. 
Professional speech and language therapists who 
conducted therapy as part of their clinical routine and 
who had been extensively trained in using the Therapy 
Manual by the authors of the Manual to select 
exercises conforming with patients’ initial therapy 
goals, rate patients’ performance during daily 
monitoring, adjust therapy content according to the 
results of the daily monitoring (if necessary after 
consulting with the centre supervisor), and complete 
the documentation forms  
 
6. 
HOW 
 
Describe the modes of delivery (e.g. face-to-face or by some other 
mechanism, such as internet or telephone) of the intervention and 
whether it was provided individually or in a group. 
 
Face-to-face individual and group therapy 
(recommended group size: between 2 and 4 
participants) led by speech-language therapists 
extensively trained in the use of the Treatment 
Manual; self-managed PC-training customized to 
individual patients’ primary linguistic deficits (in: 
Procedures; see also Supplemental Information)

WHERE 
Treatment conducted in the participating rehabilitation 
centres as part of the clinical routine 
--- 
 
Describe the type(s) of location(s) where the intervention occurred, 
including any necessary infrastructure or relevant features. 
 
 
_____________ 
8. 
WHEN and HOW MUCH 
 
Describe the number of times the intervention was delivered and 
over what period of time including the number of sessions, their 
schedule, and their duration, intensity or dose. 
 
Therapist-guided daily treatment for at least 10 h per 
week (usually 2 h per day), over the course of at least 
3 weeks (a subgroup of patients was granted extension 
of intensive SLT by their respective health care 
providers) plus ≥5 hours/week self-managed PC-
training targeting individual linguistic deficits. 
Treatment sessions lasted between 30 min and 1 hour 
and were scheduled individually for each patient by 
the rehabilitation facility, depending on a patient’s 
overall therapy regimen (details in Supplemental 
Information) 
 
 
--- 
9. 
TAILORING 
 
If the intervention was planned to be personalised, titrated or 
adapted, then describe what, why, when, and how 
Treatment was tailored to each patient’s individual 
language profile/deficits. Selection of individual initial 
SLT targets was based on baseline performance in two 
novel screening tools (see Supplemental Information 
for details): a language-systematic measure assessing 
receptive and expressive language functions at three 
levels of complexity and focusing on core language 
domains (SAPS), and a measure assessing 
communicative-pragmatic skills with a battery of nine 
tasks with increasing communicative demands 
(KOPS). Treatment progressed (or regressed) 
depending on a patient’s individual performance on 
daily monitoring items reflecting a patient’s current 
therapy targets

MODIFICATIONS 
No modifications were implemented regarding the 
procedures described in the Therapy Manual. 
 
 
If the intervention was modified during the course of the study, 
describe the changes (what, why, when, and how).

11. 
HOW WELL 
 
 
 
Planned: If intervention adherence or fidelity was assessed, describe 
how and by whom, and if any strategies were used to maintain or 
improve fidelity, describe them. 
 
Planned: Therapists mailed the completed therapy 
documentation forms – usually after one week of 
therapy - to the supervisor assigned to their centre (i.e., 
one of the authors of the treatment manual). Based on 
these forms, supervisors gave feedback to the 
therapists regarding conformity with the therapy 
manual for at least 1 h/week per centre by telephone 
throughout the therapy phase. In addition, supervisors 
were available by telephone throughout the treatment 
phase to discuss short-term decisions regarding 
therapy content and/or progression/regression for a 
given patient with the therapists._____________ 
 
 
_____________ 
12.ǂ 
 
Actual: If intervention adherence or fidelity was assessed, describe 
the extent to which the intervention was delivered as planned. 
Actual: All patients (n=156) completed the treatment. 
Pooled across groups, 136 of 156 patients were treated 
per protocol during the 3-week critical SLT. Treatment 
of 15 patients showed minor protocol deviations (i.e., 
≥24 hours SLT were provided in weeks 1-3, but SLT 
was interrupted for up to three days because of minor 
medical problems or public holidays). Major 
deviations occurred in five patients (4 patients: <24 
hours of SLT in weeks 1-3 and/or an interruption of 
SLT for 4-5 days; 1 patient: refusal to complete the 
_____________ 
 TIDieR checklist: Intensive SLT improves verbal communication in chronic post-stroke aphasia

self-managed language-systematic exercises). 
Importantly, no patient of either group (intensive SLT 
started after the 3-week waiting period in the control 
group) received less than 22.5 hours of SLT during the 
first three critical weeks of SLT, i.e., SLT was 
“intensive” (i.e., ≥ 5 h/week) for all patients (see 
Supplemental Information, Treatment-per-protocol).

** Authors - use N/A if an item is not applicable for the intervention being described. Reviewers – use ‘?’ if information about the element is not reported/not   sufficiently reported.         
† If the information is not provided in the primary paper, give details of where this information is available. This may include locations such as a published protocol      or other 
published papers (provide citation details) or a website (provide the URL). 
ǂ If completing the TIDieR checklist for a protocol, these items are not relevant to the protocol and cannot be described until the study is complete. 
* We strongly recommend using this checklist in conjunction with the TIDieR guide (see BMJ 2014;348:g1687) which contains an explanation and elaboration for each item. 
* The focus of TIDieR is on reporting details of the intervention elements (and where relevant, comparison elements) of a study. Other elements and methodological features of 
studies are covered by other reporting statements and checklists and have not been duplicated as part of the TIDieR checklist. When a randomised trial is being reported, the 
TIDieR checklist should be used in conjunction with the CONSORT statement (see www.consort-statement.org) as an extension of Item 5 of the CONSORT 2010 Statement. 
When a clinical trial protocol is being reported, the TIDieR checklist should be used in conjunction with the SPIRIT statement as an extension of Item 11 of the SPIRIT 2013 
Statement (see www.spirit-statement.org). For alternate study designs, TIDieR can be used in conjunction with the appropriate checklist for that study design (see www.equator-
network.org).
