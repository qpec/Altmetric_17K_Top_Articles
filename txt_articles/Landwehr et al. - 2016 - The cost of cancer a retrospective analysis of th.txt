Introduction
Cancer is a more expensive illness than most people real-
ize [1]. In addition to the obvious costs, including medical 
bills and prescription co- 
pays, financial status is negatively 
impacted by missed work, costs of follow- 
up care and a 
paucity of financial assistance resources, particularly for 
patients who have completed cancer therapy [1–3]. The 
financial burden of cancer is uniquely challenging for 
young adults (YAs), who lack not only the life experience 
and financial security of older adults but also the parental 
support that may benefit children. As a result, YAs may 
finish treatment with empty savings accounts and bleak 
financial futures. Patients experiencing financial hardship 
may struggle with impossible decisions about which bills 
to pay and which to skip, whether to risk going without 
insurance or medications or declare bankruptcy instead 
[2], and determining if and how to pay for follow- 
up 
care [4, 5]. These challenges may engender feelings of 
depression and anxiety, and may negatively impact quality 
of life [6].
The Samfund, a national nonprofit organization, has 
provided direct financial assistance and online support 
since 2005 to help YAs reduce debt, live independently 
and move forward toward their goals. Data collected by 
The Samfund over the past decade provide a detailed 
representation of the experiences of that subset of YA 
survivors who have faced severe financial toxicity [7, 8]

Abstract
Young adult cancer survivors (YAs) are confronted with immense financial chal-
lenges in the wake of their treatment. Medical bills and loss of savings may 
cause YAs to forgo recommended medications or follow- 
up appointments. Young 
survivors with financial concerns also report depression, stress and anxiety. The 
Samfund is a national nonprofit organization that provides financial support 
to YAs post-treatment. To quantify the financial burden of cancer in YAs, a 
retrospective analysis was performed of data collected from Samfund grant 
 
applications of 334 YA cancer survivors. Grants were awarded between 2007 
and 2013 and grant recipients were consented electronically in 2014 for retro-
spective data analysis. Recipients ranged from 19 to 39 years of age at the time 
of their grant applications. Descriptive statistics were calculated and compared 
to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and U.S. census data on 
age- 
matched peers. Financial indicators of YA cancer survivors are worse in 
many domains than those of age- 
matched controls. Furthermore, YA survivors 
in their 30s report more perilous prefunding financial situations than younger 
grant recipients. Cancer has a devastating and age- 
specific impact on the finances 
of YAs. Philanthropic grants from the cancer support community, in conjunc-
tion with healthcare policy reforms, have the potential to break the cycle of 
financial need and help YAs move forward with their lives after cancer 
treatment.

Financial Impact of Cancer on YAs
and negative economic consequences as a result of their 
diagnosis and treatment.
Cancer in YAs
Approximately 70,000 YAs aged 15–39 were diagnosed 
with cancer in the United States in 2011 [9]. Cancer is 
the leading cause of disease- 
related death among YAs, 
and over the past 20 years survival rates for YAs have 
improved much less than other age groups. This disparity 
is thought to relate to inferior clinical trial enrollment 
and lack of research focus on this age group [10, 11]. 
Due to population growth and increasing cancer incidence, 
however, the number of YAs in the United States is 
expected to grow over the next decade [10–12]. Many 
will live for decades, often coping with lingering medical 
and financial effects of cancer treatment.
Cost of cancer treatment
Cancer treatment in the United States is extremely expen-
sive and costs continue to escalate [1]. Particularly con-
cerning are the inferior health outcomes noted in 
economically disadvantaged individuals – dangerous in a 
population with preexisting healthcare needs [13, 14]. 
Furthermore, medical debt is a common cause of bank-
ruptcy, especially in cancer patients [2]. In one study, 
adult cancer patients filed for bankruptcy 2.65 times more 
frequently than age- 
matched peers without cancer [2]. 
However, few studies have commented on the financial 
health of YAs. One report noted that bankruptcy occurs 
most frequently in cancers that predominate in YAs com-
pared to older adults, including lymphoma, leukemia, and 
thyroid cancer [3]. YAs who attempt fertility preservation 
incur significant additional expenses, since insurance rarely 
covers procedures or storage [15].
Financial issues specific to YAs
YAs are the most likely of all age groups to be uninsured, 
dramatically increasing the potential financial burden of 
cancer treatment [16, 17]. Among adults, YAs are the 
age group at greatest risk for unemployment:[18] 12.4% 
of YAs aged 20–24 years and 7.4% of those aged 
25–34 years are unemployed [18]. YAs are less likely to 
be employed than their siblings or peers without a cancer 
history [17]. Half of full- 
time students and workers with 
cancer endorse difficulty continuing with school or work 
[17, 19]. More than one third of YAs report that cancer 
negatively impacted their long- 
term educational or career 
plans [1].
Financial problems among YAs may result in decreased 
access to health care [4, 20]. Obtaining insurance can be 
a tricky process even for healthy YAs, as they transition 
from school to the workforce and from parents’ coverage 
to individual plans. Coverage among young adults 19–34 
has increased since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and 
state Medicaid expansions, though affordability still remains 
one of the largest challenges to enrollment [21]. Patients 
without health insurance are at risk for inconsistent follow-
 
up care [4] and negative health outcomes. YAs are more 
likely than elderly survivors to report financial barriers 
to medical care [4, 5], and are also 56–67% more likely 
than age- 
matched peers to forego medical care due to 
its cost [5].
Over one third of all cancer survivors in the U.S. report 
unmet needs for financial assistance during treatment [22]. 
Far less is known about financial problems of cancer 
survivors following therapy [20]. Some report that their 
financial difficulties are “almost worse than the disease 
itself [22].” Better supportive care to address financial 
concerns has the potential to improve both physical and 
mental health outcomes for YA survivors [22].
Methods
Sample
Data for this analysis were obtained retrospectively using 
deidentified information from grant applications submitted 
to The Samfund between 2007 and 2013. The Samfund 
awarded approximately 100–120 grants annually per year 
during this period (579 grants total), averaging $1,676.96 
per award. Eligible applicants resided in the Unites States 
and were cancer survivors aged 17–35 years until 2012, 
and aged 21–39 in 2013 and after. Survivors were defined 
as patients free of cancer, >1 year following completion 
of cancer therapy, or in remission on maintenance 
therapy.
The study sample contains data from applicants who 
received grants between 2007 and 2013. In 2014, all screened 
applicants from that time period (n = 1,102) were con-
tacted via email to request use of their data for this study. 
Of those contacted, 710 did not respond, 21 refused, and 
371 (33.6%) electronically consented to analysis of their 
deidentified data. Most of those who consented were 
funded applicants (72%) with a slightly higher mean age 
at application ([consenters: mean age = 28.7 years, median 
age = 29 years, 95% CI [−2.0, −0.5], SD = 4.6 years), 
(refusers: mean age = 27.4, median age = 28 years, 95% 
CI, SD = 5.1 years]) at P < 0.01. Ultimately only funded 
applicants were included, a total of 334 participants (57.7% 
of all eligible funded applicants). Age of funded applicants 
ranged from 19–39 in this sample. In Figure 2, an age- 
matched subsample (25–34) of 194 was used for 
comparison.

Measures
Applications of funded grant recipients who consented 
for the study were retrospectively analyzed. Applicants 
provide both demographic information and essays. In Part 
I of the application, survivors report their age, state of 
residence, living situation, data regarding cancer diagnosis 
and treatment dates, and extensive financial information 
regarding income, expenses, assets and liabilities (debts). 
Part II includes multiple essays, depending on specific 
funding requests and whether the applicant was funded 
previously. Applicants describe their cancer experience, 
its impact on finances, the immediacy of need, other 
sources of financial support, and how a grant would help 
them pursue life goals. Applicants submit a medical his-
tory verification signed by a clinician, a medical records 
release, and tax documentation from the past two years. 
A volunteer panel composed of cancer community part-
ners, former grant recipients, and other volunteers with 
a keen understanding of the challenges YAs face, reviews 
the applications using established measures. Selection cri-
teria include severity of financial need, lack of other sources 
of support, and articulation of how a grant will help 
applicants move forward with their goals. The panel mem-
bers review each application individually and subsequently 
meet as a group to rate them. The panel then makes 
funding recommendations which are reviewed and 
approved by The Samfund Board of Trustees. At 6, 12 
and 24 months post-funding, recipients are asked to rate 
their educational, professional and living situations and 
provide qualitative updates in essay form, describing 
changes in their lives and financial situations.
Analysis
Because no control group was available for this analysis, 
U.S. census data from 2011 and 2013 (using the groups 
“under age 35” and “25–34 years of age”, respectively) 
[23–25] and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 
(using the group “18–44 years of age”) [26] were utilized 
as proxies for comparison data. Census reports vary: the 
2011 reports used displayed household debt and net worth, 
whereas the 2013 reports included income and poverty 
data. The MEPS was chosen because it reports healthcare 
spending in the general population, as well as information 
about employment, income, demographics, and health care 
usage. These weighted samples were deemed acceptable 
proxies for control data due to the similar age range and 
the robust size of each dataset, though the datasets were 
different enough that further statistical comparisons were 
not conducted.
Within the Samfund study sample, financial indicators 
were compared between recipients under 30 years of age 
versus 30–39 years of age, using independent samples 
(two- 
way t- 
tests). Financial indicators analyzed included 
credit card debt, total liabilities, monthly income and 
expenses, and monthly medical and student loan expenses. 
To more precisely define how the financial struggles of 
YA cancer survivors vary by age, the study sample was 
also divided into quintiles and compared financial indices 
using t- 
tests. The relationship between homeownership 
and age was assessed via Pearson’s Chi- 
squared test.
Results
Financial status of Samfund grant recipients
Age in the study sample ranged from 19 to 39 at the 
time of application submission (mean age = 29.3 years, 
median age = 30.0 years, 95% CI [28.7, 29.8], 
SD = 4.4 years). Gender breakdown was 79.6% female, 
and 20.4% male, representative of The Samfund general 
applicant pool. Recipients resided in 42 of the 50 United 
States, and had completed cancer therapy a mean of 
3.5 years prior to submission of their applications 
(median = 1.8 years, 95% CI [3.0, 4.0], SD = 4.6). Their 
mean age of most recent diagnosis was 24.5 years 
(median = 26 years, 95% CI [23.7, 25.2], SD = 6.7) with 
an average of 1.2 cancer diagnoses per person (293 of 
the 334 listed one cancer diagnosis, 33 listed two, five 
listed three, and three listed four). Samfund grant awards 
ranged from $200 to $10,000. Recipients were funded a 
mean amount of $1,707.43 (median = $1,500.00, 95% CI 
[$1,603.76, $1,811.11], SD = $961.74).
The categories of funded grants are shown in Figure 1. 
Applicants may make up to three requests and are

typically funded for one or two. “Medical/insurance” grants 
include payments on current or residual medical bills, 
insurance premiums, prescription co- 
pays, dental expenses, 
or cosmetic/reconstruction procedures. “Rent/mortgage” 
includes living expenses and utilities. “Health/wellness” 
pertains to physical therapy, mental health payments, gym 
memberships, yoga, or alternative healing modalities 
including acupuncture and massage therapy. “Continuing 
education” refers to tuition, certificate program or testing 
fees, and books, as well as student loan payments. “Car- 
related” grants include car payments, repairs, or insurance. 
“Family building” grants fund banking, freezing and stor-
age of sperm, oocytes or embryos, procedures such as 
IUI or IVF, or adoption- 
related expenses. Grants in the 
“other” category include, but are not limited to: public 
transportation, professional apparel, groceries, and home 
modifications.
Comparison with U.S. census data and 
medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS)
Figure 2, which illustrates discrepancies in income, liabilities 
and net worth, compares groups within the study sample 
(N = 194 or 334) to proxy data for groups of comparable 
age the “average” population from the U.S. Census in 
2011 and 2013 [23–25]. The age groups in the U.S. Census 
that most closely matched our study sample were “18–
35 years of age,” in the 2011 census (N = 16,513,000) 
and “15–35 years of age” (N = 21,877,000) in the 2013 
census, both of which are slightly younger groups that 
Samfund grant recipients, who ranged from 19–39 years 
of age. To compare income of Samfund grant recipients 
to that of controls in the general population, data were 
extracted from the corresponding similar age range in 
the U.S. census. The largest differences between the study 
group and the general population occurred in the area 
of net worth (defined as the value of all things owned 
by an individual, such as home, car, cash, plus any invest-
ments, less any debts). According to U.S. Census data, 
the mean net worth of YAs is $68,479.00 in assets [25]. 
In contrast, YAs applying for Samfund grants had mean 
negative net worth of –$35,009.41 in debts. No further 
statistical analysis was pursued because the Samfund, U.S. 
census and MEPS datasets and age ranges were different, 
albeit grossly comparable.
Table 1 displays key financial indices in The Samfund’s 
study sample, comparing YA cancer survivors aged 
19–29 years to those aged 30–39 years at the time of their 
grant application. We assessed total liabilities, including 
student loans, medical and credit card debt, unpaid taxes, 
bank loans, mortgage balances, loans on retirement accounts, 
or other debts such as personal loans. Second, we evalu-
ated mean annual net income from all sources. Among 
the 68 YAs under age 30 receiving supplemental income 
(which may include SSI/SSDI, food stamps, or child sup-
port), the mean amount was $1,355.75 (median = $825.00, 
95% CI [−$547.65,$256.05], SD = $1,615.55), significantly 
less (P = 0.03) than the 61 YAs over age 30 receiving 
supplemental income, for whom the mean amount was 
$1,903.40 (median = $1,600.00, SD = $1,244.11). Some of 
the most pronounced financial differences in the age groups 
occur in the category of total liabilities and monthly expenses, 
both of which are significantly larger for the older group. 
Mean total liabilities were $37,760.16 in the younger group 
versus $59,012.16 in the older group. Monthly expenses 
averaged $1,490.94 for the younger group versus $2,135.70 
Figure 2. This bar graph illustrates the various levels of disparity in income, total liabilities, and net worth between the study population (YAs between 
19–39) and their approximately age- 
matched householders from U.S. Census Data.

for the older group (median = $1,395.00 and $2,143.00 
respectively, 95% CI [- 
$947.13,- 
$342.37], SD = $1,127.04 
and $1,585.26 respectively) and differed significantly at 
P < 0.01. There was less of a pronounced difference in 
monthly income ($1,385.84 vs. $1,851.14), though still also 
statistically significant at P = 0.04 (median = $680.00 and 
$1,780.00 
respectively, 
95% 
CI 
[- 
$906.56,- 
$24.05], 
SD = $2,326.31 and $1,627.11, respectively). The greater 
liabilities in the older group may be due to in part to 
credit card debt. On average, participants in the younger 
group reported $3,025.93 in total credit card debt whereas 
the older group reported $3,913.89, although this comparison 
was not statistically significant. YAs over 30 were also more 
likely to own a home. In YAs under 30, 36.6% (N = 49) 
reported having a mortgage, compared to 37.7% of YAs 
over 30 (N = 57). A chi- 
square test was performed and 
a significant relationship was found between age and home 
ownership, χ2 (1,N = 334) =4.60, P = 0.032.
In Table 2, the impact of age on financial status was 
analyzed by comparing financial indices between different 
age groups of grant recipients at the time of their grant 
applications. The study sample was divided into quintiles: 
19–21, 22–25, 26–30, 31–35, and 36–39 years of age. 
Liabilities were highest in the group aged 31–35 years. 
Total medical debt was lowest in the youngest recipient 
group. Credit card debt was highest in groups aged 30–39. 
Finally, the income- 
to- 
expense ratio was assessed, which 
indicates a person’s likelihood of being able to pay their 
bills each month. A score of 1.0 or higher indicates ability 
to meet expenses. Income- 
to- 
expense ratio was lowest 
(most unfavorable) in the youngest group, who are more 
likely to be in high school or college and therefore gen-
erating less income. In the study sample, only the group 
aged 22–25 years showed evidence of being able to meet 
their expenses from month to month. All other age groups 
of Samfund grant recipients, on average, had scores of 
less than 1.0 and therefore had expenses that exceeded 
their 
incomes. 
Furthermore, 
out- 
of- 
pocket 
medical 
expenses among Samfund grant recipients averaged 
$2,528.76 annually (N = 334) (Table 2), markedly higher 
than the median $610.00 reported by 18–44 year- 
olds 
surveyed by the MEPS in 2013 (N = 111,957,000) [26].
In their initial application essays, Samfund grant recipi-
ents reported negative financial sequelae related to cancer 
in statements such as, “When I became sick, my working

Financial Impact of Cancer on YAs
hours were reduced. The resulting financial decline forced 
me to rely on my credit card. Each month, I pay the 
minimum amount due, but the finance charges essentially 
negate my payments. The mounting debt terrifies me. It 
will permanently affect my credit, thus impacting my life 
forever (female, age 29).” Similarly, essays indicated stress 
induced by medical debt: “There’s just nothing left after 
I’ve paid my normal person bills of rent, car payments, 
grocery bills, school loans, etc., so the bills have accu-
mulated. The hospital calls regularly to urge me to pay 
more. I always pay what I can, but that leaves me with 
nothing to help re- 
build my savings account, to visit 
friends, to buy a pair of shoes or get ahead (female, age 
30).” Lastly, one YA recounted an inability to maintain 
follow- 
up care: “I am not able to go to my PT [physical 
therapy], primary care or radiation oncology visits…
because I can’t have yet another expense (female, age 
34).” Fourteen of 104 YAs in the sample (13.5%) men-
tioned foregoing medical follow- 
up appointments or skip-
ping/reducing their medications as a result of financial 
strain.
Grant recipients provided qualitative and quantitative 
data in follow- 
up surveys 6, 12, and 24 months fol-
lowing grant funding. Anecdotally, many respondents 
reported decreased stress and increased hope and empow-
erment in their follow- 
up surveys. One recipient noted, 
“[The grant] allowed me to continue to pay for my 
health insurance during a time that I didn’t know where 
the money was going to come from. It relieved a lot 
of the financial stress… and allowed me to focus on 
my schoolwork instead of…my health care costs (female, 
age 32).” Another reported, “[Receiving a Samfund 
grant] gave me confidence. After feeling so out of con-
trol of my life from cancer, it empowered me. I now 
have the resources to get my life back on track (female, 
age 29).”
Discussion
The YA survivors in this study face substantial financial 
challenges. They have markedly lower median income, 
greater out- 
of- 
pocket expenses, and lower net worth than 
YAs of similar age who responded to the 2011 and 2013 
U.S. Census [23]. According to the Commonwealth Fund, 
36% of YAs between 19 and 29 years of age in the general 
population report having medical debt [27], whereas 51% 
of the Samfund study sample reports having medical debt. 
YAs who leave work during cancer treatment may lose 
important professional development opportunities. Unlike 
healthy peers who have worked without interruption, these 
survivors must later contend with gaps on their résumés 
when applying for jobs. YAs lack the seniority and job 
security that accrues with time in many fields and may 
ease re- 
entry into the workforce for older cancer survivors. 
Anecdotally, Samfund recipients reported losing their jobs 
and subsequently having great difficulty being re- 
hired, 
sometimes because they are still too ill to work full time. 
YAs face lost work productivity related to cancer treat-
ment, which may impact subsequent career advancement 
[18, 28].
The sample data suggest that the financial impact of 
cancer is more severe in YAs aged 30–39 years compared 
to those under age 30. Although older YAs may be more 
to likely to marry and receive additional income through 
a partner, they may receive less parental assistance and 
have greater likelihood of dependent children and home-
ownership than the younger group. These facts could 
account for the observation that credit card debt is more 
than twice as high in YAs aged 26–39 compared to YAs 
under age 25. Medical debt in this sample increased 
consistently between 19–21 and 31–35 years of age. 
Medical debt rose most sharply in survivors aged 
26–30 years in comparison to younger YAs aged 
22–25 years, a 23.8% increase. Medical expenses also 
increased with age and were four times as high in the 
oldest compared to the youngest quintile of YA survivors 
in this dataset (Table 2).
Financial hardship may result in medical nonadherence 
[14, 29], which has a measurable impact on outcomes 
and is more marked in YAs than in older adult cancer 
survivors [4, 5, 29]. Numerous studies have documented 
that physicians are unlikely to initiate discussions about 
finances with adult cancer patients and survivors [6, 8, 
14, 30]. The 13.5% in the sample who reported foregoing 
care is likely an underreporting of the true frequency, 
because the Samfund application and follow- 
up essays do 
not explicitly ask about medical nonadherence. Broad, 
public recognition of financial struggle in cancer survivors, 
along with empowerment of patients to discuss financial 
issues openly with their healthcare providers, are important 
first steps toward controlling the cost of cancer therapy 
in the Unites States.
Finally, to date the medical literature has focused on 
the negative psychosocial impact of cancer- 
related financial 
hardship [6, 7, 31, 32]. Future studies should explore 
whether the presence of adequate financial support is 
associated with progression toward psychosocial recovery 
following cancer therapy. Furthermore, as a result of the 
Affordable Care Act (ACA) and state Medicaid expansion, 
5.7 million young adults who previously had no health 
insurance have obtained coverage since the first open 
enrollment period in October 2013 [33]. Future explora-
tion of pre- 
 versus post- 
ACA financial burden in the YA 
cancer population will also be interesting to consider, 
though no research examining long- 
term financial impacts 
of this legislation has yet been conducted.

Financial Impact of Cancer on YAs
M. S. Landwehr et al.
Study limitations
Selection bias is a limitation of this study, as this is a 
purposive sample composed of individuals with self- 
reported financial difficulties related to cancer. It appears 
that in this sample, cancer has a more negative financial 
impact on YAs aged 30–39 than on younger YAs, women 
are overrepresented, and the areas of greatest financial 
need are medical bills, insurance, living expenses, health 
and wellness endeavors, and continuing education or 
student loan payments. Since The Samfund has grown 
over the past decade and data were collected for internal 
purposes, certain demographic and financial characteristics 
were not assessed from the start of initial data collection 
(e.g., racial/ethnic identification has never been collected 
at the time of application to prevent reviewer bias, nor 
has education level; partner’s income and expenses were 
added a few years into data collection). Though financial 
indices did not differ substantially between funded and 
non-funded applicants, those who received grants may 
also have been more likely to consent to participation 
in this study. Future studies with a nationally representa-
tive sample of YAs are urgently indicated, in order to 
further define the financial needs of YA survivors, the 
characteristics of patients seeking financial assistance, and 
effective interventions to help YAs overcome financial 
toxicity.
Implications
Within the healthcare system, multidisciplinary oncology 
providers should discuss finances openly with YA survivors. 
This dialog has the potential to empower YAs, a popula-
tion at- 
risk for adverse financial, psychosocial, and health 
outcomes [12], and steer them toward reputable sources 
of financial support. Numerous not- 
for-profit agencies 
target the YA population and provide financial aid, edu-
cation and guidance. Grants such as those from The 
Samfund provide immediate financial relief by helping 
YA survivors pay expenses and/or debts, and may also 
offer renewed hope and confidence to grant recipients.
Further studies should examine the factors that promote 
successful financial recovery in YA cancer survivors and 
help them move forward in their lives.
