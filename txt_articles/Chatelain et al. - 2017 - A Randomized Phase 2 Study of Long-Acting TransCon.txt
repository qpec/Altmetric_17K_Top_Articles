Context: TransCon Growth Hormone (GH) (Ascendis Pharma) is a long-acting recombinant
sustained-release human GH prodrug in development for children with GH deficiency (GHD).
Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of weekly
TransCon GH to that of daily GH in prepubertal children with GHD.
Design: Randomized, open-label, active-controlled study of three doses of weekly TransCon GH
versus daily Genotropin (Pfizer).
Setting: Thirty-eight centers in 14 European countries and Egypt.
Patients: Prepubertal male and female treatment-na¨
ıve children with GHD (n = 53).
Interventions: Subjects received one of three TransCon GH doses (0.14, 0.21, or 0.30 mg GH/kg/wk)
or Genotropin 0.03 mg GH/kg/d for 26 weeks.
Main Outcome Measures: GH and insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, growth, adverse events,
and immunogenicity.
Results: Both GH maximum concentration and area under the curve were similar following
TransCon GH or Genotropin administration at comparable doses. A dose response was observed,
with IGF-1 standard deviation scores increasing into the normal range for all three TransCon GH
doses. Annualized mean height velocity for the three TransCon GH doses ranged from 11.9 cm to
13.9 cm, which was not statistically different from 11.6 cm for Genotropin. Adverse events were mild
to moderate, and most were unrelated to the study drug. Injection site tolerance was good. One
TransCon GH subject developed a low-titer, nonneutralizing antibody response to GH.
Conclusions: The results suggest that long-acting TransCon GH is comparable to daily Genotropin
for GH (pharmacokinetics) and IGF-1 (pharmacodynamics) levels, safety, and efficacy and support
advancement into phase 3 development. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1673–1682, 2017)

 H
uman growth hormone (GH), produced by and
secreted from the pituitary gland, is essential for
optimal body growth and key functions such as glucose
control, lipid metabolism, and bone turnover. GH binds
to specific cell surface receptors and exerts its effects both
directly in peripheral tissues (such as epiphyseal chon-
drocytes) and indirectly via insulinlike growth factor-1
(IGF-1). GH and IGF-1 work in concert, with important
effects on growth control and body composition. Al-
though acting synergistically on bone, GH and IGF-1
have opposing effects on adipose tissue; GH is lipolytic,
whereas IGF-1 is lipogenic (1).
Recombinant human GH, also known as somatropin,
became commercially available in the mid-1980s. The
amino acid sequence of somatropin is identical to the
22 kDa growth hormone secreted by the pituitary. To
date, childhood GH deficiency (GHD) treatment consists
of daily subcutaneous GH injections, and many GH
products are available.
In the past, children with GHD who began daily GH
replacement were expected to achieve normal adult height.
However, outcomes have not matched expectations; most
children with GHD who are treated with GH do not obtain
such stature (2). A major reason is poor adherence. The
explanations for this are varied (not to mention inconsistent
across observational studies) but include perceived in-
effectiveness, side effects, and social issues among pediatric
patients (and their parents), and denial and peer pressure
among adolescent patients (3, 4). Nonadherence also in-
creases with time, thus impairing therapeutic response (5,
6). Thus, optimizing patient adherence is critical, as are age
of diagnosis and GH initiation.
The burdensome nature of a daily injectable GH
makes a once-per-week, long-acting formulation attrac-
tive. Ideally, such a long-acting product would have
similar safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity profiles
compared with existing daily options, which could im-
prove adherence and compliance and, by extension, final
height. Furthermore, given both direct and IGF-1–mediated
GH effects, optimizing IGF-1 levels in relationship to GH in
target tissues is a desirable goal.
Over the years, there have been multiple attempts to
develop long-acting GH formulations. TransCon Growth
Hormone (Ascendis Pharma, Hellerup, Denmark) is a
sustained-release, inactive prodrug that consists of a
parent drug, GH, that is transiently bound to the
methoxypolyethylene glycol molecule via a proprietary
linker. The inert methoxypolyethylene glycol molecule
acts as a carrier, extending GH circulation time in the
body through a shielding effect that minimizes renal
excretion and receptor binding (Fig. 1).
Over a one-week period, TransCon GH releases
fully active, unmodified GH via autohydrolysis of the
TransCon Linker in a controlled manner on the basis of
naturally occurring hydrolysis that occurs at physiologic
pH and temperature. As such, the TransCon technology
is designed to maintain the same mode of action and
distribution as GH administered daily by allowing sus-
tained release of recombinant GH.
The purpose of this investigation was to compare
the pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics (PDs),
safety, and efficacy of three TransCon GH doses to that of
commercially available daily recombinant GH in pre-
pubertal children with GHD.
Methods
Study design
This was a phase 2, randomized, open-label, active-controlled
study of three different doses of weekly TransCon GH compared
with daily Genotropin (Pfizer, New York, NY). The study was
conducted at 38 centers in 14 countries in Europe and Egypt. Prior
to any study-specific procedure, institutional review board and
independent ethics committee approval and signed informed
consents from subject parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were obtained.
The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT01947907.
Population
Male and female prepubertal subjects [Tanner stage 1 boys
(age 3 to 12) or girls (age 3 to 11)] diagnosed with GHD on the

 basis of auxological and biological criteria were enrolled.
Auxological criteria for GHD diagnosis included short stature
[height defined as 2.0 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean
for age and sex] (7), inadequate height velocity (HV) (defined as
1.0 SD below the mean for age and sex) (8), body mass index
(BMI) within 2.0 SDs of the mean for age and sex, and bone age
no greater than chronological age (on the basis of x-rays of the
left hand and wrist and determined using a central bone age
reader). Biological criteria for GHD diagnosis included two
different GH stimulation tests with peak GH levels #10 ng/mL
(the second test was performed during screening and centrally
assayed) and baseline IGF-1 at least 1.0 SD below the mean for
standardized age and sex. Subjects were excluded if they had
received prior GH or IGF-1 treatment, had psychosocial
dwarfism, idiopathic (or other causes of) short stature, a cranial
tumor on magnetic resonance imaging of the head, GHD sec-
ondary to malignancy, abnormal fundoscopy, abnormal
SHOX1 gene analysis, Turner syndrome by karyotype, pres-
ence of anti-GH binding antibodies, and/or closed epiphyses.
Study protocol
Subjects attended six visits, one screening visit (to determine
eligibility) and five subsequent visits during 26 weeks of treatment
(weeks 1, 5, 13, and 26, along with day 1 of week 27 for follow-
up). The screening visit included a complete medical history and
physical examination (vital signs; weight; height measurement
using a wall-mounted, calibrated stadiometer; and fundoscopy),
electrocardiogram (ECG), and pubertal status assessment on the
basis of Tanner stages. Select laboratory tests were also performed,
including lipids, glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin, hor-
mones, urinalysis, hematology, and chemistry. Subsequent visits
included a physical examination, ECG, and repeat laboratory tests.
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of
three subcutaneous doses of TransCon GH (ACP-001), i.e.,
0.14, 0.21, or 0.30 mg GH/kg/wk (cohorts 1 to 3), or Geno-
tropin administered daily at a dose of 0.03 mg GH/kg/d (cohort
4; equivalent to TransCon GH 0.21 mg GH/kg/wk) for 26 weeks.
The study drug was administered on the basis of the subject’s weight
measured prior to dosing during week 1 and, if necessary, adjusted
on the basis of weight prior to dosing during week 13.
PKs, PDs, safety, and efficacy assessments
Blood samples for PK and PD profiling were drawn at
baseline and up to 168 hours after the dose during weeks 1 and
13. Additional samples were drawn at baseline (day 1) during
weeks 5 and 26 and at follow-up on day 1 of week 27. GH was
centrally quantified in serum by a validated sandwich enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (Celerion, Lincoln, NE), whereas
IGF-1, the primary PD biomarker, was centrally quantified in
serum by a validated chemiluminescence immunoassay (Lab-
oratorium f¨
ur Klinische Forschung, Schwentinental, Germany)
using a multidiscipline automated system (IDS iSYS; Immu-
nodiagnostic Systems, Bolden, UK). IGF-1 measurements were
based on normative values, and IGF-1 standard deviation score
(SDS) calculations were based on sex- and age-specific reference
ranges published by Bidlingmaier et al. (9).
For PK assessments during weeks 1 and 13, maximum GH
concentration (Cmax) was defined as the highest postdose
concentration. Area under the curve (AUC) for TransCon
GH–treated subjects was calculated on the basis of the drug
concentration at time 0 to 168 hours following the dose using
the linear trapezoidal rule; both uncorrected and baseline
(predose week 1) corrected AUCs were computed. AUC for
Genotropin-treated subjects was calculated on the basis of the
drug concentration at time 0 to 24 hours following the dose
multiplied by seven to be comparable to TransCon GH. For PD
assessment, time to maximum efficacy (TEmax) was defined as
the time needed to attain the highest IGF-1 response (Emax). IGF-1
area under the efficacy curve for both TransCon GH–treated and
Genotropin-treated subjects was calculated as for PKs.
To ensure that GH and IGF-1 levels at baseline did not affect
PK and PD calculations, posttreatment concentration data were
adjusted in the following two ways:
(1) Absolute baseline correction:
Ccorrected;t ¼ Cmeasured;t 2 Cmeasured;pre-dose
(2) Percent baseline correction:
Ccorrected;t ¼
�
Cmeasured;t 2 Cmeasured;pre-dose

Subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs), defined
as any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring
after drug therapy initiation, and serious AEs, defined as any un-
toward medical occurrence that was life-threatening, required inpa-
tient hospitalization, and/or resulted in significant disability or death.
Subjects were also monitored for local injection site toler-
ability. Pain was assessed on the basis of the Wong-Baker
FACES Pain Rating Scale (scale includes scores ranging from
0 to 5) (10); results were included if the pain was over score 3
and/or of a duration .15 minutes. Injection site reactions were
assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 on the basis of the presence of
redness, bruising, swelling, and/or itching.
Using validated assays, immunogenicity against GH-binding
antibodies was assessed at baseline for all visits by a tiered
approach (binding, confirmation, titer) and performed centrally
(Eurofins Pharma Bioanalysis Services UK, Abingdon, UK). Serum
samples confirmed positive for anti–GH-binding antibodies were
assessed for anti–GH-neutralizing antibody activity.
Statistical analysis
Demographic characteristics and peak GH at screening as
well as GH, IGF-1, height, HV, and anti-GH antibodies by visit
were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Height was measured
after 6 months of therapy and annualized HV (cm/y) was ex-
trapolated. The BMI SDS was calculated using Growth Ana-
lyzer Research Calculation Tools, version 4.0.30 (Rotterdam,
the Netherlands). Analysis of covariance for weeks 13 and 26
end points, including baseline and change in GH, IGF-1, height,
and HV for each cohort, was used to estimate least-square
means and 95% confidence intervals. AE summary incidence
rates, intensity, and relationship to the study drug were cal-
culated. If a subject experienced more than one AE for the same
period, only the AE with the strongest relationship or greatest
intensity was included.
Results
Subjects
A total of 170 subjects were screened. Fifty-five sub-
jects met inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned.

 Two subjects withdrew after random assignment but
before the first dosing and were thus excluded from
further analyses. The remaining 53 subjects were
randomly assigned to four groups. Cohort 1 (n = 12)
received TransCon GH 0.14 mg/kg/wk. Cohort 2 (n = 14)
received TransCon GH 0.21 mg/kg/wk. Cohort 3
(n = 14) received TransCon GH 0.30 mg/kg/wk. Cohort 4
(n = 13) received Genotropin 0.03 mg/kg/d (equivalent to
TransCon GH 0.21 mg/kg/wk).
The cohorts were balanced with respect to sex, race,
age, and baseline IGF-1 levels. All subjects were white;
38 (72%) were male and 15 (28%) were female (Table 1).
The mean GH on the stimulation tests for the four cohorts
was 5.0 ng/mL. At visit 1, the mean age was 8.0 years and
the mean height SDS was 23.1.
PKs
The mean GH serum concentration profiles following
subcutaneous administration of TransCon GH in week
13 are presented in Fig. 2. TransCon GH released GH in a
sustained manner over 168 hours, returning back to
baseline at the end of the interval for all three doses
without considerable accumulation. Median time to GH
Cmax with TransCon GH was 12 to 48 hours, delayed
compared with Genotropin administration (Fig. 3). GH
exposure (Cmax and AUC) after administration of
TransCon GH or Genotropin at comparable weekly
doses was similar.
PDs
The mean IGF-1 SDS at study baseline was approxi-
mately two SDSs below predicted for age and sex in
cohorts 1 to 3 (Table 1). Following TransCon GH
treatment, mean IGF-1 levels and IGF-1 SDSs increased
above study baseline, with IGF-1 levels higher at week 13
than week 1. This is consistent with multiple GH doses
being required to establish a stable weekly IGF-1 re-
sponse. Predose (trough) IGF-1 responses were consistent
from week 5 onward (data not shown). Following TEmax,
the IGF-1 response decreased, although levels did not
reach study baseline concentrations prior to the next dose
but rather remained at predose levels attained from week
13 onward (Fig. 4). At week 13, a dose response was
evident in mean absolute baseline–corrected data; IGF-1
SDSs increased into the normal range (21.0 to 2.0 SDSs)
on all three doses of TransCon GH.
Individual IGF-1 SDSs were ,2.0 for all cohort 1
subjects throughout the study. Two subjects in cohort 2
had IGF-1 SDS excursions .2.0 during week 13. Four
subjects (one in week 1 and three in week 13) in cohort 3
had IGF-1 SDSs .2.0. One additional subject in cohort 3
had an IGF-1 SDS excursion .3.0 during week 13. All
excursions above SDS 2.0 and 3.0 were transient, and
none resulted in dose modification. All subjects receiving
Genotropin had IGF-1 SDSs ,1.0 for both week 1 and
week 13.
Efficacy
Height was measured at 26 weeks. Among the three
weekly TransCon GH doses, mean annualized HV ex-
trapolated from the 26-week measurements ranged from
11.9 cm/y to 13.9 cm/y (Fig. 5). Mean annualized HV was
11.6 cm/y for daily Genotropin compared with 12.9 cm/y
at the equivalent weekly TransCon GH dose of 0.21
mg/kg/wk. At the end of 26 weeks, the minimum annu-
alized HV of 6.42 cm/y occurred at the lowest TransCon
GH dose (cohort 1) compared with 6.22 cm/y in the
Genotropin group, whereas the maximum annualized HV

 of 22.00 cm/y occurred at the highest TransCon GH dose
(cohort 3) compared with 19.25 cm/y in the Genotropin
group. However, the differences across the four cohorts
were not statistically significant. Dheight SDSs increased
from 0.7 to 0.9 in the three TransCon GH cohorts
compared with 0.6 in the Genotropin cohort (Supple-
mental Fig. 1).
Safety
There were no life-threatening AEs or AEs leading to
death, nor did any AE lead to subject withdrawal.
Twenty-nine subjects (54.7%) reported 53 AEs; all were
mild to moderate in intensity, and most were considered
to be either unrelated or unlikely to be related to the
study drug. Supplemental Table 1 describes treatment-
emergent AEs occurring in more than one subject in any
cohort.
One subject (1.9%) reported a serious AE (inguinal
hernia) assessed as mild in severity and considered un-
likely to be related to the study drug. Two subjects (3.8%)
reported AEs with possible or probable relationships to
the study drug. The first subject, who received TransCon
GH (cohort 1), reported mild decreased appetite, nausea,
and vomiting, which were assessed as possibly related
to the study drug. The second subject, who received
TransCon GH (cohort 3), experienced mild iron de-
ficiency anemia that was assessed as likely related to the
study drug.
Overall, AE incidence was similar across all three
TransCon GH doses (range 43% to 58%) and Geno-
tropin (61.5%). For all cohorts, the AEs observed were
consistent with the known safety profile of daily
somatropin.
TransCon GH and Genotropin tolerability were
similar. Injection site reactions were reported by 25
subjects (seven in cohort 1; six in cohorts 2, 3, and 4,
respectively), collectively, 141 times. Pain was most
common, reported by 22 subjects (five in cohorts 1 and 2,
respectively; six in cohorts 3 and 4, respectively), col-
lectively, 109 times. There was no injection site nodule
formation or lipoatrophy. Injection site reactions were
generally mild and transient and did not increase with

 TransCon GH dose. There were no notable differences in
injection site reactions between TransCon GH and
Genotropin.
No neutralizing anti–GH-binding antibodies were
detected. One subject (one of 40; 2.5%) receiving
TransCon GH (cohort 1) developed a treatment-
emergent, anti-GH immune response that was initially
detected at week 13. Titration at week 26 indicated the
presence of very low titers of nonneutralizing anti–GH-
binding antibodies that did not appear to affect PK or PD
profiles; the subject had an annualized HV of 19.0 cm, in
the top fiftieth percentile of cohort 1.
Across all treatment groups, no safety concerns were
detected by physical examination (including vital signs
and fundoscopy), ECG, or clinical laboratory parameters
(glucose, HbA1c, lipids, hormones, urinalysis, hematol-
ogy, and chemistry); data not shown. A few fasting
glucose and insulin levels were above the normal range.
However, prior or subsequent levels were normal, sug-
gesting that subjects were not fasting at the time of testing.
No differences were observed for lipids, glucose, HbA1c,
or insulin, suggesting that the effect of TransCon GH
on lipid and glucose metabolism was comparable to
Genotropin under study conditions (Supplemental Table 2).
Other results
Twenty-seven of 40 (68%) subjects had a BMI SDSbelow
zero at visit 1. The mean average change in BMI from visit 1
to visit 5 forcohorts1 to3 and cohort 4 was 0.03 and 20.66,
respectively. The overall mean change in BMI SDS for co-
horts1to3andcohort4was20.08and20.45,respectively.
Discussion
The results of this TransCon GH study demonstrated that
serum GH, as measured by Cmax and AUC over seven
days, was within physiological range and comparable to a
weekly cumulative dose of daily Genotropin, which is
interesting with respect to both safety and efficacy con-
siderations. IGF-1 changes demonstrated a dose-response
relationship to TransCon GH, whereas IGF-1 SDSs of all
three TransCon GH doses normalized. Mean annualized
HV ranged from 11.9 cm/y to 13.9 cm/y and compared
favorably with 11.6 cm/y for Genotropin administered
daily. AEs were mild to moderate, and most were un-
related to or unlikely to be related to the study drug.
TransCon GH injection site reactions were comparable to
those of daily GH, and with no lipoatrophy or nodule
formation observed. No neutralizing anti–GH-binding
antibodies were detected. The mean BMI SDS was stable
across the three TransCon GH cohorts, as expected,
compared with daily GH.
Depending on the methodology used, the prevalence of
daily GH nonadherence ranges from 5% to 82% (3). A
study in New Zealand by Cutfield et al. (6) demonstrated
that two-thirds of patients who missed one or more doses
per week showed significantly reduced linear growth
compared with compliant patients. Thus, short-acting

 daily GH products may be both safe and effective, but this
is of little consolation if they are not taken as prescribed.
It is well established that the simpler a regimen, the
more likely a patient will be to adhere to it, making long-
acting GH ideal for hormone-deficient children and
adolescents, a patient population that is subject to long-
term daily GH injections. Thus, the Growth Hormone
Research Society advised that developing a long-acting
compound is a worthy objective (5).
A long-acting GH should be on par with daily GH in
terms of safety, efficacy, tolerability, and immunoge-
nicity. TransCon GH is designed to leverage the inherent
low immunogenicity of unmodified GH. In the prodrug
form, the carrier shields both the protein and the protein-
carrier interface. Following release from the prodrug,
unmodified GH has the same low immunogenic potential
as daily GH. In this study, no neutralizing anti–GH-
binding antibodies were detected in any subjects re-
ceiving TransCon GH. Only one subject developed a
low-titer, treatment-emergent, nonneutralizing anti–GH-
binding antibody response and yet had a subsequent
annualized HV above the cohort median. Overall, the
immunogenicity frequency and profile of TransCon GH
was similar to that of daily GH.

and insulin resistance, GHD causes abnormal body com-
position, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, low-grade chronic
inflammation, and, collectively, an increased risk of cardio-
vascular disease and mortality (11). Given the lipolytic effect
of GH, GH replacement results in a reduction in fat mass,
particularly in the abdomen (12). In our study, the mean BMI
SDS across TransCon GH cohorts was stable compared
with a moderate decrease in the Genotropin cohort; this
moderate BMI SDS decrease was observed in the setting of a
slightly higher mean BMI at baseline. Given TransCon GH’s
mechanism of action of releasing free GH, and because GH
and IGF-1 levels were comparable to Genotropin, careful
BMI monitoring over a longer TransCon GH treatment
period in a larger cohort of subjects with GHD is warranted.
Besides cardiac inflammation, children with GHD also
have reduced cardiac mass, impaired diastolic filling, and
reduced left ventricular response, which may be at least
partially reversed with GH (13). However, whereas GH
deficiency is problematic, so is GH excess. High endogenous

 GH levels can be deleterious, as demonstrated by the
pathologic states of both acromegalic cardiomyopathy and
acromegalic regurgitant valvular heart disease (13, 14). In a
study of young, healthy, adult volunteers who received high-
dose GH (0.06 mg/kg/d, i.e., twice the dose of Genotropin
used in this study) for four weeks, participants developed a
high cardiac output state with concentric left ventricular
remodeling (15). These subjects had high IGF-1 levels, as do
patients with acromegaly. Unlike some long-acting prod-
ucts associated with supraphysiological GH levels, TransCon
GH administration leads to both GH and IGF-1 levels
that are similar to those seen with daily GH at com-
parable weekly doses; many years of safety data have
been gathered on daily GH (16).
TransCon GH was effective; subjects achieved height
and annualized HV comparable to that of subjects re-
ceiving daily GH. At all three doses given for 26 weeks,
TransCon GH also outperformed the mean HV of 9.2 cm
in the first year that was observed among compliant (i.e.,
those taking six or more injections per week) prepubertal
children with idiopathic GHD in the Kabi Pharmacia
International Growth Study Database (17, 18). This
translates into a likelihood that children with GHD
treated with TransCon GH may reach their adult height
target as compared with those taking daily GH alter-
natives. Given that TransCon GH is administered
weekly—a more acceptable frequency for children and
adolescents with GHD—it stands to reason that when six
injections in a week are eliminated, and dosing follows an
easy-to-remember schedule, compliance may improve,
and optimal adult height is more likely to be achieved.
TransCon GH was well tolerated, which is not sur-
prising, given the similar GH and IGF-1 exposure
achieved with TransCon GH compared with daily GH.
Excursions above 2.0 IGF-1 SDSs across cohorts were
infrequent, which is an important finding, given that high
IGF-1 levels are associated with certain types of cancers
(19). Weekly TransCon GH administration allows cli-
nicians to titrate dosing on the basis of IGF-1 levels, with
the goal of maintaining the range at ,2.0 SDSs. It was
only in cohort 3, at the highest TransCon GH dosing, that
an IGF-1 SDS .3.0 was seen, and this occurred in only
one subject and was transient. These results are consistent
with daily GH excursions; in their study, Cohen et al. (20)
found that 30% of patients who received daily GH
conventionally dosed at 0.04 mg/kg/d (closest in dosing to
TransCon GH cohort 3 recipients) had IGF-1 levels
of .2.0 SDSs. Of note, rigorous IGF-1 measurements are
critical to GH dose titration. Because IGF-1 levels and
reference intervals vary from assay to assay, it is im-
portant to use consistent and well-controlled IGF-1
testing methodologies and the same assay at each pa-
tient follow-up visit (21).
This study had limitations. An approved long-acting
GH product with the same safety, efficacy, tolerability,
and immunogenicity as daily GH was not available as an
active comparator, making blinding impossible. The
sample size was small; only 40 subjects received TransCon
GH. However, despite the widely divergent prevalence
range cited in the literature of one in 3480 to one in
30,000 (22), childhood GHD is relatively uncommon;
a large sample size is not realistic. Finally, this study lasted

 only 26 weeks, a relatively short time in the overall
growth period of a child.
Overall, long-acting TransCon GH, conveniently dosed
with a milligram-to-milligram conversion to achieve doses
similar to those of commercially available daily GH
products, was comparable to Genotropin in terms of GH
and IGF-1 exposure, safety, and efficacy. The results of this
phase 2 study supported advancement of TransCon GH
into phase 3 development.
