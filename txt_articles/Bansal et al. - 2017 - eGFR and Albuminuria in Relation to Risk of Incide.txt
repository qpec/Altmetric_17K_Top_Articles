Abstract
Background and objectives The incidence of atrial fibrillation is high in ESRD, but limited data are available on the
incidence of atrial fibrillation across a broad range of kidney function. Thus, we examined the association of eGFR
and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio with risk of incident atrial fibrillation.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We meta-analyzed three prospective cohorts: the Jackson Heart
Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and the Cardiovascular Health Study. Cox regression models
were performed examining the association of eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio with incident atrial
fibrillation adjusting for demographics and comorbidity. In additional analyses, we adjusted for measures of
subclinical cardiovascular disease (by electrocardiogram and cardiac imaging) and interim heart failure and
myocardial infarction events.
Results In the meta-analyzed study population of 16,769 participants without prevalent atrial fibrillation, across
categories of decreasing eGFR (eGFR.90 [reference], 60–89, 45–59, 30–44, and ,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2), there
was a stepwise increase in the adjusted risk of incident atrial fibrillation: hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals)
were 1.00, 1.09 (0.97 to 1.24), 1.17 (1.00 to 1.38), 1.59 (1.28 to 1.98), and 2.03 (1.40 to 2.96), respectively. There was
a stepwise increase in the adjusted risk of incident atrial fibrillation across categories of increasing urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ,15 [reference], 15–29, 30–299, and $300 mg/g):
hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.00, 1.04 (0.83 to 1.30), 1.47 (1.20 to 1.79), and 1.76 (1.18 to 2.62),
respectively. The associations were consistent after adjustment for subclinical cardiovascular disease measures
and interim heart failure and myocardial infarction events.
Conclusions In this meta-analysis of three cohorts, reduced eGFR and elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
were significantly associated with greater risk of incident atrial fibrillation, highlighting the need for further
studies to understand mechanisms linking kidney disease with atrial fibrillation.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained
arrhythmia in the general population. The prevalence
of AF is particularly high among patients with kidney
disease, occurring in 7%–20% of those with ESRD on
dialysis, which is two- to threefold higher than in the
general population (1–3). The US Renal Data System
reports that the prevalence of AF has increased over
time among patients with ESRD (4).
Several studies (5–17) have reported a high incidence
and prevalence of AF among the larger population of
patients with CKD not yet requiring dialysis. One
recent study estimated the prevalence of AF to be 18%
in a multicenter cohort of participants with CKD (10).
An analysis of over 10,000 middle-aged and older
white and black participants from the Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study found a strong
graded association between lower eGFR and higher
urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) with risk of
incident AF (18). AF affects selection of cardiovascu-
lar (CV) therapies (19) and is associated with poor
outcomes (20,21); thus, better characterization of risk
factors for incident AF is important.
Prior studies of kidney function in relation to AF
risk have notable limitations. Most general population
studies have not been adequately powered to examine
persons with CKD. Other studies have estimated GFR
using only serum creatinine rather than the more
accurate combined serum creatinine and cystatin
C equation (22). Furthermore, few studies have

 comprehensively examined whether the association of eGFR
with AF is modified by the extent of UACR and conversely,
whether the association of UACR with AF is modified by
eGFR. Most longitudinal studies have not accounted for the
contribution of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) or
interim CV events. It is well established that patients with
CKD are at higher risk of conduction abnormalities and
abnormal cardiac structure/function as well as events, such
as heart failure and myocardial infarction, which are impor-
tant risk factors for the development of AF. Finally, important
differences in risk of incident AF have been noted in particular
patient subgroups by demographics and comorbidity, which
have not been adequately addressed by prior studies (23).
To address these questions, we performed a meta-analysis
of three diverse community-based cohorts with a broad
range of kidney function (as determined by eGFR calculated
from serum creatinine and cystatin C) to examine the
associations of eGFR and UACR with risk of incident AF.
We hypothesized that there are strong, graded associations
of lower eGFR and higher UACR with risk of incident AF,
even after accounting for a broad range of confounders and
across subgroups by demographics and comorbidity.
Materials and Methods
Study Populations
Three community-based cohorts were included in this
analysis: the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Cardiovascu-
lar Health Study (CHS). Each site’s institutional review
board approved the study, and all participants provided
informed consent. For the meta-analysis, we included a
total of 16,769 participants from the three study cohorts
(Supplemental Figure 1).
The JHS is a community-based cohort study of blacks
designed to evaluate risk factors for CVD (24,25). Partic-
ipants (n=5306) ages 21–94 years old were recruited during
2000–2004 from the tricounty region (Hinds, Madison, and
Rankin) of metropolitan Jackson, Mississippi (26). For our
study, participants were excluded if they had prevalent AF
on study entry (n=67) or were missing baseline measures of
serum creatinine or cystatin C needed to calculate eGFR
(n=173). This left a final analytic sample of 5066 partici-
pants (Supplemental Figure 1).
The MESA is a community-based cohort study of clinical
and subclinical CVD (27). Between 2000 and 2002, the MESA
enrolled 6814 adults 45–84 years of age from six field centers
(New York and Bronx Counties, New York; Baltimore City
and County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina;
Chicago, Illinois; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Los Angeles,
California). Only individuals without known prevalent CVD,
defined as myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, transient
ischemic attack, heart failure, use of nitroglycerin, prior
angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replace-
ment, pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, or any
surgery on the heart or arteries, were eligible to participate.
For our study, participants were excluded if they had
prevalent AF on study entry (n=69), were missing baseline
measures of serum creatinine or cystatin C needed to cal-
culate eGFR (n=63), or had unavailable follow-up after the
baseline study visit (n=5). This left a final analytic sample of
6677 participants.
The CHS is a cohort study of older community-dwelling
adults ages 65 years old or older (28). Participants were re-
cruited from Health Care Financing Administration Medi-
care eligibility lists at four locations: Forsyth County, North
Carolina; Sacramento County, California; Washington County,
Maryland; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. An initial 5201 par-
ticipants were recruited between 1989 and 1990. An additional
687 black participants were added to the study in 1992 and 1993.
For our study, participants were excluded if they had prevalent
AF on study entry (n=162) or were missing baseline measures of
serum creatinine or cystatin C needed to calculate eGFR
(n=700). This left a final analytic sample of 5026 participants.
Exposures
For all three cohorts, eGFR was calculated from serum
concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C measured at baseline
using the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collab-
oration equation (22). CKD was defined as eGFR,60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2. In the JHS, serum creatinine was measured
using the Jaffe method (29). In the MESA, serum creatinine
was measured by rate reflectance spectrophotometry using
thin film adaptation of the creatine amidinohydrolase
method on the Vitros analyzer (Johnson & Johnson Clinical
Diagnostics Inc.). In the CHS, creatinine was measured
using a colorimetric method (Ektachem700; Eastman Kodak,
Rochester, NY) (30). In the JHS and the MESA, serum cystatin
C was measured by a particle-enhanced immunonephelo-
metric assay (N Latex Cystatin C; Siemens AG, Munich,
Germany). In the CHS, serum cystatin C was measured
using a BN II nephelometer (N Latex cystatin C; Dade
Behring, Munich, Germany) (31).
UACR was available at baseline in the JHS and the MESA.
In the JHS, UACR was obtained from either 24-hour urine
collections or spot urine samples at examination 1 (32,33). A
subset of participants (n=223) collected urine samples using
both methods. UACR was calculated for both sample types
and found to be highly correlated (r=0.97). Urine albumin was
measured by nephelometric immunoassay (Dade Behring)
and urine creatinine by the enzymatic Jaffe method. In the
MESA, urinary albumin concentration was determined from
spot urine samples by nephelometry using the Array 360 CE
Protein Analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc.). Urinary creat-
inine was measured from spot urine samples by the rate Jaffe
method using the Vitros 950IRC instrument (Johnson &
Johnson Clinical Diagnostics Inc.).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was incident AF (including atrial
flutter) in all three cohorts. Incident AF was identified
similarly in all three cohorts from any of three sources:
electrocardiograms (ECGs) performed at study visits, Inter-
national Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) codes from
hospitalization surveillance, and for participants enrolled in
fee-for-service Medicare, ICD-9 codes from Medicare inpatient
or outpatient claims (18,34–38). Participants were censored at
death, loss to follow-up, or last available study follow-up (the
JHS: December 31, 2012; the MESA: December 31, 2012; and
the CHS: June 30, 2014).
Covariates
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity)
and education level were determined by self-report. Diabetes

 was defined as fasting glucose $126 mg/dl or use of oral
hypoglycemic medications or insulin. Information on tobacco
use was collected from self-report (never, former, or current).
Physical examination measures (height, weight, and BP) were
obtained at the baseline study visit. Medication use was
determined by medication inventory and recorded by study
personnel.
History of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke
on study entry were determined by self-report (the CHS and
the JHS) and review of prior medical records for confirmation
(the CHS only). The MESA did not include participants with
prior CVD. Clinically recognized heart failure and myocar-
dial infarction that occurred during follow-up were captured
by study visits and/or telephone interviews with participants
and their kin. During these regular contacts, interim health
events, including diagnostic tests, new diagnoses, hospital-
izations, and death, were ascertained. Information on events
in each of the three cohorts triggered review of ICD-9 Clinical
Modification diagnosis codes, procedure codes, discharge
summaries, and medical records.
Subclinical CV measures (left ventricular mass, left ven-
tricular ejection fraction, and PR interval duration) obtained
by echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), or ECG were included. In the JHS, echocardiograms
were performed at examination 1 by certified ultrasonog-
raphy technicians. The calculation of left ventricular mass
and left ventricular ejection fraction has been previously
described (32). Both variables were reported as continuous
variables. In the MESA, cardiac MRI was performed at
baseline and quantified centrally at a single reading center
(39). Cardiac MRI was performed with 1.5-T magnets with
determination of left ventricular mass and left ventricular
ejection fraction as previously described (39,40). Both were
reported as continuous variables. In the CHS, echocardio-
grams were performed at baseline. Methods for quantifi-
cation of left ventricular mass (continuous) and left
ventricular ejection fraction (reported as normal, borderline,
or abnormal) have been previously described (41,42). For all
three cohorts, baseline ECGs were performed using stan-
dardized methods, and PR duration was quantified.
Statistical Methods
We compared participant characteristics across each of the
study cohorts by the presence or absence at baseline of CKD
defined as eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or microalbumi-
nuria (UACR$30 mg/g). Measures of baseline UACR were
available only in the JHS and the MESA.
We then calculated the unadjusted incidence rates of AF in
each cohort (per 1000 person-years) overall and by eGFR
level (,60 and $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and UACR level
(,30 versus $30 mg/g). Kaplan–Meier curves were gener-
ated to examine the cumulative AF-free survival in each
cohort in participants stratified by eGFR and UACR cate-
gories. Log rank tests were performed to statistically compare
the curves within each cohort. Penalized regression splines
were generated to examine the functional form of the
associations of eGFR and UACR with risk of incident AF in
each cohort and confirmed linear associations for each
(Supplemental Figure 2).
Participants were censored at death, loss to follow-up, or
last available study follow-up. For analyses examining the
adjusted association of eGFR with incident AF, we first
modeled associations within each cohort using a Cox
proportional hazards model. For these analyses, eGFR was
modeled continuously (per 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 lower
eGFR) as well as in categories ($90, 60–89, 45–59, 30–44,
and ,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2) per the Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes guidelines (43). We per-
formed a series of nested models adjusting for possible
confounders. Model 1 adjusted for age, age2 (to account for
the large range of ages in the study population), sex, race/
ethnicity, education (high school, some college, or college),
height, weight, current smoking, and history of diabetes.
Model 2 adjusted for variables in model 1 plus history of
baseline of heart failure (the JHS and the CHS only),
myocardial infarction (the JHS and the CHS only), and
stroke (the JHS and the CHS only); systolic BP; diastolic BP;
and use of antihypertensive medication use. The resulting
cohort-specific estimates of association were combined
using a fixed effects meta-analysis. For each model 2, we
formally assessed the heterogeneity present in our meta-
analysis using Cochran heterogeneity statistic and I2, which
quantifies the degree of inconsistency in the individual
studies’ results (44).
We used a similar approach to test the association of
UACR with risk of incident AF in a meta-analysis of data
from the JHS and the MESA. UACR was modeled contin-
uously (per doubling calculated by taking the log2) as well as
in clinically based categories: ,15, 15–29, 30–299, and $300
mg/g.
We tested the proportional hazards assumption in unad-
justed and adjusted (model 2) models. We found a violation of
the assumption in unadjusted models testing the association
of eGFR with incident AF in the JHS (P=0.05) and the CHS
(P=0.007) but not in the MESA (P=0.25). There was no
violation of the assumption in the models that tested the
association of UACR with incident AF in the JHS and the
MESA. In response, we examined Schoenfeld residual plots
and accordingly, chose a cutoff of 5 years on the basis of
when the risk of AF across time seemed to differ. We then
performed a sensitivity analysis truncating follow-up time
to 11 years and allowing for differing risks during years 0–5
and years 5–11 in the meta-analyzed study population.
In secondary analyses, we performed stratified analyses
in prespecified subgroups: age (,65 and $65 years old),
sex, race/ethnicity (white or black; Hispanic and Chinese
MESA participants were excluded from this analysis), base-
line prevalent CVD (yes/no; defined as prevalent heart
failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke), baseline prevalent
diabetes, the alternative measure of kidney function (eGFR or
UACR), and study cohort. We tested for the multiplicative
interactions and included the main effect of the covariate of
interest in these models.
A primary goal of this analysis was to characterize
the interaction between eGFR and UACR on the risk of
incident AF. In addition to the stratified analyses examin-
ing the relative risk of incident AF across combinations
of eGFR and UACR categories, we also examined differ-
ences in adjusted incidence rates in participants with
(1) eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2and UACR,30 mg/g,
(2) eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR$30 mg/g,
(3) eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR,30 mg/g, and
(4) eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR$30 mg/g. We
tested for the additive interaction in these models where we
1388
Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 estimated the hazard ratio for categories 2–4 compared with
category 1. If the excess relative risk for participants in group
4 is greater than those for participants in groups 2 and 3
added together, it suggests departure from additivity, in-
dicating possible biologic interaction between UACR and
eGFR.
We performed two sensitivity analyses. The first adjusted
for cardiac imaging and electrocardiographic measures (left
ventricular mass, left ventricular ejection fraction, and PR
duration). The second adjusted for new diagnoses of heart
failure and myocardial infarction that were made after
baseline but before or at the same time as the AF diagnosis.
This analysis only included the MESA and the CHS, because
the JHS did not collect data on heart failure events until
5 years after the baseline visit.
Missing covariates were handled through multiple im-
putation. There was a large degree of missingness in sub-
clinical CV measures included in model 3 (in the JHS, n=1818;
in the MESA, n=1798; and in the CHS, n=2180). Most of the
missingness in all three cohorts was seen with the left
ventricular mass variables (particularly in blacks in the CHS
due to the timing of the echocardiogram). A much smaller
degree of missingness (,3%) was present for other covariates
in each cohort. All subjects’ values were multiply imputed
using chained equations (45), which were then combined
using Rubin rules to account for the variability in the
imputation procedure (46).
All analyses were conducted using R 3.3.0; a two-sided
P value of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant for
all analyses.
Results
Study Population
Overall, there were 251 (5%) participants with
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the JHS, 554 (8%)
participants with eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the
MESA, and 1467 (29%) participants with eGFR,60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 in the CHS. Participants with eGFR,60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 were older, had higher BP, were more likely to
be taking antihypertensive medications, and had a higher
burden of comorbidity compared with participants without
CKD across all three cohorts (Table 1). Similarly, in the JHS
and the MESA, participants with higher UACR were older,
had higher BP, were more likely to be taking renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, were more likely
to have diabetes, and had lower eGFR compared with
participants with lower UACR (Supplemental Table 1).
Incidence Rates of AF in Each Cohort
In the JHS, there were 361 deaths and 238 incident AF
events over a mean follow-up time of 8.5 (SD=2.7) years
(overall incidence rate of AF was 5.5 per 1000 person-years).
In the MESA, there were 503 deaths and 720 incident AF
events over a mean follow-up time of 10 (SD=3.0) years
(overall incidence rate of AF was 10.8 per 1000 person-years).
In the CHS, there were 2829 deaths and 1569 incident AF
events over a mean follow-up time of 12.5 (SD=7.1) years
(overall incidence rate of AF was 25 per 1000 person-years).
In all three cohorts, the unadjusted incidence rates for AF (per
1000 person-years) were significantly higher in participants
with eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.72 m2 versus $60 ml/min per
1.73 m2: 15.9 versus 5.1 in the JHS, 28.4 versus 9.5 in the
MESA, and 33.6 versus 22.5 in the CHS. Similarly, unadjusted
incidence rates for AF were higher in those with UACR$30
mg/g compared with ,30 mg/g in the JHS (12.6 versus 4.3
per 1000 person-years) and the MESA (22.1 versus 9.8 per
1000 person-years). Kaplan–Meier curves for each cohort
showed a significant difference in the unadjusted cumulative
AF-free survival in participants with eGFR,60 versus $60
ml/min per 1.73 m2 as well as participants with UACR$30
versus ,30 mg/g (log rank test P,0.001 for all cohorts)
(Figure 1).
Association of eGFR with Incident AF
In the JHS, participants with eGFR,45 ml/min per
1.73 m2 had greater risk of incident AF, although there were
few participants in the lowest eGFR category (Supplemen-
tal Table 2). In the MESA and the CHS, there was a graded
association of lower eGFR categories with risk of incident
AF (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). We observed low hetero-
geneity across the three study cohorts (I2=0% for model 2). In
the meta-analyzed study population, there was a stepwise
increase in risk of incident AF across a broad range of eGFR
categories (Table 2). In adjusted models, compared with
eGFR$90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the risk of incident of AF was
significantly greater among participants with eGFR,60 ml/
min per 1.73 m2, with the greatest risk among participants
with eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 2.03; 95%
confidence interval, 1.40 to 2.96) (Table 2).
As a sensitivity analysis to address the violation in the
test for proportional hazards, we stratified follow-up time
as 0–5 and 5–11 years in each cohort. In these analyses, the
adjusted associations of categorical and continuous eGFR
with incident AF were stronger when the follow-up time
was 0–5 versus 5–11 years (Supplemental Table 5).
Association of UACR with Incident AF
In the JHS, the associations of UACR with incident AF
were similar across UACR categories (Supplemental Table
2). In the MESA, there was a stepwise association of higher
UACR with risk of incident AF (Supplemental Table 3). We
observed low heterogeneity across the two cohorts
(I2=9.9% for model 2). In the meta-analyzed study pop-
ulation of the JHS and the MESA, there was a stepwise
association between higher UACR and risk of incident AF,
with the greatest risk among participants with UACR$300
mg/g (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to
2.62) compared with those with UACR,15 mg/g (Table 2).
As conducted above for eGFR, a sensitivity analysis to
address the violation in the test for proportional hazards
was conducted for UACR. In these analyses, the adjusted
associations of categorical and continuous UACR with in-
cident AF were stronger when the follow-up time was 0–5
versus 5–11 years (Supplemental Table 5).
Stratified Analyses across Participant Subgroups
We tested the adjusted association of eGFR and UACR
with risk of incident AF in analyses stratified by age, sex,
race, prevalent CVD, prevalent diabetes, alternative kidney
measure (eGFR or UACR), and study cohort. The as-
sociations of eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (versus
$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) with incident AF were relatively

 consistent across all subgroups (although some subgroup
analyses had wide confidence intervals) (Figure 2A). Tests
for multiplicative interaction revealed a statistically signif-
icant interaction of eGFR with sex (P=0.01), with greater risk
among men. The multiplicative interaction of eGFR with
UACR was not statistically significant.
In stratified analyses, the associations between
UACR$30 mg/g (versus ,30 mg/g) and incident AF were
also consistent across all subgroups (Figure 2B). However,
the association did not reach statistical significance in
participants with prevalent CVD, perhaps due to small
sample sizes (Figure 2B). The P values for multiplicative
interaction were not statistically significant across these
subgroups.
Incidence Rates of AF across eGFR and UACR Categories
In addition to examining the relative risk of incident AF
across eGFR and UACR categories, we also studied the
adjusted incidence rates of AF across four categories of
eGFR and UACR (Figure 3). The adjusted incidence rate of
AF in participants with eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and
UACR,30 mg/g was 4.13 (95% confidence interval, 3.64 to
4.63) per 1000 person-years. Participants with either
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with UACR,30 mg/g
(5.01; 95% confidence interval, 3.78 to 6.25 per 1000 person-
years) or UACR$30 mg/g with eGFR$60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 (5.54; 95% confidence interval, 4.27 to 6.81 per 1000
person-years) had comparable adjusted incidence rates for
AF. Finally, the adjusted incidence rate for those with
eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR$30 mg/g was
7.21 (95% confidence interval, 4.84 to 9.58) per 1000 person-
years (Figure 3). The P value for the additive interaction
was not statistically significant (P=0.58).
Sensitivity Analyses: Adjustment for Cardiac Imaging/ECG
Measures and Interim/Concurrent Heart Failure and
Myocardial Infarction Events
In the meta-analyzed population of all three cohorts,
when models were further adjusted for subclinical CV mea-
sures (left ventricular mass, left ventricular ejection fraction, and
PR duration), associations were mildly attenuated, but overall
findings were similar to the main analysis (Supplemental
Table 6).
To understand the contribution of interim CV events to
risk of subsequent AF among those with low eGFR or high
UACR, we adjusted for interim/concurrent heart failure
and myocardial infarction events in the meta-analyzed
study population, which consisted of the CHS and the
MESA. In total, there were 84 interim/concurrent heart
failure and myocardial events in the MESA and 570
interim/concurrent heart failure and myocardial events
in the CHS. With this adjustment, the association of low
eGFR and high UACR remained materially unchanged
(Supplemental Table 7).

 Discussion
In this meta-analysis of data from nearly 17,000 diverse
participants from three community-based cohorts, we
found a strong stepwise association with incident AF for
both reduced eGFR and elevated UACR. The associations
were robust, even with adjustment for subclinical CV mea-
sures and interim CV events. Our study extends findings
from prior studies by examining a large, multicenter, di-
verse patient population; using finer categories of eGFR
(43); examining the association with incident AF across a
more comprehensive range of eGFR (including participants
without clinical CKD with eGFR.60 ml/min per 1.73 m2);
and using the more recent combined cystatin C-creatinine
eGFR equation to more accurately characterize levels of
kidney function (22). Our findings provide further conclu-
sive evidence that abnormal markers of kidney function are
significant risk factors for the development of AF.
In our study, eGFR,60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was sig-
nificantly associated with greater risk of incident AF, and
there was a stepwise increase in risk of AF with lower eGFR
and progressive worsening of CKD categories. The risk
of incident AF was particularly large in the CHS, a cohort
of older participants with higher burden of comorbidity.
These findings are consistent with prior literature (13,16,17,47).
In the ARIC Study, Alonso et al. (18) reported a strong graded
association between cystatin C–based eGFR and incident
AF, with risk estimates similar to our risk estimates. The
associations in the ARIC Study analysis were less robust
when using creatinine-based eGFR. Notably, some JHS
participants are also ARIC Study participants; thus, n=1626
individuals were included in both the ARIC Study analysis
and this analysis. Our analyses extended this prior work by
using the more accurate combined creatinine-cystatin C
equation to define eGFR, examining a more racially/ethnically
diverse population, and adjusting for a wide range of
covariates, including cardiac imaging measures. In the CHS,
investigators reported significant associations of elevations
in cystatin C with risk of incident AF in unadjusted models,
which were attenuated with multivariable adjustment (35).
This analysis differs from the previous CHS analysis, in that
we used eGFR from both creatinine and cystatin C, started
the follow-up period from baseline in the CHS, and had
both a longer follow-up time and a greater event rate.

 UACR is an important potentially modifiable measure of
kidney function and has been linked with poor CV out-
comes and death in populations with and without CKD
(48–50). We found that UACR.30 mg/g was significantly
associated with greater risk of incident AF. A few prior
studies have examined the association of UACR and risk
of incident AF. In the ARIC Study, participants with
UACR.30 mg/g had a twofold higher risk of incident AF
(18). In studies of older adults (6) and patients with type 2
diabetes (7), albuminuria has been linked with incident AF
(12,51). Our study extends and confirms these prior analyses by
studying a more diverse and larger study population.
Notably, in our study, we did not find a multiplicative
interaction of eGFR with UACR. This is consistent with the
ARIC Study, which did not find a significant interaction
between eGFR and UACR (18). We also did not find a
significant additive interaction between UACR and eGFR
with risk of incident AF, which suggests that the associ-
ation of high UACR and low eGFR with incident AF in
combination is not greater than that of either marker alone.
In this study, the observed associations were robust, even
with adjustment for subclinical CVD, suggesting that the
association of abnormal measures of kidney function with
incident AF is, in part, independent of cardiac structural
and conduction abnormalities. Studies have reported that
abnormal cardiac structure and function as well as con-
duction delays are associated with increased risk of AF (52–
57). The analysis in the ARIC Study also adjusted for ECG
measures and found an independent association of eGFR
and UACR with incident AF. However, we were able to
adjust for left ventricular mass, an important risk factor and
confounder, as ascertained from high-quality research
echocardiograms and cardiac MRIs. It is interesting that,
although somewhat attenuated, the findings did not
materially differ from the main analyses, suggesting that
presence of subclinical CVD in patients with CKD does not
entirely account for the observed associations.
With adjustment for interim heart failure and myocar-
dial infarction, the associations between lower eGFR and
higher UACR remained strong. Clinical CVD is a known
risk factor for development of AF (58), and patients with
CKD have greater risk of heart failure and myocardial
infarction compared with those without CKD (59).
Several possible mechanisms may explain the link be-
tween kidney dysfunction and risk of incident AF beyond
traditional CV risk factors. Myocardial fibrosis is a well
established feature of AF and also linked to impaired kidney
function (60–62). Cardiac inflammation is a key driver of AF.
Animal models and human studies have shown a strong link
between inflammation and left atrial fibrosis in CKD (63,64).
Patients with kidney dysfunction are more likely to have
abnormalities of electrolytes, which may contribute to the risk
of AF (65). Disorders of mineral metabolism, manifest by
altered levels of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, parathyroid
hormone, and fibroblast growth factor-23, are common in
CKD and linked to AF. Animal models have shown that the
sodium-calcium exchanger and calcium handling in the
cardiomyocyte is altered in CKD and may lead to electro-
physiologic dysfunction and AF (66). Clinical studies have
identified elevated phosphorus (67) and low 25(OH)D (68) as
risk factors for AF (67). In the MESA, baseline measures of and
fibroblast growth factor-23 were associated with incident AF
(69). Subclinical volume overload may also lead to cardiac
stretch and thus, be a risk factor for AF in patients with
CKD. Further study of novel therapies to treat CKD-specific
AF risk factors may help prevent AF and its associated
complications.
The findings of this study have important clinical impli-
cations. Our data suggest that patients with kidney disease,
as defined by either reduced eGFR or elevated UACR, are a
high risk for AF and may identify a population that would
benefit from targeted AF prevention therapies. Specifically,
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors have been
shown in some settings to reduce risk of incident AF (70–72).
Novel therapies, such as antioxidants, are also promising
(73). Studies are needed to test the efficacy of AF prevention
therapies in patients with kidney disease.
Our study had several strengths. We studied three diverse
community-based patient populations. GFR was estimated
using both serum creatinine and cystatin C. AF ascertainment
was standardized in each of the three cohorts. We were able to
account for important confounders, including antihyper-
tensive medication use and subclinical measures of CVD. We
recognize a few limitations as well. Measures of serum
creatinine and cystatin C were not performed using the
same assay across all three study cohorts, which may have
introduced error in our quantification of eGFR. Ascertainment
of AF relied, in part, on administrative codes, which are
imperfect. However, prior work has shown reasonable validity
with this approach, with a reported positive predictive value of
77% (74). Increased left atrial diameter and inferior vena cava
diameter, risk factors for AF, were not systematically quanti-
fied in all three cohorts and therefore, could not be included as
mediating factors. Measures of left ventricular mass and left
ventricular ejection fraction were ascertained by echocardio-
grams in the CHS and the JHS but cardiac MRI in the MESA,
which may have led to some differences in the quantification of
these parameters. The study design was observational, and
therefore, we cannot establish a causal relationship. Finally,
although we adjusted for a large number of possible con-
founders, there is still the potential for residual confounding.
In conclusion, in this large meta-analysis of data from
three diverse community-based cohorts with a broad range
of kidney function, we found that eGFR,60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 and UACR $30 mg/g were significantly associated
with greater risk of incident AF. These associations were
consistent across patient subgroups and after accounting
for numerous possible confounders, including presence of
subclinical CVD and clinical CV events. These data high-
light the need for further studies to examine the mecha-
nistic link between kidney disease and AF.
