Treating hospital patient textiles with ionic silver after each washing results in a significant decrease in
microbial contamination. Although further study is needed to better understand the role textiles play in
hospital-acquired infections and to quantify the influence of silver textile treatment on health care-
associated infection risk and patient outcomes, ionic silver treatment of textiles may prove useful in hospital-
acquired infection reduction strategies.

Textiles have been implicated in hospital outbreaks of fungal and
bacterial pathogens.1-4 The use of antimicrobial silver and copper
in hospital textiles may mitigate the risk of hospital-acquired in-
fections (HAIs). Silver kills bacteria by interacting with microbial
proteins.5 We evaluated the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver-
based textile treatment (SilvaClean, Applied Silver, Hayward, CA
[Environmental Protection Agency No. 90335-1]) that treats tex-
tiles with ionic silver after each washing.
METHODS
The study was conducted at 3 community hospitals sharing an
accredited laundry facility. After washing, textiles were treated with
SilvaClean in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency label
directions for use to provide 1.3-14 mg silver per kilogram textile.
Gowns and bottom sheets were sampled with contact plates con-
taining 3 media types (ie, all aerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus
specific, and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA] specific) pre- and
postpatient use before and after silver treatment was initiated at
the laundry facility. The onsite study team sampled a random se-
lection of textiles from storage carts before patient use and from
vacated hospital rooms after patient use. Two samples were col-
lected from each textile: upper and lower areas on centerline of
bottom fitted sheets and areas corresponding to center chest and
suprapubic area of gowns.
Contact plates were incubated for 24 hours aerobically at 37°C,
total colony forming units per plate were enumerated, and the 2 sam-
pling sites were averaged to obtain a single measure for each textile.
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare means in each
group and Fisher exact tests were used to compare the propor-
tions of textiles with bacteria isolated. Mixed-effects logistic models
were used to control for different hospital sites and wards.
RESULTS
A total of 1,912 gowns and 2,074 sheets were included in the
analysis. There was an 89% reduction in total aerobic bacterial colo-
nies after silver treatment on prepatient-use gowns (P < .0001) and
an 88% reduction on prepatient-use sheets (P < .0001). Among
postpatient-use samples, there was a 45% reduction on gowns
(P < .0001) and a 30% reduction on sheets (P = .0001) (Fig 1A). In
Staphylococcus aureus cultures (Fig 1B), there was a 100% reduc-
tion in both prepatient-use gowns and sheets (P < .0001 and P = .0009,
respectively), and an 89% and 74% reduction in postpatient-use
gowns and sheets (P < .0001 in both cases). The average colony counts
of MRSA (Fig 1C) were lower than colony counts on nonselective
aerobic plates and the more general S aureus plates. Nevertheless,

 Fig 1. Average colony forming units per plate for (A) total aerobic bacterial colonies, (B) Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) colonies, and (C) methicillin-resistant S aureus
(MSRA) colonies before (control) and after silver application. Number of textiles per group and the percentage of cultures positive (having at least 1 colony) is shown below
columns. Plates had a surface area of 28.27 cm2. Colony counts > 300 (not clearly differentiated by counters) were recorded as 300 CFU/plate. Colony counts > 300 were
seen on aerobic plates in 4% of postpatient-use gowns and 1% of postpatient-use sheets, but in <1% of all other groups. Three types of culture media were used: nonselec-
tive tryptic soy agar (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) for total aerobic colony counts, Baird-Parker–based agar (Hardy Diagnostics) to quantify S aureus, and CHROM
MRSA agar (Hardy Diagnostics) to quantify MRSA. A random number generator was used to ensure that approximately 20% of total samples would be on selective media
(10% S aureus and 10% MRSA). Control groups included samples collected by the onsite study team between August 24, 2015, and September 18, 2015. Silver was intro-
duced into the laundering process on December 8, 2015. Treatment groups include samples collected between December 14, 2015, and January 4, 2016.

 MRSA colonies isolated per plate decreased after silver treatment,
with a 97% and 100% reduction in prepatient-use gowns and sheets
(P = .0002 and P = .09, respectively), and a 100% and 80% reduction
in postpatient-use gowns and sheets (P = .0001 and P = .14,
respectively).
Silver treatment was associated with fewer positive cultures
(Fig 1). The proportion of cultures with at least 1 aerobic colony fell
from 93% (432 out of 466) to 72% (330 out of 459) after silver treat-
ment in prepatient-use gowns (Fisher exact test P < .0001). The
proportion of prepatient-use gowns from which at least 1 colony
of S aureus was isolated fell from 53% (28 out of 53) to 0% (0 out of
45; P < .0001) after silver treatment and from 83% (29 out of 35)
to 48% (23 out of 48; P = .001) in postpatient-use gowns. The pro-
portion of sheets with at least 1 colony of S aureus decreased from
23% (5 out of 22) to 0% (0 out of 46; P = .002) in the prepatient-
use group and from 84% (38 out of 45) to 53% (32 out of 60; P = .0008)
in the postpatient-use group.
In mixed-effects logistic models controlling for hospital site clus-
tering (Table 1), the presence of silver was associated with decreased
isolation of total aerobic bacteria, S aureus, and MRSA. Bacteria were
more likely to be isolated after textile use: identification of any
aerobic colony was 9 times higher after use and identification of S
aureus was 12 times higher after use. Isolation of aerobic colonies
was more likely on gowns (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.5-
2.3). Although textiles in critical care areas appeared to be more likely
to have aerobic colonies isolated in the unadjusted model, this factor
did not improve model fit in the fully adjusted model. S aureus was
more likely to be isolated on textiles in critical care settings (ad-
justed odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.8). In the best-fit multivariable
mixed-effects logistic model for isolation of MRSA, only the pres-
ence or absence of silver was predictive of MRSA isolation.
DISCUSSION
The levels of bacteria identified on clean laundry in our study
are consistent with other studies, suggesting that this is a general
problem in health care settings.1,6 As would be expected, textiles
sampled postpatient use had increased bacterial contamination, con-
sistent with the transfer of the patient’
s colonizing bacteria to textiles.
The reduction in bacterial contamination with silver in postpatient-
use textiles indicates that silver treatment continues to reduce
bacteria, including S aureus, over the extent of the patient’
s hospi-
talization. The low prevalence of MRSA at the study sites limited
our ability to draw statistically significant conclusions regarding re-
ductions in MRSA contamination. Our results show a trend toward
decreased MRSA isolation in both sheets and gowns after silver ap-
plication, but this reduction was statistically significant only on
gowns.
The level of bacterial contamination on textiles that increases
the risk of HAIs is not known.7 Studies on hard surface environ-
mental contamination have used < 2.5 CFU/cm2 aerobic colonies and
< 1 CFU/cm2 for specific indicator organisms, including S aureus (cor-
responding to < 70.6 CFU/plate and 28.2 CFU/plate in this study).7,8
It is not clear that acceptable levels for contamination on hard sur-
faces can be extended to sheets and gowns because textiles have
unique properties: they are always in contact with patients, have
large contacted surface areas, and can lead to bacterial aerosoliza-
tion. Despite questions of applicability, if these levels are applied
to textiles, postpatient-use gowns without silver exceeded cutoffs
for both total aerobic colony counts and S aureus isolation in our
study. Studies of copper-coated surfaces and textiles suggest that
the addition of the metal reduced HAIs.9,10 Although further studies
are needed, given successes with copper and reductions below the
hard surface cutoffs in this study, it is likely that silver textile treat-
ment would decrease HAIs.
