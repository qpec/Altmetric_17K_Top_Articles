ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the amount of sugars in fruit
juices, juice drinks and smoothies (FJJDS) marketed to
children.
Design: We surveyed the sugars content (per 100 ml
and standardised 200 ml portion) of all FJJDS sold by
seven major UK supermarkets (supermarket own and
branded products). Only products specifically marketed
towards children were included. We excluded sports
drinks, iced teas, sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks
and cordials as being not specifically marketed towards
children.
Results: We identified 203 fruit juices (n=21), juice
drinks (n=158) and smoothies (n=24) marketed to
children. Sugars content ranged from 0 to 16 g/
100 ml. The mean sugars content was 7.0 g/100 ml,
but among the 100% fruit juice category, it was
10.7 g/100 ml. Smoothies (13.0 g/100 ml) contained
the highest amounts of sugars and juice drinks (5.6 g/
100 ml) contained the lowest amount. 117 of the 203
FJJDS surveyed would receive a Food Standards
Agency ‘red’ colour-coded label for sugars per
standardised 200 ml serving. Only 63 FJJDS would
receive a ‘green’ colour-coded label. 85 products
contained at least 19 g of sugars—a child’s entire
maximum daily amount of sugars. 57 products
contained sugar (sucrose), 65 contained non-caloric
sweeteners and five contained both. Seven products
contained glucose-fructose syrup.
Conclusions: The sugars content in FJJDS marketed
to children in the UK is unacceptably high.
Manufacturers must stop adding unnecessary sugars
and calories to their FJJDS.
INTRODUCTION
Free sugars are the most important dietary
cause of dental caries.1 2 When consumed as
a drink, fructose derived from fruit is as
likely to cause dental caries as all other
sugars.3 In the 2012 Children’s Local Dental
Health Survey, 28% of children aged 5 years
in
England
had
obvious
decay
in
their
primary teeth, rising to 35% of children
aged 5 years in the North West.4 In 2013,
12% of children aged 3 years had experi-
enced obvious dental decay.5 Dental decay is
the most common reason for children in
England
being
admitted
to
hospital.6
Furthermore, an increased intake of fructose
and sugar-sweetened drinks has been asso-
ciated with childhood obesity.7 8
‘Free
sugars’
refer
to
monosaccharides
(such as glucose, fructose) and disaccharides
(such as sucrose or table sugar) added to
foods and drinks by the manufacturer, cook
or consumer, and sugars naturally present in
honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice con-
centrates.9 It is a term used to distinguish
between the sugars that are naturally present
in fully unrefined carbohydrates such as fruit.
Consumption of free sugars, particularly in
the
form
of
beverages,
can
lead
to an
increase in total sugars intake and a reduc-
tion in the consumption of more nutrition-
ally
valuable
food,
thus
leading
to
an
unhealthy diet, increased weight and risk of
non-communicable diseases.10–12 Most recent
figures
show
one
in
five
children
aged
4–5 years and one in three children aged
10–11 years
are
overweight
or
obese.6
Children who are overweight are more likely
to develop illnesses such as type 2 diabetes,13
have an increased likelihood of weight and
health problems in adolescence and are
more likely to become overweight or obese
adults.14
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ A comprehensive assessment of the sugars
content of fruit juice, juice drinks and smoothies
(FJJDS) marketed to children.
▪ Assessment of standard portion size (200 ml)
provided actual amount of sugars contained.
▪ Only FJJDS available at supermarket chains were
recorded.
▪ New varieties of FJJDS appear in the market
steadily and may be different.

 Children aged between 4 and 10 years are now getting
30% of their sugars intake from soft drinks.15 In a
recent survey of people’s perception of sugars in drinks,
the sugars content of fruit juices and smoothies was
underestimated by 48% on average, whereas the sugars
content of carbonated drinks was overestimated by
12%.16 Therefore, it is not surprising that the role of
sugar-sweetened drinks and fruit juices in the increase
in caries and obesity has recently been at the forefront
of public debate.17 Furthermore, there is increasing
public
awareness
of
the
negative
impact
of
sugar-sweetened drinks on children’s health.18 As a
result, parents may replace sugar-sweetened carbonated
drinks (that are perceived to be unhealthy) with fruit
juices, juice drinks and smoothies (FJJDS) (that are per-
ceived to be healthier). However, this can also have a
negative health impact if the sugars content of FJJDS is
equal to or higher than sugar-sweetened carbonated
drinks.
This study aimed to record the sugars content of
FJJDS marketed to children and determine which FJJDS
contain sugar (sucrose), syrups, non-caloric sweeteners
and free sugars derived from fruit.
Online supplementary appendix 1 provides definitions
for the various types of sugars referred to in this paper.
METHODS
This survey looked at sugars per 100 ml and per standar-
dised 200 ml portion of 203 soft FJJDS from seven super-
markets (Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer,
Waitrose, The Co-operative and Morrisons) in the UK.
FJJDS were identified by the definitions provided by the
British Soft Drinks Association (box 1).
Only products that were specifically marketed towards
children were included. Sugar-sweetened drinks, sports
drinks and iced teas were excluded. Cordials were also
excluded. Although cordials are marketed towards chil-
dren, they are not single-serve portions that were the
focus of this survey. Cordials should be diluted one part
cordial to nine parts water (with nutritional typical
values
shown
with
this
dilution);
however,
people
generally dilute to taste, so the sugar content of a single
serve would vary from person to person. Furthermore,
they are not suitable for lunchboxes.
Only single-portion cartons were recorded. This was
determined using the supermarkets’ online shopping
system and recording products under their children’s
FJJDS section—for example, ‘lunchbox and kids’. For
supermarkets with no online shopping, size and design
of packaging determined if the products were aimed
towards children. Some drinks manufacturers produce
products
specifically
designed
for
children—for
example, Tropicana Kids, only products in these ranges
were recorded. Both supermarket own and branded pro-
ducts were recorded.
Product sizes ranged from 65 to 500 ml and were
recalculated at 200 ml from the 100 ml data. Teaspoons
of sugar per standardised 200 ml portion (calculated
using 4 g of sugar per teaspoon)19 were converted into
teaspoons to help the researcher visualise the amount of
sugar. The ingredient list was recorded for the analysis
of sugar (sucrose), syrups, free sugars derived from fruit
and non-caloric sweeteners (table 1).
Data were retrieved online or in-store between July
and August 2014.
RESULTS
In total, 203 FJJDS were identified. Of the 203 products,
21 were fruit juices, 158 were juice drinks and 24 were
smoothies (table 2).
Of the 179 fruit juices and juice drinks, 60 contained
sugar (sucrose). Sugars content ranged from 0 to 16 g/
100 ml. The average sugars content was 7.0 g/100 ml,
but among the 100% fruit juice category, it was 10.7 g/
100 ml. In total 117 of the 203 FJJDS surveyed would
receive a Food Standards Agency (FSA) ‘red’ colour-

Fruit juice, juice drinks and smoothies as defined
by the British Soft Drinks Association
▸ Fruit juices are defined as, ‘100% pure juice made from the
flesh of fresh fruit or from whole fruit, depending on the type
used. It is not permitted to add sugars, sweeteners, preserva-
tives, flavourings or colourings to fruit juice’
▸ Juice drinks are ‘1% to 99% juice, nectars, still flavoured
waters, sports drinks and iced teas’.18a As neither sports
drinks or iced teas are marketed towards children, they were
not included in the survey
▸ Smoothies labelled as ‘fruit juice’ should not include any add-
itional ingredients and are subject to the same regulations as
fruit juice. Non-pure fruit smoothies may contain other ingredi-
ents such as yoghurt or milk, which must be labelled

 coded label for sugars for a 200 ml serving, and only 63
FJJDS would merit a ‘green’ colour-coded label.20
Large variations existed in sugars between different
types of FJJDS and within the same type of FJJDS. On
average, juice drinks contained the lowest amounts
(mean
5.6 g/100 ml)
and
smoothies
contained
the
highest (mean 13.0 g/100 ml).
Of the 158 juice drinks, 85 contained at least 19 g of
sugars—the child’s entire maximum daily amount of
free sugars.
A total of 60 products contained sugar (sucrose), 65
contained non-caloric sweeteners and 5 contained both.
The majority of products were sweetened with acesul-
fame K, sucralose and aspartame. Of the 78/203 pro-
ducts, 12 contained sugars and non-caloric sweeteners.
Of the 203 products, 7 contained glucose-fructose syrup.
A total of 140 products contained no sugars or non-
caloric sweeteners.

DISCUSSION
The World Health Assembly (WHA) recently adopted a
global
target
of
25%
relative
reduction
in
non-
communicable diseases by 2025.21 This includes policies
to reduce the content of sugars in non-alcoholic bev-
erages, as well as to reduce the impact of marketing of
non-alcoholic beverages high in sugars on children.21 In
the UK, a national childhood obesity prevention strategy
for England is expected in summer 2016. This is likely
to include measures to reduce the consumption of
sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks.22
Using a standardised 200 ml serving size, results from
this survey show 64% of FJJDS surveyed would contain at
least half of a young child’s maximum sugar intake for
the day (9.5 g), with 42% of products containing a full
days recommended sugars allowance (19 g for children
aged 4–6 years).23 Current guidelines state a 150 ml glass
of pure fruit juice at meal times counts as a maximum
of one of the ‘5 a Day’.24 However, Public Health
England is aiming to refresh the ‘5 a Day’ campaign,
including a reconsideration of the advice on fruit juice
and smoothies.25 This appears crucial, based on our
findings. Of the products included in this survey, only
five produced products at a 150 ml size. All other pro-
ducts exceeded the recommended serving size and are
likely to be consumed in a single seating as a single
portion, therefore greatly increasing the child’s sugars
intake.
Furthermore, the FSA thresholds relate to adult intake
of sugars; therefore, we can speculate that the number
of FJJDS with a ‘red’ colour code is an underestimation
and the number of FJJDS with a ‘green’ colour code is
an overestimation for children’s sugars consumption.20
WHO
recently
revised
guidelines
recommending
reducing total daily energy intake from free sugars
from
10%
to
below
5%.19
This
has
now
been
supported
by
the
government’s
Scientific
Advisory
Committee
on
Nutrition
(SACN).23
SACN
recom-
mends that the average population intake of free
sugars should not exceed 5% of total dietary energy
for age groups from 2 years upwards.23 This has been
endorsed by the UK government. For young children,
this 5% limit will represent a maximum of around
19 g/day (nearly five teaspoons of sugar).19 A recent
critical in-depth review goes further, recommending
that an intake below 2–3% is necessary to avoid dental
caries. The review suggests that an increase from near-
zero free sugars to 5% of energy intake doubles the
prevalence of caries in children.26 Figures from the
latest UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey data
show that in children aged 4–10 years, the average
intake of free sugars is 14.7% of total energy27—three-
fold higher than the new recommendations.
One key difference between whole fruit and juice is
fibre content. Whole fruit slows down consumption and
has a satiating effect.28 Research shows the body metabo-
lises fruit juice in a different way compared to whole
fruit. After whole fruit consumption, the body seems to
adjust
its
subsequent
energy
intake
appropriately,
whereas after fruit juice consumption, the body does not
compensate for the energy intake.29
We did not initially set out to record the number of
products containing non-caloric sweeteners. However, of
the 203 FJJDS included in our study, 78 contained non-
caloric sweeteners, the majority of which were sweetened
with acesulfame K, sucralose and aspartame. Although
all these non-caloric sweeteners have been declared safe
by the European Food Safety Authority,30 health experts
believe a reduction in the overall sweetness of products
is necessary in order for children’s taste to become less
accustomed to sweetness.31 Although replacing sugars
with
non-caloric
sweeteners
may
lead
to
improved
markers of long-term metabolic health and weight loss,
it will not necessarily provide a long-term solution to
reducing sugar consumption and subsequent health
problems.
All labels on products recorded contained a reference
intake, in line with European law.32 The reference
intake provides one figure, which applies to an average-
sized adult female doing an average amount of physical
activity.33 This figure is not appropriate for children who
have very different energy intake requirements and
energy expenditure. Furthermore, pure fruit juices are
labelled as Fruit Juice, while products with any other
added ingredients are known as Juice Drinks. With all
this in mind, it is fair to say that labelling of fruit juice
and juice drinks marketed towards children can be
unclear and thus potentially confusing for parents trying
to make healthier choices.
Study limitations
We acknowledge a number of limitations to this study.
First, only FJJDS available at supermarket chains were

 recorded, but there may be other products available to
the public in other smaller independent stores. Second,
new varieties of FJJDS appear in the market steadily and
may have different properties from those recorded.
Results, comparisons or conclusions drawn from this
survey can thus only apply to the products in this time
period ( July and August 2014). Third, we only focused
on sugars content and did not include an assessment of
the portion size of beverages marketed to children,
which could be considerably larger than the recom-
mended amount. Fourth, no lactose added to food or
drink is now considered as free sugars. However, in the
products where some milk was added, we could not
identify from the labelling what percentage came from
the lactose, therefore it was not excluded. Finally, the
study was based on sugars content data provided on the
available packaging labels in store on the dates of collec-
tion; hence, we relied on the accuracy of the data pro-
vided on the label. Therefore, it is assumed that the
manufacturers provide accurate and up-to-date informa-
tion in line with EU Regulations. However, future studies
should include free sugars determined through labora-
tory analysis to achieve a better understanding of the
true free sugars content. Nevertheless, the results of this
study are relevant and serve to document the sugar
content of FJJDS products sold in the UK supermarkets,
providing a foundation for future studies and evidence
for the sugar reduction programme and the soft drink
industry.
CONCLUSIONS
The sugars content in FJJDS marketed to children in the
UK is high. Over 40% of products surveyed contained at
least 19 g of sugars—a child’s entire maximum daily
amount of free sugars.
We suggest that FJJDS with high free sugars content
should not count as one of the UK government’s ‘5 a
Day’ recommendations. Ideally, fruit should be con-
sumed in its whole form, not as juice. Parents should
dilute fruit juice with water, opt for unsweetened juices
and only give them during meals. Portions should be
limited to 150 ml a day. In order to help combat the
growing problem of childhood obesity, manufacturers
need to stop adding unnecessary sugars and calories to
their FJJDS now; otherwise, it will be essential for the
government to introduce legislation to regulate the free
sugars content of these products.
