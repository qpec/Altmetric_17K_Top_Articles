BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In France, cannabis consumption is illegal. The health impact of 
its increasing use and higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations is still poorly 
documented, particularly that of unintentional pediatric intoxications. We sought to 
evaluate the French national trend of admissions for unintentional cannabis intoxication in 
children over an 11-year period (2004–2014).
METHODS: A retrospective, national, multicenter, observational study of a pediatric cohort. 
All children aged <6 years admitted to a tertiary-level pediatric emergency department 
(PED) for proven cannabis intoxication (compatible symptoms and positive toxicological 
screening results) during the reference period were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-four PEDs participated in our study; 235 children were included, and 71% 
of the patients were 18 months old or younger. Annual admissions increased by a factor of 
13. Hashish resin was the main form ingested (72%). During the study period, the evolution 
was characterized by a national increase in intoxications, younger intoxicated children 
(1.28 ± 0.4 vs 1.7 ± 0.7 years, P = .005), and more comas (n = 38) (P = .05, odds ratio 3.5 
[1.02–11.8]). Compared with other intoxications, other PED admissions, and the same age 
population, cannabis-related admissions were greater. There was a potential link between 
the increased incidence of comas and increased THC concentration in resin seized in France 
over the period.
CONCLUSIONS: Children are collateral victims of changing trends in cannabis use and a 
prevailing THC concentration. Intoxicated children are more frequent, are younger, and 
have intoxications that are more severe. This raises a real issue of public health.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: The outbreak of 
pediatric cannabis intoxication has been recently 
published in relation to decriminalization in several 
states in the United States. In France, consumption 
is illegal. Unintentional pediatric intoxications 
related to increasing use are poorly documented.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: In this national, 
retrospective, multicenter study, we included 
235 intoxications. During the 11-year period, the 
evolution of intoxications was significant for younger 
children, and an increase in severe presentations 
potentially correlated to the increase in cannabis 
resin potency.

 France, where cannabis is illegal, is 
the highest drug-consuming country 
in Europe.1 Users are mainly young 
adults and teenagers aged 15 to 16 
years old with rates of 22% and 39%, 
respectively. Among ninth graders, 
this rate was 24% among girls and 
28% among boys in 2014.2, 
 
3 Whereas 
the herbal cannabis market changes 
with increased French production, 
most cannabis resin is imported from 
Morocco via Spain by air or sea and 
moves through France toward the 
Netherlands and Northern Europe 
by road using “go fast or go slow” 
vehicles. The resin form has changed 
to smaller, olive-shaped pellets 
rather than traditional 250 g bars.1 
Another major change is increased 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 
concentrations in both marijuana and 
hashish (9.3% in 2004 and 20.7% 
in 2014 in France).4 The health 
impact of these trends remains 
poorly documented, particularly 
that of the evolution of unintentional 
intoxication in young children.
The primary objective was to analyze 
the national evolution of pediatric 
admissions for unintentional 
cannabis intoxication in the main 
French pediatric emergency 
departments (PEDs) over an 11-year 
period (2004–2014). The secondary 
objectives were to detail clinical 
presentations and analyze the 
evolution of severe intoxications 
(coma, respiratory depression, and 
apnea) and the resulting social and 
legal measures.

setting and study Participants
All children <6 years of age who 
were admitted with proven cannabis 
intoxication (compatible clinical 
symptoms and positive toxicological 
screening results) in a tertiary-level 
PED during the reference period 
were eligible. Compatible clinical 
symptoms that defined “intoxicated” 
children were any acute neurologic 
symptom(s) (eg, drowsiness, 
ataxia, hypo- or hypertonia, 
seizures, comatose status, altered 
consciousness, agitation, euphoria, 
and/or mydriasis) occurring in a 
previously healthy, afebrile toddler 
with no antecedents. Patients >6 
years of age, asymptomatic patients 
(those who were exposed but 
not intoxicated), and those with 
suspected but unproven cannabis 
intoxications were not included. 
Since 2000, French hospital medical 
records have progressively switched 
from paper charts to electronic 
records. Two-thirds of French 
hospitals have electronic medical 
records. Laboratory results are also 
electronically linked to medical

the study coordinator. The severity 
criteria were as follows: coma status 
(unarousable or unresponsive), 
seizures, respiratory failure (apneas 
and/or respiratory rate <10th 
percentile for age and/or tracheal 
intubation), hypotension (systolic 
blood pressure <fifth percentile for

and a Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) 
value of 3.5 To depict the evolution 
of unintentional pediatric cannabis 
intoxication, our data were compared 
with French poison control centers 
(PCCs) data concerning calls for 
cannabis exposure or intoxications (in 
symptomatic patients) and calls for 
other intoxications in the same age 
group.
statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, data were 
entered in Microsoft Excel tables 
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, 
WA). Analysis was performed with 
StatView 5.1 (SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary, NC) and EpiInfo 6.04fr (VF, 
ENSP-Epiconcept, Paris, France). 
In the descriptive analysis, data 
are presented as a mean ± SD, a 
median with extreme values, or 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
when appropriate unless otherwise 
indicated. To compare qualitative 
variables, a χ2 test (Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel) was used, and a 2-tailed 
Fisher’s exact test was used if 
the expected value was <5. For 
quantitative independent variables, 
a paired Student’s t test was applied. 
A nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis 
test was performed in cases of 
non-normal distribution. Statistical 
significance was considered at P < .05.

ResuLts
Descriptive analysis
Twenty-four PEDs (80% of national 
PEDs) in 20 French districts and 
21 regions took part in the study. 
During the study period, 235 children 
matching the inclusion criteria were 
admitted. Seventy-one percent were 
aged 18 months old or younger (Fig 1).  
 
Figure 2 illustrates the national 
geographical distribution of these 
admissions from 2004 to 2009 and 
2010 to 2014. The main demographic 
characteristics are summarized 
in Table 1 and compared between 
the 2 periods. Annual admissions 
increased by a factor of 13 over 11 
years (+133%). Between 2004 and 
2014, the number of severe cases 
increased by a factor of 20 and by a 
factor of 4 between 2013 and 2014. 
The estimated time of ingestion  
had a bimodal distribution with  
2 peaks (10:00 am–1:00 pm and  
06:00 pm–10:00 pm). The average delay 
between ingestion and admission 
was 4 hours 24 minutes ± 3 hours 
6 minutes. The main place of 
intoxication was the parental home 
(72%). Ingestion was the main route 
of intoxication (75%). Resin sticks, 
balls, and cones were the principal 
form ingested (72%), and the most 
frequent amount (80%) was 1 stick 
(average weight of 2–3 g) (data came 
from the French Office for Drugs and 
Drug Addiction) or 1 ball (average 
weight of 2–4 g). The clinical signs at 
admission are shown in Tables 2  
and 3 and were predominantly 
neurologic symptoms (86%). 
Eighty-three (35%) children had at 
least 1 severity criteria. Fifty-three 
percent of all children with comas 
were admitted during 2014 (Fig 3). 
Fourteen patients were diagnosed 
with respiratory failure, and 8 
required assisted ventilation for 24 
hours or less. Basic metabolic panel 
blood tests that were performed 
on 178 patients (76%) revealed 
abnormalities (n = 40). These 
included high blood sugar levels (n = 
14), hyponatremia (≤130 mmol/L)  
(n = 8), metabolic acidosis (n = 5), 
and functional kidney failure (n = 5).  
Additional procedures included the 
following: electrocardiograms  
(n = 63), head computed tomography 
scans (n = 39), abdominal 
ultrasounds (n = 39), lumbar 
puncture (n = 24), and EEGs (n = 24). 
In addition to cannabis detection, 
blood and/or urine toxicological 
screenings (for benzodiazepines, 
barbiturates, opiates, amphetamines, 
methamphetamine, cocaine, 
buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, 
methadone, codeine, lysergic acid 
diethylamide, ethanol, tricyclic 
antidepressants, paracetamol, 
and tramadol) were performed in 
205 cases. Eight other molecules 
were isolated in 8 children (4%) 
(Table 4). None of these patients 
required assisted ventilation. 
Paracetamol was allegedly being 
given to treat hyperthermia (n = 2). 
Benzodiazepines were detected in 
children who had received diazepam 
to stop seizures. Most of the children 
were hospitalized (88%), of whom 27 
were in a resuscitation unit or ICU. 
Parental cannabis consumption was 
indicated in 146 cases (62%), and 
72% declared to be regular users. 
Social or legal measures included 
a referral to CPS for 162 cases, a 
written report for special concern for 
39 children, 5 children were placed 
in foster care by court order, and 4 
families were subject to a complaint 
filed with a police department.

 95% CI 1.03–19.5). The comparison of 
PSS distribution (excluding patients 
with cointoxications) indicated more 
severe presentations (PSS 3) (18.5% 
vs 4.3%, OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.2–21.7,  
P = .02). When 2004 was compared 
with 2014, the average age of 
intoxicated patients revealed 
younger children (P = .005) (Table 1). 
 
The increase in intoxications and 
comas was compared with the 
concentration of THC in resin seized 
by French customs over the same 
period (Fig 3). Data were compared 
with cannabis-related calls and 
other toxic exposure-related calls (in 
symptomatic and nonsymptomatic 
patients) received by French PCCs 
during the same period. Patients 
included in this study represented 
84% of national cannabis-related 
calls for symptomatic children. 
Between 2004 and 2014, the rate 
for cannabis exposures in children 
aged <6 years progressed from 5.4 
to 15.4 per 10 000 toxic exposures. 
The number of cannabis-related 
calls to French PCCs increased 
by 312%, 8.3% for noncannabis 
exposures and 3.3% for the pediatric 
population younger than 6 years 
old between 2004 and 2014 in 
the same geographical areas (data 
came from the French National 
Institute of Statistics and Economic 
Studies). Compared with the French 
population of children <6 years 
old in 2004 and 2014, the overall 
national rate per capita for cannabis-
related calls progressed from 0.7 
to 3.6 per 100 000. Compared with 
PED admissions for children aged 
<6 years between 2004 and 2014, 
cannabis-related PED visits increased 
from 1.7 to 16.1 per 100 000 
admissions per year.
DIscussIOn
The evolution of unintentional 
pediatric cannabis intoxications is 
remarkable because of increased 
admissions throughout the 
country and an increase in severe 
presentations (Fig 3). Between 2004 
and 2014, the evolution of PED visits 
for cannabis intoxication in toddlers 
increased 133%, and cannabis 
exposure-related calls to French PCCs 
increased 312%. Calls for other toxic 
exposures increased by only 45%. 
The phenomenon was not related 
to an equivalent increase in the 
French pediatric population for the 
same age group. Between 2000 and 
2013, the evolution of similar calls to 
American PCCs showed a variation 
of 147% for pediatric exposure to 
cannabis.7 In France, Spadari et al6 
of the Marseille PCC raised an initial 
alert in 2009 when they reported 93 
calls for pediatric intoxications. They 
suspected a link between higher THC 
concentrations in cannabis products 
and more severe cases. Since this 
warning, 1 French series of 8 
pediatric intoxications was reported 
in 2015.9 Contrary to other European 
countries, hashish (resin) is the most 
popular cannabis form in France. 
Increased THC concentration in resin 
has been demonstrated and is related 
to a change in production. Cannabis 
hybrids that allow higher resin yields 
and THC content10, 
 
11 have replaced 
the traditional Moroccan plants. 
In France, Dujourdy and Besacier 
recently published that almost three-
quarters of records corresponded to 
a mean THC content >20% per gram 
(cannabis potency).12 European data 
on cannabis potency are based on 
forensic analysis of seized materials. 
This is not necessarily representative 
of the market, especially in countries 
with significant domestic cultivation 
(eg, the Netherlands).13 Detailed data 
on cannabis product potency have 
been studied in the Netherlands,

 the United Kingdom, France, the 
United States, 
14 and Australia.15 In 
the Netherlands, the THC content 
of resin is higher than herbal 
products of the same origin (local 
or imported), and Dutch products 
are more potent than imported ones 
(local resin 29.6% vs 14.3%).13, 
 
16 In 
the United Kingdom, cannabis seized 
by law enforcement showed no 
change in the mean potency of resin 
(5.9%) or imported herbs (8.5%) 
in 2008.17 In the United States, 
ElSohly et al, 
14 focusing on seized 
products, published a mean cannabis 
potency of 12%. In Australia, Swift 
et al15 found the same evolution 
toward a higher potency of herbal 
cannabis (a mean THC content of 
14.9%). Cannabis decriminalization 
also seems to contribute to the 
progression of moderate to severe 
pediatric intoxications. In the 
United States, these clinical forms 
are significantly more represented 
in states where cannabis has been 
decriminalized.18 
– 
21 In these states, 
the ingestion of food products 
containing cannabis is of concern.22 
The risk of exposure is high because 
of attractive packaging and naming 
that is phonetically similar to the 
original candy (eg, “Beef-Kat” 
or “Oeo”).10, 
 
22 
– 
24 In France, the 
ingestion of resin sticks or balls is the 
main source of intoxication.6, 
 
8, 
 
9, 
 
25 
– 
29  
Intoxication in infants through 
passive inhalation has also been 
described.30 The main compounds 
in cannabis have a plasma peak 
between 1 hour for inhalation 
and 3 to 4 hours for ingestion. 
The effects last between 6 and 24 
hours.30 More prolonged neurologic 
effects have been published.31 The 
comparison of the evolution of 
clinical manifestations of pediatric 
intoxications presented by Spadari 
et al6 or Cao et al8 to the current 
study indicates a higher proportion 
of neurologic and cardiovascular 
symptoms in our cohort (Table 2).  
We believe this difference could 
be related to an elevated resin 
potency. The occurrence of 
seizures was described by several 
authors.6– 
8, 
 
25 The proconvulsive 
effect of cannabis is not unanimous. 
Some authors advocate the 
opposite effect because of the 
physiopathology of cannabinoids 
and the capacity to reduce the 
release of neurotransmitters, 
such as γ-aminobutyric acid or 
glutamate, and therefore neuronal 
excitability.31, 
 
32 Seizures would be 
related to possible adulterants of the 
resin (eg, anticholinergic substances, 
cocaine, or methamphetamine) or 
a concomitant ingestion of another 
toxin instead.33 The adulteration 
of cannabis resin was previously 
alleged. Moroccan hashish is cut 
mainly with a range of inert or 
active substances (eg, soil, henna, 
paraffin or bee wax, glue, licorice, 
or coffee).34 There is little data on 
adulterants in cannabis resin, and the 
existing data are controversial. The 
presence of adulterants in cannabis 
resin could not been confirmed by 
studies conducted in France by the 
French Office for Drugs and Drug 
Addiction (2007) or the French 
Reitox focal point.34 Therefore, 
positive results for cannabis and 
other drugs or molecules through 
a blood and/or urine screening are 
more likely because of separate 
poisonings. Because other drugs or 
toxic molecules may not be detected 
by classic enzyme immunoassays, 
more sophisticated techniques (such 
as gas chromatography and mass 
spectrometry) should be requested 
for their isolation, especially when 
clinical presentation is unusual or 
severe. The existence of mydriasis 
associated with other neurologic 
signs is a decisive element suggesting 
cannabis intoxication in children, but

 its presence is inconsistent (Table 2).  
This inconsistency explains the 
diagnostic uncertainty in cases of 
coma and the use of additional tests 
(eg, head computed tomography 
scans, lumbar puncture, EEGs, and 
metabolic tests).35 Cardiovascular 
symptoms are the result of the 
stimulation of type 1 cannabinoid 
receptors located in the heart. This 
stimulation generates an orthostatic 
and parasympathetic imbalance and 
the activation of the sympathetic 
system and potential blockage of the 
parasympathetic system.36 
– 
38 These 
transitory manifestations, which 
are dominated by sinus tachycardia, 
do not usually require any specific 
therapy.38, 
 
39 Adulterants should also 
be considered in the presence of 
severe cardiovascular manifestations 
(eg, myocardial infarction, coronary 
syndrome, and rhythm disorder). 
Hyponatremia may be explained 
by the direct effect of THC on the 
hypothalamic-pituitary axis (the 
release of vasopressin)23 or the 
effects of an adulterant, such as 
methamphetamine.40 In our cohort, 6 
of 8 patients with hyponatremia were 
screened. Results were negative for 
methamphetamine.
The increase in severe pediatric 
patients admitted to a pediatric 
intensive care or resuscitation 
unit was identified in France by Le 
Garrec et al.35 Because of the current 
prevalence of cannabis intoxication in 
young children, this diagnosis should 
be considered when an afebrile 
comatose child is admitted to a 
French emergency unit.29, 
 
35 Given the 
increased frequency, it could also be 
assumed that physicians investigated 
cannabis intoxication more often, 
and this may have contributed to the 
increase in prevalence in the last  
2 years.
No pediatric deaths because of 
cannabis intoxication have been 
reported. The systematic postmortem 
toxicological detection in a pediatric 
cohort of 730 children <19 years of 
age showed that 38% tested positive 
for toxic drugs or medications, but 
none of them were for cannabis.41
The variation in social measures 
accounts for the difficulty (in legal 
terms) of such cases in which the 
intoxicated person is not the user  
of the illicit drug but is vulnerable 
and subjected to the environment 
and parental or caregiver 
supervision.42
Because of the retrospective 
character of the study, some data 
available were insufficient (eg, 
parental cannabis consumption). 
Some children could have been 
admitted to non-PEDs, but usually 
(because of the alarming clinical 
presentation), they are transferred 
to the nearest regional PED. 
Extensive toxicological screening 
was not performed for all children. 
Cointoxications could have been 
underestimated for 30 patients. 
Cointoxication was detected 
in 4% (n = 8) of the screened 
patients (n = 205), making the risk 
of underestimation low for the 
unscreened patients. Most molecules 
known to produce false-positives 
for THC in urinalysis were not taken 
by our pediatric population (eg, 
dronabinol, efavirenz, naproxen, 
pantoprazole, and tolmetin). 
Concerning ibuprofen, a false-
positive result for cannabinoids in 
urine tests has been shown only in 
2 of 24 adult patients with chronic 
treatment.43 Niflumic acid can cause 
false-positive urine test results in 
some commercial immunoassays 
for cannabinoids, 
44 but it is not 
recommended in France for fever 
management. The risk of false-
positive urine detection because 
of niflumic acid use was therefore 
limited in nonscreened patients.
cOncLusIOns
In France, the increase of cannabis-
related PED admissions seems 
obviously linked to changing 
consumption trends and a higher 
potency of the predominant 
form on the market (hashish). In 
countries where marijuana has 
been decriminalized, this increase is 
related to greater availability and the 
growing lucrative market of edible 
products containing marijuana. In 
countries where cannabis potency 
has remained low, this pediatric 
health issue has not been reported. In 
the Netherlands, cannabis has been 
culturally smoked in coffee shops 
for some time. This could explain 
the absence of published pediatric 
intoxication. The most recent trends 
(2015–2016) provided by French 
PCCs confirm our results, showing 
an increase in the phenomenon and 
raising a real public health issue. 
Unintentional intoxication should 
be tightly monitored, and it should 
be mandatory to report such cases. 
Our data demonstrate incomplete 
reporting to CPS, especially when 
clinical presentation is not severe. 
Intervention by social services must 
also be mandatory and homogeneous 
across the country.
