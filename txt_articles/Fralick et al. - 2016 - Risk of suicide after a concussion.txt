S
uicide is a leading cause of death in both 
military and community settings.1 During 
2010, 3951 suicide deaths occurred in Can-
ada2 and 38 364 in the United States.3 The fre-
quency of attempted suicide is about 25 times 
higher, and the financial costs in the US equate to 
about US$40 billion annually.4 The losses from 
suicide in Canada are compar 
able to those in other 
countries when adjusted for population size.5 Sui-
cide deaths can be devastating to surviving family 
and friends.6 Suicide in the community is almost 
always related to a psychi 
atric illness (e.g., depres-
sion, substance abuse), whereas suicide in the mili-
tary is sometimes linked to a concussion from 
combat injury.7–10 
Concussion is the most common brain injury 
in young adults and is defined as a transient dis-
turbance of mental function caused by acute 
trauma.11 About 4 million concussion cases occur 
in the US each year, equivalent to a rate of about 
1 per 1000 adults annually;12 direct Can 
adian data 
are not available. The majority lead to self-limited 
symptoms, and only a small proportion have a 
protracted course.13 However, the frequency of 
depression after concussion can be high,14,15 and 
traumatic brain injury in the military has been 
associated with subsequent suicide.8,16 Severe 
head trauma resulting in admission to hospital has 
also been associated with an increased risk of sui-
cide, whereas mild concussion in ambulatory 
adults is an uncertain risk factor.17–20
The aim of this study was to determine 
whether concussion was associated with an 
increased long-term risk of suicide and, if so, 
whether the day of the concussion (weekend v. 
weekday) could be used to identify patients at 
further increased risk. The severity and mecha-
nism of injury may differ by day of the week 
because recreational injuries are more common 
on weekends and occupational injuries are more 
common on weekdays.21–27 The risk of a second 
concussion, use of protective safeguards, pro-
pensity to seek care, subsequent oversight, sense 
of responsibility and other nuances may also dif-
fer for concussions acquired from weekend rec-
reation rather than weekday work.28–31 Medical

Background: Head injuries have been associated 
with subsequent suicide among military person-
nel, but outcomes after a concussion in the com-
munity are uncertain. We assessed the long-term 
risk of suicide after concussions occurring on 
weekends or weekdays in the community.
Methods: We performed a longitudinal cohort 
analysis of adults with diagnosis of a concus-
sion in Ontario, Canada, from Apr. 1, 1992, to 
Mar. 31, 2012 (a 20-yr period), excluding severe 
cases that resulted in hospital admission. The pri-
mary outcome was the long-term risk of suicide 
after a weekend or weekday concussion. 
Results: We identified 235 110 patients with a 
concussion. Their mean age was 41 years, 52% 
were men, and most (86%) lived in an urban 
location. A total of 667 subsequent suicides 
occurred over a median follow-up of 9.3 years, 
equivalent to 31 deaths per 100 000 patients 
annually or 3 times the population norm. 
Weekend concussions were associated with a 
one-third further increased risk of suicide com-
pared with weekday concussions (relative risk 
1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.14–1.64). The 
increased risk applied regardless of patients’ 
demographic characteristics, was independent 
of past psychiatric conditions, became accentu-
ated with time and exceeded the risk among 
military personnel. Half of these patients had 
visited a physician in the last week of life.
Interpretation: Adults with a diagnosis of con-
cussion had an increased long-term risk of 
suicide, particularly after concussions on week-
ends. Greater attention to the long-term care 
of patients after a concussion in the community 
might save lives because deaths from suicide 
can be prevented.

care on weekends may also be limited because 
of shortfalls in staffing.32
Methods
Patient selection
We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of 
adults with a diagnosis of a concussion in 
Ontario, Canada, from Apr. 1, 1992, to Mar. 31, 
2012 (20 yr), based on vital statistics data avail-
able through the Office of the Registrar General 
database.33 Ontario is Canada’s most populous 
province, with 12 259 564 individuals in 2003 
(study midpoint).34 During the study period, the 
annual suicide rate in Ontario was about 9 per 
100 000,35 somewhat lower than the global sui-
cide rate of 11 per 100 00036 and the rate among 
former military personnel of 14 per 100 000.37,38 
During the study period, Ontario health insur-
ance covered primary, emergency and hospital 
care with no out-of-pocket costs to patients.39,40 
The project was approved by the Research Eth-
ics Board of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Cen-
tre; the approval included a waiver of the need 
for informed consent.
We identified patients with a diagnosis of a 
concussion by screening physician claims data 
using the International Classification of Dis-
eases, 9th revision (ICD-9) diagnostic criteria for 
concussion (code 850) from the Ontario Health 
Insurance Plan database.41,42 This code has been 
validated with high specificity (99%) and mid-
range sensitivity (22%–76%).43–45 Patients who 
were admitted to hospital immediately or within 
2 days of injury were excluded because such 
cases tend to reflect severe brain injury (a known 
risk factor for suicide) and do not represent 
ambulatory patients with concussion.46,47 Patients 
under 17 years of age were excluded because 
most suicide deaths occur in adults.48,49 Other-
wise, the selection criteria were fully compre-
hensive and included all patients seeking care 
whose diagnosis was made by a physician.
Data collection
We distinguished each case as a weekend concus-
sion (midnight Friday to midnight Sunday) or a 
weekday concussion (remaining 5 days and nights 
of the week).50 Differentiating a weekend from a 
weekday concussion was based on the date of med-
ical care, which closely corresponds to the date of 
injury.51,52 For patients with multiple concussions, 
we used the date of the first concussion, such that 
each person was counted once in the analyses; 
repeat concussions were tracked for separate sec-
ondary analyses. Further data on duration of amne-
sia, loss of consciousness, mechanism of injury, 
severity of symptoms, delays in seeking care and 
standardized concussion assessment scores were 
not available.53 Similarly, information was not 
available on cases that did not lead to medical 
attention or on whether day of the week was an 
imperfect proxy for concussion circumstances.
The official demographic registry provided data 
on patient age, sex and home location (urban or 
rural).34 Socioeconomic status was based on neigh-
bourhood income quintile and was determined 
through the validated Statistics Canada algo-
rithm.54–56 The health care services databases pro-
vided data on hospital admissions, outpatient con-
tacts and diagnoses in the previous year.57,58 Prior 
psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia, depression, 
bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, anxiety, sub-
stance abuse) were determined from physician 
diagnostic data for the full year before injury.59 
The available databases contained no information 
on social stress, life events, employment status, 
race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, immigration 
status, borderline personality disorder, childhood 
abuse, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, novel 
biomarkers or other suicide risks.60–62
Outcome identification
We determined the cause of death from official 
death certificates encompassing definite or prob-
able suicide, as investigated by the responsible 
coroner. All coroners were licensed physicians 
in Ontario, and suicidal death investigations 
have an interrater agreement of about 70% in 
this setting.63 We identified definite cases of sui-
cide by ICD-9 codes (E950–E959) or Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-
10)64 codes (X60–X84) and probable cases of 
suicide by ICD-9 codes (E980–E987, E989) or 
ICD-10 codes (Y10–Y32, Y34), as validated in 
past research.65 The database for death certifi-
cates has been validated previously and is the 
official source for vital statistics reporting, as 
well as the authoritative file for population-based 
analyses of suicides.59,66,67
For each case, we recorded the forensic cer-
tainty and mechanism of suicide from the death 
certificate. We calculated age at death and elapsed 
time from index concussion from the same source, 
coded to the exact day. Similarly, we recorded the 
time since the last visit with a physician by linking 
to the physician care database. We also recorded 
the reason for the last visit, classified as a psychiat-
ric, neurologic, medical or miscellaneous diagno-
sis along with the physician’s specialty.68 The 
available databases did not have information on 
pathology reports, toxicology reports, psychologi-
cal scores, presence of a suicide note, litigation 
involvement, seniority of the investigating coroner 
or findings from a psychiatric autopsy.69

Statistical analysis
In the prespecified primary analysis, we assessed 
cumulative incidence rates (accounting for cen-
soring and deaths) to estimate the probability of 
suicide after concussions on weekends and week-
days (Appendix 1, sections 1–5, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.150790/-/
DC1). Absolute risks were calculated as deaths per 
100 000 persons annually and were also compared 
with the prevailing suicide rate in the population 
during the same period.70 Cause-specific propor-
tional hazards regression was applied to further 
quantify differences in suicide risk between the 
2 groups before and after adjustment for baseline 
differences in demographic characteristics, psychi-
atric diagnoses and history of suicide attempts. All 
reported p values were 2-tailed and were calcu-
lated with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We developed additional statistical models 
with time-dependent covariables to evaluate 
patients who had multiple concussions over time 
(Appendix 1, section 7). For this approach, we 
applied an accumulating step function so that each 
concussion was considered a new event and the 
observed dose–response gradient correlated a 
patient’s total number of concussions with his or 
her overall risk of suicide. A 4-week interval was 
required to identify a subsequent diagnosis as a 
new concussion (an interval that was defined 
a priori, because symptoms typically resolve 
within 1 week and a variable period of rest is rec-
ommended afterward).71 We used the same step 
function to distinguish each additional concussion 
according to weekend or weekday occurrence.
Results
A total of 235 110 patients had a diagnosis of a 
concussion during the 20-year study period. 
Patient characteristics are detailed in Table 1. 
About half of the patients were men, the mean 
age was 41 years, and most were living in an 
urban location. Most of the patients had no for-
mal medical imaging, additional diagnosed frac-
ture, prior psychiatric diagnosis, prior hospital 
admission or prior suicide attempt. The baseline 
frequency of depression and other measured 
characteristics was not clinically significantly 
different between those injured on weekends and 
those injured on weekdays. Anxiety disorder, the 
single most common prior psychiatric diagnosis, 
was slightly less frequent among patients injured 
on weekends. The distribution of characteristics 
of both groups was generally stable over time.  
A total of 667 suicide deaths occurred over a 
median follow-up of 9.3 years, equivalent to 
31 deaths per 100 000 patients annually. Those 
with a concussion occurring on weekdays

accounted for 519 suicides, 1 804 520 patient-
years of follow-up and an absolute suicide risk 
of 29 per 100 000 annually or 3 times the popu-
lation norm. Those with a concussion occurring 
on weekends accounted for 148 suicides, 
377 115 patient-years of follow-up and an abso-
lute suicide risk of 39 per 100 000 annually or 
4 times the population norm. The difference 
between the 2 groups was equivalent to a one-
third increase in suicide risk after a weekend 
concussion relative to a weekday concussion. 
Time profiles indicated that the increased suicide 
risk was distributed evenly over years, with 
accumulating long-term differences (Figure 1).
The increased risk of suicide after concussions 
on weekends was evident in comparisons with 
each individual day of the week (Figure 2). Simi-
larly, all patient subgroups showed an absolute 
suicide risk above the population norm, all had a 
further increase in risk after concussions on week-
ends relative to weekdays, and the findings per-
sisted during both remote and recent eras (Appen-
dix 1, section 6). Patients with a prior suicide 
attempt had the highest absolute risk and also a 
further increase after a weekend concussion. 
Patients with no prior suicide attempt, psychiatric 
diagnosis or hospital admission (n = 168 188) had 
an absolute risk more than twice the population 
norm and also a further increase after a weekend 
concussion. 
Several other baseline factors were additional 
independent predictors of the long-term risk of 
suicide. As expected, suicide risk was associated 
with male sex, low socioeconomic status and 
prior psychiatric diagnosis (Table 2). A prior sui-
cide attempt was the single most powerful pre-
dictor. Also as expected, a prior diagnosis of 
substance abuse was another powerful predictor, 
whereas a diagnosed fracture was not a signifi-
cant predictor of suicide risk. Each specific 
psychi 
atric condition was associated with an 
increased risk, and no significant anomalies were 
apparent in analyses that explored post hoc pair-
wise product interaction terms. Adjustment for 
all predictors yielded a one-quarter increase in 
risk of suicide after a weekend concussion (rela-
tive risk 1.27, 95% CI 1.06–1.53). 
The observed association between concussion 
and risk of suicide was accentuated in time-
dependent statistical models accounting for addi-
tional concussions. A total of 24 746 patients had 
2 or more concussions and accounted for 205 575 
patient-years of follow-up, with 76 suicide 
deaths. The median interval between consecutive 
concussions was 214 (interquartile range 
69–1018) days. Overall, each additional concus-
sion was associated with a further increase in sui-
cide risk (estimate 1.30, 95% CI 1.12–1.50). Ana-
lyzing all concussions in all patients yielded a 
one-third increase in suicide risk after a concussion 
on a weekend compared with weekdays (estimate 
1.35, 95% CI 1.12–1.63).
We found no significant differences in suicide 
characteristics after a concussion on a weekend

compared with a weekday. The mean time from 
concussion to suicide was 5.7 years (Table 3). In 
accordance with legal criteria, three-quarters of 
the cases were determined as definite suicide and 
the remainder as probable suicide. Poisoning 
was the most common mechanism, accounting 
for almost half of the cases in both groups. 
Asphyxi 
ation was the second most common 
mechanism, accounting for about a third of the 
cases in both groups. Most of the patients had vis-
ited a physician in the month before death, pri-
mary care physicians accounted for the majority 
of these visits, and a psychiatric disorder was the 
responsible diagnosis for a minority of the visits. 
Interpretation
We studied data for about a quarter million adults 
to assess the risk of suicide after a concussion. We 
found that the long-term risk of suicide among 
those with a concussion was 3 times the popula-
tion norm and was even higher if the concussion 
occurred on a weekend. The increased risk applied 
regardless of demographic characteristics, was 
independent of past psychiatric conditions, became 
accentuated with time, followed a dose–response 
gradient and was not as high as the risk associated 
with past suicide attempts. About half of the 
patients had visited a physician in the last week of 
life, typically for a diagnosis unrelated to mental 
illness. The absolute risk was equal to about 
470 suicide deaths that might not have occurred if 
the prevailing risks had matched the population 
norm (Appendix 1, section 9). 
Our findings are congruent with the results of 
past studies indicating that suicide attempts are the 
single most important long-term predictor of sub-
sequent risk of suicide.72,73 Additional long-term 
predictors confirmed in this analysis included male 
sex, low socioeconomic status and prior psychiat-
ric history.74,75 Past studies have cautioned that 
individual risk factors have low accuracy for pre-
dicting individual events.76,77 No past study, to our 
knowledge, has focused on concussions and tested 
the potential difference between weekends and 
weekdays. Moreover, the increased long-term risk 
of suicide observed in this study persisted among 
those who had no psychiatric risk factors and was 
distinctly larger than among patients after an ankle 
sprain (Appendix 1, section 8).
Our findings also support past research on dif-
fering theories of suicide.78–80 Past studies have 
suggested that a concussion can cause lasting 
defi 
cits through changes in physiology (e.g., dis-
rupted serotonin pathways), mood (e.g., post-
traumatic stress disorder) or behaviour (e.g., dis-
inhibition with impulsivity).81–84 Cognitive 
dissonance could also lead patients and clinicians 
to attribute injuries after weekend recreation to 
misadventure, whereas injuries following week-
day occupation might be attributed to the em-
ployer.85–87 With hindsight, a difference in activ-
ity restriction or cognitive dissonance might arise 
if the injury event was self-initiated.88,89 Further 
research is needed to address these issues; in the 
interim, our findings suggest that a history of 
concussion may be relevant when assessing a pa-
tient’s suicide risk.
Limitations
An alternative interpretation of our findings is 
unmeasured confounding. A concussion might 
indicate a latent predisposition toward suicide 
before the injury or worsening neurodegenerative 
deficits that precipitated the injury.90,91 Exploring 
these mechanisms is difficult because of the falli-
bility of gauging comorbid illness, concussion 
severity, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, long-
term risk of suicide and the exact time of a con-
cussion.92 Such mechanisms might fully explain 
our findings, including the observed increased 
risk that expanded for years after injury, did not 
change the mechanism of suicide and occurred 
despite medical care (Appendix 1, section 10). 
Regardless of interpretation, these findings sug-

gest that an association between concussion and 
suicide is not confined to the military.
Our study also highlights the modest ability of 
any one factor to predict suicide because most 
patients do not die from suicide (Appendix 1, 
section 11). Furthermore, studies of suicide are 
prone to detection bias because social stigma 
leads analyses to underestimate total counts.93,94 
Each case is different, such that mathematical 
models are fallible through a lack of myriad rele-
vant data, such as alcohol consumption and sui-
cidal ideation.95 Long-term predictions and gen-
eralizability are also problematic because of the 
network of intervening factors and shifting defi-
nitions of concussion.47,96,97 Some patients with 
concussion receive care that may mitigate the risk 
of suicide, such as antidepressant medication;98,99 
however, our study lacked data on such care, 
which remains a topic for future research.
Conclusion
Concussion differs in 3 important ways from 
other risk factors for suicide. First, concussions are 
sometimes preventable through adequate train-
ing, the minimizing of distractions, avoidance of 
alcohol, use of protective gear and other safety 
basics.100 Second, concussions are easily neglected 
under a popular belief that the neurologic symp-
toms have an obvious cause, will resolve quickly, 
leave nothing visible on medical imaging and do 
not require follow-up.101,102 Third, concussions are 
rarely deemed relevant for consideration by psych-
iatrists or other physicians when eliciting a 
patient’s history.103,104 Greater attention to the long-
term implications of a concussion in community 
settings might save lives because deaths from sui-
cide can be prevented.105,106
