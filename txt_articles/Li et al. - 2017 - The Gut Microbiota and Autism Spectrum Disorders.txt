Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a common comorbidity in patients with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Many studies
have shown alterations in the composition of the fecal flora and metabolic products of the
gut microbiome in patients with ASD. The gut microbiota influences brain development
and behaviors through the neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and autonomic nervous
systems. In addition, an abnormal gut microbiota is associated with several diseases,
such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ASD and mood disorders. Here, we review
the bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal
tract (brain-gut axis) and the role of the gut microbiota in the central nervous system
(CNS) and ASD. Microbiome-mediated therapies might be a safe and effective treatment
for ASD.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a group of brain developmental disorders, and it is
defined by stereotyped behavior and deficits in communication and social interaction. ASD has
a significant influence on the development of children and on society. In 2012, the estimated
prevalence of ASD was 14.6 per 1,000 children aged 8 years, and the prevalence was significantly
higher in boys (23.6 per 1,000) than that in girls (5.3 per 1,000) (Christensen et al., 2016). The
cost of caring for a child with ASD but without an intellectual disability is £0.92 million in the
United Kingdom and $1.4 million in the United States. The main costs associated with the care of
children with ASD are special education services and a loss of parental productivity (Buescher et al.,
2014). Therefore, the economic effects of ASD have prompted researchers to search for effective
interventions. However, identifying the exact etiology and pathology of ASD is difficult, and
available effective therapies are limited (Rossignol and Frye, 2012). Previous studies have focused
on genetic causes, dysregulation of the immune system, inflammation, exposure to environmental
toxicants, and the gut microbiota (Fakhoury, 2015). The heritability of ASD and autistic disorder
was approximately 50% among Swedish children, suggesting that both genetic and environmental
factors play important roles in the development of ASD (Hallmayer et al., 2011; Sandin et al., 2014).
Accumulating evidence demonstrates that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain,
gaseousness, diarrhea, constipation and flatulence, are a common comorbidity in patients with
ASD (Chaidez et al., 2014). A study by Gorrindo et al. identified constipation as the most common
symptom (85%) in children with ASD according to parental reports and evaluations by pediatric
gastroenterologists (Gorrindo et al., 2012). The prevalence of GI symptoms ranges from 23 to
70% in children with ASD (Chaidez et al., 2014). Furthermore, the observed GI symptoms are

associated with the severity of ASD (Adams et al., 2011;
Gorrindo et al., 2012). Although these studies did not show a
cause-effect relationship between GI symptoms and ASD, the
findings suggest that the gut plays an important role in the
etiology of ASD. The gut consists of millions of microbiota,
and we hypothesize that the microbiota and its metabolites
might be involved in the pathophysiology of ASD. Several
articles have reviewed the influence of the gut microbiota on
the animal central nervous system (CNS) and suggested the
existence of a microbiota gut-brain axis (Bienenstock et al.,
2015; Mayer et al., 2015). The microbiota-gut-brain axis is likely
the method of communication between the brain and the gut
microbiota. This article reviews the role of the gut microbiota
in the pathology of ASD. Strategies that modulate the gut
microbiota might constitute a potential therapy for patients
with ASD.
GUT MICROBIOTA
The human gut consists of approximately 1 kg of bacteria, and
the number of bacterial genes are in the gut is approximately
about 9.9 million. The ratio of host DNA vs. microbiome DNA
is 1:10. (Li et al., 2014). Our knowledge of the microbiome
has excessively expanded over the last few years. For example,
researchers previously believed that the in utero environment
was sterile (Jimenéz et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2016). However,
recent work has shown that the infant gut is colonized by
the microbiome of the maternal vagina, anus and skin during
delivery and by the environmental bacteria to which the neonate
is exposed during the postpartum period (Dominguez-Bello et al.,
2010; Bokulich et al., 2016; Yassour et al., 2016). As demonstrated
in recent studies, the placenta and the amniotic fluid are not
sterile (DiGiulio et al., 2008; Aagaard et al., 2014). In addition,
the microbiome in the first meconium of mice is not sterile,
indicating that the microbiome colonizes the infant gut prior
to parturition (Jimenéz et al., 2008). Maternal factors, such as
maternal diet and delivery mode, and postnatal factors, including
antibiotics, breast-feeding, diet and host genetics, structure the
neonatal microbiome in humans and animal models (Tamburini
et al., 2016). Many studies have shown that a maternal high-
fat diet during pregnancy decreases the level of Bacteroides
in human neonates and diminishes the abundance of non-
pathogenic Campylobacter in primates (Ma et al., 2014; Chu
et al., 2016). Furthermore, maternal obesity during pregnancy
and gestational diabetes alter the gut microbiota and might be
associated with ASD in humans (Connolly et al., 2016). As shown
by Buffington et al., a maternal high-fat diet induces dysbiosis
and autism-like phenotypes in mice, and Lactobacillus reuteri
restores these alternations (Buffington et al., 2016). The birth
mode and antibiotics also shape the gut microbiota (Bokulich
et al., 2016). The gut microbiota of infants who were delivered
vaginally resembles their mother’s vaginal microbiota, which is
dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and the
gut microbiota of babies who were born by Cesarean section is
similar to their mother’s skin microbiota, which is dominated
by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp.
(Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010). As shown by Yassour et al., the
composition of the microbiota of children who were treated
with antibiotics during the first 3 years of life is less diverse
in terms of both bacterial species and strains (Yassour et al.,
2016). A population-based cohort study revealed the use of
various antibiotics during pregnancy as a potential risk factor
for ASD/infantile autism (Atladóttir et al., 2012). The early
feeding pattern also influences the gut microbiota of infants
and is associated with ASD. Formula-fed infants present an
increased species richness accompanied by an overrepresentation
of Clostridium difficile compared with breast-fed infants (Azad
et al., 2013). Breast-feeding for more than 6 months is associated
with a lower risk of developing ASD (Schultz et al., 2006).
Penn et al. studied infants with an older sibling diagnosed
with ASD in the San Diego area and found that breast-feeding
might protect the infants against GI symptoms (Penn et al.,
2016). As an individual’s diet diversifies with increasing age,
the gut microbiota gradually stabilizes (Koenig et al., 2011;
Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Tamburini et al., 2016). A diet with
lean ground beef increases the diversity of the gut microbiota
and improves both working and reference memory in mice
compared with a standard rodent chow diet, suggesting a
correlation between diet-induced shifts in the gut microbiota
and animal behaviors (Li et al., 2009a). Environmental exposure
also affects the microbiota of humans. Furthermore, dysbiosis
of the gut microbiota is associated with several disorders in
children, such as abnormal behaviors, Crohn’s disease, obesity
and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Ajslev et al., 2011;
Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Jostins et al., 2012). In summary, the
gut microbiota plays important roles in human physiology and
pathology.

individuals. Wang et al., found more GI syndromes, including
constipation (20%) and diarrhea (19%), in children with ASD
than in their unaffected siblings (42 vs. 23%, respectively)
(Wang et al., 2011). Two meta-analyses showed similar results in
children with ASD (Coury et al., 2012; McElhanon et al., 2014).
Patients with ASD who present GI symptoms might display
significant behavioral manifestations, such as anxiety, self-injury
and aggression (Buie et al., 2010). Accumulating evidence
demonstrates that the gut microbiota is directly or indirectly
associated with ASD symptoms, in part by influencing the
immune system and metabolism (De Angelis et al., 2015; Mead
and Ashwood, 2015). A higher percentage of abnormal intestinal
permeability was observed in 36.7% of patients with ASD and
their relatives (21.2%) compared with control children (4.8%)
(de Magistris et al., 2010). An increased intestinal permeability
results in a higher antigenic load from the gastrointestinal
tract. Lymphocytes and ASD-associated cytokines, such as
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-α), are present in the circulation and
cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Subsequently, IL-1β and

TNF-α bind to brain endothelial cells and induce immune
responses in the brain (Li et al., 2009b; Ashwood et al., 2011; de
Theije et al., 2011). Alterations in the composition of the gut
microbiota and their metabolic products are commonly observed
in patients with ASD and in animal models of ASD (de Magistris
et al., 2010; Borre et al., 2014; Kushak et al., 2016). Hsiao
et al. observed gastrointestinal barrier defects and microbiota
alterations in a mouse model displaying features of ASD.
They found that bacteria belonging to Porphyromonadaceae,
Prevotellaceae, unclassified Bacteroidales, and Lachnospiraceae
were more abundant in offspring of mothers with maternal
immune activation (MIA) than in control offspring, whereas
Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Alcaligenaceae were
more abundant in the latter (Hsiao et al., 2013). As shown
in mice, the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid (VPA), when
used by the mother during pregnancy, induces autistic-like
social behaviors in the offspring accompanied by alterations in
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (de Theije et al., 2014b). Compared
with the gut microbiota of children without ASD, the gut
microbiota of children with ASD is less diverse and exhibits
lower levels of Bifidobacterium and Firmicutes and higher
levels of Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacteroidetes, Desulfovibrio,
Caloramator and Sarcina (Finegold et al., 2002, 2010; Adams
et al., 2011; Finegold, 2011; De Angelis et al., 2013). Children with
autism who present GI symptoms have lower abundances of the
genera Prevotella, Coprococcus, and unclassified Veillonellaceae
than that found in GI symptom-free neurotypical children (Kang
et al., 2013). Fecal samples from children with ASD also have
higher levels of the Clostridium histolyticum group (Clostridium
clusters II and I) compared with samples from unrelated healthy
children (Parracho et al., 2005). The non-autistic sibling group
presents an intermediate level of Clostridium histolyticum that
does not significantly differ from the ASD group. Clostridium can
produce neurotoxins and might exert systemic effects (Parracho
et al., 2005). The reduction of Clostridium yields significant
improvements in children with ASD (Sandler et al., 2000).
Additionally, children with ASD present alterations in their
levels of Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Sutterella (Wang et al.,
2013). Ruminococcus torques has been associated with functional
GI disorder (Joossens et al., 2011). Infants who were delivered by
Cesarean section (CS) are at higher risk of developing ASD (odds
ratio of 1.23) than infants delivered vaginally (Curran et al.,
2015). Children with ASD have a history of using significantly
more antibiotics (Niehus and Lord, 2006; Shultz et al., 2008;
Atladóttir et al., 2010, 2012). Thus, early life events that can alter
the composition of the microbial community, such as delivery
mode and antibiotic exposure, are risk factors for ASD. However,
some studies have not found an association between ASD and
the gut microbiota. A study of 59 ASD individuals and 44 normal
siblings via targeted qPCR found no significant difference in
Sutterella, Prevotella or total Bacteroidetes composition between
them (Son et al., 2015).
Although many studies have demonstrated alternations to
the bacterial gut microbiota in ASD patients, fewer studies have
evaluated the relationships between gut fungi and ASD. The
yeast in gut (particularly Candida. albicans) result in absorbing
carbohydrates and minerals fewer and releasing higher toxins.
Kantarcioglu et al. isolated 338 yeast strains from 415 stool
samples of ASD individuals. Among the yeast strain, 81.4% were
Candida (particularly Candida. albicans). Lower yeast isolated
rate (19.6%) were identified in non-autistic healthy volunteers.
Candida. krusei and Candida. glabrata were not found in healthy
children (De Angelis et al., 2013; Kantarcioglu et al., 2016). Strati
et al., found a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes
ratio in autistic subjects relative to normal subjects. They also
found that Candida was two times more abundant in autistic
individuals than in normal individuals (Strati et al., 2017). The
proliferation of Candida can be inhibited by IL-17, IL-22, which
modulated by some species of Lactobacillus through tryptophan-
derived aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands (Zelante et al., 2013).
Candida can releases ammonia and toxins that can induce autistic
behaviors (Burrus, 2012; Iovene et al., 2017). The alterations
of the bacterial microbiota in ASD individuals result in the
expansion of Candida, which would worsen the dysbiosis and
induce the abnormal behaviors. In summary, the role of gut
fungal in ASD still need more large samples studies.
POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
THE MICROBIOTA AND ASD (THE
GUT-BRAIN AXIS)
The gut–brain axis is regarded as a pathway of communication
between the gut and the brain, and it is a bidirectional
communication system. An increasing body of evidence shows
that the gut-brain axis participates in the pathogenesis of
ASD. The gut microbiota influences brain function through the
neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and autonomic nervous systems
and via microbiotic toxin production (Grenham et al., 2011;
Mayer, 2011; Figure 1). The mucosa of the gastrointestinal
tract contains millions of neurons, which constitute the enteric
nervous system (ENS) and regulate gastrointestinal functions.
Therefore, the gut is considered as a “second brain.” Figure 1
outlines the potential relationships between the gut microbiota
and ASD.
A fundamental factor underlying the relationships between
ASD and the gut is the increased permeability of the intestinal
tract of ASD individuals, referred to as a “leaky gut” (Quigley,
2016). Previous studies have demonstrated that ASD animals
present defects in the GI barrier, resulting in the entry of
the toxins and bacterial products into the bloodstream, which
influence brain function (Onore et al., 2012; Hsiao et al.,
2013). For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), components of the
cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, is increased in the serum
of ASD compared with healthy individuals and is associated
with impaired social behavioral scores (Emanuele et al., 2010).
Fiorentino et al., found that the integrity of both the gut
barrier and the BBB were impaired in ASD individuals, as
evidenced by increased levels of claudin (CLDN)-5, CLDN-
12, CLDN-3, and MMP-9 in the ASD brain and decreased
levels of intestinal tight junction components (CLDN-1, OCLN,
TRIC) in ASD individuals compared with controls. (Fiorentino
et al., 2016). Intestinal permeability, measured by the lactulose:
mannitol test, has been shown to be increased in autistic

The Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorders
FIGURE 1 | Potential relationships between the microbiota and ASD (the gut-brain axis). The production of metabolites, such as SCFAs and toxin
metabolites, by certain microbiota (e.g., Lactobacillus) can cross the “leaky gut” to affect brain function. Some microbiota can produce neuroactive compounds (e.g.,
5-HT and GABA) that cross the “leaky gut” and influence brain function and induce abnormal behaviors. These neuroactive compounds can directly influence the HPA
axis and increase circulating levels of cortisol. Metabolites, certain microbiota and neuroactive compounds can activate enteric neurons and affect brain function
through the vagus nerve. Some microbiota and metabolites can activate gut immune cells, which can release cytokines into circulation. 4-EPS, 4-ethylphenyl sulfate;

children compared with healthy controls (de Magistris et al.,
2010). Furthermore, germ-free (GF) mice display increased BBB
permeability. Bacterial products (e.g., acetate and propionate)
can enhance the integrity of the BBB (Braniste et al., 2014).
Gut Microbiota-Mediated Metabolites
Gut microbiota-mediated metabolites, such as short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs), phenol compounds, and free amino acids (FAA),
affect ASD-like behaviors through the vagal pathways (Shimmura
et al., 2011; Macfabe, 2012; Persico and Napolioni, 2013; Forsythe
et al., 2014).
SCFAs, including acetic acid (AA), proprionic acid (PPA),
butyrate, isobutyric acid, valeric acid and isovaleric acid, are
principal products of the gut bacterial fermentation of non-
digestible carbohydrates (Al-Lahham et al., 2010) and provide
benefits to the host, including improvements in glucose and
energy homeostasis and reductions in body weight and the risk
of colon cancer (Mariadason et al., 2000; De Vadder et al.,
2014; Chambers et al., 2015). According to several studies,
SCFAs play a critical role in patients with ASD. A study by
Wang et al., detected higher concentrations of total SCFAs and
ammonia in fecal matter from children with autism compared
with controls (Wang et al., 2012). PPA, a short-chain fatty
acid that is mainly produced by Clostridia, Bacteroidetes, and
Desulfovibrio, can cross the BBB and induce ASD-like behaviors
(MacFabe et al., 2007, 2011; Shultz et al., 2008; Ossenkopp et al.,
2012). As shown by Thomas et al., the intracerebroventricular
administration of high doses of PPA provokes some autistic-like
behaviors in mice (Thomas et al., 2012), and the intraventricular
administration of PPA to rats results in hyperactivity, repetitive
behaviors and abnormal motor movements, similar to the
behavioral and electrographic changes detected in humans with
ASD (MacFabe et al., 2007). PPA leads to impaired social
behavior in rats, likely by altering some neurotransmitters,
such as dopamine and serotonin (Mitsui et al., 2005). Butyrate
can modulate synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine,
norepinephrine and epinephrine by altering expression of the
tyrosine hydroxylase gene (DeCastro et al., 2005). Butyrate also
inhibits histone deacetylases and possesses anti-inflammatory
effects (Cleophas et al., 2016). Researchers have found lower
serum levels of 4-ethylphenylsulfate (4EPS), indolepyruvate,
glycolate, imidazole propionate and N-acetylserine in a MIA
model of ASD. Naïve wild-type mice treated with 4EPS potassium
salt presents ASD-related behavior (Hsiao et al., 2013). FAA,
derived from the hydrolysis of proteins and peptides, has also
been found to be associated with ASD. De Angelis et al., found
that the level of total FAA in fecal samples was higher in children
with autism than that in heathy children. In addition, the levels

The Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorders
of Asp, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Phe, His, Tpr, Lys, and Pro
in fecal samples were higher in the children with autism (De
Angelis et al., 2015). Glu, a neurotransmitters in the CNS, has
been found to be associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders
and ASD (Sheldon and Robinson, 2007; Shimmura et al., 2011).
Noto et al., found that tryptophan, a neurotransmitter precursor,
was increased in the urine of ASD patients. In addition, they
found increased levels of tryptophan fragments in urine and
increased tryptophan degradation, which are also found in
depression and mental retardation (Noto et al., 2014). When
compared with urine samples from control children, the urine
samples from children with ASD contain higher levels of 2-(4-
hydroxyphenyl) propionate and taurocholenate sulfate and lower
levels of 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionate and 5-amino-valerate
(Ming et al., 2012). 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic
acid, a phenylalanine metabolite of Clostridia spp. was shown to
be increased in the urine of ASD patients and is associated with
autistic behaviors in animals (Shaw, 2010).
The Immune System Pathways
The gut can also communicate with the brain through
immunological pathways. Many studies have shown increased
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-
8, and IL-12p40, in the plasma of ASD individuals (Ashwood
et al., 2011). Immune responses to toxins produced by pathogenic
microbiota and focal inflammation increase gut permeability. An
impaired intestinal barrier is observed in response to infection
or stress, which allows the translocation of the gut bacteria across
the intestinal wall and into the mesenteric lymphoid tissue, where
they activate the immune system through mucosal immune
cells (Dicksved et al., 2012). The activated immune system
releases inflammatory cytokines and activates the vagal system,
which in turn regulates CNS activity (Yarandi et al., 2016).
Konsman et al., found peripheral cytokines to induce behavioral
depression through the vagus nerve (Konsman et al., 2000).
Moreover, metabolic compounds, such as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) produced by gut microbiota, are absorbed into the
blood through an impaired gut wall and activate Toll-like
receptors in the ENS and CNS (Abreu, 2010). An IgE-
mediated allergic immune response in the intestine increases
the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and decreases the 5-
hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the intestine. It also
reduces social communication and increases repetitive behavior.
It mice, these effects are accompanied by a downregulation of
dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex and activation of
the neuroendocrine system in mice (de Theije et al., 2014b).
Neuroactive Compound Pathways
The pathway via which the microbiota communicate with the
brain can also involve neurotransmitters. The gut microbiota
produces neuroactive compounds such as dopamine (DA), 5-
HT, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and histamine, which activate
or inhibit central neurons through the vagus nerve (Eisenstein,
2016; Spiller and Major, 2016). Compared with specific-
pathogen-free (SPF) mice with a normal gut microbiota, GF mice
exhibit a significant elevation of monoamine neurotransmission
(of compounds such as noradrenaline, DA and 5-HT), decreased
levels of nerve growth factor-inducible clone A (NGFI-
A) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increased
corticosterone levels, and increased anxiety-like behaviors (Diaz
Heijtz et al., 2011; Neufeld et al., 2011; Clarke et al.,
2013). Antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota in
mice impairs learning and increases depression-like behaviors.
Furthermore, the levels of CNS neurotransmitters (e.g., 5-
HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, noradrenaline, DA and the
metabolite homovanillic acid) as well as the mRNA levels of the
glucocorticoid receptor and corticotrophin-releasing hormone
receptor 1 have been shown to be altered (Hoban et al., 2016).
The gut microbiota also affects mammalian brain development
and subsequent adult behavior. For instance, GF mice display
lower expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-
95) and synaptophysin in the striatum, increased monoamine
neurotransmission and motor activity and reduced anxiety
compared with SPF mice (Diamond et al., 2011; Diaz Heijtz
et al., 2011). Blood serotonin (5-HT) was the first ASD biomarker
identified and is present in approximately 30% of individuals
with ASD (Pare et al., 1960; Schain and Freedman, 1961; Hanley
et al., 1977; Mulder et al., 2004). SERT 5-HT transporter (SERT)
Ala56-knock-in mice, which display hyperserotonemia as a
result of increased neuronal absorption of 5-HT, show abnormal
social behaviors, nonstandard communication, and repetitive
behaviors (Veenstra-VanderWeele et al., 2012). Serotonin, which
is synthesized in the intestines and brain, is important for the
regulation of mood and cognition (Cryan et al., 2000). Marler
et al., found an association between whole-blood serotonin levels
and GI symptoms in ASD individuals (Marler et al., 2016).
Compared to the brains of offspring from the control mice,
the brains of offspring from VPA-exposed mice present altered
microbiota and lower levels of serotonin and ASD-like behavior
(de Theije et al., 2014a).
MODULATION OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA
IS A POTENTIAL THERAPY FOR
CHILDREN WITH ASD
At present, there are no effective therapies for ASD. Parents often
take their children to receive intervention that is tailored to their
specific needs. It is urgent to look for risk-free and effective
treatments. Accumulating evidences showed modulation of the
gut microbiota is a potential therapy in children with ASD.
Probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
and diet have getting considerable attention (Table 1). Probiotics
may prevent intestinal inflammatory diseases by regulating
intestinal tight junction protein expression and barrier function.
The use of heat-killed probiotics may provide therapeutic benefit
while minimizing adverse effects.
Probiotics and Prebiotics
Probiotics, such as the lactic acid-producing bacteria belonging
to Lactococcin, Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Saccharomycetes,
are beneficial to the host when provided in adequate quantities.
Many studies have shown that probiotics can prevent and treat
a variety of diseases, such as obesity, depression, colorectal

cancer and Crohn’s disease, in animal models and humans
(Verna and Lucak, 2010; Verma and Shukla, 2014; Sharma and
Shukla, 2016; Valsecchi et al., 2016). In heathy women without
gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms, the consumption of
a fermented milk product containing Bifidobacterium animalis
subsp lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus,
and Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis results in robust alterations in
activity in the brain regions that control the central processing
of emotions and sensations, as observed by functional magnetic
resonance imaging (Tillisch et al., 2013). Patients with irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) who were treated with B. infantis
35624 reported that alleviation of symptoms such as abdominal
pain and distention and presented a normalized ratio of the
immunomodulatory cytokines IL-10/IL-12 (O’Mahony et al.,
2005; Whorwell et al., 2006). In a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, randomized study, Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and
Bifidobacterium longum R0175 were administered to healthy
women for 30 days, and then anxiety, depression, and 24-
h free cortisol levels in the urine were then assessed. The
probiotics alleviated psychological distress and the 24-h urinary
cortisol levels (Messaoudi et al., 2011). In another pilot clinical
study, patients with chronic fatigue syndrome received 24 billion
colony-forming units of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota daily
for 2 months, and a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms
and a significant increase in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria
were observed (Rao et al., 2009). Probiotic, such as Lactobacillus
reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, have been shown to improve
barrier function via altering the expression of tight junction
proteins and decreased the bacterial translocation in animal
models or in vitro (Ulluwishewa et al., 2011; Dicksved et al., 2012;
Patel et al., 2012). Healthy human administered Lactobacillus
plantarum strain WCFS1 in the duodenum enhanced the
intestinal barrier by regulating human epithelial tight-junction
proteins (Karczewski et al., 2010). Patel et al., found Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG (LGG) promoted intestinal barrier function
maturation by inducing claudin 3 expression (Patel et al.,
2012).
The probiotic/prebiotic can normalize the gut microbiota,
enhance gut barrier and relieve the ASD-like behaviors in
animal models or ASD patients. As shown by a study of
Hsiao et al., treatment with Bacteroides fragilis reduced gut
permeability, altered the composition of the gut microbiota and
decreased ASD-like behaviors in a rodent model of ASD (Hsiao
et al., 2013). West et al., found that the daily administration

et al., 2013). Supplementation with a probiotic containing
Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria and Streptococci normalizes the
Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, and the amounts of Desulfovibrio
spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. in the feces of children with
ASD are similar to those found in samples from their non-
autistic siblings or unrelated heathy controls. They also found
the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) restricted/repetitive
behavior subscale score has associated with the amount of
Desulfovibrio spp. (Tomova et al., 2015). However, the authors
did not assess the alteration of ASD behavior after probiotic
treatment. According to a cohort study, oral supplementation

 Li et al.
The Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorders
with Lactobacillus acidophilus twice daily for 2 months decreases
the D-arabinitol levels in the urine of children with ASD and
improves their ability to follow directions, as demonstrated
through comparison with data collected before the treatment
(Kaluzna-Czaplinska and Blaszczyk, 2012). A case study showed
an ASD boy with severe cognitive disability was treated with
VSL#3 (a multi-strain mixture of 10 probiotics) for 4 weeks.
The treatment relieved the GI symptoms and improved the
autistic core symptoms (Grossi et al., 2016). In a recent
clinical study, which is currently in progress, 100 preschoolers
with ASD are being administered probiotics or a placebo
for 6 months, and the results will provide new information
regarding the clinical and neurophysiological effects of the
probiotic treatment in children with ASD (Santocchi et al.,
2016).
Probiotic treatments have a proven ability to normalize
the
microbiota
and
ameliorate
gut
symptoms;
however,
the available evidence for prebiotics is lacking. The term
“prebiotics”
refers
to
non-digestible
oligosaccharides
that
induce the growth of beneficial bacteria (Rosenfeld, 2015).
The
prebiotic
galactooligosaccharide
(B-GOS)
increases
the levels of Bifidobacterium spp. in an in vitro gut model,
as
demonstrated
through
the
analysis
of
fecal
samples
from children with ASD and controls (Grimaldi et al.,
2017).
However, the positive roles of probiotics or prebiotics in
humans are controversial. In summary, probiotic, and prebiotic
treatment for ASD patients lack multicenter, large- sample,
randomized controlled trial.
Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)
Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is an intervention
in which the fecal microbiota from a healthy individual is
delivered to a patient with a dysbiotic gut microbiota. FMT
dates back to fourth-century China, when a traditional Chinese
medicine doctor described an oral human fecal suspension that
effectively cured food poisoning and severe diarrhea (Zhang
et al., 2012). It is highly efficacious in the treatment of
recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) (Vrieze et al.,
2013; Lessa et al., 2015). FMT has been applied to the
treatment of IBD and IBS, based on the speculation that
FMT can normalize the gut microbiota in patients with
IBD and IBS, and improve constipation symptom (100%)
(Aroniadis and Brandt, 2013; Rossen et al., 2015). Thus,
researchers are increasingly interested in using FMT to treat
children with ASD. However, the safety of FMT should be
considered. The potential adverse events of FMT include
diarrhea, abdominal cramps, belching in the short term, mild
abdominal discomfort/bloating, and transient low-grade fever
(Kelly et al., 2015).
Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT)
Microbiota transfer therapy (MTT) is a modified FMT protocol
comprising 14 days of antibiotic treatment followed by bowel
cleansing and the administration of a high initial dose of
standardized human gut microbiota (SHGM) for 7–8 weeks.
An open-label clinical trial showed that MTT improved both
GI symptoms (e.g., constipation, diarrhea, indigestion and
abdominal pain) and ASD-related symptoms and normalized the
microbiota of ASD patients (Kang et al., 2017).
Other Potential Therapies (e.g., Diet and
Antibiotics)
Children with ASD tolerate a narrower range of foods and
exhibit more feeding problems than children without ASD
(Schreck et al., 2004). Specifically, children with ASD refuse
more foods and exhibit a more limited food repertoire than
typically developing children (Bandini et al., 2010). Many
parents complain that their children with ASD are selective
eaters. Children with ASD reject foods for various reasons,
including problems with the presentation of the food, the use
of certain utensils, and the inclusion of different types of food
on the same plate (Schreck and Williams, 2006). Compared
with controls, children with ASD ingest fewer fruits, vegetables,
and proteins and have a significantly lower daily intake of
potassium, copper, folate, and calcium (Sharp et al., 2013; Malhi
et al., 2017). Food intake influences the composition of the gut
microbiota (Wu et al., 2011). Decreases in carbohydrate intake
decrease the levels of Roseburia spp. and Eubacterium rectale
(Duncan et al., 2007). Furthermore, diet-induced alterations in
the location and composition of the gut microbiota influence
the serum metabolite levels (Tremaroli and Bäckhed, 2012).
According to an open-label trial, participants with ASD who
are treated with omega-3 fatty acids for 12 weeks exhibit
significant improvements in social behaviors (Ooi et al., 2015).
However, high-dose supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids
do not affect children with ASD, as demonstrated by a recent
study (Mankad et al., 2015). A gluten-free and/or casein-free
(GF/CF) diet improves ASD behaviors, physiological symptoms,
and social behaviors (Knivsberg et al., 2002; Millward et al.,
2004; Pennesi and Klein, 2012). The ketogenic diet is a high-
fat and low-carbohydrate diet and results in reductions in
the total gut microbial counts, increased sociability, decreased
repetitive behaviors, and improved social communication in an
ASD animal model (Ruskin et al., 2013; Castro et al., 2016).
Newell et al. found that the ketogenic diet reduces the total gut
microbial abundance in cecal and fecal matter and normalizes
the level of Akkermansia muciniphila in an ASD murine model
(Newell et al., 2016). Children with regressive-onset autism who
are treated with vancomycin, a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic,
for a short period exhibit improvements in diarrhea and
autistic behaviors (Sandler et al., 2000). Based on a prospective,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 3-month treatment with
levocarnitine improves ASD symptoms in children with ASD
(Geier et al., 2011). More clinical studies are needed to establish
support for the use of dietary, antibiotic, and supplement
treatments.
CONCLUSION
In this review, we summarize the information from multiple
studies showing that an abnormal gut microbiota is related
to ASD. First, we reviewed the relationship between the

gut microbiota and the CNS. Second, we defined the role
of the gut microbiota in ASD. Finally, we described some
potential therapies for modulating the gut microbiota in
patients with ASD. Many recent clinical studies have shown
that treatments that regulate the gut microbiota result in
improvements in ASD symptoms (Critchfield et al., 2011;
