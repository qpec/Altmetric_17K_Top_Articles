ABSTRACT
We here determine the influence of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy on the progression of solid
tumors. The influence of MSCs was investigated in human colorectal cancer cells as well as in an immu-
nocompetent rat model of colorectal carcinogenesis representative of the human pathology. Treat-
ment with bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs significantly reduced both cancer initiation and cancer
progression by increasing the number of tumor-free animals as well as decreasing the number and the
size of the tumors by half, thereby extending their lifespan. The attenuation of cancer progression was
mediated by the capacity of the MSCs to modulate the immune component. Specifically, in the adeno-
carcinomas (ADKs) of MSC-treated rats, the infiltration of CD68+ monocytes/macrophages was 50%
less while the presence of CD3+ lymphocytes increased almost twofold. The MSCs reprogrammed the
macrophages to become regulatory cells involved in phagocytosis thereby inhibiting the production of
proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the MSCs decreased NK (Natural Killer) and rTh17 cell activi-
ties, Treg recruitment, the presence of CD8+ lymphocytes and endothelial cells while restoring Th17 cell
activity. The expression of miR-150 and miR-7 increased up to fivefold indicating a likely role for these
miRNAs in the modulation of tumor growth. Importantly, MSC administration limited the damage of
healthy tissues and attenuated tumor growth following radiotherapy. Taken together, we here show
that that MSCs have durable action on colon cancer development by modulating the immune compo-
nent of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we identify two miRNAs associated with the capac-
ity of MSCs to attenuate cancer growth. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2019;8:285–300
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Radiotherapy can be accompanied by substantial normal tissue damage. Although mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) have been used to alleviate radiation damage, uncertainty remains regarding
their potential to support growth of residual tumor cells. Administration of MSCs attenuates
colorectal cancer progression in immunocompetent animals in the absence or presence of radio-
therapy as shown here. Although only transiently present in the colon tissue of treated animals,
exogenous MSCs were able to modify the immune profile of the tumor microenvironment even
1 year after the last MSC administration, most likely due to polarization of resident MSCs and
immune cells. These results suggest that administration of MSCs may be a safe and innovative
therapeutic option to heal normal tissue following cancer radiotherapy.
INTRODUCTION
The worldwide number of cancer patients is
expected to increase from 14 million in 2012 to
more than 19 million in 2025 (http://www.wcrf.
org/cancer_statistics/world_cancer_statistics.php).
Sixty percent of all cancer patients receive radia-
tion therapy, which is accompanied by detrimental
local lesions for at least 500,000 patients. The
abdominopelvic area contains major cancer
sites as well as highly radiosensitive organs,
such as the colon and rectum. Late side effects
on the pelvis, that is, pelvic radiation disease
(PRD), are mainly characterized by fibrosis and
are often lethal [1].

TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
 The current treatment of radiotherapy-induced adverse
effects is limited to managing the symptoms; therefore, new
strategies are urgently needed [2]. No detrimental side effects
of treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were
reported in a meta-analysis of 36 clinical trials representing
more than 1,000 patients [3].
In contrast, preclinical tumor models treated with exoge-
nous administration of MSCs have resulted in conflicting
results concerning their influence on tumor development [4].
Depending on the model, it has been suggested that MSCs
either inhibit or increase immunity, angiogenesis and apopto-
sis. One of the reasons for the conflicting results is that most
of these studies used local engraftment of human cancer cell
lines in mouse models. This system is not representative of
the clinical pathology and the tumors are not comparable with
human cancers. Another reason is that most of these studies
have used immunodeficient animals, in particular mice defi-
cient in T lymphocytes [5], although these cells are known to
be important MSC targets for modulation of the tumor micro-
environment [6].
In order to evaluate the interest of MSC administration to
prevent PRD after cancer radiotherapy, an immunocompetent
animal model representative of human cancer development
and treatment is needed to address the essential questions
approximately mechanism, safety, and efficacy. Besides the
cellular component, we have studied miRNAs which play an
important role as effectors in inflammation and tumor progres-
sion via crosstalk with the MSCs in the tumor microenviron-
ment [8].
We now show that MSC administration to immunocompe-
tent rats treated locally with methylnitronitrosoguanidine
(MNNG), a potent carcinogen, decreased tumor progression,
and increased overall survival. At early time points, MSCs
reversed local acute inflammation by protecting the mucosal
structure and function from MNNG. Furthermore, MSC admin-
istration was accompanied by a marked modification of the
tumor microenvironment which was still apparent 1 year after
the last MSC administration. When MSCs were administered
after treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) with fractionated
irradiation, MSCs inhibited residual tumor growth and pro-
longed animal survival. The MSCs also protected healthy tissue
from radiation damage by increasing the levels of growth
factors, decreasing fibrosis, and mediating intestinal recovery.
These results suggest that MSCs induce polarization of resi-
dent MSC and immune cells, thereby attenuating CRC develop-
ment as well as the detrimental side-effects of radiotherapy
on healthy tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and Culture of MSC and CRC Cells
We first used a human coculture model in order to character-
ize the influence of MSCs on CRC cells. This was followed by
in vivo studies to evaluate the influence of bone-marrow
derived MSCs on CRC growth in an immunocompetent rat
model (Figs. 1A, 2A, 2B).
Human CRC cells lines were purchased from European Col-
lection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, U.K.). MSCs were obtained
either from humans or from 7-week-old rats. For coculture, CRC
cells were incubated with MNNG (50 μM, 2 hours). Then, MSCs
and tumor cells were plated in the upper and lower chambers
(24 hours), respectively, of trans-well plates (0.4 mm pore size,
Corning) and coincubated for 24 hours followed by collection of
cells and culture media. The protocol is further detailed in
Figure 1B.
eGFP transgenic rats (strain “green rat CZ-C04 Tg Act eGFP”)
derived from the Sprague-Dawley strain were obtained by the
Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)
from Pr. Otabe (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) with Material
transfer agreement (MTA) and subsequently bred in the IRSN’s
animal housing facility. Rat BM cells were isolated from green
fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic Sprague-Dawley rats via
femoral bone aspiration and expanded until the first passage [8].
At passage one, cells were detached at 80% confluence and
added to 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented
with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
and injected intravenously into the tail vein.
To further characterize the alterations observed in vivo in
miRNA expression, a coculture model was used (Fig. 3B).
CC531 cell line was established from a dimethylhydrazine
(DMH)-induced rat colon ADK. CC531 cell line was plated in
the lower chambers of trans-well plates. Then, MSCs with or
without peripheral blood rat mononuclear cells were plated in
the upper chambers and coincubated for 24 hours.
Oxidative Stress
Oxidative DNA damage can trigger tumor initiation. 8-Hydroxy-20-
deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is produced by oxidative damage of
DNA by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, including hydroxyl
radical and peroxynitrite. Formation of 8-OHdG DNA adducts was
measured using the Oxidative DNA Damage OxiSelect ELISA Kit
(Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA 92126, USA).
DNA Fragmentation
MNNG is genotoxic toward human CRC cells as shown by sin-
gle cell electrophoresis under alkaline conditions (the alkaline
comet assay). This method permits the detection of DNA
strand breaks and alkali-labile sites in individual cells with the
percentage of DNA in the comet tail being proportional to the
induction of DNA strand breaks. Genotoxic activity was deter-
mined using a comet assay kit (Trevigen 4253-096-K). Data are
expressed as the percentage of DNA in the tail compared with
the total DNA) [9].
Animals
All experiments were performed in compliance with French laws
for animal experiments (Act no. 92-333 of October 2, 2009) and
approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Experimentation
“CEEA number 810 (Protocol numbers: P09-10)”.
In a first set of experiment (Fig. 2A, 2B) Sprague-Dawley
rats (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were divided
into three groups. The first group was injected with a saline
solution (control), second group was injected with MNNG, but
not with MSCs, and the third group received both MNNG
and MSCs.
In a second set of experiments (Fig. 6A) rats were divided
into two batches, each with three groups. The first batch was
not irradiated while the second batch received fractioned
colorectal irradiation for a total dose of 75 Gy. Thirty rats were
injected with MNNG, but not with MSCs, and 30 rats received
both MNNG and MSCs.

 Carcinogenesis and MSC Treatment
MNNG was administered by four intrarectal deposits of 0.5 ml
of a 5 mg/ml solution over 2 weeks as described [10]. After
MNNG treatment, 107 MSCs were injected into the tail vein of
anesthetized animals.
The
irradiated
animals
received
three
intravenous
injections of MSCs (one per month) at weeks 36, 40, and 44.
Survival, modifications of the mucosa and the development of
colonic tumors were determined at 7, 10, 32, and 52 weeks
after MNNG treatment and at 60 weeks for the irradiated
groups. Tumors collected 52 weeks after MNNG treatment
were classified by tumor node metastasis (TNM) after exami-
nation at necropsy and by histology.
Radiation and MSC Treatment
Next, we evaluated the influence of MSC treatment on the
response to radiotherapy. Thirty weeks after the first MMNG
administration, rats were exposed to a γ-ray source with a
radiation (60Co, 1 Gy/minute) field confined to the colorectum
(field size: 2 cm × 2.5 cm). Radiation was delivered three
times a week in 5-Gy fractions at a total dose of 75 Gy. One
week after the last irradiation, 107 MSCs were injected intrave-
nously into the tail vein of anesthetized animals. The radiation
response, animal survival, modification of the mucosa, and the
development of colonic tumors were determined 25 days after
the last irradiation. The protocol is further detailed in
Figure 6B. Fractioned radiation was delivered as previously
described [11]. One week after the last irradiation, 107 MSCs
were injected intravenously. The protocol is further detailed in
Figure 6B.
Tissue Sampling and Analysis
Proteins were extracted by tissue disruption in ice-cold PBS
containing protease inhibitors. The protein concentration was
assessed using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). To determine whether
MSC administration had an effect on colon cancer develop-
ment, we used the international TNM classification which is
the current clinical standard to estimate the prognosis of CRC
patients [12]. For this study, an anatomopathological analysis
was performed in collaboration with Dr. Betina at the Saint-
Antoine Hospital in Paris, to classify the colon samples col-
lected 52 weeks after carcinogen exposure. To characterize
possible tumor regression, the tumor volume (TV) was deter-
mined using the World Health Organization criteria as follows.
Four intervals were used to describe tumor response: (a) if the
tumor regressed below the detection threshold, the response
was said to be complete; (b) if the tumor was detectable and
the bidimensional measures (height [H] × width [W]), pre-
sented a regression of at least 50%, the response was said to
be partial, (c) if the regression was between 50% and 25%, it
was called stable disease, and finally when growth exceeded
25%, the disease was considered progressive. To evaluate
fibrosis, full length longitudinal tissue sections were analyzed.
Extracellular matrix (ECM) areas were automatically measured
using
Histolab
software
(Microvision
Instruments,
Lisses,
France) to detect Picrosirius stained surfaces (magnification
×40). The percentage of fibrotic area was obtained by dividing
the ECM area by the total tissue surface in each field, which
was manually measured on Histolab.
Statistical Analysis
Values were expressed as mean � SEM and compared using
analysis of variance followed by the Mann–Whitney or Dun-
nett test for group pairwise comparisons. Survival curves were
compared with the Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test. In the
figures, results are expressed as mean � SEM.
RESULTS
The MSC Secretome Does Not Protect CRC Cells
Against Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage After Acute
MNNG Exposure
We first determined if MSCs are able to modulate CRC cells
directly after acute MNNG exposure. MNNG is a DNA alkylat-
ing agent that produces strong oxidative damage followed by
DNA strand breaks, genomic instability, inflammation, and pro-
liferation (Fig. 1A) [13]. We selected three human CRC cell
lines with different defects in DNA damage response and DNA
repair. HT-29 cells show loss of heterozygosity and have
mutant p53, HCT-116 cells have defective mismatch repair
while LS513 cells are intrinsic multidrug resistant. The influ-
ence of the MSC secretome on CRC cell proliferation (Fig. 1C),
oxidative stress (as measured by the presence of oxidative
DNA adducts, Fig. 1D), and DNA damage (as measure by DNA
strand breaks by the comet assay, Fig. 1E) following MNNG
exposure was determined. MNNG exposure was accompanied
by the formation of oxidative DNA adducts (Fig. 1D, red col-
umns), induction of DNA strand breaks (Fig. 1E, red columns)
and inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 1C, red curves, compared
with untreated control cells in black) for the three cell lines
(Fig. 1). A similar experiment without MSCs in the upper
chamber was used as negative control. In addition, we
checked that no MSCs had reached the lower chamber. Coex-
posure with MSCs decreased the levels of oxidative DNA
adducts in a nonsignificant manner (Fig. 1D, blue columns)
and had no detectable influence on the levels of DNA strand
breaks (Fig. 1E, blue columns) or cell proliferation (Fig. 1C,
blue curves). It should be noted, that since a trans-well assay
was used in order to be able to separate CRC and MSC cells
following coincubation, the data reflects the influence of the
MSC secretome on MNNG-exposed CRC cells, but not potential
heterotypic cell–cell interactions.
Transient Presence of MSCs in the Colon
MSCs were administered twice (5 million by i.v. injection)
4 and 6 weeks after the initiation of MNNG treatment
(Fig. 2A, 2B). The first injection was carried out 2 weeks after
the last MNNG injection to prevent early damages. The doses
of MSCs as well as the repeated injections were chosen
according to our previous study which demonstrated a cumu-
lative effect of repeated MSC injections [14–16]. The presence
of exogenous MSCs in the colon was verified using an eGFP
tag (Fig. 2C, left panel, indicated by white arrows) at 7 weeks
after administration. The GFP signal was weak (Fig. 2C, left)
and needed amplification in order to permit the visualization
of the GFP-MSCs present in tissue (Fig. 2C, right). Amplification
of the signal by use of anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 2C, right panel
indicated by white arrows) revealed the transient presence of
scarce GFP-labeled cells (indicated in red) localized in (a) the

 lamina propria, (b) around the bottom of crypts in the muscu-
laris mucosae, and (c) in the submucosa, 1 week after the sec-
ond MSC injection, but not at later time points. The transient
implantation of eGFP-MSCs was further confirmed by PCR of
the eGFP gene in extracts from fixed colon tissue (3.4 � 1.4
copies of eGFP per 10 ng of DNA, n = 6, data not shown).
MSCs Prevent the Early Damages Induced by MNNG
We decided to study the early effect of MNNG at 7 weeks
based on our previous study [10, 12]. MNNG induced an alter-
ation of the mucosal structure at 7 weeks after administration
(Fig. 2D) as indicated by histological alterations of the mucosa,
distortion of the crypts, and immune infiltration (compare con-
trols [left] with MNNG [middle]), which was attenuated by
administration of MSCs (right). The number of crypts per
micrometre, the height of the crypts as well as the number of
goblet cells per crypt were significantly (p < .01) reduced by
MNNG and corresponded to 88%, 80%, and 73% of control
values, respectively (Fig. 2E, red columns), whereas MSC
administration (blue columns) restored the values to the initial
levels (white columns). Ki67 expression (in red), reflecting the
proliferation of mucosal cells, is shown in Figure 2F (left
image, MNNG; right image, MNNG + MSCs). The analysis of
labeled cells as a fraction of the total number of epithelial cells
is shown in Figure 2F (right). The expression of Ki67 increased
significantly (p = .0429) in the MNNG mucosa (4.1 � 0.2 positive
cells/μm2,
red
column),
compared
with
control
animals
(3.3 � 0.2 positive cells/μm2, white column) while MSC admin-
istration
restored
Ki67
expression
to
normal
levels
(3.0 � 0.2 positive cells/μm2, blue column).
MSCs Modulate the Inflammatory Response During the
Early Phase of MNNG-Induced Carcinogenesis
The inflammatory response after MNNG treatment is believed
to play a pivotal role in cancer initiation. At the early phase of
the experiment (1 week after the second MSC injection),
MNNG induced inflammation and mucosal damage, which was
attenuated by MSC administration (Figs. 2D–2F, 3A). In addi-
tion, MNNG induced a systemic inflammation (p < .001), as
evidenced by the serum concentration of C-reactive protein
(CRP) which increased almost sixfold (Fig. 3A, left panel, red
column). Locally, the protein levels in the mucosa increased for
IL-6 (17-fold, p < .001), IL-1β (2.1-fold, p < .001), IL-4 (3.2-fold,
p < .001), TGFβ1 (2-fold, p = 0,037), TNF-α (4-fold, p = .021),
and IFNγ (1.8-fold, p = .030; Fig. 3A, red columns). The presence
of MSCs restored the concentration of CRP and mucosal IL-6,
IL-1β, IL-4, TNF-α, and IFNγ to basal levels (Fig. 3A, blue
columns compared with control samples, white columns) while
TGFβ increased, clearly indicating an anti-inflammatory activity
of the MSCs. These differences were significant (p < .05).
Gene expression analysis of inflammatory modulators pre-
sent in the mucosa of animals treated with MNNG + MSCs
compared with mucosa from animals treated with MNNG
alone further confirmed our findings (Fig. 3A, upper table).
The mRNA of several proinflammatory genes including IL-1β
(0.3-fold), IL-6 (0.2-fold), TNF-α (0.4-fold), and MIP-2 (0.1-fold)
were significantly downregulated, whereas the mRNA of the
anti-inflammatory genes IL-10 (1.9-fold), and TGFβ (1.9-fold)
were upregulated. Immunomodulation of the MSCs was asso-
ciated with a decrease in the mRNA of T-Bet (0.2-fold), TLR4
(0.4-fold), and an increase in the mRNA of Arginase-1 (Arg1,
1.7-fold),
GATA3
(1.4-fold),
FoxP3
(1.6-fold),
and
TLR5
(1.8-fold). These differences were significant (p < .05). These
findings suggest that the MSCs predominantly stimulated cells
of the T cell (GATA3), Treg (IL-10, FoxP3), and M2 (TNF-α,
Arg1, TLR4) phenotypes. In addition, the increase in the
expression of TFF3 (twofold) indicates that the MSCs restored
the functionality of the mucosa in agreement with the histo-
logical findings.
MicroRNAs are involved in gene regulation and their aber-
rant expression has been implicated in various pathologies
including cancer. To determine miRNA expression early after
MNNG treatment, miRNA profiles were analyzed by the Affyme-
trix GeneChip miRNA Array 2.0. The expression of miRNAs with
altered expression was subsequently confirmed by qRT-PCR.
MicroRNA profiling revealed nine microRNAs that were differen-
tially
expressed
between
the
mucosa
from
MNNG
and
MNNG + MSC animals by 7 weeks, which was confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A). This included seven miRNAs that increased
significantly in the mucosa of animals treated with MNNG + MSC,
compared with MNNG alone, including miR-150 (4.7-fold), miR-
142.5p (3.9-fold), miR-7.1 (2.9-fold), miR-92A (2.1-fold), miR-17
(1.8-fold), miR-15b (1.7-fold), miR-128 (1.7-fold), while two miR-
NAs decreased significantly including (miR-19b 0.3-fold), and
miR-191 (0.2-fold; Fig. 3A, lower table). The increase in IL-10,
miR-92a, TLR3, and miR-17 as well as the decrease in TLR4
and IL-6 transcripts suggest a polarization of resident MSCs
into the MSC2 phenotype. These differences were signifi-
cant (p < .05).
In order to clarify the interaction between MSCs, cancer
cells and inflammatory cells, a coculture model was used to
characterize the alterations in miRNA expression in the cancer
cells without ambiguity (Fig. 3B). As experimental model sys-
tem, we chose the classic CC531 cell line, originally established
from a DMH-induced rat colon ADK which is a widely used
model to study different aspects of tumor growth. A coculture
model was used where the CC531 cells were plated in the
lower chambers of trans-well plates. Then, MSCs in the
absence or presence of rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were plated in the upper chambers and the cells
were coincubated for 24 hours. PBMCs were used to test the
influence of inflammatory cells on the MSC-tumor cell cross-
talk. The presence of MSCs resulted in increased levels of miR-
150 (4.2-fold � 0.2) and miR-7.1 (2.7-fold � 0.2) in CC531 cells
compared with CC531 alone. The presence of both MSCs and
PBMCs, increased the levels of miR-150 (5.1-fold � 0.3), miR-
142.5 (4.2-fold � 0.2), miR-7.1 (3.1-fold � 0.2) and miR-128
(2.5-fold � 0.2) compared with CC531 cells alone. These differ-
ences were significant (p < .05). Therefore, the presence of
MSCs or MSCs + PMBCs had a significant influence on the
expression of miRNA in surrounding CRC cells. Interestingly,
the results suggest that the crosstalk between the MSCs and
immune cells can influence the tumor cells, since neither MSCs
nor PMBCs by themselves had any influence on the expression
of miRNA-142.5 and miR-128 although their expression was
increased when MSCs and PBMCs were together.
MSC Administration Modifies the Phenotype of
Immune Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment
One year after the initial MNNG exposure, the tumor microen-
vironment of animals treated with MNNG alone was very
different from that of animals exposed to MNNG + MSCs. In

 particular, in the tumor, the density of cells expressing the
T-cell marker CD3 was 0.69% � 0.03% compared with
1.0% � 0.05% for MNNG and MNNG + MSCs tumors, respec-
tively (p < .001) Therefore, the density of CD3+ cells was 30%
higher in the tumors of MSCs-treated rats (Fig. 4A, upper
panels). In contrast, the density of cells expressing the macro-
phage marker CD68 was 50% lower (p < .001) in tumors from
animals treated with MNNG + MSCs (0.8% � 0.1%) compared
with the tumors of animals treated with MNNG alone
(1.6% � 0.1%; Fig. 4B, left panels).
The expression of cytokines and transcription factors
(Fig. 4C, bottom left) showed highly significant differences
between tumors from animals treated with MNNG or with
MNNG + MSCs compared with nonirradiated animals not
exposed to MSCs. The MSC-mediated increase in mRNA
expression between MNNG and MNNG + MSCs tumors was
particularly prominent (p < .01) for IFNγ (3.0-fold � 0.3),
IL-12a
(3.4-fold
�
0.3),
IL-12b
(2.1-fold
�
0.2), T-bet
(1.9-fold � 0.2), IL-1β (2.5-fold � 0.1), IL-7 (1.8-fold � 0.05),
and Notch1 (2.1-fold � 0.2; Fig. 4A, bottom left). In contrast,
MSC administration decreased the mRNA levels for IL-4
(0.18-fold � 0.03) and STAT6 (0.66-fold � 0.01), whereas
GATA3 levels were slightly increased (1.5-fold � 0.07). The
ratio between IL-4 and IFNγ was reduced by a factor of 6.6
(p < .001) while the ratio between T-bet and GATA3 was
increased (p < .001) by a factor of 2.4 (Fig. 4A, lower right).
These findings suggest a predominance of the Th1 phenotype
in MNNG + MSCs tumors.
The expression of other genes involved in the regulation of
the tumor microenvironment is shown in Figure 4C. A compari-
son of MNNG and MNNG + MSCs tumors reveals that MSC
administration was accompanied by a significant decrease
(p < .001) in the mRNA levels of TGFβ1 (0.5-fold � 0.02), IL6
(0.4-fold
�
0.02),
STAT3
(0.3-fold
�
0.01)
and
IL-17a
(0.39-fold � 0.04), suggesting a low activity of differentiated
Th17 cells. Th17 cells have key functions in the induction of the
tissue inflammation and in promoting tumorigenesis. Compari-
son of genes typical for Treg cells showed that MSC treatment
significantly (p < .001) increased the mRNA levels of Foxp3
(2.4-fold � 0.1), IL-10 (3.8-fold � 0.4), and IL-2 (2.0-fold � 0.3).
The higher levels of IL-2 in MSC-treated tumors are coherent
with a stimulation of Treg cells. In addition, the expression of
M1 macrophage-related genes including iNOS (3.9-fold � 0.08),
Arg1 (0.5-fold � 0.03), TLR2 (1.4-fold � 0.07), and TLR4
(1.6-fold � 0.04) increased, whereas the expressions of IL-8
(0.67-fold � 0.02) and TNF-α (0.64-fold � 0.05) decreased
(Fig. 4C). The increase in TLR4 and the decrease in TLR3 suggest
a polarization of resident MSCs into the MSC2 phenotype.
MSC Administration Limits the Number and the
Growth of Colon Tumors Following Carcinogen
Treatment
The appearance of the tumors in control animals (without
MNNG), in MNNG-treated animals and in animals treated with
MNNG + MSCs by 52 weeks is shown in Figure 5A. Quantitative
analysis (Fig. 5B) shows that both the number and frequency of
tumors per rat was significantly reduced in animals treated with
MSCs at 32 weeks (p = .022) as well as at 52 weeks (p = .0257).
In addition, there were significantly (p = .048) more tumor-free
rats
in
the
MNNG
+
MSC
group
indicating
that
the
administration of MSCs attenuated tumor initiation thereby
decreasing the number of tumors per rat.
The average size of tumors by 32 weeks was not signifi-
cantly different for MNNG + MSC animals and animals treated
with MNNG alone. However, at 52 weeks, the tumor size was
three times less in animals injected with MSCs (34 mm2) com-
pared with animals treated with MNNG alone (106 mm2;
p = .0053, Fig. 5C). Similarly, at 52 weeks, the expression of Ki67
mRNA as measured by qRT-PCR was lower (0.76-fold � 0.04) in
tumors from the MNNG + MSCs group than for the MNNG
group, suggesting a long-term effect of the MSCs on tumor
proliferation.
At 52 weeks, the invasion of tumor cells was limited to the
submucosa. In reference to the TNM nomenclature for human
tumors, only carcinoma in situ (Tis), Nx (invasion of the
regional lymph nodes was not evaluated), M0 (absence of
remote metastases), and T1 (tumor less than 2 cm in its larg-
est part) Nx M0 tumors were observed at this stage (Fig. 5D,
animal treated with MSCs). In addition, MSC treatment
resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in tumor grade.
MSC Administration Significantly Increased the Survival
of MNNG-Treated Animals
The influence of MSC administration on the overall survival is
shown in Figure 5D. MNNG treatment significantly (p < .01)
reduced the life span of rats (Fig. 5E, red line, median survival
55 weeks), compared with the untreated control animals
(black line, 165 weeks). In clear contrast, the injection of MSCs
significantly increased (p = .018) the survival of MNNG-treated
animals (blue line, median survival 95 weeks).
MSC Administration Significantly Decreased Tumor Size
and Increased Survival in Animals After Fractioned
Irradiation
Our experimental protocol was based on a clinical case where
patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer by accident
received more than 70 Gy on the rectum. Four patients received
repeated intravenous injection of allogenic MSCs resulting in pro-
tective effects on proctitis and rectitis [17]. One year after radia-
tion, colonoscopy revealed the presence of congested mucosa,
telangiectasia and large area of fibrosis. These patients were
subsequently treated successfully by intravenous injection of
MSCs. A new phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of
systemic MSC injections for the treatment of chronic radiotherapy-
induced abdomino-pelvic complications is scheduled to start this
year (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02814864).
To characterize the influence of MSCs on residual tumors
after radiotherapy as well as their effect on healthy tissue, we
used three groups of MNNG-treated rats as outlined in
Figure 6A. Thirty-two weeks later, when adenomas had
appeared, two groups were irradiated with 75 Gy. The 32 week
timepoint was chosen because large carcinomas such as those
present at 52 weeks are typically treated with surgery, rather
than with radiotherapy, in clinical practice. A dose range of
55–105 Gy was tested and a dose of 75 Gy was retained since
higher doses of irradiation strongly increased animal mortality.
The dose per fraction (5 Gy) was selected on the basis of
irradiator occupancy criteria taking into account the size of the
groups of animals. One week after the last irradiation, one
group of animals received three intravenous injections of
MSCs. At the time fibrosis had developed (26 weeks after

 irradiation and 60 weeks after the first MNNG treatment),
tumors were removed for histological and molecular character-
ization while the remaining animals were used to determine
the influence of the different treatments on the overall
survival (Fig. 6B).
Fractionated irradiation reduced the size of the tumors four-
fold (20 mm2 � 2) compared with the nonirradiated control
group (82 mm2 � 20; p < .01). Importantly, MSC administration
further decreased the size of the tumors (p = .028) more than
twofold (9 mm2 � 3), compared with irradiation alone (Fig. 6C).
MSC treatment significantly (p < .01) increased the life
span of rats after irradiation (Fig. 6D, blue line median survival

(red line median survival 40 weeks after irradiation). The

MSC Administration Decreased Fibrosis and Prevented
Tissue Degradation After Fractioned Irradiation
Chronic radiation damage is characterized by an aberrantly
repair process associated with chronic inflammation, excessive
collagen accumulation, and vascular disorganization resulting
in fibrosis, which may lead to organ dysfunction and occlusion
[1]. Accordingly, fractionated irradiation alone induced an
alteration of the mucosal structure as indicated by distortion
of the crypts, submucosal edema and immune infiltration and
accumulation of components of the ECM (Fig. 6E, compare
irradiated tissue [middle panels] with nonirradiated normal tis-
sue [left panels]). These changes were attenuated following
MSC exposure (right panels).
Morphometric analysis showed that the height of the
crypts
per
micrometre
(348
crypts/μm
in
average
vs. 268 crypts/μm) as well as the number of goblet cells per
crypt (24 per crypt vs. 18 per crypt in average) were signifi-
cantly (p < .001) increased in irradiated colons (Fig. 6F, red col-
umns) compared with nonirradiated controls (white columns)
while MSC administration restored basal levels to 288 crypts/
μm and the goblet cells to 18 per crypt in average (blue col-
umns). The crypt number per 300 μm was significantly
(p < .01) decreased after irradiation (4.1 crypts/300 μm in
average, red column) compared with nonirradiated controls
(mean 5.2 crypts/300 μm in average, white column) without
any detectable effects of the MSCs on the irradiated group
(4.2 crypts/300 μm in average).
Fractioned irradiation promoted fibrosis (Fig. 6G, red col-
umn, 14% in average) whereas MSC administration significantly
decreased fibrosis (blue column, 7.1% in average) to similar
levels as the nonirradiated controls (white column, 6.8% in aver-
age). Therefore, MSC administration limited fibrosis progression
and prevented mucosal damage clearly suggesting an antifibro-
sis and mucosa-protective effect of the MSCs against tissue
damage induced by fractionated irradiation.
Upregulation
of
ECM
components,
ECM
degrading
enzymes (MMPs: Matrix Metalloproteinases) and their inhibi-
tors (TIMPs: Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases) are
known to cause a defect in ECM turnover inducing fibrosis
[18]. On the molecular level, fractioned irradiation increased
significantly protein levels of TGFβ (2.1-fold, p < .01) and
TIMP1 (2.2-fold, p < .001; Fig. 7A). MSC treatment also nor-
malized TGFβ compared with control and decreased TIMP1
compared with irradiated (p < .01), but increased the concen-
tration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 4.1-fold
(p < .01), compared with basal levels (control), coherent with
the influence of MSCs on fibrosis.
Gene expression analysis did not show any significant influ-
ence of MSC treatment on the expression levels of the proin-
flammatory genes IL-1β, IFNγ, and TNF-α following irradiation
(Fig. 7B). In contrast, the expression of TGFβ decreased 1.8-fold
(p < .01) while the expression significantly (p < .01) increased
for TFF3 (1.6-fold), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 2-fold,
p < .01), and VEGF (1.6-fold, p < .01). HGF is a potent antifibro-
tic protein with pleiotropic activities including immunosuppres-
sion and inhibition of TGFβ signaling whereas trefoil factor
3 (TFF3)-mediates regeneration of an epithelial barrier after
mucosal injury [18]. These findings indicate that the MSCs
restored the functionality of the mucosa while limiting fibrosis
progression, in agreement with the histological findings.
DISCUSSION
Radiotherapy is an essential therapeutic option for a wide
range of tumor types. However, some patients develop toxic
side-effects due to normal tissue damage. In particular, PRD
remains a major problem which is only treated symptomati-
cally [1]. The digestive symptoms of PRD are similar to those
observed in the so-called bowel disease as well as for the vis-
ceral disorders related to graft versus host disease (GVHD)
where
administration
of
MSCs
emerge
as
a
promising
approach to alleviate the gastrointestinal syndromes [18].
Although MSC administration is also able to alleviate tissue
damage in irradiated animal models, conflicting data exist con-
cerning their potential influence on residual tumor cells [17].
Contradictory results may be explained by the fact that the
majority of in vitro studies were carried out in immunodefi-
cient mouse models which are not able to reproduce the
immunomodulatory effects of MSCs on resident immune cells.
In addition, most studies focused on orthotopic tumor xeno-
grafts rather than on endogenous tumor development. We
here evaluate the influence of MSCs on tumor growth in an
immunocompetent rat model following local exposure to a
chemical carcinogen in the presence or absence of fraction-
ated radiotherapy and describe the underlying molecular
mechanisms. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of MSCs on
tumor development, the inflammatory/immune response and
the tumor microenvironment from CRC initiation to its com-
plete development over an entire year. The results show for
the first time that intravenous administration of MSCs increase
the life span of carcinogen-exposed rats which display less
tumors (tumor initiation) as well as decreased tumor size
(tumor progression), indicating that the exogenous MSCs dura-
bly inhibited both CRC initiation and progression [19].
To mimic human colon carcinogenesis, which is a long-term
process, we selected an immunocompetent MNNG-induced CRC
rat model. MNNG exposure induced the formation of oxidative
DNA adducts and DNA strand breaks. The MNNG model is rele-
vant for human carcinogenesis since rectal administration of
MNNG mimic the detrimental action of alimentary nitroso-
compounds [20] that are closely associated with the induction
of CRC with a physiopathology similar to that observed in
humans [21]. Furthermore, intrarectal administration of MNNG

 act only on the colon mucosa [22] in contrast to carcinogenesis
induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine or azoxymethane which also
induce tumors in other tissues [23].
The most prominent early effect of MNNG is induction of
inflammation which has been closely linked to tumor initiation
[12]. Inflammation is accompanied by mucosal lesions as
evidenced by a decrease in the number of mucus-secreting
cells as well as a decrease in crypt number, crypt height, and
the number of goblet mucus-secreting cells which may result
in colon dysfunction. The influence of MSC administration is
summarized in Figure 5F. MSCs seem to decrease CRC initia-
tion via the immune system rather than by a direct effect on
Figure 7.

 the tumor cells. Specifically, the MSCs showed only marginal
effect on MNNG-mediated oxidative stress, DNA damage and
cell proliferation in isolated CRC cells.
MSCs modulate the MNNG-induced inflammation, at least in
part, by lowering the local IL-6 concentrations, since IL-6 is impli-
cated in tumor initiation in inflammatory bowel disease [24]. Fur-
thermore, MSC treatment protected the structure of the colon
epithelium by reducing the ulcerations caused by MNNG [12,
25]. These early effects of MSCs, which counteract the deleteri-
ous action of MNNG, are likely associated with TGFβ- and/or
TFF3-dependent tissue repair in agreement with the results pre-
sented here. Indeed, these two regulatory peptides can stimulate
the restitution on the basolateral (TGFβ) and apical (TFF) sides of
the colon mucosa via independent pathways [25]. Finally, the
administration of MSCs restored gut morphology and function in
agreement with previous findings [26–28].
We then characterized the expression of miRNAs that have
been implicated in modulating tumor initiation. The microRNA
expression profile identified nine microRNAs that were differ-
entially expressed. To clarify the interplay between tumor
cells, MSCs and immune cells, an in vitro model was used. The
results show that the presence of MSCs increased the levels of
miR-150 and miR-7.1 in the tumor cells. Interestingly, the joint
presence of MSCs and inflammatory cells specifically increased
tumor cell expression of miR-142.5 and miR-128 pointing to
the importance of crosstalk between MSCs and inflammatory
cells. The inhibition of MNNG-induced inflammation by the
MSCs was reflected by an increase in miR-150 and miR-7.1
that are known to inhibit inflammation in sepsis (miR-150) and
gastritis (miR-7.1), and a decrease in miR-19b, that has been
associated with increased inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis
[29]. Similarly, MSCs induced an increase in antioncogenic miR-
NAs (miRs 150, 142-5p, 7.1, 15b, 128, and 17) and a decrease
in pro-oncogenic miRNAs (miRs 19b and 191]. Interestingly,
miR-17 is produced by MSC2s and negatively regulates expres-
sion of Smurf1 [30], a potential oncogene that has been impli-
cated in CRC [31]. Taken together, the results indicate that
MSCs
inhibited
tumor
initiation
by
preventing
MNNG-
mediated inflammation thereby protecting the colon and
decreasing the number of tumors. The inhibition of tumor ini-
tiation by MSCs is in agreement with a previous report in a rat
model treated with a different carcinogen [19, 32], although
the cited study did not include a characterization of local
inflammation or epithelial function.
Next, we characterized the long-term influence of MSCs on
the tumor microenvironment, a known participant in tumor
development [33] and the composition of tumor-infiltrating
immune cells which may become a prognostic tool [34].
Indeed, a comparison of tumors induced by MNNG alone with
those developed after treatment with both MNNG and MSCs
showed important differences.
By 52 weeks, MNNG-induced tumors treated with MSCs
(MNNG + MSCs) were infiltrated with more CD3+ lymphocytes
compared with MNNG-induced tumors. MSCs directed the
lymphocyte response
toward a
Th1/Treg. The increased
expression of IL-10, TGFβ, Foxp3, and IL-1β suggests an impor-
tant Treg population activated by the high level of IL-2 in the
microenvironment. FoxP3+ Tregs have been associated with a
better prognosis in CRC while the Th1 response has been
shown to be anticarcinogenic in CRC [35]. Decrease expression
of IL-17a suggested a decrease of Th17 cell activity. This result
is in agreement with Yoshida et al. who suggested that a
decreased of Th17 expression may improve the survival of CRC
patients [36]. Human colon carcinoma tumors infiltrated with
more CD3+ cells, presenting a high Th1 adaptive cluster have a
better prognosis. Similarly, patients with high levels of T-Bet
and FoxP3 showed better survival while no correlation was
observed with respect to the Th2 gene cluster [35].
In comparison, the number of infiltrating CD68+ macro-
phages decreased in MNNG + MSCs tumors. High levels of TAMs
(tumor-associated macrophages) are generally correlated with a
nonfavorable outcome in various cancers including CRC [37].
The lower levels of CD68-positive cells may explain the
decreased expression of IL-8 mRNA (which is implicated in the
carcinogenic process) [38]. It is generally accepted that macro-
phages may be activated into M1 (classical) or M2 (alternative)
subtypes. A switch from M1 to M2 macrophages has been
described during tumor progression [39]. We found an increase
in iNOs, TLR2, and TLR4 expression in MNNG + MSCs tumors,
suggesting a differentiation toward the M1 subtype [40]. In
agreement, MNNG + MSCs tumors exhibited low levels of
STAT6, Arg1, and IL-4 suggesting a low degree of M2 differentia-
tion [41]. Furthermore, the inhibition of tumor growth observed
in MNNG + MSCs-treated animals was associated with an
increased expression of perforin (secreted by NK and cytotoxic T
cells), FasL, and iNOs (which contribute to tumor cell killing).
Expression levels of IL-6 and STAT3 were low in MNNG + MSCs
tumors. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that
STAT3 may have oncogenic activities [42]. In addition, high
levels of STAT3 and IL-6 have been associated with CRC progres-
sion [43]. Therefore, our results are in full agreement with the
current understanding of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.
PRD is characterized by severe gastrointestinal disorders.
Radiation-induced colorectal damage involves severe mucosal
damage, chronic inflammation and activation of the profibrotic
transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)/Smad pathway, which
is a major contributor to the fibrogenic process [44]. In this
study we selected a rat model of fractionated γ-irradiation
[11] which is considered to be representative of the colonic
irradiation damage observed in patients [14]. Importantly,
administration of MSCs after radiotherapy decreased the size
of residual tumors and protected colon integrity, thereby
improving animal survival. This model of colorectal irradiation
generates histopathological lesions similar to those observed
clinically during the severe chronic phase. In this model, MSCs
promoted intestinal regeneration after irradiation in agree-
ment with the multiple therapeutic effects of MSCs including
stimulation of proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation
of angiogenesis and a large range of anti-inflammatory activi-
ties [18]. Our results highlights a dynamic progression of ECM
remodeling with a balance toward fibrogenesis in irradiated
tissues which is counteracted by MSC administration coherent
with previous findings [15, 16]. The regenerative capacity of
MSCs was mediated by secretion of HGF and VEGF. HGF and
TSG-6 are key effectors of MSC-mediated inhibition of fibrosis
by suppressing TGFβ signaling and regulating the polarization
of macrophages. TGFβ signaling has pleiotropic activities on
the immune system, tissue regeneration and fibrosis [44] and
can thus play multiple roles during tumor progression depen-
dent on the context. Taken together, these data support the
capacity of MSCs to establish a normal microenvironment after
irradiation by acting on endogenous tissue cells.

MSC-Mediated Polarization Limits Carcinogenesis
 Interestingly,
the
presence
of
exogenous
MSCs
was
observed only at early time points after injection. In the tumor
microenvironment, administered MSCs interact with resident
cells and tumor cells resulting in a complex crosstalk. Tunnel-
ing nanotube-mediated intercellular crosstalk and mitochon-
dria transfer between MSCs, cancer cells and resident immune
cells may also modulate tumor response and the inflammatory
environment [45]. MSCs can polarize into two distinct pheno-
types. TLR4-primed MSCs secrete proinflammatory mediators
while TLR3-primed MSCs express immunosuppressive effec-
tors. Thus, MSCs can be classified in proinflammatory and
immunocompetent MSC1 and immunosuppressive MSC2 [46].
Therefore, the durable antitumor effects of the MSCs observed
is most likely explained by “reprogramming” of resident
immune cells by the MSCs via epigenetic mechanisms, in
agreement with the “hit and run” mechanism suggested by
Von Bahr et al. [7].
Our results suggest that at early time points, MSCs promotes
an anti-inflammatory response via polarization of resident MSCs
into anti-inflammatory MSC2s decreasing tumor initiation. At
later time points, we observed polarization of resident macro-
phages into the M1 subtype in agreement with the findings of
Eggenhofer et al. [48] who reported that MSCs are able to
induce M1 polarization of resident macrophages, thereby induc-
ing a microenvironment unfavorable to tumor progression.
CONCLUSION
The results presented here show that administration of MSCs
increase the life span of carcinogen-exposed rats by attenuat-
ing both CRC initiation and progression. Considering the tran-
sient presence of the MSCs this is likely mediated by
polarization of resident immune cells which in turn interferes
with tumor growth. After fractionated irradiation, MSCs inhib-
ited residual tumor growth, protected healthy tissue and pro-
longed animal survival. These findings support the use of MSC
administration for treatment of severe radiation damage in
patients.
