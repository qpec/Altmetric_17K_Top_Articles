Purpose: Appropriate medio-lateral (ML) stability is an important factor of good clinical outcome following
total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesized that a newly introduced Bi-Cruciate Stabilized substituting
(BCS) prosthesis reduces the medio-lateral instability in mid-flexion range. The purpose of this study was to
measure the ML stability (varus ligament balance) using a new tensor device after implantation of BCS TKA
and to analysis the association between varus ligament balance and clinical results after TKA.
Materials and methods: We evaluated 33 patients who underwent 39 Journey. 2. BCS TKA using the
measured resection technique. We measured the gaps after implantation from extension to full flexion
with reduced patella byconstant distraction force with 120N. The varus ligament balance gap was defined
as the gap calculated by subtracting from Lateral to medial component gap. The clinical results at 2years
after operation was compared with intraoperative varus ligament balance.
Results: Varus ligament balance showed its maximum gap at full knee extension and 120� flexion. Varus
ligament balance at 30�, 60� and 90� of flexionwere significant differences in the varus ligament balance at
full extension. [4_TD$DIF](* p < 0.05). The varus ligament balance gap was negatively corrected with postoperative
2011 Knee society score (patient’s satisfaction) (r = 0.661, p = 0.001).
Conclusions: The most important findings of the present study are that BCS TKA can reduces the ML
instability in mid-flexion range, and improve simultaneously the patient’s satisfaction.
Level of evidence: Therapeutic study, Level III.

Normal knee kinematic presents internal rotation of tibia up to
80� of knee flexion, femoral external rotation (approximately 20�–
30�), femoral roll-back motion, and smooth patella tracking when
tibial tubercle meets femoral groove in line (the mechanism
known as medial pivot movement). Previous study showed that in
flexing of knee from 0 to 120� the medial femoral condyle moved
little, the lateral moved posteriorly by 17 mm by analysing sections
of distal femurs in the computer. 1 and, in passive motion of the
normal cadaveric knee using MRI, the medial femoral tibial
compartment is in the form of “[5_TD$DIF][1_TD$DIF]ball in socket”, the lateral femoral
tibial compartment is in the form of “Mixed rooling and spinning
with four-bar linkage.
2 Recently, guided motion total knee
arthroplasty (TKA) implants that induce medial pivot movement
have been introduced to the market such as the implant with a
3�-equivalent
step
between
femoral
component
and
tibial
polyethylene insert, and the tibial polyethylene insert with ball-
in socket type medially and semi-compatible arch type laterally at
the articulation surface. However, they were all ACL deficient
knees, and whether induction of medial pivot motion will occur or
not is unclear. Journey. 2. Bi-Cruciate Stabilized prosthesis has two
cam-post mechanism, which substitute for the anterior cruciate
ligament and posterior cruciate ligament, and asymmetrical
geometry of the tibial plateau surface. Therefore Journey.2.BCS
must acquire the medial compartment tightness to induce medial
pivot motion during flexion and extension as well as normal knee.
The joint gap after implantation was loose at the mid-flexion
ranges, especially at 30� of flexion using posterior stabilized (PS)
TKA. 3,4 We hypothesized that a newly introduced Journey. 2. BCS
reduces the medio-lateral (ML) instability in mid-flexion range.
The purpose of this study was to measure the ML stability using a
new
tensor
device
after
implantation
and
to
analysis
the
association between ML instability and clinical results at years
after operation.

operative medial knee osteoarthritis. Major reasons for exclusion
were lateral knee osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis, post-
traumatic osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis of the knee. The pre-
operative demographic deta of the patients are shown in Table 1
1.1. Surgical procedure
In all cases, the TKA surgical procedure was performed by one
author and was minimally invasive surgery, with a skin incision of
8–11 cm. The distal femoral cutting guide block was aligned using
an intra-medullary guide, and the proximal tibia cutting block was
aligned using an extramedullary guide. For the femur and tibia, a
standard 6� valgus angle and posterior inclination 3� angle guide
was used in all patients. The rotational alignment was adjusted to
the surgical epi-condylar axis for the femoral component and
medial third of tibia tuberosity at the level of patellar-tendon
attachment for the tibia component. In addition, femoro-tibial
rotational mismatch was reconfirmed at extension, and anterior
pin fixation of tibial component trials was kept available (Fig. 2).
1.2. Joint gap after implantation (component gap)
The extension gap was measured with the femoral trial
component using force-controlled compartment-specific ligament
tensor device. The tensor device of three parts: an upper seesaw
plate, a lower platform plate, and an extra-articular mainbody and
presents two measurements: medial and lateral joint gap between
the seesaw plate and the platform plate (Fig. 3). The upper plate has

ofpatellarfemoral joint. 5 The amountofforce forpre-tensioningthe
gaps is based on clinical experience of more than 5 years. The medial
and lateral component gap were defined as the gap calculated by
subtracting the selected thickness of the tibial component. Medio-
lateral stability (varus ligament balance) was defined as the gap
calculated by subtracting from Lateral to medial component gap and
were measured at full extension, 30�, 60�, 90�, 120� flexion. The
measurements with the tensor device were obtained four times by
one surgeon, and the average was used for data. All the patients
followed the same post-operative rehabilitation protocol. This
retrospective study was approved by the institutional review boards
of our hospitals, and all patients were given informed consent.
1.3. Assessment of correlations and statistical analysis
The correlations between intraoperative mediaolateral com-
ponent gap, varus ligament balance using a new tensor device and
post-operative flexion angle were evaluated. All measurements
were expressed in the format of mean � standard deviation.
Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to analyze the
strength of correlation (version 24.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Turkey test was used. This
study was approved by the institutional review board of our
facility, and every patient in this study submitted the informed
consent.

 2. Results
The mean medial component gaps were 12.3 �1.6 mm (Fig. 6)
and the lateral component gaps were 15.0 � 2.31 mm (Fig. 7). There
were not significant differences in the mediolateral joint gap
during full extension to 120� flexion (n.s vs full extension). Varus
ligament balance showed its maximum gap at full knee extension
and 120� flexion. No mid-flexion instability was observed at 30�,
60� and 90� of flexion (Fig. 8). There were significant differences in
the mediolateral joint gap during full extension to 120� flexion (n.s
vs full extension). Medial tightness, defined as the value of
maximum medial component gap subtracted by its minimum
value, showed strong negative correlation with knee flexion angle
at post-operative 2 years (r = � 0.688, P < 0.001, Fig. 9). Varus
ligament balance showed a negative correlation at post-operative
2 years (r = � 0.425, P < 0.002, Fig. 10). The varus ligament balance
with 30,60� of flexion angles was negatively corrected with
postoperative 2011 Knee society score (patient’s satisfaction) (r =
� 0.670, p < 0.002, Fig. 11. r = � 0.430, p < 0.001, Fig. 12).
3. Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which
analyzed the relationship between varus ligament balance and
clinical results after implantation of femoral component trial,
patellar component trial, and as polyethylene surface trial as
identical shape of Journey. 2. BCS. The most important findings of
this study were that the medial component gap after implanta-
tion was constant throughout range of motion in Journey.2.BCS
TKA, therefore revealed the acquisition of medial tightness that is
required for medial pivot movement. Subjects could achieve post-
operative flexion of 120�or more when the medial tightness
showed 2 mm or less. A newly BCS TKA improve medio-lateral
instability in mid-flexion range and improve patient’s satisfac-
tion. The anterior shift of femoral component relative to tibial
component, triggered by anterior cam’s anterior stabilizing
mechanism of Journey.2.BCS TKA, did not cause decreases in
the mediolateral component gap at full knee extension due to
projection of component against capsule, and revealed the same
physiological lateral laxity as normal knees. None of our cases
required medial release to equalize medial component gap with
lateral. No instability was identified at mid-flexion range, which
can be found in conventional PS TKA. The varus ligament balance
with 4 mm or more showed to decrease post-operative flexion.
The result also suggested the reduced amount of rollback of
femoral component due to changes in the contact area of anterior
and posterior cam with a post. The advantage of this study was to

significant differences in the lateral joint gap during full extension to 120� flexion (n.s vs full extension). Means and SD were provided.

balance at 30�, 60� and 90� of flexion were significant differences in the varus
ligament balance at full extension. * p < 0.05). The mid-flexion was not recognized

 use the specially designed tensor device which had the same
design as Journey.2.BCS TKA fairly reproduce the conditions after
implantation. We discussed that BCS TKA fairly reproduce the
coronal laxity of the healthy knee, possibly due to the asymmetric
cam mechanism and is a prosthesis that can be expected to
improve patient’s satisfaction. Recent report by kurita et al., 6 has
shown that the postoperative knee joint kinematics especially in
the midflexion range was influenced by the sharpe of articulating
surface of TKA. We believed that our study reproduced the joint
gap kinenmatics after implantation. Bi-cruciate substituting TKA
(Journey.BCS), the former model of Journey.2.BCS design demon-
states femoral rollback at 90� with an average of 14 mm for the
MFC and 23 mm for the LFC, and 10�internal tibial rotation. 7,8,9
Additionally, it provides increased sagittal stability during early
flexion and an improved pivot shift (indicating improved anterior
stabilization). But, Luycks et al. documented the major revision
rate of 2.0% to induce friction between iliotibial band and femoral
component with the grater rotational allowance after implanta-
tion of the Journey.BCS.

In addition, the study on the
comparison of Journey. BCS and Genesis II PS (PS TKA, Smith &
Nephew Inc.: Memphis, TN) found no clinical significance in the

Mugnai et al. reported a comparison of Journey. BCS and Non-
restrictive Geometry (NRG: posterior – stabilized knee system.
Stryker Orthopedics. Inc, Mahwah, NJ) in post-operative 29 months,
and showed the onset of post-operative stiff knee of 2.7% in Journey
BCS versus 0.5% in NRG. The onset of stiff knee, Mungnai et al., was
triggered by the emergence of intra-articular fibrillizations caused
by them mechanical stress towards soft tissue due to excessive
rollback of femoral component. 12 The current study has also
experienced the same issue as Journey 1 BCES among approximately
2% of our subjects (2 out of 94) due to the anterior shift of femoral
component relative tibial component due to the anterior supporting
mechanism of anterior cam. Further countermeasures are required
to be taken in the future cases.
There are several limitations to this study.
First, this is a case-series study with a lack of conrtol subjects.
Second, this study was limited to the medial knee osteoarthritis in
which surgery had been performed with Journey. 2. BCS TKA,
therefore, valgus knee and other diseases cannot be generalized by
our results. Third, there is a possibility that the thickness of cement
mantle, because component gap was measured before cementing.
4. Conclusion
Journey 2 BCS which substitutes the function of ACL and PCL
(anterior and posterior cam post) can acquire the medio-lateral
stability in mid-flexion range and the medial tightness that induces
the same medial pivot movement as the normal knees, and
improve simultaneously the patient’s satisfaction.
