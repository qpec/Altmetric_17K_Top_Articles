Key findings 
Data from the National 
Health Interview Survey 
 
● In 2014, 12.6% of adults had 
ever tried an e-cigarette even 
one time, with use differing by 
sex, age, and race and Hispanic 
or Latino origin.
 
● About 3.7% of adults 
currently used e-cigarettes, with 
use differing by age and race 
and Hispanic or Latino origin.
 
● Current cigarette smokers 
and former smokers who 
quit smoking within the past 
year were more likely to 
use e-cigarettes than former 
smokers who quit smoking 
more than 1 year ago and those 
who had never smoked.
 
● Among current cigarette 
smokers who had tried to quit 
smoking in the past year, more 
than one-half had ever tried 
an e-cigarette and 20.3% were 
current e-cigarette users.
 
● Among adults who had 
never smoked cigarettes, 3.2% 
had ever tried an e-cigarette. 
Ever having used an e-cigarette 
was highest among never 
smokers aged 18–24 (9.7%) 
and declined with age.
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-powered products that typically 
deliver nicotine in the form of an aerosol (1). E-cigarettes have been marketed 
as both a smoking cessation tool and an alternative to conventional cigarettes 
(2). Results from several studies suggest recent rapid increases in e-cigarette 
use (3–7). In light of ongoing declines in conventional cigarette smoking 
prevalence (8), it is important to understand the extent to which e-cigarettes 
are being used among U.S. adults, both overall and by conventional cigarette 
smoking status. This report provides the first estimates of e-cigarette use 
among U.S. adults from a nationally representative household interview 
survey, by selected demographic and cigarette smoking characteristics.

● Men were more likely than women to have ever tried an e-cigarette (Figure 1).
● More than 20% of adults aged 18–24 had ever tried an e-cigarette, with use declining
steadily as age increased.
● Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) adults (20.2%) and non-Hispanic
white adults (14.8%) were more likely than Hispanic (8.6%), non-Hispanic black (7.1 %),

with use differing by age and race and Hispanic or Latino origin.
● Current use of e-cigarettes was about the same for men and women (Figure 2).
● Current e-cigarette use was higher among non-Hispanic AIAN adults (10.7%) and non-
Hispanic white adults (4.6%) than among Hispanic (2.1%), non-Hispanic black (1.8%), 
and non-Hispanic Asian (1.5%) adults.

Current cigarette smokers and recent former smokers (quit smoking within 
the past year) were more likely to use e-cigarettes than long-term former 
smokers (quit smoking more than 1 year ago) and adults who had never 
smoked.
 
● Almost one-half of current cigarette smokers (47.6%) and more than one-half of recent 
former cigarette smokers (55.4%) had ever tried an e-cigarette, compared with 8.9% of 
long-term former smokers and 3.2% of adults who had never smoked cigarettes (Figure 3).
 
● About one in six current cigarette smokers (15.9%) and nearly one in four recent former 
cigarette smokers (22.0%) currently used e-cigarettes, compared with 2.3% of long-term 
former cigarette smokers and 0.4% of adults who had never smoked cigarettes.

Current cigarette smokers who had tried to quit in the past year were more 
likely to use e-cigarettes than those who had not tried to quit.
 
● Current cigarette smokers who had tried to quit smoking in the past year were more likely 
than smokers who had not tried to quit to have ever tried an e-cigarette (Figure 4). 
 
● Current cigarette smokers who had tried to quit in the past year (20.3%) were almost twice 
as likely as cigarette smokers who had not tried to quit (11.8%) to currently use e-cigarettes.

Among adults who had never smoked cigarettes, young adults aged 18–24 
were more likely than older adults to have tried e-cigarettes.
 
● Among adults who had never smoked cigarettes, the percentage who had ever tried an 
e-cigarette, even one time, was highest for those aged 18–24 (9.7%) and declined as age 
increased (Figure 5).
 
● Among adults aged 45 and over who had never smoked cigarettes, 1% or less had ever tried 
an e-cigarette even once.

Summary
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) first began collecting data about e-cigarette use in 
2014. The estimates presented in this report provide a foundation for understanding who is using 
e-cigarettes and for monitoring changes in e-cigarette use among U.S. adults over time.
In 2014, men were more likely than women to have ever tried e-cigarettes but were not more 
likely to be current users. Younger adults were more likely than older adults to have tried 
e-cigarettes and to currently use e-cigarettes. Both non-Hispanic AIAN and non-Hispanic white 
adults were more likely than non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic adults to 
have ever tried e-cigarettes and to be current e-cigarette users.
When examined in the context of conventional cigarette smoking, use of e-cigarettes was 
highest among current and recent former cigarette smokers, and among current smokers who had 
made a quit attempt in the past year. Although fewer than 4% of adults who had never smoked 
conventional cigarettes had ever tried an e-cigarette, nearly 1 in 10 never-smokers aged 18–24 
had tried an e-cigarette at least once.
Definitions
Cigarette smoking status: Adults were asked if they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their 
lifetime and, if yes, whether they currently smoked cigarettes every day, some days, or not at 
all. Those who smoked every day or some days were classified as current smokers. Adults who 
had not smoked 100 cigarettes were classified as having never smoked. Adults who had smoked 
100 cigarettes but were not smoking at the time of interview were asked how long ago they last 
smoked. Former smokers were then classified as recent former smokers (quit within the past year) 
or long-term former smokers (quit at least 1 year earlier).
E-cigarette use: Use of e-cigarettes was determined by first describing an e-cigarette for the 
respondent (“The next questions are about electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigarettes. 
E-cigarettes look like regular cigarettes, but are battery-powered and produce vapor instead of 
smoke.”). The respondent was then asked, “Have you ever used an e-cigarette, even one time?” 
Those who said “yes” were referred to as having “ever tried an e-cigarette.” Adults who had 
ever used an e-cigarette, even one time, were then asked, “Do you now use e-cigarettes every 
day, some days, or not at all?” Current e-cigarette use includes respondents who reported using 
e-cigarettes every day or some days.
Quit attempt: Adults who were current cigarette smokers were asked if they had stopped smoking 
cigarettes for more than 1 day in the past year because they were trying to quit smoking. Smokers 
responding “yes” were classified as having made a quit attempt in the past year.
Race and Hispanic or Latino origin: The revised 1997 Office of Management and Budget 
standards for race (9) were used for the classification of race and Hispanic or Latino origin. A 
person’s race is described by one or more of five racial groups: white, black or African American, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Data on 
race and Hispanic or Latino origin are collected separately but combined for reporting. Not shown 
separately are data for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and for persons of two or more 
races, due to small sample sizes. Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin may be of any race.

Data source and methods
Data from the 2014 NHIS were used for this analysis. NHIS data are collected continuously 
throughout the year for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center 
for Health Statistics (NCHS) by interviewers from the U.S. Census Bureau. NHIS includes 
information about the health characteristics and health care of the civilian noninstitutionalized 
population of the United States. Questions about lifetime and current e-cigarette use were first 
asked in NHIS in 2014, in the Sample Adult component (n = 36,697). The questions followed a 
series of questions on use of conventional cigarettes, noncigarette combustible tobacco, and 
smokeless tobacco products.
Estimates in this report are nationally representative of civilian adults aged 18 and over living 
in households across the United States. SAS-callable SUDAAN software was used to produce 
estimates and variances. Differences between percentages were evaluated using two-sided 
significance tests at the 0.05 level. Estimates with a relative standard error greater than 30% but 
less than 50% are indicated with an asterisk. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests for trend were used 
to evaluate trends in e-cigarette use across age groups.
