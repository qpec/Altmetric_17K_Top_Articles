Key Points
• rIX-FP maintains mean trough
of 20 and 12 IU/dL FIX activity
with 40 IU/kg weekly and
75 IU/kg every 2 weeks

• Weekly and 14-day
prophylaxis regimens with
rIX-FP were well tolerated
and provided low bleeding
rates and target joint
improvement.
A global phase 3 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of re-
combinant fusion protein linking coagulation factor IX with albumin (rIX-FP) in 63
previously treated male patients (12-61 years) with severe hemophilia B (factor IX [FIX]
activity £2%). The study included 2 groups: group 1 patients received routine prophylaxis
once every 7 days for 26 weeks, followed by either 7-, 10-, or 14-day prophylaxis regimen
for a mean of 50, 38, or 51 weeks, respectively; group 2 patients received on-demand
treatment of bleeding episodes for 26 weeks and then switched to a 7-day prophylaxis
regimen for a mean of 45 weeks. The mean terminal half-life of rIX-FP was 102 hours,
4.3-fold longer than previous FIX treatment. Patients maintained a mean trough of 20
and 12 IU/dL FIX activity on prophylaxis with rIX-FP 40 IU/kg weekly and 75 IU/kg every
2 weeks, respectively. There was 100% reduction in median annualized spontaneous
bleeding rate (AsBR) and 100% resolution of target joints when subjects switched
from on-demand to prophylaxis treatment with rIX-FP (P < .0001). The median AsBR was
0.00 for all prophylaxis regimens. Overall, 98.6% of bleeding episodes were treated
successfully, including 93.6% that were treated with a single injection. No patient
developed an inhibitor, and no safety concerns were identified. These results indicate rIX-FP is safe and effective for preventing and
treating bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia B at dosing regimens of 40 IU/kg weekly and 75 IU/kg every 2 weeks. This trial
was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT0101496274. (Blood. 2016;127(14):1761-1769)
Introduction
Hemophilia B, particularly moderate and severe forms (#5% factor
IX [FIX] activity), is associated with spontaneous bleeding into
joints, muscles, and soft tissues that may lead to crippling arthrop-
athy, and bleeding in the intracranial, neck/throat, or gastrointes-
tinal spaces may be life threatening. The prevention of recurrent
bleeding and joint deterioration in order to preserve normal muscu-
loskeletal function is the goal of routine prophylaxis treatment.1
Current prophylaxis therapy requires frequent intravenous injections
of FIX replacement product, maintaining appropriate FIX trough
levels to effectively reduce the incidence of hemarthroses and
other bleeding episodes. Currently available standard half-life FIX
replacementproductsrequireintravenousinjectionstwiceperweek.2,3
Recombinant FIX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc; Alprolix, Biogen/Idec),
recently licensed in the United States, has an extended half-life
compared with standard FIX products,4 so that time to 3 IU/dL FIX
activity is 5.8 days with a dose of 50 IU/kg.5 The necessity of fre-
quent injections creates a burden for both patients and caregivers,
impacting long-term compliance.6
Recombinant fusion protein linking recombinant coagulation
factor IX with recombinant albumin (rIX-FP) is produced as a
single protein with a cleavable linker between FIX and albu-
min that is derived from the endogenous activation peptide in

 native FIX. Because albumin is protected from degradation by
pH-dependent binding to the neonatal Fc receptor,7,8 rIX-FP has an
increased circulating half-life compared with recombinant FIX (rFIX).
rIX-FP has demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics (PK) and
prolonged pharmacodynamic activity, when compared with rFIX in
preclinicalstudies9-11andinearlierclinicaltrials.12,13TheimprovedPK
profile of rIX-FP may allow patientsto be injected less frequentlywhile
maintaining a circulating FIX level high enough to minimize the
occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes.
The aim of this study was to evaluate PK, efficacy, and safety of
rIX-FP administered for the treatment and prevention of bleeding
episodesinpreviouslytreatedadolescentandadultpatientswithsevereor
moderatelyseverehemophiliaB(FIXactivity#2IU/dL).Wepresentthe
results of a single-sequence crossover study that compared the efficacy
ofdifferentregimens,includingon-demandvsprophylaxistreatmentand
7-day vs 14-day prophylaxis regimens, in patients with hemophilia B.
Methods
Study conduct
Thestudywasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboard/ethicscommitteeateach
participating center, registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT0101496274),
and performed in accordance with good clinical practice,14 the Declaration of
Helsinki, and local regulatory requirements. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients or their legal guardians.
Study patients
The main criteria for subject selection were based on the Guideline on the
Clinical Investigation of Recombinant and Human Plasma-Derived Factor IX
Products by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.15 Male
patients, 12 to 65 years of age, with hemophilia B (FIX activity #2 IU/dL), at
least 150 exposure days (EDs) with previous FIX replacement products, and no
detectable inhibitor to FIX or inhibitor history were eligible for enrollment.
Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any FIX product or hamster protein or
on immunomodulating treatment or having CD4 cell count ,200/mm3 were
excluded. Patients with serum aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotrans-
ferase.5timestheupperlimitofnormalwerealsoexcluded.Patientsenrolledin
the on-demand treatment group had a minimum of 2 nontrauma-induced
bleeding episodes treated per month (any type or location), in the 3 to 6 months
preceding study entry.
Trial design
This was a prospective, nonrandomized, multinational, open-label phase 3 study,
with patients assigned to either a prophylaxis group 1 (prophylaxis/prophylaxis)
or an on-demand group 2 (on-demand/prophylaxis) (Figure 1). Only
patients who were previously receiving on-demand treatment were eligible
for group 2 assignment. The study consisted of a 1-month screening period
to determine eligibility for the study, followed by an active rIX-FP treat-
ment period of at least 12 months. In addition, all subjects who had not
previously undergone PK analysis of rIX-FP in a previous study partici-
pated in a 14-day PK evaluation of 25 or 50 IU/kg rIX-FP at the start of the
study. A subset of patients in group 1 (the first 15 rIX-FP-na¨
ıve patients
enrolled) underwent both a PK evaluation of their previous FIX product
and a second PK evaluation of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP after 26 weeks of 7-day
prophylaxis treatment.
Group 1 received rIX-FP once every 7 days as routine prophylaxis
during the first 26 weeks with starting dose of 35 to 50 IU/kg rIX-FP, as
decided by the treating physician. After 26 weeks, patients were allowed to
switch to prophylaxis treatment intervals of 10 or 14 days with 75 IU/kg
rIX-FP after meeting the following switching criteria: no spontaneous
bleeds for at least 4 weeks before switching and receiving #40 IU/kg
rIX-FP in order to switch to the 14-day interval or #50 IU/kg rIX-FP to
switch to the 10-day interval. The dose could be adjusted up or down based
on the treating physician’s assessment of bleeding phenotype, physical
activity level, or clinical outcome.
Group 2 received on-demand (episodic) treatment with rIX-FP for
bleeding episodes during the first 26 weeks followed by 7-day prophylaxis for
approximately $26 weeks with a fixed dose between 35 and 50 IU/kg,
determined by the physician.
All bleeding episodes were treated with rIX-FP, at doses between 35 and
50 IU/kg, as decided by the physician. Patients self-administered rIX-FP for both
routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes; all home
administrations were recorded in an electronic diary. A second dose of rIX-FP
was administered at least 24 hours after the first injection, if needed, to achieve
hemostatsis, as determined by the judgment of the patient and/or provider.
Efficacyandsafetyassessmentswereperformedatstudysitesonamonthlybasis.
Any patientrequiring surgery during the course of thestudy couldparticipate in a
surgical substudy.
The study was considered completed when 50 patients achieved $50
EDs in the rIX-FP clinical program, including previous studies. However,
the active treatment period for the evaluation of safety and efficacy was
extended up to 27 months to allow subjects to receive continuous treatment
with rIX-FP until enrollment in the subsequent extension study.
Trial objectives and outcome measures
Theprimaryefficacyobjectiveofthe studywastoevaluate theefficacyofrIX-FP
to prevent bleeding episodes, as assessed by an intraindividual comparison of the
annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR) during 7-day prophylaxis with the
AsBR during the on-demand treatment period in group 2. The primary safety
objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of rIX-FP, as assessed by the
occurrence of inhibitors against FIX in all patients who received dose(s) of
rIX-FP.
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the PK, the
hemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP for the prevention and treatment of bleeding
episodes, and the overall clinical safety of repeated dosing of rIX-FP. The
secondary efficacy end points included the annualized bleeding rates
(ABRs) in all prophylaxis regimens (once every 7, 10, and 14 days), the
number of rIX-FP injections required to achieve hemostasis when treating
bleeding episodes, and the investigator’s assessment based on a 4-point
scale (see footnote of Table 4 for details). Safety was determined by evaluating
the frequency, severity, and relatedness of adverse events (AEs), development
of noninhibitory antibodies against rIX-FP and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cell proteins, local tolerability, laboratory safety parameters, physical exam, and
vital signs.
Analytical methods
FIX activity was measured using a validated 1-stage clotting method using
Pathromtin SL (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany) as
an activator reagent; rIX-FP activity determination was performed using
the Behring Coagulation System.12 The results were interpreted using a
reference curve, prepared from standard human plasma calibrated to the
World Health Organization standard for FIX, and reported in International
Units. This assay was used to measure FIX activity for PK assessment of
both rIX-FP and the patients’ previous FIX product (plasma-derived FIX
[pdFIX] or rFIX).
Inhibitors were titrated by the Bethesda method according to the
Nijmegen modification,16 and a titer $0.6 Bethesda units was defined as a
positive result.
A tiered approach to immunogenicity testing for rIX-FP was employed
during the study. A direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
performed to detect antibodies against rIX-FP; if a positive signal was
obtained, the sample was retested to confirm the specific antibody signal and
to discriminate between antibodies against rFIX, pdFIX, and albumin. A second
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to test for antibodies
against CHO cell proteins; if a positive signal was obtained, the sample was
retested by surface plasmon resonance to confirm the specific antibody signal.
All assays were performed in the central laboratory at CSL Behring, Marburg,
Germany.

From 
 Statistical analysis
The efficacy and safety populations consisted of all patients who received at least
1 dose of rIX-FP. The sample size of the study was based on the recommen-
dations from regulatory agencies because of the rarity of the disease. For the
primary safety end point of incidence of anti-FIX inhibitors, a sample size of
50 was considered sufficient to rule out an estimated incidence of inhibi-
tor development of 10.65%. The primary efficacy end point, the AsBR, was
analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in the primary efficacy population,
which consisted of all patients assigned to group 2 who received atleast1 dose of
rIX-FP for prophylaxis after completing a 26-week period of on-demand
treatment. The null hypothesis was that the ratio of AsBR (prophylaxis/on-
demand) was $0.50; the test was conducted at the 1-sided 0.025 level. In
addition, the estimated AsBR (model-based AsBR) with 95% confidence
interval (CI) based on a Poisson distribution was presented for all treatment
regimens.
The efficacy of the 10-day and 14-day prophylaxis regimens was determined
by comparing the model-based ABR with that obtained in the 7-day prophylaxis
regimen. In addition, ABRs were also calculated as matched pairs and compared
using a Student t test in patients who received both the 7-day and 14-day
prophylaxis regimens for a minimum of 12 weeks each.
Treatment of minor or moderate bleeding episodes was considered
successful if hemostasis was achieved with 1 or 2 injections. The proportion
of bleeds treated successfully was reported with a 95% CI. In order to
consider on demand treatment satisfactorily effective, one would expect to
observe that 85% of bleeding episodes are treated with 1 or 2 infusions.17 As
an acceptance criterion, therefore, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was
set to exceed 80%.
The PK analysis was performed by standard noncompartmental analysis
using Phoenix WinNonlin software version 6.2 (Pharsight). Four main PK
parameters(incrementalrecovery,terminalhalf-life,areaunderthecurve(AUC),
and total body clearance normalized to body weight) were calculated using the
actual collection times, according to International Society on Thrombosis and
Haemostasis recommendations.18,19
Normally or approximately distributed data are reported as mean and
standarddeviation(SD);nonnormallydistributeddata,suchasABR,arereported
as median and interquartile range (IQR).
Drug product
rIX-FP was produced by expression in CHO cells and supplied as freeze-dried
powder in single-use vials with a nominal content of 500, 1000, or 2000 IU per
vial. The 500 and 1000 IU vials were reconstituted with 2.5 mL, and the 2000 IU
vial with 5.0 mL of water for intravenous injection.
Results
Patient characteristics
Overall, 63 male patients with hemophilia B (FIX activity #2 IU/dL)
from 32 sites in 10 countries provided informed consent and were
enrolled and treated with rIX-FP between February 2012 and July
2014. Patients were between 12 and 61 years of age (mean 33.0
years); 7 patients were younger than 18 years. The patient population
was geographically diverse and included patients from North
America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East (Table 1). More
than half of the patients in both groups 1 and 2 reported chronic
hemarthrosis or a target joint at the start of the study (see footnote of
Table 1 for details20). Group 2 patients (on-demand prior to study
entry) reported a higher median nontrauma-induced bleeding rate
than group 1 patients during the 12 months prior to study entry (21.0
vs 1.0). Patient enrollment and a study flow diagram are presented in
Figure 2.
PK
All patients who had not been enrolled in a previous study of rIX-FP
participated in a PK assessment at the start of the study, and a subset of
patients participated in repeat PK assessment after 26 weeks of
prophylaxis treatment. Overall, rIX-FP demonstrated an improved PK
profile compared with standard FIX products, with an incremental
recovery of 1.27 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg), half-life of 101.7 hours, AUC of
7176 h 3 IU/dL and clearance of 0.769 mL/h per kg, similar to that
previously reported.12 After repeat dosing, PK results of 50 IU/kg
rIX-FP were similar to initial results and did not show time dependence
or accumulation.
After administration of a single intravenous dose of rIX-FP, mean
FIX activity remained .5 IU/dL through day 10 following a dose of
25 IU/kg and through day 14 following a dose of 50 IU/kg (Figure 3).
Figure 1. Study design. The study consisted of a 1-month screening period, 14-day PK assessment, followed by active treatment of at least 12 months. Patients were
assigned to either prophylaxis treatment (group 1) or on-demand treatment (group 2) based on previous treatment regimen. Group 1 patients received weekly prophylaxis for
26 weeks and then were evaluated for eligibility to switch to a longer treatment interval (star). Group 2 received on-demand treatment of the first 26 weeks followed by weekly
rIX-FP prophylaxis for an additional 26 weeks or longer. Subjects were required to have no spontaneous bleeds for at least 1 month and be on a stable dose of #40 IU/kg or
#50 IU/kg rIX-FP to switch to a 14-day or 10-day treatment interval, respectively. Subjects continued on 7-, 10-, or 14-day prophylaxis for the remaining treatment period.
A subset of subjects in group 1 (the first 15 patients na¨
ıve to rIX-FP to enroll) repeated the PK assessment of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP at approximately week 26, prior to switching to a
longer treatment interval. EOS, end of study.

 Efficacy
Once weekly prophylaxis after switching from on-demand
treatment with rIX-FP.
The primary analysis was performed
on the primary efficacy population (n 5 19), which included group
2 patients who received rIX-FP on-demand treatment during the
first 26 weeks (median, 26.7; IQR, 26.0-27.4 weeks) and then
switched to a once weekly prophylaxis regimen for the remaining
weeks on study (median, 45.1; IQR, 17.3-74 weeks). The AsBR
was significantly reduced following prophylaxis treatment with
rIX-FP compared with on-demand treatment (median AsBR of
0.00 and 15.43, respectively; P , .0001; Table 2). The median
rIX-FP dose during the once weekly prophylaxis regimen was
40.3 IU/kg (IQR, 37.6-50.6). Overall, there was a 100% reduction
in AsBR and 90% reduction in total ABR for patients switching
from on-demand to weekly prophylaxis with rIX-FP.
Group 2 patients showed a slight decrease in total ABR (median,
19.2; Table 2) during on-demand treatment with rIX-FP as compared
with the rate reported in the 12 months prior to study entry (median,
23.5; Table 1); nontrauma ABR decreased from a median of 21 (IQR,
12-24; Table 1) to 13.3 (IQR, 7.7-17), respectively. There were 14
patients who reported chronic hemarthrosis or at least 1 target joint at
screening (Table 1), and target joints were observed in 10 patients
during the on-demand treatment period in the study. After switching to
the once weekly prophylaxis regimen, target joints were resolved in all
10 patients: 7 patients had no joint bleeds, and 3 patients had only a
single bleeding episode in the previously affected joints.
Prophylaxis regimens every 10 or 14 days after switching
from once weekly schedule.
After completing at least 26 weeks
on 7-day prophylaxis with a median dose of 40 IU/kg rIX-FP, 28
(70%) patients met the switching criteria (Figure 1) and switched to
the 14-day prophylaxis regimen with 75 IU/kg (21 patients) or to
the 10-day regimen with 75 IU/kg (7 patients). The median AsBR
was 0.00 for all prophylaxis regimens tested in group 1, and the
estimated mean AsBR was 0.83, 0.56, and 0.65 in the 14-, 10-, and
7-day prophylaxis regimens, respectively (Table 3). Results for total
ABR and joint ABR were similar across treatment regimens, as shown
in Table 3. An intraindividual comparison of AsBR between the 7- and
14-day regimens showed that the 14-day regimen was noninferior to
the 7-day regimen, with a mean difference of 20.79 (95% CI, 21.780
to 0.197).
FIX trough levels and rIX-FP consumption during prophylaxis
regimens.
At day 7 during once weekly prophylaxis with 40 IU/kg
and day 14 during 14-day prophylaxis with 75 IU/kg, the mean trough
FIXactivitywas20.0IU/dL(IQR,17-26IU/dL;range,2.5-36.2IU/dL)
and 12.4 IU/dL (IQR, 10-14 IU/dL; range, 3.1-25.4 IU/dL), respec-
tively. Patients receiving 14-day and 7-day prophylaxis with rIX-FP
had a median consumption of 162.3 IU/kg per month (IQR,
158.6-164.2) and 194.7 IU/kg per month (IQR, 167.4-215.0),
respectively. Prior to study entry, the median consumption on
prophylaxis with standard FIX products was 256.6 IU/kg per
month (IQR, 208.7-365.3).
Treatment of bleeding episodes.
A total of 358 bleeding epi-
sodes were treated with rIX-FP; 93.6% and 98.6% of these episodes
were successfully treated with 1 or #2 infusions of rIX-FP, re-
spectively (Table 4). The probability of success, defined as requiring
#2 infusions to achieve hemostasis, was 98.6% (95% CI, 96.2-99.5).
Patients redosed if needed, at a mean of 49 hours following the first
infusion (IQR, 31-65 hours), based on the clinical judgment of
patient or physician. Similar treatment efficacy was observed in
patients receiving prophylaxis and on-demand treatment, regard-
less of the cause (spontaneous, trauma induced, or unknown)
or location (joint, muscle, or other) of the bleeding episodes.
Hemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP in the treatment of bleeding episodes
was rated by investigators as excellent or good for 94.1% of bleeding
episodes. There were no life-threatening bleeding episodes during
the study. The majority of total and spontaneous bleeding episodes
(58.7% and 66.2%, respectively) occurred in the elbow, knee, and
ankle joints. There were 5 iliopsoas bleeds in 4 patients; 80% were
successfully treated with 1 infusion.
Safety
There were 3907 injections of rIX-FP during the study with a mean
of 64.8 EDs per patient (72.4 in group 1 and 51.5 in group 2). No
inhibitors against FIX were detected in any patient receiving rIX-FP;

nonneutralizing antibodies against rIX-FP or CHO host cell proteins
were detected.
A total of 347 treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 54 (85.7%)
patients. Most treatment-emergent AEs were of mild or moderate
severity (283 mild, 59 moderate, 5 severe). The most frequently
reported treatment-emergent AEs were nasopharyngitis (38 events in
16 [25.4%] patients), headache (34 events in 15 [23.8%] patients),
arthralgia (19 events in 9 [14.3%] patients), and influenza (10 events
in 7 [11.1%] patients). Eleven AEs (all mild or moderate in severity)
in 5 (7.9%) patients were considered by the physician to be possibly
related to rIX-FP. Two patients chose to discontinue treatment after
experiencing an AE (1 with hypersensitivity, 1 with headache). The
AE of hypersensitivity was considered likely to be an infusion-
related reaction with nausea, mild palpitation, and dysgeusia. The
patient’s heart rate slightly increased from 51 to 60 bpm, and blood
pressure was stable (134/78 mmHg). All symptoms resolved within
23 minutes without treatment. The patient decided to withdraw from
Figure 2. Patient enrollment and study flow diagram. The diagram shows the flow and disposition of patients in the trial. Following screening, 63 subjects were enrolled in
the study. All subjects who had not previously undergone PK analysis of rIX-FP in a previous study participated in PK evaluation of 25 IU/kg (n 5 6) or 50 IU/kg rIX-FP
(n 5 46). A subset of subjects (n 5 13) also participated in a PK evaluation of their previous FIX product (pdFIX or rFIX). A subset of subjects (n 5 15) repeated PK analysis of
50 IU/kg rIX-FP at approximately week 26. Subjects were assigned either weekly prophylaxis (group 1) or on-demand treatment (group 2) with rIX-FP, based on their prior
treatment regimen. Eight subjects discontinued from the study for the following reasons: AEs (n 5 2), subject decision (n 5 2), lost to follow-up (n 5 3), and protocol violation
(n 5 1, unwillingness to switch to prophylaxis after on-demand treatment).

 the study and had no detectable inhibitors to FIX 1 month after the
last dose of rIX-FP. The AE of headache was reported as moderate in
severity and resolved the same day without treatment.
There were a total of 28 (0.7%) injection site reactions reported by
12 patients. Two (3.2%) patients reported serious AEs: 1 patient was
hospitalized for treatment of synovitis according to local practice,
and 1 patient with a history of epilepsy following head trauma
was hospitalized for treatment of an episode of acquired epileptic
aphasia, which resolved as expected. Both severe AEs were con-
sidered by the treating physician to be unrelated to rIX-FP. There
were no reports of thromboembolic events, anaphylaxis, or life-
threatening AEs.

 Discussion
Results from this prospective phase 3 study demonstrate that rIX-FP
is a safe and effective FIX replacement product with an improved
PK profile as compared with standard FIX products, supporting a
prophylaxis dosing interval up to 14 days while maintaining FIX
trough levels above the target of 1 IU/dL commonly recommended
for prophylaxis.2
rIX-FP regimens were highly effective in bleeding prevention,
as demonstrated by the achievement of a median AsBR of 0.0 across
all prophylaxis regimens. The 7-day regimen with 40 IU/kg and the
14-day regimen with 75 IU/kg resulted in similarly low total ABR
and AsBR, indicating that rIX-FP given once every 14 days repre-
sents an effective and convenient prophylactic option. In addition,
overall consumption of rIX-FP for prophylaxis was ;40% lower
than the previous product used prior to study entry. Indeed, the
efficacy of rIX-FP over longer treatment intervals translates to a
reduced number of injections for patients compared with currently
available rFIX and pdFIX products, with a reduction in consump-
tion. Therefore, routine prophylaxis with rIX-FP may reduce the
burden of disease management for patients, caregivers, and health
care providers.
The efficacy of prophylaxis treatment compared with on-demand
treatment was demonstrated by a within-subject comparison of the
2 rIX-FP regimens; this study design controlled for the variability of
bleeding frequency within the hemophilia B patient population, as
group 2 patients started rIX-FP treatment on-demand and continued on
7-day prophylaxis with a median dose of 40 IU/kg rIX-FP. A drastic
reduction of the median AsBR to 0.0 while on 7-day prophylaxis was
observed, and, in addition, all target joints resolved in these patients
after switching to 7-day prophylaxis regimen.
Measures of hemostatic efficacy indicated that rIX-FP provides
rapid and complete control of bleeding episodes, with a success
rate of 98.6%. In particular, 93.6% of bleeds were controlled
with 1 infusion, which compares favorably to results reported for
both pdFIX and rFIX products, including extended half-life FIX
products.3,4,21,22
It is intriguing to note that a slight decrease of ABR was observed in
group 2 patients during on-demand treatment with rIX-FP as compared
with the ABR in the 12-month period preceding study entry. This
finding raises the possibility that on-demand treatment with rIX-FP
might provide, to a certain extent, some protection against a sub-
sequent bleeding episode. Therefore, patients with a severe bleeding
phenotype treated on-demand might experience fewer bleeding
episodes if switched to rIX-FP. Furthermore, such on-demand patients
who require .1 infusion per month may have the benefit of a reduction
of ABR by administering a similar number of infusions according to a
14-day prophylaxis regimen with rIX-FP. This observation may have
been affected by the small sample size and differences of care received
by patients while on a clinical study; further data are needed to
understand if rIX-FP can lower the ABR of patients receiving only
on-demand treatment.
The median rIX-FP doses of 40 IU/kg for 7-day and 75 IU/kg
for 14-day prophylaxis regimens provided FIX activity troughs of
20.0 IU/dL and 12.4 IU/dL, respectively. Although not tested in
this trial, a 7-day prophylaxis regimen of 25 IU/kg and a 14-day
prophylaxis regimen of 50 IU/kg are supported by current and
previous PK results with rIX-FP,12,13,23 and should allow patients
with severe and moderate hemophilia B to experience the benefit of
a mild bleeding phenotype.
rIX-FP demonstrated improved PK parameters over all marketed
FIX products3,4,24 with an extended terminal half-life of 102 hours.
Other PK parameters, such as AUC (7176 h 3 IU/dL), clearance
(0.77 mL/h per kg), and incremental recovery (1.27 IU/dL per
IU/kg) are improved as well. Mean FIX activity was .5 IU/dL at
day 7 and day 14 following a single dose of 25 or 50 IU/kg rIX-FP,
respectively. Although no statistical comparisons have been per-
formed, rFIXFc has reported a faster clearance of 3.304 mL/h per kg,
and reached 3 IU/dL FIX activity 5.8 days after administration.5
The median AsBR of 7-day prophylaxis with rIX-FP (median dose
40 IU/kg) was 0.00, lower than the reported AsBR of 1.04 with

From 
 weekly prophylaxis with rFIXFc (median dose 45.2 IU/kg).4,5 A direct
comparison of the efficacy of prophylaxis with rIX-FP and rFIXFc is
difficult because of the differences in patient population, study design,
and prophylaxis regimens between these trials; however, these findings
suggest that a slower clearance may be a factor in the success of
prophylaxis regimens rather than half-life alone.
FIX activity levels play a key role in preventing bleeding. Den Uijl
et al25 showed that joint bleeding occurs in a relevant proportion of
hemophilia A patients with factor levels up to 12 IU/dL. Although no
hemophilia B patients were included in that study, it suggests that FIX
levels required to prevent bleeding may be higher than currently
targeted with standard prophylaxis regimens. Patients on prophylaxis
withstandard FIX products administered 2 times per week may have an
increased riskof bleeding when FIX activity islow, particularly prior to
the next scheduled prophylaxis dose. In contrast, the improved PK
parameters of rIX-FP offer higher FIX activity for longer durations,
reducing the risk of both spontaneous and trauma-related bleeding
episodes, in addition to offering a less frequent dosing schedule and
potential improvements in adherence.26
Inconclusion,rIX-FPissafeandeffectiveinpreventingandtreating
bleeding episodes in previously treated adolescents and adults with
hemophilia B. The enhanced PK profile allows for a paradigm shift of
routine prophylaxis regimen at dosing intervals of up to14 days. With a
half-life of .100 hours, five- to sevenfold better clearance, and AUC
and higher incremental recovery than standard FIX products, rIX-FP
will provide prolonged hemostatic coverage. A study is currently
