A Primary Care Panel Size of 2500 Is neither
Accurate nor Reasonable

Primary care panel sizes are an important component of primary care practices. Determining the appro-
priate panel size has implications for patient access, physician workload, and care comprehensiveness
and will have an impact on quality of care. An often quoted standard panel size is 2500. However, this
number seems to arise in the literature anecdotally, without a basis in research. Subsequently, multiple
studies observed that a panel size of 2500 is not feasible because of time constraints and results in in-
complete preventive care and health care screening services. In this article we review the origins of a
panel size of 2500, review the subsequent work examining this number and effectively debunking it as a
feasible panel size, and discuss the importance of primary care physicians setting an appropriate panel
size. (J Am Board Fam Med 2016;29:496–499.)

It is difficult to accurately forecast the number of
primary care physicians (PCPs) needed to serve a
growing aging US population that has increasing
access to health insurance. Workforce estimates are
understandably disparate.1 One of the key factors
in such estimates is the number of patients a single
PCP can reasonably manage.2 To ensure that pa-
tients in the United States have adequate access to
high-quality primary care through their medical
home, it is important to determine an appropriate
panel size.3,4 A physician who has an appropriately
sized panel can deliver more timely and compre-
hensive care to his or her patients, who are then
more likely to be satisfied. Compared with PCPs
who provide fragmented care (eg, in urgent care
settings), PCPs who provide continuity of care to
an appropriately sized panel of established patients
are better equipped to address the individual needs
of their patients; they also have more time available
to coordinate care with subspecialists, improve
communication with their patients, provide behav-
ior change counseling, evaluate quality, and moni-
tor patient outcomes.3
Is a Primary Care Panel Size of 2500 Patients
Reasonable?
A primary care panel size of 2500 patients per
physician is often cited as the standard. The origi-
nal source of this figure seems to be an article from
2000 in which the authors speculated about the
upper range of a panel size that could be reasonable
under certain circumstances: “. . . the panel size for
a full-time family physician taking care of his or her
own patients in a mature system can be up to about
2500.”5 This figure was not based on data or a
review of actual physician panel sizes. A standard
panel size of 2300 comes from a 2005 survey of
physicians in concierge and nonconcierge prac-
tices6; this is less commonly cited.
Primary care teams are expected to provide pre-
ventive, acute, and chronic care to their panels.
However, Americans receive only roughly 50% of
recommended acute, chronic, and preventive care
services.7 This discrepancy is in part because of a
lack of physician time. On average, family physi-
cians address approximately 3 problems per visit.8
It is estimated that a family physician would need
21.7 hours per work day to deliver recommended

 care to a panel of 2500 patients.9 This is one reason
why prior work using a standard panel size of 2500
found this number of patients to be incompatible
with the delivery of comprehensive care.9–11 Stud-
ies have also found this panel size to be incompat-
ible with the adequate management of chronic ill-
ness12 and with the provision of all preventive care
services.13 By contrast, reducing the size of a PCP’s
panel has been shown to result in shorter patient
wait times for empaneled appointments, longer vis-
its,14 and enhanced overall continuity of care.15
Although these improvements lead to higher over-
all patient and physician satisfaction,16 smaller pan-
els may cause difficulties in finding a PCP. Conti-
nuity of care has been associated with improved
preventive care, lower costs, and an improved ex-
perience for patients and physicians.3,17
What Is the Average Panel Size for a PCP?
Recent studies of various practice settings in the
United States and abroad found current panel sizes
ranging from 1200 to 1900 patients per physician.
For example, Kaiser Permanente reported a mean
per-physician panel size of 1751 patients, and
Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound re-
ported a panel size of 1490 patients per physician.18
The US Department of Veterans Affairs reported a
mean panel size of 1266 patients per full-time
equivalent physician.19 One study in Canada found
a panel size of 1400 patients per PCP.20 A study in
Denmark found a maximum level of 1600 patients
per physician,21 and a study in England found 2033
patients per solo physician.22
Panel sizes of 900 to 1000 patients per physician
are common in concierge or boutique practices.6 In
these models it is expected that physicians have
more time to manage their patients and can offer
improved access to care. These improvements are
expected to lead to better health outcomes; how-
ever, concierge practices have yet to publish such
data.
In a recent national study, only one third of
family physicians could estimate their current panel
size.23 Many physicians in the public sector, espe-
cially those in the safety net setting, find it partic-
ularly challenging to determine their panel size
because patients access ambulatory care sporadi-
cally, making accurate tracking difficult.24 It is eas-
ier for physicians in the private sector to determine
their panel size because of insurance payments and
network selection.
Multiple sources recommend estimating current
panel size by counting the patients who accessed
care in the preceding 18 months.4,25 For physicians
in the public sector, a longer look-back period may
allow for more accuracy.24 Another approach is to
use the following equation that sets demand equal
to supply25–27:
Panel Size � Visits per Patient per
Year [Demand] � Provider Visits per Day �
Provider Days per Year [Supply]
What Factors Should PCPs Consider When
Calculating a Reasonable Panel Size?
Once a physician has determined the current panel
size, he or she can estimate an individual or prac-
tice-specific “ideal” panel size that would permit
him or her to have a steady but manageable work-
load while offering assigned patients timely access
to needed care. There is not a simple equation for
determining an ideal panel size. Multiple factors
must be considered, including factors specific to the
patient population, the physician’s personal needs,
and the practice’s finances and infrastructure.
The practice’s patient population is a key con-
sideration because utilization of services is shaped
by the population’s age, sex, race, disease burden,
and other characteristics. Medical record data ex-
traction or practice utilization data review can help
a PCP assess the composition and the utilization
patterns of his or her panel, as well as the intensity
of services offered to different patient and popula-
tion categories. Such methods can help identify the
range of resources the practice allocates to a typical
patient. It is also important to review community
prevalence statistics to assess how vulnerable, utili-
zation-intense populations (eg, patients who are
homeless, patients who need substance abuse treat-
ment, patients who have severe mental illness)
might affect ideal panel size.
Primary care physicians must also consider how
their individual financial needs and patient care
preferences influence their ideal panel size. An-
other consideration is what number of patients will
allow the physician to maintain “joy in practice.”28
Burnout and lack of job satisfaction are indicators
that a PCP’s panel size has exceeded his or her
capacity.

 Once a PCP determines an ideal practice size, he
or she must decide how to track progress toward
achieving this ideal. Suggested metrics for assessing
whether a PCP’s panel size is optimal include the
number of overbooked appointments per week and
an access measure such as the average number of
days between a request for an appointment and the
third available appointment for that physician.27
Many have suggested that panel size capacity can
be increased if practices tap the potential for im-
proved efficiency (eg, using care teams or panel
managers, adopting scheduling innovations, in-
creasing telecommunication between physicians
and patients, delegating appropriate tasks to non-
physician clinicians).29 Although there are potential
avenues to increase panel sizes, research has not yet
documented that PCPs can provide recommended
care to a patient panel in the range of 2500.
Why Is Primary Care Panel Size Important?
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
has increased the number of patients who have
access to health insurance and are seeking a PCP.
In addition, an increase in chronic disease burden
is anticipated.12 These are among the key reasons
that the US health care system is expected to face
a PCP shortage.1,2
Previous primary care workforce estimates have
been modeled on an array of factors; however,
panel size is rarely considered.2 This factor can
significantly change estimates. In a recent study
that explored the sensitivity of a projected shortage
of 33,000 PCPs by 2035, the authors highlighted
the wide variation in their estimates that resulted
from decreasing PCP panel size, approximated by
the population-to-PCP ratio of 1400 patients per
physician, by 10% (which increased the projected
PCP shortage to 60,000) or increasing it by 10%
(which decreased the projected PCP shortage to
6,000).2
A PCP shortage will likely increase impediments
to accessing quality health care, especially if pa-
tients cannot find PCPs who are accepting new
patients into their panels.29 Physicians may experi-
ence pressure to increase their panel sizes to handle
increased demand. However, the recent literature
suggests that the average PCP is already narrowing
his or her scope of practice, seeing more patients
per hour, and facing tremendous risk of burn-
out.30,31 PCP want to be accessible to their pa-
tients, to get to know them over time, and to
deliver high-quality care. Patients want to see
their PCP in a timely manner, to feel like they
are being heard, and to receive appropriate care.
What physicians want aligns with what patients
want: improved patient access and continuity of
care. Case studies have shown that panel sizes
�2500 and effective team pairing yield greater
patient and physician satisfaction32,33 and better
health outcomes.33,34
Conclusion
The appropriateness of the traditionally cited pri-
mary care panel size of 2500 patients per physician
does not seem to be borne out in either study or
practice. Our review suggests that current panel
sizes in primary care are closer to 1200 to 1900
patients per PCP. Whether these are small enough
to allow for optimal productivity, quality of care,
and physician and patient satisfaction is unknown.
This is likely to vary by patient population, practice
structure, and community. Appropriate panel size
deserves greater attention at the policy and practice
levels if primary care is to function at its best for
physicians and patients.
