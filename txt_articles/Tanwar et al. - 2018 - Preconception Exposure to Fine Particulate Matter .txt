Background-—Particulate matter (particles < 2.5 lm [PM2.5]) exposure during the in utero and postnatal developmental periods
causes cardiac dysfunction during adulthood. Here, we investigated the potential priming effects of preconception exposure of
PM2.5 on cardiac function in adult offspring.
Methods and Results-—Male and female friend leukemia virus b (FVB) mice were exposed to either filtered air (FA) or PM2.5 at an
average concentration of 38.58 lg/m3 for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 3 months. Mice were then crossbred into 2 groups:
(1) FAmale9FAfemale (both parents were exposed to FA preconception) and, (2) PM2.5male9PM2.5female (both parents were exposed to
PM2.5 preconception). Male offspring were divided: (1) preconception FA (offspring born to FA exposed parents) and, (2) preconception
PM2.5 (offspring born to PM2.5 exposed parents) and analyzed at 3 months of age. Echocardiography identified increased left
ventricular end systolic volume and reduced posterior wall thickness, reduced %fractional shortening and %ejection fraction in
preconception PM2.5 offspring. Cardiomyocytes isolated from preconception PM2.5 offspring showed reduced %peak shortening,
�dL/dT, TPS90 and slower calcium reuptake (tau). Gene and protein expression revealed modifications in markers of inflammation (IL-
6, IL-15, TNFa, NFқB, CRP, CD26E, CD26P, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) profibrosis
(collagen type III alpha 1 chain), oxidative stress (NOS2), antioxidants (Nrf2, SOD, catalase), Ca2+ regulatory proteins (SERCA2a, p-PLN,
NCX), and epigenetic regulators (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Sirt1, and Sirt2) in preconception PM2.5 offspring.
Conclusions-—Preconception exposure to PM2.5 results in global cardiac dysfunction in adult offspring, suggesting that
abnormalities during development are not limited to the prenatal or postnatal periods but can also be determined before
conception. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e010797. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.010797.)

xposure to environmental pollution has significant
effects on human health and the progression of various
diseases. More specifically, ambient particulate matter (PM)
pollution is commonly recognized as one of the top global
health burdens following its association with 3.2 million
deaths per year.1 An escalating amount of clinical and
epidemiologic
studies
have
established
a
relationship
between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and exposure to
ambient
fine
particulate
matter
(<2.5 lm
in
diameter;
PM2.5)2 specifically arrhythmias, hypertension, myocardial
infarction and cardiac remodeling.3–5 Despite much research
focusing on the effects of air pollution on preexisting heart
conditions, whether PM exposure can be a primary determi-
nant of cardiovascular disease directly or by predisposing the
organ to worse outcomes has become a heightened area of
interest. In fact, exposures during “sensitive/critical” win-
dows of development (both prenatal and perinatal exposure)
can have lasting impacts on health. These exposures can
influence the developing organs, tissues, and cells, and can
lead to impairments in adult cardiac phenotypes. Previous
work in our laboratory has shown that PM2.5 exposure during
the in-utero period can have detrimental effects on cardiac
function of neonatal6 and adult mice.7
A severe outcome may also result from changes occurring
in the unfertilized male and female germ cells eg, through

 epigenetic changes.8–10 It is increasingly appreciated that
parental exposure to environmental stressors can have
significant effects on offspring phenotypes and exposure to
PM2.5 both before conception and during pregnancy impairing
fetal development and resulting in adverse birth outcomes.11–13
Whether part of the phenotypic changes induced by PM2.5
exposure during the critical preconception period on offspring
include a predisposition to or set pathological changes in
cardiac function remain unknown. In the present study, we
examined the effects of parental preconception exposure on
cardiac function in adult offspring and elucidated the potential
molecular mechanisms involved.
Materials and Methods
The data and analytic methods are available from the
corresponding author for purposes of reproducing the results
or replicating the procedures. All materials used in this study
are available commercially from the indicated vendors.
Animals and Exposure
All animal procedures were performed according to guidelines
provided by the National Institutes of Health and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at
The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Friend leukemia
virus B (FVB) mice of both sexes were housed for 1 week in
our housing facility before PM exposure (animal numbers are
listed in the figure legends). We then exposed male and
female mice, separately, to either filtered air (FA) or PM2.5 at
an average concentration of 38.58 lg/m3 for 6 hours/day,
5 days/week for 3 months before conception. The aerosol
concentration system located at The Ohio State University7 was
used to deliver concentrated PM2.5 exposures from the
Columbus, OH region. Mice in the FA group were exposed
using an identical system with the exception of implementing a
HEPA filter at the inlet that successfully removed all ambient
particles. After 3 months of exposure, the mice were crossbred
into 2 groups: (1) FAmale9FAfemale (both parents were FA
exposed before conception) and, (2) PM2.5male9PM2.5female
(both parents were PM2.5 exposed before conception). We
observed successful vaginal plugs within a week of mating.
Male offspring born to these crosses were divided into 2 groups:
(1) preconception FA (offspring born to FA exposed parents)
and, (2) preconception PM2.5 (offspring born to PM2.5 exposed
parents) and were analyzed at 3 months of age for the various
experiments as described below. We included 2 mice from each
litter for echocardiography and cardiomyocyte functional
analyses and 1 mouse per litter was used for molecular studies.
A detailed outline of the preconception exposure model is
provided in Figure S1.
Physiological Parameters
All mice were euthanized at 3 months following echocardiog-
raphy. Body weight, heart weight, heart weight/body weight,
heart weight/tibial length and tibia length were measured. Body
surface area (BSA) was calculated using the formula BSA=K
mass0.667; where K is known as the Meeh constant=9.82. This
equation is widely accepted for estimating BSA in animals.14
Assessment of fat and lean mass was determined in awake
animals using the echo magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI)
3-in-1 (EchoMRI, Houston, TX).
Assessment by Echocardiography
Cardiac function was assessed via echocardiography (40 MHz
transducer, Vevo 2100; Visualsonics [Toronto, ON, Canada]).
Three-month-old mice were kept sedated with 1.5% isoflurane
(in 100% O2) anesthesia supplied through a nose cone, while the
body temperature was maintained at 37°C. Following success-
ful anesthesia, the chests were cleared of fur using hair removal
cream. Next, pre-warmed ultrasound gel was applied to the
chest, along with a 15-MHz probe (optimized for mice) that was
placed in the parasternal, short-axis orientation. Cine loops
collected from M mode views were analyzed for LV systolic and
diastolic internal dimensions (LVESd and LVEDd), as well as
systolic and diastolic posterior wall thickness (PWTs and PWTd).
The following measurements were calculated: fractional short-
ening percentage (%FS=[(LVEDd�LVESd)/(LVEDd)9100), LV
end diastolic volume (LVEDV; 7/(2.4+LVESd)9LVEDd), LV end
systolic volume (LVESV; 7/(2.4+LVESd)9LVESd), ejection frac-
tion (ejection fraction(LVEDV�LVESV)/LVEDV9100), stroke
volume (LVEDV�LVESV), and cardiac output (SV9HR).
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The study used an in vivo mouse model of preconception
exposure to investigate the adverse cardiac effects on male
offspring.
• The results revealed that the preconception period repre-
sents a “critical window” for the development of cardiac
dysfunction in the offspring at adulthood. These data
indicate that environmental exposures may cause adapta-
tions to the germ cells that could provide the mechanistic
basis for the cardiovascular dysfunction observed.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Current findings may help in designing future clinical and
regulatory guidelines addressing environmental exposures
and human health specifically parental exposures in relation
to cardiovascular diseases in offspring.

 Cardiomyocyte Isolation and Functional
Assessment
Three-month-old mice were euthanized, and cardiomyocytes
were isolated as previously described.15 In brief, following
cardioectomy, isolations were completed by enzymatic diges-
tion (Liberase and Trypsin) via coronary retrograde perfusion
through the aorta. Isolated cardiomyocytes were then plated
on laminin-coated glass-bottom inserts (Cell MicroControls,
Norfolk, VA) for functional analyses. Glass inserts were
perfused with prewarmed contractile buffer in a chamber
mounted on an Olympus IX-71 microscope. Cells were
stimulated (1 Hz, 3-ms duration) with a Myopacer Field-
Stimulator system (IonOptix, Milton, MA) and functional
properties of the cells were evaluated using the Sarclen
Sarcomere Length Acquisition Module with the Myocam-S
Digital CCD camera video imaging system (IonOptix, Milton,
MA). Sarcomere percent peak shortening (normalized to
baseline sarcomere length, %PS; cellular corollary of %FS),
sarcomere maximal departure and return velocities (+dL/dT,
�dL/dT), and sarcomere time to 90% peak shortening
(TPS90) and time to 90% relengthening (TR90) were measured
to assess inotropic and lusitropic function using 8 to
12 cells/heart.
Intracellular Ca2+ Transients Measurements
We performed Ca2+ measurements using Fura-2AM, a Ca2+
sensitive fluorimetric dye. Briefly, cardiomyocytes in glass-
bottom dishes were loaded with Fura-2-AM at a concentration
of 5 lmol/L for 20 minutes at 25°C. Cells were then washed
and treated with normal culture media for 20 minutes at
25°C. Fluorescence was recorded in stimulated cardiomy-
ocytes at 37°C using a dual-excitation, single-emission
system (IonOptix). Transients were used to monitor basal
Ca2+, the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient (Δ340/380), and
fluorescence decay rate (tau) as an indication of intracellular
Ca2+ clearing rate.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction
Frozen heart tissues of 3-month-old mice were used for the
isolation of total RNA. Tissues were homogenized with a
TissueLyser (Qiagen, Boston, MA) using Trizol buffer followed
by transferring to a chloroform containing tube and cen-
trifuge. The supernatant was mixed with equal volume of 70%
ethanol and loaded onto a Qiagen RNA processing column
from the Qiagen RNeasy Min-Kit (Qiagen, Boston, MA). All
steps were followed according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. RNA quality and concentration was determined via
NanoDrop
2000c
(ThermoScientific,
Wilmington,
DE).
A
known amount of RNA was reverse transcribed to generate
cDNA using the iScript Supermix kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
on a CFX96 Thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Primers
were used at a final concentration of 0.25 to 0.5 lmol/L for
target genes and normalized to GAPDH expression. Relative
gene expression levels were quantified using the formula
2�DDCt. A 3-step amplification protocol was implemented:
10 minutes of denaturation at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles of
denaturation (95°C, 1 second), annealing (65°C, 10 seconds),
and extension (72°C, 20 seconds). Gene-specific primer
sequences are presented in Table 1.
Western Blotting
Frozen heart tissues from 3-month-old mice were homoge-
nized in lysis buffer as described previously.6 Protein
concentration was then quantified using a bicinchinonic acid
assay (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE). The proteins were
separated on SDS-PAGE gels (20 g) and transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes. Membranes were probed with antibodies to

Biotechnology, sc-8780-R, Dallas, TX). The densities of all
protein bands were normalized to b-actin (Sigma, A1978, St.
Louis, MO). Band signals were detected via the enhanced
chemiluminescence method (PIERCE, SuperSignal West Pico,
Chemiluminescent Substrate, CA). X-ray films were scanned
using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, version 4.1)
and later assessed.
Statistical Analyses
All data were analyzed for statistical significance using
GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA).
Differences between 2 groups were determined using a Student
t test (2-tailed) with an a-value of 0.05. All error bars in the
figures represent standard error of the mean; *, **, ***
represent significant differences of P<0.05, <0.01, and <0.001,
respectively. Additionally, for echocardiography and cardiomy-
ocyte functional analyses, we performed mixed model analysis
with a restricted maximum likelihood test to assess correlation
between littermates and to test group difference.

Parental Preconception PM2.5 Exposure Results
in Altered Body Weight Parameters
Litter size or sex did not vary significantly between precon-
ception FA (offspring born to preconception FA exposed
parents) and preconception PM2.5 (offspring born to precon-
ception PM2.5 exposed parents) groups. At birth, there was no
difference in body weights of the pups born to preconception
PM2.5 or FA exposed parents (Figure 1A). To measure the
impact of preconception PM2.5 exposure on growth and body
size, we measured body weight at adulthood (3 months). Body
weights of 3-month-old preconception PM2.5 offspring were
significantly lower compared with preconception FA offspring
(28.30�0.45 g preconception FA; 25.73�0.25 g preconcep-
tion PM2.5; P<0.001) (Figure 1B). Since the body weights were
different, we also measured body surface area (BSA), absolute
heart weight (HW), heart weight normalized to body weight
(HW/BW) and heart weight normalized to tibia length (HW/tibia
length). Preconception PM2.5 exposure was associated with
significantly lower BSA (91.27�0.97 cm2 preconception FA;
85.68�0.57 cm2 preconception PM2.5; P<0.001) (Figure 1C)
and
heart
weights
(128.2�1.92 mg
preconception
FA;
121.6�1.55 mg preconception PM2.5; P<0.05) at 3 months
of age (Figure 1D). HW/BW remained unchanged (4.51�0.08
mg/g preconception FA; 4.65�0.07 mg/g preconception
PM2.5; P=0.2), however HW/tibia length was decreased in
preconception PM2.5 offspring compared with preconception
FA
offspring
(63.28�1.17 mg/cm
preconception
FA;
59.89�0.79 mg/cm preconception PM2.5; P<0.05) (Figure 1E
and 1F). To perform detailed body composition analyses, we
also investigated EchoMRI in 3-month old offspring. Parental
preconception exposure to PM2.5 did not alter fat mass but lean
mass was significantly lower in preconception PM2.5 offspring
compared with preconception FA offspring (Figure S2).
Parental PM2.5 Exposure Leads to LV Systolic
Dysfunction
Echocardiographic analyses of 3-month-old preconception
PM2.5 offspring revealed no change in LVEDs (data not shown)
and slightly increased LVESd (2.51�0.07 mm preconception
FA; 2.74�0.10 mm preconception PM2.5; P=0.06). Posterior
wall thickness was not different in diastole (PWTd), but was
significantly decreased during systole (PWTs) (1.70�0.06 mm
preconception FA; 1.44�0.08 mm
preconception PM2.5;
P<0.05) (Figure 2A and 2B). These changes were associated
with reduced systolic function as evidenced by reduced %FS
(35.09�1.34 preconception FA; 29.05�1.25 preconception
PM2.5; P<0.01) and %ejection fraction (64.86�1.76 precon-
ception FA; 56.27�1.95 preconception PM2.5; P<0.01) in
preconception PM2.5 offspring compared with preconception
FA offspring (Figure 2C and 2D). Further, we observed
significant increases in LVESV (Table 2). Other important
hemodynamic parameters including cardiac output, stroke
volume, cardiac index, and heart rate were not different between
groups (Table 2). When compared using mix model analysis with
restricted maximum likelihood test, our results showed a

Parental Preconception Exposure to PM2.5
Impairs Offspring Cardiomyocyte Function
To validate cardiac-specific effects of preconception PM2.5
exposure, we performed functional analyses in isolated single
cardiomyocytes from preconception PM2.5 and preconception
FA adult hearts. Our in vitro data demonstrated alterations
in sarcomere function as indicated by a reduction in %PS
(12.93�0.42 preconception FA; 11.10�0.41 preconception
PM2.5; P<0.01), �dL/dT (�10.60�0.22 lm/s preconception
FA; �8.50�0.60 lm/s preconception PM2.5; P<0.05) and TPS90
(0.081�0.003 seconds preconception FA; 0.071�0.002 sec-
onds preconception PM2.5; P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, and 3C) in
cardiomyocytes isolated from preconception PM2.5 offspring
compared with preconception FA offspring. +dL/dT and TR90
were notdifferentbetween groups(data notshown).These results
further corroborate our echocardiography findings. When com-
pared using mix model analysis with restricted maximum
likelihood test, our results showed no significant difference in %
PS, a significant change in TPS90 and Tau (P<0.05), and a
significant trend (P=0.07) in �dL/dT.

0.67�0.09 s preconception PM2.5; P<0.05). Ca2+ transient
amplitude (Δ340/380) and decay rate (s), however, remained
unchanged between both groups (Figure 3D and 3E).
Parental Preconception Exposure to PM2.5 Alters
Expression of Ca2+ Regulatory Proteins
The normal cardiac cycle (contraction/relaxation) is depen-
dent on regulated movement of calcium between the sarco-
endoplasmic reticulum and the cytosol. To elucidate the role
of calcium pathways in cardiac dysfunction, we examined
cardiac genes and protein expression of important cellular
calcium regulators. While no change was observed in mRNA
expression of SERCA2a, PLN, and NCX (Figure S3), a marked
increase in SERCA2a and p-PLN and modest increase in NCX
was observed in preconception PM2.5 offspring compared
with preconception FA offspring (Figure 4A through 4C).
Parental Preconception Exposure to PM2.5
Activates Oxidative Stress Pathways
To better define the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction, we
studied the expression of oxidative stress markers in the
myocardium of 3-month-old preconception PM2.5 offspring.
Myocardial protein expression of nitric oxide synthase 2
(NOS2) was also increased in preconception PM2.5 offspring
compared with preconception FA offspring (Figure 5A).
Quantitative
polymerase
chain
reaction
data
showed
increased expression of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-
like 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) with no change
in the expression of catalase (Figure 5B through 5D).
Parental Preconception Exposure to PM2.5 Leads
to Activation of an Inflammatory Response
Oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways and there-
fore we studied the expression of proinflammatory genes.
Myocardial mRNA expression of proinflammatory markers such
as interleukin-6 and -15 (IL-6 and IL-15), tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-a), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of

offspring compared with preconception FA offspring (Figure 6A
through 6H). Overlapping pathways involving inflammatory
mediators (NF-jB) induce chemotactic cytokine/chemokines
(CC) in myocardial tissue. To elucidate the role of chemokine
pathways in the present study, we examined protein expression
of MCP-1, a potent chemoattractant for monocytes, T cells, and
NK cells. We observed a marked upregulation of MCP-1 protein
levels in preconception PM2.5 mouse hearts compared with
preconception FA offspring (Figure 6I).

Increases Cardiac Collagen3a1 Expression
Increased levels of inflammatory mediators were also found to
be associated with upregulation of fibrogenic mediators such
as structural extracellular matrix protein. Collagen3a1 expres-
sion was found to be significantly upregulated both at
transcriptional and translational levels (Figure 7A and 7B).
Parental Preconception Exposure to PM2.5 Alters
Epigenetic Mediators
To further elucidate the potential epigenetic mechanisms respon-
sible for the cardiac dysfunction observed in 3-month-old mice
born to preconception PM2.5-exposed parents, we examined the
expression of epigenetic mediators in myocardial tissue both at
mRNA and protein levels. While our quantitative polymerase chain
reaction data demonstrated no change in the expression of DNA
methyltransferases (Figure S4), we observed significant downreg-
ulation in protein expression of Dnmt1a and no change in Dnmt3a.

Our study shows for the first time that exposure to PM2.5
exclusively during the preconception period is sufficient to

 program the developing fetus and cause significant changes in
cardiac function, gene and protein expression. While the
primary stimulus was preconception PM2.5 exposure, altered
Ca2+ regulatory proteins, elevated levels of oxidative stress
markers, inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators suggest the
involvement of long-lasting stress responses. Our results are
consistent with previous investigations using other models of
preconception perturbations such as maternal nutritional
status,16 alcohol consumption,17 and exposure to organic
pollutants.11 All of these studies underscore the importance
of the periods around the time of conception as critical
windows of development.
Several epidemiological studies have confirmed an associa-
tion between PM exposure and other stressful preconception
events with low birth weight.13,18,19 We did not observe any
significant differences in offspring birth weight in response
to parental preconception PM2.5 exposure. Therefore, our model
is not confounded by low birth weight, a common finding of many
other preconception models. Interestingly, when analyzed at
3 months of age, the body weight and heart weight of
preconception PM2.5 offspring were significantly less. Further-
more, a detailed bodycompositionprofiledemonstratedreduced
lean mass with fat mass in preconception PM2.5 offspring.
The primary finding of the present study is the develop-
ment of cardiac dysfunction in adult offspring born to
preconception PM2.5-exposed parents as suggested by the
in vivo and in vitro functional data. Preconception PM2.5
offspring also showed a significant increase in LVESV. An
increase in LVESV is associated with increased cardiac events
in patients with LV systolic dysfunction20 and is considered as
an independent predictor of mortality.21 Isolated cardiomy-
ocyte measurements further corroborate the echocardiogra-
phy data suggestive of cardiomyocyte dysfunction. The
understanding of molecular and cellular pathways underlying
CVDs may help to define our observed cardiac effects.
The synchronized process of contraction and relaxation is
regulated by several mediators, but most important among
them is Ca2+. Alterations in Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ handling
proteins can affect cardiac function, potentially leading to
impaired myocardial contractility. Thus, we investigated the
involvement of the Ca2+ handling proteins. Our results
demonstrated no change in the expression of these proteins
at the mRNA level, but protein expression was significantly
upregulated. The upregulation of SERCA-2A and simultaneous
increased phosphorylated phospholamban in preconception
PM2.5 offspring suggests increased Ca2+ cycling to maintain
optimal cardiomyocyte function as a protective/adaptive
mechanism in response to preconception PM2.5-associated
adverse cardiac effects. Similar results were also observed by
our group in a model of maternal inflammation and neonatal
hyperoxia22 and in 14-day-old mice following in utero PM2.5
exposure.6 Of note, preconception PM2.5 exposure could
affect the myofilaments and therefore future studies are
warranted to investigate isolated myofilaments.

 Another important inference drawn from the present study
is the altered expression of oxidative stress markers in our
preconception PM2.5 exposure model. Elevated NOS2 leads
to a toxic amount of nitric oxide (NO) production which is
associated with decreased ventricular contractility and
cardiovascular dysfunction.23,24 Increased NO also con-
tributes to the production of reactive oxygen species (such
as superoxide radical [O�
2 ])25 and reactive nitrogen species,26
which further imparts deleterious effects. Moreover, the
expression of Nrf2, a key transcription factor involved in
regulating various antioxidant genes was also found to be
upregulated. We speculate that increased expression of Nfr2
is attributable to simultaneous activation of the body’s
defense mechanism to counteract inflammation-associated
oxidative insult. Similar results were observed previously in
the setting of long-term air pollution exposure.27 Among
several other antioxidant genes, SOD is also regulated by
Nrf2 and the simultaneous increased expression of SOD
further suggests the antioxidant function of Nrf2. Surpris-
ingly, we did not observe differences in catalase expression
between both groups. This could indicate that its expression
is not solely regulated by Nrf2 but also by other transcription
factors and signaling molecules.28,29 Based on our results, we
speculate increased accumulation of H2O2 because of
increased SOD (SOD catalyzes dismutation of O�
2 into O2
and H2O2) and not simultaneous availability of equal amounts
of catalase (catalase converts H2O2 into H2O and O2). The
increased H2O2 directly and/or indirectly through the
production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals can cause
myocardial injury.30 Taken together, our results suggest

 suboptimal antioxidant capacity and nitrosative stress and/
or nitroso–redox imbalance, both of which can impair LV
function.26
In addition to oxidative stress we also observed involvement
of inflammatory pathway in our study. Previously, PM2.5
exposure was shown to increase expression of genes associ-
ated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation,31,32
suggesting that these mechanisms are clinically relevant. The
increased expression of IL-6, IL-15, and TNF-a in our study may
provide an explanation behind cardiac dysfunction observed in
preconception PM2.5 offspring. In fact, previous evidence
indicated that chronically elevated levels of IL-6 induce mal-
adaptive hypertrophy and decreased contractile function.33,34
Also, myocyte specific production of IL-6 in response to injury
causes depressed basal contractility and leads to decreased
contractile function.35 Besides playing a role as an inducer of
cardiac dysfunction36 and mediator of cardiac remodeling,37
TNF-a
also
activates
NF-jB,38
a
key
inflammatory
mediator known to play a role in attenuated contractility,39
hypertrophy,40 and cardiomyopathy.41 The increased expres-
sion of NF-jB in our study was thus directly correlated with
increased TNF-a expression.
As demonstrated previously,42,43 we also observed nearly
an 8-fold increase in CRP expression in preconception PM2.5
offspring supporting the activation of inflammatory pathways.
Combined clinical findings and experimental observations
suggest that CRP is not merely a CVD risk (inflammatory)
biomarker but is a mediator of various CVDs.44 It has also
been demonstrated that CRP upregulates the expression of
adhesion molecules on endothelial cells which might serve as
an explanation for increased expression of CD26E, CD26P,
and ICAM-1 in our study. These adhesion molecules are
expressed in response to PM exposure and independently
and jointly known to be associated with an increased risk of
CVDs.45,46 Inflammation is preceded by recruitment of
monocytes and MCP-1 is the chief chemokine responsible
for monocyte infiltration to sites of inflammation.47 Func-
tional significance of MCP-1 has been reported in various
cardiovascular diseases48,49 and its expression has been
shown to be upregulated by PM exposure.50,51 We have also
demonstrated the role of MCP-1 in PM-induced reduced
contractility and Ca2+ handling of cardiomyocytes in our
previously published work.52 In the present study, increased
expression of MCP-1 in preconception PM2.5 offspring
provides additional evidence for the involvement of an
inflammatory cascade. Cytokines augment release of local
profibrotic mediators in response to injury.53 Increase in

 PM2.5 indicates activation of profibrotic mechanisms to
maintain optimum cardiac functioning.
Lastly, to answer the question of how the effects of
preconception PM2.5 are transmitted to the offspring, we
studied the expression of DNA methyltransferases. The
process of DNA methylation (regulated by DNMTs) ensures
correct gene expression, maintains genetic stability and may
provide the link between parental and offspring phenotype/
genotype transgenerationally. It has been shown that under
the stressful preconception period epigenetic modifications
can affect individuals adversely.54 The marked decrease in
protein expression of DNMT1 (and modest decrease in
DNMT3a) suggests altered epigenetic regulation. Studies
have shown that PM exposure causes DNA methylation and
can regulate various biological processes including inflamma-
tion leading to underlying CVD.55–57 In addition, we have also
observed increased levels of Sirt1 and Sirt2 in our study;
sirtuins are a family of deacetylases that play crucial roles in
maintaining the crosstalk between genetic integrity and
environment. Sirtuins are known to regulate DNMTs by
deacetylating them at various sites58 thereby altering their
activity.59 Our results are supported by a recent in vitro study
showing antagonistic effects of Sirt1 on DNMTs.60 Taken
together, our results established epigenetic links in precon-
ception PM2.5 exposure model.
Limitations of the Study
One major concern with air pollution research is the complex
nature of the natural environment. The characteristics of
particulate matter and their interaction with other environ-
mental agents/pollutants (such as other gaseous compo-
nents), could be a potential contributor to the observed
epidemiological effects of particulate exposure. In our study,
we did not investigate the contributions of these potential
confounders that could have more closely mimicked the
clinical scenario. Because of such complex environmental
interactions, there are still many research questions to be
addressed by future air pollution experimental and clinical
studies.

 Conclusion and Future Directions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has set
national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 as 35 lg/m3
per day and 12 lg/m3 per year. PM2.5 concentrations
achieved in this study were close to the daily allowable limit
but significantly more than the annual limit. Based on our
results, it is clear that this PM2.5 concentration is sufficient to
trigger adverse cardiac effects in male offspring born to
preconception PM2.5 exposed parents. Results from the
present study are of high clinical importance as they
demonstrate that parental exposures to PM2.5 before con-
ception can have long-lasting adverse cardiac effects on
offspring. Altered germs cells from parents because of PM
exposure can modify or worsen the developing cardiovascular
system of the fetus. Future work should focus on the timing of
environmental insults and their impact on the developing
cardiovascular system which may prove beneficial in treating
and preventing CVDs. Additionally, we will also examine the
effects of preconception exposure on adult female offspring
in our future work. Our findings thus underscore the
importance of designing epidemiological studies that ascer-
tain preconception parental exposures in relation to CVDs.
Results from our study were unable to identify sole maternal
or paternal contribution in the offspring phenotype. Hence,
future studies should also focus on paternal versus maternal
contribution in response to preconception exposure on the
offspring.
